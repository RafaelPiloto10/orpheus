Take these hands they're good for nothing  
You know these hands never worked a day  
Take these boots they're going nowhere  
You know these boots don't want to stray  
  
You got my head filled with songs  
You got my shoelaces undone  
Take my shirt, go on take it off me  
You can tear it up  
If you can tie me down  
  
Do you feel loved  
Do you feel loved  
Do you feel loved  
Do you feel loved  
  
Take the colors of my imagination  
Take the scent hanging in the air  
Take this tangle of a conversation  
And turn it into your own prayer  
  
With my fingers as you want them  
With my nails under your hide  
With my teeth at your back  
And my tongue to tell you the sweetest lies  
  
Do you feel loved  
Do you feel loved  
Do you feel loved  
And it looks like the sun  
But it feels like the rain  
  
Love's a bully pushing and shoving  
In the belly of a woman  
Heavy rhythm taking over  
To stick together  
A man and a woman  
Stick together  
Man and woman  
Stick together...  
  
And I feel loved  
Do you feel loved  
Do you feel loved  
And it looks like the sun  
But it feels like the rain  
And there's heat in the sun  
To see us through the rain  
  
Do you feel loved  
Do you feel loved  
Do you feel...  
Do you feel...
