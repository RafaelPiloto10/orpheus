Hey little one  
You've got the way  
I ain't doing nothin'  
That's so important  
  
I'd like to know how you deal  
Oh when I worry to darken  
If I can't get in your show  
I'll take my tom tom and go  
Yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah  
  
While you were mine  
I got so hazy  
While you passed by  
I found my answer  
  
Is this the best thing in life  
The only thing I remember  
If I can't get in your show  
I'll take my tom tom and go  
  
Pure love, sunshine  
Our love is always fine  
We are related, you know  
I'll take my tom tom and go  
We are related, you know  
I'll take my tom tom and go  
Yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah  
  
The sky is angry  
Over this city  
Birds fly like devils  
Over this city  
  
So many things of no worth  
Are being shoved in my face  
When all the wealth in the world  
May work the faith in one girl  
  
That's why I'm sad to say  
Till there can be no hate, oh  
The only one they come through  
Is absolute  
You
