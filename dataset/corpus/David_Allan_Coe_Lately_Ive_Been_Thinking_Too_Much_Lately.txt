Lately I've been thinking too much lately  
I've been staying kinda stoned  
Maybe I need someone who can make me feel  
Like I'm not making it alone  
Lately you've been colder than the weather  
Whether love was right or love was wrong  
Once you told me there was no one better  
Now you say you're better off alone  
Yesterday has ran into tomorrow  
Wrecking every dream we've ever known  
Even though we're lying here together in this bed  
I believe we're laying here alone  
  
Lately I've been drivin' myself crazy lately  
This old house ain't been no home  
I thought you were something to hold on to  
When I could not make it on my own  
Lately you've been more than I can handle lately  
I can't handle being stoned  
Maybe I need someone who can make me feel  
Like I'm not making it alone  
Yesterday has ran into tomorrow  
Wrecking every dream we've ever known  
Even though we're lying here together in this bed  
I believe we're laying here alone  
Lately I've been thinking too much lately
