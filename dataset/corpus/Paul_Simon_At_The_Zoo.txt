Someone told me  
It's all happening at the zoo  
I do believe it  
I do believe it's true  
Mmmmm, mmmmm, mmmmm  
Mmmmm, mmmmm, mmmmm  
Oh ho ho ho  
Mmmmm, mmmmm, mmmmm  
  
It's a light and tumble journey  
From the East Side to the park  
Just a fine and fancy ramble  
To the zoo  
  
But you can take the crosstown bus  
If it's raining or it's cold  
And the animals will love it  
If you do  
  
If ya do now  
  
Something tells me  
It's all happening at the zoo  
I do believe it  
I do believe it's true  
Mmmmm, mmmmm, mmmmm  
Mmmmm, mmmmm, mmmmm  
Oh ho ho ho  
Mmmmm, mmmmm, mmmmm  
  
The monkeys stand for honesty  
Giraffes are insincere  
And the elephants are kindly but they're dumb  
Ourang-outangs are skeptical  
Of changes in their cages  
And the zookeeper is very fond of rum  
  
Zebras are reactionaries  
Antelopes are missionaries  
Pigeons plot in secrecy  
And hamsters turn on frequently  
What a gas  
Ya gotta come and see  
At the zoo  
At the zoo  
At the zoo  
At the zoo
