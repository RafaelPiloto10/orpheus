Your heart burns for love  
My soul burns for blood  
I'll take you, I'll brake you  
I'll crush you, I'll brake you  
If you want me, I'll need you  
I'll kill you, feed from you  
I'll take you down that road that leads to destruction  
  
Ref.  
Come and take a walk with me  
Where the angels fear to tread  
Kiss the flame  
Feel the pain  
In the furnace of our love  
  
I can't feed my hunger  
Your youth makes me younger  
I'll hurt you, desert you  
Turn your dreams to nightmares  
I'll cheat you, I'll eat you  
I'll maim you, I'll drain you  
Come to me, come to me  
To the dark side where love sleeps  
  
Ref.  
Come and take a walk with me  
Where the angels fear to tread  
Kiss the flame  
Feel the pain  
In the furnace of our love  
Come along and talk to me  
Sing a sweet song of despair  
In your body hear the song  
In the furnace of our love  
  
I'll hurt you, you love me  
I'll scratch you, I'll cut you  
You'll kiss me, then miss me  
I laugh at your torment  
I'll have you, and own you  
Be hard and cold to you  
I'll be your dark angel  
I'll be your worst nightmare  
  
Ref.  
Come and take a walk with me  
Where the angels fear to tread  
Kiss the flame  
Feel the pain  
In the furnace of our love  
Come along and talk to me  
Sing a sweet song of despair  
In your body hear the song  
In the furnace of our love
