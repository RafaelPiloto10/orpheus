The autumn leaves are falling  
Like tears from her eyes  
There's no see me calling  
The pain you felt inside  
  
And I know you're feeling like you should run away, run away  
And I know you're wandering, oh why you should stay, why you should stay  
  
[Chorus:]  
Sweet, sweet Isabel  
Just believe it won't be alright  
Sweet sweet Isabel  
No you don't have to leave tonight  
  
You feel that change is coming  
But you were so afraid inside  
I know your heart's been broken  
Oh wait too many times  
  
And I know you're feeling like you should run away, run away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(You don't have to leave tonight)  
You don't have to leave tonight  
You don't have to leave tonight  
You don't have to leave tonight  
No you don't  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The autumn leaves are falling  
Like tears from her eyes  
There's no see me calling  
The pain you felt inside
