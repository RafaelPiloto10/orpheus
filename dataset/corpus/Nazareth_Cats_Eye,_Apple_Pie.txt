Cat's eye, apple pie, what am I going to do,  
The woman I loved walked out on me,  
What am I going to do.  
Hound dog, bull frog, she just up and gone,  
The woman I love has done me wrong,  
What am I going to do.  
Green beans, black eyed peas,  
What am I going to do,  
The woman I love has let me down,  
What am I going to do.  
  
She's a delta queen know what I mean,  
As mean as wildfire lightnin',  
She can win and break the heart of any man,  
She's the delta queen of New Orleans,  
And she loved me somethin' frightnin',  
But she left me for a dollar wavin' man.
