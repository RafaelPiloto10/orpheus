Best in the west, that's your name  
Makin' love's your claim to fame  
Better than the best, oh everyone say  
How'd he learn to love that way  
You're the best in the west  
You're a tough sharp shooter  
And you aim to win  
And I wish you'd love me now  
Like you did then  
You're the best in the west  
You're the best I've ever had  
A naughty boy  
And the memory of you fills me with joy  
Let's do it again, let's do it again  
Best in the west, when you were five  
Kissed the girls and made them cry  
Better than the best, oh you built your place  
Lovin' is a symphony  
You're the best in the west  
You've been a ladies man with class  
Since way back when  
And you stand so high above all the men  
You're the best in the west  
And your lovin' seemed to fell me  
From the start  
And the fantasy of you is in my heart  
Let's do it again, let's do it again  
Let's do it again, (Ooh let's do it, baby)  
Let's do it again  
(The way you do it, baby's good to me yeah)  
Well I'm pretty damn good myself  
But I must confess  
When it comes to makin' love  
Baby, your the best in the west  
CHORUS:  
Best in the west, that's your name  
When you gonna love me again  
Let's do it again  
CHORUS  
Better than the best, everyone say  
How'd he learn to love that way  
Let's do it again  
CHORUS  
Better than the best and everyone say  
How'd he learn to love that way  
Best in the west, that's your name  
Makin' love's your claim to fame  
Let's do it again  
Better than the best and everyone say  
When you gonna love me again  
Let's do it again  
Better than the best and everyone say  
How'd he learn to love that way  
Let's do in again
