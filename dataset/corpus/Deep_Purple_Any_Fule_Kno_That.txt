If you're in the right city at the right time  
What's the last thing going through your mind  
Not talking 'bout your, ask no questions, you know it's a lie  
You're just a victim of a corporate crime  
All the signs of a shark attack  
You've got rivers of blood on the streets, don't look back  
Nothing personal, just another snack  
'N Harley said you're better off sticking to your guns  
Any fule kno that  
  
Oh Moronica Queen of the Biz  
And her friend Flash Harry thinks he knows what it is  
Tin Pan Alley Fat Head Larry don't know shit  
Just trying to keep her happy  
There's no laughing in heaven, not the one, not the seven  
And you'll never get to heaven in her row boat  
Pea brain pisser, dog breath kisser  
'N Harley said you're better off sticking to your guns  
Any fule kno that  
Any fule kno that  
Any fule kno that  
  
Ooh  
Won't it be nice  
When everything falls into place  
  
Salad days go a-tickling by  
Have a high time, burn money in the meantime  
They bleed you dry  
Those suckers are smaller than life  
Oh Moronica Queen of the Biz  
And her friend Flash Harry thinks he knows what it is  
Tin Pan Alley Fat Head Larry don't know shit  
I'm better off sticking to my guns  
Any fule kno that  
Any fule kno that  
Any fule kno that  
  
Ooh  
Won't it be nice  
When everything falls into place  
  
Danny went down to the river one day  
Didn't come back, that's the last, they say  
We ever saw of him, that's no lie  
Spitting in your eye, have no fear  
You don't want the truth  
Stick your finger in your ear  
Any fule kno that  
Any fule kno that  
Any fule kno that
