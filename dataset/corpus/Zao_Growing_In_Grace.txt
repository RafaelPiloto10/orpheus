He is God, He is God. He is God, He is God.  
He is with us, He is God. He is with us, He is God.  
In His purpose I will stand.  
I've been renewed by the Maker.  
In His purpose I will stand.  
I've been renewed by Him alone.  
Been made by the Maker.  
Been bought by the Buyer.  
Broken by the Breaker.  
I'm His. I'm His.  
In His purpose I will stand.  
I've been renewed by Him alone.  
made by the Maker.  
bought by the Buyer.  
Broken by the Breaker.  
I'm His. I'm His.  
In refuge and strength,  
ever present help in trouble,  
without fear.  
As the nations uproar and the kingdoms fall.  
He lifts His voice-melting,  
He is with us. He is God.  
He is with us. He is God.  
He is with us. He is God.  
He is with us. He is God.  
Been made by the Maker.  
Been bought by the Buyer.  
Broken by the Breaker.  
I'm His. I'm His
