He was born so far away  
So the story's told  
We remember Christmas Day  
When winter days grow cold  
  
With the time it passes by  
We put away the trim  
Then we live and wonder why  
We can't remember Him  
  
The Christmas star shines once a year  
And then it fades away  
Keep the spirit in your heart  
It's Christmas everyday (christmas everyday)  
  
It's not the bells and it's not the snow  
And it's not the gifts we get  
But He was born so long ago  
It's easy to forget  
  
Peace on earth, good will too men  
But men can't go alone  
We get lost along the way  
But He can bring us home  
  
Remember Him throughout the year  
Without the star above  
He left us all a Christmas gift  
He left the gift of love  
  
The Christmas star shines once a year  
And then it fades away  
Keep the spirit in your heart  
And it's Christmas every day
