Linda, Linda  
Morning noon an' night I find  
Linda's always on my mind  
  
When I go to sleep,  
I never count sheep,  
I count all the charms about Linda!  
  
An' lately it seems,  
In all of my dreams,  
I walk with my arms about Linda  
  
But what good does it do me,  
For Linda doesn't know I exist,  
Can't help feelin' gloomy,  
Think of all the lovin' I've missed!  
  
We pass on the street,  
My heart skips a beat,  
I say to myself, "Hello Linda!"  
  
If only she'd smile,  
I'd stop for a while,  
Then I would get to know Linda!  
  
But miracles still happen,  
And when my lucky star begins to shine,  
With one luck break I'll make Linda  
  
Someday I'll betcha,  
I'm gonna getcha!  
  
Oh, Linda, Linda  
My Linda, Linda  
We pass on the street,  
My heart skips a beat,  
I say to myself, "Hello Linda!"  
  
If only she'd smile,  
I'd stop for a while,  
Then I would get to know Linda!  
  
But miracles still happen,  
And when my lucky star begins to shine,  
With one luck break I'll make Linda  
  
I'll make Linda mine!
