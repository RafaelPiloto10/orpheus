Programmes of violence,  
As entertainment,  
Brings the disease into your room.  
We know the germ,  
Which is man-made in metal,  
Is really a key to your own tomb.  
  
Prevention is better than cure,  
Bad apples affecting the pure,  
You'll gather your senses I'm sure  
Then agree to,  
  
Melt the guns,  
Melt the guns,  
Melt the guns,  
And never more to fire them.  
  
Melt the guns,  
Melt the guns,  
Melt the guns,  
And never more desire them.  
  
Children will want them,  
Mothers supply them,  
As long as your killers are heroes.  
And all the media  
Will fiddle while Rome burns,  
Acting like modern-time Neros.  
  
Prevention is better than cure,  
Bad apples affecting the pure,  
You'll gather your senses I'm sure  
Then agree to,  
  
Melt the guns,  
Melt the guns,  
Melt the guns,  
And never more to fire them.  
  
Melt the guns,  
Melt the guns,  
Melt the guns,  
And never more desire them.  
  
I'm speaking to the Justice League of America.  
The you S of A,  
Hey you,  
Yes you in particular!  
When it comes to the judgement day and you're standing at the gates with your
weaponry,  
You dead go down on one knee,  
Clasp your hands in prayer and start quoting me,  
'cause we say...  
Our father we've managed to contain the epidemic in one place, now,  
Let's hope they shoot themselves instead of others,  
Help to civilize the race now.  
We've trapped the cause of the plague,  
In the land of the free and the home of the brave.  
If we listen quietly we can hear them shooting from grave to grave.  
You ought to,  
  
Melt the guns,  
Melt the guns,  
Melt the guns,  
And never more to fire them.  
  
Melt the guns,  
Melt the guns,  
Melt the guns,  
And never more desire them.
