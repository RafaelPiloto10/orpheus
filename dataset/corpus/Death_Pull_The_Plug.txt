Memories is all that's left behind  
As I lay and wait to die  
Little do they know  
That I hear their choice of life  
  
End it now, it is the only way  
Too cruel, that is what they say  
Release me from this lonely world  
There is no hope - Why don't you  
  
Pull the plug  
Let me pass away  
Pull the plug  
Don't want to life this way  
  
Once I had full control of my life  
I now behold a machine decides my fate  
End it now it's all to late  
  
What has now been days, it seems like years  
To stay like this is what I fear  
Life ends so fast, so take your chance  
And make it last  
  
End it now, it is the only way  
Too cruel, that is what they say  
Release me from this lonely world  
There is no hope - Why don't you  
  
Pull the plug  
Let me pass away  
Pull the plug  
Don't want to life this way
