Faced with the choice  
What would you say?  
The path of least resistance  
It seems the only way  
But can we look a little further?  
Too little far I think  
Self-belief's the answer  
And not another drink  
The safe method, the only way  
You rationalise your course  
Stay part of the crowd  
And never find the source  
Feel wanted, feel numb  
Just stay as you are  
The truth is - comfort kills  
And you don't need that car  
So sad, the early grave  
When all the fun's for free  
Start digging the early grave  
And keep it warm for me  
Faced with the choice  
What would you say?  
The path of least resistance  
It seems the only way  
But let's look a little further  
Too little far, I think  
Self-belief's the answer  
And not another drink  
The safe method, the only way  
You rationalise your course  
Stay a part of the crowd  
And never find the source  
Feel wanted, feel numb  
Just stay as you are  
The truth is, comfort kills  
And you don't need that car
