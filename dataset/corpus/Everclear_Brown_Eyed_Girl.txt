(I hear a song, it makes me think of a girl I used to know...  
I sing along when I hear it on the radio now)  
  
Hey now where'd we go?  
Yeah days when the rains came  
Way down in the hollows  
Oooh yeah playing a new game  
  
Laughing and a-running  
Hey hey  
Skipping and a-jumping  
In the misty morning fog  
Oh baby, yeah my heart's a-thumping you  
  
My brown eyed girl  
(Brown eyed girl...brown eyed girl)  
You my  
Brown eyed girl  
  
Do you remember when? (do you remember when?)  
Yeah we used to sing...  
Sha la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
Sha la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
  
(I hear a song, it makes me think of a girl I used to know)  
  
Hey... Hey... Hey  
  
(I sing along when I hear it on the radio now)  
  
Now that the years gone by  
Yeah now that I'm on my own  
I saw you baby, just the other day  
But my baby, you have grown  
  
I cast my memory back there Lord  
Sometimes, I am overcome just thinking about it  
Making love in the green grass  
Behind the stadium with you  
  
My brown eyed girl  
You my  
Brown eyed girl  
(My brown eyed girl...my brown eyed girl)  
  
You my  
Brown eyed girl  
(My brown eyed girl...my brown eyed girl)  
You my  
Brown eyed girl  
  
Do you remember when?  
  
Yeah we used to sing  
Sha la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
Sha la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
  
Sha la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
Sha la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
I hear a song  
It makes me think of a girl  
I used to know  
  
HEY...HEY...HEY  
  
I sing along  
When I hear it on the radio now  
  
I sing along  
When I hear it on the radio  
  
Now
