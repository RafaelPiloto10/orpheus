The moment I saw him smile  
I knew he was just my style  
My only regret is we've never met  
Though I dream of him all the while  
  
But he doesn't know I exist  
No matter how I may persist  
So it's clear to see there's no hope for me  
Though I live at fifty-one-thirty-five Kensington Avenue  
And he lives at fifty-one-thirty-three  
  
How can I ignore the boy next door  
I love him more than I can say  
Doesn't try to please me  
Doesn't even tease me  
And he never sees me glance his way  
  
And though I'm heart-sore, the boy next door  
Affection for me won't display  
I just adore him  
So I can't ignore him  
The boy next door  
  
I just adore him  
So I can't ignore him  
The boy next door
