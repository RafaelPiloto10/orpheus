Live by the sword and help to contain  
The helpless minds of you all  
Die by my hand in pools of blood  
Clutch yourself as you fall  
Mindless tyranny, forgotten victims  
Children slaughtered in vain  
Raping the maids, in which they serve  
Only the words of the Lord  
  
Die by the sword  
Die by the sword  
  
Satan watches all of us  
Smiles as some do his bidding  
Try to escape the grasp of my hand  
And your life will no longer exist  
Hear our cry, save us from  
The Hell in which we live  
We turn our heads toward the sky  
And listen for the steel  
  
Die by the sword  
Die by the sword  
  
Watch as flowers decay  
On the cryptic life that died  
The wisdom of the wizards  
Is only a nurtured lie  
Black knights of Hell's domain  
Walk upon the dead  
Satan's sits upon  
The blood on which he feeds  
  
Die by the sword  
Die by the sword
