There's a new sensation  
A fabulous creation  
A danceable solution  
To teenage revolution  
Do the Strand love  
When you feel love  
It's the new way  
That's why we say  
Do the Strand  
Do it on the tables  
Quaglino's place or Mabel's  
Slow and gentle  
Sentimental  
  
All styles served here  
Louis Seize he prefer  
Laissez-faire Le Strand  
Tired of the tango  
Fed up with fandango  
Dance on moonbeams  
Slide on rainbows  
In furs or blue jeans  
You know what I mean  
Do the Strand  
  
Had your fill of Quadrilles  
The Madison and cheap thrills  
Bored with the Beguine  
The samba isn't your scene  
They're playing our tune  
By the pale moon  
We're incognito  
  
Down the Lido  
And we like the Strand  
Arabs at oasis  
Eskimos and Chinese  
If you feel blue  
Look through Who's Who  
See La Goulue  
And Nijinsky  
Do the Strandsky  
Weary of the Waltz  
And mashed potato schmaltz  
Rhododendron  
  
Is a nice flower  
Evergreen  
It lasts forever  
But it can't beat Strand power  
The Sphynx and Mona Lisa  
Lolita and Guernica  
Did the Strand
