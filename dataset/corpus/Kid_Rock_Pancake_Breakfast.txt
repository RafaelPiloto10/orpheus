Smokin any thing that I can fit in a pipe  
Slammin bottles of tussin and going fishing for pike  
Never uptight my high won't permit it  
My problem's life but I don't sweat it, just live it  
  
And I'm not your average rapper  
Got the same birthdate as Thomas Crapper  
So bitch better watch your back  
'cause I push more power than a Marshall stack  
  
Never the wack but oh so pesky  
Some say I can't flow but mother fucker don't test me  
And if you arrest me you dumb cop  
I'll find your daughter and I'll give her this cock  
  
Kid Rock's my mother fuckin name  
Bitch you know me so pass the O.E.  
And don't talk about takin me out  
'cause I got your girl and I'm makin her shout  
  
Just like a piano I'm really grand  
And I got more riffs than Steely Dan  
Some friends call me fly  
But most just call me when they want to get high  
  
It ain't the disco Cisco Kid mother fucker  
It's the outlasting shotgun-blasting  
Dick-swingin' pussy lickin' punk  
little skinny mother fucker and I'm not no hunk  
  
But I got more rhymes than a cornfield stalks  
And I turn more tricks than Tony Hawk  
Walk with a limp 'cause I pimp like a pro  
And if ya dis me punk I'll fuck your ho  
  
And though you think I'm nothing more than a young punk  
I'm like a hound dog chasin a chipmunk  
I move quick like a cheetah  
And it ain't shit to me to just beat a  
  
M.C. down who looks like a dick  
Jumpin 'round like a homo on a pogo stick  
Yo rock, What's up stop being a jerk  
And just "Give 'em an example of how a D.J. works"  
  
'cause it's blackjack and I got two aces  
Been many places seen many faces  
And everywhere I go people want to jive  
So I keep my fingers on my .45  
  
So don't cross my dusty path  
Or I'll put my foot up in crusty ass  
Don't front ho pass the jay  
Then hear me M.C. and watch me D.J.  
  
To the beat y'all and I won't stop  
And I'ma rock this shit till your eardrums pop  
Everybody's tryin' to get a piece of the pie  
But I don't let bullshit spoil my high
