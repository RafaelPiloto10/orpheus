I walked through a pool of water and I seen the shadow of a broken hearted
girl  
Pictured us walking to the altar, for better or for worse  
  
Why don't you stand, stand by me, oh my darling stand by me  
We gon' make a movie, a movie and it's gon' be in three D, in three D  
We gon' make a movie, a movie and it's gon' be in three D, in three D  
Why don't you stand, stand by me, oh my darling stand by me, stand by me  
  
I ain't pop no Molly but you still got me sweating  
What happened to that feeling? We'll never get it back  
I ain't take no shots but you still got me hot  
What happened to that feeling? I wish it wouldn't stop  
  
We were supposed to be together  
We were supposed to be together  
  
They say that love can hit you so fast  
Plenty odds are running out of time  
But ours is on the border walk baby  
Take me as I am or not  
I can't breathe without you, without you as mine  
  
Why don't you stand, stand by me, oh my darling stand by me  
We gon' make a movie, a movie and it's gon' be in three D, in three D  
We gon' make a movie, a movie and it's gon' be in three D, in three D  
  
Stand by me, yeah, my darling, stand by me, yeah  
Yeah, three D, yeah, movie, we gon' make a three D, three D  
  
Why don't you stand, stand by me, oh my darling stand by me  
We gon' make a movie, a movie and it's gon' be in three D, in three D  
We gon' make a movie, a movie and it's gon' be in three D, three D  
Why don't you stand, stand by me, oh my darling stand by me
