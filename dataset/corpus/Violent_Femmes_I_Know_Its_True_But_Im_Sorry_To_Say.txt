I know it's true, but I'm sorry to say  
Yesterdays a day away.  
Nothing I can do to make it stay like that.  
Ain't that a fact.  
  
I know it's true, but I'm sorry to say  
I just can't handle things this way.  
I know it's late, but I'd like to stay a while, see you smile.  
  
Will you meet me in the morning, with sun fresh on the dew?  
Will you meet me in the afternoon, made just for me and you?  
Will you meet me in the evening, when the nighttime starts to crawl?  
Will you meet me in the hall?  
Will you meet me on the wall?  
Will you meet me at all?  
  
One more time, one more time.  
Shaking up and down my spine.  
Jump a rope or skip a line or two.  
What can I do?  
  
One more time, one more time.  
Color flashing neon signs.  
Advertising a friend of my distraction, latest attraction.  
  
Oh my body has been punished.  
Lord, I think I've had enough.  
Oh my body has been punished  
With too much and not enough.  
Oh my body has been punished  
And my mind can no longer bluff.  
My mind is so unkind, my mind is so unkind.  
It keeps me crying all the time.  
  
I know it's true, but I'm sorry to say  
Yesterdays a day away.
