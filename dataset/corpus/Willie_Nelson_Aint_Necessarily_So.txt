You can't break your eggs to count your chickens  
And you can't break your neck to keep your ducks all in a row  
But don't think every chance you take, has to mean a new mistake  
It ain't necessarily so  
Now depending on the soil and the season  
You can plant a seed and you can watch it grow  
But you can't have a guarantee 'cause everything that aught to be  
Ain't necessarily so  
I laugh when I can and I live with the rest  
I learned that holdin' on means lettin' go  
I try to be a friend to the person on my left  
They say you just can't be too careful who you know  
But that ain't necessarily so  
I'd like to have more faith in human logic  
Basin' all the rules on the proof that you can show  
But I can't take my guesses back that I based on all those facts  
That ain't necessarily so  
And every time I follow what I'm feelin'  
I end up in the same place my heart would have me go  
If there's one rule of life I trust, it's everything outside your gut  
Ain't necessarily so  
I laugh when I can and I live with the rest  
I learned that holdin' on means lettin' go  
I try to be a friend to the person on my left  
They say you just can't be too careful who you know  
But that ain't necessarily so  
I laugh when I can and I live with the rest  
I learned that holdin' on means lettin' go  
I try to be a friend to the person on my left  
They say you just can't be too careful who you know  
But that ain't necessarily so
