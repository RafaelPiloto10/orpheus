You found folks treat you right  
As long as you let them know  
You've been ready to defend their right  
Through doors that they oppose  
  
But if it chokes you let it go  
If it doesn't sound true to you  
It's no business of yours  
  
You can count friends on your fingers  
Count 'em on your toes  
If you leave you are a friend of all  
Those friendships heaven knows  
  
But there comes a time when your testimony  
Will crumble like a rose  
Let's have no pretense  
  
It's over  
Friendships can never be forgotten  
It's all there  
True friends will never question you  
You  
  
And it's all there  
In the stories  
We're about to read of a long time ago  
And it's really always been there  
To let you know  
  
There are times way back in history  
Where valor overcame  
The almighty tyrants of the past  
Forgotten all but name  
As the sons of righteous leaders  
Bent on crushing nations  
Thus believe the sprirt just  
  
And it's all there  
Frienships can never be forgotten  
In the end years  
You've got to hold on to what you've got  
What you've got  
  
And it's all there  
In the stories  
We're about to read of a long time ago  
In the modern day around  
You let it show  
  
You can see love deep in children's eyes  
Feel 'em in the wind  
You can reach the blessings of the  
Innocence on which we meet  
You can guide love in the atomosphere  
Arising from the source  
You know the citizen of chance is  
Another citizen of choice  
  
If you're mortal, be destroyed  
Then immortal be the course
