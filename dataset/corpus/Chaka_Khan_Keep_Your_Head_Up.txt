When your heart is free  
It?s easy to make a decision  
When your head is clear  
You know you have good judgment  
But when your life is turning topsy turvey  
And you have no reasons for what?s disturbing  
Remember these words my father said to me  
(Chorus)  
He said: Keep your head up don?t say you love him  
(Keep your head)  
Walk away from all that has hurt you  
(Find your power)  
Find your power you know your strong  
Make that step and it will help you along  
  
When your mind's at peace  
(at peace)  
Sleep comes so very peacefully  
When you start to dream  
They are wonderful and so very sweet  
But when your life is turning topsy turvey  
And you have no answers for what?s disturbing  
Remember these words a preacher said to me  
(Chorus)  
He said: Keep your head up don?t say you love him  
(Keep your head up)  
Walk away from all that is hurting  
(Find your power)  
Find your power you know your strong  
(Take that step)  
Make that step and it will help you along (2x)  
  
Why give up this time you can win  
(You can win)  
Why give up this battle is within  
(Is within)  
Why stay when you don't know what he's gonna do  
Why choose him when its time to choose you  
  
Keep your head up don?t say you love him  
Walk away from all that is hurting  
Find your power you know your strong  
Make that step it will help you along (2x)  
Keep your head up (6x)
