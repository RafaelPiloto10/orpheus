The gentle healer came into our town today  
He touched my eyes and the Darkness left to stay  
But more than the blindness  
He took their sins away  
The gentle healer came into our town today  
The gentle healer came into our town today  
He spoke one word that was all he had to say  
And one who had dies just rose up straight away  
The gentle healer came into our town today  
Oh he seems like just an ordinary man  
With dirty feet and rough but gentle hands  
But the words he says are hard to understand  
Yet he seems like just an ordinary man  
The gentle healer He left our town today  
I just looked around and found he?d gone away  
Some folks from town who followed him they  
The gentle healer is the truth, the life, the way  
The gentle healer it the truth, the life, the way
