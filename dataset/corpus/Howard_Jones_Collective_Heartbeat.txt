Studio Version  
  
  
  
(Thoughts and actions?) of words you've spoken  
Write the scripts of life and open up the possibilities  
To choose the role you feel happy in  
  
Positive and negative  
Hiding in the fabric of every choice and every wish  
So choose a role you feel happy in  
(Choose a role you feel happy in)  
(Choose a role you feel happy in)  
(Choose a role you feel happy in)  
(Choose a role you feel happy in)  
  
Here's the card that you've been given  
It's not much but its neatly written  
Here's the life that you are living  
Choose a role that you feel happy in  
You get hurt and end up leaving  
But to stay is most revealing  
Take the knocks and get the meaning  
Choose a role you feel happy in  
  
You're feeling like a stranger in your own world  
Listen to the Collective Heartbeat  
You're feeling like a stranger in your own world

Acoustic Version  
  
  
  
There's a person that I know  
OK its you and me  
Keeps coming up against a brick wall  
Always blaming and complaining but sustaining  
While their luck doesn't change at all  
Obstacles and ridicule  
Are common in his head  
Does he even listen  
To that collective heartbeat  
  
Here's the card that you've been given  
Its not much but its neatly written  
And here's the life that you are living  
Choose a role that you feel happy in  
  
You get hurt and end up leaving  
But to stay is most revealing  
Take the knocks and get the meaning  
Before moving on up to hit the imaginary ceiling  
  
Beyond that firewall is a devastating view  
Take the time to listen to the collective heartbeats  
  
Here's the card that you've been given  
Its not much but its neatly written  
And here's the life that you are living  
Choose a role that you feel happy in  
  
You can go round it or under it or over it or back away  
Face on ,head to head  
  
idle away tomorrow but today  
  
Here's the card that you've been given  
Its not much but its neatly written  
And here's the life that you are living  
Choose a role that you feel happy in  
  
Choose a role that you feel happy in  
Choose a role that you feel happy in  
Choose a role that you feel happy in  
Choose a role that you feel happy in  
Choose a role that you feel happy in  
Choose a role that you feel happy in  
Choose a role that you feel happy in
