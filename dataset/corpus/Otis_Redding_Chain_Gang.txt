That's the sound of the men  
They are working on the chain gang  
That's the sound of the men  
They are working on the chain gang  
That's the sound of the men  
They are working on the chain gang  
  
All day long they work so hard  
Till the sun's comin' down  
Workin' on the highways and biways  
And wearin' a frown  
  
I hear them moanin' their lives away  
And then you hear somebody say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hear someone sayin'  
Whoa I work, work so hard  
See my woman, who I love so dear,  
But I, I've got to work right here.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My, my, my, my, I work so hard  
Give me water, I'm thirsty  
Whoa I, I work so hard  
  
You hear them moanin' their lives away,  
And then you hear somebody say  
  
[Chorus: x2]
