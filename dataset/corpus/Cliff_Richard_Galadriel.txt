My love is turning.  
Like a wheel of fire she burns her way.  
My love is burning.  
She's a light to guide me through the fray.  
Galadriel, spirit of starlight.  
Eagle and dove gave birth to thee.  
Galadriel, spirit of starlight.  
You are my love and earth to me, my  
Love and earth to me.  
My love is seeing.  
Through unabiased eyes she reads the signs.  
My love is searching.  
For new life somewhere she's bound to find.  
Galadriel, spirit of starlight.  
Eagle and dove give birth to thee.  
Galadriel, spirit of starlight.  
You are my love and earth to me.  
My love and earth to me.
