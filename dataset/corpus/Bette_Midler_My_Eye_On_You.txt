Your hair's so fair, your eye's so dark  
I love you hard as my life  
You pass me by as though I were a stone  
You cut me like a knife  
  
Boy, I do. I got my eye on you  
Got my eye on you  
  
I'm walking down by the water's edge  
Feel like I'm coming apart  
I'm so afraid of this jealous rage  
That's taken hold of my heart  
  
And, boy, I do. I got my eye on you  
Boy, I do. I got my eye on you  
  
Boy! Now I, I've reached the end  
End of the line  
Baby, here's a kiss  
To remember me by!  
  
Boy, I do. I got my eye on you  
My eye on you  
  
I had a dream I was dressed in white  
The witness swears on the stand  
They caught me cryin' in the street last night  
The gun was still in my hand  
  
And, Boy, I do. I got my eye on you  
Boy, I do. I got my eye on you  
Got my eye on you!  
My eye on you!  
My eye on you  
My eye on you  
My eye on you  
My eye on you  
My eye on you  
My eye on you  
My eye on you  
Yes, I do, babe  
My eye on you
