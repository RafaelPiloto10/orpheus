Baby slow down just hear me out  
There's something I gotta let you know  
No need push no need to rush  
You know you had me from hello  
  
When it comes to my heart I don't play  
Baby boy can't you see the stop sign  
You're movin' much to fast  
Baby love doesn't grow in a day  
Just get it right the first time  
Make this feeling last  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby if your willing to wait  
We can just take our time  
Don't you know that it's getting late  
And I know what's on your mind  
I know this feeling is crazy  
It's mutual baby  
But we don't have to rush something real  
Baby if you're willing to wait  
We can just take our time  
  
Boy can't you see I'm not tryin' be  
The girl who gets taken for a ride  
If you take your time then you will find  
There's so much more to me inside  
And just say there's no need to delay  
Your telling me to trust you  
Boy you know I want to baby  
But my heart can so recently break  
Before we take this very far show me who you really are  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Baby love doesn't grow in a day  
Let's get it right the first time  
And make this feeling last  
  
[Chorus]
