Jane you say it's all over for you and me girl  
There's a time for love and a time for letting it be baby  
Jane you're playing a game called, called hard to get by it's real name,  
Making believe that you just don't feel the same. Oh Jane  
  
Jane you're playing a game you never can win girl  
You're staying away so I'll ask you where you been baby  
Like a cat and a mouse, (Cat and a mouse) from door to door and house to house  
Don't you pretend you don't know what I'm talking about  
  
Were all those nights we spent together, hey hey  
Only because you didn't know better, I gotta know  
Jane, you're playin' a game, playin' a game, playin' a game  
  
(Jane, Jane, Jane)  
  
Ah Jane you're playing a game of hide and go seek  
Jane you're playing for fun but I play for keeps, yes I do  
(Jane, Jane, Jane) That's a game on me  
(Jane, Jane, Jane) So plain to see  
Janey Jane why you foolin' with me  
  
(Jane, Jane, Jane)
