Gonna tell you a story  
About Chuck and Diane.  
Couple British kids from  
The palace at Buckingham.  
Chuckie wants to grow up  
And be a polo star,  
And ride his little horsies  
All around the backyard. (oh yeah)  
You know they really paid their dues.  
I said hey, lawdy mama.  
They got them Buckingham blues.  
  
Now Chuckie goes hunting,  
And leaves Diane alone.  
So she fixes her hair,  
And she talks on the Princess Phone.  
Chuckie's still tryin' to figure out  
What his job's supposed to be,  
And Diane's the fashion leader  
Of the aristocracy.  
I said hey, Lady Di,  
Tell me where'd you get them shoes? Ah,  
Well hey nonny nonny,  
Looks like you got them Buckingham blues.  
  
Aw, bein' heir to the throne, well  
It must be awful hard.  
Gotta pose for pictures  
Out on the front yard.  
And Lady Di, well,  
She must have it pretty rough.  
Gotta hang around the house all day,  
Makin' babies and stuff.  
Another game of croquet,  
Then they're off on a Caribbean cruise.  
Well hey bop-a-re-bop,  
They really got them Buckingham blues.  
  
(Ah, tell it to me, now tell it to--wow!  
Ah got my mojo workin'!)  
  
They don't serve no Twinkees  
With their afternoon tea.  
Never had a dinner  
Made by Chef Boy-ar-Dee.  
Bein' in the spotlight  
Is a hard life to choose.  
Diane drops half a pound,  
It's on the six o'clock news. Ah yeah,  
Those kids have really paid their dues.  
Aw, what a royal pain it is,  
When you got them Buckingham blues.
