How many dreams am I looking for in your eyes, in your eyes  
Ooh baby bet it seems that you're reaching down, all alone, on your own  
Dreams are emotion baby, you know you gotta try  
  
How am I supposed to know what's in your head, what's on your mind  
I'm searching for your love that's in your heart I need it  
Here I go impossible again  
Should I hold you close to keep the night from ending  
  
I know I put you on a pedestal in my eyes, in my eyes  
I don't like it when you put me down 'cause it hurts, yeah it hurts  
Win some and lose some baby, you know you gotta try  
  
I feel it my heart and in my soul and through my veins  
Falling from my lips three little words 'I love you'  
Here I go impossible again  
Should I hold you close to keep the night from ending  
  
Dive into the ocean baby you know you gotta try  
  
How am I supposed to know what's in your head, what's on your mind  
I'm searching for your love that's in your heart I need it  
Here I go impossible again  
Should I hold you close to keep the night from ending  
Here I go impossible again  
Should I hold you close to keep the night from ending
