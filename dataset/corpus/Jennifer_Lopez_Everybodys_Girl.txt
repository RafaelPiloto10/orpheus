Let's play a game  
Let's just pretend like you don't know who I am  
Believe it if you say that you're not a fan  
Act like I'm interested in some other man  
  
Turn on the lights  
So that the cameras' flashing won't be so bright  
And let the crowd ain't getting big outside  
They're wanting details on how I live my life  
  
There's no escape from the fame  
To somewhere they don't know my name  
I love you I do feel your pain  
But the question still remain  
  
[Chorus]  
Can you love somebody loved by everybody?  
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?  
Can you love somebody loved by everybody?  
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?  
  
Can you love the, can you love the, can you love the girl?  
Can you love the, can you love the, can you love the girl?  
Can you love the, can you love the, can you love the girl?  
Can you love her, can you love her, can you love her?  
  
Out through the back  
Too many people blocking the front door  
We go our different ways so we want more  
Another gig I got in until four  
  
There's no escape from the fame  
To somewhere they don't know my name  
I love you I do feel your pain  
But the question still remain  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I love it, I love it  
Cool as summercool  
I'm flying and I love it  
She just wants to be seen  
  
Can you hang to a shooting star  
Handle distance near and far  
Don't let the jealousy and envy get to you  
'Cause I'll be running home back to you  
  
[Chorus]
