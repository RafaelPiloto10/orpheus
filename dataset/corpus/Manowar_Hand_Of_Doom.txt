Hands of doom are reaching out to crush all infidels who stray  
Time to know the pain, but no time to run within  
And these hands you see before you will end the light of day  
Your ashes will be cast into the wind  
  
Your blood's upon the soil, your body fed to wolves  
Not one of you will be left alive  
Hear the sound pounding and the army of the night  
By the hammer of Thor you now shall die  
  
Tonight we strike, there is thunder in the sky  
Together we'll fight, some of us will die  
We'll always remember that we made a stand  
And many will die by my hand  
  
We are high atop a mountain with hammers in the wind  
Lusting for blood and death again  
In a flash of lightning strike  
Now the house of death invites you, body and soul to come within  
  
I see the fear you have inside you can run but never hide  
I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb  
Nothing shall remain not your memory, your name  
It will be as though you never, ever lived  
  
Tonight we strike, there is thunder in the sky  
Together we'll fight, some of us will die  
We'll always remember that we made a stand  
Many will die by my hand  
They will die  
High atop a mountain with hammers in the wind  
Lusting for blood and death again  
In a flash of lightning strike  
Now the house of death invites you, body and soul to come within  
  
I see the fear you have inside you can run but never hide  
I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb  
Nothing shall remain not your memory, your name  
It will be as though you never, ever lived  
  
Tonight we strike, there is thunder in the sky  
Together we'll fight, some of us will die  
But we'll always remember that we made a stand  
And many will die by my hand  
They will die, by my hand, they will die
