Emily  
  
We're all alone on the stage tonight.  
We've been told we're not afraid of you.  
We know all our lines so well, uh-huh.  
We've said them so many times:  
Time and time again,  
Line and line again.  
  
Ooh, yeah, you're amazing!  
We think you're incredible.  
You say we're fantastic,  
But still we don't head the bill.  
  
Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Unbelievable!  
Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Unbelievable!  
  
When the actor reaches his death,  
You know it's not for real. He just holds his breath.  
But he always dives too soon, too fast to save himself.  
  
He'll never make the screen.  
He'll never make the 'Sweeney',  
Be that movie queen.  
He's too busy hitting the Vaseline.  
  
Ooh, yeah, you're amazing!  
We think you are really cool.  
We'd give you a part, my love,  
But you'd have to play the fool.  
  
Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Unbelievable!  
Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Unbelievable!  
  
We're all alone on the stage tonight.  
We're all alone,  
On the stage,  
Tonight.
