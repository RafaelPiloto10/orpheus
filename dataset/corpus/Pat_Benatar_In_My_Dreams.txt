I have been here in this lonely place  
Longer than I care to think or say  
Hopin' with a little luck  
Maybe I'd find someone like you  
  
I have watched you nearly every morning  
Gettin' your coffee, stretchin', yawnin'  
Doin' all the little things you do  
To start your day  
  
[Chorus 1]  
In my dreams I hold your hand  
Lay my cheek close to yours  
And hold back as long as I can  
Feel the sweet sting of your kiss as our lips combine  
  
I know that you've seen me, too  
Once you smiled when I looked at you  
I wonder if you thought about me  
The way I thought of you  
  
Maybe I just make too much of passing glances  
Fleeting touches, maybe I'm a dreamer  
Maybe so are you  
  
[Chorus 2]  
  
In my dreams I hold you close  
Love you the way that I'd hope  
Say what you already know  
In my dreams I pretend  
That you are mine
