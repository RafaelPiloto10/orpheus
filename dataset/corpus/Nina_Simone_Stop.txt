All that I have is all that you've given me  
(Ohhhh)  
Did you never worry that I'd come to depend on you  
(Ohhhh)  
I gave you all the love I had in me  
Now I find you lied and I can't believe its true  
Oooh whoa oh  
You better stop (Stop)  
Before you tear me apart  
You better stop (Stop)  
Before you go and break my heart  
Ooooh oooh oooh you better stop  
Time after time I tried to walk away  
But its not that easy  
When you soul is torn in two  
So I just resigned myself to it everyday yeh  
And now all that I can do is to leave it up to you Ohhh  
Ooh whoa oh  
You better stop (Stop)  
Before you tear me apart  
You better stop (Stop)  
Before you go and break my heart  
Ooooh oooh oooh you better stop  
Ohh ooh whoa you better stop  
If you love me  
Now the time to be sorry  
I won't believe that you'd walk out on me baby  
Ohhh yehhh  
Oooh  
Ooh whoa oh  
You better stop (Stop)  
Before you tear me apart  
You better stop (Stop)  
Before you go and break my heart  
No whoa whoa you'd better stop stop

You'd better stop stop stop
