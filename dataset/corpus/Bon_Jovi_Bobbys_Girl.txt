I'd give you my ring, I'd fill you with promises  
I'd give you anything you want  
If you told me that we could be more than friends  
Run with me baby, on a magic carpet ride  
Well live for tomorrow, everything I'll be alright  
Cause it don't matter what they say  
  
She's Bobby's girl, Johnny, you're playing with dynamite.  
She's Bobby's girl, close the door baby, it'll be alright  
Come on, lets go  
  
When they say she's Bobby's girl, Johnny, you're playing with dynamite  
She's Bobby's girl, close the door honey, it'll be alright now  
  
She's Bobby's girl, come on baby, come with me tonight  
She's Bobby's girl, close the door baby, it'll be alright now
