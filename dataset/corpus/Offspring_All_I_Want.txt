Day after day your home life's a wreck  
The powers that be just  
Breathe down your neck  
You get no respect  
  
You get no relief  
You gotta speak up  
And yell out your piece  
So back off your rules  
  
Back off your jive  
'Cause I'm sick of not living  
To stay alive  
Leave me alone  
  
I'm not asking a lot  
I just don't want to be controlled  
That's all I want  
All I want  
  
How many times is it gonna take  
'Til someone around you hears what you say  
You've tried being cool  
You feel like a lie  
  
You've played by their rules  
Now it's their turn to try  
So back off your rules  
Back off your jive  
  
'Cause I'm sick of not living  
To stay alive  
Leave me alone  
I'm not asking a lot  
  
I just don't want to be controlled  
That's all I want  
All I want  
I said it before  
  
I'll say it again  
If you could just listen  
Then it might make sense
