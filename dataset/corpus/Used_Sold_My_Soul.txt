I think about the worm that I've become,  
Left blind from the brightness of your halo.  
No one shines like you do.  
My filthy mouth and broken words,  
This small disease that leaves me crawling.  
Crawling to you.  
  
Crawl under ground for comfort,  
Stay close to the deck for keep from falling.  
From falling.  
  
Sold my life to bring the rain, maybe to wash me clean.  
Sold my soul to stop the pain,  
Hoping you'd set me free.  
All your pills, are you sane?  
You never took it, lay it all on me.  
You can lay it all on me.  
  
I took every chance to lash my tongue,  
You wear these scabs just like an angel.  
There's something about you.  
Whole rip of things I've done,  
Seems like this disease is slowly spreading.  
Start running, what would you do?  
  
I crawl under ground for comfort,  
Stay out of my mind to keep from dying.  
From Dying.  
  
Sold my life to bring the rain,  
Maybe to wash me clean.  
Sold my soul to stop the pain,  
Hoping you'd set me free.  
All your pills, are you sane?  
You never took it, lay it all on me.  
You can lay it all on me.  
  
Could you forget that what I said?,  
And how I died inside my head.  
We're starting over, not pretending  
That the best is dead.  
Under pain you feel you're old,  
And times I should have known.  
Don't keep it inside, let it out and let it all on me.  
  
Sold my life to bring the rain,  
Maybe to wash me clean.  
Sold my soul to stop the pain,  
Hoping you'd set me free.  
All your pills, all the pain.  
You never took it, lay it all on me.  
You can lay it all on me.
