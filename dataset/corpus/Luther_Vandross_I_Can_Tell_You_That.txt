One day I'll always remember  
Was when you walked into my life  
It was a very special night  
When we danced so close, so tender  
It gave my heart the second chance  
That I'd been waiting for  
  
But our love is falling  
All kinds of pressure has temptation calling  
It gives me fever  
But no matter what, I ain't gonna leave you  
I'm gonna stay till the last day  
Worry no more, what is love for?  
I hear love knocking honey  
Come on, let's open the door  
  
You know you've got me to love  
I can tell you that  
If you should ever need some love  
You just call me back  
I've been loving you from the start  
Let me tell you that  
And I'll keep loving you from my heart  
Sure can tell you that  
You've got so much to love  
  
Every time that we kiss  
I'm reminded it's you I miss  
I just love when we love like this  
I can tell you that  
Please forgive me if I pout  
But my world would turn inside out  
If on leaving me you insist  
Let me tell you that  
  
I start to hold you but you pull back,  
not much just a little  
I can't control you  
When you get so caught up in the middle  
First you say yes, then you say no  
Said you're gonna stay, now you're gonna go  
You know I'll tell you honey  
But I think you already know  
  
I can tell you this  
Anytime you go I really miss you  
Nothing to do, tired of my friends  
Won't you come back and love me again?  
So I can tell you that  
You've got me forever girl to love
