Mutha, don't wanna go to school today  
I think I'd rather go outside and play  
  
They keep calling asking me  
If I'll come in  
Is that a sin  
If being lazy is the only reason  
  
It's getting late  
So, mutha don't you hesitate  
To pack my lunch  
And I'll be on my way to school  
  
Mutha, don't wanna go to school today  
I think I'd rather go outside and play  
  
Mutha, don't wanna go to school today  
I think I'd rather go outside and play  
  
The teacher's always looking down  
With her disappointed frown  
Asking me to go sleep somewhere else  
  
My levelheaded mutha  
Always said to one another  
That the truth will always hurt  
If you keep waiting  
I said waiting
