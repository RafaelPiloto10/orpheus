We try hard to hold on too  
You lost your patience and I lost my mind  
Now you asked me would I go through it  
If you came back one more time.  
  
It'll be a cold day in December  
It'll be a hot day in mid July  
Or a cool night in late September  
Before I give our love another try.  
  
Just as sure as California  
Has a white Atlantic shore  
And a long eastern sunset  
I won't want you for anymore.  
  
It'll be a cold day in December  
It'll be a hot day in mid July  
Or a cool night in late September  
Before I give our love another try.  
  
There will be icebergs in the arctic ocean  
There will be seashells in the Florida pan  
And an old heart with in me beatin'  
Before I ever take you back again.  
  
It'll be a cold day in December  
It'll be a hot day in mid July  
Or a cool night in late September  
Before I give our love another try
