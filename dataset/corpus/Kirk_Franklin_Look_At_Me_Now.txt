Persecuted, criticized, been denied and abandoned  
Pushed away, given away, some days I couldn?t imagine  
Getting harder, getting colder, was hard for me to see  
Tired of runnin?, tired of hurtin?, even got tired of me  
Tired of cryin?, tired of tryin? to forget my mistakes  
Tired of bein? in this storm, how much more can I take  
Many nights in my life, tell me why  
I shed more tears, my eyes would allow  
And after all that  
  
(Chorus)  
Look at me now!  
I?m stronger this time around!  
Not because I was so good, but somehow  
You looked past where I was  
And you knew I?d come through cause You loved me  
Look at me know!  
So many didn?t make it through  
That?s why this heart belongs to only You!  
How can I complain ?bout the pain I went through  
Cause it grew me  
Look at me now!  
  
Had no hope, had no future, even too hard to dream  
No one told me, ?boy, you can be whatever you want to be?  
Then You saved me and You gave me reason to breathe again  
Not perfect, ya?ll, but I?m gon? run ?til I make it to the end  
(It ain?t easy when your life?s filled with wounds that won?t heal)  
And you fight through the lies trying to find what?s for real  
Everyone wants the prize but they can?t stand the pain  
The strength I needed it came that night I cried out Your name  
To my people in the struggle, all my soldiers and believers  
To my survivors of Rita, Katrina and even FEMA!  
(All things are working together for our good)  
  
(Chorus)  
Look at me now!  
I?m stronger this time around!  
Not because I was so good, but somehow  
You looked past where I was  
And you knew I?d come through cause You loved me  
Look at me know!  
So many didn?t make it through  
That?s why this heart belongs to only You!  
How can I complain ?bout the pain I went through  
Cause it grew me  
Look at me now!  
  
(Bridge)  
Yes, I?ve seen some hard times  
Some bad choices that I?ve made fell back on me  
But now it?s time to move on, move on  
Can?t let my past hold down my destiny  
And even though I don?t always know  
Why you allow the night to last so long  
But when I see the sunlight  
It was only to make me strong  
  
Look at me?  
Look at me?  
Look at me?  
Look at me, look at me  
  
(Chorus)  
Look at me now!  
I?m stronger this time around!  
Not because I was so good, but somehow  
You looked past where I was  
And you knew I?d come through cause You loved me  
Look at me know!  
So many didn?t make it through  
That?s why this heart belongs to only You!  
How can I complain ?bout the pain I went through  
Cause it grew me  
Look at me now!  
  
I?m better now! I?m closer now!  
I?m thankful now! I?m happy now!  
Look at me! Look at me!  
I?m stronger now! I?m patient now!  
I?m grateful now! I?ll praise you now!  
Look at me! Look at me!
