I was staring through a telescope at night  
At a large light in the sky  
Its spinning lights reminded me of you  
A star spinning in orbit  
Lighting up the sky  
Or maybe it was not a star at all  
  
I was standing by the hudson river's edge at night  
Looking out across the Jersey shore  
At a neon light spelling out some cola's name  
And I thought your name should be dancing  
Beamed from satellites  
Larger than any billboard in Time's Square  
  
Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid  
I'm the one who loves you in each and every way  
Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid  
N.Y.C. lovers  
Tell it to your heart  
(Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid  
Tell it to your heart)  
(Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid  
Tell it to your heart)  
  
I'm on the roof, it's 5 a.m.  
I guess I couldn't sleep  
And I see this spinning light that I saw last week  
Maybe I should wake you up  
But by then it might be gone  
You never know what you see when if you look up in the sky  
  
I ran outside down a darkened street  
Listening to my boot heels click  
My leather jacket squeaked I needed a cigarette  
When I turned the corner  
My spinning light was in the street  
They were filming a commercial on T.V.  
  
Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid  
We're no teenage movie that ends in tragedy  
Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid  
N.Y.C. lovers  
Tell it to your heart [Repeat x 3]  
  
(Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid  
Tell it to your heart)  
[Repeat x 2]
