Take the way home that leads back to Sullivan St.  
Cross the water and home through the town  
Past the shadows that fall down wherever we meet  
Pretty soon I won't come around  
  
I'm almost drowning in her sea  
She's nearly fallen to her knees  
  
Take the way home that leads back to Sullivan St.  
Where all the bodies hang on the air  
If she remembers, she hides it whenever we meet  
Either way now, I don't really care  
  
I'm almost drowning in her seas  
She's nearly crawling on her knees  
She's down on her knees  
  
Take the way home that leads back to Sullivan St.  
I'm just another rider burned to the ground  
  
I'm almost drowning in her sea  
She's nearly crawling on her knees  
It's almost everything I need  
I'm down on my knees  
I'm down on my knees
