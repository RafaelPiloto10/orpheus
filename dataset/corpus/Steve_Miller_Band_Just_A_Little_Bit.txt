I don't want much  
I just want a little bit  
No I don't want it all  
I just want a little bit  
Just an eeny-weeny bit  
Just a teeny-weeny bit of your love  
  
Turn your lamp down low  
Now honey won't you slip me a kiss  
Turn your lamp down low  
Babe you know I can't resist  
From an eeny-weeny bit  
Just a teeny-weeny bit of your love  
  
I want you forever  
Not just for peace of mind  
Please say you'll never leave me  
Not until the end of time  
From an eeny-weeny bit  
Just a teeny-weeny bit of your love  
  
Turn your lamp down low  
Now honey won't you slip me a kiss  
Turn your lamp down low  
Babe you know I can't resist  
From an eeny-weeny bit  
Just a teeny-weeny bit of your love  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
From just a teeny-weeny bit  
Just an eeny-weeny bit of your love
