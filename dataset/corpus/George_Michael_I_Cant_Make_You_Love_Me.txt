Turn down the lights, turn down the bed  
Turn down these voices inside my head  
Lay down with me, tell me no lies  
Just hold me close, don't patronize  
Don't patronize me  
  
'Cause I can't make you love me If you don't  
You can't make your heart feel something it won't  
Here in the dark in these final hours  
I will lay down my heart, and I'll feel the power  
But you won't, no you won't  
And I can't make you love me  
If you don't  
  
I'll close my eyes and then I won't see  
The love you do not feel, when you're holding me  
Morning will come, and I'll do what's right  
Just give me till then, to give up this fight  
And I will give up this fight  
  
And I can't make you love me if you don't  
You can't make your heart feel something it won't  
And here in the dark in these final hours  
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power  
But you won't, no, you won't  
And I can't make you love me  
If you don't  
  
Ain't no use in you trying  
It's no good for me baby without love  
All my tears, all these years, everything I believed in  
Baby  
Oh yeah  
Someone's gonna love me
