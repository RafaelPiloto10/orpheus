The sky is crying,  
Can you see the tears roll down the street.  
The sky is crying,  
Can you see the tears roll down the street.  
I've been looking for my baby  
And I've been wondering where can she be  
  
I saw my baby early one morning  
She was walking on down the street  
I saw my baby early one morning  
She was walking on down the street  
You know it hurt me, hurt me so bad  
It made my poor heart skip a beat  
  
I got a real, real fine feeling  
That my baby she don't love me no more  
I got a real, real fine feeling  
That my baby she don't love me no more  
You know the sky's been crying  
Can see you see the tears roll down my door
