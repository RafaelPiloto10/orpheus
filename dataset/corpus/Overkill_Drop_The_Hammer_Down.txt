Hold your feet to the fire  
Hold your face to the ground  
Hold on tight, you're a target baby  
Drop the hammer down  
I'm a long life, loving hate  
I'm a bomb that makes no sound  
Could you please, would you loosen these  
I'm about to fucking drown  
  
Lowdown and overloaded, keeping you alive  
I see that you've exploded  
On the other side  
Lowdown and lowdown, kicking it around  
I see that you've exploded  
Drop the hammer down  
  
In a mock execution  
In a house of gag and bound  
Not the best solution  
Drop the hammer down  
I'm a long life, hating love  
I'm under my dirt mound  
If you could stand where we stood  
We're not fucking around  
  
Let's hear it for the black and blue  
For the tortured soul, for the battered crew  
Three cheers for the black and blue  
Raise a glass to the beaten down  
To their dignity and bloodless frown  
Three cheers for the beaten down  
  
Drop dead dreams in a deep, dirt ditch  
Buried by a shovel hand  
Dead screams from the son of a bitch  
Coming out to beat the band  
Oh baby how I love your bite  
Turn my smile upside down  
Oh baby how I hate your light  
As you drop the hammer down
