Chorus:  
I betcha I  
Betcha I can  
Betcha I can love  
Betcha I can love ya  
Betcha I can love you like you've never been loved before  
  
Betcha I, Betcha I, Betcha I (2x)  
  
I betcha I can woo ya  
Betcha I can do ya  
Betcha I can do you till you're dead and done  
Betcha I can love ya  
Betcha I can hold ya  
So doncha know that I'm the only one  
Betcha I can love you like you've never been loved before  
  
I betcha I can feed ya  
Betcha I can bleed ya  
And make you think you're havin' fun  
Betcha I can choose ya  
Betcha I can lose ya  
I betcha I can drop you like a smokin' gun  
  
Betcha I can tease ya  
Betcha I can freeze ya  
Betcha I can warm you like the mornin' sun  
Betcha I can flirt ya  
Betcha I can hurt ya  
Betcha I can do ya till you're dead and done  
Betcha I can love you like you've never been loved before  
  
Chorus  
  
I betcha I can hold you  
Betcha I can mold you  
Betcha I can take you or leave you alone  
Betcha I can kiss you  
Don't you know that I can dismiss you  
And you're dismissed now  
Like a rolling stone  
And how does it feel?  
  
Betcha I can love you like you've never been loved before
