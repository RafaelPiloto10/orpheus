I never wanted another  
Come over to me and discover  
How I want to be near you  
And you need to be far away  
You always seem to make me feel at home  
Hey you  
  
People like  
I never knew, I never knew, I never knew why  
You make me wanna cry  
I never knew, I never knew, I never knew why  
Forever live and die  
  
I look at all of the people  
Doing it over and over  
You never get any older  
I wish that you could be here  
I look at you and I  
Make the same mistakes  
Hey you  
  
People like  
I never knew, I never knew, I never knew why  
You make me wanna cry  
I never knew, I never knew, I never knew why  
Forever live and die  
  
I never knew, I never knew, I never knew why  
You make me wanna cry  
I never knew, I never knew, I never knew why  
Forever live and die  
  
Repeat to fade
