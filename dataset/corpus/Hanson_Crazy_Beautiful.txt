Liquid, melancholy dreams  
Tell me what it means  
'Cause you drive me crazy  
Driftwood, won't you float me down your stream?  
Tell me what it means  
  
'Cause you drive me crazy  
'Cause you're crazy beautiful  
'Cause you're crazy beautiful  
'Cause you're crazy beautiful  
  
Don't go looking in my eyes tonight  
Don't go telling me lies tonight  
Don't go promising the skies tonight  
When you're crazy  
'Cause you're crazy beautiful  
'Cause you're crazy beautiful  
  
Listen, all I need is you  
Won't you tell me what to do?  
'Cause you drive me crazy  
Baby, is it pulling on your heart?  
Is it tearing you apart?  
  
'Cause you drive me crazy  
'Cause you're crazy beautiful  
'Cause you're crazy beautiful  
  
Don't go looking in my eyes tonight  
Don't go telling me lies tonight  
Don't go promising the skies tonight  
When you're crazy  
'Cause you're crazy beautiful  
'Cause you're crazy beautiful  
'Cause you're crazy beautiful  
  
If you don't need me, I think I'll go  
If you don't want me, tell me no  
If you don't need me, I think I'll go  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
Don't go looking in my eyes tonight  
Don't go telling me lies tonight  
Don't go promising the skies tonight  
When you're crazy  
'Cause you're crazy beautiful  
'Cause you're crazy beautiful  
'Cause you're crazy beautiful
