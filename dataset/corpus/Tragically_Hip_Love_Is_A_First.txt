I've been interpreted and shrunk  
I've been as touch less as a drunk  
  
This is as bad as or worse  
As bad as or worse  
This is as bad as or worse  
As bad as or worse  
  
Love is a curse  
Be her world, all it deserves  
Love is a curse  
Get what you can not desert  
  
I know, I know it's all just first blurts  
That he who would try to own deserves it  
And I know it's got nothing to do with deserves it  
Just that you don't just blurt  
  
Love is a curse  
Love is a curse  
Love is a curse  
You don't just blurt  
Love is a curse  
  
Though I've been too weak to escape  
And I don't have the strength to pluck a grape  
  
Though it's as bad as or worse  
As bad as or worse  
Though it's as bad as or worse  
As bad as or worse  
  
Love is a first  
Felt the dull fangs of the truth  
Love is a first  
Their music they torture to  
Love is a first  
A song would power it first  
Love is a first  
Let's walk down the darkness's horse  
  
We were frozen until he saw us  
And smoke and murder fell on the floor  
And watch the own death of your TV  
And dreams are stuck in urgent tweeds  
Drain the ocean of words  
Like God's representatives on earth  
Learn to hurt and how not to hurt  
And the thing you taught me and what I learned  
Love is a first  
  
And it's as bad as or worse  
Love is a first  
As bad as or worse  
Love is a first  
As bad as or worse  
Love is a first  
As bad as or worse  
  
Love is a curse  
Be her world, all it deserves  
Love is a first  
Go where the curtain occurs  
Love is a curse  
Get what you can't not desert  
Love is a first  
It just occurs and a occurs  
  
We were frozen until he saw us  
And smoke and murder fell on the floor  
And watch the own death of your TV  
And dreams are stuck in urgent tweads  
Drain the ocean of words  
Like God's representatives on earth  
Learn to hurt and how not to hurt  
And the thing you taught me and what I learned  
Love is a first
