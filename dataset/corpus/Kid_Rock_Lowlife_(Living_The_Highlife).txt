I got my Cat Scratch Fever eight-track  
My best friend's in a gun rack  
I'm a lowlife  
I owe everybody money  
I think racist jokes are funny  
I'm a lowlife  
I got a dirty mind, a gutter mouth  
I'm makin' time, I'm goin' out  
With your wife  
  
'Cause I'm a lowlife  
I'm a lowlife  
  
I got kids I never seen  
And their momma's seventeen  
I'm a lowlife  
I take strippers out to breakfast  
You can add that to my checklist  
I'm a lowlife  
Ahh the landlord called the rent is due  
I spent it all on a Kiss tattoo  
I Rock n Roll all night  
  
'Cause I'm a lowlife  
I'm a lowlife  
I'm a lowlife  
Livin' the highlife  
  
I'm watchin' porno on the TV  
Wonderin' why she'd ever leave me  
I'm a lowlife  
The object of my affection  
Asked the police for protection  
I'm a lowlife  
The romance is gone, I'm doin' fine  
Me and your mom had a real good time  
Just last night  
  
'Cause I'm a lowlife  
I'm a lowlife  
  
I make black music for the white man  
Keep cocaine upon my nightstand  
I'm a lowlife  
Ain't never hung out in the Catskills  
But I've been to jail in Nashville  
I'm a lowlife  
I've got a dirty mind, a gutter mouth  
I'm makin' time, I'm goin' out  
With your wife  
  
I'm a lowlife  
I'm a lowlife  
I'm a lowlife  
Livin' the highlife
