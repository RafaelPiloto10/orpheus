I was a fool to care,  
I was a fool to care,  
I was a fool to care,  
But I don't care even  
If I was a fool  
I'm still in love with you.  
Had I listened to the grapevine,  
I might have had my doubts.  
But I did my level best  
Just to block them out.  
Cause love is so unwise  
And love has no eyes,  
And it took a while  
For a fool to see  
What his friends were on about.  
  
I was a fool to care,  
I was a fool to care,  
I was a fool to care,  
But I don't care even  
If I was a fool  
I'm still in love with you.  
Imagining your face,  
It almost fills  
The empty space before me.  
I can see your eyes  
And almost hear your lovely lies.  
  
I wish I was an old man  
And love was through with me.  
I wish I was a baby on my mama's knee.  
I wish I was a freight train  
Moving down the line,  
Just keeping track of time  
Without all these memories  
  
I was a fool to care,  
I was a fool to care,  
I was a fool to care,  
But I don't care even  
If I was a fool  
I'm still in love with you, babe, yes, I am.  
I could have opened my eyes,  
I could have seen through your lies,  
I could have stood for no more,  
I could have walked out the door.  
  
But I was a fool to care,  
I was a fool to care.  
But I was a fool to care,  
I was a fool to care.  
You weren't nothing but a fool to care,  
Just a country fool to care.  
You weren't nothing but a fool to care,  
Just a country fool to care.
