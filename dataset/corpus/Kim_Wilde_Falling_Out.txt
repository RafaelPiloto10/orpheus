What can I say now after all is said and done  
You cut me up in pieces when the shooting first begun  
What did I do to you to make you turn away  
'cause now there's nothing left for me  
There's nothing I can say  
  
Now it's too late you feeling sorry  
You'll never change  
And there's nothing you can do about it  
  
Falling out - why did you do it to me, yeah  
Falling out - cutting me up into pieces  
Falling out - you know that you upset me, yeah  
Falling out - you know that I'm so hurt baby  
  
You said you loved me, I believed you for a while  
You sure could fool the angels  
When you use that painted smile  
I should have known that it was too good to be true  
But now that it's all over, you know I won't forget you  
  
Now it's too late you feeling sorry  
You'll never change  
And there's nothing you can do about it  
  
Falling out - why did you do it to me, yeah  
Falling out - cutting me up into pieces  
Falling out - you know that you upset me, yeah  
Falling out - you know that I'm so hurt baby  
  
So now it's over and there's nothing left to say  
The flame that burned within my heart  
Now slowly fades away  
So don't you ever think of knocking at my door  
Just turn the light out, close your eyes  
And think of me no more  
  
And it's too late to say you're sorry  
You'll never change  
And there's nothing you can do about it  
  
Falling out - why did you do it to me, yeah  
Falling out - cutting me up into pieces  
Falling out - you know that you upset me, yeah  
Falling out - you know that I'm so hurt baby
