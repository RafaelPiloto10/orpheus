Go on and admit it  
You can't take it anymore  
So why don't you quit it  
Your scratching off again  
Can't you see it  
Well the whole thing was such a surprise  
I know you and your hear crazy notions  
Your pretty girls and no devotions  
Down by the ocean middle class  
Down by the gulf side, you let it all slide  
But now your saying that you don't  
Wanna be a sixteen year old girl, aah  
But you don't want to turn twenty-five  
You never ever, you never ever lied,  
Where you been, aahh  
You got to survive to keep yourself alive,  
Yeah-ah, yeah  
It ain't no big deal if your attitude is wrong  
And you don't know how you feel  
You just cop someone else's ideas  
And masturbate yourself, make them your own  
Well I, I don't mean to tell you what to do  
Cause I've scratched off myself a time or two  
Well it just leaves you blue, with nothing to do  
And they think I'm crazy when I stay up all weekend  
But now your saying that you don't  
Wanna be a sixteen year old girl, oh yeah, aah  
But you don't want to turn twenty-five  
You never ever, you never ever lied  
Where you been, aahh  
You got to survive to keep yourself alive  
Yeah-ah, my na na no, yeah  
So if I'm walking down the street and you see me  
Don't walk on by, say hey man  
You know your looking, your looking so fine  
You don't have to mean it, no no  
Its just one of the regular lies that we've lived with  
And this is a love song and  
I'm writing it just to survive
