Caroline is falling in and out of love  
Try'n' to get those things that she's been thinkin' of  
She can't be what she wants to be  
Though she never really tries  
She's a liar  
She's a liar  
But I might try her tonight  
And if things go right  
Caroline is calling everyone in town  
First she calls them friends and then she puts them down  
She can't be what she wants to be  
Though she never really tries  
She's a liar  
She's a liar  
But I might try her tonight  
And if things go right  
She can't be what she wants to be  
Though she never really tries  
She's a liar  
She's a liar  
But I might try her tonight  
And if things go right  
Wo, she's a liar (She's a liar)  
She's a liar (She's a liar)  
She's a liar (She's a liar)  
She's a liar (She's a liar)  
She's a liar (She's a liar)
