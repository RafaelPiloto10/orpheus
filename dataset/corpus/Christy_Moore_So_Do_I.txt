This is the day the fisherman likes  
And so do I  
When the rain puts a shine on the chestnut spikes  
Hear the curlews cry  
The nightingale sings her best  
We'll drink a pint in hamiltons rest  
And the girl i love wore a muslin dress  
The fisherman dream of the sun in the west  
And so do I  
And so do I  
Now i can see  
Since the girl i love dearly  
Has cast her loving spell on me  
Thiis is the day the cuckoo likes  
And so do I  
When the hills fall down in different shapes  
And the swallows fly  
To a hidden beach where boats can't go  
Mountain rivers overflow  
I hear the squelin' of the seagulls  
As off home they go  
And so do I  
And so do I  
Now i can see  
Since the girl i love dearly  
Has cast her loving spell on me  
I'll cross the seven oceans  
Forever more i'll wander  
Till she has cast her loving spell on me  
This is the day the fisherman likes  
And so do I  
When the rain puts a shine on the chestnut spikes  
Hear the curlews cry  
The nightingale sings her best  
We'll drink a pint in hamiltons rest  
And the girl i love wore a muslin dress  
The fishermen dream of the sum in the west  
And so do I  
And so do I  
And so do I  
And so do I
