(Glen Sharrock)  
It took a long time  
But now I'm gonna be laughing  
A very long time  
When all I could feel was sad  
A very long time  
But now it's gonna be worth it  
Cause I just found a friend to make me glad  
I'm feeling food, feeling better  
I'm feeling best  
I feel a cut above the rest  
I'm gonna put it to the test  
Feeling good, feeling better  
Feeling best  
Feeling good, feeling better  
I'm feeling best  
I hope it doesn't sound like I'm blowing my own trumpet  
Cause all I wanna do is join up with the band  
When you feel good  
You gotta come right out and say it  
I've been so long at sea and I've just seen land  
I'm feeling food, feeling better  
I'm feeling best  
I feel a cut above the rest  
I'm gonna put it to the test  
Feeling good, feeling better  
Feeling best  
Feeling good, feeling better  
I'm feeling best
