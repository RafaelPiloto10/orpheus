Can you tell me where I might find the Hydra?  
Is he wearing a familiar face?  
Does he still live below Seventh Avenue  
With the princess dipped in lace?  
Does he know that I'm a soldier of fortune  
And not a victim of circumstance?  
We drew lots for his soft underbelly  
Now his fate is sealed with my lance  
I can tell by the look in your eye  
You've never seen the man with nothing to say  
I can tell by the look in your eye  
You'd better watch yourself, St. George is on his way  
Is it true that he's a mighty warrior  
And a viper of the first degree?  
I've been sentenced here to slay the giant  
Geld this fear I cannot see  
I can tell by the look in your eye  
You've never seen the man with nothing to say  
I can tell by the look in your eye  
You'd better watch yourself, St. George is on his way  
Can you tell me where I might find the Hydra?  
Is he wearing a familiar face?  
Does he still live below Seventh Avenue  
In the slums of Satan's grace?  
I can tell by the look in your eye  
You've never seen the man with nothing to say  
I can tell by the look in your eye  
You'd better watch yourself, St. George is on his way  
I can tell by the look in your eye  
You've never seen the man with nothing to say  
I can tell by the look in your eye  
You'd better watch yourself, St. George is on his way  
I can tell by the, I can tell by the  
I can tell by the, I can tell by the  
I can tell by the, I can tell by the  
I can tell by the look in your eye
