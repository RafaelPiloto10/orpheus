I used to be the man for you,  
Did everything you wanted me to,  
So, tell me, baby,  
What did I do wrong  
  
I told you what you wanted to know,  
Precious secrets never spoken before.  
All I'm asking,  
Where did I go wrong  
  
Some things are better left unsaid,  
But, all I do is cry instead,  
Now, I've cried me a river,  
Thinking how it used to be  
  
There've been too many tears falling,  
And there've been too many hearts  
Breaking in two.  
Remember what we had together,  
Believing it would last forever.  
So, tell me, baby,  
Where did I go wrong  
  
Everything I had was yours,  
More than I have ever given before,  
So, won't you tell me  
Did I hurt you so bad  
  
I guess I'm fooling myself,  
'Cause I want you and no one else.  
And I can't understand  
Why you're doing these things to me  
  
There've been too many tears falling,  
And there've been too many hearts  
Breaking in two  
Remember what we had together,  
Believing it would last forever.  
So, tell me, baby,  
Where did I go wrong, where did I go wrong  
  
Now my heart is breaking,  
My whole world is shaking,  
'Cause I can't understand  
Why you're doing these things to me  
  
There've been too many tears falling,  
And there've been too many hearts  
Breaking in two  
Remember what we had together,  
Believing it would last forever  
So, tell me, baby,  
  
Where did I go wrong
