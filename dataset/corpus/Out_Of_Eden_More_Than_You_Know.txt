I know you walk around this life without hope  
Just tryin' to figure out a way you can cope, well  
You do so many things to escape your fears  
That you will never make it  
You'll always have to fake being happy  
I know the truth you can believe it or not  
There's a way out of this way of living  
But your trust must be giving willingly  
Someone to rescue you from all your disgrace  
Who will show you all his mercy, love and grace  
More than you know  
More than you could ever dream  
There's so much more  
Waiting for you than it seems if you'll only believe  
I know you wonder what your life's all about  
When it comes to your future, you have your doubts  
There's only one who can make you feel secure  
Who will lead you through this life  
Where you'll spend eternity you can be sure  
You think the only heaven you'll ever know  
Is the little bit of blue sky you see when your troubles  
Seem to go for a little while  
There's a lasting pleasure, a fuller measure of joy and peace  
When you look inside and know you've been set free  
More than you know  
More than you could ever dream  
There's so much more  
Waiting for you than it seems if you'll only believe  
You think the only heaven you'll ever know  
Is the little bit of blue sky you see when your troubles  
Seem to go for a little while  
There's a lasting pleasure, a fuller measure of joy and peace  
When you look inside and know you've been set free, free  
More than you know  
More than you could ever dream  
There's so much more  
Waiting for you than it seems if you'll only believe  
More than you know  
More than you could ever dream  
There's so much more  
Waiting for you  
If you just let it go  
If you just let it go  
It's waiting just for you  
If you open up your eyes  
If you realize, it's waitin' for you
