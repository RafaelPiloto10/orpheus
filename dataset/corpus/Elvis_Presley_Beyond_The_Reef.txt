Beyond the reef where the sea is dark and cold  
My love has gone from me and my dreams grow cold  
There'll be no tears, there'll be no regretting  
Will she remember me, will she forget?  
  
I'll send a thousand flowers  
Where the trade winds blow  
I'll send my lonely heart for I love her so  
Some day I know, she'll come back again to me  
Till then my heart will be beyond the reef  
  
I'll send a thousand flowers  
Where the trade winds blow  
I'll send my lonely heart for I love her so  
Some day I know, she'll come back again to me  
'Til then my heart will be beyond the reef  
  
'Til then my heart will be beyond the reef
