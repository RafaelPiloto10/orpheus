Day after day I must face a world of strangers  
Where I don't belong,  
I'm not that strong  
It's nice to know that there's someone I can turn to  
Who will always care  
You're always there  
  
When there's no getting over that rainbow  
When my small list of dreams won't come true  
I can take all the madness the world has to give  
But I won't last a day without you  
  
So many times when the city seems to be  
Without a friendly face,  
A lonely place  
It's nice to know that you'll be there if I need you  
And you always smile  
It's all worth while  
  
When there's no getting over that rainbow  
When my small list of dreams won't come true  
I can take all the madness the world has to give  
But I won't last a day without you  
  
Touch me and I end up singing  
Troubles seem to up and disappear  
You touch me with the love you're bringin'  
I can't really lose when you're near  
When you're near my love  
If all my friends have forgotten all their promises  
They're not unkind,  
Just hard to find  
One look at you and I know that  
I could learn to live without the rest  
I found the best  
  
When there's no getting over that rainbow  
When my small list of dreams won't come true  
I can take all the madness the world has to give  
But I won't last a day without you  
  
When there's no getting over that rainbow  
When my small list of dreams won't come true  
I can take all the madness the world has to give  
But I won't last a day...
