He wears his heart  
Safety pinned to his backpack  
His backpack is all that he knows  
Shot down by strangers  
Whose glances can cripple  
The heart and devour the soul  
  
All alone he turns to stone  
While holding his breath half to death  
Terrified of what's inside  
To save his life he crawls  
Like a worm from a bird  
Crawls like a worm from a bird  
  
Out of his mind, the weight  
Pushes him whispering  
Must have been out of his mind  
Mid-day delusions of pushing this out of his head  
Maybe out of his mind  
  
All alone he turns to stone  
While holding his breath half to death  
Terrified of what's inside  
To save his life he  
Crawls like a worm, crawls like a worm from a bird  
Crawls like a worm from a bird  
Crawls like a worm from a bird  
Crawls like a worm, crawls like a worm from a bird  
  
All he knows  
If he can't relieve it it grows  
And so it goes  
He crawls like a worm  
Crawls like a worm from a bird  
  
Out of his mind, the weight  
Pushes him whispering  
Must have been out of his mind  
  
All alone he turns to stone  
While holding his breath half to death  
Terrified of what's inside  
To save his life  
He crawls like a worm from a bird  
All alone he  
Holding his breath half to death  
Terrified to save his life  
He crawls like a worm, crawls like a worm  
Crawls like a worm from a bird  
Crawls like a worm from a bird  
Crawls like a worm from a bird  
Crawls like a worm from a bird  
Crawls like a worm, crawls like a worm  
Crawls like a worm from a bird
