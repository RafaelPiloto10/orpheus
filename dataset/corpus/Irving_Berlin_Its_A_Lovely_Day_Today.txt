It's a lovely day today  
So whatever you've got to do  
You've got a lovely day to do it in, that's true  
  
And I hope whatever you've got to do  
Is something that can be done by two  
For I'd really like to stay  
  
It's a lovely day today  
And whatever you've got to do  
I'd be so happy to be doing it with you  
  
But if you've got something that must be done  
And it can only be done by one  
There is nothing more to say  
Except it's a lovely day for saying  
It's a lovely day

It's a lovely day today  
And whatever I've got to do  
I've got a lovely day to do it in, that's true  
  
But perhaps whatever I've got to do  
Is something that can be done by two  
If it is then you could stay  
  
It's a lovely day today  
But you're probably busy too  
So I suppose there's nothing we can do  
  
For if you've got something that must be done  
And it can only be done by one  
There is nothing more to say  
Except it's a lovely day for saying  
It's a lovely day  
  
[3]  
It's a lovely day today  
If you've something that must get done  
Now don't forget two heads are better than just one  
  
And besides I'm certain if you knew me  
You'd find I'm very good company  
Won't you kindly let me stay?

It's a lovely day today  
And whatever we've got to do  
We've got a lovely day to do it in, that's true  
  
And I know whatever we've got to do  
Is something that can be done by two  
  
I'll say it's a lovely day for saying  
It's a lovely day
