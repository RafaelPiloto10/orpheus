He was the wizard of a thousand kings  
And I chanced to meet him one night wandering  
He told me tales, and he drank my wine  
Me and my magic man kinda feelin' fine  
  
He had a cloak of gold and eyes of fire  
And as he spoke, I felt a deep desire  
To free the world from it's fear and pain  
And help the people to feel free again  
  
Why don't we listen to the voices in our hearts  
'Cause then I know we'd find that we're not so far apart  
Everybody's got to be happy, everyone should sing  
For we know the joy of life, the peace that love can bring  
  
So spoke the wizard in his mountain home  
The vision of his wisdom means we'll never be alone  
And I will dream of my magic night  
And the million silver stars that guide me with their light
