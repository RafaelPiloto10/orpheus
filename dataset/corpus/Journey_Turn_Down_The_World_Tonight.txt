Caught up in living  
Getting through each day  
When all the tomorrows become faded yesterdays  
Are you slipping away  
Lighted by our schedules  
Rushing here and there  
Become strangers to each other  
Miss you everywhere  
How did we get this way  
When the loneliness becomes too much to bear  
Girl, this merry-go-round  
Tell each other we still care  
Help me turn down the world tonight  
Take a quiet moment, somewhere we can unwind  
Losing touch, we forget to take time  
To share what's in our hearts  
Speak what's on our minds  
In the silence, hear your heart beat next to mine  
Baby, help me turn down the world tonight  
So much information streaming at us fast  
What I really need to know is if  
We can make it last  
I wanna keep you close  
We make commitments  
Take responsibility  
Why do we let them come between you and me  
That's when I miss you most  
We gotta take this night  
Throw in our love all the way  
Before our moment is gone  
Baby, say it's not too late  
Help me turn down the world tonight  
Take a quiet moment, somewhere we can unwind  
Losing touch, we forget to take time  
To share what's in our hearts  
Speak what's on our minds  
Far beyond those, with your body next to mine  
Won't you help me turn down the world tonight  
Turn down the world tonight  
Help me turn down the world tonight  
Take a quiet moment, somewhere we can unwind  
Losing touch, we forget to take time  
To share what's in our hearts  
Speak what's on our minds  
Oh, turn down the world  
Help me turn down the world tonight  
In the silence, hear your heart beat next to mine  
Baby, help me turn down the world tonight
