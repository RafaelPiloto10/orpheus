Crazy little child  
Never got to see  
All the pretty things in life  
Had him put away  
Nothing they could say  
Could ever make the pieces fit  
  
Aw well, Daddy-o was rich  
Mama was a bitch  
Living wasn't easy in between  
Behind his silent scream  
Jackson in his teens  
Was planning his escape  
  
He was a crazy little child  
New Orleans Alley playground  
Grimy faced  
He watched the hookers cry  
Winos were his friends  
And when he talked to them  
They said, "Jackson, boy, they'll get you by and by"  
  
Depression settin' in  
Desp'rate, cool and quick  
Jackson learned the ropes out on the street  
Little candy stores  
Just pickin' locks and doors  
Was practice for a two bit petty thief  
  
So Jackson went to Ritz  
And ev'ryone was hip  
Ritz ran all the rackets there in town  
If you need another boy  
A trigger or a blade  
Well, I'm the slickest cat around  
  
Yeah, Ritz gave him the eye  
Once over, then he smiled  
"Yeah, I've got something here in mind  
If you meet me here at two  
I think you'll like the view  
Of that long green when you crack that safe tonight"  
  
He was a crazy little child  
New Orleans Alley playground  
And grimy faced  
He watched the hookers cry, whoo  
Winos were his friends  
And when he talked to them  
They said, "Jackson, boy, they'll get you by and by," that's right  
  
Well, I'll wait for you outside  
And I'll be your ears and your eyes  
And boy, you just slip in there and bring out all that loot  
But Ritz was taken by surprise  
Couple of unspectin' guys  
And they left poor Jackson inside  
  
Questions there were few  
In fact there were none  
When those Sheriff's bullets start to fly  
Lay dying on the floor  
With a smokin' forty four  
He said, "I must admit the winos were right"  
  
Crazy little child  
Never got to see  
All the pretty things in life  
We buried him today  
Nothing we could say  
Could ever make the pieces fit  
  
Yeah, I must admit the winos were right  
Oh, I must admit the winos were right  
Yes, his last words were  
I must admit the winos we-ere ri-ight
