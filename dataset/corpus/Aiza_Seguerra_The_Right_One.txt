It's not the laughter  
It's not just the fun  
You've always touched my heart  
I know you're the one  
You're nothing less than a perfect friend to me  
Don't try to be like anyone else  
You don't have to be  
It's not the hours  
The times that we've spent  
A special moment like this  
Makes you know it's heaven sent  
You're nothing less than the right one for me  
Don't try to be like someone else  
You don't have to be  
You're the right one  
The right one for me  
We can be friends for life  
Good friends we'll always be  
No matter where life leads us  
We'll always have each other  
'Cause you're the right one  
The right one for me  
It's not the sweet song  
It isn't the dream  
It's just you my good friend  
And the love that you bring  
Throughout the seasons  
You're the one for me  
You're the one I love to love  
And you'll always be  
You're the right one  
The right one for me  
We can be friends for life  
Good friends we'll always be  
No matter where life leads us  
We'll always have each other  
'Cause you're the right one  
The right one for me  
'Cause you're the right one  
The right one for me  
The right one for me...  
You're the right one  
The right one for me  
We can be friends for life  
Good friends we'll always be  
No matter where life leads us  
We'll always have each other  
'Cause you're the right one  
The right one for me  
(No matter where life leads us  
We'll always have each other)  
'Cause you're the right one  
The right one for me  
(It's not the laughter  
It's not j
