You're my main man  
When you call my heart goes sailin'  
My feet refuse to touch the ground  
When you come around  
You're my main man  
That's what the neighborhood's been sayin'  
Even Mother knows your name  
I'll take your love and never be the same  
  
Oh, you're my main man  
I am your only woman  
Oh, you're my main man  
Forever  
  
You're my main man  
Paid the gypsy to keep prayin'  
I'll keep a candle lit for love  
And watch the street  
For you from up above  
  
Oh, you're my main man  
I am your only woman  
Oh, you're my main man  
Forever  
  
You're my main man  
When you call my heart goes sailin''  
I'll keep a candle lit for love  
And watch the street  
For you from up above  
  
Oh, you're my main man  
I am your only woman  
Oh, you're my main man  
Forever
