In the days of Noah before the Lord,  
When the wicked had all forgotten God  
Brother Noah, built a boat, which above  
God's wrath did float  
  
And the people saw that they were made of mud  
As the doors swang open and gang plank standing out.  
Noah and his family entered with a shout.  
As the scorners stretched their necks,  
  
Noah stepped out on the deck  
Saying, I'm so glad I'm on the inside looking out.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh I'd rather be on the inside looking out  
Than to be on the outside looking in  
When the rain began to fall, sinners on the  
Lord did call  
The door was shut and night was setting in.  
Then old Noah from the window looking out  
Gazed to heaven beyond the water spout.  
And he said I thank the Lord that I took Him  
at His word.  
I'm so glad I'm on the inside looking out.  
  
Good old Daniel lived in Babylon long ago  
And he had the grace to tell the devil no.  
Though he prayed three times a day in the  
Good old fashioned way.  
  
They said he, to the lions den must go.  
And lions made him welcomed to their home  
For they knew he was nothing but backbone  
When the king looked in and said, "Are you  
  
Alive or are you dead?"  
He was stirred as Daniel spoke in gentle tones.
