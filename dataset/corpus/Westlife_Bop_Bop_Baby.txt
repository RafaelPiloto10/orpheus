My mama said nothing would break me or lead me astray  
Who would have guessed I'd let my mind drift so far away  
You always said I was a dreamer now it's dead  
I'm dreaming of things that's making my mind go crazy  
Small things like  
  
When I call you at home and he answers the phone  
Or I get your machine and I don't hear me  
When I lie in my bed with the thoughts in my head  
When we danced and we sang and we laughed all night  
  
Oh the bop bop baby please don't let me go  
Can't live my life this way  
Oh the bop bop baby please just let me know  
And put my mind at ease for sure  
  
On a love train  
20 odd years now  
I got off today  
But nobody said the stop that I've taken  
Was a stop too late  
Now I'm alone I'm thinking of stupid  
Hurtful small things like  
  
When I call you at home and he answers the phone  
Or I get your machine and I don't hear me  
When I lie in my bed with the thoughts in my head  
When we danced and we sang and we laughed all night  
  
Oh the bop bop baby please don't let me go  
Can't live my life this way  
Oh the bop bop baby please just let me know  
And put my mind at ease for sure  
  
Maybe it's time to say goodbye  
Maybe it's time to let this lie  
This is when we must set things right  
Now that we've gone our separate ways  
I just can't live these desperate days  
This is what I've been trying to say  
  
Oh the bop bop baby please don't let me go  
Can't live my life this way  
Oh the bop bop baby please just let me know  
And put my mind at ease for sure
