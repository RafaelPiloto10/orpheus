[Intro:]  
We got Mr. Lionel Richie up in here  
Wyclef, Jerry Wonda, Lil Wonda  
Mr. Lionel Richie, wanna talk to the girls right now  
  
I'm faithful, yes I done that  
She forgave me  
Then she came back  
I was grateful,  
When she did that  
When she couldn't take the pain no more  
She didn't come back  
  
From the billboards  
To the world tours  
Sometimes I reminisce about the Commodores  
Oh, that brick house  
Would make a grown man lose his mind  
A young boy reach his prime  
  
(Pre Hook)  
Call it grown folks talk if you want to  
But young blood  
You don't wanna lose her  
Man up, pick up the phone  
And call her, tell her that you love her  
Cause the worst thing for a man  
Is to find his woman with another man  
Outside holding hands  
(You need to man up, tell your girl)  
  
[Hook:]  
I, I, I apologize  
I, I never meant to make you cry  
Is to find his woman with another man  
Outside holding hands  
(You need to man up, tell your girl)  
  
[Hook:]  
I, I, I apologize  
I, I never meant to make you cry  
I, I, I apologize  
I, I baby girl just dry your eyes  
  
Lionel, let me serenade the girls right now  
  
(Pre Hook)  
  
Oh yeah  
Call it grown folks talk if you want to  
But young blood  
You don't wanna lose her  
Man up, pick up the phone  
And call her, tell her that you love her  
Cause the worst thing for a man  
Is to find his woman with another man  
Outside holding hands  
(You need to man up, tell your girl)  
  
[Hook:]  
  
I, I, I apologize  
I, I never meant to make you cry  
I, I apologize  
I, I baby girl just dry you eyes
