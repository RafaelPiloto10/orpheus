Superstar I am! I haven't dropped the classic,  
No I'll matter, it was written, all I am!  
Honest to the public, that I am!  
... That I am,  
... Perhaps that's you!  
A hater I'm not so perhaps that's you!  
Send a fucked up deal, perhaps that's you,  
But I own my public sin, unlike you.  
Go and just look pass all my hits,  
Notice when I say: 'All my hits! '  
Pete's got a track record unlike them,  
Money made me see  
My enemies is really just my friends!  
Riding a Lamborghini but...  
Money's what you got, not what you spend,  
Listen to this verse here, closer!  
These boys are soft like butter,  
But they still wanna toast me,  
So put your hands up, nice and slowly!  
This is stick up, now!  
Give me what you own me!  
T. V teen now, you know what it is,  
I'ma make your name world wide  
For not paying enough
