Time, is going by, so much faster than I,  
And I'm starting to regret not spending all of it with you.  
Now I'm, wondering why, I've kept this bottled inside,  
So I'm starting to regret not telling all of it to you.  
So if I haven't yet, I've gotta let you know  
  
You're never gonna be alone!  
From this moment on, if you ever feel like letting go,  
I won't let you fall,  
You're never gonna be alone!  
I'll hold you 'till the hurt is gone.  
  
And now, as long as I can, I'm holding on with both hands,  
Cause forever I believe that there's nothing I could need but you,  
So if I haven't yet, I've gotta let you know  
  
[Chorus]  
You're never gonna be alone!  
From this moment on, if you ever feel like letting go,  
I won't let you fall,  
When all hope is gone  
I know that you can carry on  
We're gonna take the world on  
I'll hold you 'till the hurt is gone  
  
Oh,  
You've gotta live every single day,  
Like it's the only one, what if tomorrow never comes?  
Don't let it slip away,  
Could be our only one, you know it's only just begun  
Every single day,  
May be our only one, what if tomorrow never comes?  
Tomorrow never comes  
  
Time, is going by, so much faster than I,  
And I'm starting to regret not telling all of this to you.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm gonna be there all the way,  
I won't be missing one more day,  
I'm gonna be there always,  
I won't be missing one more day.
