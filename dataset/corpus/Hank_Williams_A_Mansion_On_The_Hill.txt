Tonight down here in the valley  
I'm lonesome and O how I feel  
As I sit here alone in my cabin  
I can see your mansion on the hill  
  
Do you recall when we parted  
The story to me you revealed  
You said you could live without loving  
In your loveless mansion on the hill  
  
I've waited all through the years love  
To give you a heart true and real  
Cause I know you're living in sorrow  
In your loveless mansion on the hill  
  
The light shine bright from yer window  
The trees stand so silent and still  
I know you're alone with your pride dear  
In your loveless mansion on the hill
