Dreams of money and a double bag of diamonds,  
Get it like that, I got it like that,  
Plenty bank rolls but I still look back,  
Same old flow with a lot more stacks,  
Big body cadillacs, million dollar contracts,  
The cribs, the cars, the jewelry,  
Exotic brauds they killin me, thick and all alicia keys,  
Still get involved with the project freaks,  
One phone call they becomin in a fleet,  
18 hoes like a world city streets,  
Just like off a ball in the club, with that green,  
I got green trust in my jeans...

Cash correct goin meet my gorillas,  
Got shells the size them armadillas,  
Might find you in da miami river,  
Day county home to them gangsta niggas,  
Might stank da nigga, got stainless triggas,  
Pure jane and dealers, with grain appealings to them thangs  
I really role gang with millions,
