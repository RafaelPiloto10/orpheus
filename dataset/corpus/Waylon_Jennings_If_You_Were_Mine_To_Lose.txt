If you were mine to lose I'd gladly let you go  
Cause that would mean you once belonged to me  
I'd gladly take the heartache of losing you some day  
Cause then at least I'd have the memory  
Through all the years I've known you you've never noticed me  
Just a friend that's all I've been to you  
I'd gladly let you break my heart for just one memory  
Just to know that you were mine to lose  
If I could only hold you just one time for one short moment heaven would be
mine  
If you were mine to lose I'd gladly let you go just to know that you were mine
to lose  
I could only hold you...
