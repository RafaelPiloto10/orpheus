Broken windows  
In empty hallways  
Pale dead moon  
And the sky streaked with grey  
Human kindness overflowing  
And I think it's gonna rain today  
  
Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles  
With frozen smiles to keep love away  
Human kindness overflowing  
And I think it's gonna rain today  
  
Lonely, lonely  
Tin can at my feet  
I think I'll kick it down the street  
That's the way to treat a friend  
  
Right before me  
The signs implore me  
Help the needy  
And show them the way  
Human kindness, it's overflowing  
And I think it's gonna rain today  
  
Lonely, so lonely  
Tin can at my feet  
I think I'll kick it down the street  
That's the way to treat a friend  
  
Right before me  
The signs implore me  
Help the needy  
And show them the way  
Human kindness, it's overflowing  
And I think it's gonna rain today
