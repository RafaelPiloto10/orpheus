You know I love my music, it's really all I got  
I never really cared that much if I was cold or hot  
Now I got a job to do, I don't want to begin  
I've gotta write a sad song for my friend  
He was not like me no he tried a lot but just like me he cried a lot  
Oh, I never thought I'd have to cause that ain't what I'm in  
I've gotta write a sad song for my friend  
She was quite a lady and he was quite a guy  
They were quite a couple it was quite a cry  
They used to sit and laugh a lot 'cause I like to pick and grin  
They helped me write a sad song for my friend  
He was not like me [unverified]  
I don't wanna sing no sad songs for my friend
