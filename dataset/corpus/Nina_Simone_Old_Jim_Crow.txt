Old Jim Crow  
Where you been baby  
Down Mississippi and back again  
Old Jim Crow don't you know  
It's all over now  
  
Old Jim Crow  
What's wrong with you  
It ain't your name  
It's the things you do  
Old Jim Crow don't you know  
It's all over now  
  
Old Jim Crow  
You've been around too long  
Gotta work the devil  
'Til your dead and gone  
  
Old Jim Crow  
Yes, don't you know  
It's all over now  
It's all over now  
  
Old Jim Crow  
You know it's true  
When you hurt my brother  
You hurt me too  
Old Jim Crow don't you know  
It's all over now  
  
Old Jim Crow  
I thought I had you beat  
Now I see you walkin'  
And talkin' up and down my street  
Old Jim Crow don't you know  
It's all over now  
  
Old Jim Crow  
You've been around too long  
Gotta work the devil  
'Til your dead and gone  
  
Old Jim Crow don't you know  
It's all over  
All over  
Oh Lord, it's all over  
  
All over  
It's all over  
It's all over  
It's all over now.
