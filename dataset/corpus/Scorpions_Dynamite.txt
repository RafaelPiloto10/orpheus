Kick your ass to heaven  
With rock'n roll tonight  
I'll make this night a special one  
Make you feel alright  
  
Shoot my heat into your body  
Give ya all my size  
I'm gonna beat the beat tonight  
It's time to break the ice  
  
Dynamite  
Dynamite  
Dynamite

Hit the top together  
Get ya with my spell  
I'm gonna make my shot tonight  
Take you down to hell  
  
Eat your meat until you're breathless  
Twirl your hips around  
I'm gonna break my neck tonight  
I'll get you off the ground  
  
Dynamite  
You're dynamite  
Dynamite  
Dynamite  
  
Get it now or never  
Let's get it really tight  
We'll make this night a special one  
Make us feel alright  
  
Put your heat into my body  
Give ya all my size  
We gonna beat the beat tonight  
Come on let's break the ice
