Sometimes you look so sad that I could cry  
And sometimes when you get mad I want to say goodbye  
But I know in my heart I could never be the one to leave  
It's just that I find love so hard to believe sometimes  
I try to understand all the things that you do  
But sometimes I wonder why I chose a man like you  
'cause you hurt me without even trying so many times  
I can't help but find love so hard to believe sometimes  
Sometimes I see your eyes on another girl  
Then you say you love me more than the whole wide world  
So I've learned to close my eyes to it and not read between the lines  
It's just that I find love so hard to believe sometimes  
Yes I've learned to close my eyes to it  
I've reconciled my mind to it  
It's just that I find love so hard to believe sometimes  
I said that I find love so hard to believe sometimes
