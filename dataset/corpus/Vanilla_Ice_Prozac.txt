[Verse 1]  
Stop as I drop this bomb  
Blow up this place like another vietnam  
I'm heavy like a holyfield blow to the dome  
Back up son, now give me room, give me room  
I set it off like this, don't give it up (uh)  
I'm all up in you till you just can't get enough  
I'm real hard to the bone you want more  
I sneak up on you like a sniper at your back door  
Phat flavor for your brain you know the time  
So check the wrath it's for real cause I'm gonna get mine  
I roll up on you like eastwood  
I'm blowing up fifteens as I'm riding through your neighborhood  
I spreads butter like parkay  
Real smooth with the flow and even when I parlay  
Do what you feel and check the skill  
I'm in your grill, peep this - I got the raw deal  
And in your jeep cherokee or land cruiser  
When you're rolling through the hood I know you're gonna use a  
Track like this all up in your eardrum  
So pump the e.q. and let the speakers hum  
[Chorus]  
We gets crazy like prozac  
Hype enough to start a party and illy have a heart attack  
We gets crazy like prozac  
Hype enough to start a party and illy have a heart attack  
We gets crazy like prozac  
Hype enough to start a party and illy have a heart attack  
We gets crazy like prozac  
Hype enough to start a party and illy have a heart attack  
[Verse 2]  
Go and check it I think it's time to wreck it  
Here I come again with my stuff, so let's test it  
I'm cool like the ice, or vanilla, hear my flavor  
Freezin up the mic, I hit you with somethin you can savor  
No slippin, no stonin, I am gettin to the point  
So hit the mad ism and light another joint  
The easy like stylist with a kick when I'm kicking  
No tripping, I'm hitting, so get a good grip in  
Get with a style I be using, and there's no dissin  
And here's a quick lesson - I carry a smith and wesson  
Listen up close and there'll be no confusion  
Now you're addicted to mentally abusing  
Word to the mother I'm hear to tear it up  
And if you can't get with it, I don't give a fuck  
So run to your crew and tell them I am hear  
This here is for the people  
[Chorus]  
It's the funky rhyme killer  
The dope song thriller  
Get your ass back, before you get caps in ya  
It's the funky rhyme killer  
The dope song thriller  
Get your ass back, before you get caps in ya  
It's the funky rhyme killer  
The dope song thriller  
Get your ass back, before you get caps in ya  
[Chorus]
