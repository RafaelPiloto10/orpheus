The sky was blue  
And high above  
The moon was new  
And so was love  
This eager heart of mine was singing  
Lover where can you be  
  
You came at last  
Love had its day  
That day is past  
You've gone away  
This aching heart of mine is singing  
Lover come back to me  
  
When I remember every little thing  
You used to do  
I'm so lonely  
Every road I walked along  
I walked along with you  
No wonder I am lonely  
  
The sky is blue  
The night is cold  
The moon is new  
But love is old  
And while I'm waiting here  
This heart of mine is singing  
Lover come back to me  
  
When I remember every little thing  
You used to do  
Honey I get oh so lonely  
Every road I walked along  
I walked along with you  
Ain't no wonder I am lonely  
  
The sky is blue  
The night is cold  
The moon is new  
But love is old  
And while I'm waiting here  
This heart of mine is singing  
  
Lover come back  
Lover come back  
Lover come back to me  
Lover come back  
  
Lover come back  
Lover come back to me  
Lover come on back  
Lover come on back  
  
Lover come on back to me  
Come on back to me girl  
Come on back girl  
Lover come back to me
