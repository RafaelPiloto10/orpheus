People you know try to tell you things  
Bad things that you don't want to know about  
Tell you tomorrow what you did today  
Just remember, it's a small town  
It's a real small town  
  
She gets tired of all the stupid boys  
She can't wait until they're done  
She wants a man who can take his time  
She wants someone who can make her come  
Yeah, can you make me come  
  
You always say you want a simple life  
You and me both know that you are a liar  
You always say you want a simple life  
Hearing you talk just makes me tired  
Swim in the heavy water  
Buried in the sand  
  
Happy hearts fall from my shaky hands  
I can't hide my sexual life  
  
He always says he wants to find a special one  
But you watch his head go spinning around  
He really wants anyone who'll give it up  
He seems to forget he's in a small town  
You always say you never fuck around  
  
You say this town is just plain full of liars  
Yeah you always say you never fuck around  
Hey, hearing you talk just makes me tired  
Swimming in the heavy water  
Buried in the sand  
  
Happy hearts fall from my stupid hands  
I can't hide my sexual life  
My sexual life
