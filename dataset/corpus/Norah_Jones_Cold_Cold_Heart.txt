I've tried so hard my dear to show  
That you're my every dream  
Yet you're afraid each thing I do  
Is just some evil scheme  
  
A memory from your lonesome past  
Keeps us so far apart  
Why can't I free your doubtful mind  
And melt your cold cold heart  
  
Another love before my time  
Made your heart sad an' blue  
And so my heart is paying now  
For things I didn't do  
  
In anger unkind words are said  
That make the teardrops start  
Why can't I free your doubtful mind  
And melt your cold cold heart  
  
There was a time when I believed  
That you belonged to me  
But now I know your heart is shackled  
To a memory  
  
The more I learn to care for you  
The more we drift apart  
Why can't I free your doubtful mind  
And melt your cold cold heart
