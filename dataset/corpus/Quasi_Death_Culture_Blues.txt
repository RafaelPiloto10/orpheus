Wizard's kiss, dragon's breath  
Pot of gold payable on death  
  
You think you're on the winning team  
But it's no game, though it just might be a dream  
  
Highest hill to lowest pit  
If you ain't got love, you ain't got shit  
'Cause it's your life to live or to lose  
I'm tired of singing the death culture blues!  
  
Now we're told just to get in line  
And bowo down the almighty dollar sign  
Battle turns from left to right  
But I'm not going down without a fight  
  
I've done my time, I took my bath  
I'm back on track down the shining pathy  
'Cause it's your life to live or to lose  
I've tired of singing the death culture blues!
