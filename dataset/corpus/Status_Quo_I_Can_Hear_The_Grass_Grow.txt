See the people all in line, what's making them look at me?  
I can't imagine that their minds are thinking the same like me  
I can hear the grass grow, I can hear the grass grow  
I see rainbows in the evening  
  
My head's attracted to a magnetic wave of sound  
With a stream of coloured circles making their way around  
I can hear the grass grow, I can hear the grass grow  
I see rainbows in the evening  
  
Can't seem to puzzle out the signs  
My senses form a micro-line  
So get a hold of yourself, now baby  
You see I need you to help, now baby  
Get a hold of yourself, now baby  
  
Put your head down to the ground and listen to your mind  
If you can't spell what you find I'll know that you're not my kind  
I can hear the grass grow, I can hear the grass grow  
I see rainbows in the evening  
  
Can't seem to puzzle out the signs  
My senses form a micro-line  
So get a hold of yourself, now baby  
You see I need you to help, now baby  
Get a hold of yourself, now baby  
  
See the people all in line, what's making them look at me?  
I can't imagine that their minds are thinking the same like me  
I can hear the grass grow, I can hear the grass grow  
I see rainbows in the evening  
  
I can hear the grass grow, I can hear the grass grow  
I see rainbows in the evening  
I can hear the grass grow, I can hear the grass grow  
I see rainbows in the evening
