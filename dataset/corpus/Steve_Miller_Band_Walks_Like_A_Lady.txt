Everybody wants to be her man  
Everybody knows her name  
And every single time that she walks by  
Everybody just falls back lame  
Everybody wants to see her  
Ain't nobody wants to talk  
They're afraid that they might say too much  
Afraid that she might walk  
You know she walks like a lady  
But she acts like a child  
She can drive you crazy  
Yeah, she can drive you wild  
Talks like a baby  
But she looks like a lady to me  
Why do they blame her  
Why do they call her name that way  
All they want to do is  
Try to shame her  
Try to make her play their game that way  
They'll never chain her down  
They'll never make her stay that way  
She's not that way  
You can't explain her cause all she wants to do is  
Walk like a lady  
But she acts like a child  
She can drive you crazy  
Yeah, she can drive you wild  
Talks like a baby, but she looks like a lady to me  
Time just keeps on passin'  
Till I finally asked her out  
She said pick me up at eight  
And don't be late  
And we'll see what you're about  
Up to the drive just ready to roll  
The girl was no where to be seen  
She stood me up, she knocked me down  
Boy, that girl is mean  
You know she walks like a lady  
But she acts like a child  
She can drive you crazy  
Yeah, she can drive you wild  
Talks like a baby, but she looks like a lady to me  
Why do they blame her  
Why do they call her name that way  
All they want to do is  
Try to shame her  
Try to make her play their game that way  
They'll never chain her down  
They'll never make her stay that way  
She's not that way  
You can't explain her cause all she wants to do is  
Walk like a lady  
Talk like a lady  
You know she walks like a lady  
You know she talks like a baby  
Walk like a lady  
Talk like a lady  
You know she walks like a lady  
You know she talks like a baby  
Looks like a lady to me  
Looks like a lady to me  
Looks like a lady to me
