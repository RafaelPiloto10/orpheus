I've loved you since the very first day  
When I caught you looking my way  
A smile and just knew it.  
And up until you came along, no one ever heard my song,  
Now its climbing with a bullet.  
  
Its nice to have someone, so honestly devoted,  
But when it's said and done, girl I hope you know that,  
  
The traveling, the singing, it don't mean nothing without you  
The fast cars, the guitars, they are all just second to,  
This life, this love that you and I have been dreaming of, for so long  
It'd all be as good as gone, without you.  
  
Oh ho, without you, hey hey  
  
Along comes a baby girl, and suddenly my little world,  
Just got a whole lot bigger, yes it did.  
And people that I barely knew, who love me 'cause I'm part of you  
Man it's tough to figure  
How two souls can be, miles from one another  
But still you and me, have somehow found each other.  
  
The traveling, the singing, it don't mean nothing without you  
The fast cars, the guitars, they are all just second to,  
This life, this love that you and I have been dreaming of, for so long  
It'd all be as good as gone, without you.  
  
Without you, oh oh  
Without you I'd survive, but I'd have to have the notion  
That I could live this life, just going through the motions  
  
The traveling, the singing, it don't mean nothing without you  
The fast cars, the guitars, they are all just second to,  
This life, this love that you and I have been building up so high  
It's never gonna touch the sky, without you.  
  
Mm, without you  
Without you, baby, baby, baby without you  
Without you.
