I hear you calling me 'dearest' too.  
My dearest,  
I'm nearest than I've ever been before  
To have you calling me 'dearest' once more.  
  
My dearest, this picture,  
My own memory,  
Wishing this picture be reality.  
  
Where do I go from here?  
The lord took you away.  
And if you could see me today.  
I will remember you.  
I will remember you.  
  
My dearest, sincerest,  
There's no one but you and  
Here in my heart  
You're my dearest too.  
  
Where do I go from here?  
The lord took you away.  
And if you could see me today,  
I will remember you.  
I will remember you.  
  
My dearest, sincerest,  
There's no one but you and  
Here in my heart  
You're my dearest too.
