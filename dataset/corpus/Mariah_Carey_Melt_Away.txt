You come to me with a casual flow  
And suddenly my defenses start to go  
When you talk to me in that sensual tone  
It envelopes me and I lose my self control  
  
And baby I just melt away  
Fall like rain  
Every time I see your face I go off  
I just want to break it down  
Anytime you come around  
Maybe I could melt away in your arms  
  
Imagining that you're taking it slow  
And so tenderly  
'Till the feeling overflows  
When you look at me I go soft and cave in  
And I can't conceal that I'm slowly weakening  
  
And baby I just melt away  
Fall like rain  
Every time I see your face I go off  
I just want to break it down  
Anytime you come around  
Maybe I could melt away in your arms  
  
You and me in a cloud of reverie  
Spin around inside my head unendingly  
Thoughts run wild as I sit and rhapsodize  
Paint pretty pictures of what I'd do if you were mine  
  
And baby I just melt away  
Fall like rain  
Every time I see your face I go off  
I just want to break it down  
Anytime you come around  
Maybe I could melt away in your arms
