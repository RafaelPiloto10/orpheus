I am the one who wants to show  
You a secret of your cheating world  
Wherever I will go, no one can see me  
'Cause I'm the invisible man  
  
I'm a creature with one goal  
Rise up to heaven when the time has come  
I have no body but a soul  
God's law is written on my way, forever  
  
Time by time I think it's over  
The malediction I have got  
When the world was young  
I've been captured in the name of god  
To save people, but who cares?  
Since a thousand years  
Until the holy land will come  
  
Here I am the invisible man  
A lost fallen angel helping mankind where I can  
My memories are there to save your world  
For you I'm just the invisible man  
  
There's the destiny you don't know  
I'm a guardian angel and whatever you'll go  
You fight through your life not alone  
You can't hear me, nor see me  
But trust the holy flow  
  
Here I am the invisible man  
A lost fallen angel helping mankind where I can  
My memories are there to save your world  
For you I'm just the invisible man
