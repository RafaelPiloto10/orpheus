Now the ballroom's empty  
Everybody I have known  
Has been and gone  
With the music over  
Here am I  
A shadow echoing on  
Spin me round  
  
Now there must be something  
In what they say of all things  
Great and small  
There's dozen roses  
Lying almost dying  
To say all  
Spin me round  
  
A nether world dancing toy  
I'm wired for sound  
Does it matter to me  
Who turns the key?  
Now if life is for living  
Then the way is clear  
But I don't understand  
Why the dream has ended  
Yet I can't wake up  
Lend a hand  
Spin a round
