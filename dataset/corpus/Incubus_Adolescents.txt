I'm feeling out of bound, out of bounds  
I'm running out of time, out of time  
I know there's no such thing as either of them but  
It doesn't make me feel any better  
  
Out of sight, out of mind  
Out of sight, out of mind  
We're out of time, we're out of mind,  
out of mind, out of mind  
Yeah (yeah), yeah  
  
I'm feeling overwhelmed, overwhelmed  
It's getting out of line, line, line, line  
I know I'm not alone, just adolescents you and I  
It doesn't make me feel any better  
  
Out of sight, out of mind  
Out of sight, out of mind  
We're out of time, we're out of mind,  
out of mind, out of mind  
Yeah (yeah), yeah  
Yeah (yeah), yeah  
  
Out of sight, out of mind  
Out of sight, out of mind  
We're out of time, we're out of mind,  
out of mind, out of mind  
we're out of mind,  
Yeah yeah, yeah
