[Verse 1]  
Oh quiet down, I've had enough  
I guess it's now or never  
I've been around, I've settled up  
I'll go soon or later  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I took a photograph of me  
And I was only nineteen  
I looked a little lost at sea  
I keep trying to find me  
  
[Chorus]  
Break for me brother, I need redemption  
I'm just a man, a man on a mission  
I want no trouble, I want no trouble  
I want no trouble, I want no trouble  
  
Break for me sister, give me a mention  
I've got no faith and oh did I mention  
I want no trouble, I want no trouble  
I want no trouble, I want no trouble  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'll pack it up, and hit the road  
And only take my lighter  
I've seen the glitz, I've seen the glam  
But I prefer the pay dirt  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge] x2  
Maybe you can save my soul  
With all the things that I don't know  
  
[Chorus]
