Kelly mountain road  
Saw a heavy load  
With a sagging heart  
And a break apart  
Voices in me  
Stood as thick as thieves  
With no sympathy  
For the beggars art  
I have passed these pines  
'bout a million times  
Effortlessly  
(effortlessly)  
Now I grip the wheel  
Fear is what I feel  
At the slow unraveling of  
(slow unraveling of)  
Me  
(me)  
(ah)  
(ah)  
  
But you tell me it's temporary  
(tell me it's temporary)  
It's a matter of time  
(it's a matter of time)  
By god  
Don't you think I know it's in my mind  
(in my mind)  
And it's right over left  
(right over left)  
And healing the then  
(healing the then)  
I'll soon be to nothing  
But I don't know when  
  
Well the way I flee  
(daylight)  
On my crooked feet  
Barn happy horse  
(fading)  
On a one-track course  
Then I self despise  
(daylight)  
Cryin' out my eyes  
'cause the happy trail  
(fading)  
Led me to remorse,  
But the road is long  
(but the road is long)  
And the song is gone  
I blow empty  
In my cicada shell  
If I saw my choice  
(if I saw my choice)  
I might find my voice  
But I don't know when  
(don't know when)  
And I just can't tell  
(just can't tell)  
(ah)  
(ah)  
  
You tell me it's temporary  
(tell me it's temporary)  
It's a matter of time  
(it's a matter of time)  
By god  
Don't you think I know it's in my mind  
(in my mind)  
It's right over left  
(right over left)  
And healing the then  
(and healing the then)  
I'll soon be to nothing  
But I don't know when  
  
Deep behind my face  
Is a safer place  
But old gears are hitched tight  
To the gate  
It's a daily grind  
Waiting to unwind  
Till I hear that click  
That unlocks my fate  
(ah)  
(ah)  
  
Yeah  
But you tell me it's temporary  
(but tell me it's temporary)  
And it's a matter of time  
(and it's a matter of time)  
By god  
Don't you think I know it's in my mind  
It's right over left  
(it's right over left)  
And healing the then  
(and healing the then)  
I'll soon be to nothing  
(i'll soon be to nothing)  
But I don't know when  
I'll soon be to nothing  
(i'll soon be to nothing)  
But I don't know when  
I'll soon be to nothing  
But I don't know when  
(but I don't know when)
