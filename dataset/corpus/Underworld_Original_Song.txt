When I'm alone I try to remember all of the things I want I get  
Depressed, but don't give me handouts everyone loves a trier I would  
Love to be lucky as you in with the rich survivors wouldn't complain if  
I was a rich man everyone can can! an' you want it! an' you need it! an'  
You love it! we sing the original song gimme more! we sing the original  
Song gimme more! we sing the original song gimme more! we sing please  
Give it to me! give it to me! when I'm alone I talk to myself, and,  
Don't get the wrong impression! don't have the cash, but I got the pride  
I never lay down and die I see the pictures I know the adverts everyone  
Else got lucky I got the bad deal looking around me everyone can can!
