There was a hint of danger  
They told him it's ok  
There was a chance of failure  
They told him it's alright  
A false security driven by  
A weakened state of mind  
It's calling and calling  
  
He had a big decision  
They told him it's ok  
Bound by his inhibitions  
They told him it's alright  
Time for reality  
Time to gain control of his own life  
It's calling and calling  
  
Do you know what is wrong?  
Try to keep it in line  
You can't go back (can't go back)  
There must be something  
  
He tried  
Once was not enough  
They told him it's alright  
He tried  
Wasn't good enough  
That doesn't make it right
