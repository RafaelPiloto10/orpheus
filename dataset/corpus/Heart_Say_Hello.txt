I'd like to know when you will say hello  
When will it be I'd like to see you know  
When will you change your mind and say hello?  
  
Something is sending all sensations high  
Someone is calling clearly to you now  
Look for the one who will not say good-bye  
  
Say Hello  
Say Hello  
  
Say Hello to all your secret light inside  
Build up your Fire, take a ride I know  
There'll be a night when you won't want to hide  
  
Say Hello  
Say Hello
