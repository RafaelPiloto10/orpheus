I don't care if tomorrow never comes  
This world holds nothing for me  
I've been lonely night and day ever since you went away  
So I don't care if tomorrow never comes  
If tomorrow never comes  
And the sun don't ever shine, it won't matter with me  
For when she ran away my world ended that day  
So I don't care if tomorrow never comes  
My lonely mind wonders back to days that used to be  
My broken heart cries out for you  
Oh if I can't have you here I can't go on my dear  
So I don't care if tomorrow never comes  
If tomorrow never comes  
And the sun don't ever shine, it won't matter with me  
For when she ran away my world ended that day  
So I don't care if tomorrow never comes  
If tomorrow never comes  
And the sun don't ever shine, it won't matter with me  
For when she ran away my world ended that day  
So I don't care if tomorrow never comes
