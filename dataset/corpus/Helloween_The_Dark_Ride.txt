All board step right this way  
The dark ride is leaving soon  
Just sign your name on the dotted line  
All I want is just your soul  
Tighten your belt and lets go  
Standing in line to get to the fairground  
Heading to the wicked side  
One way ticket, there is no returning  
Leave your soul at the gates  
  
Out of doubt, no hope  
Satan feeds our madness  
Insanity confirms where we stand  
Spit the red vile breath and  
Wrath is our gift that  
Leads direct to armageddon  
  
Take a place - on the dark ride  
Slowly creeping up - quickly coming down  
Take a spin on the dark ride  
May too far from the other side  
  
Step inside and take this final journey  
Your fantasies will come true  
Inclination without liberation  
Lifes carousel is catching you  
  
Even through the darkest phase  
Be it thick or thin  
I'm your pain when you can't feel  
Driven to our final fate  
Jump out of this game  
  
Take a place - on the dark ride  
Slowly creeping up - quickly coming down  
Take a spin on the dark ride  
May too far from the other side  
  
Is there any wonder?  
Why we came about  
Was it for love?  
Or to let sin abound  
Isn't it a wonder  
Awake from blood thick dreams  
Remove all the stones from our hearts  
We must all believe  
  
Ohhh, will we find a way to the other side  
Heading for a light  
Who is holding the key, why can't we see  
The dark ride  
  
I force the engine of your deadly sins  
Even through the darkest phase  
Be it thick or thin  
I'm your pain when you can't feel  
I know too well you'll follow me, you follow me down  
  
Is there any wonder?  
Why we came about  
Was it for love?  
Or to let sin abound  
Isn't it a wonder  
Awake from blood thick dreams  
Remove all the stones from our hearts  
We must all believe
