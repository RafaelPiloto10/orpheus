Like to get to know you well  
Like to get to know you well  
Like to get to know you well  
So we can be one  
We can be one together  
  
Like to get to know you well  
Like to get to know you well  
Like to get to know you well  
So we can be one  
We can be one together  
  
Together we can cast away the fear  
Together we can wipe away the tear  
Together we can strip down the barriers  
And be one  
  
Don't want to talk about the weather  
Don't want to talk about the news  
Just want to get to the real you inside  
  
Like to get to know you well  
Like to get to know you well  
Like to get to know you well  
So we can be one  
We can be one together  
  
Don't you think now is the time  
We should be feelin'  
Just want to simply say  
Won't let you slip away  
  
People want to talk about the future  
Don't want to linger on the past  
Just want to reach to the real you inside  
Forget cold glances and rejections  
Leave the things that separate  
Build on a trust that we can stand on  
  
Like to get to know you well  
Like to get to know you well  
Like to get to know you well  
So we can be one  
We can be one together  
  
Finding all are insecure  
Opening the same door  
Leaving out a stubborn pride  
Seeing from another side  
  
Like to get to know you well  
Like to get to know you well  
Like to get to know you well  
So we can be one  
We can be one together
