Amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost but now I'm found was blind but now I see  
  
Twas grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears relived  
How precious did that grace appear the hour I first believed  
  
Through many dangers toils and snares I have already come  
Tis grace that has brought me safe thus far and grace will lead me on  
  
When we've been there ten thousand years bright shining as the sun  
We've no less days to sing God's praise than when we first begun  
And than when we first begun
