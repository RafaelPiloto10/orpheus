Who's gonna tell you goodnight?  
Who's gonna put out the light?  
I love you and love is almost crazy  
Slippin' through the so and so's  
Over all the fields we go  
Moonlight lady  
  
Don't wanna tell you so long  
Don't wanna mess up your song  
Feelin' like I do I'm almost crazy  
Choosin' all the red blue jeans  
Watchin' people be so mean  
Moonlight lady  
  
I'm on fire  
And I can hardly breathe  
Time goes by  
And all alone  
My poor heart grieves  
  
I love you just 'cause I do  
I didn't plan it with you  
But now we're here we might as well accept it  
We're together for all time  
Marching through the fields of dimes  
Moonlight lady
