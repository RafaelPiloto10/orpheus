Tired of feeling all by myself  
Being so different from everyone else  
Somehow you knew I needed your help  
Be my friend forever  
I never found my star in the night  
Building my dream was far from my sight  
You came along and I saw the light  
We'll be friends forever  
  
I can't face the thought of you leaving  
So take me along  
I swear I'll be strong  
If you take me wherever you go  
I wanna learn the things that you know  
Now that you made me believe  
I want you to take me  
'cause I long to be  
Able to see the things that you see  
Know that whenever you do  
I'll follow you  
  
Somebody must have sent you to me  
What do I have you could possibly need  
All I can give is my guarantee  
We'll be friends forever  
I can't face the thought of you leaving  
So take me along  
I swear I'll be strong  
When you take me wherever you go  
I wanna learn the things that you know  
Now that you made me believe  
I want you to take me  
'cause I long to be  
  
Able to see the things that you see  
Know that whenever you do  
I'll follow you  
Teach me more with each passing hour  
By your side  
I'll follow you  
I know I would cover?  
Is it true that you have the power  
To capture this moment in time  
Take me wherever you go  
I wanna learn the things that you know  
  
Now that you made me believe  
I want you to take me  
'cause I long to be  
Able to see the things that you see  
Know that whenever you do  
I'll follow you  
Take me wherever you go  
I wanna learn the things that you know  
Now that you made me believe  
(I want you to take me)  
I want you to take me
