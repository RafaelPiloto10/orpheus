Not long ago while dancin'  
Our eyes by chance did meet  
Though you were with your boyfriend  
You swept me off my feet.  
  
So foolishly as I cut in  
To hope for new romance  
I hardly had you in my arms  
When someone sought your glance.  
  
Your just a giveaway, giveaway, giveaway girl  
You're careless with your charms  
Just like a giveaway, giveaway, giveaway girl  
You'll never get in anyone's arms.  
  
You're everybody's sweetheart  
You never stick to one  
You'll play the field forever  
As long as you have fun.  
  
You'll take almost and bandit  
You love variety  
Whoever might be handy  
You'll fall for stupidly.  
  
Your just a giveaway, giveaway, giveaway girl  
You're careless with your charms  
Just like a giveaway, giveaway, giveaway girl  
You'll never get in anyone's arms.  
  
You give your kisses freely  
You throw your heart away  
You never stopped to think  
That someday you will have to pay.  
  
But by the time you wake up  
You're best days will be gone  
The sweetest words that you will hear  
Will be, please leave me along.  
  
Your just a giveaway, giveaway, giveaway girl  
You're careless with your charms  
Just like a giveaway, giveaway, giveaway girl  
You'll never get in anyone's arms.  
  
Your just a giveaway, giveaway, giveaway girl  
You're careless with your charms  
Just like a giveaway, giveaway, giveaway girl  
You'll never get in anyone's arms.  
  
You're just a giveaway, giveaway, giveaway, giveaway  
Giveaway, giveaway, giveaway, giveaway
