Fighting the odds while we still have time  
There is a limit don't cross that line  
It's no good with water we cannot drink  
We're a ship about to sink.  
We pray but the wall is just too high  
We pay with our lives to the dark tower in the sky.  
see'est la vie life in the shadows  
see'est la vie there's no tomorrow  
Give us back the blue blue sky  
Where the air is so fresh were eagles fly  
What good is a planet that's slowly dying  
What kind of life can it bring.  
We pray but the wall is just too high  
We pay with our lives to the dark tower in the sky.  
see'est la vie life in the shadows  
see'est la vie there's no tomorrow.
