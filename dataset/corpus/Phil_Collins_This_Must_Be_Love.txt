It must be love, I'm feeling  
This must be love  
Oh this must be love, I'm feeling  
This must be love  
  
Well I wait in every day, just in case,  
You decide to call  
And I can hardly wait,  
'Coz I never thought time could pass so slowly  
  
It must be love, I'm feeling  
This must be love  
Oh this must be love, I'm feeling  
This must be love  
  
Happiness is something I never thought I'd feel again,  
But now I know  
It's you that I've been looking for  
And day by day more and more  
I know what you think, you've heard it before  
Don't tell me I know  
But this feeling inside my heart,  
You know I'm never letting go  
Cause I think that  
  
It must be love, I'm feeling  
This must be love  
Oh this must be love, I'm feeling  
This must be love  
  
Words can only say so much  
It's hard to express  
The things you do to me  
You're everything I could've ever dreamed you'd be  
  
This must be love, I'm feeling  
This must be love  
Oh this must be love, I'm feeling  
This must be love
