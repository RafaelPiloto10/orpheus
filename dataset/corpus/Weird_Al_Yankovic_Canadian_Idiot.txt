Don't want to be a Canadian idiot  
  
Don't want to be some beer swillin' hockey nut  
And do I look like some frost bitten hosehead  
I never learned my alphabet from A to zed  
  
They all live on donuts and moose meat  
And they leave the house without packin' heat  
Never even bring their guns to the mall  
And you know what else is too funny  
Their stupid monopoly money  
Can't take 'em seriously at all  
  
Well maple syrup and snow's what they export  
They treat curling just like it's a real sport  
They think their silly accent is so cute  
Can't understand a thing they're talking aboot  
  
Sure they got their national health care  
Cheaper meds, low crime rates and clean air  
Then again well they got Celine Dion  
Eat their weight in Kraft macaroni  
And dream of driving a Zamboni  
All over Saskatchewan  
  
Don't want to be a Canadian idiot  
We'll figure out their temperature in Celsius  
See the map they're hovering right over us  
Tell you the truth it makes me kinda nervous  
  
Always hear the same kind of story  
Break your nose and they'll just say sorry  
Tell me what kind of freaks are that polite  
It's gotta mean they're all up to something  
So quick before they see it coming  
Time for a pre-emptive strike
