The river is up, the logs are floatin'  
Let's get married and stop this courtin'  
I'm ready, ready-ready as I can be  
I'm ready-ready, ready-ready-ready-ready-ready for you  
If you're ready-ready for me  
The clouds are formin', it's startin' to rain  
Let's get married without a ring  
I'm ready, ready-ready as I can be  
I'm ready-ready, ready-ready-ready-ready for you  
If you're ready-ready for me  
The prices are up and no-one's biddin'  
Let's get married and stop this kiddin'  
I'm ready, ready-ready as I can be  
I'm ready-ready, ready-ready-ready-ready-ready for you  
If you're ready-ready for me
