Take us back  
Reawake  
Take us back  
Erase the wrongs that plague us  
Reawake  
Rewrite the page that changed me  
Take us back  
To the times of a cherished past  
Reawake  
  
Allow us to find the way  
Endured a lifetime of cold frustration  
Now lick the wounds and fight another day  
Your hands will reach  
The walls are coming down  
Stand up againt the rage  
The walls are coming down  
  
So it goes  
Hypnotize  
So it goes  
  
The blood pours from your heart  
Hypnotize  
Allow us to find the way  
Man down look around  
Seven rifles to the sky  
Lock and load, lock and load  
  
Gung ho, gung ho  
Afraid of he rafe you feel from a bullet name life  
And a gun called pride, aim, fire  
  
We fight to live or live to die  
We all fight the same old wars  
Will you fight to live or will you live to die  
  
So it goes  
Stand up and find the way
