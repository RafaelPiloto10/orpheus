Ain't it fun when you're always on the run  
Ain't it fun when you're friends despise what you become  
Ain't it fun when you get so high, well that you, you just can't come  
Ain't it fun when you know that you gonna die young  
  
It's such fun, good fun, such fun, such fun, aah such fun  
Such fun, such fun aah, yeah, fun, such fun, such  
  
Ain't it fun when you're taking care of number one  
Oh ain't it fun when you feel like you just gotta get a gun  
Ain't it fun when you just can't seem to find your tongue  
'Cause you stuck it too deep into something that really stung  
  
It's such fun, ah  
  
Well, so good to me, they spit right in my face  
And I didn't even feel it, it was such a disgrace  
I punched my fist right through the glass  
And I didn't even feel it, it happened so fast  
Such fun, such fun, such fun  
Ah such fun, such fun, such fun  
Ah such fun, such fun, such fun  
Ah such fun, such fun, such  
  
Ain't it fun when you tell her she's just a cunt  
Ain't it fun when you she splits and leaves you on the bum  
Well, ain't it fun when you've broken up every band that you've ever begun  
Ain't it fun when you know that you're gonna die young  
  
It's such fun  
Such fun, such fun, such fun  
Ah such fun, such fun, such fun  
Ah such fun, such fun, such fun  
Such fun, such fun, such fun  
Such fun, such fun, such fun  
Such fun
