It seems like every time I come around  
You say jay where have you been  
'Cause you can't get your mind off all  
The things you hear from your friends  
Well I don't give a damn, 'cause they don't understand  
The things that we do  
They don't even know me  
How the going to know what's best for you  
  
So I do what I gotta do, I'm gunna get through to you  
I'm yours no doubt, I do what I gotta do  
I'm trying to get through to you, right here right now  
  
Living in the city, it can be so hard to stay on your feet  
A girl that why it's good to know that I'm there for you and you're there for
me  
While were trying to get that paper it's a struggle just for us to get by  
But if we stick together we gon' make it baby we'll be alright  
  
I do what I gotta do, I'm gunna get through to you I'm yours no doubt  
I do what I gotta do, I'm trying to get through to you, right here right now  
I do what I gotta do, I'm gunna get through to you I'm yours no doubt  
I do what I gotta do, I'm trying to get through to you, right here right now  
  
I've got you babe  
I've got you baby  
I hold you down  
And I do what I gotta do  
I'm yours right now  
I gotcha ya baby  
I gotcha ya baby  
I hold you down  
I do what I gotta do  
I'm yours right now
