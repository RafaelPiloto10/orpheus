I'll be home for Christmas  
You can count on me  
Please have snow and mistletoe  
And presents 'neath the tree  
  
Christmas eve will find me  
Where the love light gleams  
I'll be home for Christmas  
And you'll be in my dreams  
  
I'll be home this Christmas, darling  
I'll be coming home to you  
And there's nothing in the world  
Gonna get in my way  
  
I'll be home for Christmas  
You can plan on me  
Please have snow  
And mistletoe  
And presents 'neath the tree  
  
Christmas eve will find me  
Where the love light gleams  
I'll be home for Christmas  
And you'll be in my dreams  
I'll be home for Christmas  
Till then you'll be in my dreams
