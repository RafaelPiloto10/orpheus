I'm gonna build a mountain, from a little hill.  
I'm gonna build a mountain, least I hope I will.  
I'm gonna build a mountain, I'm gonna build it high.  
I don't know how I'm gonna do it, only know I'm gonna try.  
  
I'm gonna build a daydream, from a little hope.  
I'm gonna push the daydream, up that mountain slope.  
I'm gonna build a daydream, woah, I'm gonna see it through.  
Gonna build a mountain and a daydream,  
Gonna make 'em both come true.  
  
I'm gonna build a heaven, as a will someday,  
And the Lord sends Ga-bri-el to take me away.  
Woah, I want to fine young son, to take my place.  
I'll leave my son in my heaven on earth with the good Lord's grace.  
  
I'm gonna build a mountain, from a little hill.
