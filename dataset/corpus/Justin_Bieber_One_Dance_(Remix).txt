[Intro: Kyla]  
Baby I like your style  
  
[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]  
Lips on your neck  
We're never too close now  
Nothing like you and me  
I don't know your name  
But I'm sure that you know me  
A little life with the music  
The feeling is mutual  
Loving the way you move on me  
Skin so soft, hands on my face to be directed  
And you're all that I can see  
You give the baddest one in here a run for their money  
And when this song comes on, you know  
  
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]  
I need a one dance  
1942 in my hand  
One more time 'fore I go  
Body lockin', put a hold on me  
I need a one dance  
1942 in my hand  
One more time 'fore I go  
Body lockin', put a hold on me  
  
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]  
You know, I like that you're wild  
So make your way over here right now  
We only got a little while  
Just thinkin' out loud  
Celebrate life with me babe  
Don't be in a rush to go now  
Oh girl  
  
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]  
I need a one dance  
1942 in my hand  
One more time 'fore I go  
Body lockin', put a hold on me  
I need a one dance  
1942 in my hand  
One more time 'fore I go  
Body lockin', put a hold on me  
  
[Outro: Justin Bieber]  
Hold on me  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
One more dance is all I need  
One more dance is all I need  
Oh, oh, oh
