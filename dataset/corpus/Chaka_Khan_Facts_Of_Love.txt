Back when we first met  
I think it was November  
I remember thinking that  
You had the sweetest smile  
Magic  
You have it  
Command me I'll obey  
It's just a fact of love  
Mold me  
Control me  
I'm only made of clay  
It's a fact of love  
CHORUS:  
Sometimes I wonder what is this love  
At once so delightful and frightening  
Thunder and lightening (love)  
The facts of love  
With those moody broody eyes  
You could be Svengali  
Just one touch - I'm mesmerized  
I just can't help myself  
You want it  
You got it  
You only have to say  
It's a fact of love  
You make me feel like I'm only made of clay  
A fact of love  
CHORUS  
Sometimes I wonder  
About the facts of love  
I sit and wonder  
About the facts of love
