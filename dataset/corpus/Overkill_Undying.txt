Wake up baby, daddy's comin' to crack your skull in two.  
Hit you like a hammer baby, down the play a fool.  
  
No to the kicking!  
No more to say!  
No having just one meaning!  
Nothing left to say.  
No way.  
  
Surface the anger,  
Through immortality.  
Should you be, undying?  
You never were, undying.  
  
Wake up break down daddy's comin', all you heard is true.  
So bite your lip and shut your mouth, it's no longer up to you.  
  
No to the licking!  
No more to say!  
No leavin' you alone  
Nothing more to say!  
No way! no  
  
Surface the anger,  
Immortality.  
Should you be, undying?  
Undying,  
  
No! for! give! ness!  
No! more! To! say!  
No way no  
  
Surface the anger,  
Immortality  
You never were, undying?  
Undying,  
Undying, never be undying.  
You never were, undying,  
You never seem, undying.  
How can you be?, undying.
