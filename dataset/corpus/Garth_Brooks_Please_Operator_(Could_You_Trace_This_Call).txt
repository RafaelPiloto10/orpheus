[Chorus]  
Please operator could you trace this call  
Find out where I'm drinking  
Which dirty beer hall  
And send a cab driver to call for me here  
No need to describe me  
'Cause I ain't all here  
  
She told me to get lost  
And that's what I did  
But I've done it so well  
I don't know where I hid  
And she swore that she never will see me again  
Hell I'll never find me  
In the shape that I'm in  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I had to ask myself  
If I were me  
And I was out drinking  
Well where would I be  
Then I thumb nailed the label  
And there I appeared  
Hiding out in a bottle  
Behind a three-day old beard  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I may be lonely  
But I'm never alone  
Cause I've been beside myself  
Since she's been gone  
  
Oh, please operator could you trace this call  
Find out where I'm drinking  
Which dirty beer hall  
And send a cab driver to call for me here  
And if he can find me  
I'll buy him a beer  
  
Please operator could you trace this call  
Find out where I'm drinking  
Which filthy beer hall  
And send a cab driver to call for me here  
I'll be beside myself  
Pouring down beer
