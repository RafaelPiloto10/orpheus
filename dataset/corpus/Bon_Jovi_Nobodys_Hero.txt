When you're afraid and it feels like you're too tired to fight  
Even if your heart don't know if you're still alive  
Man you never felt so alone in this world tonight  
And I, don't you know that I felt the same?  
I've seen the storm I've been through the rain  
You gotta know That I feel your pain  
Don't be afraid  
When you're on the edge, I will rescue you  
When you need a friend, I'll be there for you  
  
I'm nobody's hero  
But for you I'd lay down my life  
Nobody's hero  
But I'd tear down the stars from the sky  
If you would lean on me, baby dream on me  
You can bleed on me, just believe in me  
Nobody's hero  
  
But out on these streets  
They're waiting for blind eyes to see  
They're waiting for our cuts to bleed  
I hear they're waiting for you and me  
Well alright, alright  
Cause this time  
You know I ain't afraid to fight  
For you I ain't afraid to die  
As long as you are by my side  
It will be alright  
When all faith is gone, I will pray for you  
Just keep holding on, I'll be there for you  
  
I'm nobody's hero  
But for you I lay down my life  
Nobody's hero  
But I'd tear down the stars from the sky  
If you would lean on me, baby bleed on me  
Baby dream on me, just believe in me  
Nobody's hero  
  
I'm nobody's hero  
But for you I lay down my life  
Nobody's hero  
But I'd tear down the stars from the sky  
If you would lean on me, you can bleed on me  
Baby dream on me, just believe in me  
Nobody's hero  
  
Baby, lean on me, you can dream on me  
Just bleed on me, just believe in me
