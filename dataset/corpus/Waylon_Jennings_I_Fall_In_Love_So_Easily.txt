You don't know what's good for you you won't leave me alone  
I know you've got a family sleepin' at home  
Don't make me go out off my way don't tempt me please  
Don't you be so nice to me I fall in love so easily  
  
I'm all alone and need someone I guess that it shows  
But the things you make me want to do I'll regret I know  
So don't say things that you don't mean cause I just might believe  
Don't you be so nice to me I fall in love so easily  
  
I'm gonna leave tonight with you go on and have your fun  
I don't want to be a part of what I might have done  
I'm tempted when I think about the things that might have been  
And I'll admit I'd like to try but I know I couldn't win  
And so instead I'll say goodbye I know it's time to leave  
'Cause you been so nice to me and I fall in love so easily  
  
'Cause you been so nice to me I fall in love so easily  
  
'Cause you been so nice to me
