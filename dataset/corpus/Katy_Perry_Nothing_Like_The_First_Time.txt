The leaves were falling  
I was seventeen  
We'd been locking lips  
Grabbing hips  
Smoking cigarettes  
We took a drive in your 1990  
Had me down from out of town  
I was California  
Oh my legs were not shaved  
And you had dirt between your fingers  
They told us to behave  
But hey  
  
It's not like riding a bike  
It's not like flying a kite  
It's not as easy as pie  
There's nothing like the first time  
It's not like taking a bath  
It's not like having a laugh  
It's not like reading a map  
There's nothing like the first time  
  
I had seen it in the  
Magazines  
We would  
Change the chanel  
On the tv screen  
Cuz it's such a sin  
What ya did to me  
Straight to hell it's what they sell  
If you've done the deed  
Oh but what could be so bad  
Oh if everyone is guilty  
I guess we want what we can't have  
'Cause I've heard  
  
It's not like riding a bike  
It's not like flying a kite it's not as easy as pie  
There's nothing like the first time  
It's not like taking a bath  
It's not like having a laugh  
It's not like reading a map  
There's nothing like the first time  
  
Do you remember  
Do you remember  
Do you remember  
Do you remember  
  
La la la la la la  
There's nothing like the first time  
La la la la la la  
There's nothing like the first time  
  
It's not a walk in the park  
It's not a shot in the dark  
It's not a juvenile crime  
There's nothing like the first time  
It's not like tying the knot  
There's no connecting the dots  
And in case you forgot  
There's nothing like the first time  
Hey yeah yeah yeah  
There's nothing like the first time  
Oh oh ohhh  
There's nothing like the first time  
Hey ey ey  
There's nothing like the first time  
  
It's not like reading a map  
Oh I can give you that  
There's nothing like the first time
