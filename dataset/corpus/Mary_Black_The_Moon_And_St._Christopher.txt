When I was young I spoke like a child, And I saw with a childs eyes  
And an open door was to a girl, Like the stars are to the skies  
It's funny how the world lives up to all your expectations  
With adventures for the stout of heart, And the lure of the open spaces.  
  
There's two lanes running down this road, And whichever side you are on  
Accounts for where you want to go, And what you are running from  
Back when darkness overtook me, On a blindman's curve.  
  
Chorus:  
  
I relied upon the moon, I relied upon the moon  
I relied upon the moon and St. Christopher.  
  
Now I've paid my dues 'cause I have owed them, But I've paid a price sometimes  
For being such a stubborn woman, In such stubborn times  
I have run from the arms of lovers, I have run from the eyes of friends  
I have run from the hands of kindness, I have run just because I can.  
  
Now I've grown and I speak like a woman, And I see with a woman's eyes  
And an open door is to me now, Like the saddest of goodbyes  
Well it's too late for turning back, And I pray for the heart and nerve  
.  
Chorus: (repeat chorus)  
  
I relied upon the moon, I relied upon the moon  
I relied upon the moon and St. Christopher to be my guide.
