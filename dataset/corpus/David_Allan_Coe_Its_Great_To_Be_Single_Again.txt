No more dirty dishes in the sink when I come home  
I don't have to worry if I'll spend the night alone  
I can go to sleep and leave my record player on  
You're not there to hear me if I cry  
  
There's no way to say how much your leavin' turned me on  
I get so excited when I realize you're gone  
You're just like another verse in some old country song  
I got tired of singin' long ago  
I don't even miss you when I go to bed at night  
Gee it's great to know that I'll win each and every fight  
No one's arms to hold me after I turn out the light  
And I don't even miss you anymore  
I don't have to feed the dog or take the garbage out  
It don't matter if the neighbors hear me when I shout  
Since you're gone there's not much that I have to think about  
I'm so happy being all alone  
There's no more dirty dishes  
(Lord I feel so good tonight)  
(Yeah and it's great to be single again)
