Well I spent all my money at the record store  
Bought a copy of "Revolver" and some Gang of Four  
Singles Going Steady  
Billie Holliday  
They had it all on vinyl  
And I was blown away  
  
Then I walked around the corner to my favorite bar  
I do a lot more walkin' since I wrecked my car  
They all know my name here  
I feel right at home  
I just might spend the night here  
Since I know you're not alone  
  
And then they play that song I love  
And I feel like I just can't loose  
I feel like I should call you up  
But I'll stay here all night  
'Till I get it right  
  
Well I wrote you a letter but I tore it up  
Then I wrote another letter and I tore it up  
Stare up at the ball game  
On the TV screen  
If you care to find me  
You'll know where I'll be  
  
And then they play that song I love  
And I feel like I just can't loose  
I feel like I should call you up  
But I'll stay here all night  
'Till I get it right  
  
I'm down  
I'm down  
I'm down  
I'm down  
  
And then they play that song I love  
And I feel like I just can't loose  
I feel like I should call you up  
But I'll stay here all night  
'Till I get it right  
  
And then they play that song I hate  
And I feel like I just can't win  
I'm breakin' down  
The room begins to spin  
I'll stay here all night  
'Till I get it right
