Last night she made it plain she didn't want me today I woke later and alone  
Tomorrow I'll be turnin' to the bottle tonight I'll be cold and all alone  
She only broke my heart Lord not my spirit she only took my body not my soul  
My skin still burns in places where she touched me  
And when she touched me Lord I lost my self-control  
When she's got me where she wants me she don't want me  
I'm just another game she likes to play  
I don't think I can make it through tomorrow  
I almost never made it through today  
She sure knew how to love me when she loved me  
When I was weak she always came on strong  
She knew just what it took to drive me crazy  
And she knew how much I hate to be alone  
When she's got me where she wants me
