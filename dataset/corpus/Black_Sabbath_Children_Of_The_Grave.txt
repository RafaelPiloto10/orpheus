Revolution in their minds - the children start to march  
Against the world in which they have to live  
And all the hate that's in their hearts  
They're tired of being pushed around  
And told just what to do  
They'll fight the world until they've won  
And love comes flowing through  
  
Children of tomorrow live in the tears that fall today  
Will the sun rise up tomorrow bringing peace in any way?  
Must the world live in the shadow of atomic fear?  
Can they win the fight for peace or will they disappear?  
  
So you children of the world,  
Listen to what I say  
If you want a better place to live in  
Spread the words today  
Show the world that love is still alive  
You must be brave  
Or you children of today are  
Children of the Grave, Yeah!
