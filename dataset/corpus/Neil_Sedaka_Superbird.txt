When I was young, no worries in my head,  
I used to flap my arms, and fly around the bed,  
Just like a super bird, zoom, zoom, zoom.  
Up and down the chandelier, all around the room.  
  
When I told the people that I could really fly,  
They said that little boys ain't supposed to lie.  
Poor little super bird sitting on the ground,  
No zoom, zoom, zoom, when anyone's around.  
  
Fly, fly, fly super bird, super bird.  
While you're young super bird, super bird.  
There's time enough to wreck your dreams.  
Have your fun, super bird.  
  
They said I couldn't, so what did I do then?  
I cried myself to sleep and never tried again.  
Poor little super bird they woke you up too soon.  
No Santa Claus or green cheese on the moon.  
  
It skipped my mind for years, at least until tonight,  
When I tucked the kids in bed and I turned out the light.  
There at the doorway, you'll never guess what I heard  
"Zoom, zoom, zoom, super bird."  
  
Fly, fly, fly super bird, super bird.  
While you're young super bird, super bird.  
There's time enough to wreck your dreams,  
Have your fun, super bird.
