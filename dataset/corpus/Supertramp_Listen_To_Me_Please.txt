Well if you want some advice  
You gotta listen to me  
Getta hold of your life  
And you can have a new dream  
Forget the ups and the downs  
There's a new game in town  
For every turn in the road  
There's a new way to go  
  
I don't hear what you say  
Gonna find my own way  
You just try to persuade  
Everyone around you  
  
We'll make it easy for you  
Plane everything that you do  
Won't have to work very hard  
You'll make it big from the start  
Don't have to take it from me  
Here's a list you can see  
Every one of those names  
They found their fortune and fame  
  
Well it all sound so sweet  
So simple, so neat  
Ah but I can't believe  
Anything you tell me  
  
I know your life's a big mistake

You'll be the king with a crown  
Live on country estate  
You'll have a twenty foot gate  
Getting tanned at the pool  
You'll be making them drool  
Taking trip overseas  
Do anything that you please  
  
Well I feel so alone  
Where did I go so wrong?  
Do you know? Can you tell?  
Maybe can you help me  
  
I know, it's hard for you to take  
Let's go, this move you have to make  
  
Listen to me please, I'm down upon your knees  
They'll never treat you like they did before  
I'll make your dreams come true  
Now all I need is you  
Please believe me and all this will be yours

You'll know that I'll be watching over you  
I'll chase your blues away  
So just change your life today
