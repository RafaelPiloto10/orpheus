If I'd be so inclined to climb up beside you  
Would you tell me  
That the time just isn't right  
And if i ever find the key you hide so well  
Will you tell me  
That I can spend the night  
  
Leaving your smell on my coat  
Leaving your taste on my shoulder  
I still fail to understand  
What it is about this woman  
Yeah ow wow  
  
If I could bottle up the chills that you give me  
I would keep them  
In a jar next to my bed  
And if i should ever draw a picture of a woman  
It is you  
That would come flowing through my pen  
  
Leaving your clothes on the floor  
Making me walk out the door  
And i still fail to understand  
What it is about this woman  
Ow  
  
Helplessly melting  
As i stand next to the sun  
As you burn me  
I am screaming out for more  
Drink every drop of liquid  
In the heat that I've become  
Pop me open  
Spoon me out onto the floor  
  
Leaving your smell on my coat  
Leaving your taste on my shoulder  
I still fail to understand  
Fail to understand  
  
Leaving your smell on my coat  
Leaving your taste on my shoulder  
I still fail to understand  
What it is about this woman  
Yeah
