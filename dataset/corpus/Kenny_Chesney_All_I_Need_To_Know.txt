With a little luck this ol' truck will get me home today  
With a little more I'll still have this job tomorrow  
Weather man says a wet weekend he just might be right  
But rain or shine you'll be mine tonight  
  
That's all I need to know  
In a world where most things come and go  
I'll always have you to hold  
And that's all I need to know  
  
Heaven knows I ain't even close to bein' God's gift to women  
But in your arms I feel like I am  
I don't know it all, I sure can't solve  
The problems of the human race  
But I know how to bring a smile to your face  
  
That's all I need to know  
In a world where most things come and go  
I'll always have you to hold  
And that's all I need to know  
  
Darlin', say it one more time  
You will forever be mine  
  
That's all I need to know  
In a world where most things come and go  
I'll always have you to hold  
And that's all I need to know  
I'll always have you to hold  
That's all I need to know
