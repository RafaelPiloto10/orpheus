Before you ask for something better  
You should know I'm practiced at goodbyes  
Are you so deprived  
Think you're doing me a favor  
I don't need no lesser savior  
I'm doing fine  
  
Fragile things so close together  
Taped up broken from before  
Part of something or all of nothing  
A very long hard way to fall  
  
Go then, if you don't feel right  
Living in our home  
Choking, eat your pride, eat your pride alone  
  
Go then, if you don't feel right  
Living in our home  
Choking, eat your pride alone  
  
Needless tension, the walls around you  
Built before you came to tear them down  
It was you I found  
Take some time to think it over  
If it's so hard to walk this road we mind  
Then it's time to say goodbye  
  
Fragile things so close together  
Taped up broken from before  
Part of something or all of nothing  
A very long hard way to fall  
  
Go then, if you don't feel right  
Living in our home  
Choking, eat your pride, eat your pridealone  
  
Go then, if you don't feel right  
Living in our home  
Choking, eat your pride alone  
  
So go then, if you don't feel right  
Living in our home  
Choking, eat your pride, eat your pride alone  
If you don't feel right  
Living in our home  
Eat your pride alone
