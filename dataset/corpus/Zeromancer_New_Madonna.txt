I see you out on the dance floor shaking around  
I see you out on an empty beach  
I see you walking a one way street  
It's the same as always  
A star maybe you are  
A star maybe you are  
A new Madonna  
In a way I can hear myself say  
What is it worth  
I say we meet on the last place on earth  
It's insane as always  
Maybe you are  
A star maybe you are  
A new Madonna  
Is this the only way  
You make it like a new Madonna
