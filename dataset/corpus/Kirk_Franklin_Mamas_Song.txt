Verse 1  
Summertime has come and gone  
The leaves are slowly falling  
The other day my mother heard  
The voice of Jesus calling  
He said come home with me my child  
I'll take away your strife  
Mama went to sleep on this side  
And woke up in paradise  
  
Chorus  
Oh but how I miss her so  
More than you'll ever know  
How I miss her so  
More than you'll ever know  
How I miss her so  
More than you'll ever know  
  
Verse 2  
When I was a little boy  
Mama rocked me in her arms  
She protected me from danger  
And she kept me safe and warm  
But mama is not here now  
And I'm standing by myself  
But as long as I've got Jesus  
I don't need nobody else  
  
Chorus  
Oh but how I miss her so  
More than you'll ever know  
How I miss her so  
More than you'll ever know  
I miss her so  
More than you'll ever know
