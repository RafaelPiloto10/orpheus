Bells around St. Petersburg  
When I saw you  
  
I hope I get what you deserve  
And this is where I find  
  
Smoke surrounds your perfect face  
And I'm falling  
  
Pushing a broom out into space  
And this where I find the way  
  
(Chorus)  
The stadium arcadium  
A mirror to the moon (a mirror to the moon)  
Well I'm forming and I'm warning  
State of the art  
Until the clouds come crashing  
  
Stranger things have happened  
Both before and after noon (before and after noon)  
Well I'm forming and I'm warning  
Pushin' myself  
And no I don't mind asking  
Now  
  
Alone inside my forest room  
And it's storming  
  
I never thought I'd be in bloom  
But this is where I start  
  
Derelict days and the stereo plays  
For the all night crowd  
That it cannot phase  
And I'm calling  
  
Tedious weeds that the media breeds  
But the animal gets what the animal needs  
And I'm sorry  
  
(Chorus)  
  
Stranger things have happened  
Both before and after noon (before and after noon)  
Well I'm forming and I'm warming  
Pushin' myself  
And no I don't mind asking  
Now  
  
And this is where I find  
  
Rays of dust that wrap around  
Your citizen  
  
Kind enough to disavow  
And this is where I stand  
  
(Chorus)  
  
Stranger things have happened  
Both before and after noon (before and after noon)  
Well I'm forming and I'm warning  
Pushin' myself  
And no I don't mind asking  
  
The stadium arcadium  
A mirror to the moon (a mirror to the moon)  
Well I'm forming and I'm warning  
State of the art  
Until the clouds come crashing  
  
Stranger things have happened  
Both before and after noon (before and after noon)  
Well I'm forming and I'm warning  
To you
