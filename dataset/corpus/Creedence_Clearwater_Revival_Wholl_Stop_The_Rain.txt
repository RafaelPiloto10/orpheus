Long as I remember the rain been comin' down  
Clouds of mystery pourin' confusion on the ground.  
Good men through the ages tryin' to find the sun.  
And I wonder still I wonder who'll stop the rain.  
  
I went down Virginia seekin' shelter from the storm  
Caught up in the fable I watched the tower grow  
Five year plans and new deals wrapped in golden chains.  
And I wonder still I wonder who'll stop the rain.  
  
Heard the singers playin', how we cheered for more.  
The crowd had rushed together tryin' to keep warm.  
Still the rain kept pourin', fallin' on my ears  
And I wonder, still I wonder who'll stop the rain.
