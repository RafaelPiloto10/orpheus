She won't drink and she won't swear  
You can't take her anywhere at all  
She got style but she don't care  
She left me beyond repair before  
She'll pass you by, boy  
She'll try you and tie you in knots  
Run for cover  
'Cos brother, she's calling the shots  
Falling in and falling out  
When you know what she's about you're fine  
You lost both swings and roundabouts  
Can't you see you're running out of time?  
She'll pass you by, boy  
She'll try you and tie you in knots  
Run for cover  
'Cos brother, she's calling the shots  
She'll make you cry  
Wave bye bye as she takes what you've got  
Booked another  
And lover's still calling the shots  
She'll pass you by, boy  
She'll try you and tie you in knots  
Run for cover  
'Cos brother, she's calling the shots  
She'll pass you by, boy  
She'll try you and tie you in knots  
Run for cover  
'Cos brother, she's calling the shots
