I need your confidence need to know you're mine  
When it gets right down to the killing time  
I know your heart is bad but it's all  
I've ever had we can live our lives on this righteous crime  
  
I got kicked when I was down  
And a sailor took my girl to town  
Then she licked my wounds with the sea dog's salt I drank a  
Half a bottle of jack swore I'd never take you back by the bottle's  
End I was on that phone  
  
What you call compromise I don't understand what you call compromise I don't
understand  
  
How do you walk away? how do you walk away?  
How do you walk away from a woman that gone and done you wrong?
