When I look back  
On everything I've done  
I know you must have cried  
A river of tears,  
But, you were there  
When I was feeling low  
To walk me through my darkest fears.  
  
So when the sun goes down  
An' those nights grow colder,  
I will be there  
Looking over your shoulder.  
  
An' the deeper the love  
The stronger the emotion,  
An' the stronger the love  
The deeper the devotion.  
  
There were times  
I almost let you go  
When I thought I needed to break free,  
But you were there  
To whisper in my ear  
Why don't you share my dreams with me.  
  
So when the sun goes down  
An those nights are growing colder  
I will be there  
Looking over your shoulder.  
  
An' the deeper the love  
The stronger the emotion,  
An' the stronger the love  
The deeper the devotion.  
  
I don't mind, what you're doing to me,  
I don't mind, 'cause you're all I can see  
I don't mind, baby, you mean the world to me.  
  
When the sun goes down  
An' those nights are growing colder,  
I will be there  
Looking over your shoulder, baby, baby, baby.  
  
So When the sun goes down  
An' those nights are growing colder,  
I will be there  
Looking over your shoulder.  
  
'Cause the deeper the love  
The stronger the emotion,  
An' the stronger the love  
The deeper the devotion...  
  
I never gonna let you go,  
In my heart, I know.  
I love you, I love you.  
Oh baby, I really love you...
