You're layin' here with me we're holding each other it feels good so it must
be right  
You've touched me into thinking this could go on forever  
I don't care if forever is just for tonight  
Let's go as far as this feeling will take us we've never been there together
before  
Let's go as far as this feeling will take us  
And I've got a feeling we'll come back for more  
  
I'm like a forest and you're like a wildfire that's spreading all over me  
Baby come with me let's go to heaven  
At moments like this girl that's where we should be  
Let's go as far as this feeling  
  
For that kind of feeling we'll come back for me
