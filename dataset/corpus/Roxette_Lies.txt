Put 'em on  
Put the big boots on  
Baby put them big boots on.  
  
Make a mark  
Make a good kick start  
Kick yourself right outa my heart.  
  
It's a cookin' jumpin' jivin' shout  
'Cause you're every little thing I can do without  
Every line you lay, every trick you trade  
They could never ever make the grade.  
  
Lies  
La-la-la-la-lies  
It's all lies  
La-la-la-la-lies  
You're all lies.  
  
Honeybutt  
Keep your big mouth shut  
Baby keep that big mouth shut.  
  
It's a steamin' jumpin' jivin' shout  
'Cause you're every little thing I still dream about  
But the love you lay, every prayer you pray  
It will never ever make my day  
Listen to me good...  
  
Lies  
La-la-la-la-lies  
It's all lies  
Only lies  
La-la-la-la-lies  
You're all lies.  
  
Doo doo doo doo doo.
