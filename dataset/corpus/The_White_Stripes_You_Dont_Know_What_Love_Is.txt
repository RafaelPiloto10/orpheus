In some respects I suspect  
You've got a respectable side  
When pushed and pulled and pressured  
You seldom run and hide  
But it's for someone else?s benefit  
Not for what you wanna do  
Until I realize that you've realized  
I'm gonna say these words to you  
Yeah, you don't know what love is  
You do as you're told  
Just as a child at ten might act  
But you're far too old  
You're not hopeless or helpless  
And I hate to sound cold  
But you don't know what love is  
You just do as you're told  
I can see your man can't help but win  
Any problems that may arise  
But in his mind there can be no sin  
If you never criticize  
You just keep on repeating  
All those empty I love you's  
Until you say you deserve better  
I'm gonna lay right into you  
Yeah, you don't know what love is  
You just do as you're told  
Just as a child at ten might act  
But you're far too old  
you're not hopeless or helpless  
And I hate to sound cold  
But you don't know what love is  
No, you don't know what love is  
No, you don't know what love is  
You just do as you're told  
Yeah, you do as you're told, yeah
