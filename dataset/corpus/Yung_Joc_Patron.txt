(Oh, shit! What up Chino Dolla?)  
New Joc City, (Here it is, Block..?..)  
But right now, you 'bout to witness a nigga gon' of dat patron. (Hu-huh,
alright)  
I'm talkin' 'bout 7 shots (7 shots? whooo-hoo, shit?! Boyz in da hood)  
The next 'round on you nigga, (Alright) hah-hah  
Now what I want ya'll to do (Whatcha want me to do?)  
Take that shit to the muthafuckin' head. Let's go  
  
[Chorus]  
This ballers zone, J's on my feet  
I'm on dat Patron, so get like me [X2]  
  
Er-er'body love me, boss so fly  
Niggas throw dey deuces er'time I ride by [X2]  
  
C'mon, me tell me what it do, I do it for the A'  
When the top drop, rock the platinum Cardier  
Got that Microsoft, so they call me Bill Gates  
Ice links around my neck, lookin' like I build gates  
I'm Mista Amoco, yea I got the pumps  
Pockets on swoll, lookin' like they got the mumps  
I'm 'bout my change, gotta get the riches  
From the look of thangs ya'll gettin' J.C. pennies  
Pass dat Patron, the limes' right der. Rock with it, lean with in my nik'er  
Wink my eye at cha bitch, now wishing now she could touch  
See the J's on my feet and she love the diamond cuts  
Fresh to death, everyday, like I jumped up outta caskets  
Ask Chino Dolla about that dope boi magic  
Connected like apartments, keep one in the cartridge  
Chevy seats ostrich, name in the carpet  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I mix Patron and ever glow, I call it antifreeze  
Take one sip a drop off to her knees  
Mista V.I.P, get like me. Ice piece on white beat', I call it Iced-t  
Cush by the seven's I call it Mike Vic. She call me officer I hit her with my
nightstick  
My swag so mean, anger management  
You call it what you want, I'm on some mo' eleven shit  
These niggas wanna hate, godammit we can handle it  
Mad 'cause I got juice, call me Tropicana bitch  
Joc feel good. Joc buy the bar. Catch me in the hood pimp, rollin' on a gar  
I plead to the Judge, I'm guilty of the charge  
Imma balla-holic, can't help it Imma star  
You see the yellow ice, you holla , oh my God!  
Tynna guess the price, 'bout thirty large  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Er'body wanna know, how I do my thang?  
Yea I get money and I let my nutts hang  
Pull up to curb, cut it to the left  
My rims sittin' tall 'til I a dim the knee-steps  
I just see what I want, then I go get it.  
The apple jelly Chevy with peanut butter in it  
So don't get mad, pimp keep it cool  
I hang with them goons and the boys keep them tools  
I hustle all day, thas just how I live  
Stackin' them big faces, give 'em strippers dolla bills  
Check the dictionary for a P.I.M.P  
When you look it up partna, tell me who ya see?  
Young G, Young see, yea thas me  
Twenty-eight G's, on my feet twenty-three's  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]  
  
I'm on dat patron  
So gon on dat Patron, so gon on dat Patron, so get like me  
So gon on dat Patron, so gon on dat Patron, so gon on dat Patron, so get like
me  
Get like me, get like me  
So gon on dat Patron, get like me
