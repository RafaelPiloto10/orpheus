If I never love again I won't feel cheated  
You gave me more than I knew how to use  
On the day we met my journey was completed  
Even though my autumn years won't be with you.  
  
Seems like yesterday we called each other darling  
Seems like yesterday you reached and touched my hand  
I'd love to hear you say good morning darling  
Oh, what I'd give to live those darling days again.  
  
Today my heart survives on love that's borrowed  
From all the happy yesterdays we knew  
If I knew for sure the world would end tomorrow  
I have to spend my last days loving you.  
  
Seems like yesterday we called each other darling  
Seems like yesterday you reached and touched my hand  
I'd love to hear you say good morning darling  
Oh, what I'd give to live those darling days again.  
  
Oh, what I'd give to live those darling days again
