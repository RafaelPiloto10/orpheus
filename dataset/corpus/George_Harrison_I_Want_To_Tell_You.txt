I want to tell you  
My head is filled with things to say  
When you're here  
All those words, they seem to slip away  
  
When I get near you  
The games begin to drag me down  
It's all right  
I'll make you maybe next time around  
  
But if I seem to act unkind  
It isn't me, it's just my mind  
That is confusing things  
  
I want to tell you  
I feel hung up and I don't know why  
But I don't mind  
I could wait forever, I've got time, I've got time  
  
Sometimes I wish I knew you well  
Then I could speak my mind and tell you  
Maybe you'd understand  
  
I want to tell you  
I feel hung up and I don't know why  
I don't mind  
I could wait forever, I've got time  
  
I've got time  
I've got time  
I've got time
