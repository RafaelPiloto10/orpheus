[Chorus x2]  
It's gonna be alright  
Keep your head up to the sky  
[Z-Ro] Cause everything's gon' be alright  
[Z-Ro]  
Too many problems in my life I find myself unable to maintain  
The nigga that was takin over my brain  
Redesignin my main frame  
Developin so much hatred I feel like fuck all of y'all  
And for the slightest disrespect I would gladly touch all of y'all  
Dedicated to doing bad and addicted to drama  
People think I'm missin manners at home training but I'm just missin my momma  
It's like I don't fit in this bullshit world  
Surrounded by bullshit boys and bullshit bitches  
Better murder they own people before they come up  
And that's why I be mean muggin every son of a bitch that walk or run up  
I'm paranoid my nigga, I keep one in the chamber  
Willing to trade my freedom for life and live among strangers  
My goal is to become one hundred and ten years old  
I found myself but I can't grow until I find my soul  
Stuck on 25 but hopefully I'll survive, I'll make it  
Receiving hard pain from L.O.V.E., but I'll take it  
[Chorus x2]  
[Z-Ro]  
Dear Cookie I know you looking at ya son from heaven  
Totally clean and blessed without ???, drugs, and weapons  
Wish I could open up the pearly gates and see your face  
But I gotta sinful life momma and I may not get to see that place  
I just can't keep my cool, mother fuckers messin with the wrong weapon  
I pull out my Jimmy Bone switchblade and start cuttin'  
Nigga you ain't never known pain, you don't want this in your ??? vein  
Rusty blades make aim cream spread like mayonnaise magn  
I can't think of nothin' that ever made me feel like that dro  
Not even a woman, cause as quick as she comes she out the do'  
Can't put my trust up in Eve, cause she got tricks up her sleeve  
All I want to do is live until I'm D.E.A.D.  
Of natural causes I don't need nobody knockin' me off  
Just let me fall bitch get out the way you blockin' me off  
Stuck in the same spot but hopefully I'll survive, I'll make it  
Disrespected by the people I love, but I'll take it  
[Chorus x3]
