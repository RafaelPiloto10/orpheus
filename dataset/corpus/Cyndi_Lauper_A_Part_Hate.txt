Somber sister  
This is a strange and bitter fruit  
Because you taught me to sing  
And the rhythm in my heart  
And the rhythm in my feet is -  
  
Why are the rainbows  
Stolen from the sky  
And locked up in boxes  
Yellow, black, red and white  
Like birds in their cages  
Beating their wings on the bars  
And there's a song that they're singing  
It's a word in the world  
It's a word in their hearts  
  
A part hate  
I heard a man say  
Tear apart hate  
And I saw hope in his face  
A part hate  
Where the color of love  
Slips away  
  
Why are the children  
Carrying guns, not books  
Drug dealing, not learning  
The golden rule  
And the idea of freedom  
Not just the same  
Castle in the sky  
Haunted by white-sheeted ghouls  
Filled with hate me  
And hate you  
And proud of it too  
  
A part hate  
Heard a woman saying  
Tear apart hate  
And I saw hope in her face  
A part hate  
Where the color of love  
Slips away  
  
Why are the people  
Running down the block  
Rock throwing, not knowing  
What else to do  
But I'm just a spectator  
And I can never know the pain  
But when I hear  
That whip cracking  
I cry out tears of anger  
I cry out tears of shame  
  
A part hate  
I heard myself say  
Tear apart hate  
And I saw hope in my face  
A part hate  
Where the color of love  
Slips away...  
  
Tear apart hate tear apart hate  
Tear apart hate tear apart hate  
Tear apart hate tear apart hate...
