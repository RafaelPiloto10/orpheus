I want God to come and take me home  
'Cause I'm all alone in this crowd  
Who are you to me? Who am I supposed to be?  
Not exactly sure anymore  
Where's this going to? Can I follow through?  
Or just follow you for a while?  
  
Does anyone ever get this right?  
I feel no love  
  
Ain't no confusion here, it is as I feared  
The illusion that you feel is real  
To be vulnerable is needed most of all  
If you intend to truly fall apart  
  
You think the worst of all is far behind  
The vampire of time and memories has died  
I survived. I speak, I breathe,  
I'm incomplete  
I'm alive - hooray!  
You're wrong again  
'Cause I feel no love  
  
Does anyone ever get this right?  
  
Does anyone ever get this right?  
I feel no love, I feel no love
