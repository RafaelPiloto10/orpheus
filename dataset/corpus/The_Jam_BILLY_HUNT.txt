If its not you moaning, then its someone else,  
Jumping down my throat, every chance you get,  
If its not you crying, then its probably me  
you're the little dog messing up my tree,  
Billy hunt is a magical world,  
Full of strippers and long legged girls  
Clark Kent's got nothing on me,  
Ill spy like James Bond and die like King Kong  
  
[Chorus]  
Billy hunt, billy hunt, billy, billy, billy  
Billy hunt, billy hunt, billy, billy, billy  
  
I remember the first day at my job,  
I didn't get along with the foreman, bob  
Do this. do that. don't even stop for a cough.  
He used to be a sergeant in the r.a.f.  
  
No one pushes billy hunt around,  
Well they do, but not for long  
cause when I get fit and grow bionic arms  
The whole worlds gonna wish it weren't born  
  
I could be a superman  
Satisfy any whim that I wanted to,  
I could be a human machine  
I could show Steve Austin a thing or two  
  
If its not you moaning, then its someone else,  
Jumping down my throat, every chance you get,  
If its not you crying, then its probably me  
you're the little dog messing up my tree  
  
No one pushes billy hunt around,  
Well they do, but not for long  
cause when I get fit and grow bionic arms  
The whole worlds gonna wish it weren't born  
  
[Chorus]
