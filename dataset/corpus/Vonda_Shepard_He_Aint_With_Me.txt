Calling all these other guys  
I'm seeing something I didn't before  
Is that a new look in your eyes  
Now you don't believe that I'm asking for more  
  
I saw you walking down the street  
With another girl who looks just like me  
People always say we look so happy  
He took my love but he didn't take me  
  
He ain't with me he ain't with me  
He says he loves me but he don't look in my eyes  
But I'll take it 'till it's all gone 'cause  
He ain't with me, but at least I'm not alone  
  
You say you laughed with your old girlfriend  
You're doing nothing to encourage the end  
I could be charming on long distance too  
And if you want I'll make it easier for you  
  
Communication is the key  
Interrogation don't work for me  
You saw that other guy smiling at me  
If you were here I wouldn't act so free  
  
He ain't with me he ain't with me  
He says he loves me but he don't look in my eyes  
He likes to hold my hand in public  
Stranger can't you see he ain't with me  
He ain't with me he ain't with me no more  
He ain't with me he ain't with me  
  
I guess fate really has my number  
Every time you wander away  
I reconsider all the time you said you'd stay  
  
He ain't with me he ain't with me  
He ain't with me no more  
He likes to hold my hand in public  
He ain't with me he ain't with me  
But I'll take it 'till it's all gone 'cause  
He ain't with me but at least I'm not alone  
He ain't with me
