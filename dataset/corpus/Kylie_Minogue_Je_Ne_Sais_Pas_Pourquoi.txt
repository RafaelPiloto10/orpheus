Rain falling down  
Another minute passes by  
I wait for you  
But this time I won't cry  
Where are you now  
Are you with another love  
It's not the first time  
You stood me up and let me down  
  
[Chorus]  
I, I I'm wondering why  
I still love you  
Je ne sais pas pourquoi  
I still want you  
Je ne sais pas pourquoi  
  
Lights about town  
Expect me just to hang around  
And you never call  
You just stand me up and let me down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I, I I I  
  
3:  
All through the night  
I wanted you to come around  
I wait to long  
I know you're gonna let me down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I still love you  
Je ne sais pas pourquoi  
I still want you  
Je ne sais pas pourquoi  
  
I still love you  
Je ne sais pas pourquoi  
I still want you  
Je ne sais pas pourquoi
