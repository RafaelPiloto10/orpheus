Why is it I'm always chasin' after you  
Why can't it just be you that chases me  
Look through my eyes  
Can you see me  
Searchin' with nothin' in sight  
Touch with my hands can't you feel me  
Reachin' for you in the night  
  
I been trying hard to keep you satisfied  
Can't say I haven't tried ? Bet your life  
Change all my bitter to sweet love  
Change all my darkness to light  
Surrender the love you're concealing  
My love will make it alright  
  
Look through my eyes  
Can't you see me  
Touch with my hands  
Can't you feel me  
Change all my bitter to sweet love  
Make it right  
  
Baby I'm in love and I just can't stay  
Besides my love won't compromise or be denied  
  
Repeat  
  
Look through my eyes  
Can you see me  
Searchin' with nothin' in sight  
Touch with my hands can't you feel me  
Reachin' for you in the night  
Change all my bitter to sweet love  
Change all my darkness to light  
Surrender the love you're concealing  
My love will make it alright
