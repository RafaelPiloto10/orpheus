Last night I dreamt  
That somebody loved me  
No hope, no harm  
Just another false alarm  
  
Last night I felt  
Real arms around me  
No hope, no harm  
Just another false alarm  
  
So, tell me how long  
Before the last one?  
And tell me how long  
Before the right one?  
  
The story is old, I know  
But it goes on  
The story is old, I know  
But it goes on  
  
Oh, goes on  
And on  
Oh, goes on  
And on
