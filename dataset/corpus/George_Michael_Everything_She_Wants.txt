Uh huh huh,  
Oh yeah,  
Work, work  
  
Somebody told me,  
"Boy, everything she wants is everything she sees"  
I guess I must have loved you.  
'Cause I said you were the perfect girl for me,  
Maybe,  
But now we're six months older,  
And everything you want and everything you see,  
Is out of reach, not good enough,  
I don't know what the hell you want from me but boy  
  
Uh huh huh,  
Oh, oh,  
Uh huh huh,  
Doo doo doo,  
La la la la  
  
Somebody tell me,  
Won't you tell me,  
Why I work so hard for you?  
All to give you money  
All to give you money  
  
Some people work for a living,  
Some people work for fun,  
Girl, I just work for you.  
They told me marriage was a give and take,  
Well, show me you can take you've got some giving to do.  
And now you tell me that you're having my baby,  
I'll tell you that I'm happy if you want me to  
One step further and my back will break,  
If my best isn't good enough  
Than how can it be good enough for two?  
I can't work any harder than I do  
  
Somebody tell me,  
Won't you tell me,  
Why I work so hard for you?  
All to give you money,  
All to give you money  
  
Oh,  
Why do I do the things I do?  
I'd tell you if I knew.  
My God,  
I don't even think that I love you,  
Won't you tell me,  
Tell me, tell me, tell me  
  
How could you settle for a boy like me,  
When all I could see was the end of the week  
All the things we sign,  
And the things we buy,  
Ain't gonna keep us together,  
It's just a matter of time.  
  
My situation,  
Never changes.  
Walking in that manner through that door,  
Like a stranger,  
But the wages,  
I give you all you say you want is love  
  
And all I can see is the end of the week,  
All the things we sign,  
And the things we buy,  
Ain't gonna keep us together  
Girl, it's just a matter of time.
