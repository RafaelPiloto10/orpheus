Let me wrap myself around you  
You'll show me how I see it  
And when you come back in from nowhere  
Do you ever think of me?  
Your heart, not able  
Let me show you how much I care  
I need those eyes to tide me over  
I'll take your picture when I go  
Gives me strength and gives me patience  
But I'll never let you know  
I got nothing on you, babe  
But I always said I'll try  
Let me show you  
How much I care  
Sometimes it gets hard  
Don't you know?  
  
[Chorus x 3]  
Don't give the ghost up  
Just clench your fist  
You should know by now  
You were on my list  
  
Your heart, not able  
Your ways - they're not able  
Let me show you  
How much I care  
Sometimes it gets hard  
And don't ya know?  
  
[Chorus x 3]  
  
When you rock and roll with me  
There's nowhere else I'd rather be  
When you rock and roll with me  
There's nowhere else I'd rather be
