You know, it ain't no use  
Banging your head  
Up against a cold stone wall  
'Cause no one perfect  
Except for the Lord--  
Even the best's bound to fall  
  
Remember,  
He is the vine  
And you are the branch  
He loves to get you through it if you give him a chance  
You just keep doing your best  
And pray that it's blessed  
And Jesus takes care of the rest  
  
Yes the Lord said He'll take care of the rest  
He's gonna do it!  
He'll take care of the rest  
He'll see you through it, yeah  
He'll take care of the rest  
The devil blew it!  
(Old pharaoh blew it)  
(His neighbors blew it)  
Well He'll take care of the  
He'll take care of the rest  
  
You just think about Moses  
In front of the burning bush  
Barefoot on the holy ground  
You know he must've been thinking
