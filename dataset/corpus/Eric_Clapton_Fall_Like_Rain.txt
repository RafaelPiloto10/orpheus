Tell me why did I fall in love with you?  
Tell me why did I fall in love with you?  
Tore me all to pieces cut me half in two.  
  
Tell me why did I fall in love with you?  
Tell me why do my tears fall like rain?  
Tell me why do my tears fall like rain?  
Tore me all to pieces nothing else remains.  
  
Tell me why do my tears fall like rain?  
Worry worry worry  
Worry all day long.  
  
Don't know where I'm going  
Don't know right from wrong.  
  
Tell me why, tell me why.  
Tell me why, tell me why.  
  
Tell me why did I fall in love with you?  
Tell me why did I fall in love with you?  
Tore me all to pieces, cut me half in two.  
  
Tell me why did I fall in love with you?  
Tell me why do my tears fall like rain?  
Tell me why do my tears fall like rain?  
  
Tore me all to pieces, nothing else remains.  
Tell me why do my tears fall like rain?  
Fall like rain, fall like rain. [Repeat: x4]
