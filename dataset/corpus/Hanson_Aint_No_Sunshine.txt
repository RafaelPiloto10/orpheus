Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
It's not warm when she's away  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
She's always gone too long  
Any time she goes away  
  
[Repeat x2]  
Wonder this time where she's gone  
Wonder if she's gonna stay  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And this house just ain't no home  
Any time she goes away  
  
And I know [Repeat x16]  
  
And I'll leave the young thing alone  
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
Only darkness everyday  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And this house just ain't no home  
Any time she goes away  
  
[Repeat x3]  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And she's always gone too long  
Anytime she goes away
