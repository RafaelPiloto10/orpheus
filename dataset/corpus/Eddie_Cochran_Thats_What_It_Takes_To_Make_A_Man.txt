Well it seems I've had a lifetime filled with misery  
I remember how it all began  
The doctor grabbed my feet, slapped me on the cheek  
That's what it takes to make a man  
Even as a baby they were pinnin' things on me  
Daddy called me mother's little lamb  
But you should have seen 'em rave  
When I gave the dog a shave  
That's what it takes to make a man  
They thought I was a genius, when I first went to school  
Then I flunked my very first exam  
And for all the books I've read  
There' s just sawdust in my head  
That's what it takes to make a man  
Well I finally finished highschool, tried some college too  
Then I did a hitch with Uncle Sam  
I fought the enemy, sergeants I'll agree  
That's what it takes to make a man  
Well I went back to my hometown  
Where the mayor was my friend  
Said he knew a job that I could lend  
Well I got that job alright  
Cleaned the streets up every night  
That's what it takes to make a man  
Well I got a new position in a dry good store down town  
Bought my gal a golden wedding band  
But she up and fled the scene  
When it turned her finger green  
That's what it takes to make a man  
Oh yeah, that's what it takes to make a man
