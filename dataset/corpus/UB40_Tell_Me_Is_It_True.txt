Tenderly she smiles  
Forgiving my mistakes  
Getting her to love me  
Was my biggest break  
Every place I go, she's inside of me  
Giving up her love unconditionally  
She shines the sun  
She pours the rain  
She touches me in places that I can't explain  
She's got a powerful hold on me  
The kind of hold from which I'd never struggle free  
  
Tell me what you know  
Tell me is it true  
Do you really love me just like I love you  
Everything I say  
Everything I do  
It's purely 'cause' I'm aiming to get hold of you  
  
People tell her she could do better than me  
She wouldn't necessarily agree  
We've got a thing going on you see  
The two of us together for eternity  
  
Tenderly she smiles  
Forgiving my mistakes  
Getting her to love me  
Was my biggest break  
Every place I go, she's inside of me  
Giving up her love unconditionally
