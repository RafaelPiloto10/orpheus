He's a fine figure of a man and handsome too  
With his eyes upon the secret places he'd like to undo  
Still he knows who knows who and where and how  
And I hope you're happy now  
  
He's got all the things you need and some that you will never  
But you make him sound like frozen food, his love will last forever  
Still he knows what you want and what you don't allow  
And I hope you're happy now  
  
I hope that you're happy now like you're supposed to be  
And I know that this will hurt you more than it hurts me  
  
He's acting innocent and proud still you know what he's after  
Like a matador with his pork sword, while we all die of laughter  
In his turquoise pajamas and motorcycle hat  
I hope you're happy now because you'll soon put pay to that  
I knew then what I know now I never loved you anyhow  
And I hope you're happy now
