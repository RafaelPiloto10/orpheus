Do you hear that whistle down the line?  
I figure that it's engine number forty-nine  
She's the only one that'll sound that way  
On the Atchison, Topeka, and the Santa Fe  
  
See the old smoke risin 'round the bend  
I reckon that she knows she's gonna meet a friend  
Folks around these parts get the time of day  
From the Atchison, Topeka, and the Santa Fe  
  
Here she comes  
Whoo hoo hoo hoo hoo  
Hey Jim, you'd better get the rig  
Whoo hoo hoo hoo hoo  
She's got a list of passengers that's pretty big  
  
And they'll all want lifts to Brown's Hotel  
'Cause of lots of them been travelin for quite a spell  
All the way from Philadelphia  
On the Atchison, Topeka, and the Santa Fe
