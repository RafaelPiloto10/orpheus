You don't need a lover in this climate  
You don't need a boyfriend in your bed  
These days  
Pull a blanket round you baby  
If you're looking for an early grave  
Mr. Anderton will lead you to it  
He says  
Pull a blanket 'round you baby  
Some have said  
I'd go now rather than wait  
Just to sit and watch my days slip away  
So surely  
You don't need a lover in this climate  
You don't need a boyfriend in your bed  
These days  
Pull a blanket 'round you babe
