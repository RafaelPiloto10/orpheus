Clean up before she comes  
Living in a dusty town  
Something in her eyes  
Must be the smoke from my lungs  
Something in her eyes  
Must be the smoke from my lungs  
  
Twenty months has it all  
I must be getting old(3x)  
Something in her eyes  
Must be the smoke from my lungs  
Something in her eyes  
Must be the smoke from my lungs  
  
Clean up the dusty town  
Living in a dusty ton  
Clean up before she comes  
Living in a dusty town  
  
I must be getting old  
I must be getting old  
I'm starting to eat my vegetables
