What you lookin' at, girl?  
  
She's always checkin' with her penthouse eyes,  
Makes me stutter, gives me butterflies.  
Got to have her, she pins me up with her penthouse eyes.  
  
I want to lie where her eagle flies,  
She's got my love pressure on the rise.  
When I see her, she really rocks me with her penthouse eyes.  
  
Don't need excuse for graspin',  
Can't blame the boy for askin'.  
One look sting you like a honey bee,  
But it's her eyes gonna set you free.  
  
I want to stretch her out in old Levi's,  
Got to have a little piece of paradise.  
I got to have her, she pins me up with her penthouse eyes.  
  
Don't need excuse for graspin',  
Can't blame the boy for askin'.  
There's no escape let me tell you no lie,  
She's always lookin' with her penthouse eyes.
