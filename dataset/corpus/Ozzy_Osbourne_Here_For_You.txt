I remember all the good times  
Sometimes I'd wonder would it last  
I used to dream about the future  
But now the future is the past  
I don't wanna live in yesterday  
Cross my heart until I die  
Don't wanna know just what tomorrow may bring  
Because today has just begun  
No matter whatever else I've done  
I'm here for you  
I'm here for you  
  
So now I sit here and I wonder  
Whatever happened to my friends  
Too many bought a one way ticket  
But I'll be with you till the end  
  
I don't wanna live in yesterday  
Cross my heart until I die  
Don't wanna know just what tomorrow may bring  
Because today has just begun  
No matter whatever else I've done  
I'm here for you  
  
You're my religion, you're my reason to live  
You are the heaven in my hell  
We've been together for a long, long time  
And I just can't live without you  
No matter what you do  
I'm here for you  
  
I don't wanna live in yesterday  
Cross my heart until I die  
Don't wanna know just what tomorrow may bring  
Because today has just begun  
No matter whatever else I've done  
I'm here for you  
I'm here for you  
I'm here for you  
I'm here for you
