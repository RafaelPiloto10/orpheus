When it comes to affairs of the head,  
I usually find that the better hung are the well read.  
See that sat beneath the tree of thought,  
Well five'll get you ten that it's me.  
If ignorance is paradise, I don't agree.  
  
Every minute I try,  
To change my mind.  
Every minute I try,  
To change my mind.  
  
When it comes to affairs of the leg,  
Don't try to purchase life's tapestry off the peg.  
You might be sitting all alone in your room,  
Flying in an armchair ride.  
I think you'll find when you're looking out,  
You'll see inside.  
  
Something in this world has changed my mind I find,  
I took a trip to heaven on the wings of mankind.  
Something in this world makes every sense, experience,  
Take me to Utopia, to hell with the expense  
  
When it comes to affairs of the mouth,  
Come sup the sociable seminar in the deep south.  
Don't tell me that talk is cheap,  
When it's clear as my nose that it's not.  
We make up all the characters, but not the plot
