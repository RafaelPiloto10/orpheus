I'm always thinking  
Of someone new  
I'm never sitting  
OK with you  
There's always something else on my mind  
There's always something I can't find  
  
[Chorus]  
You think about anything you can  
I think about you  
I'll think about anything it's true  
  
I'm almost perfect  
Some of the time  
I'm also sinking  
Some of the time  
  
I'm almost ready  
Yeah, it's almost true  
For almost anyone but you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm always sinking  
Beneath the sand  
You're holding nothing in your hand  
  
[Chorus]
