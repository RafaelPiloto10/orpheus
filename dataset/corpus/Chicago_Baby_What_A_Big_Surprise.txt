Right before my very eyes  
I thought that you were only fakin' it  
And like before my heart was takin' it  
Baby, what a big surprise  
Right before my very eyes  
Yesterday it seemed to me  
My life was nothin' more than wasted time  
But here today you've softly changed my mind  
Baby, what a big surprise  
Right before my very eyes  
Just to be alone  
Was a little more than I could take  
Then you came to stay  
Hold me in the mornin'  
Love me in the afternoon  
Help me find my way, heh, yeah  
Now and then just like before  
I think about the love I've thrown away  
But now it doesn't matter anyway  
Baby, what a big surprise  
Right before my very eyes  
Baby, what a big surprise  
Right before my very eyes  
Baby, what a big surprise  
Right before my very eyes  
Baby, what a big surprise  
Right before my very eyes  
Baby, what a big surprise
