If you're willing to listen, I got a message for you  
Gather everybody, together there's nothing we can't do  
We must use love inspiration to elevate our minds  
Spread the information to the corners of the world  
Reach out  
You'll be amazed what you find  
When you reach out with your mind  
Reach out  
  
You're gonna find so much more  
Won't you reach out and explore  
If you are searching for something to lead you out of the dark  
Light the inner fire, if you believe it will see you through  
We must use love inspiration to elevate your mind  
Spread the information to the corners of the world  
Reach out  
  
You'll be amazed what you find  
When you reach out with your mind  
Reach out  
You're gonna find so much more  
Won't you reach out and explore  
We are one under the sun
