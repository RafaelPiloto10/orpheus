Hit me, right in the sternum this time t baby  
You already know, you already know, you already know  
This that hustler musik young Weezy got that motherfuckin' hustler musik  
So ride to it y'all, vibe to it y'all  
  
Goddamn, next they hit a nigga in his head with this one  
I'm a paint the city red wit this one  
I'm a head wit' this one  
See you fuckin' wit' the boys who tote toys way before Christmas.  
No assistance just that persistence with.  
That commitment if, I don't get it somebody gone die tonight  
I know my vibe is tight,  
And I deserve the thrown, and if the kid ain't right,  
Then let me die in this song, see I'll be ridin' (just)  
Ridin' alone wit' my daddy on my mind like you gotta be kiddin'  
How the hell you ain't here to see ya prince do his thing  
Sometimes I wanna drop a tear but no emotions from a king  
She'll be, so I be who I be that's me  
That's Weezy F. Baby and  
Please say the motherfuckin'  
So I be who I be, that's me that's Weezy F. Baby and please say the
motherfuckin'  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby you gotta know that I'm just out here doin' what I gotta do  
For me and you and we eatin'  
So bitch why the fuck is you trippin'.  
I'm takin' these chances my head to the sky, my feet on the ground  
My fingers to the judge if the money don't move  
Then I won't budge, won't budge, no I won't budge no, na  
  
Money is the motivation  
Facin' the avenue, back touchin' the wall  
Got the weed, got the gun gotta run when I hear that bird call, dang  
Hop in that thang and merk off, swerve off  
You know me, they call me "Birdman Junior"  
Anybody murderer if Birdman sponsor it  
Phantom of the opera all black gwop tent, locked in  
I can let them shots out, you can't get no shots in  
Bulletproof, leave a nigga wit' a bullet roof  
Shoot ya in ya mouth, Leroy they call 'em bullet tooth  
I'm like what it do, what it do  
There's a full court pressure  
I'm just going for the two, if I'm open for the three  
I'm a take it in a second, even if there's one second and I'm a make it, it's
nothin'  
I don't take it for granted, I don't take it for nothin'.  
I take it for what it is worth to the turf motherfucker (yea)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I ain't never killed nobody I promise, I promise if you try me  
He gone have to rewind this track and make me go back  
That thing will go blat, that boy will lay flat so flat  
That act is what I perform amongst you haters  
Got Nina in my palm and I'm masturbatin'  
Black Peter Pan flies 'til I die, what you sayin'  
Bathing Ape, Yves Saint, Evisu, what I stay in  
Got me feelin' like Scarface like the Koheba  
Streets reply I look right in a four seater  
You know I be out here ridin' a four seater  
Top floor of the four seasons, four of them whores  
And they all know how to cook it up and look I got some  
But only one know how the bag, bitch bundle up  
See its a cold world so homey bundle up  
We ain't on this grind for nothin', so get ya hustle up.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Man, man this be that hustler musik  
Young Weezy got that motherfucking hustler musik, yo  
So ride to it yo, and vibe to it yo  
I'm asking y'all please please  
Young Weezy got that hustler musik  
Young Weezy got that motherfucking hustler musik  
Ride to it yo, vibe to it yo, vibe to it yo  
Its real shit man, its real talk man, its how do it  
How did it, how done it  
Its real shit man, its real talk boy, its how do it  
How did it, how done it, I ain't braggin', I ain't boastin'  
This the way it go I ain't braggin', I ain't boastin', this the way it is  
Better guard your kids, guard your face  
Guard your body we warn the place, we here  
Fuck bitches its young money nigga
