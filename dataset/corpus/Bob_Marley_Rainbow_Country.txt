Hey Mr Music, sure sound good to me.  
I can't refuse it, wadda be gadda be.  
Feel like dancin' dance 'cause we are free.  
  
I got my own, in the promise land.  
But I feel at home, do you understand.  
Na na na naa na  
  
Though the road is rocky,  
It sure feels good to me.  
And if your lucky,  
Together we'll always be.  
  
I'll be ridin'  
Sun is a risin'  
Jah is a risin'  
  
Rainbow Country, rainbow country.
