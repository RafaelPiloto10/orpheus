My heart fell to the floor  
The night you broke the news  
Said you couldn't feel it anymore  
Those words that rolled off your tongue  
Tore my world in two  
As you turned and walked on out the door  
I've been trying to get over you  
And get on with my life  
But the more I do without you  
The more I realize  
  
I can't love you any less, no matter how I try  
You left me with a feeling, that just won't seem to die  
And it's killing me knowing, I'll never hold you like before  
I don't love you any less  
You don't love me anymore  
  
Well girl I hope you never feel  
The way I feel tonight  
It's a hopeless kind of pain  
Well I'm not even comin' close  
To gettin' over you  
Feels like it's never gonna end  
So why do I keep hangin' on  
And wastin' my time  
Wish I could let you go  
But this old heart of mine  
  
Can't love you any less, no matter how I try  
You left me with a feeling, that just won't seem to die  
And it's killing me knowing, I'll never hold you like before  
I don't love you any less  
You don't love me anymore  
  
Girl, I don't love you any less  
You don't love me anymore
