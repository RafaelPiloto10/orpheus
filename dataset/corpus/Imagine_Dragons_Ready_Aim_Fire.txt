With our backs to the wall  
The darkness will fall  
We never quite thought  
We could lose it all  
  
Ready aim fire  
Ready aim fire  
An empire is falling  
In just one day  
You close your eyes  
And the glory fades  
Ready aim fire  
Ready aim fire away  
Ready aim fire  
Ready aim fire away  
  
Off in the distance  
There is resistance  
Bubbling up and festering  
Hey Mr.Motion  
Make me a potion  
Shake it all up  
With your mistery  
How come I've never seen  
Your face round here  
I know every single face  
round here  
A man on a mission  
Changing the vision  
I was never welcome here  
We don't have the choice to stay  
We'd rather die than  
Do it your way  
  
With our backs to the wall  
The darkness will fall  
We never quite thought  
We could lose it all  
  
Ready aim fire  
Ready aim fire  
An empire is falling  
In just one day  
You close your eyes  
And the glory fades  
Ready aim fire  
Ready aim fire away  
Ready aim fire  
Ready aim fire away  
  
Checking the casing  
Shaking and pacing  
This is the tunnels life  
Blood in the writting  
Stuck in the fighting  
Look through the rifle's right  
How come I've never seen  
Your face round here  
I know every single face  
round here  
Hearing the heckle  
Holding the shackle  
I was never welcome here  
We don't have the choice to stay  
We'd rather die than  
Do it your way  
  
With our backs to the wall  
The darkness will fall  
We never quite thought  
We could lose it all  
  
Ready aim fire  
Ready aim fire  
An empire is falling  
In just one day  
You close your eyes  
And the glory fades  
Ready aim fire  
Ready aim fire away  
Ready aim fire  
Ready aim fire away  
  
Ooooohhhhh  
Oh oh  
Oooohhhhhh  
Oh ooooohhh oh  
Oh oooohhhh  
Ooooohhhhh  
  
With our backs to the wall  
The darkness will fall  
We never quite thought  
We could lose it all  
  
Ready aim fire  
Ready aim fire  
An empire is falling  
In just one day  
You close your eyes  
And the glory fades  
Ready aim fire  
Ready aim fire away  
Ready aim fire  
Ready aim fire away
