What is this? I heard you've got a new miss  
Just broke up so you know that I'm pissed  
They say your faithful I don't believe that shit oh no, oh no  
  
Bridge:  
Oh I've tried to act like I don't care  
But it doesn't seem fair you're so good to her  
And I've tried to pretend I don't see  
All those things that you do you couldn't do for me  
  
Chorus:  
I was in love wit ya  
But hell wit ya cause you didn't wanna treat me right  
I was in love wit ya  
But hell wit ya cause you didn't wanna treat me right  
Now you got another girl in your life  
Givin' her love all day all night  
I was in love wit ya  
But hell wit ya cause you didn't wanna treat me right  
  
So I hear I've met the wench before (Yeah, I remember that time we went to
Pizza Hut and you told me she was your cousin)  
I hear you learned to open doors (When did you become such a damn gentleman?)  
  
Bridge:  
Oh I've tried to act like I don't care  
But it doesn't seem fair you're so good to her  
And I've tried to pretend I don't see  
All those things that you do you couldn't do for me  
  
Chorus:  
I was in love wit ya  
But hell wit ya cause you didn't wanna treat me right  
I was in love wit ya  
But hell wit ya cause you didn't wanna treat me right  
Now you got another girl in your life  
Givin' her love all day all night  
I was in love wit ya  
But hell wit ya cause you didn't wanna treat me right  
  
What does she do to you to make you give her everything  
Like you never did for me  
Call it jealousy, but it's killing me  
Cause all the time that you were mine  
You didn't treat me right  
No, no, no you didn't treat me right, no, no, no Whoa  
  
Chorus:  
I was in love wit ya  
But hell wit ya cause you didn't wanna treat me right  
I was in love wit ya  
But hell wit ya cause you didn't wanna treat me right  
Now you got another girl in your life  
Givin' her love all day all night  
I was in love wit ya  
But hell wit ya cause you didn't wanna treat me right
