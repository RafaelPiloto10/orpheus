Good lookin' Milly's got  
A gun in her hand  
But she don't know how to use it.  
Sooner or later she'll  
Have to take a stand  
And she ain't about to lose it.  
All the towns people gather around  
They've come to see  
What's going down  
Although no one hears a sound  
There's another poor man  
Falling down.  
Falling down, falling down.  
Falling down, falling down.  
  
On this noisy shore  
Standing at the edge of you.  
Could those dreams of yours be true  
Or did you, did you, did you  
Pushed it over the end?  
How much time did you spend?  
Pushed it over the end.  
  
Good lookin' Milly's  
Into politics now  
And things are looking much better  
She keeps ten men in her garage  
Knitting her fine sweaters.  
At the end of a weary day  
She feels hard and she looks hard.  
Although no one hears a sound  
There's another poor man  
Falling down.  
Falling down, falling down.  
Falling down, falling down.  
  
I came back for more  
And found you waiting at the door  
And far inside your walls  
I called  
Did you, did you, did you  
Pushed it over the end?  
How much time did you spend?  
Pushed it over the end.  
  
How much love did you spend?  
Pushed it over the end.
