People try to take my soul away, but I don't hear the rap that they all say  
They try to tell us we don't belong, that's alright, we're millions strong  
This is my music, it makes me proud, these are my people and this is my crowd  
  
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights  
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights  
  
Sometimes days are so hard to survive, a million ways to bury you alive  
The sun goes down like a bad bad dream  
You're wound up tight, gotta let off steam  
They say they can break you again and again, if life is a radio, turn up to
ten  
  
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights  
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights  
  
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights  
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights  
  
And they try to tell us that we don't belong  
But that's alright, we're millions strong  
You are my people, you are my crowd, this is our music, we love it loud  
  
Yeah, and nobody's gonna change me, 'cause that's who I am  
  
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights  
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights  
  
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights  
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights  
  
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights  
These are crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy nights
