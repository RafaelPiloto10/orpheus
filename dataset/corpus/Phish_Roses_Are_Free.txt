Take a piece of tinsel  
And put it on the tree  
Cut a slab a melon  
And pretend that you still love me  
  
Carve out a pumpkin  
And rely on your destiny  
Get in your car  
And cruise the land of the brave  
  
And the free  
But don't forget to understand  
Exactly what you put on the tree  
Don't believe the florist when he tells  
  
You that the roses are free  
Take a wrinkled raisin  
And do with it what you will  
Push it into third  
  
If you know your gonna climb a hill  
Eat plenty of lasagna  
'Til you know that you had your fill  
Resist all the urges  
  
That make you want to go out and kill  
But don't forget to understand  
Exactly what you put on the tree  
Don't believe the florist when he tells  
  
You that the roses are free  
Throw that pumpkin at the tree  
Unless you think that pumpkin  
Holds your destiny  
  
Cast it off into the sea  
Bake that pie and eat it with me
