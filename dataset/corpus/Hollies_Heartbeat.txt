Heartbeat, why do you miss  
When my baby kisses me?  
  
Heartbeat, why does your love kiss  
Stay in my memory?  
  
Pittery-pat.  
I know that new love thrills me.  
I know that true love will be.  
  
Heartbeat, why do you miss  
When my baby kisses me?  
  
Heartbeat, why do you skip  
When my baby's lips meet mine?  
  
Heartbeat, why do you flip  
Then give me a skip each time?  
  
Pittery-pat.  
Sing to me love's story  
Bring to me love's glory.  
  
Pittery-pat.  
I know that new love thrills me.  
I know that true love will be.  
  
Pittery-pat.  
Sing to me love's story  
Bring to me love's glory.  
  
Pittery-pat.  
I know that new love thrills me.  
I know that true love will be.
