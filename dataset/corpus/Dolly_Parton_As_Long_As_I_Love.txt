Hurt is no stranger to me  
And oh how well I know misery  
You've always hurt me  
But I always forgive  
And I'll hurt for as long as I love you  
And I'll love you for as long as I live  
Oh it's my fault for loving you so deeply  
I'd give you my love completely  
I'd give you love but hurt is all you give  
And I hurt for as long as I love you  
And I'll love you for as long as I live  
  
For as long as I love you, there'll be pain  
Though tears come and go  
My love remains the same  
I'll always forgive you  
You know that I will  
And I hurt for as long as I love you  
And I'll love you for as long as I live  
  
Yes I've hurt for as long as I loved you  
And I'll love you for as long as I live
