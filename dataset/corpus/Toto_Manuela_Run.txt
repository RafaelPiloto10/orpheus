Don't look now, you better watch that sword that's hanging over you  
It's a long hard road and they will spit you out  
When they get through with you  
Don't hang your head, so the wise man said, or boy you'll soon be dead  
  
[Chorus]  
You better run, run Manuela-uela run  
They're gonna shoot you in the back with your own gun  
You better run, run Manuela-uela run, Manuela run  
  
There's no more time for living out your life, your sky is falling down  
Don't close your eyes or make a wish on three  
'Cause they will still be 'round  
Don't hang your head, so the wise man said, or boy you'll soon be dead  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't hang your head, so the wise man said, or boy you'll soon be dead  
  
You better run, run Manuela-uela run, you better run, run Manuela-uela run  
You better run, run Manuela-uela run  
(Gonna shoot you in the back with your own gun)  
You better run, run Manuela-uela run, you better run, run Manuela run  
You better run, run Manuela run  
(Gonna shoot you in the back with your own gun)  
You better run, run Manuela run
