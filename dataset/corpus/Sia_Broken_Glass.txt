[Verse 1]  
Laying down in your arms  
I don't wanna fight anymore  
Rough seas will be calm  
I'm home while we weather the storm  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
We fall down like dogs playing dead  
Well our love's not worth playing chicken, baby  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm not discarding you like broken glass  
There are no winners when the die is cast  
There's only tears when it's the final task  
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance  
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance  
  
[Verse 2]  
There's [?] in our past  
When we are where we're meant to be  
Learn things I don't ask  
[?] get her to me  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
We fall down like dogs playing dead  
Well our love's not worth playing chicken, baby  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm not discarding you like broken glass  
There are no winners when the die is cast  
There's only tears when it's the final task  
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance  
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance  
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance  
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance  
I'm not discarding you like broken glass  
There are no winners when the die is cast  
There's only tears when it's the final task  
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance  
I'm not discarding you like broken glass  
There are no winners when the die is cast  
There's only tears when it's the final task  
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance  
Don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance  
Don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance  
  
[Outro]  
I'm not discarding you like broken glass  
I'm not discarding you like broken glass  
I'm not discarding you like broken glass  
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance
