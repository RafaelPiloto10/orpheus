Bloodshot on the panicked eye  
Too gone for resolution  
Too late for the gallant try  
Or to find his own solution  
  
Pray save us or to buy the plan, vengeance is my name  
Too deep for a drowning man too deep to call him sane  
In the farthest place from you  
Where blood drips through your hands  
  
The action deafens every word  
That runs your master plan  
  
[Chorus]  
Higher, go higher  
Know you've paid for the best  
Higher, go higher  
Can't pay in cash, take a pound of your flesh  
  
Turned out where you're left to die  
Turned into this destruction  
Set free where you only fly  
To a promised resurrection  
  
Pray save me, or to find a way, bathing in my blame  
Tapped out but he has to pay, vengeance is my name  
In the closest place to you  
Where water fills your hands  
  
Your thirst is gone with every taste  
That fuels your master plan  
  
[Chorus]  
Higher, go higher  
Know you've paid for the best  
Higher, go higher  
Pay with your love, or a pound of your flesh  
  
Don't know you're fucking with the best  
All the competition laid to rest  
Humble as you crawl out of the mess  
One by one I count my pounds of flesh
