(lionel bart)  
  
Where is love?  
Does it fall from skies above?  
Is it underneath the willow tree  
That I've been dreaming of?  
  
Where is she?  
Who I close my eyes to see?  
Will I ever know the sweet hello  
That's meant for only me?  
  
Who can say where she may hide  
Must I travel far and wide  
'til I am beside  
That someone who  
I can mean something to?  
Where... Where... Is love?  
  
Will I ever know the sweet hello  
That's meant for only me
