Cinderella, stay awhile  
You're the one  
That's I'm lookin' for  
Cinderella, bring your smile  
  
All around me sunbeam's  
Start to fall  
Being my dear so near  
Please don't disappear  
Now that you are here  
Stay awhile  
  
Cinderella, I just know  
That the magic slipper's  
Going to fit  
Cinderella, do not go  
  
You're my princess  
I am sure of it  
This is love for sure  
Loving sweet and pure  
Love that will endure  
Stay awhile  
  
When you speak the angels all sing  
His is the kind og magic you bring  
  
Cinderella, stay awhile  
This is like a fairytale with you  
Cinderella, bring your smile  
  
All my fairy tales are coming true  
When my only fear  
Is being my dear so near  
Please don't disappear  
Stay awhile  
  
(Fairytales, make-believe and you)  
  
Cinderella, stay awhile  
Don't you go
