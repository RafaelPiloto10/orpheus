You should have seen him  
Lying alone in helpless silence in the night  
You should have seen him  
You would have seen his eye reflecting in the light  
  
So for the old man  
Ashes to ashes, earth to earth and dust to dust  
No one will see me  
No one with guilt to share, no secret soul to trust  
  
Louder and louder  
Till I could tell the sound was not within my ears  
You should have seen me  
You would have seen my eyes grow white and cold with fear  
  
Heard all the things in Heaven and Earth  
I've seen many things in Hell  
But his vulture's eye of a cold pale blue  
Is the eye of the Devil himself  
  
Take me away now  
But let the silence drown the beating of his heart
