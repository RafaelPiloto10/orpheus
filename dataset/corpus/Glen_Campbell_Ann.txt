I know I'll never meet another hunk of woman like my Ann  
'Cause she makes me feel like a great big man  
I'm a gonna go tell her mama what I think about her say thank you ma'am  
For giving me your daughter Ann  
  
She sure is stacked from her toes to the pretty little nape  
Of her neck she's packed like a seed in a grape she's smooth as marble skin  
When I see her I believe I'm a real young guy  
And every time I go to work I think I might die if I can't hurry home again  
  
If the good Lord worked all night a makin' me a female plan  
I'd say no thanks Lord I'll just keep Ann  
  
How could I ever look at any other woman when I've got Ann  
Oh I feel so good when she takes my hand  
I'm a gonna go tell her daddy what I think about her say thank you man  
For giving me your daughter Ann  
  
When I come home and I feel like I've been run over  
By a ten-ton truck she can rub my shoulders and soothe my aches and pains  
If I lose my job and I'm down to a silver dollar  
And I feel like a dried up gourd in a holler she soothes my brow like summer
rain  
  
If the good Lord worked all night a making me a female plan  
I'd say no thanks you Lord I'll just keep Ann  
Oh no thanks you Lord I'll just keep Ann
