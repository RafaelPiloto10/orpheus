Telephone girl talkin' to her mother's voice  
Yet she knows these days will soon be gone  
Cadillac crews take the band away tonight  
Ain't it funny how the story goes  
It's a dream I had playin' music in my band  
It's a dream I had to be happy with the woman I love  
Well if dreams came true  
And they definitely do  
For sayin' I'm a fool  
Ain't it funny how the story goes  
Ain't it funny how the story goes  
  
Hollywood queen lookin' from her lacy tomb  
It's strange to know that I can laugh at you  
Flash guitar instead of an architects tool  
Ain't it funny how the story goes  
It's a dream I had playin' music in a band  
It's a dream I had to be happy with the woman I love  
But if dreams came true  
And they definitely do  
For sayin' I'm a fool  
Ain't it funny how the story goes  
Ain't it funny how the story goes
