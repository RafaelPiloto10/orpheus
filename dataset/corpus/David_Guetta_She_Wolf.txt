A shot in the dark  
A past lost in space  
And where do I start?  
The past and the chase  
You hunted me down  
Like a wolf, a predator  
I felt like a deer in the lights  
  
You loved me and I froze in time  
Hungry for that flesh of mine  
But I can't compete with the she wolf who has brought me to my knees  
What do you see in those yellow eyes?  
'Cause I'm falling to pieces  
  
I'm falling to pieces  
I'm falling to pieces  
I'm falling to pieces  
Falling to pieces  
  
Did she lie and wait  
Was I bait, to pull you in  
The thrill of the kill  
You feel, is a sin  
I lay with the wolves  
Alone, it seems  
I thought I was part of you  
  
You loved me and I froze in time  
Hungry for that flesh of mine  
But I can't compete with the she wolf who has brought me to my knees  
What do you see in those yellow eyes?  
'Cause I'm falling to pieces  
  
I'm falling to pieces  
I'm falling to pieces  
I'm falling to pieces  
Falling to pieces  
  
I'm falling to pieces  
Falling to pieces
