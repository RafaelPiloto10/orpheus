Clenched fist - Hot blooded  
Make no mistake  
These eyes have seen what drives the blind  
I need a Cutman to bleed these angry eyes  
Hallowed are those  
They pay no price  
Ruins abound - These pawns of sacrifice  
Bleed away  
I recognize where the allegiance lies  
It's cut in stone  
Now bleed these angry eyes  
Cut in stone - Bleed - Bleed away  
Trampled are those  
They'll face our hell  
Ruins come round - These pawns will turn the tide  
Bleed away  
I recognize where the allegiance lies  
It's cut in stone  
Now bleed these angry eyes  
Clenched fist - Hot blooded  
Make no mistake  
These eyes have seen what drives the blind  
I need a Cutman to bleed these angry eyes
