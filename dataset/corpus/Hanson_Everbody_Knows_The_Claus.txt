Don't you smell the cookies he's bakin'  
Can't you see that belly, it's shakin'  
Don't take a cookie off of that pan  
You don't want to mess with this man.  
  
You've never seen this side of him before  
You know he won't be knockin' at your door  
  
Here comes Santa Claus  
Doin' all those good things  
Everybody know the cause  
Here comes Santa Claus  
You know he's the big man  
Don't mess with the boss  
  
Ask Rudolph and he won't steer you wrong  
Santa wasn't this fat all along  
Until he started cookin one day  
Don't try and take that turkey away  
  
Here comes Santa Claus  
Doin' all those good things  
Everybody know the cause  
Here comes Santa Claus  
You know he's the big man  
Don't mess with the boss  
  
Cruisin' down the air highway on his sleigh  
Bringing all the presents for the next day  
Don't forget the donuts  
  
His cookies and his milk are his pride  
Or anything that can be deep-fried  
Don't get me wrong Santa's a nice guy  
But you don't want to get on his bad side  
  
Here comes Santa Claus  
Doin' all those good things  
Everybody know the cause  
Here comes Santa Claus  
You know he's the big man  
Don't mess with the boss
