Buon Natale, means Merry Christmas to you  
Buon Natale to everyone, Happy New Year and lots of fun  
Buon Natale, may all your wishes come true  
Buon Natale in Italy means a Merry Christmas to you  
  
Far away across the sea in sunny Italy  
There's a quaint little town  
Not a clock has been wound  
For over a century  
  
They don't know the time or year  
And no one seems to care  
And this is the reason the Christmas season  
Is celebrated all year  
  
Oh, Buon Natale, a Merry Christmas to you  
Buon Natale to everyone, Happy New Year and lots of fun  
Buon Natale, may all your wishes come true  
Buon Natale to Italy means a Merry Christmas to you
