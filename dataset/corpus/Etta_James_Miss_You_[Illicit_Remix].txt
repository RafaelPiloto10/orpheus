I've been holding out so long  
I've been sleeping all alone  
'Cause I miss you  
  
I've been hanging on the phone  
I've been sleeping all alone  
I want kiss you

Well, I've been haunted in my sleep  
You've been starring in my dreams  
'Cause I miss you, child  
  
I've been waiting in the hall  
I've been waiting on your call  
'Cause I miss you  
I miss you, baby  
  
I've been holding out so long  
I've been sleeping all alone  
'Cause I miss you  
  
I've been hanging on the phone  
I've been sleeping all alone  
I want kiss you  
  
Miss you baby, miss you, baby  
Miss you, baby  
Miss you, miss you, baby  
Miss you baby, miss you, baby  
  
Baby, why do you wait so long?  
I won't to know, yeah, yeah  
Baby, why do you wait so long?  
  
Hey, come on, come on
