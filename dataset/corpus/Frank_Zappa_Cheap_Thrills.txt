Darling, darling, please hear my plea

I need it, I need it, 'cause it feels so fine now  
Cheap thrills all over the seat  
Cheap thrills, your kind of lovin' can't be beat  
Cheap thrills up and down my spine

Cheap thrills up and down my spine

Cheap thrills, how fine they are  
Cheap thrills up and down my spine  
I need it, I need it, 'cause it feels so fine  
Cheap thrills all over the seat
