Turn around and smell what you don't see  
Close your eyes it is so clear  
Here's the mirror, behind there is a screen  
On both ways you can get in  
  
Don't think twice before you listen to your heart  
Follow the trace for a new start  
  
What you need and everything you'll feel  
Is just a question of the deal  
In the eye of storm you'll see a lonely dove  
The experience of survival is the key  
To the gravity of love  
  
The path of excess leads to  
The tower of Wisdom  
The path of excess leads to  
The tower of Wisdom  
  
Try to think about it  
That's the chance to live your life and discover  
What it is, what's the gravity of love  
  
Look around just people, can you hear their voice  
Find the one who'll guide you to the limits of your choice  
  
But if you're in the eye of storm  
Just think of the lonely dove  
The experience of survival is the key  
To the gravity of love.
