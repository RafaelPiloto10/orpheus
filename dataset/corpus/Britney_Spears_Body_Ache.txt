I wanna dance till my body ache  
A little bit longer  
Turn you on, make you irradiate  
A little bit stronger  
I wanna dance till my body ache  
Show you how I want ya  
Show you how I want ya  
Show you how I want ya  
Show you how I want ya  
Till my body ache  
  
On a whole another level  
You got a one way ticket  
I got you, wild in the club  
You wanna kick it, kick it  
Start up a riot, riot  
We going down, down  
I'm all up on ya, on ya  
You want it, don't ya, don't ya?  
  
I wanna dance till my body ache  
A little bit longer  
Turn you on, make you irradiate  
A little bit stronger  
I wanna dance till my body ache  
Show you how I want ya  
Show you how I want ya  
Show you how I want ya  
Show you how I want ya  
Till my body ache  
  
I know you feel my fire  
Throw you into my flame  
Tonight we take it higher  
What I got, ain't no game  
Won't stop till you prepare me  
There'll be no turning back  
I'm gonna put it on ya  
You want it, don't ya, don't ya?  
  
You make my body ache  
You make my, you make my  
You make my body ache  
You make my body ache  
You make my body ache  
You make my body ache  
You make my body ache  
  
You make my body ache  
You make my body ache  
You make my body ache  
You make my body ache  
You make my body ache  
You make my body ache  
You make my body ache  
  
I wanna dance till my body ache  
A little bit longer  
Turn you on, make you irradiate  
A little bit stronger  
I wanna dance till my body ache  
Show you how I want ya  
Show you how I want ya  
Show you how I want ya  
Show you how I want ya  
Till my body ache  
  
Till my body ache
