All along, you did nothing wrong  
Still I'm missing something strong  
And I feel I don't belong, Oh no  
What should I do?  
But tell the truth  
  
'Cause it's been eating me away  
And I'm burning just to say  
That we can't go on this way, oh no  
What should I do? What can I do?  
  
And now I wish that I  
Could give you more, than a stone cold heart  
I wish that somebody would have told me  
Then this would have been unnecessary  
You're asking me why, but I just can't lie  
You gave me more, than a stone cold heart  
In a million years I never, ever thought we'd have to end this way  
  
Now we've come this far and we  
Find it hard to just be friends, and it's better if we end this way  
I don't wanna lead you on no more
