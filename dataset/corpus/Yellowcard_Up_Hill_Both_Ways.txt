Everytime I try to read between the lines  
I'm left wondering what I did so wrong  
Everytime I try, try to rationalize  
When everyone went wrong why didn't we die?  
Everytime I think about what it would be like  
  
Without all the things you give to me  
All these thoughts keep running through my head  
Nothing to believe  
Look back find the things I lost  
  
There's nothing left there so it seems  
Up hill both ways  
Nothing left to say  
I don't know how I made it this far  
  
I don't know how I made it last this long  
I don't know why I try  
All these things keeps going through my head  
Don't know which way to turn  
  
Each path goes up hill both ways  
Nothing but dust  
Since I learned, up hill both ways  
Nothing left to say  
  
I don't know how I made it this far  
I don't know how I made it last this long  
I don't know why I try  
Up hill both ways  
  
Nothing left to do now  
I don't want nothing today
