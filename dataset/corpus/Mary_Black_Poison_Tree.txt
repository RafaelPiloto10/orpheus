I was angry with my friend  
I told him so and my wrath did end  
I was angry with my foe  
Told him not and my wrath did grow  
  
And I watered it in fears  
Night and morning with my tears  
And I sunned it with smiles  
And with soft deceitful wiles  
  
And it grew both day and night  
Till it bore an apple bright  
And my foe beheld it shine  
And he knew that it was mine  
  
Was a poison tree  
Beware of a Poison Tree  
Poison Tree  
Growing inside of me  
  
And into my garden stole  
When the night had veiled the pole  
In the morning glad I see  
My foe outstretched  
Beneath that tree  
  
Was a Poison Tree  
Beware of a Poison Tree  
Poison Tree  
Growing inside of me  
  
Poison Tree  
Beware of a Poison Tree  
Poison Tree  
  
What happened to you  
And me
