Last night, all alone at a party  
I met a man with a drink in his hand  
He had soft brown eyes and coal black hair  
And a smile a girl could understand  
  
Then he came and sat down at my table  
And placed his warm hand on mine, now  
And I found myself wanting, longing to kiss him, yes I did  
For temptation was flowing like wine  
  
And oh I was all, almost persuaded  
To strip myself apart, apart, yes  
Oh almost, nearly persuaded now  
To push my, push my ole conscience right on the side  
  
Then we danced, then we danced, he whispered, "Baby, I need you now"  
He said to me, "Let me take you away, ooh I wanna be your man"  
Than I looked in his eyes and I saw it, yeah I saw it  
I saw the reflection of my, my wedding band  
  
Oh I was almost, almost, almost persuaded, yes I was  
To let a strange lips, somebody's lips lure me, lure me on, now  
Oh I was almost, yeah nearly, nearly persuaded  
But your, your sweet love made me stop, made me stop and go on
