I slip into my shoes and slide into the night  
I'm on the loose, you're in my sights  
You know it's gonna hurt you  
But it's just no use  
You fall in love, they always do  
And I'm waiting for the next one to fall  
  
I'm dressed to kill and you know that I will  
We're dancing in the dark with my hand's around your heart  
Our heads will roll and blood will spill  
But how can you resist  
When baby I'am dressed to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill.  
  
Another lover struggles but it's all in vein  
You wear the scars and lipstick stains  
And he can't even see he's just another one  
It's far too late  
He's too far gone.  
And I'm waiting for the next one to fall...  
  
I'm dressed to kill and you know that I will  
We're dancing in the dark with my hand's around your heart  
Our heads will roll and blood will spill  
But how can you resist  
When baby I'am dressed to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill.  
How can you resist  
When baby I'am dressed to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill.  
  
You know I'm the only one  
I can make you come undone  
You be a part of me, from now until eternity  
  
I'm dressed to kill and you know that I will  
We're dancing in the dark with my hand's around your heart  
Our heads will roll and blood will spill  
But how can you resist  
When baby I'am dressed to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill.  
Baby I'am dressed to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill, to kill.
