Tell me you believe in love  
It's not an illusion...  
  
[Verse 1: Liam:]  
I've been thinking about the nights  
And the dangerous tricks people play on the eyes of the innocent  
I could turn a lot of hearts into breaks with smoke  
And mirrors disappearing right in front of them  
  
[Hook: Harry]  
But believe me, I'm not trying to deceive you  
I promise falling for me won't be a mistake  
  
[Chorus: Zayn]  
No baby, this is not an illusion  
I've really got my heart out on my sleeve  
Oh baby, this is not an illusion  
There's magic between you and me  
No baby, this is not an illusion  
You've really got me lifted off my feet  
So tell me you believe in love  
'Cause it's not an illusion to me  
  
[Verse 2: Liam]  
You don't ever have to worry about me, about how the cards fall  
I'm all that you need tonight  
I would never turn your heart into broken parts  
You don't have to think twice looking in my eyes  
  
[Hook: Louis]  
Can't you see it? I'm not trying to mislead you  
I promise falling for me won't be a mistake  
  
[Chorus: Zayn]  
No baby, this is not an illusion  
I've really got my heart out on my sleeve  
Oh baby, this is not an illusion  
There's magic between you and me  
No baby, this is not an illusion  
You've really got me lifted off my feet  
So tell me you believe in love  
'Cause it's not an illusion to me  
  
[Bridge: Niall]  
You can tie me up in chains  
You can throw away the key  
But there's no trap doors, I'm not gonna leave  
You're the truth I can't explain  
You're the only one I see  
It's not an illusion to me  
  
[Chorus: All]  
No baby, this is not an illusion  
I've really got my heart out on my sleeve  
Oh baby, this is not an illusion  
There's magic between you and me  
No baby, this is not an illusion  
You've really got me lifted off my feet  
So tell me you believe in love  
'Cause it's not an illusion to me  
So tell me you believe in love  
'Cause it's not an illusion
