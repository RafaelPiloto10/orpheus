Stoned all the time on dandelion wine  
What else can I do  
I've been this way everyday  
now that we're through  
  
Do I love you  
You can bet your life that I do-do-do  
Do I love you  
I would drink my wine from your sh-sh-shoe  
  
Stoned all the time on dandelion wine  
It's all down to on you  
I've been this way everyday  
thinking of you  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Stoned all the time on dandelion wine  
What else can I do  
I've been this way everyday  
now that we're through
