[Fabolous - Verse 1]  
Ha ha, sicker than yo average  
Oh you think you hot  
I'll come through quicker than a maverick  
Shut ya heat down, you'll quickly be embarrassed  
Come through where you live, flick it up like Dallas  
Stick to living savage, I'll stick to living lavish  
Picking up a bad bitch, the chick look like my ad-libs (niiice)  
She calling me Fab Pitt, you can be my Jolie  
Swing big sticks, shorty you can be my goalie  
You ask too many questions, yo, you can be the police  
You know what time it is girl, you can see my Rolie  
My car like a hospital, with the windows tinted cause  
You can't see me but you know a sick nigga in it right

(Ha, sicker than ya average)  
Sicker than yo average  
(Sicker than ya average)  
Sicker than yo average  
(Sicker than ya average)  
Sicker than yo average  
(Ha, ha, sicker than ya average)  
Sicker than yo average  
Nigga working hard just to have it  
Tell you like I told my last bitch  
Sicker than yo, sicker than yo, sicker than yo  
Sicker than yo average  
  
[Red Cafe - Verse 2]  
Sicker than yo average  
Euro gang crazy, I'm in the sickest fabrics  
High every day like I'm living in the attic  
Psycho, psycho, my living room padded  
I'm sicker than magic, oh  
Stuntin' in the sickest air max, oh  
Now I'm finna pose for the flashes, hoe  
Still I put it down in the mattress  
So make that girl the opposite of Go-Go  
Go, go, dippin' from behind doing the sickest blue jays and I aint talking
Toronto  
Sicker than yo average, there he go, the finisher  
Sick hot, 200 degrees, check the temperature  
  
[Hook]
