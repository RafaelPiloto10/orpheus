Whats it to you  
If I feel now  
Just a face in the wall  
Crawling out of the ground  
Now look at me  
You cry  
Like a leaf in the fall  
I fly in the sky, dont you?  
  
Whats it to you  
This noise noise  
Like a plaque on the wall  
One of these days  
Ill just leave  
(whats it to you? )  
As boys drown  
You feel like young gods  
You know  
All young gods must fade  
(whats it to you? )  
  
Whats it to you  
Going down boys  
Like a screw in the wall  
My lovers never leave in love  
Play war like marines  
Just noise noise  
Just roar roar  
One of these days  
  
(whats it to you? )
