  
  
  
  
Some say  
  
the walls betweeen us stand so tall  
  
they don't see there's just one sun  
  
shining on us all  
  
I say  
  
we each choose roads to call our own  
  
but none of us is travelling through  
  
this universe alone  
  
and this circle  
  
just goes on and on  
  
it began before us  
  
it will be here when we've gone  
  
and this circle  
  
just goes on and on and on  
  
connecting our humanity  
  
joining me to you and you to me  
  
seasons  
  
keep spinning on the wheel of time  
  
we stand we fall  
  
we struggle up  
  
the mountains we must climb  
  
different dreams  
  
may colour what we see ahead  
  
but our lives are strong together  
  
on a common thread  
  
and this circle (circle)  
  
just goes on and on (on and on)  
  
it began before us  
  
it will be here when we've gone  
  
and this circle  
  
just goes on and on and on  
  
connecting our humanity  
  
joining me to you and you to me  
  
around and round and round and round we go  
  
around and round and round we go  
  
love and learn and change and grow  
  
round and round and round we go  
  
and this circle  
  
touches everyone  
  
as it crosses every boundary  
  
underneath the sun  
  
and this circle  
  
just goes on and on  
  
it began before us  
  
it will be here when we're gone  
  
yes this circle  
  
just goes on and on and on  
  
someday we will come to see  
  
I'm joined to you and you to me
