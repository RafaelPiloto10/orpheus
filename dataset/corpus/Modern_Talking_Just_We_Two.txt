Good guys only win in the movies  
Evil women telling stories  
There will never be another you  
It's true  
Down and out in paris city  
All the things are tough and pretty  
Stay with me until the night is gone  
  
Just we two  
Mona lisa - breaks my heart  
Just we two  
You are a lovely work of art  
Baby, just we two  
You want me and I want you  
Baby, just we two  
I don't wanna lose for you  
  
Everybody loves their lover  
Everybody's undercover  
Half a million miles I'll be from home  
Heaven must be missing an angel  
You're the hottest child of the city  
I can ask for anymore than you  
It's true  
  
Baby, just we two  
I'm a first class fool  
Baby, just we two  
All my dreams come true
