Be an Arab, Be a Jew  
Be a boxing kangaroo  
Beat yourself all black and blue  
I don't care  
  
Be a bleeder, Be a Cancer  
A hemophiliac romancer  
Be a crippled disco dancer  
Oooh... What a pair  
  
[Chorus]  
He's a model citizen  
I think I've got them fooled them again?  
He's an ultra-sweety guy  
And a master of disguise?  
He's a model citizen  
Just keep believing that my friends  
I'm a model citizen?  
  
[Bridge]  
I'm a model citizen  
I'm a model citizen  
I'm a model citizen  
I'm an all American  
  
I'm a hostage in a city of creeps  
They've got mercenary guards  
That watch me sleep  
They'd like to kill me slow  
Bury me deep  
  
In the heart of Texas  
I'm a martyr, I'm a sadist  
I might be the Savior here to save us  
I'm a friend of Sammy Davis, casually  
  
[Chorus]  
He's a model citizen  
I think I've got them fooled again?  
He's an ultra-sweety guy  
I won't let down my disguise?  
He's a model citizen  
Just keep believing that my friends  
I'm a model citizen?  
  
[Bridgex2]  
I'm a model citizen  
I'm a model citizen  
I'm a model citizen  
I'm an all American
