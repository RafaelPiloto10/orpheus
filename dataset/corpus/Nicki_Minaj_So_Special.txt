Is it wrong for thinking that I can trust you  
Never holding all this shh against you  
But now I'm strapped with my 45 special  
I'm so special, so special, so special  
Nigga you softer than a homosexual  
And I am so extraterrestrial  
So you can keep my things  
There's nothing you can bring  
And oyu can have my ring, you can add it to your bling  
Cause I'm ok and I'm still a G  
Pray for my enemies, my name's still Nicki  
In time you'll change but time don't freeze  
You better leave better fore' you get wetter than Pisces
