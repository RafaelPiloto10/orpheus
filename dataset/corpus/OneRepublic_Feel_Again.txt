It's been a long time coming since I've seen your face  
I've been everywhere and back trying to replace everything that I've had  
Till my feet went numb  
Praying like a fool that's been on the run  
Heart still beating but it's not working  
It's like a million dollar phone that you just can't ring  
I reach out trying to love but I feel nothing  
Yeah, my heart is numb  
  
But with you  
I feel again  
Yeah with you  
I can feel again  
  
Yeah  
  
Woo-hoo [x4]  
  
I'm feeling better since you know me  
I was a lonely soul but that's the old me  
  
It's been a long time coming since I've seen your face  
I've been everywhere and back trying to replace everything that I broke  
Till my feet went numb  
Praying like a fool who just shot a gun  
Heart still beating but it's not working  
It's like a hundred thousand voices that just can't sing  
I reached out trying to love but I feel nothing  
Oh my heart is numb  
  
But with you  
I feel again  
And with you  
I can feel again  
  
But with you  
(I'm feeling better since you know me)  
I feel again  
(I was a lonely soul but that's the old me)  
Yeah with you  
(I'm feeling better since you know me)  
I can feel again  
(I was a lonely soul)  
  
Woo-hooo  
  
Woo-hooo [x4]  
  
(I'm feeling better since you know me)  
(I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me)  
(I'm feeling better since you know me)  
(I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me)  
(I'm feeling better since you know me)  
(I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me)  
  
I'm feeling better ever since you know me  
I was a lonely soul but that's the old me  
A little wiser now from what you showed me  
Yeah, I feel again  
Feel again...
