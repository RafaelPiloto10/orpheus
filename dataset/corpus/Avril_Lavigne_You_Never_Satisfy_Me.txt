Excuse me sir, do I have your attention,  
There's something if you don't mind I'd like to mention,  
So open those ears, sit your butt down and shut your mouth up  
I'm aware that it's hard for you to do that,  
All I ask is lay down, put your feet up  
Now soak in, pay attention, learn a lesson loud and clear  
  
[Chorus:]  
Hey, you're a dirty liar,  
You wronged me out for something I thought was right,  
I wanted to be left alone,  
Not shown around like your golden prize  
Oh, I looked around,  
Look what happened, you found out  
You never satisfy me  
  
Never trusted anyone in the first place,  
You turned me up, your disgusting anyway  
Hear that music, crank it up,  
Is there something familiar in the singer's voice  
Turn it down, now listen to me,  
What made you think you were my authority  
I'm awake, finally now I'm able to move on (just gotta tell the truth)  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Now do these words stick to you, hope they do  
Think about it, think about it  
Stick to you like superglue, keep you from the things you do  
  
[Guitar solo]  
  
[Chorus 2x]
