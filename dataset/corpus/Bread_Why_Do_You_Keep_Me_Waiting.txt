Oh, my love, why do you keep me waiting?  
What, my love, are you contemplating?  
Time goes by still you never bat an eye,  
Tell me why, my love, do you have to stay far away?  
Late at night while I lay asleepin',  
Pale moonlight through my window weepin',  
I see you in a color fantasy, cover me  
Why, my love, do you have to fade away,  
Have to fade away? why my love, won't you tell me  
Why, my love, do you keep me waiting? why, my love,  
Are you hesitating? time goes by, are you waiting  
For another day? tell me why you think  
Time will never fade away?
