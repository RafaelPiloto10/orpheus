Chorus:  
And it's go boys go  
They'll time your every breath  
And every day you're in this place your two days nearer death  
But you go...  
  
Well, a process man am I and I am tellin' you no lie  
I work and breathe among the fumes that tread across the sky  
There's thunder all around me and there's poison in the air  
There's a lousy smell that smacks of hell and dust all in me hair  
  
Chorus  
  
Well, I've worked among the spitters and I breathe the oily smoke  
I've shovelled up the gypsum and it neigh 'on makes you choke  
I've stood knee deep cyanide, got sick with a caustic burn  
Been working rough, I've seen enough to make your stomach turn  
  
Chorus  
  
There's overtime and bonus opportunities galore  
The young men like their money and they all come back for more  
But soon your knocking on and you look older than you should  
For every bob made on the job, you pay with flesh and blood  
  
Chorus  
  
Well, a process man am I and I am telling you no lie  
I work and breathe among the fumes that tread across the sky  
There's thunder all around me and there's poison in the air  
There's a lousy smell that smacks of hell and dust all in me hair  
  
Chorus (x2)
