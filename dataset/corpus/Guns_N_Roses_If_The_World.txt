[Chorus:]  
If the world would end today  
All the dreams we had would all just drift away  
You know there's nothing more to say  
If the world would end would our love slip away  
  
I never knew the way that you looked at me  
Would ever mean so much to me  
In my heart I found the feelings that I've never shown  
Now they've got the best of me  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I never thought all the love I was looking for  
Could ever be so close to me  
Your the only one that I've ever loved that has ever loved me  
And now you've got the best of me  
  
If the world would end today  
All the dreams we had would all just drift away  
You know there's nothing more to say  
  
[Chorus:]
