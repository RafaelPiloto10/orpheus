I'm a gigolo, I'm Joseph, I'm a sad lad in song  
I'm everybody that I know  
And being known for being wrong  
  
And if I'm not mistaken  
This is my heart breaking  
I'm the man that threw it all away  
  
Destiny is calling, telling me to be boring  
And I don't care anyway,  
Gonna be nobody someday  
Gonna be nobody someday  
  
I'm the demon that you fear  
I'm the joker, I'm the thief  
I'm the lonesome cowboy ridin'  
I'm the Indian chief  
  
Gotta watch my figure  
Boy, if I get much bigger  
They'll stick a pin in me  
And I'll blow away  
  
But I get richer  
While they take my picture  
Taking my soul away  
Gonna be nobody someday  
Gonna be nobody someday  
  
I'm a moonlight serenade  
I'm your bed when you are cold  
I'm the captain of Titanic  
I'm the passenger in the hall  
  
From the way I'm thinking  
We'll both be sinking  
I knew before we sailed away  
  
Hit the tip of my eagle  
It's all you saw anyway  
Gonna be nobody someday  
Gonna be somebody  
Gonna be somebody, la la la
