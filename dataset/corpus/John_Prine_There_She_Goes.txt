There's something about her  
You know, it's the way that she carries herself  
She's just so bad  
Ooh, I don't know  
  
Her style, her mind  
Compares to nothing on this Earth  
She's not the kind to share  
Only God knows what she's worth  
  
I got to show her that I want her  
I recognize that she is bad  
If I can't have her then I'll go crazy  
Spending all my time just chasing  
  
I got to show her that I want her  
I recognize that she is bad  
If I can't have her then I'll go crazy  
Spending all my time just chasing  
  
Her eyes, her smile  
Her skin, her smell, her hair  
(She's incredible baby, ooh)  
Her walk, her talk  
Her way her savoir faire  
There she goes  
(Oh baby)  
  
I hope to find her there  
Gotta make some eye contact  
She's not the kind to stare  
Move quick or lose her fast  
  
I got to show her that I want her  
I recognize that she is bad  
If I can't have her then I'll go crazy  
Spending all my time just chasing

Her walk, her talk  
Her way her savoir faire  
There she goes

Spending all my time watching that girl go  
(Dance)  
Gotta love her when she moves  
(Get down girl)
