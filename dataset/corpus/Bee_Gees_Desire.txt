We may be big or small or black or white, eternally  
And black and white is you and me (in a special light).  
We may be young or old or in between, but this much I know  
Together we can learn to grow.  
  
In a world that's ever turning it's back on you  
If you give it all away  
Make it mine.  
  
You are desire  
Everything you need, I give you right or wrong  
And you are the woman that I base my whole existence on  
And when I get to you my desire is glowing in your light  
  
These are the golden years we get to live, we lead the way  
tomorrow we can start today (in a special light).  
Love could be good or bad or in between, but this much I know  
Baby, you and I can learn  
  
In a world that's rearranging it's reality  
If you give it all away  
Make it mine.  
  
You are desire  
Everything you need, I give you right or wrong  
And you are the woman that I base my whole existence on  
And when I get to you my desire is glowing in your light  
  
And it's nice to light a fire when it's cold outside  
If you give it all away  
Make it mine.  
  
You are desire  
Everything you need, I give you right or wrong  
And you are the woman that I base my whole existence on  
And when I get to you my desire is glowing in your light  
  
You are desire  
Everything you need, I give you right or wrong  
And you are the woman that I base my whole existence on  
And when I get to you my desire is glowing in your light
