Dear Tiffany,  
You've mad me nauseous for the last time  
Everything I've said to you, I will form a spike (to drive through my  
throat) In order to stop my words  
This time I'll put them in the ground along with my memories and my feelings  
I'll burn it down and walk away  
Let the fire warm my back  
I wish you would say you hate me  
It would make it so much easier  
Burn it down and walk away,  
Love Daniel
