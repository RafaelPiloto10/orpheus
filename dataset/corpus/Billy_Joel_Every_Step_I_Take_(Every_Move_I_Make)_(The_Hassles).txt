Everything I do  
I'm thinking thoughts of only you, girl  
Everywhere I go  
Dreams of you will always follow  
  
Every step I take, every move I make  
I'm trying to spend my life without you  
I turn, I run, I hide, but I know deep inside  
A part of me has died, yeah, yeah  
  
I closed my eyes and see  
A picture of your face before me  
Upon my lips I feel  
A tender kiss, you're almost real  
  
Every step I take, every move I make  
I'm trying to spend my life without you  
I turn, I run, I hide, but I know deep inside  
A part of me has died, yeah, yeah
