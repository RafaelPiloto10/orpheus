I can' find an elephant to tie my shoe.  
But I know what, and so do you,  
I don't need an elephant to tie my shoe  
No, you don't need an elephant to tie your shoe  
  
Oh me, oh my! What'll I do?  
I can' find a lumberjack to pour my milk.  
But I know what, and so do you,  
I don't need a lumberjack to pour my milk.  
No, you don't need a lumberjack to pour your milk.  
  
Oh me, oh my! What'll I do?  
I can' find a dinosaur to eat me up,  
But I know what, and so do you,  
I don't need a dinosaur to eat me up,  
No, you don't need a dinosaur to eat you up.  
  
Oh me, oh my! What'll I do?  
I don't have a radio to sing a song.  
But I know what, and so do you,  
I don't need a radio to sing a song.  
No, you don't need a radio to sing a song.
