How many teardrops have I cried over you  
A million and one tears a million and two  
How many nighttimes have my arms reached for you  
A million and one times a million and two  
I loved you my darling and I thought  
You loved me only me  
But you were just foolin' and the fool  
You were foolin' was me  
How many sweet dreams will never come true  
A million and one dreams a million and two  
  
I loved you my darling...
