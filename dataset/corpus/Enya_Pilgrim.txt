Pilgrim, how you journey  
On the road you chose  
To find out why the winds die  
And where the stories go.  
All days come from one day  
That much you must know,  
You cannot change what's over  
But only where you go  
  
One way leads to diamonds,  
One way leads to gold,  
Another leads you only  
To everything you're told.  
In your heart you wonder  
Which of these is true,  
The road that leads to nowhere,  
The road that leads to you.  
  
Will you find the answer  
In all you say and do?  
Will you find the answer  
In you?  
  
Each heart is a pilgrim,  
Each one wants to know  
The reason why the winds die  
And where the stories go.  
Pilgrim, in your journey  
You may travel far,  
For pilgrim it's a long way  
To find out who you are  
  
Pilgrim it's a long way  
To find out who you are  
  
Pilgrim it's a long way  
To find out who you are
