[Verse 1:]  
Create in me  
A heart that's clean  
Make my spirit new  
'Cause all I want is you  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Restore to me  
Salvations joy  
Teach me your way  
'Cause all I want is you  
All I want is you  
  
[Chorus:]  
With all my heart I will worship  
With all my soul I will sing your praise  
With everything that is in me  
I will glorify your holy name  
  
[Repeat verse 2]  
  
[Repeat chorus twice]  
  
[Repeat lots of times:]  
I will bless the Lord  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Repeat lots of times:  
I will bless the Lord
