You know, if you break my heart I'll go  
But I'll be back again  
'Cause I told you once before goodbye  
But I came back again  
  
I love you so, oh  
I'm the one who wants you  
Yes I'm the one who wants you  
Oh, ho, oh, ho, oh  
  
You could find better things to do  
Than to break my heart again  
This time I will try to show that I'm  
Not trying to pretend  
  
I thought that you would realize  
That if I run away from you  
That you would want me to  
But I got a big surprise  
Oh, ho, oh, ho, oh  
  
You could find better things to do  
Than to break my heart again  
This time I will try to show that I'm  
Not trying to pretend  
  
I want to go,  
But I hate to leave you  
You know I hate to leave you  
Oh, ho, oh, ho  
  
You, if you break my heart I'll go  
But I'll be back again
