I've been spending too much time  
Living in your world instead of mine  
Telling myself that's where I'd rather be  
Pouring the coffee and pouring the wine  
Waiting for you to have forever in mind  
So much more than childish fantasies  
  
It's the last night  
It's our last kiss  
For tomorrow I'll be gone  
It takes more than love to keep me in your arms  
It's the last night  
Come the sunrise  
You can catch me moving on  
It takes more than love to make a woman feel like she belongs  
  
See I've got dreams, I've been dreaming too  
Maybe this time I will see them through  
With a man who wants a love for keeps  
I put on my lipstick and pack me a bag  
Check my look in the mirror and call me a cab  
Gonna drive 'til your pull is out of reach  
  
Oh, it's the last night  
It's our last kiss  
For tomorrow I'll be gone  
It takes more than love to keep me in your arms  
It's the last night  
Come the sunrise  
You can catch me moving on  
It takes more than love to make a woman feel like she belongs  
  
I wish you the very best, you know I really do  
You'll find someone who has temporary dreams like you  
Baby, mine, mine go on forever  
I can feel the future and the wind inside my hair  
Something's trying to tell me there's a whole new world out there  
Baby, I'm sure it just gets better  
  
Oh, it's the last night  
It's our last kiss  
For tomorrow I'll be gone  
It takes more than love to keep me in your arms  
It's the last night  
Come the sunrise  
You can catch me moving on  
It takes more than love to make a woman feel like she belongs
