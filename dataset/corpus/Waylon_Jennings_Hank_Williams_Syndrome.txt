Ramblin' about  
Down through the South  
I find things are a changing a lot  
Especially me  
It's easy to see  
Montgomery's still hot,and I'm not  
I stopped by today  
At Hank Williams's grave  
My hero from the days of my youth  
Was that him or me  
That I used to be  
In the times when I searched for the truth  
  
[Chorus]  
Hank you were my inspiration  
And I was obsessed with your ways  
But to tell you the truth  
It's no thanks to you  
That I'm still living today  
Hank I still love your music  
And in spite of the things I've just said  
You'll always be  
A hero to me  
  
But the Hank Williams syndrome is dead  
The new hats are here  
And it's increasingly clear  
Our day is slipping on by  
They're not like me and you  
But that's alright,too  
They could keep the music alive  
  
[Chorus]
