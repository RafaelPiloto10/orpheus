On the outskirts of town, there's a little night spot  
Dan dropped in about five o'clock  
Took off his jacket, said, "The night is short"  
He reached in his pocket and he flashed a quart  
  
He hollered, "Rave on, children, I'm with you"  
"Rave on, cats", he cried  
"It's almost dawn, the cops are gone  
Let's all get Dixie fried"  
  
Well, Dan got happy and he started raving  
He pulled out a razor but he wasn't shaving  
And all the cats knew to jump and hop  
'Cause he was born and raised in a butcher shop  
  
He hollered, "Rave on, children, I'm with you"  
"Rave on, cats", he cried  
"It's almost dawn, the cops are gone  
Let's all get Dixie fried"  
  
Well, the cops heard Dan when he started to shout  
They all ran in to see what it was about  
And I heard him holler as they led him away  
He turned his head and this is what he had to say  
  
He hollered, "Rave on, children, I'm with you"  
"Rave on, cats", he cried  
"It's almost dawn, the cops are gone  
Let's all get Dixie fried"  
  
Now, Dan was the bravest man that we ever saw  
He let us all know, he wasn't scared of the law  
The black dog barked, but the boy didn't flinch  
He said, "It ain't my fault, hon, that I been pinched"  
  
He hollered, "Rave on, children, I'm with you"  
"Rave on, cats", he cried  
"It's almost dawn, the cops are gone  
Let's all get Dixie fried"

Yeah, it's almost dawn, the cops ain't gone  
And I've been Dixie fried
