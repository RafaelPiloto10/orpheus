I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream  
I know you, the gleam in your eyes is so familiar a gleam  
Yet I know it's true that visions are seldom all they seem  
But if I know you, I know what you'll do  
You'll love me at once, the way you did once upon a dream  
  
But if I know you, I know what you do  
You love me at once  
The way you did once upon a dream  
  
I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream  
I know you, the gleam in your eyes is so familiar a gleam  
And I know it's true that visions are seldom all they seem  
But if I know you, I know what you'll do  
You'll love me at once, the way you did once upon a dream  
  
But if I know you, I know what you do  
You love me at once  
The way you did once upon a dream
