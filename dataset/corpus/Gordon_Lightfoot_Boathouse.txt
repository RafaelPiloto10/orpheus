Dee dee dee, dee dee dee, dee dee dee dee  
I would rather be at the boathouse, out of the daily grind  
I'd sooner be down at the boathouse, what a way to unwind  
Now I don't wanna know how it feels to be set back  
So I'm leavin' here on a one-way track  
I'd rather be in mosquito alley, out of my right hand lane  
You'd rather see my mosquiot tally, all that moves is fair game  
Now I don't wanna know how it feels not to be loose  
So I'm leavin' here on the first caboose  
I'm leavin' here on the first caboose  
I can't sleep by a gentle ocean and I can't sleep my a water fall  
I can't sleep by a lovely river, I can't sleep and I can't sleep  
Dee dee dee, dee dee dee, dee dee dee dee  
I would rather sleep at the boathouse, what more can I say  
I'd soon eat down at the boathouse, let it carry me away  
Now I don't wanna know how it feels to step aside  
So I'm leavin' here on a wicked ride  
Or I could be back at the alehouse, with a flagon or two  
A few blocks south of the jail house, with a hole in my shoe  
Now, I don't wanna know how it feels to stop a truck  
So I'm leavin' here and wishin' you good luck  
I'm leavin' here and wishin' you good luck  
I can't sleep by a deep ocean, I can't sleep by a water fall  
I can't sleep by a lovely river, I can't sleep and I can't sleep  
Dee dee dee, dee dee dee, dee dee dee dee  
I'd rather be in mosquito alley, keepin' spiders in line  
I'd sooner be down at the boathouse, what a way to unwind  
Now I don't wanna know how it feels not to be loose  
So I'm leavin' here on the first caboose  
I'm leavin' here on the first caboose  
Dee dee dee, dee dee dee, dee dee dee dee  
Dee dee dee, dee dee dee, dee dee dee dee  
Dee dee dee, dee dee dee, dee dee dee dee
