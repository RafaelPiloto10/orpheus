I've been listening to what you said  
And wondering if it could be true  
If it's as bad as you say out there  
I'll leave the going out to you  
  
Statistics prove its not too bright  
To walk the darker streets at night  
Or to talk to people you don't know  
My worlds become a horror show  
  
There's a murder in my living room  
My child is watching avidly  
Should I venture out tonight  
Tomorrow he'll be watching me  
  
You pay your money take your choice  
But every channel plays the same  
The audience hears his master's voice  
Keeps him scared and keeps him tame  
  
I'm not believing all I see  
Fabrications on T.V.  
Distort the news, feed us your views  
I'm not fooled so easily
