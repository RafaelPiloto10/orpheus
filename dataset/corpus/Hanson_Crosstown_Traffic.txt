You jump in front of my car  
When you know all the time  
That 90 miles an hour Girl Is the speed I drive  
You tell me it's all right  
You don't mind a little pain  
You say you just want me to take you for a drive  
You're just like crosstown traffic  
So hard to get through you crosstown traffic  
I don't need to run over you crosstown traffic  
All you do is slow me down  
But I'm tryin' to get on the other side of town  
I'm not the only soul who's accused of hit and run  
Tire tracks all across your back I can see you've had your fun  
But a-darling  
Can't you see my signal's turn from green to red  
And with you I can see a traffic jam straight ahead  
You're just like crosstown traffic  
So hard to get through you crosstown traffic  
I don't need to run over you crosstown traffic  
All you do is slow me down  
But I got better things on the other side of town  
Yeah Yeah Crosstown traffic  
Look out look out Look out Baby  
Coming through crosstown traffic  
Yeah Yeah Look out crosstown traffic  
Yeah Yeah look out Look out Look out Baby  
Crosstown traffic look out yeah
