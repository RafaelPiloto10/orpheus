I was walkin' down the street  
Concentratin' on truckin' right  
I heard a dark voice beside of me  
And I looked 'round in a state of fright  
I saw four faces one mad a brother from the gutter  
They looked me up and down a bit and turned to each other  
  
(I say) I don't like cricket, a oh no I love it, a yeah  
I don't like cricket-a no no I love it-a yeah  
  
Don't you walk through my words you got to show some respect  
Don't you walk through my words 'cause you ain't heard me out yet  
  
Well he looked down at my silver chain  
He said "I'll give you one dollar"  
I said "you've got to be joking man  
It was a present from me mother"  
He said "I like it I wan' it I'll take it off your hands  
An' you'll be sorry you'd crossed me  
You'd better understand that you're a long, a long way from home"  
  
(And I say) I don't like reggae, a no no I love it, a hey  
I don't like reggae, a yeah yeah I love it-a oh yeah  
  
Don't you cramp me style don't you queer me pitch  
Don't you walk through my words 'cause you  
Ain't heard me out yet  
  
I hurried back to the swimming pool  
Sinkin' pina colada  
I heard a dark voice beside me say  
"would you like something hotter"  
She said "I've got it you wan' it my harvest is the best  
And if you try it you'll like it and wallow in the  
Dreadlock holiday, dreadlock holiday, dreadlock holiday"  
  
(And I say) don't like jamaica oh no I love her hey  
Don't like jamaica oh no I love her oh yeh  
  
Don't you walk through my words you got to show some respect  
Don't you walk through my words 'cause you ain't heard me out yet  
  
I don't like cricket-a oh no I love it-a dreadlock holiday  
I don't like reggae-a oh no I love it-a dreadlock holiday  
Don't like jamaica hey I love her dreadlock holiday  
I don't like cricket-a oh no I love it-a dreadlock holiday  
I don't like reggae
