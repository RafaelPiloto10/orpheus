I see you laughing up at me, and i can't hide  
What it is that you can see  
I guess that's why  
I'm holding out my love for you  
And when you turn it around  
In different ways  
The answers turn around and fly away  
  
I see you laughing up at me  
And i can't hide  
What it is that you can see  
I guess that's why  
I'm holding out my love for you  
  
A lifelong history  
Of trust in vain  
I lead the fools' parade  
Out in the rain  
  
I see you laughing up at me  
''cause you don't seem to care  
But oh how happy i can be  
When you are there  
  
That's why i'm holding out  
My love for you
