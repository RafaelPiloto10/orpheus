They act like they can have any girl they choose.  
They've got tricks, but my baby got wise,  
So in case you haven't heard the news,

She doesn't like the rough guys.  
So find some one you own size,  
'Cause she's not afraid of you.  
  
She doesn't like the tough guys.  
She thinks that they've got brains all where they sit.  
They think they're full of fire,  
She thinks they're full of shit.
