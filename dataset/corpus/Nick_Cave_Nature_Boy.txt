I was just a boy when I sat down  
To watch the news on tv  
I saw some ordinary slaughter  
I saw some routine atrocity  
My father said, don't look away  
You got to be strong, you got to be bold, now  
He said, that in the end it is beauty  
That is going to save the world, now  
  
And she moves among the sparrows  
And she floats upon the breeze  
She moves among the flowers  
She moves something deep inside of me  
  
I was walking around the flower show like a leper  
Coming down with some kind of nervous hysteria  
When I saw you standing there, green eyes, black hair  
Up against the pink and purple wisteria  
You said, hey, nature boy, are you looking at me  
With some unrighteous intention?  
My knees went weak,  
I couldn't speak, I was having thoughts  
That were not in my best interests to mention  
  
And she moves among the flowers  
And she floats upon the smoke  
She moves among the shadows  
She moves me with just one little look  
  
You took me back to your place  
And dressed me up in a deep sea diver's suit  
You played the patriot, you raised the flag  
And I stood at full salute  
Later on we smoked a pipe that struck me dumb  
And made it impossible to speak  
As you closed in, in slow motion,  
Quoting Sappho, in the original Greek  
  
She moves among the shadows  
She floats upon the breeze  
She moves among the candles  
And we moved through the days  
And through the years  
  
Years passed by, we were walking by the sea  
Half delirious  
You smiled at me and said, Babe  
I think this thing is getting kind of serious  
You pointed at something and said  
Have you ever seen such a beautiful thing?  
It was then that I broke down  
It was then that you lifted me up again  
  
She moves among the sparrows  
And she walks across the sea  
She moves among the flowers  
And she moves something deep inside of me  
  
She moves among the sparrows  
And she floats upon the breeze  
She moves among the flowers  
And she moves right up close to me
