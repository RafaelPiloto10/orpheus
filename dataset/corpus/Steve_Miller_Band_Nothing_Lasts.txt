All the things you think and say  
Float away into space  
Done in thought or done in haste  
They have no place, they leave no trace  
All the things you think and do  
Have become a part of you  
All your deeds have come to pass  
Nothing lasts, nothing lasts  
Like a river flowing past your windowpane  
Life's never the same  
Like the sun you're born to set  
You'll die in sin  
And be born once again  
Now you know, so damn well  
That your life is a heaven and a hell  
And it's very easy to tell  
When you're sick and when you're well  
So the secret to this life  
Is so very easy to learn  
If you ever love another  
Never ask for anything in return  
Like a river flowing past your windowpane  
Life's never the same  
Like the sun you're born to set  
You'll die in sin  
And be born once again  
All the things you think and say  
Float away into space  
Done in thought or done in haste  
They have no place, they leave no trace  
All the things you think and do  
Have become a part of you  
All your deeds have come to pass  
Nothing lasts, nothing lasts
