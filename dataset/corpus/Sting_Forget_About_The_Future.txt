I know we got some history  
We got some issues that we need to solve  
But is it really such a mystery?  
It's just the way that the world evolves  
Let me ask your forgiveness baby  
My heart is ever full of sorrow  
We got to move into the future maybe  
And think about a new tomorrow  
  
She said you know I used to love you baby  
But you're thinking way too fast  
So forget about the future  
And let's get on with the past  
  
So they called a 'nited nations summit  
To negotiate for peace on earth  
And it may be idealistic baby  
But I know what peace of mind is worth  
Everybody aired their grievances  
And they threw away the suture  
They opened up all the wounds of the past  
As they failed to find their way to the future  
  
They said we'd better check the weather chart  
Before we tie our colors to this mast  
It's just too hard thinking about the future baby  
So let's just get on with the past  
  
She said we'd better check the horoscope honey  
Just in case this feeling wasn't meant to last  
It's just too hard thinking about the future  
So let's just get on with the past  
  
How many times you ever hear me say  
I'm as flawed as any other human being?  
There simply has to be a different way  
And a whole new way of seeing  
Are we doomed by all our history?  
Is our love really beyond repair?  
It's getting close to midnight baby  
And we ain't got time to spare  
  
Just when I think I'm home and dry  
And she's given up the fight  
There's an unmistakable optimism  
In romantic music and candlelight  
There's this lingering perfume  
The merest ghost of the past  
She says wait a minute baby  
You're moving way too fast  
We'd better check the weather chart  
Before we raise this mast  
We'd best consult our horoscope  
In case this feeling wasn't meant to last  
Let's just forget about the future  
And get on with the past
