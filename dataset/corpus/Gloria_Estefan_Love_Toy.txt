(Doo wop bop)  
When it comes to boys  
Mamma always said  
"Never let any temptation go to your head"  
(Doo wop bop)  
Oh, but it's so tempting so delicious  
When I kiss your lips  
When I feel your fingertips  
'Cause ooh, you're my love toy  
(No batteries required)  
Ooh, you're my love toy  
(Wind me up and I start to move)  
Ooh, you're my love toy  
(No batteries required)  
No, no, no I'd be so ashamed  
Besides I've got my reputation to maintain  
Must you be so darn persistent  
Tryin' to make me weak  
'Bout to knock me off my feet  
Ooh, you're my love toy  
(No batteries required)  
Ooh, you're my love toy  
(Wind me up and I start to move)  
Ooh, you're my love toy  
(No batteries required)  
(Doo wop bop)  
(Ooi ooi doo wop, doo wop bop)  
You are always on the sly  
When I see you smiling  
With that look in your eyes  
Whispering those little secrets  
You really turn me on  
(Doo wop bop)  
Makes me wanna have more fun  
Ooh, you're my love toy  
(No batteries required)  
Ooh, you're my love toy  
(Wind me up and I start to move)  
Ooh, you're my love toy  
(No batteries required)  
Ooh, que rico  
(Ooi ooi doo wop bop)  
No batteries required  
(Ooi ooi doo wop bop)  
Love toy  
(Ooi ooi doo wop bop)  
No batteries required  
(Ooi ooi doo wop bop)  
Love toy  
Love toy
