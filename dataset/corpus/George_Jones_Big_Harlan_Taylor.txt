[Chorus]  
Oh the ways of the world, and the wants of a woman  
If I figured them all out 'twould take many years  
  
I once had a sweetheart, the fairest of maidens  
She out shined all others that I'd known by far  
I had a friend, a big fella, named big Harlan Taylor  
Harlan had a rubber-tired, new shiny car  
  
[Chorus]  
  
By the wants of a woman she fell for big Harlan  
I tried, but in vain, for to take my own life  
Suddenly I had lost all my will to keep livin'  
She lost her desire to become my young wife  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I wanted revenge and waylaid for big Harlan  
Then I started wonderin' what good would it do  
If a rubber-tired, new shiny car's her ambition  
Then she can just have it and big Harlan, too  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If I figured them all out
