Just another voice in the wilderness  
Just another cry for peace  
Just another voice full of loneliness  
Just another prayer for release  
Look up! Look out! Look in! Look all about  
Look everywhere but look at yourself  
Hold on! Hold up! Hold out! Hang in  
Please everyone, but please yourself  
And try to make the world a better loving, living  
Peaceful place.  
  
There's too many fat, there's too many thin  
There's too many outside trying to get in  
There's too many trapped  
There's too many pinned  
There's too many winters that should have been springs,  
Now  
Get in! Get up! Get it out! Get it on  
Get everything you can for free  
Look in! Look up! Look out! Look back  
Look everywhere, but don't look for me  
And try to make the world a better loving, living  
Peaceful place  
Please!  
  
It's nothing but a look in a two-way mirror  
It's just another cow in the corn  
It's just another gift for the Indian giver  
It's just another blow on the horn  
Look in! Look out! Look up! Look down  
Look everywhere, but don't look for me  
Get it in! Get it up! Get it out! Get it on  
Get everything you can for free  
And make the world a better loving, living, giving  
Peaceful place.
