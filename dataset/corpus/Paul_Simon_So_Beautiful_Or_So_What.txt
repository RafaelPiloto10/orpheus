I'm gonna make a chicken gumbo  
Toss some sausage in the pot  
I'm gonna flavor it with okra  
Cheyenne pepper to make it hot  
You know life is what we make of it  
So beautiful or so what  
I'm gonna tell my kids a bedtime story  
A play without a plot  
Will it have a happy ending?  
Maybe yeah, maybe not  
I tell them life is what you make of it  
So beautiful or so what  
So beautiful, so beautiful  
So what  
  
I'm just a raindrop in a bucket  
A coin dropped in a slot  
I am an empty house on Weed Street  
Across the road from a vacant lot  
You know life is what you make of it  
So beautiful, or so what  
  
Ain't it strange the way we're ignorant  
How we seek out bad advice  
How we jigger it and figure it  
Mistaking value for the price  
And play a game with time and love  
Like a pair of rolling dice  
So beautiful, so beautiful  
So what  
  
Four men on the balcony  
Overlooking the parking lot  
Pointing at a figure in the distance  
Dr. King has just been shot  
And the sirens long melody  
Singing savior pass me not  
Ain't it strange the way we're ignorant  
How we seek out bad advice  
How we jigger it and figure it  
Mistaking value for the price  
And play a game with time and love  
Like a pair of rolling dice  
So beautiful, so beautiful  
So beautiful
