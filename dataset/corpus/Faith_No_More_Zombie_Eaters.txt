You're everything  
That's why I cling to you  
When I emerge  
My thoughts converge to you  
  
To you  
The world is so small  
Compared to you  
And everybody's wrong  
  
Compared to you  
To you  
I begin to see through your eyes  
All the former mysteries are no surprise  
  
So now, you listen  
'Cause I'm omniscient  
Hey look at me lady  
I'm just a little baby  
  
You're lucky to have me  
I'm cute and sweet as candy  
As charming as a fable  
I'm innocent and disabled  
  
So hug me and kiss me  
Then wipe my butt and piss me  
I hope you never leave  
'Cause who would hear me scream?  
  
Nobody understands  
Except the toys in my hands  
So now you listen  
'Cause I'm omniscient  
  
Hey look at me lady  
I'm just a little baby  
If I smile, then you smile  
Then I'll get mad for awhile  
  
I melt in your mouth  
And in your hands whenever I can  
But I really do nothing  
Except kickin' and fussin'  
  
I like to make a mess  
I laugh at your distress  
I sit all day in my crib  
Absorbing all you give  
  
I'm helpless  
I'm flawless  
I'm a machine  
Give me, I need my toys  
  
Keep me hot  
Keep me strong  
Keep me everlong  
So now you listen  
  
'Cause I'm omniscient
