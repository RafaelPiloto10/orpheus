Two room house on an acre lot, it ain't much but it's all they've got  
Boy, sometimes it sure seems a lot to keep up on her own  
A pile of bills and a load of clothes, wipin' tears from a two year old  
And makin' sure supper's on before he makes it home  
In her mind she hears him say, ?I'm gonna make it better someday?  
  
He will, she knows  
He's gonna build their dreams a little further down the road  
Her faith, it shows even if the whole world says he won't  
He will, she knows  
  
He spends all day under a hood makin' Chevrolet's run like they should  
He don't like it much, but the pay is good and that's enough to make him stay  
He's workin lot's of overtime ?cause he's got a little plan in mind  
For a hill off highway 109 that he drives by everyday  
Sometimes money's hard to save but if anyone can find a way  
  
He will, she knows  
He's gonna build their dreams a little further down the road  
Her faith, it shows even if the whole world says he won't  
He will, she knows  
  
Every night he holds her close and she believes  
If anyone can make it more than just a dream  
  
He will, she knows  
He's gonna build their dreams a little further down the road  
Her faith, it shows even if the whole world says he won't  
He will, she knows
