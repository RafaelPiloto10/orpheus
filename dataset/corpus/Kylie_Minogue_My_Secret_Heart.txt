I look at your picture  
And stare into space  
I think I must know  
Every line on your face  
And you'll never know  
The feelings I keep  
Like the man in the moon  
You're way out of reach  
  
So dreams are all I have  
Because we're worlds apart  
All alone with my secret heart  
  
I write you these letters  
That I'll never send  
It's crazy I know  
But still I pretend  
Though we've never met  
Don't think I'm naive  
I know you so well  
Though it's all make believe  
  
And dreams are all I have  
Because you're far away  
All alone with my secret heart  
All alone with my secret heart  
  
I must have held your hand  
A thousand times  
And felt your heart was beating  
Next to mine  
Even though it's just a lie  
There are no tears in my eyes  
  
If your picture could speak to me  
What would you say  
Maybe you'd just have to  
Laugh in my face  
  
And dreams would be much better  
Than reality  
  
All alone with my secret heart
