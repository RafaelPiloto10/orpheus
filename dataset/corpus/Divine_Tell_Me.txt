Ooh baby tell me why  
You could look me in the eye  
Swear on us that you're not seeing someone else  
The way you hold me strange  
Know your lips don't feel the same  
You got an attitude I know there's someone new  
Baby don't lie  
You know I get all sensitive and hurt inside  
Darling tell me now  
If you want my loving  
Got to show me what you're all about  
  
Tell me now what you want  
Is it me or someone new  
Tell me now what you gonna do  
I can't take no more, 'cause I'm bout through  
Tell me now what you want  
Is it me or someone new  
Tell me now what you gonna do  
  
I can't take no more, 'cause I'm 'bout through  
You cannot hide the feeling you feel inside  
Cause you were the one who let me know that true love is genuine  
Why are you using me can't give up abusing me  
If you don't want me don't pretend we're meant to be  
Baby, don't lie  
You know I get all sensitive and hurt inside  
Darling, tell me now  
If you want my loving  
Got to show me what you're all about  
  
Tell me now what you want  
Is it me or someone new  
Tell me now what you gonna do  
I can't take no more, 'cause I'm bout through  
Tell me now what you want  
Is it me or someone new  
Tell me now what you gonna do  
  
Hand that tell me you're unsure  
Lips that I can't kiss no more  
Eyes that cut me up inside  
Can't take no more can't take no more  
Tell me why I ache inside  
Visions of you in my mind  
Kissing, hugging, hurt so tight  
Can't take no more, can't take no more  
  
Tell me now what you want  
Is it me or someone new  
Tell me now what you gonna do  
I can't take no more, 'cause I'm bout through  
Tell me now what you want  
Is it me or someone new  
Tell me now what you gonna do
