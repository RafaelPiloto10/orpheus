She would never say where she came from  
Yesterday don't matter 'cause it's gone  
While the sun is bright or in the darkest night  
No one knows she comes and then she goes  
  
Goodbye, ruby Tuesday  
Who is gonna hang a name on you?  
And when you change with every new day  
Still I'm gonna miss you  
  
Don't ask her why she needs to be so free  
She's gonna tell you it's the only way to be  
She just can't be chained to a life where nothing's gained  
And nothing's lost but such a cost  
  
Goodbye, ruby Tuesday  
Who is gonna hang a name on you?  
And when you change with every new day  
Still I'm gonna miss you  
  
There's no time to lose, I heard her say  
You gotta catch your dreams before it run away  
Dying all the time, lose your dreams  
And you might lose your mind is life unkind?  
  
Oh, goodbye, ruby Tuesday  
Who is gonna hang a name on you?  
And when you change with every new day  
Still I'm gonna miss you  
  
Oh, goodbye, ruby Tuesday  
Who is gonna hang a name on you?  
And when you change with every new day  
Still I'm gonna miss you  
  
Goodbye, ruby Tuesday, goodbye, ruby Tuesday  
Goodbye, ruby Tuesday, goodbye, ruby Tuesday  
Goodbye, ruby Tuesday, goodbye, ruby Tuesday
