Aw milk cow blues yeah  
Aw Larry!  
Ah Tim, c'mon tell 'em now!  
  
I woke up this mornin'  
Looked out my door  
I can tell my milk cow  
I can tell by the way she lows  
If you see my milk cow  
Please drive her on home  
'Cause I ain't had no milk and butter  
Since my milk cow's been gone  
  
Well you gotta treat me right woman  
Day by day  
Get out your little prayer book  
Get down on your knees and pray  
You're gonna need, you're gonna need  
My help one of these days  
You're gonna be sorry  
You treated me this way  
  
I said well good evening  
Don't that sun look good going down  
I said well good evening  
Don't that sun look good going down  
And don't my home look lonesome  
When my lover ain't around  
  
Low  
You know what low means  
  
Sail on, sail on, sail on little girl, sail on  
Sail on, sail on, sail on little girl, sail on  
You're gonna keep right on sailing  
Till you lose your happy home  
  
Well I tried everything baby  
To get along with you  
Now tell me brother Tim  
What are you going to do?  
  
I'm gonna stop cryin'  
Gonna leave you alone  
If you don't think I'm leavin'  
You can count the days I'm gone  
You're gonna need me, baby  
You're gonna need my love someday  
You're gonna be sorry  
You treated me this way  
Ah milk cow blues  
Ah milk cow  
Come on home
