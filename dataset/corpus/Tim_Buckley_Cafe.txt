I was just a curly-haired mountain boy  
On my way  
Passing through I heard a voice  
Whisper good evening  
I turned to a shadow  
And saw her there  
So all alone  
She had those sad china eyes  
That sang each time she smiled  
Ah, but the song  
It seemed to linger  
So long it deepened  
My love for her  
Until she called me near  
And then we waltzed to our heart beat  
All around  
The sea was swaying  
The breeze was praying  
Never to leave her alone  
Alone  
Oh, the time just slipped on by  
And with the time  
So did our love  
Ah, her every move  
Just like a fever  
Just like a fever  
Burnin' inside would not leave me
