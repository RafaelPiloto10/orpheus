How can I be sure you're being honest with me can I take your love for truth  
There comes a time in every woman's life when she needs a little proof  
So show me something different something I ain't never seen before  
This time instead of gettin' up and goin' home to her just get up and close
the door  
Just get up and close the door  
And say you'll stay with me tonight say you won't regret the morning light  
Then I'll believe the words of love you've said to me before  
If you'll just get up and close the door  
This time instead of gettin' up and goin' home to her just get up and close
the door
