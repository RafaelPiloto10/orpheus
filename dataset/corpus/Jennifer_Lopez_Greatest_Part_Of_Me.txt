Oooohhhh, ooohhh oohh...  
Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh  
  
Where would I be without you honey  
Baby I'm me, all because I love you  
Oh you know the cars and the clothes and the cribs and the bankrolls  
Are nothing without your loving  
Although you might hear that in every love song  
It's just what I feel so I'm gonna keep on, keep on, singing your praises in
everyway I can think of  
And this is what I mean love  
  
Chorus:  
When I see you baby, I see my better ha-a-alf  
When I see you baby, I just gotta tip my ha-a-at  
Cause when I see you baby, I'm seeing the flyest, the freshest, the finest,
the best  
You're the highest, you're the greatest part of me  
And darling you are fi-i-ine  
When I see you baby, I just can't believe you're mi-i-ine  
Cause when I see you baby, I'm seeing the flyest, the freshest, the finest,
the best  
You're the highest, the greatest part of me  
  
Bridge:  
I said you're the shhhhh and here's my proclamation  
My way of saying thank you for your dedication  
Now I can spend the rest of my life sitting high up on cloud nine  
And all because I know I'm your lady  
And no don't nothing get better than this we steady stacking chips together  
Coping gifts and taking trips and spend it on each other  
No other can do-do what you do, cause baby you're the truth and that's why I
gotta tell you that...  
  
Chorus:  
When I see you baby, I see my better ha-a-alf  
When I see you baby, I just gotta tip my ha-a-at  
Cause when I see you baby, I'm seeing the flyest, the freshest, the finest,
the best  
You're the highest, you're the greatest part of me  
And darling you are fi-i-ine  
When I see you baby, I just can't believe you're mi-i-ine  
Cause When I see you baby, I'm seeing the flyest, the freshest, the finest,
the best  
You're the highest, the greatest part of me  
  
Oh-oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oohhh (the greatest part of me)  
Oh-oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oohhh, see when I'm looking at you baby, all
I see is... the greatest part of me  
Oh-oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ooohhh, the greatest part of me.  
Oh-oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ooohhh (the greatest part of me)  
Oh-oh-oh-oh... oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ooohhh x2
