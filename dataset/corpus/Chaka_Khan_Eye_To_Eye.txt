I'm in the mood to end these empty days  
Ever when I, you stare down, romancin'  
Everytime I see your face, hopeless - colder than ice  
With no more flame  
I think our love has reached the part of no return  
It?s so sad when lovers don't see  
  
Eye to eye, a look says everything  
Eye to eye, so close, so far away  
  
That distant look is all you've got to say  
Everytime I try to talk to you  
Every word is lost in space  
Drifting further apart in every way  
We've come to be the ones that love is out of sight  
It's so clear that we just don't see  
  
Eye to eye, a look says everything  
Eye to eye, so close, so far away  
  
There's no reason for this heartache  
To go on and on, when the feeling?s gone  
I can say now, that it's to late  
To try and change your mind  
  
Eye to eye, a look says everything  
Eye to eye, so close, so far away
