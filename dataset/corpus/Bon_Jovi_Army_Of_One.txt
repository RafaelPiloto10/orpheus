I'm in this world  
I've got no fun  
Still standing strong  
In army of one  
So sign me up  
I'm a soldier  
  
I've got a voice  
It's all on me  
A beating heart inside of me  
I'm an army of one  
I'm a soldier  
  
These eyes don't know disguise  
They're fighting for their all lives  
They're all trying to get back home tonight  
  
Never give up  
Never give up, Never  
Never give up  
Never let up, Ever  
Never give in  
You're an army of one  
  
Never give up  
Never give up, Never  
Never forget  
Where you're from  
Never give up  
You're an army of one  
  
I can't hurt but I still feel  
I know that life's a battlefield  
When a time get tough  
I'm a soldier  
  
When it's time to the fight  
It's just my side right on my side  
I'm an army of one  
I'm a soldier  
  
Never give up  
Never give up, Never  
Never give up  
Never let up, Ever  
Never give in  
You're an army of one  
  
Never give up  
Never give up, Never  
Never forget  
Where you're from  
Never give up  
You're an army of one  
  
No apologize  
Defend for being alive  
We're all trying  
To get it right tonight  
  
Never give up  
Never give up, Never  
Never give up  
Never let up, Ever  
Never give in  
You're an army of one  
  
Never give up  
Never give up, Never  
Never forget  
Where you're from  
Never give up  
You're an army of one
