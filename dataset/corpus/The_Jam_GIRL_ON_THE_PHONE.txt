Girl on the phone keeps a-ringing back  
Her voice is smooth but the tone is bland  
She's telling me this and she's telling me that  
She talks about me and I must agree  
With what she says about me  
About how nice I can be  
But it makes no difference to my mind  
  
Girl on the phone keeps a-ringing back  
She knows all my details - she's got my facts  
She tells me my height and she knows my weight  
She knows my age and says she's knows fate  
  
And I must say - its logical  
What foresight she must have  
I've got to meet her whenever I get time  
  
Says she knows everything about me  
Every word I've ever said  
Every book I've ever read  
She told me that we met along time ago  
I can't think when but she should know  
  
Girl on the phone keeps a-ringing back  
Knows where I get my shirts and where I get my pants  
Where I get my trousers where I get socks  
My leg measurements and the size of my cock  
  
And I must say its un-nerving  
To think that she knows me  
Knows me so well - better than anyone  
Better than myself  
  
Says she knows everything about me  
Every record I've listened to  
Every window that I've looked through  
She told me that we met along time ago  
I can't think when but she should know  
  
Girl on the phone keeps a-ringing back  
She's telling me this and she's telling me that
