These are the best times  
That you'll ever have  
Don't throw it away because  
You're younger that he is  
  
[Chorus]  
He's your father  
And he'll help you  
If you give him  
He's your father  
He'll deserve you  
If you give him time  
  
These are the best times  
So we'll march in time  
The sun is too ripe to let  
The moon shine on your eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
These are the straight ways  
Don't make it long  
Don't get yourself lost because  
You're following someone else's song  
  
[Chorus]
