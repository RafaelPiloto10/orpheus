After you're gone, babies  
Ride the soft machine  
Threading the warm children  
Down the space between  
Into a slow heaven  
Hanging by a thread  
Leaving the still living  
For the walking dead  
It took so long  
To find my way out of here  
Out of the warm night, to the hard light  
Shivering with fear  
After you're gone, babies  
Crawling on the world  
Touching the souls of all the lonely  
Carefree boys and girls  
Daddy needs you  
Mamma feeds you  
And they come until they go  
But if I'm lonely, I'm the only one who knows  
It took so long  
To find my way out of here  
Out of the warm night, to the hard light  
Shivering with fear  
After the slow lonely waiting  
I'm all alone, alone and free  
If you see me, please believe me  
I wannna be  
After you're gone, babies  
Screaming at the rain  
Hanging a slow heaven  
In the wind again  
She's been waiting  
270 days  
Sick of waiting  
When you see me  
Please believe me  
I'm the only one who cares at all  
[chorus]  
After the slow lonely heaven  
I'm all alone, alone and free  
If you see me  
Please believe me  
I wanna be  
After you're gone...
