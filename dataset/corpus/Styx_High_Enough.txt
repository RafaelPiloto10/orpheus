I don't want to hear about it anymore  
It's a shame I've got to live without you anymore  
There's a fire in my heart,a pounding in my brain's driving me crazy  
  
We don't need to talk about it anymore  
Yesterday's just a memory can we close the door  
I just made one mistake,I didn't know what to say when you called me,baby  
  
Don't say goodnight,say your gonna stay forever  
All, all the way  
  
Can you take me high enough  
To fly me over yesterday  
Can you take me high enough  
It's never over yesterday's just a memory  
Yesterdays just a memory  
  
And I don't want to live without you anymore  
Can't you see I'm in misery and you know for sure  
I would live and die for you and I know just what to do when you call me,baby  
  
Don't say good-bye,say your gonna stay forever  
All, all the way  
  
Can you take me high enough  
Can you fly me over yesterday  
Can you take me high enough  
It's never over,yesterday's just a memory away  
  
I was running for the door  
And next thing I remember  
I was running back for more  
  
Don't say good-bye,say your gonna stay forever  
All, all the way  
  
Can you take me high enough  
Can you fly me over yesterday  
Can you take me high enough  
It's never over,whoa whoa whoa  
  
Can you take me high enough  
Won't you fly me over yesterday  
Can you take me high enough  
It's never over whoa whoa whoa
