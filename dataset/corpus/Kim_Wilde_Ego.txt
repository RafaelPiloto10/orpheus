All the time I try to reason with you  
But I just can't seem to make you understand  
Nothing seems to ever really get through  
Can't you feel emotions like any other man  
  
You never cared for anyone (anyone)  
You never cared for anyone (at all)  
Any love that you've ever given me  
You only gave me for your ego  
  
Look at how you wanted all of my tears  
Any time you felt you needed security  
All the nights you let me out on my own  
That's the thing that you just can't give back to me  
  
You never cared for anyone (anyone)  
You never cared for anyone (at all)  
Any love that you've ever given me  
You only gave me for your ego  
  
You're only plan it seems is look after number one  
You just can't comprehend what it means to love someone  
  
Stay away, get lost, get out of my life  
Can't you see the changes now and at last I'm free  
Any plans I have just don't include you  
And that's the one thing you won't take from me  
  
You never cared for anyone (anyone)  
You never cared for anyone (at all)  
Any love that you've ever given me  
You only gave me for your ego  
  
Every time I tried to reason with you  
But it seemed that I never made you understand  
Nothing ever seemed to ever really get through  
Can't you feel emotions like any other man  
  
You never cared for anyone (anyone)  
You never cared for anyone (at all)  
Any love that you've ever given me  
You only gave me for your ego
