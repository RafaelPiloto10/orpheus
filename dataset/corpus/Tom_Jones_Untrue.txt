Untrue, unfaithful  
That was you  
Every other day  
There was someone new  
  
Untrue, unfaithful  
That was you  
Why was I a fool  
To fall in love with you  
  
Wishing for something  
Other than love  
Wishing that I had  
Never known love  
Wishing I could forget  
  
Wishing that I have  
Never tasted  
Kisses that suddenly  
Are wasted  
Wishing I could forget you  
Wishing we've never met  
  
Untrue, unfaithful  
That was you  
Every other day  
There was someone new  
  
Untrue, unfaithful  
That was you  
Why was I a fool  
To fall in love with you  
  
If I could stop  
The willow weeping  
If I could stop  
The sun from sleeping  
Then I could stop  
The shadows creeping  
Over my love for you  
Guess I'm still  
Missing you  
  
Untrue, unfaithful  
That was you  
Every other day  
There was someone new  
  
Untrue, unfaithful  
That was you  
Why was I a fool  
To fall in love with you
