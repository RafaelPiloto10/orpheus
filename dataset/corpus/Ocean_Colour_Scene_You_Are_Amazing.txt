You are amazing  
It's the truth  
And it's often fading  
Without you  
  
I don't feel the wind blow  
I don't feel the hard rock  
I don't feel it when it breaks your heart  
I don't feel it all get  
To far from the start  
  
You are a lady  
It's the truth  
And it's often shady  
Behind you  
  
I don't feel the hollow  
I don't feel it all broke  
I don't need it when you make your mark  
I don't live in malice  
I need a morning heart  
  
Standing here and hollow  
It's the only thing broke  
And it shakes you and it makes you start  
Like a singing widow  
Which won't mend your heart  
  
You are amazing  
It's the truth
