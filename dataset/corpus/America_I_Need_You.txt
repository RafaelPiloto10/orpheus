We used to laugh  
We used to cry  
We used to bow our heads then  
Wonder why  
But now you're gone  
I guess I'll carry on  
And make the best of what you've left to me  
Left to me, left to me  
  
I need you  
Like the flower needs the rain  
You know, I need you  
Guess I'll start it all again  
You know, I need you  
Like the winter needs the spring  
You know I need you  
I need you  
  
And every day  
I'd laugh the hours away  
Just knowing you were thinking of me  
Then it came  
That I was put to blame  
For every story told about me  
About me, about me  
  
I need you  
Like the flower needs the rain  
You know, I need you  
Guess I'll start it all again  
You know, I need you  
Like the winter needs the spring  
You know I need you  
I need you, I need you
