They hung him on the cross  
They hung him on the cross  
They hung him on the cross  
For me  
  
One day when I was lost  
They hung him on the cross  
They hung him on the cross for me  
  
They whooped him up the hill  
They whooped him up the hill  
They whooped him up the hill  
For me  
  
One day when I was lost  
They hung him on the cross  
They whooped him up the hill for me  
  
He never said among them word  
They never said among them word  
They never said among them word  
For me  
  
One day when I was lost  
They hung him on the cross  
They hung him on the cross  
For me  
  
They bit him in the side  
They bit him in the side  
They bit him in the side  
For me  
  
One day when I was lost  
They hung him on the cross  
They hung him on the cross for me  
  
He hung his head and died  
He hung his head and died  
He hung his head and died  
For me  
  
One day when I was lost  
They hung him on the cross  
They hung him on the cross  
For me
