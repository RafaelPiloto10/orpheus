Don'T talk to strangers  
Writer Sonny Bono  
  
Don't talk to strangers, baby  
Watch out for dangers, baby  
I can't let anybody break your heart  
Don't think I'm trying to guide you  
Protect or trying to hide you  
I just don't want my baby torn apart  
  
I want the same things as you do  
The whole world to hear you  
And to see what I see  
Someday your dreams  
Will all come true  
But watch me run too  
Cause you gotta be free  
  
Don't talk to strangers, baby  
Watch out for dangers, baby  
I can't let anybody break your heart  
Break your heart
