Every day it gets a little harder, can't seem to get away.  
I remember there's a certain place, a place I wish I'd stay.  
I feel so lost within, pressured, I'm headed for that day.  
Just one thought in my head, really.  
Do I need this fame?  
  
Every time, god damn, I look at my son, I see something I can't be.  
Beautiful and care free, that's how I used to be.  
Like some god damn fucking freak, I'm so pressured, I'm so worried,  
Something takes a hold of me, something I can't believe.  
I lay in bed at night and wonder, should I go on this way?  
  
It's the only thing I really got for now, and it's called fame.  
Every time, god damn, I look at my son, I see something I can't be.  
Beautiful and care free, that's how I used to be.  
  
Like some god damn fucking freak, I'm so pressured, I'm so worried,  
Something takes a hold of me, something I can't believe.  
So I see this face so innocent and fine, and so fine.  
So I see this face and I realize it's mine.  
I feel the rattle  
  
So I see this face so innocent and fine, and so fine.  
So I see this face and I realize it's mine.  
I feel the rattle  
  
Every time, god damn, I look at my son, I see something I can't be.  
Beautiful and care free, that's how I used to be.  
Like some god damn fucking freak, I'm so pressured, I'm so worried,  
Something takes a hold of me, something I can't believe.  
Like some god damn fucking freak!
