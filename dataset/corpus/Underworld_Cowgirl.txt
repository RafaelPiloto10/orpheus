everything (x20)  
  
I'm invisible (x8)  
  
am, an eraser of love (x9)  
  
why don't you call me I feel like flying in two (x3)  
  
I'm invisible (x8)  
  
am, an erazor of love (x16)  
  
why don't you call me I feel like flying in two (x4)  
  
am, an erazor of love (x9)  
  
I scream  
I scream  
I scream so much  
you know what I mean this electric stream  
and my tears in league with the  
wires and energy and my machine  
this is my beautiful dream  
I'm hurting no one

hurting no one

I want to give you everything  
I want to give you energy  
I want to give a good thing  
I want to give you everything  
  
everythingeverythingeverythingeverythingeverythingeverythingeverything  
  
in one final scream of love who could climb  
this high she looks beautiful like a child  
I feel tears  
and I want to scream  
you know what I mean cause this is hurting no one  
am, an erazor of love  
  
hurt the necessary feeling  
  
why don't you call me I feel like flying in two (x4)  
  
am, an erazor of love (x8)
