Verse 1:  
Forward yesterday -- Makes me wanna stay.

Livin' under house -- Guess I'm livin', I'm a mouse.  
All's I gots is time -- Got no meaning, just a rhyme.

Take time with a wounded hand -- Cause it likes to heal  
Take time with a wounded hand -- Cause I like to steal  
Take time with a wounded hand -- Cause it likes to heal... I like to steal..

(This I feel as the dawn, it fades to gray).  
Well, I'm half the man I used to be  
(This I feel as the dawn, it fades to gray).  
Well, I'm half the man I used to be  
(This I feel as the dawn, it fades to gray).  
Well, I'm half the man I used to be..  
Half the man I used to be..  
  
Verse 2:  
Feelin' uninspired -- Think I'll start a fire.
