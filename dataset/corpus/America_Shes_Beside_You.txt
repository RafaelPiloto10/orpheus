Do wop, do wop ...  
You've got to give, you've got to live  
You've got to show everyone that you know  
Till you know she's beside you  
Till you know she's beside you  
You've got to shout all about  
You've got to tell everyone that you know  
Till you know she's beside you  
Till you know she's beside you  
'Cause I know just how it feels  
To find that love is real, so real  
You've got to shout all about  
You've got to tell everyone that you know  
Till you know she's beside you  
Till you know she's beside you  
'Cause I know just how it feels  
To find that love is real, so real  
You've got to give, you've got to live  
You've got to show everyone that you know  
Till you know she's beside you  
Till you know she's beside you  
Till you know she's beside you  
Till you know she's beside you  
Do wop, do wop ...
