So when my voice breaks  
It's called interpretation  
When I  
Hold a note  
It's cause I want to...  
Not cause I feel anything about you  
So don't flatter yourself thinking that I  
Love you...  
Make you emotional  
From major to the minor when I  
Lose control  
I'm not trying to impress you  
Break it down  
And I get your attention  
But it's just formula  
Don't need your validation, validation  
  
This is just a song  
The music plays and then  
Then it's gone again  
This is just a song  
The words don't mean a thing  
And everytime I sing  
I loved you all along  
Remember, remember...  
This is just a song  
  
Now I've been nothing  
Yes, I'm on auto-piolit  
Have selfish words  
Even singing while I'm sleeping  
Just cause you have showed up here to see me  
Doesn't mean I'm going home with you this evening
