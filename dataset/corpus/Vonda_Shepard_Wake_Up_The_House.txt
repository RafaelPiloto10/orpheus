I seem to walk on ice  
Some things make me think twice  
When I get that resistance  
Like having freedom with my hands tied  
  
I've censored what's inside way too long  
I can't live so black and white  
Somebody listen  
Somebody say what's on your mind  
  
I've got the wheels of the reckless  
I'm gonna scream on the edges  
  
Wake up the house start the clock work  
Turn on the lights anybody home  
Break all the glass on my windows  
Wake up the house so I'm not alone  
Disturb this neighborhood  
Maybe it'll do some good  
You know what I'm missing  
When everybody's asleep at night  
  
Somebody's got to tlak  
Might as well be my job yeah  
Maybe somebody's listening  
You know I've censored this heart too long  
  
I've got the wheels of the restless  
I'm gonna scream on the edges  
  
Wake up the house start the clock work  
Turn on all the lights anybody home  
Break all the glass on my windows  
Wake up the house so I'm not alone  
  
I can't live so black and white  
You know what I'm missing  
Something's making me think twice  
Is anybody listening?
