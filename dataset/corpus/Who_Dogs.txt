The first time we met you were a kennel maid,  
You gave me a tip I got me forecast paid,  
You were holding a greyhound in trap number one,  
Your white coat was shining in the afternoon sun.  
  
Now we're both together,  
We're never gonna break apart, no no,  
'Cause we're a happy couple you and me,  
With a greyhound at either knee.  
  
I'll have ten shillings to win on Camera Flash, young man,  
What dog's that, it's a deuce, look at it.  
  
There was nothing in my life bigger than beer,  
There was nothing in my life bigger than beer,  
'Ceptin' you, little darling,  
'Ceptin' you, little darling,  
We're a happy couple you and me,  
With a greyhound at either knee.  
  
We go to the dog track on Saturday night,  
We put all our money on a dog that we like,  
A kiss and a cuddle, a hot meat pie,  
Two dollar tickets and a starry sky.  
  
There was nothing in my life bigger than beer,  
There was nothing in my life bigger than beer,  
'Ceptin' you, little darling,  
'Ceptin' you, little darling,  
We're a happy couple you and me,  
With a baby on either knee.  
  
Yes it's you little darling,  
Yes it's you little darling,  
Now it's you little darling,  
Now it's you.  
  
Girl, where's me wage packet ?????,  
Ah I'll put twenty-five knicker please on Gallop Printer,  
Oh, I hope the wife don't find out,  
Yes, it's sure to win, isn't it,  
Yes, I know, it's a good dog, I saw it run at White City,  
Just last week, broke the record, Gallop Printer,  
Nice dog, yes, lovely form, lovely buttocks.
