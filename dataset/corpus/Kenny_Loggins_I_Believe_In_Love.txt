I see faces!  
Coverin' an empty 'I'  
Empty spaces  
Where there used to be a soul inside  
  
Nothin' and no one ever gets to them  
Seems the wind could blow right through them  
Believin' in gods that never knew them  
I believe in love  
  
I believe in love, I do!  
I believe I'm feelin' good  
I'm feeling love!  
(feeling love is feeling good)  
I believe in love  
Feeling love is feeling good!  
  
Worry!  
Climbin' up your money tree  
You've got to hide it  
Monkey do what the monkey see  
  
You're on a one-way street and you're speedin'  
Missin' the signs you should be readin'  
That's the things you'll later be needin'  
I believe in love  
  
I believe it, nobody sold me  
Always knew it, nobody told me  
I believe in someone to hold me  
I believe in love  
  
I believe in love, I do!  
I believe I'm feelin' good  
I'm feeling love!  
(feeling love is feeling good)  
(feeling love is feeling good, I believe in love)  
(feeling love is feeling good)  
  
I believe in love  
(feeling love is feeling good, I believe in love)  
Feeling love is feeling good!  
(I believe in love)  
Feeling love is feeling good!  
(I believe in love)  
  
Oh, never be lonely!  
Sleepin' in an empty bed  
Shouldn't feel it, just a place to rest my head  
  
But I don't want to find myself one day  
Wakin' up and lookin' at Monday  
With some 'what's-her-name' left from Sunday  
I believe in love  
  
I believe it, nobody sold me  
Always knew it, nobody told me  
I believe in someone to hold me  
I believe in love  
  
I believe in love, I do!  
I believe I'm feelin' good  
Everybody should!  
I believe I'm feelin' good  
Believe in it  
Believe in, love!
