Hang loose  
Party  
Got my head to the grindstone  
I'm trying to act like a fool  
My head is a lampshade  
They can't find me at school  
Well I'm an animal  
Yes I'm a cannonball  
They say I'm out for blood  
One thing I wanna do is  
Party all night (Oh-oh!)  
Party all night (Oh-oh-oh!)  
Party all night (Yeah!)  
All night long  
Driving right way on the wrong side  
A bit too much to drink  
Women in the backseat  
And they don't know what to think  
They say I've lost my head  
You'll probably end up dead  
But they're too blind to see  
What's a party to me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Is to party all night (Oh-oh!)  
Let's party all night (Oh-oh-oh!)  
Party all night (Yeah!)  
All night long  
Uh!  
Let's have a good time, good time  
c'mon  
Everybody's parties  
I'm on a one way cruise  
Lookin' for trouble  
We got nothing to lose  
They're on the telephone  
They're trying to send me home  
We're gonna pull the plug  
We've got a new kind of school  
Let's party all night  
Let's party all night  
Party all night  
Let's party all night  
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)  
Let's party all night (Oh!)  
(We're party animals, baby)  
Let's party all night (Oh-oh-oh!)  
(We've got nothing to lose)  
Let's party all night  
All night long, yeah!
