Everyday seem like Sunday  
It must be something that I have done  
I saw you dancing in the peep-show  
That every episode is leading me on  
  
I'm just another fool that you've got to humor  
Can't say I love you when it's just a rumor  
  
But if none of your dreams come true  
You can call on me, call on me  
'Cause I've seen dreams have a happy ending  
Disappearing on my tv, and you can call on me  
You can call on me, you can call on me, you can call on me  
  
When I go home I watch the television  
I go to sleep I dream about the television  
I go to work I talk about the television  
I used to think that love is something that it isn't  
  
Sometimes I feel just like a human being  
That's just something between you and me  
  
But if none of you dreams come true  
You can call on me, call on me  
'Cause I've seen dreams have a happy ending  
Disappearing on my tv, and you can call on me  
You can call on me, you can call on me, you can call on me
