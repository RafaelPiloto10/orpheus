Someone's driving a 450  
And his friends are so wild  
They're still in their stick shifties  
But they feel they have much more style  
But I've found . . .  
  
It's all up to what you value  
Down to where you are  
It all swings on the pain you've gone through  
Getting where you are  
  
It's all up to what you value  
In your motor car  
It all rests on what it's cost you  
Getting where you are  
It's what you value  
  
Someone's driving a 6-wheeler  
Seems the world is all blurred  
Knows he's in a show stealer  
With a sound that's uncompared  
And I've found  
  
It's all up to what you value  
Down to where you are  
It all swings on the pain you're gone through  
Getting where you are  
  
It's all up to what you value  
In your motor car  
It all rests on what it cost's you  
Getting where you are  
It's what you value.
