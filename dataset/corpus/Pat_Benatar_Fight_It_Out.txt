I heard you say you're feelin' like a change now  
Maybe, baby this could be arranged now  
But I warn you that no exotic scenery  
Will solve your problems or make you feel easy  
You say you're happy, but I see apprehension  
That little laugh of yours doesn't hide the tension  
The precious book you clutch so tightly in your hands  
Won't help you sleep at night, won't iron out your plans  
  
You gotta Fight It Out with your heart  
You got to Fight It, though it tears you apart  
You got to Fight It Out, my friend  
You got to do it for yourself  
You got to say when  
  
You ask advice, then resent my observations  
If I didn't care, then I wouldn't make them  
Can't change the past, so why let it haunt you  
Can paint the future, but first you have to want to  
  
You gotta Fight It Out with your heart  
You got to Fight It, though it tears you apart  
You got to Fight It Out, my friend  
You got to do it for yourself  
You got to say when  
  
I can see how much you hurt inside  
I know all about the tears you hide  
  
You gotta Fight It Out with your heart  
You got to Fight It, though it tears you apart  
You got to Fight It Out, my friend  
You gotta Fight It Out with your heart  
You got to Fight It, though it tears you apart  
You got to Fight It Out, my friend  
  
You know that the lonely pay a price for love in the end  
You know that the lonely pay a price for love in the end  
It's always the lonely who pay a price for love in the end
