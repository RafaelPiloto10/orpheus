Oh the tension's mounting  
The pressure starts to show  
All the men in haunting  
Please don't let me go  
  
(Don't go)  
Try to free my body  
(Don't go)  
Try to strap me down  
(Don't go)  
These'll never break me  
(Don't go)  
Free wheel to look at me  
  
Condition critical  
I'm feeling physical  
Condition critical  
Not really cynical  
  
The bells they are ringing  
Or is it in my head  
My nerves numb understanding  
I'm falling out of bed  
  
(Don't go)  
So call it paranoia  
(Don't go)  
I don't see it that way  
(Let's go)  
You say I adore ya  
(Hell no)  
We're gonna rock they way  
  
Condition critical  
I'm feeling physical  
Condition critical  
Not really cynical  
  
Ooh ooh  
  
Whips and chains  
Don't feel no pain  
What's so wrong  
I think I'm going out of my head  
Over heels  
I can't feel  
No pain, only pleasure  
Get me out  
Take me home  
Can't you see my condition  
  
Woo-woo-woo  
  
Condition  
Condition  
Condition critical, critical  
  
Condition  
Condition  
Condition critical  
  
Condition critical  
I'm feeling physical  
Condition critical  
Not really cynical  
  
Condition critical  
I'm feeling physical  
Condition critical  
Not really cynical (Cynical)  
  
Condition  
Condition  
Condition critical, critical  
  
Condition  
Condition  
Condition critical, critical  
  
Condition

Condition critical, critical

Ooh-ooh-ooh
