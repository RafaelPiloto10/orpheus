[Hey God] Why are you doing this to me?  
Am I not living up to what I'm supposed to be?  
Why am I seething with this animosity?  
[Hey God] I think you owe me a great big apology  
  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
  
[Hey God] I really don't know what you mean  
Seems like salvation comes only in our dreams  
I feel my hatred grow all the more extreme  
[Hey God] Can this world really be as sad as it seems?  
  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
  
Don't take it away from me, I need you to hold on to  
Don't take it away from me, I need someone to hold on to  
Don't tear it away from me, I need you to hold on to  
Don't tear it away from me, I need someone to hold on to  
Don't tear it away from me, I need you to hold on to  
Don't tear it, don't tear it, don't tear it, don't tear it, don't  
  
[Hey God] there's nothing left for me to hide  
I lost my ignorance, security and pride  
I'm all alone in the world you must despise  
[Hey God] I believed your promises, your promises and lies!  
  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
Terrible lie  
  
You made me throw it all away  
My morals left to decay  
How many you betray  
You've taken everything  
  
Terrible lie  
  
My head is filled with disease  
My skin is begging you please  
I'm on my hands and knees  
I want so much to believe  
  
I give you everything..  
my sweet everything..  
  
I need someone to hold on to  
I need someone, I need someone  
I need someone to hold on to
