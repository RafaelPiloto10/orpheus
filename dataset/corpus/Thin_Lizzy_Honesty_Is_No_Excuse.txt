Up till now I used to pass my time  
Drinking beer so slowly, sometimes wine  
No God, air, water or sunshine  
And honesty was my only excuse  
I took your love and I used it  
Up till now my youthful stage  
A useless rage, a torn out page, a worn out gauge  
A dirty shade, a big charade, a has been made  
And honesty was my only excuse  
I took your love and I used it  
I never, I never, I never  
Up till now my love life  
Few sweet kisses, a little missus, a fork and knife  
A happy home, a hand to hold, a land to roam  
And honesty was my only excuse  
I used to take life in my own hands and I abused it  
Up till now I used to tap dance  
Take a girl by the hand saying  
"I need your, I need your romance"  
Oh I had me many chances  
And honesty was my only excuse  
I used to take your love and I'd abused it  
Up till now the path of life was fair enough  
Enough was fair, all was right  
And now I know, I see the light  
And honesty was my only excuse
