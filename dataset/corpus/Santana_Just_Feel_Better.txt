She said I feel stranded  
And I can't tell anymore  
If we coming or I'm going  
It's not how I planed it  
I've got the key to the door  
But it just won't open  
  
And I know I know I know  
Part of me says let it go  
That life happens for a reason  
I don't I don't I don't  
It goes I never went before  
But this time this time  
  
I'm gonna try anything that just feel better  
Tell me what to do  
You know I can't see through the haze around me  
And I do anything that just feel better  
  
And I can't find my way  
Girl I need a change  
And I do anything that just feel better  
Any little thing that just feel better  
  
She said I need you to hold me  
I'm a little far from the shore  
And I'm afraid of sinking  
You're the only one knows me  
And who doesn't ignore  
That my soul is weeping  
  
I know I know I know  
Part of me says let it go  
Everything must have it seasons  
Round and round it goes  
And every day's a one before  
But this time this time  
  
I'm gonna try anything that just feels better  
Tell me what to do  
You know I can't see through the haze around me  
And I do anything that just feel better  
  
And I can't find my way  
God I need a change  
And I do anything that just feel better  
Any little thing that just feel better  
  
Long to hold you in my arms  
To all things I ought to leave behind yeah  
It's really getting nowhere  
I think I need a little help this time  
  
Yeah  
  
I'm gonna try anything that just feel better  
Tell me what to do  
You know I can't see through the haze around me  
And I do anything that just feel better  
  
And I can't find my way  
Girl I need a change  
And I do anything that just feel better  
Any little thing that just feel better
