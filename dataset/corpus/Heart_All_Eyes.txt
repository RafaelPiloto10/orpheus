Hey hot shot boy  
Hand on your hip  
You're wasting your time  
Giving me lip  
When you look at me, it melts my legs  
And wraps me around your fingertip  
  
You don't have to say a word  
To get hold of me  
Take me, shake me  
Burning gravity baby  
Look at me  
Look at me  
  
[Chorus]  
You're all eyes, all eyes  
Touching me in the night  
You're all eyes - and those eyes  
Are tearing me up inside  
  
We go walking you and i  
If some woman turns your eye  
I pull you back in my direction  
Too keep you by my side  
  
You don't have to go nowhere  
To get where you should be  
You don't have to look around  
Just you look at me - look at me - look at me  
  
[Chorus: x 4]
