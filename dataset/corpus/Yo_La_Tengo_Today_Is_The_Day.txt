I followed you foolishly  
You were at a smoky bar, you were out til three  
Sat alone inside my car, it was nearly four  
We were gonna wait for you all night  
So I locked the door  
  
I was gonna spend the night, coulda been okay  
We were gonna talk all night, till I went away  
Remember how you used to say, can't stay up late  
A minute later we're older now, I can't stay awake  
I'm driving by your parent's farm, in the Chevrolet  
I remember that rusty car, like it was yesterday  
  
Saw my brother driving by, the other day  
I wished that I'd go out to him, but he drove away  
Saw my sister standing there, standing in rain  
Then I thought about nothing, that it feels the same  
  
Another day, come and gone  
Don't think I can ever sing that song  
Little secrets we bring along  
I'm taking my time, trailing behind, I thought of you  
Today is the day I think of you
