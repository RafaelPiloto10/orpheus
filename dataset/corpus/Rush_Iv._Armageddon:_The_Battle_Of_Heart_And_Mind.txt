The Universe divided  
As the Heart and Mind collided,  
With the people left unguided  
For so many troubled years.  
In a cloud of doubts and fears,  
Their world was torn asunder into hollow Hemispheres.  
  
Some fought themselves, some fought each other.  
Most just followed one another,  
Lost and aimless like their brothers,  
For their hearts were so unclear,  
And the truth could not appear.  
Their spirits were divided into blinded Hemispheres.  
  
Some who did not fight  
Brought tales of old to light.  
My Rocinante' sailed by night  
On her final flight.  
To the heart of Cygnus' fearsome force  
We set our course.  
Spiralled through that timeless space  
To this immortal place.
