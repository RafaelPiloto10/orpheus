Don't know why there's no sun up in the sky  
Stormy weather  
Since my man and I ain't together,  
Keeps rainin' all the time  
  
Life is bare, gloom and misery everywhere  
Stormy weather  
Just can't get my poor self together,  
I'm weary all the time  
So weary all the time  
When he went away the blues walked in and met me.  
If he stays away old rockin' chair will get me.  
  
All I do is pray the lord above will let me walk in the sun once more.  
Can't go on, every thing I had is gone  
Stormy weather  
  
Since my man and I ain't together,  
Keeps rainin' all the time
