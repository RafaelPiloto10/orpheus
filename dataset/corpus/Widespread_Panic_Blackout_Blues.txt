Hope you don't mind me barging the door  
In the middle of the night  
Hope you don't mind me barging the door like this  
In the middle of the night  
Falling in and out of bars on my own  
Pick my head up off the ground  
  
Woke up on your bed this morning  
You were sleeping on the floor  
Woke up on your bed this morning  
You were sleeping on the floor  
Falling in and out of bars on my own  
Pick my head up off the ground  
  
I think we're riding on our last legs  
Like a dark horse down the stretch  
I think we're riding on our last legs  
Like a dark horse down the stretch  
Falling in and out of bars on my own  
Pick my head up off the ground  
  
I think we're riding on our last legs  
Like a dark horse down the stretch  
I think we're riding on our last legs  
Like a dark horse down the stretch  
Falling in and out of bars on my own  
Pick my head up off the ground  
  
Pick my head up off the ground  
Pick my head up off the ground  
Pick my head up off the ground  
Pick my head up off the ground
