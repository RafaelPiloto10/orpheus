I am a man who walks alone  
And when I'm walking a dark road  
At night or strolling through the park  
  
When the light begins to fade  
I sometimes feel a little strange  
A little anxious when it's dark  
  
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark  
I have constant fear that something's  
Always near  
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark  
I have a phobia that someone's  
Always there  
  
Have you run your fingers down  
The wall  
And have you felt your neck skin crawl  
When you're searching for the light?  
Sometimes when you're scared  
To take a look  
At the corner of the room  
You've sensed that something's  
Watching you  
  
Have you ever been alone at night  
Thought you heard footsteps behind  
And turned around and no one's there?  
And as you quicken up your pace  
You find it hard to look again  
Because you're sure there's  
Someone there  
  
Watching horror films the night before  
Debating witches and folklore's  
The unknown troubles on your mind  
Maybe your mind is playing tricks  
You sense, and suddenly eyes fix  
On dancing shadows from behind  
  
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark  
I have a constant fear that something's  
Always near  
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark  
I have a phobia that someone's  
Always there  
  
When I'm walking a dark road  
I am a man who walks alone
