She's getting out of control  
She's takin' my soul  
And won't let it go  
  
I'm going out of my mind  
She's wastin' my time  
But I won't let it show  
No No  
You want it all  
You got it all  
You want it all  
Just so you can have it  
And baby I'm sending you a line  
  
Maybe tomorrow  
Maybe tonight  
Baby it's always  
Clean out of sight  
  
She thinks I'm digging her scene  
I'm breaking it clean  
So I ought to let her know  
I'm holding out my hand  
Losing touch with each and every caress  
Love 'n' bitterness
