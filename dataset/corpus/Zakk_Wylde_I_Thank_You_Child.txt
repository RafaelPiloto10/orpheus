All for you  
Everlasting love forever skies of blue  
All in your heart  
Never ending just a means for start  
  
[Chorus]  
Comfort in your eyes  
For the warmth inside your smile  
Faith's done gone astray  
It was you who made living all worth the while  
I thank you my child  
It was you who made living all worth the while  
I thank you my child  
  
With the touch of your hand  
Amidst confusion I can see enough to understand  
All my fears repressed  
Oh lovin' you child it's the best  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're all and everything to me  
Til the end of times you know you'll always be  
Ain't no second guess  
Oh you put my worried soul to rest
