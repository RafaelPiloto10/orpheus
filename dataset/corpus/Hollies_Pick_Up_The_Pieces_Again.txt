(sylvester)  
Evening, I see the sun  
Leaving today  
Cool night, mellow light  
Don't fade away  
Your eyes, paradise  
What do they say  
Leaving, loving  
Stay one more day  
And after all the tears have fallen my way  
You'd think that we could never feel the same  
Love is strange  
Pick up the pieces again  
Long time, friend of mine  
Words of farewell  
Love is, the learning  
I knew you well  
And after all the tears have fallen my way  
You'd think that we could never feel the same  
Love is strange  
Pick up the pieces again  
Pick up the pieces
