O holy night the stars are brightly shining  
This is the night of our dear Savior's birth  
Long lay the world in sin and error pining  
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth  
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new glorious morn  
Fall on your knees  
O hear the angels' voices  
O night divine  
O night when Christ was born  
O night divine, O night  
Divine  
  
[INSTRUMENTAL BREAK]  
  
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn  
Fall on your knees  
O hear the angels' voices  
O night divine  
O night when Christ was born  
O night divine, O night  
Divine
