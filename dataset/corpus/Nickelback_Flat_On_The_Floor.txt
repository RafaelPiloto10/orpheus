Not like I need to depend upon anyone  
Since I can see the lack of need for me to be here at all  
One more anthem for the know-it-all  
I won't be standing up for long, I'd better learn how to crawl  
Learn how to crawl  
  
In ten minutes I'll be laying out flat on the floor  
  
Like I need to defend my own innocence  
So what, I did it, I admit it, and I'm pleading the fifth  
One more anthem for the know-it-all  
I won't be standing up for long, I'd better learn how to crawl  
Learn how to crawl  
  
In ten minutes I'll be laying out flat on the floor  
  
Eight minutes, I'm losin' it a little bit  
Five minutes, your description might be starting to fit  
Three to go and I'm forgetting all that I've ever known  
I won't be standing up for long, I'd better learn how to crawl  
  
Not like I need to depend upon anyone  
Since I can see the lack of need for me to be here at all  
One more anthem for the know-it-all  
I won't be standing up for long, I'd better learn how to crawl  
Learn how to crawl  
  
In ten minutes I'll be laying out flat on the floor  
I can't stand up at all, can't see nothing at all  
In ten minutes I'll be laying out flat on the floor
