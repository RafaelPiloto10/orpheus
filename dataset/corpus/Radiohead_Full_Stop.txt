[Intro]  
You really messed up everything  
You really messed up everything  
If you could take it all back again  
Strike up the tinderbox  
Why should I be good if you're not?  
  
[Verse 1]  
This is a foul-tasting medicine  
A foul tasting medicine  
To be trapped in your full stop  
  
[Chorus]  
Truth will mess you up  
Truth will mess you up  
Truth will mess you up  
Truth will mess you up  
x2  
  
Truth will mess you up (All the good times)  
Truth will mess you up  
x8  
  
[Verse 2]  
When you take me back  
Take me back again  
  
Will you take me back  
Take me back again  
  
[Outro]  
Ooh  
  
Do you remember  
x4  
  
Ooh  
  
Do you remember  
x4  
  
Ooh  
  
Do you remember  
x4
