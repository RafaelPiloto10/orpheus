When I ran to the store with a penny  
And when youth was abundant and plenty  
Classify these as good times good times  
When I rolled rubber tires in the driveway  
Pulled a purse on a string across the highway  
Classify these as good times good times  
Good times are coming humming hmm  
Good times are coming humming hmm  
  
Go to school  
Fight a war  
Working steady  
Meet a girl  
Fall in love  
For I'm ready  
Classify these  
As good times  
Good times  
  
Here I sit with a drink and a mem'ry  
But I'm not cold I'm not wet and I'm not hungry  
So classify these as good times good times  
Good times are coming humming hmm good times  
Good times are coming humming hmm good times
