Don't stop now  
Don't stop now  
Don't stop now  
Doing what you're doing  
I've got someone who only loves me  
I've got someone who'll always love me  
It is you and me against the world  
If someone's trying to hurt you baby  
I will do my best to save us  
What is good for you is good for me  
Don't don't stop in the name of twosome  
Keep on doing what you're doing  
Baby it ain't over till it's over  
(Don't stop now, don't stop now)  
Please don't stop  
Please don't stop  
Doing what you're doing  
Don't stop  
Please don't stop  
Doing what you're doing  
You're my glittering price, my sparkling  
Precious little diamond always  
You remember I'd go where you'd go  
What you want, I will fulfill it  
Even if you don't fit in good  
Give it up for you, the one for me  
Don't don't stop in the name of twosome  
Keep on doing what you're doing  
Baby it ain't over till it's over  
(Don't stop now, don't stop now)  
Please don't stop  
(Gimme gimme more, gimme gimme gold)  
Please don't stop  
Doing what you're doing  
Don't stop  
(Gimme gimme more, gimme gimme gold)  
Please don't stop  
Doing what you're doing  
You gave my day a tone  
A colour never seen  
I can't tell you the shape of it  
The texture is so new (do it)  
You gave my day a tone  
A colour never seen  
I can't tell you the shape of it  
The colour is so new  
I will always follow where you go  
Baby it ain't over till it's over  
(Don't stop now, don't stop now)  
Please don't stop  
(Gimme gimme more, gimme gimme gold)  
Please don't stop  
Doing what you're doing (You color my world)  
Don't stop  
(Gimme gimme more, gimme gimme gold)  
Please don't stop (Doing what you're doing)  
Doing what you're doing  
Doing what you're doing  
Doing what you're doing  
Doing what you're doing  
Doing what you're doing
