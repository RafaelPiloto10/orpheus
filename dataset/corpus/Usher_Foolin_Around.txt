I know I vowed to never do this again but  
I guess this seems to be the only thing I'm good at  
  
Got something that you need to know  
Either really should I never roll  
Cant hold it gotta let it go  
Though that I knew you'll never know  
  
Yea yea  
Listen babe  
  
Let me start by saying that  
The way I feel for you is never once changed  
And the games that we played, mistakes I made  
Leave me sorrier than you'll ever know  
  
We got in problem babe I cant lie  
Cause lately I realize that I  
Never knew that we was on the same (playing field)  
Knew that there was wrong but we (let it be)  
And I know you never knew when you say I do  
That you would have to face all the (pain you feel)  
  
And its killin' me girl  
That you have to live with this  
Live with the lies I tell  
Live with the pain you feel  
Knowing the man you love is fooling around  
  
Oh baby said its killin' me girl  
Said I just don't understand  
Why you wanna be with this kind of man oh ho  
Why would you love a fool with all the things I do  
I know its hard for you  
Hard for you to live with him  
  
Trail memories from moments  
Treat love to be lonely  
Guess that's just the man in me  
Blaming onto liberty  
When the nights off feel like the right time  
And its spotlight feel like the white light  
But its really just my fears  
And still don't dry your tears,  
When I say she ain't true when I really love you more  
When you say if its true  
What you do it for and I  
I really don't know there's no excuse  
I break your heart make you cry  
I just wanna say goodbye  
  
Its killin' me girl that you have to live with these  
Live with the lies I tell  
Live with the pain you feel  
Knowing the man you love is fooling around  
Oh baby said its killin' me girl  
Said I just don't understand  
Why you wanna be with this kind of man oh ho  
Why would you love a fool with all the things I do  
I know its hard for you  
Hard for you to live with him  
  
What a feel I don't even gotta right it  
Its like poisons in my body  
And there's no way to deny  
That my heart is a time bomb  
With seconds left to explode  
But I gotta let you know before it blows  
  
That it ain't on you  
Its my fault  
All the gossip n' talkin'  
Behind your back when you walkin'  
By the time you will know  
Before long you'll see, that you deserve more  
You deserve more  
You deserve so much more  
Than what I'll ever be  
  
And its killin' me girl that you have to live with these  
Live with the lies I tell  
Live with the pain you feel  
Knowing the man you love is fooling around ('round)  
Oh baby said its killin' me girl  
Said I just don't understand  
Why you wanna be with this kind of man oh ho  
Why would you love a fool with all the things I do  
I know its hard for you  
Hard for you to live with him  
Live with him  
Can you live with him  
  
I just want you know  
Got somethin' that you need to know  
This be the realist shit I never wrote  
Can't hold it, gotta let it go  
Know that I mean every note, yeah, yeah, hm
