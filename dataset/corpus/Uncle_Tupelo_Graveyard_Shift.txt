Hometown, same town blues  
Same old walls closing in  
Oh what a life a mess can be  
I'm sitting here thinking of you once again  
Won't you talk to me  
  
Well, time won't wait, better open the gate  
Get up and start what needs to be done  
It's winding down, there's much you missed  
Working on that graveyard shift  
  
Well, I'm not saying there's nothing wrong as the day comes along  
If what I see is true I could learn to believe  
Can't look away  
The powers that be might take it all away  
Together we burn, together we burn away  
  
Some say a land of paradise  
Some say a land of pain  
Well, which side are you looking from  
Some people have it all  
Some all to gain  
  
Well a man in a tie gonna break his twenty dollar bill  
There's plenty of reasons in this world  
We're no longer standing still  
  
But I'm not saying there's nothing wrong as the day comes along  
If what I see is true I could learn to believe  
Can't look away  
The powers that be might take it all away  
Together we burn, together we burn away  
  
There's too much time spent looking for a reason  
It's the simple ones that beat the most truth  
Oh, what a life a mess can be  
I'm sitting here thinking of you once again  
Give a thought to me  
  
Well, time won't wait, better open the gate  
Get up and start what needs to be done  
It's running down, there's much you missed  
Working on that graveyard shift  
  
But I'm not saying there's nothing wrong as the day comes along  
If what I see is true I could learn to believe  
Can't look away  
The powers that be might take it all away  
Together we burn, together we burn away
