Walter, remember when the world was young and all the girls knew Walter's  
Name?  
Walter, isn't it a shame the way our little world has changed.  
Do you remember Walter playing cricket in the thunder and the rain?  
Do you remember Walter smoking cigarettes behind your garden gate?  
Yes, Walter was my mate.  
But Walter, my old friend, where are you now?  
  
Walter's name...  
Walter, isn't it a shame the way our little world has changed?  
Do you remember, Walter, how we said we'd fight the world so we'd be free?  
We'd save up all our money and we'd buy a boat and sail away to sea.  
But it was not to be.  
I knew you then, but do I know you now?  
  
Walter, you are just an echo of a world I knew so long ago.  
Walter, if you saw me now, you wouldn't even know my name.  
I bet you're fat and married,  
And you're always home in bed by half past eight.  
And if I talked about the old times, you'd get bored  
And you'd have nothing more to say.  
Yes, people often change.  
But memories of people can remain.
