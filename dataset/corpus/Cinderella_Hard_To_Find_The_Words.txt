Mama sometimes I feel inside  
There's nothing I can say  
Nothing I can do  
Could ever match the love you gave  
You taught me how to live  
Told me walk before you run  
And you were always there to pick me up  
Everytime I'd have a fall  
  
And mama I know there's been times  
When I didn't always understrand  
By and by we do some growing up  
And it makes just a little more sense  
But sometimes it's hard to find the words  
But I'll do the best that I can  
Thank you for the love mama  
It's what made this boy a man  
  
I know the road's been long  
And I know you've seen some rain  
Making the best of what we had  
I never heard you complain  
When I look in the mirror today  
Wondering could I be as strong  
Could I give as much to someone else  
As you gave to your son  
  
And mama I know there's been times  
When we didn't see eye to eye  
By and by we do some growing up  
And we understand the reasons why  
But sometimes it's hard to find the words  
But I'll do the best I can  
Thank you for the love mama  
It's what made this boy a man, yea  
  
Many years have gone by  
And I've been living them the best I can  
  
And mama I know there's been times  
When I didn't always understand  
By and by we do some growing up  
And it makes just a little more sense  
But sometimes it's hard to find the words  
But I'll do the best I can  
Thank you for the love mama  
It's what made this boy a man, yea
