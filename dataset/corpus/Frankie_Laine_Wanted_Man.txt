Till I became a wanted man,  
I never owned a gun,  
But now they hunt me like a mountain cat,  
And I'm always, always, always on the run  
  
I killed poor Jed Bryant  
In a bad Laredo fight,  
Killed him with my bare hands  
For the girl I loved that night.  
Jed's brother's out to get me,  
He's comin' with a gang  
I'd rather shoot it out, by God, than let 'em see me hang  
  
Bullet in my shoulder,  
Blood runnin' down my vest,  
Twenty in the posse,  
And they're never gonna let me rest.  
  
Till I became a wanted man,  
I never owned a gun,  
But now they hunt me like a mountain cat,  
And I'm always, always, always on the run  
  
Spangles on her red dress  
Laughter in her voice,  
When he tried to put his hands on her  
My heart left me no choice.  
But was she really worth it?  
I guess I'll never know,  
She'll be drinkin' someone else's rye when I'm six feet below.  
  
Bullet in my shoulder,  
Blood runnin' down my vest,  
Twenty in the posse,  
And they're never gonna let me rest.  
  
Till I became a wanted man,  
I never owned a gun,  
But now they hunt me like a mountain cat,  
And I'm always, always, always on the run.
