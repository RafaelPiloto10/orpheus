I'm gonna pull this timber 'fore the sun go down  
Get it 'cross the river 'fore the bars come down  
Drag it on down that dusty road  
Come on Jerry, let's dump this load  
  
I said "Timber, ho!", timber, woah this timber's gotta roll  
I said "Timber, ho!", timber, woah this timber's gotta roll  
  
My old Jerry was an Arkansas mule  
Been everywhere and he ain't no fool  
Weighed nine hundred and twenty-two  
Done everything a poor mule can do  
  
(chorus)  
  
Jerry's shoulders stood six foot tall  
Pulled more timber than a freight could haul  
Workin' heavy old Jerry got sore  
Pulled so much he couldn't pull no more  
  
(chorus)  
  
The boss said "Jerry" and it made him jump  
Jerry ran and kicked the boss on the rump  
My old Jerry was a cool mule  
Had it been me I woulda killed that fool  
Boss tried to shoot old Jerry in the head  
Jerry took that bullet and he stomped him dead  
Stomped that boss til he heard him scream  
Sure don't care he was so damn mean  
  
(chorus 2x)
