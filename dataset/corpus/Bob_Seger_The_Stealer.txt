Words and music by fraser and rogers  
  
I went down to the center of town  
  
Beneath my feet was the burning ground  
  
Just stood on the corner as sexy as could be  
  
Said "hey good looking, walk away with me"  
  
I said "yeah, I'm your stealer,  
  
Come to steal your love."  
  
  
  
Sun was shining, the world was bright,  
  
I said, "tell me darling, where you gonna be tonight? "  
  
"goin' around the corner, where the music's loud.  
  
I'm tired of the city, gonna cat me around."  
  
And I said "yeah, I'm your stealer,  
  
I come to steal your love."  
  
I come to  
  
I come to steal  
  
  
  
Goin' around the corner, where the music's loud.  
  
I'm tired of the city, gonna cat me around.  
  
And I said "yeah, I'm your stealer  
  
I come to steal your love.  
  
I'm stealin'...let me steal now...come steal it...  
  
Come steal it...come steal it...
