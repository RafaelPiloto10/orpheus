Wake up love, wake up babe  
I wanna tell you, let me say  
Dreaming never looked so true  
One word ain't enough  
Heaven's finding eyes in you  
How can I say love?  
Many smilers lie to each other, oh  
Children hide with pretty words, oh  
So many times we seem to find  
Children play too rough  
Never too late for what we are made for  
How can I say love?  
All this feeling here inside  
One word ain't enough  
The way to say it seems to hide  
How can I say love?  
How do we wind up?  
Why do we wind up so alone?  
How many roads do we gotta travel on  
Till we find out we're already home?  
Already home  
All this feeling here inside  
One word ain't enough  
The way to say it seems to hide  
How can I say love?
