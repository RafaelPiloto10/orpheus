Momma's got her apron on standin'  
In the kitchen  
Cookin' up my favorite dish whatever  
She is fixin'  
Daddy's in a picture in a frame that's  
Always sittin' by the phone  
  
Daffodils are poppin' up out behind the clothesline  
Underneath that tree I planted when I was just a boy of nine  
Man, I never can believe just how much it's grown  
When I go  
  
[Chorus]  
Home, back home  
To the gentle place that held me close as  
I became a man  
Where the streets are all familiar and an  
Old friend shakes my hand  
And I feel fine, so fine  
Yeah knowin' that this road I'm walkin' on  
From time to time always leads me home  
  
Brother he'll be waitin' with the latest  
From the grapevine  
Sayin' man you won't believe them  
Stories 'bout  
Those crazy friends of mine  
And all them little scandals that a small  
Town just can't seem to leave alone  
  
Later on we'll sit around, bellies tight  
From supper  
Tellin' all them stories that we just can't get enough of  
And somewhere in an honest laugh it'll  
Finally hit me that I'm  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Home, back home  
Where the memories all have gathered up and  
Slowly turned to gold  
And I carry them along with me wherever  
I may go  
And I feel fine, so fine  
In knowin' that this road I'm wanderin' on  
From time to time always leads me home  
Back home  
  
And when I go put some flowers down at  
Daddy's stone  
I see that empty space beside him  
It always makes me glad that I came home  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Home, back home  
Where the Bible is the Bible and the angels  
Get their wings  
And the circle is unbroken when I hear those  
Church bells ring  
And I feel fine, you know I feel so fine  
Yeah knowin' that this road I'm wanderin' on  
From time to time unwinds across the rivers  
Through the pines  
And leads me home, back home  
  
Yeah I'm going back home  
Back home
