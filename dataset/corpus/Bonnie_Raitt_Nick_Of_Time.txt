A friend of mine she cries at night,  
And she calls me on the phone  
Sees babies everywhere she goes  
And she wants one of her own.  
She's waited long enough she says  
And still she can't decide  
Pretty soon she'll have to choose and it tears her up inside  
She's scared, scared she'll run out of time.  
  
I see my folks, they're getting old,  
And I watch their bodies change  
I know they see the same in me,  
And it makes us both feel strange  
No matter how you tell yourself,  
It's what we all go through  
Those eyes are pretty hard to take when they're staring' back at you.  
Scared to run out of time.  
  
[Chorus]  
When did the choices get so hard?  
With so much more at stake.  
Life gets mighty precious when there's less of it to waste.  
Hummmm  
Scared to run out of time.  
  
Just when I thought I'd had enough  
And all my tears were shed  
No promise left unbroken,  
There were no painful words unsaid.  
You came along and showed me  
How to leave it all behind  
You opened up my heart again and then much to my surprise.  
  
I found love, baby,  
Love in the nick of time.  
  
I found love, darling,  
Love in the nick of time  
  
I found love, baby,  
Love in the nick of time.
