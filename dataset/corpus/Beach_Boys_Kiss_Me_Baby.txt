Please don't let me argue anymore  
I won't make you worry like before  
Can't remember what we fought about  
Late late last night we said it was over  
But i remember when we thought it out  
We both had a broken heart  
Woah baby  
(kiss me baby)  
Woah baby  
(love to only)  
Woah baby  
(kiss me baby)  
Woah baby  
(love to only)  
As i drove away i felt a tear  
It hit me i was losing someone dear  
Told my folks i would be alright  
Tossed and i turned, my head was so heavy  
Then i wondered as it got light  
Were you still awake like me?  
Woah baby  
(kiss me baby)  
Woah baby  
(love to only)  
Woah baby  
(kiss me baby)  
Woah baby  
(love to only)  
Time  
Woah baby  
(kiss me baby)  
Woah baby  
(love to only)  
Woah baby  
(kiss me baby)  
Woah baby  
(love to only)  
Woah baby  
(kiss me baby)  
Woah baby  
(love to only)
