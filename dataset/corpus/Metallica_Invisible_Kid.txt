Invisible kid  
Never see what he did  
Got stuck where he hid  
Fallen through the grid  
  
Invisible kid  
Got a place of his own  
Where he'll never be known  
Inward he's grown  
  
Invisible kid  
Locked away in his brain  
From the shame and the pain  
World down the drain  
  
Invisible kid  
Suspicious of your touch  
Don't want no crutch  
But it's all too much  
  
I hide inside  
I hurt inside  
I hide inside  
But I'll show you...  
  
I'm ok, just go away  
Into distance let me fade  
I'm ok, just go away  
I'm ok, but please don't stray too far  
  
Open your heart  
I'm beating right here  
Open your mind  
I'm being right here, right now (x2)

Oooh, what a good boy you are  
Out of the way and you're kept to yourself  
Oooh, can't you see that he's not here?  
He doesn't want the attention you give  
Oooh, unplugging from it all  
Invisible kid, floats alone in his room  
Oooh, what a quiet boy you are  
He looks so calm floating 'round and around in himself
