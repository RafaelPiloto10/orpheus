O my soul  
Do you not know?  
Have you not heard?  
It's been told form the beginning  
The Lord your God is on your side  
  
O my soul don't be afraid  
Hope in the Lord  
By His righteousness and power  
He will strengthen  
He will guide  
  
Chorus:  
And I will soar  
On wings like eagles  
Held by the hand of God  
I will run and not grow tired  
When on His name I call  
  
For the Lord is never weary  
His ways are beyond my thoughts  
I will trust in Him  
With all my heart  
(Repeat verses and Chorus)  
  
And I will rest upon His promise  
Patiently I'll wait...  
(Repeat Chorus 2 times)  
  
I will trust in Him  
With all my heart  
  
And I will rest upon His promise  
Patiently I'll wait...
