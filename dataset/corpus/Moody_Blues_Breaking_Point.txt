Is that the wind  
On your face?  
Are you sure you're alone?  
Are you sure you're alone?  
Feel the chill  
Of an empty space.  
Are you sure you're alone?  
Are you sure you're alone?  
  
In the middle of the night  
Is that your heart you hear  
Or a train to nowhere,  
That pounding in your ear?  
  
Have you reached your breaking point?  
Have you reached your breaking point tonight?  
  
Only when you're sleeping can you drift away.  
No one can hurt you.  
Listen to the secret of your dreams.  
Though you want to sleep forever  
Still you must return  
  
Hands of ice  
Down your spine.  
Are you sure you're alone?  
Are you sure you're alone?  
  
Feel the grip  
Of a clinging vine.  
Are you sure you're alone?  
Are you sure you're alone?  
  
In the middle of the night  
Is that your voice I hear  
Or the wind that's calling  
Back across the years?  
  
Have you reached your breaking point?  
Have you reached your breaking point tonight?
