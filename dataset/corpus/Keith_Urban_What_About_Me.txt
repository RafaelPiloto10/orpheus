I'm livin' in a world that won't stop pullin' on me  
I'm not complaining but it's true  
It's like I owe my time to everyone else  
'Cause that's all I seem to do  
  
You might not notice but I need a good friend  
Someone to talk to when I'm down, down, down  
There's so much on my mind that I want to get out  
But there's no one around  
  
[Chorus]  
Sometimes I can't help thinkin' what about me  
Some days go by that I don't even see  
Yeah I'm doing everything right and I can't break free  
Oh is this the way it's always gonna be  
What about me  
  
Well I'm dreamin' I'm on a highway with the windows down  
I'm burnin' up the road at my own speed  
But I'm stuck here goin' nowhere in this traffic jam  
And there's a woman with her kids in the car next to me  
And I swear she's singin'  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Oh what about me  
Hey what about me
