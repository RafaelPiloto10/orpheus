There are phantoms here on earth who take away our lives  
They kill your kids and they rape your wives  
They rip your flesh tear your heart take you down to hell  
They don't give a damn on any kind of life  
  
Phantoms bring evil, destruction and death  
Night after night the same old game  
They all look so harmless but deep in their hearts  
Satan is lurking, and he will break out  
  
Always someone at your back only waiting to attack  
  
[Chorus]  
Phantoms of death, phantoms of death  
  
The empire of deceivers is built upon your fear  
You'll have to lose it 'cause the end is near  
Warheads, armies stand to strike I know it isn't right  
I want to get out of here I don't want to die  
  
Infernal destruction of fire you'll burn  
Then you'll be helpless but it's not too late  
Stand up right now and you'll be the winner  
Or Satan will get you, take you forever  
  
Genocide everywhere, where's the Savior of this world  
  
[Chorus]  
Phantoms of death, phantoms of death  
  
Where is he the promised savior the one who'll save the earth  
Perhaps he'll come to bury us but then it'll be too late  
Who are they who are the phantoms who will end our lives  
It's you and me, you and me open up your eyes  
  
Phantoms bring evil, destruction and death  
Night after night the same old game  
They all look so harmless but deep in their hearts  
Satan is lurking, and he will break out  
  
We are all parasites of this world we shall die  
  
[Chorus]  
Phantoms of death, phantoms of death
