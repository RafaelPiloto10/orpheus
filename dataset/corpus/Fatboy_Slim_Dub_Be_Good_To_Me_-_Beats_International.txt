Tank fly boss walk jam nitty gritty  
You're listening to the boy from the big bad city  
This is jam hot  
This is jam hot  
Friends tell me I am crazy  
That I'm wasting time with you  
You'll never be mine  
That's not the way I see it  
Coz I feel you're glad you're mine  
Whenever you're with me  
  
People always talk about reputation  
I don't care about your other girls  
Just be good to me  
Just be good to me

Love is a game of chances  
So I'll take my chance with you  
And you I won't try to change  
We talk about it and I'd  
Rather have a piece of you  
Than out of nothing  
  
Just be good to me in the morning  
Just be good to me in the afternoon or evening  
Yeah just be good to me  
I'm not the jealous kind  
I won't tie you down  
When you need me  
I'll be around  
I'll be good to you  
You'll be good to me  
We could be together, be together  
  
(Just be good to me)  
(Just be good to me)  
(Just be good to me)
