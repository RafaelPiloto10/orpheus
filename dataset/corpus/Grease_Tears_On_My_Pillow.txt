You don't remember me, but I remember you  
't was not so long ago, you broke my heart in two  
Tears on my pillow, pain in my heart, caused by you, you  
  
If we could start anew, I wouldn't hesitate  
I'd gladly take you back, and tempt the hands of fate  
Tears on my pillow, pain in my heart, caused by you, you, you, you, you  
  
Love is not a gadget, love is not a toy  
When you find the one you love, he'll fill your heart with joy  
  
If we could start anew, I wouldn't hesitate  
I'd gladly take you back, and tempt the hands of fate  
Tears on my pillow, pain in my heart, caused by you, you  
  
No, no no no now, no, no no  
  
(You...)
