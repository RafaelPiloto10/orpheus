I met you on a Monday  
But Tuesday you stole my heart  
You gave me everything I ever wanted  
And then turned and walked away  
You just turned and walked away  
  
I get excited, excited  
Whenever you come around  
I get excited, always building me up  
And never letting me down, excited  
  
As simple as one, two, three  
I get excited  
That's what you're doin'  
What you're doin' to me  
  
That's what you're doin'  
That's what you're doin'  
  
Just when I thought I was over you  
Soon as I was sure you were gone  
I see you somewhere standin' 'cross the room  
But you turn and walk away  
You just turn and walk away  
  
I still get excited, excited  
Whenever you come around  
I get excited, always building me up  
And never letting me down, excited  
  
As simple as one, two, three  
I get excited  
That's what you're doin'  
That's what you're doin' to me  
  
That's what you're doin'  
That's what you're doin' to me  
  
That's what you're doin'  
That's what you're doin'  
  
Now that I know the problem  
The answer should be easy to find  
It takes common sense to simply convince him  
Not to turn and walk away  
Tryin' to get that man to stay  
  
I still get excited  
Whenever you come around  
I get excited, baby, always building me up  
And never letting me down, excited  
  
As simple as one, two, three  
I get excited  
That's what you're doin'  
That's what you're doin' to me  
  
That's what you're doin'  
That's what you're doin'  
Hey, way to get next to me  
Way to get next to me
