Oh everyday and just every night  
I see your face babe on my laptop screen  
You're high and low and just between  
Oh everyday and just every night  
I send an e-mail to the dream factory  
I asked if you're reality  
But more and more I like you more than just before  
  
Oh la da die, oh la da da  
Only a vision, Mrs. Robota  
Oh, oh, oh, la da die, oh la da da  
Only a computer, without a heart  
Oh Mrs. Robota, just a fantasy can't break my heart  
Mrs. Robota, only a fiction, right from the start  
It's impossible  
  
Oh every morning, when I wake up  
I push the bottom for a brand new game  
Can't live without you, it's a shame  
I hear your voice, and I see your face  
I can't believe, oh babe you blow my mind  
There is no answer, I can find  
And more and more I like you more than just before
