I crossed on the river  
There'll be no returning  
I crossed all the bridges  
I watched them all burning  
And now I'm a stranger  
To a strange land I'm driven  
Where all is forgotten  
And nothing's forgiven  
  
But I cried a river  
A river for him  
That's deeper and wider  
Than I'll ever swim  
The heart it will harden  
The sorrow will dim  
But I cried a river  
A river for him  
  
I think of him now  
On the road I am taking  
And wonder how long  
His heart will be breaking  
But he'll never hear when  
The teardrops are falling  
Or the sound of my voice  
And the name I'm calling  
  
But I cried a river  
A river for him  
That's deeper and wider  
Than I'll ever swim  
The heart it will harden  
The sorrow will dim  
But I cried a river  
A river for him  
  
So sweep for the sons  
And the dear darling daughters  
For the passing of time  
And the parting of waters  
For all who have passed through  
This world long before me  
To a far distant shore line  
Where no one waits for me  
But I cried a river  
A river for him  
That's deeper and wider  
Than I'll ever swim  
The heart it will harden  
The sorrow will dim  
But I cried a river  
A river for him
