You oughta know by now  
That a man can't hold on forever,  
So why do you keep waiting here  
When you know it makes me want you more?  
  
You oughta know by now  
How it fells to be loved,  
So why d'you keep me hanging here,  
With this stone around my heart, dragging me down, down, down  
  
When all I'm trying to do is trying to get next to you, let me in, let me in.  
  
You oughta know by now  
Or maybe someone should show you  
That a man needs to be loved  
And even in this man's world  
With you it don't come easy  
  
You oughta know by now  
That no man can sleep at night  
With a burning in his heart  
That would tear this man apart  
Take me out of my misery,  
  
Cause all I'm trying to do is trying to get next to you, let me in, let me in.  
  
You oughta know by now  
Just how good it feels to be wanted,  
And no man could love you more,  
So why can't you show me something,  
Just a little bit of something?  
  
You oughta know by now  
All the things a man has to do in his life,  
And all these things I do  
You know that I do it all for you, I do it all for you.  
  
Cause all I'm trying to do is trying to get next to you,  
Yes all I'm trying to do is trying to get next to you.  
  
Let me in, let me in,  
Let me in your heart.
