This year, next year  
Sometime never  
Paper dreams tied up  
With bits of string  
Darkness comes  
Flowers grow  
No-one knows  
I start counting  
I start counting  
  
Sitting by myself in a secret  
Chasing thoughts through rainbows in my mind, yeah  
Changing time  
Tomorrow's dream  
In between  
I start counting  
Counting, yes I do  
Counting, counting, counting, counting, counting  
Ooh-hoo-oo, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve etc.
