A son who is cursed with a harridan mother  
Or a weak simpering father at best  
Is raised to play out the timeless classical motives  
Of filial love and incest  
  
How does he  
Speak to a  
How does he speak to the prettiest girl  
How does he  
Talk to her  
What does he say for an opening line  
What does he say if he's shy  
  
What do you do with your pragmatic passions  
With your classically neurotic style  
How do you deal with your vague self-comprehensions  
What do you do when you lie  
  
How do you  
Speak to a  
How do you speak to the prettiest girl  
How do you speak to her  
How do you dance on the head of a pin  
When you're on the outside looking in  
  
How do you  
Speak to a  
How do you speak to the prettiest girl  
How do you  
Speak to a  
How do you speak to the prettiest girl  
  
You just say, hello, hello, hello baby
