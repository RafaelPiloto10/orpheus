Tonight would be the last night that we had our tea  
That bloody tea, which sent us into ecstasy  
Yesterday Mother complained, feeling dizzy, all in pain  
  
Mother's getting weaker, looking paler day by day  
  
As morning came, she could not make it out of bed  
And Grandma's spell was getting straight into her head  
Not a single word, she didn't seem to be alive  
  
Getting weaker, looking paler day by day  
  
Then Missy came in and she led me by the hand  
I didn't want to go, Oh but I should have known  
Mother was barely conscious, why should I care  
Just looking forward to the next ordeal  
  
I think I heard My sister begging me to stay  
She gave me the phone, so I could call someone for help  
I simply let go of her hand, then I cut the wire  
  
Missy was crying as I left them both behind  
And Mother's getting weaker, Missy shouted at  
My back "I hate you"
