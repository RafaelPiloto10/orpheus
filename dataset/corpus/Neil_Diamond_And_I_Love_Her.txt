I give her all my love  
That's all I do  
And if you saw my love  
You'd love her to  
And I love her  
She gave my everything  
And tenderly  
The kiss my lover brings  
She brings to me  
And I love her  
A love like ours  
Could never die  
As long as I  
Have you near me  
Bright is the stars that shine  
Dark is the sky  
I know this love of mine  
Will never die  
And I love her  
I love her  
I love her  
And I love her
