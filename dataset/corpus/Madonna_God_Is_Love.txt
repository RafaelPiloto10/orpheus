If God is love and love is God  
Then why're you acting like it's not  
Everyone's afraid to change  
Different doesn't make it strange  
Who decides what's right or wrong?  
Religion shouldn't separate  
Don't tell us who we're supposed to hate  
We can't deny the way we're made  
  
Never stop  
Never stop  
Never stop believing  
In what  
In what  
What you believe in  
Never stop  
Never stop  
Never stop believing  
  
The truth is like the air you're breathing  
  
Never stop  
Never stop  
Never stop believing  
In what, what you, what you believe in  
Never stop  
Never stop  
Never stop believing  
Never stop  
Never stop  
  
If God is love and love is God  
No magician sitting in the clouds  
Never let a set of rules  
Determine what you say or do  
Red's the colour we all bleed  
Let's all agree to disagree  
It's in every holy book  
Love your neighbor like you should  
  
Never stop  
Never stop  
Never stop believing  
In what  
In what, what you believe in  
Never stop  
Never stop  
Never stop believing  
  
The truth is like the air you're breathing  
  
Never stop  
Never stop  
Never stop believing  
In what, what you, what you believe in  
Never stop  
Never stop  
Never stop believing  
Don't you ever stop  
  
Moses had to lead the people  
Couldn't be slaves forever in Egypt  
Jesus didn't double your sins  
So you could treat other people like shit  
Muhammed heard Gabriel calling  
Have to save the people from falling  
All the prophets say the same words  
God is love  
And love should come first  
  
Never stop  
Never stop,  
Never stop believing  
In what  
In what, what you believe in  
Never stop  
Never stop  
Never stop believing  
The truth is like the air you're breathing  
  
Never stop  
Never stop  
Never stop believing  
In what, what you, what you believe in  
Never stop  
Never stop  
Never stop believing  
Don't you ever stop
