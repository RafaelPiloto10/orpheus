I been north, I been east, to the California beach  
There's only one place I know where to find you  
And you Southern girls got a way with your words and you show it  
You say hump and I'll jump  
You say go and I know, waste no time gettin' so close to you  
And you remember the way to find out that I wanted to thank you  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh baby needs some brand new shoes  
You get out on the street, you got nothing to lose  
I feel your crazy and everyone says it  
Southern girls, you got nothing to lose  
  
I've been up, I've been down  
I've been weak, I've been strong  
But I've never met someone like you  
And you'll never know that if I found you I'd thank you  
You say hump and I'll jump  
You say go and I know, waste no time gettin' so close to you  
And all you Southern girls got a way with your words and you show it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You might think this boy he loves you, Southern girl  
You make it hard, oh so hard  
I been north, I been east, to the California beach  
There's only one place I know where to find you  
And you Southern girls got a way with your words and you show it  
  
[Chorus]
