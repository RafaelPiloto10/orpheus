Grow up children, don't you suffer  
At the hands of one another  
If you like a sleeping demon  
Listen can you hear him weeping  
Tears of joy and tears of sorrow  
He buys love to sell tomorrow  
  
My life ain't no holiday  
I've been through the point of no return  
I've seen what a man can do  
I've seen all the hate of a woman too  
  
Feel your heartbeat lose the rhythm  
He can't touch the world we live in  
Life is short but love is strong  
There lies a hope that I have found  
And if you try you'll find it too  
Remember why I'm telling you  
  
My life ain't no holiday  
I've been through the point of no return  
I've seen what a man can do  
I've seen all the hate of a woman too  
  
And they gave him away  
Like in 'Whistle Down The Wind'  
By the look on his face  
He never gave in
