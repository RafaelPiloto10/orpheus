Out on the road like a low-down Joe  
And the bar where we are is so cool I'd like to stay  
Misunderstood like I knew I would be  
The one I care for don't mind, she's built that way  
I would gladly offer you my love  
In this hotel in Somewhere U.S.A.  
  
This rental car never went so far  
But with each passing mile on more dream has turned to clay  
Now that we've met and your eyes are all wet  
Let me fetch my guitar, there's a song I'd like to play  
I would gladly offer you my song  
In this hotel in Somewhere U.S.A.  
  
One never knows where the good times  
If you got some to spend,we'll do anything you say  
I'd never lie, well you know I've tried  
Though you think it's the drink that has made me behave this way  
I would gladly offer you my love  
In this hotel in Somewhere U.S.A
