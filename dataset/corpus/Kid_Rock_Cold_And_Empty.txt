Maybe I've been on the road too long  
Living my life through these songs  
I guess loving a music man  
Really wasn't in your plans  
  
Does it matter if I'm sorry again  
And why should I apologize  
You knew all along this was my life  
You know my in's and out's  
  
All of my fears and doubts  
It's the life I love but it's you I can't live without  
  
And this whole world seems cold and empty  
Someone please turn on the lights  
Lord if there's an angel you could send me  
I could use one here tonight  
  
Where am I supposed to go  
My only home was in your soul  
I know that I can't stay here  
And drown in a pool of tears  
Should I pack my pride and face this life alone  
  
And this whole world seems cold and empty  
Someone please turn on the lights  
Lord if there's an angel you could send me  
I could use one here tonight  
  
Maybe it's me who's cold and empty  
And in my darkness I cannot see the light  
Please God if there's an angel you could send me (if there's an angel)  
Cause there's one missing from my life  
  
You are my heart, you are my soul  
Wherever you are, that's where I go  
You know my in's and out's  
All of my dears and doubts  
  
It's the life I love but it's you I can't live without  
It's the life I love but it's you I can't live without  
Baby it's the life I love but it's you I can't live without  
Yeah, the life I love, the life I love, but it's you I can't live without
