Lay awake  
I don't give a shit  
If I even ever wake up in the morning  
Down below  
There's a pile of sin  
Always waiting for a  
Waiting for a warning  
  
Burned at the stake  
Inside I'm blistering  
Not a whisper  
Looking in you'd never know it  
Miles below  
I look up again  
When you snap they say  
Before you never show it  
  
Someone said it's all right  
Save it now, don't say it for my sake  
Someone said it's all right  
Faster now, you know I got no brakes  
  
Fuses glow  
Wounds festering  
Till the wind comes up  
And takes it to the last pow  
Back and forth  
Staring at the wall  
This room's a cage  
I know that something's got to give now  
  
Someone said it's all right  
Save it now, don't say it for my sake  
Someone said it's all right  
Faster now, you know I got no brakes  
  
No brakes
