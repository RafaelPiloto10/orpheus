Buzz Lightyear Sat on the Window  
Buzz Lightyear Had a Great Fall  
Sid Phillips and Scud the Dog  
Could Not Buzz Together Anymore  
  
Humpty Dumpty and Betty Louise  
Stole a Sony and some Camembert cheese  
And she said "Humpty baby  
Take me to the river  
Cause I like the way it runs  
Take me to the river  
You know I like the way it runs"  
  
He said "ah, ooh, everything's going my way"  
He said "maybe it's my lucky day"  
I said "anything you want I can give"  
She said "I want to take your picture, mm, just for me"  
He said "anything"  
She said "up there baby get on the wall babe"  
  
Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall  
And looked at her as he was falling and  
All the king's horses and all the king's men  
Couldn't put Humpty together again  
  
Hey Betty Louise Betty Louise  
She said "I like custard in the summer, honey"  
What it takes to be Queen  
What it takes to be Queen  
What it takes to be
