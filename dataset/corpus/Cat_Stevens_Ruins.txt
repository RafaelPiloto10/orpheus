It's so quiet in the ruins walking though the old town  
Stones crumbling under my feet I see smoke for miles around  
Oh it's enough to make you weep, all that remains of the main street  
Up in the park on Sunday, dogs chasing and the children played  
Old man with his head down, can't see nothing more around, no  
  
But he remembers how it used to be, back in the old days,  
So nice to see you coming back in this town again  
It's nice to see a friendly face come peeping through having tea  
In the afternoon, so nice to see you coming back in this town again  
  
Ah but it's all changed winter turned on a man  
Came down on day when no-one was looking and it  
Stole away the land, people running scared, losing hands  
Dodging shadows of falling sand, buildings standing like empty shells  
And nobody...helping no-one else  
Young child with his hands high, ain't able to see no reason why, no  
  
But he remembers how it used to be, back in the old days,  
So nice to see you coming back in this town again  
It's nice to see a friendly face come peeping through  
You'd better know what you're going through now  
You came back here to find your home is a black horizon  
  
That you don't recognize, evil destruction has taken everything  
You'd better walk on the side while you're still walking  
Just keep on walking on down the street keep your distance  
From the people you meet.  
  
Oh Lord and you'd better watch your eyes  
'Cause if smoke gets in them, baby you won't rise again.  
Where's it leading to freedom at what cost  
People needing more and more and it's all getting lost  
I want back, I want back  
Back to the time when the earth was green  
And there was no high walls and the sea was clean  
Don't stop that sun to shine, it's not yours or mine, no.
