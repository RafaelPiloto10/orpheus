You have loved me with energy  
Backed up with hard work and guts  
We inhabit eternity  
We fly forever in space  
  
The way we run together  
The way we breeze the miles  
We put our heads together  
And laughingly we smile  
  
It can't fall  
It can't fall  
Baby, it can't fall  
Death means nothing at all  
  
It can't fall  
It can't fall  
Baby, it can't fall  
Our love will outlive this earth  
  
Words have so many meanings  
Sometimes mean nothing at all  
Sometimes I feel so simple  
I don't know what's coming next  
  
We have swum in the ocean  
And that was really alright  
I'm not a big man  
It's hard to face the world  
  
It can't fall  
It can't fall  
Baby, it can't fall  
  
That would nail me to the wall  
  
It can't fall  
It can't fall  
Baby it can't fall  
Our love will outlive this earth  
  
It can't fall
