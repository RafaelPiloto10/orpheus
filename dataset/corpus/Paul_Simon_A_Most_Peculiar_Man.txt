He was a most peculiar man  
That's what Mrs. Reardon says  
And she should know  
She lived upstairs from him  
She said he was a most peculiar man  
He was a most peculiar man  
He lived all alone within a house  
Within a room, within himself  
A most peculiar man  
He had no friends, he seldom spoke  
And no one in turn ever spoke to him  
'Cause he wasn't friendly and he didn't  
Care  
And he wasn't like them  
O, no-o-o!  
He was a most peculiar man  
He died last Sat-ur-day...  
He turned on the gas! and he went to sleep!  
With the windows closed!  
So he'd never wake up!  
To his silent world!  
And his tiny room!  
And Mrs Reardon says he has a brother somewhere!  
Who should be notified so-oo-oon...  
And all the people said,  
What a shame that he's dead,  
But wasn't he a most peculiar man?
