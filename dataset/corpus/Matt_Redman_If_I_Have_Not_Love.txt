Jesus, I could sing  
In the tongues of men and angels  
But if I have not love  
I am just a clanging cymbal, and empty sound  
2x  
Chorus:  
This is a love song  
This is a love song  
Jesus, a love song to You  
A song of devotion, a reverent passion  
Savior, a love song to You  
Jesus, I could pray  
With a faith that moves a mountain  
But if I have not love  
It is just a noise resounding, an empty sound  
2x  
Chorus 2x  
This is a love song to You  
Hear our devotion  
Chorus  
It's the overflow of hearts  
As we gaze upon Your beauty  
A reflection of Your worth  
For we've seen a glimpse of You in Your glory, Lord
