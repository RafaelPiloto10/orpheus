[Verse 1]  
I like 'em brown, yellow, Peurto Rican or Asian  
Who have the weekend occasion  
Sneak in the Days Inn  
I'm never tweaking of haze an frequently blazing  
Now if they ain't on ya face it ain't the cheeks that I stay in  
Can't deny it, used to take weeks and persuasion  
Now I just be looking down at these freaks in amazement  
With a girl, The first thing I peep a notice  
Is how full her lips is and deep her throat is  
So you ain't gotta be perfect  
I'll buy you whatever you want, But your heads gotta be worth it  
Still what I mean is  
Your brains gotta send chills through my penis  
Till I feel like a genius  
Look at it from a player's position  
I got a scholarship, I get smart without paying tuition  
My classes be like two three hours  
That's why I'm the smartest young guy since Doogie Howser  
  
[Chorus]  
Still what I mean is  
I really just want to get smart until I feel like a genius  
And all that I ask is  
That you help me get good grades in all of my classes  
Still what I mean is  
I really just want to get smart until I feel like a genius  
And all that I ask is  
That you help me get good grades, Ma in all of my classes  
  
[Verse 2]  
These bitches they done got real bad  
Cause now I pull out, Leaving 'em looking like model for a got milk ad  
I'm a teachers pet  
And even if you good at math ma  
You'll have trouble counting each baguette  
All it takes would hood tutors and some good Buddha  
And promise to buy them some of them Razor foot scooters  
They don't care where the cops is  
Outta the blue they stop biz  
Teacher started giving me a pop quiz  
I stay 10 minutes in night clubs  
Pocket full of green, Duke on it invented the night bulb  
I might pass on a female, And call up a substitute just for night  
Class in the CL  
Ya man don't know why his chicks knees be scared  
Can't tell her from giving my dick CPR  
If ya lift up and say ya jaws hurting, before squrting  
It's for certain  
You are the weakest link, Goodbye  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
You know my girls in North and South Caddy  
They all for mouth waxing  
And the whores in Texas, Oral sexes  
I head to Cali, Take more blows to the head than Ali  
And the Philly mommy's suck the kid outta Willie Bonnie  
And the way females so Southern Hospitality in ATL  
Don't even know them hoes  
In South Beach, they let me jimmy dip in they mouthpiece  
Forget about Vegas, The head is outrageous  
The broads in Seattle will make ya knees rattle  
Fa shizzle da snizzle get smizzle down in VA  
Them hoes in Detroit will suck the whole revolt  
My dick don't get to die down when I'm in Chi-Town  
My bitches in be-More, Blow til they knees sore  
Good damn, there face I, ain't screwed down in St. Lou  
New York, It ain't got no pipe instructions  
They just suck outta you like liposuction  
  
[Chorus]
