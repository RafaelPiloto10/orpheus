The guys down at the job all want to know  
How things are going since I let you go  
I laugh and say my heart ain't missed a beat  
I've convinced everybody but me  
  
I'm all right, I'm okay,  
That's what I always say  
When they ask me how I'm doing without you  
I say I'm glad I'm free and if they all believe  
I've convinced everybody but me  
  
I'm the life of the party every night  
Nobody knows I'm dyin' deep inside  
I don't hurt at all as far as they can see  
I've convinced everybody but me  
  
I'm all right, I'm okay,  
That's what I always say  
When they ask me how I'm doing without you  
I say I'm glad I'm free and if they all believe  
I've convinced everybody but me  
  
I smile in every mirror  
Like I'm such a happy man  
But my heart knows what a liar I am  
  
I'm all right, I'm okay,  
That's what I always say  
When they ask me how I'm doing without you  
I say I'm glad I'm free and if they all believe  
I've convinced everybody but me  
  
Yes, I've convinced everybody but me
