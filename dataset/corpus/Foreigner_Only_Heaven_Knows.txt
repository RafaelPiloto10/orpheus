My intentions are good, my hearts in the right place now  
You see I wanna be good to you, baby but sometimes I just don't know how  
And the hand of fate, reaches out once more  
And pulls me though that gate, like one hundred times before  
Ooh, there are the nights, when things just work out right  
No one could be as close as you and me  
Then it all breaks down and we can't find that common ground  
That's not the way, the way it oughta be, baby, oh, oh  
Why do we laugh, why do we cry? Why do we feel this pain inside?  
Only heaven knows, only heaven knows  
In this game of hit and miss, how long can we go on like this?  
Only heaven knows, only heaven knows  
But if we threw it all away, it's something we'd regret someday  
Oh, heaven knows  
Why do we do these foolish things?  
Only heaven knows  
My intentions are good, my actions are hard to explain  
I get misunderstood sometimes, there's nobody but me to blame  
I've gotta speak my mind and deal with the situation  
Open the lines, the lines of communication  
Ooh there are the nights, we really get it right  
Makin' love, endlessly  
And then there are the days, we go our separate ways  
As though there's nothin' left of you and me, baby, oh no  
Nothin' left of you and me  
Why do we laugh, why do we cry? Why do we feel this pain inside?  
Only heaven knows, only heaven knows  
In this game of hit and miss, how long can we go on like this?  
Only heaven knows, only heaven knows  
But if we threw it all away, it's something we'd regret someday  
Oh, heaven knows  
Why do we laugh, why do we cry?  
Only heaven knows, only heaven knows  
Why do we feel this pain inside?  
Only heaven knows, only heaven knows  
But if we threw it all away, it's something we'd regret someday, oh  
Why do we do these foolish things?  
Only heaven knows, only heaven knows  
You see, I wanna be good to you, baby  
Heaven knows  
Why do we feel this pain inside?  
You see I wanna be good to you, baby  
Heaven knows, oh yeah  
Heaven knows, heaven knows
