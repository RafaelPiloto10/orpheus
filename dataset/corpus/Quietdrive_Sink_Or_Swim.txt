And we swim forever  
Stay the same forever  
  
I talked to you today  
You didn't seem depressed  
The way I acted was  
Nothing for you to test  
And I feel so sad  
That I've lost control  
  
So many chances I  
Feel like I must be wrong  
I'm misdirected by  
Communication's songs  
And I feel so sad  
That you wanted more  
  
And we swim forever  
Stay the same forever  
  
And we're wasting over  
Barren something  
Over nothing  
Like before  
We've been sidelined  
Resurrected  
Don't deserve it  
And what more  
  
And we're wasting over  
Barren something  
Over nothing  
Like before  
We've been sidelined  
Resurrected  
Don't deserve it  
And what more  
  
And we swim forever  
(And we swim forever)  
And we swim forever  
(And we swim forever)  
  
Wait until you  
Some know  
What'd you say
