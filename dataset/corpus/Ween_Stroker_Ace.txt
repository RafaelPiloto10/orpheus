Light up the wheels and go for broke  
Stomp that pedal with a sniftin stroke  
Smack that roadblock caught in a pickle  
I'm gonna hit that line like old Dick Trickle  
  
Well my motor's fine and this train's on time  
and when i cross that line i'm gonna make you mine  
  
I'm stroker ace, stroker ace, stroker ace  
  
Well it smells like poop and it sure looks crappy  
Gotta get back to north pappy flappy  
  
Well it's one a.m. and I'm rollin' in the car now  
Gonna hit last call down at the bar now  
Got a shammy in my pocket and it's burnin' a hole  
Stick it the floor and watch me roll  
  
Well my motor's fine and this train's on time  
and when i cross that line I'm gonna make you mine  
  
I'm stroker ace, stroker ace, stroker ace  
  
Well it smells like poop and it sure looks crappy  
Gotta get back to north pappy flappy
