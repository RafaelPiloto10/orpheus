I got a feelin' called blue'ue'ues  
Oh lord  
Since my baby said good-bye  
I'd don't what I'm gonna do  
All I do is sit and sigh  
Oh lord  
The last long day said good-bye  
Well I know how hard I would cry  
  
He'll do me  
He'll do you  
He's got that kinda lovin'  
Lord I love to hear it  
When he calls me sweet baby  
Such a beautiful dream  
I had to think it all o'over  
I lost my heart it seems  
  
Well I got some esteem somehow  
I'm nobody's sugar baby now  
I got the lo'o'onesome  
I've got the lovesick blues  
  
Well I'm in love  
I'm in love  
With a wonderful guy  
That's what's the matter with me  
I'm in love  
I'm in love with a wonderful guy  
But he don't care about me  
  
Well I've tried and tried  
To keep him satisfied  
But he just can't see  
And now that he is lea'ea'eavin'  
That is all I can say  
  
I got a feelin' called blue'ue'ues  
Oh lord  
Since my baby said good-bye  
I don't know what I'm gonna do'o'o  
All I do is sit and sigh, oh lord  
The last long day said good-bye  
Well I know how hard I would cry  
  
He'll do me  
He'll do you  
He's got that kinda lovin'  
Lord I love to hear it  
When he calls me sweet ba'a'aby  
Such a beautiful dream  
I had to think it all over  
I lost my heart it seems  
Well I've gone so  
Just for that man somehow  
I'm nobody's sugar baby now  
I got the lo'o'onesome  
I've got the lovesick blues, yeah  
I got the lo'o'onesome  
I've got the lovesick blues
