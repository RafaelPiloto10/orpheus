Road trip to New Orleans  
Or gettin' married in Vegas  
Sunsets down on the sand  
Lettin' loose and goin' crazy  
Somewhere, somebody tonight is falling in love  
And 325 horses can't get me to you fast enough  
  
[Chorus]  
Your lips around a Coca-Cola  
My hand on the wheel and your head on my shoulder  
Some things never go out of style  
Like you and me together  
Staring at your legs on the leather of my  
Red Camaro  
  
You got them cowgirl boots on  
That summer dress blowin'  
Girl, there ain't nothin' bout you that  
Don't get to me and you know it  
When it comes to love, it ain't ever changin'  
Same things will always get a boys heart racin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Pulling off on the side of the dirt road  
So many things that we know, but we don't know  
Discovering you by the glow of the dashboard light  
Falling in love in the middle of nowhere  
Maybe it's wrong, but it looks like we don't care  
It feels right, yeah, it feels so right  
Just like  
  
Your lips around a Coca-Cola  
My hand on the wheel and your head on my shoulder  
And some things never go out of style  
Like you and me together  
Oh, birds of a feather  
  
Your lips around a Coca-Cola  
One hand on the wheel and your head on my shoulder  
And some things just never go out of style  
Like you and me together  
Staring at your legs on the black leather, of my  
Red Camaro
