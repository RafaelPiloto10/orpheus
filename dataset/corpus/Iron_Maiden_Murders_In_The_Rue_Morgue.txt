I remember it as plain as day  
Although it happened in the dark of the night.  
I was strolling through the streets of Paris  
And it was cold it was starting to rain.  
And then I heard a piercing scream  
And I rushed to the scene of the crime  
But all I found was the butchered remains  
Of two girls lay side by side.  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Someone call the Gendarmes  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Run before the killers go free  
  
There's some people coming down the street  
At last there's someone heard my call  
I can't understand why they're pointing at me  
I never done nothing at all.  
But I must have got some blood on my hands  
Because everyone's shouting at me  
I can't speak French so I couldn't explain  
And like a fool I started running away.  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Someone call the Gendarmes  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Am I ever gonna be free.  
  
And now I've gotta get away from the arms of the law.  
All France is looking for me.  
I've gotta find my way across the border for sure  
Down the south to Italy.  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Someone call the Gendarmes  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
I'm never going home.  
  
Well I made it to the border at last  
But I can't erase the scene from my mind  
Anytime somebody stares at me, well  
I just start running blind  
Well I'm moving through the shadows at night  
Away from the staring eyes  
Any day they'll be looking for me  
'Cause I know I show the signs of...  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Running from the Gendarmes  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Running from the arms of the law  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Running from the Gendarmes  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Am I ever gonna be free  
  
It took so long and I'm getting so tired  
I'm running out of places to hide  
Should I return to the scene of the crime  
Where the two young victims died  
If I could go to somebody for help  
It'd get me out of trouble for sure  
But I know that it's on my mind  
That my doctor said I've done it before.  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
They're never gonna find me  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
I'm never going home.
