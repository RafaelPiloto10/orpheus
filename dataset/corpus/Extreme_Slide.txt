Find your groove  
Then drop the hammer  
Overtake  
But don't you kick  
A leg out of bed  
Gettin' loose  
Don't keep it matted  
A rooster tail  
And you're never  
Gonna qualify  
Never gonna qualify  
Slingshot  
Gotta hit the apex  
Sneak attack  
Yeah  
You are the the man  
On the move  
Dirty air  
Hangin' in a vortex  
Can you feel the rub?  
It's a shootout as we  
  
Slide it in  
Never gonna qualify  
Slide it in, no, no way  
  
Don't become  
An emotional wreck  
Take it slow, pit row  
You're moving to fast  
They can read  
Your telemetry  
Get you in, Get you out  
In less than fifteen  
Stop  
Get you some slicks  
Nice and tight  
Get your fine fresh rubber  
Take the flag  
And shake the champagne  
All your lizards  
Are waiting  
And ready to play  
Ready to play
