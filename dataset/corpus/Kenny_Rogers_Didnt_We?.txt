I think of all the times, I needed you  
And you would come to me, 'cause you wanted too  
And we built the fire that would last through the night  
Still be burnin' in the morning light.  
  
Oh, it must have had a thousand ways  
Of takin' our breath away  
We took a chance or two, didn't we?  
And made some mountains move, oh, didn't we?  
  
From out of the blue storm clouds came  
And it started rainin', we just let it rain  
Oh, it must've been a careless love  
Oh, it had to be a careless love  
Satin sheets, and no regrets  
We had it baby, we had the best, didn't we?.  
  
And every now and then  
I let my feelings show  
And though takes me a while  
Just to let you go  
'Cause you were more than a lover  
And more than a friend  
Never before and never again.  
  
Oh, it must've been  
  
Oh, it ought to be you and me  
Oh, we had a good, didn't we  
Didn't we, didn't we?
