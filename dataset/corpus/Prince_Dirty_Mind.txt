There's something about you, baby  
It happens all the time  
Whenever I'm around you, baby  
I get a dirty mind  
It doesn't matter where we are  
It doesn't matter who's around  
It doesn't matter  
I just want to lay ya down  
In my daddy's car  
It's you I really want to drive  
But you never go too far  
I may not be your kind of man  
I may not be your style  
But honey all I want to do  
Is just love you for a little while  
  
If you got the time  
I'll give you some money  
To buy a dirty mind  
Don't misunderstand me  
I never fool around  
But honey you got me on my knees  
Won't you please let me lay ya down (down, down, down)  
  
I really get a dirty mind (mind, mind, mind)  
Whenever you're around  
It happens to me every time (time, time, time)  
  
You just gotta let me lay ya  
Gotta let me lay ya, lay ya  
You just gotta let me lay ya  
Gotta let me lay ya down  
  
In my daddy's car  
It's you I really want to drive  
Underneath the stars  
I really get a dirty mind  
Whenever you're around  
  
I don't want to hurt you, baby  
I only want to lay you down
