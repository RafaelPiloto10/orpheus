I'm a cowboy too I got to wear loafer shoes  
I have to wear a tie and when I wear my hat it makes the baby cry  
I'm a station wagon champ I'm the king of summer camps  
I love what I do but I'm a cowboy too  
I can't go out at night get into barroom fights  
If I ever lost my cool they'd make me tell it all in Sunday school  
Well my horse wouldn't feel at home my neighborhood is zoned  
Some say it ain't true but I'm a cowboy too  
I'm a cowboy too hey you oughta taste my barbecue  
If you ever heard me pickin' guitar well you would exclaim he oughta be a star  
I'm in love with my wife I'm in love with my life  
I sometimes get the blues cause I'm a cowboy too  
I could drive a pickup truck if I had six thousand bucks  
I had cowboy boots before but they left marks on the kitchen floor  
I get in trouble wearin' a hat and the beer just makes me fat  
Well my kids are buckaroos and I'm a cowboy too  
I'm a country music fan I buy every tape I can  
The man down where I work said a beard and the hair make me look like a jerk  
Well my wife don't understand she's a Willie and Waylon fan  
I got some people fooled oh but I'm a cowboy too
