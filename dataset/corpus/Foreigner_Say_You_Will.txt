Say you will, say you won't make up your mind tonight  
Say you do, say you don't want to be mine  
Say you will, say you won't make up your mind this time  
Say you will, say you will be mine tonight  
I can't sleep, I keep dreaming of losing you  
I feel so alone in the night, scared to open my eyes  
I'm in too deep, I'm in over my head this time  
Can't get you out of my mind, no matter how hard I try  
So won't you say you will, say you won't make up your mind tonight  
Say you will, say you won't be my guide light  
Say you will, say you won't make up your mind this time  
Say you do, say you do, you want to be mine  
I get the feeling I've never been here before  
'cause no one I've known's ever moved me the way that you do  
And I know this is the real thing, it's all I've been searching for  
I put it all on the line, now I'm hoping you feel that way too  
And if you do, why don't you  
Say you will, say you won't make up your mind tonight  
Say you do, say you don't want to be mine  
Now will you say you will, say you won't make up your mind this time  
Say you will, say you will, you'll be mine tonight  
Will you tell me how much I mean to you, will you say you always will be true  
I need more than a come on sign, so won't you say you will be mine  
Now won't you say you will, say you won't make up your mind tonight  
Say you will, say you will be my guide light  
Say you will, say you will make up your mind this time  
Say you do, say you do, you want to be mine  
Come on, come on, say you will make up your mind tonight  
Say you will, say you will be mine tonight  
Be mine tonight, say you will (repeats out)
