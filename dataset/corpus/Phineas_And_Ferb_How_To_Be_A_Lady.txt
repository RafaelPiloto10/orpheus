(Spoken) It's frightfully difficult to be a lady.  
There's so many P's and Q's you have to mind.  
(Sung) But the rewards, I'm sure you'll find, are rich and varied,  
And worth all of the effort, you will find.  
Your posture must be perfect,  
Your diction crisp and clear  
Your speaking voice mellifluous and pleasing to the ear,  
Your legs are crossed when seated  
Your toes are pointed so  
Your pinkies raise while drinking  
But that's not all you need to know...  
  
(Tune changes to a heavier punk sound)  
  
You mustn't curse or spit or tattle, never gossip  
A lady never scratches, sweats, or burps  
She knows which knife and fork and spoon to use and when  
And if soup is served it's impolite to slurp  
  
It's always "please and thank you, sir or madam"  
Never brash or loud or putting on a show  
A lady is demure, reserved and proper  
And that is really all you need to know
