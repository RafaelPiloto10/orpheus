You looked a little cold to me so I gave you that  
Army green jacket that was in my trunk  
It didn't fit, you didn't care, a little chill was in  
The air and you were just warming up  
You smiled and we sang  
  
I wanna thank the band, whoever they  
Were for playing our song  
And all the stars up there for getting in line  
And shining down on  
That boardwalk you and I strolled down  
Light's dancing on the water from the merry-go-round  
We made a lot of memories, ain't no doubt  
But there's only one summer young  
  
I stood behind you while you swayed and looked down  
At your pretty face, thought "Man I'm fallin' hard for her"  
Yeah, we get those memories now and then, the kind you pray  
Will never end and that's exactly where we were  
I smiled while you danced  
  
I wanna thank the band, whoever they  
Were for playing our song  
And all the stars up there for getting in line  
And shining down on  
That boardwalk you and I strolled down  
Light's dancing on the water from the merry-go-round  
We made a lot of memories, ain't no doubt  
But there's only one summer young  
  
Every time we hear it now (every time we hear it now)  
It's gonna take us back  
  
I wanna thank the band, whoever they  
Were for playing our song  
And all the stars up there for getting in line  
And shining down on  
That boardwalk you and I strolled down  
Light's dancing on the water from the merry-go-round  
We made a lot of memories, ain't no doubt  
But there's only one summer young  
  
Oh, summer young  
Summer young  
Ooh, summer young
