We're gonna be breakin' it down (Yeah!)  
You gotta know the feel  
You gotta know the life  
You know what I'm sayin' (Hey!)  
I said what's goin' wrong  
You know it just ain't right  
Tell me who be loud  
When the spark ignite  
Now from the break daylight  
To the fall of the sun  
You gotta pick your fight  
It's time to choose your gun  
Chorus:  
Front to back  
Right to left  
Keep it live all night  
Make it hot to death  
Get your heart pumpin' like some crystal meth  
Keep it live all night  
Make it hot to death  
Well...  
Hey...  
Tell me who's your God  
Does he make a lotta dough  
I'm gonna take you higher  
Or to the fire below  
Chorus  
Guns to roses  
Abraham to Moses  
Daylight exposes what the night conceals  
Let's break these seals  
And get this thing started  
Some be out classed  
Some be out smarted  
Some be over bound by the blindin' rays  
I hear the whisper in the night  
Get trapped in the maze  
See back in the days  
When I was juvenile  
I dreamed of rockin' on the mic  
In a brand new style  
Now I'm shakin' these bones  
Tryin' to get these shoes  
Outbidded major crews  
I'm paid crazy dues  
Now I'm speakin' on you  
They just slept on me  
And rumors start spreadin'  
Just like a disease  
I'll have you down on your knees  
Below the spot ground zero  
Turn brown and burn down Rome just like Nero  
A hero ain't nothing but a  
Don't make me say it again  
Legend  
Don't make me say it  
Chorus  
That's what I'm sayin (2x)
