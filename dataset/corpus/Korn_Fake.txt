I can't stand the sight of you  
I can't stand what you put me through  
Your life's a lie that you hide  
Is it that terrible being you inside?  
I can't stand, oh, the thought of you  
I can't stand all the things you do  
What do you try to justify?  
  
You are just too scared to be you inside  
Let it all go  
I look at you  
All I see is a man too afraid to really be  
I can't stand what you put me through  
I can't stand even the thought of you  
Your secret lies that you hide  
Is it that terrible being you inside?  
Let it all go  
  
You try so hard to be wanted  
False emotions tells you fronted  
I think being a person relies on one thing  
  
Be yourself, let you come through  
You're too afraid to really be  
Someone who isn't false and doesn't care to be  
Be yourself, let you come through!  
Fake!
