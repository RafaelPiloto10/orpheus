Mind, of destructive taste  
I choose... to stroll amongst the waste  
It was your heart  
Lost in the dark  
  
Call off the chase  
Walls of thought, strong and high  
As my castle crumbles with time...  
I think of you  
Oh, yes I do  
Such a crime  
  
[Chorus]  
You opened fire... and your mark was true  
You opened fire... aim my smiling skull at you  
You opened fire...  
  
I live tomorrow, you'll not follow  
As you wallow in a sea of sorrow  
Lines cut across my face  
Why you laugh at my disgrace  
  
I'll never know  
How far to go  
To reach that place  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I live tomorrow, you'll not follow  
As you wallow in a sea of sorrow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeat: x 4]  
I live tomorrow, you'll not follow  
As you wallow in a sea of sorrow
