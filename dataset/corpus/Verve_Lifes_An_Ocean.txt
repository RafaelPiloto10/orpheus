Life's an ocean  
Too much commotion, too much emotion  
Dragging me down  
Living for today, don't have time to pray  
Ready for the game  
Take a line of fickle flame  
  
Imagine the future  
Woke up with a scream  
I was buying some feelings  
From a vending machine  
Say that I will see  
Something more than I have  
There's something inside of me  
Crying out for something else  
And if someone hears my scream  
Put it in a letter to me  
Slippery slimy road down  
  
Life's an ocean too much commotion  
  
Not enough emotion to satisfy me  
Slippery slidy road down  
It's slippery slidy road down  
  
Hold my hand and we'll walk down  
Dry those eyes and we'll walk down  
  
Slippery slidy road down  
Life's an ocean, life's an ocean  
Too much commotion, too much emotion
