Hello there... this is the CENTRAL SCRUTINIZER... Joe was sent to a special
prison where they keep all the other criminals from the music business... you

the inside, where musicians and former executives take turns snorting
detergent and plooking each other...

promo man for a major record company, named Bald-Headed John . . . King of the
