You were conceived at the right time everything about you blows my mind  
Thought I'd been in love before now I just got my foot in that door now  
There's never been anyone like you for me  
All the rest have been two's and three's  
Darling from now on and on and on you're gonna be number one  
Number one in my book and now in my life  
Number one and you're still by my side  
Number one is ways I've never known before number one someone I love so  
[ sax ]  
Since you've come along life's been a joy  
That's a turn around for this ol' boy  
Over me and next to none you're gonna be number one  
Over me and next to none you're gonna be number one
