Communication's never been  
As easy as today  
And it would make me happy  
When you've gone so far away  
If you'd send me an e-mail  
That says 'I love you'  
Send me an e-mail  
That says 'I love you'  
  
Now time and distance  
Melt away  
No digital delay  
And some things  
Can be written down  
That we're too shy to say  
Send me an e-mail  
That says 'I love you'  
Send me an e-mail  
That says 'I love you'  
  
There may be other  
Temptations in your life  
Don't want to add more  
Complications to your life  
But I'm sending this e-mail  
To say 'I love you'  
  
Now there's a ghost  
Within this house  
You're haunting me tonight  
I'm looking at some photographs  
And thinking that I might  
Jump on a plane  
And surprise you where  
You are  
But do you want me there?  
I'm so insecure  
But one thing would make me sure  
If you'd  
Send me an e-mail  
That says 'I love you'  
Send me an e-mail  
That says 'I love You'
