There's nothing here inside of these walls  
I feel like I am so far away  
Nothing's changed  
And I just can't be who I'm supposed to be  
I let the past control my life  
It brings me to my knees  
And I can not hide  
I can not lie  
  
So many words to say and no one to hear  
Why did you go away?  
I needed you more today that I ever did  
You lied to me  
  
Outside it's cold  
It chills to the bone  
I wish that I did not have to see  
  
I let the past control my life  
It brings me to my knees  
And I can not hide  
I can not lie  
  
So many words to say and no one to hear  
Why did you go away?  
I needed you more today that I ever did  
You lied to me
