Dirt is quiet, it don't make noise  
It's fun to play with, especially for boys  
Girls don't much like it but that's okay  
Boys don't like girls much anyway.  
  
Dirt, dirt, good ol' dirt  
Dirt, dirt, good ol' dirt  
It may sound silly but it really don't hurt  
To sing about good ol' dirt.  
  
It hurts just a little if it gets in your eyes  
You can put it in water and make mud pies  
Babies will eat it but babies are dumb  
They wet their diapers and suck on their thumbs.  
  
Dirt, dirt, good ol' dirt  
Dirt, dirt, good ol' dirt  
It may sound silly but it really don't hurt  
To sing about good ol' dirt.  
  
It don't cost a thing 'cause it's everywhere  
You can take it back home and nobody cares  
You can throw it and kick and it don't even hurt  
So a kid's best friend just got to be dirt.  
  
(Dirt, dirt, good ol' dirt)  
(Dirt, dirt, good ol' dirt)  
(It may sound silly but it really don't hurt)  
(To sing about good ol' dirt.)  
  
Dirt, dirt, good ol' dirt  
Dirt, dirt, good ol' dirt  
It may sound silly but it really don't hurt  
To sing about good ol' dirt.  
  
I love good ol' dirt
