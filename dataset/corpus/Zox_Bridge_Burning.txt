I am stopping by to tell you  
I'll be leaving here for good,  
To go back to where I came from,  
Like you always said I should.  
I would be a liar if I said that I was fine,  
'Cause you opened up my head  
And you lost some of my mind.  
  
I've been a fool.  
I've been full of you.  
I've been lying here so long I don't know who I'm lying to.  
But I'm set on fire  
In spite of you.  
I will burn another bridge and hope the river burns up too.  
When I'm gone,  
You'll be gone too.  
  
Our hands are stained the color of the sky above our heads,  
With things we haven't done  
And words we haven't said.  
Still the pain will come as some surprise.  
When you burn a bridge the smoke gets in your eyes.  
  
No, I've been a fool.  
I've been full of you.  
I've been lying here so long I don't know who I'm lying to.  
But I'm set on fire  
In spite of you.  
I will burn another bridge and hope the river burns up too.  
When I'm gone,  
You'll be gone too.  
  
The ashes blow away,  
Trailing sheets of rain  
All along the interstate  
Somewhere into space.  
I've got no place for ashes,  
I've got no place for ashes,  
I've got no place for ashes anyway.  
  
I've been full of you.  
I've been lying here so long I don't know who I'm lying to.  
But I'm set on fire  
In spite of you.  
I will burn another bridge and hope the river burns up too.  
When I'm gone,  
When I'm gone,  
When I'm gone,  
You'll be gone too.
