I'm Flash, I'm the hero  
I'm the bopper who's the poppa of the crew  
I'm Flash, and I fight evil  
And my spaceship flies the red, white and blue  
I'm Flash, like a streaker  
You'll find me cruising out among the stars  
And I'm feared by every outlaw  
And every renegade from Jupiter to Mars  
The jails are full in Saturn and I can tell you why  
'Cause I'm the full-blasting, protoblasting hero of the sky  
On Mars the smugglers starve no matter what they try  
'Cause I'm the everlasting, flabber-ghasting guy who's flying high  
I'm Flash, yeah, I'm the hero  
From the starspangled U.S of A  
I believe in packin' punchin' power  
And hitting fast 'cause that's the only way  
I'm Flash  
I'm Flash, and I'm a mover  
My spaceship glides at twice the speed of light  
I'm Flash, and I'm a He-Man  
I'm a six foot one inch block of dynamite  
I'm Flash, in shining armor  
And I love to rescue damsels in distress  
And my wave length is always open so I can answer any call of S.O.S  
I've been in trouble of the worst kind ever since I left the womb  
I'm a death defying, terrifying spotlight in the gloom  
When you see me coming, boys, just give me lots of room  
'Cause I'm the liquifying, crucifying harbinger of doom  
I'm Flash, I'm the hero  
I'm the bopper who's the poppa of the crew  
I'm Flash, and I fight evil  
And my spaceship flies the red, white and blue  
You know, my spaceship flies the red, white and blue  
I said, my spaceship flies the starspangled red, white and blue  
I'm Flash, spelled F L A S H
