All those sleepless nights  
All the tears I cried  
All the pain I kept inside  
I kept asking myself why  
You had to say goodbye  
  
Was it just a dream  
When you said to me  
That there is someone new in your life  
You could have at least lied  
The truth just scared me  
  
Even if...  
You mean the whole damn world to me  
I can forget you  
Wait and see  
I can be strong even without you  
I can't waste my life forever  
Hoping you'd come back to me  
But deep inside  
I know I'll be waiting here for you  
  
Even if...  
You mean the whole damn world to me  
I can forget you  
Wait and see  
I can be strong even without you  
I can't waste my life forever  
Hoping you'd come back to me  
But deep inside  
I know I'll be waiting here for you
