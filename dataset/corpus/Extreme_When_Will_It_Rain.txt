No one ever sees you cry  
You just keep it all inside  
In a warm place, where you can hide  
  
When will it rain  
When will it rain  
I saw you laugh the other day  
But all too fast it went away  
  
Now your sky's cloudy 'n' gray  
Falling mainly on the plain  
  
When will it rain  
When will it rain  
No water fallls  
Down your window pane  
  
And when I look into your eyes  
That window to your soul can't lie  
There's water where the well went dry  
  
So how long can there be a drought  
When your dam's filled with doubt  
No place to build your house  
Let your cup runneth over and out  
I said for crying out loud  
  
When will it rain  
When will it rain  
No water fallls  
Down your window pane  
When will it rain  
When will it rain  
A tear for fear is calling out your name  
  
Rain on me
