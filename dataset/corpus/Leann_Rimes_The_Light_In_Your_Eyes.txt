Life can take your dreams and turn them upside down  
Friends will talk about you when you're not around  
Reality can really cut you down to size  
But don't ever lose that light in your eyes  
Don't ever lose that light in your eyes  
  
People make you promises they'll never keep  
Soon you'll know why people say talk is cheap  
And life resembles one big compromise  
But don't ever lose that light in your eyes  
  
Keep on shining  
Keep on smiling  
Don't lose faith and don't lose heart  
When you're crying  
Just keep trying to remind yourself  
you're a shining star  
Yes you are  
  
Somewhere down the line you'll face the judgment day  
When the angels look at you, what will they say?  
They've got a way of knowing who qualifies  
Just let 'em see that light in your eyes  
  
Don't ever lose that light in your eyes  
Keep on shining  
Keep on smiling  
Don't lose faith and don't lose heart  
When you're crying  
Just keep trying to remind yourself you're a shining star  
Yes you are  
  
Don't ever lose that light in your eyes  
Don't ever lose that light in your eyes  
Don't ever lose  
Don't ever lose
