Yo, I'm a dedicate this to everybody that was at Woodstock '99  
DMX, Limp Bizkit, Sheryl Crow amongst many  
Yo, just before I got on stage this chick came on to me  
She offered me sumthin  
It looked kinda strange, it was in a bag  
I said "Yo, girl let me talk to you real quick"  
Yo  
  
I don't sniff cocaine 'cause it mess up my brain  
For sexual stimulation I never did no ecstasy  
I don't pop pills, I never did no LSD  
but I wouldn't mind a kiss from Ms. Mary  
'Cause  
  
She's homegrown and you can hold her in her backyard  
She's homegrown and you can get a kiss in her backyard  
  
I remember when I was a young boy  
I waited for my grandad, "So daddy can I get a puff?"  
He looked at me, he says "Son, man, you're too young kid"  
"When you get older now and you understand that"  
"I let you get one kiss from Ms. Mary"  
'Cause  
  
She's homegrown and you can grow her in her backyard  
She's homegrown and you can hold her in her backyard  
If she allows you to you can roll her up  
She's homegrown and you can kiss her in her backyard  
She's homegrown - I like to be with you Ms. Mary - in your backyard  
  
That's when she looked at me and she said  
"Wyclef this' what I want you to do son"  
  
Come on  
Inhale - exhale  
Exhale - inhale  
Inhale - exhale  
Now hold it now  
Inhale - exhale  
Inhale - exhale  
Exhale - inhale  
Now breath in my face  
  
Marijuan' Marijuan'  
  
She said that  
She's homegrown and you can grow her in her backyard  
She's homegrown, she said "'Clef, I'll kiss you in my backyard"  
And my daddy don't need to know  
She said that  
I'm homegrown and you can grow me in your backyard  
I'm homegrown and you don't need to worry for my backyard  
  
That's when I said, "I'ma get in trouble, I gotta go girl"  
This' what she said  
Laa la-laa laa laa, strictly la-la, to take me higher, and higher (2X)  
Laa la-laa laa laa, strictly la-la, to take me higher  
  
I'm about to take it higher  
I'm about to take it higher  
I'm about to take it higher  
I'm about to take it higher  
  
Come on y'all, come on y'all, come on
