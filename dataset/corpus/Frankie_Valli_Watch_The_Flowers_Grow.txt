(Watch the flowers grow, watch 'em grow)  
Did you ever see a flower grow?  
If you did then you would surely know  
Love is like the flowers,  
Takes a lot of hours  
If you really want to know,  
Watch the flowers grow.  
  
Listen to my thoughts and take a ride,  
I shall give you all you've been denied  
First you gotta slow down,  
Listen to my sweet sound  
If you really want to know,  
Watch the flowers grow.  
  
Over the mountain there's a sweet meadow  
A breeze is blowin', so take my hand and we can  
Watch the flowers grow  
  
Let me take you where the flowers grow  
Let me be the one who told you so  
I'll love you forever,  
I will leave you never  
Baby let's go,  
Watch the flowers grow.  
  
(Watch the flowers grow, watch 'em grow)
