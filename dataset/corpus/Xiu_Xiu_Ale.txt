Shut up shut up  
I wanna hear that pin pricking  
Shut up shut up  
I wanna hear that nail scrape  
Shut up shut up  
Up your insipid voice  
Shut up shut up  
  
Is that your glass heart clinking?  
I want to go to bed every second  
Wrap your arms around your kitty  
She won't cuddle up to your disgusting feet  
She's not the only one who won't  
  
The gamecube is on  
Its tender buttons hide  
Crazy is the place your gigantic fat body fits  
Crazily it fits into any bed  
Shut up shut up  
I wanna hear that pin pricking  
Shut up shut up  
I wanna hear that nail scrape  
Shut up shut up  
Up your insipid voice  
Shut up shut up  
  
Is that your glass heart clinking?  
What's done is done  
It cannot be undone  
What's done is done  
It cannot be undone  
What's done is done
