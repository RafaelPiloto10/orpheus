Hi! I got to go,  
Get aboard, attack a love jet, heaven and back.  
My-my-my-my-my-my-my.  
  
And I gotta find a power station with a beat, I  
Can't take no conversation.  
My-my-my-my-my-my-my.  
  
Looking for the inspiration.  
All succumb to the physical fascination,  
All succumb to the physical fascination.  
  
Hi! Shake shake it up, this love divine,  
You're out of touch, babe, I'm going out of my mind.  
My-my-my-my-my-my-mind.  
  
Talk to me! Why don't you talk to me?  
C'mon and use your body language,  
And have yourself a good time.  
My-my-my-my-my-my-my.  
  
And radiate your sweet temptation.  
All succumb to the physical fascination,  
All surrender to the physical fascination.  
Yea yea yea yea.
