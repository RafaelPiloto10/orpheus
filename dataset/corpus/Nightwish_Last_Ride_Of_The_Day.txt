We live in every moment but this one  
Why don't we recognize the faces loving us so  
  
What's God if not the spark that started my life  
Smile of a stranger  
Sweet music, starry skies  
Wonder, mystery wherever my road goes  
Early wake-ups in a moving home  
Scent of fresh-mown grass in the morning-sun  
Open theme park gates waiting for  
  
Riding the day, every day into sunset  
Finding the way back home  
  
Once upon a night we'll wake to the carnival of life  
The beauty of this ride ahead such an incredible high  
It's hard to light a candle, easy to curse the dark instead  
This moment the dawn of humanity  
The last ride of the day  
  
Wake up, Dead Boy  
Enter adventureland  
Tricksters, magicians will show you all that's real  
Careless jugglers, snake charmers by your trail  
Magic of a moment  
Abracadabra
