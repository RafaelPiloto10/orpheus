Yo, yo, I wanna be close to you  
  
Anytime that you go,  
Girl I'm gonna miss you so  
I wanna be close to you, close to you  
With my head in the clouds  
Oh my heart is crying loud  
Oh I wanna be close to you, close to you  
And I know, you are my angel  
But angels are not flying low  
And I know, oh you are my angel  
And I'll never let you go  
  
A summer in December  
Love we just remember  
A summer love in winter  
I always will remember  
  
And the way you look tonight,  
Make the stars shine bright  
I wanna he close to you, close to you  
Every step on my way, every word I will say  
I wanna be close to you, close to you  
And for me, it was like heaven  
Everything will turn out fine  
And for me, it's like a heaven  
Baby give it some more time
