Well, a twister tore the roof off a grocery store  
Blew an Idaho potato through the hardwood floor  
Twirled granny's apron up around her head  
The cat's still missin' and the dog is dead.  
  
Well, ain't love a lot lot that  
Ain't love a lot like that  
Unconditional, unpredictable  
Ain't love a lot like that?  
  
Just like Moses and the Red Sea water  
A little bit of faith and the ring I bought her  
I hit my knees and she took my hand  
And she lead my heart to the promised land.  
  
Ain't love a lot lot that  
Ain't love a lot like that  
Unconditional, unpredictable  
Ain't love a lot like that?  
  
Well, the honeymoon's over and the work begun  
My baby say I'm gettin' on her nerves again  
One false move and an angry shout  
I'm sleepin' all alone on the fold out couch.  
  
Ain't love a lot lot that  
Ain't love a lot like that  
Unconditional, unpredictable  
Ain't love a lot like that?  
  
Ain't love a lot that  
Now ain't love a lot like that  
Unconditional, unpredictable  
Ain't love a lot like that?  
  
Unconditional, unpredictable  
Ain't love a lot like that?  
  
Ain't love a lot like that?
