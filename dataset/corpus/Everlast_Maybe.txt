Maybe you could take a little piece of my pain  
Maybe you could make it all feel the same  
Maybe you could burn this night in my brain  
Maybe you could find someone else to blame  
For all this pain, maybe, maybe, maybe  
Maybe you could tell me about your worst fear  
Don't say it out loud, whisper in my ear  
Ain't never felt nothing like this here  
Maybe you could see things a little more clear  
Dry away your tears  
I love you are just three words that are overused when we're talking  
Love and friendship, situations get confusing so often  
Maybe I should give this woman my name, a piece of my pain  
Maybe, maybe, maybe  
Maybe we could talk about all my dreams  
Watch them all come apart at the seams  
Sometimes when it rains it really teams  
Sometimes they cut diamonds with laser beams  
Whatever that means  
I love you are just three words that are overused when we're talking  
Love and friendship, situations get confusing so often  
Maybe I should give this woman my time, that would be fine  
Maybe, maybe, maybe  
I love you are just three words that are overused when we're talking  
Love and friendship, situations get confusing so often  
Maybe I should give this woman my name, a piece of my pain  
Maybe, maybe, maybe
