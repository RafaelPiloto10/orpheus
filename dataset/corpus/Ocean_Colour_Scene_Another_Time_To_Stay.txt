Had another dream, oh yeah  
The play was rolling slowly  
Had another dream, oh yeah  
But I could not see you only  
  
Just hold me  
'cause lying in your arms it's you I have  
Yeah, lying in your arms it's you I have  
  
This is another time to stay  
This is another time to stay  
Though I don't think my dreams will see the day  
  
All of us bring a smile  
Mine's broken, please stay
