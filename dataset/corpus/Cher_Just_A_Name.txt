Just A name  
Writer Sonny Bono  
  
It's just a name, it's just a name  
It's not too long and it's kinda plain  
He's just a guy, just a little guy  
And he's not too brave, not too shy  
And he'll never make me stay  
And he's not very much of a mystery  
He's not even handsome, nor is he tall  
But there's no way I could live at all  
Without his funny name  
  
He's just a guy, just a little guy  
That can make me laugh  
That can make me cry  
Did I mention this before  
He's got all I want and even more  
But he gives me all that he has to give  
And I guess that's why I just couldn't live  
Without his funny name  
  
She's just a girl, she's just a girl  
Her hair is straight she don't have a curl  
She's not so hot, I mean what's she got  
She's got all that I want and even more  
She's the girl I love, that I adore  
Cause she gives me all that she has to give  
And I guess that's why I just couldn't live  
Without her funny name  
  
Just a name  
It's just a name  
It's just a name  
It's just a name
