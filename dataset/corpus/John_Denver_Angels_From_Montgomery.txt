Named after my mother  
My old man is another  
Child that's grown old  
If dreams were lightning  
And thunder were desire  
This old house would have burnt down  
A long time ago  
  
[Chorus:]  
Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery  
Make me a poster of an old rodeo  
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to  
To believe in this livin' is just a hard way to go  
  
When I was a young girl  
I had me a cowboy  
He weren't much to look at  
Just a free ramblin' man  
But that was a long time  
And no matter how I try  
The years just flow by  
Like a broken down dam  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
There's flies in the kitchen  
I can hear 'em in there buzzin'  
And I ain't done nothin'  
Since I woke up today  
How the hell can a person  
Go to work in the mornin'  
Come home in the evenin'  
And have nothin' to say?  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
