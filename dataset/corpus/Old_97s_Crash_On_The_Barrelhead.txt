You're gonna crash on the barrelhead son  
You'll regret the things that you done  
One of these days you're gonna rue  
All the messed up things you do  
You're gonna die the way you live  
And the way you drink you're like a river  
Bound for falls and not much fun  
You're gonna crash on the barrelhead son  
You're gonna wake up in your shoes  
No one you love, watching you  
You'll hate you're face when the morning shines  
On the mirror frame and your guilty mind, go  
You're gonna crash on the barrelhead son  
And do the walls know what you done?  
And do they listen in on you?  
Do the walls know what you do?  
You're gonna wake up in your shoes  
No one you love, watching you  
You'll hate you're face when the morning shines  
On the mirror frame and your guilty mind  
On the mirror frame and your guilty mind  
On the mirror frame and your guilty mind
