Bring it Down, band!  
Now , I just came here tonight to say  
I just want to say  
I just want to say  
  
Merry Christmas baby, you surely treat me nice  
Merry Christmas baby, you surely treat me nice  
I feel just like I'm living in paradise  
  
Now listen  
Now you see, I feel real good tonight  
And I got music on the radio  
And I feel good tonight  
And I got music on the radio  
And I feel just like I want to kiss you  
Underneath my mistle-toe  
  
But now listen  
Santa came down chimney, half past three  
With lots of nice little presents for my baby and me  
Merry Christmas baby, you surely treat me nice  
And I feel like I'm living, just living in paradise  
Come on boys  
  
Well now  
Santa came down chimney, half past three  
With lots of nice little presents for my baby and me  
Merry Christmas baby, you surely treat me nice  
And I feel like I'm living, just living in paradise  
  
And I just came down to say, Merry Christmas baby  
I just want to say, Merry Christmas baby
