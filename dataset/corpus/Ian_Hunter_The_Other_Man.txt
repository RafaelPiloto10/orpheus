I forgive you when you can't look straight into my eye  
I forgive you when you never want to hold my hand  
I forgive you 'cause you're all I've got and I love you  
But I'll never forgive the other man  
  
I forgive you even though I know the secret you keep  
I forgive you even though you don't give a damn  
I forgive you 'cause deep inside you're part of me  
But I'll never forgive the other man  
  
Somewhere in the night he's calling  
And somewhere in your heart you're falling  
  
I'll forgive you when you stay out late and you never phone  
I'll forgive you even though I'll never understand  
I'll forgive you 'cause you're all I've got and I love you  
But I'll never forgive the other man  
  
Somewhere in the night he's calling  
And somewhere in your heart you're falling  
  
I'll forgive you when you stay out late and you never phone  
I'll forgive you even though I'll never understand  
I'll forgive you 'cause you're all I've got and I love you  
But I'll never forgive the other man  
No, I'll never forgive as long as I live  
No, I'll never forgive the other man  
I said I'll never never never forgive  
No, I'll never forgive the other man
