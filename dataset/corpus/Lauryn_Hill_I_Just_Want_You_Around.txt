I just want you around,  
I just want you around  
I just want you around,  
I just want you around  
  
Thought that I had lost you  
I could hardly make a sound  
When I thought I couldn't hold you  
Knew the world had let me down  
Should have took the time and told you  
You keep my feet on the ground  
I hope that you can hear me  
Cause I know it's not profound  
  
I just want you around,  
I just need you around  
I just want you around,  
I just need you around  
  
When I thought I was without you  
I got used to being down  
Was my fault I used to doubt you  
But that ain't me next time around  
Please believe me when I tell you  
Cause all my words are bound  
This is my cross so let me bear it  
I was lost but now I am found, found, found  
  
I just want you around,  
I just need you around  
I just want you around,  
I just need you around  
  
Took this love for granted  
Kept my feelings under ground  
Should have watered what I planted  
Should have known what I had found  
I'm not used to being lonely  
I don't like the way it sounds  
You're the only one I know yeah  
Who don't turn my upside down  
  
I just want you around,  
I just need you around  
I just want you around,  
I just need you around
