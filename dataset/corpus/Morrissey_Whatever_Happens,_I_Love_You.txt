Names, secret names  
But never in my favor  
But when all is said and done  
It's you I love  
  
Cold loving prose  
We stole each other's clothes  
But when all is said and done  
It's you I love  
  
Yes, yes, yes, oh, yes  
Oh no, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes  
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes  
Oh...  
Yes, yes...  
  
Fights for rights  
Everyone's oh so quick with advice  
And when they've all said their piece  
It's still you I love  
Now just like then  
  
Then, then, then  
Then, then, yes, yes  
No, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes  
Yes, yes, oh...  
Mmm...
