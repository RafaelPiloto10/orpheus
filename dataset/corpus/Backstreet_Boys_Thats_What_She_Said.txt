There are people who say what you want to hear  
Even on a rainy day they'll tell you the sky is clear  
When you really, really love someone  
And I'm right when I say that you want them near  
And if you can't even tell  
Them things that they want to hear  
  
[Chorus]  
Always forever, all the things she said  
Never say never, those simple lies that she fed  
I will never leave you  
All the love I thought she had  
But can you blame me, no,  
'Cause that's what she said  
That's what she said  
She told me we'd see forever  
That's what she said, she said, yeah  
  
And,  
There are people who that say what they really mean  
She said she'd always be there  
She said she'd always care  
But just when you think that you can trust that someone ya love  
Tell me why do you know  
How stars can fall from above  
  
[Chorus]  
  
'Cause you made promises that you couldn't keep  
But you're not hurting' yourself  
But you're only hurting me (you're only hurting me)  
Why would you say things that you really didn't mean  
Oh how can I make you see just-a what you did to me  
  
Oh, you said how much you really cared  
Just when I thought I was in love  
Girl, how could you dare  
If I were you I wouldn't lie not even-a once  
To the face of the one that I love so much  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh that's what she said
