Time and again I've longed for adventure  
Something tn make my heart beat the faster  
What did I long for I never really knew  
Finding your love I found my adventure  
Touching your hand my heart beats the faster  
All that I want in all of this world is...  
  
... You are the promised kiss of springtime  
That makes the lonely winter seem long  
You are the breathless hush of evening  
That trembles on the brink  
Of a lovely song  
  
You are the angel glow that lights a star  
The dearest things I've known are what you are  
Someday my happy arms will hold  
And someday I'll know that moment divine  
When all the things you are, are mine  
  
Dah-dah-dah  
  
Someday my happy arms will hold  
And someday I'll know that moment divine  
When all the things you are, are mine  
Too-too-mm-dah-dah-dah
