Feedback blasting out my ears  
Makes me so high  
I love all the monitor men  
But why are they alive  
The van is making me crazy  
It's just like being in the navy  
  
Doomsday, doomsday's coming - 1981  
But until things blow  
I'm gonna have some fun  
The bubble's going to explode  
Probably never live to get old  
  
[Chorus:]  
But I just want to have some fun  
Probably won't see no money  
I just want to have some fun  
Before they throw me in the sanitarium  
  
Feedback blasting out my ears  
Makes me so high  
I love all the monitor men  
But why are they alive  
Well Monte's making me crazy  
It's just like being in the navy  
  
[Chorus]
