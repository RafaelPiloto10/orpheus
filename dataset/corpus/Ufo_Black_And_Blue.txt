He walked into the sunset  
He walked out of the dawn  
He rode that Palomino  
It was a one man storm  
  
Oh is this the party  
Ah I just got started  
  
He disappeared fell down the cracks  
He walked out never came back  
  
Oh black and blue  
What are we gonna do with you  
Oh black and blue  
I guess baby that we're through  
Falling down the stairs  
Falling out of cars  
Lying in the gutter  
Just looking at the stars  
Oh black and blue  
Who's been beating up on you?  
  
Oh is this the party  
Ahh I just got started  
  
It was the biggest circus in town  
They came from far and wide  
Consuela and her sisters now  
Couldn't hold the tide  
  
She was a girl with a diamond smile  
Lost herself on the golden mile  
  
Oh black and blue  
What are we gonna do with you  
Oh black and blue  
I guess baby that we're through  
Falling down the stairs  
Falling out of cars  
Lying in the gutter  
Just looking at the stars  
  
Oh black and blue  
What are we gonna do with you  
Oh black and blue  
I guess baby that we're through  
Oh black and blue  
Who's been beating up on you  
Oh black and blue  
We're stuck together  
With just a little glue now  
  
He was a man sad and over  
Caught a bus back to California  
Oh black and blue  
Look what loves done to you  
Who's been beating up on you  
Out of this cuckoos nest  
I guess you flew  
Where are you tonight  
Oh black and blue  
Who's been beating up on you  
Turn out the light  
My baby's in flight
