What about sunrise?  
What about rain?  
What about all the things that you said  
We were to gain?  
What about killing fields?  
Is there a time?  
What about all the things  
That you said were yours and mine?  
  
Did you ever stop to notice  
All the blood we've shed before?  
Did you ever stop to notice  
This crying Earth, these weeping shores?  
  
Ah, ooh  
Ah, ooh  
  
What have we done to the world?  
Look what we've done  
What about all the peace  
That you pledge your only son?  
  
What about flowering fields?  
Is there a time?  
What about all the dreams  
That you said was yours and mine?  
  
Did you ever stop to notice  
All the children dead from war?  
Did you ever stop to notice  
This crying earth, these weeping shores?  
  
Ah, ooh  
Ah, ooh  
  
I used to dream  
I used to glance beyond the stars  
Now I don't know where we are  
Although I know we've drifted far  
  
Ah, ooh  
Ah, ooh  
Ah, ooh  
Ah, ooh  
  
Hey, what about yesterday  
(What about us)  
What about the seas  
(What about us)  
The heavens are falling down  
(What about us)  
I can't even breathe  
(What about us)  
  
What about apathy  
(What about us)  
Burnt despite our pleas  
(What about us)  
What about the holy land  
(What about it)  
Torn apart by creed  
(What about us)  
  
Where did we go wrong  
(ooo, ooo)  
Someone tell me why  
(What about us)  
  
What about babies  
(What about it)  
What about the days  
(What about us)  
What about all their joy  
Do we give a damn
