He rattles his glass, she jumps up fast  
And pours him a glass of tea  
Deep in her heart she believes  
That's the way it should be  
And I've seen my dad get fighting mad  
Over one little four letter word  
He'll tell you fast, you don't talk like that  
Around her  
  
We may not see it the way they see it  
We may not do it the way they do it  
But she lives her life for him and he'd gladly die for her  
And even in this modern age, it works  
  
Though he's down in his back, he still jumps out of that sack  
Every morning at 5:00 a.m.  
But having her home with the kids  
Has been worth it to him  
And she takes pride in being his wife  
And making their house a home  
Sometimes she wishes the world would just  
Leave them alone  
  
We may not see it the way they see it  
We may not do it the way they do it  
But she lives her life for him and he'd gladly die for her  
And even in this modern age, it works  
  
If the good lord's willing  
There will come a day  
When our children will say  
  
We may not see it the way they see it  
We may not do it the way they do it  
But she lives her life for him and he'd gladly die for her  
And even in this modern age, it works  
  
And even in this modern age, it works
