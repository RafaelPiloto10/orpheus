When I offer you survival  
You say it's hard enough to live  
It's not so bad, it's not so bad  
How do you know that you're right?  
  
I awoke on the roadside  
In the land of the free ride  
And I can't pull it any longer  
The sun is beating down my neck  
  
So I ran with the devil  
Left a trail of excuses  
Like a stone on the water  
The elements decide my fate  
Watch it go  
(Bling)  
  
When I offer you survival  
You say it's hard enough to live  
Don't tell me that it's over  
Stand up for a Tiber more than this  
  
How do you know that you're right?  
If you're not nervous anymore  
It's not so bad, it's not so bad  
  
I feel my vision slipping in and out of focus  
But I'm pushing on for that horizon  
I'm pushing on  
Now I've got that blowing wind against my face  
  
So you sling rocks at the rip tide  
Am I wrong or am I right?  
I hit the bottom with a 'huh!'  
Quite strange  
I get my glory in the desert rain  
Watch it go  
(I offer you survival!)  
  
When I offer you survival  
You say it's hard enough to live  
And I'll tell you when it's over  
Shut up for a Tiber more than this  
  
How do you know that you're right?  
If you're not nervous anymore  
It's not so bad, it's not so bad  
  
Higher and higher  
We're gonna take it  
Down to the wire  
We're gonna make it  
Out of the fire  
Higher and higher  
  
Higher and higher  
We're gonna take it  
Down to the wire  
We're gonna make it  
Out of the fire  
Higher and higher  
  
Higher and higher  
We're gonna take it  
Down to the wire  
We're gonna make it out  
Whoa, oh, oh, higher and higher  
  
It ain't hard to hold  
When it shines like gold  
You'll remember me
