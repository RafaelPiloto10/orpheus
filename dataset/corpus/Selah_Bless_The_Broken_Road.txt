I set out on a narrow way  
Many years ago  
Hopin' I would find true love  
Along the broken road  
But I got lost a time or two  
I wiped my brow  
Kept pushin' through  
I couldn't see how every sign  
Pointed straight to you  
  
And every long lost dream  
Led me to where you are  
Others who broke my heart  
They were just northern stars  
Pointing me on my way  
Into your lovin' arms  
This much I know is true  
That God bless the broken road  
And led me straight to you.  
  
I think about the years I spent  
Just passin' through  
I'd like to take the time I lost  
And give it back to you  
But you just smile and take my hand  
You've been there you understand  
It's all part of His grander plan  
That is coming true.  
  
And every long lost dream  
Led me to where you are  
Others who broke my heart  
They were just northern stars  
Pointing me on my way  
Into your lovin' arms  
This much I know is true  
That God bless the broken road  
And led me straight to you.  
  
Now I'm just rollin' home  
Into your lovin' arms  
This much I know is true  
That God bless the broken road  
And led me straight to you.  
Yes, God bless the broken road  
And led me straight to you
