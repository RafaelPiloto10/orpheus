I don't buy your true life stories  
'cause I've seen the way you lie  
but I don't mind the things you tell me  
because I know we'll say anything to get by  
  
but when we're together  
somehow I feel better  
my disease always tricks me  
I believe you can fix me  
  
you're insane  
I love the drama  
tell the truth  
you love it too, I know you do?  
  
reason strikes  
we fight and break up  
'cause it seems  
the easiest thing to do  
  
but when I don't get your call  
I go into withdrawal  
you consume every thought  
but if you called I would tell you to get lost  
  
I need you like a drug  
I need you, I need you like a  
I need you, I need you like a  
drug  
  
it turns me on  
to say "I love you"  
but deep inside I know  
it's lust, not love at all  
  
one day we will leave each other  
but we pretend the end's not inevitable  
I require protection from my own obsession  
in the object of you  
  
one day I will rise above you  
  
I need you, I need you like a drug  
I need you, I need you like a  
I need you, I need you like a drug  
I need you, I need you like a...  
  
until then we'll stay together  
I guess things could be much worse  
I guess things could be much better  
but I don't really want to write another verse  
  
'cause when we're together  
somehow I feel better  
my disease always tricks me  
I believe you can fix me  
  
I need you, I need you like a drug  
I need you, I need you like a  
I need you, I need you like a drug  
I need you, I need you like a drug
