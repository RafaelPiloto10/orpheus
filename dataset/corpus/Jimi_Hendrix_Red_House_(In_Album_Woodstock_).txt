There's A red house over yonder  
oh, that's where my baby stays  
lord there's A red house over yonder  
lord that's where my baby stays  
  
I ain't been home to see my baby  
I've just been in jail ninety-Nine and one half days  
yeah, that's A long time if you know what I meen  
wait minute something's wrong  
This key won't unlock this door  
  
Wait A minute something's wrong  
Oh the key won't unlock this door  
hey, I have A bad feelin'  
lord, my baby don't live here no more  
she didn't say A damn thing about leaving but I still got my guitar  
  
Hey, I think I'll go back over yonder  
way back over yonder across the hills  
Hey, I think I'll go back over yonder baby  
way back over yonder across the hills  
  
Hey, my baby don't love me no more  
lord, I know good and well that her sister will  
  
Jimi:  
"yeah well A like I said before we only ran up A few numbers so let  
me try and do this one like we were just jammin' at the house we don't have  
A name for yet it's just like an instrumental so we'll just go along with it.  
It goes somthin' like this. "
