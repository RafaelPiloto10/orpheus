Nick:  
  
Baby Wipe your eyes  
Cause I don't want to see you cry  
I don't want you thinking I'm a bad guy  
Sometimes I say some things  
That I don't really mean  
The last thing that I want is you mad at me  
I know I know what I got to do  
To get a get a smile out of you  
Make my lips touch my nose  
Cross my eyes until I go blind  
Before I go blind  
  
Backstreet Boys:  
  
Every time I think your sad I just make a funny face  
(Make a funny face yeah)  
Even when I make you mad I put on my funny face  
(On my funny face)  
I like it when you smile (I like when you smile)  
I love it when you laugh (I love it when you laugh)  
I love it when you do it to so let me see your funny face (yeah)  
  
Nick:  
  
It tickles me to see your trying not to laugh at me  
'Cause we both know your not as tough as you seem  
I know you want to laugh (come on)  
I know you want to laugh (come on)  
I know you want to laugh come on  
Laugh with me come on
