She'd slip away each day with the dimming light  
And with the sweetest smile she'd kiss the child goodnight  
At the mill she'd work her fingers till they were raw  
For the sake of her son and the daddy he never saw  
  
Mary danced with soldiers  
She stepped a light quadrille  
Shawl across her shoulders  
To keep away the chill, to keep away the chill  
  
It was a rebel boy who brought her joy they say  
Though the years had passed the memories stood fast each day  
Before a bullet crushed the life of their romance  
He gave her a shawl and a parasol from France  
  
Mary danced with soldiers  
She stepped a light quadrille  
Shawl across her shoulders  
To keep away the chill, to keep away the chill  
  
They came around to the tavern in town that night  
And with silent cries Mary never tried to fight  
They cut her hair and left her body torn  
Her spirit slipped away before the dawn  
  
Mary danced with soldiers  
But now her body's still  
Shawl across her shoulders  
To keep away the chill  
  
Mary danced with soldiers  
She stepped a light quadrille  
Shawl across her shoulders  
To keep away the chill, to keep away the chill
