Open the gate to the red land  
Alcan road, by the turquoise lake  
Starry skies, a mushroom cloud  
Folding waves, in a foamy tide  
  
Washing in beds, of opal shells  
white gulls cry, for you and I  
butterflies, float away  
drift over pools, of salt and clay  
  
mountain man, frosted child  
eagles cry, puppets of god  
strung like time, molded in form  
trees bend back, and trails distort  
  
it leads to the land, of Alcan Road  
the turquoise lake, and starry skies  
mushroom clouds, folding waves  
foamy tides, of salt and brine
