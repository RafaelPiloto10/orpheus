jingle bells upon a steel guitar  
thru the clouds we see the same bright star  
  
Mele Kalikimaka is the thing to say  
On a bright Hawaiian Christmas Day  
That's the island greeting that we send to you  
From the land where palm trees sway  
  
Here we know that Xmas will be green and bright  
Sun will shine by day and all the stars at night  
Mele Kalikimaka is Hawaii's way  
To say Merry Christmas to you.
