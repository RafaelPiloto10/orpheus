Everyone is searching for the  
Meaning of our life.  
Reading 'bout the hell and heaven  
Believing all those lies.  
  
Look upon yourself  
Imagine you are two  
Power lies within this is true.  
  
Can't you see its clear like a mirror  
It's all within what you're searching for  
  
Magic mirror, magic mirror  
Magic mirror, magic mirror  
  
Now your eyes are open,  
and you know you were a fool.  
You always had the power,  
But you never broke the rules.  
  
Look upon yourself  
Imagine you are two  
Power lies within this is true  
  
Can't you see its clear like a mirror  
It's all within what you're searching for  
  
Magic mirror, magic mirror  
Magic mirror, magic mirror  
  
Once again I say,  
The strength that we are all searching for,  
High and low we all looked in vain  
Can't you see, it's clear like a mirror.  
It's all within what you're searching for.  
  
Magic mirror, Magic mirror  
Magic mirror, Magic mirror
