Standing alone in the night  
People talk around me  
Under the neon street light  
Tryin' hard to hold on  
I need somebody's love to  
Surround me  
Tossing a coin in the air  
Making my decision  
What has gone wrong with my life  
I've drunk all my religion  
I need somebody's love  
To remind me  
I won't be lonely tonight  
All I want's another baby  
I won't be lonely tonight  
All I need's another baby  
Heads I leave town in the night  
Tails I drink a bottle  
If it should land on its side  
I'll return to love you  
I need somebody's life to  
Surround me  
I won't be lonely tonight  
All I want's another baby  
I won't be lonely tonight  
All I need's another baby  
And this is the last time  
I wanna be  
I'm gonna be  
I won't be lonely tonight  
All I want's another baby  
I won't be lonely tonight  
All I need's another baby
