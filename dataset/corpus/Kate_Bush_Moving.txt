Moving stranger does it really matter?  
As long as you're not afraid to feel  
Touch me, hold me, how my open arms ache  
Try to fall for me  
  
How I'm moved, how you move me  
With your beauty's potency  
You give me life, please don't let me go  
You crush the lily in my soul  
  
Moving liquid, yes, you are just as water  
You flow around all that comes in your way  
Don't think it over, it always takes you over  
And sets your spirit dancing  
  
How I'm moved, how you move me  
With your beauty's potency  
You give me life, please don't let me go (please don't let me go)  
You give me life, please don't let me go (please don't let me go)  
Oh, you give me life, please don't let me go  
You crush the lily in my soul  
Soul
