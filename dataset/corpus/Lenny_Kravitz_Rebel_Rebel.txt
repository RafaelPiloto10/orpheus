Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo  
  
You've got your mother in a whirl  
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl  
Hey babe, your hair's alright  
Hey babe, let's go out tonight  
  
You like me, and I like it all  
We like dancing and we look divine  
You love bands when they're playing hard  
You want more and you want it fast  
  
They put you down, they say I'm wrong  
You tacky thing, you put them on  
  
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress  
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess  
Rebel rebel, how could they know?  
Hot tramp, I love you so!  
  
Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo  
  
You've got your mother in a whirl 'cause she's  
Not sure if you're a boy or a girl  
Hey babe, your hair's alright  
Hey babe, let's stay out tonight  
  
You like me, and I like it all  
We like dancing and we look divine  
You love bands when they're playing hard  
You want more and you want it now  
  
They put you down, they say I'm wrong  
You tacky thing, you put them on  
  
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress  
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess  
Rebel rebel, how could they know?  
Hot tramp, I love you so!  
  
They put you down, they say I'm wrong  
You tacky thing, you put them on  
  
Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress  
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess  
Rebel rebel, how could they know?  
Hot tramp, I love you so!  
  
You've torn your dress, your face is a mess  
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test  
You've got your transmission and your live wire  
You got your cue line and a handful of ludes  
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes  
And I love your dress  
Because your face is a mess  
?? ?  
So how could they know?  
How could they know?  
I say I could they know?  
How could they know?  
How could they know?
