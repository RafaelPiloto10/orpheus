Oh la la la, oh oh la la la  
Oh la la la, oh oh la la la  
Oh la la la, oh oh la la la  
Oh la la la, oh oh la la la  
  
I gave you just about the best years of my life  
I might be lax on my views of the world  
I can't explain the politics of your affairs  
But there is one thing that I know and say each day  
  
Oh la la la, oh oh la la la  
Oh la la la, oh oh la la la  
  
Life ain't so easy  
I know you've heard it all before  
When you stop movin'  
There's always something more  
Closed up in front of you  
And closin' up in back  
Don't you stop givin' up  
When now you should attack, attack  
  
Oh la la la, oh oh la la la  
Oh la la la, oh oh la la la  
  
Don't have a clue to know what's going on  
You say you need some time to live alone  
Tell me you're sorry so you say  
I don't believe a single word you say  
  
Oh la la la, oh oh la la la  
Oh la la la, oh oh la la la  
Oh la la la, oh oh la la la  
Oh la la la, oh oh la la la
