Standin' at the airport  
Lookin' down the strip,  
She was cryin' her eyes,  
She was bitin' her lip.  
747 just left from gate eleven  
And there's no turnin' round  
'cos it's just leavin' the ground  
And gettin' higher.  
  
Standin' at the dock-side  
  
Lookin' out to sea  
When I saw her there  
But she did not see me.  
There she stood with no hope  
Because she'd missed the boat  
And as her dreams sailed away  
She headed back for the day,  
Back to the city.  
  
Night in the city, oh oh oh,  
Madness at midnight,  
Night in the city  
Drivin' you insane.  
  
I was runnin' kinda lonely  
At the city place.  
I waited for an hour,  
Never saw her face.  
Crazy ladies that wait  
And slide around like a snake  
I just can't take anymore,  
I'm going in through the door  
Into the city.  
  
Night in the city, oh oh oh,  
Madness at midnight,  
Night in the city  
Drivin' you insane.
