Every move I make  
Every rule I break  
Makes me want it more  
Every step I take  
Every new mistake  
Each revolving door  
Keeps me searching for you  
There's nowhere for you to hide  
'Cause a feelin's got me reelin'  
And I'm twisted up inside  
  
Don't you know I got a thing that looks for you  
Don't you know the way you make me feel about you  
Don't you know I got a place that waits for you  
Don't you know that I'm always thinking of you  
  
I got a rocket in my pocket  
But I don't know what to do  
Like a plug without a socket  
I'm just waitin' 'round for you  
  
Don't you know I got a thing for you  
Don't you know the way you make me feel about you  
Don't you know I got a thing that looks for you  
Don't you know that I'm always thinking of you  
  
I got a rocket in my pocket  
I don't know what to do  
Like a plug without a socket  
I'm just waitin' 'round for you
