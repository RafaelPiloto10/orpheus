Looking out my window  
An angel in robes appeared and nearly pulled me apart  
A million miles of freedom, a million miles of road,  
But I still don't know where to start  
  
She wrote her number down  
And she gave it to me  
They had to scrape me off the floor  
In this transient town, waiters and dealers  
Trying to get their foot in the door  
  
That night I called her and she said  
"Daddy daddy daddy, all my life  
I've been trying to find my place in the world"  
And I said to her  
"Baby baby babe, I got all night to listen to the heart of a girl"  
  
I can see the time drippin' down the clock,  
We've been trying to hear that ancient refrain  
It's the one that knows just when our heads are down  
And reminds us of the place from where we came  
Where we came  
  
"Daddy daddy daddy, all my life  
I've been trying to find my place in this world"  
"Baby baby babe, I got all night to listen to the heart of a girl"  
  
What happened here, what is this world?  
It's too far from the heart of a girl  
A ripple in the water  
From the drop of a pearl  
I'm on the shore waitin'  
For the heart of a girl  
  
Many doors, knock on one  
Standin' still, time is raging  
Staring down the mouth of a hundred thousand guns  
And you're still here, you're still here  
  
I believe that we never have to be alone  
Yes I believe it's just around the bend  
You can hold it in  
Or you can scream it on a microphone  
There is no end (there is no end)  
There is no end (there is no end)  
  
And, deep in the night, I feel the presence  
Of something that was long ago told to me  
There is a hand, guiding the river  
The river to wide open sea  
And deep in my heart, in and again  
On any mountain, no I'm not afraid  
Standing on stone, you stand beside me  
And honor the plans that were made
