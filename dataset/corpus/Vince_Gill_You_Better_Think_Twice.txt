I kow it ain't none of my business  
When it comes to the affairs of your heart  
It's really hard for me to say this  
But you trouble's gettin' ready to start  
Well I've heard you say how much you love him  
You think someday you'll be his bride  
Baby, you just can't trust him  
'Cause I've known the boy all of my life  
  
So you better think twice before you roll the dice  
You better think twice before you give you heart away  
  
You really must think I'm something  
Talkin' trash about my best friend  
I just hate to se eyou wind up with nothing  
'Cause you're way too good for him  
And I know that you don't believe me  
But I've been with him when he's runnin' around  
He don't mean to hurt nobody  
He ain't never gonna settle down  
  
So you better think twice before you roll the dice  
You better think twice before you give you heart away  
  
You better think twice  
You better think twice  
You better think twice  
You better think twice
