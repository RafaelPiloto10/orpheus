Love is a positive vibration  
With love you find the good in a bad situation  
Everybody's gonna need a helping hand  
It don't really matter where you stand  
You're gonna need someone to lean on  
  
Hate is a constant inflammation  
A fire that's built on fear and frustration  
One man's heaven is another man's hell  
Every story has got two sides to tell  
Don't let anybody pull you under  
  
Some people just love to hate  
They criticize when they can't relate  
Some people don't love, they just love to hate  
  
Some people can hardly wait  
To tear down what you create  
Cause some people don't love, they just love to hate  
  
Somebody attacks without a reason  
He's just trying to drag you down in the hole that he's in  
Why are people so negative  
I think that everybody ought to just live and let live  
We could use a little understanding  
  
Chorus  
  
I guess some people been pushed around  
Now they're trying to even it up by putting somebody else down  
I believe that things can only get better  
When everybody learns to live together
