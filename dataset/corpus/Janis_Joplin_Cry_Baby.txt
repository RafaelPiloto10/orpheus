Cry baby, cry baby, cry baby,  
Honey, welcome back home.  
  
I know she told you,  
Honey I know she told you that she loved you  
Much more than I did,  
But all I know is that she left you,  
And you swear that you just don't know why,  
But you know, honey I'll always,  
I'll always be around if you ever want me  
Come on and cry, cry baby, cry baby, cry baby,  
Oh honey, welcome back home.  
  
Don't you know, honey,  
Ain't nobody ever gonna love you  
The way I try to do ?  
Who'll take all your pain,  
Honey, your heartache, too ?  
And if you need me, you know  
That I'll always be around if you ever want me  
Come on and cry, cry baby, cry baby, cry baby,  
Oh daddy, like you always saying to do.  
  
And when you walk around the world, babe,  
You said you'd try to look for the end of the road,  
You might find out later that the road'll end in detroit,  
Honey, the road'll even end in kathmandu.  
You can go all around the world  
Trying to find something to do with your life, baby,  
When you only gotta do one thing well,  
You only gotta do one thing well to make it in this world, babe.  
You got a woman waiting for you there,  
All you ever gotta do is be a good man one time to one woman  
And that'll be the end of the road, babe,  
I know you got more tears to share, babe,  
So come on, come on, come on, come on, come on,  
And cry, cry baby, cry baby, cry baby.  
  
And if you ever feel a little lonely, dear,  
I want you to come on, come on to your mama now,  
And if you ever want a little love of a woman  
Come on and baby baby baby babe babe baby now  
Cry baby yeah.
