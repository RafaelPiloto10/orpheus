The lord is my sheperd I shall not want  
He makes me lie down in green pastures.  
He leads me beside the still waters.  
He restoreth my soul  
And guides my path in righteousness  
For his name's sake.  
  
Surely goodness and loving kindness  
Shall follow me al the days of my life.  
And I will dwell in the house of the lord  
Forever and ever and ever.  
  
Though I walk through the valley  
Of the shadow of death  
I will not fear, thou art with me.  
Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.  
Thou preparest a table  
Before me in the presence of my enemies.  
  
Thou anointest my head with oil  
My cup's overflowing  
  
Surely goodness and loving kindness  
Shall follow me al the days of my life.  
And I will dwell in the house of the lord  
Forever and ever and ever.
