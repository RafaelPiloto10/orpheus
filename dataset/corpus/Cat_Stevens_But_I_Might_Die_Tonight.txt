I don't want to work away  
Doing just what they all say  
Work hard boy and you'll find  
One day you'll have a job like mine  
  
'Cause I know for sure  
Nobody should be that poor  
To say yes or sink low  
Because you happen to say so, say so, you say so  
  
I don't want to work away  
Doing just what they all say  
Work hard boy and you'll find  
One day you'll have a job like mine, job like mine, a job like mine  
  
Be wise, look ahead  
Use your eyes he said  
Be straight, think right  
But I might die tonight!
