hide inside my head  
i cant stand all the things they said, made me crazy  
born into hate never to appreciate  
me or you or things i should do  
  
was i ever innocent  
little boy lost inside his self  
dont know where i can hide  
but inside  
who will free me?  
  
take it all away  
blinded from another day  
sparks fly in my closed eyes  
as i hide from the demons inside  
where will i run tomorrow?  
will i soon have footsteps to follow?  
can you tell me where is my soul?  
guess thats the devils toll  
  
was i ever innocent  
little boy lost inside his self  
dont know where i can hide  
but inside  
who will free me?  
  
you dont know who i am  
you dont know where ive been  
so dont act like you do  
cause you dont ever want to know the truth
