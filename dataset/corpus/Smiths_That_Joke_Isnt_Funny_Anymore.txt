Park the car at the side of the road  
You should know  
Time's tide will smother you  
And I will too  
When you laugh about people who feel so  
Very lonely  
Their only desire is to die  
Well, I'm afraid  
It doesn't make me smile  
I wish I could laugh  
  
But that joke isn't funny anymore  
It's too close to home  
And it's too near the bone  
It's too close to home  
And it's too near the bone  
More than you'll ever know ...  
  
Kick them when they fall down  
Kick them when they fall down  
You kick them when they fall down  
Kick them when they fall down  
You kick them when they fall down  
Kick them when they fall down  
You kick them when they fall down  
Kick them when they fall down  
  
It was dark as I drove the point home  
And on cold leather seats  
Well, it suddenly struck me  
I just might die with a smile on my  
Face after all  
  
I've seen this happen in other people's  
Lives  
And now it's happening in mine  
  
I've seen this happen in other people's  
Lives  
And now it's happening in mine  
  
I've seen this happen in other people's  
Lives  
And now it's happening in mine  
  
I've seen this happen in other people's  
Lives  
And now it's happening in mine  
Oh ...  
  
I've seen this happen in other people's  
Lives  
Oh ...  
And now it's happening in mine  
Happening in mine  
Happening in mine  
Happening in mine  
Happening in mine  
  
I've seen this happen in other people's  
Lives  
Oh...  
And now, now, now it's happening in mine  
(I've seen this happen)  
Happening in mine  
Oh...now, now  
  
I've seen this happen in other people's  
Lives  
Oh...  
And now it's happening in mine  
(Happen)  
Happening in mine  
Oh...  
Happening in mine  
Happening in mine  
Happening in mine  
  
I've seen this happen in other people's  
Lives  
Oh...  
And now, now, now it's happening in mine  
Happening in mine  
Mine, mine  
Happening in mine
