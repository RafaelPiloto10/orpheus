We're just half a dream away  
Sitting on our fences  
Building up defenses  
Making up rules by which we play  
  
We're just half way down the road  
Staking our positions  
But stupid superstitions  
Only give fools too heavy a load  
  
The magpie screeched and my window is shattered  
Her body's bruised but her soul's not battered  
The fireman tried but the hose was frozen  
The cupboard's bare but the door needs closing  
  
We spend half our time away  
From being where we want to  
And seeing who it's fun to  
Not blaming ourselves for our mistakes  
  
We spend half a dream away  
Just looking out of windows  
Waiting for a signal  
Waiting for night to return to day  
  
The tree was bare but the birds were singing  
The milk turned sour but my thirst needs quenching  
The meat was dead and I need me feeding  
The room was cold but the night was freezing  
  
The rainbow frowned when the sun was shining  
A baby's snatched on a beautiful morning  
A dog runs wild and the brakes are screaming  
A church on fire is struck by lightning  
The dead man's hands had beautiful fingers  
The princess frowned at her lovers mistress  
She went insane and poisoned the children  
A teacher's drowned and a child is laughing  
  
We're just half a dream away
