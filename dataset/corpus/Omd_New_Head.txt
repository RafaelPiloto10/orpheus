Be what you want to be.  
Count to three, abc.  
  
  
Who's gonna love you so,  
Won't let go til you blow?  
Who's gonna break your heart again,  
From the start, all apart?  
  
Silly little things tonight,  
Won't be right, out of sight.  
Every little thing we take,  
Won't be late, heaven's sake.  
Who's going to hold you tight,  
All the night, give no fright?  
  
Be what you want to be.  
Count to three, abc.  
  
Every little things a lesson,  
Number one, hold the sun.  
Living in a fields a blessing,  
With no gun, can't be done.
