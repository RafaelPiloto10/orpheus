Look on down from the bridge  
There's still fountains down there  
Look on down from the bridge  
It's still raining, up here  
  
Everybody seems so far away from me  
Everybody just wants to be free  
Look away from the sky  
It's no different when you're leaving home  
I can't be the same thing to you now  
I'm just gone, just gone  
How could I say goodbye  
How could I say goodbye  
Goodbye  
  
Maybe I'll just place my hands over you  
And close my eyes real tight  
There's a light in your eyes  
And you know--yeah, you know  
Look on down from the bridge  
I'm still waiting for you
