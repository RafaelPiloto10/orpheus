Hamburger Steak Holiday Inn that's the kinda world that I live in  
  
Play a different town most every night  
  
Lovin' your woman write a new song that's my life  
  
That's my life and I love it that's my life  
  
There ain't nothin' else in the world above it  
  
I see people all alone pickin' their guitars and singin' their songs  
  
But I tell 'em forget it cause you can't fake it  
  
If you're gonna make it you've gotta live it  
  
I got a big bus with a tv and a bar  
  
And a little room in the back for me and my ole guitar  
  
Gotta stop and fuel up every five hundred miles  
  
Give a picture to the waitress eat a little breakfast country style  
  
That's my life and I love it...  
  
We get home to Nashville on a Monday night  
  
Record songs on Tuesday and on Wednesday take out the wife  
  
But then on Thursday night it's back on the road  
  
I don't care if it's Montana or down in Louisiana just as long as I go  
  
That's my life and I love it...
