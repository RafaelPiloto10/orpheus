I have a private hell  
Of excellent quality  
I've dwelt there for years  
Playing with my fears  
  
It's tastefull, luxurious,  
And full of sexuality  
And though they are tears  
I control them with my gears  
  
Well all in all,  
I must tell you,  
Well I must tell you,  
I'm so proud of my private hell  
  
Anger and greed brew  
And then they stamped  
Till I can transmute  
Them into more loot  
  
It's tasteful, luxurious,  
And full of sexuality  
And though they are tears  
I control them with my gears  
  
Well all in all,  
I must tell you,  
Well I must tell you,  
I'm so proud of my private hell  
  
Well all in all,  
I must tell you,  
Well I must tell you,  
I'm so proud of my private hell
