If I am dreaming you've got your arms around me,  
Wake me when it's over.  
Wake me when it's over, not before.  
  
And if I'm dreaming that love at last has found me,  
Let me go on dreaming.  
Wake me when it's over and then let me go to sleep, again.  
  
It's hard to believe, my dear, that you're here at all.  
Incredible, I pinch myself, you don't disappear at all.  
So if I'm hearing you tell some small-town justice, you will not forsake me.  
Takin' vows to make me yours, ever more.  
Then darling, wake me when it's over, and not before.  
  
Oh, wake me when it's over.  
Wake me when it's over, and then back to sleep again.  
  
It's hard to believe, my dear, that you're here at all.  
Incredible, you don't disappear at all.  
So, tell that small-town justice you'll take me.  
Tell I'm you'll make me yours ever more.  
Then darling, wake me when it's over, not before!
