My mother's love was always inexplicably linked to kickball,  
And my brother was an expert from the start!  
But I lacked finesse, so when put to the test,  
I couldn't kick my way right into her heart!  
  
Oh yeah!  
He tried playing rugby and soccer and football,  
He tried kick the can and even martial arts,  
But even with fist dedication, "I've still got no coordination!"  
He couldn't kick his way right into her heart.  
Oh yeah...
