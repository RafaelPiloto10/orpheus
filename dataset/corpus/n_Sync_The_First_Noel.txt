Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Born is the King of Israel  
The first Noel, the angel did say  
Was to certain poor shepherds  
In fields as they lay  
In fields where they  
Lay keeping their sheep  
On a cold winter's night  
That was so deep  
  
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel  
Born is the King of Israel  
  
They looked up  
And saw a star  
Shining in the the East  
Beyond them far  
And to the earth it  
It gave great light  
And so it continued  
Both day and night  
  
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,  
Born is the King of Israel.  
  
And by the light of that same star,  
Three wise men came  
From country far,  
To seek for a King  
Was their intent,  
And to follow the star wherever it went.  
  
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,  
Born is the King of Israel.  
Born is the King of Israel.
