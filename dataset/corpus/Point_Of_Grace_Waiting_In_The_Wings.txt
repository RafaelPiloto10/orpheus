Hearts of hope seem hard to find these days  
As darker deeds have their time on center stage  
We watch it all unfolding scene by scene  
And a happy ending seems a fading dream  
Fear and desperation have their day  
At least until faith steps up to say  
I believe, though God is out of sight  
He's working in the middle of all things  
Evil may have Its time in the spotlight  
But love is waiting in the wings  
Love is always waiting in the wings  
It?s your life, as it plays out don't forget it  
Heartache comes but the stories not done yet  
Oh, when shadows come, your courage wants to fade  
Oh but in a moment, everything can change  
I believe, though God is out of sight  
He's working in the middle of all things  
Evil may have Its time in the spotlight  
Oh, but love is waiting in the wings  
Love is always waiting in the wings  
there's always more to any story  
Than just what's here and now  
There's not one hopeless situation  
That can't be turned around  
I believe, though God is out of sight  
He's working in the middle of all things, oh  
Evil may have Its time in the spotlight  
Oh, but love is waiting in the wings  
Love is always waiting in the wings  
Love is always waiting in the wings
