First off I can't keep a promise  
I'm no one to count on at all  
Add on that I'm a coward  
Too scared to return your call  
  
[Chorus]  
But you don't care  
You keep sticking around  
While I'm acting a clown  
You're bigger, than me  
La la la la la la  
'Cause you're still here  
Your feet stuck to the ground  
Despite how silly it sounds  
You're bigger  
Than me  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
  
It's known that I'm a liar  
Often I'm blacker than white  
Add on my uncandid ego  
No ones less humbled than I  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All the messed up things I do  
Yeah I swear I'll make 'em up to you  
Before you're going heaven knows  
Just let me make it better  
I'll try and measure up  
I'll try and measure up to you  
Oh yeah,  
  
I'll make 'em up to you  
Oh yeah!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just bigger than me  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la
