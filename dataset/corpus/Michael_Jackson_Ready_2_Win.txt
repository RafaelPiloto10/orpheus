Do we have what it takes  
To change the world into a better place  
Do we have what it takes  
To change the tears into a smile in all youth faces  
  
Are we ready  
2 win this war  
Are we ready  
2 win and left it all behind our shoulders  
  
Are we ready  
2 win and save the world  
Are we ready  
2 win and make the miracle happen  
(Once again)  
  
Are you ready  
Ready 2 win  
It's the money and the fame  
Against the heavy-weight championship  
The king (of pop) versus nobody but who you are  
Are you seriously  
Gonna meet me (at the ring)  
It's up to you how does this all end  
Are you ready  
Ready 2 win
