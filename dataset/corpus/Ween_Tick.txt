I feel a tick in my head and he's sucking on my head  
In the morning I'll be dead if he doesn't leave my head  
Why can't he go away, why does he have to stay  
Maybe he want to play but I can only say  
  
That I'll get you, I'll burn you, I'll crush you, I'll flush you  
(Down, down)  
The toilet where you'll spiral  
(Around-round)  
Aw, tick, mmm tick tick tick, brr tick  
  
I tried to get rid of my plague but I left some of his leg  
And he grew back pretty quick so I stabbed the little prick  
But now I cut my head, in the morning I'll be dead  
But even after still he'll find someone to kill  
  
That I'll get you, I'll burn you, I'll crush you, I'll flush you  
(Down, down)  
The toilet where you'll spiral  
(Around-round)  
Aw, tick, mmm tick tick tick, brr tick  
Aw, tick, mmm tick tick tick, brr tick  
Aw, tick, mmm tick tick tick, brr tick
