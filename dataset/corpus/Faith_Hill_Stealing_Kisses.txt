'It's late enough  
All your kids should be home.'  
The policeman says  
As he takes your beer for his own  
  
You remember  
Wondering what his wife thought  
About his occupation  
He knows that you were just chasing a dream  
  
To the town line and back and over again  
So he winks at your girls  
And tells you all, 'I'll see you later.'  
  
I was stealing kisses from a boy  
Now I'm begging affection from a man  
In my house dress  
Don't you know who I am?  
Don't you know who I am?  
Standing in your kitchen  
  
It's late enough  
Your husband's dinner is cold  
So you wrap it up and leave it for him on the stove  
It's probably the traffic again  
  
Another important meeting  
You haven't talked to an adult all day  
Except for your neighbor who drives you crazy  
When he finally gets in  
He's sure not in the mood for talkin'  
  
I was stealing kisses from a boy  
Now I'm begging affection from a man  
In my house dress  
Don't you know who I am?  
Don't you know who I am?  
I'm standing in your kitchen  
  
And hours become days  
Days become years  
And you could burn down this town  
If they made matches from fear  
'Cause you're no worse off than anybody else  
Hey, don't you even know?  
Don't you even know yourself?  
  
So you're standing outside your high school doors  
The ones you walked through twenty years before  
And you whisper to all the girls  
'Run, run, oh, run.'  
  
I was stealing kisses from a boy  
Now I'm begging affection from a man  
In my house dress  
Don't you know who I am?  
Don't you know who I am?  
Take a look at who I am  
Take a look at who I am  
I'm stealing kisses  
Stealing kisses
