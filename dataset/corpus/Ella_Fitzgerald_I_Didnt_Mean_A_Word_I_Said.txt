I didn't mean a word I said  
And if I hurt you I'm sorry  
I didn't mean to lose my head  
And if made you cry I'm sorry  
It was just another foolish quarrel  
Won't you end it with a kiss and  
Just remember this  
Except the time I said I love you  
I didn't mean a word I said  
I didn't mean a word I said  
  
I didn't mean a word I said  
And if I hurt you I'm so so sorry so so so sorry  
I didn't mean to lose my head  
And if made you cry I'm sorry  
It was just another foolish quarrel  
Won't you end it with a kiss and  
Just remember this  
Except the time I said I love you  
I didn't mean a word I said  
I didn't mean a word I said
