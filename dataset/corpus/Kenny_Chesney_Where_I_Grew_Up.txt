There's still marks on the pantry door of that little house  
Where Mama used to measure us  
I'm proud to say that's my home where I was raised  
But that ain't where I grew up  
  
See, I gained a little on Father Time  
The summer my Granddaddy died  
The first time I saw Mama cry  
Man, that sure was tough  
  
Felt like I put on a few years  
Watching Daddy wipe her tears  
In my little coat and tie standing in that cemetery mud  
That's where I grew up  
  
My senior year, a case of beer out on the river bank  
Getting a head start on twenty one  
That's the place that made me feel just like a man  
But that ain't where I grew up, no  
  
See I gained a little on Father Time  
That night I crossed that center line  
I bet I rolled a dozen times  
  
Next thing I knew I was waking up upside down  
Praying "God, just get me out"  
Then I hit my knees beside what was left of my truck  
Hey, that's where I grew up  
  
You learn as you go, that's how you grow  
  
See, I gained a little on Father Time  
When me and her, had our first big fight  
I said some things, I made her cry  
She packed all her stuff  
  
The boy in me said let her go  
But the man in me said pull her close  
It was time to find out which one I was  
Standing in a doorway holding on to love  
  
That's where I grew up  
Oh, that's where I grew up
