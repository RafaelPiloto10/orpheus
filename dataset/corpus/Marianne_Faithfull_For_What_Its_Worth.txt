There's something happening here,  
What it is ain't exactly clear.  
There's a man with a gun over there  
Telling me I got to beware.  
Everybody look what's going down.  
Battle lines being drawn,  
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong.  
Some people speaking their minds  
Getting so much resistance from behind.  
It's time we stop,  
Children, what's that sound,  
Everybody look what's going down.  
What a field day for the heat,  
There's a thousand people in the street  
Singing songs and carrying signs  
Mostly saying, "Hooray for our kind!"  
It's time we stop,  
Children, what's that sound,  
Everybody look what's going down.  
Stop,  
Children, what's that sound,  
Everybody look what's going down.  
Paranoia strikes deep,  
Into your life it will creep.  
It starts when you're always afraid,  
Get out of line, the men come and take you away.  
It's time we stop,  
Children, what's that sound,  
Everybody look what's going  
We got to stop,  
Children, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going  
We got to stop,  
Children, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going  
We got to stop,  
Children, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going down.
