Up on the airplane  
Nearer my god to thee  
I start making a deal  
Inspired by gravity  
If I did wrong I won't do it again  
'Cause I can be sweet and good and nice  
And if I had enemies their friends  
I'll hold to my life with the grip of a vice  
  
And I'm up on the airplane  
Nearer my god to thee  
I start making a deal  
Inspired by gravity  
  
That little spot on the ground is my hometown  
I like to call it my home and it's sweet  
I'd rather take a seat down there  
Than a throne up here up above 30,000 feet  
And I'm up on the airplane  
  
I never should have read my horoscope  
Or the fortune on the bubble strip  
Saying what you think won't happen will  
A great thing to read before a trip  
On an airplane  
  
Pilot says the big blue sky's like a swimming pool  
Big fluffy clouds like a feather bed  
I'd rather have a real pillow underneath my head  
Lying in my bed which is in my hometown  
Which is on the ground  
Far from an airplane  
(My bed my hometown)  
Far from an airplane  
(On the ground my bed my hometown)  
Far from an airplane  
(On the ground my bed my hometown)  
On the airplane  
(On the ground)  
(I'll be making a deal)  
On the airplane  
(On the ground)  
(I'll be making a deal)  
On the airplane  
(I'll be making a deal)  
(I'll be making a deal)  
(I'll be making a deal)
