Kinda like a cloud I was up way up in the sky.  
And I was feeling some feelings you wouldn't believe.  
Sometimes I don't believe them myself and I decided I was never coming down.  
Just then a tiny little dot caught my eye.  
It was just about too small to see.  
But I watched it way too long.  
That dot was pulling me down.  
  
[Chorus:]  
I was up above it.  
I was up above it.  
I was up above it.  
I was up above it.  
Now I'm down in it  
Shut up.  
  
So what what does it matter now.  
I was swimming in the hate now I crawl on the ground.  
And everything I never liked about you is kind of seeping into me.  
I try to laugh about it now but isn't it funny how everything works out.  
I guess the jokes on me.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I used to be so big and strong.  
I used to know my right from wrong.  
I used to never be afraid.  
I used to be somebody.  
I used to have something inside.  
Now just this hole it's open wide.  
Used to want it all.  
I used to be somebody.  
I'll cross my heart and hope to die.  
But the needle's already in my eye.  
And all the world's weight is on my back and I don't even know why.  
And what I used to think was me is just a fading memory.  
I looked him right in the eye and said "goodbye."  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Rain rain go away.  
Come again some other day.  
Chorus  
Na na na na na na na na.
