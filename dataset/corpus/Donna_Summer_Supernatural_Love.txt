We were strangers  
Who one were lovers  
We've been everlasting friends  
  
I was shattered  
When you walked out, boy  
I was walking off the edge  
  
Friends, said i looked so down-hearted  
When you left  
Now my broken heart is stable  
I'm starting to mend  
Got you back and I'm living again  
  
Oh, this must be love  
That sets my soul on fire  
A supernatural love  
(this must be)  
That makes my flame burn higher  
A supernatural love  
  
Life was only tear drops falling down  
From my eyes  
Now my broken heart is stable  
Oh, I'm coming alive  
I can't fight what I'm feeling inside  
  
This must be love  
That sets my soul on fire  
A supernatural love  
(oh, this must be)  
That makes my flame burn higher  
A supernatural love  
That gets me so excited  
A supernatural love  
(oh, this must be)  
That makes us true survivors  
A supernatural love
