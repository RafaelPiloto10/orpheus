You're first I'm last  
You're thirst I'm asked to justify  
Killing our last heaven beast  
Don't hunt the whale  
  
In beauty vision  
Do we offer much  
If we reason with destiny, gonna lose our touch  
Don't kill the whale  
  
Rejoice they sing  
They worship their own space  
In a moment of love, they will die for their grace  
Don't kill the whale  
  
If time will allow  
We will judge all who came  
In the wake of our new age to stand for the frail  
Don't kill the whale  
  
CETACEI....
