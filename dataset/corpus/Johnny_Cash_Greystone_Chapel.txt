Thank you very much  
This next song was written by a man right here in Folsom prison  
And last night was the first time I've ever sung this song  
Anyways, this song was written by our friend Glen Shirley  
Um, hope we do your song justice Glen, we're going to do our best  
  
Inside the walls of prison my body may be  
But my Lord has set my soul free  
There's a greystone chapel here at Folsom  
A house of worship in this den of sin  
You wouldn't think that God had a place here at Folsom  
But he saved the souls of many lost men  
Now there's greystone chapel here at Folsom  
Stands a hundred years old made of granite rock  
It takes a ring of keys to move here at Folsom  
But the door to the House of God is never locked  
  
Inside the walls of prison my body may be  
But my Lord has set my soul free  
  
There are men here that don't ever worship  
There are men here who scoff at the ones who pray  
But I've got down on my knees in that greystone chapel  
And I thank the Lord for helpin' me each day  
Now there's greystone chapel here at Folsom  
It has a touch of God's hand on ever stone  
It's a flower of light in a field of darkness  
And it's givin' me the strength to carry on  
Inside the walls of prison my body may be  
But my Lord has set my soul free  
  
Have an announcement from Lt. Piper  
Ah, steady  
Uh, Duffy, number nine oh four seven, custody office  
There's a gentleman here I'd like to have stand up, who's a very very proud
man  
He used to be many years ago, a bad land farmer down in Dias, Arkansas  
But he's Johnny Cash's daddy, Mr. Ray Cash  
I'd like to bring up a gentleman who's got something to say to Johnny Cash  
This gentleman you all know, the associate warden Mr. Fausman  
Good to see you sir. You want Mr. John Cash, don't ya  
Sorta like to, yes. Johnny  
Johnny a little memento from Folsom prison.  
Like a cuddle up  
We'll make him one of the in group when he's out  
Thank you Mr. Fousman  
One other announcement. Please hold your seats until released by the officer  
And then go out through the side door
