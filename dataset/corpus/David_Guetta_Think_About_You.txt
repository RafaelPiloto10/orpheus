I close my eyes, and there you are  
I open my eyes, and there you are again  
I try to eat, the food don't taste the same  
It ain't my fault, but still I take the blame  
You, you, you  
In my mind I already know  
You, you, you  
But my heart don't wanna let it go  
  
I don't wanna think about you  
But I can't stop if I wanted to  
I don't wanna think about you  
But I can't stop if I wanted to  
I don't wanna think about you  
But I can't stop if I wanted to  
I don't wanna think about you  
But I can't stop if I wanted to  
I don't wanna think about you  
But I can't stop if I wanted to  
All I do is think about you  
But I can't stop if I wanted to  
All I do is think about you  
But I can't stop  
  
I close my eyes, and there you are  
I open my eyes, and there you are again  
I try to sleep, but dreams just ain't the same  
It ain't my fault, but still I take the blame  
You, you, you  
In my mind I gotta face it  
You, you, you  
But my heart is badly aching  
  
I don't wanna think about you  
But I can't stop if I wanted to  
I don't wanna think about you  
But I can't stop if I wanted to  
I don't wanna think about you  
But I can't stop if I wanted to  
I don't wanna think about you  
But I can't stop if I wanted to  
I don't wanna think about you  
But I can't stop if I wanted to  
All I do is think about you  
But I can't stop if I wanted to  
All I do is think about you  
But I can't stop
