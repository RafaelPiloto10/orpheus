It's beginning to look  
A lot like Christmas  
Everywhere you go  
Take a look in the five  
And ten glistening  
Once again  
With candy canes  
And silver lanes aglow  
  
It's beginning to look  
A lot like Christmas  
Toys in every store  
But the prettiest sight  
To see  
Is the holly that will be  
On your own front door  
  
A pair  
Of hop along boots  
And a pistol  
That shoots  
Is the wish  
Of Barney and Ben  
  
Dolls that will talk  
And will go for a walk  
Is the hope  
Of Janice and Jen  
And Mom and Dad  
Can hardly  
Wait for school  
To start again  
  
It's beginning to look  
A lot like Christmas  
Everywhere you go  
There's a tree  
In the Grand Hotel  
One in the park as well  
The sturdy kind  
That doesn't mind the snow  
  
It's beginning to look  
A lot like Christmas  
Soon the bells will start  
And the thing  
That will make them ring  
Is the carol that you sing  
Right within your heart
