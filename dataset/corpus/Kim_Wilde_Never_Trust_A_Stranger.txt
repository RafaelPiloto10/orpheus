I knew there was a danger  
But couldn't resist  
The touch of a stranger  
The thrill of his kiss  
'cause this time  
I thought it was love  
I thought it was heaven  
Having the time of my life  
I know it's not true  
  
Oh never trust a stranger with your heart  
Oh no, never trust a stranger with your heart  
  
My world is in pieces  
You've stolen my pride  
And I'm left defeated  
And crushed by your lies  
  
Like a tiger you hunted and tracked me down  
Savaged my soul and took over control  
And then when you'd used all the love you found  
You left without trace  
Not a note or a single goodbye  
I thought it was love  
I thought it was heaven  
Having the time of my life  
I know it's not true  
  
Oh never trust a stranger with your heart  
Oh no, never trust a stranger with your heart
