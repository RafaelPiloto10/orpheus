Creeping up the blind side, shimming up the wall  
Stealing through the dark of night  
Climbing through a window, stepping to the floor  
Checking to the left and the right  
Picking up the pieces, putting them away  
Something doesn't feel quite right  
  
Help me someone, let me out of here  
Then out of the dark was suddenly heard  
Welcome to the Home by the Sea  
  
Coming out the woodwork, through the open door  
Pushing from above and below  
Shadows without substance, in the shape of men  
Round and down and sideways they go  
Adrift without direction, eyes that hold despair  
Then as one they sign and they moan  
  
Help us someone, let us out of here  
Living here so long undisturbed  
Dreaming of the time we were free  
So many years ago  
Before the time when we first heard  
Welcome to the Home by the Sea  
  
Sit down, sit down  
As we relive our lives in what we tell you  
  
Images of sorrow, pictures of delight  
Things that go to make up a life  
Endless days of summer longer nights of gloom  
Waiting for the morning light  
Scenes of unimportance like photos in a frame  
Things that go to make up a life  
  
Help us someone, let us out of here  
Living here so long undisturbed  
Dreaming of the time we were free  
So many years ago  
Before the time when we first heard  
Welcome to the Home by the Sea  
  
Sit down, sit down  
As we relive our lives in what we tell you  
Let us relive our lives in what we tell you  
  
Sit down sit down  
Cause you won't get away  
So with us you will stay  
For the rest of your days. so sit down  
As we relive our lives in what we tell you  
Let us relive our lives in what we tell you
