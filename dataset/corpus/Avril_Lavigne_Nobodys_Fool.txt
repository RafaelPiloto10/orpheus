Fall back  
Take a look at me  
And you'll see I'm for real  
I feel what only I can feel  
  
And if that don't appeal to you  
Let me know  
And I'll go  
'Cause I flow  
  
Better when my colors show  
And that's the way it has to be  
Honestly  
'Cause creativity could never bloom  
  
In my room  
I'd throw it all away before I lie  
So don't call me with a compromise  
Hang up the phone  
I've got a backbone stronger than yours  
  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
  
[Chorus]  
If you're trying to turn me into someone else  
Its easy to see I'm not down with that  
I'm not nobody's fool  
If you're trying to turn me into something else  
I've seen enough and I'm over that  
I'm not nobody's fool  
If you want to bring me down  
Go ahead and try  
Go ahead and try  
  
You don't know  
You think you know me like yourself  
But I fear  
That you're only telling me what I want to hear  
  
But do you give a damn  
Understand  
That I can't not be what I am  
I'm not the milk and cheerios in your spoon  
  
It's not a simple hearing but not so soon  
I might have fallen for that when I was fourteen  
And a little more green  
But its amazing what a couple of years can mean  
  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Go ahead and try  
Try and look me in the eye  
But you'll never see inside  
Until you realize, realize  
Things are trying to settle down  
  
Just try to figure out  
Exactly what I'm about  
If its with or without you  
I don't need you doubting me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
  
Would you be laughing out loud  
If I played to my own crowd  
Try
