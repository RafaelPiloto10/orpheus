I was wasting time  
Oh so sure to find somebody  
Who'll never go  
How could I know  
None I'd found was true  
None could be but you  
The only one love divine  
My heart, my mind are yours  
  
[Chorus]  
Everywhere I go  
I see your face through the crowd  
Everywhere I go  
I hear your voice clear and loud  
Everywhere I go  
You are the light that I seek  
Everywhere I go  
You have found me  
  
Where could my heart go  
Where you wouldn't know to find me?  
Far, far from here  
Still you are near to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I have seen you in the evening  
In the morning light you hold me  
Closer than the air around me  
You surround me always  
  
Everywhere I go  
I see your face through the crowd  
I hear your voice clear and loud  
You are the light that I seek  
You have found me  
  
[Chorus: Repeat x3]
