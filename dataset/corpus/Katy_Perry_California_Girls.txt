[Intro]  
[Snoop Dogg]  
Greetings loved ones  
Lets take a journey  
  
[Verse 1]  
[Katy Perry]  
I know a place  
Where the grass is really greener  
Warm, wet and wild  
There must be something in the water  
  
Sippin' gin and juice  
Laying underneath the palm trees  
The boys break their necks  
Try'na to creep a little sneak peek  
(at us)  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
You could travel the world  
But nothing comes close to the golden coast  
Once you party with us  
You'll be falling in love  
  
Oooooh Oh Oooooh  
  
[Chorus]  
California girls  
We're unforgettable  
Daisy Dukes  
Bikinis on top  
  
Sun-kissed skin  
So hot  
We'll melt your popsicle  
  
Oooooh Oh Oooooh  
  
California girls  
We're undeniable  
Fine, fresh, fierce  
We got it on lock  
  
West coast  
Represent  
Now put your  
Hands up  
  
Oooooh Oh Oooooh  
  
[Verse 2]  
Sex on a beach  
We get sand in our stilletos  
We freak in my jeep  
So do the doggie on the stereo  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
You could travel the world  
But nothing comes close to the golden coast  
Once you party with us  
You'll be falling in love  
  
Oooooh Oh Oooooh  
  
[Chorus]  
California girls  
We're unforgettable  
Daisy Dukes  
Bikinis on top  
  
Sun-kissed skin  
So hot  
We'll melt  
Your popsicle  
  
Oooooh Oh Oooooh  
  
California girls  
We're undeniable  
Fine, fresh, fierce  
We got it on lock  
  
West coast  
Represent  
Now put your  
Hands up  
  
Oooooh Oh Oooooh

Wild wild west coast  
These are the girls I love the most

Kiss her
