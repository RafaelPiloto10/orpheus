[Lionel Richie]  
It'd be so nice  
If you didn't have to feel so lonely  
It'd be so nice  
If I could sneak you for a moment  
  
I know you like to get away, go away, far away  
To a place where there's just us two  
Got a busy day, everyday but not today  
Cause I'm Here to take that stress from you  
  
So you can just chill  
And clear your head  
And let me do everything for you cause you deserve it  
Prepare your meal  
And make your bed  
Well let just first make this with you cause you are so worth it  
  
[Akon]  
I just want us to go (go go)  
Drop everything and just go (go go)  
I just want us to go (go go)  
Drop everything and just go (go go)  
  
[Verse 2 : Lionel Richie]  
How would you like to sail away in the Bahamas?  
(Just you and me girl)  
So far out in the sea where nobody can find you  
(Just the end of the world)  
Cause there is no rush  
For you to come back and face the rain  
Cause there is plenty sunshine where I pickin' you  
And I'm here to reduce the pain  
  
I know you like to get away, go away, far away  
To a place where there's just us two  
Got a busy day, everyday but not today  
Cause I'm Here to take that stress from you  
So you can just chill  
And clear your head  
And let me do everything for you cause you deserve it  
Prepare your meal and make your bed  
Well let just first make this with you cause you are so worth it  
  
[Akon]  
I just want us to go (go go)  
Drop everything and just go (go go)  
I just want us to go (go go)  
Drop everything and just go (go go)  
  
[Lionel Richie]  
Just imagine when you tired and  
Layin' by my side and  
Sippin' on some wine while I stand in massage and  
Releasein' all your tension I couldn't handle a time and  
My job is to keep my baby smilin'  
  
So you can just chill  
And clear your head  
And let me do everything for you cause you deserve it  
Prepare your meal and make your bed  
Well let just first make this with you cause you are so worth it  
  
[Akon]  
I just want us to go (go go)  
Drop everything and just go (go go)  
I just want us to go (go go)  
Drop everything and just go (go go)  
I just want us to go (go go)  
Drop everything and just go (go go)  
I just want us to go (go go)  
Drop everything and just go (go go)
