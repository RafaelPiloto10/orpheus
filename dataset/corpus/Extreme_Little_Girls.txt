It's not fair what they put me through  
Please tell me what am I supposed to do  
Why do I get myself in this situation  
  
There must be some logical  
Answers why I rob the cradle  
Can this be love or just infatuation  
  
Little girl come out and play  
I got some candy for my baby  
It's your sweet sixteenth birthday celebration  
  
Thank heaven for little girls who  
Grow up in a most peculiar way  
  
You might think she's too young for me  
(Little girls)  
You know I always say you're as young as you feel  
(As you feel)  
Yeah, I might be crazy 'cause I like them so young  
(Little girls)  
But with little girls the best is yet to come come  
(Yet to come)  
  
Some they say I'm too old for her  
Old enough to be her father  
Incestual blood is thicker than water  
Do what's right not morally wrong  
Flesh and blood can only be so strong  
And it's my god not yours I'll have to answer
