It's good to have a window on the world  
And to live deep in the heart of the beast in the sun  
Night after night, I do the same damn thing  
Do the weirdness dance, for those who can't  
It's getting to the point where I can't take it anymore  
  
Waking up at 3 pm  
In a thrashed bedroom, sharp with needles and knives  
Reach for the crutches that keep in motion  
Vague memories that keep me alive  
Like when she used to call me baby  
All alone in our room, in the middle of the night  
Kill the sun, yes, kill the sun  
Kill the sun  
Come on, come on, stop the light  
  
Yes, I 've got sunshine  
It's a suicide song in the back of my mind  
Pure white evilwrapped around my eyes  
Yeah I've got all the cities of light to live in  
I don't even want no part  
Hard is the fall  
Cold is the bite  
Kill the sun, yeah come on stop the light...  
  
Kill the night
