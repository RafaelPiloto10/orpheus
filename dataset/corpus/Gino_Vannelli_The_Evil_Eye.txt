Who's that a-knockin' at my door tonight?  
Leave me alone 'til there's morning light  
You live and learn, you make mistakes  
You can't imagine why  
The fire burns for heaven's sake  
Look out for the evil eye  
Who was that damsel with that wicked stare?  
Get off my case and take your sins elsewhere  
You love and learn, you cross that bridge  
You want to pacify  
The tables turn and you've dug your ditch  
Look out for the evil eye  
Oh look out!  
Oh look out!  
I said look out!  
I said look out!  
You live and learn, you make mistakes  
You wonder how and why  
The fire burns for heaven's sake  
Look out for the evil eye  
Oh look out!  
Oh look out!  
I said look out!  
I said look out!
