I am all destiny, a trade, a grain of sand  
I take the throat of innocence and leave decay  
I stain the way for all to see  
  
No fear, no voice, no reason  
In god no guiding light  
  
When all the guilt that's in your head  
Turns its back and plays for dead  
You scorch the earth and torch the sky  
Conscience low with head held high  
  
Indulge and multiply and sacrifice  
As lack of breath chokes underground  
Divulge degenerate, the darker side  
From windows watch the screaming sky  
  
No fear, no voice, no reason  
In god no guiding light  
  
When all the guilt that's in your head  
Turns its back and plays for dead  
You scorch the earth and torch the sky  
Conscience low with head held  
  
When all the guilt that's in your head  
Turns its back and plays for dead  
You scorch the earth and torch the sky  
Conscience low with head held high  
  
From the truth comes all the shame  
The curse of flesh just takes it aim  
On hallowed ground and tortured sky  
Walk in fear with spirits high
