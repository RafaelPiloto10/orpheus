I'm tough, rough, ready and able  
To pick myself up from under this table  
Don't stick no sign on me, I got no label  
I'm a little sick, unsure, unsound and unstable  
  
But I'm fighting my way back  
  
I'm busting out and I'm going in  
I'm kicking up about the state I'm in  
Looking to my future, not my past  
I want to be a good boy but how long can it last  
  
Fighting my way back  
  
This kid is going to wreck and ruin  
I'm not quite sure of what I'm doing  
You see it happened all a little too soon  
But it's all there in this here tune  
  
Fighting my way back
