I hide, only to defy you  
Take away the only love inside you  
I see your face through everyone  
Inside I've just begun!  
You think I'm out to scare you  
I'm only up to prepare you for when you stop and turn around  
Your body's going down!  
  
You're gonna waste your time,  
Your life will soon be mine,  
You're definitely one of a kind, and  
You're suffering 'cause of me - it's divine  
  
Tell me why you never liked me  
Tell me why it's that you fight me  
Pulled out and wait for the perfect time to take what's rightfully mine  
You think they're dumb to defy me  
You said you don't want to defy me  
You wait to dumb run anyone  
Oh well  
  
Fuck you!  
I'm fed up with you!  
I'm not as good as you?  
Fuck no, I'm better than you!  
Did you really think you'd beat me at my own game?!  
You try to say what you got  
We're ripping at your brain!
