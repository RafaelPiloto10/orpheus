A year and a half, did not seem like much time.  
But it's almost forever, when you're only nine.  
Yes she still adores him, and tears fill her eyes.  
As she clings to her pillow, and cries.  
  
Daddy come home oh please, Daddy come home.  
Sweet Daddy, Are you out there somewhere all alone?  
Was Mommy mean to you, Did I treat you wrong?  
Daddy, Oh Daddy come home.  
  
Out on the coast, in a honeymoon sweet.  
Someones tossing and turning, and trying to sleep.  
Was that just the wind, in the pines 'cross the bay?  
Or a small voice, from so far away.  
  
Daddy come home, oh please, Daddy come home.  
Sweet Daddy, Are you out there somewhere all alone?  
Was Mommy mean to you, Did I treat you wrong?  
Daddy, Oh Daddy, come home.  
  
Daddy, Oh Daddy, come home!...
