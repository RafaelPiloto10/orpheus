Once I was young...  
Yesterday, perhaps...  
Danced with Jim and Paul  
And kissed some other chaps.  
  
Once I was young,  
But never was naive.  
I thought I had a trick or two  
Up my imaginary sleeve.  
  
And now I know I was naive.  
I didn't know what time it was  
Then I met you.  
Oh, what a lovely time it was,  
  
How sublime it was too!  
I didn't know what time it was  
You hold my hand.  
Warm like the month of May it was,  
  
And I'll say it was grand.  
Grand to be alive, to be young,  
To be mad, to be yours alone!  
Grand tosee your face, feel your touch,  
  
Hear your voice say I'm all your own.  
I didn't know what time it was  
Live was no prize.  
I wanted love and here it was  
  
Shining out of your eyes.  
I'm wise,  
And I know what time it is now.  
Once I was old --  
  
Twenty years or so --  
Rather well preserved:  
The wrinkles did't show.  
Once I was old,  
  
But not too old for fun.  
I used to hunt for little girls  
Up my immaginary gun.  
But now I ain for only one!  
  
I didn't know what time it was  
Then I met you.  
Oh, what a lovely time it was,  
How sublime it was too!  
  
I didn't know what time it was  
You hold my hand.  
Warm like the month of May it was,  
And I'll say it was grand.  
  
Grand to be alive, to be young,  
To be mad, to be yours alone!  
Grand tosee your face, feel your touch,  
Hear your voice say I'm all your own.  
  
I didn't know what time it was  
Live was no prize.  
I whanted love and here it was  
Shining out of your eyes.  
  
I'm wise,  
And I know what time it is now.
