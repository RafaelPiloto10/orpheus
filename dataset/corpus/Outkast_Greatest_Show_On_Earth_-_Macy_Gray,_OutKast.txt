How y'all feelin' tonight?  
I don't give a damn.  
  
Mama, I leavin' way from home,  
To join the circus.  
And, Papa, I'm going to that place  
Where the clowns get down.  
Sister, I know that there are lions,  
Tigers, and Bears.  
(I'll be safe fo' sure, call you when I get there!)  
  
(Chorus)  
Ain't nothin like the  
Greatest Show On Earth.  
What you want? What you need?  
Wanna drank, wanna cheat?  
I got it, I got it.  
  
Mama, I'm movin up to (??) and cotton candy  
And Papa,next week they'll let me sit  
On the trapeez.  
Uncle, you should see all these dancing girls, and every night I get to sleep
under the big top.  
  
(Chorus)
