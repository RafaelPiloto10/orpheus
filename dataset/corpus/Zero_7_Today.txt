Sirens sounding out, are we going to war  
A film of yesterday on a broken down door  
Send me something real to ignore or explore  
And I'll show you all the things that I saw  
  
Today  
The words don't mean enough for us to say  
For us to say  
Today  
To steal the moment that we gave away  
We gave away  
Gave it away  
  
Can't remember when, but it's happened before  
Saw it all played out through a crack in the door  
Send me something good for the way that I feel  
And I'll show you all the things that I've seen  
  
Today  
The words don't mean enough for us to say  
For us to say  
today  
To steal the moment that we gave away  
We gave away  
  
Today  
We are the light that travels into space  
Into space  
  
We are the light that travels into space  
We are the light that travels into space  
We are the light that travels into space  
We are the light that travels into space  
We are the light that travels into space
