I've got a bike, you can ride if you like  
It's got a basket, a bell that rings  
And things to make it look good  
I'd give it to you if I could  
But I borrowed it  
You're the kind of girl  
That fits in with my world  
I'll give you anything, everything  
If you want a thing  
I've got a cloak, it's a bit of a joke  
There's a tear up the front, it's red and black  
I've had it for months  
If you think it could look good  
Then I guess it should  
I know a mouse and he hasn't got a house  
I don't know why I call him Gerald  
He's getting rather old but he's a good mouse  
I've got a clan of gingerbread men  
Here a man, there a man, lots of gingerbread men  
Take a couple if you wish, they're on the dish  
I know a room of musical tunes  
Some wine, some gin, most of them are clock work  
Let's go into the other room and make them work
