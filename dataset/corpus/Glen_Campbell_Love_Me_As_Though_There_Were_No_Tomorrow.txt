Love me as though there were no tomorrow  
Take me out of this world tonight  
Take me make me forget my sorrow  
So when I wake tomorrow, I'll know our love was right  
  
Kiss me as though it were now or never  
Teach me all that our heart should know  
Just love me as though there were no tomorrow  
Oh my darling love me  
Don't ever let me go  
  
Please love me as though there were no tomorrow  
Oh my darling love me  
Don't ever let me go
