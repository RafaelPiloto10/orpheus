Where are the heroes  
In my time of need?  
Is my cry not loud enough  
Or have they gone all numb?  
They just tend to stand  
Out of the rain  
Thinking but not acting  
That they're not to blame  
Falling and crawling  
A fight to stand up  
Memory still haunts me  
In the dead of night  
Over and over, I felt so small  
But one day I'll be stronger  
And you better watch out  
I will overcome, your violence their silence  
Although it can't be undone  
I will overcome, knowing that I'm not the only one  
I will overcome, it's the only way to carry on  
Where are the saviors?  
Afraid of the toll  
Sorry, do my nine inch nails  
Slash your soul  
Such heroes  
Throwing stones  
Straight at the one  
Who is standing alone  
Twisting and turning  
It's always the same  
Truth is never honest  
When you're to blame  
Pushing and pulling  
Never give in, one day I wish  
You'll see you're not so beautiful within  
I will overcome, our violence your silence  
Although it can't be undone  
I will overcome, knowing that I'm not the only one  
I will overcome, it's the only way to carry on  
Run and run  
Run and run  
I will overcome, their violence your silence  
Although it can't be undone  
I will overcome, knowing that I'm not the only one  
I will overcome, it's the only way to carry on  
I will overcome
