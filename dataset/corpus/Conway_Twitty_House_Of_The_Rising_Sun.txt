There is a house in New Orleans they call the Rising Sun  
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy and Lord I know I'm one  
  
My mother was a tailor boys she sowed my old blue jeans  
My daddy was a gambling man way down in New Orleans  
  
I got one foot on the platform boys the other on that train  
I'm going down to New Orleans to pull that ball and chain  
There is a house  
In the house of the Rising Sun
