  
Wasting doubt dwelled in me  
Life slipped by wasted teens  
Feeling small as I look around  
Why can't I cleanse myself?  
  
Fall in, face it, feel it, pray  
Weighted what you wanted me to be  
  
Every god lives in me  
One who wallows in vain  
Are you real?  
Do you feel?  
Pain  
  
Twirling leech, spinning down below  
Wishing for the song to write  
Leer at me, I can't see  
Am I wrong to be?  
  
(Go)  
Fall in, face it, feel it, pray  
Weighted what you wanted me to be  
  
Every god lives in me  
One who wallows in vain  
Are you real?  
Do you feel?  
Pain  
  
Every god lives in me  
One who wallows in vain  
Are you real?  
Do you feel?  
Pain
