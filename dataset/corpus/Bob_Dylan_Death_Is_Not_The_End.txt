When you're sad and lonely  
And you haven't got a friend  
Just remember that death is not the end  
And all that you hell sacred  
Falls down and dows not bend  
Just remember that death is not the end.  
  
Not the end, not the end  
Just remember that death is not the end.  
  
When you're standing at the cross-roads  
That you cannot comprehend  
Just remember that death is not the end  
And all your dreams have vanished  
And you don't know what's up the bend  
Just remember that death is not the end.  
  
Not the end, not the end  
Just remember that death is not the end.  
  
When storm clouds gather round you  
And heavy rains descend  
Just remember that death is not the end  
And there's nowhere there to comfort you  
With a helping hand to lend  
Just remember that death is not the end.  
  
Not the end, not the end  
Just remember that death is not the end.  
  
Oh the tree of life is growing  
Where the spirit never dies  
And the bright light of salvation  
Shines in dark and empty skies  
  
When the cities are on fire  
When the burning flesh of men  
Just remember that death is nt the end  
And you search in vain to find  
  
Just one law abiding citizen  
Just remember that death is not the end.  
  
Not the end, not the end  
Just remember that death is not the end.
