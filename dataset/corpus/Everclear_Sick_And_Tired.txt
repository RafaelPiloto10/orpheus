I break every day stressed out in every kind of way  
I am sick and tired of being sick and tired  
  
All I need and crave is a loud life with the power to fade  
I am living because I keep it all keep it all inside  
Yeah I keep it all keep it all inside  
Yeah I keep it all keep it all inside  
  
Love won't work for me I want women who are out of my reach  
I'm sick and tired of living all alone  
  
All I need for sure is a big love with the power to make more  
I am living because I keep it all, keep it all inside  
Yeah, I keep it all, keep it all inside  
Yeah, I keep it all, keep it all inside  
  
I know I'm close to the fall  
I know I'm dangerous  
I'm afraid I'm going down  
I blame my family, their damage is living in me  
I am sick inside and tired of my life  
  
All I need I swear is to go out with the power of a nightmare  
I am living because I keep it all, keep it all inside  
I keep it all, keep it all inside  
Yeah, I keep it all, keep it all inside  
  
I know I'm close to the fall  
I know I'm dangerous  
I know I'm not going down alone  
I keep it all, keep it all inside  
I know I'm close to the fall  
I know I'm dangerous  
I know I'm not going down alone  
I'm not going down alone
