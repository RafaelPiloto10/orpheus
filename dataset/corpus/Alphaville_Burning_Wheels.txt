I love to see your moves,  
It's so devine you dance  
I love to see your moves,  
It's so devine you dance  
When you're struttin' your legs  
Ain't no gravity on this planet  
When you're struttin' your legs  
Ain't no gravity anymore  
And I walk-walk-walk like an astronaut  
With your Monroe-smile on the screen of my eyes  
And every giant step I take  
Melts the snow on the roof of the world  
And the stars like burning wheels roll by  
Burning wheels roll by  
I'm the blossom's scent  
Since you stick in my soul like a flower  
I'm a blossom's scent  
Since you're comin' on down like a shower  
And my heart is a golden bell  
I can't keep it from tolling  
Yes, my heart is a golden bell  
And I can't control it anymore
