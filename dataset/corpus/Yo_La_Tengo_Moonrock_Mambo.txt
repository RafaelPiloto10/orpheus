Like a thumb in a rubber glove  
Or a moonrock in the sky above  
I'm thinking, could it be  
I'm falling in love  
Like a Chunky or a Charleston Chew  
Like shoe crab soup or chicken stew  
Like Cinderella's other shoe  
I just want to be next to you  
I wanna be, I wanna to be next to you  
I wanna be, I wanna be next to you  
Like a palindrome, or a friend indeed  
Like wow, or Tara Key  
It seems I always need remindin'  
What a fool believes  
Like Horton hearing a Who  
Like everything old becoming new  
Like looking out for number two  
I just want to be next to you  
I wanna be, I wanna to be next to you  
Yeah, I wanna be, I wanna be next to you  
Like Dr. Tom, like Mr. Met  
Like Professor Frink, like a Chia pet  
Like Eddie Bow, like Bob Levito??  
Like Jill Talley, like Don Cheadle  
I want to be next to you (x4)  
Like eatin' ribs with Calvin Trillin  
Like Timothy Carey in The Killing  
Like Steve Coogan and Rebecca Front  
Like Jefferson Airplane except no Grunt
