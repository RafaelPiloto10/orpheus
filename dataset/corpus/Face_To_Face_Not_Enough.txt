Talk talk talk don't talk to me  
You've got something I just don't need  
Wait wait wait don't wait for me  
I've been waiting for you to leave  
Want to try and try  
Try and make it right  
How long it takes you just don't know  
And another day  
And there's nothing changed  
How long it takes you just don't know  
  
Talk talk talk don't talk to me  
You've got something I just don't need  
Wait wait wait don't wait for me  
I've been waiting for you to leave  
  
Because we are what we are  
And sometimes it's not enough  
  
Try and try, try to make it right  
But I just don't know  
Another day and there's nothing changed  
And I just don't know  
  
Because we are what we are  
And sometimes it's not enough
