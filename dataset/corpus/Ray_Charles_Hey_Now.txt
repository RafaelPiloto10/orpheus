Well, did you ever wake up in the morning?  
Just about the break of day  
Reach over and rub the pillow  
Where your baby used to lay  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey Now!  
Hey now, Hey now, Hey now, Hey now  
Well, you know they make you feel so bad  
That you lay right down and die  
  
Then you put on your crying  
Like you've never cried before  
You even cry so loud  
You give the blues to your neighbor next door  
  
And you say, Hey Now!  
Hey now, Hey now, Hey now, Hey now  
Well, you know they make you feel so bad  
That you lay right down and die  
  
Well, I got the blues so bad now  
I'm tellin' ya it just hurt my feet to walk now  
I got the blues so bad now people  
It justa hurt my tongue to talk now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Then you cry Lord, Lord  
Won't you hear my plea?  
I know you can have mercy on everybody  
So won't you please send a little bit down to me?
