A little low on cash  
But I'm high on luck  
I wanna be your knight  
In shining pick-up truck  
With a Chevy for my summer home  
Let's get the party started  
It's looking like the city towed  
My other apartment  
  
She got a doorbell sign that said  
Bring it or don't ring it  
She's the woman  
She's the woman  
She's the woman  
She's the woman  
  
Fate is my pimp  
But she was cool  
Said if you're doin' business with me, honey  
What does that make you?  
Some Casablanca gin joint  
You're a nervous wreck  
Your I.Q. plummets fourteen points  
Her thunder thong around your neck  
  
The song ain't dirty  
It's really just the way we sing it (sing it)  
She's the woman (sing it)  
She's the woman  
She's the woman  
She's the woman  
  
She wanted something to regret  
Tomorrow morning  
This suburban garage-a-trois  
Was worth exploring  
Yeah dreams come true  
But it remains to be seen  
By the time mine usually do  
It's no longer me!  
  
She got a doorbell sign  
You better bring it, or don't ring it  
She's the woman  
She's the woman  
She's the woman
