Meanwhile Rome burns  
Meanwhile Rome burns  
It's a cultural shift, it's the North Atlantic drift  
Americana and a rule Britannia  
And the moon, yes, we own that too  
And where the Euphrates meets the other river  
Is now the home of the devil and the liar  
And the pyre we plan to make is just the drift leaving its wake, ah  
Meanwhile Rome burns  
Meanwhile Rome burns  
And the films you want to watch and the films you want to make  
And the kids, like lost angels dressed in black sensations  
And the shift won't shake and the drift won't brake  
With billions of diamonds growing like olives and the drift holds the coffers  
Meanwhile Rome burns  
Meanwhile Rome burns  
Meanwhile Rome burns  
Meanwhile Rome burns  
Meanwhile Rome burns  
Meanwhile Rome burns  
Meanwhile Rome burns  
Meanwhile Rome burns
