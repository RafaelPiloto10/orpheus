Gotta black breast Chinese eyes  
Got an English brain that's gonna make me wise  
Got a long story that I wanna tell  
To a rhythm that I know so well  
Really got a lot of lovin' that I wanna give  
Baby I'm a mystery but you know I gotta live  
I tried another but she didn't want to know  
  
Take a hold now if you can  
Take a lesson from a hard lovin' man  
I'm a long way from where I wanna go  
Guess I'll stay awhile I really love you so  
How's about another sip of all the wine you got  
Take a tip from me and give it here I'll drink the lot  
I'm not a winey, I'm a puttin' on a show  
  
You really really grab me but I've gotta move  
Before they know I'm here and spread the news  
Maybe in while when I've moved around  
I can find a way to pay you back your twenty pounds  
Really got a lot of lovin' that I wanna give  
Baby I'm a mystery but you know I gotta live  
I tried another but she didn't want to know
