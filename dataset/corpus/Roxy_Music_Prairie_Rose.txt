Texas That's where I  
Belong  
It seems to me  
Texas Lonesome star  
Shine on  
The big country  
Texas With open skies  
And you  
For company  
Texas Oh prairie rose  
How happy  
I should be  
  
Hey hey You can take it from me  
Hey hey I'll be coming, you'll see  
Hey hey Oh what a state to be in  
Hey hey You're tantalizing me  
Texas I will compose  
In fancy rhyme  
Or just plain prose  
Texas A song of praise  
  
To you  
Prairie rose  
Texas Though I'm not sure  
I can explain  
Your strange allure  
Texas Prairie rose  
A crown of thorns  
A scented flower  
  
Hey hey I'd better leave right away  
Hey hey I can hear you calling me  
Prairie rose
