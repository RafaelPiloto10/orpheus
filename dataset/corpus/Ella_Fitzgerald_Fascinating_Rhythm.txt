Got a little rhythm, a rhythm, a rhythm  
That pit-a-pats through my brain  
So darn persistent  
The day isn't distant  
When it'll drive me insane  
Comes in the morning  
Without any warning  
And hangs around me all day  
I'll have to sneak up to it  
Someday, and speak up to it  
I hope it listens when I say:  
  
Fascinating rhythm  
You've got me on the go!  
Fascinating rhythm  
I'm all a-quiver  
  
When a mess you're making!  
The neighbors want to know  
Why I'm always shaking  
Just like a flivver  
  
Each morning I get up with the sun  
Start a-hopping  
Never stopping  
To find at night no work has been done  
  
I know that  
Once it didn't matter  
But now you're doing wrong  
When you start to patter  
I'm so unhappy  
  
Won't you take a day off?  
Decide to run along  
Somewhere far away off  
And make it snappy!  
  
Oh, how I long to be the man I used to be!  
Fascinating rhythm  
On won't you stop picking on me?
