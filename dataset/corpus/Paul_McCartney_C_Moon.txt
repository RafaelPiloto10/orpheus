C moon, C moon, C moon is she.  
C moon, C moon, C moon to me.  
  
How come no one older than me  
Ever seems to understand the things I want to to do?  
It will be L7 and I'd never get to heaven  
If I filled my head with glue  
What's it all to you?  
  
C moon, C moon, C moon is she.  
C moon, C moon, C moon to me.  
  
Bobby lived with Patty  
But they never told her daddy  
What their love was all about  
She could tell her lover that he thought but  
She never was the type to let it out  
What's it all about?  
  
C moon, C moon, C moon are we.  
C moon, C moon, C moon are we.
