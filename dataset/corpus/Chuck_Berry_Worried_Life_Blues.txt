Oh lordy Lord, oh lordy Lord  
It hurts me so bad for us to part  
But someday, baby, I ain't gonna worry my life anymore  
  
So many nights since you've been gone  
I've had to worry my life along  
But someday, baby, I ain't gonna worry my life anymore  
  
How many times, how many times since you went away  
Have I set and cried and cried both night and day  
Someday, baby, I ain't gonna worry my life anymore  
  
You're on my mind, baby, every place I go  
How much I love you, nobody knows  
But someday, baby, I ain't gonna worry my life anymore  
  
So that's my story, baby, this is all I got to say to you  
Bye-bye, baby, I don't care what you do  
Someday, baby, I ain't gonna worry my life anymore
