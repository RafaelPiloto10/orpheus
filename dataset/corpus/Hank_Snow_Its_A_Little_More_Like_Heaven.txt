I have sailed across the waters salty ocean deep and blue  
Felt the rapture of the dawning thrilled through sunset golden view  
I have sought above the mountain peeks or valleys great and wide  
But it's a little more like heaven by your side  
  
It's a little more like heaven where you are  
I have sought for happiness both near and far  
But my search for love was through the day that I met you  
'Cause it's a little more like heaven where you are  
  
I have watched the crystal raindrops fall to earth to cool the day  
Watched the rainbow at twilight when the clouds have blown away  
I've adored the clinging roses round my mountain home so dear  
But it's a little more like heaven where you're near  
It's a little more like heaven...  
  
I have tempted for a moment by a lure and magic charms  
Of fickle flame and beauty while waltzin' in her arms  
I cherished mem'ries of the past of friends so kind and true  
But it's a little more like heaven dear with you  
It's a little more like heaven...  
('Cause it's a little more like heaven where you are)
