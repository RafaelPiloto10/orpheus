Chattanooga Choo-Choo  
  
Hey there, pal, whatcha say?  
Step aside partner, it's my day  
Bend an ear and listen to my version  
(Of a really solid, Tennessee excursion)  
Pardon me boys, is that the Chattanooga Choo Choo?  
(Yes Yes) Track 29!  
Boy you can give me a shine  
(Can you afford to board, the Chattanooga Choo Choo?)  
I've got my fare  
And just a trifle to spare  
You leave the Pennsylvania station 'bout a quarter to four  
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore  
Dinner in the diner, nothing could be finer  
(then to have your ham and eggs in Carolina)  
When you hear the whistle blowing eight to the bar  
Then you know that Tennessee is not very far  
Shuffle all the coal in  
Gotta keep it rollin'  
(Whoo Whoo Chattanooga there you are)  
There's gonna be, a certain party at the station  
Satin and Lace  
I used to call funny face  
She's gonna cry  
Until I tell her that I'll never roam  
(So Chattanooga Choo Choo)  
Won't you choo choo me home.  
Get aboard...  
All aboard...  
Chattanooga choo choo  
Wont you choo choo me home
