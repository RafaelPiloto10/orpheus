Southern trees bearin' strange fruit,  
Blood on the leaves and blood at the root,  
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze,  
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.  
  
Pastoral scene of the gallant south,  
Them big bulging eyes and the twisted mouth,  
Scent of magnolias, clean and fresh,  
Then the sudden smell of burning flesh.  
  
Here is fruit for the crows to pluck,  
For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck,  
For the sun to rot, for the leaves to drop,  
Here is a strange and bitter crop.
