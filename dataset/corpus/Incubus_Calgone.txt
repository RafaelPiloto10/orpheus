On my way home, police car pulled me over.  
After they left, I puttered out of gas.  
Triple-A' came, but my card was expired!  
I had to walk home, and of course, it rained half the time.  
I tried to get some shut-eye, then I was abducted!  
  
They put cold things in my butt.  
They sampled a bit of my D.N.A.  
They left me on top of my sheets,  
I dreamt I went potty, then woke up drenched in me.  
This day sucked the hardest ever  
  
I woke up on the wrong side of the bed today.  
A little bit less than nothing would go my way.  
I got up to toss my soiled sheets,  
the hallway was dark and I stubbed my big toe.  
It was then that I sensed the irony (burning me),  
then I heard the voice say,  
"Come sail aboard S.S. Nepenthe!"  
  
I suppose I'm to blame for getting pulled over.  
I guess I'm the culprit for running out of gas.  
Let's assume I'm the guy who didn't pay his 'Triple-A' fee.  
In actuality, I let the zetas probe me.  
Yesterday was all my fault.  
  
I let negativity get the better of me.  
Thank goodness for the bathtubs and suds!  
They temporarily set free this quandary
