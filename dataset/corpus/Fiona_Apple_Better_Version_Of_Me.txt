The nickel dropped when I was on  
My way beyond the Rubicon  
What did I do?  
And the games that I could handle  
  
And then the ones with a candle  
What can I do?  
I'm a frightened, fickle person,  
Fighting, cryin', kickin', cursin',  
  
What should I do?  
Oooh, after all the folderol  
And hauling over coal stops  
What will I do?  
  
Can't take a good day without a bad one  
Don't feel just to smile until I had one  
Where did I learn?  
I make a fuss about a little thing  
  
The rhyme is losing to the riddling  
Where's the turn?  
I don't want a home  
I go into habits where my habits have a habitat  
  
Why did it turn?  
Oooh, after all the folderol  
And hauling over coal stops  
What did I learn?  
  
I am likely to miss the main event  
If I stop to cry and complain again  
So I will keep a deliberate pace  
Let the damn breeze dry my face  
  
Ooh mister, wait until you see  
What I plan to be  
I've got a plan to demand and it just began  
And if you're right, you'll agree  
  
Here's coming a better version of me  
Here's coming a better version of me  
Here comes a better version of me
