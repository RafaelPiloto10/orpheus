Cody: (shouting) Alright, now.  
  
Cody: Oh, Charlie, I know you I want a big one  
You we're out here mowing all that lawn  
I got you there walking out the door  
And I don't ever hear your voice again  
I guess you're not taking your things away  
Seem like I never die  
Oh, I was singing "Lump", if I played the same old song  
I can look at the mirror instead  
I know I got my radio and I'm walking the line  
You've got something like a donut when I should find  
But I got nothing here I said I'm walking the line  
Charlie, can you bring it in  
  
Both:  
Who ever said it's like Wayne's world  
Don't know what I'm talking about  
I got you walking out the door  
Charlie trying to figure me out  
I know life's so funny  
There's more to my dummy  
Than how much I could say  
I gotta make a little dime for the big time  
Charlie, can you bring it in  
  
Charlie:  
I got some money I payed at the restaurant  
I told me that I wanna cry  
I've got the stereo blasting  
I've got my next TRO, rock music, and song requests  
I cried to called you on the phone and I got lost and drunk  
I guess you keep cleaning the room  
I've been reading my old books all day long, but you don't ever look at me  
I know your got your radio and you're walking the line  
I got something like a donut when I should find  
But you got nothing here I said I'm walking the line  
Cody, can you bring it in  
  
Both:

Cody trying to figure you out  
I know life is funny  
There's more to my dummy
