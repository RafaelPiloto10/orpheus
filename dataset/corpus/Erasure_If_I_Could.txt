Make the world a little better  
  
I don't believe you know what you're talking about  
I don't believe you go and ever find out for yourself  
Always got a lot to say  
Well I'm not listening anyway  
I'm not listening anyway  
  
If I could make the world a little better  
You know I would make the world a little better  
If I could make the world a little better  
  
I don't believe you care about the consequences  
I don't believe you share in what you know we know is true  
Turning keys and locking doors  
I won't accept that anymore  
Won't accept that anymore  
  
If I could make the world a little better  
You know I would make the world a little better  
If I could make the world a little better  
  
I don't believe you know about the hearts you've broken  
I don't believe you show what your intentions really are  
Can you hear? What have you done?  
There's not enough for everyone  
Not enough for anyone  
  
If I could make the world a little better  
You know I would make the world a little better  
If I could make the world a little better  
  
If I could make the world a little better  
You know I would make the world a little better  
If I could make the world a little better  
  
If I could, you know I would
