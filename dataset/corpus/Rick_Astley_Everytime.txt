Oh yeah baby, oh now girl, oh now lover  
Gonna stake my claim, gonna stand my ground  
Gonna love you while the world spins around  
Gonna be with you for the rest of my days  
And nothing's gonna stand in be way  
'Cause I want you baby, I need you baby  
I want to feel your body close to mine  
I mean it baby, believe me baby  
I know it to be true, 'cos  
  
[Chorus:]  
Every time you go away  
I kick myself, and then I say  
I'm a fool to let you go  
Understand I need you so  
Every time you go away  
I can't believe it then I say  
I'm a fool to let you go  
You're the one I need to know  
  
Ooh now baby, ooh now lover  
Gonna lift you up, make you feel alright  
I'm gonna make you whole tonight  
Gonna make you close. I'm gonna keep you near  
I'll love you for a thousand years and  
I want you baby, I need you baby  
I want to feel your body next to mine  
I mean it baby, believe me baby  
I know it to be true, 'cos  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Oh I know, that you're the one I need to know  
When the night are long  
You know I'll be right here, I'll chase away your fears  
And the days are so grey  
You know you'll find me here, anyway  
  
Gonna hold you tonight, every time you go away  
Gonna hold you tonight, I kick myself and then I say  
Gonna hold you tonight, I'm a fool to let you go  
Gonna hold you tonight, you're the one I need to know  
  
[Chorus:]
