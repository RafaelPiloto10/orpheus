I don't want to be the one that make you lonely  
I don't want to be the one that make you cry  
I just want to take you in my arms and hold you  
And keep you there until the day I die.  
  
I don't want to be the reason you're unhappy  
I don't want to be the one that makes you blue  
I just want to take you in my heart for always  
And love you dear that's all I want to do.  
  
I don't want to be the best man at your weddin'  
Unless I can be the one that says I do  
For I want to show you just how much I love you  
'Cause that's the only thing I want to do.  
  
I don't never want to be the one to hurts you  
I don't want to be the one that does you wrong  
I just want to be the one that's always near you  
The one that never leaves you all alone.  
  
I don't want to sit with you out in the moonlight  
And tell you lies like all the others do  
I just want to take you in my heart for always  
And love you dear that's all I want to do  
  
I don't want to be the best man at your weddin'  
Unless I can be the one that says I do  
For I want to show you just how much I love you  
'Cause that's the only thing I want to do
