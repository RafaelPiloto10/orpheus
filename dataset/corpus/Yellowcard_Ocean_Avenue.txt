There's a place off Ocean Avenue  
Where I used to sit and talk with you  
We were both 16 and it felt so right  
Sleeping all day, staying up all night  
Staying up all night  
  
There's a place on the corner of Cherry Street  
We would walk on the beach in our barefeet  
We were both 18 and it felt so right  
Sleeping all day, staying up all night  
Staying up all night  
  
If I could find you now things would get better  
We could leave this town and run forever  
Let your waves crash down on me  
And take me away, yeah yeah  
  
There's a piece of you that's here with me  
It's everywhere I go, it's everything I see  
When I sleep I dream and it gets me by  
I can make believe that you're here tonight  
That your here tonight  
  
If I could you find now things would get better  
We could leave this town and run forever  
I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together  
Let your waves crash down on me  
And take me away, yeah  
  
I remember the look in your eyes  
When I told you that this was goodbye  
You were begging me not tonight  
Not here, not now  
We're looking up at the same night sky  
We keep pretending the sun will not rise  
We'll be together for one more night  
Somewhere, somehow  
  
If I could find you now things would get better  
We could leave this town and run forever  
I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together  
Let your waves crash down on me  
And take me away, yeah yeah
