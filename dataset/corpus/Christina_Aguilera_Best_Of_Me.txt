Think I'm steel, tough as nails  
Never feel, never fail  
But you're wrong  
So damn wrong  
Feel the weight, of your hate  
I still bleed, my heart aches  
As you take  
And You take  
  
Words cut through my skin  
Tears roll down my chin  
My walls crumble within  
But I'll take it all on  
And get up when I fell  
Till the last curtain call  
  
But you'll never get the best of me, no more  
Said you'll never get the best of me, no more  
Aren't you tired of throwing stones  
Trying to kick me when I'm down  
But you'll never get the best of me, no more  
  
So you're cold, made of ice  
Heart of stone, born to fight  
But I cry  
I still cry  
Are you happy, you know  
I'm unhappy, you know  
Take your shot  
I'm wide open  
  
Words cut through my skin  
Tears roll down my chin  
My walls crumble within  
But I'll take it all on  
And get up when I fell  
Till the last curtain call  
  
But you'll never get the best of me, no more  
Said you'll never get the best of me, no more  
Aren't you tired of throwing stones  
Trying to kick me when I'm down  
But you'll never get the best of me, no more  
  
But you'll never get the best of me no more  
Said you'll never get the best of me no more  
Aren't you tired of throwing stones  
Trying to kick me when I'm down  
But you'll never get the best of me no more  
  
Heartbroken an beaten  
Knocked down and mistreated  
I will rise undefeated  
I will not let you bring me down  
Now the pain is deleted  
And I will never repeat it  
I will rise and defeat it  
I will not let you bring me down  
No I won't let you bring me down  
  
Knocked down and mistreated  
Heartbroken and bleeding  
Still I rise undefeated  
Cause you'll never  
  
Cause you'll never get the best of me no more  
Said you'll never get the best of me no more  
Aren't you tired of throwing stones  
Trying to kick me when I'm down  
But you'll never get the best of me no more  
  
Heartbroken and bleeding  
Knocked down and mistreated  
Still I rise undefeated  
I will not let you bring me down  
Now the pain is deleted  
And I will never repeat it  
I will rise and defeat it  
I will not let you bring me down
