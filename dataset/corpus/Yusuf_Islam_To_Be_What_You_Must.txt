I have journeyed endless miles  
Seen many harbors,  
Where I took rest awhile  
On this boat called "near and far"  
To be what you must,  
You must give up what you are  
  
Only on a wind of hope my heart sailed  
Braving mystic oceans to arrive  
Those who do not leave  
And choose to stay,  
Barely survive  
  
Be you dust, or be you star  
To be what you must  
Just reach out for what you are  
And though you've traveled many roads  
There's but one way, and that's the one you chose
