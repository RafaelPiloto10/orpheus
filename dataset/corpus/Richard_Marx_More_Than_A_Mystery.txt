Mesmerized since the day I saw you  
Maybe somewhere I've misplaced my pride  
In trying to prove I'm on your side  
We're two of the many walking wounded  
And all I want is to try to be the cure  
So we'll never feel loneliness anymore  
  
[Chorus:]  
I want to be declared your one and only  
Hear you say that I'm your destiny  
And I want you to be more than a mystery to me  
  
Am I making you feel uneasy  
Do you recognize the movie that we're in  
Every game you swore you'd never play you win  
Do you want to know the truth about you  
Do you even hear the voices in your head  
Can't you see I'm hanging there by a thread  
  
I want to feel your gentle arms around me  
Want to know the sweet taste of your kiss  
Want to hear you whisper  
"Baby, nothing's better than this"  
I want to be declared your one and only  
Hear you say that I'm your destiny  
And I want you to be more than a mystery to me  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
The more I reach out to you  
The harder you are to find  
How could I be so drawn to something so unkind  
  
Do I make you feel uneasy  
Am I saying any words you want to hear  
Love isn't really love without fear  
  
[Chorus:]
