I was born in Guilford County  
Way back up in the pines  
It's where I hold the sweetest memories  
In the hills of Caroline  
  
My daddy wasn't much of nothin'  
Spent his life doin' time  
But mama learned me about Jesus  
In the hills of Caroline  
  
I met a girl her name was Hattie  
Fair and tender, sweet and kind  
She showed me how to love a woman  
In the hills of Caroline  
  
I always thought that we would marry  
One sweet day she would be mine  
But Hattie's gone, to live with Jesus  
In the hills of Caroline  
  
If I should die before tomorrow  
Just one request if you don't mind  
Just bury me right next to Hattie  
In the hills of Caroline  
  
Bury me right next to Hattie  
In the hills of Caroline
