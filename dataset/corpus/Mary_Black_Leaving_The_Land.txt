It's time to go, jenny  
No need to close the door  
What if the dust gets in the house  
It doesn't matter any more  
You and the dust have been at war for far too many years  
Now the war is over jenny dear.  
Chorus  
Leaving the land  
Leaving the land  
Leaving all I've ever been and everything I am  
Leaving the land.  
Remember when I brought you here  
Those long bright years ago  
For all that time you've been my heart  
And this land has been my soul  
The long bright days are over now but still the heart beats on  
But jenny dear the soul is gone.  
Chorus  
I't time to go, jenny  
Drive quickly down the track  
We'll never see what lies ahead if we keep on looking back  
Behind is just an empty house  
Old memories and ghosts  
And our small dream gathering dust.  
Chorus
