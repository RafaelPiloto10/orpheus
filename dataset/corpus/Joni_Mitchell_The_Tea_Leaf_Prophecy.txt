Study war no more  
Lay down your arms  
Study war no more  
Lay 'em down, lay 'em down now  
Study war no more  
Lay down your arms  
Study war no more  
  
Newsreels rattle the Nazi dread--  
The able-bodied have shipped away--  
Molly McGee gets her tea-leaves read--  
You'll be married in a month they say  
"These leaves are crazy!  
Look at this town--there's no men left!  
Just frail old boys and babies  
Talking to teacher in the treble clef."  
  
She plants her garden in the spring  
She does the winter shoveling  
Tokyo rose on the radio  
She says she's leavin' but she don't go  
  
Out of the blue, just passin' through  
A young flight sergeant  
On two weeks leave--  
Says "Molly McGee, no one else will do!"  
And seals the tea-leaf prophecy.  
Oh these nights are strong and soft  
Private passions and secret storms  
Nothin' about him ticks her off  
And he looks so cute in his uniform  
  
She plants her garden in the spring  
He does the winter shoveling  
But summer's just a sneeze  
In a long-long-bad-winter cold  
She says, "I'm leavin' here" but she don't go"  
  
"Sleep little darlin'!  
This is your happy home  
Hiroshima cannot be pardoned!  
Don't have kids when you get grown.  
Because, this world is shattered  
The wise are mourning--  
The fools are joking  
Oh, what does it matter?  
The wash needs ironing  
And the fire needs stoking."  
  
She plants her garden in the spring  
He does the winter shoveling  
The three of 'em laughing 'round the radio  
She says "I'm leavin' here" but she don't go"  
  
She plants her garden in the spring  
They do the winter shoveling  
They sit up late and watch the  
Johnny Carson show  
She says "I'm leavin' here but she don't go"
