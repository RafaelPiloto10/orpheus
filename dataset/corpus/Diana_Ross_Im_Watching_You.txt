Hello baby, it's a long time  
I know you're here  
I feel you close to me  
So much to say but  
Making all the words  
I save them all inside  
Then I see you and they disappear  
Like leaves beneath the snow  
And life don't wait for everyone  
And yesterday, I let you go  
  
I'm watching you tonight  
And I waited for so long  
I've been living on your memory  
In a world where we were one  
And you told me you could make it on your own  
  
I'm watching you tonight  
And it's making me cry  
When I lost you, I lost everything  
But our love should never die  
Not mine, my love is born to be your love  
Oh baby  
To make history near you  
But the moment when I see me in your eyes  
You're gone, you're gone  
  
You can say goodbye if you want to  
I love you but I'll try to understand  
But in my soul I know it's meant to be  
Together you and me  
  
But I know you came to fade away  
Like voices in the wind  
And I wonder if you feel my love  
It's stronger than it's ever been  
  
I'm watching you tonight  
And there's no other one  
All the love we gave eternally  
Now it's dying in the sun  
Not mine, my love was born to be your love  
Oh baby  
To make history near you  
But that moment when I see me in your eyes  
You're gone, you're gone, you're gone
