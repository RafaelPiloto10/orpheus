Learn how to love  
Learn how to walk  
Learn how to talk  
Like a baby talk  
  
Learn how to see  
See what I want  
Learn how a baby  
Does and I don'ts  
  
And I'm a changed man  
I've been baptized  
And I'm a changed man  
I'm a brand new guy, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Alright let me tell you, mama  
You put a feeling in my soul  
You make me fast that I had them holes  
You did this, baby  
You did that  
You little girl you showed me where I was at  
  
Now I'm a changed man  
I've been baptized  
And I'm a changed man  
I'm a brand new guy, yeah, yeah  
  
Alright, let me sing it  
Ja, ja, ja etc.  
Alright, you made a change in me, mama  
  
Bet you're a man  
Whose life is a blink  
So messed up, you know  
He couldn't even think  
  
But you came along  
Stopped my own going  
Gave me enough love  
To keep five minutes going  
  
And I'm a changed man  
I've been baptized  
And I'm a changed man  
I'm a brand new guy, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Alright, let me sing my song know  
  
Ja, ja, ja  
  
You gave me love  
You gave me everything  
Gave me love  
Brought my heart sing  
You gave me pants  
You gave me clothes  
You gave me something to thin my holes, now  
Oughta, ja, ja, ja
