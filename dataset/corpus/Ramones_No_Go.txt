I got a call late Saturday night alright  
Yeah I got a call late Saturday night alright  
Beat, dead, burnt out from the night before  
I wanted to go but couldn't take it no more  
  
Beat, dead, burnt out you know what I mean  
My brain was racin' but my feet wouldn't scream  
  
Let's go let's go  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
My brain was racin' but my feet wouldn't go  
Let's fly, let's fly  
Yeah you and I  
Oh my my my  
  
Oh oh oh  
My brain was racin' but my feet wouldn't fly  
Hey

Oh no
