I've seen your picture in the paper, on the front page of magazines  
I pulled the trigger right at you on billboards and movie screens  
When I talk it's to myself, 'cause I know your kind just like everyone else  
Maybe it'll work itself out in time, before I lose my mind  
  
You, you're out-a-touch, all alone in the danger zone and I think too much  
You're out-a-touch  
  
I keep your letters by the mirror, you're the subject of every dream  
You're not so invincible and I'm not what I might seem  
When I look it's in your eyes, and I know your look, you can hypnotize  
How long does it have to last like this, a Kodachrome kiss  
  
You, you're out-a-touch, all alone in the danger zone and I think too much  
You, you're out-a-touch  
You're in my sight all through the night and I see too much  
You're out-a-touch  
  
Can't you see I'm obsessed, I'd do anything, I'm possessed  
I'm in a constant rage with preliminary stage, I need you, I need you  
  
I've seen your picture in the paper, on the front page of magazines  
I pulled the trigger right at you on Billboards movie screens  
When I look it's in your eyes, and I know your look, you can hypnotize  
How long does it have to last like this, a Kodachrome kiss  
  
You, you're out-a-touch, all alone in the danger zone and I think too much  
You're out-a-touch  
  
I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you  
I need you, I need you, I need you, I need you
