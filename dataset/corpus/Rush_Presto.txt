If I could wave my magic wand  
  
I am made from the dust of the stars  
And the oceans flow in my veins  
Here I hide in the heart of the city  
Like a stranger coming out of the rain  
  
The evening plane rises up from the runway  
Over constellations of light  
I look down into a million houses  
And wonder what you're doing tonight  
  
If I could wave my magic wand  
I'd make everything all right  
  
I'm not one to believe in magic  
But I sometimes have a second-sight  
I'm not one with a sense of proportion  
When my heart still changes overnight  
  
I had a dream of a winter garden  
A midnight rendezvous  
Silver, blue, and frozen silence  
What a fool I was for you  
  
I had a dream of the open water  
I was swimming away out to sea  
So deep I could never touch bottom  
What a fool I used to be  
  
If I could wave my magic wand  
I'd set everybody free  
  
I'm not one to believe in magic  
Though my memory has a second-sight  
I'm not one to go pointing my finger  
When I radiate more heat than light  
  
Don't ask me  
I'm just improvising  
My illusion of careless flight  
Can't you see  
My temperature's rising  
I radiate more heat than light  
  
Don't ask me  
I'm just sympathizing  
My illusions a harmless flight  
Can't you see  
My temperature's rising  
I radiate more heat than light
