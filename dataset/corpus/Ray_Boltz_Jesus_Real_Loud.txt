Jesus Real Loud  
Words and music by Ray Boltz  
The doors opened up  
And I got on the elevator  
I saw the other people  
Who were standing around  
Everyone was silent  
No one made a sound  
And I thought,  
What if I said Jesus real loud?  
Hey!  
Chorus:  
What if I said Jesus real loud?  
What if I just lifted up my voice  
And did it now?  
Would you think I was a prophet?  
Would you still want me around?  
What if I said Jesus real loud?  
What if I said Jesus real loud?  
What if I just lifted up my voice  
Above the crowd?  
Would you think I was a prophet?  
Would you think I was a clown?  
What if I said Jesus real loud?  
The doors opened up  
And I went in the dentist's office  
They handed me a magazine  
They told me to sit down  
Everyone was waiting  
No one made a sound  
And I thought,  
What if I said Jesus real loud?  
Hey!  
Chorus  
It's ok sometimes to whisper  
But hey, listen to me mister  
The way we act can anybody tell?  
Lift your voice a little higher  
Smell the smoke and feel the fire  
Ain't it time somebody  
Started to yell?  
Chorus  
What if I said Jesus real loud?  
What if I said Jesus real loud?
