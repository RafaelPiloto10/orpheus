Get a blunt, roll the weed, light it up nigga,  
Sipping on Gin and Juice fill up your cups nigga,  
The Westcoast back crackin' like it's 94',  
So bitch get on your knees and give me head like it's 94',  
And don't come up for air 'til the beat drop,  
I'm the Doctors Advocate call it a sneak peak,  
At the mudafukn Detox, take note grab a pen,  
And let the world know the west is ridin' again,  
I Graduated from Dre's school top of my class,  
Treat my switches like my bitches got me dropping that ass,  
Still bangin' the chronic like doggiestyle came with it,  
And I roll a sticky on my bitch back while I hit it,  
I done been there, done that, had beefs and won that,  
5 million records on 1 plaque I hung that,  
Still got Dr. Dre low ridin' in the 64',  
When you see us, throw it up for the fukin' Westcoast.  
  
My heart beat for the Westcoast,  
We pull the best weed in the Westcoast,  
We low ridin' in the Westcoast,  
So I'm'a die for the mudafukn Westcoast.  
My heart beat for the Westcoast,

Uncle Snoopy is it true you from that money game,  
All the time neph' I gotta let my nuts hang,  
A chest full of chains a left han' wit' a pinky ring,  
I'm in a steeler caps, Swisha Sweets peel em back,  
My lil' hood rat, baby got that mini mack,  
Baby got that 20 sack, baby got plenty that,  
Whatever you send it's my nugga, we gonna send it back  
I'm in the club, with the snub, getting' love,  
With 20 thousand Crips and 20 thousand Bloods,  
And we don't give a fuck about none of ya'll,  
And when you hit the city, you better holla at the Big Dogg,  
I done seen niggas hit LA and get dey chain snatched,  
Then they call me up, beggin' me to get dey chain back,  
What I look like the mudafukin Police,  
It's certain rules you got to follow, when you in these streets,  
Especially when it comes to this Cali shit,  
And I ain't talkin' bout hangin' in the valley Bitch,  
Gang bang niggas all up in the alley Crip,  
On some real talk nigga we the real Westcoast.

Damn, I heard blue rag niggas ain't fucking with the red rag niggas,  
On the Westcoast (Fuck you mean),  
Shit from what I seen, red and blue can make green,  
Black wallstreet and X-o-leen,  
Since jealousy breeds hatred, hatred breeds violence,  
Violence breeds enemies more permanent silence,  
California alliance, is more important than ever so throw it up,  
We low ridin' together (YEAH!)  
Make the Westcoast rise forever, esse's be's and see's represent your letter,  
Got Game the go getter, Xzibit the rhyme spitter, Snoop Dogg the boss,  
We gangster at all costs, ya'll niggas is so soft and pussies so fuck off,  
For one of my niggas draw that hammer and dump off,  
This kush you gon' cough, (Cough, Cough)

Bang the coast my nigga.
