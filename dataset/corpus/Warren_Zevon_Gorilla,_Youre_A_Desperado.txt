Big gorilla at the L.A. Zoo  
Snatched the glasses right off my face  
Took the keys to my BMW  
Left me here to take his place  
  
I wish the ape a lot of success  
I'm sorry my apartment's a mess  
Most of all I'm sorry if I made you blue  
I'm betting the gorilla will, too  
  
They say Jesus will find you wherever you go  
But when He'll come looking for you, they don't know  
In the mean time, keep your profile low  
Gorilla, you're a desperado  
  
He built a house on an acre of land  
He called it 'Villa Gorilla Now'  
I hear he's getting divorced  
Laying low at L'Ermitage, of course  
  
Then the ape grew very depressed  
Went through Transactional Analysis  
He plays racquetball and runs in the rain  
Still he's shackled to a platinum chain  
  
Big gorilla at the L.A. Zoo
