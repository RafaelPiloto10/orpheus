How do you start over again?  
Tell me, where do you begin?  
What does a loser do  
When love seems lost?  
When bridges are burning  
can they still be crossed?  
  
How do you start over,over again?  
How do you begin what's already been?  
  
When love was young,we knew our love would last  
But now our dreams are somewhere in the past  
And I don't know which way to go  
I only know I miss you so  
And wish somehow it could be  
the way it was with you and me  
Remember when  
How do you start over,over again?  
  
How do you make love when the feeling is gone?  
How do you make wrong right,when right seems so wrong?  
  
Just tell me you love me and then  
We can start over, over again
