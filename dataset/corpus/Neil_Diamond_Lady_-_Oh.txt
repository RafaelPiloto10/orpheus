Lady-oh, lady-oh, I walked the streets again last night.  
I saw you in the city light like a vision, lady-oh.  
Lady I, lady I, I've been waitin' around such a long long time  
Believin' I could make you mine, just wanting you lady-oh.  
But here I am and there you are, much too far to even hear me.  
Hurts a lot, you know it does, it hurts a lot.  
Oh, lady-oh, am I gonna ever learn what I never learned before?  
City lights, city lights burn so warm and they burn so bright,  
But me, I walk the city night to forget you, lady-oh.  
But here I am and there you are, much too far to even hear me.  
Hurts a lot, you know it does, it hurts a lot.  
Oh, lady-oh, am I gonna ever learn what I never learned before
