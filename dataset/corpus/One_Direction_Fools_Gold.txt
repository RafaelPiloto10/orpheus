[Verse 1: Niall Horan]  
I'm like a crow on a wire  
You're the shining distraction that makes me fly, oh  
I'm like a boat on the water  
You're the rays on the waves that calm my mind  
Oh, every time  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Harry Styles]  
But I know in my heart, you're not a constant star  
  
[Chorus: Harry Styles]  
And yeah, I let you use me from the day that we first met  
But I'm not done yet, falling for your  
Fool's gold  
And I knew then, you turned it on for everyone you met  
But I don't regret falling for your  
Fool's gold  
  
[Verse 2: Liam Payne]  
I'm the first to admit that I'm reckless  
I get lost in your beauty and I can't see, two feet in front of me  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Louis Tomlinson]  
And I know in my heart, you're just a moving part  
  
[Chorus:]  
And yeah, I let you use me from the day that we first met  
But I'm not done yet, falling for your  
Fool's gold  
And I knew then, you turned it on for everyone you met  
But I don't regret falling for your  
Fool's gold  
  
[Bridge: Zayn Malik]  
Yeah, I know your love's not real  
That's not the way it feels  
That's not the way you feel  
  
[Chorus:]  
And yes, I let you use me from the day that we first met  
But I'm not done yet, falling for your  
Fool's gold  
And I knew then, you turned it on for everyone you met  
But I don't regret falling for your  
Fool's gold
