Forgive me father for I've sinned  
I know your mercy has no end  
Save me from this state I'm in  
I drifted on again  
  
A greater love I will not find  
Your son you gave up for mankind  
Kneeling down before the cross  
Now I'm no longer lost  
  
Oh God, oh God you give me so much love  
Oh God, oh God you saved me through your blood  
  
I'm thirsty, yes, I thirst for you  
You know me better than I do  
You rescued me before I drowned  
A lost sheep has been found  
  
Only truth will set me free  
So holy spirit come to me  
Take my life into your hands  
Whatever that demands  
  
Oh God, oh God you give me so much love  
Oh God, oh God you saved me through your blood  
So much love, bless my soul, eternal life  
  
Be careful be careful be careful  
Be careful be careful be careful  
Be careful be careful be careful  
Be careful be careful be careful  
  
Oh God, oh God you give me so much love  
Oh God, oh God you saved me through your blood  
Oh God, oh God you give me so much love  
Oh God, oh God you saved me through your blood  
So much love bless my soul eternal life
