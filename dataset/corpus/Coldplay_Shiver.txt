So I look in your direction  
But you pay me no attention, do you  
I know you don't listen to me  
'Cause you say you see straight through me, don't you  
  
And on and on from the moment I wake  
To the moment I sleep  
I'll be there by your side  
Just you try and stop me  
I'll be waiting in line  
Just to see if you can  
  
Did she want me to change  
Well I change for good  
And I want you to know  
But you always get your way  
I wanted to say  
  
Don't you shiver, shiver, shiver  
  
I'll always be waiting for you  
So you know how much I need you  
But you never even see me, do you  
  
And is this is my final chance of getting you  
  
And on and on from the moment I wake  
To the moment I sleep  
I'll be there by your side  
Just you try and stop me  
I'll be waiting in line  
Just to see if you care  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Did she want me to change  
Well I change for good  
And I want you to know  
But you always get your way  
I wanted to say  
  
Don't you shiver  
Don't you shiver  
  
Sing it loud and clear  
I'll always be waiting for you  
  
Yeah I'll always be waiting for you  
Yeah I'll always be waiting for you  
Yeah I'll always be waiting for you  
For you I will always be waiting  
  
And it's you I see, but you don't see me  
And it's you I hear, so loud and clear  
I sing it loud and clear  
And I'll always be waiting for you  
  
So I look in your direction  
But you pay me no attention  
And you know how much I need you  
But you never even see me
