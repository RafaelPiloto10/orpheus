Sometimes at night I don't know why  
I get the feeling that I wanna say goodbye  
I can see me packin' up a bag and walkin' out the door  
I'm goin' back to live the life I used to live before  
  
Out on my own, all by myself  
Not takin' care of me or anybody else  
But how could I ever word it in the note I'd have write?  
Oh, I don't know how to say goodbye  
  
I lie in bed and I'm wide awake  
Next to the one whose heart I'd hate to have to break  
Then I look into her pretty eyes that don't deserve to cry  
And I don't know how to say goodbye  
  
Each time I hold her it's love all over  
And in my heart it's understood  
I'll never learn how to live without her  
And I'd be crazy if I could  
  
She's good to me and I believe  
She let me go with it meant happiness for me  
Maybe that's the reason why I find my tongue is tied  
And I don't know how to say goodbye  
  
Each time I hold her it's love all over  
And in my heart it's understood  
I'll never learn how to live without her  
And I'd be crazy if I could  
  
I love her so I wanna tell her now  
I think I'll wake her with a kiss and show her how  
And I know she'll whisper in my ear a million reasons why  
I don't know how to say goodbye  
  
And when she's layin' in my arms I cannot tell a lie  
I don't know how to say goodbye  
  
I don't know how to say goodbye  
I don't know how to say goodbye
