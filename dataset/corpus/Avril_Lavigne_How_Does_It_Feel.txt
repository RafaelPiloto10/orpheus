I'm not afraid of anything,  
I just need to know that I can breathe  
And I don't need much of anything  
But suddenly suddenly  
  
I am small and the world is big  
All around me is fast moving  
Surrounded by so many things  
Suddenly suddenly,  
  
[Chorus]  
How does it feel to be  
Different from me  
Are we the same  
How does it feel?  
How does it feel to be  
Different from me  
Are we the same  
How does it feel?  
  
I am Young and I am free  
But I get tired and I get weak  
I get lost and I can't sleep  
But suddenly suddenly  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Would you comfort me...  
Would you cry with me...  
Uh-uh-oh-oh uh-oh uh-oh [Repeat: x2]  
  
I am small and the world is big  
But I'm not afraid of anything  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
How does it feel  
How does it feel  
Your different from me  
Different [Repeat: x3]  
  
Your different from me...
