Oooh ooh oo....  
I have loved you for so long  
Can't imagine myself with another  
You're so much a part of me  
You're inside me  
I wanna be good enough for you  
In everything I do  
Don't you ever set me free  
I'd rather be locked up in your arms can't you see  
There's no place I would rather be  
I'll go wherever your love takes me  
Refrain:  
('Cause) You were meant for me  
As I was meant for you  
You were meant for me  
Together we will always be  
('Cause) You were meant for me  
You were meant for me  
My love gets stronger day by day  
Strong enough to stand the test of time  
And even when times are rough  
We were tough enough  
There's nothing I can do  
With you I'll see life through  
No one else can make me feel  
So good with your love so real  
Nothing else can ever replace  
Your kisses and your warm embrace  
(Repeat Refrain)  
Bridge:  
I love you so much, baby  
You just drive me crazy  
I'm hooked on your lovin' touch  
With you this life worth living  
For you I'll keep on trying  
I'll never, ever let you down  
Instrumental  
I'll keep holding on  
Instrumental  
(Repeat Refrain, ad lib, fade out)
