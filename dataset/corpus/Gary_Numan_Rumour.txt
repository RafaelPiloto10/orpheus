I listen to rumours  
Stone cold and bleeding  
They burn my heart away  
Left me alone and afraid  
Words seem to leave me  
Just when I needed them  
Just like I need you  
Like I'm supposed to do  
They say:  
Love is deceiving  
She won't stay forever  
Love is deceiving  
Is all that she knows  
Love is deceiving  
She'll leave you forever  
Love is deceiving  
She comes and she goes  
I wonder  
I wonder  
I listen to rumours  
Listen to everyone  
Everyone but you  
And now it's all too late
