Wake up, Maggie I think I got something to say to you  
It's late September and I really should be back at school  
I know I keep you amused, but I feel I'm being used  
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more  
You led me away from home  
Just to save you from being alone  
You stole my heart, and that's what really hurts  
  
The morning sun, when it's in your face really shows your age  
But that don't worry me none in my eyes, you're everything  
  
I laughed at all of your jokes  
My love you didn't need to coax  
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more  
  
You led me away from home  
Just to save you from being alone  
You stole my soul, and that's a pain I can do without.  
  
All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand  
But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover you wore me out  
All you did was wreck my bed  
And, in the morning, kick me in the head  
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more  
You led me away from home  
'Cause you didn't want to be alone  
You stole my heart, I couldn't leave you if I tried  
  
I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school  
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool  
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band  
That needs a helping hand  
Oh, Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face  
You made a first-class fool out of me  
But I'm as blind as a fool can be  
You stole my heart, but I love you anyway  
  
Maggie I wish that I'd never seen your face  
I'll get a ride home one of these days
