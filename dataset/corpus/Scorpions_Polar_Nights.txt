Down, down  
That's bringing me down  
The stars in the sky  
Seem to fall to the ground.  
Time, time  
  
I'm chasing the time  
The stars in the sky  
Seem to be turning round.  
  
Is that the wind in your eyes  
That is soothing my mind?  
Is that the night of your eyes  
That is soothing my mind?  
  
Round, round  
My mind's whirling round  
The moons in the sky  
Seem to burn on the ground.  
Gone, gone  
  
My nightmares are gone  
The moons in the sky  
Seemed to eat up the sun.  
  
Is that the wind in your eyes  
That is soothing my mind?  
Is that the night in your eyes  
That is soothing my mind?  
Back from polar nights  
  
I was down  
I was out  
The nights at the pole've been  
So cold without you!  
I was down  
I was out  
The pole-star was bringing me  
Back home to you.  
  
Is that the wind in your eyes  
That is soothing my mind?  
Is that the night in your eyes  
That is soothing my mind?
