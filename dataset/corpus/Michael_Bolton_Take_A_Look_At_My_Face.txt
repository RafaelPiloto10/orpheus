I said a lot of things  
A lot of things I didn't mean to say  
Never meant to hurt you  
I was wrong to fight with you that way  
But I'm only human  
I let my pride deceive me  
You're the lover I need in my life  
If you still don't believe me  
  
Baby take a look at my face  
Tell me you don't see what you started  
No one's gonna take your place  
Right here by my side  
Baby take a look at my face  
You're never gonna be broken-hearted  
If you still don't know what you mean to me  
Take a look at my face  
  
From the day I found you  
You brought light into my heart  
So don't keep your love away from me  
Don't leave me in the dark  
Though I never tell you  
What my heart's concealing  
You're the lover I need in my life  
Can't you feel what I'm feeling  
  
Baby take a look at my face  
Tell me you don't see what you started  
No one's gonna take your place  
  
Baby take a look at my face  
You're never gonna be broken-hearted  
If you still don't know what you mean to me  
Take a look at my face  
  
You could think it over  
You could make it easy  
I'm the lover you need in your life  
If you still don't believe me  
  
Baby take a look at my face  
Tell me you don't see what you started  
No one's gonna take your place  
Right here by my side  
Baby take a look at my face  
You're never gonna be broken-hearted  
If you still don't know what you mean to me  
Take a look at my face
