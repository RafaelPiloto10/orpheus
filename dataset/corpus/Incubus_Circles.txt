You saw me lost in treading water  
I looked pathetic and as helpless as a stinger without a bee  
But underneath my presentation. Yeah  
I knew the walls were coming down  
And the stones that fell were aiming away from me  
  
Hey what would it mean to you?  
To know that it'll come back around again  
Hey whatever it means to you  
Know that everything moves in circles  
  
I saw you standing in my headlights Blink blink blink  
I thought Id run you down for the weight you left on me  
But then I pressed rewind, reversed and drove away  
And see you, disappear in my rear view  
Brought to me the word reciprocity  
  
Hey what would it mean to you?  
To know that it'll come back around again  
Hey whatever it means to you  
Know that everything moves in circles  
  
Round and round we go  
We could know when it ends so well  
We fall on and we fall off  
Existential carousel  
  
Hey what would it mean to you?  
To know that it'll come back around again  
Hey whatever it means to you  
Know that everything moves in circles  
Everything moves in circles
