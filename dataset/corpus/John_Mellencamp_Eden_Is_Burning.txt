Diane and Jack went to the movies  
They went to see Richard Pryor  
Screamin' on his knees for his lover  
How could have I been wrong about you?  
How could I have been so wrong about you?  
  
[Chorus:]  
Eden is burning  
I can see it from my window  
Better take it to the water  
Eden is burning  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Eden is burning  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Thinking of Havana  
Eating cream and bananas  
You and me in the sunshine  
How could have I been wrong about you?  
How could I have been so wrong about you?  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
How could have I been wrong about you?  
How could I have been so wrong about you?  
With love on our side  
With love on our side  
  
Here's the masquerade of our living  
Well, I hope it makes you feel better  
It's for our own protection  
I thought we were forever, me and you  
But nothin's forever, I guess it's true  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
