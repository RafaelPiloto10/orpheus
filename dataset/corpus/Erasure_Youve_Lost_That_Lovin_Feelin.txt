You never close your eyes anymore when I kiss your lips  
And there's no tenderness like before in your fingertips  
You're trying hard not to show it baby  
But baby, baby I know it  
  
You've lost that lovin' feelin'  
Woah, that lovin' feelin'  
You've lost that lovin' feelin'  
Now it's gone, gone, gone, woah  
  
Now there's no welcome look in your eyes when I reach for you  
And now you're starting to criticise everything I do  
It makes me just feel like crying baby  
'Cause baby, something beautiful's dyin'  
  
You lost that lovin' feelin'  
Woah, that lovin' feelin'  
You've lost that lovin' feelin'  
Now it's gone, gone, gone, woah  
  
Baby, baby, I'd get down on my knees for you  
If you would only love me like you used to do  
We had a love, a love, a love you don't find everyday  
So don't, don't, don't, don't let it slip away  
  
Baby (baby), baby (baby)  
I beg you please (please), please (please)  
I need your love (need your love)  
I need your love (need your love)  
Just bring it on back (bring it on back)  
Just bring it on back (bring it on back)  
  
Bring back that lovin' feelin'  
Woah, that lovin' feelin'  
Bring back that lovin' feelin'  
Now it's gone, gone, gone, woah  
  
Bring back that lovin' feelin'  
Woah, that lovin' feelin'  
Bring back that lovin' feelin'  
Now it's gone, gone, gone  
And I can't go on, woah
