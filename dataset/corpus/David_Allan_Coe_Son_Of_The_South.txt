I like to play Hank Williams Jr. records just as loud as they will go  
I'm into Lynyrd Skynyrd  
The Allman Brothers and David Allan Coe  
I like Willie, Waylon, George, and Merle  
And a lot of ZZ Top  
They play country, soul, rock and roll  
I really like Kid Rock  
  
Chorus  
And I'm a redneck  
A rock-n-roll son of the south  
I don't like no new wave disco bands around  
I'm gonna drink a couple dozen beers  
Go out and jam some gears  
I'm a long haired redneck rock-n-roll son of the south  
  
I've got a 1965 Harley chopper  
It sure makes those women stare  
A dead flamingo wrapped around the cowboy hats I wear  
I can cuss I can fight I can spit I can belch I can raise all kinds of hell  
If you ride to live like I live to ride let me hear some rebel yells  
  
Chorus  
And I'm a redneck  
A rock-n-roll son of the south  
I don't like no new wave disco bands around  
I'm gonna drink a couple dozen beers  
Go out and jam some gears  
I'm a long haired redneck rock-n-roll son of the south  
  
I like my whiskey straight up  
Daqueri just makes me ill  
If someone touches my cowboy hat I get mad enough to kill  
I got a rifle rack in my pickup truck  
I'm a four wheelin' maniac  
And if you want to race name the place  
I'll show you where it's at mother fucker  
  
Chorus  
And I'm a redneck  
A rock-n-roll son of the south  
I don't like no new wave disco bands around  
I'm gonna drink a couple dozen beers  
Go out and jam some gears  
I'm a long haired redneck rock-n-roll son of the south  
  
I'm a long haired redneck rock-n-roll son of the south  
I'm a long haired redneck rock-n-roll son of the south
