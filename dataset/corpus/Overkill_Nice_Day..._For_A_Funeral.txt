Black suits. eyes closed.  
Nothing left to hear.  
One mistake. blame the youth,  
Crossed the line of fear.  
Burn the bridges that we crossed in time,  
Seemed the, only way.  
Not for nothing was his only crime,  
A final price to pay.  
  
Black days, loss for words.  
When there's so much left to say.  
Time's mine, have so much time,  
Since I went away.  
Back across the bridges burned,  
Now you walk alone.  
The lights are on the doors unlocked,  
No one is home.  
  
I saw the last of sunshine.  
I'm going back to Mother Earth.  
A cry of independence,  
Ends in death  
  
Yeah, the last of sunshine,  
Oh, ya know, for what it's worth  
Nice day for a funeral.  
  
One last time to turn your back.  
Don't kiss me when I go.  
Don't wonder why it came to this,  
You didn't want to know.  
A bastard child and his misspent youth,  
Yeah, he's yours and mine.  
We're digging graves, not the buried truth  
If only we had the time.  
  
Yeah, the last of sunshine  
Oh ya know, for what it's worth.  
Nice day for a funeral  
Yeah, the last of sunshine.  
I'm going back to Mother Earth.  
A cry of independence,  
Ends in death
