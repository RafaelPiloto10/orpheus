Sometimes I think about Saturday's child  
And all about the times when we were running wild  
  
I've been a-searchin' for the dolphins in the sea  
Ah, but sometimes I wonder, do you ever think of me  
  
This old world will never change the way it's been  
And all our ways of war can't change it back again  
  
I've been a-searchin' for the dolphin in the sea  
Ah, but sometimes I wonder, do you ever think of me  
  
Lord, I'm not the one to tell this old world how to get  
along  
I only know that peace will come when all our hate is gone  
  
I've been a-searchin' for the dolphin in the sea  
Ah, but sometimes I wonder, do you ever think of me
