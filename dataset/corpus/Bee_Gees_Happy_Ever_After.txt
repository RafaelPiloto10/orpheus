Though I know it's time to take you home,  
Baby, you and I are all alone.  
We could take a moment of our own  
And look what we've got.  
  
You could destroy this heart of mine.  
I'm only trying to get by,  
Hiding in the shadows of the night,  
Holding you and knowing the wrong is right.  
  
Show me some mercy.  
You know what you're doing is making me a happy man.  
I shield you from the rain.  
I've been slow to get you but I'm working as hard as I can.  
  
This time, it's what we believe is true.  
And whether you believe I'm in love with you  
I gotta be sure that you say what you mean.  
  
Is it only a dream to a teenage queen?  
And all the years of tears and laughter  
We could go through,  
Will it be happy ever after  
For me and you? Ooh. Ah.  
  
Heaven is a place inside of me  
Living with your heart as company.  
Only you can change the way I feel  
And make it feel good.  
  
Where there is love there is no crime.  
I'm only trying to get mine.  
Let me be the one to dry your eyes.  
We can be the promise that never dies.  
  
Light of an angel,  
Blinded by the vision I'm wishing we could travel on.  
Stay with me, baby,  
Any less than an hour you be leaving me lonely too long.  
  
This time, it's what we believe is true.  
And whether you believe I'm in love with you.  
I gotta be sure that you say what you mean.  
  
Is it only a dream to a teenage queen?  
And you define the dream you're after,  
Make it come true.  
Will it be happy ever after,  
Will it be happy ever after  
For me and you?
