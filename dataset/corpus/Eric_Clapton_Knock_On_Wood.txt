I don't want to lose this good thing that I've got.  
If I do, I would surely, surely lose a lot,  
'Cause your love is better than any love I know.  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's like thunder, lightning,  
The way you love me is frightening.  
Think I'd better knock on wood, baby.  
  
I'm not superstitious about you, I can't take no chance.  
You got me spinning, baby. Baby, I'm in a trance,  
'Cause your love is better than any love I know.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ain't no secret, that woman is my loving cup.  
She sees to it that I get it up.  
Just one touch from her, you know can do so much.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Think I better knock, knock, knock on wood.  
Think I better knock, knock, knock on wood.
