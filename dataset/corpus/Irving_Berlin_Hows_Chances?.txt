When I want to see the boys  
I know where to find the boys  
I don't go through a club or two  
I just find you and there are the boys  
To get you alone I strive  
You ask me to tea at five  
I find you then with other men  
And wonder when my chance will arrive  
  
How's chances, say, how are the chances  
Of making you love me the way I love you  
  
How many young men must I fight with  
To be in right with  
In right with you  
  
How's chances for one of those glances  
A glimpse of the heaven I'm longing to see  
  
How's chances to end all your romances  
And start taking your chances with me  
  
  
[alternate bridge:]  
My castle will need some restoring  
Ceiling and flooring  
Furniture, too
