You're on a mission to open my heart  
I learned your lesson: don't play it smart  
You came close, I played it tough  
You went away, I'm in the rough  
  
Running, crying, turning around  
Screaming, shouting, love to be found  
I'm in love  
  
I got to know it, got a solution  
Shift my cards and bring them back to center  
I got to know it, end of confusion  
Shift my heart and try to remember  
Desire, motion, shout, and kiss  
I'm in love  
  
I'm on a mission, crawling on the floor  
I learned my lesson, please open your door  
You came close, I played it cool  
You went away, I'm such a fool  
  
Running, crying, turning around  
Screaming, shouting, love to be found  
I'm in love  
I'm in love  
  
She's got to know it, got a solution  
Shift my cards and bring them back to center  
She's got to know it, end of confusion  
Shift my heart and try to remember  
Desire, motion, shout, and kiss  
I'm in love
