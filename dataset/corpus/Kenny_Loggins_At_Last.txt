I can't tell you 'bout the future  
I wouldn't even swear about the past  
One thing I know for certain  
That's when your heart stops hurting  
Falling in love, caught up with me at last  
  
Always knew it would, never had it so good  
Now my time's arrived, and I'm glad I'm alive  
I feel like a love today, and it won't fade away  
In my heart, I know it's right  
By the way that I'm sleepin at night  
  
People say that love ain't easy  
Find a little love and let it dawn  
One thing I know for certain  
It'll make your heart stop hurting  
Falling in love, caught up with me at last  
  
Always knew it would, never had it so good  
Now my time's arrived, and I'm glad I'm alive  
I feel like a love today, and it won't fade away  
In my heart, I know it's right  
  
I was out there, all on my own  
And just a smile is all I was after  
And then you filled my world up with laughter  
What a wonderful life  
I never saw it so beautiful  
  
Oh-oh-wo-oh what a wonderful life  
  
Always knew it would, never had it so good  
Now my time's arrived, and I'm glad I'm alive  
I feel like a love today, and it won't fade away  
In my heart, I know it's right  
  
Always knew it would, never had it so good  
Now my time's arrived, and I'm glad I'm alive  
I feel like a love today, and it won't fade away  
In my heart, I know it's right
