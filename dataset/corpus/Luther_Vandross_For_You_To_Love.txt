It's the middle of the night  
And I can't sleep at all, I'm so uptight  
Tossin' and turnin' is how I've spent the time  
I've got so much on my mind hey  
  
Something's got a hold on me  
I think it's love, don't you agree?  
It's got to be, I don't feel better  
I know what I've got to do  
I've got to get next to you  
  
So I came here  
(For you to love)  
In the pouring rain  
(For you to love)  
And I know I'm ready  
(For you to love)  
I'll be the best I can  
(Honey, for you to love)  
Cause honey it's you I love  
Love, love yeah  
  
I start to wonder what is true?  
And I get so confused  
(What should I do?)  
You make me worry  
When you say you understand  
But that I can't be your man  
  
Something's gotta change your mind  
Now, if I get my love to you in time  
(Then you'll be mine)  
Ooh, I've got to get over  
Yes, that's what I've gotta do  
Look out 'cause I'm after you  
  
I came here  
(For you to love)  
In a hurricane  
(For you to love)  
Just to be ready  
(For you to love)  
I'll be the kind of man  
(Honey, for you to love)  
Cause honey it's you I love  
Love love love yeah  
Cause honey it's you I love yeah  
  
I wanted to see you  
I wanted to make your day  
I got myself ready  
To hear the words you would say  
Cause sometimes you talk to me so emotionally  
But then, you pull it back, baby  
Just let yourself love me  
  
I came here  
(For you to love)  
I took a train, my dear  
(For you to love)  
So, you know I'm ready  
(For you to love)  
I never doubt, never fear  
(Honey, for you to love)  
Cause oh honey it's you I love  
Cause oh honey it's you I love  
Love, love, yeah  
  
For you to love  
For you to love  
For you to love
