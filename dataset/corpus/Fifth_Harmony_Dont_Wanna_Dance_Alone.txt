Calling all the girls  
There's an SOS tonight, let's have some fun, yeah  
One hundred percent  
Every single chase somehow these days are gone, yeah  
  
There's gotta be a million faces up in this room, room  
But the only one who gets my attention is you, you  
  
I got my best on and I feel like dancing all night long  
Nothing's gonna stop me oh but I want  
So baby come and get me, cause I don't wanna dance alone  
  
Oh it's been so long  
Thinking 'bout the feeling of your arms wrapped around my body  
It's what I want  
So baby come and get me, cause I don't wanna dance alone  
  
Out on the floor  
I can feel you staring at me across the room, ooh  
Whatcha waiting for  
All I want is you so come and make a move, oh  
  
I see a million silver lights up in this room, ooh  
I wanna be the one who gets the attention from you, oh  
  
I got my best on and I feel like dancing all night long  
Nothing's gonna stop me  
Oh but I want  
So baby come and get me, cause I don't wanna dance alone  
  
Oh it's been so long  
Thinking 'bout the feeling of your arms wrapped around my body  
It's what I want  
So baby come and get me, cause I don't wanna dance alone  
  
If you come in close  
Then I won't say no  
Baby all I want is you  
If you move too slow  
Then you'll never know  
All the things that we could do  
  
If you come in close  
Then I won't say no  
Baby all I want is you  
If you move too slow  
Then you'll never know  
All the things that we could do  
  
I got my best on and I feel like dancing all night long  
Nothing's gonna stop me  
Oh but I want  
So baby come and get me, cause I don't wanna dance alone  
  
Oh it's been so long  
Thinking 'bout the feeling of your arms wrapped around my body  
It's what I want  
So baby come and get me, cause I don't wanna dance alone  
  
Don't let me dance alone  
I don't wanna dance alone
