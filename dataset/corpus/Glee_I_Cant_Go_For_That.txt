What I want, you've got  
It might be hard to handle  
Like the flame that burns the candle  
The candle feeds the flame (eh eh)  
  
What I've got is a full stock  
Of thoughts and dreams that scatter  
You pull them all together  
And how I can't explain oh yeah  
  
Well well you (I can't go for that)  
You make my dreams come true  
(I can't go for that, I can't go for that)  
Well well well you  
(I can't go for that)  
Oh yeah you make my dreams come true  
(I can't go for that, I can't go for that)  
  
On a night when bad dreams become a screamer  
When they're messin' with a dreamer  
I can laugh it in the face  
Twist and shout my way out  
And wrap yourself around me  
'Cause I ain't the way you found me  
And I'll never be the same oh yeah  
  
Well 'cause you (I can't go for that)  
You make my dreams come true  
(I can't go for that, I can't go for that)  
Well well well you  
(I can't go for that)  
Oh yeah you make my dreams come true  
(I can't go for that, I can't go for that)  
  
Oh listen to this  
  
Oh...  
I'm down on my daydream  
But that sleepwalk should be over by now  
I know  
  
Yeah, you  
I, I'll do anything that you want me to  
I, I'll do almost anything  
You make my dreams come true  
I, I'll do anything (oh yeah) that you want me to  
I, I'll do almost anything  
You make my dreams come true  
(I can't go for that)  
You make my dreams come true  
(I can't go for that, I can't go for that)  
  
You make my dreams come true  
(I can't go for that, I can't go for that)  
You make my dreams come true
