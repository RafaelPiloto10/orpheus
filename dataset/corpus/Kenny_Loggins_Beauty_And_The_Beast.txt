Tale as old as time  
True as it can be  
Barely even friends  
Then somebody bends  
Unexpectedly  
  
Just a little change  
Small to say the least  
Both a little scared  
Neither one prepared  
Beauty and the Beast  
  
Ever just the same  
Ever a suprise  
Ever just as sure  
Ever as before  
As the sun will rise  
  
Certain as the sun  
Rising in the east  
Tale as old as time  
Song as old as ryhme  
Beauty and the Beast
