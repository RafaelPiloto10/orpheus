I hear him,  
Before I go to sleep,  
And focus on the day that's been,  
I realize he's there,  
When I turn the light off,  
And turn over,  
Nobody knows about my man,  
They think he's lost on some horizon,  
And suddenly I find myself listening,  
To a man I've never known before,  
Telling me about the sea,  
Oh his love is to eternity.  
  
Oh he's here again,  
The man with the child in his eyes,  
Oh he's here again,  
The man with the child in his eyes  
  
He's very understanding and he's so,  
Aware of all my situations,  
When I stay up late,  
He's always with me,  
What I feel when I hesitate,  
Oh I'm so worried about my love,  
They say "No, No it won't last forever",  
And here I am again my girl,  
Wondering what on earth I am doing here,  
Maybe he doesn't love me,  
I just took a trip on my love for him.  
  
Oh he's here again,  
The man with the child in his eyes,  
Oh he's here again,  
The man with the child in his eyes
