And can't nobody, ever tell you no ([All] No, No)  
Don't need no filters on pictures before you post them on the gram

You'd be rich if looking good was your profession  
Think I'm love, cause you're so sexy  
Boy, I ain't talking about you, I'm talking to my own reflection  
I'm talking to my own reflection, I'm talking to my own reflection  
Boy, I ain't talking about you, I'm talking to my own reflection  
I'm talking to my own reflection, I'm talking to my own reflection  
Boy, I ain't talking about you, I'm talking to my own reflection  
  
[Camila]  
Why'd you think I'm putting on my favorite perfume?  
Why'd you think this dress so tight and I can barely move?  
Why'd you think I'm dancing in these uncomfortable shoes?  
I did it all, I did it all, I did it all for you!  
  
[Lauren]  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Don't you ever get it confused  
No, no, oh, oh, oh, oh  
It ain't bragging if you know it's true  
  
[Normani]  
Ooh where you from?  
Must be heaven  
You'd be rich if looking good was your profession  
Think I'm love, cause you're so sexy  
Boy, I ain't talking about you, I'm talking to my own reflection  
I'm talking to my own reflection, I'm talking to my own reflection  
Boy, I ain't talking about you, I'm talking to my own reflection
