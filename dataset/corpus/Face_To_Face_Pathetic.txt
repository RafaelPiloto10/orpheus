It feels like there's nothing I can do  
It feels like there's nothing left to do  
Always feels like I must  
Wait  
Just a while  
Because "anything worth having is worth the wait"  
So it seems  
That this waiting's left us somewhere in-between  
It feels like there's nothing I can do  
It feels like there's nothing left to do  
Blind ambition is overrated  
Apathetic bored and jaded now  
You forget something  
I wanted to be left alone
