I can't raise my glass, without seeing her ass  
Through it's telescopic bottom  
  
I can't raise my glass, without seeing her ass  
Through it's telescopic bottom  
  
If you wanna know what agony is  
Ask the girl at the bottom of my glass  
  
Well love'll come a-knockin' with my toolbag and my stockin'  
Challeng-challengin' her knickers  
  
Well love'll come a-knockin' with my toolbag and my stockin'  
With my bag a-challenging her knickers  
  
If you wanna know what's shakin' down the house  
Ask the girl at the bottom of my glass  
  
I can spill my drink from the woman at the sink,  
Coming at my lap with rum and bitters  
  
Slop my drink, without that woman at the sink,  
I'll grab my back with the rag and mittens  
  
If you're looking for that woman at the house  
Ask the girl at the bottom of my glass  
All right!  
  
I cannot raise my drink, without stopping to think  
That some bad baby's givin' me trouble  
  
I cannot raise my drink, without stopping to think  
That some bad baby's givin' me trouble  
  
If you wanna see what's inside of Sally  
You'll find that doll in a hole out in the alley,  
Yeah  
  
I cannot raise my glass, without seeing her ass  
That booze is a-turning bitter  
  
I cannot raise my glass, without seeing her ass  
'cause you got no more than bitter  
  
If you know a little bit about my past  
Take my switch at the bitch in my house
