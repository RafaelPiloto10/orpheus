Style of your hair  
Shape of your eyes and your nose  
The way you stare,  
As if you see, right through to my soul  
  
Its your left hand and the way  
That its not quite as big as your right  
The way you stand in the mirror,  
Before we go out at night  
  
A quiet time, your beautiful mind,  
They're a part of the list  
Things that I miss,  
Things like your, funny little laugh  
Or the way you smile or the way we kiss  
  
What I noticed is this,  
I come up with  
Something new, every single time  
That I sit an reminisce  
  
The way you sweet smell  
Lingers when you leave a room (you leave a room)  
Stories you tell as we lay  
In bed all afternoon (all afternoon)  
  
I dreamed you now every night  
In my mind is where we meet (in my mind is where we meet)  
And when I'm awake  
Staring at pictures of you asleep  
  
And touching your face, invading your space  
They're a part of the list  
Things that I miss,  
Things like your, funny little laugh  
Or the way you smile or the way we kiss  
  
What I noticed is this  
I come up with  
Something new, every single time  
That I sit an reminisce  
  
And you'll live in my  
Memories, forever more I swear  
  
And you'll live in my  
Memories, forever more I swear  
  
They're a part of the list  
Things that I miss  
Things like your, funny little laugh  
The way you smile or the way we kiss  
  
What I noticed is this  
I come up with  
Something new, every single time  
That I sit an reminisce
