Feeling out of place  
Something must be wrong  
Emotions in my space  
Tight grip holding on  
  
I can't control the events around me  
I can't console the stress inside me  
And once I turn off my brain  
I realize, I am alive  
  
I want you to see  
I'm trying to please  
Everyone around me  
I'm down on my knees  
The stress makes me bleed  
It feels like they're all stabbing me  
  
Feeling out of place  
Why must I hold on  
Anger I can taste  
Tight lipped self is gone  
  
I can't control the events around me  
I can't console the stress around me  
And once I turn off my brain  
I realize I am alive  
  
I want you to see  
I'm trying to please  
Everyone around me  
I'm down on my knees  
The stress makes me bleed  
It feels like they're all stabbing me  
  
What the fuck do you want from me  
I am just a human being  
Living my life to please everyone  
I can't do this anymore  
Being everybody's whore  
Being everybody's whore  
Being everybody's whore  
Being everybody's whore  
Being everybody's whore  
  
For once, I'm gonna stand up and ask what  
  
I want you to see  
I'm trying to please  
Everyone around me  
I'm down on my knees  
The stress makes me bleed  
It feels like they're all stabbing me  
  
Being everybody's whore  
Being everybody's whore  
Being everybody's whore
