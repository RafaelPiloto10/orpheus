Them bitches got work  
Them bitches wanna trip  
Them bitches gettin' murked  
And stick em in tha dirt  
And gone 'bout our business  
And it ain't nothin' personal  
It's all bout tha figures  
It's M.O.E. till a bitch a dead  
And I don't give a fuck about what a bitch said  
I'm still gettin' money I'm still gettin' rich  
I'm still that woman that will take your dick  
Yeah, tha truth hurts, you still gotta face it  
I spent ya whole deal on my ring and my bracelet

And let the choppers chop  
Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop
