Ooh ooh ooh ee-ooh ooh ooh  
Ah ah ah ah ah ah-ooh ooh  
Ooh  
  
I'm always thinkin' 'bout it  
I don't know what I'd do without it  
I love, I really love  
My pancreas  
  
My spleen just doesn't matter  
Don't really care about my bladder  
But I don't leave home without  
My pancreas  
  
My pancreas is always  
There for me  
Ah-ooh  
  
Secreting those enzymes (bap bap bap)  
Secreting those hormones too  
Metabolizing carbohydrates  
Just for me  
  
Ba-ba ba ba-ba ba ba ba-ba ba ba  
My pancreas  
Ba-ba ba ba-ba ba ba ba-ba ba  
My pancreas  
Ba-ba ba ba-ba ba ba ba-ba ba ba  
My pancreas  
Ba-ba ba ba-ba ba ba ba-ba ba  
My pancreas  
  
Ba-ba ba ba-ba ba ba ba-ba ba ba  
My pancreas  
Ba-ba ba ba-ba ba ba ba-ba ba  
My pancreas  
Ooh  
  
My pancreas attracts every other  
Pancreas in the universe  
With a force proportional  
To the product of their masses  
And inversely proportional  
To the distance between them  
  
Woo woo woo woo  
  
Don'tcha you know you gotta  
Flow, flow, flow, pancreatic juice  
Flow, flow, into the duodenum  
  
Won'tcha  
Flow, flow, flow, pancreatic juice  
Flow, flow, into the duodenum  
  
Insulin, glucagon  
(Won'tcha flow, flow, flow, pancreatic juice)  
Comin' from the islets of Langerhans  
(Flow flow, into the deuodenum)  
  
Insulin, glucagon  
(Won'tcha flow flow flow, pancreatic juice)  
Comin' from the islets of Langerhans  
(Flow flow, into the deuodenum)  
  
Lipase, amylase, and trip sin  
(Insulin, glucagon)  
(Won'tcha flow, flow flow, pancreatic juice)  
They gonna help with our digestion
