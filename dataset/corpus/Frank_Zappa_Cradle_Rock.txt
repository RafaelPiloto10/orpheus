Rock a bye, Baby,  
On the tree-top.  
When the wind blows,  
The cradle will rock.  
When the bow breaks,  
The cradle will fall.  
So down, down, down, down...  
Down will come Baby,  
Cradle and all.  
  
I gave you my kisses  
Right from the start.  
I gave you my true love,  
For I wasn't smart.  
But you took advantage  
And broke my heart.  
An' down, down, down, down...  
Down went my soul  
An' you threw away my heart.  
  
Don't make me cry for you.  
Don't make me die for you.  
I never thought it'd be like this.  
But in the end you see,  
You took the best of me.  
So down with all...  
Down came my heart.  
  
You learned to love me  
Much too late.  
Offered me kisses  
I wouldn't take.  
When the wind blew,  
You saw me fall.  
So down, down, down, down  
Down will come Baby,  
Cradle and all.
