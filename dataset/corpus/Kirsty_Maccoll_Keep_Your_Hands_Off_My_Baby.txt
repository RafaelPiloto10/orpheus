We've been friends for oh so long  
I let you share what's mine  
But when it comes to the boy I love  
It's time to draw the line  
  
Keep your hands off my baby  
I ain't gonna tell you not one more time  
Keep your hands off my baby  
Will you get it through your head  
That boy is mine  
  
I don't mind lending you my clothes  
My jewelry and such  
But honey let's get something straight  
There's one thing you don't touch  
  
Keep your hands off my baby  
I ain't gonna tell you not one more time  
Keep your hands off my baby  
Will you get it through your head  
That boy is mine  
  
Keep your hands off my baby  
I ain't gonna tell you not one more time  
Keep your hands off my baby  
Will you get it through your head  
That boy is mine  
  
Keep your hands off my baby  
That boy is mine
