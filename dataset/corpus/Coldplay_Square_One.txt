You're in control  
Is there anywhere you want to go?  
You're in control  
Is there anything you want to know?  
The future's for discovering  
The space in which we're traveling  
  
From the top of the first page  
To the end of the last day  
From the start in your own way  
You just want somebody listening to what you say  
It doesn't matter who you are  
It doesn't matter who you are  
  
Under the surface trying to break through  
Deciphering the codes in you  
I need a compass, draw me a map  
I'm on the top, I can't get back  
  
Whoa whoa  
  
The first line on the first page  
To the end of the last page  
From the start in your own way  
You just want somebody listening to what you say  
It doesn't matter who you are  
It doesn't matter who you are  
  
You just want  
Somebody listening to what you say  
Oh, you just want somebody listening to what you say  
It doesn't matter who you are  
It doesn't matter who you are  
  
Is there anybody out there who  
Is lost and hurt and lonely too  
Are they bleeding all your colors into one?  
And if you come undone  
As if you've been run through  
Some catapult it fired you  
You wonder if your chance will ever come  
Or if you're stuck in square one
