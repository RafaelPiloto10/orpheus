Flowers have blooms  
The ocean has waves  
The sky has clouds  
People have babes  
I want to live  
Till I get old  
I want to watch all of this grow  
I want to live, live and let live  
I want all the love this life has to give  
I want to smile and be friendly with you  
I want to live and let you live some too  
  
Rover is big, Tabby is small  
Betty is short, Jimmy is tall  
They want to live, live and let live  
They want all the love this life has to give  
They want to smile and be friendly with you  
They want to live and let you live some too  
We want to live, but don't you
