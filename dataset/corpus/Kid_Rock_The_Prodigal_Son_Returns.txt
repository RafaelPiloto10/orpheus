P-P-P pass the boota, pass the boota  
Cause I wanna get, P-P-P pass the boota  
P-P-P pass the boota, cause I wanna get off  
All the fuckers that are tryin to this the Kid Rock  
When it comes to rhyms I got a new Caddy  
You can get shot, but first I'm gonna get hot  
Cause you got about as much flavor as a fuckin rice patty  
It lights the way ahh  
Babe, ahh don't quit your day job  
But on the mic I'm God  
And workin hard for your moneys what I x'ed hoe  
Cause I wont sell my soul for some wax dipped in cheap gold  
Par 4 motherfucker whatcha gonna do  
1 wood 7 iron and I'm on the green at 2  
With 1 putt I lyin a birdy in the hole  
So give it up hoe  
I drive the show putt for dough  
I get a lot of funny looks  
I aint to fuckin crook  
I aint stealin your music, my man  
Your playin dummy with your pride  
And all that jive your preachin, it's borin  
And you can't tell me shit about a funny vibe  
God saved my soul, you save the fuckin rain forest  
And i'll meet you in hell  
The prodigal son Kid Rock I rock well  
(only time will tell)  
Well it's been coast from the midway  
And at first glance you wouldn't guess no  
I even make my own homemade wine  
Smokin grass and sniffin lines  
Moonshine, Red wine, stir it up, drink it up  
Cut it up, light it up, sniff it up, rock it up  
Roll it up, light it up, toke down, pass around  
Gimme a pipe and I just might smoke it  
Object it, sellect it, clean it, protect it  
Suck it in, tie it up, stick it and inject it  
All night, that's right, pop it drop it  
Set it on your tongue and then trip til you peak
