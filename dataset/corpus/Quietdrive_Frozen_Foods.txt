I met her last night  
I saw her move  
She took my eye  
I had to prove  
That I was cool and she was hot  
I'll tell you what she wore but I forgot  
I had the guts to walk her way  
She didn't move  
I didn't stray  
I have one chance and this is it  
But then I fell right on her left tit  
  
I'm just a kid on a branch  
I wish you'd come up and dance  
I want a little romance  
Could you please give me a chance  
I'm probably last on the list  
But all I want is this wish to come true  
If it's you then I'll be down for that, too  
  
I saw her next week  
In frozen foods  
I sized her up  
She had the goods  
I tried to walk by with cool reserve  
She probably thinks that I'm a perv  
And as I rode by in my squeaky cart  
It occurred to me the supermart  
Is not the best place to get a date  
Maybe at the roller-rink is where I'll find my soul mate  
  
I'm just a kid on a branch  
I wish you'd come up and dance  
I want a little romance  
Could you please give me a chance  
I'm probably last on the list  
But all I want is this wish to come true  
If it's you then I'll be down for that, too  
  
It's ok cause Counselor Troy tells me  
That my self-esteem is high  
He held me close and tried to tell me  
That I'm not like the other guys  
You're special, I like you  
Counselor Troy is like me, too  
Maybe that's why I couldn't get the girls I've wanted to  
  
I'm just a kid on a branch  
You should come up and dance  
I want a little romance  
Will you please give me a chance  
I'm just a kid on a branch  
I wish you'd come up and dance  
I want a little romance  
Will you please give me a chance  
I'm just a kid on a branch  
I'm just a kid on a branch  
I want a little romance  
I want a little romance  
I'm probably last on the list  
I'm probably last on the list  
Come true  
If it's you  
And I'll be down for that, too
