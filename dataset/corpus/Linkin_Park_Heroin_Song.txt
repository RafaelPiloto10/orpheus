When you look into my eyes there's nothing else to see  
Nothing but your own mistake stearing back at you  
  
I was best student in a class  
Now all giving me ass  
I just cannot hide sense of guilty  
But I will follow my illness  
To the possible lines  
I'll choose right decision  
And show to world that I am not guilty by association  
  
Go away you  
Go away you  
Go away you  
  
Just like a heroin I'm falling apart  
Breaking my heart my angel left me!  
  
I'm too week to face me  
I never know why she only run so far away, far away from me  
I never know why she always runs so far away, far away  
  
Far away you  
Far away you  
Far away you  
  
Now you see Heroin is the reason, reason, reason...  
I can't tell you how to make it go  
Now matter how I do how hard I try  
I shouted the outside!  
  
Fear, scary  
Fear, scary  
Fear, scary
