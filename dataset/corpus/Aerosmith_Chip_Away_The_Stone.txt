You act like a prima donna,  
Playing so hard to get.  
Sittin' so cool and nonchalant,  
Draggin' on a cigarette.  
You keep a wall all around ya.  
I'll get through some day.  
I want your love, baby,  
Push, don't shove  
Gonna chip that stone away.  
  
Chip away,  
Chip away at the stone.  
I won't stop until your love is my very own.  
Chip away,  
That's what I'm gonna do.  
Sweet little mama,  
I wanna get next to you.  
  
You stand like a marble statue,  
Trying to look so hard.  
All decked out in your antique dress,  
While the boys all promenade.  
Even a rock will crumble,  
If you strike it night and day.  
If hammer I must, I'm gonna get through your crust.  
Gonna chip that stone away.  
  
Chip away,  
Chip away at the stone.  
I won't stop until your love is my very own.  
Chip away,  
That's what I'm gonna do.  
Sweet little mama,  
I wanna get next to you.  
  
Chip away,  
Chip away at the stone.  
Honey, I won't stop until your love is my very own.  
Chip away,  
That's what I'm wanna do.  
Sweet little mama,  
I wanna get next to you.  
  
Yes I do, yes I do.  
  
Chip away, chip away, at the stone.  
Chip away, chip away, at the stone.  
  
I won't stop.  
I won't stop.  
I won't stop.  
I won't stop.  
I won't stop.  
I won't stop.  
  
Chip it.  
I'm gonna nip it, all night long.
