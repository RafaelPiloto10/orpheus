By the time I get to Phoenix she'll be rising  
She'll find the note I left hangin' on her door  
She'll laugh when she reads the part that says I'm leavin'  
'Cause I've left that girl so many times before.  
  
By the time I make Albuquerque she'll be working  
She'll probably stop at lunch and give me a call  
But she'll just hear that phone keep on ringin'  
Off the wall, that's all.  
  
By the time I make Oklahoma she'll be sleepin'  
She'll turn softly and call my name out low  
And she'll cry just to think I'd really leave her  
Tho' time and time I try to tell her so  
She just didn't know I would really go.
