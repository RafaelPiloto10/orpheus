I was sure that you'd love me  
To that hope, I did cling  
'Cause I'm... Richard the third  
And... Everybody loves a king!  
  
Thought I did a good job  
Why do you disagree?  
There's a lot of people  
Spreading nasty rumors 'bout me  
Every word is a lie  
So I'm singing this song  
'Cause the history books  
Have been telling it wrong!  
  
I Never had a limp  
Always walked my full height  
Never had a hump  
And my arm was all right  
Never took the crown  
With the ilegal power  
Never killed my nephews  
The princes in the tower  
Tudor propaganda  
It's all absurd  
Time to tell the truth  
'Bout King Richard the third  
  
My brother Edward, died  
His kids too young to rule  
So... I took the throne  
Why not? I'm nobody's fool!  
  
Thomas More wrote a history  
Said I'd murdered Edward's boys  
Shakespeare said their death  
Was an evil ploy  
But I say those two  
Are historical vandals!  
They've ruined my image!  
I mean, what a scandal!  
  
Never bumped off  
Those harmless young heirs  
Never buried them  
Under the Tower of London stairs  
Never poisoned my wife  
Bumped off her daddy  
This is me, sweet Richard  
Do I look like a baddy?  
Never was two-faced  
Sure you'll agree  
I was misunderstood  
King Richard three  
  
Can you imagine it?  
I'm the last Plantagenet  
Beaten by Henry  
In the Wars of the Roses  
The Tudor dynasty  
Didn't care that much for me  
Now I'm painted as a baddy  
That's why one supposes... (continues while next verse is sang)  
  
Never forget  
When you hear of my crimes  
Never drowned my brother  
In a massive vat of wine  
Never said 'a horse!  
My kingdom for a horse! '  
Who made that up?  
Why, William Shakespeare, of course!  
  
Now my tale is told  
You won't hear a bad word  
About a special ruler  
King Richard the third  
Arg it's a wasp it's a wasp
