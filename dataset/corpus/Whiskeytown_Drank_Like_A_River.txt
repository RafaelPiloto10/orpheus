Well he was nearly died  
When he returned to the town where he'd come from  
He's brown-bagging it tonight behind some tavern  
Somebody wrecked his life  
And I'll bet you it was his darling  
Somebody wrecked his life  
And I'll bet you it was his darling  
So he drank like a river when the wedding bells rang  
Watched from the steeple as the choir girls sang  
Died in the gutter on his feet and his hands  
Same hands that once touched her face  
Well he was nearly died  
When he returned to the town he'd come from  
He's hanging out drinking beer with his brother-in-law  
He was a drinker at night  
And in the morning he was unnerving  
He was a drinker for a time  
The day that he lost his darling  
So he drank like a river when the wedding bells rang  
Watched from the steeple as the choir girls sang  
Died in the gutter on his feet and his hands  
Same hands that once touched her face  
So he drank like a river when the wedding bells rang  
Watched from the steeple as the choir girls sang  
Died in the gutter on his feet and his hands  
Same hands that once touched her face
