You can't live together, you can't live alone  
Considering the weather, oh my how you've grown  
From the men in the factories to the wild kangaroo  
Like those birds of a feather, they're gathering together  
And feeling exactly like you  
They got mesmerized by lullabies and limbo danced in Pairs  
Please lock that door, it don't make much sense  
That common sense, don't make no sense no more  
Just between you and me, it's like pulling  
When you ought to be shoving  
Like a nun with her head in the oven  
Please don't tell me that this really wasn't nothing  
One of these days, one of these nights  
You'll take off your hat and they'll read you, your rights  
You'll wanna get high every time you feel low  
Hey, Queen Isabella stay away from that fella  
He'll just get you into trouble, you know?  
But they came here by boat and they came here by plane  
They blistered their hands and they burned out their brain  
All dreaming a dream, that'll never come true  
Hey, don't give me no trouble, or I'll call up my double  
We'll play piggy-in-the-middle with you  
You'll get mesmerized by alibis and limbo dance in Pairs  
Please lock that door, it don't make much sense  
That common sense, don't make no sense no more  
It don't make much sense, that common sense  
Don't make no sense no more
