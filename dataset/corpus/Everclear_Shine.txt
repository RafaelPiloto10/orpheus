Shine  
Open up your life and shine your light  
Shine  
Open up and show the freak inside  
  
Words don't mean nothing  
His words don't mean nothing  
He has no shame  
He will say anything  
Just to get what he needs  
  
He says he needs  
The right girl  
To heal his hurt  
And change his world  
He will say anything  
To make her think  
He is the man  
She wants him to be  
  
Shine  
Open up your life and shine your light  
Shine  
Open up and show the freak inside  
  
The girl had a good plan  
To find herself a good man  
The kind of guy that you hear about  
But you never seem to meet  
  
She hides  
Behind those bright eyes  
Fake smiles and sex  
And white lies  
  
Yeah  
She is  
Trying too hard  
To be the way  
That she thinks  
She's supposed to be

Let me see you  
Open up and shine your light  
Open up and show the world  
The freak inside  
  
You are afraid to shine  
To see what's deep inside  
Go find your freak and let it drive  
  
You are afraid to shine  
To see what's deep inside  
Go find your freak and let it glide  
  
You sing the same old song  
Been in the dark too long  
There is so much more than meets the eye  
  
Don't be afraid to shine  
Go find out who you are inside  
Just go and find your freak and let it fly  
  
Let me see you

The freak inside
