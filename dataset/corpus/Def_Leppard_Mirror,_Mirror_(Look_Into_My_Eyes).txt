Mirror mirror  
Just watchin' with your eye of glass  
You're just a fortune wheel  
With something that I want to ask  
  
Mirror mirror  
Got my fate lyin' in your hands  
You're the fool, you're the juggler  
Hangman and lover, you're not like no other  
  
Take a look into my eyes  
Tell me what you see  
Take a look into my eyes  
Tell me is it true?  
Take a look into my eyes  
Oh when I look at you  
Take a look into my eyes  
Tell me is it me?  
Is it really me?  
  
Mirror mirror  
Gotta know just what you see  
My crystal ball  
You're lookin' so sly and so sleazy  
  
Mirror mirror  
Hangin' there with that crack in your eye  
You make me stumble, make me blind  
Time after time and line by line  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mirror mirror  
Oh tell me  
You're the fool, you're the juggler  
I ain't met a lover, you're like no other  
  
Take a look into my eyes  
Tell me what you see  
Take a look into my eyes  
Tell me is it true?  
Take a look into my eyes  
Oh it just can't last  
Take a look into my eyes  
Gonna have to smash the glass  
  
Take a look into my eyes  
Take a look into my eyes  
Take a look  
Take a look into my eyes  
Oh yeah  
Take a look into my eyes  
Take a look into my eyes  
Take a look into my eyes  
Take a look into my eyes  
Take a look  
Take a look into my eyes  
Look into my eyes  
Take a look into my eyes  
Tell me if it's me  
Baby, baby, baby, baby  
Baby, baby, baby, baby
