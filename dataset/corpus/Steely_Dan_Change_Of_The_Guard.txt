If you listen you can hear it  
It's the laughter in the street  
It's the motion in the music  
And the fire beneath your feet  
All the signs are right this time  
You don't have to try so very hard  
If you live in this world  
You're feelin' the change of the guard  
  
All the cowboys and your neighbors  
Can you swallow up your pride  
Take your guns off it you're willin'  
And you know we're on your side  
If you want to get through the years  
It's high time you played your card  
If you live in this world  
You're feelin' the change of the guard
