I can learn to live alone and move on with my life  
There's a million things that I can do to occupy my time  
I can wake each morning, I can go about my day  
I can fumble through my words until I find a few to say  
  
But the hardest thing I've had to do since we've been apart  
Is learning how to deal with all this pain inside my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause I don't know how  
don't know how  
don't know how, not to Love you  
I don't know how  
don't know how  
don't know how, not to Love you  
  
I can work all day, or I can hang out every night  
I can do the wrong things and pretend that they're allright  
I can make believe that everything is cool  
And put on the face that covers up the lies of a fool  
  
[Chorus]  
But I don't know how  
don't know how  
don't know how not to Love you  
I don't know how  
don't know how  
don't know how, not to Love you  
  
You said that time would ease the pain  
But I still hear your voice whisper my name  
Since you've been gone my world stands still  
You said I'd forget, but I never will  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't know how  
don't know how  
don't know how, not to Love you  
I don't know how  
  
don't know how  
don't know how, not to Love you  
I can write a song and make the whole world laugh and cry  
I can use some words to paint a vivid picture in your mind  
  
I can use my hands to wipe the dust off this guitar  
And let this music that I'm playing take the mind off my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
But I don't know how  
don't know how  
don't know how, not to Love you  
I don't know how  
don't know how  
don't know how, not to Love you  
  
[Bridge]  
  
You said that time would ease the pain  
But I still hear your voice whisper my name  
Since you've been gone my world stands still  
You said I'd forget, but I never will  
(Chorus Repeated 2x)  
I don't know how  
don't know how  
don't know how, not to Love you  
I don't know how  
don't know how  
don't know how, not to Love you  
I don't know how  
don't know how  
don't know how, not to Love you  
I don't know how  
don't know how  
don't know how, not to Love you
