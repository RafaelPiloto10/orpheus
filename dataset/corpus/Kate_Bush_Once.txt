Earth for all creatures  
A thought for all (wo)men  
Right for the speechless  
Wrong until then?  
  
Eyes for the laughter  
Thirst for the tongue  
Hands for together  
Ears for the song  
  
The song of love  
We sing in silence  
Every moment long  
  
Once  
Here to be done as we do  
With only one chance  
Here for the wonder of under the stars  
For the one and only  
Once  
  
Joy for the children  
Hope for the chance  
Men for the women  
Now for the dance  
  
The dance of love  
We dance just once  
In unique circumstance  
  
Once  
Here to be done as we do  
With only one chance  
Here for the wonder of under the stars  
For the one and only once
