I believe for every drop of rain that falls a flower grows  
I believe that somewhere in the darkest night a candle glows  
And I believe for every one who goes astray someone will come to show the way  
I believe yes I believe  
  
I believe above the storm the smallest prayer will still be heard  
I believe that someone in the great somewhere hears every word  
Every time I hear a new born baby cry or touch a leaf or see the sky  
Then I know why I believe  
  
I believe above the storm...  
I believe yes I believe
