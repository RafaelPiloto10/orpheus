Take a deep breath  
'Cause it all starts now  
When you pull the fuckin' pin  
The shrapnel burns  
As it tears into the skin  
Every wonder what it takes  
To be questioning your faith  
This is what it's like  
When it happens every Goddamn day  
  
Violence is our way of life  
  
Shards of life  
Like confetti in the air  
The flesh storm grows  
As it breeds despair  
You hear screams in the distance  
Fighting the resistance  
Not cries of war  
These are just the sounds of pain  
  
It's all just psychotic devotion  
Manipulated with no discretion  
Relentless War  
  
Killing's in style  
And it's not the main event  
The cameras are whores  
For the daily bloodshed  
Like a junkie  
Hungry for a fix of anything  
The media devours  
And feasts upon the inhumane  
  
Violence is our way of life  
  
It's all too fuckin' clear  
We can never coincide  
So let's all drink  
To genocide  
All the venomous sights  
Border on the arcane  
In times of war  
Everything is bound by pain  
  
It's all just psychotic devotion  
Manipulated with no discretion  
Relentless  
Warfare knows no compassion  
Thrives with no evolution  
Unstable minds exacerbate  
Unrest in peace  
  
There's no future  
The world is dead  
So save the last  
Bullet for your head  
  
Only fallen have won  
Because the fallen can't run  
My vision's not obscure  
For war there is no cure  
So here the only law  
Is men killing men  
For someone else's cause  
  
It's all just psychotic devotion  
Manipulated with no discretion  
Relentless War
