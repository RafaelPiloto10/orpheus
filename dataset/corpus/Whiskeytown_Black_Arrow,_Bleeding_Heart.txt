Throwing rocks at a window  
Stumble into a telephone pole  
While the light shines down on your person  
Filtering through all your aversions  
  
Love will not find you tonight  
When you're preaching love, thinking love  
Holding back  
What were you thinking  
When black arrows  
Shot at your bleeding heart?  
  
Looking into the mirror  
Don't like what I see  
Ain't looking like me  
I want to be near her  
There's no way in hell  
And there's no time to tell  
  
Love will not find you tonight  
When you're preaching love, thinking love  
Holding back  
What were you thinking  
When black arrows  
Shot at your bleeding heart?
