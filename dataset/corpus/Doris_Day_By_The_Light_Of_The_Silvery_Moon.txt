By the light of the silvery moon  
I want to spoon  
To my honey I'll croon love's tune  
Honey moon, keep a-shinin' in June  
Your silvery beams will bring love's dreams  
We'll be cuddlin' soon  
By the silvery moon  
  
Place - park, scene - dark  
Silvery moon is shining through the trees  
Cast - two, me - you  
Summer kisses floating on the breeze  
Act one, be done  
Dialog - where would ya like to spoon?  
My cue, with you  
Underneath the silvery moon  
  
By the light of the silvery moon  
I want to spoon  
To my honey I'll croon love's tune  
Honey moon, keep a-shinin' in June  
Your silvery beams will bring love's dreams  
We'll be cuddlin' soon by the silvery moon  
  
Act two, Scene - new  
Roses blooming all around the place  
Cast - three, You - me  
Preacher with a solemn-looking face  
Choir sings, bell rings  
Preacher: You are wed forever more  
Act two, all though  
Every night the same encore  
  
By the light, not the dark but the light  
Of the silvery moon, not the sun but the moon  
I want to spoon, not croon, but spoon  
To my honey I'll croon love's tune  
Honeymoon, honey moon, honey moon  
Keep a-shinin' in June  
Your silvery beams will bring love's dreams  
We'll be cuddlin' soon  
By the silvery moon  
The silvery moon...
