Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
There's no need for us to rush it through  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
This is more than just a new lust for you  
  
Done saying, I'm done playing  
Last time was on the outro  
Stuck in the house, need to get out more  
I've been stacking up like I'm fundraising  
Most people in my position get complacent  
Come places with star girls, end up on them front pages  
I'm quiet but I just ride with it  
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it  
I'm the only one that's putting shots up  
And like a potluck, you need to come with it  
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summer time, I keep it 100  
Lot of girls in my time there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted  
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from
it  
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like "Is Bun coming?  
Fuck that, is any one coming 'fore I show up there and ain't no one there?"  
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there  
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out  
Talking to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now  
Talking to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out  
She tell me, "Take a deep breath, you're too worried about being the best out"  
  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
There's no need for us to rush it through  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
This is more than just a new lust for you  
  
Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods  
Money got my whole family going backwards  
No dinners, no holidays, no nothing  
There's issues at hand that we're not discussing  
Look, I did not sign up for this  
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list  
And now he's acting like, oh, well, this is life, I guess, "Nah, fuck that
shit  
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit"  
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear  
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here  
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself  
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit  
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round, started treating me
like I'm "him" now  
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now  
Shit got me feeling pinned down, pick the pen up and put the pen down  
Writing to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down  
  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
There's no need for us to rush it through  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
This is more than just a new lust for you  
  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
There's no need for us to rush it through  
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much  
This is more than just a new lust for you
