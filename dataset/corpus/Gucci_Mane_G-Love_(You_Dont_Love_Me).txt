[Chorus]  
And you want me to give you all of my heart  
All of my love  
But you don't love me (yeah!)  
And you keep on sayin' that's how you are  
But that ain't good enough  
Cause you don't love me (gucci!)  
And you want me to think that were gonna pass  
So I keep coming back (LeToya Luckett what's happenin')  
You say it might be  
But baby that ain't  
Gonna be good enough  
So there ain't no us  
Cause you don't love me  
  
I'm a zone six nigga so it ain't nothin' to it  
Yo man won't beat it up but guess what (i'll do it)  
Yo man won't beat it up but guess what (i'll do it)  
Yo man won't beat it up but guess what (i'll do it)  
Yo man won't beat it up but guess what (i'll do it)  
I'll beat that thing like I'm performin'  
Ya hate me now but you gon' love me in the mornin' (yeah)  
Flash flood warning I'm in the club stormin' (go go go go, stop!)  
Girls choosing shawty but I'll come and getcha toy friend  
High than a martian I'm round the wheel of fortune (its Gucci)  
You my vandal right and even rich hoes thank u gorgeous (well damn!)  
The way you put it down you remind me of my porsche (wow)  
And I'm not bein' arrogant I'm just tryin' being cautious (wow)  
I'm so scared of coming admit it make me nauseous  
I don't love ya girl but I still think ya gorgeous (yeah)  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
G love baby all I'll give ya  
Cause u don't fell in love  
With a real street nigga  
  
(Gucci!)  
  
[chorus]  
  
One day you gonna find me (go!)  
And I wanna regiment (go!)  
Find some other guy friend  
That meet all ya requirements (stop)  
I can even lie damn a dime you a diamond (bling)  
And if I laced up to ya you give it to hides man  
Rubbin' on ya thighs and I'm lookin' in ya eyes and  
It's hard to decide man love's so hard to find man  
Gucci not a blind man but Gucci still a bachelor  
Get me off a substance give him all the extra  
Gucci man I bless ya love to caress ya  
One thing I'll never do put you under pressure  
Gucci man done bless ya I love to caress ya  
One thing I would never do is put you under pressure  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
G love baby all I'll give ya  
Cause u don't fell in love  
With a real street nigga  
(say it again)  
(say it again)  
(Gucci!)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
G love baby all I'll give ya  
Cause u don't fell in love  
With a real street nigga  
  
(Gucci!)

Why ya don't love me  
Why ya don't love me  
Oh no!
