Better keep your distance from this whale  
Better keep your boat from going astray  
Find yourself a partner and treat them well  
Try to give them shelter night and day  
'cause here in this blue light  
Far away from the fireside  
Things can get twisted and crazy and crowded  
You can't even feel right  
So you dream of columbus  
Ever time the panic starts  
You dream of columbus  
With your maps and your beautiful charts  
You dream of columbus  
With an ache in your travelling heart  
See how the cormorant swoops and dives  
Must be some thrill to go that deep  
Down to the basement of this life  
Down to where the mermaid gently sleeps  
Not like here in this blue light  
Far away from the fireside  
Where things can get twisted and haunted and crowded  
You can't even feel alright  
Chorus  
And as tide must ebb and flow  
I am dragged down under  
And I wait the livelong day  
For an end to my hunger  
So I dream of columbus  
Every time that the panic starts  
I dream of columbus  
With my maps and my beautiful charts  
I dream of columbus  
And there's peace in a traveling heart  
I dream of columbus
