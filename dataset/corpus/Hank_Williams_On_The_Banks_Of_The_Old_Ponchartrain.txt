I [A] travelled from [A7] Texas to [D] old Louis-[A] anne  
Through valleys, o'er mountains and [E7] plains  
Both [A] footsore and [A7] weary I [D] rested a-[A] while  
On The [E7] Banks Of The Old Ponchar-[A] train.  
  
The fairest young maiden that I ever saw  
Passed by as it started to rain  
We both found a shelter beneath the same tree  
On The Banks Of The Old Ponchartrain.  
  
We hid from the shower an hour or so  
She asked me how long I'd remain  
I told her that I'd spend the rest of my days  
On The Banks Of The Old Ponchartrain.  
  
I just couldn't tell her that I ran away  
From jail on a West Texas plain  
I prayed in my heart I would never be found  
On The Banks Of The Old Ponchartrain.  
  
Then one day a man put his hand on my arm  
And said I must go west again  
I left her alone without saying goodbye  
On The Banks Of The Old Ponchartrain.  
  
Tonight as I sit here alone in my cell  
I know that she's waiting in vain  
I'm hoping and praying someday to return  
To The Banks Of The Old Ponchartrain.
