I went out in the darkness  
Just searching for someplace to be  
Wasn't looking for trouble  
I guess it was looking for me  
And I knew I was wasting my time  
But it was nobody's business  
Nobody's business but mine  
I was taking some comfort  
I needed a break from the rain  
I guess I was mistaken  
And someone remembered my name  
But I knew I was doin' just fine  
And it was nobody's business  
Nobody's business but mine  
Well I guess for some  
Revenge is sweet  
Though it be once removed  
I hope you feel better  
I don't know what you proved  
Well, yonder comes the Emperor, boys  
He sure looks fine in blue  
I hope you feel better, babe  
I know you're scared too  
Well it sure makes you wonder  
The things that some people will say  
They can see black and white but they  
Don't seem to notice the gray  
What a price for a victimless crime  
When it was nobody's business  
Nobody's business but mine  
Yeah, it was nobody's business  
Nobody's business but mine
