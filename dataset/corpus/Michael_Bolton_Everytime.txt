Don't want to lose this feelin'  
It's more than I need to survive  
Just when I stopped believin'  
That's when you came into my life  
  
You turned it around  
Within you I found  
Everything that's real to me  
I'm lost inside your love  
And that's just where I want to be  
  
[Chorus]  
Every time you give your love, it's a fire, it's a miracle  
Every time I feel your love in my life, I know it's a miracle  
You've got the power, you know it  
To touch my every fantasy  
When we make love, you show it  
In everything you give me  
  
So take what you want, take what you will  
You're the one who holds the key  
To open up the door, to reach the deepest part of me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Every time you give your love, it's a fire  
Every time I feel your love in my life, I know it's a miracle  
Every time, every time  
  
Just when I stopped believin', girl, you stepped into my life  
You give me the fire I needed  
It was so hard to find, you're givin' it every time  
  
[Chorus]
