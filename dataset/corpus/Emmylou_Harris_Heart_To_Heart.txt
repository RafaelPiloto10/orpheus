Heart to heart we'll hold together  
Hand in hand we'll find a way  
Oh, the storms of life may blind us  
But with the loving vows that bind us  
  
Heart to heart hand in hand we'll stay  
Side by side forever and always  
Day by day till our lives are done  
This sweet love is ours to treasure  
Far beyond all time and measure  
Side by side day by day as one  
The years connot take what's between you and me  
We'll stand her together for the whole world to see  
  
Heart to heart there'll be no other  
Hand in hand for our love is true  
Oh, the words that we have spoken  
Will be a promise never broken  
Heart to heart hand in hand with you
