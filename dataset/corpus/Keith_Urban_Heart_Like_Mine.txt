I watched out the window  
As you drove away  
But we got so much history, baby  
Too much good love to throw away  
  
I know I can be a headstrong man  
Got a jealous streak a country mile wide  
Its just that I'm so damn scared of losing you  
As you're fading out of sight  
  
Ooh, ooh, I don't why I do this every time  
Ooh, ooh, run the other way from a heart like mine  
  
I'm doing the same things  
I saw my father do  
'Cause I was just a kid in the corner  
Watching words as they turned black and blue  
  
I'm the son of a son of a headstrong man  
So, defensive so full of foolish pride  
But I just will not lose you, baby  
And I'm starting to realize  
  
Ooh, ooh, I think I know why I do this every time  
Ooh, ooh, run the other way from a heart like mine  
  
I know the love that we got is good  
Can I be a better man, yeah, I know I could  
Standing here in the middle of this moonlit road  
I know just what I have to do  
  
Ooh, ooh, I'm runnin' to ya fast as I can tonight  
Ooh, ooh, gotta show you what its like, gotta show you what its like  
To be loved, so loved by a heart like mine  
Gonna wrap my arms around you as strong as young desire  
'Cause for you it's all beating in a heart like mine
