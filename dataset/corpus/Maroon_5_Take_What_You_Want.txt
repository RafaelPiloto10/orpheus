I woke up this morning with the burden of love hanging over my head as I  
Walked into the living room  
Sit with you, discuss what's going on  
Is it me?  
Is it you?  
Is it something I forgot to do?  
Tell me so that I understand  
  
I just need some time  
Gather all my thoughts  
To make up for the love I just lost  
You've been so good to me, given me everything  
Take what you want cause it doesn't belong to me  
  
I woke up this morning with the hurting that I would never ever wish upon  
Even my worst enemy  
Who is she, what the hell do you people want?  
Is it me?  
Is it you?  
Is it something I forgot to do?  
Tell me so that I understand  
  
I just need some time  
Gather all my thoughts  
To make up for the love I just lost  
You've been so good to me given me everything  
Take what you want cause it doesn't belong to me anyway  
  
I just need some time  
Gather all my thoughts  
To make up for the love I just lost  
You've been so good to me given me everything  
Take what you want cause it doesn't belong to me
