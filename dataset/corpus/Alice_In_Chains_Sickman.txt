What the hell am I?  
Thousand eyes, a fly  
Lucky then I'd be  
In one day deceased  
  
Sickman, sickman, sickman  
I can feel the wheel, but I can't steer  
When my thoughts become my biggest fear  
Ah, what's the difference, I'll die  
  
In this sick world of mine  
What the hell am I?  
Leper from inside  
Inside wall of peace  
  
Dirty and diseased  
Sickman, sickman, sickman, sickman  
I can see the end is getting near  
I won't rest until my head is clear  
  
Ah, what's the difference, I'll die  
In this sick world of mine  
Can you see the end?  
Choke on me my friend  
  
Must to drown these thoughts  
Purity over rot  
"Yeah, though I walk through the valley of rape and despair  
With head high and eyes alert  
  
I tread on a plane of many  
We who are of good nature and intention,  
But cannot touch on the dark  
Recesses of memory  
  
And pain learned, so come walk  
With me, feel the pain,  
And release it..."  
What the hell am I?  
  
Worn eroded pride  
Saddened 10 miles wide  
I'm gonna let it slide  
Sickman, sickman, sickman, sickman  
  
I can feel the wheel, but I can't steer  
When my thoughts become my biggest fear  
Ah, what's the difference, I'll die  
In this sick world of mine  
  
Ahh, etc., etc.
