Every day I'd wake and ask myself  
Was I strong enough for you  
Foolish doubts and fears took me away  
I'm sorry now you never knew  
For so long I've wondered where you are  
Underneath a tapestry of stars  
In my heart I knew you'd come again  
I just didn't know where or when  
  
[Chorus]  
Heaven waits for us  
Through loves open door  
And it's brought you back to me once more  
Heart don't fail me now  
Now that you are near  
Love was never far away from here  
I have tried to make some sense of this  
Guess I needed time away  
Once I realized how foolish I've been  
I couldn't waste another day  
I forgive you with my heart and soul  
And now it's time for us to lose control  
Take me in your arms like you did before  
Darling don't talk anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
Somewhere deep inside I always knew  
That I was meant to spend my life with you  
You're the only answer to my prayers  
I knew that love would lead us back somewhere  
Through love's open door  
And it's brought you back to me once more  
Heart don't fail me now  
Now that you are near  
Love was never far away from here
