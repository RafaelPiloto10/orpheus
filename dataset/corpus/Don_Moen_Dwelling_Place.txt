Lovely are Your dwelling places  
Thirsty I come after You  
Jesus, my joy, my reward  
Your love's restoring my soul  
Now I'm Yours and You are mine  
And from my heart a song will rise  
  
I love You, I love You, I love You  
I love You, I love You, I love You  
I love You, I love You, I love You  
And my heart will follow wholly after You  
  
Jesus, there is none beside You  
Righteous Ruler of the earth  
Nations will come and bow down  
Name above all names  
I sing Your praises  
And all that I can say to You is  
  
I love You, I love You, I love You  
I love You, I love You, I love You  
I love You, I love You, I love You  
And my heart will follow wholly after You  
  
I love You, I love You, I love You  
I love You, I love You, I love You  
I love You, I love You, I love You  
And my heart will follow wholly after You  
  
I love You, I love You, I love You  
I love You, I love You, I love You  
I love You, I love You, I love You  
And my heart will follow wholly after You  
And my heart will follow wholly after You (wholly after You)  
And my heart will follow wholly after You
