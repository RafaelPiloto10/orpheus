You got to weep  
You got to wail  
You got to drag yourself on hands and knees bleeding  
Another mile along the trail  
You got to laugh in the face of the devil  
When he's hanging on to your shirt tail  
You got to hold down the lid of the coffin  
And hammer in the last nail  
  
My baby's gone so far away  
She's never coming back to me  
  
You got to live  
You got to learn  
How to find your way to the end of the night  
When there's nowhere left to turn  
How to keep the last embers of the fire alight  
When there's nothing left to burn  
How to say goodbye to the ashes that fly  
From the cheap metal urn  
  
My baby's gone so far away  
She's never coming back to me  
  
She said go to sleep  
You got to save  
Your anger and rage for the living  
'Cause they're no damn good in the grave  
And don't waste your time in forgiving  
The ones who just don't know how to behave  
There's heaven and hell in the world that you live in  
But I'm in a different place  
  
My baby's gone so far away  
She's never coming back to me
