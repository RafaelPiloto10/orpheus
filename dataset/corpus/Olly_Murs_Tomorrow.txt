You know it's hard to be your friend  
I hate to let you down again  
We don't know how it's gonna end  
Cause now you know the secret  
I can't never mend And this could be gone when we wake up, tomorrow  
Hearts are unchanged  
Time that is left, is borrowed  
And I can't take the way that you look at me  
Is there any place you and I could be?  
And we could go away  
It all could go away This silence is deafening  
This ocean is without an end  
And there's something I know  
Something I know, we were meant to be  
Please listen to me, are you listening? Cause this could be gone when we wake
up, tomorrow  
Hearts are unchanged  
Time that is left, is borrowed  
And I can't take the way that you look at me  
Is there any place you and I could be?  
And we could go away  
It all could go away  
Tomorrow, tomorrow  
And this could be gone when we wake up, tomorrow  
Hearts are unchanged, time that is left is borrowed  
And I can't take the way that you look at me  
Is there any place you and I could be?  
And we could go away
