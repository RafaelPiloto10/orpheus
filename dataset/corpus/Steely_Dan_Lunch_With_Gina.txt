That must be her again  
She's leaning on my bell  
That cold psychotic ring  
The one I know so well  
So I'm nailed to the floor in the no-option zone  
There's about zero chance she'll give up and go home  
  
This endless afternoon  
It started on the day I met her  
Lunch with Gina is forever  
  
She's coming 'round the corner  
Her body's just a blur  
I peel out like The Flash  
It don't mean boo to her  
So I duck into Nino's, she's barred from the place  
The minute I walk out she's right in my face  
  
She's got nothing but time  
No use in trying to be clever  
Lunch with Gina is forever  
  
Now I'm in my apartment  
The blinds down the lights out  
The phone rings God help me  
There's nobody home  
  
I crouch on the carpet  
Not breathing just being  
Like meat on the bone  
  
I'm in a cozy booth  
Maybe my watch is fast  
Another Tanqueray  
I'll wait 'til twenty past  
I'm about to go postal when she waltzes in  
I guess she's a knockout, hey where have I been?  
  
The waiter never comes  
God knows the service could be better  
Lunch with Gina is forever  
  
Coffee and a kiss  
Maybe later maybe never  
Lunch with Gina
