When I was a young man courting the girls  
I played me the waiting game  
If a maid refused me with a tossing curls, oh,  
I let the old earth, take a couple of whirls  
While I plied her with tears in prays of pearls  
And as time came around she came my way  
As time came around she came  
For its a long, long while, from May to December  
And the days grow short, when you reach September  
And I have the lost my tears, and the walking in the little rain  
Hey honey, I haven't gotta time for gaining Waiting Game  
And the days turn to crawl(?grow old?) as they grow few  
September, November  
And these few colden(?golden?) days I'd like to spend 'em with you  
These golden days, I'd like to spend 'em with you  
And the days dwindle down to a precious few  
September, November  
And I'm not quite a quip for the waiting game  
I have a little money, and I have a little pain  
And these few golden days, as the days grow so few  
These golden days, I'd like to spend 'em with you  
These precious golden days, I'd like to spend 'em with you  
September song, September song  
September song, September song
