Many a tear has to fall but it's all in the game  
All in the wonderful game that we know as love  
You have words with him and your future's looking dim  
But these things your hearts can rise above  
  
Once in a while he won't call but it's all in the game  
Soon he'll be there at your side with a sweet bouquet  
And he'll kiss your lips and caress your waiting fingertips  
And your heart will fly away  
  
(Soon he'll be there at your side) with a sweet bouquet  
Then he'll kiss your lips and caress your waiting fingertips  
And your heart will fly away
