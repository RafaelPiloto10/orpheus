The seeds are planted here  
But they won't grow  
We won't have to say goodbye  
If we all go  
Maybe things will be better in Chicago  
To leave all we've ever known  
For a place we've never seen  
Maybe things will be better in Chicago  
Well it's braver to stay  
Even braver to go  
Wherever she goes I go  
Maybe things will be better in Chicago  
  
What we need the Lord will give us  
All we want we carry with us  
You know where I can be found  
Where the rainbow hits the ground  
I'm not alone  
I'm not afraid  
This bird has flown from his cage  
There's so much magic we have known  
On this sapphire we call home  
With my coat and my hat  
I say goodbye to all that  
Maybe things will be better in Chicago  
Maybe things will be better in Chicago  
  
Chicago  
Chicago  
All aboard!  
All aboard!  
All aboard!  
  
All aboard!  
All aboard!
