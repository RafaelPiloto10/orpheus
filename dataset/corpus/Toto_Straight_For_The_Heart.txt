Boy meets girl on the playground of life  
Falls in love for the very first time  
Late at night he sees her alone, but she's the type that can never be owned  
  
He can't get her off his mind, but she knows he'll get over her in time  
And the world goes round and round  
  
Chorus:  
She goes straight for the heart, she serves it sweet and cold  
But she goes straight for the heart  
It's just the only thing that she's ever known  
  
Boy sees girl on the poor side of town  
A city princess with her very own crown  
He's too young to be taking such a chance  
'Cause she walks the streets in the name of romance  
  
Everywhere she goes he's there and she knows, he's just another fool who cares  
And the world goes round and round  
  
Chorus  
  
Everywhere she goes he's there and she knows, he's just another fool who cares  
And the world goes round and round  
  
She goes straight for the heart, she serves it sweet and cold  
But she goes straight for the heart  
  
'Cause that's the only thing that she's ever known (repeats 4x)
