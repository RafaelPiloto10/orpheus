I love Thee in the sky,  
After long, hot summer days,  
Like to run through the fields,  
When they've finished makin' hay.  
  
I love meeting people,  
I've never met before.  
And I like it when my friends,  
Come knocking at my door, yeah.  
  
Ooh, I love the sky at night,  
Just to sit and count the stars.  
I like to mess around,  
With bicycles and cars.  
  
I love to see the moon,  
When it's up and full.  
And I like it when a fish,  
Gives my line a pull.  
  
So, it's easy to see,  
Just how good You been to me.  
Oh, you made life's mystery,  
An open book for all to see.  
  
I love stone ground bread,  
And I like it when I get my breakfast in bed.  
I love little old ladies,  
Who make funny faces at brand new babies.  
  
So, it's easy to see,  
Just how good You been to me.  
Oh, you made life's mystery,  
An open book for all to see.  
  
I love St. Judy's comet,  
I love to break bread,  
I get a blessing from it.  
  
And I love to see a Bible,  
That's been well used.  
'Cause when a Bible's well used,  
The devil's not amused.  
  
So, it's easy to see,  
Just how good You been to me.  
Oh, you made life's mystery,  
An open book for all to see.  
  
So, it's easy to see,  
Just how good You been to me.  
Oh, you made life's mystery,  
An open book for all to see.  
  
Yeah, yeah,  
Anyone can read the book.  
Oh, the feel of a long, hot summer day.  
I love, I love,  
Little old ladies, who make funny faces at brand new babies.  
You made life's mystery and open book for all to see.  
I love breaking bread.  
I love to see a Bible when it's been well read,  
When it's well used, you know the devil's not amused.  
I love, I love, I love, I love, yeah,  
I love, I love, I love, I love.
