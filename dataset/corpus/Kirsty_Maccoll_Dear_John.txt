Oh dear john  
I hate to be the one to break the news  
But it's concerning me and you  
This is the letter no-one ever wants to write  
You may not believe me but it's the hardest thing I've ever done  
My eyes see other glories  
Other dreams and other stories  
And I want to live before I die  
Dear john  
  
Ten years on  
I still dream and we still hesitate  
The passion's all but gone  
Oh dear john  
Seems we have a bad day every day  
I want to sleep my life away  
This is the letter no-one ever wants to read  
And though it hurts like hell  
It may be what you need to tell you  
I never wanted to be cruel  
But I'm so tired of being the strong one  
And I don't always havet he energy  
And you always leave it up to me  
Dear john  
  
My eyes have seen the glory  
There's more to life than my life story  
And I'll probably never find him  
But I have to keep on looking  
And I'm very very sorry dear john
