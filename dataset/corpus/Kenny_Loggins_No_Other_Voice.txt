There is no other voice I long to hear  
At 3 a.m when I wake in fear  
There is no sound can soothe me down to my soul  
No other voice but yours  
There is no other voice I miss as much  
When I'm far from my home, your laughter, your touch  
There's no music on earth I'd rather hear  
No other voice but yours  
Your birdsong in the morning  
You're the wind in the trees  
The lapping of night waves on tropical seas  
You're the sound of my heart beat, my breathing, my life  
The lullabye rocking our babies to sleep at night  
And through the dead of the voices I scream in my head  
There is only one voice that sings love songs instead  
There is no other sound that speaks straight to my heart  
There is no other voice  
Not even a choice  
There is no other voice but yours
