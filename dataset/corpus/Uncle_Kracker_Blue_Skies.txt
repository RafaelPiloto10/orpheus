Embers in the ashtray,  
Six-pack down behind my seat,  
One hand up on the wheel,  
Eat A Peach playin' on repeat.  
Got my baby at my side,  
Her hair whippin' all in the wind,  
The last time I felt this good,  
I can't remember when  
  
Listen to the Goodyear's roll  
Hummin' through the radio  
Let it lighten up your load  
Ain't got no place to go.  
Watching those fence poles fly,  
As the miles roll by,  
Nothin' but blue skies,  
Hangin' over you and I.  
Ain't lookin' for direction,  
Don't need it if it don't come free,  
A billboard says "Trust the Lord"  
A piece of country I ain't never seen.  
Nobody wavin' in the rearview,  
Just put the pedal to the floor and drive  
Don't it feel so good to you?  
I feel so alive  
  
Listen to the Goodyear's roll  
Hummin' through the radio  
Let it lighten up your load  
Ain't got no place to go.  
Watching those fence poles fly,  
As the miles roll by,  
Nothin' but blue skies,  
Hangin' over you and I.  
  
Her painted toes on the dash,  
Her hand on my knee  
She ain't looking out the window  
Cause she's too busy lookin' at me  
Yeah  
  
Listen to the Goodyear's roll  
Hummin' through the radio  
Let it lighten up your load  
Ain't got no place to go.  
Watching those fence poles fly,  
As the miles roll by,  
Nothin' but blue skies,  
Hangin' over you and I.  
Nothin' but blue skies,  
Hangin' over you and I.
