Where's my Peggy Sue?  
I could use a Rosalita  
If there's a Long Tall Sally out there  
I'm dyin' to meet her  
  
Why can't I hear Beth callin' me?  
Why can't I be the one to make Sara smile?  
I wish I was arm in arm with Jean genie  
Walkin' down the aisle  
  
Oh yeah, all right  
  
But I got no Mary Jane  
There's no Sloopy or Dancin' Queen  
I'm just a fool in the rain  
Waitin' on my Billie Jean  
  
I want an Angie, a Mandy, a Candy-O  
A devil in a dress of blue  
A Rosanna, Diana, a sweet Caroline  
I'd even take a Run-Around Sue  
  
Oh yeah, all right  
  
Well, I never got to scream for a Layla  
I never saw Mary-Anne walkin' away  
I never danced on the sand with a Rio  
Or woke up with a Maggie May  
  
I dialed 867-5309  
But there was no Jenny Jenny  
Oh, why can't I get myself a brown-eyed girl  
When Willie Nelson loved so many?  
  
And why does Jack have Diane?  
And why does Billy Joe have Bobbie Sue?  
And everybody had Roxanne  
Except you-know-who  
  
I want an Angie, a Mandy, a Candy-O  
A devil in a dress of blue  
A Rosanna, Diana, a sweet Caroline  
I'd even take a Run-Around Sue  
  
Well I'd take any ol' Suzy Q  
I got no reason to be picky  
She can be a Goody-Goody-Two-Shoes  
Or she can be my Darling Nikki  
  
Oh, Brandy would be such a fine girl  
And so would the sweet Judy Blue  
I guess I sound just like that other fella  
'Cause you know I wish I had Jessie's girl too  
  
Oh yeah, all right  
  
Well, I'd die for a kiss from Allison  
Even though I know she'd break my heart  
Or give me a Lo-lo-lo-lola  
Minus the extra part  
  
I want an Angie, a Mandy, a Candy-O  
A devil in a dress of blue  
A Rosanna, Diana, a sweet Caroline  
I'd even take a Run-Around Sue  
  
You know I'd even take a Run-Around Sue  
Well, I'd even take a Run-Around Sue  
  
Oh yeah, all right
