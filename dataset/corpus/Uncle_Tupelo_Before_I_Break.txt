On liquor I spend my last dime  
  
Sunday morning, 8am  
Cursing myself again  
Drinking like this one might be my last  
  
Memories of making jokes  
Too much beer and talk-show hosts  
One of them that's fading fast  
  
Here's to waking up at night  
Drunk and undressed by the side of the road  
You're still thinking  
  
That you can't go on like this  
Before I break down  
You keep saying thanks so much, I can't live  
Thanks so much, I've had enough  
  
Well, it'd do me just fine to make it through the night  
On liquor I spend my last dime  
  
A worried man drinks a healthy drink  
But he drinks nine or ten until he's done  
Then he'll tell you his life story  
But he won't stop until he's told you and everyone  
  
Here's to waking up at night  
Drunk and undressed by the side of the road  
You're still thinking  
  
That you can't go on like this  
Before I break down  
You keep saying thanks so much, I can't live  
Thanks so much, I've had enough  
  
Well, it'd do me just fine to make it through the night  
On liquor I spend my last dime  
  
Memories of making jokes  
Too much beer and talk-show hosts  
One of them that's fading fast  
  
Here's to waking up at night  
Drunk and undressed by the side of the road  
You're still thinking  
  
That you can't go on like this  
Before I break down  
You keep saying thanks so much, I can't live
