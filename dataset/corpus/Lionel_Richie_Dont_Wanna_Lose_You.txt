Times are hard, my spirit's weak,  
Ev'rything seems to be goin' wrong, the outlook's bleak.  
You know I fooled around, play'n' the field.  
That's when I found that your love is real.  
I know I havn't treated you so right,  
but I won't lose your love without a fight.  
  
I'm gonna hold on to the love we have together.  
Hold on, don't you say goodbye.  
I want you to tell me now before we lose forever.  
Girl, I don't want to lose.  
  
I, girl,I've got to have your sweet lovin'  
cause without it, girl, I just lose my mind.  
The way you hold me, comforts me and shows me  
that a love like your is hard to find.  
I need your lovin ev'ry day and night.  
Your kind of lovin' makes me feel alright.  
  
Got to hold on to the love we have together.  
Hold on, don't you say goodbye.  
I want you to tell me now before we lose forever.  
Girl, I don't want to lose you now.  
  
See, no I don't want to lose you now.  
Baby don't go, don't go, not now.  
No, no baby. Baby, don't go,  
I need you by my side girl, yeah.  
Baby, don't go, I love you so.  
And I don't want to lose you,  
don't want to lose you.  
  
Hold on to what we got, baby.  
Hold on just can't say goodbye,  
no, no, not now.  
Tell me now, before we lose forever.  
Girl, I don't want to lose you,
