I said baby you been looking real good  
You know that I remember when we met

It's a feeling that I know I know I'll never forget  
Oooh it was the best time I can remember  
Oooh and the love we shared  
Lovin' that'll last forever  
  
There wasn't much in this heart of mine  
But there's a little left and babe you found it  
It's funny how I never felt so high  
It's a feeling that I know I know I'll never forget  
Oooh, it was the best time I can remember  
Oooh and the love we shared  
Lovin' that'll last forever
