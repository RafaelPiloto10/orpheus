You're like a brother, just like no other  
You keep the torch, that eternal flame  
We bought the ticket, that one-way ticket  
The hottest seat on the crazy train  
  
It takes power to walk in our shoes  
It takes power to walk on  
  
We walk the borderline  
Crossing those ice-cold waters  
We jump into the fire  
Riding the wildest storm  
  
We rock the planet, up to the zenith  
Feel that adrenalin overload  
Can't stop the fever, that road fever  
It's in my blood, in every single bone  
  
It takes power to walk in our shoes  
It takes power to walk on  
  
We walk the borderline  
Crossing those ice-cold waters  
We jump into the fire  
Riding the wildest storm  
Doing it now or never  
We walk into the alright  
Bringing this baby home  
  
Another day around the corner  
There is sunshine after rain  
This journey is going an forever  
Home is where my heart is  
And I'm always on my way  
I don't look back now  
We don't look back now  
  
It takes power to walk on  
  
We walk the borderline  
Crossing those ice-cold waters  
We jump into the fire  
Riding the wildest storm  
Doing it now or never  
We walk into the alight  
Bringing this baby home
