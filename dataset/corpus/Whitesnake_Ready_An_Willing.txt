I want to be loved,  
Don't want to be teased.  
I don't want no woman  
Getting down on her knees.  
  
I'm ready an' willing  
To reach for the sun,  
So I can get me some loving  
Before I'm gone.  
  
I want more, more, more, more,  
I want some more  
Sweet satisfaction to soothe my soul.  
  
I want you to rock me  
All night long.  
Rope an' ride me, baby,  
Do me wrong.  
  
Roll me over, make be bleed,  
I'd dance with the devil  
To get what I need.  
I need more, more, more, more,  
I need some more of that  
Sweet satisfaction to soothe my soul.  
  
I get this crazy feeling inside my soul,  
And it's driving me insane.  
I get this crazy feeling,  
Can you feel it, baby,  
It's driving me out of my mind.  
I'm talking about sweet satisfaction,  
I'm ready an' willing, sweet satisfaction.  
I'm ready an' willing, sweet satisfaction.  
Sweet satisfaction, sweet satisfaction.  
I'm ready an' willing.  
  
I get this crazy feeling inside my soul,  
And it's driving me insane.  
I get this crazy feeling,  
Can you feel it, baby,  
It's driving me out of my mind.  
I keep on looking for  
  
Sweet satisfaction, I'm ready an' willing.  
Sweet satisfaction, I'm ready an' willing.  
Sweet satisfaction, I keep on looking.  
Sweet satisfaction, I keep on looking.
