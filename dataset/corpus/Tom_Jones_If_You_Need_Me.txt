If you need me, I want you to call me  
I said, if you need me, need me  
All you got to do is call me  
  
Don't wait too long  
If things go wrong  
I'll be home, home  
  
If you want me, send for me  
I said, if you want me, want me  
All you got to do is send for me  
  
Don't wait too long  
Just pick up your phone  
And I'll be home where I belong  
  
People always said, darling  
That I didn't mean you no good  
That you would leave me someday  
But way deep down in my heart  
I know I've got the best I could  
  
And I know it won't be long  
One of these days I'm gonna come  
Walking through that door  
And I can imagine in my mind  
That these are the words you will be singing  
  
I still love you  
Always thinking of you  
Yes, I still love you, I love you  
Always thinking of you  
  
Don't wait too long  
I gotta, gotta pick up your phone  
And I'll be home where I belong
