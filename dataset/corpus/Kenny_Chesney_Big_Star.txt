She was aware of her insecurities  
As she took the stage  
But she was convinced if she got up there  
That she'd be discovered some day  
So she belted it  
She hit the high notes fearlessly  
Oh, she melted them  
She brought them to their feet  
  
She was a big star  
At Banana Joe's Bar  
Where she sang karaoke every night  
She said if you work hard to get where you are  
It feels good in the hot spotlight  
She was a big star  
  
She made the local cable shows  
Where the camera fell in love with her face  
After a couple of weekends  
The groupies were crawling all over the place  
And she signed autographs  
Like she was Garth Brooks in a skirt  
And in the aftermath  
That small time town was hers  
  
She was a big star  
At Banana Joe's Bar  
Where she sang karaoke every night  
She said if you work hard to get where you are  
It feels good in the hot spotlight  
She was a big star  
  
Hey, she doesn't care anymore  
That her high school girlfriends cut her down  
The only thought she entertains is where they aren't  
And where she is now  
  
A few old neighbors swear they are certain  
She slept her way to the top  
She knows you don't get where you're goin'  
Unless you got something they ain't got  
So she sings tonight  
To twenty thousand plus  
And the young girls scream out loud  
Man that could be us  
  
She's a big star  
She eats caviar  
Just before she performs every night  
She says if you work hard to get where you are  
It feels good in the hot spotlight  
She's a big star
