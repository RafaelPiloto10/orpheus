Ya yeh ya, heyey ya, oh woh woh woh woh, ah ah ah ahh  
Say goodbye to all of your friends  
And the people we knew  
Its better that it comes from you  
Tell them what you want  
'Cause I tried so hard to make you happy  
No big star dreams, no things that seem  
To make up your life  
So I'm going back to new york city  
Where people live  
  
In my reality  
All of my life  
Yours was no good for me  
Need to feel the beat  
Of the street, in my life  
In my reality  
Back to my life  
Yours was no good for me  
Three thousand miles away  
And everyday's a new day  
  
All those dreams that pulled us apart  
And the things that you want  
They'll never be enough for you  
So I'll say goodbye  
And I'm going back to new york city  
Where people live  
  
In my reality  
Back to my life  
Yours was no good for me  
Need to feel the beat  
Of the street  
In my life  
Back to my old address  
Nobody to impress  
Three thousand miles away  
And everyday's a new day ya  
  
I guess my love was not enough for you  
So I'll say goodbye baby  
And I'm going back to new york city  
There people live  
  
In my reality  
All of my life  
Yours was no good for me  
I need to feel the heat of the street  
In my life  
Goodbye to Hollywood  
Didn't do me any good  
Three thousand miles away  
Where everyday is a brand new day, ay yah yah yah  
  
Soooo go on and say goodbye to all your friends  
And the people we new ew ew  
Its better that it comes from you  
And you can tell them what you want  
'Cause I tried so hard to make you happy baby  
But I gotta go back  
To my reality  
Back to my life  
That's where I need to be  
I need to feel the heat  
Of the streets ya a
