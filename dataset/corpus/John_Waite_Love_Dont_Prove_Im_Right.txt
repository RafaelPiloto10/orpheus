You used to celebrate it  
When I came in at 6 AM  
Ooh babe  
I could never really fake it  
  
'Cause I was in love again  
Love don't prove  
Love don't prove I'm right  
Love don't prove  
  
Love don't prove I'm right  
You used to sing and shout it  
Showing me what you got  
Oh babe  
  
I could never really doubt it  
Cause baby you got such a lot  
Love don't prove  
Love don't prove I'm right  
  
No no  
Love don't prove  
Love don't prove  
Ooh you used to celebrate  
  
Oh now you have to wait  
You're gonna wait  
Love don't prove  
Love don't prove I'm right  
  
No no no no no no  
Love don't prove  
Love don't prove  
If you need a hand to guide you  
  
Let me be your northern light  
You could give me all of your lovin'  
And I'll make everything alright  
Love don't prove  
  
Love don't prove I'm right  
No no no  
Love don't prove  
Love don't prove I'm right  
  
Love don't prove  
Love don't prove that I'm right  
Oh yeah
