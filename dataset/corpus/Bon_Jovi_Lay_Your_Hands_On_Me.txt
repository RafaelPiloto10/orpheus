If you're ready, I'm willing and able  
Help me lay my cards on the table  
You're mine and I'm yours for the taking  
Right now the rules we made  
Are meant for breaking  
  
What you get ain't always  
What you see  
But satisfaction's guaranteed  
They say what you give is always  
What you need  
So if you want me to  
Lay my hands on you  
  
Lay your hands on me [Repeat: x4]  
  
Lay you hands on me  
  
I'm a fighter, I'm a poet  
I'm a preacher  
I've been to school and  
Baby, I've been the teacher  
If you show me how to get  
Up off the ground  
I can show you  
How to fly and never  
Ever come back down  
  
Everything you want  
Is what I need  
Satisfaction guaranteed  
But the ride don't never ever  
Come for free  
If you want me to lay  
My hands on you  
  
Lay your hands on me [Repeat: x4]  
  
Lay your hands on me  
  
Don't you know I only aim to please  
If you want me to lay  
My hands on you  
  
Lay your hands on me
