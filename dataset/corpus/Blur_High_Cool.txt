When you come here  
Which you sometimes do  
Don't think that I really want you to  
  
When you come here  
Which you always do  
Don't think that I expect you to  
  
Is that all I give you  
You talk too much  
Which you sometimes do  
Don't think that I really want you to  
  
And you talk too much  
But you always do  
Don't think that I really need you to  
Is that all I give you  
  
Is that all I give
