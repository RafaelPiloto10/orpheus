Bye bye baby, take me on a highway  
This time it could be heaven  
Even for a little while, didn't want to miss you  
Maybe I can make you feel fine  
I don't know what you want me to do  
But I'm losing control of my senses  
And I know I've been counting on you  
Just to show that you really care  
I can see that your star is ascending over me  
But I don't wanna go there  
'Cause I'm feeling so scared  
I've had enough of this love  
And you calling the shots outta thin air  
And I'm full of emotion  
When you don't believe me  
'Cause baby, here comes a crash  
And I'm dying inside when you leave me  
I don't know what you're putting me through  
But it seems that the party is over  
In and out of love with you  
And I think that I'm losing my mind  
I can see that your star is ascending over me  
But I don't wanna go there  
'Cause I'm feeling so scared  
I've had enough of this love  
And you calling the shots outta thin air  
And I'm full of emotion  
When you don't believe me  
'Cause baby, here comes a crash  
And I'm dying inside when you leave me  
But I don't wanna go there  
'Cause I'm feeling so scared  
I've had enough of this love  
And you calling the shots outta thin air  
And I'm full of emotion  
When you don't believe me  
'Cause baby, here comes a crash  
And I'm dying inside when you leave me  
But I don't wanna go there  
'Cause I'm feeling so scared  
I've had enough of this love  
And you calling the shots outta thin air
