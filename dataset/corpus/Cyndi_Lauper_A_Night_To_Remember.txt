I look out my window  
Into the pouring rain  
I wish I could tell you  
That I stopped hearing your name  
And then I realize every thought of you  
Runs a circle around my heart  
I hear your voice haunting me  
I feel your touch in the dark  
  
It was a night to remember  
All your kisses I still taste  
It was a night to remember  
Can't forget the look on your face  
It was a night  
  
Starlight send a message  
Like a beacon into the night  
To tell you I'm lonely  
When I shut out the light  
Because a part of me left with you  
So I feel lost inside  
Sometimes I look into my mirror  
I see you shining through my eyes  
  
It was a night to remember  
All your kisses I still taste  
It was a night to remember  
Can't forget the look on your face  
It was a night to remember  
  
All these feelings I can't erase  
From my heart  
  
Endless dreams  
Around my shoulders  
I cannot free this restless heart  
  
It was a night to remember  
...Not enough time for you to stay...  
...Can't forget the look on your face
