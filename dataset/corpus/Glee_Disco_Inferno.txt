Burn baby burn  
Burn baby burn  
Burn baby burn  
Burn baby burn  
Burnin'  
  
To mass fires, yes  
One hundred stories high  
People gettin' loose y'all  
Gettin' down on the roof, do you hear?  
  
The folks was flaming  
Out of control  
It was so entertainin'  
When the boogie started to explode  
I heard somebody say  
  
Burn baby burn, disco inferno  
Burn baby burn, burn that mama down  
Burn baby burn, disco inferno  
Burn baby burn, burn that mama down  
Burnin'  
  
Satisfaction  
Came in the chain reaction  
(Burnin')  
I couldn't get enough  
Till I had to self-destroy  
  
The heat was on  
(Burnin')  
Rising to the top  
Everybody's goin' strong  
And that is when my spark got hot  
I heard somebody say  
  
Burn baby burn, disco inferno  
Burn baby burn, burn that mama down, yo  
Burn baby burn, disco inferno  
Burn baby burn, burn that mama down  
Burnin'  
  
Up above my head, I hear music in the air  
I hear music  
That makes me know  
There's somebody somewhere  
  
Satisfaction  
Came in a chain reaction, do you hear?  
I couldn't get enough  
So I had to self destruct  
  
The heat was on  
Rising to the top  
Everybody's goin' strong  
That is when my spark got hot  
I heard somebody say  
  
Burn baby burn, disco inferno  
Burn baby burn, burn that mama down  
Burn baby burn, disco inferno, yeah  
Burn baby burn, burn that mama down  
Get it  
  
Burn baby burn  
Burn baby burn, burn that mama down  
Burn baby burn, disco inferno  
Burn baby burn
