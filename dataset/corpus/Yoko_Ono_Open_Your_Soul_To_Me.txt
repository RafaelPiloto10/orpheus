Open your soul to me,  
Open your soul to me,  
Open your soul to me.  
If we don't open our souls to each other,  
There's nothing in between us.  
  
All the years of living,  
All the years of talking,  
All the years of sharing the space.  
If we don't open our souls to each other,  
There's nothing in between us.  
  
I remember your eyes,  
Reflecting the skies.  
Waiting for the boat to come,  
Waiting for the boat.  
  
Writing the script of life,  
Playing the guessing game,  
Hurting from love and fear.  
If we don't open our souls to each other,  
There's nothing in between us.  
  
Some day when your boat is here  
And you're way out there,  
You may remember the summer clouds  
And that I tried to reach you.
