On Sunday after church there'd always be a picnic  
There'd be kinfolks callin' until dawn  
Me I'd play the guitar and my Uncle Merle would sing  
And grandpa he'd play that fiddle all night long  
Now the women folk they would work out in the kitchen  
You could smell that food for miles and miles around  
Paw he was prayin' my brother Jack would bring him down some moonshine  
Just so's that he could warsh those viddle down  
As soon as all the kids got tired of playin' horseshoes  
Mama she'd call me over to her side  
You know she'd say I'd like to take some pictures  
You could see her face light up with pride  
And then she'd bring out that worn out family album  
Its faded pictures some with corners torn  
She'd laugh and poin and tell me funny stories  
And look she'd say why that's the day that you were born  
And I'd sit and reminisce each picture with her  
And I'd listen to her laughter and her sighs  
But underneath I knew how much I'd hurt her  
For I'd put teardrops in my mama's eyes  
  
In my mama's eyes I've never done a wrong thing  
I was still a baby in my mama's eyes  
That old family album she'll keep on her night stand  
Right next to the Bible until the day she dies  
  
Through all those years in prison she stuck by me  
And she came to visit anytime she could  
Well I remember at my trial when she testified she loved me  
And she told the judge I'd always been so good  
Then later through the fame she watched me blossom  
From just a local country singer to a great big star  
She listened to all my records for the hidden meanings  
And she came to hear me sing in all those dim lit bars  
And she read all the things they wrote about me  
But she knew deep in her heart that it was lies  
No she don't hide her head in shame when someone says my name  
You'll find no teardrops in my mama's eyes  
In my mama's eyes...  
Right next to the Bible until the day she dies
