[Verse 1]  
I Remember way back when  
Lookin' for the right girl to be my friend  
I searched and searched but still never came up  
On the right one who would be mine and the only one  
Luck never came my way  
And all I ever came up with is a broken heart ya see  
I couldn't stand to be alone why my boys  
Straight kick it with the betties while I sat by the telephone  
Everytime I hear it rang it wasn't who I want it to be  
It was just the same ol' thing, Another day another heartache  
No pain, no gain, just Lookin' for a good thing  
Momma use to say don't look for love  
Just let it come around and surely one day it'll be found  
Ya see I'm kinda like 2 Pac, When I get around  
But the ICE goes down  
I go down, I go down, I go down baby, I go down  
I go down, I go down baby doll, I go down  
[Verse 2]  
Step up if ya think ya out there  
I know it's gotta be a tender  
Who'll remember Ice somewhere  
That's only if you're ready for a real one  
I need a tender and yeah I gotta feel one  
I want to tease and please  
And do it all with ease  
But ya gotta be right and all that  
There when I need ya perfect like Kodak  
Picture perfect body like an hour glass figure  
Cool in tha head and I gotta dig her  
The type that never says no  
Cause she's down to the fullest, Cool like the wind blows  
And I ain't trying' to search and find  
I guess it's true when they say that love is blind  
You see I'm kinda like 2 Pac, When I get around  
But the ICE goes down  
[Verse 3]  
Now I'm on tour and got the past behind me  
But I need something to remind me  
Of the days when I played the kissing game  
But now things changed and no I ain't the same  
I made a come up, and now they run up  
They all scream I'm the one, That wants to give the love up  
But ICE ain't got no time for games  
I need a real love, Like Mary J. Blige know what I'm sayin  
But the odds are still against me, I'm making paper  
And still need that one, That wants to be with me  
And not for the money, Nor the fame, But for me  
One who can give me that security  
So if you're out there this one's for you  
You'll be down with me, then maybe I'll be true  
You see I'm kinda like 2 Pac, When I get around  
But the ICE goes down
