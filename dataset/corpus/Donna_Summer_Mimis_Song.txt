Spoken:  
You know tonight is a very important night  
For me for a number of reasons  
My little girl is here tonight  
And I don't think you understand  
What it's like being the daughter of  
Someone who's always gone  
It's kind of scary and it's kind of lonely  
And I guess she thinks to herself sometimes  
"Is mummy ever going ever gonna come home?"  
And so my daughter looked up at me  
Last week and she said "mummy  
When are you just gonna stay home  
One day and be with me"?  
And so it kinda struck me funny  
And I didn't realize that I hadn't spent  
Anytime with her for a long time  
So I sat down and wrote down this song  
After she went to bed  
And I told her tonight when it was bedtime  
I would sing her son  
I bet you ask yourself  
Why I'm never there  
It's not because I like being away  
You see I've made a spectacle of myself  
And it seems that the whole world needs me  
I understand when you cry alone  
And mama's not there to wipe your eyes  
You see it's only because  
I'm out being someone to make you cry  
I got a little letter  
And I read it on the plane  
And in my heart I felt a funny kind of pain  
I wish that I could be there  
To touch your face again  
Mimi you're beautiful  
Mimi you're mine  
And other things that I do in my life  
Seem to take up all your precious time  
There's so much I long to say  
So much more I long to do  
But I guess it's all just have to wait  
Till I can get to see you  
Mimi you're mine  
Oh, Mimi you're mine  
Oh, Mimi you fill my life  
You fill my life with so much love  
Cause you're beautiful  
And you love me  
And you'll understand  
Mimi it's bedtime say Goodnight  
"Goodnight"
