I just heard the saddest news somebody's back in town  
And I know just what she's gonna do  
She'll pick up what she left off her last time around  
Oh how it hurts to keep on losin' you  
Somebody's back in town to steal your love from me  
The fear I've had so long is now reality  
The only chance I have is when she throws you down  
My chance is gone somebody's back in town  
[ steel ]  
I know that I can't change your way we've been through that before  
Her trap is set and you will walk right in  
She only wants of love an up-affair and nothing more  
And you're just fool enough to fall again  
Somebody's back in town why can't she stay away  
You should know she never loved you anyway  
She'll let you live a little then she'll throw you down  
Sad news today somebody's back in town
