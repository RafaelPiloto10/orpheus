I walk the streets at night  
Under artificial light  
Looking for somewhere to live  
I've been on the east side  
Where a lady can reside  
But, I'm waiting for you  
  
Waiting for you  
In the falling rain  
Oh heal me  
Heal me, again  
  
What's the cost of fame?  
What's in a name?  
Maybe, can you  
Vibrate and clarify  
So that even lowly I  
Can find the road that leads to you  
  
In the falling rain  
Oh heal me  
Heal me, again  
  
One more little heartache  
One more little heartache  
One more little earthquake  
Wash me down  
Wash me down  
  
Ghostly memory  
Come back to me  
Fill me and then  
Take me to your grave  
I promise to behave  
And let me in the whole  
Of you  
  
In the falling rain  
Oh heal me  
Heal me, again
