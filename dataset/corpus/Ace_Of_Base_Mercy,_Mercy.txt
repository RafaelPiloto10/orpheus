The man in the moon has a thousand different faces  
The man in the moon changes colours each day  
He's watching us all  
The big and the small  
Can he see  
Just you and me  
Searching for my destiny?  
Mercy, mercy  
You've gotta have pity on me  
Have mercy on me  
Mercy, mercy  
Wanna be free and happy  
Have mercy on me  
Do you believe we can travel into the future?  
Do you believe there's a man in the sky?  
We're making him sad,  
The good and the bad  
Can he see  
Just you and me  
Searching for my destiny?  
Ohh  
Mercy, mercy  
You've gotta have pity on me  
Have mercy on me  
Mercy, mercy  
Wanna be free and happy  
Have mercy on me  
I don't wanna be just one in many faces  
I want you looking at me  
Sit down and take a look  
Put me into motion  
Give me something to believe  
Mmm hmmm mmm  
Mmm hmmm mmm  
Mercy, mercy  
You've gotta have pity on me  
Have mercy on me  
Mercy, mercy  
You've gotta have pity on me  
Have mercy on me  
Ohhh,  
Mercy, mercy  
You've gotta have pity on me  
Have mercy on me, mmm  
Oh,  
Mercy, mercy  
You've gotta have pity on me  
Have mercy on me
