7-11 (Mark Davis)  
(Stairway To Heaven - Led Zeppelin)  
  
There's a lady who goes  
To the store that won't close  
And she's shopping at 7 Eleven  
  
Down the aisle she sees  
Ding-dongs, beer, and Friskies  
And a Snickers really satisfies her  
  
Ooooh make my Slurpy  
  
If there's a penny on the counter  
You can use it  
Please pay inside before pumping gas  
Dear Lebanese cashier how I wish  
You spoke English  
I just bought a Big Gulp from Ahmed  
Ahmed  
  
(Greetings!  
Perhaps you would be enjoying a beef jerky with your purchase of Hustler
magazine.  
Do you require a spoon straw?)  
  
And you will find one down the road  
Coffee and cigarettes to go  
Twinkies from here to Tokyo  
They've been robbed eight times in a row  
And the fluorescent lights glow  
Microwave your burrito  
  
And she's shopping at 7 Eleven
