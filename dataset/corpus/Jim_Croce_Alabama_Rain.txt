Lazy days in mid-July  
Country Sunday mornin's  
Dusty haze on summer highways  
Sweet magnolia callin'  
  
[Chorus]  
But now and then I find myself  
Thinkin' of the days  
That (when) we were walking in  
The Alabama rain  
  
Drive-in movies, Friday nights  
Drinkin' beer and laughin'  
Somehow things were always right  
I just don't know what happened  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We were only kids  
But then I've never heard it said  
That kids can't fall in love  
And feel the same  
I can still remember the first time  
I told you "I love you"  
  
On a dusty mid-July  
Country summer's evenin's  
Weepin' willows sang its lullaby  
And shared our secret  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Walking in the Alabama rain
