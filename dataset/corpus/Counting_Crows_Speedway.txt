I get so nervous I'm shaking  
Gets so I got no pride at all  
Gets so bad but I just keep coming back for more  
I guess I just get off on that stuff  
  
I'm thinking about taking some time  
I'm thinking about leaving soon  
  
I got some things I can't tell anyone  
I got some things I just can't say  
They're the kind of things no one knows about  
I just need somebody to talk to me  
  
I'm thinking about leaving tomorrow  
I'm thinking about being on my own  
I think I been wasting my time  
I'm thinking about getting out  
  
In all this time,  
The bottom line's you don't know how much I feel  
You say you see but I don't agree  
You don't know how I feel  
  
I'm just trying to get myself some gravity  
You're just trying to get me to stay  
Sometimes I sit here looking down upon Los Angeles  
Sometimes I'm floating away  
  
I'm thinking about breakin myself  
I'm thinking about getting back home  
I think I been waiting for way too long  
I'm thinking about getting out
