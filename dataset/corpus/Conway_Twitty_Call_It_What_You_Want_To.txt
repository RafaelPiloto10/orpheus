You tell me that it's over  
I'm just someone you think of now and then  
And you say that you once loved me  
But the love you had for me came to an end.  
  
And you tell me that my memory  
Is just a dying ember not a flame?  
Well, you can call it what you want to  
It's still love by any other name.  
  
Call it what you want to  
I still bring out the want to in your eyes  
Every time that I'm around you  
The desire that surrounds you just can't be disguised.  
  
You can call it anything at all  
But what you're telling me don't change a thing  
You can call it what you want to  
I still bring out the want to in your eyes.  
  
Every time that I'm around you  
The desire that surrounds you just can't be disguised  
You can call it anything at all  
But what you're telling me don't change a thing.  
  
Baby, call it what you want to  
It's still love by any other name
