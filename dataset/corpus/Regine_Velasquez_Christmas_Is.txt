Fire sight winter snow  
Lights are on the tree  
The world is all aglow again  
With all these season brings  
And though it comes around each year  
The meaning of the season seems to disappear  
Oh it's good to be reminded  
  
Christmas is for girls and boys  
Trimming trees and Santa's toys  
It's mom and dad, and grandma, grandpa too  
Christmas is a sacred birth  
A chance for hope and peace on earth  
It's everything that we hold dear and true  
But most of all, Christmas is  
The love that lives inside of me and you.  
  
Sleepy eyes are open wide  
And tiny hearts beat fast  
To celebrate the morning  
Just like every Christmas past  
We gathered close to family  
Embracing all that's been  
And all that's yet to be  
Oh it's good to be reminded  
  
Christmas is the candle light  
Jingle bells and silent night  
Friends from long ago  
And friends and we've made anew  
Christmas is a sacred birth  
A chance for hope and peace on earth  
It's everything that we hold dear and true  
But most of all, Christmas is  
The love that lives inside of me and you.  
  
From where it all began  
One night in Bethlehem  
Reaches out to all of us  
Reminds us once again  
  
Christmas is for everyone  
The greatest gift of all the stuff  
The star that shines on all the world  
The light that leads us through  
Christmas is a sacred birth  
A chance for hope and peace on earth  
It's everything that we hold dear and true  
But most of all, Christmas is  
The love that lives inside of me and you.
