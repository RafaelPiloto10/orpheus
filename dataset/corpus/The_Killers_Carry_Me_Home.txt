Let me out  
Don't tell me everything  
Start it out  
Like any other day  
Must have gave the wrong impression  
Don't you understand where I belong?  
I'm not the one  
  
Stand again  
They say nothing comes for free  
And that's the truth  
I've been living in a fantasy  
Slip and slide ahead trip heaven  
Self-denial is such a wonderful and powerful thing  
But I'm not the one  
  
The morning dove sings with two broken wings  
Carry me home, I'm not afraid  
The stars in my eyes with shimmering lights  
Carry me home, don't let me fade away  
  
Stop the press the kids light is growing dim  
It took a month long slide, then the world came caving in  
When you self-destruct you wind up looking for a glimmer of hope  
But the writing's on the wall  
I'm not the one  
  
The morning dove sings with two broken wings  
Carry me home, I'm not afraid  
The stars in my eyes with shimmering lights  
Carry me home, don't let me fade  
  
Just how thick is your skin? (away)  
Just how sharp are your teeth?  
Oh, you've got a lot to learn  
Is there somewhere else that I can win  
Is there something else to start over again  
From the summit's edge to the cutting room floor  
I will be afraid no more (no more)  
  
The morning dove sings with two broken wings  
Carry me home, I'm not afraid  
The stars in my eyes with shimmering lights (with shimmering lights)  
Carry me home, don't let me fade  
Carry me home, carry me
