I had a good home but I left  
I had a good home but I left, right, left  
That big fucking bomb made me deaf, deaf  
A Humvee mechanic put his Kevlar on wrong  
I guarantee you'll meet up with a suicide bomb  
Hell broke luce  
Hell broke luce  
  
Big fucking ditches in the middle of the road  
You pay a hundred dollars just for fillin' in the hole  
Listen to the general every goddamn word  
How many ways can you polish up a turd  
Left, right, left, left, right  
Left, right  
Hell broke luce  
Hell broke luce  
Hell broke luce  
  
How is it that the only ones responsible for making this mess  
Got their sorry asses stapled to a goddamn desk  
Hell broke luce  
Hell broke luce  
Left, right, left  
  
What did you do before the war?  
I was a chef, I was a chef  
What was your name?  
It was Geoff, Geoff  
I lost my buddy and I wept, wept  
I come down from the meth  
So I slept, slept  
I had a good home but I left, left  
  
Pantsed at the wind for a joke  
I pranced right in with the dope  
Glanced at her shin she said nope  
Left, right, left  
  
Nimrod Bodfish have you any wool  
Get me another body bag, the body bag's full  
My face was scorched, scorched  
I miss my home I miss my porch, porch  
Left, right, left  
  
Can I go home in March? March  
My stanch was a chin full of soap  
That rancid dinner with the Pope  
Left, right, left  
  
Kelly Presutto got his thumbs blown off  
Sergio's developing a real bad cough  
Sergio's developing a real bad cough  
And hell broke luce  
Hell broke luce  
Hell broke luce  
  
Boom went his head away  
And boom went Valerie huh  
What the hell was it that the president said?  
Give him a beautiful parade instead  
Left, right, left  
  
When I was over here I never got to vote  
I left my arm in my coat  
My mom she died and never wrote  
We sat by the fire and ate a goat  
Just before he died he had a toke  
Now I'm home and I'm blind  
And I'm broke  
What is next
