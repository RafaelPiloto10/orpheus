Who can I turn to when nobody needs me?  
My heart wants to know and so I must go where destiny  
Leads me  
With no star to guide me and no one beside me  
I'll go on my way and, after the day, the darkness will  
Hide me  
  
And maybe tomorrow I'll find what I'm after  
  
I'll throw off my sorrow, beg, steal, or borrow my share  
Of laughter  
With you I could learn to, with you what a new day  
But who can I turn to if you turn away?  
  
With you I could learn to, with you what a new day  
But who can I turn to if you turn away?
