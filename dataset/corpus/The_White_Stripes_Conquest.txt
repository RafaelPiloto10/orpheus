Conquest  
He was out to make a conquest  
Didn't care what harm was done just as long as he won  
The prize  
  
Conquest  
She was just another conquest  
Didn't care whose heart was broke  
Love to him was a joke till he looked into her eyes  
  
And then in the strange way things happen  
Their roles were reversed from that day  
The hunted became the huntress  
The hunter became the prey  
  
Conquest  
Now you know who made the conquest  
She with all her female guile led him helpless down the aisle  
She had finally made a conquest  
  
Ah, ah, ah, ah  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah  
Ah, ah, ah, ah  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah  
Ooo, ooo, ooo  
  
And then in the strange way things happen  
Their roles were reversed from that day  
The hunted became the huntress  
The hunter became the prey  
  
Conquest  
Now you know who made the conquest  
She with all her female guile led him helpless down the aisle  
She had finally made a conquest  
  
Ah, ah, ah, ah  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
