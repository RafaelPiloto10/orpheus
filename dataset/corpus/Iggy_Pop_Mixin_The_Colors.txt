All across the continents  
Everywhere a soul is sent  
A new mix of the races is taking  
It's what Hitler didn't like  
And it makes a pretty sight  
Just look at what you see on your MTV  
  
Out on the edges they' re mixin' the colors  
Some they don' t like it but me I don' t mind  
In every city they' re mixing the colors  
Different shades for the whole countryside  
If you leave the hate alone tonight  
Music's gonna get you home tonight  
If you leave the hate alone tonight  
Music's gonna get you home tonight  
Mixin', they 're mixin'  
  
On the edges of the line  
There's a different kind of kind  
No one seems to claim for  
The race war games  
'cause you don t have to choose sides  
It just crucifies your mind  
There's a hundred million ways  
To live your life for yourself  
'  
Out on the edges they re mixin' the colors  
Some they don 't like it but me I don' t mind  
In every city they 're mixin' the colors  
Different shades for the whole countryside  
  
I like the kids with the ways of their own  
If you leave the hate alone tonight  
Music's gonna get you home tonight  
If you leave the hate alone tonight  
Music's gonna get you home tonight  
Mixin' the colors  
  
Now a language that sounds new  
Comes a-driftin' next to you  
And the music that you hear ls changin' too  
'cause they 're mixin' the colors  
Baby the colors
