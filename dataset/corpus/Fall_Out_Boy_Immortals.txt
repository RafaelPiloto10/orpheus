[Verse 1]  
They say we are what we are,  
But we don't have to be.  
I'm bad behavior but I do it in the best way.  
I'll be the watcher of the eternal flame,  
I'll be the guard dog of all your fever dreams.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass (glass, glass).  
I'll try to picture me without you but I can't.  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause we could be immortals, immortals,  
Just not for long, for long.  
Live with me forever now,  
Pull the blackout curtains down,  
Just not for long, for long.  
We could be immor-immortals, immor-immortals,  
Immor-immortals, immor-immortals.  
(Im-immortals)  
  
[Verse 2]  
Sometimes the only payoff for having any faith,  
Is when it's tested again and again everyday.  
I'm still comparing your past to my future,  
It might be your wound, but they're my sutures.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass (glass, glass).  
I'll try to picture me without you but I can't.  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause we could be immortals, immortals,  
Just not for long, for long.  
Live with me forever now,  
Pull the blackout curtains down,  
Just not for long, for long.  
We could be immor-immortals, immor-immortals,  
(Im-immortals)  
  
[Bridge]  
And live with me forever now,  
Pull the blackout curtains down.  
  
[Outro]  
We could be immortals, immor-immortals  
Just not for long, for long  
We could be immor-immortals, immor-immortals,  
Immor-immortals, immor-immortals.  
(Im-immortals).
