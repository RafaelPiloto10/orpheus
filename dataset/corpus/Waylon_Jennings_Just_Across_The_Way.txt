Just across the way a house is dark  
I can hardly see  
Just a cross the way lives a girl  
Who's so in love with me  
But I'm such a bitter soul  
Whose memories seemed to always get their way  
So I live here with my memories  
She lives there with her love just across the way  
Just across the way  
I can see her in the window watching me  
With her face rest to the pain  
And her eyes look more tear stained everyday  
But I'm such a bitter soul  
Whose memories keep standing in her way  
I'm so lonely with my memories  
She's lonely with her love just across the way  
Just across the way might as well be  
In the heavens on a star  
We're just close enough together  
To see just what far apart we are  
But I'm such a bitter soul  
Whose memories keep standing in the way  
I'm so lonely with my memories  
She's lonely with her love just across the way  
Just across the way, just across the way
