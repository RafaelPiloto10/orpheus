What kind of person lives behind that face?  
Inside your midnight eyes I'm staring into space  
I don't understand  
What kind of man do you think I am?  
  
I'm falling out of control  
You took my body and you tore out my soul  
I don't understand  
I'm just a simple man I am  
I am  
  
I don't really give a damn  
You take me just the way I am  
And only I have the answer  
I'm not owned by Uncle Sam  
And you're still guessing who I am  
I'm your voodoo dancer  
Voodoo dancer  
  
Consider my feelings just one time  
I've done my sentence even though there was no crime  
I'm an innocent man  
I should have learned to walk before I ever ran  
I'm still running  
  
You never know the secrets that I have inside my head I'm clever  
My crystal ball it tells me all the things I wanna know forever  
Now I'm feeling the emptiness inside still concealing  
All the things I tried to hide forever  
I don't understand  
  
I don't really give a damn  
You take me just the way I am  
And I have the ultimate answer  
I'm not owned by any man  
And now you know just who I am  
Yes I'm your voodoo dancer  
  
Would you like to come and play in my fantasy?  
There'll be no one there baby, just you and me
