Never a word, a word so true  
Passed between us, me and you  
Heard you found your pot of gold  
That's the story I've been told  
  
Never a word was said in vain  
Some were never sad again  
Some were lost in lovers' heat  
Some lay fallen at our feet  
  
All day all night  
You and only you  
All day all night  
I think of you and only you  
  
Never a word escaped my lips  
Silenced by your fingertips  
I kept my word, can you believe  
All this time so hard to breathe  
Hard to breathe
