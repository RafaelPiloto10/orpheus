Facing forwards, sinking in thin air  
Help me to learn, to breath again  
I know I've lost my way  
So show me  
  
There are demons inside my head  
I always let them win  
I have to learn to suffocate them  
  
The lost ask for a hand  
But I can't stop, I never stop  
  
I've been losing my footing here  
I'm all mixed up in this  
I need some kind of change  
God make it stop, I can't make it stop  
This place is getting smaller  
  
Everything in your darkest thoughts about me might be true  
I hear the words you say, I still feel nothing  
I put my voice out there for you to hear  
But the words never made much sense to you  
  
I've lost my path  
I'm fading fast  
  
Time is short  
Time is up  
  
I've been losing my footing here  
I'm all mixed up in this  
I need some kind of change  
God make it stop, I can't make it stop  
This place is getting smaller  
  
This is really my plan  
To get out in one piece  
Is this really your plan  
To keep me lost and on my knees  
  
I say redemption  
Can someone help me hold on
