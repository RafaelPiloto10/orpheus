Who can say for certain  
Maybe you're still here  
I feel you all around me  
Your memory's so clear  
Deep in the stillness  
I can hear you speak  
You're still an inspiration  
Can it be  
  
That you are my forever love  
And are you watching over me  
From up above  
Fly me up to where you are  
Beyond the distant star  
I wish upon tonight  
To see you smile  
If only for a while to know you're there  
A breath aways not far to where you are  
  
Lie gently sleeping  
Here inside my dream  
And isn't faith believing  
All power can't be seen  
As my heart holds you  
Just one beat away  
I cherish all you gave me  
Everyday  
  
Cause you are my forever love  
Watching me from up above  
And I believe that angels breathe  
And that love will love on  
And never leave  
Fly me up to where you are  
Beyond the distant star  
I wish upon tonight  
To see you smile  
If only for a while to know you're there  
A breath aways not far to where you are  
  
I know you're there  
A breath aways not far to where you are
