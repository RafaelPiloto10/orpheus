She's gonna love me like you never could  
She's gonna treat me like you never would  
She's gonna love me live I've never been loved before  
  
You should have grabbed me when you had your chance  
You got a little bit too big for your own leather pants  
I could have told you from the start  
No one's ever taken better care of your heart  
Now your gone, I don't care  
I've got a woman who will always be there, and...  
  
She's gonna love me like you never could  
She's gonna treat me like you never would  
She's gonna love me like I've never been loved before  
She's gonna spin me like a roulette wheel  
She's gonna treat me like I'm her last meal  
She's gonna love me and I keep comin' back for more  
  
Ooh she's gonna love me  
Ooh she's gonna love me  
She's gonna love me like her favorite hobby  
Throw me down and love me in the hotel lobby  
  
You figured I'd just always be around  
You thought we were so hot, you could have any boy in town  
Baby I've got some news for you  
I've got places to go and people to do  
Yeah, I cried a little when you said good-bye  
But now my eyes are filled with tears of joy, cus-  
She's gonna love me like you never could  
She's gonna treat me like you never would
