So you've gone  
Singing some old love song  
I've nothing more to lose  
  
I'm surrounded  
By old stories  
With nowhere to hide  
  
I could tear  
All your pictures  
I could tear everything  
  
You told me  
Time makes it easy but you  
Never told me time stands still  
  
I can't believe it  
I can't believe how it hurts  
I can't believe it  
I can't believe how love burns away  
  
I remember  
  
I can't sleep  
All your words  
Seem to let me down  
  
Where are you  
Why don't you call  
It's been a long long time  
  
I still remember  
I still remember it all  
I still remember  
I still remember how love burned away  
  
This could be  
My last song  
Everything must end some day
