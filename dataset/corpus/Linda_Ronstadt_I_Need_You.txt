Don't need a Rolex or a limousine  
Don't need my picture in a magazine  
Don't need approval of a chosen few  
Tell you what I do need, I need you  
  
Don't need no fixtures, fittings, or phone  
I'm so unfurnished, I'm on my own  
I Don't need reminding when the rent is due  
I tell you what I do need, I need you  
  
I need you like a fly needs a plane  
I need you like a ball needs a game  
I need you like a pool needs a cue  
Need you, need you, need you, I need you  
  
I Don't need no covered kisses for company  
I Don't want no washed up dishes soft soaping me  
I Don't need no other fella, honey I refuse  
Tell you what I do need, I need you  
  
Oh, I need you like a fly needs a plane  
Oh, I need you like a ball needs a game  
I need you like a shot needs to shoot  
Need you, need you, need you, I need you  
  
Need you, need you, need you, I need you  
Need you, need you, need you, I need you  
Need you, need you, need you, I need you
