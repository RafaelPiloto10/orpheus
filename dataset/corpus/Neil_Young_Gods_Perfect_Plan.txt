There's plenty of food  
On the table  
Lots of love in the house  
The children all do what  
They're able to do  
We got so much to be happy about.  
  
I got a woman standing beside me  
She really knows  
How to stand by her man  
She's strong and she's soft  
And she's honest to me  
She really helps me  
To be a good man.  
  
But nothing is perfect  
In God's perfect plan  
Look in the shadow to see  
He only gave us the good things  
So we'd understand  
What life without them would be.  
  
There's plenty of wheat  
On the prairies  
Lots of coal in the mines  
We got soldiers so strong  
They can bury their dead  
And still not go back  
Shooting blind.  
  
There's women and men  
On the workforce  
Doing forty hours  
Plus overtime  
So the hostages  
Held at the airport  
Can come home  
To something worthwhile.  
  
But nothing is perfect  
In God's perfect plan  
Look in the shadow to see  
He only gave us the good things  
So we'd understand  
What life without them would be.  
  
And there's plenty of food  
On the table  
Lots of love in the house  
The children all do  
What they're able to do  
We got so much to be happy about.  
  
I got a woman standing beside me  
She really knows  
How to stand by her man  
She's strong and she's soft  
And she's honest to me  
It really helps me  
To be a good man.  
  
But nothing is perfect  
In God's perfect plan  
He only gave us the good things  
So we'd understand.  
No, nothing is perfect  
In God's perfect plan.
