You been gone  
You been gone  
You been gone one day  
one day to long  
  
I'm the kind of woman who understands  
How the road can be so hard on a traveling man  
I don't mind giving you a little room to breathe  
Then you go and take advantage of my generosity  
I'm home, waiting  
Alone, aching  
Your times run out cause  
Yesterday this love could have been saved  
Just crawl back out ain't no way  
  
You been gone  
You been gone  
You been gone one day  
One day too long  
  
You know, I ain't a once in a while kind of thang  
You see, love is being here for each other  
Even with you standing right here, right now  
right in front of my face  
You're still looking right through me  
Well, let me clear something up for you honey  
  
I called you up  
Told you I was  
Missing, needing  
To be soothed by you  
Keep your reasons  
I'm done pleasing  
Ain't it funny now  
I'm leaving, and your the one who's being left behind  
God sent me a man who will give me my time  
  
You been gone  
You been gone  
You been gone one day  
One day too long
