Oh the Wolfe Island Ferry is a very nice ferry  
It's a very nice ferry it's the Wolfe Island Ferry  
The Wolfe Island Ferry is a very nice ferry  
It's a very nice ferry, it's the Wolfe Island Ferry!  
Oh the Wolfe Island Ferry is a very nice ferry  
It's a very nice ferry it's the Wolfe Island Ferry  
The Wolfe Island Ferry is a very nice ferry  
It's a very nice ferry, it's the Wolfe Island Ferry!  
General Wolfe beat General Montcalm on the Plains of Abraham  
And because of this, they liked him an awful lot in Kingston  
The town was named Kingston in the county Frontenac  
So they spotted an island, and they called it Wolfe Island!  
Oh, it's got a couple highways and a really nice restaurant  
Called the "General Wolfe", and it's named after General Wolfe  
Who won a couple of battles and had an island named after him  
It's a really nice place and a good port to smuggle booze in from the States  
Oh the Wolfe Island Ferry is a very nice ferry  
It's a very nice ferry it's the Wolfe Island Ferry  
The Wolfe Island Ferry is a very nice ferry  
It's a very nice ferry, it's the Wolfe Island Ferry!  
Oh, the Wolfe Island Ferry doesn't carry any wolves  
Or any source of animals, except for a couple of seagulls  
Who are really lazy, and so they land on the ferry  
And that way, they don't have to fly all the way to Wolfe Island  
Oh, the Wolfe Island Ferry doesn't carry any fairies  
Cause fairies, unlike seagulls, don't really mind the flying  
They fly over to Wolfe Island sprinkling fairy dust all over  
Except it's really more like battery acid and it burns your skin until you die  
Well, they've got lots of potatos and Anne of Green Gables  
Oh crap, that's Prince Edward Island  
Sometimes I get confused when I switch my medication  
But I can see the bunny!  
Oh the Wolfe Island Ferry is a very nice ferry  
It's a very nice ferry it's the Wolfe Island Ferry  
The Wolfe Island Ferry is a very nice ferry  
It's a very nice ferry, it's the Wolfe Island Ferry!
