Listen honey, to every word I say  
I know that you don't trust me  
But I'm better than the stories about me  
Everybody messes up some days  
Ain't got no rhyme or reason  
All I know is I'm yours, yours, yours for every season  
  
Baby girl with the broken smile  
Would you mind if I stayed a while?  
And if you're cold, I could light your fire  
If that's what you want, if that's what you want  
I admit that I done some wrong  
But those wrongs helped me write this song  
And through it all, I figured out where I belong  
Right by your side, right by your side  
  
They say that hearts don't lie  
The head might try but it won't be right  
You tell me what you feel inside  
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight  
  
Listen honey, to every word I say  
I know that you don't trust me  
But I'm better than the stories about me  
Everybody messes up some days  
Ain't got no rhyme or reason  
All I know is I'm yours, yours, yours for every season  
  
Baby girl, let your hair hang down  
And if we're lost, baby let's get found  
And when the world's flipping upside down  
Let's make it right, let's make it right  
  
They say that hearts don't lie  
The head might try but it won't be right  
You tell me what you feel inside  
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight  
  
Listen honey, to every word I say  
I know that you don't trust me  
But I'm better than the stories about me  
Everybody messes up some days  
Ain't got no rhyme or reason  
All I know is I'm yours, yours, yours for every season  
  
Yours, yours, yours for every season  
  
Winter, Summer, Spring or Fall  
I'll be on the line waiting for your call  
Winter, Summer, Spring or Fall  
I'll be on the line waiting for your call  
Winter, Summer, Spring or Fall  
I'll be on the line waiting for your call  
  
Listen honey, to every word I say  
I know that you don't trust me  
But I'm better than the stories about me  
Everybody messes up some days  
Ain't got no rhyme or reason  
All I know is I'm yours, yours, yours for every season  
  
For every season
