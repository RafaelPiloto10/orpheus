It's alright I'll come 'round when you're not in  
And I'll pick up all my things  
Everything I have bought with you  
But that's alright too  
It's just everything I do  
We did together  
And there's a little piece of you  
In whatever  
I've got everything I need  
I've got petrol in the car  
I've got some money with me  
There's just one problem  
  
You're the only one I want [Repeat: x4]  
  
It's alright I know where I'm going  
I'm going to stay with my friend  
Yes, he's very good looking  
The only trouble is  
He's not you  
He can't do what you do  
He can't make me laugh and cry  
At the same time  
Let's change things  
Let's danger it up  
We're crazy enough  
I just can't take it  
  
You're the only one I want [Repeat: x4]  
  
I know where I'm going  
But I don't want to leave  
I just have one problem  
We're best friends, yeah?  
We tied ourselves in knots  
Doing cartwheels 'cross the floor  
Just forget it alright  
  
Sugar?  
Honey?  
Sugar?
