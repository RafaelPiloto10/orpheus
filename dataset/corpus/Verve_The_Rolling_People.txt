I got one more life  
Can you see it wasting away?  
But I got a plan  
Do you understand?  
  
The drugstore wife  
I was dealing soul and other white  
I won't shake your hands  
'Cause death has no plans  
  
But here we are the rolling people  
Can't stay for long  
We gotta go  
  
So come alive with the rolling poeple  
Don't ask why  
We just know  
  
I'm on a big jet plane  
With my briefcase and crime in my veins  
I'll be the first to toast  
To my rowdy soul  
  
But here we are the rolling people  
Don't ask why  
We don't know  
  
So come alive with the rolling people  
Don't ask why  
We just go now  
Yeah  
  
Don't even know which way I'm going to  
The lights are on and I am feeling blue  
I hope you know which way I'm going to fly  
Thank you for my life  
I said good night, good-bye  
  
You see me going  
  
But here we are the rolling people  
Can't stay for long  
We gotta go  
  
So come alive with the rolling people  
Don't ask why  
We don't know now  
Yeah
