Why's this motherfucker lookin' at me  
Is there something more that he wants to see  
I've got a gun and the motherfucker's loaded  
One more punk and you're dead and bloated, because  
  
All this shit, you disgust me  
Can I hate you, cause you're not like me  
So, me and my boys beat him down  
3 against one boy, whose the clown?  
So I never had a fuckin' education  
Sell a little drugs, to battle inflation  
Sleep with a girl that I sometimes pay  
Fuck it, better than bein' fuckin' gay anyways  
  
See one walkin' and it makes me mad  
This I learned from dear old dad  
Hate all the things you don't understand  
Hate all the things you don't understand  
So I hate all the things I don't understand  
Hate all the things I don't understand  
Hate all the things I don't understand!  
  
Nurtured with a fist  
Shove instead of a kiss  
Glare instead of a wink  
Listen to me, boy don't fuckin think!  
And hate him because he's gay  
cause he doesn't live our fuckin way  
So I grew up to hate what I am  
Hate what I hate  
  
I'm a man  
I'm a man  
I'm a man  
I'm a man  
Man I'm a man  
  
I'm a man  
I'm a man  
I'm a man  
Man I'm a man  
  
I'm a man  
I'm a man  
Man I'm a man  
  
I'm a man  
I'm a man  
I'm a man  
I'm a man  
I'm a man  
I'm a man  
Man I'm a man  
  
I'm a man  
I'm a man  
I'm a man  
Man I'm a man  
  
I'm a man  
I'm a man  
I'm a man
