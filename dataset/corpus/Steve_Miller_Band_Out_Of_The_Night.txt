Out of the night  
You came movin'  
Out of the night  
Movin' so cool  
Lookin' for a lover  
Lookin' for a friend  
You must surely be some new kind of cool  
Out of the night  
You came running  
Didn't have to baby  
But you just couldn't stop  
Said that you love me  
But you won't tell me why  
You better watch it  
Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it  
Pretty baby or you're gonna make me cry  
I wear my heart on my sleeve  
You know the one I love, I'll never leave  
I'm not blind to the shining light  
Of a heart that's true in the middle of the night  
Out of the night  
You came movin'  
Out of the night  
Movin' so cool  
Say that you love me but don't tell me why  
You got to want me, want me, want me  
Got to want me pretty baby  
Or you're gonna make me cry  
Take me for a lover, take me for a friend  
'cause you know if you do  
I will stay here with you to the end  
I wear my heart on my sleeve  
You know the one I love, I'll never leave  
I'm not blind to the shining light  
Of a heart that's true in the middle of the night  
Out of the night  
And into the dawn  
We keep movin', movin', movin', movin', movin'  
Pretty baby, we keep movin' on  
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow  
Or yesterday  
We got to live this life  
That we love from day to day to day to day to day
