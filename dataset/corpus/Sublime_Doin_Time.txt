[Chorus]  
Summertime and the livin's easy  
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras M.G.  
All the people in the dance will agree  
That we're well qualified to represent the LBC  
Me, and me and Louie run to the party  
Dance to the rhythm it gets harder.  
  
Me and my girl got this relationship.  
I love her so bad, but she treats me like shit  
On lock down like a penitentiary  
She spreads her loving' all over and when she comes home  
There's none left for me.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh take this veil from off my eyes  
A burning sun will someday rise  
What am I gonna be doing' for a wife  
Said I'm gonna play with myself  
Show them how we come off the shelf  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Evil  
I've come to tell you that she's evil  
Most definitely.  
Evil  
Ornery, scandalous, and evil  
Most definitely.  
  
The tension is getting hotter.  
I'd like to hold her head underwater.  
  
Me and my girl,  
Got a relationship  
  
Me and my girl,  
We've got a relationship  
  
My girl, got a relationship,  
Oh and my girl  
  
Take a tip, take a tip, take a t-t-t-t-t-tii-up.  
  
[Chorus]
