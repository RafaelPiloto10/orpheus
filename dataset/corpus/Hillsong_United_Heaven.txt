I need Your Love  
Like the desert needs the rain  
I need Your touch  
Like the fire needs the flame  
One moment without You near  
Is heartache I cannot bear  
A lifetime with You O Lord  
Is Heaven I long to Know  
Heaven  
Come over me  
Like the oceans meets the shore  
Shine on my life  
Like the morning  
Steals the night  
One moment without you near  
Is heartache I cannot bear  
A lifetime with you oh Lord  
Heaven I long to know  
Heaven
