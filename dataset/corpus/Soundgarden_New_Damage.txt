When new damage comes  
It's faceless poison  
A new world order  
It's new damage done  
  
The wreck is going down  
Get out before you drown  
The wreck is going down  
Get out before you drown  
Get out before you drown  
  
When new damage comes  
It's a word of plague  
A new world order  
A new world for hate  
  
The wreck is going down  
Get out before you drown  
The wreck is going down  
Get out before you drown
