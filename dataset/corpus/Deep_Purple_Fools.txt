I'm crying I'm dying  
  
I can see what's wrong with me  
It's in my head  
  
I can see what's gonna be  
As I lie in my bed  
  
Man is not my brotherhood  
I am of the dead  
  
I died as I lived as I loved and was born  
On some distant hill  
  
The reasons to hide were the reasons I cried  
Fools pass laughing still  
  
There can be bad blood in all I can see  
It's in my brain  
  
You don't know the pain I feel  
As I must live again  
  
Rocks and stones can't bruise my soul but  
Tears will leave a stain  
  
They smile to themselves as they lay down my head  
On some distant hill  
  
The blind and the child sweep a tear from their eye  
Fools smile as they kill  
  
I got my own way to go and now I want  
To take your minds  
  
I believe if you could see  
The blood between the lines  
  
I believe that you could be  
A better kind  
  
Please lead the way so the unborn can play  
On some greener hill  
  
Laugh as the flames eat their burning remains  
Fools die laughing still
