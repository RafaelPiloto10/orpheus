Take the lovebird, kiss the stranger  
Leave the trailer, take the car  
Feel the sound rushing over you  
Q E D  
See my finger, the way it points you  
Follow blindly into the road  
Feel the sound rushing over you  
Q E D  
See the stranger getting nearer  
Iron teardrop, collision course  
Feel the sound rushing over you  
Q E D  
See the blood now overflowing  
No more compression, compression done  
Feel the sound rushing over you  
Q E D  
I saw it happen, you saw it happen  
We saw it happen, it can't be true  
The stranger crashing into you  
I saw it happen, you saw it happen  
We saw it happen, it can't be true  
The stranger crashing into you  
The stranger crashing into you  
The stranger crashing into you  
The stranger crashing into you  
Into you  
Into you  
Into you  
...
