Not so long ago we were so in phase  
You and I could never forget the days  
But then the fire seemed to flicker  
Cold wind came and it carried us away  
But we'll get back someday, baby  
  
The dream is still alive  
Look here in my eyes  
Can you see what I'm feeling?  
The dream is still alive  
The one of you and I  
And my heartache is healing  
I couldn't let it die  
No I knew it would survive  
The dream is still alive  
  
Not so long ago in a purple haze  
People dreamed out loud they were not afraid  
They stopped the war but not the dying  
Some got a little bit lost along the way  
But somehow we're here today (And we say..)  
  
The dream is still alive  
After all this time  
The flame keeps on burning  
The dream is still alive  
The one of you and I  
And my heartache is healing  
I couldn't let it die  
No I knew it would survive  
The dream is, the dream is still alive  
  
Oh yeah..  
The dream is still alive  
Look here in my eyes  
Can you see what I'm feeling  
The dream is still alive  
The one of you and I  
And my heartache is healing  
I couldn't let it die  
For all the times we tried  
The dream is still alive
