Watching the news  
The plot you already know  
Don't have anything  
They don't belong to anywhere  
Imagining things to be perfectly white  
Who are these people?  
They don't belong  
Where's the u.s. navy?  
  
I like the action  
Money money  
Food here  
Woman woman  
Fight here  
Approval approval  
Frown frown  
Approval  
My daughter's not some damn hamburger chainsaw  
In a parking lot  
She trips  
Quick quick  
Won't somebody help me?  
  
She carries that television on her back  
As I watch the news  
That's the russians  
Carry the television  
Money money  
Carry the television  
Food here  
Fuck here  
Fuck here  
Fight here  
Get out  
Approval  
You don't count  
  
The president today announced that he's pushing all the buttons in a giggling
fit  
Ha ha ha ha  
You already know  
Makes you feel good  
Makes you feel so good  
I want to be on  
I want to be on  
So good crying  
I want to be on  
The news  
  
I want to be known  
I want to be known  
I want to be on  
I want to be known  
Come on everybody knows that everybody's watching the news  
  
Watching? watching?  
It's something about crime, crime, crime  
I like to watch  
But I like to  
What do you want?  
What do you want?  
What do you want?  
Legs rush, legs rush, legs rush, legs  
Scary, scary, damn scary  
Come all ye faithful ye joyful triumphant
