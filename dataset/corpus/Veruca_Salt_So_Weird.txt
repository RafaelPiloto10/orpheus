Speak  
You're speaking words  
But all I ever heard  
Is white noise from weird boys  
  
Space  
You're spacing out  
By the way  
What's that face about  
It's so weird  
It's so weird  
  
You don't know me  
You don't own me  
You're just poassing through my life  
You're a stranger  
With bad behavior  
You're so weird I'm terrified  
  
Back lounge  
A chain smoking Charlie Brown  
You're busted up  
And broken down  
So you're so low rent  
You're texting vegan sex again  
It's so weird  
It's so weird  
  
You don't know me  
You don't own me  
You're just passing through my life  
You're a stranger  
With bad behavior  
You're so weird I'm terrified  
  
Slowly, faintly  
Slowly, faintly  
Slowly, faintly  
Slowly, faintly  
  
You don't know me  
You don't own me  
You're just passing through my life  
You're a stranger  
With bad behavior  
You're so weird I'm terrified
