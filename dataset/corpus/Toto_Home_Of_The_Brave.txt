Every thing's gonna be alright boys, help is on the way  
Hold your head up high now, there's no need to cry now  
We're not running anymore  
  
Leave the politics behind boys, they're not working anymore  
There's so much more at stake here, it's make or break here  
Haven't we been here before - tell me what we're waiting for  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
You gotta remember, you don't have to be afraid  
You still have the freedom to learn, and say what you want to say  
You gotta remember, don't let 'em take away  
The land we call the home of the brave  
  
Who sings the song of the people, you don't hear it anymore  
I heard it late last summer, to the beat of a different drummer  
It never sounded quite like that before  
  
So you're trying to shake this feeling, that trouble's right outside the door  
You lie awake each dark night, like a time bomb wound up too tight  
A storm in waiting, just offshore - tell me what we're waiting for
