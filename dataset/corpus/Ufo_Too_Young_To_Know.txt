Well, I've stuck out in your street  
And I'm lookin' for some kind of halo  
When somebody says to me, boy  
She's too young to know  
  
[Chorus]  
Well, I didn't make your time  
I never said you were mine  
Don't you think you show  
I guess I'll have to teach you how to roll  
Met you outside school  
when sure no one was lookin'  
And your teacher looks at me,  
all his envy growin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I said, take it easy baby,  
you sure know what's showin'  
And I can't help myself  
without your friends all knowin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]  
You got a long, long way to go
