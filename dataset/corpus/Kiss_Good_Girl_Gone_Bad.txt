It ain't love, but it ain't so bad  
She ain't nothin' like you ever had  
Face of a woman, hands of a child, yeah  
Been a long time comin', now she's goin' wild  
  
Well I know she ain't the girl next door  
She ain't the girl she was before  
  
She's a good girl gone bad, one kiss can driv  
Good girl - come on - show me the way  
  
The girl can't help it, she's out of control  
I gotta have her, she's so hot to hold, yeah  
She's gettin' her way, but I'm havin' my fun  
Steamin' up the window with the radio on  
  
She ain't searchin', she knows the score, it ain't love she's lookin' for  
But now she's gone too far, she found love in the back of my car  
  
She's a good girl gone bad, one kiss can drive me mad  
Good girl - come on - show me the way  
She's a good girl gone bad, the best love I ever had  
Good girl - come on - take me away, oh, take me away, take me away  
  
She ain't searchin', she knows the score, it ain't love she's lookin' for  
But now she's gone too far, I know  
  
She's a good girl gone bad, one kiss can drive me mad  
Good girl, come on, show me the way  
She's a good girl gone bad, the best love I ever had  
Good girl, come on, take me away
