(But The Problem Is, This Time It's Mine)  
  
So many times I've seen  
So many people's dreams  
Lost and washed away  
Out to the sea, yeah  
  
I said "No, not I"  
Pain would surely pass me by  
Happening to them, but not to me, yeah  
  
Hearts get broken all the time oohhh  
Never used to worry about things like this  
(I wouldn't worry)  
But the trouble is (This time it's mine)  
Now I'm worrying (This one is mine)  
See the problem is the heart is mine  
  
Love would be all I'd need  
How naive could I be  
Trusting other people with my care, yeah  
  
Never thought I'd have to be  
One of love's casualties  
Up until now my belief was that love was fair  
  
Hearts get broken all the time oooh  
But I never worried 'bout things like this  
(I didn't worry)  
But the trouble is (This time it's mine)  
I keep worrying (This one is mine)  
See the problem is the heart is mine  
  
This time my heart's breaking  
This time my love's failing  
I'm trying hard not to be bitter now  
  
I never dreamed that the broken heart would be mine  
  
Hearts get broken all the time  
You think it's love, but it never really is  
Never could imagine a thing like that (I wouldn't worry)  
But the trouble is (This time it's mine)  
Got me worrying (This one is mine)  
See the problem is the heart is mine  
This is mine, this is mine, yeah  
  
Hearts get broken all the time  
Never cared a doggone thing about that (I didn't worry)  
But the trouble is (This time it's mine)  
And the problem really is (This one is mine)  
See the whole thing is the heart is mine  
  
This time it's mine  
This one is mine  
The heart is mine  
  
This time it's mine  
This one is mine  
The heart is mine  
  
This time it's mine  
This one is mine  
The heart is mine
