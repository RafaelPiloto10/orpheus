Once upon a time  
She was the virgin of a million lonely minds  
And now it's such a crying shame  
She does not even know her name  
No-one ever knew  
All the heavy changes she's been going through  
All the sons and lovers on her mind  
Cause easy money's hard to find  
  
I've been searching  
All night long  
You know, she's been searching all night long  
  
[Chorus]  
Easy money  
She gets down on her knees  
She's begging you please  
Cause she needs  
Easy money  
She's out on a run  
She needs someone can she please  
  
Nightmare rides  
A shadow limps across the great sunrise  
And steals the hope that lies behind her eyes  
In a sense it's hard to find  
  
I've been searching  
All Night long  
You know, she's been searching all night long  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Easy money  
  
Easy money  
She ain't no fool  
She's breaking her rule  
And she knows  
Easy money  
She's out on a run  
She's looking for someone who shows  
Easy money  
She's out on her own  
She's looking for someone to plead  
Easy money
