You've made up your mind  
It was time  
It was over  
After we had come so far  
But I think there's enough pieces of forgiveness  
Somewhere in my broken heart  
  
I would not have chosen the road you have taken  
It has left us miles apart  
Well I think I can still find a will to keep going  
Somewhere in my broken heart  
  
So fly  
Go ahead and fly  
Until you find out who you are  
'Cause I  
Will keep my love unspoken  
Somewhere in my broken heart  
  
I hope that in time  
You will find what you longed for  
Love that's written in the stars  
And when you finally do  
I think you'll see it  
Somewhere in my broken heart  
  
So fly  
Go ahead and fly  
Until you find out who you are  
'Cause I  
Will keep my love unspoken  
Somewhere in my broken heart  
  
I would not have chosen the road you have taken  
It has left us miles apart  
Well I think I can still find a will to keep going  
Somewhere in my broken heart  
  
Somewhere in my broken  
Somewhere in my broken heart
