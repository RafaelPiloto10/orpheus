I've been lookin' for a love  
Someone to hold as I lay sleeping  
I'm not talking about someone who's scared of promises or keeping up  
I'm just looking for a love to stand the test of time  
I've been lookin' for someone to be all mine  
  
I had too much lonely  
I need a one and only  
Someone I can care about and call my own  
Well in true tradition  
Without an intermission  
We'll still be together when the kids are grown.  
  
I've been lookin for a love  
Someone to hold as I lay sleeping  
I'm not talking about someone who's scared of promises or keeping up  
I'm just lookin' for a love to stand the test of time  
I've been looking for someone to be all mine.

I've been lookin for a love  
Someone to hold as I lay sleeping  
I'm not talking about someone who's scared of promises or keeping up  
I' m just looking for a love to stand the test of time  
I've been looking for someone to be all mine.  
  
I've been looking for some one to be all mine.  
I've been looking for some one to be all mine.  
I've been looking for some one to be all mine.  
  
I've been lookin for a love  
Someone to hold as I lay sleeping  
I'm not talking about someone who's scared of promises or keeping up  
I' m just looking for a love to stand the test of time  
I've been looking for someone to be all mine.
