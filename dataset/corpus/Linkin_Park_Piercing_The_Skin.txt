I look around...  
I look around...  
I look around and I see myself  
I look around and I see myself  
I'm piercing the skin  
  
Chorus  
I'm piercing the skin  
One more time, I'm piercing the skin  
Its going deeper through the skin  
Going down, going down  
Go.. In.. Down!  
  
I turn around and I look at myself  
I see the blood on the floor  
I see the cut on my arm  
I ask myself why  
  
Chorus  
I'm piercing the skin  
One more time, I'm piercing the skin  
Its going deeper through the skin  
Going down, going down  
Go.. In.. Down!  
  
Its hard to find you when your not around  
I know that your here smiling down  
You look at me and I look at you  
But nothing you can say or do  
Compares to the pain that I felt  
When you said we would go our seperate ways
