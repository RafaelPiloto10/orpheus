Kick off your shoes, throw away your blues  
You paid your dues, Noah  
  
Summer is here, why interfere  
Go drink a beer, Noah  
  
You must realize that you need something  
Resynthesize your own ego  
You must recognise that life's just a circle  
So let's go on with the show  
  
Hoist up your sail, go kill a whale  
Don't look so pale, Noah  
One two three four  
  
Now let's go on with the show  
  
Kennan was right, you're black and white  
You're left and right, Noah  
Remember old Cain, it's all in vein  
It's starting to rain, Noah
