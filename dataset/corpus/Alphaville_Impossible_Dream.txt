Sometimes it feels so strange  
The way I feel for you  
It makes my life so quiet and free  
And when you smile at me  
It's just that special love  
A kind of liberty I've never felt before  
  
And I don't need to be a poet  
I don't need to be a hero  
When all I need to do is keep on  
Loving you  
  
I just have to be me  
And I don't need to be  
The stranger anymore I used to be  
In my impossible dream  
  
I keep my fingers crossed  
I never want to lose  
This new found world that's so alive, Angel  
I'm so in love with you  
  
My heart has circled in the past  
The demons of deceit but now  
Aside I've cast  
  
And I don't need to be a poet  
I don't need to be hero  
When all I need to do is keep on  
Loving you  
  
I just have to be me  
And I don't need to be  
The stranger anymore I used to be  
In my impossible dream
