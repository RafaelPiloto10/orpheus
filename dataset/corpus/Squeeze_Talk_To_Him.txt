Give me a plate and I'd break it  
Show me a smile and I'd cry  
Give me your love and I'd hate it  
Tell me the truth and I'd lie  
Give me a crust and I'd burn it  
Show me the way and I'd shout  
Give me a page and I'd turn it  
Well you could never put me down  
  
Misunderstood like a cockroach  
(As tasty as a crab)  
Who just tries to live for the day  
(My world's on my back)  
People won't need to be frightened  
(As frightened as I am)  
Excepting I was born this way  
  
Don't sweep me under the carpet  
(Tomorrow I'll be there)  
Don't file me away for my sins  
(There's some I can repair)  
Friends are now beginning to say  
(So pleased with their despair)  
How come I don't talk to him  
I didn't talk to him  
  
Give me an egg and I'd suck it  
Show me the sun and I'd freeze  
Give me a nest and some honey  
Keep all the birds and the bees, please  
Helplessness under my wing  
People said don't talk to him
