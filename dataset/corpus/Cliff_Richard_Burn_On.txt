You light the light in my dark places  
The brightest smile in a sea of faces  
Oh you watched me  
You calmed me down just when I thought  
I'd drown  
You lit a flame inside  
I don''t know how  
But they cannot turn the light out on me now  
  
You put a song in my dark silence  
You moved my feet when I could not dance  
And you caught me just when I fell  
You stilled my hell of storms  
You coloured all my greys  
I don't know how  
And they cannot turn the light out on me now  
  
CHORUS Burn on, oh lovely light  
Burn on, there goes the night  
Burn on till all the universe is shining in your light  
Burn on, burn on, burn on
