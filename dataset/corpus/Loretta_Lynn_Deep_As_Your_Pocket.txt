You're tellin' me she loves you what a laugh  
The funny thing is baby you don't know the half  
If you've got any money honey you better put it in the safe and lock it  
Cause her love for you's just deep as your pocket  
She's a stupid girl in a fifty dollar dress  
She wouldn't think about wearin' anything that costs much less  
I can see she rows a boat but little ol' me's gonna rock it  
Cause her love for you's just deep as your pocket  
Yeah her love for you's just deep as your pocket  
She's got you blown up like a baloon but I'm a gonna pop it  
She can't love you like I do but don't let me to drop it  
Cause her love for you's just deep as your pocket  
[ dobro - steel ]  
Yeah her love for you's...  
Yeah her love for you's just deep as your pocket
