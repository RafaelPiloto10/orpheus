(Dale Parker)  
As far as I'm concerned I don't believe the words  
They say about you as far as I'm concerned  
I think it's time they learn that nothing I have heard  
Could make me doubt you as far as I'm concerned.  
As far as I'm concerned I'd rather be unhappy dear with you  
Than to look for happiness with someone new  
For always in my heart there'll be a flame that burns  
For you alone dear as far as I'm concerned.  
As far as I'm concerned I'd rather be unhappy dear with you  
Than to look for happiness with someone new  
For always in my heart there'll be a flame that burns  
For you alone dear as far as I'm concerned...
