Don't call her up, anymore  
Cos I don't wanna hear your voice  
I don't wanna see your face answer her door.  
Make no mistake, she's mine, she's mine.  
  
She only knows how I feel  
I only know what she's like when she needs me  
Oh how she needs me deep in the night  
Make no mistake, she's mine, no, she's mine.  
  
Don't get too close when you dance  
Cos I don't wanna heart from my friends  
You were out of the town  
With her in your arms.  
  
Don't include her in your dreams  
Cos I don't wanna close my eyes  
No, I don't wanna know where she goes  
Each night when she leaves  
Make no mistake, she's mine, no, she's mine ..  
  
Don't call her up, anymore ...
