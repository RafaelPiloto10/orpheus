Your existence is a script,  
Life for you is a perfomance,  
Play out the leading role.  
Directing and premeditating every move  
That creates the act of manipulation  
Mastering the art of deception.  
That increases your sick addiction  
It's an overactive imagination  
That enslaves your empty shell  
  
Existing in dimensions of addictive obsession  
  
Your script will run short of ideas  
The story will soon end itself  
People to trust come short in number.  
Like a plague your lies spread  
Fast across the world  
Mastering the art of deception  
That increases your sick addition  
It's an overactive imagination  
That enslaves your empty shell
