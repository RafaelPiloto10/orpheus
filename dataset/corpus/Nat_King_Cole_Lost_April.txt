Lost April  
Where did you go?  
Like winter's snow  
I saw you vanish  
Lost April  
so soft and warm  
a memory not even time can vanish  
  
Lost April  
that taught me this  
a single kiss  
could lead to heaven  
but April had numbered days  
so when they passed  
love couldn't last  
I lost love and you and April too.  
  
strings  
  
so when they passed  
love couldn't last  
I lost love and you and April too.
