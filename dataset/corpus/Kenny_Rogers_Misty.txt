Look at me  
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree  
Ah, I'm walkin' on a cloud  
I can't understand, Lord  
I'm misty holdin' your hand  
  
Walk my way  
And a thousand violins begin to play  
Or it might be the sound of your "hello"  
That music I hear, Lord  
I'm misty the moment you're near  
  
You can say that you're leadin' me on  
But it's just what I want you to do  
Don't ya notice how hopelessly I'm lost  
That's why I'm followin' you  
  
Ooh, on my own  
Should I wander through this wonderland alone, now  
Never knowin' my right foot from my left  
My hat from my glove, Lord  
I'm misty, and too much in love

Never knowin' my right foot from my left  
My hat from my glove, Lord  
I'm misty, and too much in love  
  
(Misty) too much in love  
(Misty) too much in love  
(Misty)  
(Misty) too much in love...
