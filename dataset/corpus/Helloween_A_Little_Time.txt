Higher  
It's what I expect from my life  
It's like a wire  
That holds me back down to the ground  
  
Oh, I hear you say  
"That is the way of the world"  
No, hear what I say  
"I want to do so much in my way"  
  
Higher  
I've set my limits and bounds  
There's a fire  
It's burning so hot in my head  
  
Oh, I hear you say  
"That is the way of the world"  
No, hear what I say  
"I want to do so much in my way"  
  
[Chorus]  
We got  
A little time to build up your lives  
A little time to make up our minds  
A little time to fill up our dreams  
A little time, time  
  
[Chorus]
