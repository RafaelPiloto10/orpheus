If it should please you, I have come to play  
A glad or a sad tune, I wrote along the way  
And a few good songs about the old highway  
I been around so long, Lord, I guess, I'm here to stay  
So I'm itching to please you with a topical song  
And a few golden oldies and a little hoedown  
And I think, I know how to make you feel  
We're one and the same now like a big flywheel  
I have seen the best of all those things you can't explain  
Wanderlust, I did not trust but I never did complain  
So if it should please you, put away those blues  
Just settle on back now, I'll do my licks for you  
It's my own way and that's the way it goes  
You're a real good reason for a real good show  
I have seen the best of all those things you don't forget  
Wanderlust, I did not trust and I ain't been done in yet  
So if you got the dead end of the dealing shoe  
This is your last chance, man, we belong to you  
It's my own way and that's the way I feel  
We're one and the same now like a big flywheel  
So if it should please you, I have come to play  
A glad or a sad tune, I wrote along the way  
And a few good songs about the old highway  
I been around so long, Lord, I guess, I'm here to stay  
We're one and the same now, let's take it away  
We're gonna take it real easy, let's take it away  
We're gonna take it real easy, take it away  
We're gonna take it real easy
