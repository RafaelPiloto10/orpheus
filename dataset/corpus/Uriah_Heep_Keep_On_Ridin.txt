By tomorrow morning  
At the early dawn  
I gotta hit the road  
So long lady  
Till another day, right now  
I gotta be movin' on  
There's another town and  
The singer needs a song  
I know you're on your own  
I'll be back before too long  
I gotta do what I gotta do  
And you know how  
My heart loves to run, I gotta ride  
  
Keep on ridin'  
Keep on ridin' now  
  
There's a city waiting  
And a railroad station  
Where my face is known  
And an old hotel  
That I know so well  
It's a little bit like home  
It's a situation  
Not of my own choosing  
And though a gamblin' man  
Would say that I was losing  
I started out to win  
And I'll do it again  
I'm never givin' in  
'Cause if it comes down  
To my heart, or to my pride  
I'm gonna ride  
  
Keep on ridin', keep on ridin'  
Keep on ridin', yeah  
Keep on ridin', keep on ridin'  
  
And I know you say  
I'm driftin', driftin' on a dream  
You'd better watch your step boy  
It may not be what it seems  
I just can't shake  
This feeling here inside  
This heart of mine  
Keeps tellin' me to ride, ride, ride
