I got a feeling  
Of unrighteousness  
Bitter cold  
Hollow bitterness  
Down the road  
I walk with loneliness  
Mercy will follow me I'm told  
  
My sister sang  
A song so sweet and sad  
About a man  
Whose love I never had  
But there is a train  
Bound for Gilliad  
And mercy will follow me, I'm told  
  
Mercy will you follow me  
Mercy will you follow me  
To my final breath, the last I take  
Mercy will you follow me  
Mercy will you follow me  
Till the chains of this old world I finally break  
  
Under this skin  
There lies a heart of stone  
It's growing old  
So very far from home  
But a heart of gold  
I may one day own  
And mercy will follow me, I'm told  
  
Mercy will you follow me  
Mercy will you follow me  
Till my final breath, the last I take  
Mercy will you follow me  
Mercy will you follow me  
Till the chains of this old world I finally break, oh  
Till the chains of this old world I finally break, oh  
Till the chains of this old world I finally break
