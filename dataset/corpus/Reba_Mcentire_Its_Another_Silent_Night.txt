Silence is golden  
When the one that you're holding  
Means more then love words can say  
But what I don't hear  
From you makes me fear  
That our love is slipping away  
  
The quiet's so loud  
It fills up the house  
With words that can't be set free  
So who'll break the curse  
And say the first word  
Well I don't know  
We're not talking you see  
  
[Chorus]  
It's another silent night  
It's a cold war of who's wrong or right  
Nobody's winning this unspoken fight  
It's another silent night  
  
If we could just talk  
And tear down the wall  
That stands there between our hearts  
We could put back together  
Our love for each other  
Before it all falls apart  
  
[Chorus: x2]
