I had a dog he was a mix  
He loved me like a God  
But I was just a kid  
The kind mother likes  
Now I'm big like the sky  
And I'm down sized inside  
I'll put this all to rest  
I'm just a baby who looks like a boy  
I'm getting all depressed  
I'm just a baby who looks like a boy  
  
I got my father's sense  
And my big brother's pants  
And I look like a man  
And I feel like an ant  
Just a speck on the ground  
Growing like a weed  
A fleck of a seed  
  
I'll put my hand in flames  
I'm just a baby who looks like a boy  
Feels like I'm born again  
I'm just a baby who looks like a boy  
I'm just a baby who looks like a boy  
  
And I'll keep hanging from your hair  
And I'll keep playing in the sand  
Just as long as I can
