Life brings on unexpected changes  
But we must carry on despite it  
Are we gonna try  
Are we gonna make it  
Why is love so very hard  
Why is peace so very far  
I can't make it  
  
The future of our space and time  
Is not gonna wither and die  
The future of our space and time  
Is not gonna say goodbye  
  
We can't control all our situations  
And we can't console underpriviledged  
Nations  
So why don't we try  
To make more smiling faces  
We're so full of disregards  
We feel pain within our hearts  
I can't take it  
  
The future of our space and time  
Is not gonna wither and die  
The future of our space and time  
Is not gonna say goodbye  
  
So I'm calling out  
Out to all he races  
We can't gain control  
Without communication  
And we need to learn for future generations  
There is a future in our stars  
There is beauty that is ours  
We're gonna make it  
  
The future of our space and time  
Is not gonna wither and die  
The future of our space and time  
Is not gonna say goodbye
