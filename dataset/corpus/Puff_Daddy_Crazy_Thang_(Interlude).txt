Stop  
Just  
Come on now  
Just  
  
Sometimes I just  
Get out ya  
I just feel so confused  
No don't do that  
I just wanna know how you feel  
Don't do it  
I love you  
Mother fucker do you know what you've done  
I've always needed you  
But I really love her  
You see, love is a crazy thing  
At first it feels so good  
[Laughter]  
And you would think  
It last forever  
But then it also hurts so bad  
You know somethin',  
I hate ya fuckin' guts  
Leave me the fuck alone  
Then what you do  
Do you give up?  
Or do you believe?  
I'll always love you
