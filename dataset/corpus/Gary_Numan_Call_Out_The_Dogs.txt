Here am I  
Like a target in flesh  
One more time  
For you to call out the dogs  
Passengers  
With a ticket to burn and burn and burn  
You will learn  
I'm still waiting for you you know  
  
I'm a slogan, an old story,  
A disease, never again  
I don't like this, new anger,  
These young boys, just make me laugh  
This picture, I'm so nervous,  
The DJ, says 'who are you?'  
Look at me, I'm shaking,  
I don't know if I can move  
  
I don't need  
This attention again  
I've lost time  
I could lose everything  
You will learn  
That you've nowhere to go so go
