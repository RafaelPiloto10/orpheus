Well I woke up this morning  
Took your advice  
I dialed the number  
And I let it ring twice  
Then I hung up  
  
Now I tried to do  
Everything I could  
To save our love  
And make it feel good again  
  
I can't fight it, there's nobody home  
Hard hearted and all alone  
I give you love, you ain't giving it back  
I can't take it  
  
I need to see the soul doctor  
Before the fever begins  
You know I'm searching for the soul doctor  
When love is wearing thin  
Doctor soul is in  
  
I've been kicked in the corner  
I'm down in the dirt  
I can't feel a thing  
But I know it ought to hurt  
  
Now your shaking my spirit  
I'm breaking my back  
I'm too blind to hear it  
So I over react to satisfaction  
If I could get me some  
  
I ain't talking, there's nothing to say  
Misunderstandin', your walking away  
Maybe baby, it's gonna take time, time, time  
  
I need to see the soul doctor  
Before the fever begins  
You know I'm searching for the soul doctor  
When love is wearing thin  
Doctor soul is in  
  
I need to see the soul doctor  
You know things are looking grim  
I keep searching for the soul doctor  
Doctor soul is in  
  
The doctor's soul intention  
Let it be understood  
Can't pull the strings of my heart  
I ain't made out of wood  
  
Now I take what I get  
To get what it takes  
Need a little bit a love  
Got a whole lotta heartaches  
  
I can't fight it, there's nobody home  
Hard hearted and all alone  
Maybe baby, it's gonna take time, time, time  
  
I need to see the soul doctor  
Before the fever begins  
You know I'm searching for the soul doctor  
When love is wearing thin  
Doctor soul is in  
  
I need to see the soul doctor  
You know things are looking grim  
I keep searching for the soul doctor  
Doctor soul is in  
  
Hey, a little bit of soul, oh yeah  
Doctor soul is in  
Heart and soul doctor  
I need to see the soul doctor, soul doctor  
Doctor soul is in  
Doctor, doctor, doctor, doctor save my soul  
Doctor soul is in  
Ooh
