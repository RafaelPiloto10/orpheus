Can't get the stink off  
He's been hanging round for days  
Comes like a comet  
Suckered you but not your friends  
One day he'll get to you  
And teach you how to be a holy cow  
  
You do it to yourself, you do  
And that's what really hurts  
Is that you do it to yourself  
Just you and no one else  
You do it to yourself  
You do it to yourself  
  
Don't get my sympathy  
Hanging out the 15th floor  
You've changed the locks three times  
He still comes reeling through the door  
One day I'll get you  
And teach you how to get to purest hell  
  
You do it to yourself, you do  
And that's what really hurts  
Is that you do it to yourself  
Just you, you and no one else  
You do it to yourself  
You do it to yourself  
  
You do it to yourself, you do  
And that's what really hurts  
Is that you do it to yourself  
Just you, you and no one else  
You do it to yourself  
You do it to yourself, yourself, yourself
