I can only speak for  
The things that I've been through  
So when it comes to our love  
I'll talk the whole night through  
About the love I've been missin'  
Lately, baby I ain't had no kissin'  
Don't you love me  
Can't we stay together  
  
Like when we used to be in love  
But now you've got your head on another cloud  
Girl, we had a good thing  
But now you've turned around  
Don't you care how this love we've had turns out  
  
Promise me you'll leave me never  
And that we'll be in love forever  
Promise me you'll leave me never  
And that we'll be in love forever  
  
We can work at our love  
And make it all brand-new  
If we stay together  
There's nothing we can't do  
Improve the lovin' is what I'm seeing  
Let's do it baby  
Don't fight the feeling  
Won't you love me  
Can't we stay together
