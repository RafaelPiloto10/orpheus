Aching, longing  
Save all your hands for me  
'Cause I won't share them  
With anything, anyone, no  
  
I grew from you  
Branches from a dying tree  
But I could save you  
If only you looked for me  
  
You can't break me  
I'm a piggy bank on the floor  
Watch all my spare change  
Roll out the door  
Watch all my spare change  
Roll across the floor  
Watching me through  
Your glass door...  
  
Save your smile for  
Everybody else you see  
'Cause I don't want the  
One that you make for me  
  
You can't break me  
I'm a piggy bank on the floor  
Watch all my spare change  
Roll out the door  
Watch all my spare change  
Roll across the floor  
Watching me through  
Your glass door...  
Your door...  
  
The more that I've tried  
The more that you've pried  
Yourself away...
