Sitting by the telephone  
Waiting for a bell to ring  
I don't want another call  
I just want to hold you  
I'm givin' my everything  
Givin' all my time  
So darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin' call  
Won't you call me boy  
I'll go anywhere you want  
I'll be anything you say  
All I want is to feel your arms around me  
I'm givin' my everything  
Givin' all my time  
So darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin' please  
(Won't you)  
CHORUS:  
Stay with me baby  
Stay here for a little while  
Won't you say you'll stay here for the night  
Stay right here with me sweet baby  
Stay here for a little while  
For a while  
I'm sitting at my window  
And I look  
Where are you  
I wonder if you even know  
You belong to me  
No matter where you roam  
You've got to take me  
I'm givin' my everything  
Givin' all my time  
So darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin' please  
(Won't you)  
Even if I have to wait all night  
I don't even care  
I've waited all my life  
Let me love you  
I'm givin' my everything  
Givin' all my time  
So darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin' please  
(Won't you)
