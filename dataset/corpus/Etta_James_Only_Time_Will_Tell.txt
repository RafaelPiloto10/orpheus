I just needed someone, somebody to hold  
When the bottle was empty  
And the nights grew cold  
In my hour of darkness  
  
In my time of need  
You were my angel of mercy  
And helped me to believe  
You touched my soul  
  
When I was lonely  
You held me up  
When I couldn't fly  
There's no words could explain  
  
How I feel inside  
And this I tell you  
In a world full of anger  
In times gone strange  
  
You held me close  
You held me close to you  
Lay my head on your shoulder  
I finally let it all out  
  
It felt good for a moment  
Not living in a shadow of doubt  
But everybody needs a little something  
To pull them through  
  
I gave one for the other  
And God know that the other was you  
Now only time will tell  
Only time will tell  
  
If our love is scratched in sand  
Or if it's etched in stone  
Only time will tell  
Only time will tell  
  
If our love will stand  
Or walk the road alone  
My angel of mercy  
Pulled me through somehow  
  
I just hope you know  
I need you now  
You're the one  
That touched my very soul  
  
The one who held on tight  
God knows you never let go  
Now only time will tell  
Only time will tell  
  
If our love is scratched in sand  
Or if it's etched in stone  
Only time will tell  
Only time will tell  
  
If our love will stand  
Or walk the road alone  
Only time will  
Only time will  
  
(Can you bring my hands to yours)  
Only time will tell  
(Can you teach my soul to fly)  
  
Only time will  
Only time will  
(Can you save me)  
  
Only time will tell  
Angel of mercy  
It's time we closed the door  
Put out the lights  
  
And burn the fire  
Burn the fire inside  
Angel of mercy
