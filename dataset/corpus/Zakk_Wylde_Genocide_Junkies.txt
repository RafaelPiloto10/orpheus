Loaded, stormin' out of control  
Fired up, hell ridin' we roll  
Drinkin' from the well of the damned  
Seize the roads, assault the land  
Respect through fear  
Walkin' tall  
Beyond unreal  
Ohh, always up for the ride  
Ohh, junkies of the genocide  
Risin' always above  
Hell ridin' never enough  
The rush of the chrome to reign supreme  
Pistons of torture, crucifixion of speed  
Respect through fear  
Walkin' tall  
Beyond unreal  
Ohh, always up for the ride  
Ohh, junkies of the genocide  
Ohh, always up for the ride  
Ohh, junkies of the genocide  
Intimidation, degradation  
Loomin' large, desecration  
Bury the old game, worship the insane  
Tomorrow will soon be here  
Immune to fear, the end is never here  
Hell ridin' the gears of life  
Intimidation, degradation  
Loomin' large, desecration  
Ohh, always up for the ride  
Ohh, junkies of the genocide  
Ohh, always up for the ride  
Ohh, junkies of the genocide
