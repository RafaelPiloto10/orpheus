Lir: I've had time to write a book  
About the way you act and look  
But I haven't got a paragraph  
Words are always getting in my way  
Anyway, I love you  
That's all I have to tell you  
That's all I've got to say  
  
And now, I'd like to make a speech  
About the love that touches each  
But stumbling, I would make you laugh  
I feel as though my tongue were made of clay  
Anyway, I love you  
That's all I have to tell you  
  
I'm not a man of poetry  
Music isn't one with me  
It runs from me  
It runs from me  
(Duet)  
Lir: And I tried to write a symphony  
Amalthea: Once when I was searching  
Lir: But I lost the melody  
Amalthea: Somewhere out of reach  
Lir: Alas I only finished half  
Amalthea: Far away  
Lir: And finish I suppose I never may  
Amalthea: In a place I could not find  
Lir: Anyway, I love you  
Amalthea: Or heart obey  
Lir: That's all I have to tell you  
Amalthea: Now that I'm a woman  
Lir: That's all I've got to say  
Amalthea: Now I know the way  
Lir: That's all I've got to say  
Amalthea: Now I know the way  
Together: That's all I've got to say
