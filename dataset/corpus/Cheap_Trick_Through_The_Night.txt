You don't have to hide  
All the things you say or feel inside  
I can always tell that love is alive  
When I look in your eyes  
With just one kiss you see the ways of love  
  
Through the night, through the night, through the night  
I'll help you make it feel alright  
Through the night, through the night  
Let me help you make it through the night  
  
Time is on our side  
Never had to wait for reasons why  
Two can play this game better than one  
Alone in the night  
Oh, and you could see a world of love  
  
Through the night, through the night, through the night  
I'll help you make it feel alright  
Through the night, through the night  
Let me help you make it through the night  
  
Don't blow it away  
'Coz you can't deny the love inside  
Oh baby, don't be afraid  
  
Been said a million times before  
Gonna say it once again  
You will see a world of love through the night  
  
Through the night, through the night  
Let me help you make it through the night  
  
Through the night, through the night, through the night  
I'll help you make it feel alright  
Through the night, through the night  
Let me help you make it through the night  
  
Through the night, through the night, through the night  
I'll help you make it through the night  
Through the night, through the night  
Let me help you make it through the night
