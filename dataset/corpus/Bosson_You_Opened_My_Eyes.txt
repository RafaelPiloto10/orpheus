You opened my eyes  
You make me believe  
That there is a chance for a guy like me.  
You opened my eyes  
To a whole new world for me.  
Baby don't you know  
That all I wanted was to be by your side  
To find a way to the light through the dark.  
You saw the man that I was deep inside... ah huh...  
There's a voice,  
That was screamin' inside of my head  
But I was quiet and peaceful instead.  
Yes I have learnt from the things that you said... ah huh...  
[Chorus]  
You opened my eyes  
You make me believe  
That there is a chance for a guy like me.  
You opened my eyes,  
You showed me someone that no one else can see.  
You opened my eyes  
You bring me the sun.  
You make me believe I am someone.  
You opened my eyes  
To a whole new world for me.  
I was lost,  
I was scared I was losing my mind.  
Running away from myself all the time,  
Coz there was something I was waiting to find... ah huh...  
There you were, coz God has sent me an angel from above.  
You gave me strength, and you showed me how to love,  
For that, I'm thankful for the rest of my life... ah huh...  
You opened my eyes  
You make me believe  
That there is a chance for a guy like me.  
You opened my eyes,  
You showed me someone that no one else can see.  
You opened my eyes  
You bring me the sun,  
You make me believe I am someone.  
You opened my eyes,  
To a whole new world for me.  
Now you're gone  
And though it hurts to know you're with someone new,  
You know I always wanted the best for you.  
You deserve to get the best in life too,  
I'm grateful for the time with you...  
Oooh...  
You opened my eyes  
You make me believe  
That there is a chance for a guy like me.  
You opened my eyes  
You showed me someone that no one else can see.  
You opened my eyes  
You bring me the sun,  
You make me believe I am someone.  
You opened my eyes  
To a whole new world for me.  
You opened my eyes...  
You opened my eyes...  
You opened my eyes...  
You opened my eyes...
