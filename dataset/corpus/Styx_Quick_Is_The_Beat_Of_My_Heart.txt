if it's my time to die today  
please God oh make it fast  
balanced on this point for a year and half  
I just don't think I can last  
  
there's a man who's laid to rest  
the man who gave me my start  
I wish I could quit but I can't and it's rough  
quick is the beat of my heart  
quick is the beat of my heart  
  
so please all you people  
don't you grieve for me  
the blood in my veins is black and I can't bleed  
  
I've suffered the pain  
and all I can face is the dark  
oh, Lord, quick is the beat of my heart  
quick is the beat of my heart  
  
now my bags are almost packed  
the train's about to depart  
I wish I could quit but I can't and it's rough  
quick is the beat of my heart  
quick is the beat of my heart  
quick is the beat of my heart  
quick is the beat of my heart  
quick is the beat of my heart  
quick is the beat of my heart  
  
if it's my time to die...
