[Intro]  
I'm comin' up,  
So you better get this party started.  
I'm comin' up,  
So you better get this party started.  
  
[Verse 1]  
Get this party started on a Saturday night,  
Everybody's waitin' for me to arrive.  
Sendin' out the message to all of my friends,  
We'll be lookin' flashy in my Mercedes Benz.  
I got lotsa style, check my gold diamond rings,  
I can go for miles, if you know what I mean  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm comin' up,  
So you better get this party started.  
(I'm comin' up, I'm comin')  
I'm comin' up,  
So you better get this party started.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Pumpin' up the volume, breakin' down to the beat,  
Cruisin' through the west side, we'll be checkin' the scene.  
Boulevard is freakin' as I'm comin' up fast,  
I'll be burnin' rubber, you'll be kissing my ass.  
Pull up to the bumper, get out of the car  
License plate says, stunner one number Superstar.  
  
I[Chorus]  
I'm comin' up,  
So you better get this party started.  
(I'm comin' up, I'm comin')

[Verse 3]  
Makin' my connection as I enter the room,  
Everybody's chillin' as I set up the groove.  
Pumpin' up the volume with this brand new beat,  
Everybody's dancin' and they're dancin' for me.  
I'm your operator, you can call anytime,  
I'll be your connection to the party line.  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm comin' up,  
So you better get this party started.  
(I'm comin' up, I'm comin')

So you better get this party started.  
Get this party started.  
  
[Outro]
