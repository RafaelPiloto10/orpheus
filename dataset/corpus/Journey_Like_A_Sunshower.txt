Girl, tell me what's wrong  
Are those tears in your eyes  
What's going on between us  
I'm ready to listen  
I don't care if it takes all night  
We both said something we didn't mean  
We lost our heads  
Now I can't sleep  
'Til you talk to me  
We find the sun through the rain  
Caught in a sunshower  
We'll be all right, no one's to blame  
After the storm, we'll shine  
So rare you and me disagree  
Love's like a sunshower  
When you meet me, babe  
Somewhere halfway, yeah  
It's been way too long  
Since we shared what's in our hearts  
Let's say this charade is over  
Ooh, we can't take for granted  
How far we've come  
Let's not lose each other  
I know you care, 'cause you stand your ground  
When we talked enough  
I wanna make up  
Wanna make love  
We find the sun through the rain  
Caught in a sunshower  
We'll be alright  
No one's to blame  
After the storm, we'll shine  
So rare you and me disagree  
Love's like a sunshower  
Baby, babe  
Somewhere we'll find  
We won't regret  
We won't forget  
Rainbows wait for you and me  
Girl, we're caught in a sunshower  
When we've talked enough  
Can we make up  
Can we make love, ooh  
Yeah
