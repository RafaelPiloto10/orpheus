Would it be asking too much of you  
To let me stay tonight  
Until I find my way back home again  
Life's been so simple lately  
I don't want to go away  
There is precious little left for me to say  
  
I've go nowhere else to turn  
Will you help me tonight  
There's no-one to stand in our way  
I just want to feel needed  
Won't you give me a chance  
I know that you want me to stay  
  
And there's no need to be disguising all your feelings  
Cos I can't leave you alone  
I've got nowhere else to turn  
  
Would it be taking a liberty  
In loving you tonight  
I just want to hold you close again  
I get so lonely sometimes  
Then I think of you  
There is precious little else that I can do  
  
I've go nowhere else to turn  
Will you help me tonight  
There's no-one to stand in our way  
I just want to feel needed  
Won't you give me a chance  
I know that you want me to stay  
  
I've go nowhere else to turn  
Will you help me tonight  
There's no-one to stand in our way  
I just want to feel needed  
Won't you give me a chance  
I know that you want me to stay  
  
And there's no need to be disguising all your feelings  
Cos I can't leave you alone  
I've got nowhere else to turn  
  
Would it be taking a liberty
