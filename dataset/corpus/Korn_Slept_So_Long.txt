Walking, waiting  
Alone without a care  
Hoping and hating  
The things I can't bare  
Did you think it's cool to walk right up  
To take my life and fuck it up  
Well did you, well did you  
  
[Chorus:]  
I see hell in your eyes  
Taken in by surprise  
Touching you makes me feel alive  
Touching you makes me die inside  
  
Walking, waiting  
Alone without a care  
Hoping and hating  
The things I can't bare  
Did ya think it's cool to walk right up  
And take my life and fuck it  
Well did you  
  
I hate you!  
  
[Chorus: Repeat]  
  
I've slept so long without you  
It's tearing me apart too  
How did you get this far  
Playing games with this old heart  
I've killed a million petty souls  
But I couldn't kill you  
I've slept so long with out you  
  
[Chorus: Repeat x2]
