It's a heartache  
And the happiness  
That won't let you rest  
It's a pleasure  
  
And the pain that comes  
When you love someone  
You spend so much time  
Trying to get it right  
  
Don't ask the reason why  
It's a part of life  
  
[Chorus]  
Our love can be difficult at times  
But it was by design  
Our love was difficult at times  
But it was by design  
  
It's a laughter  
Beyond the tears  
That you need to hear  
But you know that  
You can make it through  
When a love is true  
It feels like a lonely road  
You don't know which way to go  
How I want you to know  
You are not alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love is difficult  
But it's by design  
Love is difficult  
But it's by design  
  
Love is difficult  
But it's by design  
Love is difficult  
But it's by design  
  
[Repeat Chorus]
