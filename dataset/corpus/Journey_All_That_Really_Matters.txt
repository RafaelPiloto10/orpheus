Have you heard the news  
They're tryin' to turn the world upside down  
We sit and watch it on TV  
Programmed prophets trying to bring us down  
  
Give us a break now  
We know it can't all be bad news  
Let's get away now

The time is now  
For taking our own chances  
We're all, all that really matters  
  
More brain power  
Just to keep alive  
Some computer trying to shut you down  
The world powers watchin' the way you live  
On a mission pushing us around  
  
Give us a break now  
No way we're gonna lose  
We'll find a way now  
Cause when I'm making love to you  
  
We're all, we're all that really matters  
The time is now  
For taking our own chances  
We're all, all that really matters  
  
I want to love you  
I'm gonna try to make it right  
Nothing can touch you  
We'll make a dream come true tonight  
  
We're all, we're all that really matters  
The time is now  
For taking our own chances  
We're all, all that really matters

We're all, all that really matters
