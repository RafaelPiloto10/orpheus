Shrivel-up  
Well it's a god-given fact (that  
You can't go back)  
It's a god-given law that  
You're gonna lose your maw  
It's a god-given fact you gotta  
Buy 'em by the sack  
It's a god-given law that  
You're gonna get small  
May be just another rap but  
You're running out of sap  
Well you better take the rap  
Dying under daddy's cap  
It's at the top of the list  
That you can't get pissed  
It's rule number one living right isn't fun  
Time-tested and true you  
Gotta pooty poo-poo
