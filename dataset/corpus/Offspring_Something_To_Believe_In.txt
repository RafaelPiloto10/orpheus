I believe that reality's gone  
Disillusion's real  
I believe that morality's gone  
And there's nothing to feel  
  
If you take the sacred things  
The things that we hold dear  
Empty promise is all you'll find  
So give me something  
  
Something to believe in  
I believe in a changing of the guard  
Put our feet on the ground  
See it happen in your own backyard  
  
Everything breaks down  
Do you accept what you are told  
Without even thinking  
Throw it all and make your own  
  
And give me something  
Something to believe in  
Where they lead  
You will follow  
  
Well I guess that's just the way it goes  
And if you look away  
You'll be doing what they say  
An if you look alive  
  
You'll be singled out and tried  
If you take home anything  
Let it be your will to think  
The more cynical you become  
  
The better off you'll be
