I know you, you know me  
I'm the black sheep of the family,  
I'm in an' out of trouble  
I'm the talk of the town  
I get wild in the street  
When the sun goes down  
I steal around, like a thief in the night  
Dancing 'til the break of day  
  
Bad boys,  
Running undercover of moonlight  
Bad, bad boys,  
Getting wild in the street,  
Wild in the city  
I see you, you see me  
Just a black street boy in society  
With high-heeled women full of champagne an' lies,  
Getting wild in the street  
'Til the hot sunrise  
Stealing round like a thief in the night  
Dancing 'til the break of day  
  
Bad boys,  
Running undercover of moonlight  
Bad, bad boys,  
Getting wild in the street,  
Wild in the city,  
Wild in the city,  
Wild in the city  
  
Bad, bad boys,  
Running undercover of moonlight  
Bad, bad boys,  
Getting wild in the street,  
Wild in the city  
  
I know you, you know me  
I'm the black sheep of the family,  
I'm in an' out of trouble  
I'm the talk of the town  
I get wild in the street  
When the sun goes down  
  
I don't care what the people think,  
I can't hear what the people say,  
I steal around like a thief in the night  
Dancing 'til the break of day  
  
Bad, bad boys,  
Running undercover of moonlight  
Bad, bad boys,  
Getting wild in the street,  
Bad, bad, bad boys,  
Running undercover of moonlight  
Bad, bad boys,  
Getting wild in the street,  
Wild in the city  
  
Undercover of moonlight
