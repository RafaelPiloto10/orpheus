You say you're not worthy of me  
But how do you know when you can't see  
Your eyes where midnight catches fire  
I can't describe this dizzy desire  
  
Can you be so insecure  
That you don't know what this grin is for  
Do you think I always act this way  
Silly and silent, and eager to stay  
When you're holding me tonight  
Holding me tonight  
  
You think it's all a mistake  
That I'm lost in a dream from which I'll wake up  
There you'll be just another guy  
You could never be but I dare you to try  
When you're holding me  
Holding me tonight  
  
I walk into your room  
You blush when I see it in a mess  
So I undress and close my eyes  
A room with a view  
Is in the dark with you  
But that should come as no surprise  
  
It's not a matter of mind  
The choice of the heart is a different kind  
It's always been a mystery  
When you walk into the room It happens to me  
And when you're holding me  
Holding me tonight
