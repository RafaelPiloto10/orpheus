Friends tell me I am crazy  
That I'm wasting time with you  
You'll never be mine  
Ooooh  
  
That's not the way I see it  
Cause I feel you're already mine  
Whenever you're with me  
Ooooh  
People always talk about reputation  
I don't care about the other girls  
Just be good to me  
Ooooh  
  
Friends are always telling me you're a user  
But I don't care what you do to them  
Just be good to me  
Ooooh  
  
You may have many others  
But I know when you're with me  
You are all mine  
Ooooh  
  
Friends seem to always listen  
To the bad things that you do  
You never do them to me  
Ooooh  
  
People always talk about reputation  
I don't care about the other girls  
Just be good to me  
Ooooh  
  
Friends are always telling me you're a user  
I don't care what you do to them  
Just be good to me  
Ooooh  
  
Oh  
La la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la  
Just be good to me  
Ooooh  
La la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la  
Just be good to me  
Ooooh  
La la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la  
Just be good to me  
Ooooh  
La la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la  
Just be good to me  
Ooooh  
Just be good to me  
Just be good to me in the morning  
Just be good to me in the afternoon or evening  
Oh yeah be good to me  
Ooooh  
  
La la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la  
Just be good to me  
  
Ohg  
I'm not the jealous type  
I won't let you down when you need me  
I'll be around  
I'll be good to you  
You'll be good to me  
And we'll be together, be together  
Oh  
  
La la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la  
Be nice to me  
Be sweet to me  
  
Just be good to me
