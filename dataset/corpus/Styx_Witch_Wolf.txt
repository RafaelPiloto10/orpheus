Reoccurring symptoms  
Answer the baleful howl  
Bringing me dreams of darkness  
The doer of all that's foul  
Raping the minds of infants  
Sower of unplanted seeds  
Full moon warrior  
Doer of sordid deeds  
  
Witch wolf  
Night rider  
Why do you call for me?  
  
Thirteenth hour madman  
Bringing my soul to fire  
Visions of my sweet beulah  
To torment soon retire  
  
Witch wolf  
Night rider  
Why do you call for me?  
  
Got my one-way ticket  
On this hell bound train  
I can't seem to stop falling  
I bear the wrath of cain  
  
Witch wolf  
Night rider  
Why do you call for me?
