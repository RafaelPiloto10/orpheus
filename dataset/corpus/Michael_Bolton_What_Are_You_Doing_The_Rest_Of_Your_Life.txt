What are you doing the rest of your life?  
North and South and East and West of your life  
I have only one request of your life  
That you spend it all with me  
All the seasons and the times of your days  
All the nickels and the dimes of your days  
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days  
All begin and end with me  
I want to see your face in every kind of light  
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night  
And when you stand before the candles on a cake  
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make  
Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes  
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes  
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes  
It may take a kiss or two  
Through all of my life  
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life  
All I ever will recall of my life  
Is all of my life with you
