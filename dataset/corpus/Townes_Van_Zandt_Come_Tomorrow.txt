Could it be the season's changin'  
The winds of winter rearranging  
All the leaves like fallin' queens of sorrow  
Could be the freezing rain a-fallin'  
Could be sad September callin'  
Or maybe its knowin' she'll be gone  
Come tomorrow  
  
Well, it's strange how many tortured mornings  
Fell upon us with no warning  
Lookin' for a smile to beg and borrow  
It's over now, there is no returning  
A thousand bridges sadly burning  
And light the way I have to walk alone  
Come tomorrow  
  
I guess that no amount of lying  
To myself will stop the crying  
I guess I have to take things like they are  
The facts are plain to see, it's only  
That I ain't used to being lonely  
Like I'm gonna be without you  
Come tomorrow  
  
Come tomorrow
