Slipping and sliding and playing domino  
Lefting and then righting, it's not a crime you know.  
You gotta tell your story boy, before it's time to go.  
  
Are you ready for the country because it's time to go?  
Are you ready for the country because it's time to go?  
  
I was talkin' to the preacher, said God was on my side  
Then I ran into the hangman, he said it's time to die  
You gotta tell your story boy, you know the reason why.  
  
Are you ready for the country because it's time to go?  
Are you ready for the country because it's time to go?
