What do you get when you fall in love?  
A girl with a pin to burst your bubble  
That's what you get for all your trouble  
I'll never fall in love again  
I'll never fall in love again  
  
What do you get when you kiss a girl  
You get enough germs to catch pneumonia  
After you do, she'll never phone ya  
I'll never fall in love again  
I'll never fall in love again  
  
Don't tell me what it's all about  
'Cause I've been there and I'm glad I'm not  
Out of those chains those chains that bind you  
That is why I'm here to remind you  
  
What do you get when you fall in love?  
You only get lies and pain and sorrow  
So far at least until tomorrow  
I'll never fall in love again  
I'll never fall in love again
