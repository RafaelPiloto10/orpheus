Every time that someone walks in  
She turns around to see if it's him  
She checks her watch by the clock  
I can't count the times he's stood her up  
And one's too much  
  
[Chorus]  
How could anybody break a heart like hers  
I can't stand to watch her hurt  
I would gladly take his place  
If she'd just love me that way  
He must not know what it's worth  
I don't understand how anyone  
Could break a heart like hers  
  
She keeps saying he'll change someday  
He wasn't always this way  
She things he hung the moon and stars  
But all he's done is string her along like this  
It don't make sense  
  
[Chorus]  
  
How could anybody break  
A heart like hers
