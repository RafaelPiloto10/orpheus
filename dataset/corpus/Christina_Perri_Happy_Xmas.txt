So this is Christmas  
And what have you done?  
Another year over  
And a new one just begun.  
So this is Christmas,  
I hope you have fun,  
The near and the dear one  
The old and the young.  
  
A very merry Christmas  
And a happy New Year  
Let's hope it's a good one,  
Without any fear.  
  
And so this is Christmas,  
For weak and for strong,  
For rich and the poor ones,  
The world is so wrong.  
And so happy Christmas,  
For black and for whites,  
For yellow and red ones,  
Let's stop all the fight.  
  
A very merry Christmas  
And a happy New Year  
Let's hope it's a good one  
Without any fear.  
And so this is Christmas  
And what have we done?  
Another year over  
And a new one just begun.  
Ans so this is Christmas,  
I hope you have fun.  
The near and the dear one,  
The old and the young.  
  
A very merry Christmas  
And a happy New Year  
Let's hope it's a good one  
Without any fear.  
  
War is over  
If you want it.  
War is over now.  
War is over  
If you want it.  
War is over now.  
War is over  
If you want it.  
War is over now.  
War is over if you want it,  
War is over now
