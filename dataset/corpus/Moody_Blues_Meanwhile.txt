Just in a simple conversation  
You can hear the feeling change  
Down to the sea  
And if you need an explanation  
I defy you to explain  
But something's not the same  
And it's bothering me  
I think I see where I went wrong  
I think I see what's going on  
Meanwhile and far away  
As the night draws in  
He's holding her right now  
I can feel it all begin  
Meanwhile and far away  
When the day is done  
I ride away with my friend  
Into the setting sun  
And the rivers running down  
Down to the sea  
I let love slip right through my fingers  
And I watched it drift away  
But still I had to say  
What was written for me  
I thought I'd end up as the hero  
Thought the glory would be mine  
Very soon I was to find  
It wasn't to be  
Cause in this part I've got to play  
It doesn't quite turn out that way  
Meanwhile and far away  
As the night draws in  
He's holding her right now  
I can feel it all begin  
Meanwhile and far away  
When the day is done  
I ride away with my friend  
Into the setting sun  
And the rivers running down  
Down to the sea
