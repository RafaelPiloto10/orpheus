I'm leaving today  
Living it  
Leaving it  
To change  
  
Slowly drifting  
Into a peaceful breeze  
Tongue tied and twisted  
Are all my memories  
Celebrating a fantasy come true  
Packing all my bags  
Finally on the move  
  
I'm leaving today  
I'm living it  
Oh I'm leaving it  
To change  
  
As I'm driving  
I'm captured by the view  
So much beauty  
The road becomes my muse  
The heat is rising  
And my hand surfs through the wind  
Cool, calm, collected  
Is the child that lies within  
  
See I'm leaving today  
I'm living it  
Oh I'm leaving it  
To change, oh yeah  
  
See I'm leaving today, oh yes I'm  
Living it  
Oh I'm leaving it  
To change  
  
But somehow I miss it  
I think I'll really miss it  
One day, oh  
  
I turn up the radio  
And I'm feeling like I've never felt before  
Turn down the memories of  
Yester-years and broken dreams I bring  
Finally free, ooh  
  
Slowly drifting  
Into a peaceful breeze, oh  
Oh  
  
Ooh yeah  
I'm leaving today, oh yes I'm  
Living it, oh yeah  
Leaving it to change  
To change, oh no  
  
See I'm leaving today, oh yes I'm  
Living it, living it  
Leaving it, leaving  
To change  
Oh oh  
  
I'm leaving today  
Oh I'm living it  
I'm leaving it to change  
Living it, to change  
Leaving it  
To change  
Ooh, oh yeah  
  
Living it, leaving it  
Said I'm living it  
I'm leaving it  
Living it, leaving it  
To change  
I'm leaving it to change  
  
But somehow I miss it  
I think I'll really miss it  
One day, yeah
