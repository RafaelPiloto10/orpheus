This is ?  
Food of love  
That they said  
Got it wrong  
Smiling  
You and I  
Thinking  
Never see it die  
  
What I say now  
What I say now  
I don't think we know each other  
Enough to lie  
Enough is enough anyway  
  
These changes  
Lives alone  
Drowning  
By the fire  
Out of dearth  
He becomes  
Man without  
Qualities  
  
What I say now  
What I say now  
I don't think we know each other  
Enough to lie  
Enough is enough anyway  
  
This love  
Food of love  
They said  
Got it wrong  
Smiling  
You and I  
Thinking  
Never see it die  
  
What I say now  
What I say now  
I don't think we know each other  
Enough to lie  
Enough is enough anyway  
  
You and I  
What I say
