I been workin' the whole day long  
On these railroad ties singin' a sad, sad song  
Down the track is a bad way to live  
The boss man's whip is all he's got to give  
And late at night in the twilight of the South  
They put you in a cell and let the bulldogs out  
The old cat down the way  
Well he's singin' out the blues  
'Cause he's got no one back home  
Oh, somebody sighed  
Next day comes they send you back out on the track  
All that sweat be drippin' down off your back  
Everybody's singin' a workin' man's song  
Hopin' they don't have to feel the whip on their bone  
The water boy slowly works his way around  
A bucket full of swamp water weighin' him down  
Old Squezer Walker just fell out on the ground  
And they're draggin' his body away  
Oh, my, my, my  
  
Well, there's talk around camp  
That there's gonna be a fight  
Old Razor Face and Willie Black  
The meanest dudes in sight  
One's got a razor and the other's got a knife  
But only one's gonna walk out alive  
  
Oh, baby, mama, get me out of here  
Can't stand no more  
This place is gonna be the death of me  
Believe to my soul that I gotta be free  
There's only one way that it's every gonna be  
That's when the angels come and take me away  
Well, now  
  
Oh, baby, mama, get me out of here  
Can't stand no more  
This place is gonna be the death of me  
Believe to my soul that I gotta be free  
There's only one way that it's every gonna be  
That's when the angels come and take me away  
Well, now
