I Put my fear back in its box  
And I Put the box where love is blind  
And I walk in the dark  
Where pain waits smiling  
And I know that I can't leave  
I look at what I've become  
I'm a pure and perfect lie  
Like a blind man falling  
Scared and helpless  
And I'm still falling from grace  
I'm so cold  
Don't leave me blind  
I'm so cold  
Don't leave me blinded  
I don't know why I'm afraid  
I don't know why I'm unsure  
And if it all comes down to  
What I'm feeling  
I don't know what I can say  
I'm so cold  
Don't leave me blind  
I'm so cold  
Don't leave me blinded  
I stumble  
In the depths of my sin  
On my knees  
I'm a sick man drowning  
I belong  
But for you it's down to  
Who you know  
And do you need this?  
I'm so cold  
Don't leave me blind  
I'm so cold  
Don't leave me blinded
