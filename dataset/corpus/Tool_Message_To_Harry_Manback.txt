Figlio di puttana, sai che tu sei un pezzo di merda?  
Hm? You think you're cool, right? Hm? Hm?  
When you kicked out people out of your house  
I tell you this, one of three Americans die of cancer,  
You know? Asshole. You're gonna be one of those.  
I don't have the courage  
To kick your ass directly.  
Don't have enough courage for that,  
I could, you know.  
You know you're gonna have another accident?  
You know I'm involved with black magic?  
Fuck you. Die. Bastard.  
You think you're so cool, hm? Asshole.  
And if I ever see your fucking face around,  
In Europe or Italy,  
Well I'll, that time I'm gonna kick your ass.  
Fuck you. Fucking Americans, Yankee.  
You're gonna die outta cancer, I promise.  
Bang bang, deep pain  
No one does what you did to me.  
You wanna know something? Fuck you.  
I want your balls smashed, eat shit. Bastard.  
Pezzo di merda, figlio di puttana.  
I hope somebody in your family dies soon.  
Crepa, pezzo di merda, e vai  
A sucare cazzi su un aereo!  
(1) Son of a bitch, do you know you are a piece of shit?  
(2) Piece of shit, son of a bitch.  
(3) Die, piece of shit, and go suck dicks on a plane!
