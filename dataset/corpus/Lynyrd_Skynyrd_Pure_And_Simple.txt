I used to live in a poor neighborhood  
My friends and me, we always had a time  
Never had no money but we had it so good  
Those days are gone and I wanna go back  
  
So pure, so simple  
  
Never thought about it  
When you're young, you don't care  
You don't realize it 'til it's all behind  
Take it for granted just not well  
  
Oh oh, it was pure and simple  
I'll remember those days 'til the end  
Oh oh, God knows, it's simple  
If I could live my life all over again  
I'd keep it pure and simple  
  
Those days are gone and I wanna go back  
  
Got me a feelin' I'm not alone  
Wish I had a road so I could go back home  
  
Oh oh, it was pure and simple  
I'll remember those days 'til the end  
Oh oh, God knows, it's simple  
If I could live my life all over again  
  
Oh oh, it was pure and simple  
I'll remember those days 'til the end  
Oh oh, God knows, it's simple  
If I could live my life all over again  
I'd keep it pure and simple
