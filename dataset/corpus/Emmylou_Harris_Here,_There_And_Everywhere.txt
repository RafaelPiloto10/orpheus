Here making each day of the year  
Changing my life with one wave of his hand  
Nobody can deny that there's something there  
  
There running my hands through his hair  
Both of us thinking how good it can be someone is speaking  
But he doesn't know she's there  
  
I want him everywhere and if he's beside me I know I need never care  
But to love him is to meet him  
Everywhere knowing that love is to share  
  
Each one believing that love never dies watching his eyes and hoping I'm
always there  
To be here and everywhere here there and everywhere  
I want him everywhere and if he's beside me I know I need never care  
But to love him is to meet him  
  
Everywhere knowing that love is to share  
Each one believing that love never dies watching his eyes and hoping I'm
always there  
To be there and everywhere here there and everywhere
