Be who you are  
Don't ever change  
The world was made to measure for your smile  
So smile.  
  
Those crazy dreams  
We threw, we threw away  
I never been alone with you  
I never could  
They say  
  
That love will find a way  
And love will never be set free  
I won't ever let you see  
You could not understand  
You never will  
  
Be who you are  
I bless I bless your name  
And all that summer madness caused the rain  
And we, we  
  
The glory that we made  
My love will grace the halls of time  
A love that never can be mine  
You could not love me then  
I love you still  
  
Be who you are  
Seize life and find a way  
And I will be that shadow loving who you are  
Be who you are  
We were
