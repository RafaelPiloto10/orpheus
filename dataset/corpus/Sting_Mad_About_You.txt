A stone's throw from Jerusalem  
I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight  
And though a million stars were shining  
My heart was lost on a distant planet  
That whirls around the April moon  
Whirling in an arc of sadness  
I'm lost without you. I'm lost without you  
Though all my kingdoms turn to sand  
And fall into the sea  
I'm mad about you. I'm mad about you  
And from the dark secluded valleys  
I heard the ancient songs of sadness  
But every step I thought of you  
Every footstep only you  
And every star a grain of sand  
The leavings of a dried up ocean  
Tell me, how much longer? How much longer?  
They say a city in the desert lies  
The vanity of an ancient king  
But the city lies in broken pieces  
Where the wind howls and the vultures sing  
These are the works of man  
This is the sum of our ambition  
It would make a prison of my life  
If you became another's wife  
With every prison blown to dust  
My enemies walk free  
I'm mad about you. I'm mad about you  
And I have never in my life  
Felt more alone than I do now  
Although I claim dominions over all I see  
It means nothing to me  
There are no victories  
In all our histories, without love  
A stone's throw from Jerusalem  
I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight  
And though a million stars were shining  
My heart was lost on a distant planet  
That whirls around the April moon  
Whirling in an arc of sadness  
I'm lost without you. I'm lost without you  
And though you hold the keys to ruin  
Of everything I see  
With every prison blown to dust,  
My enemies walk free  
Though all my kingdoms turn to sand  
And fall into the sea  
I'm mad about you. I'm mad about you
