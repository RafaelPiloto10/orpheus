I saw him dancin' there by the record machine,  
I knew he must have been about seventeen.  
The beat was goin' strong playin' my favourite song.  
And I could tell it wouldn't be long till he was with me,  
Yeah me, and I could tell it wouldn't be long till he was  
With me. Yeah me - singin'  
  
I love rock'n'roll  
So put another dime in the juke box, baby.  
I love rock'n'roll  
So come on take your time and dance with me.  
  
Ow  
  
He smiled so I got up and asked for his name,  
That don't matter he said 'cos it's all the same.  
I said can I take you home where we can be alone -  
Next we were movin' on and he was with me, yeah me,  
Next we were movin' on and he was with me, yeah me - singin'  
  
I love rock'n'roll  
So put another dime in the juke box, baby.  
I love rock'n'roll  
So come on take your time and dance with me.  
Whoaaaaaaaaah!  
  
I said can I take you home, where we can be alone,  
Next we were movin' on and he was with me, yeah me,  
And we'll movin' on and singin' that same old song,  
Yeah with me - singin'  
  
I love rock'n'roll  
So put another dime in the juke box, baby.  
I love rock'n'roll  
So come on take your time and dance with me.  
I love rock'n'roll  
So put another dime in the juke box, baby.  
I love rock'n'roll  
So come on take your time and dance with me.  
I love rock'n'roll  
So put another dime in the juke box, baby.  
I love rock'n'roll  
So come on take your time and dance with me
