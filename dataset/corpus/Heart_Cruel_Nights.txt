Every night without you is more than I can bear  
Moonlight can be torture when your love isn't there  
I see you in the shadows I can hear you in the wind  
I think of you and I can feel my world closin' in  
I can't sleep I keep wishin' I could touch you  
I'd be fine if I could make it through, through these  
Cruel nights, cruel nights  
Missing you, nights  
What do I do, nights  
Cruel nights without your love  
Counting every minute, every minute feels like days  
Feels like time is standing still since you went away  
Always thought you'd stay forever, always thought that you'd be here  
Now it's been a lifetime since I held you near  
Days crawl by, I keep wishing they'd be over  
But I know they're only leading me to, to these  
Cruel nights, cruel nights  
Missing you, nights  
What, what do I do, nights  
Cruel nights without your love  
Cruel nights, since we've been apart  
Cruel nights, it's been tearing up my heart  
Cruel nights, since you've been away, baby, cruel nights  
Oh, I just can't get through another night  
Without you beside me, I need you beside me  
I can't sleep I keep wishin' I could touch you  
I'd be fine if I could make it through  
Through these  
These cruel nights, cruel nights  
Missin' you, nights, baby  
What do I, what do I do nights  
Cruel nights without your love  
Cruel nights, it's tearing me apart  
Cruel nights, you're playing with me heart  
Cruel nights, since you've been away  
Cruel nights, well, well, well baby  
Cruel nights, these cruel nights  
These cruel, cruel nights  
Cruel nights come home come home baby  
Cruel nights, come home now baby
