I wish I had a son  
A little boy  
Bright, with black curly hair.  
I would take his hand in mine  
And stroll slowly, slowly  
Through the garden...  
Little boy.  
  
Uri, I'd call him  
My Uri!  
How gentle and clear this tiny name  
A glimmer of joy  
For my little boy,  
Uri, I'd call him  
Uri, I'd call.  
  
But I am still bitter as Rachel  
I am still praying as Hannah in Shiloh,  
I am still waiting for him.  
I will  
Wait.
