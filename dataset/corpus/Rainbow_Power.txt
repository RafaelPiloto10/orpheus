Everybody's sayin' that the times are getting rough  
You gotta stay loose baby and you gotta be tough...oh  
I get knocked down...get right back up again  
Cause I never give up and I never give in...  
Oh - so strong  
Got the power when I turn it on  
Yeah - I'm gonna get my fill  
Nothin's gonna stop me now and nothin' ever will  
I got the...power  
I got the power  
I feel the power...  
And don't forget it  
  
Make some, break some ain't no big surprise  
They're gonna wheel ya, deal ya, tell ya all the lies...(realize)  
But I'm a hot shot, shoot em down let me be (that's me)  
Cause I got nothin' for nothin' and nothin's ever free...no  
Oh - so strong  
All I gotta do is turn it on  
Yeah - I'm gonna get my fill  
Nothin's gonna stop me now and nothin' ever will  
I got the power  
Oh, I got the power  
I can feel the power  
I got the power  
Yeah yeah yeah...turn it on  
  
I can take anything that gets in my way  
I don't worry 'bout tomorrow I just live for today...  
Oh - so strong  
Got that feeling when I turn it on  
Yeah - I'm gonna get my fill  
Nothin's gonna stop me now and nothin' ever will  
I got the power  
I can feel the power

Turn it on...
