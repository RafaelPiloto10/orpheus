I wish a wish I dream to dream  
I try to try and I live to live  
And die to die and I cry to cry  
But I know why  
  
Somewhere in my dreams  
Things that should  
Still the willow weeps  
On roses for the dead  
In laughs of love  
  
From the likes of her  
To time of me  
Like to moon to earth  
Or the sky to sea  
Only were no longer  
Allowed to be, to be  
  
Somewhere in the dreams  
Of those who should  
Live in all the keeps  
Echo all the worlds  
In laughs of love  
  
For times that pass my life  
I'll search for the sky  
That she wonders by  
  
Somewhere in the dreams  
That the skies hold  
Still the willow weeps  
On roses for her bed  
In laughs of love
