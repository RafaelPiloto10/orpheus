Some days you waste your life away  
These times I find no words to say  
A crime I once committed filled me  
Too much of heaven's eyes I saw through  
Only when meanings have no reason  
They're taken beyond your sense of right  
  
Small boy kneels, wandering in a great hall  
He pays pennance to the air above him  
White circles, black lines surround me  
Reborn, so plain my eyes see  
This is the reason that I came here  
To be so near to such a person  
  
I'm so tired, I'm so tired
