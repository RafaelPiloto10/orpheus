God loves a lullaby  
In a mothers tears in the dead of night  
Better than a Hallelujah sometimes.  
God loves a drunkards cry,  
The soldiers plea not to let him die  
Better than a Hallelujah sometimes.  
  
We pour out our miseries  
God just hears a melody  
Beautiful the mess we are  
The honest cries of breaking hearts  
Are better than a Hallelujah.  
  
The woman holding on for life,  
The dying man giving up the fight  
Are better than a Hallelujah sometimes  
The tears of shame for what's been done,  
The silence when the words won't come  
Are better than a Hallelujah sometimes.  
  
We pour out our miseries  
God just hears a melody  
Beautiful the mess we are  
The honest cries of breaking hearts  
Are better than a Hallelujah.  
  
Better than a church bell ringing,  
Better than a choir singing out, singing out.  
  
We pour out our miseries  
God just hears a melody  
Beautiful the mess we are  
The honest cries of breaking hearts  
Are better than a Hallelujah.  
  
We pour out our miseries  
God just hears a melody  
Beautiful the mess we are  
The honest cries of breaking hearts  
Are better than a Hallelujah.  
  
(Better than a Hallelujah sometimes)  
Better than a Hallelujah  
(Better than a Hallelujah sometimes)
