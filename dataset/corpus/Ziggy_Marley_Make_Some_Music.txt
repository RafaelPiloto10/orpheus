Love is a melody playing through eternity, making sweet songs all night long  
Stay in the groove, we can't refuse when the rhythm is tight we'll be up all
night  
The perfect tune we make for life beats that vibrate moods that excite  
Instruments tuned, harmonies right  
Love is the song we make tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
Come on baby lets make some music, this is the groove and that's how I do it  
Come on baby lets make some music, cause you know how, how to do it  
  
Thinking of lyrics I could sing, but I know they must come from within  
Can't rush music got to take it slow keep in the groove till it starts to flow  
Hit the right tempo then you know, this song is not for the show  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's a beautiful thing the way you hit the way we swing  
The way we rock this groove  
Now we're going to the roots, now we're going to the roots  
Hey It's a beautiful thing the way we hit the way we swing  
The way we rock this groove  
Now we're going to the roots, now we're going to the roots  
  
[Chorus]
