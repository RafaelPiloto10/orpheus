He takes all my money  
You know I'm through with Buzz  
Yes I'm through with Buzz,  
All right, oh yeah, uh huh  
  
He's not very funny  
You know I'm through with Buzz  
Yes I'm through with Buzz,  
All right, oh yeah, uh huh  
  
I remember when he stole my girl  
Drug her all around the world  
You know I'm cool, yes I feel alright  
'Cept when I'm in my room and it's late at night  
  
Maybe he's a fairy  
You know I'm through with Buzz  
Yes I'm through with Buzz  
All right, oh yeah, uh huh, all right
