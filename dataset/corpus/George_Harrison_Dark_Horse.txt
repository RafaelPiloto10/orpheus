You thought that you knew where I was and when  
But it looks like they've been foolin' you again,  
You thought that you'd got me all steaked out  
But baby looks like I've been breaking out  
  
I'm a dark horse  
Running on a dark race course  
I'm a blue moon  
Since I stepped from out of the womb  
I've been a cool jerk  
Looking for the source  
I'm a dark horse.  
  
You thought you had got me in your grip  
Baby looks like you was not so smart  
And I became too slippery for you  
But let me say that was nothing new.  
  
I'm a dark horse  
Running on a dark race course  
I'm a blue moon  
Since I picked up my first spoon  
I've been a cool jerk  
Looking for the source  
I'm a dark horse  
  
I thought that you knew it all along  
Until you started getting me not right  
Seems as if you heard a little late  
But I warned you when  
We both were at the starting gate  
  
I'm a dark horse  
Running on a dark race course  
I'm a blue moon  
Since I stepped from out of the womb  
I've been a cool jerk  
Cooking at the source  
I'm a dark horse.
