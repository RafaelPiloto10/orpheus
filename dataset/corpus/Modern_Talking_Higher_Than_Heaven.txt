She's cool as ice, I'm hypnotized  
My heart is crying just for more  
No guarantee, she stays with me  
She's my dream, I can't ignore  
  
How can I just explain to her  
That she's my baby, oh I swear  
How can I just explain my love  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh I am: higher than heaven (higher than heaven)  
In the middle of the night (of the night)  
Feeling like the greatest lover (greatest lover)  
And I need you by my side  
Oh, one two three, lovers live longer  
Oh, can't you see, love makes me stronger  
  
She's cool as ice, she's cool as ice  
  
I'm specialized - in lonely eyes  
I can't explain-the way I feel  
Night after night - the stars shine bright  
You're my baby, oh it's real  
  
How can I just explain to you  
Tell me what have I got to do  
How can I just explain my love  
  
[Chorus: x 2]
