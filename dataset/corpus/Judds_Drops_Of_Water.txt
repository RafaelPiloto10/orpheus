There's a bird in my tree  
Singin' sad autumn melodies  
There's a old sumer breeze  
And it's blowin' away  
  
There's a cloud in my sky  
There's a boy who's been on my mind  
There's a tear in my eye  
And I think it might rain  
  
[Chorus]  
Drops of water, drops of water  
Fallin' down around fate  
Oh, it's nothin' but the rain in my life  
Drops of water, drops of water  
Fallin' down around my fate  
Oh, it's nothin' but the rain in my life  
  
There's a moon up above  
Shinin' down on the one I love  
There's a pain in my heart  
He's gone away  
  
If a star falls tonight  
Let it fall and with all my might  
I close my eyes, make a wish  
That he'll come back someday  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, it's nothin' but the rain in my life  
Drops of water, drops of water  
  
Oh, it's nothin' but the rain in my life  
Drops of water, drops of water
