I got superstition  
Ruling my decision  
You are my religion  
Haven't got a prayer  
  
So just give me the sign and I'll follow you  
When every angel's guarding you  
You are my religion  
Haven't got a prayer  
  
I don't want to wait  
To save your life  
I think I know a way  
To make things right  
  
Just give me the sign and I'll come for you  
Give me the sign and I'll be your rescue, baby  
I'll run your way when I hear you calling me  
  
Give me the sign and I'll come for you  
Give me the sign and I'll be your rescue, baby  
I'll run your way when I hear you calling out for me  
  
Walking under ladders  
Nothing really matters  
There could be disaster  
I don't really care  
  
So just give me the sign and I'll follow you  
When every angel's guarding you  
There could be disaster  
I don't really care  
  
I don't want to wait  
To save your life  
I think I know a way  
To make things right  
  
Just give me the sign and I'll come for you  
Give me the sign and I'll be your rescue, baby  
I'll run your way when I hear you calling me  
  
Give me the sign and I'll come for you  
Give me the sign and I'll be your rescue, baby  
I'll run your way when I hear you calling out  
  
For me  
For me  
  
I don't want to wait  
To save your life  
I think I know a way  
To make things right  
  
Just give me the sign  
Give me the sign  
Give me the sign  
Just give me the sign  
  
Just give me the sign and I'll come for you  
Give me the sign and I'll be your rescue, baby  
I'll run your way when I hear you calling me  
  
Give me the sign and I'll come for you  
Give me the sign and I'll be your rescue, baby  
I'll run your way when I hear you calling out for me  
Give me the sign  
  
Give me the sign  
Give me the sign  
Give me the sign
