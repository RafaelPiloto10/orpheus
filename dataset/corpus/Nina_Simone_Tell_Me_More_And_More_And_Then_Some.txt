Tell me more and then some  
Daddy you know what I wanna hear  
I want some more and then some of that  
I love you only dear  
  
I want some more and then some  
Oh how you feel  
And then when you done told me  
About a million times  
How much you love me  
And you're through  
Start right back again  
  
I've made the same mistake  
I know the awful ache  
Of a little heart that's been double crossed  
The waiting's been so long so long  
It's hard to be believing  
I thought I'd missed my guess  
I thought happiness for me was lost  
  
I want more some more  
Some more and then some  
You know how I love that stuff  
Whisper from now on till Doomsday  
But I never  
No I never no I never  
Will get enough
