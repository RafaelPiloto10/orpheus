I don't know why but I'm feeling so sad  
I long to try something I've never had  
Never had no kissin'  
Ooh what I've been missin'  
Lover man oh where can you be  
  
The night is cold and I'm so all alone  
I'd give my soul just to call you my own  
Got a moon above me  
But there's no one to love me  
Lover man oh where can you be  
  
I've heard it said that the thrill of romance can be  
Like a heavenly dream  
I go to bed with a prayer that you'll make love to me  
Strange as it seems  
Someday we'll meet and you'll dry all my tears  
And whisper sweet little things in my ears  
Huggin' and a-kissin'  
Ooh what I've been missin'  
Lover man oh where can you be  
  
I've heard it said that the thrill of romance can be  
Like a heavenly dream  
I go to bed with a prayer that you'll make love to me  
Strange as it seems  
Someday we'll meet and you'll dry all my tears  
And whisper sweet little things in my ears  
Huggin' and a-kissin'  
Ooh what I've been missin'  
Lover man oh where can you be
