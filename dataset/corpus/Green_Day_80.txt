My mental stability reaches its bitter end  
And all my senses are coming unglued  
Is there any cure for this disease  
Someone called love  
Not as long as there are  
Girls like you  
  
Everything she does questions my mental health  
It makes me loose control  
I just can't trust myself  
  
If someone can hear me slap some sense in me  
But you turn your head and I end up talking to myself  
Anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated  
So I loose my head or bang it up against the wall  
  
Sometimes I wonder if I should be left alone  
And lock myself up in a padded room  
I'd sit and spew my guts out to the open air  
No one wants to hear a drunken fool  
  
I do not mind if this goes on  
Cause now it seems I'm too far gone  
I must admit I enjoy myself  
Eighty please keep taking me away
