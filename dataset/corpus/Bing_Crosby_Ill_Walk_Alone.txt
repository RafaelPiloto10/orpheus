I'll walk alone  
But to tell you the truth, I'll be lonely  
I don't mind being lonely  
When my heart tells me you are lonely, too  
  
I'll walk alone  
They'll ask me why and I'll tell them I'd rather  
There are dreams I must gather  
Dreams we fashioned the night you held me tight  
  
I'll always be near you wherever you are each night  
In every prayer  
If you call I'll hear you, no matter how far  
Just close your eyes and I'll be there  
  
Please walk alone  
And send your love and your kisses to guide me  
Till you're walking beside me  
I'll walk alone  
  
I'll always be near you wherever you are each night  
In every prayer  
If you call I'll hear you, no matter how far  
Just close your eyes and I'll be there  
  
Please walk alone,  
And send your love and your kisses to guide me  
Till you're walking beside me, I'll walk alone  
I'll walk alone
