I am clearly broken  
And no one knows what to do  
Pieces of the puzzle don't fit so I bound them into you  
Itching is a pulse inside  
Creeping out to come alive  
It's just doing what it's gonna do  
  
Times are looking grim these days  
Holding on to everything  
It's hard to draw the line  
  
Shut the fuck up, get up [x3]  
  
I can't wait to rip my eyes out and look at you  
Peace through pain is precious  
Especially when it's done by you  
  
Itching is a pulse inside  
Creeping out to come alive  
It's just doing what it's gonna do  
  
Times are looking grim these days  
Holding on to everything  
It's hard to draw the line  
And I, I'm hiding in this empty space  
Tortured by my memories  
Of what I left behind  
  
Shut the fuck up, get up [x3]  
  
Shut  
Up  
  
Times are looking grim these days  
Holding on to everything  
It's hard to draw the line  
And I, I'm hiding in this empty space  
Tortured by my memories  
Of what I left behind  
  
Shut the fuck up, get up [x3]
