(Don't say it, baby)  
(Don't say it, baby)  
Don't say it, baby  
Don't say it's only me for you  
It's not true  
I'm still young, and there's so much I want to do  
(Don't say it, baby)  
(Don't say it, baby)  
  
Don't say it, baby  
Don't say the word that you'll regret  
Don't forget  
I'm a girl who's learned to take what she can get  
(Don't say it, baby)  
  
Today I could never belong to one boy  
(One boy)  
And while you wait for tomorrow  
You'll find your heart broken in two  
  
Don't say it, baby  
Don't be a fool for anyone  
Have your fun  
Go away  
Live every day while you're young  
(Don't say it, baby)  
  
Go away  
Live every day while you're still young  
(Don't say it, baby)  
You better go away while you're still young  
You gotta live every day now  
While you're still young
