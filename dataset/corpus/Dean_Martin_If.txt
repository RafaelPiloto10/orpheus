Coming back at you, record number two  
What a way to start the day  
Think you're big enough, with a stronger look  
Got no backup plan incase we blow it  
  
Yeah! It's all the same old stuff  
They think it's good enough  
It works, and nobody got hurt  
It happends every time  
Like anybody minds  
You're telling me it's just the way it works  
  
Too much work to do  
Rocking, new, improved  
Keep it in the family  
  
It's not over 'till it's over, anyway  
It's not over 'till it's over, anyway  
It's not over 'till it's over, anyway  
It's not over 'till it's over,  
It ain't broke so fix it anyway  
Yeah, yeah, yeah...  
  
Got a second chance, and a fresh advance  
What a way to start the week  
Sack the formula, there's no need to bother  
Got no backup plan so let's not blow it  
  
Yeah! It's all the same old stuff  
They think it's good enough  
It works, and nobody got hurt  
It happends every time  
Like anybody minds  
You're telling me it's just the way it works  
  
It's not over 'till it's over, anyway  
It's not over 'till it's over, anyway  
It's not over 'till it's over, anyway  
It ain't broke so fix it anyway  
Yeah, yeah, yeah...  
  
Fix it anyway
