Do you remember days  
Not so very long ago  
When the world was run by  
People twice your size  
And the days were full of laughter  
  
And the nights were full of stars  
And when you grew tired you  
Could close your eyes  
Yes the stars were were there for wishing  
And the wind was there for kites  
And the morning sun was  
There for rise and shine  
And even in the sniffles  
Kept you home from school in bed  
You couldn't hardly  
Stay there after nine  
  
And I wonder if the  
Smell of mornings faded  
  
What happened to the robins  
Song that sparkled in the sky  
Where's all the water gone  
That tumbled down the stream  
Will I ever catch another butterfly  
  
Right in your own backyard  
Wondering how airplanes could fly  
And the hours spent just playing  
With a funny rock you found  
With crystal specks as  
Blue as all the sky  
  
Now I watch my son  
He's playing with his toys  
He's happy and I  
Give him all I can  
But I can't help feeling  
Just a lime inside  
When to hear him say  
He wants to be a man
