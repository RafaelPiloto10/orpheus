Well she's walking through the clouds  
With a circus mind that's running wild  
Butterflies and zebras  
And moonbeams and a fairy tale  
That's all she ever thinks about  
Riding the wind  
  
When I'm sad she comes to me  
With a thousand smiles she gives to me free  
It's alright she says...it's alright  
Take anything you want from me  
Anything  
  
Fly on little wing  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Fly on little wing
