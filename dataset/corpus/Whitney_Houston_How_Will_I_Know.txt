There's a boy I know, he's the one I dream of  
Looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above, mm mm  
Oh I lose control, can't seem to get enough, uh huh  
When I wake from dreaming, tell me is it really love, ooo  
  
How will I know (Don't trust your feelings)  
How will I know  
How will I know (Love can be deceiving)  
How will I know  
How will I know if he really loves me  
  
I say a prayer with every heart beat  
I fall in love whenever we meet  
I'm asking you what you know about these things  
How will I know if he's thinking of me  
I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak)  
Falling in love is so bitter sweet  
This love is strong why do I feel weak  
  
Oh, wake me, I'm shaking, wish I had you near me now, uh huh  
Said there's no mistaking, what I feel is really love, ooo tell me  
  
How will I know (Don't trust your feelings)  
How will I know  
How will I know (Love can be deceiving)  
How will I know  
  
How will I know if he really loves me  
I say a prayer with every heart beat  
I fall in love whenever we meet  
I'm asking you what you know about these things

I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak)  
Falling in love is so bitter sweet  
This love is strong why do I feel weak  
  
If he loves me, if he loves me not  
If he loves me ooo, if he loves me not  
If he loves me, if he loves me not

How will I know if he's thinking of me  
I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak)  
Falling in love is so bitter sweet
