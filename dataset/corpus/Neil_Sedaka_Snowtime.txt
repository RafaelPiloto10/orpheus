Snowtime, snowtime, oh oh oh oh oh oh.  
Snowtime, snowtime, oh oh oh oh oh oh.  
  
The snow is falling,  
the world's dressed in white tonight,  
and I remember another cold December  
when I held you tight.  
  
And I'm recalling  
the joys that you were there to share,  
the stars burned brightly and I clung to you tightly  
as the snow clung to your hair.  
  
Your love quickly faded out of sight  
like the snow on the ground.  
When spring showed her April smiling face,  
you were no longer around.  
  
I'll be here waiting,  
I'll always be true to you,  
till winter finds you and falling snow reminds you  
that you love me too,  
that you love me too.  
  
Snowtime, snowtime, oh oh oh oh oh oh.  
Snowtime, snowtime, oh oh oh oh oh oh.
