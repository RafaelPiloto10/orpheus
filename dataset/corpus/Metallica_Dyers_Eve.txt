Dear mother  
Dear father  
What is this hell you have put me through  
Believer  
Deceiver  
Day in day out live my life through you  
Pushed onto me what's wrong or right  
Hidden from this thing that they call life  
  
Dear mother  
Dear father  
Every thought I'd think you'd disapprove  
Curator  
Dictator  
Always censoring my every move  
Children are seen but are not heard  
Tear out everything inspired  
  
Innocence  
Torn from me without your shelter  
Barred reality  
I'm living blindly  
  
Dear mother  
Dear father  
Time has frozen still what's left to be  
Hear nothing  
Say nothing  
Cannot face the fact I think for me  
No guarantee, it's life as is  
But damn you for not giving me my chance  
  
Dear mother  
Dear father  
You've clipped my wings before I learned to fly unspoiled  
Unspoken  
I've outgrown that fucking lullaby  
Same thing I've always heard from you  
Do as I say not as I do  
  
Innocence  
Torn from me without your shelter  
Barred reality  
I'm living blindly  
  
I'm in hell without you  
Cannot cope without you two  
Shocked at the world that I see  
Innocent victim please rescue me  
  
Dear mother  
Dear father  
Hidden in your world you've made for me  
I'm seething  
I'm bleeding  
Ripping wounds in me that never heal  
Undying spite I feel for you  
Living out this hell you always knew
