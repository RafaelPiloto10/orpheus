What now my love?  
Now that you left me  
How can I live through another day?  
Watching my dreams turning to ashes  
And my hopes into bits of clay  
  
Once I could see  
Once I could feel  
Now I am numb  
I've become unreal  
I walk the night  
Without a goal  
Stripped of my heart and my soul  
  
What now my love?  
Now that it's over  
I feel the world closing in on me  
Here come the stars  
Tumbling around me  
There's the sky  
Where the sea should be  
  
What now my love?  
Now that you're gone  
I'd be a fool  
To go on and on  
No one would care  
No one would cry  
If I should live or die  
  
What now my love?  
Now there is nothing  
Only my last goodbye  
My love
