The Jimmy Buffer Song  
David Allen Coe  
Prelude:  
This song is for all the people that's been reviewing our records and say we
sound a lot like Jimmy Buffet because we live in Key West and use Congo drums
in our songs. For all those people that live in Key West and are under the
misconception that Mr. Buffet live in Key West and we'd like to say there's a
lot of things in Key West, as a matter of fact, there's  
  
Chorus:  
There's sailboats and conk shells and palm trees galore,  
But Jimmy Buffet doesn't live in Key West anymore  
Sister spare change has a bumper sticker on the door  
Says Jimmy Buffet doesn't live here any more  
  
Verse 1:  
Hey smugglers need those Buffet songs, snitching on the sly  
Bringing heat where it's already to damn hot to die  
Son of a son of bitch, what's all that bullshit for  
Jimmy Buffet doesn't' live in Key West anymore  
  
Verse 2  
Sailing to the Caribbean Jimmy might well be  
Pictures up in Rollin' Stone for all the world to see  
The rich keep getting richer, the poor they just stay poor  
Jimmy buffet doesn't' live in Key West anymore  
  
Verse 3  
Now Jimmy's moved to Malibu with all those other stars  
He's not down at in Duval Street hangin' out in bars  
All them God damned tourist, got to be a bore.  
Jimmy Buffet doesn't live here any more  
  
Verse 4  
So don't tell me I sound like Jimmy Buffet  
Just because I got that island beat  
Jimmy might have grown up on the ocean  
Me, I kinda grown up on the street  
Music's just a way of life, me I'm liv'in free  
Don't lay all that Key West Jimmy Buffet shit on me  
Verse 5  
Now Divers Do It Deeper must have really made them mad  
Some of them reviewers said it really sounded bad  
Well they liked Margaritaville, me I liked it too  
Someday Jimmy, why don't we just both get drunk and screw  
Oh those creepy Mother Fuckers that think music is a whore  
Tell that you just don't live in Key West anymore  
Chorus:  
There's sailboats and conk shells and palm trees galore,  
But Jimmy buffet doesn't live in Key West anymore  
Sister spare change has a bumper sticker on the door  
Says Jimmy Buffet doesn't live here any more
