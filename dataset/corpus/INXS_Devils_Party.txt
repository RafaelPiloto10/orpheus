At the devil's party  
Nothing's a sin  
At the devil's party  
We know where you've been  
If we're all right  
Then tell me who's wrong  
  
Love and war  
(Where do we belong)  
I might believe it's love  
(Where do we belong)  
And you might believe it's war  
  
At the devil's party  
There's no light from the sun  
At the devil's party (now)  
Life's a loaded gun  
More or less (yeah)  
Less is more  
Go on and be my guest  
Where do we belong  
I might believe it's love  
(Where do we belong)  
You might give a little more  
  
Dreams of yours  
Dreams of mine  
Dreams of all  
That shines on the other side  
On the other side  
  
Hey!  
Come on in baby, everybody got's a dream  
  
At the devil's party  
Watch them standing in line  
At the devil's party (now)  
See no friends of mine  
Oh, lonely days  
On the road to excess  
When you're on fire  
You burn like the rest  
  
I might believe it's love  
(Where do we belong)  
And you might believe it's war  
(Where do we belong)  
Why don't we take a little less  
(Where do we belong)  
Then we could give a little more  
  
Dreams of yours  
Dreams of mine  
Dreams of all  
That's green on the other side  
On the other side
