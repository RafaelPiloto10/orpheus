Seasons come and seasons go  
But still the world she be turnin'  
I often stop and wonder  
How long will God  
Keep the fire burnin'  
Sometimes it seems the world's gone mad  
But I know there's hope for our children  
'Cause Jesus told us what to do  
And I know now's not the time to give in  
  
Long as we have breath  
Let's keep pushing  
Fighting to the death  
Stop at nothing  
His never ending flame  
Keep it burning Ooh  
Long as the big ball  
Long as the big ball is turning  
  
Time to feed the hungry heart  
That's never tasted compassion  
It's the time to spread the word  
Hey there's a love that is everlasting  
Yellow line down an upon road  
Don't say where she's going  
Still we follow just the same  
Oh, there is hope of a new horizon  
  
Long as we have breath  
Let's keep pushing  
Fighting to the death  
Stop at nothing  
His never ending flame  
Keep it burning Ooh  
Long as the big ball  
Long as the big ball is turning  
  
Round and round and round it goes  
But God is in control  
He knows just where we're going  
Yes the future's in His hands  
I don't know when we will land  
Oh no  
But I'll keep right on trusting in the Master's plan  
  
Long as we have breath  
Let's keep pushing  
Fighting to the death  
Stop at nothing  
His never ending flame  
Keep it burning Ooh  
Long as the big ball  
Long as the big ball is turning
