So what am I supposed to do?  
Here I am, I'm losing you  
And this is more than I can take  
And as you walk away, baby all that I can say  
Is I'm sorry for being me  
  
I won't have to look into your eyes anymore  
It's alright, they don't look at me the same  
With all that I've lost I give everything and more  
If you want my love, speak  
  
So what am I supposed to do  
Here I am, I'm losing you  
And this is more than I can take  
And as you walk away, baby all that I can say  
Is I'm sorry for being me  
Yes I'm sorry for being me
