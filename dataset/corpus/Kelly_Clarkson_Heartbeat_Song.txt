[Chorus]  
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it  
Been so long I forgot how to turn it up up up up all night long  
Oh up up all night long  
  
[Verse 1]  
You, where the hell did you come from?  
You're a different, different kind of fun  
And I'm used to feeling numb  
Now, I got pins and needles on my tongue  
Anticipating what's to come  
Like a finger on a loaded gun  
  
I can feel it rising  
Temperature inside me  
Haven't felt for a long time  
  
[Chorus]  
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it  
Been so long I forgot how to turn it up up up up all night long  
Oh up up all night long  
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it  
Turn it on  
But I know you can take it up up up up all night long  
Oh up up all night long  
  
[Verse 2]  
I, I wasn't even gonna go out  
But I never would have had a doubt  
If I don't know where I'd be now  
  
Your hands on my hips  
And my kiss on your lips  
And I could do this for a long time  
  
[Chorus]  
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it  
Been so long I forgot how to turn it up up up up all night long  
Oh up up all night long  
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it  
Turn it on  
But I know you can take it up up up up all night long  
Oh up up all night long  
  
[Bridge]  
Until tonight I only dreamed about you  
I can't believe I'll ever breathe without you  
Baby you make me feel alive and brand new  
Bring it one more time, one more time  
  
[Chorus]  
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it  
Been so long I forgot how to turn it up up up up all night long  
Oh up up all night long  
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it  
Turn it on  
But I know you can take it up up up up all night long  
Oh up up all night long  
  
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it  
Been so long I forgot how to turn it up up up up all night long  
Oh up up all night long  
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it  
Turn it on  
But I know you can take it up up up up all night long  
Oh up up all night long
