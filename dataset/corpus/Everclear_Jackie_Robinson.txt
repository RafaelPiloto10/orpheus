Luther Jackson Green  
Lived in the apartment above me  
We smoked cigarettes on the stairs  
Tell me stories that white boys never hear  
  
Like when he found this shine  
He moved north in nineteen forty-nine  
On his tenth birthday daddy took him to town  
To see the Jackie Robinson play.  
  
It was a picture perfect day  
In the sunshine and the hate  
He didn't understand why all those  
People would say such awful things.  
  
His daddy said pay no attention to them  
Turnaround and watch the man play  
  
The one black man in the baseball field  
Was better in every way  
My daddy said if you wanna win in this world  
You gotta beat 'em the their own game.  
  
Luther Jackson Green  
Went to law school in nineteen sixty-three  
In the summer between he worked in Alabama  
With Martin Luther King  
  
He met a girl on a summer night  
He fell hard when they saw each other's eyes  
There were people in town that really didn't  
Like that he was black and she was white  
  
They found her in the ditch  
A little outside of town  
Some stupid man was blastin' about it  
So Luther beat him down  
  
He looked him in the eye, spit in his face and  
He turned and walked away.  
He knew he was better than all the hate  
He knew he was bigger than all the pain  
He knew there's a time to fight and a time to walk away  
He knew until he changed the rules  
Ooh yeah they beat 'em at their own game.  
  
He never did lose that feeling inside  
You could hear it in his voice  
You could see it in his eyes  
  
Luther moved out West to live  
When his wife passed away  
He lives right next door to his son  
So he can watch his grandchild play.  
  
Luther Jackson Green  
Watched election night with me.  
We put a black man in the White House  
A thing he never thought he'd see.  
  
Even though he never cried  
I could see tears in his eyes  
He had dreamed about this moment  
Every single day of his life.  
  
Yeah Luther died that night in his sleep  
But he lived long enough to see,  
America become the kind of place  
He always wanted it to be.  
  
He said you could never forget the day  
That we beat 'em at their own game!  
  
Yeah just like Jackie Robinson (just like Jackie Robinson)  
Gotta be bigger than all the hate (just like Jackie Robinson)  
Gotta be better than all the pain (just like Jackie Robinson)  
Gotta find a better way (just like Jackie Robinson)  
  
Gotta beat 'em at their own game (just like Jackie Robinson)  
Gotta beat 'em at their own game (just like Jackie Robinson)  
Gotta beat 'em at their own game (just like Jackie Robinson)  
(Just like Jackie Robinson)
