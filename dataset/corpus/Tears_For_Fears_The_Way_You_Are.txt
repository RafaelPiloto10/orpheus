Going far,  
Getting nowhere  
Going far,  
The way you are  
  
Going far,  
Getting nowhere  
Going far,  
The way you are  
  
Going far,  
Getting nowhere  
The way you are  
  
Going far,  
Getting nowhere  
The way you are  
  
These fingers aren't my fingers  
These hands are not my hands  
No one sees and no one cares What gets broken  
Not for rhyme and not for reason  
What gets broken  
What gets broken  
  
Going far,  
Getting nowhere  
Going far,  
The way you are  
  
Going far,  
Getting nowhere  
Going far,  
The way you are  
  
Going far,  
Getting nowhere  
The way you are  
  
Going far,  
Getting nowhere  
The way you are  
  
In the river my machinery  
Slows to a heartbeat  
Echoing ghost just laid by  
Those who whistle while they work  
Out of time and out of season  
What gets broken  
  
Going far,  
Getting nowhere  
Going far,  
The way you are  
  
Going far,  
Getting nowhere  
Going far,  
The way you are  
  
Going far,  
Getting nowhere  
The way you are  
  
Going far,  
Getting nowhere  
The way you are
