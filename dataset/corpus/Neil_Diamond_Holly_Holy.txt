Holly holy eyes  
Dream of only me  
Where I am, what I am  
What I believe in  
Holly holy  
Holly holy dream  
Wanting only you  
And she comes  
And I run just like the wind will  
Holly holy  
  
(Sing) Sing a song  
(Sing) Sing a song of songs  
(Sing) Sing it out  
Sing it strong (Sing, sing, sing, sing)  
Yeah  
Yeah  
  
Call the sun in the dead of the night  
And the sun's gonna rise in the sky  
Touch a man who can't walk upright  
And that lame man, he's gonna fly  
And I fly  
And I fly  
  
Holly holy love  
Take the lonely child  
And the seed  
Let it be filled with tomorrow  
Holly holy
