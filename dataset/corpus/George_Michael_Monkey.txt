Why can't you do it?  
Why can't you set your monkey free?  
Always giving into it  
Do you love your monkey or do you love me?  
  
Why can't you do it?  
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?  
Monkey with a monkey monkey  
La la la  
  
Oh, I count to ten  
But I don't know how  
And I don't know when  
To open my eyes  
  
Baby if you kiss me again  
Like you did just now  
Like you did just then  
Just Do it again  
  
I've had the rest  
Now it's time I had the best  
So you tell me  
That you won't do anymore  
  
Well I'd write your heart a letter  
But I think you know me better  
If I keep on asking baby, maybe  
I'll get what I'm asking for  
  
Why can't you do it?  
Why can't you set your monkey free?  
Always giving in to it  
Do you love your monkey or do you love me?  
  
Why can't you do it?  
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?  
Monkey, with a monkey, monkey  
La la la  
  
Oh, I hate your friends  
But I don't know how and I don't know when  
To open your eyes  
Yes, the monkey's back again  
Do you want him now like you did back then?  
  
I tried my best but your head is such a mess  
So I guess that I don't want you anymore  
Well you say you care about me  
That you just can't do without me  
But you keep on dancin' baby  
'Til that monkey has you on the floor  
  
Why can't you do it?  
Why can't you set your monkey free?  
Always giving into it  
Do you love the monkey or do you love me?  
  
Why can't you do it  
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?  
Monkey, with a monkey, monkey  
La la la  
  
Don't look now  
There's a monkey on your back  
Don't look now  
There's a monkey on you  
Don't look now  
There's a monkey on your back  
Don't look now  
There's a monkey on you  
  
So you tell me  
That you won't do anymore  
If I keep on askin' baby, maybe  
I'll get what I'm askin' for  
  
Why can't you do it?  
Why can't you set your monkey free?  
Always giving into it  
Do you love the monkey or do you love me?  
  
Why can't you do it?  
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?  
Monkey, with a monkey, monkey  
La la la  
  
Why can't you do it?  
Why can't you set your monkey free?  
Always giving into it  
Do you love the monkey or do you love me?  
  
Why can't you do it?  
Why do I have to share my baby with a monkey?  
Monkey, with a monkey, monkey  
La la la
