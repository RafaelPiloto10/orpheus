You gotta keep 'em separated  
  
Like the latest fashion  
Like a spreading disease  
The kids are strappin' on their way to the classroom  
Getting weapons with the greatest of ease  
The gangs stake their own campus locale  
And if they catch you slippin' then it's all over pal  
If one guy's colour and the others don't mix  
They're gonna bash it up, bash it up, bash it up, bash it up  
Hey, man you talkin' back to me?  
Take him out  
You gotta keep 'em separated  
Hey, man you disrespecting me  
Take him out  
You gotta keep 'em separated  
Hey they don't pay no mind  
If you're under 18 you won't be doing any time  
Hey come out and play  
  
By the time you hear the siren it's already too late  
One goes to the morgue and the other to jail  
One guys wasted and the others a waste  
It goes down the same as the thousand before  
No ones getting smarter  
No ones learning the score  
Your never ending spree of death and violence and hate  
Is gonna tie your own rope, tie your own rope, tie your own  
Hey, man you disrespecting me  
Take him out  
You gotta keep 'em separated  
Hey, man you talkin' back to me?  
Take him out  
You gotta keep 'em separated  
Hey they don't pay no mind  
If you're under 18 you won't be doing any time  
Hey come out and play  
  
It goes down the same as the thousand before  
No ones getting smarter  
No ones learning the score  
Your never ending spree of death and violence and hate  
Is gonna tie your own rope, tie your own rope, tie your own  
Hey, man you talkin' back to me?  
Take him out  
You gotta keep 'em separated  
Hey, man you disrespecting me  
Take him out  
You gotta keep 'em separated  
Hey they don't pay no mind  
If you're under 18 you won't be doing any time  
Hey come out and play
