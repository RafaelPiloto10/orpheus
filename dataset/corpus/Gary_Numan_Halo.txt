Who hasn't made  
A big mistake  
Betrayed a love  
Or turned to hate?  
You think it's you  
Who hasn't told  
A small white lie  
Or felt revenge  
Was justified?  
You think it's you  
Who hasn't had  
A secret need  
A truth to hide  
Desires to feed?  
You think it's you  
Who has the strength  
To save us all  
To make us clean  
And break our fall?  
You think It's You  
Does God bleed on the word?  
Does God bleed on your white halo?  
I looked inside  
A big mistake  
I'd make it stop  
But it's too late.  
I Think It's You  
I've never been  
Afraid to face  
A fear but there's  
No darker place  
I Think than You.  
Something crawls  
And something lies  
Something breathes  
And something dies.  
I think it's you  
Does God bleed on the word?  
Does God bleed on your white halo?
