Hey Robbie are you ready for  
this - I'm always ready Tom,  
You know that  
I think you were born ready - Ha ha, Come On  
  
I was born long ago  
I am the chosen, I'm the one  
I have come to save the day  
And I won't leave until I'm done  
So that's why you've got to try  
You got to breath and have some fun  
Though I'm not paid I play this game  
And I won't stop until I'm done  
  
But what I really want to know is  
Are you gonna go my way?  
And I got to got to know  
  
I don' t know why we always cry  
This we must leave and get undone  
We haven't changed and rearranged  
And turn this planet back to one  
So tell me why we got to die  
And kill each other one by one  
we've got to love and rub-a-dub  
We've got to dance and fall in love  
  
But what I really want to know is  
Are you gonna go my way?  
And I got to got to know  
  
But what I really want to know is  
Are you gonna go my way?  
And I got to got to know got to know
