Baby I just don't get it  
Do you enjoy being hurt?  
I know you smelled the perfume, the make-up on his shirt  
  
You don't believe his stories  
You know that they're all lies  
Mad as you are, you stick around and I just don't know why  
  
If I was ya man (baby you)  
Never worry bout (what I do)  
I'd be coming home (back to you)  
  
Every night, doin' you right  
  
You're the type of woman (deserves good things)  
Fist full of diamonds (hand full of rings)  
Baby you're a star (I just want to show you, you are)  
  
You should let me love you  
Let me be the one to give you everything you want and need  
Baby good love and protection  
Make me your selection  
Show you the way love's supposed to be  
  
Baby you should let me love you, love you, love you, love you yeah  
  
Listen  
Your true beauty's description looks so good that it hurts  
You're a dime plus ninety-nine and it's a shame  
Don't even know what you're worth  
Everywhere you go they stop and stare  
Cause you're bad and it shows  
From your head to your toes, Out of control, baby you know  
  
If I was ya man (baby you)  
Never worry bout (what I do)  
I'd be coming home (back to you)  
  
Every night doin' you right  
  
You're the type of woman (deserves good things)  
Fistful of diamonds (hand full of rings)  
Baby you're a star (I just want to show you, you are)

Let me be the one to give you everything you want and need
