Well the first time that I saw ya  
You looked down and out  
And I had my doubts  
About you  
But baby since I've come to know ya  
I ain't got no doubts  
What it's about  
Me and baby  
We're going out tonight  
She's gonna treat me right  
Ooh yeah  
Me and sugar  
We've got it all sewn up  
She fills my loving cup  
We're going head first  
Well the second time that I saw ya  
Man you'd really improved  
I was really moved  
How I wanted you  
I'm knocking at your door  
To see if you're alone tonight  
Cause I need some more  
Of what you got  
Me and baby  
We're going out tonight  
She's gonna treat me right  
Ooh yeah  
Me and sugar  
We've got it all sewn up  
She fills my loving cup  
We're going head first  
Baby baby baby  
Take me in your arms and love me  
Cause you know what I am anyway  
You got me on my knees  
I'm gonna say please if you want me  
Cause I want you so  
I'm never gonna let you go  
Me and baby

She's gonna treat me right  
Ooh yeah
