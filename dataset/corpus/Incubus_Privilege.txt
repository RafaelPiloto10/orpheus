Isn't it strange that a gift could be an enemy?  
Isn't it weird that a privilege could feel like a chore?  
Maybe it's me but this line isn't going anywhere  
Maybe if we looked hard enough, we could find a backdoor  
(Find yourself a backdoor)  
  
I see you in line, dragging your feet  
You have my sympathy  
The day you were born, you were born free  
That is your privilege  
  
Isn't it strange that the man standing in front of me  
Doesn't have a clue why he is waiting, or what he's waiting for?  
Maybe it's me, but I'm sick of wasting energy  
Maybe if I look in my heart I could find a backdoor  
(Find yourself a backdoor)  
  
I see you in line, dragging your feet  
You have my sympathy  
The day you were born, you were born free  
That is your privilege
