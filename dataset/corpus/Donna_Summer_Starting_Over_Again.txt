Mama moved out  
Daddy sold the house  
They split up the money  
And went on their way  
And all the king's horses  
And all the king's men  
Could never put mummy and daddy back together again  
Starting Over Again  
Where should they begin  
'Cause they've never been out on their own  
Starting over again  
Never any end  
When your dreams are all shattered  
And the kids almost grown  
And the whole world cries  
He got an apartment  
She moved in with her sisters  
And he's scheming big deals with one of his friends  
While she sits at home  
Sortin' out pieces  
Of left over memories from thirty odd years  
Starting Over again  
Where do you begin  
When you've never been out on your own  
Starting Over Again  
Never any end  
What will the neighbours say  
(Just) talkin' talk it's small town news  
What will all the neighbours hear  
They just know they disappeared  
(They're) facing fifty years old wrecking up a happy home  
And this far down the road  
You find yourself alone  
Two fools  
Starting Over Again  
Where do you begin  
When you've never been out on your own  
Starting over again  
Never any end  
When your dreams are all shattered  
And the kids almost grown  
And all the king's horses  
And all the king's men  
Could never put mummy and daddy back together  
Back together anymore.....
