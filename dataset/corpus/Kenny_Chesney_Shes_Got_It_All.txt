She's got every quality  
From A all the way to Z  
It's easy to see she's the perfect girl  
  
She's got every single thing  
That makes up my wildest dreams  
Sometimes I still can't quite believe she's holding me 'cause  
  
She's got it all my heart my soul my wishes  
All of my love my hugs my kisses  
Everything that means anything at all  
All my life I been hopin'  
I could give someone such devotion  
Every sweet memory I can recall  
She got it all  
  
You know that I admit  
Someone to love like this  
Only existed in my prayers  
Until I saw her face  
I knew I found the place  
Where I could keep every faith eternally 'cause  
  
She's got it all my heart my soul my wishes  
All of my love my hugs my kisses  
Everything that means anything at all  
All my life I been hopin'  
I could give someone such devotion  
Every sweet memory I can recall  
She got it all  
  
She's got it all my heart my soul my wishes  
All of my love my hugs my kisses  
Everything that means anything at all  
All my life I been hopin'  
I could give someone such devotion  
Every sweet memory I can recall  
She got it all
