Don't take the wrong direction passing through  
Instead of deep reflection of what's true  
For it's a combination of judgments made by you  
That cause a deep dejection all the way through  
  
No relaxation, no conversation, no variation  
In a very dark blue, blue condition  
  
Early rising every day  
You must be enterprising in your way  
For you will hear no laughter, nor see the sun  
Life would be one disaster all the way through  
  
No relaxation, no conversation, no variation  
In a very dark blue, blue condition  
  
Don't take the wrong direction passing through  
Instead of deep reflection of what's true  
For it's a combination of judgments made by you  
That cause a deep dejection all the way through  
  
No relaxation, no conversation, no variation  
In a very dark blue, blue condition  
  
No relaxation, no conversation, no variation  
In a very dark blue, blue condition
