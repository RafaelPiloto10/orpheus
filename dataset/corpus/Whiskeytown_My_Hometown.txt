On back down in my hometown  
Everybody's feelin' it bad  
No new breaks, whatever it takes  
Not to have to sway it on a classified ad  
  
Hey there Ma and Pa here I am  
Money's running out all the same  
I just close my eyes and bring it on home again  
  
Up real late in New York state  
Talkin' to my baby at night  
She keeps me warm and protects me from harm  
Love just keeps on rollin' when the money gets tight  
  
Hey there Ma and Pa where I am  
Money's running out all the same  
I just close my eyes and bring it on home again  
  
Oh Mrs. Memory just take me on down  
Back to the shanties and the cars by the lake  
Oh Mrs. Memory just take me on back  
Back to my baby and make it okay  
Yeah just make it okay  
  
On back down in my hometown  
Everybody's feelin' the same  
Good money spent on keepin' the rent  
Sent in to the man under a week late  
  
Hey there Ma and Pa were I am  
Money's running out all the same  
I just close my eyes and bring it on home again  
I just close my eyes and bring it on home again
