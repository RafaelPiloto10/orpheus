No other love stood the test of time  
Can you imagine how I'd feel if you were mine?  
Once I know it's not make-believe  
It's plain to see that you've got something over me  
  
You hold the key to my secret heart  
Just turn the lock  
And we could be lovers after dark  
And we could be lovers after dark  
  
With other girls it's just been physical  
So many times before I never cared at all  
With you I realize what love could be  
And I could feel that you've got something over me  
  
You hold the key to my secret heart  
Just turn the lock  
And we could be lovers after dark  
And we could be lovers after dark  
  
You hold the key to my secret heart  
Just turn the lock  
And we could be lovers after dark  
And we could be lovers after dark
