When I saw you at the grocery store  
You were sharin a shopping cart with her  
And I couldn't turn and run away  
I didn't know what to say  
You introduced us for the first time  
And I had to look her in the eye  
But you could not imagine my surprise  
Can't you see?  
You're leaving me  
For an ugly girl  
Does she talk about politics?  
And all that stuff that used to make me sick  
Does she smoke cigars and stay up late  
Oh she's so great  
Does she tell you what you want to hear?  
And I bet that she could grow a beard  
I feel better thinking you were queer  
It's not fair  
I can't compare  
To an ugly girl  
To an ugly girl  
Lalalalalalalala Lalalalalalalala Lalalalalalalala  
Lalalalalalalala Lalalalalalalala Lalalalalalalala  
Hahaha the jokes on me  
I feel jealous and I feel mean  
She's so nice that it makes up for her face  
There's no way, do you have to keep your eyes closed  
Do you have to keep the lights down low?  
Oh I bet you wish you had a blind fold  
Can't you see you're leaving me  
For an ugly girl  
For an ugly girl  
She's an ugly girl  
A real ugly girl  
Lalalalalalalala Lalalalalalalala  
Lalalalalalalala Lalalalalalalala  
She's an ugly girl  
An ugly girl  
She's an ugly girl...
