She left the cradle when she learned to crawl  
With mama on the front porch she walked off  
Headed for the city in a pair of high heeled shoes  
And if she'll leave her mama, son, she'll sure leave you  
Don't take it so hard and blame yourself  
'Cause you ain't the first one that she ever left  
She loves her mama but she loves a good time too  
And if she'll leave her mama, son, she'll sure leave you  
Oh, you can give her love and you give her hell  
No matter what you give her, she wants somethin' else  
You know she's gonna do exactly what she wants to  
And if she'll leave her mama, son, she'll sure leave you
