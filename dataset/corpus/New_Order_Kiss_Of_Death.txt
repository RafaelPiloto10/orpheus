I stood there beside myself,  
Thinking hard about the weather  
Then came by a friend of mine  
Suggested we go out together  
Then I knew it from the start:  
This friend of mine would fall apart  
Pretending not to see his gun,  
I said "let's go out and have some fun"  
I know, you know, you believe in a land of love  
I know, you know, we believe in a land of love  
I have always thought about  
Staying here and going out  
Tonight I should have stayed at home,  
Playing with my pleasure zone  
He has always been so strange,  
I'd often thought he was deranged  
Pretending not to see his gun,  
I said "let's go out and have some fun"  
I know, you know, we believe in a land of love  
I know, you know, we believe in a land of love  
When you are alone at night  
You search yourself for all the things  
That you believe are right  
If you give it all away  
You throw away your only chance to be here today  
Then a fight breaks out on your street  
You lose another broken heart in a land of meat  
My friend, he took his final breath  
Now I know the perfect kiss is the kiss of death
