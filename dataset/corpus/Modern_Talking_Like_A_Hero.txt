Baby, come save me  
From pain and from fear  
Maybe I'm crazy  
Still dreaming you are here  
No more tears my baby  
I cry for you  
No more fears, oh maybe  
I'm missing you  
  
Like a hero I will smile again  
Like a hero in the midnight rain  
Like a hero I will go  
Miss you more than you will know  
When you break my heart  
Like a hero I will smile again  
We're a woman, baby and a man  
And I'm needing your sweet love  
Give me more that sweet stuff  
Give me what you've got  
  
Baby, be with me  
It's cold and lonely  
Oceans of sorrows  
A man with no tomorrow  
No more tears, my baby  
I cry for you  
No more fears, oh maybe  
I'm missing you
