Oh I walked through the party in the disco ljght  
Saturday is calling, and I'm feeling alright  
And I get, tired of, being alone  
She has my heart, but she has no home  
And I tried and tried tried it again  
Buy her a drink, want to be her man  
Hey oh, oh high and low  
Oh my baby, come lets go  
  
Oh Ju, Juliet, ail the things you do,  
They drive me mad  
Ju, ju, ju, ju, Juliet  
Baby I can't get you out of my head  
  
I love the nightlife, the crazy nightlife  
In the disco light baby  
I love the nightlife, the crazy nightlife  
Oh keep oh dancing, lady  
  
And we walked to my house it was late at night  
Sunday was calling, see the morning light  
And I get tired of to being with this girl  
She's so complicated, doesn't fit in my world  
And I try and try to send her home  
Called her a taxi, want to be alone  
Hey yo, oh high and low  
Oh my baby, oh please go  
  
Oh Ju, Juliet, all the things you do,  
They drive me mad  
Ju, ju, ju, ju, Juliet  
Baby how I get you out of my bed
