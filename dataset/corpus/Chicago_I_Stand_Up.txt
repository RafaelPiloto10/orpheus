You'll never lose me to temptation  
Fighting the devil and I beat the dragon too  
I'm at your rescue...I'm your faithful one  
If it's the last thing that I ever mean to do  
  
I'm in deeper than you could know  
The wise in me won't let it go  
You can count on me, guarantee  
  
[Chorus]  
I stand up, I stand up, believe in myself  
(If you love somebody, stand)  
I stand up, I stand up, give me a little respect  
(If you need somebody, stand)  
  
Out of the shadow, yet I'm alright  
It's not as easy as I know it used to be  
I don't have time to look behind me  
I know the truth and it's the truth that set me free  
One more heart to heart to live for  
One more time to stop the war  
Inside of me...in spite of me  
  
[Chorus: x2]
