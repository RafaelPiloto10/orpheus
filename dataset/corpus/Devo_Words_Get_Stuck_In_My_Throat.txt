If I had a tiny microphone  
Hidden in my heart  
It would amplify my love for you  
But the words get stuck in my throat  
The words get stuck in my throat  
  
If I had a little view master  
Stuck inside my brain  
It would snap the pictures all of you.  
But the words get stuck in my throat  
The words get stuck in my throat  
  
If I had a telegraph  
Tapping in my brain  
It would tap the Morse code "I love you."  
But the words get stuck in my throat  
The words get stuck in my throat  
  
Hey, hey, hey  
What'd I say?  
Everyday!  
  
The words get stuck in my throat (repeating)
