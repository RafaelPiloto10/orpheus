Your 'fight them on the beaches' speeches make me despair  
'Cause if there's one thing we can guarantee is you will not he there  
Tidying your room, making up your bed  
And if your diary's full that week you'll send us lot instead  
  
Send us lot instead, put a poppy by my lovers bed  
We believe you when you say you've hurt your back  
  
Have you ever been away  
Where were you when we took Calais?  
You don 't know, you don't care  
You 're just glad that you wasn't there  
Have you ever been away  
  
I'm afraid your Rule Britannia mania doesn't ring so true  
If I was captain of the waves I'd turn the gun on you  
Any last requests before you join dead?  
I'll crap into your Union Jack and wrap it round your head  
  
Wrap it round your head, take a look at all the blood we've shed  
We'll believe you when you say it was worth it  
  
Liberate the streets of Europe, give our kids a chance  
Give them Beaujolais by tap and cheap day trips to France  
But you have never seen or smelt this ungodly death  
It's like the stench of roasted lamb upon your father's breath
