Here I am, lost in the light of the moon that comes through my window  
Bathed in blue, the walls of my memory divide the thorns from the roses  
It's you and the roses  
  
Touch me and I will follow in your afterglow  
Heal me from all this sorrow  
As I let you go I will find my way when I see your eyes  
Now I'm living in your afterglow  
  
Here I am, lost in the ashes of time, but who wants tomorrow?  
In between the longing to hold you again  
I'm caught in your shadow, I'm losing control  
My mind drifts away, we only have today  
  
Touch me and I will follow in your afterglow  
Heal me from all this sorrow  
As I let you go I will find my way  
I will sacrifice 'til the blinding day when I see your eyes  
Now I'm living in your afterglow  
  
When the faith has gone as I let you go, as I let you go  
  
Touch me and I will follow in your afterglow  
Heal me from all this sorrow  
As I let you go I will find my way, I will sacrifice  
Now I'm living in your afterglow  
  
Bathed in blue, the walls of my memory divide the thorns from the roses  
It's you who is closest
