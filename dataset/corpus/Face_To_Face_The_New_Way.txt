You're alright, you're alive, you're the number one  
They said that you're not ashamed of what you've done  
Everyone makes mistakes  
Make it up you'll be OK  
That's what they tell you  
You won't get the special treatment  
I don't care what you do or say  
Don't let them tell you what you're already thinking  
It's a no win situation  
  
Well enough of the old way  
It's not working and the rules have already changed  
What we need is a new way  
There's something else just a little bit better  
It's on the way  
  
You're a drag, you're a bore, you're a rainy day  
You take offense to almost everything they do or say  
Everyone makes mistakes  
Make it up you'll be OK  
I tried to tell you
