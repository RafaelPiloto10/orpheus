Now they say Hank Jr. has strayed away  
From all them songs that put his daddy in an early grave  
But his daddy would be proud if he could see Bocephus now  
Why don't you leave that boy alone, let him sing his song?  
  
Oh, Waylon has been known to play half time  
He been known to get out of his mind  
Don't know whether he's right or wrong  
He's got a string of hits about two miles long  
Why don't you leave that boy alone, let him sing his song?  
  
Why don't you leave them boys alone let 'em sing their song  
You know they're gonna do whatever they want.  
If you don't like the way they sing who's gonna cast the first stone?  
Why don't you leave them boys alone, let 'em sing their song?  
  
Hank Williams was the king of country soul  
My dad took me to see him in Lubbock but he didn't show  
Now the people got mad and they all went home  
The first thing we did was put his records on.  
I guess we should have left him alone and let him sing his songs.  
  
Why don't you leave them boys alone, let 'em sing their song  
You know they're gonna do whatever they want.  
If you don't like the way they sing who's gonna cast the first stone?  
Why don't you leave them boys alone, let 'em sing their song?  
  
Why don't you leave them boys alone, let 'em sing their song?
