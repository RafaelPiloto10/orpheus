Lately I just don't... Everything  
But some secrets I meant to keep  
So rest and sure that I ain't listening  
I keep my head down so I can't see anything  
What I don't know can't hurt  
  
Chorus  
Cause you are my escape from everything  
In this place be my holiday  
Love it and...  
You are my escape  
You are my escape  
... Just like the movie  
  
Some say that ignorance is best  
Well I am the one to disagree  
If there ain't love...  
Lately I just don't... Everything  
But some secrets I meant to keep  
So rest and sure that I ain't listening  
Close the door and keep on continuing  
But I what I don't know can't hurt  
  
Cause you are my escape from everything  
... Everything  
I am in this place... Love it...  
You are my escape oh nu  
You are my escape  
Let's keep it just like the movie  
  
You are like a good book I get lost in  
The perfect place to run and hide away  
Don't wanna pressure you to the next chapter  
Cause I don't know how it ends  
  
Chorus  
Cause you are my escape from everything  
In this place be my holiday  
Love it and...  
You are my escape  
You are my escape  
Let's keep it just like the movie
