Happy, happy birthday baby  
Although you're with somebody new  
Thought I drop a line to say  
That I wish this happy day would find me beside you.  
Happy, happy birthday baby  
No I can't call you my baby  
Seems like years it was we met  
On a day I can't forget  
Because that's when we fell in love  
Do you remember, the names we had for each other  
I was your pretty, you were my baby  
How could we say goodbye?  
Hope I didn't spoil your birthday  
I'm not acting like a lady  
So I close this note to you  
With good luck and wishes too  
Happy, happy birthday baby
