Give me one kiss, one kiss, that's what I want from you  
I just want to kiss your lips, that's what I want to do  
Eleven-thirty, the lights are low  
Just one more kiss dear, before I go  
Give me one kiss, one kiss, that's what I want from you  
  
I'll hold you closer at your front door  
We may have time left for three or four  
Give me one kiss, one kiss, that's what I want from you  
Ah, come on, just one little kiss
