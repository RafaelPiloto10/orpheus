Here I am, all alone, been two days since you've been gone  
Three a.m., wide awake, yeah I'm lonely, and I can't take it  
You win a few, you lose a few, but I can't help missing you  
Can't sleep at night, ain't feelin' right, but I'm gonna get to you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Come hell or high water - I'm gonna love you  
Come hell or high water - gonna hold you  
Come hell or high water - wrap my arms around you  
Come hell or high water  
  
Now you're gone, hurt so bad, feelings I have never had  
Been so long since you've been mine, now I'm wound in the lost and found  
And there you stand, now I know, I'm never gonna let you go  
Ain't foolin' around, no, no, gonna make every minute count  
  
[Chorus] - yeah I'm gonna get to you  
  
Gonna love you, hold you, wrap my arms around you  
Baby don't doubt it, ain't no doubt about it  
  
I'm gonna love you - come hell or high water  
Gonna hold you - come hell or high water  
Wrap my arms around you - come hell or high water - yeah  
  
Come hell or high water - come hell or high water  
Come hell or high water - come hell or high water  
Come hell or high water - come hell or high water  
Come hell or high water - come hell or high water  
Yeah!
