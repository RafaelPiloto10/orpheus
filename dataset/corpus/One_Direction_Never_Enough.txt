[Verse 1: Liam]  
Wanna pull an all nighter and get into something we'll never forget  
Wanna stay up and party the weekend away and not know when to quit  
Wanna drive in the night to the end of the earth and go over the edge  
Wanna wake up with you and say baby let's do it all over again  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Niall]  
Lips so good I forget my name  
I swear I could give you everything  
  
[Chorus: All]  
I don't need my love, you can take it, you can take it, take it  
I don't need my heart, you can break it, you can break it, break it  
I just can't get too much of you, baby, it's never, it's never enough  
Never enough, it's never enough, never enough  
Come on, come on  
  
[Verse 2: Niall]  
Wanna pull an all nighter and get into something we'll never forget  
Wanna stay up and party the weekend away and not know when to quit  
Wanna drive in the night to the end of the earth and go over the edge  
Wanna wake up with you and say baby let's do it all over again  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Louis]  
Lips so good I forget my name  
I swear I could give you everything  
  
[Chorus: All]  
I don't need my love, you can take it, you can take it, take it  
I don't need my heart, you can break it, you can break it, break it  
I just can't get too much of you, baby, it's never, it's never enough  
Never enough, it's never enough, never enough  
Come on, come on  
Come on, come on  
  
[Bridge]  
Too much is never enough, too much is never enough  
Too much is never enough, too much  
Too much is never enough, too much is never enough  
Too much is never enough, too much is never enough  
Never enough, never enough  
Never enough, never enough  
  
[Chorus: All]  
I don't need my love, you can take it, you can take it, take it  
I don't need my heart, you can break it, you can break it, break it  
I just can't get too much of you, baby, it's never, it's never enough  
Never enough, it's never enough, never enough  
I don't need my love, you can take it, you can take it, take it  
I don't need my heart, you can break it, you can break it, break it  
I just can't get too much of you, baby, it's never, it's never enough  
Never enough, it's never enough, never enough  
Come on, come on  
Come on, come on
