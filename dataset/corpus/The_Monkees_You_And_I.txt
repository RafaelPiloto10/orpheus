You and I have seen what time does, haven't we?  
We both had time to grow  
You know we've got more growing to do, me and you  
And the rest of them too  
  
You can see the changes we've been going through  
Such a pity, what a shame  
Who can we blame?  
You and me, me and you, and the rest of them too  
  
In a year or maybe two  
We'll be gone and some one new will take our place  
There'll be another song,  
Another voice, another pretty face  
  
You and I have seen what time does haven't we?  
We've both had time to grow  
You know we've got more growin' to do  
Me and you, and the rest of them too
