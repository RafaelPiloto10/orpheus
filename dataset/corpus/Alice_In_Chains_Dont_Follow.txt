Hey, I ain't never coming  
Home  
Hey, I'll just wander my  
Own road  
Hey, I can't meet you here tomorrow  
Say goodbye don't follow  
Misery so hollow  
  
Hey you, you're livin'  
Life full throttle  
Hey you, pass me down that  
Bottle, yeah  
Hey you, you can't shake  
Me round now  
I get so lost and don't  
Know how  
And it hurts to care, so I won't now  
  
Forgot my woman, lost my  
Friends  
Things I'd done and where  
I've been  
Sleep in sweat the mirrors  
Cold  
See my face it's growin'  
Old  
Scared to death no reason  
Why  
Do whatever to get me by  
Think about the things I  
Said  
Read the page it's cold  
And dead  
  
Take me home  
Yeah, take me home  
Take me home  
Take me home, yeah  
Take me home  
  
Say goodbye, don't follow
