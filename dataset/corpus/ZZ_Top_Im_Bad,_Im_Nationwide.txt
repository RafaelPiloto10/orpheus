Well I was rollin' down the road in some cold blue steel,  
I had a blues man in back, and a beautician at the wheel.  
We going downtown in the middle of the night  
We laughing and I'm jokin' and we feelin' alright.  
Oh I'm bad, I'm nationwide.  
Yes I'm bad, I'm nationwide.  
  
Easin' down the highway in a new Cadillac,  
I had a fine fox in front, I had three more in the back.  
They sportin' short dresses, wearin' spike-heel shoes,  
They smokin' Lucky Strikes, and wearing nylons too.  
'Cause we bad, we nationwide.  
Yeah we bad, we nationwide.  
  
Well I was movin' down the road in my V-8 Ford,  
I had a shine on my boots, I had my sideburns lowered.  
With my New York brim and my gold tooth displayed,  
Nobody give me trouble cause they know I got it made.  
I'm bad, I'm nationwide.  
Well I'm bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, I'm nationwide.
