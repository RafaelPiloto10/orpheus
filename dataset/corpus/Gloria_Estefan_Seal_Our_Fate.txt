Hey hey  
They say it's never too late and though  
That might be the case sometimes  
Sad truth of it is opportunity won't knock twice  
Put off until tomorrow but tomorrow might never come  
Gotta think about the future, today soon will be long gone  
Where will you be a few years down the line?  
Will it be everything you've dreamed of?  
(Everything you've dreamed of?)  
Always harder to do what is right  
Sometimes one bad decision can mess up your life  
Seal our fate with the choices we make  
But don't give a second thought to all the chances we take  
Could come up anytime, better be wide awake  
'Cause we seal our fate with the choices we make  
Seal our fate, we seal our fate  
Seal our fate, seal our fate with the choices we make  
Surely, you say, it's not as bad as you make it sound  
If we make a mistake, we can always turn it back around  
(Turn it back around)  
Get back on the straight narrow when I'm through having all my fun  
After all it's my decision, I'm not really hurting anyone  
Before you know it's gotten way out of hand  
In a ways that you had never dreamed of  
(You had never dreamed of)  
Never worth the price you pay in the end  
Instead of being ahead, started over again  
Seal our fate with the choices we make  
Don't give a second thought to the chances we take  
Could come up anytime, better be wide awake  
'Cause we seal our fate with the choices we make  
Seal our fate, yes, we seal our fate  
We seal our fate, seal our fate with the choices we make  
Hey, hey  
Hey, hey  
Hey, hey  
Before you know it's gotten way out of hand  
In ways that you had never dreamed of

Never worth the price you pay in the end  
Instead of being ahead you're started over again  
Seal our fate with the choices we make  
Don't give a second thought to the chances we take  
Could come up anytime, better be wide awake  
'Cause we seal our fate with the choices we make  
(Seal our fate)  
Hey, our fate  
(Seal our fate)  
That's a first step we take  
(Seal our fate)  
Yes, we seal our  
We seal our fate with the choices we make  
Seal our fate  
Fate, what would you do?  
(Seal our fate)  
It comes back to you  
(Seal our fate)  
Seal our fate  
Seal our fate with the choices we make  
Seal our fate  
Yea, we do  
Yes, we seal our fate  
Seal

Yes, we seal our fate with the choices we make
