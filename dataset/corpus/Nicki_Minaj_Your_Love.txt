[Chorus]  
Shawty I'm a only tell you this once,  
You the illest (bah ba bah bah oh)  
And for your lovin' I'm a Die Hard like Bruce Willis (bah ba bah bah oh)  
You got spark, you, you got spunk  
You, you got something all the girls want  
You're like a candy store  
And I'm a toddler  
You got me wantin' more and mo mo more and  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
Your love, your love (yeah)  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
Your love, your love  
  
He the type to pop tags and be cockin' the brim  
Might breeze through the Ave, might stop at the gym  
And he keep a du rag, keep the wave on swim  
Wa' waves on swim so they hate on him  
Anyway I think I met him sometime before  
In a different life or where I record  
I mean he was Adam, I think I was Eve  
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree  
'S' on my chest cause I'm ready to save him  
Ready to get buck on anybody that plays him  
And I think I love 'em, I love 'em, jus' like I raised him  
When he call me momma, lil' momma, I call him baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
Your love, your love (yeah)  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
Your love, your love  
  
He they type to keep a couple hundred grand in the rubber band  
Just left money gram in the lemon Lam'  
Hot damn make me scream like summer jam  
I mean that nigga must be from the motherland  
Anyway I think I met him in the sky  
When I was a geisha he was a samurai  
Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai  
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly  
"S" on my chest lemme get my cape on  
He's so thugged out, Ghostface and Raekwon  
Konvict, just like Akon  
Cause you know snitches be puttin' the Jake on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
Your love, your love (yeah)  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
Your love, your love  
  
Find me in the dark  
I'll be in the stars  
Find me in your heart  
I'm in need of your love  
Your love, your love, your love  
Baby, your the illest (illest, illest)  
Your love (love, love)  
Your love (love, love)
