I'm gonna get it and we gonna get it and you gona feel it and you gonna get it  
I'm gonna get it and we gonna get it and you gonna get it and you gonna feel
it  
I'm gonna get it and we gonna get it and you gona feel it and you gonna get it  
I'm gonna get it and we gonna get it and you gonna get it and you gonna feel
it  
  
[Chorus :]  
I'mma shine, I'm gonna make it  
Ain't nothing to it to it  
Ill take it (i take it)  
I feel it (i feel it)  
Ill flip it (ill flip it)  
Pull it pull it ill straight get it  
I'mma climb  
I ain't waitin'  
There's no end to the money I'm makin'  
For streetin for chasin' we get it in  
The crunk hatin'  
  
If ya don't believe you don't succeed  
And if ya don't apply you won't achieve  
Keep ya head up high  
Feet down low and follow your heart  
To get to the door  
  
If there is a will then here's a way (not bells and wheels and wheels away)  
Never trust a soul I'm here to say  
Stop dependin' and be yourself  
And grab a hold and don't look left  
So take a swing now here's your chance  
You got nothing to lose so make a stance  
See the clock is tickin' and time ain't waitin' when ya  
All alone see that's what your facin'  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Ya I know I'mma make it I was meant for this  
I'mma with ya in the eye lookin' for the ten for this  
And I don't steal for this I pimp for this  
Ride round with a hundred round clip for this  
What happen to the struggle its called  
And eviction notice  
Now people strong self eviction notice  
Prescription cops serve keep it real  
That fine but if I get wit it I'mma face some time  
And its hard being young and rich  
Trying to survive  
Trying to keep a shot to shine  
On the poor headed ties  
Couple mill  
And I buy new whip for the wife  
Talk that shit but this is my life  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I'm gonna get it and we gonna get it and you gona feel it and you gonna get it  
I'm gonna get it and we gonna get it and you gonna get it and you gonna feel
it  
I'm gonna get it and we gonna get it and you gona feel it and you gonna get it  
I'm gonna get it and we gonna get it and you gonna get it and you gonna feel
it  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]  
  
I'm gonna get it and we gonna get it and you gona feel it and you gonna get it  
I'm gonna get it and we gonna get it and you gonna get it and you gonna feel
it  
I'm gonna get it and we gonna get it and you gona feel it and you gonna get it  
I'm gonna get it and we gonna get it and you gonna get it and you gonna feel
it
