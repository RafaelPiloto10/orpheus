I need you here beside me to chase the night away  
I need your love to guide me safe through another day  
I lie and watch the lights go down  
Say goodnight to another town  
And though it hurts to be alone  
I have my thoughts of you to keep me warm  
  
In the afterglow of your love  
Dreamings all I'm guilty of  
Everyday I'm playing tough  
But read my mind  
  
If you could see me now  
Just living my life in a limbo  
If you could see me now  
The me that only you would know  
Still burning in the afterglow  
  
When the beat of the drum has faded  
The show comes to an and  
The stage is clear and loaded  
And the highway calls again  
I stand and watch the lights go down  
  
In the afterglow of your love  
Dreamings all I'm guilty of  
Everyday I'm playing tough  
But read my mind  
  
If you could see me now  
Just living my life in a limbo  
If you could see me now  
The me that only you would know  
Still burning in the afterglow  
  
Stay with me right to the end  
Till I can hold you again
