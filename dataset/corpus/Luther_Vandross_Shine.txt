[Chorus]  
Y'all came here to give it up  
So come on and show me what you got  
It's about to be on, baby, non-stop  
Tonight you're gonna get your time to shine  
Nobody but stars in here tonight  
Dancing underneath the party light  
When I see you working that body right  
Tonight you're gonna get your time to shine  
  
I've been waiting, now I'm ready for the main event  
All the ladies and the players in here just to kill  
Choose a winner who has flavor looking on for style  
Only the best can pass this test, let me check you out  
  
In the midst of a fierce competition  
Get a view from a better position  
A little closer, now you got my attention  
Maybe your my, my, my superstar  
Keep showing me moves that are blazing  
'Cause you're teasing my imagination  
Don't believe I can fight temptation  
I think you already know that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Your time, your time to shine  
Shine, shine, shine, shine, groove shine  
Your time, your time to shine  
Shine, shine, shine, shine, it's alright  
  
Spotlight search for someone special, could you be the one?  
If you're nothing, don't get jealous, just keep moving on  
Feet to the beat, so hot the heat, spraying off the shine  
So cling, so fresh, a real good kiss, so I'm gonna make you mine  
  
In the midst of a fierce competition  
Get a view from a better position  
A little closer, now you got my attention  
Maybe your my, my, my superstar  
Keep showing me moves that are blazing  
'Cause you're teasing my imagination  
Don't believe I can fight temptation  
I think you already know that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Your time, your time to shine  
Shine, shine, shine, shine, groove shine  
It's alright, alright to shine  
Shine, shine, shine, shine, it's alright  
  
Y'all came here to gave it up  
It's about to be on, baby, non-stop  
Nobody but stars in here tonight  
When I see you working that body right  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Your time, your time to shine  
Shine, shine, shine, shine, groove shine  
It's alright, alright to shine  
Shine, shine, shine, shine, it's alright
