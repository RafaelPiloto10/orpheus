I don't want to wonder if this is a blunder  
I don't want to worry whether we're going to stay together till we die  
I don't want you jumping unless this music's thumping  
All the dishes rattle in the cupboards when the elephants arrive  
  
I want to love you madly  
I want to love you now  
I want to love you madly  
I want to love you, love you, love you madly  
  
I don't want to fake it, I just want to make it  
The ornaments look pretty but they're pulling down the branches of the tree  
I don't want to think about it, I don't want to talk about  
When I kiss your lips I want to sink down to the bottom of the sea  
  
I want to love you madly  
I want to love you now  
I want to love you madly  
I want to love you, love you, love you madly  
  
I don't want to hold back, I don't want to slip down  
I don't want to think back to the one thing that I know I should have down  
I don't want to doubt you, know everything about you  
I don't want to sit across the table from you wishing I could run  
  
I want to love madly  
I want to love you now  
I want to love you madly  
I want to love you, love you, love you madly
