Blue night and you, alone with me  
My heart has never known such ecstasy  
Am I on earth, am I in heaven?  
  
Can it be the trees that fill the breeze with rare and magic perfume?  
Oh, no, it isn't the trees, it's love in bloom  
Can it be the spring that seems to bring the stars right into this room?  
Oh, no, it isn't the spring, it's love in bloom  
  
My heart was a desert  
You planted a seed  
And this is the flower  
This hour of sweet fulfillment  
  
Is it all a dream, the joy supreme that came to us in the gloom?  
You know it isn't a dream, it's love in bloom  
  
My heart was a desert  
But you planted a seed  
And this is the flower  
This hour of sweet fulfillment  
  
Is it all a dream, the joy supreme that came to us in the gloom?  
You know it isn't a dream, it's love in bloom
