Falling in love with love is falling for make believe  
Falling in love with love is playing the fool  
Caring too much is such a juvenile fancy  
Learning to trust is just for children in school  
  
I fell in love with love one night when the moon was full  
I was unwise with eyes unable to see  
I fell in love with love, with love everlasting  
But love fell out with me  
  
Oh, I fell in love with love one night when the moon was full  
I was unwise with eyes unable to see  
I fell in love with love, with love everlasting  
But love fell out with me
