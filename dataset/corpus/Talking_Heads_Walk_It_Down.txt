I...I am just a number  
I...hang on to what I got  
You...say what you want to  
I...I...I...I just try to stay alive  
I...put myself together  
People say, get away, somebody will turn you in  
Life, life without surrender  
Togetherness...ecstasy is what I need  
I can laugh, but I should cry  
When love and understanding are the ultimate crimes  
  
[Chorus]  
(And I said) Walk it down. Talk it down.  
(oh, oh, oh) Sympathy. Luxury.  
Somebody will take you there.  
Walk it down. Talk it down.  
(oh, oh, oh) Sympathy. Luxury.  
Somebody will take you there.  
  
She...says she remembers.  
Time...long time ago.  
We...belong together.  
I...I...I...I turn up the radio  
Lies, lies and propaganda  
I...gonna tell you what I need  
Life, life, without surrender  
Togetherness...ecstasy is what I need  
I got yours and you got mine  
And I can swim, but I should fly  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ain't no crime to believe  
I took my money, I bet my life  
What you see is what you get  
But it sure ain't what we need.  
  
[Chorus]
