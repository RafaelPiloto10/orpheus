There are times when I feel like nothing's been achieved  
Torn by indecision, it's not hard to believe it  
That all of our hopes and all of our dreams  
Wrapped up in chains just waiting to be free  
I got to tell you all about it  
  
Man killing man and words are afar  
So many dreams and I'm dark  
Close all the windows and lock all the doors  
Deceiving your friends and using us all  
I got to tell you, doo, doo, doo, yeah  
  
There are times when I feel like nothing's been achieved  
Torn by indecision, it's not hard to believe it  
That all of our hopes and all of our dreams  
Wrapped up in chains just waiting to be free  
I got to tell you, doo, doo, doo  
All you do, doo, doo  
Wouldn't that be friends [?]  
I love you like I do  
I try to tell you, doo, doo, doo  
Doo, doo, loo, loo
