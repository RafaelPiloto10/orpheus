'There's a place for us, somewhere a time and a place.'  
  
So here we are together  
Just you and me  
Sitting side by side  
Don't know why  
With time just racing by  
But I don't want to go  
  
Well I don't know much about it  
Cause all I am is what you see  
In front of you  
There's no more  
Feels so close and yet so far  
But I don't want to go  
  
Here I am, take my hand  
Here I am, please take my hand  
  
I'd like to sit here with you if that's alright  
If you don't mind I could sit and stare all night  
Sit here waiting for you to hold me tight  
  
It's sad but I know it's true  
You see I know you well  
You'd only laugh at me  
And that would hurt me so  
Just look at me here  
You've got me pleading with you  
But I don't want to go  
  
Cause you know that I love you so  
Yes you know that I love you so  
  
Here. I will be here love  
For you love, I will always be here love  
  
If you look real close  
You'll see my heart is on my sleeve  
And it'll be here waiting  
Waiting for you, waiting for me  
Someone once said that if you truly, truly believe  
You can make things happen  
Make things appear to be all that they seem  
Tell me do you believe?  
  
We'll find a hideaway  
Together we'll find a way  
Somewhere, somehow, we'll find some way  
There must be somewhere  
There must be someplace  
We can find somewhere  
Where they don't know my face  
Believe me we can find it  
Yes we can find it  
Somewhere, there's a place for us  
Somewhere, a time and a place for us  
Somewhere
