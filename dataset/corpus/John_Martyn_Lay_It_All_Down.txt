Darling will you walk with me gentle  
Come walking through the evening air  
And I believe that you can make me feel better  
And I believe that you might always be there  
I want to move out of town  
And follow the sound  
And lay it all down  
  
Darling do you know I've been lonely  
Darling do you know I've been bad  
Darling do you know I've been lied to  
Darling do you know it made me sad  
I want to move out of town  
And follow myself  
And lay it all down
