I've been trying to run my life  
Using every trick I knew.  
I say anything anytime to anybody.  
I do what I always wanted to.  
But that's no way to keep me happy.  
It's an old disguise.  
  
I may be wealthy but I can still be wise  
Drop my old disguise.  
I can't seem to end my day  
Until I feel something's said and done.  
A flashy guitar or a hot new car  
Or at least a little fun.  
But that's no way to keep me healthy.  
It's an old disguise.  
I may be wealthy but I can still be wise  
Drop my old disguise.  
  
Drop it. drop it. it's an old disguise.  
Drop it. drop it. open up your eyes.  
Drop it. drop it. you ain't got nine lives  
Drop it. drop it.
