You use me to get you anything you wanted.  
Oh, but I'm a changed man now, baby,  
And your other friend can get you what you want now.  
If I go through those same things again,  
I'll be worse off than I started.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Girl, you're such a bad influence  
And you've got ways to make me do what you want.  
Girl, you're such a bad influence,  
I've got to stay away.  
  
I've been hurt in all of the worst kind of ways,  
And it's you pretty baby,  
I've just got to stay away from.  
I won't go through those same things again,  
I'm so glad that we parted.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Somebody please, you've got to help me break away.  
You know I don't like this lonely feeling.  
It wasn't meant to be this way.  
I won't go through those same things again,  
I'm so glad we parted.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're such a bad influence,  
And I have got to stay away.  
You're such a bad influence,  
I've got to stay away from you, baby.  
I've got to stay away.
