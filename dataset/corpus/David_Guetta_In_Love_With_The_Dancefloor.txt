Boy, there is something way in all my mind  
I can't come in here with you tonight  
There's been another man in my life for some time!  
And he truly, loosely, he knows how to make me feel like a lady  
I'm sneaking out the night cause he drives me crazy  
He knows how to make me sweat!  
He's the best!  
  
Chorus:  
I'm in love with the dance floor.  
Cause it knows my favorite song!  
In love with the dance floor,  
Cause he really touch me on!  
It's the only place I don't feel alone  
It's the only place I'm at home,  
I'm in love with the dance floor!  
  
Boy, I hope you don't hold against me  
  
Cause my heart belongs to the music  
And there's nothing you can do to fix this!  
Cause it truly, loosely, he knows how to make me feel like a lady  
I'm sneaking out the night cause he drives me crazy  
He knows how to make me sweat!  
He's the best!  
  
Chorus:  
I'm in love with the dance floor.  
Cause it knows my favorite song!  
In love with the dance floor,  
Cause he really touch me on!  
It's the only place I don't feel alone  
It's the only place I'm at home,  
I'm in love with the dance floor!
