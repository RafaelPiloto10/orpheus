You didn't have to love me like you did  
But you did, yes you did, and I thank you  
You didn't have to squeeze me like you did  
But you did, yes you did, and I thank you  
  
If you took your love somewhere else  
I wouldn't know what it meant to be loved to death  
You make me feel, like I've never felt  
Kisses so good I've got to holler for help  
  
You didn't have to squeeze me like you did  
But you did, yes you did, and I thank you  
You didn't have to hold me like you did  
But you did, yes you did, and I thank you  
  
Every day you find something new  
To pull out your bag and fine perfume  
You got me trying to do new things, too  
Just so I could keep up with you  
  
Thank you baby  
  
You didn't have to shake it like you did  
But you did, yes you did, and I thank you  
You didn't have to make it like you did  
But you did, yes you did, and I thank you  
  
All my life I've been short changed  
Without your love baby, it's a crying shame  
Now I know what the girls were talking about  
When they say that you  
  
Ooh, I wanna thank you, baby  
Thank you, honey  
I've got to thank you, oh  
Baby, hey yeah
