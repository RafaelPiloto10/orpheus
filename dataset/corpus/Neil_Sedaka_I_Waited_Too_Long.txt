I waited too long, and now we're apart.  
I never told you what I feel in my heart.  
Somebody new has come along  
I was a fool for waiting too long.  
My life without you won't be the same,  
I should have never played that waiting game.  
I'm so alone now that you're gone,  
I was a fool for waiting too long.  
  
I wasn't smart, I wasn't wise,  
And now I'm by myself with tears in my eyes.  
  
I made my life a life of regret,  
I should have never played hard to get.  
And now I know, I was so wrong,  
I was a fool for waiting too long.  
I was a fool for waiting too long,  
Too long.
