My name is... Some kind like...  
I'm... When you can't sleep and you're still up,  
I get the ball and I'm like... You can't get a...  
You probably got strip... No reason to trip  
I grab like... I smile like John... Come on I'm hard...  
... No loss to...  
... Ain't doing it ain't pursuing no lawsuits  
I ain't suing, I know what I'm doing  
Give you the ball and your life is ruined  
I'm like Rasheed I remind me the spirit of Proof  
I'm happy go lucky  
Balling and grooving  
I'm on the move  
I'm smooth with it  
Give me the ball, you don't know what to do with it  
Shoot it in the basket your other team needs a casket  
Lebron saying, don't respond  
There's no back and forth  
This game is little man  
I play aloud and walk away just to shush the crowd  
You trying to touch? Sit down  
  
... Homie that get ugly this is...  
Man I don't think you ready  
I get the crowd rolled up  
Like a you-Haul truck just call me...  
Ain't too... I live you to...  
Man I love this game who the hell you called up,  
You need points on the paint, I'm...  
All my... On the bank and I'm...  
Yeah baby it's true, I'm talking to you  
You already know what to do  
Just pass to me, it just so happens to be  
That I... So... You ain't convinced  
Give it to... Prince we haven't stayed calm since  
Need the ball...  
  
... Homie that get ugly this is...  
Man I don't think you ready  
I said we get everybody the ball...  
I said ahh give me the ball...  
You ain't missing it  
... Basketball Homie, hey yo...
