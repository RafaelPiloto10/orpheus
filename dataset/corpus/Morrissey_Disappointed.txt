Our unsleepable friend  
Gets the message on an ill wind  
"All your friends and your foes  
Would rather die than have to touch you"  
To say the least: I'm truly disappointed  
  
Truly, truly, truly, oh...  
Drank too much  
And I said too much  
And there's nowhere to go - but down  
  
Young boy - I want to help you  
See these lines? : truly disappointed  
  
Truly, truly, truly, oh...  
Don't talk to me, no  
About people who are "nice"  
'Cause I have spent my whole life  
In ruins  
Because of people who are "nice"  
Oh, this world may lack style, I know  
Each bud must blossom and grow, oh...  
  
Young girl, one day you will be old  
But the thing is, I love you now  
Mmm...  
  
This is the last song I will ever sing (yeah!)  
No: I've changed my mind again (aaw...)  
  
Goodnight  
  
And thank you
