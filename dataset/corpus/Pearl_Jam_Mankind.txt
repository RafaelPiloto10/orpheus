You'll be...going out with radio...  
Going out with disco...going out like bacchanal...  
I'll be...going out with telephone...  
Going out alone...to the radar zone...  
It's all just inadvertent imitation and I don't mean mine  
It's all across this nation...  
If it's just inadvertent simulation a pattern in all mankind  
What's got the whole world fakin' it?  
I'll be...playing with my magazine...  
Using up my Listerine...Like Ovaltine...  
And you'll be...you're dippin' in your battleship...  
For the latest tip...for the latest dream...  
It's all just inadvertent, imitation, and I don't mean mine  
It's all across this nation...  
If it's just inadvertent, simulation, a pattern in all mankind  
What's got the whole world fakin' it?  
If it's just inadvertent, imitation, a pattern in all mankind  
What's got the whole world fakin' it?  
What's got the whole world fakin'? (4x)  
What's got the whole world fakin' it, yeah?
