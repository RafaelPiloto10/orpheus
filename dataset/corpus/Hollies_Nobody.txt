I don't have nobody  
I don't need nobody  
I don't want nobody  
To fall in love with me  
To fall in love with me  
  
And I'm telling you  
I'm here on my own-some  
Everyday I get more lonesome  
But I don't want nobody  
To fall in love with me  
To fall in love with me  
  
I'm just telling you girl  
I don't want you hanging round  
I'm just telling you girl  
You gotta stop at putting me down  
  
[Verse 1 ]  
To fall in love with me  
To fall in love with me
