I'm breakin' rocks in the hot sun, i fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won, i needed money ''cause i had none  
I fought the law and the law won, i fought the law and the law won  
I left my baby and i feel so bad, i guess my race is run  
She's the best girl i ever had, i fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won, i was robbing people with a six gun  
I fought the law and the law won, i fought the law and the law won  
I miss my baby and good fun, i fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won, i left my baby and i feel so bad  
I guess my race is run, she's the best girl i ever had  
I fought the law and the law won, i fought the law and the law won
