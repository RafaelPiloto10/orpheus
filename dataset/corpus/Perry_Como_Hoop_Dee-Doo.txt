Hoop-Dee-Doo, Hoop-Dee-Doo  
I hear a polka and my troubles are through  
Hoop-Dee-Dee, Hoop-Dee-Dee  
This kind of music is like heaven to me  
Hoop-Dee-Doo, Hoop-Dee-Doo  
Has got me higher than a kite  
Hand me down my soup and fish, I am gonna get my wish  
Hoop-Dee-Doin' it tonight  
  
When there's a trombone playin'  
I get a thrill, I always will  
When there's a concertina stretched about a mile  
I always smile 'cause that's my style  
When there's a fiddle in the middle oh it really is a riddle how he plays a
tune so sweet  
Plays a tune so sweet that I could die Lead me to the floor and hear me yell
for more  
'cause I'm a Hoop-Dee-Doin' kind of guy
