How many times  
Do we tire of all the little battles  
Threaten to call it quits  
Tempted to cut and run?  
How many times  
Do we weather out the stormy evenings  
Long to slam the front door  
Drive away into the setting sun?  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Keep going on till dawn  
How many times must another line be drawn?  
We could be down and gone  
But we hold on  
  
How many times  
Do we chaff against the repetition  
Straining against the faith  
Measured out in coffee breaks?  
How many times  
Do we swallow our ambition  
Long to give up the same old way  
Find another road to take?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Keep holding on so long  
'Cause there's a chance that we might not be so wrong  
We could be down and gone  
But we hold on  
  
How many times  
Do we wonder if it's even worth it?  
There's got to be some other way  
Way to get me through the day  
  
[Chorus x2]
