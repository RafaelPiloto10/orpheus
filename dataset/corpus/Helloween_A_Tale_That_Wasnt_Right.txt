Here I stand all alone  
Have my mind turned to stone  
Have my heart filled up with ice  
To avoid it's breakin' twice  
  
Thanks to you, my dear old friend  
But you can't help, this is the end  
Of a tale that wasn't right  
I won't have no sleep tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
In my heart, in my soul  
I really hate to pay this toll  
Should be strong, young and bold  
But the only thing I feel is pain  
  
It's alright, we'll stay friends  
Trustin' in my confidence  
And let's say it's just alright  
You won't sleep alone tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
With my heart, with my soul  
Some guys cry you bought and sold  
They've been strong, young and bold  
And they say, play this song again  
  
[Chorus]
