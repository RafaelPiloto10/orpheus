How can this be?  
Why is he the chosen one?  
Saint gone astray,  
With a scepter and a gun.  
Learn to believe  
In the mighty and the strong.  
Come bleed the beast  
Follow me it won't be long.  
  
Listen,  
When the prophet  
Speaks to you.  
Killing  
In the name of God.  
Passion  
Twisting  
Faith into  
Violence.  
In the name of God.  
  
Straight is the path,  
Leading to your salvation.  
Slaying the weak,  
Ethnic elimination.  
Any day,  
We'll all be  
Swept away.  
You'll be saved  
As long as  
You obey  
Lies,  
Tools of the devil  
Inside,  
Written in Holy  
Disguise.  
Meant to deceive and  
Divide us all.  
  
Listen,  
When the prophet  
Speaks to you.  
Killing  
In the name of God.  
Passion  
Twisting  
Faith into  
Violence.  
In the name of God.  
  
Blurring the lines  
Between virtue and sin,  
They can't tell  
Where God ends,  
And mankind begins.  
  
They know no other  
Life but this.  
From the cradle  
They are claimed.  
  
Listen,  
When the prophet  
Speaks to you.  
Killing  
In the name of God.  
Passion  
Twisting  
Faith into  
Violence.  
In the name of God.  
  
Hundreds of believers,  
Lured into a doomsday cult.  
All would perish  
In the name of God.  
  
Self-proclaimed messiah,  
Led his servants  
To their death.  
Eighty murdered  
In the name of God.  
  
Forty sons and daughters,  
Unconsenting plural wives,  
Perversions  
In the name of God.  
  
Underground religion,  
Turning toward  
The mainstream light,  
Blind devotion  
In the name of God.  
  
Justifying violence,  
Citing from the Holy Book,  
Teaching hatred  
In the name of God.  
  
Listen,  
When the prophet  
Speaks to you.  
Killing  
In the name of God.  
Passion  
Twisting  
Faith into  
Violence.  
In the name of God.  
  
Religious beliefs,  
Fanatic obsession,  
Does following faith  
Lead us to violence?  
  
Unyielding crusade,  
Divine revelation,  
Does following faith  
Lead us to violence?
