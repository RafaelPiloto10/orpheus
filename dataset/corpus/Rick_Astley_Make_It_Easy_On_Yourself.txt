If you really love him  
And there's nothing I can do  
Don't try to spare my feelings  
Just tell me that we're through  
  
And make it easy on yourself  
Make it easy on yourself  
'Cause breaking up is so very hard to do  
  
And if the way I hold you  
Can't compare to his caress  
No words of consolation  
Will make me miss you less  
  
My darling, if this is goodbye  
I just know I'm gonna cry  
So run to him  
Before you start crying too  
  
And make it easy on yourself  
Make it easy on yourself  
'Cause breaking up is so very hard to do  
  
Oh, baby, it's so hard to do  
Breaking up is so very hard to do
