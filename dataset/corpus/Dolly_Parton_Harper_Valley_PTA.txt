I want to tell you all a story 'bout a harper valley widow wife  
Who had a teenage daughter that attended harper valley junior high  
Well her daughter came home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play  
And she said, "mama, i've got a note here from the harper valley pta"  
Well the note says "mrs. johnson, you're wearing your dresses way too high  
It's been reported you've been drinkin' and a runnin' round with men and goin'
wild  
Now we don't believe you ought to be a bringin' up your little girl this way"  
And it was signed by the secretary, harper valley pta  
  
Well it happened that the pta was gonna meet that very afternoon  
And boy, were they surprised as mrs. johnson wore her miniskirt into the room  
And as she walked up to the blackboard i can still recall the word she had to
say  
She said "i'd like to address this meeting of the harper valley pta  
  
Now there's bobby taylor sittin' there and seven times he's asked me for a
date  
And mrs. taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever he's away  
And mr. baker can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town  
And shouldn't widow jones be told to keep her window shades all pulled
completely down  
  
Now mr. harper couldn't be here 'cause he's stayed too long in kelly's bar
again  
And if you smell shirley thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip
of gin  
And then you have the nerve to tell me as a mother you think that i ain't fit  
Well this is just a little payton place and you're all harper valley
hypocrites  
  
Now i wouldn't put you on because it really did, it happened just this way  
That day my mama socked it to the harper valley pta  
That day my mama socked it to 'em at the harper valley pta
