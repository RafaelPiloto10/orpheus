Na na na na na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na na na  
  
If you could feel what I feel  
If I could make you see  
If you could need like I need  
I'd be the air that you breathe  
  
You go straight to my head as I lie in my bed  
I just can't win  
I can't help the state I'm in  
  
It's only love so why is falling in it  
The one thing that you can't do  
It's only love then why am I hurting from it  
It's only love if you're hurting too  
  
Na na na na na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na na na  
  
If you could share my wildest thoughts  
Meet me in my mind  
If you could want the way that I want  
You'd want me all the time  
  
You go straight to my head when I lie in my bed  
I just can't win  
I can't stop the state I'm in  
  
It's only love so why is falling in it  
The one thing that you can't do  
It's only love then why am I hurting from it  
It's only love if you're hurting too  
  
Every dream I dream has got you in  
And every minute with you means everything  
I wanna take you there where you've never been  
In my dreams  
  
You go straight to my head as I lie in my bed  
I just can't win  
I can't help the state I'm in  
  
It's only love so why is falling in it  
The one thing that you can't do  
It's only love so why am I hurting from it  
It's only love if you're hurting too  
  
Na na na na na na na na na  
It's only love if you're hurting too  
Na na na na na na na na na  
It's only love if you're hurting too
