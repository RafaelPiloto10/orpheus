Don't want to wait 'til you know me better  
Let's just be glad for the time together  
Life's such a treat and it's time you taste it  
There ain't a reason on earth to waste it  
It ain't a crime to be good to yourself  
  
[Chorus:]  
Lick it up, lick it up, it's only right now  
Lick it up, lick it up, ooh yeah  
Lick it up, lick it up, come on, come on  
Lick it up, lick it up  
  
Don't need to wait for an invitation  
You gotta live like you're on vacation  
There's something sweet you can't buy with money - lick it up, lick it up  
It's all you need, so believe me honey  
It ain't a crime to be good to yourself  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Come on - it's only right now (it's only right now)  
Ooh yeah (ooh yeah) ooh yeah (ooh yeah), yeah yeah  
  
[Chorus]
