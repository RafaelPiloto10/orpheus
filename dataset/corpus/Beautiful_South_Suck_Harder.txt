If it ain't an epic  
Don't dust it  
If it ain't an epic  
Don't cry for it  
If it ain't perfect girl  
Don't leave this world  
  
If he ain't got style on it  
Don't bust it  
If he ain't got length on it  
Don't weep for it  
If it ain't just perfect, girl  
Don't leave this world  
  
(chorus)  
  
Suck harder  
If you want to make an empty shell  
Suck harder  
If you want to make an empty shell  
If it ain't no vintage  
Don't dust it  
Don't dust it  
  
If it ain't antique  
Well, Mary, don't you weep  
If it ain't well dressed  
Well sister do what's best  
If it ain't just perfect girl  
Don't leave this world  
  
(chorus)  
  
Suck harder if it ain't antique  
Well, Mary, don't you weep  
Don't you weep  
Suck harder
