Nashville tears are lonely signs that point to broken hearts  
Broken lives and families that love has split apart  
Children who miss daddy, mommy's on the run  
The pleasure that is painful and hidden from the sun  
  
Nashville hearts are lonely words that speak of love gone wrong  
Sad and soulful stories and beautiful love songs  
Foe each and every melody of happiness denied  
You know that there's another one that shows the other side  
  
Country love is kisses in the kitchen  
Country love is honest and it's true  
Country love is home with your family  
County love's the way that I love you  
  
Country love is silky nights and warm familiar hands  
Someone who's been there before and always understands  
  
Nashville nights are lonely roads that we've all traveled on  
Sometimes they take you far away or they can bring you home  
If you're lost out on the highway, do not deny the dove  
When Nashville night's the question, the answer's country love  
  
Country love is kisses in the kitchen  
Country love is honest and it's true  
Country love is home with your family  
County love's the way that I love you  
  
Country love is kisses in the kitchen  
Country love is honest and it's true  
Country love is home with your family  
County love's the way that I love you
