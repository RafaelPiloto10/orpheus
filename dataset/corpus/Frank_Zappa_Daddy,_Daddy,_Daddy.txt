Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?  
Ooo-ooo, do you like my new car?  
  
She's such a dignified lady  
She's so pretty and soft  
You can't call her a groupie  
It just pisses her off  
(Yeah)  
She got diamonds and jewelry  
She got lotsa new clothes  
She ain't hurtin' nobody  
So that everyone knows  
That she knows what she wants  
  
Knows what she likes  
Daddy, daddy, daddy . . . oooh!  
Daddy, daddy, daddy . . . oooh!  
Daddy, daddy, daddy  
Look out . . . she's got her eyes on you  
  
She left her place after midnight  
(La la la la la)  
She drove to the club  
(La la la la-ee-ah!)  
You know that her and her partner  
(La la la la la)  
Came here lookin' for love  
(La la la la-ee-ah!)  
They want a guy from a group  
(La la la la la)  
Who's got a thing in a charts  
(La la la la-ee-ah!)  
IF HIS DICK IS A MONSTER  
IF HIS DICK IS A MONSTER  
IF HIS DICK IS A MONSTER  
They will give him their hearts  
  
'Cause they know what they want  
([...] they know about it)  
And they know what they like  
Daddy, daddy, daddy . . . oooh!  
Daddy, daddy, daddy . . . oooh!  
Daddy, daddy, daddy  
Look out . . . they got their eyes on you  
  
FAM-BAM-YAK-A-TA-TAHHH!  
  
They know what they want  
They know what they like  
Daddy, daddy, daddy . . . oooh!  
Daddy, daddy, daddy . . . oooh!  
Daddy, daddy, daddy  
Awright, you got 'em screamin' all night
