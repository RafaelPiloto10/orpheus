Ooh, ah  
Ooh, ah  
Ooh, ah  
Ooh, ah  
Enter Maurice  
My dearest darling, come closer to Maurice so I can whisper  
Sweet words of epismetology in your ear and speak to you of  
The pompitous of love. Even though our road is rough and  
Long, for you to leave me at this time darling, must surely  
Be wrong. So come back and reconsider one more thing. Maurice  
Is the only one to make your little heart sing.  
Ooh mama ooh, ooh mama ooh  
How can you do the things that you do?  
Ooh mama ooh, ooh mama ooh  
I'm gonna buy you some brand new shoes  
I'm gonna buy you some brand new shoes  
Enter Maurice  
I don't know why you won't make no more apple pie. Since you've  
Been gone it's been starvation mama, ever since I lost my  
Probation. Don't you remember the time that you ended up in  
Jail? That's right darling, it was Maurice who went your bail.  
Now, there's just one more thing that I want to say before you turn  
And walk away.  
Bom Bom Bom Bom do wah da di dit  
Bom Bom Bom Bom do wah da di dit  
Bom Bom Bom Bom do wah da di dit...  
Darling please, don't walk out that door, you must reconsider  
Darling, you've done it so many times before. It's not too late,  
It's never too late, precious one, for Maurice to love you.  
Just remember sweetheart, I bought myself a gun and I will be  
The only one.
