My prayer is to linger with you  
At the end of the day  
In a dream that's divine...  
  
My prayer is a rapture in blue  
With the world far away  
And your lips close to mine.  
  
Tonight, while our hearts are aglow,  
Oh, tell me the words that I'm longing to know...  
  
My prayer and the answer you give,  
May they still be the same for as long as we live,  
That you'll always be there  
At the end of my prayer  
  
When the twilight is gone  
And no songbird is singing  
When the twilight is gone  
You come into my heart  
And here in my heart do you stay  
While I pray  
  
Tonight, while our hearts are aglow,  
Oh, tell me the words that I'm longing to know...  
  
My prayer and the answer you give,  
May they still be the same for as long as we live,  
That you'll always be there  
At the end of my prayer
