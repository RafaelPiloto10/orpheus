When a black man can't walk certain streets  
Without being hassled by the pigs  
When the youth are forced into the school system  
Designed to break the will of the kids  
When you don't feel safe walking the streets  
Of your own fucking hometown  
Just cause you look different  
People always try to push you around  
  
So this is freedom  
  
Live in a capitalist system that says  
You gotta work just to survive  
But when you're stuck in a dead end job  
Are you really alive?  
Then they tax us on what we earn  
To pay for their fucking wars  
The cold war, war on drugs  
The secret war out on the poor  
  
Go to school, learn to trade, do as I say you better behave  
If this is freedom how come I feel like a fucking slave?
