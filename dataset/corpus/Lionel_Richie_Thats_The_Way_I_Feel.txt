You are that gentle breeze on a summer's day  
You are the beat inside my heart  
You are that place that I go when I need someone that's real  
I want you to know that's the way I feel  
I can look in your eyes and see every dream I've dreamed  
I can see peace inside your fire  
I can see joy in my life that only your love can reveal  
I want you to know that's the way I feel  
Life is a mystry  
  
How lucky I am that your love has found me  
That for, you are the key that opened the door to a world of  
And yes, I find that this is the my moment of my time  
To really let you know the way you make me feel  
You are that place that I go when I need someone that's real  
A something, a gentle touch, a lover's hand to hold  
Your the passion in my life is real  
I want you to know that's the way I feel
