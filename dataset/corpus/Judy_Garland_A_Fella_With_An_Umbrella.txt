I'm just a fella,  
A fella with an umbrella,  
Looking for a girl who saved her love for a rainy day.  
I'm just a fella,  
A fella with an umbrella,  
Glad to see the skies of blue have turned into skies of gray.  
Raindrops have brought us together and that's what I longed to see.  
Maybe the break in the weather will prove to be a break for me.  
So I'll be the fella, the fella with an umbrella,  
If you'll be the girl who saved her love for a rainy day.  
I met a fella,  
A fella with an umbrella,  
Looking for a girl who saved her love for a rainy day.  
I met a fella,  
A fella with an umbrella,  
Waiting for the skies of blue to turn into skies of gray.  
Raindrops will bring us together and that's what I long to see.  
Maybe a break in the weather will prove to be a break for me.  
I told the fella, the fella with the umbrella,  
I could be the girl who saved her love for a rainy day.
