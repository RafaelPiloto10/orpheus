I guess I was foolish to understand  
That fact that I'm leaving my life and starting all over again,  
  
One day sittin back looking at old memories,  
Thinkin bout those little things that you told me,  
But what if I wasn't jokin,  
They're all lookin at those who are provokin,  
Little things that worry me are about to end  
Just like you and me being friends  
If I knew that this was gonna happen,  
Then I would of just said,  
  
[Chorus:]  
The words 'foolish' and 'Leave me alone'  
Don't go together that's what you said to me on the phone  
But I don't think so, those are what I am.  
Sweet dreams little one is what he said,  
You're only foolish, that didn't go to my head  
As little as you are you want left alone  
Confusing as a dog that hates bones  
Most girls love attention but I don't.  
  
Think of me as a distraction  
Stoppping your work stopping your attraction  
Little as I know.  
I'm a girl who likes who no one would ever of dream of me thinking,  
Little as I don't know.  
Whatever caused me to stop the moment  
The moment when I wished say I love you.  
But my dreams go away  
  
[Chorus:]  
The words 'foolish' and 'Leave me alone'  
Don't go together that's what you said to me on the phone  
But I don't think so, those are what I am.  
Sweet dreams little one is what he said,  
You're only foolish, that didn't go to my head  
As little as you are you want left alone  
Confusing as a dog that hates bones  
Most girls love attention but I don't.  
  
We're newlyweds thirteen years later  
I'm dressed in a gown laying down,  
My dream didn't fade.
