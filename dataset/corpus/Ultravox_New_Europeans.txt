In a quiet street washed by the rain, the room within the home.  
A lonely man sits cheek to cheek, with unique designs in chrome.  
The mellow years have long gone by, but now he sits alone.  
He has a brand new radio, but never turns it on.  
  
[Chorus]  
New Europeans.  
Young Europeans.  
New Europeans.  
  
A photograph of lovers lost, lies pressed in magazines.  
Her eyes belong to a thousand girls, she's the wife who's never seen.  
Their educated son has left, in search of borrowed dreams.  
His television's in his bed, he's frozen to the screen.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
On a crowded beach washed by the sun, he puts his headphones on.  
His modern world revolves around the synthesizer's song.  
Full of future thoughts and thrills, his senses slip away.  
He's a European legacy, a culture for today.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Young Europeans.
