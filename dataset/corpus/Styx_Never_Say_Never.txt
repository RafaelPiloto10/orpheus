Never, never, never say never  
Ne dis jamais jamais  
Better, better believe in forever  
And it can be that way  
  
You think that you could never love again  
The one time really tore you apart  
So don't even try to touch your heart  
You're never going to give it again  
  
Never, never, never say never  
Ne dis jamais jamais  
Better, better believe in forever  
And it can be that way  
  
You think that too much joy can only bring pain  
Before you know it, it can be gone  
But give me a chance to prove you're wrong  
You'll never say never again  
  
Never, never, never say never  
Ne dis jamais jamais  
Better, better believe in forever  
And it can be that way  
  
Take time to smell the roses  
Don't hold back your one chance  
It hardly lasts, it hardly lasts  
Better, better believe in forever  
  
Out here I stand with my heart in my hand  
My hopes on a wing and a prayer  
I must have been born with a hole in my head  
Cause I've never said these things before  
  
Never, never, never say never  
Ne dis jamais jamais  
Better, better believe in forever  
And it can be that way
