She walks by moonlight  
No one really knows  
Enchanted starlight  
Never goin' home  
I know she's goin' down, goin'  
Everybody knows, she's so good  
  
Doin' well for others  
She doesn't really know  
The powers are within her  
As she takes off her clothes  
I know she's goin' down, goin'  
Everybody knows, she's so good  
  
Doin' well for others  
She doesn't really know  
The powers are within her  
As she takes off her clothes  
I know she's goin' down, goin'  
Everybody knows, she's so good
