I'm scared of opening the can  
Scared of changing who I am  
Might've taken all I can  
I'm scared of everything I am  
  
Are you a natural woman?  
I know I've got it comin..  
The scent in the air  
And the water running  
  
The damage!  
She said she's not telling it today  
She said "Come back when you're alone"  
"Come back when you're alone"  
The damage The damage  
The damage The damage  
The damn damn dam damage  
  
Are you a natural woman?  
I know I've got it comin'  
Dissent in the air  
And the water running  
  
Don't give me what's in the window, babe  
I want the stuff you think would never sell  
Whatcha have under the counter on the bottom shelf?  
I'll buy the lowdown deepdown primal truthful self  
  
I let the genie out of the box  
I let the genie out of the box  
  
Are you a natural woman?  
I know I've got it comin'  
The scent in the air  
And the water running  
  
Are you a natural woman?  
Tell me you're the million-to-one  
Are you a natural woman?  
Are you a natural woman?  
I'm a natural man.
