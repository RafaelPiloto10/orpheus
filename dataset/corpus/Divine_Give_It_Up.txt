You say that you'll be mine forever  
Although I don't know why  
But if you want to be my lover  
Don't waste my time  
  
I see you out with her around in town  
Each and every day  
But if you want me you must prove yourself  
Give her up today  
  
Chorus  
Give it up, baby give it up  
Give it up, then you can call me up  
Give it up.  
  
Although it's only from a distance  
I've had my eyes on you  
I'm sure you realize the problem  
It's dealt to you  
  
I was not asking much to leave her out  
But everything you do  
And if you ever want somebody else  
I'll find someone too.  
  
(chorus 3x)
