Will you tell me  
All your secrets  
Could you really be sincere  
Whisper all your inhibitions  
The things you most fear  
Don't turn away  
I want to get to know you in the worst, worst way  
Come back baby come back  
Come back baby come back  
Come back baby come back  
Surrender su-su-surrender to me  
Surrender su-su-surrender  
Will you show me  
All your treasures  
That which is most near and dear  
Share with me your  
Prized possessions  
Not just some souvenirs  
Don't be afraid  
A little tiny bit can go a long long way  
Come back baby come back  
Come back baby come back  
Come back baby come back  
Surrender su-su-surrender to me  
Surrender su-su-surrender  
Babe I love you can't you see  
Baby tell me haow you feel about me  
Do you want me  
Do you need me  
Baby tell me honestly  
Do you want me  
Love forever or temporarily  
You've got the key  
So open up your heart and  
Be my destiny  
Come back baby come back  
Come back baby come back  
Surrender su-su-surrender  
Surrender su-su-surrender
