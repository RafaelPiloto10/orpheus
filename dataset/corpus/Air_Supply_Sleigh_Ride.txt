Just hear those sleigh bells jingling ring ting tingling too  
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling Yoo-hoo  
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
  
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up, let's go  
Let's look at the show  
We're riding in a wonderland of snow  
  
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up it's grand  
Just holding your hand  
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairyland  
  
Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we  
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be  
  
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two  
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
  
There's a Christmas party at the home of Farmer Gray  
It would be the perfect ending of a perfect day  
  
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing  
Without a single stop  
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop  
  
There's a happy feeling nothin' in the world can buy  
When they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie  
  
It will nearly be like a picture print of Currier and Ives  
These wonderful things are the things we'll remember all through our lives  
These wonderful things are the things we'll remember all through our lives  
  
Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we  
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be  
  
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two  
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
