Well northern Georgia highway 41  
Beside the carpet mills and the gas stations  
There was a music store slash radio shack  
With the sound of dreamers jammin' in the back  
Well we rocked all night and we rolled all day  
We never bought nothing but we sure did play  
The music was loud and the girls were pretty  
There was always a magic down at Pete's Music City  
Well we had electric guitars just a gathering dust  
And a chrome mike stand with just a little bit of rust  
And a couple of amps with the volume on ten  
And when the last bell ringed that's when the music began  
And we rocked all night...  
[ guitar ]  
Well the years have been long and they ain't been kind  
They say all that's left is the old faded sign  
But the music's still ringing loud in my heart  
Down at Pete's Music City where I got my start  
Well we rocked all night...
