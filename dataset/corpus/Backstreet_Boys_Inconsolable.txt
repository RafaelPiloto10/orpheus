I close the door  
Like so many times, so many times before  
Filmed like a scene on the cutting room floor  
I wanna let you walk away tonight without a word  
  
I try to sleep, yeah  
But the clock is stuck on thoughts of you and me  
A thousand more regrets unraveling  
Oh, if you were here right now,  
I swear I'd tell you this  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby I don't wanna waste another day  
Keepin it inside, it's killing me  
'Cause all I ever wanted comes right down to you, to you  
I wish that I could find the words to say  
Baby I would tell you, every time you leave  
I'm inconsolable  
  
I climb the walls, yeah  
I can see the edge,  
But I can't take the fall, no  
I've memorized the number  
So why can't I make the call  
Maybe 'cause I know you'll always be with me  
In the possibility  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No, no, no  
  
I don't wanna be like this  
I just wanna let you know  
That everything I hold in  
Is everything I can't let go (oh, can't let go)  
  
'Cause  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't you know it baby  
I don't wanna waste another day  
I wish that I could find the words to say  
Baby I would tell you, every time you leave  
I'm inconsolable  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Oh, I'm inconsolable  
Whoa yeah  
I'm inconsolable
