Fire of the sun  
Flowers crumble into dust  
The seed shall scatter and die  
Light in her eyes  
  
Pours black on their lives  
We gather round a funeral pyre  
And here we stand  
In old england's land  
  
Shattered glass on the ground  
There are no words  
To console this earth  
To restore old england's pride  
  
Never in a million or so years  
Did we suffer so much bloodshed  
  
Here comes the man  
With the warm and gentle hands  
Her name burned into his brow  
Scorn in her eyes  
  
Her back to the cries  
We spit upon the life  
That never was  
And here we stand  
  
In old England's land  
The rose is choked by it's thorn  
She will cast salt for your wound  
Old england wears no crown  
  
Never in a million or so years  
Did we suffer so much bloodshed  
We didn't want to hurt you  
But it's not over yet  
No never in a million or so years  
Did we suffer so much bloodshed
