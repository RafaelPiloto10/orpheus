When nightfall comes around and the light of day is gone  
The dark closes in as the last candle burns out  
It's time to send off your mind on a trip  
Into the land of dreams and mist  
  
Is something wrong  
They are lurking in the dark  
  
Heavy breathing but nobody's there  
If that's what you think you'd better beware  
  
Is something wrong  
They are lurking in the dark, watching you  
  
How does it feel to be alone in the dark  
How do you know they won't do any harm  
They can see you but you're oh so blind  
Maybe it only appears in your mind  
  
Is something wrong  
They are lurking in the dark, you'll see
