When somebody loves you  
It's no good unless they love you all the way  
Happy to be near you  
When you need someone to cheer you all the way  
  
Taller than the tallest tree is  
That's how it's got to feel  
Deeper than the deep blue sea is  
That's how deep it goes if it's real  
  
When somebody needs you  
It's no good unless they need you all the way  
Through the good or lean years  
And for all the in-between years, come what may  
  
Who knows where the road will lead us?  
Only a fool would see  
But if you'll let me love you  
For sure I'm gonna love you all the way, all the way  
  
When somebody loves you

All the way
