So you told all the boys that you were gonna take me out  
  
Ya even ya even had the nerve to make a bet a yes you did  
That I, I would give in all of my love you would win  
But you haven't, you haven't won it yet  
You took me for a pushover  
Oh you thought I was a pushover  
Whoa I'm not a pushover  
You thought my love was easy to get  
  
All of the girls think you're fine  
They even call ya Romeo  
Ya got 'em, yeah you got 'em runnin' to and fro  
Yes ya have  
But I don't want a one night thrill  
I want a love that's for real  
And I can tell by your line, your's is not the lasting kind  
  
You took me for a pushover  
Oh you thought I was a pushover  
Whoa I'm not a pushover  
You thought that you could change my mind  
Your temptin' lips (mmm hmm) your way hair (oh yeah)  
Your pretty eyes with that (ahhh) come hither stare  
It makes me weak and I, I start to bend  
And then I stop and think again  
No (no), no (no), no don't let yourself go  
  
I hate to spoil your reputation  
I want true love not an imitation  
And I'm hip to every word in your conversation  
  
Who took me for a pushover  
Whoa I'm not a pushover  
Whoa you thought I was a pushover  
Whoa you can't (push me over)  
Nobody is gonna (push me over)  
Oh you're not man enough to (push me over)  
Everybody thought you was gonna (push me over)
