Somebody got a magic touch  
Somebody just can't get enough  
Your picture's hanging in my car  
I love you for just who you are  
  
And don't you know I want you?, maybe  
Baby  
  
Get your motor running  
Can't you hear me coming?  
And send it to me  
Put it in a letter  
If that'll make it better  
And send it to me, haa  
Stick it in a bottle  
It's always getting hotter  
And send it to me, haa  
Nothing gonna stop it  
So shoot it like a rocket  
And send it to me  
  
I sit behind a desk all day  
And dream of you to get away  
I got no money in the bank  
I don't need much, got you to thank  
  
And don't you know I want you?, maybe  
Baby  
  
Oh, get your motor running  
Can't you hear me coming?  
And send it to me, ah  
Put it in a letter  
If that'll make it better  
And send it to me, haa  
Stick it in a bottle  
It's always getting hotter  
Send it to me, haa  
Nothing gonna stop it  
So shoot it like a rocket  
And send it to me, ahh  
  
Deep in the night, I turn around  
And wish you were here with me  
I grab the sheets and make up a fantasy  
Can't you see  
That you're the one that I love?  
  
Get your motor running  
Can't you hear me coming?  
And send it to me, ooh, oh, oh  
Stick it in a bottle  
Ain't nothing gonna stop it  
So shoot it like a rocket  
Baby, send it to me  
Ahh, oh  
Get your motor running  
Can't you hear me coming?  
And sent it to me, ah, ho
