I was thumbing from Montgomery  
I had my guitar on my back  
When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac  
He was dress like 1950  
Half drunk and hollow eyed  
He said its a long walk to Nashville would you like a ride son  
  
Well I sat down in the front seat  
He turned on the radio  
And them sad old songs coming outta them speakers was solid country gold  
Then I noticed the stranger was ghost white pale  
When I asked him for a light  
And I knew there was something strange about this ride  
  
[Chorus]  
He said drifter can you make folks cry when you play and sing  
Have you paid your dues?  
Can you moan the blues?  
Can you bend them guitar strings?  
He said boy can you make folks feel what you feel inside?  
'Cause if your big star bound let me warn you it's a long hard ride  
  
Well he cried just south of Nashville  
And he turned that car around  
He said this is where you get off boy  
I'm goin' back to Alabam  
And as I stepped outta that Cadillac  
I said mister many thanks  
He said you don't have to call me mister mister  
The whole world calls me Hank  
  
[Chorus]
