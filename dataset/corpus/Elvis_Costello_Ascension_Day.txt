Not a soul was stirring  
Not a bird was singing, at least not within my hearing  
I was five minutes past caring  
Standing in the road just staring  
  
Thought I heard somebody pleading  
I thought I heard someone apologize  
Some fell down weeping  
Others shook their fists up at the skies  
And those who were left  
Seemed to be wearing disguises  
  
Now there's a queen in waiting  
Not enough loving and too much hating  
For the prince hidden within her man  
Always seems to be hesitating  
  
He said, "Let her go, let her go, God bless her"  
"She hasn't been gone long enough for me to miss her"  
"Except every minute of every hour of every day when I wish I could possess
her"  
  
Forty days passed by  
Forty alibis  
So carry on...that way  
And in time...you'll pay  
But we'll all be together  
Come Ascension Day  
  
Not a hound was howling  
Or whimpering or prowling  
Now the wind had departed  
Not a leaf was hanging on the tree like when it started  
  
But I know they will return  
Like they've never gone away  
Come Ascension Day
