Graffiti decorations  
Under the sky of dust  
A constant wave of tension  
On top of broken trust  
The lessons that you taught me  
I learned were never true  
  
Now I find myself in question  
They point the finger at me again  
Guilty by association  
You point the finger at me again  
  
I wanna run away  
Never say goodbye  
I wanna know the truth  
Instead of wondering why  
I wanna know the answers  
No more lies  
I wanna shut the door  
And open up my mind  
  
Paper bags and angry voices  
Under a sky of dust  
Another wave of tension  
Has more than filled me up  
All my talk of taking action  
These words were never true  
  
Now I find myself in question  
They point the finger at me again  
Guilty by association  
You point the finger at me again  
  
I wanna run away  
Never say goodbye  
I wanna know the truth  
Instead of wondering why  
I wanna know the answers  
No more lies  
I wanna shut the door  
And open up my mind  
  
I'm gonna run away, and never say goodbye  
Gonna run away  
Gonna run away  
I'm gonna run away and never wonder why  
Gonna run away  
Gonna run away  
I'm gonna run away and open up my mind  
Gonna run away  
Gonna run away  
Gonna run away  
Gonna run away  
  
I wanna run away  
Never say goodbye  
I wanna know the truth  
Instead of wondering why  
I wanna know the answers  
No more lies  
I wanna shut the door  
And open up my mind  
  
I wanna run away and open up my mind  
I wanna run away and open up my mind  
I wanna run away and open up my mind  
I wanna run away and open up my mind  
I wanna run away and open up my mind  
I wanna run away and open up my mind
