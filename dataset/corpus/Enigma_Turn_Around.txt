Good evening  
This is the voice of enigma  
Feel your body  
Start to move slowly  
Let the rhythm be your guiding light  
  
Feel your body  
Start to move slowly  
Start to move slowly  
Very slowly  
  
The screen behind the mirror, the voice and the snake  
Principles of lust, the eyes of truth, TNT for the brain  
  
Turn around and I will show you something  
Turn around and you will see  
Life, like a real way out, a kind of LSD  
  
Turn around, you're feeling all the changes  
Turn around and you will feel  
You'll reach your holiness  
You are a part of me  
  
Turn around and I will show you something  
Turn around and you will see  
Life, like a real way out, a kind of LSD  
  
Turn around, you're feeling all the changes  
Turn around and you will feel  
You'll reach your holiness  
You are a part of me  
  
Let the rhythm be your guiding light  
Let the rhythm be your guiding light  
Let the rhythm be your guiding light  
Let the rhythm be your guiding light  
Be your guiding light
