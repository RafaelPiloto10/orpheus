At the edge of the world  
The sun pouring down  
We must be heading home  
I completely agree  
I've just been waiting for the right words to come along  
  
Everybody else is wrong  
Doesn't everyone concur, oh no  
Thank you for the vote of confidence  
I feel so much surer now that  
Everybody else is wrong  
  
In the prime of one's life  
One must be aware  
It's such a weary job  
But I've made up my mind  
I've just been waiting for the right choice to come along  
  
Please don't turn out the light  
My pen is on fire  
The masterpiece revealed  
Put your wallets in hand  
If you've been waiting for the answer to come along
