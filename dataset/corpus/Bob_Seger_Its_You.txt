Just about the time I think I've had it  
Everything I've planned has fallen through  
Just about the time the whole thing's crumblin' in  
And I can't hold back no matter what I do  
And just about the time I feel like screamin'  
And findin' me a wall to punch right through  
I look up and I just can't help smilin'  
It's you  
  
You're the only reason I'm still here, girl  
You're the only one who keeps me sane  
Somethin' 'bout the way you've learned to calm me down  
And see me through the anger and the pain  
And just about the time I'm standin' on the edge  
And searchin' for a light to see me through  
I look up and I can see it shinin'  
It's you  
  
I don't really claim to understand it  
I just know the way you make me feel  
No one has to tell me I'm a lucky man  
No one has to tell me that it's real  
  
And just about the time I think I've lost it  
I'm lookin' for a hole to crawl into  
I look up and I just can't believe it  
It's you  
It's you  
  
I look up  
And honey, it's you  
Gettin' me through  
Keepin' it new
