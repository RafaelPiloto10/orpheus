Take my life I lay it down  
At the cross where I am found  
All I have I give to You oh God  
  
Take my hands and make them clean  
Keep my heart in purity  
That I may walk in all You have for me  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh here I stand  
Arms open wide  
Oh I am Yours  
And You are mine  
  
Take my moments and my days  
Let each breath that I take  
Be ever only for You oh God  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My whole life is Yours  
I give it all  
Surrendered to Your Name  
And forever I will pray  
Have Your way  
Have Your way  
  
[Chorus]
