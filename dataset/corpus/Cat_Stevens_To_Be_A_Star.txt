I was seventeen, ou were working for  
Matthew and son,  
(the) beatles me the queen, and I wrote  
I'm gonna get me a gun, yeah, yeah  
It was like a dream in the star machine,  
Oh, no, izitso, izitso?  
I never wanted to be a star, I never wanted  
To travel far  
I only wanted a little bit of love  
So I could put a little love in my heart  
I never wanted to be la-de-da, go to parties  
'avec le bourgeois'  
I only wanted to sing my song well,  
So I could ring a small bell in your heart  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
I was on the road, sleeping between lorry  
Lights, oh no  
Stone-drunk and cold, heading into a bad  
Night, yeah, yeah  
Just another bean in the star machine, hi ho,  
Here I go, here I go  
  
I never wanted to be a star buy my mum a  
Ferrari car  
I only wanted to run my own race,  
So I could win a small place in your heart  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Nature found a way, it picked me up off the  
Dark side, yeah, yeah  
Showed me another day, it made me sing  
'i think I see the light'  
Not another bean in the star machine, oh no,  
This time I won't go  
I never wanted to be a star, I never wanted to travel far  
I only wanted a little bit of love  
So I could put a little love in my heart.
