What you want, honey, you got it  
And what you need, baby, you've got it.  
All I'm asking, is for a little respect  
When I come home, hey now  
Hey hey hey, yeah now  
  
Do me wrong, honey, if you want to  
You can do me wrong honey, while I'm gone.  
All I'm asking, is for a little respect  
When I come home, ooh, yeah now
