There's a jukebox in my ear playing so loud I can hardly hear  
It's tellin' a story about a boy like you  
And each selection that I make tells me how my heart will break  
For fallin' in love with a boy like you  
Though it's just an old machine without a heart but oh so mean  
It says I probably spend my whole life feelin' blue  
So I'll put in one more dime and play that same song one more time  
Cause I wanna hear about a boy like you  
[ piano ]  
Though it's just an old machine without a heart but oh so mean  
It says I probably spend my whole life feelin' blue  
I know that I should go on home but I can't stand to be alone  
Cause I always dream about a boy like you  
Yes I always dream about a boy like you
