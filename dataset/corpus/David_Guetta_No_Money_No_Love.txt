Born in this world  
I say it's No Money No Love  
No Money No Love  
Yeah yeah yeah  
In case you will no hear it again  
It's No Money No Love  
No Money No Love  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
It's sure you love me now as the world is in my fever  
Watch me while I disappear  
No Money No Love  
  
(Yeah yeah yeah)  
  
I get my heart scarred  
From all my sins  
Was payback to never feel all again  
Do you see the scars bruising my skin  
Oh I wish I could erase them and start all over again  
Maybe I should get down on my knees and I'll still be forgiven  
For what I've done  
  
Born in this world  
I say it's No Money No Love  
No Money No Love  
Yeah yeah yeah  
In case you will no hear it again  
It's No Money No Love  
No Money No Love  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
It's sure you love me now as the world is in my fever  
Watch me while I disappear  
No Money No Love  
  
(Yeah yeah yeah)  
  
Vodoo I call when the world is closing in  
Is it too late for me to be death  
I give my last to be loved again  
I cross my arms and clap for night  
Can you say this dealer, have some mercy  
  
Maybe I should get down on my knees and I'll still be forgiven  
For what I've done  
  
Born in this world  
I say it's No Money No Love  
No Money No Love  
Yeah yeah yeah  
In case you will no hear it again  
It's No Money No Love  
No Money No Love  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
It's sure you love me now as the world is in my fever  
Watch me while I disappear  
No Money No Love...
