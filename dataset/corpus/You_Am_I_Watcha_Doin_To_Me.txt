You drive me to drink  
But I'm in for the whole trip I promise  
You won't go out with the drunk on the road  
Or use yer fork to search for the toast  
Girl I ain't easy  
And any ass could see  
But I can't believe  
Just watcha doin' to me  
I'm falling this way and I  
I'm stumbling over there but I  
Can't believe watcha doin' to me  
The sweetest sound yeah  
To knock this lightweight down but I  
I can't believe watcha doin to me  
Shake my trunk  
And I wake like from a three day drunk  
As my branches hit the ground  
I'm finally comin around  
Bury me deep in my  
Oh my wedding shoes  
Lay me flash  
Just fifty bucks cash it's the  
One day I never wanna lose  
I'm falling this way and I  
I'm stumbling over there but I  
Can't believe watcha doin' to me  
The sweetest sound yeah  
To knock this lightweight down but I  
I can't believe watcha doin to me  
I'm falling this way and I  
I'm stumbling over there but I  
Can't believe watcha doin' to me  
The sweetest sound yeah  
To knock this lightweight down but I  
I can't believe watcha doin to me  
I never felt so jealous or felt so alive  
I feel like I could run  
I feel like I could die  
I can't believe watcha doin' to me  
I can't believe watcha doin' to me
