English Translation:  
While worrying about the illusion  
Reflected in the mirror,  
Everything speeds up without notice  
When they say I'm free to go wherever,  
The guides for my incomplete desire  
All turn grey.  
The swaying flames  
Are painting my dreams tonight  
The tip of your brush  
Isn't dried up yet?  
If you can't see a blue sky, open up your blue umbrella.  
Isn't that great? The canvas is yours.  
A white flag is only raised when one has given up.  
But now let it be crimson  
Like the beckoning matador.  
Under the discoloring fluorescent light  
On the black and white of a chessboard  
We met by chance  
There was a time when we'd lost our way and held each other close  
It's been a month since then. Do you remember?  
I would have been happy just to have watched  
The orange sunset next to you.  
But the mouth (words) is the origin of catastrophe  
Black clothes are only worn when  
Praying for the deceased.  
The mark of rouge leaves behind deep red purposely.  
If you say you can only paint  
Dreamless pictures  
How many times must  
I paint over the canvas?  
A white flag is only raised  
When you've given up  
I'm a color you don't know now.
