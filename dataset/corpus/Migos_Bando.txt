Trap, trapping out the house with the boards on the windows  
  
Trapped out the bando, got tools like Rambo  
Got bird like Birdman, got white like Lindsay Lohan  
Made a hundred stacks off the pots and pans  
On the corner serving grams  
My niggas be on the block hard  
My niggas be serving that hard  
Got bricks like Shaq, at the free throw  
You can call my phone, got them prices for the L-O  
Don't knock at my door, I don't wanna talk to you  
Got them bricks for the l-o, I will serve you  
In the bando, boarded up  
Got them bricks in the wall and in the floor  
Pizzeria way I'm playin' with the dough  
If the feds wanna talk, I just tell them I don't know  
Fuck twelve!

Trapping in the vacant, serving all my patients  
Get it from the Haitians, smoking loud my eye look Asian  
Getting to the money, running to it, tryna chase it  
Like it when she make it, cook it when she naked  
Throw it in the microwave, Betty Crocker how I bake it  
Trapping in the bando, big guns like commando  
Flip it like a sandal, foreign bitch she look like J.Lo  
Get a brick from Venezuelo, meet the plug his name is Pedro

Certified packs nigga you can check the serial  
Foreign bad bitch and she say her name Trina  
Traphouse look like it got hit by hurricane Katrina  
These pounds bought a beamer, everything I do illegal  
The bitches always wanna mingle  
I'm stacking my money like pringles  
Sipping on sprite and codeine, my foreign bitch Philippine  
Her girlfriend Chinese, sipping on lean and popping a bean  
Diamonds come from Africa  
Sipping on lean and smoking loud  
Feel like I'm on salvia  
Flipping the work with no spatula
