Better face the facts, ol' buddy,  
And be prepared to take the blow.  
You don't have to sit and study,  
It's something anyone should know.  
Shake hands... get your hat...  
And go.  
  
You can praise her eyes,  
And adore her hair.  
But if love ain't there,  
It ain't there.  
  
And you can walk her home  
In the warm spring air,  
But if love ain't there,  
It ain't there.  
  
And you can look  
With a longing in your look,  
And try every method in the book  
And worship the smile that kind of  
Took you unaware.  
  
And you can weep and sigh,  
You can say, "unfair".  
You can almost die of despair.  
But if love ain't there,  
It ain't there.
