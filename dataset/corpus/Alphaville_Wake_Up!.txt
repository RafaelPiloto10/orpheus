I saw you smile, i saw you true, i saw you through  
Today you're in your best disguise  
Where are you now musician, lost your speech, where are you now  
You dragon tamer, tell me please, where are your heroes now  
  
Wake up, you forsaken heaven's sheep, your heaven's cheap  
Wake up, open your eyes, feel the might of the light, i know you've got a sun
inside  
I saw you turn, i saw you burn today, your flickering, empty eyes hurt me like
pins  
Are you still in, tell me...  
  
Where are you now, magician, lost your wand, where are the dreams  
That you have dreamt....when you were a hero  
Where are you now, where have you gone, you're much too beautuful  
To slip into oblivion  
  
Wake up, you forsaken heaven's sheep, your heaven's cheap  
Wake up, open your eyes, feel the might of the light, i know you've got a sun
inside  
I saw you turn, i saw you burn today, your flickering, empty eyes hurt me like
pins  
Are you still in, tell me...  
  
I know you've got a sun inside, i know you've got a sun inside...  
I know you've got a sun  
I know you've got a sun  
Inside
