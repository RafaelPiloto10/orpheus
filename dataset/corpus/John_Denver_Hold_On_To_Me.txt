We were live on arrival  
Safe home at last  
No cannon fire dockside  
No flags half-mast  
  
We were sold out for silver  
And a string of black pearls  
On the loneliest island  
At the edge of the world  
  
Like destiny's children  
Souls lost at sea  
No room on the lifeboat  
You can hold on to me  
  
Now the voyage is over  
We're back on dry land  
In our eyes are the stories  
The rope and the brand  
  
Like destiny's children  
Souls lost at sea  
No room on the lifeboat  
You can hold on to me
