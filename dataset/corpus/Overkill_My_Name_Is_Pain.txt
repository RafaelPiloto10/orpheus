No livin', no livin' without me  
No higher, no higher than love, I'm gonna love you  
Right here where you stand  
I'll be inside you, all about you, everywhere you go  
Everywhere you go  
Make you feel like you are livin', what you need to know  
Let me introduce myself, you're gonna know me well  
  
There is no shame, to know my name  
My name is pain, my name is pain  
There is no blame, you know my name  
My name is pain, my name is pain  
All givin', all takin' what I need  
For better, for better or worse, I'm gonna kill you  
Right here where you stand  
I'm wrapped around you, gonna pound you  
Welcome to my show Make you think it's all unfair, here's what you need to  
know  
Let me introduce myself, you're gonna know me well  
  
When I take aim, you know my name  
My name is pain, my name is pain  
I am the flame, you know my name  
My name is pain, my name is pain
