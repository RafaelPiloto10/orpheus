Somebody better call a doctor, doctor  
Or wake me up with a shove  
I'm gonna knock you off your rocker, rocker  
'Cause I think I'm in love  
I tried to get a message to ya  
But you walked the other way  
I need your magic touch, don't you know  
I've got a habit and I can't let go  
Feel the fire burnin' slow  
You better get it while it's hot now babe  
'Cause I can't let go  
Don't need no wedding with a shotgun, shotgun  
So don't you push me too far  
Don't try to take me for a fool child, who child  
Do you think that you are  
You really got it coming to ya  
It's gonna come as no surprise  
I need your magic touch, don't you know  
I'm after you and now I can't let go  
Take it easy, take it slow  
You better get it while it's hot now babe  
'Cause I can't let go  
You never know what you got  
Till they take it away  
I'm comin' ready or not  
Gonna get you some day  
I need your magic touch, don't you know  
I'm after you and now I can't let go  
Feel the fire, burnin' slow  
I got a habit and I'm back for more  
Your magic touch, don't you know  
I'm after you and now I can't let go  
Feel the fire, burnin' slow  
You better get it while it's hot now babe  
'Cause I can't, can't, can't let you go
