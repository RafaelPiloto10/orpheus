There'll be birds singin' everywhere,  
And the wind will be blowin' through your hair.  
I'll look in your eyes  
And wait for the prize  
Your lips kissing mine  
With a love that is real.  
And you'll look so young and fair  
  
On the day we fall in love!  
You and me  
On the day we fall in love.  
You'll see!  
  
There'll be rainbows reachin' cross the sky  
And we'll both be so happy we will cry.  
We'll walk hand in hand  
In snow or in sand  
Whether roses are blooming  
Or snowmen stand by.  
Time will stop, for you and I  
  
On the day we fall in love!  
It will be on the day we fall in love.  
You'll see!  
  
And if the lines that I say fall apart,  
It's because I won't know where to start.  
But you'll understand when I say them to you,  
'Cause they'll come straight from my heart.  
  
On the day we fall in love,  
You and me,  
On the day we fall in love,  
You'll see,  
You'll see.
