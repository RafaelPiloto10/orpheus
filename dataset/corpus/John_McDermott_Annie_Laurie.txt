Maxwellton braes are bonnies where early fa's the dew  
And it's there that Annie Laurie gied me her promise true  
Gied me her promise true which n'er forgot shall be  
And for bonnie Annie Laurie I'd lay me down an' dee  
Her brow is like the snawdrift ner neck is like the swan  
Her face is the fairest that e'er the sun shone on  
That e'er e'er the sun shone on and dark blue is her e'e  
And for bonnie Annie Laurie I'd lay me down and dee  
Like dew on the gowan lyin' is the fa' of her fairy feet  
And like winds in summer sighin' her voice is low and sweet  
Her voice is low and sweet and she's a' the worls tae me  
And for bonnie Annie Laurie I'd lay me down and dee  
And for bonnie Annie Laurie I'd lay me down and dee
