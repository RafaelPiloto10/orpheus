Everyday I get up  
And drag myself out of bed  
While you're still sleeping  
On your tummy  
With your long legs spread  
Call me a copy cat  
Dressed  
Kiss you good-bye  
I'm like a lion in winter  
I don't want to say good-bye  
I'm trying to pull  
On my socks  
You get me horny and hot, darling  
That's why I'm late on the job  
  
You're delicious  
You're delicious, babe  
You're delicious  
  
Just keep on doing  
What you are doing  
Doing  
Doing to me  
Ah, yeah  
  
You're like a cold beer, darling  
On a long-hot summer's day  
Yes, you are  
You're the words I'm planning  
Five part Chekov play  
You make a rich man poor  
And make a blind man see again  
You're ......  
As hard as diesel train  
And while I'm driving to work  
You spill all over my shirt  
You're just a wonderful flirt  
  
You're delicious  
You're delicious, babe  
You're delicious  
  
"The Old man" line ain't gonna  
Take you from my side  
  
I've had the new caviar  
Fort Wall and pink champagne  
I've seen the Mona Lisa  
Drank the wine in France and Spain  
I've smelled the rose of Finnland  
Tulips of Amsterdam  
I've heard the crew line coal train  
The bells of Notre dame  
But you know what honey  
You fill me up  
With desire  
You've set my soul aflying  
Lifted me down to the wire  
  
You're delicious  
You're delicious, babe  
You're delicious  
  
Gimme one time  
You're delicious  
You're delicious, babe  
You're delicious  
Please, bass guitar  
You're delicious  
You're delicious, babe  
You're delicious
