Last time I saw her it was turnin' colder  
But that was years ago  
Last I heard she had moved to Boulder  
But where she's now I don't know  
But there's somethin' 'bout this time of year  
That spins my head around  
Takes me back makes me wonder  
What she's doin now  
  
'Cause what she's doin now is tearin' me apart  
Fillin' up my mind and emptyin' my heart  
I can hear her call each time the cold wind blows  
And I wonder if she knows what she's doin' now  
  
Just for laughs I dialed her old number  
But no one knew her name  
Hung up the phone sat there and wondered  
If she'd ever done the same  
I took a walk in the evenin' wind  
To clear my head somehow  
But tonight I lie here thinkin'  
What she doin' now  
  
'Cause what she's doin now is tearin' me apart  
Fillin' up my mind and emptying my heart  
I can hear her call each time the cold wind blows  
And I wonder if she knows  
  
What she's doin now is tearin' me apart  
Fillin' up my mind and emptying my heart  
I can hear her call each time the cold wind blows  
And I wonder if she knows what she's doin' now
