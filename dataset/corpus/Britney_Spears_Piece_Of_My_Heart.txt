I just cannot go on like this  
I don't want it to last forever  
Got a feeling from your sweet kiss  
I don? T want us to stay together  
  
And you think  
I need you  
But you got it wrong babe  
And I know  
You want me  
To stay here forever  
(But you? Re so wrong)  
  
You took a piece of my heart  
You took a piece of me, to keep me safe  
You took a piece of my heart  
Now I want it back  
So give it back to me  
  
Now you just have to let me go  
Give me back what belongs to me now  
Cause I just have to let you know  
It? S all over for us now baby  
  
But I know  
You want me  
To stay here forever  
And you think I need you  
But you got it wrong babe  
(Oh, so wrong)  
  
You took a piece of my heart...
