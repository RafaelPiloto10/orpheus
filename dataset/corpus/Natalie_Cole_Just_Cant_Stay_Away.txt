Here I am baby, right back in your arms, yeah  
What is it 'bout your love that draws me to you  
And though this is not the first time I've ever wanted to get away, no  
Oh, but the magic of your love just would not let me stray  
So I find that I just can't stay away from you, baby, (from you) ooh, yeah  
You see, I just can't stay away from you  
Let me tell you I've been through a lot of changes  
You see, my Momma scorned me and my closest friends  
Oh Lord, you know they warned me  
They said you're no good for me, but I just ignored it  
  
Yes I did, 'cause I didn't have time, no time to sit around and decide what to
do  
You know, when someone controls your mind  
There's not much you can do  
So you see that's why I (just can't) just can't stay away (stay away)  
Oh, oh (from you) from you, oh Baby  
Hold me Darling, hold (just can't) me Darling, I can't stay away from (stay
away) you  
I don't want to (from you) from you  
I've tried and I've tried, and I've tried, I've tried and I've tried, and I've
tried, Baby  
(When you come close to me, yeah)  
  
I remember, I can remember somebody said it  
They said it many, many, many (when you come close to me, yeah) years ago  
That when love gets in your blood, you'll find it's hard to let go  
And oh, I (just can't) Baby, I (stay away)  
Can't (from you) you see it in my eyes  
Cause I'm wanting you, needing you, ho  
Baby, I (just can't) I don't want to (stay away)  
  
Stay away (from you) from you  
From you, you, you, you, you  
It's not in my power to leave you  
You control the soul in me and I  
(Just can't) That's exactly why I (stay away)  
  
Can't stay away (from you) from you  
Oh 'cause I'm wanting you, needing you, loving you  
Baby, I'm down on my knees, (I just can't) hold me Darling  
I'm (Stay away) begging you please, hold me, Darling  
(From you) 'Cause I just can't stay from you, baby, no, no
