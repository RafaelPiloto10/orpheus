Without you, yeah  
Come on  
  
It took a long time  
But I'm back again for good  
It really hurt me  
But now I finally understood  
The day I left you  
Must be the greatest in my life  
I hear without you  
There's only peace around, no fight  
I tried so hard to  
Oh doing everything I could  
Manipulated  
Made to think I was no good  
In your possession  
Every day was a bad dream  
So naive then  
Well I was young and sixteen  
  
Oh  
He was my honey  
He was my honey  
Happy without no honey  
  
Oh  
He was my honey  
He was my honey  
Happy without you honey  
  
Funny how things change, yeah?  
Yesterday would all be a lie  
I told you  
Now it's all good  
  
I'm feeling down  
It took a time  
It took a time for me to heal for what  
I thought was love  
But I was wrong  
Blinded by your flashy love  
When I was weak  
And you were there  
Well it was obvious you did not care  
About the one  
No you don't bother  
Well I'm happy without you, honey  
  
Oh yeah they told me  
You should be careful what you do  
They only use you  
For his pleasures and absurd  
The love I gave you  
It was the last that you deserved  
Call us a nice time  
To own somebody, that's absurd  
  
Oh  
He was my honey  
He was my honey  
Happy without no honey (Happy without you honey)  
  
Oh  
He was my honey  
He was my honey  
Happy without you honey (Oh oh oh, Happy without you)  
  
Oh  
He was my honey  
He was my honey  
Happy without no honey  
  
Happy without you  
I'm happy without you  
I'm happy without you, boy
