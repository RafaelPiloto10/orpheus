I've got a new car, an' it drives just like a dream.  
I've got money, an' can buy most anything.  
I've got places to go an' things to do.  
I've got everything, everything but you.  
  
I've got a date book that's just bulging at the seams.  
I've got the numbers of all the local queens.  
They give me memories that last a day or two.  
I've got everything, everything but you.  
  
But this new car I drive don't mean anything,  
Which reminds me: there's a payment overdue.  
An' they say that I'm a man who's got everything.  
Yeah, I've got everything, everything but you.
