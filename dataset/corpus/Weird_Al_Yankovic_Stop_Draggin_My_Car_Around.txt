Had to park my car for just five minutes.  
I had to go inside to use the phone.  
When I came back again, my car was gone. Well,  
I didn't know it was a loading zone.  
What a bummer, I is so brought down.  
I had to chase that tow truck a over town, yellin'  
  
Stop draggin' my  
Stop draggin' my  
Stop draggin' my car around.  
  
Took my baby to the local disco.  
I was jumpin' like a maniac.  
But the owner came and pulled me off the floor. Then  
He took me to his little office in the back.  
He said, "I really like your snaggletooth necklace.  
Your pants are groovy, and your hair's okay.  
But, man, that car of yours is so uncool.  
Like wow, I'm sorry, but we towed it away!"  
  
Stop draggin' my  
Stop draggin' my  
Stop draggin' my car around!  
  
Now I'm at home. I'm watchin' "Gilligan's Island."  
Guess it's time to trade my old car in.  
For twenty dollars and my '64 Plymouth,  
Maybe I could get a second-hand Schwinn.  
Look out the window, there's a  
Tow truck in the driveway.  
I grabbed the driver and I asked him why.  
He said, "I'm sorry, kid, you're late with the payments.  
It's time to kiss your little car goodbye."  
  
Stop draggin' my  
Stop draggin' my  
Stop draggin' my car around!  
Stop draggin' my car around!  
  
Listen, the check's in the mail. No, really!  
Stop draggin' my car around!  
Oh man, I just had the hub caps painted!  
Stop draggin' my car around!  
Hey! Hey, I left a sandwich in the back seat!
