One chain to the mountain  
Two feet in the chain  
Three fires approaching  
Four hours away  
  
A sol invictus the invicible sun  
The night is almost come  
  
Five times the assassin  
Six species destroyed  
Seven valleys are numbered  
Eight years till they're gone  
  
Just when I thought  
I'd die on this rock  
I see a face I know  
  
Salvation Jane  
Wild wild flower of love  
Salvation Jane  
You've got the power to change  
You're such an easy prey  
  
Nine times the protector  
Ten years and a day  
Eleventh hour we're facing  
Twelve o'clock in the sun  
  
Oh mother nature  
We're trying to kill you  
Such greedy fools  
  
Salvation Jane  
Wild wild flower of love  
Salvation Jane  
Wild wild flower of love  
You've got the power to change  
  
You're such an easy prey  
Salvation Jane  
Wild wild flower of love  
Salvation Jane  
You've got the power to change  
You're such an easy prey  
  
Thirteen grand designs  
Fourteen you're walking the wire  
Fifteen is when you're lonely  
Sixteen is a long way there  
Seventeen is a whisper  
Eighteen is a whirl  
Nineteen is a mother  
Twenty minutes ago  
  
Salvation Jane  
Wild wild flower of love  
Salvation Jane  
Wild wild flower of love  
Salvation Jane  
You've got the power of love  
Salvation Jane  
You've got the power to change  
You're such an easy prey  
Salvation  
Salvation  
Salvation
