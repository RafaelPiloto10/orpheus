In the eyes of the world he's only an ordinary man  
But there's a million and one things the eyes of the world never see  
He may walk the same  
He may talk the same  
As a million others do  
Oh but you'd see him as I do if his heart had eyes for you  
  
[Chorus: Repeat x2]  
He's only everything  
Only everything  
He's as real as the thrill I feel  
When he walks through my dreams  
He's the one I hold  
When my world grows cold  
And needs a touch of spring  
Or a song to sing  
Yes in these eyes of mine  
Lord he's only everything  
  
Yes in these eyes of mine  
Lord he's only everything
