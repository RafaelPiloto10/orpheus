Now just because your pretty, and you think you're mighty wise  
You tell me that you love me, then you roll those big brown eyes  
When I saw you last week, your eyes were turnin' black  
Go find the guy that beat you up - ask him to take you back  
Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me  
I can tell you've been out on a spree  
Well it's plain that you're lyin'  
When you say that you've been cryin'  
Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me  
  
I used to spend my money, to make you look real sweet  
I wanted to be proud of you when we walked down the street  
Now don't ask me to dress you up, in satin and in silk  
Your eyes look like two cherries in a glass of bottled milk  
  
Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me  
I can tell you've been out on a spree  
Well it's plain that you're lyin'  
When you say that you've been cryin'  
Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me  
  
So I guess our little romance has finally simmered down  
You should join the circus, you make a real good clown  
Your eyes look like a roadmap, I'm scared to smell your breath  
You better shut your peepers before you bleed to death  
  
Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me  
I can tell you've been out on a spree  
Well it's plain that you're lyin'  
When you say that you've been cryin'  
Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me  
  
Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me
