That's what you get for lovin' me  
That's what you get for lovin' me  
Ev'ry thing you had is gone  
As you can see  
That's what you get for lovin' me  
  
I ain't the kind to hang around  
With any new love that I found  
'Cause movin' is my stock in trade  
I'm movin' on  
I won't think of you when I'm gone.  
  
So don't you shed a tear for me  
Because I ain't the love you thought I'd be  
I got a hundred more like you  
So don't be blue  
I'll have a thousand 'fore I'm through  
  
Now there you go you're cryin' again  
Now there you go you're cryin' again  
But then someday when your poor heart  
Is on the mend  
Well I just might pass this way again  
  
That's what you get for lovin' me  
That's what you get for lovin' me  
Everything you had is gone  
As you can see  
That's what you get for lovin' me  
That's what you get for lovin' me
