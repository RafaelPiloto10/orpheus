It used to rain  
Dreary and grey  
Most every day but not any more  
We come out of our homes  
We lie down  
Under the cloud that never comes  
  
We roll in the radiation  
And we make love  
Under the sun  
Under the sun  
  
The polar ice is melting  
'Suits me fine  
We go to the beach  
On the Northern Line  
  
We watch the sea  
Comin' up the street  
Under the sun  
Under the sun  
  
It used to rain  
Dreary and grey  
Most every day but not any more  
We take off our clothes  
And have some fun  
Under the sun  
Under the sun
