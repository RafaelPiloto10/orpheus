Why should i feel discouraged  
Why should the shadows come  
Why should my heart feel lonely  
And long for heaven and home?  
  
When jesus is my portion  
My constant friend is he  
His eye is on the sparrow  
I know he watches me  
His eye is on the sparrow  
I know he watches me  
  
I sing because I'm happy  
I sing because I'm free  
His eye is on the sparrow  
I know he watches me  
His eye, his eye is on the sparrow  
I know he watches  
I know he watches  
I know he watches me  
  
I sing because i'm happy  
I sing because i'm free  
His eye is on the sparrow  
I know, i know, i know he watches over  
He watches over me
