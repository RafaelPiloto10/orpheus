Talk  
Talk is cheap, puts me into sleep  
If there's too much talk  
Talk is cheap  
  
Speed... 1, 2, 3 will bring it back right to its knees  
  
Onto its knees  
  
And I, run away from this  
  
You're running out  
You run away from me  
  
And I  
I never wanted much  
I wanted trust oh oh  
  
And I cant...  
  
And I, I never asked for more  
  
I wanted to believe it - oh  
  
And I can't, and I can't...  
  
Speed  
When I see you, I see your soul  
I dig you a hole  
When I see you  
  
You breathe  
Bring it back we'll see you knock right to its knees - oh  
Onto its knees  
  
Oh I, run away from this  
  
You run it down  
You run away from me  
  
And I  
I never wanted much  
I only wanted trust oh oh  
And I  
And I  
I never asked for more  
I wanted to believe in, oh  
And I, and I  
Oh  
  
Well there must be something more to say  
And I feel you slip away  
But I forget your hands are vacant inside  
I see you once again  
But it's 1, 2, 3 you'll follow me  
I know you'll have to wait  
But I see yourself  
I see you break  
I see you laughing every single day  
And its true  
  
Well it's happening to me  
I never wanted much  
I only wanted trust oh oh  
And I  
And I  
I never asked for more  
I wanted to believe you  
And I  
But I can't  
And I, and I  
Can't
