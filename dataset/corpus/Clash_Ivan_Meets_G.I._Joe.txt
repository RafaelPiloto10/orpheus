So you're on the floor, at Fifty Four  
Think you can last - at the Palace  
Does your body go to the to and fro?  
But tonight's the night - or didn't you know  
That Ivan meets G.I. Joe  
  
He tried his tricks- that Ruskie bear  
The United Nations said it's all fair  
He did the radiation - the chemical plague  
But he could not win - with a Cossack spin  
  
The Vostok Bomb - the Stalin strike  
He tried every move - he tried to hitch hike  
He drilled a hole - like a Russian star  
He made every move in his repertoire  
  
When Ivan meet G.I. Joe  
  
Now it was G.I. Joe's turn to blow  
He turned it on - cool and slow  
He tried a payphone call to the Pentagon  
A radar scan - a leviathan  
  
He wiped the Earth - clean as a plate  
What does it take to make a Ruskie break?  
But the crowd are bored and off they go  
Over the road to watch China blow!  
  
When Ivan meets G.I. Joe
