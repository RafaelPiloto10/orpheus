Lost On The River, Dark Is The Night  
Just Like The Blind, Praying For Site  
Drifting Alone, Heart Filled With Fright  
I'm lost On The River The River Of Life  
Once Dear I Thought I Knew The Way  
That Was Before Old Sad Yesterday  
Words That You Said Cut Like A Knife  
I'm Lost On The River The River Of Life  
Out On This River Where Sorrow's Free  
Thinking Of You How My Heart Pleads  
Tomorrow You'll Be Another Man's Wife  
I'm Lost On The River The River Of Life
