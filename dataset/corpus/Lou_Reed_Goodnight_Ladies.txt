Goodnight ladies, ladies goodnight  
It's time to say goodbye  
Let me tell you, now, goodnight ladies, ladies goodnight  
It's time to say goodbye  
  
Ah, all night long you've been drinking your tequilla rye  
But now you've sucked your lemon peel dry  
So why not get high, high, high and  
Goodnight ladies, ladies goodnight  
  
Goodnight ladies, ladies goodnight  
It's time to say goodbye  
Goodnight sweet ladies, all ladies goodnight  
It's time to say goodbye, bye-bye  
  
Ah, we've been together for the longest time  
But now it's time to get high  
Come on, let's get high, high, high  
And goodnight ladies, ladies goodnight  
  
Oh, I'm still missing my other half  
Oh, it must be something I did in the past  
Don't it just make you wanna laugh  
It's a lonely Saturday night  
Oh, nobody calls me on the telephone  
I put another record on my stereo  
But I'm still singing a song of you  
It's a lonely Saturday night  
  
Now, if I was an actor or a dancer that was glamorous  
Then, you know, an amorous life would soon be mine  
But now the tinsel light of star break  
Is all that's left to applaud my heart break  
And eleven o'clock I watch the network news  
  
Oh, oh, oh, something tells me that you're really gone  
You said we could be friends, but that's not what's not what I want  
And, anyway, my TV-dinner's almost done  
It's a lonely Saturday night  
I mean to tell you, it's a lonely Saturday night  
One more word, it's a lonely Saturday night
