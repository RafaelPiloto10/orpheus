Y'all ready?  
Well, well  
Can I get a witness  
I wanna talk about something tonight, ooh  
  
Everybody wants somebody  
You can't show me a woman that don't want nobody  
Everybody needs somebody  
And that's alright, ah  
But tonight you out there looking for somebody  
But you'll never find nobody  
That will believe in  
And love you like me baby  
And treat you the way you wanna be treated  
  
Mistakes, oh I made a few baby  
Oh, but I'm not perfect, woman  
Neither are you, babe  
You'll never find nobody, hey  
To give you all the stuff you need  
You know what that stuff is, babe  
And Lord, and make love, ah  
Just the way you like it girl  
I give you head, oh but don't be mislead, babe  
Oh, you need to remember what I taught you in bed  
I showed you baby  
Oh now you got me down on my knees baby, begging  
  
I know your friends don't like me  
But they ain't about nothing  
They ain't got nothing  
They always trying to stab and start something  
But before you leave  
You need to think about it baby  
You know you doing it wrong baby  
Oh and you about to see that babe  
We come too far, we come too far to turn around baby  
Oh I put too much in you little girl  
Hey ,oh yeah  
  
I know everybody wants somebody  
That makes sense  
Everybody needs somebody  
And that's alright too  
Oh but girl, tonight you out there looking for somebody  
That ain't no good  
You'll never find nobody  
That love you like me baby  
And treat you, treat you, treat you  
The way a woman needs to be treated  
Oh don't let your friends  
Don't let your friends ruin your home baby  
They ain't got nothing  
They ain't got nothing  
They send it home, send it home all alone  
But before you leave, oh think  
Whoa, use your head girl  
Oh you need to think baby  
Call your lover's  
Call 'em off baby  
They like dogs  
Greedy like hogs  
Yeah, yeah  
Oh, you better think
