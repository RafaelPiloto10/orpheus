He sat down, picked up the phone  
And said, "Boy, I'm your old man"  
He touched the glass between the two  
As if to shake his hand  
  
The boy, he didn't budge  
Not even so much as a blink  
The man said, "Oh, come on  
Better late than never, don't you think?"  
  
He said, "I read it in the paper  
Can't believe you're 21  
Can't believe some son of mine  
Could do the things I hear you've done"  
  
He went on like some big hero  
Who flew in to save the day  
And the boy said, "If you're here  
To steer me right, man, it's too late"  
  
"You had to be there  
And I'm talkin' from day one  
That's the only time a man should talk  
Through glass to his new son"  
  
"And you'd have to go back  
And teach me how when I was nine  
'Cause my mama couldn't throw a ball  
Even if she had the time"  
  
"And I should have been learnin' how to fish  
Instead of learnin' how to smoke  
I bet if you'd have whooped my tail  
I'd never thought it was a joke"  
  
He said, "Sometimes the will  
For doin' wrong is way too strong  
For any Mama's prayers  
You had to be there"  
  
The man said, "Boy, I'm sorry  
That you hate me like you do"  
The boy said, "Dry it up, man  
We ain't makin' this about you"  
  
"It's about a teenage girl against the world  
Who was left there high and dry  
About a kid who might have stood  
A whole lot better shot at life"  
  
"But you had to be there  
And I'm talkin' from day one  
That's the only time a man should talk  
Through glass to his new son"  
  
"You'd have to go back  
And teach me how when I was nine  
'Cause my mama couldn't throw a ball  
Even if she had the time"  
  
"I should have been learnin' how to fish  
Instead of learnin' how to smoke  
I bet if you'd have whooped my tail  
I'd never thought it was a joke"  
  
He said, "Sometimes the will  
For doing wrong is way too strong  
For any Mama's prayer  
You had to be there"  
  
Before the boy hung up the phone  
He said, "They say I'm out of time"  
And it hit the man right there and then  
"My God, son, so am I"
