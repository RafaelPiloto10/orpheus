With my eyes wide open, I'm dreaming  
Can it be true, I'm holding you close to my heart?  
With my eyes wide open, I'm dreaming  
You're with me now, sharing a vow never to part  
  
When I'm so afraid  
To close my eyes  
Afraid that I'll find  
This lovely thrill is just a silly illusion  
  
With my eyes wide open, I'm dreaming  
Do I deserve such a break?  
Pinch me to prove I'm awake  
'Cause I can't believe that you're really mine  
  
I'm so afraid  
This is just an illusion  
  
With my eyes wide open, I'm dreaming  
Do I deserve such a break?  
Please, pinch me to prove I'm awake  
I can't believe that you're really mine  
  
You're really mine  
Am I dreaming? I must be dreaming  
With my eyes wide open  
Eyes wide open
