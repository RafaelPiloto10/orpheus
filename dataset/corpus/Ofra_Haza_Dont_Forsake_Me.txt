Sar hamamunah, sar hamamunah  
Ginat agoz gum patah nah  
Ginat agoz gum patah nah  
Likrat yadidi umaherah  
  
Don't cast me away  
When I start to fade  
When my mind's unmade  
Don't forsake me  
When my strength has ebbed  
Don't forsake me.  
  
I know the day will come,  
I know the day will come  
And all my life will be haze and spark  
Don't ever leave me in the dark.  
  
Don't cast me away  
When I start to fade  
When my mind's unmade  
Don't forsake me  
When my strength has ebbed  
Don't forsake me.  
Oh, Oh, Oh,  
Don't cast me away
