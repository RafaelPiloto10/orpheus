Every time I see my baby home,  
I want to kiss a little better so I get stoned.  
Gonna spread her pretty legs so I can see,  
Sweet lip honey be the death of me  
And I will discover you'll be my midnight lover,  
Oh babe, bring it on home to me.  
  
Sometimes when I'm feeling low,  
I go looking for a lover where the bad girls go.  
Sorry little girl, If you can't stay,  
Your red light mama gonna show the way.  
  
And then a certain madness,  
Will 'crease my heart with sadness  
Oh babe, bring it on home to me.  
Take me with you I will give you anything a woman needs,  
Take me with you I will give you anything a woman needs.  
  
I know love and what it means,  
It's a skinny little girl in tight ass jeans.  
I love to hear'em moan and cry,  
'cause God made men to satisfy.  
And with the fire returning,  
I feel the fever burning  
Oh babe, bring it on home to me.  
  
Take me with you I will give you anything a woman needs,  
Take me with you I will give you anything a woman needs.  
Oh, take me with you.  
  
Every time I see my baby home,  
I want to kiss a little better so I get stoned.  
Gonna spread her pretty legs so I can see,  
Sweet lip honey be the death of me.  
And I will discover you'll be my midnight lover,  
Oh babe, bring it on home to me.  
  
Take me with you I will give you anything a woman needs,  
Take me with you I will give you anything a woman needs.  
Take me with you.
