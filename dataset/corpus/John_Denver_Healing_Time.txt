Let the mountains talk  
Let the rivers run  
There is wisdom here  
There is much to learn  
There is much to know  
Much to understand  
In this healing time  
All across the land  
  
You have heard my songs  
Oh so many years  
You have laughed with me  
Washed away my tears  
You have shared my joy  
You have felt my pain  
In this healing time  
Walk with me again  
  
Through these darker days  
On this narrow line  
Help me find my way  
Help me see the signs  
I am not afraid  
I am not alone  
You have taught me well  
You have brought me home  
  
Let the mountains speak  
Let the rivers run  
As the world awakes  
To the rising sun  
In each brand new day  
In our own rebirth  
In this healing time  
On our mother earth  
  
Let the mountains talk  
And let the rivers run  
There is wisdom here  
There's so much to learn  
In each brand new day  
In our own rebirth  
In this healing time  
For our mother earth  
  
In each brand new day  
In our own rebirth  
In this healing time  
Here on mother earth
