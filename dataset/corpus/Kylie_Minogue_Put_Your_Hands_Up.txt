I look around, I see a million different faces  
But no one's lookin' in my eyes  
It takes a minute when I'm in these different places  
To realize  
All we need is love in this life, it's true  
All I need is the love I get from you  
And I wanna scream it out  
If you hear what I'm sayin'  
Put your hands up  
If you're feelin' love tonight  
If you're feelin' love  
Now put your hands up  
If you're feelin' love tonight  
If you're feelin' love  
No matter what, we're gonna take this moment  
Now come on, baby, you can show me  
So put your hands up  
If you're feelin' love tonight  
If you're feelin' love  
Everybody knows how life can get so twisted  
But I won't let it bring me down  
And there's no point in ever tryin' to resist it  
Just work it out  
All we need is love in this life, it's true  
All I need is the love I get from you  
So put your hands up  
If you're feelin' love tonight  
If you're feelin' love  
Now put your hands up  
If you're feelin' love tonight  
If you're feelin' love  
No matter what, we're gonna take this moment  
Now come on baby you can show me  
So put your hands up  
If you're feelin' love tonight  
If you're feelin' love  
If you're comin' out tonight  
Let me hear it now  
Said if you're comin' out tonight  
Let me hear it  
Now put your hands up  
If you're feelin' love  
Now put your hands up  
If you're feelin' love  
So put your hands up  
If you're feelin' love tonight  
If you're feelin' love  
Now put your hands up  
If you're feelin' love tonight  
If you're feelin' love  
No matter what, we're gonna take this moment  
Now come on, baby, you can show me  
So put your hands up  
If you're feelin' love tonight  
If you're feelin' love
