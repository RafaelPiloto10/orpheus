Hello you  
yes it's me  
You can't come back  
Your flyin' free  
You think you found  
Everything that you need  
  
Fly away, fly away  
To your new home  
Across the seas  
Oh leave your nest  
Oh baby leave the best thing  
That you've been  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
  
Fly on, Thunderbird fly  
Fly on, spread your wings to the sky  
Fly on, Thunderbird fly  
  
On your own  
And I'm alone  
In the shadow  
Of what we done  
And I can't help but think  
That someday  
You'll be back home (whoa)  
  
Fly away, fly away  
To your new home  
Across the bay  
And give your best  
Ooh baby leave the best thing  
That you've been  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
Fly on, Thunderbird fly  
Fly on, spread your wings to the sky  
Fly on, Thunderbird fly (fly on)  
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)  
(Ah, ah, ah, ah ah ah ah)  
  
When all is said  
All is done  
Still I live  
And carry on  
Don't look back  
But think of me  
We'll meet again  
Fly away (oh)  
  
Fly on, Thunderbird fly  
Fly on, spread your wings to the sky  
Fly on, Thunderbird fly  
  
Fly on, Thunderbird fly  
You've got fly away  
Fly on, spread your wings to the sky  
On to the sky  
Fly on Thunderbird...  
Fly!
