[talking:]  
What's up lil' mama, they call me Z-Ro the Crooked  
King of Da Ghetto, know I'm saying  
You wanna be the queen, let me holla at ya  
[Z-Ro:]  
You want a nigga to touch you where it counts, you can call me up I'm on my
way  
Since you serious conversation, I listen to what you have to say  
This ain't gotta be, about a wam-bam thank you ma'am  
I'm not like these other fellas, although I know you think I am  
Even though I kick it, with a lot of females  
I can honestly tell you, that I ain't got a female  
Because I'm fresh out of jail, you prolly think that I just wanna bone  
Hit it quit it, then delete your number from my mobile phone  
Every man, needs a lady  
But I'm not trying to be your husband, only suggesting communication on the
daily  
I'm usually rude, with a bad attitude  
But I'm thinking, you can brighten up my mood  
While you roll up my cigarillos, I bring you breakfast in bed  
I'm even down to ease your scalp, and calm your head  
Just tell me when the laws coming, I ain't trying to end up in the Penn  
Cause I'm digging you, and really feeling you should be my homie lover friend  
[Hook: x2]  
I'd really, like to get to know you better  
Been one deep for a minute, but feel like it been forever  
I can be your friend, when you need me  
Your lover when you feeling freaky, plus your homie cause I'm down with you
for sheezy  
[Z-Ro:]  
Whenever you need to shed tears, let em fall on me  
Don't ever be afraid, to call on me  
This the way your man leave you hanging, he ain't ready for you  
But I ain't ever too busy, to miss some feddy for you  
I know what it be feeling like, to be neglected  
So when you with Ro you running the show, and please know that you're
protected  
I'd be lying, if I said I wasn't trying to bump and grind  
But that ain't all that's on my mind, it would be fine  
To hit the Cinema Six, and catch a flick  
Papa Deauxxx for swamp thangs, fettucini and fish  
Not a trick, but I love shopping for my lady friend  
You could be my one and only, right before the day begin  
I could drop you off at home, or you coming with me  
The early morning sun, is something to see  
Especially aboard a Carnival Cruise ship, you with it then let's get in the
wind  
Now this is how it is, to be my only homie lover friend  
[Hook x2]  
[Z-Ro:]  
Just to lay it on the line, I done cheated befo'  
I feel like there's some information, that you needed to know  
It wasn't about a man, being a man  
But how I'm gon try to give somebody the world, and they shit in my hand  
We can kick it, but I really don't know what's on your agenda  
Are you serious about me, or just another pretender  
If I get the feeling fraud, I'ma stop it 'fore it starts  
Sense from you, and I felt the full effect of a broken heart  
Garunteed, I get you in the bed and it's over with  
I crucify the crucial, with that legs on my shoulder shit  
Hypnotic, is my afrodesiac  
Make me keep on going and going, something like a duracel six pack  
Pardon my pornographics, but please pay attention  
I been behind the gate for eight, I need a mate  
But I'll never disrespect, your legitament to the end  
Even if I never ever get the chance, to be your homie lover friend  
[Hook x2]
