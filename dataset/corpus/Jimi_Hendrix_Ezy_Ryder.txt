There goes ezy, ezy ryder  
Riding down the highway of desire  
He says the free wind takes him higher  
Tryin' to find his heaven above  
But he's dyin' to be loved  
Dyin' to be loved  
He's tellin' me livin' is so magic  
He says a day is forever so he claims  
He's talkin' about dyin' it's so tragic baby  
But don't you worry about it today, we got freedom comin' our way  
Freedom comin' our way  
  
Come on do you  
They key is going to last  
Get more gas  
See all the lovers say do what you please  
Gotta get the brothers together we got to be free  
And got to try to make those guys,  
I think I see me a freak  
Hey, motorcycle mama, you're gonna marry me?  
Haha  
And I'll be stoned, stoned, clear as day  
Love comin' in like crazy  
Stoned crazy  
Stoned crazy baby  
Whoooo!  
  
There goes ezy, ezy ryder  
Riding down the highway of desire  
He says the free wind, takes him higher  
Searchin for his heaven above  
But he's dyin' to be loved  
Dyin' to be loved  
Yeah  
Because ezy ryder baby  
Ezy ryder  
Tryin' to find the highway  
Ezy ryder  
Ezy ryder  
Ezy ryder
