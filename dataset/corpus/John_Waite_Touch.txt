We've seen a lifetime since we met  
Through good and bad  
And things we won't forget  
Forgotten promises and broken vows  
But we always made it through somehow  
But the key to you is broken in the lock  
And a simple band of gold is all we've got  
It's in the things that I can't say  
That tear us both apart  
But if you keep listening  
You'll hear inside my heart of hearts  
Darling, the simple things are hard to say  
And darling the words get in the way  
The poet sees the world through rhymes  
But only says so much  
See darling, the words are in my touch  
The meaning's in my touch  
And maybe there's something I should say  
To make everything that's wrong Ok  
A simple phrase, a sonnet from a play  
But a man can only say so much these days  
And we're drifting to the deep end of the lake  
Trying to make good on our past mistakes  
And I know you're tired  
But heaven's here and now  
I've got no explanation  
Words are worthless to me now  
Darling... etc
