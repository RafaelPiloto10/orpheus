A love struck romeo  
Sings the streets a serenade  
Now he's laying everybody low  
He's got a love song that he made  
He finds a streetlight  
And he steps out of the shade  
And says something like  
"you and me, babe, how about it?"  
  
Juliet says "hey, it's romeo!"  
"you nearly give me a heart attack!"  
Yeah well, he's underneath the window  
Now she's singing "hey-la, my boyfriend's back"  
"you shouldn't come around here  
Singing up at people like that  
Ah anyway, whatcha gonna do about it?"  
  
Juliet  
The dice were loaded from the start  
And I bet and you exploded into my heart  
And I forget, I forget the movie song  
When you gonna realize  
It was just that the time was wrong  
Julie  
  
We both come up on different streets  
And they both were streets of shame  
You know they're both dirty both mean  
Yes and the dreams were the same  
And I dreamed your dream for you  
And now your dream is real  
So tell me honey  
Now how can you look at me  
As if I was just another one of your deals  
  
Now you can fall for chains of silver  
And you can fall for chains of gold  
You know you fall for pretty strangers  
And the promises they hold  
Well you promised me everything  
And then you promised me thick and thin  
Now you just turn away and say  
"romeo, I think I used to have a scene with him."  
  
Ah juliet  
When we made love you used to cry  
You said "I love you like the stars above  
Gonna love you till I die"  
There's a place for us  
I you know this song  
Now when you gonna realize  
It was just that the time was wrong  
Julie  
  
But I can't do the talks like they talk on my tv screen  
I can't do a love song not the way you song them to me  
I can't do everything but I would do anything for you  
Oh no I can't do anything except be in love with you  
  
Yeah now and all I do is miss you  
And the way it used to be you know  
And all I do is keep the beat  
I keep bad, bad company  
And all I do is kiss you  
Through the bars of a rhyme  
When julie I'd do the stars with you  
Anytime  
  
Ah juliet  
When we made love you used to cry  
You said "I love you like the stars above  
I'm gonna love you till I die"  
There's a place for us  
I know you know the movie song  
One day we're gonna realize  
It was just that the time was wrong  
Julie  
Julie  
Julie  
  
Now this love struck romeo  
He sings the streets a serenade  
Now he's laying everybody low  
He's got a love song he made  
He finds a convenient streetlight  
And he'll step out of the shade  
And he'll say something like  
"you and me, babe, how 'bout it?
