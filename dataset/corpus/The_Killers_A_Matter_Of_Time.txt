You're looking for a way out  
I can feel it  
Come on, show me where it hurts  
Maybe I can heal it  
  
Your feelings are your own  
Now you keep 'em under lock and key  
You got me drivin' through the streets  
For an answer to the mystery  
  
The world's still weak on Charleston Avenue  
Outside that vacant Starlight Motel I see you  
Laughing with your girlfriends  
Not a care in the world, not a burden on your mind  
  
It was a matter of time  
  
There's a panic in this house and it's bound to surface  
Just walkin' through the front door makes me nervous  
It's creepin' up the floorboards, got me wondering where I stand  
I cannot put out the fire, I got a book of matches in my hand  
  
When we first met, headstrong and filled with doubt  
Made just enough hustling tables that summer to take you out  
I was fallin' back on forever when you told me about your heart  
You laid it on the line  
  
Laughing with your girlfriends  
Not a care in the world, not a burden on your mind  
(You laid it on the line)  
  
It was just a matter, It was a matter of time  
  
We found ourselves  
We belong in it forever  
Ain't that what it's all about?  
Make the promise and keep it  
Come hell or high water  
We'd figure it out  
  
It was the night, it was the moon  
It was the green grass in the garden  
The victory and the sin  
  
I know you're weary, look at me  
Flailin' in the corner  
Here's the towel  
Go on, throw it in  
  
It was a matter of time  
Can't you see that it's tearing me up inside?  
Look what's laying at our feet  
That's the wreckage of broken dreams  
And burned out hales  
And it's here on our street
