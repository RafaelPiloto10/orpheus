Where are you ? I love you . Where are you ? I love you .  
Where are you to keep me warm?  
  
I had a dream of a place far away.  
I followed a river where the dead man would play.  
And I'm leaving in the morning.  
And I'm leaving in the morning.  
  
And I won't die, so don't cry. I'll be home.  
Those big black diamonds that lie there for me.  
By the tall white mountains which lie by the sea.  
  
And you a man who's as tall as the sky  
Followed a river where thousands have died.  
He was leaving in the morning.  
He was leaving in the morning.  
  
If I come home and my women has flown.  
Those big black diamonds that lie there for me  
By the tall white mountains which lie by the sea  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Say goodbye to auld lang syne [Repeat until fade]
