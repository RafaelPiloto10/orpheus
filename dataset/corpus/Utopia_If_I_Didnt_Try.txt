If I didn't try, how would I know, how would I know  
If I didn't try, how would I know, how would I know  
Sometimes I think I must be crazy for doing this  
(Think I'm never gonna win)  
But how would I know it's a losing cause  
If I didn't try, if I didn't try  
If I didn't try, if I didn't try  
If I didn't care, nothing would hurt, nothing would hurt  
If I didn't care, hope for the best, expect the worst  
Sometimes it feels like my whole life has been leading to this  
(Wish that I could hide somewhere)  
But how would I know how it feels to live  
If I didn't care, if I didn't care  
If I didn't care, if I didn't care  
Sometimes I think I must be crazy for doing this  
(You can never run away)  
But how would I know it's a losing cause  
If I didn't try, if I didn't try  
If I didn't try, if I didn't try
