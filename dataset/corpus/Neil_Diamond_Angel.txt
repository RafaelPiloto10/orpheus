Maybe tonight,  
I will say what's on my mind,  
But the words are, oh, so hard to find.  
  
When I try to speak  
It comes out like nervous chatter,  
Then my knees get weak  
And I can't stop shaking.  
  
I try to relax,  
'Cause I must maintain my cool.  
She knows I'm here.  
If I don't make a move right now,  
She's goin' to disappear.  
  
Angel,  
I never met a girl that looks like you.  
Do, do, do, do you even care?  
  
Angel,  
There's nothing in the world  
That I won't do for you,  
Angel.  
  
I followed you home,  
And imagined me with you.  
Girl, I should have known  
When I tried to dial your number  
I'd hang up the phone.  
Angel, did you answer?  
  
Angel,  
I never met a girl that looks like you.  
Do, do, do, do you even care?  
  
Angel,  
There's nothing in the world that  
I won't do for you,  
Angel,  
  
And every time we meet,  
I feel like I got two left feet.  
And you,  
You know what I'm goin' through.  
  
When I try to speak  
It comes out like nervous chatter,  
Then my knees get weak  
And I can't stop shaking.  
  
Angel,  
I never met a girl that looks like you.  
Do, do, do, do you even care?  
  
Angel,  
There's nothing in the world  
That I won't do for you,  
Angel.  
  
Angel,  
I never met a girl that looks like you.  
Do, do, do, do you even care,  
Angel?
