It's not hard to know when your body is aching  
I'm alone at night and I don't seem to be patient now  
And I don't know the rules to win  
Believe in my dreams (that) I'm gonna have  
But before I even met the other ones that long obsessed  
Have you been lost I'm looking for  
The songs I need before I go  
My house my town 'cause I said so  
And I will go  
It's so unreal and I will love  
The things I feel are not a joke  
It's so unreal and I will love  
The things I feel
