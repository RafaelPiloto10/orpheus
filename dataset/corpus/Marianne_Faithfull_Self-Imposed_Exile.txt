(Marianne Faithfull, Joe Maverty)  
  
Free souls don't live in suburbia (suburbia)  
I was stranded, stranded, I must have been blind  
Self preservation, the only way to attack (attack attack attack attack)  
Chinese numbers tattoed on my back  
  
We were victims of the present time  
Juvenile delinquents, fallen angels  
Played the part without relief  
Broken hearts like leaves on the street  
Self preservation, the only way to attack (attack attack attack attack)  
Chinese numbers tattoed on my back  
  
Well I'm in self-imposed exile  
I'm in self-imposed exile  
I'm in self-imposed exile  
I'm in self-imposed exile  
  
We were searching, searching for a space  
Living for a moment, just a moment  
Take what we wanted, don't seem much  
Time for time to sit and watch  
Self preservation, the only way to attack (attack attack attack attack)  
Chinese numbers tattoed on my back  
  
Well I'm in self-imposed exile  
I'm in self-imposed exile  
I'm in self-imposed exile  
I'm in self-imposed exile  
  
Free souls don't live in suburbia (suburbia)  
I was stranded, stranded, I must have been blind  
  
I'm in self-imposed exile  
I'm in self-imposed exile  
I'm in self-imposed exile  
I'm in self-imposed exile  
  
We were searching, searching for a space  
Living for a moment, just a moment  
We were searching, searching for a space  
Living for a moment, for a moment  
We were searching, searching for a space  
Living for a moment, just a moment  
We were searching, searching for a space  
Living for a moment, for a moment  
We were searching, searching for a space  
Living for a moment, just a moment  
We were searching, searching for a space  
Living for a moment, for a moment...
