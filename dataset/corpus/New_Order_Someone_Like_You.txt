This can't be real  
My heart is burning  
How does it feel ?  
Well, let's say I'm learning  
It had to come  
The ship has landed  
It's time to run  
The crew are stranded  
  
We're having the time of our lives  
We're lost in a cruel paradise  
  
Someone like you could make me feel like I used to do  
Return my heart, yeah  
Make it real like it was at the start  
Someone like you, someone like you, yeah  
  
You're everything to me:  
The sweetest symphony  
All that I try to be  
You are my harmony  
I guess what I mean to say  
Is you keep the wolves at bay  
We're children on holiday  
Here comes the cloud  
  
We're having the time of our lives  
We're lost in a cruel paradise  
  
Someone like you could make me feel like I used to do  
Return my heart, yeah  
Make it real like it was at the start  
Someone like you, yeah, someone like you, yeah
