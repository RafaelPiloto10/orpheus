I've never seen your breath before  
But I'm disgusted by the thought of  
Waiting anymore  
If I look up in your eyes  
Will you notice me or notice it or  
Fade into this accident  
I don't want to find  
The big dumb rocket on your mind  
Its mostly you and mostly me  
And a tired gun that's not empty  
I've never been this sad before  
But I'm disgusted by my fingertips  
And what they've done  
If I look into your eyes  
If it must be true you must believe  
I've never held such violent things  
I've never talked to God before tonight  
But I'm disgusted by
