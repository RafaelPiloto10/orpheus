So far from our system we came here through space  
To leave poisoned spheres for your race  
Our knowledge we trade for the time shared on earth  
To take and give for what it's worth  
  
On, our screens we've been shown your world  
Plead for your welcome, you won't get hurt  
  
Mission motherland  
Another chance  
With sunlit soil and air to breathe  
Is there any place for us to live  
To grow descendants  
To be free  
  
You gave us resources  
You gave us advice  
To deal with the unknown to get humanized  
We've shown you dimensions and brought you on ways  
You've never seen yesterday  
  
Hand in hand we will march through time  
So much more to research and find  
  
Mission motherland  
Another chance  
With sunlit soil and air to breathe  
Is there any place for us to live  
To grow descendants  
To be free  
  
When you hear these words  
We've taken cold refuge  
In freezers to keep us alive  
What we didn't know  
Your central star called sun  
Sends lethal rays to earth  
Say how many of us died  
In the streams of light  
Faceless bodies, morbid cries  
Doomed our colonies  
Wake us when you've healed the world  
Save our souls  
  
When will we be as one again  
And fulfill what we understand as  
  
Mission motherland  
Another chance  
With sunlit soil and air to breathe  
Is there any place for us to live  
To grow descendants  
To be free
