I've been talking to the wall and it's been answering me  
Oh darling how I miss you  
I'm just the mere shadow of my former selfishness  
I crave the silhouette of your kiss  
With only the blue light of the tv on  
Lip reading threats and false alarms  
There's a boy somewhere holding hands with himself  
And a girl in a window on the Reeperbarn  
  
[Chorus:]  
Whenever I put my foot in my mouth and you begin to doubt  
That it's you that I'm dreaming about  
Do I have to draw you a diagram?  
All I ever want is just to fall into your human hands  
  
With the kings and queens of the dance hall craze  
Checkmate in three moves in your heyday  
But the girls don't listen to your line anymore  
Now you're part of someone else  
  
On the factory floor and you still say "Wheres the action?"  
Now you manufacture happiness  
And get sold on the cheap for someone's satisfaction  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
All you toy soldiers and scaremongers  
Are you living in this world sometimes I wonder  
In between saying you've seen too much and saying you've seen it all before  
  
Tighter and tighter I hold you tightly  
You know I love you more than slightly  
Although I've never said it like this before  
  
[Chorus:]
