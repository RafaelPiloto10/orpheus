Tobacco stains our yellow teeth  
And all our fingers and underneath  
Our fingernails, that clasp on sheets  
As we try desperately to sleep  
  
Hearts are sad and eyes are tired  
And all this Red Bull keeps us wired  
Gives us wings  
It gives us rings around our eyes  
  
We put three sugars in our tea  
Sit to watch too much day time TV  
And laugh at mums  
Who don't know who the father is  
  
And all our girlfriends are long gone  
We watch too much internet porn  
Who needs love  
When you've got silicone and strap ons  
  
And beer bloats our spoiled guts  
And shit jobs keep us in ruts  
And keep us eying up  
The what's and ifs and buts and maybes  
  
And falling over in the street  
Is just a part of every week  
And we lie drunkenly  
Just staring at the stars  
  
Remember when they were in reach  
And all the teachers used to teach  
You can do anything  
If you put your mind to it  
  
We put our minds to it all  
But disappointment crashed the ball  
We could have done anything  
But we just never quite knew it  
  
So tie your scarf on tight  
It's to be a cold night  
Tie your scarf on tight  
It's to be a cold night  
  
And tie your scarf on tight  
It's to be a cold night  
And tie your scarf on tight  
It's to be a cold night  
  
Oh oh, so tie your scarf on tight  
It's to be a cold night  
And tie your scarf on tight  
It's to be a cold night
