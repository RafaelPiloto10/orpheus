There is a house down in New Orleans  
They call the Rising Sun  
And it's been the ruin for many a poor boy and me  
Oh God, I'm one  
My mother was a tailor  
She sowed these old blue jeans  
My father was a gambler, Lord  
Down in New Orleans  
The only thing a gambler needs  
Is a suitcase and a trunk  
And the only time he's ever satisfied  
Is when he's on a drunk  
Go tell my baby sister  
Not to do the the things I've done  
Outshine that house down in New Orleans  
That they call the Rising Sun  
There is a house down in New Orleans  
That they call the Rising Sun  
And it's been the ruin for many a poor boy and me  
Oh God, I'm one
