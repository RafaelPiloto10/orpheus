Do you need the walls to spread apart?  
Something's been sent here,  
To free you, I am told.  
A rising power that will break you,  
Break you out you'll see,  
Your fantasy unfold.  
It can be won.  
We will be one.  
So many eyes that never open.  
Too many chains that bind  
The dreams that make us see.  
There are no prisons in our kingdom.  
Will you give your hand?  
Say "yes, Your Majesty!"  
It can be won.  
We will be one.  
Always go on,  
Never saying you are done.  
We're always looking for  
A place where magic passion soars.  
You'll find that if you're with us,  
The magic's in your heart!  
It can be won.  
We will be one.  
Now can you see  
The gift we bring...  
Your Majesty!
