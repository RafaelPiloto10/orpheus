I think I'll take my foolish heart, my friend, and head right for the door.  
There'll be a better world waitin' if I do.  
'Cause I know I've been down this road a time or two before,  
The only time I let my heart turn to you.  
  
Now, I won't be blue with dreams that won't come true.  
I'll take my heart, and head right for the door.  
  
Still somethin' deep inside keeps tellin' me to make the sacrifice,  
And askin' me to walk the extra mile.  
I've walked it now to many times with freedom for the price.  
Too many times to fight back tears behind my smiles.  
  
Now, I won't be blue with dreams that won't come true.  
I'll take my heart, and head right for the door.  
  
I know I must seem quite unkind to wander off tonight  
And leave the moon up above to hold your gaze.  
It's only that my foolish heart is bound with foolish pride.  
Maybe some day I'll see the sunshine upon your face.  
  
Now I won't be blue with dreams that won't come true.  
I'll take my heart, and head right for the door.  
  
I'll take my heart, and head right for the door
