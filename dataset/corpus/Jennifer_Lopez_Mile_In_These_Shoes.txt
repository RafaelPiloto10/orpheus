Strangers always got some mess to spread  
But I have learned to flick them off  
Can't walk a mile in my YSLs  
I strap them on and I walk it off  
  
Got 'em saying: I can't believe  
She did it no she didn't  
My wild factor's got them crazy  
Got 'em saying: yea she did it  
But I can't believe it  
Never said you can't believe  
  
Even if they try  
They still can't walk a mile in these shoes  
They couldn't even lace them up right  
Honey these ones are too big to fill  
Ten million men can't walk a mile in these shoes  
  
My strut's so fierce  
Steven's gotten mad at me  
Laugh and talk behind my back  
But they'll never get the best of me  
I see 'em doing my dance  
I hear 'em singing my song  
I'm surpassing the rest  
Cause that's how I was raised to do it  
  
Got 'em saying: I can't believe  
She did it no she didn't  
My wild factor's got them crazy  
  
Got 'em saying: yea she did it  
But I can't believe it  
Never said you can't believe  
  
Even if they try  
They still can't walk a mile in these shoes  
They couldn't even lace them up right  
Honey these ones are too big to fill  
Ten million men can't walk a mile in these shoes  
  
Even if they try  
They still can't walk a mile in these shoes  
They couldn't even lace them up right  
Honey these ones are too big to fill  
Ten million men can't walk a mile in these shoes  
  
I'm walkin tall  
I don't let their hatred test me  
They bite the dust  
Head over water, they still can't breathe  
My feet pound the ground  
As I stomp it out  
I dare you to walk a mile in my shoes  
  
Even if they try  
They still can't walk a mile in these shoes  
They couldn't even lay some up right  
Honey these walks are too big to fill  
Ten million men can't walk a mile in these shoes
