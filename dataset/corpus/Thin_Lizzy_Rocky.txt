Cocky rocky, the rock and roll star  
He's got the talent to take him far  
Started out playing hotel bars  
Cocky rocky, the rock and roll star  
  
Spent his time just looking for kicks  
Whipping out them tricks to pull the chicks  
Just have a chance every way he rips  
Come on rocky take me into the night  
  
The neon streets are shining bright  
To all them queens you bring the light  
That cocky rocky  
His belt is so tight  
  
Hits the stage, the show begins  
Dressed in black to make him thin  
The speed they flash and when he grins  
Sail away rocky and nobody sings (?)  
  
Come on rocky and throw the dice  
You threw it once, now throw it twice  
Heavy boys, they want a slice  
They paid their money, they want a choice  
  
Cocky rocky, the rock and roll star  
He's got the talent to take him far  
And all he needs is that old guitar  
Cocky rocky, the rock and roll star
