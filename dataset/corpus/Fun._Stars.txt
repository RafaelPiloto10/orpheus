Growing old is getting old  
I often find myself here thinking  
About the birds, the boats, and past loves that flew away or started sinking  
And it's crazy here without you  
I used to think this all was ours  
We'd stay up late, debate on how we'd find our way  
Say it's all up in the stars  
  
Some nights I rule the world  
With bar lights and pretty girls  
But most nights I stay straight and think about my mom  
Oh god, I miss her so much  
  
And there are people on the street  
They're coming up to me  
They're telling me that they like what I do now  
And so I tried my best when I took the fall  
To get right back up, back in your arms  
If you're out here why do I miss you so much  
  
I feel like I had it all  
Back before I lost it all  
Now I just wait for you to talk to me  
But you won't even look at me, baby  
  
And I'd be saying that you  
You're always holding on to stars  
I think they're better from afar  
Cause no one is gonna save us  
  
Oh, and me  
Well, I have faded in the dark  
So don't you ever kiss me  
Don't you wish on me  
Why can't you see that no one's gonna save us?  
Oh, come on girl  
  
I just need a helping hand  
I close my eyes and think about tomorrow  
It never came true  
It came true  
It never came true  
  
Oh, and you  
You're always holding on to stars  
You're always holding on to stars  
'Cause no one is gonna save us  
  
Oh, and you (you)  
You're always holding on to stars  
I think they're better from afar  
Because no one is gonna save us  
  
Oh, and me  
I have faded in the dark  
So don't you ever kiss me  
Don't you wish on me  
Why can't you see that no one's gonna save us?  
No one's gonna save us  
No one's gonna save me now  
  
No, no, no  
No, no, no  
No one's gonna save us  
Who we are, who we are  
Who you are, who you are  
Who you are, who you are  
Who you are, who you are  
You're always holding on to stars  
You're always holding on to stars  
You're always holding on to stars  
You're always holding on to stars  
You're always holding on to stars  
You're always holding on to stars  
You're always holding on to stars
