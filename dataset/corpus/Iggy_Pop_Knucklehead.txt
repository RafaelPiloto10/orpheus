Fancy Apple lap top cost 5 grand  
Fresh girl in a T-shirt silll looks best  
Travel to a sunny quiet land  
Layin' on the beach I miss my pests  
Life's turning up the pressure  
  
It's makin' me aggressive  
The music sounds like dead ham  
The dj is a con man  
He's sayin'...  
  
I I I want something from you  
I I I want something from you  
I I I want something from you  
Knucklehead what can you do  
What can you do?  
  
One day I went out to buy a truck  
I found one that looked so huge and big  
Once I got that sucker on the road  
I was looking down at everything  
And I really liked that  
Everyone obeyed me  
I thought this is power  
Like that religious hour  
When the preacher says...  
  
I I I want something from you  
I I I want something from you  
I I I want something from you  
Knucklehead what can you do?  
  
Something from you Something from you  
Something from you Something from you  
  
Once the telephone starts ringing I stop thinking  
Sittin' at the TV I'm just blinking  
Go to the compuler and I'm punching  
What's this information that I'm munching  
The leader and the followers  
The rock star and the model  
The general and the perverts  
They're poking me where it hurts (ouch!)  
  
I I I want something from you  
I I I want something from you  
I I I want something from you  
Knucklehead what can you do?
