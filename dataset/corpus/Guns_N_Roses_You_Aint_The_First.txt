I tried so hard just to get through to you  
But your head's so far  
From the realness of truth  
Was it just a come on in the dark  
Wasn't meant to last long  
I think you've worn your welcome honey  
I'll just see you along as I sing you this song  
  
Time can pass slowly  
Things always change  
Your day's been numbered  
And I've read your last page  
You was just a temporary love  
But honey you ain't the first  
Lots of other come before you woman  
Said but you been the worst  
Said you been the worst  
  
So goodbye to you girl  
So long, farewell  
I can't hear you cryin'  
Your jivin's been hell  
So look for me walkin'  
Down your street at night  
I'll be in with another  
Deep down inside  
Deep down inside
