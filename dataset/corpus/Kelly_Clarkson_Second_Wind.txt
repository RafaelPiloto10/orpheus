Why do we build up all these idols  
Just to watch 'em fall?  
You're wearin' the crown, toast of the town  
And no one takes your call  
  
Yeah maybe I've been down, down, down, down  
But I always come back around, 'round, 'round, 'round  
  
You can't forget about me  
While you weren't lookin' I was gettin' even higher  
Say what you want about me  
Your words are gasoline on my fire  
You can hate me, underestimate me  
Do what you do cause what you do don't phase me  
Just when you think I'm at the end  
Any second I'ma catch my second wind  
  
An airplane's only paper 'til it finds a breeze  
But don't you know that it's the low that makes the high so sweet?  
When they try to break, break, break you  
That's when you get your break, break, breakthrough  
  
You can't forget about me  
While you weren't lookin' I was gettin' even higher  
Say what you want about me  
Your words are gasoline on my fire  
You can hate me, underestimate me  
Do what you do cause what you do don't phase me  
Just when you think I'm at the end  
Any second I'ma catch my second wind  
  
Yeah maybe I've been down, down, down, down  
But I always come back around, 'round, 'round, 'round  
  
You can't forget about me  
While you weren't lookin' I was gettin' even higher  
Say what you want about me  
Your words are gasoline on my fire  
You can hate me, underestimate me  
Do what you do cause what you do don't phase me  
Just when you think I'm at the end  
Any second I'ma catch my second wind
