I was folding up your letters  
Unpacking winter clothes  
Searching for my hat  
I thought I left it by the door  
So I tore around the room  
Like a bird without a head  
I saw your picture waving back at me  
From underneath the bed  
From a long, long time ago  
  
When all I had  
Was a hat full of stars  
The one I'll always treasure  
The one that you wore  
You loved the look  
But you never looked inside  
You would have seen us there  
You could've seen far  
You should've seen the magic  
In my hat full of stars  
  
I'm trying to live in the present  
But I keep tripping on the past  
Finding out reality, well clarity  
Comes in dribs and drabs  
No we never had the time  
For everything we had  
So it felt like we had nothing  
That's what makes this hat so sad  
It was a long, long time ago  
  
When all we had  
Was a hat full of stars...  
You would have seen us there  
You could've seen far  
You should've seen the magic  
In my hat full of stars  
  
Now whenever I'm alone  
And I think I might forget  
I wear my lucky hat  
Just like a crown up on my head  
'Cause all I have  
Is a hat full of stars...  
If you could see me now  
You would've seen far  
You should've seen the magic  
In my hat full of stars...
