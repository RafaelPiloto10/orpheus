Do you wake up very slowly?  
Does it take a while before you smile  
Are your dreams like premonitions  
Have you lived them through  
Some people do  
I hope you'll answer me with patient eyes  
No hurried words, foolish or wise  
Answer me, answer me with soft silent touches  
They'll tell me as much as i need to know  
Answer me with deep and restful sleeping  
  
And if you dream in sleep  
They're yours to keep  
No you need not answer me  
If we must part  
Should someone ask  
Who's touched your heart  
Perhaps you'll answer me
