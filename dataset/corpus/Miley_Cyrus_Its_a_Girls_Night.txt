Don't call me  
Leave me alone  
Not gonna answer my phone  
Cuz I don't  
No I won't see you  
  
I'm out to have a good time  
To get you off of my mind  
Cuz I don't  
And I won't need you (woot! Woot!)  
  
Send out a 911  
We're gonna have some fun  
Hey boy, you know  
You better run  
  
Cuz it's a girl's night  
It's alright without you  
I'm gonna stay out  
And play out without you  
You better hold tight  
This girl's night is without you  
Let's go  
G. N. O.  
Let's go  
It's a girl's night  
  
I'll dance with somebody new  
Won't have to think about you  
And who knows  
What let go will lead to  
  
You'll hear from everyone  
You'll get the 411  
Hey boy  
You knew this day would come  
  
[Chorus:]  
Cuz it's a girl's night  
It's alright without you  
I'm gonna stay out  
And play out without you  
You better hold tight  
This girl's night is without you  
Let's go  
G. N. O.  
Let's go  
It's a girl's night  
  
Hey boy  
Don't you wish you could have been a good boy  
Try to find another girl like me, boy  
Feel me when I tell ya  
I am fine  
And it's time for me to draw the line  
  
[Chorus:]  
Cuz it's a girl's night  
It's alright without you  
I'm gonna stay out  
And play out without you  
You better hold tight  
This girl's night is without you  
Let's go  
G. N. O.  
Let's go  
It's a girl's night
