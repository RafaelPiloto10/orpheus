There's you, you're sleeping over there  
Whilst me I'm sitting here  
With so much sea between us  
I can't make it much more clear  
There'll be no time for crying  
We won't make it more than six  
I could change my plea to guilty  
But I don't think it would stick  
Still those other ratings far too easy to despise  
You've said so much in silence now I truly am disguised  
  
Let him who fears his heart alone  
Stand up and make a speech  
For him perhaps an emperor's throne  
If he could only speak  
Far too few and far to follow  
For shame I'll heed the cry  
Be with me when I need a drink  
Be with me when I die  
Still those other ratings far too easy to despise  
You've said so much in silence now indeed I am disguised
