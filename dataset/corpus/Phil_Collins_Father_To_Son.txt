Somewhere down the road, you're gonna find a place  
It seems so far, but it never is  
You won't need to stay, but you might lose your strength  
On the way  
  
Sometimes you may feel you're the only one  
Cause all the things you thought were safe, now they're gone  
But you won't be alone, I'll be here to carry you along  
Watching you 'til all your work is done  
  
When you find your heart, you'd better run with it  
Cause when she comes along, she could be breaking it  
No there's nothing wrong, you're learning to be strong  
Don't look back  
She may soon be gone, no don't look back  
She's not the only one, remember that  
  
If your heart is beating fast, then you know she's right  
If you don't know what to say, well, that's all right  
You don't know what to do?  
Remember she is just as scared as you  
  
Don't be shy, even when it hurts to say  
Remember, you're gonna get hurt someday, anyway  
Then you must lift your head, keep it there  
Remember what I said  
I'll always be with you don't forget  
Just look over your shoulder I'll be there.  
  
If you look behind you, I will be there.
