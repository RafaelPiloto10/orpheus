[Fabolous]  
Yeah..Uhh..  
I know I make you want to leave the one you with,  
But I ain't Usher Raymond,  
I'm the kid that they rush to blamin', for the crush they claimin',  
Who can make em' blush the same when I ask,  
  
"What's my name" and they yell,  
F-A-be -Ohh  
You shouldn't have even brought her my direction,  
Unless she was handcuffed with an order of protection, Yeah.  
I'm talkin wreckless now,  
'Cause I'm the reason that your girlfriends are your ex's now..nigga  
  
[Mike Shorey]  
I'm the fella that keep em yellin, and its nuttin to get em,  
I don't sweat em', its what I tell em',  
And they quickly forget em',  
And I bet em' I get them to forget the day that they met em'  
  
And I let em', cause I can spend em'  
And its more then the denim,  
But I've been  
Born to move, while you dudes be sleeping,  
  
The coupe on 22's keep the Shorey sneaking,  
And she won't tell the truth, she too used to creepin  
The mic is in the booth, it's the truth I'm speaking  
  
[Fabolous]  
Any girl I gave it to..  
can't even go love another man,  
I give it to em' like no other brother can,  
She say my man can barely move me,  
  
Before you made me scream, like a scary movie,  
On top of that,  
I'm smoother then the rest of the gangsters,  
And I knew that dude you met, was a wanksta  
  
Oh.  
Damn homie,  
Your girl is with the street Fab. Homie,  
And she ain't fuckin with you  
  
[Mike Shorey]  
It's a shame, you lames  
Can't even maintain your thangs,  
And its insane the way, that she gave me brain  
I pimp things the same, don't forget the name  
  
And when chicks peep the chain, they just can't restrain  
Shorty don't try to fake it,  
Just up and face it,  
Your time is being wasted, your mans a basic  
  
See it all in his face, that he's cheap and tasteless,  
But life is what you make it, just watch the bracelet  
  
[Fabolous]  
I bet your man can't do it like me,  
His veins don't pump pimp fluid like me,  
He's nowhere near or like me,  
And he probably think keeping you in check,  
  
Is buying you a pair of Nike's  
Why wouldn't I.. get dough from her,  
When the digits on my checks, look like phone numbers  
Fuck It,  
  
You might as well tell that buster skid addle,  
Not even Catherine can help him in his custody battle  
Yeah.  
  
[Mike Shorey]  
You can catch me in the club, with a case of bub  
And a thick chick to rub, niggas hate because  
When they sit in the truck, they be quick to fuck  
When I'm getting a nut, they just lick it up  
  
I'm in favor if, bust a flow is dangerous,  
I don't aim to give shortys our relationships,  
But they crave the chips, how many the range can fit  
She just changed a bit, since I got the hang of it  
  
[Fabolous Talking]  
That's right we got the hang of it,  
Mike shorey  
Fabolous  
Street family  
Desert storm  
I know you his but I want to make you mine.  
You know..haha..yeah
