There's a light  
At the end of the tunnel  
It's rock and roll  
  
There's no fight  
Words into action  
Your life is your own  
  
The tarp is rising  
Take the thunder  
And show us your home  
  
I say  
  
We celebrate it  
We generate it  
  
The main attraction  
Satisfaction guaranteed to rock the chains that bind you  
  
Oh whoa-whoa!  
  
You can fate  
Your time has come  
To feel the need  
  
Don't be safe  
The sky is the limit  
No need to retreat  
  
So take your best shot  
And place your bet on what you know  
(God can tell you)  
  
The stage is set now  
You've got to know how  
  
For  
  
The main attraction  
Satisfaction guaranteed to rock the chains that bind you  
The main attraction  
Your reaction guaranteed to leave your tracks behind you  
  
In the end  
We'll stand in the spotlight  
We are the show  
(Here we go)  
  
We'll defend  
Here's our performance  
It's all we know  
  
We capture the moment  
Power and glory is ours to hold  
(And you never let go)  
  
It's a celebration  
The instigation  
  
It's  
  
The main attraction  
Satisfaction guaranteed to rock the chains that bind you  
The main attraction  
Your reaction guaranteed to leave your tracks behind you  
  
Main attraction  
Satisfaction

Your reaction
