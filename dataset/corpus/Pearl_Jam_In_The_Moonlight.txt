In the moonlight  
Gettin', why I ought to get back  
It's a, this day is sure to relapse  
It's getting closer to up-ends  
  
In the moonlight  
Given two lost wings  
A beautiful star, I see  
A wonderful sense of feeling  
  
In the moonlight  
Feel, it's a love draw nearer  
Darkened days, I spent in  
A night bird is following you all the time  
  
Under a star-lined ceiling  
In darkness, I see  
All your senses revealed  
In the moonlight  
  
It's, it's the love draw nearer  
Darkened days, I spent in  
A night bird is following you all the time  
It's a love draw nearer  
  
Darkened days, I spent in  
A night bird is following you  
Is following you  
A night bird is following you all the time
