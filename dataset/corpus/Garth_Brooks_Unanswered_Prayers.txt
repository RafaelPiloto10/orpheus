Just the other night a hometown football game  
My wife and I ran into my old high school flame  
And as I introduced them the past came back to me  
And I couldn't help but think of the way things used to be  
  
She was the one that I'd wanted for all times  
And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine  
And if he'd only grant me this wish I wished back then  
I'd never ask for anything again  
  
[Chorus]  
Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers  
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs  
That just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care  
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers  
  
She wasn't quite the angel that I remembered in my dreams  
And I could tell that time had changed me  
Inn her eyes too it seemed  
We tried to talk about the old days  
There wasn't much we could recall  
I guess the Lord knows what he's doin' after all  
  
And as she walked away and I looked at my wife  
And then and there I thankedd the good Lord  
For the gifts in my life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Some of God's greatest gifts are all too often unanswered...  
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers
