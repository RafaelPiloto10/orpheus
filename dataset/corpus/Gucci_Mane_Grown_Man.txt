Now that I'm finally free,  
I'm 'bouta throw it again  
I take my life in my hands  
Cause I'm much more than a man  
(I am grown ass man)  
Now that I'm finally free  
  
I was lost but now I'm found  
I was blind but now I see  
Super high can't touch the ground  
Life tested me but god blessin' me  
Every sixteen bars is testimony  
From the jailhouse junk to the Testarossa  
I have find myself then remind myself  
Woke up I'm grown I gotta blame myself  
Streets taught me everything I train to sell  
Did wrong so long know didn't know nothin' else  
Then my lima crew was like me a member  
Think every man worth, enemies himself  
Glad as well but I'm mad as hell  
Cause my best friend probably gon' die in jail  
I ain't no lie to tell prolly cry like hell  
If I dwell on it 'cause he got a eighty years  
I'm going hard see I might as well  
Guess I gotta a hard head like my daddy had  
And my daddy dad my great great great great  
Grandpa had a really crazy swag  
So I stand a day  
Diggin' down a grave  
That if I can change now  
And my mind is made  
A got a point and prove  
And a sign to raise  
Can't let them make mistakes  
That his daddy made  
  
Finally free,  
You're never send me away  
Took everything that I had  
For me to follow the plan  
Now that I'm finally free,  
I'm 'bouta throw it again  
I take my life in my hands  
Cause I'm much more than a man  
Now that I'm finally free  
  
Squash the beef im free of that  
This crazy summer ain't feelin that  
I guess they wanna see us kill each other  
If im dead who the fuck gon' help my mother  
I done struggled to hustle im too hard for this  
I done rushed and killed ain't proud of that  
Smoke weed took pills sold powder patches  
I'm a solider I understand where the cowards at  
My home boy gone where the flowers at  
Out of money and the work can't bring that back  
If I had one wish, wish momma there  
Could come down now and see me rap  
But she see me now and I believe in that  
Wanna script of that, I ain't going back  
So I put my family on I my back  
Lost so much I cant pay that back  
I was lost but now I'm found  
I was blind but now I see  
Super high can't touch the ground  
Life tested me but god blessin' me  
Every sixteen bars is testimony  
From the jailhouse junk to the Testarossa  
I have find myself then remind myself  
Fuck up the wrong I gotta blind myself  
It's Gucci, huh  
  
Finally free,  
You'll never take me away  
Took everything that I have  
For me to follow the plan  
Now that I' m finally free,  
I'm 'bouta do it again  
I take my life in my hands  
Cause I'm much more than a man  
Now that I'm finally free  
  
I was lost but now I'm found  
Don't you push, can't keep me down  
Seen my life go round and round  
I say I straighten out my life  
And I ain't never going back no  
  
Now that I'm finally free,  
Finally free,  
You'll never take me away  
You'll never take me away  
To get everything that I have  
Everything that I  
You need to follow the plan  
You need to follow the plan  
Now that I'm finally free,  
Finally free  
I'm 'bouta do it again  
Throw it again  
I take my life in my hands  
I take my life in my hands  
Cause I'm much more than a man  
I'm much more than a man  
Now that I'm finally free  
  
(I am grown ass man)
