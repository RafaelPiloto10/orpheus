I can't be any more  
In love with you  
You gotta realize, baby  
There ain't nowhere  
I can find now  
  
Anymore to  
That I can criticize  
From the bottom of my heart  
I really love you  
Oh, yes, I do now  
  
It didn't take  
Too long to be sure  
From the bottom of my heart  
Oh, I really do  
  
Things you do, I admire  
And I'm in love with you  
You gotta realize that, baby  
  
Every day I love goes  
Higher and higher  
I find no faults in you  
That I can criticize  
  
From the bottom of my heart  
Oh, I really love you  
Oh, yes, I do now  
  
It didn't take  
Too long to be sure  
From the bottom of my heart  
Oh, I really do  
  
Now don't you ever go away  
Without you I don't know  
Just where to start over  
I'm asking you to stay  
And, baby, I know I'm saying it  
From the bottom of my heart  
  
It's a love that I know  
And I'm in love with you  
Oh, you gotta realize, baby  
As day by day our love  
Will grow  
  
I find no faults in you  
That I can criticize  
From the bottom of my heart  
Oh, I really love you  
Yes, I do now  
  
It didn't take  
Too long to be sure  
From the bottom of my heart  
Oh, I really do  
  
Oh, I really do love you  
I really do love you, baby  
Yeah, I really love you  
Yeah, love, ohhh
