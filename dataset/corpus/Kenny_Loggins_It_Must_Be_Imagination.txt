When the feeling isn't right?  
They say, you see it in a lover's eye  
But I'm wide awake tonight  
'N I'm looking for a reason why  
It doesn't show  
Still somehow, I know  
Tell me that it just ain't so  
Say, I made the whole thing up  
It must be imagination  
Why can't I forget it?  
God, you'd think I'd know better  
It must be imagination  
Gone completely out of my mind  
It must be imagination  
Tearin' me apart  
'N breakin' my heart  
You can say what is real  
You can tell me if I'm in a dream  
'Cause I know what I feel  
But I don't know what to believe  
Turn on the night light  
Even if it takes us all night  
I gotta be sure by daylight  
If I've made this whole thing up  
It must be imagination  
Tell me if I'm right  
'Cause it's changing my life  
It must be imagination  
Everybody knows  
There ain't no way to fight it  
It must be imagination  
Breakin' my heart  
'N tearing me apart  
If I'm only dreamin'  
Then I'm cryin' in my sleep  
You should be shakin' me  
Why ain't you wakin' me up?  
It must be imagination  
God, I must be losin' my mind  
It must be imagination  
Does anybody know  
Is there anyway to fight it?  
It must be imagination  
All in my mind, all in my mind  
It must be imagination  
If you wanna go, I just got to know  
It must be imagination  
Ooh, tell me what's the problem  
Why you wanna go on breakin' my heart?
