Damn Ma, I love you like a lot  
Gonja, sensamelia, can I feel ya?  
All I wannah do, is touch ya  
The ultimate rush, the drugs, baby  
Don't you know, I'm the ultimate?  
To get this milk, you be fortunate  
Just like tasting pussy with pork in it  
People stop, when I'm walking in  
I'm twisting, twisting, I'm back on ten  
And I'm talking 'bout like Mase, come back again  
My steez is immaculate  
My paper stacking, keep tracking  
I'm macing, y'all slacking, reaction  
Make y'all dicks scream  
I'm more gutter then golddiggers with figures  
More bigger then Jiggas, and even Paris Hiltons  
Damn sir, sniff me like a Coke  
Thrillons, me won't give you none  
Cintamelia, all you wannah do is sniff me  
The ultimate rush, get high, baby  
Damn sir, sniff me like a Coke  
Three lines, me won't give you none  
Cintamelia, all you wannah do is sniff me  
The ultimate rush, the drugs, baby  
Damn Ma, I love you like a lot  
Gonja, sensamelia, can I feel ya?  
All I wannah do, is touch ya  
The ultimate rush, the drugs, baby  
Damn Ma, I love you like a lot  
Gonja, sensamelia, can I feel ya?  
All I wannah do, is touch ya  
The ultimate rush, the drugs, baby  
Now, Biggie Smalls is not the type to fall in love  
When I just hit em' and forget em' and go handle my business  
I like the kind who wine and dine, who grinding all the time  
Your X girl was a 5, but you not let up on a dime  
What is this with you? All you wannah do is lay around  
And stay around and get mad when I play around  
I like to lay, never work, put your money in my purse  
To the mall, I'll go search matching shoes for my skirt  
Tuesday, I saw you in a Z, but you still wannah get with me  
Wednesday is the Benz day, that's what your friends say  
Me and my friends, got your Benz  
Attracting mens, and spending dividence, blowing like the wind  
Damn Ma, I love you like a lot  
Gonja, sensamelia, can I feel ya?  
All I wannah do, is touch ya  
The ultimate rush, the drugs, baby  
Damn Ma, I love you like a lot  
Gonja, sensamelia, can I feel ya?  
All I wannah do, is touch ya  
The ultimate rush, the drugs, baby  
So I guess, you think I'm slipping, 'cause I ain't flipping  
Baby, I'm Big Poppa, ain't no need to be tripping  
I ain't tripping or flipping, I'm just niggah sipping  
At the bar tipping, with your money, can you pay the difference?  
It seems like it's a waste of time, that's why I wrote the rhyme  
I hear you jumping in every car except for mine  
Niggah, I don't jump in cars, I'm a superstar  
Face way too flaw, You should hang me on your wall  
All I do all day is drink Tanguray  
Thinking of a way to put a smile on your face  
Make me smile, see them teeth, Milo, cut down to them feets  
Chubby waste, my physique, me don't want a freak a leek  
Should I wine and dine and put rings on your fingers?  
While sex from the next man in the bedroom lingers?  
Sex will never linger, hold up, put on your blinkers  
I flow just like sprinklers, give your ass the middle finger  
You'd better slow your role, baby  
You ain't got enough dough to pay me  
You know the pen number, just page me  
When you're real, baby  
Damn Ma, I love you like a lot  
Gonja, sensamelia, can I feel ya?  
All I wannah do, is touch ya  
The ultimate rush, the drugs, baby  
Damn Ma, I love you like a lot  
Gonja, sensamelia, can I feel ya?  
All I wannah do, is touch ya  
The ultimate rush, the drugs, baby
