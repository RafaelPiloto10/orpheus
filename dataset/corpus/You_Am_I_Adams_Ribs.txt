Don't look at my waist 'cause the pants don't fit right.  
I'm a dedicated follower of skin tight  
As long as we don't eat everything will be fine.  
I just want to look fascinating, snorting the diet pills I'm grating  
  
As long as we throw up everything will be fine.  
As long as we're emasciated  
Tastes outdated, yeah, everything will be fine.  
Everytime I eat is a slate away from every photo that I emulate.  
  
As long as my fingers fit everything will be fine.  
Cheeks like a valley and ribs like grater  
But just think of all that cash I'm saving.  
As long as we throw up everything will be fine.  
  
As long as we're emasciated  
Taste out dated, yeah, everything will be fine.  
It will be fine. It will be fine.  
Make me grow up.
