Kiss me  
Hold me  
Touch me  
Don't let this moment end  
Please, don't let this moment end  
At least 'til once again  
Our hearts can be together  
Please, I've never let you go  
But still I need to know  
This night will last forever  
Oh please  
You know you own my heart  
Just tell me where to start  
Don't make me wait much longer  
Oh please  
I know tonight's the night  
It never felt so right  
Just hold me in your arms and  
Kiss me  
Hold me  
Touch me  
Don't let this moment end  
Please, I'm begging you to stay  
Just throw the world away  
Pretend there's no tomorrow  
And I will never leave your side  
Never let this feeling die  
Just let our love grow stronger  
Oh please  
You know you own my heart  
Just tell me where to start  
Don't make me wait much longer  
Oh please  
I know tonight's the night  
It never felt so right  
Just hold me in your arms and  
Kiss me  
Hold me  
Touch me  
Don't let this moment end  
Can we make this moment last forever?  
Tell me if you feel the way I do  
Ohh  
Don't let this moment end  
Never end  
Please  
You know you own my heart  
Just tell me where to start  
Don't make me wait much longer  
Oh please  
I know tonight's the night  
It never felt so right  
Just hold me in your arms and  
Kiss me  
Hold me  
Touch me  
Don't let this moment end  
Oh please  
I know tonight's the night  
It never felt so right  
Just hold me in your arms and kiss me
