Mmm  
Oh, in the dead of night  
Adrift on the ocean wide  
High on the mountain side  
You can count on me  
If you're deep in the jungle boy  
Caught in a winter storm  
Kidnapped by anyone  
I'll set you free  
Say the word - I'll be there  
To give you loving care  
There's nothing that I wouldn't do (for you)  
Say the word - I'll be there  
I'll reach you anywhere  
Nothing can keep me away from you  
If you're lost in the wilderness  
Can't tell the East from West  
Just feeling second best  
I won't let you down  
When night comes around again  
And you're without a friend  
I'm yours til the very end  
I'm come around  
Say the word - I'll be there  
To give you loving care  
There's nothing that I wouldn't do (for you)  
Say the word - I'll be there  
I'll reach you anywhere  
Nothing can keep me away from you  
If you're deep in the jungle boy  
Caught in a winter storm  
Kidnapped by anyone  
I'll set you free  
Say the word - I'll be there  
To give you loving care  
There's nothing that I wouldn't do (for you)  
Say the word - I'll be there  
I'll reach you anywhere  
Nothing can keep me away from you  
Say the word - I'll be there  
To give you loving care  
There's nothing that I wouldn't do (for you)

Nothing can keep me away from you
