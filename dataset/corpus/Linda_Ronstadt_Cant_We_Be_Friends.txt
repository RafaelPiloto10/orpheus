I thought I found the man of my dreams  
Now it seems  
This is how the story ends  
He's going to turn me down  
And say "Can't we be friends?"  
  
I thought for once it couldn't go wrong  
Not for long  
I can see the way this ends  
He's going to turn me down  
And say "Can't we be friends?"  
  
Never again  
Through with love  
Through with men  
They play their game without shame  
And who's to blame?  
  
I thought I found a man I could trust  
What a bust  
This is how the story ends  
He's going to turn me down  
And say "Can't we be friends?"  
  
Why should I care  
Though he gave me the air?  
And why should I cry?  
Even sigh  
Or wonder why?  
  
I thought for once it couldn't go wrong  
Not for long  
I can see the way this ends  
He's going to turn me down  
And say "Can't we be  
Can't we be  
Can't we be  
Can't we be  
Can't we be  
Can't we be friends?"
