Pray by the candle and I hope to see light  
Wait for the moment but it's never right  
So now I'm sailing on the oceans so wide  
I'm all alone, me and my daydreams and I  
Pray by the candle and I hope to see light  
Wait for the moment but it's never right  
So I'm the captain my ship's got a hole in the side  
I'm all alone, me and my daydreams at night  
Can you see me walking through the trees  
Can you hear me laughing in the breeze  
Can you see me walking through the trees  
Can you hear me laughing in the breeze  
Pray by the candle and I hope to see light  
Wait for the moment but it's never right  
Across the water I watch my ship waves goodbye  
I'm all alone me and my daydreams at night
