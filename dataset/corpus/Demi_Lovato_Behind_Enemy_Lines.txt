And I feel, I feel a deep connection  
And I think, that we might be onto somethin', no  
And I know it's somethin' special  
Seein' you here is not coincidental, mhmm  
  
Well I've been walkin', walkin' behind enemy lines  
And I've been fightin', fightin' from the other side  
I've been sayin', sayin' that I won't fall this time  
But now I'm walkin', walkin' within enemy lines  
  
Ooh, oh  
  
See I was tryin' to be everything you weren't expecting  
All I ever wanted was to try and keep you guessing  
But I'm falling way too fast  
I just want this love to last forever, forever  
And every time I feel this way  
Oh, somethings changed for the better  
(Whoa whoa whoa ooh)  
  
And I've been walkin', walkin' behind enemy lines  
And I've been fightin', fightin' from the other side  
I've been sayin', sayin' that I won't fall this time  
But now I'm walkin', walkin' within enemy lines  
  
And now I'm walkin', walkin' behind enemy lines  
And now I'm fightin, fightin' from the other side  
I've been sayin', sayin' I won't fall this time  
Now I'm walkin', walkin' within enemy lines
