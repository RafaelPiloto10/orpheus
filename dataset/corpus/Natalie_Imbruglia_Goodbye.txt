Every days the same  
I feel them merge  
I try to separate  
Resist the urge  
  
But they tell me I'll be fine  
That it'll all get better  
Just try to write it down  
Or put it in a letter  
  
Still the words won't play,  
And there's no easy way to say  
  
Goodbye, goodbye  
  
Keep my head on straight  
And don't look down  
When all I've pushed away  
I'm losing ground  
  
But they tell me I'll be fine  
That it'll all get better  
Just try to write it down  
Or put it in a letter  
  
Still the words won't play  
And there no easy way to say  
  
Goodbye, goodbye  
  
And from the sidelines watch me  
Fall down  
Don't understand the things I do  
But they tell me I'll be fine  
As long I keep moving  
Just try to write it down  
Till things just keep improving  
  
Still the words won't play  
And there's no easy way to say  
  
Goodbye, goodbye
