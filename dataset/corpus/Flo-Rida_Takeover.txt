[Flo rida] verse 1  
Flo Rida, Mizz Nina  
You better call Mr. Fix-It  
Let em' know we got a problem, Houston  
Flo Rida go up to the moon with the music  
Taking off, boom boom, that acoustics  
Countdown like 1, 2, 3, 4,  
The party don't start till' I'm on the dance floor  
Like 5, 6, 7, 8, we rockin' the club all day  
[Mizz nina] verse 1  
Said I've been rocking' round here, round here  
But it's about to get a little crazy up in here,  
Cause' you can't escape this club  
I'm 'bout to tear it up  
And I can see I gotcha trippin' for this  
Oh and I mean business  
[Hook]Saying Houston,  
We got a little problem, we got a little problem,  
I, Imma gonna solve em'  
Saying Houston,  
We got a little problem, we got a little problem,  
Cause imma gonna rock em'  
[Chorus]This is how it's going down, going down  
And imma gonna break it, break it, break it down,  
Break it down,  
This is a take oh oh over,  
This is a take oh oh over,  
[Mizz nina] verse 2  
Now I want ya out ya head, out ya head  
And imma gonna tell ya and I'll tell ya what I said  
I'm here and I'm in control  
That's just the way I roll  
I'm tearing down the walls until the morning  
Oh, this is a warning  
[Hook]Saying Houston,  
We got a little problem, we got a little problem,  
I, Imma gonna solve em'  
Saying Houston,  
We got a little problem, we got a little problem,  
Cause imma gonna rock em'  
[Chorus]This is how it's going down, going down  
  
And imma gonna break it, break it, break it down,  
Break it down,  
This is a take oh oh over,

[Flo rida] verse 2  
It's all under control, I gotcha hands up  
See when I walk in the door I make em' stand up  
It's like I'm taking a pose, it's all cameras  
Feel a knock at your door, it's like hammers  
Oh baby, get a little crazy, tear the walls down  
Now you gotta pay me  
I'm taking over, put em' up lady  
[Hands up]Now let me see you put your hands up, all your hands  
I wanna see you put your hands up, all your hands  
I wanna see you put your hands up, all your hands  
Now rehydrate before you pass out, fore' you pass out,  
Pass out  
[Hook]Saying Houston,  
We got a little problem, we got a little problem,

Saying Houston,

Cause imma gonna rock em'  
[Chorus]This is how it's going down, going down  
And imma gonna break it, break it, break it down,  
Break it down,  
This is a take oh oh over,
