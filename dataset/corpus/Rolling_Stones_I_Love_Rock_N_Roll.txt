Hey, is this thing on?  
  
I saw him dancing there by the record machine, ah.  
I knew he must have been about 17  
The beat was going strong, playin my favorite song  
I could tell it wouldn't be long 'till he was with me  
(Yeah me)  
I could tell it wouldn't be long 'till he was with me  
(Yeah me)  
  
Chorus  
Singing I love rock and roll  
So put another dime in the jukebox baby  
I love rock and roll  
So come and take the time and dance with me  
  
Owwwwwwwwwwww  
  
He smiled so I got up and asked for his name  
But that don't matter he said cuz it's all the same  
He said can I take ya home, where we can play alone  
And next we're moving on and he was with me  
(Yeah me)  
We were movin' on and singing that same old song  
(Yeah me)  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I love Rock'n Roll yeah  
Cuz it soothes my sooouuuull  
I love rock'n roll  
Yea yea yea  
  
He said can I take ya home where we can be alone  
And next we're movin' on and he was with me  
(Yeah whit me)  
And we were movin' on and singing that same old song  
(Yeah whit me)  
  
Chorus (x5)
