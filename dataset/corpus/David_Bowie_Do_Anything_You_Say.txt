Two by two, they go walking by  
Hand in hand, they watch me cry  
[two by two, hand in hand]  
Lonely nights, I dream you're there  
Morning sun and you're gone  
[lonely nights, morning sun]  
[maybe] I'll do anything you say  
[maybe] I'll do anything you say  
[maybe] I'll do anything you say  
Do anything you say, do anything  
One desire I ask of you  
Please be mine, please be mine  
[one desire, please be mine]  
Thousand years and I'll return  
You'll be mine, you'll be mine  
[thousand years, you'll be mine]  
[maybe] I'll do anything you say  
[maybe] I'll do anything you say  
[maybe] I'll do anything you say  
Do anything you say, do anything  
Two by two they're walking by  
Hand in hand, they watch me cry  
[two by two, hand in hand]  
[maybe] I'll do anything you say  
[maybe] I'll do anything you say  
[maybe] I'll do anything you say  
Do anything you say, do anything  
[maybe] I'll do anything you say  
[maybe] I'll do anything you say  
[maybe] I'll do anything you say  
Do anything you say, do anything you say
