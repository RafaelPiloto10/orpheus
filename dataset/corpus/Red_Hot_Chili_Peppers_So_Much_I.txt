Next stop on the KLM  
Two lips and a sturdy stem  
A funny thing always happens when  
I get a heavy jam  
I'm gonna turn it into hydrogen  
I I, I I, I I, I I I I, I  
  
Cowgirl and a troubadour  
MGM and the lion's roar  
A straight shot to the corner store  
I wanna show you what  
I wanna show you what your head is for  
I I, I I, I I, I I I I, I  
  
So much I, wish i could  
So many I, wish i would  
So much I, wish i could  
Count on you not to defeat me  
  
So much I, wish i could  
So many I, wish i would  
So much I, wish i could  
Count on you not to defeat me  
  
Please don't turn away again  
Please don't turn me into them  
Please don't turn away friend  
Please don't turn me into them  
  
Stand by for the great eclipse  
Rip it out now shake your hips  
Backing off the apocalypse  
I gotta loosen up  
I gotta loosen up to get my grip  
I I, I I, I I, I I I I, I
