Another day you didn't go to school,  
You were in my arms breakin all the rules  
Another night without you by my side,  
This ain't the way to spend our lives  
Sometimes I wanna leave this town  
Find a better place where they won't put us down  
I know time is on our side, so I'm hangin on somehow  
Never gonna give you up  
Never gonna say goodbye  
As long as were together baby we'll survive  
Never gonna let you go  
Never gonna turn away  
Cause I don't wanna lose you  
Never gonna give you up  
People talk about us on the street  
Rumors fly everytime we meet  
But we don't never have to be ashamed  
Our love is real it ain't no game  
You say that we should hide away  
I promise baby we don't have to be afraid  
I know time is on our side, we've just gotta hang on somehow
