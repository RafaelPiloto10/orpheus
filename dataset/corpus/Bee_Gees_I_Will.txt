Is this your voice I heard  
Speakin' my name  
I hang on every word.  
Each letter that I write  
Every day, every night  
But I just can't live and learn  
  
Talkin' to myself and believin'  
I could live without you  
Livin' on the lies and beleivin' that  
Love would stay  
Listen to me please and I'm beggin' on  
My knees before you  
But you don't show me the way  
No you don't show me the way  
  
He may change you're world and someday  
He may break your heart  
And you deserve no better  
If you love him I will step aside  
I offer this to you  
So leave me as I love you still  
And if he don't keep you warm  
You know I will  
You know I will  
  
So this is who you are  
And the rest of my life  
I dedicate to you  
And I know that love can't wait  
There's a moon and a sun  
And a dream that sees me through  
  
A little bit of change and  
A little bit of my desire  
I was shakin' all over and  
I didn't know what to say  
I'm the man in the middle and  
The middle man catches fire  
But I don't know how to go away  
No I don't know how to go away  
  
He became your hero somehow  
I became your clown  
And you deserve no better but my love  
Is here and all I found  
I offer this to you  
So leave me as I love you still  
And if he don't take your heart  
You know I will  
  
It ain't wise  
It ain't smart  
You say there's no doubt about it  
If you decide  
You got somebody else  
When I want you to myself  
I can't stop  
I can't look  
I can't say no more about it  
But my love will go on  
Just as long as the river flows  
  
He will be your king but someday  
He may let you down  
Follow to the letter that my love is  
Real and what I found  
I offer it to you  
So leave me as I love you still  
And if he don't keep you warm  
You know I will
