Running out of time again  
Where did you go wrong this time?  
When your problems overwhelm you  
  
Go get drunk it's party time  
Take a Quaalude, relax your mind  
Relax your body too!  
  
Run from problems but  
You'll never get away  
No one loves you,  
And you wonder why?  
  
Sitting there with your mouth full of beer  
Your eyes are glazed, your face is red  
Who's gonna pick you up and use you for tonight?  
  
And when you're on the streets  
With a needle in your arm  
Selling your body for another fix  
Who's gonna pick you up and take you home with them tonight  
  
Not me! Running out of breath again  
You're an Old Maid, but you're only 15  
You're losing your little girl's charm  
Cry all night but you'll never get it back  
  
Don't be afraid, it's not too late  
Save yourself, I need you here  
Wearing off, wearing out  
I can't think about this cause it makes me sick.
