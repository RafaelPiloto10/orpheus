I don't know what to think of it  
Sometimes I hate it  
Sometimes I love it  
Girl, this relationship we're in  
To say the least it's puzzlin'  
  
Like a crossword puzzle  
Fill in the blanks  
  
[Chorus]  
What's four down and twelve across  
Two letter synonym for lost That's me  
And a three letter word  
That rhymes with through  
Oh I get it, that's you  
  
Never believed in horoscopes  
But to the left of the ad  
For a new dishwashin' soap  
Dear Abby's got some good advice  
For a troubled couple lost in paradise  
  
In the Living section  
Page two  
  
What's four down and twelve across  
Two letter synonym for lost  
That's me  
And a three letter word  
That rhymes with through  
Oh, I get it  
  
That's you, that's me, that's us  
Sometimes love ain't enough  
We try and try  
For the life of me, why did we give up  
  
[Chorus]  
  
That's me  
Oh, that's us  
What's four down and twelve across That's us
