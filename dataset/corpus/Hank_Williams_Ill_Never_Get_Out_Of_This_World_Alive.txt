your lookin' at a man that's gettin' kinda mad  
I had a lot a luck but it's all been bad  
No matter how I struggle and strive,  
I'll never get out of this world alive  
  
My fishin' pole's broke, the creek is full of sand,  
My woman run away with another man  
No matter how I struggle and strive,  
I'll never get out of this world alive  
  
My distant uncle passed away  
And left me quite a mess  
And I was livin' high until the fatal day  
A lawyer proved I wasn't born I was only hatched.  
  
I'm not gonna worry wrinkles in my brow  
Cause nothin's ever gonna be alright no how.  
No matter how I struggle and strive,  
I'll never get out of this world alive  
  
These Shabby shoes I'm wearin' all the time  
Are full of holes and nails  
And brother if I stepped on worn out dime  
I bet a nickel I could tell you if it's heads or tails  
  
I'm not gonna worry wrinkles in my brow  
Cause nothin's ever gonna be alright no how.  
No matter how I struggle and strive,  
I'll never get out of this world alive  
  
No matter how I struggle and strive,  
I'll never get out of this world alive
