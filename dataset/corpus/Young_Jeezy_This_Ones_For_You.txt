[Chorus]  
I'm blowin' good yeah I smoke it by the song,  
And when them niggas call I don't pick up my phone  
Niggas acting like broads make me pick up my tone,  
I had a lil' time so I wrote a lil' song.  
Yeah this one's for you fuck niggas, fuck niggas  
Yeah I'm talkin' bout them fuck niggas, fuck niggas  
Yeah this one's for you fuck niggas, fuck niggas  
Yeah I'm talkin' bout them fuck niggas, them fuck niggas  
Yeah this one's for you  
  
I'm high as Southwest, Jizzle when your flight land,  
I don't know bitch I might fly to england  
Hit the highway with the change, yeah the change man  
I dun it my way with them thangs, changed the game plan  
Had these niggas tellin' lies, they just sound true  
Nigga if you had it like that I would've found you  
I'm tryna cash out a hundred let me get a buck  
Bitch they'll be just like you nigga fake as fuck  
Get em home and they probably all sheet rock  
They sellin' bullshit fuckin' up the street stock  
You living mine and yours thats a double dip  
That synthetic ass shit we call it double whip  
And nigga nothing beat the cross but the double cross  
I ran the streets and rap bitch I'mma double boss  
Them niggas cashed out one I sent a double off  
They knocked him off halfway I took a double loss  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let's put these niggas on the stand, now stand up and be a man  
Raise your hand and swear you weren't my number one fan  
And I'm still that same nigga, you still that same nigga  
But at the same time, I'm starting to get bad vibes  
What I owe you sumthin' nigga, that's what you act like  
I ain't like them other niggas boy, you betta act right  
The first few years of your deal ride your training wheels  
And then you graduate and live how real niggas live  
And I ain't dissin', naw, I ain't dissin'  
But when you sit back and listen, this what the rap game's is missin'  
I'm used to thug niggas, it's too many young niggas with.  
Too much of liquor, too many drugs in em, too many clicks, too much swag
nigga,  
Too many niggas wearing tight shirts and skinnies, walking round with they ass
out  
Y'all betta cash out, gon' put your cash up  
Because I'm all in and if I don't win nigga, I'mma mask up  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hardest part of life niggas cant play they role  
Everybody wanna ride the train, don't wanna pay the toll  
Keep it going young, boy you on a role  
Hoe nigga magazine, you the centerfold  
You can check the resume, nigga I'm good as gold  
Lawn chair ass niggas all they do is fold  
Nigga you talkin' with emotions, you emotional  
You might can get a lil' light, feelin promotional  
Tell me what cha see when you lookin' in the mirror  
Look as this hoe as nigga, I couldn't said it clearer  
And you the same nigga that started up this jewelry game  
And when you see him nowadays the nigga jewelry lame  
Ain't got it by now, nigga you ain't got it  
And why you talkin' like that cause bitch you ain't bout it  
And nigga how ya doin' now, worst then before  
And bitch we winning over here, I've been keeping score.  
  
[Chorus]
