Man, it's been a long day  
Stuck thinking 'bout it driving on the freeway  
Wondering if I really tried everything I could  
Not knowing if I should try a little harder  
  
Ooh, but I'm scared to death  
That there may not be another one like this  
And I confess  
That I'm only holding on by a thin, thin thread  
I'm kicking the curb 'cause you never heard  
The words that you needed so bad  
And I'm kicking the dirt 'cause I never gave you  
The things that you needed to have  
I'm so sad, sad  
  
Man, it's been a long night  
Just sitting here trying not to look back  
Still looking at the road we never drove on  
And wondering if the one I chose was the right one  
  
Ooh, but I'm scared to death  
That there may not be another one like this  
And I confess  
That I'm only holding on by a thin, thin thread  
I'm kicking the curb 'cause you never heard  
The words that you needed so bad  
And I'm kicking the dirt 'cause I never gave you  
The things that you needed to have  
I'm so sad, sad  
  
So sad, so sad  
  
Ooh, but I'm scared to death  
That there may not be another one like this  
And I confess  
That I'm only holding on by a thin, thin thread  
I'm kicking the curb 'cause you never heard  
The words that you needed so bad  
And I'm kicking the dirt 'cause I never gave you  
The things that you needed to have  
  
And I'm kicking the curb 'cause you never heard  
The words that you needed so bad  
I'm so sad, so sad
