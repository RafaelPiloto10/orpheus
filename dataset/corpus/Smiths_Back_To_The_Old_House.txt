I would rather not go  
Back to the old house  
I would rather not go  
Back to the old house  
There's too many  
Bad memories  
Too many memories  
There...  
There...  
There...  
When you cycled by  
Here began all my dreams  
The saddest thing I've ever seen  
And you never knew  
How much I really liked you  
Because I never even told you  
Oh, and I meant to  
Are you still there ?  
Or...have you moved away ?  
Or have you moved away ?  
Oh...  
I would love to go  
Back to the old house  
But I never will  
I never will...  
I never will...  
I never will...
