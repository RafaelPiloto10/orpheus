It's a lovely night  
It's a lovely night  
Well, the sky is clear and the stars are bright  
It's a lovely night  
  
But I'll go lookin' for the fallin' rain  
Keep on movin', keep on playin' that game  
Let's go lookin' for the fallin' rain  
  
It's a lovely night (It's a lovely night)  
It's a lovely night (It's a lovely night)  
Well, the sky is clear and the stars they are bright  
It's a lovely night (It's a lovely night)  
  
But I'll go lookin' for the fallin' rain  
Keep on movin', keep on playin' that game  
Let's go lookin' for the fallin' rain  
On this lovely night  
This lovely night  
On this lovely night  
  
On this lovely night  
This lovely night  
On this lovely night  
Wo ho ho ho ho ho, this lovely night  
Wo ho ho ho ho ho, this lovely night  
Wo ho ho ho ho ho, this lovely night  
Wo ho ho ho ho ho, this lovely night
