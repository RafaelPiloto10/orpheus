Well you can tell it to the radio  
Tell it to the television  
They are not listening  
They are only machines  
I could sit around all day worrying and wishing  
I was one of them  
So you can tell it to me  
Talking to you girl is like long division, yeah  
  
I've been trying to find you  
May I remind you, I'm under oath now  
I've been trying to see you  
'cause I can see you, want the truth now  
I've been trying to tell you  
That I can tell you are  
A singular girl  
You got the teeth of the hydra upon you  
Singular girl, singular girl  
  
Well you can blame it on the moonlight  
Blame it on plate tectonics  
You thought I wasn't listening but I was  
Talk about attraction  
Talk about electronics  
Well you are the reason  
You are because  
Talking to you girl is like long division, yeah  
  
I've been trying to find you  
May I remind you, I'm under oath now  
I've been trying to see you  
'cause I can see you, want the truth now  
I've been trying to tell you  
That I can tell you are  
A singular girl  
You got the teeth of the hydra upon you  
Singular girl, singular girl  
  
Talking to you girl is like long division, yeah  
I've been trying to find you  
May I remind you, I'm under oath now  
I've been trying to see you  
'cause I can see you, want the truth now  
I've been trying to tell you  
That I can tell you are  
A singular girl  
You got the teeth of the hydra upon you  
Singular girl, singular girl  
Singular girl  
You got the teeth of the hydra upon you  
Singular girl, singular girl
