Girl, don't tell me that it's morning  
Can we keep the curtains drawn  
I haven't given you fair warning  
But our ship, she sails at dawn  
  
[Chorus]  
It's true I must be going but I swear I won't be long  
There isn't that much ocean between Boston and St. John's  
I'm a rover and I'm bound to sail away  
I'm a rover. Can you love me anyway?  
  
And if some suitor comes approaching  
Will you let him through your door  
And what if I return half broken  
Will you still want me anymore?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Close your eyes and dream  
Tell me what you see  
Tell me what you want  
Just tell me that you'll wait for me  
  
Girl, don't tell me that it's morning  
Can we keep the curtains drawn  
I haven't given you fair warning  
But our ship, she sails at dawn  
  
[Chorus]
