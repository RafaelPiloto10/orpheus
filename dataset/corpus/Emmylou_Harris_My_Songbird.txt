Songbird in a golden cage  
She'd prefer the blue  
How I crave the liquor of her song  
Poor bird who has done no harm  
  
What harm could she do  
She shall be my prisoner her life long  
My songbird wants her freedom  
Now don't you think I know  
  
But I can't find it in myself  
To let my songbird go  
I just can't let her go  
  
O lord, when your jeweler's eye  
Peers into my soul  
O lord, I am overcome with shame  
Take me lord and purify  
Heal me with a word  
Lord, I beg a gift I dare not claim  
  
My songbird wants her freedom  
Now don't you think I know  
But I can't find it in myself  
To let my songbird go  
I just can't let her go
