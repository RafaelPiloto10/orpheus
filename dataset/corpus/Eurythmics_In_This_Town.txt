I could be anywhere else but here  
But the rain won't let me go.  
There's a photograph  
Hanging on my wall  
Of a place I've never been to  
  
I'll never make the grade  
(Feels like Sunday everyday)  
And I can't stop the rain  
(Feels like Sunday everyday)  
What do the papers say?  
(Feels like Sunday everyday)  
Get up and go now!  
  
[Chorus:]  
In this town, something's gotta change.  
In this town, something's gotta change.  
  
I'm looking at the world,  
Looking for a scene,  
Waiting for a day,  
Filling in time like I'm digging  
My own grave  
  
I'll never make the grade  
(Feels like Sunday everyday)  
And I can't stop the rain  
(Feels like Sunday everyday)  
What do the papers say?  
(Feels like Sunday everyday)  
Get up and go now!  
  
[Chorus]
