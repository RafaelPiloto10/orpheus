Well it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe  
It don't matter anyhow  
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe  
If you don't know by now  
When the rooster crows at the break of dawn  
Look out your window and I'll be gone  
You're the reason I'm travelling on  
Don't think twice it's all right  
  
Well it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe  
Light I've never known  
Ain't no use in turning on the light, babe  
I'm on the dark side of the road  
Wish there was something you could do or say  
Something to make me change my mind and stay  
We never did too much talking anyway  
Don't think twice, it's all right  
  
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal  
Like you've never done before  
It ain't no use in calling out my name, gal  
I can't hear you anymore  
I'm thinking and a wondering, walking down that road  
I once loved a woman - a child I'm told  
Gave her my heart, but she wanted my soul  
Don't think twice, it's all right  
  
So long, honey-babe  
Where i'm bound, I can't tell  
Goodbye is too good a word babe  
I'll just say, "fare thee well"  
I ain't saying you treated me unkind  
You could've done better, but I don't mind  
You just kind of wasted my precious time  
Don't think twice, it's all right
