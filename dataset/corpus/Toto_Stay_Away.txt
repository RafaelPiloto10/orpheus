You gave me too many chances, now it's drivin' us apart  
I keep on runnin' with the boys, girl, but then you knew that from the start  
It must keep building up inside you 'cause you never let it show  
I know I'm hanging on the edge now, but I won't let go  
  
I never meant to hurt you, but something was on my mind  
Just give me one more chance, we can make it this time  
  
Stay away, stay away from my heart, bet I'm trying my best  
Stay away, stay away from my heart  
  
If you gave me three wishes, I'd throw two of them away  
I've seen that look in your eye, girl, I'd use the last one this way  
We've been from rags to riches, but your love can't be bought  
I'm just a junkyard dog, girl, who's afraid he's been caught  
  
You're standing in the shadows, watching everything that I do  
And I know the way things must look, it couldn't be further from the truth  
  
Stay away, stay away from my heart, I'm doing all that I can  
Stay away, stay away from my heart  
  
Remember how it used to be, girl, makin' love like it's the last time  
We held each other close, not knowing what we'd found  
You felt the pounding of my thunder, as your rain was pouring down  
  
I never meant to hurt you, but something was on my mind  
Just give me one more chance, we can make it this time  
  
Stay away, stay away from my heart, yeah, but I want to stay here with you  
Stay away, stay away from my heart, yeah, I'm doing all I can do  
Stay away, stay away from my heart, but I want to stay away from you  
Stay away, stay away from my heart
