Xzibit intro:  
Yes yes. ahh ahh. bring it live  
Yo it's the x to the z from the likwit squad  
Hook:  
"one mc" "after" (x3)  
"on the mic"- souls of mischief  
[xzibit]  
All that get money take money sound funny  
So I stick to my own I can feel it in my bones  
These clones and clowns ain't really down  
Play the background westbound  
Huntin' down pussy like a bloodhound  
Plus I feel that no style is darker than mine  
You can stick that into places where the sun don't shine  
All you one hit wonders only in it for the spotlight  
Spend half a million dollars still don't sound tight  
Bring truth to the light  
I write rhymes for the under  
Blunt smokin' bottle crackin' all day slumber  
Who wouldn't give a fuck if the world fell down  
As long as I can twist a fat one and pass it around  
Mr. x to the z from the likwit crew  
La to elviaire with my man eq  
Coming live and direct with your neck like this  
Come home and smoke a spliff in the benz with swift  
I stay fucked up  
Hook  
[del]  
Lyrically ingenious my flows are intravenous  
Kids are squeamish  
When they attempt to refless  
I'm the apex  
Shows get rocked half the words ?  
Hold your glock your whole goal is props  
You'll never get 'em  
My rhythm just fluctuates  
You can't o.d. no matter how much you take  
I rush your plates  
Crack your lenses clean like benzene  
Cool like menthol  
My shits the end all  
Majorly gain your speed slow your role  
You lie and like pinochio your nose will grow  
Let's go  
Underground compress co  
Bust these jewels these diamonds out  
But still some of these niggas don't know what we rhymin' bout  
Mine in doubt  
Traversing' the earth like zombies  
And rocks your dirty laundry  
Presented to the world as comedy  
Del rips it honestly that's why the girls are found of me  
And don't be squandering your little flow  
You ain't got many  
You're fly spinning  
We constitution  
You seek contribution from del for usage  
Over these acoustics  
I take time out for use of  
Harkus representing proof in you walkman  
Lockin' competition out of studios  
Everyday I live is like a musical  
Create my own score  
More funkier than shaft on my musical path  
Hook  
[casual]  
They like "ooh. don't say that."  
When it's lay doe a dat competition where they at?  
I diss 'em  
Steady at the rhythm  
Like a pilot I keep you silent  
Through the turbulence words will get violent  
Mega doses exposes is flagellant composes  
All you get is roses on your grave you misbehave  
It's the brave courageous lyrically contagious  
Spiritually engage with the psychedelic waves of  
An egyptian  
We rips then  
Cover the mic like the sun we eclipsin'  
Cause no light shine through a flow like mine  
Casual might ignite the mic for pastime  
With one style older than the sundial  
My elaborate connection of words is fun how  
I display, dismay this way gettin' bissy  
Crackers show off the top while I'm hittin' a j  
My immaculate style attackin' with nouns and verbs  
For the wack it gets foul  
Got a full metal jacket off rhymes to press  
To manifest under pressure  
Past style a lyrical treasure  
Never the less I get fresher  
It's involital my biological make up composes of flesh and blows  
Will dispose of all  
When they appear in my crystal ball  
I know you wish I fall  
"yes y'all"  
Hook
