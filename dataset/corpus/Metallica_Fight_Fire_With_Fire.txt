Do unto others as they have done unto you  
But what in the hell is this world coming to?  
  
Blow the universe into nothingness  
Nuclear warfare shall lay us to rest  
  
Fight fire with fire  
Ending is near  
Fight fire with fire  
Bursting with fear  
  
We shall die  
Time is like a fuse, short and burning fast  
Armageddon is here, like said in the past  
  
Fight fire with fire  
Ending is near  
Fight fire with fire  
Bursting with fear  
  
Soon to fill our lungs the hot winds of death  
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath  
  
Fight fire with fire  
Ending is near  
Fight fire with fire  
Bursting with fear  
  
Fight fire with fire
