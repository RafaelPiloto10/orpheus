[Bruno Mars]  
When you want to do something that's new  
And it seems really, really hard to do  
You feel like quitting, you feel you're through  
Well I have some advice for you  
  
Don't give up  
Keep on trying  
You're gonna make it  
I ain't lying  
Don't give up, don't ever quit  
Try and try and you can do it  
Don't give up, yeah  
  
If you want to catch a ball  
But you're having no luck at all  
The ball hits your head, it hits your nose  
It hits your belly, your chin and toes  
Well, try and try and try again  
Keep on trying until the end  
You put your hands out in the air  
You'll catch the ball  
Yes this I swear  
  
Don't give up,  
Keep on going  
You're on a boat,  
So keep on rowing  
Don't give up, don't ever stop  
Try and try and you'll come out on top  
Don't give up  
  
You got yourself rollerskates  
You put them on  
And you feel great  
You stand up  
Then you fall, don't think you can skate at all  
You get back up, then you trip,  
You skip and tip and slip, and flip  
You try and try and try some more  
Soon you're skating across the floor  
  
Don't give up, keep on moving,  
You're gonna get there, just keep on grooving  
Don't give up, don't pack it in  
Try and try, and you'll win  
Don't give up, no no no  
Don't give up, no no no  
Don't give up, no no no  
Don't give up, no no  
Don't give up!
