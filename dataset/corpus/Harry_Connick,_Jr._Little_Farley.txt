Little Farley  
Why you hangin' out so long  
I can tell by the people  
You're runnin' with  
That you're singin' a different song  
  
Little Farley  
What you hidin' in your drawer  
Don't you know that I know what you're doin'  
And it ain't worth dyin' for  
  
Little Farley  
Why you takin' that to school  
Livin' out your life in Angola  
Really don't sound too cool  
  
Little Farley  
Why you want to take a life  
That little girl they laid to rest today  
She coulda been your wife  
  
Little Farley  
You know that don't belong to you  
What you took in less than a minute  
Mighta took him a month or two  
  
Little Farley  
A boy don't have to be a man  
If you can't decide what you want to be  
Then I'm tellin' you no one can  
  
Little Farley  
Think about it...
