It's a can of gas-o-line  
Trapped in a s-ink  
And I think...  
Bad things are happen-ing  
And I just happen to think  
That someone's gonna grab it and fling  
It all over the napkins and the flammable rabbit mink  
After they drink  
It's gonna be on of those hazardous things  
Where people just sit back and laugh as it's happening  
I'm trapped by kin  
And hundreds  
Of bungee jumping  
Bad acting friends  
How can this be happening?  
  
That's just the first verse
