Fun Zone doesn't really have any lyrics.  
People occasionally say "yeah" and other similar phrases,  
But it's generally just music.  
  
In the movie,  
It played in the background  
When Stanley rode out in the miniature fire engine  
At the beginning of an episode of Stanley Spadowski's Clubhouse.  
  
The song is approximately  
1 minute and 45 seconds long,  
But it did not play in its entirety in the movie.
