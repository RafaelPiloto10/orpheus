I'm on fire  
When I was young  
Just for you  
And my heart was pure  
Such desire  
I only wanted love  
Just for you  
I had allure  
Still on fire  
High heels ideals  
Just for you  
And not much fear  
My desire  
It's easy  
Still for you  
To make love appear.  
  
And then something sent me  
For what they had meant to do  
Whatever happened to you?  
  
I'm on fire  
Happiness  
Just for you.  
No more pain  
Such desire  
Happiness  
Just for you.  
  
And love did come  
But in such disguise -  
That I could  
Hardly recognise!  
  
I'm on fire  
So with trust in fate  
Just for you.  
And love of life  
Such desire  
Take my chance  
Just for you.  
Roll the dice.  
  
And whatever sent me  
I'll still be here for you.  
Whatever happens, it's true.  
  
And I'm standing still  
Try to show the way  
Try to change the stage.  
  
I only had to find the key  
Surely love would come to me  
You'd look into my glittering eyes  
And everything will be all right.  
  
And so time passed.  
I began to change.  
I found that I  
Could love again.  
  
I'm on fire  
At first it feels  
Just for you.  
A little strange -  
Such desire  
Happiness  
Just for you.  
No more pain.  
Still on fire  
Happiness  
Still on fire  
No more pain.  
Still on fire  
Happiness  
Still on fire  
No more pain.  
Still on fire
