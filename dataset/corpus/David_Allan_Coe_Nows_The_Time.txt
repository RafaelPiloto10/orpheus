By David Allan Coe  
Dedicated to lovers everywhere. May you always find something in my music to
believe in and hold you together.  
THERE AIN'T NOTHING LIKE WATCHING YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE  
NOTHING LIKE TURNING THOSE GREY SKIES BLUE  
NOTHING LIKE DOING WHAT YOU WANT TO DO  
UNLESS ITS FALLEN IN LOVE  
  
UNLESS ITS FALLEN IN LOVE YOU KNOW  
THERE'S SO MANY PLACES FOR YOUR HEAD TO GO  
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HURRY JUST TAKE IT SLOW  
NOW'S THE TIME TO FALL IN LOVE  
  
THERE AIN'T NOTHING LIKE LIVING ON A SAILBOAT  
NOTHING LIKE SETTING YOUR DREAMS AFLOAT  
NOTHING LIKE TAKING JUST ONE MORE TOKE  
UNLESS ITS FALLEN IN LOVE  
  
THERE AIN'T NOTHING AS PRETTY AS THE SUN GOING DOWN  
NOTHING AS FUNNY AS A CIRCUS CLOWN  
NOTHING LIKE RIDING ON A MERRY GO ROUND  
UNLESS ITS FALLEN IN LOVE
