You dust the bottles on the bar counter  
You're writing screenplays on the side  
Three nights a week can keep a girl workin'  
Sometimes it's good to lose your pride  
These things we do to keep the flame burnin'  
And write our fire in the sky  
Another day to see the wheel turnin'  
Another avenue to try  
It's in the luck of the draw, baby  
The natural law  
Forget those movies you saw, little baby  
It's in the luck of the draw  
The natural law  
(Flame keep on burnin')  
Forget those movies you saw, little baby  
(Wheel ever turnin')  
You turn around and say, it's last orders  
You fix the ribbon in your hair  
Tomorrow's letter by the hall doorway  
Could be the answer to your prayers  
These things we do to keep the flame burnin'  
And write our fire in the sky  
Another day to see the wheel turnin'  
Another avenue to try  
It's in the luck of the draw, baby  
The natural law  
Forget those movies you saw, little baby  
It's in the luck of the draw  
The natural law  
(Flame keep on burnin')  
Forget those movies you saw, little baby  
(Wheel ever turnin')  
These things we do to keep the flame burnin'  
And write our fire in the sky  
Another day to see the wheel turnin'  
Another avenue to try  
It's in the luck of the draw, baby  
The natural law  
Forget those movies you saw, little baby  
It's in the luck of the draw  
The natural law  
(Flame keep on burnin')  
Forget those movies you saw, little baby  
(Wheel ever turnin')  
It's in the luck of the draw  
(Flame keep on burnin')  
The natural law  
(Wheel ever turnin')
