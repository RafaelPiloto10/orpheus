I told you once about a place  
That I had accidentally stumbled upon  
Can you imagine how it feels to find somewhere  
That you can do no wrong  
But it's alright you're safe in my hands  
  
I'll meet you in the sky tonight  
And we will trace some undiscovered stars  
We'll go beyond the universe beyond all understanding,  
Hey, it's not that far  
But it's alright I feel safe in your hands  
  
I can't stand living this way  
Getting by from day to day  
I'm drinking from your loving cup  
I told you things were looking cup  
Oh oh oh so good  
Oh it feels so good  
  
We're all the same but then again  
We're all quite different in our own peculiar ways  
We've come so far and now we're going through another phase  
But it's alright  
We made it so far  
  
I can't stand living this way  
Getting by from day to day  
I'm drinking from your loving cup  
Told you things were looking cup  
  
As we all know it's hard to breathe  
When something spiritual has taken place  
We don't know why we don't know how  
We've been transformed into a state of grace  
But it's alright  
We walk in our sleep  
Yes it's alright  
This is rapture of the deep
