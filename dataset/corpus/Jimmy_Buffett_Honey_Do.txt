You never try to keep the wild ones home  
But mister don't just sit there and wait  
Go out on the town makin' all of the rounds  
It don't matter if you're your own date  
  
Vacantly occupied, sat on the beach til my body got fried  
Dreamin' of your pretty eyes up in South Carolina  
I can't pronounce my are's or g's when I'm speakin' Southerneese  
Honey do, Honey, come and do me again  
  
I've seen your fat cats style  
Three hundred pounds of jive ass smile  
Young girls gigglin' all the while  
That's not my cup of chowder  
  
I go for candlelight  
Cold champagne nearly every night  
Honey, do a little toast to me and you  
  
Honey, why couldn't you have taken the non stop train  
I'm hungry and I really want to see you again  
  
I know it's gettin' late  
Waiter keeps starin' at your empty plate  
Maitre'd keeps tellin' me  
"Sir, she's just not coming."  
  
Now what the hell does Garcon know  
We've been through all this before  
Honey do, Honey, come and do me again  
  
Honey, why couldn't you have taken the non stop train?  
I'm hungry and I really want to see you again  
  
Vacantly occupied, sat on the beach til my body got fried  
Dreamin' of your pretty eyes up in South Carolina  
I can't pronounce my are's or g's when I'm speakin' Southerneese  
Honey do, Honey come and do me again  
Yeah, Honey do, Honey come and do me again.
