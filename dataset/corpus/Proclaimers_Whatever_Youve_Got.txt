Whatever you've got, I want some too.  
Whatever you're drinking, I'll drink with you.  
You're saying "azure", I'm feeling blue.  
That's no lie.  
  
Whatever was done unto your hair,  
Vidal Sassoon was standing there.  
He fought the facists, keep him in your prayers.  
That's no lie.  
  
Whatever the time,  
Whatever the place,  
Whatever the rhyme,  
Whatever the reason.  
I'm giving offence  
And with your defense  
I think we could have  
A very good season.  
  
Whatever the rights, I want the wrongs.  
Whatever the food, let's hear the gong.  
We've spoken the truth for so long,  
We need lies.
