I get up around seven  
Get outta bed around nine  
And I don't worry about nothin' no  
Cause worryin's a waste of my, time  
  
The show usually starts around seven  
We go on stage at nine  
Get on the bus at eleven  
Sippin' a drink and feelin' fine  
  
We been dancin' with  
Mr. Brownstone  
He's been knockin'  
He won't' leave me alone  
  
I used ta do a little but a little wouldn't do  
So the little got more and more  
I just keep tryin' ta get a little better  
Said a little better than before  
I used ta do a little but a little wouldn't do  
So the little got more and more  
I just keep tryin' ta get a little better  
Said a little better than before  
  
We been dancin' with  
Mr. Brownstone  
He's been knockin'  
He won't leave me alone  
  
Now I get up around whenever  
I used ta get up on time  
But that old man he's a real muthafucker  
Gonna kick him on down the line
