Too many storms have passed your way  
And you're all washed out 'cause it rained on your parade  
Seems nobody cares about you anyway  
Now you're living your life like a castaway  
  
Search for strength inside was it all in vain  
Cause the deeper you dig you find more and more pain  
Don't let your tomorrow be like yesterday  
Cause I spoke to God I called out your name  
  
And on your behalf I just asked  
If He would be there for you  
  
I want you to be blessed, don't live life in distress  
Just let go let God, He'll work it out for you  
I pray that your soul will be blessed  
Forever in His hands for you deserve His best no less  
  
Enter a place where you never have to cry  
Never have to live a lie, never have to wonder why  
Never want for nothin' your always satisfied  
In the peace that His arms will provide  
  
He will erase any guilt or shame  
Any bad habits you got you won't wanna do 'em again  
Yes we all can change I can testify  
See I spoke to God, I called out your name  
  
And on your behalf I just asked  
If He would be there for you  
  
I want you to be blessed, don't live life in distress  
Just let go let God, He'll work it out for you  
I pray that your soul will be blessed  
Forever in His hands for you deserve His best no less  
  
My prayer for you today is that you trust and always obey  
On his name keep calling He'll keep you from fallin'  
He'll supply the answers  
If you stand in faith and trust Him to make a way  
  
I want you to be blessed, don't live life in distress  
Just let go let God, He'll work it out for you  
I pray that your soul will be blessed  
Forever in His hands for you deserve His best no less  
  
You've been through so much  
Be blessed from the bottom of your feet to the crown of your head  
Your life be blessed, your family be blessed  
Your finances be blessed everything about you  
Give it to Jesus, give it to Jesus
