Verse 1  
You've tried all you can  
And you don't understand why things wont turn out right  
You've tried all you know  
And still it seems so hard to comprehend  
That impossibility becomes reality  
When His voice speaks through your doubt and brings healing  
  
Chorus  
Be still and know I am God  
Be still and now I've got it all in control  
I will do a work like only I can do  
Even in your trial I will see you through  
Be still and know I am God

Tag  
Be still and know, Be still and know  
Be still and know, Be still and nkow  
  
Vamp  
I am hope, I am peace  
I am joy, I am rest  
I am your comfort, and release from your stress  
I am strength, I am faith  
I am love, I am power  
I am your freedom, this very hour  
I am
