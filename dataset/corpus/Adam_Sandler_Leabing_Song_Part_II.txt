This is a song by AFI, you guys don't have any AFI on here at all and that's
disgraceful.  
"Don't waste your touch,  
you won't feel anything  
Or were you sent to save me?  
I've thought too much,  
you won't find anything...  
Worthy of redeeming  
Yo he esta-do agui muchas veces antes y regreso To...  
break down, and cease all feeling  
Burn now, what once was breathing  
Reach out, and you may take my heart away  
Imperfect cry, and scream in ecstasy  
So what befalls the flawless?  
Look what I've built,  
it shines so beautifully  
Now watch as it destroys me  
Y regreso agui otra vez y comienzo To...  
break down, and cease all feeling  
Burn now, what once was breathing  
Reach out, and you may take my heart away  
Break down, and cease all feeling  
Burn now, what once was breathing  
Reach out, and you may take my heart away  
I left it all behind,  
and never said goodbye  
I left it all behind,  
and never said goodbye  
I left it all behind,  
and never said goodbye  
I left it all to die I saw it's birth,  
I watched it grow I felt it change me I took the life,  
I ate it slow  
Now it consumes me I...  
break down, and cease all feeling  
Burn now, what once was breathing  
Reach out, and you may take my heart away  
Break down, and cease all feeling  
Burn now, what once was breathing  
Reach out, and you may take my heart away  
...Heart away"
