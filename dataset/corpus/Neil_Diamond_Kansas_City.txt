Kansas City, Kansas City here I come  
Kansas City, Kansas City here I come  
Got some pretty little women there,  
I'm gonna get me one  
Standing on the corner,  
Twelfth Street and Vine  
Standing on the corner,  
Twelfth Street and Vine  
With my Kansas City baby now,  
Buying Kansas City wine  
Well the water in the city,  
Well, taste like Georgia Pie  
Going to Kansas City  
Where it tastes like sugar wine  
Going to Kansas City,  
Kansas City here I come  
Got some pretty little women there,  
Gonna get me one  
Kansas City,  
Yeah every night you gave me none  
Kansas City,  
Surely looked like they were done  
You know they turned it around now baby,  
Gonna scratch it, gonna run  
And rock with my baby,  
Rock with my baby, one more time  
Rock with my baby,  
Kansas City baby one more time  
One, two, three, four,  
Five, six, seven, eight, nine  
Well I might take a plane,  
Might take a train  
If I have to walk  
I will get there just the same  
Oh, Kansas City,  
Kansas City here I come  
Crazy little women there,  
I'm gonna get me one
