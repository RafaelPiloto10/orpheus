[Verse 1]  
Let's undo all the distance  
From your guards down to your buttons  
And get lost in your existence  
What you, what you, what you wanna do?  
And if you wanna get real  
And if you wanna get honest  
Then baby you know the deal  
What you wanna do?  
  
[Chorus]  
Gotta open up cause it feels much better  
When we open up for each other  
And I know  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
When you know somebody  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
And they know your body  
It's so much better  
[Verse 2]  
Show me what's under your t-shirt  
And bare it like it's your first time  
You take it off like you never  
Like you've never been hurt  
  
[Chorus]  
Open up (open up) cause it feels much better (much better)  
When we open up (open up) for each other (for each other)  
And I know  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
When you know somebody  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
And they know your body  
It's so much better  
  
[Bridge]  
So good, so good, so damn, so good  
So damn, so good, so right, so good (yeah)  
So good, so good, so damn, so good  
So damn, so good, so right, so good  
When you know somebody, when you know somebody  
When you know somebody, when you know somebody  
When you know  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, oh, oh, (oh-oh) oh, oh, oh (oh-oh)  
When you know somebody  
Oh, oh, oh, (oh-oh) oh, oh, oh (oh-oh)  
And they know your body  
Oh, oh, oh, (oh-oh) oh, oh, oh (oh-oh)  
When you know somebody  
Oh, oh, oh, (oh-oh) oh, oh, oh (oh-oh)  
And they know your body  
  
[Outro]  
Oh, get to know my body  
Better and better  
Better and better  
Damn  
It's so much better
