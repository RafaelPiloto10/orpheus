Well I been up to the mountain  
Seen the ashes down below  
I had breakfast with the wise man  
He told me what he thought I should know  
And I've been to bed with Jezebel  
And I found the well as deep  
And I'd trade in my ambitions  
For a warmer place to sleep  
  
Well I've seen the heart of darkness  
Read the writing on the wall  
And the voice out in the desert  
Was the voice out in the hall  
And once he called me Abel  
And once he called me Cain  
And for forty days and for forty nights  
I slept out in the rain  
  
Girl can you share your warm bed tonight  
I need to find a safe retreat  
Someplace where they can't see my eyes  
I need to find a warmer place to sleep  
  
Well I rested in the devils arms  
I've chased the hounds of hell  
I played truth or dare with the angels  
And as I fall as I can tell  
That a heart of gold ain't no better  
Than a heart torn from the street  
And I'd trade in my heart of stone  
For a warmer place to sleep  
  
Girl can you share your warm bed tonight  
I need to find a safe retreat  
Someplace where they can't see my eyes  
I need to find a warmer place to sleep
