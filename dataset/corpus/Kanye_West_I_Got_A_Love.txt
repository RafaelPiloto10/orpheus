Yo I was doing a show with Kanye in the West  
Mid that is so basically the Chi M.I. is up in the mix  
We in the game now it makes perfect sense  
The kid that dropped outta college the other never went  
We take turns doing our one twos and yes yes y'alls  
Look at shorty with my name tatted on her breast y'all  
Mr. West what do you think is the best?  
(take em backstage get acquainted that's what I suggest dawg)  
When it comes to spittin G I'm one of the best y'all  
She looks good smell clean and she had fresh draws  
Naw that's too good to be  
Usually them type of chicks ain't good for me no!  
I gota love that's better than you ever was  
You've never been no good for me  
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with  
2x  
I gota way with words I use words in ways  
That convince birds to come out they cage and play  
Polly want a Gucci Parka ma what did you say?  
Polly might get a cracker ain't no trickin today hey  
But anyway though she got it on smash like mashed potatoes  
High class with a ass that'll smash on J. Lo  
Lay low got play dough stash the payroll  
Ain't no credit card spendin cash on Rodeo  
And me I'm at the Slausson swap meet  
Lookin for a pair of air one's and white tee  
She want champagne I got sisco and cool-aid  
Why go to the movies let's watch the bootleg  
I gota love that's better than you ever was  
You've never been no good for me  
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with  
2x

Or wore versake (versace) y'all is too boughi  
We all know Kanye is Mr. Louis Vuitton  
But if I see a L and a V I think that it's on  
That's what my old chick used to clash with me  
(Jin why'd you get this fake Louis bag for me?)  
Actually you should be happy I purchased that  
I take this as a sign you don't want the matching hat  
Huh I'm too gutter you more Parkay with yours  
I'm more I can't believe it's not butter  
What the other suckas do for love is a damn shame  
I got a new significant other cause plans change  
I gota love that's better than you ever was  
You've never been no good for me  
I guess I was just way too hood for you to be with  
2x
