Working on the road across this great big world  
I've been rolling like a stone, I never get back home  
Yes, I've been long-gone  
And boy, I've got the Birmingham Blues.  
  
Been across the ocean to the south sea isles  
Yeah, I travelled to the east and west for mile and miles and miles  
And I've been long-gone  
And boy, I've got the Birmingham Blues.  
  
Across the world I've seen  
People and places  
Could be the same  
But with a different name.  
  
I wouldn't change the things I do for anything  
But I'd just like to hear the message of the streets again  
Give me a ticket  
'Cos boy, I've got the Birmingham Blues.  
  
It may be kind of homely but it sure is sweet  
Industrial Revolution put it on its feet  
But it's a long, long way  
Boy, I've got the Birmingham Blues.  
  
Across the world I've seen  
People and places  
Could be the same  
But with a different name.  
  
I'll go and stay awhile and all the folks I meet  
They'll say: You won't stay long, you got them travelling feet  
You'll soon be long-gone  
'Cos boy, you got the rest of the world blues.  
  
Across the world I've seen  
People and places  
Could be the same  
But with a different name.  
  
Across the world I've seen  
People and places  
Could be the same  
But with a different name.
