Ivy's got a boyfriend problem  
Ivy's got a creep  
Me, I'm working overtime  
Working on a novel in my sleep  
  
Tell it to the jury, baby  
Tell it to your mom  
Well, I think it's a whodunit, oh, but  
I don't know who done it  
  
Well, it may be an alarm clock  
But it just might be a bomb  
Nobody wants me but the law  
And I'll lay it down  
  
Yeah, I'll lay it down  
Hands across the watermelon  
Waiting on the rain  
What I've got to offer  
  
Is academic, I ain't selling  
Goodbye, close the screen door  
See you later  
Go away  
  
Nobody wants me but the law  
And I'll lay it down  
Yeah, I'll lay it down for you  
Yeah, I'll lay it down  
  
I keep turning up The Wedding Present  
You're too tired to turn me down  
Well, you're probably gonna tell me  
that this sounds a little adolescent  
  
Counting me, there's one-point-three million lonely people in this town  
Nobody wants me but the law  
And I'll lay it down  
Yeah, I'll lay it down for you  
  
Yeah, I'll lay it down for you  
Yeah, I'll lay it down for you  
Yeah, I'll lay it down
