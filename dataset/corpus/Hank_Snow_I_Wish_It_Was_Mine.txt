Somewhere a telephone is ringing right now  
Someone's old sweetheart is on the line  
She's calling to patch up an old love affair  
Oh I wish it was mine  
Somebody's writing a letter right now  
And saying Lawd oh I was blind  
Somebody's darling longs to come home  
Oh I wish it was mine  
But you never write me and you never phone  
There's somebody else on your mind  
And somebody's heart is glad you don't love me  
Oh I wish it was mine  
[ guitar ]  
But you never write me...  
(Oh I wish it was mine)
