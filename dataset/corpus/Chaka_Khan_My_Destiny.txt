I'm the ruler of my destiny - I'm determine what becomes of me!)  
(I'm the ruler of my destiny - I'm determine what becomes of me!)  
(I'm the ruler of my destiny - I'm determine what becomes of me!)  
(I'm the ruler of my destiny - I'm determine what becomes of me!)  
There's a story goin' all around  
Talking about it everywhere  
There's this gossip and this constant sound  
Livin' in the life just ain't fair  
They try to work me but it's all in vain  
They'll get this baby down  
They say I'm crazy, but that might well be,  
But there'll be no kickin' Chaka around... cause  
Chorus:  
I'm the ruler of my destiny  
If I fall then it's because of me (If I blow it it's because of me)  
There is nobody who's got the power  
To determine what becomes of me  
I'm aware of what we're here to do  
And, do is our only choice  
And if you like it'll be me and you,  
Singing with this one strong voice:  
  
This is bigger than the both of us  
I'm not afraid to walk that line  
Just be natural and we can try  
Every little thing's gonna turn out fine... cause  
Repeat chorus  
Vamp to end
