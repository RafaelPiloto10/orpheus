There's a long and winding road that we have traveled  
And the prize that waits for all who will prevail  
There's a place for those who stand up tall in battle  
Up against all odds determined not to fail  
  
And when the moment comes you know that you'll be ready  
To push yourself beyond where you have gone before  
So write your name beside the very best in history  
And take a bow before the crowd and hear them roar  
Anything you can do this is from me to you  
  
Just keep dreamin' keep on dreamin'  
And if you really believe in time  
You will make your dreams come true  
Just keep dreamin' don't stop dreamin'  
'Cause no one else can live your dream but you  
  
So you rise above each hurdle you encounter  
  
Let no obstacle before you slow your speed  
For you possess a will to win that burns intensely  
And win you will yes this will be your creed  
  
And when the moment comes you know that you'll be ready  
To push yourself much harder than you have done before  
So write your name beside the very best in history  
And take a bow before the crowd and hear them roar  
  
Anything you can do this is from me to you  
  
Just keep dreamin' keep on dreamin'  
And if you really believe in time  
You will make your dreams come true  
Just keep dreamin' don't stop dreamin'  
'Cause no one else can live your dream but you  
  
(Usher)  
And in the end with no regret  
And in the end with no regret  
You're given your all and nothin' less  
You're given your all and nothin 'less  
You know you've been the best that you can be  
You know you've been the best that you can be  
No one can say you didn't try  
No one can say you didn't try  
Go on and wave your banner high  
Go on and wave your banner high  
And savor that sweet taste of victory  
And savor that sweet taste of victory  
  
Dreamin' keep on dreamin'  
Dreamin 'keep on dreamin'  
And if you really believe in time  
You will make your dreams come true  
You will make your dreams come true  
Just keep dreamin' don't stop dreamin'  
'Cause no one else can live your dream but you  
'Cause no one else can live your dream but you  
Just go ahead and live the dream  
  
Anything in life can happen  
If you give your best in all you do  
If you give your best in all you do  
Ain't no limit for those who want it  
Ain't no limit for those who want it  
Take a chance and let it all come true  
Take a chance and let it all come true  
Shake your fears and hold your head high  
Shake your fears and hold your head high  
You can make it if you really try  
You can make it if you really try  
'Cause no one else can live your dream but you  
  
Dreamin' keep on dreamin'  
And if you really believe in time  
You will make your dreams come true  
You will make your dreams come true  
Just keep dreamin' keep on dreamin'  
'Cause no one else can live your dream but you
