Who is the girl with the crying face looking at millions of signs?  
She knows that life is a running race,  
Her face shouldn't show any line.  
  
Melody Fair won't you comb your hair?  
You can be beautiful too.  
Melody Fair, remember you're only a woman.  
Melody Fair, remember you're only a girl.  
  
Who is the girl at the window pane,  
Watching the rain falling down?  
Melody, life isn't like the rain  
Its just like a merry go round.  
  
Melody Fair won't you comb your hair?  
You can be beautiful too.  
Melody Fair,  
Remember you're only a woman.  
Melody Fair,  
Remember you're only a girl.
