(You gotta keep'em separated)  
  
You like the latest fashions  
You'd like to keep'em clean  
You take a trip every week to the laundromat  
Throw a load in the washing machine  
  
But if you don't wanna ruin your clothes  
You gotta sort'em out first as everyone knows  
Remember bright colors and the other don't mix  
Before you wash'em up, wash'em up, wash'em up, wash'em up...  
Hey!!!  
  
Are your undies turning pink?  
Take'em out! (You gotta keep'em separated)  
Hey-ay... Are your cottons gonna shrink?  
Sort'em out! (You gotta keep'em separated)  
  
Hey-ay, then when it's time  
You can stick'em in the dryeryou can hang'em on a li-e-ine  
Hey-ay! It's Laundry Day!
