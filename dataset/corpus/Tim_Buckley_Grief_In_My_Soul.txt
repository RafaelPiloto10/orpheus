I've got ten thousand troubles, a million woes  
Got grief in my soul nobody knows  
I've got heartaches, I got stingin' water fallin' out of the sky  
I've got heartbreaks, I got a long lost lover, got a reason to die  
I got ten thousand troubles, a million woes  
I got grief in my soul nobody knows  
I got sorrow, I'm in a storm that'll spare no travelin' man  
I fear tomorrow, got a love that died long before it began  
I got ten thousand troubles, a million woes  
Got grief in my soul nobody knows  
I got ten thousand troubles, a million woes  
Got grief in my soul nobody knows  
I've got a cold chain, I got rain fallin' on my head from above  
I've got a bad pain, I got a gal don't know the meaning of love  
I got ten thousand troubles, a million woes  
I got grief in my soul nobody knows  
I've got heartaches, I got stingin' water fallin' out of the sky  
I've got heartbreaks, I got a long lost lover, got a reason to die  
I got ten thousand troubles, a million woes  
I got grief in my soul nobody knows
