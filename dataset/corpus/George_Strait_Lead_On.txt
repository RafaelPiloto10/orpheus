She said I don't recall  
Seeing you around here  
You must be new to this town  
Said, I'm just passin through  
But, girl from the looks of you I  
Could see me settling down  
  
The she smiled and said the invitations open  
Cause you look just like what I've been waiting on.  
So I said why don't we take  
This matter somewhere else  
And get to know this feeling that's so strong  
Lead on  
  
She said, I had a love once  
But he just up and left me  
I said I bet it broke your heart  
I had a love once to but  
I acted like a fool  
Oh what I'd give to be back in her arms  
  
Then she smiled and said the invitations open  
Cause you look just like what I've been waiting on.  
So I said why don't we take  
This matter somewhere else  
And pick up right where everything went wrong  
Lead on  
  
She said I don't recall  
Seeing you around here  
You must be new to this town
