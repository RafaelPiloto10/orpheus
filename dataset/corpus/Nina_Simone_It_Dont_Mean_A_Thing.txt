Don't mean a thing, you can't swing  
Dooa, doa doa, doa doa, doaa  
Well, it don't mean a thing, all you gotta do is sing  
Dooa, doa doa, doa doa, doaa  
Makes no difference if it's sweet or hot  
Give that rhythm everything you've got  
Don't mean a thing, all you gotta do is swing  
Dooa, doa doa, doaa  
It don't mean a thing, if you ain't got that swing  
Don't mean a thing, all you gotta do is sing  
Makes no difference if it's sweet or hot  
It don't mean a thing, no, it don't mean a thing  
Don't mean a thing, if you ain't got that swing  
Yeah, doa, oh, doa, oh doa, oh yeah  
Don't mean a thing, gotta do is swing  
Well, doa, oh doa, oh doa, doa doa  
Makes no difference if it's sweet or hot  
Give that rhythm everything you've got  
Don't mean a thing if you can't swing  
Don't mean a thing if you can't sing  
Sing your song, all day long  
All the time, right on time  
Every day, every way  
Makes no difference, sweet or hot  
Give that song, all you got, sing it, sing it  
Doa, doa, oh yeah, doa, alright, oh yeah  
Sing the song, all day long  
Doaa, oh yeah, doaa, oh yeah
