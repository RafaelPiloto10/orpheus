There he, sitting in the moonlight  
Not found, livin no city  
He smile, mucho in a sunshine  
High life, counting de fruit bat  
  
Troppo, gone troppo, troppo  
It's time you know I gone troppo  
  
Plant me, in de Helicona  
No thank, meeting de peoples  
Wake me, eata the papaya  
Much hot, not much on the body  
  
Troppo, gone troppo, gone troppo  
It's time you know I gone troppo  
  
Warm sea, see right to the bottom  
No like, shoveling snowfall  
Good time, drinking on me bottle  
The high wide Moreton Bay Fig  
  
Troppo, gone troppo, troppo  
It's time you know I gone troppo  
  
Quite like, you ain't seen a sunset  
Could be, living in Rain hill  
Sun hot, you don't go to a backache  
Brown skin and very a peeling  
  
Troppo, gone troppo, gone troppo  
It's time you know I gone troppo
