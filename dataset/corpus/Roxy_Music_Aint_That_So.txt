I've been around  
So far it seems  
Too bad the blues  
Blew my schemes  
Dynamite  
  
Such sweet surprise  
In southern heat  
Or northern skies  
Ain't that so  
Shadows cling  
Where shutters close  
  
Who can tell  
Heaven knows  
Why some can laugh  
And some can sing  
Stand in line  
Or get on down and swing  
Ain't that so  
Cross the street  
who's ringing bells?  
  
Peeling walls  
Of cheap hotels  
Neon flare  
A sudden chill  
And there you lie  
And time stands still  
Ain't that so
