The first time I met her  
She walked right up to me and said you're who I've wanted to find.  
There was a man she had seen in her dreams and it was me.  
She said I can't believe it cause I've never been in here  
And I've passed this so many times.  
It was her night to find destiny and it was Me  
  
And we danced every song that they played, and talked until closing time  
The closer I held her, the more I knew her destiny wasn't that far from mine.  
Then I saw a reflection of someone unfamiliar looking back when I looked in
her eyes  
The happiest man I'd ever seen and it was me  
  
And we danced every song that they played and talked until closing time.  
The closer I held her, the more I knew her destiny wasn't that far from mine.  
She wasn't looking and I wasn't looking,  
Ain't it funny? Thats when love was found.  
She still calls it her lucky night,  
Yes someone was lucky she's right  
But it was me.  
It was me  
It was me
