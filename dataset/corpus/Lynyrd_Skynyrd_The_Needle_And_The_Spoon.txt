Thirty days, Lord, and thirty nights  
I'm coming home on an airplane flight  
Mama waiting at the ticket line  
Tell me son, why do you stand there cryin'?  
  
It was the needle and the spoon  
And a trip to the moon  
Took me away  
Took me away  
  
I've been feeling so sick inside  
Got to get better, Lord, before I die  
Some doctors couldn't help my head, they said  
You'd better quit, son, before you're dead  
  
Quit the needle, quit the spoon  
Quit the trip to the moon  
They gonna take you away  
Lord, they gonna take you away  
  
It was the needle and the spoon  
  
I've seen a lot of people who thought they were cool  
But then again, Lord, I've seen a lot of fools  
I hope you people, Lord, can hear what I say  
You'll have your chance to hit it some day  
  
Don't mess with a needle or a spoon  
Or a trip to the moon  
They'll take you away  
  
Lord, their gonna bury you boy  
Don't mess with the needle  
Now I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
