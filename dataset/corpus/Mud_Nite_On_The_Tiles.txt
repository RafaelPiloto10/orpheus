I couldn't wait, she came in late,  
She wasn't there, I didn't care.  
I'm sinking low, where can I go?  
Has no one goit a bed to share?  
  
I spent a night on the tiles.  
A night on the tiles.  
  
Here comes the day, what can I say,  
She really knows that I've been cheating.  
The night was long, she came on strong,  
It's morning that we'll soon be greeting.  
  
I spent a night on the tiles.  
A night on the tiles.  
  
If only I could lay with you by me,  
I'd never leave your side again.  
You'd make me feel a man and then...  
  
She left for good, I knew she would.  
There's nothing for me here at all.  
Why did she go, I'll never know,  
How come she had to be so cruel.  
  
I spent a night on the tiles.  
A night on the tiles.
