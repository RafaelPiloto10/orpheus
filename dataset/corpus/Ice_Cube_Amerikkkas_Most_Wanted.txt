Ice Cube with The Lench Mob I got it goin' on  
A nigga that's livin' in the city of the criminal zone  
One time can't keep the law in order  
'cause everybody's goin' crazy for a quarter  
You're tuned in to the number one crew in the area  
The way I'm talkin I'm scarin' ya  
I'm darin ya to raise hell and bail and brag and sag  
or beat down for ya flag  
'cause if you is or you ain't a gang banger  
Keep one in the chamber  
'cause you'll get them things put on ya son  
Ice Cube has got the 4-1-1  
All the ol' school house fellows are crooks  
So I get jealous looks  
They keep thinkin' did my hair grow?  
Will the boys 'n' the hood have to beat down Ice Cube?  
Hell no, I'll static son, you'll see it's okay  
I keep my 9 anyway  
for the day one of my homies want to squab  
I'm still rollin wit The Lench Mob  
  
(AmeriKKKa's most wanted)  
  
Back in the day I dip my shirt in dirt  
Sometimes I got away clean, sometimes people got hurt  
But if you know me, you know that I'm liable  
to bust a cap 'cause it's all about survival of the fittest  
I'm a menace crook  
I did so much dirt I need to be in the Guinness Book  
From the shit I took from people  
I reap all your fat shit, jack  
Back to the criminals sect  
I leave crew after crew but they can't catch me yet  
'cause I'm slick as slippery  
They can't get wit me, cops ain't shit to me  
I can't dig a pig so I drop the dogs  
and sweat em like sweat hogs  
and get mad, mad 'cause I'm the nigga that flaunt it  
AmeriKKKa's most wanted  
  
Hey yo, here's what the poster read:  
'Ice Cube is wanted dead'  
That's all it said  
I put heads to bed and fled the scene wit all the green  
Hear shots and si-reens  
When I feet first they yo' rings, now they my rings  
So give it up punk and then I just  
put another jack in progress  
It's the American way  
'cause I'm the G-A-N-G-S-T-A  
Ice Cube, a motherfuckin' clepto'  
and tried to catch the early bird but they slept, so  
who gets the worm?  
And if I'm caught in a trap  
you know I'ma beat the wack  
with a payoff, cop gotta lay off  
FBI on my dick, stay off!  
I'm not a rebel or a renegade on a quest  
I'm a nigga with a 'S' on his chest  
so get the Kryptonite 'cause I'm a rip tonight  
'cause I'm scarin' ya, wanted by America  
  
(Hey yo Cube man, they on your ass)  
  
Word, but who the fuck has heard?  
It's time to take a trip to the suburbs  
Let em see a nigga invasion  
Point blank for the Caucasian  
Cock the hammer then crackle, smile  
Take me to your house, pal  
Got to the house, my pockets got fat, see  
Crack the safe, got the money and the jewelry  
Three weeks later, I'm at the P-A-D  
Had a little fly ass bitch wit me  
Sittin' in a dig, yo it couldn't be  
(What up G?) Saw my face on TV  
Damn (oh shit!) I didn't know I lucked out  
Struck out, I gotta get the fuck out  
Pack my bags and tried to hit the dough when  
the ol' bitch down the street must've turned me in  
'cause the feds was out there ten deep  
I got hassled and gaffled in the back seat  
I think back when I was robbin' my own kind  
The police didn't pay it no mind  
But when I start robbin' the white folks  
Now I'm in the pen wit the soap-on-a-rope  
I said it before and I'll still taught it  
Every motherfucker with a color is most wanted
