English trees in my garden  
We planted seeds in a faraway land  
In between the palms and the succulent grove  
  
They lose their leaves in the winter  
Mark the seasons for him and for her  
Once upon a time in the fallen snow  
Up against the sky made a silhouette show  
  
England cries and she plays for him  
The chords entwined like a requiem  
Although it's springtime and color is new  
In Regent's Park I will mourn for you  
  
And I must be wise somehow  
'Cause my heart's been broken down  
  
It's so far to fall  
And so hard to climb  
Nothing's sadder, I know  
Than the passing of time  
  
Won't forget me  
You won't forget me  
  
English trees in my garden  
Summer's missed you, my darling  
Yet all your crimes are forgiven  
Yet all your crimes are forgiven  
And I must be wise somehow  
  
And England cries, oh  
There's English trees in my garden
