Lead-in with haunting:  
There's always someone,  
Haunting someone, haunting someone,  
I can't sleep easy,  
Cause I'm afraid of dreaming  
And then the memory of the dream  
There's always someone,  
Haunting someone, haunting someone  
  
Laura is the face in the misty night  
Footsteps that you hear down the hall  
The laugh that floats on a summer's night  
That you might never quite recall  
And you see Laura on a train  
That is passing through  
Those eyes how familiar they seem  
She gave your very first kiss to you  
That was Laura but she's only a dream  
  
She gave your very first kiss to you  
That was Laura  
But she's only a dream  
  
Yes she gave your very first kiss to you  
That was Laura, but she's only a dream  
A dream, a dream
