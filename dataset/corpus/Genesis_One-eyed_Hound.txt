Mister you've been caught at last chasing dogs in moonlight  
This man committed a sin  
This man he never can win  
And it's all gone wrong  
Night is the time for chasing the one eyed hound  
And it's all been tried before  
Night is the time for chasing the one eyed hound  
Have you seen the one eyed hound ?  
Tell me where he's going  
This man committed a sin  
This man he never can win  
Every place that I have been, no-one else has seen him  
This man committed a sin  
This man he never can win  
And it's all gone wrong  
Night is the time for chasing the one eyed hound  
And it's all been tried before  
Night is the time for chasing the one eyed hound  
Everybody's telling me exactly where to go  
This man committed a sin  
This man he never can win  
People come and people talk but they don't reach agreement  
This man committed a sin  
This man he never can win  
And it's all gone wrong  
Night is the time for chasing the one eyed hound  
And it's all been tried before  
Night is the time for chasing the one eyed hound
