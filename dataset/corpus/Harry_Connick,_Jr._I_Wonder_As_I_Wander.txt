I wonder as I wander, out under the sky  
How Jesus the savior, did come to die  
To save lowly people like you and like I  
I wonder as I wander, out under the sky  
  
Sweet Mary laid Jesus, within a cow's stall  
Came wise men and farmers and shepherds and all  
The blessings of Christmas heaven did fall  
And God's promise of ages, to them did recall  
  
If Jesus had wanted for any small thing  
A cloud in the sky or a bird on the wing  
Or all of God's angels in heaven to sing  
He surely could have had it, because  
He was the King  
Because He was King!
