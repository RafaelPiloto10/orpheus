Sweeping low over an ocean deep  
Rousing up a mighty monster from his sleep  
we're walking in the air  
we're dancing in the midnight sky  
  
We're walking in the air  
We're floating in a moonlit sky  
The people far below  
Are sleeping as we fly  
I'm holding very tight  
I'm riding on the midnight blue  
I'm finding I can fly so high above with you  
  
Free as we can be  
Above the sleeping world  
As far as I can see  
(All is a dream)  
  
All across the world  
The villages go by like dreams  
The rivers and the hills  
The forests and the streams  
  
Children gaze  
Open mouthed  
Taken by surprise  
Nobody  
Down below  
Believes  
Their eyes  
  
We're surfing in the air  
We're swimming in a frozen sky  
We're drifting over ice  
and mountains floating by  
  
Free as we can be  
Above the sleeping world  
As far as I can see  
All is a dream  
  
We're walking in the air  
(walking in the air)  
We're dancing in the midnight sky  
(dancing in the sky)  
  
And everyone who sees us  
Greets us as we fly  
We're walking in the air  
Walkin in the air  
  
We're walking in the air  
Walkin in the air  
We're walking in the air  
We're walking in the air
