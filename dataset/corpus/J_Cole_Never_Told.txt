Yeah, hey, wassup girl  
Hey, yeah, uh  
  
Uh, angel eyes, long hair  
I see you cryin', what's wrong there  
He did what? He fucked who?  
We know the story, what's new?  
See I could probably, rush you  
Tell you that he should have loved you  
Take advantage, fuck you  
Tell you I'll do all the shit he wouldn't do  
But the truth is, we all the same  
On different teams, but it's all a game  
The objective, tryna score  
You got a wife, you find a whore  
You fuck her fast, she find her drawers  
Pull up her pants, you find the door  
You drive her home, she mop you off  
You bust again, and drop her off  
Then repeat like an episode  
Why we cheat? I'll never know  
Is it cause we rap? Heavens no  
Lotta niggas rap though, never blow  
A heterosexual, girl you fine, from head to toe  
Could it be cause my father let me know  
That he cheated, and somehow I never told  
I never told  
  
"Hey, you wanna be a man?  
Yeah I wanna be a man.  
A man don't run tellin' mama everything he see.  
I ain't gonna tell.  
Alright then man. You're a man now.  
Okay."  
  
OK, that's what it is, I see the game  
The hoes come, the seasons change  
The hoes go, we rearrange  
Fuck up her life, she'll never be the same  
The old G's that beat the game  
Forever young, Peter Pan  
Thirty five, still playin', child support, still payin'  
Jugglin', bill payin'  
Been runnin' round, field dayin'  
Wine and dine, meal payin'  
With hopes that she'll land  
The bed and, get wet then, give head then  
You bet man, the same girl who said we just met man  
Game colder than the fuckin' dead man  
One night stands, no best man  
No bridesmaids, or reverends  
Cause Wolverine's depressin', don't wanna be your ex man  
Cause cupid aims and throw the darts  
There go the sparks and broken hearts  
Who wanna build Noah's Ark  
Just to have that shit torn apart  
  
"You know what? I need to talk to you.  
About what?  
I don't think this is, working out for us.  
Why?  
I mean, I need some space. I mean no, I just wanna find myself, that's all.  
What the fuck?!"
