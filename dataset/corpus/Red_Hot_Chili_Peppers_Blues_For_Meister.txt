It's always half and half  
I'm happy and I'm sad  
Everything that's beautiful  
Always kills me too  
The highest I get up  
Is the deepest I get down  
You're up there with your life  
That's why I gotta shout, shout,  
... And then gotta shout, shout  
  
Blues for Meister  
You sweet little thing  
Blues for Meister  
I'm so sad I gotta sing  
A cozy little kitty up  
Sittin' on the couch  
Oh, kitty cat, oh, baby  
I really miss you now  
Well have some respect  
For my cat  
He got squashed by the wheel  
Of a Cadillac  
Well, me and my pussy  
We lost our flow  
Well, goodbye my little calico  
  
Your food's still in the cupboard  
Hangin' in it's can  
You used to love to eat it  
Down  
I'll always love you Meister  
You were so good to me  
There's nothing like you nowhere  
As far as I can see  
  
Blues for Meister  
You sweet little thing  
Blues for Meister  
I'm so sad I gotta sing  
A cozy little kitty up  
Sittin' on the couch  
Oh, kitty cat, oh, baby  
I really miss you now  
Well have some respect  
For my cat  
He got squashed by the wheel  
Of a Cadillac  
Well, me and my pussy  
We lost our flow  
Well, goodbye my little calico
