Jerry says that in the dark,  
I think I have a good idea.  
That I should do the opposite,  
  
Of whatever it is I feel  
That's because I have a bad mind  
And I have gold in my veins  
But he said I got the purest heart  
That he's ever seen  
  
What God gave me a brain for  
If he won't let me use it?  
What God give me a plan for  
If He won't help me do it?  
You're gonna love me  
I'm gonna make you  
You're gonna love me  
I'm gonna make you  
  
I can tell that you're the type  
To never trust a beauty queen  
But I was never voted for nothing and,  
Highschool never meant anything to anybody  
Never ever gave myself away  
But even when I'm funny  
You think I'm acting so I say  
  
What God give me a break for  
If he won't let me use it?  
What God give me a plan for?  
He never helps me do it  
You're gonna love me  
I'm gonna make you  
You're gonna love me  
I'm gonna make you  
  
You say that you don't want to be hypnotized  
But baby, I, I don't wanna hypnotize you  
There's nothing from you that I wanna take  
I just wanna be like you  
Maybe love you just a little bit  
Please  
  
Tell 'em mom and daddy gave themselves,  
I won't to you  
You told me to get my ways as I do what I'm gonna do  
I'm gonna strike out, right now  
I'm striking out right now with this song  
But I can't help myself  
I can't do right for long  
  
What God give me a break for  
If he won't let me use it?  
What God give me a Wlan for?  
He never helps me do it  
You're gonna love me  
I'm gonna make you  
You're gonna love me  
I'm gonna make you
