I'd like to say that I tried  
It fits in with all the suggestions and lies and empty tables  
With food untouched,  
I couldn't see the future.  
I liked the past too much  
I've been going door to door like I got something to sell,  
Wandering like a fool  
Through the halls of a blue hotel.  
  
So go on and rain down on us  
Go on and rain  
Go on and rain down on us  
I give up, I give up.  
  
Something about her that's cold.  
She's blowing through the trees,  
Leaving me raw  
As the words come out,  
I get confused.  
I get shattered like a light bulb in an October moon.  
She's inside me like a secret  
And I got no one to tell.  
Wandering like a fool  
Through the halls of a blue hotel.  
  
Go on and rain down on us  
Go on and rain  
Go on and rain down on us  
I give up.  
I give up.
