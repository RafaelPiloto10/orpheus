If I were you, I wouldn't waste my time  
You can't answer all the questions in your mind  
Love is love and you can't make it right  
It's one of the mysteries of life  
  
(Chorus)  
How can you know love when no one ever knew  
It's the mother of all happiness and father of the blues  
Love puts sunshine in your days, then steals your sleep at night  
It's one of the mysteries of life  
  
Maybe you should take it day by day  
If you hold love too loosely, it will fly away  
If you hold love too tightly, it will die  
It's one of the mysteries of life  
  
(Chorus)
