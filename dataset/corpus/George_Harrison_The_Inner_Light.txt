Without going out of my door,  
I can know all things on earth  
without looking out of my window,  
I can know the ways of heaven.  
The farther one travels  
the less one knows  
the less one really knows.  
Without going out of your door,  
You can know all things on earth  
without looking out of your window,  
you can know the ways of heaven.  
The farther one travels  
the less one knows  
the less one really knows.  
Arrive without travelling,  
See all without looking,  
Do all without doing.
