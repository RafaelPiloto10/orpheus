Well, I feel like I'm runnin'  
Down that dead end road  
Yes, I feel like I'm runnin'  
Down that dead end road  
I need someone to tell me  
Which way I ought to go?  
  
Say goodbye to the mornin'  
Hello evenin' time  
Say goodbye to the mornin'  
Down that road I'm plyin'  
If I look way beyond me  
I'll be gettin' way behind  
  
I can't seem to catch up  
Distance keeps fallin' away  
Can't seem to catch up  
Distance keeps fallin' away  
Makes no difference where I go  
Dead end road everyday  
  
Lord, I feel like I'm runnin'  
Down that dead end road  
Well, I feel like I'm runnin'  
Down that dead end road  
I need someone to tell me  
Which way I ought to go?
