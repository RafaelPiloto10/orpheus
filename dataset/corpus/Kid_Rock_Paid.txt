Oooooooo Yeahhhhhh  
And while your out gang bangin  
Tring to catch a murder case  
Your hoes on my couch gettin fucked in the face  
  
Bumpin to the base of some old school rap jam  
This ain't tennis, but yo I'll use my backhand  
On any grown man that tries to check rock  
I want to head bang, I gotta hip hop  
  
'Cause I'm gonna stick with what got me paid  
Lickin that coochie with the high top fade  
I'm self made like Henry Ford  
I'm on this mic but it feels like I been here before  
  
I want more than the next man  
Respect, plus to cash big checks  
And mack on hoes like Ruddy Ray  
'Cause the reach around just sounds so gay  
  
I don't even swing that way  
I told you hoes before I'm the K  
I to the D are O see K'n, rhymes sayin, guitar playin  
Turntable spinnin at a basement jam  
  
No fame, no money, but you wouldn't understand  
What it's like to be so real  
You got the beats and the rhymes, but you ain't got no feel  
I don't need the fancy music to make mine  
  
Just the beat and the funky ass base line  
Drop a couple cuts on the track  
A tracks to the mother fuckin wack  
So while your making record that don't recoup  
I'm in the house gettin paid like Snoop  
  
Kid Rock an' I got all the hoes sayin'  
Fuck me baby, Kid Rock come fuck me baby  
Fuck me baby, fuck me baby all night long  
Fuck me baby, Kid Rock come fuck me baby  
Fuck me baby, fuck me 'till the break of dawn  
  
I want my khakis washed, starched, and creased  
I want an order of fries with a side of grease  
I wish for peace throughout this land  
I want the whole fuckin world in my hands  
  
I want a band like the US Funk Mob  
See I can rap I don't hafta lay sod, just to make ends meet  
October 31st yellin Trick-or-Treat  
Boy aren't you a little old to be trickin  
  
You see my mask and bag bitch, I ain't bullshittin  
Hittin homeruns like Rusty Staub  
I'm kinda anal, cause I ain't no fuckin slob  
I'm the cradle that's able to rock any format  
  
But still I'm labeled and treated like a doormat  
Where's the whores at?  
Westside hoes like cars, so I ride em for a test drive  
I'm like a pringle, I won't go soft  
  
I got a new jingle, I'm about to go off  
Hey ho, check it out, I really like to turn you out  
And if you be good to me,  
I'll yoodle in your valley  
  
Kid Rock ain't nothing nice  
Got the salt and pork boomin with the beans and rice  
Got a head full of lice cause I'm such a scum  
Got a pocket full of money, but I'm dressed like a bum  
  
Got a business mind, so if I loose the funk,  
I'll still be in the house gettin paid like trump  
Kid Rock and I got all the hoes sayin'  
Fuck me baby, Kid Rock come fuck me baby  
  
Fuck me baby, fuck me baby all night long  
Fuck me baby, Kid Rock come fuck me baby  
Fuck me baby, fuck me til the break of dawn  
Come on, come on, come on  
  
Oooooooohhhhhh Yeahhhh  
Fuck me baby... let it ride, let it ride  
Fuck me baby come on, come on... somebody  
Fuck me baby... oh yeah  
Love me baby... oh yeah  
  
Come on yeah, all night long  
Baby, come on, fuck me baby  
  
Come on and do me daddy all night long  
Come on and do me daddy all night long  
Come on and do me daddy all night long  
Come on and do me daddy all night long
