I hate to see night shadows fall, I hate to see a moon above  
For it brings me dreams of days gone by  
When my darling Lola Lee strolled along the shore with me  
And we watched the golden river glide on by.  
  
[Chorus]  
Golden river, golden river, you took my love from me  
On your waves of golden hue, you carried her with you  
And broke my heart a million, million ways.  
  
Now I sit and wonder why I feel so blue and want to cry  
While I watch the moon climb slowly in the sky.  
It was on a night like this when she gave me her last kiss  
Climbed in her birch canoe and sailed away.  
  
[Chorus]
