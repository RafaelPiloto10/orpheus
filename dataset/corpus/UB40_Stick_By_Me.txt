Stick by me and I'll stick by you  
Stick by me and I'll stick by you  
  
My life here on earth would be useless can't you see  
If I didn't have you to stick by me  
I love you darling and that's no lie  
Stick by me and I'll stick by you  
When you cry I cry too  
Stick by me and I'll stick by you  
  
Friends may try to hurt us  
Scandalise our name  
But no one (no-one) can tear us apart  
You have a place in my heart  
  
I love you darling and that's no lie  
Stick by me and I'll stick by you  
Remember my heart and love belongs to you  
Stick by me and I'll stick by you  
When you cry I'll cry too  
Stick by me and I'll stick by you
