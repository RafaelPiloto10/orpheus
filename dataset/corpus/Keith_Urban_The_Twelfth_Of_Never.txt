THE TWELFTH OF NEVER  
WITH DOLLY PARTON  
WRITERS JERRY LIVINGSTON, PAUL FRANCIS WEBSTER  
  
You ask me how much I need you, must I explain? I need you, oh my darling,
like roses need rain You ask how long I'll love you, I'll tell you true Until
the Twelfth of Never, I'll still be loving you Hold me close, never let me go
Hold me close, melt my heart like April snow I'll love you 'til the bluebells
forget to bloom I'll love you 'til the clover has lost it's perfume I'll love
you 'til the poets run out of rhyme Until the Twelfth of Never and that's a
long, long time Until the Twelfth of Never and that's a long, long time
