Open the door, open the door  
I'm just a step, step away from your heart  
Open the door and baby let me in  
Yes open the door, then close it back again  
Open the door, well baby let me in  
I'm just a step, step away from your heart  
Open the door, you set my heart a-flame  
Yes open the door, I'll never be the same  
Open the door, to win you is my aim  
I'm just a step, step away from your heart  
Oh baby you knew, you knew I'd follow you  
No matter how far  
Well-well-well, if you don't say you love me baby  
Gal, my lovin's not up to part  
Open the door, and baby let me in  
Yes open the door, then close it back again  
Open the door, well baby let me in  
I'm just a step, step away from your heart  
(Oh won't you open up that everlovin' door)
