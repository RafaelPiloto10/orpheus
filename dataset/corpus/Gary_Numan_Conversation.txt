Oh it's so easy  
When parts take over  
My conversation  
Is nothing more than lies  
  
You're just the viewer  
So cold and distant  
I've no intentions  
Of saying I love you  
  
My conversation  
  
We are not gods  
We are not men  
We are not making claims  
We are only boys  
  
You are not strong  
You are not force  
You are not regular  
You are just wrong  
  
There are no faces  
This is my complex  
You are my picture  
I call you 'mirrors'  
  
These are not my tears  
Not my reflection  
Am I a photo?  
I can't remember  
  
My conversation
