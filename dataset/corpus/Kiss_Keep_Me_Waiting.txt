Look what you're doing, I'm losing my mind  
My head's in a ruin, leaving me behind  
It hurts to believe you could treat me so cruel  
Pick me up, put me down, make me look like a fool  
  
Keep me waiting  
Keep me waiting  
Keep me waiting  
Keep me waiting  
  
Look what you're doing, I'm losing this time  
I thought you were true and I see I was blind  
It hurts to believe you could treat me so cruel  
Pick me up, put me down, make me look like a fool  
  
Keep me waiting  
Keep me waiting  
Keep me waiting  
Keep me waiting  
  
It doesn't matter what you do or say  
I know goodbye is coming any day  
It doesn't matter what you do or say  
I know goodbye is coming any day  
It doesn't matter what you do or say  
I know goodbye is coming any day  
  
Keep me waiting  
Keep me waiting  
Keep me waiting  
Keep me waiting  
  
Keep me waiting, waiting, waiting  
Keep me waiting, waiting, waiting  
Keep me waiting, waiting, waiting  
Keep me waiting, waiting, waiting  
  
Keep me waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting  
Keep me waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting  
Keep me waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting  
Keep me waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting  
  
Keep me waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting  
Keep me waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting  
Keep me waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting  
Keep me waiting, waiting, waiting
