One love in my young life  
Took me somewhere I had never been  
And I want to live again  
Breathe again in the shelter of his  
Brightly-woven love song  
So long, I have wanted love to be  
Sitting just this near to me  
Now my waiting heart is free  
  
[Chorus:]  
Few are the choices we are given  
(Few are the choices we are given)  
The hands of time passed quickly by  
  
One dream of my young life  
Now stands holding out his hand to me  
Now I can't help but believe  
That my whole life will be  
Spent in one love  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
One dream of my young life  
Now stands holding out his hand to me  
Now I can't help but believe  
That my whole life will be  
Spent in one love  
(Spent in one love)  
Spent in one love
