I've got a crazy little mama  
Lord, she's my heart and soul  
I don't even have to tell ya  
she knows how to rock and roll  
  
well this crazy lovin' mama  
makin' everything all right  
I don't even have to tell ya  
she makes things seem outta sight  
all right  
  
whenever I'm down  
and nothings going right at all  
I just think about my baby  
and all I've got to do is call  
  
when the evening's looking pretty  
and the day's hanging out too long  
I know my baby cares about me  
right or wrong  
  
it took a long time to find her  
it took a lot of laughs and tears  
it took a long time to find her  
it took me 22 years  
  
I've got a crazy little mama  
said, Lord, she's my heart and soul  
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
I don't even have to tell ya  
she know's how to rock and roll  
  
well this crazy lovin' mama  
makin' everything all right  
yeah  
I don't even have to tell ya  
she makes things seem outta sight  
all right  
  
it took a long time to find her  
it took a lot of laughs and tears  
it took a long time to find her  
it took me 22 years  
oh my  
  
22 years  
22 years  
22 years  
22 years  
22 years  
22 years  
22 years
