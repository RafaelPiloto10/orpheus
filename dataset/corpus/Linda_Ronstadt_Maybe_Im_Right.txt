Maybe he's right  
Maybe I'm wrong  
Maybe what I'm saying is the way it should be  
Nobody knows when the truth goes by  
But everyone tells me that he's happy  
Maybe he's gone and found some love  
I want to see it for myself  
Everyone says just to let him alone  
But I can't even sleep no more it worries me so  
Why  
Why  
Maybe I'm right  
Maybe he's wrong  
And maybe what he's saying is the way it should be  
Somebody tried to explain it to me  
But they couldn't tell me if he's happy  
And I just want to know if he's still happy
