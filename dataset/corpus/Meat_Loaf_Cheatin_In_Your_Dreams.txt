You see me now as large as life, but underneath you knew all too well  
The hollow shell, no spark of life  
Where once upon a time there beat a heart  
For you and you knew it from the start, and you went and blew it all away  
And you knew how, oh you knew best  
The strings to pull and buttons to press  
To wind me up and make me shake, you controlling every move I made  
I couldn't see through it, all the pain, and you put me through it  
Over and over again, just tell me over and over and over  
  
[Chorus]  
How could you say there was no other, why is it nothing's what it seems  
You told me I'm your greatest lover, do you even know what that word means  
Your lovin' is coolin', baby who ya think you're foolin'  
'cause when I woke up I caught you cheatin' in your dreams  
  
When I woke up I caught you cheatin' in your dreams  
  
Stop it! Stop it! Don't you say a word  
I feel my hands around her neck and everything went blurred  
Broken, broken, she slipped from out my hands  
She lay so still and lifeless, I cried baby, baby, baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Cheatin', cheatin', cheatin' in your dreams)  
  
(Cheatin', cheatin', cheatin' in your dreams)  
  
It was my dumb luck, I just came unstuck  
My whole world shook, I'd had about enough  
When I woke up, I caught you cheatin' in your dreams  
  
(Cheatin', cheatin', cheatin' in your dreams)
