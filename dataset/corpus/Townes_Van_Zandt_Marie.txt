I stood in line and left my name  
Took about six hours or so  
Well, the man just grinned like it was all a game  
Said they'd let me know  
I put in my time till the Pocono line  
Shut down two years ago  
I was staying at the mission till I met Marie  
Now I can't stay there no more  
  
Fella 'cross town said he's lookin' for a man  
To move some old cars around  
Maybe me and Marie could find a burned-out  
Van and do a little settlin' down  
Aw, but I'm just dreamin', I ain't got no ride  
And the junkyard's a pretty good ways  
That job's about a half week old besides  
It'd be gone now anyway  
  
Unemployment said I got no more checks  
And they showed me to the hall  
My brother died in Georgia some time ago  
I got no one left to call  
Summer wasn't bad below the bridge  
A little short on food that's all  
Now I gotta get Marie some kind of coat  
We're headed down into fall  
  
I used to play the mouth harp pretty good  
Hustled up a little dough  
But I got drunk and I woke up rolled  
A couple of months ago  
They got my harp and they got my dollar  
Them low life so and so's  
Harps cost money and I ain't got it  
It's my own fault I suppose  
  
The Pocono's down but the Chesapeak's runnin'  
Two freights everyday  
If it was just me I'd be headed south  
But Marie can't catch no train  
She's got some pain and she thinks it's a baby,  
Says we gotta wait and see  
In my heart I know it's a little boy  
Hope he don't end up like me  
  
Well, the man's still grinnin' says he lost my file  
I gotta stand in line again  
I want to kill him but I just say no  
I had enough of that line my friend  
I head back to the bridge, it's getting kinda cold  
I'm feelin' too low down to lie  
I guess I'll just tell Marie the truth  
Hope she don't break down and cry  
  
Marie she didn't wake up this morning  
She didn't even try  
She just rolled over and went to heaven  
My little boy safe inside  
I laid them in the sun where somebody'd find them  
Caught a Chesapeak on the fly  
Marie will know I'm headed south  
So's to meet me by and by  
Marie will know I'm headed south  
So to meet me by and by.
