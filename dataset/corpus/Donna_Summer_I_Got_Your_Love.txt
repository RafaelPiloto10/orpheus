[Chorus:]  
I got your love  
It's all that i got  
I got your love  
It's all i ever think about  
I got your love  
Every last drop  
I got your love  
It's all I ever think about  
It's all I ever think about  
It's all I ever think about  
  
Baby In the heart of my heart I want more  
Of the man who just walked through that door  
The only one that my eyes see  
  
Baby the moments have drifted away  
And the hours became lonely days  
You're the answer to what i have prayed  
I, I will be good to you  
I, I will be good to you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Baby, losing you's all that i fear  
And i'm losing it when you're not here  
I never could go on without you  
  
Baby, I feel like a shower of light  
And I need you right here by my side  
I'm craving you all of my life  
  
I, I will be good to you  
I, I will be good to you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Aaah you move me  
Baby  
Aaah you move me  
  
I got your love  
It's all I ever think about  
I got your love  
Every last drop  
I got your love  
It's all I ever think about  
All I ever think about (come to me baby)  
All I ever think about (come to me baby)  
All I ever think about  
Your love
