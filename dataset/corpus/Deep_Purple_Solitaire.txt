Door  
Don't close the door  
I want to feel the cold  
I want to see the light  
Momma, where you gone?  
This is no dream  
Can't make it right if it's wrong  
Dancing with strangers  
Fighting with friends  
  
It's a matter of time  
Between love and despair  
Falling over the line  
Empty hearts and icy stares  
Call me Solitaire  
  
The eyes  
In the face on the wall  
Follow me round the room  
Follow me everywhere  
A heart without an echo  
A man without a child  
Alone with all my sorrow  
Dancing with strangers  
Fighting with friends  
  
It's a matter of time between love and despair  
Falling over the line  
Empty hearts and icy stares  
Call me Solitaire
