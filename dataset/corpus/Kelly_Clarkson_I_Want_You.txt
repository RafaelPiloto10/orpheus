Hot temper with the shortest fuse  
You're such a mess with an attitude  
You working hard but you're paying more  
You never talk 'cause you don't have to  
You got a job but you hate the man  
Who takes it all like Uncle Sam  
  
I want you you you you you you you  
I I I I I I I want you  
  
Out of gas so you walk for miles  
To pick me up in your worn out shoes  
You never settle or never take too much  
You count on me just like I count on you  
Kiss me like when I first saw you  
Figured out couldn't be without you  
  
You you you you you you you  
I I I I I I I want you  
I want you you you you you you you  
I I I I I I I want you  
  
No one else will do  
I want  
No one makes me smile  
I want  
No one gets me how  
I want  
No one else is you you you  
  
I want you you you you you you you  
I I I I I I I want you  
I want you you you you you you you  
I I I I I I I want you  
  
You're so hot tempered with the shortest fuse  
You're such a mess with an attitude  
  
You you you you you you you  
I I I I I I I want you  
I want you you you you you you you  
I I I I I I I want I want I want I want  
  
No one else will do  
I want  
No one makes me smile  
I want  
No one gets me how  
I want  
No one else is you you you  
  
I want you you you you you you you  
I I I I I I I want you  
I want you you you you you you you  
I I I I I I I want you  
I I want you  
  
You and me walking together  
Screwing up for worse or for better  
  
You you you you you you you  
I I I I I I I want you
