From the very first moment I saw you, I knew our love would be so strong  
And the very first moment I kissed you, I knew our joy would last so long  
And then I saw you making love to my best friend, I didn't know whatever to
say  
I saw you making love to my best friend  
So I looked him right in his eyes and I said - listen boy  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Won't you take some more, it's what you came for  
And don't mind me, I won't throw you no curves  
Have yourself a ball with my good woman  
Won't you take some more boy, it's more than you deserve  
Won't you take some more boy, it's more than you deserve  
  
When I saw you hanging round the truck stop, shining like an angel in the
night  
And when I saw you crying like a baby, I knew you'd have to be my wife  
  
Then I saw you making love to my best friend, I didn't know whatever to say  
I saw you making love to my best friend  
So I looked him right in his eyes and I said - listen boy  
  
Now I think I'm gonna have to leave you  
Because I'm feeling much too weak to share  
And the pie, oh it's cut in too many pieces  
The flavor that I crave is no longer there  
  
Then I saw you making love to two of my best friends  
I didn't know whatever to say  
I saw you making love to a group of my best friends  
So I looked them right in their eyes and I said - listen here, group  
  
Won't you take some more boys, it's more than you deserve
