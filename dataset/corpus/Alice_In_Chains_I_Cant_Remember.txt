Turn around you say  
'Scuse the 'tude but I haven't eaten today  
And my eyes are turning gray  
What's your name?  
I can't remember, I can't remember  
Bring me down you try  
Feel the pain and keep it all in till you die  
Without eyes you cannot cry  
Who's to blame?  
  
I can't remember,I can't  
Remember identity, the visions in my mind from  
Screamin' at me  
And mama, mama, ooh, my angry brains of infancy  
Knocked down but I have enough hate to breathe  
down your throat and steal your energy  
You took everything but my will to be  
Now the loss of your god won't make me bleed  
I am alive
