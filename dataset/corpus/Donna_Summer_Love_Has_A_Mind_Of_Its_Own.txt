Think about me and you  
Think of all the changes we've been through  
The laughter an' the tears  
The years together  
Little did we both know  
When we fell we gave up all control  
Though times get hard  
We're strong enough to carry on  
'Cause love has a mind of its own  
It moves in it's own circles  
And it roams where it will roam  
Love has a mind of it's own  
It holds our lives together  
You're my heart and you're my home  
Stayed awake last night  
Told myself that this time we were through  
That passion wasn't pain  
My heart had changed  
But then in the morning light  
The feeling cut me like a knife  
And then I knew  
I couldn't walk away from you 'cause  
Love has a mind of its own  
It moves in it's own circles  
And it roams where it will roam  
Love has a mind of it's own  
It holds our lives together  
You're my heart and you're my home  
Oh, we can drive ourselves so far apart  
Till the world gets in between  
Before you know, the distance grows  
Till never we lose sight of the dream  
But the wonder of it all  
Is our love will survive  
It never fails to keep us going  
It never fails to keep us alive  
Love has a mind of its own  
It moves in it's own circles  
And it roams where it will roam  
Love has a mind of it's own  
It holds our lives together  
You're my heart and you're my home  
Love has a mind of its own  
It moves in it's own circles  
And it roams where it will roam  
Love has a mind of it's own  
It holds our lives together  
You're my heart and you're my home
