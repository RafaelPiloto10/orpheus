The wait is done, the battle's won  
So count the cost before you run  
Cause on and on your time was power  
The clock on the wall ticks away the hours  
Come on down, you're flyin' high  
You'll never win if you never try  
Stop the hate and carry the load  
Come on, get this show on the road  
  
On through the night, you can't stop me now  
On through the night, you won't stop me anyhow  
  
The stakes are high and gettin' higher  
I'm flat on my face and you call me liar  
I'm watching you, you're watching me  
You're watching every move that I can see  
My reputation's still at stake  
I play it safe for safety's sake  
Your ego and your promises  
Are gonna fade again and again  
  
On through the night, you won't stop me now  
On through the night, you won't stop me anyhow  
Not anyhow  
  
All you want to hear is the audience applause  
You can't get on stage for a country clause  
And the road ahead seems a little rough  
If you want to know my feelings I'd say that's tough  
And that's tough  
  
Your wheels ain't turnin', you're out of gas  
You pay by check but they take cash  
Two roads ahead but which to take  
And you can't see it's your mistake  
They're waitin' for you  
They're waitin' for me  
And what seems like eternity  
It's all tradition, it'll get you yet  
In rock'n'roll there's no safety net  
  
On through the night, you can't stop me now  
On through the night, you can't stop me anyhow  
On through the night, goin' on and on, on and on  
On through the night, you can't stop me anyhow  
No no not anyhow
