Fields of light  
They hold me inside  
Count, my stars, they are lucky, in the sky  
There's a time  
When you go off the line  
And all my things, look like someone else's memories  
  
Cold outside, burns a great big hole in my heart  
I'll just wait, til you're happy, and your smile makes it right  
It makes it right  
  
Sleep inside, the ocean has smiles  
It shimmers and, and it glows for some people  
I know it shines  
I know it shines  
  
Stay inside  
Don't the colors make you blind  
They hold me inside  
Count my stars  
Let them shine  
I know they shine
