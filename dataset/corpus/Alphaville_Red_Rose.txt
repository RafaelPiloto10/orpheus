little girl, do you know what you are, do you know  
this baby's gonna be a star, do you know  
a teenangel empress from hollywood highs  
with wonderful eyes  
your beautiful, put on your stratoblue suit  
i know that your in the mood to fly  
we got the power to make it come true  
the most exciting news  
we'll be together till the end of time  
and when you smile, red rose, it's just like blue sunshine  
oh, we're ascending and we'll never die  
cause when we kiss, red rose, we're changing 6 to 9  
it's revolution time  
when 6 turns into 9  
move over, closer to my fantasies, pretty baby  
we're standing at the turn of the centuries  
the daughter of time is dancing tonite  
little dreamer, you're the d.j. of your soul  
c'mon, lets swing to that rock and roll  
the sweetest arrows of desire will set this dance on fire  
above the city of the million moons  
we'll reach the palace of the sun  
do what you will shall be our destiny  
we will unfold the secrets of the new jerusalem
