Dark are the streets, gloom's creeping out of the walls  
Dirt comes alive and all the neon-lights call  
Demons and fools and a lady of black  
She's of the kind nighttime-insomniac  
She sees the pray and she's aware  
The times are hard but she don't care  
She's a vampire  
Desire darker than black  
She's a vampire  
Reach higher, no turning back  
Her wings are curtains of the night  
She knows no wrong or right  
Dead are the places where this goddess has been  
Cold is the skin that this creature has seen  
Her universe is an ocean of blood  
Her dining table the cradle of mud  
She sees the prey and she's aware  
The times are hard but she don't care  
She's a vampire  
Desire darker than black  
She's a vampire  
Reach higher, no turning back  
Her wings are curtains of the night  
She knows no wrong or right  
The night is blind, the mistress she is calling you  
To be by her side forevermore  
Follow her until her thirst is sated  
An immortal lie, heartblood  
Can't help yourself, she's got you paralyzed  
So would you kiss the sun goodbye?  
And give your life to never die?  
She's a vampire  
Desire darker than black  
She's a vampire  
Reach higher, no turning back  
She's a vampire  
Desire darker than black  
She's a vampire  
Reach higher, no turning back
