[Verse 1]  
Take my sins and wash them away  
Teach me how to pray  
I've been stranded here in the dark  
Take these walls away  
I've been swimming in the ocean  
Til I'm almost drowned  
Give me something I can believe in  
Teach me how to pray  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And we can do drugs, and we can smoke weed, and we can drink whiskey  
Yeah, we can get high, and we can get stoned  
And we can sniff glue, and we can do E, and we can drop acid  
Forever be lost with no way home  
  
[Chorus]  
Yeah we can run, and we can hide  
But we won't find the answers  
If you go down, then you'll get help along the way  
But if you wanna save your soul, then we should travel up together  
And make the devil pray  
  
[Break 1]  
(Oh, don't save us) (x3)  
Devil's here to fool ya  
(Oh, don't save us) (x3)  
Devil's here to fool ya  
Ooh, save us (x3)  
Devil's here to fool ya  
Ooh, save us (x3)  
Devil's here to fool ya  
  
[Verse 2]  
Mother Mary, can't you help me?  
Cause I'm gone astray  
Oh, the angels that were around me  
Have a-flown away  
The ground beneath my feet's getting warmer  
Lucifer is near  
Holding on, but I'm getting weaker  
Watch me disappear  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And we can do drugs, and we can smoke weed, and we can drink whiskey  
Yeah, we can get high, and we can get stoned  
And we can sniff glue, and we can do E, and we can drop acid  
Forever be lost with no way home  
  
[Chorus]  
Yeah we can run, and we can hide  
But we won't find the answers  
If you go down, then you'll get help along the way  
But if you wanna save your soul, then we should travel up together  
And make the devil pray  
  
[Break 2] (x3)  
Ooh, ooh, sing hallelujah  
Ooh, save my soul  
Ooh-ooh, the devil's here to fool ya  
Until my story's told
