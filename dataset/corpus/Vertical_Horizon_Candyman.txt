[Chorus]  
And even though I'm right behind you  
Shadows haunt and taunt your hand  
I cannot be your everything  
But I'll be your candy man  
  
You move a sudden grace, a child upon the Earth  
You wanted love to find you but you found it first  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We look through antiques on a fuzzy, fuzzy day  
But you always know just what you want  
Want right away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And though you cry at night  
It's to be expected  
But know you're mine tonight  
  
So when the sun has died you dive into your mind  
But your soul is never lost until the deal is signed  
  
[Chorus]
