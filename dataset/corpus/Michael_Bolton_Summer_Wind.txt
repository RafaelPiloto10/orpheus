The summer wind  
Came blowin' in from across the sea  
It lingered there  
To touch your hair and walk with me  
All summer long we sang a song  
Then we strolled that golden sand  
Two sweethearts and the summer wind  
  
Like painted kites  
Those days and nights they went flyin' by  
The world was new  
Beneath a blue umbrella sky  
Then softer than a piper man  
One day it called to you  
I lost you  
I lost you to the summer wind  
  
The autumn wind and the winter winds  
They have come and gone  
And still the days  
Those lonely days they go on and on  
And guess who sighs his lullabies  
Through nights that never end  
My fickle friend, the summer wind  
  
The summer wind  
Warm summer wind
