About a hundred years ago now,  
Thought I was left for dead.  
Soliloquy, she was my  
A picture, a wake,  
My metaphoric friend.  
  
So then I fell in love with an irony named life,  
It taught me this from that and  
A picture, a wake, you're gonna be Hilikus.  
  
History has a tendency  
To block yout the popular beliefs  
About the leaders of the time,  
So glisten with my syllables and  
Ponder the thought,  
Maybe they should have  
Had to dedicate more to it, go!  
You've got to be,  
So good to be,  
You've got to be Hilikus!  
  
So I took a walk out side  
With my new found friend and the knowledge imbibe.  
I figured I'd find another  
With the same attitude,  
Yes, then maybe I could talk  
To someone other than myself!  
  
The doors are swinging wide open,  
A positive attitude and the ilk in my pocket  
Had a lot to do with my new found friend,  
The Hilikus.  
  
History has a tendency  
To block out the popular beliefs  
About the leaders of the time,  
So glisten with my syllables and  
Ponder the thought,  
Maybe they should have had to dedicate more to it, go!  
  
You've got to be,  
So good to be,  
You've got to be  
Hilikus
