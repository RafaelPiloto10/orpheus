Kiss me once, then kiss me twice  
Then kiss me once again.  
It's been a long, long time.  
Haven't felt like this, my dear  
Since I can't remember when.  
It's been a long, long time  
  
You'll never know how many dreams  
I've dreamed about you.  
Or just how empty they all seemed without you.  
So kiss me once, then kiss me twice  
Then kiss me once again.  
It's been a long, long time.  
  
Ah, kiss me once, then kiss me twice  
Then kiss me once again.  
It's been a long time.  
Haven't felt like this my dear  
Since I can't remember when  
It's been a long, long time.  
  
You'll never know how many dreams  
I dreamed about you.  
Or just how empty they all seemed without you.  
So kiss me once then kiss me twice  
Then kiss me once again.  
It's been a long, long time.  
Long, long time.
