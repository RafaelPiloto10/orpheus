Who was with you - where you been?  
Baby it can't be this again  
I can't cool it 'cos I can't win it with you  
  
Words like punches - things we said  
Under the belt and in the head  
Down for the count in a cold cold bed  
Beat by jealousy  
  
Jealousy - jealousy  
Stanglehold - love can't breathe  
Let me be - set me free  
Jealousy  
  
You won't hear what I imply  
What you say - I won't buy  
You deny but you lie  
Jealousy  
  
Jealousy - jealousy  
Stanglehold - love can't breathe  
Let me be - set me free  
Jealousy  
  
Down suspicious - torn in doubt  
Dirty vicious - knock me out  
Danger, danger - stakes are high  
Hook the blow between the eyes  
Every round - we lose more ground  
Jealousy  
  
Jealousy - jealousy  
Stanglehold - love can't breathe  
Let me be - set me free  
Jealousy
