[Chorus]  
Star  
You're a star  
Yeah be careful  
What  
You're wishing for  
All your dreams  
Coming true  
Star yes you are  
You're now bigger  
Than Venus and Mars  
You can run  
But you can't hide  
  
So  
You're gonna make it  
Chance  
You're gonna take it  
Tinseltown  
Is calling your name  
Penny in your pocket  
Walking like a prophet  
Fortune teller  
Claiming your fame  
  
Arriving in style  
On the  
Red carpet mile  
To the left  
To the right  
Step aside  
As you wave  
To the crowd  
A voice  
Cries out loud  
Look at you  
You're the new  
Overnight sensation  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love and hate  
Related  
Privacy invaded  
A paparazzi  
Public domain  
Dirty little secret  
Guess  
She couldn't keep it  
At least you made it  
On the front page  
  
A tabloid be told  
All that glitters  
Ain't gold  
Not a muse  
Drug abuse suicide  
As you're left  
All alone  
After  
Selling your soul  
In the aisle, smile  
Ready  
For your close up  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Stars in your eyes  
Got  
Your piece of the pie  
In the sky  
Don't look down  
As you hang on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Stars in your eyes  
Got  
Your piece of the pie  
In the sky  
Don't look down  
As you're hanging on  
  
Hanging on  
For your life  
For you're better off  
Dead then alive  
Then they love you  
Forever
