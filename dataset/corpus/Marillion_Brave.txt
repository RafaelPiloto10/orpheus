What a brave, brave girl  
Never lied before  
Such a plain deceit  
Everyone would eventually know  
  
What a brave, brave girl  
Never loved before  
Placed herself in reach  
  
So he tried  
In his own way  
To find the heart  
Of the tight-packed rose  
  
She's gone now  
But oh, she aches  
She aches  
  
He will search until he's found  
A way to take the days  
  
See her sadness in your face  
She's inside you  
And she's crying
