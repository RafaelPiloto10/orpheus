Can't move my arms,  
Can't move my legs.  
Can't say no,  
I can't say yes.  
Can't help myself.  
I need your help.  
  
(We go)  
"Oh, ooh, what do we do,  
Now we just can't move?"  
We're calling out for Middle Street.  
  
"Oh, ooh, what do we do,  
Now we just can't move?"  
We hang on to every line,  
And walk straight down the middle of it.  
  
He thought he was gonna die,  
But he didn't.  
She thought she just couldn't cope,  
But she did.

But it wasn't  
It wasn't easy, though!  
  
Can't say yes,  
I can't say no.  
Can't begin,  
Can't let go  
Help me now.  
  
(We go)  
"Ooh, ooh, what do we do,  
Now we just can't move?"  
We're calling out for Middle Street.  
  
"Ooh, ooh, what do we do,  
Now we just can't move?"  
We hang on to every line,  
And walk straight down the middle of it.  
  
He thought he was gonna die,  
But he didn't.  
She thought she could never cope,  
But she did.  
We thought it was all over,  
But it wasn't...  
It hadn't started yet.  
  
And walk straight down the middle of it.  
And walk straight down the middle of it.  
Calling out for Middle Street.  
Calling out for Middle Street,  
Walking straight down the middle of it.
