Tempted and tried we're oft' made to wonder  
Why it should be thus all the day long  
While there are others living about us  
Never molested, though in the wrong.  
  
Farther along we'll know all about it  
Farther along we'll understand why  
Cheer up my brothers, live in the sunshine  
We'll understand it all by and by.  
  
Faithful to death is our loving saviour  
A few more days labour and wait  
Toils of the road will then be as nothing  
As we walk through that beautiful gate.  
  
Farther along we'll know all about it  
Farther along we'll understand why  
Cheer up my brothers, live in the sunshine  
We'll understand it all by and by.  
  
When we see Jesus coming in glory  
When He comes from His home in the sky  
Then we shall meet Him in that bright mansion  
We'll understand it all by and by.  
  
Farther along we'll know all about it  
Farther along we'll understand why  
Cheer up my brothers, live in the sunshine  
We'll understand it all by and by.  
  
Often I wonder why I must journey  
Over a road so rugged and steep  
While there are others living in comfort  
While with the lost I labour and weep.  
  
Farther along we'll know all about it  
Farther along we'll understand why  
Cheer up my brothers, live in the sunshine  
We'll understand it all by and by...
