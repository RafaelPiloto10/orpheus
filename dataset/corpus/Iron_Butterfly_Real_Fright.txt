Real fright's the story of a maddening darkness,  
It leaves your hands and your face real tight,  
Your mind starts to wander while your body starts shaking,  
Your mouth feels dry as your bones start aching.  
  
You want to know the pattern has has gripped your life,  
Your heart starts pounding while you're breathing real fright,  
A face chalk white that starts the sight,  
Ears hear the sounds of real fright.
