Beefsteak Charly is a-throwing a feast  
Right around the corner down the road East  
And there's a party goin' on  
Ooh, there's a party goin' on  
We're gonna swing it, shake it, make it  
Shimmy till the break of dawn  
Now everybody grab your Sunday best  
Let's make it on down to Charly's nest  
'Cause there's a party goin' on  
Ooh, there's a party goin' on  
We're gonna swing it, shake it, make it  
Shimmy till the break of dawn  
Well, you betcha yeah!  
So grab your shoes and baby grab your mink  
And leave those dishes on the kitchen sink  
'Cause there's a party goin' on  
Ooh, there's a party goin' on  
We're gonna swing it, shake it, make it  
Shimmy till the break of dawn  
Yeah, yeah, yeah!  
You don't need a rocket to take you into space  
Just make it down to Charly's, he's a-saving you a place  
'Cause there's a party goin' on  
Ooh, there's a party goin' on  
We're gonna swing it, shake it, make it  
Shimmy till the break of dawn  
We're gonna swing it, shake it, make it  
Shimmy till the break of dawn
