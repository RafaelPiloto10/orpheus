I've got people to see, places to go  
Deadlines to meet, a reputation to uphold  
It's like a ton of bricks breaking on my back  
It's like the force of gravity in full effect  
  
I got money to burn and I'm on the sake  
They bet their bomb on me 'cause I'm their ace of spades  
I feel the walls getting closer  
I'm like a bomb with all red wires  
  
All this pressure, all this pressure  
Maybe it means I'm gonna be  
All this pressure, all this pressure  
Maybe this means I'm gonna be  
  
A diamond, it won't ever bend  
A diamond, 'cause they're ladies, best friends  
A diamond, but there, there has to be more  
Than what these pirates are gambling for  
  
If not for the push I'd probably be a pebble  
If not for the pressure I'd be forgotten forever  
Just another stone skipped upon the water  
Drowning fast before the other failures  
  
I don't wanna be a distant memory on your wall  
Just another cd that you burned and never bought  
Am I not worth it to you after all that drama  
That we've been though?  
  
All this pressure, all this pressure  
Maybe it means I'm gonna be  
All this pressure, all this pressure  
Maybe this means I'm gonna be  
  
A diamond, it won't ever bend  
A diamond, 'cause they're ladies, best friends  
A diamond, but there, there has to be more  
Than what these pirates are gambling for  
  
Ooh ooh, diamond  
I've gotta be a diamond  
(I'm a diamond in the sky)  
(With you standing by)  
(Now catch me if I fall)  
Oh, oh, oh, yeah yeah yeah  
  
All this pressure, all this pressure  
Oh, I've gotta be, oh, I've gotta be  
All this pressure, all this pressure  
Oh, I've gotta be, oh, I've gotta be  
  
I'm a diamond in the sky  
With you standing by  
Now catch me if I fall  
Into the arms of a coma  
  
All this pressure, I've got pressure  
I'm gonna be a diamond, baby, I've gotta be a diamond  
You're gonna see, I'm gonna be a diamond
