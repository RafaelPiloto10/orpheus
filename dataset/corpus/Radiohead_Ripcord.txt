Soul destroyed with clever toys for little boys  
It's inevitable, inevitable, it's a soul destroyed  
You feel it till you're dry  
You feel it till you've had enough  
And you don't understand  
No Ripcord, no ripcord  
No Ripcord, no ripcord  
  
Aeroplane, do I mean what I mean  
It's inevitable, inevitable, oh aeroplane  
  
A thousand miles an hour  
On politics and power  
That you don't understand  
  
No Ripcord, no ripcord  
No Ripcord, no ripcord  
  
La la la la...  
  
The answer to your prayers  
We'll drop you anywhere  
  
No Ripcord, no ripcord  
No Ripcord, no ripcord
