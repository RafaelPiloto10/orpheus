Kansas City, Kansas City here I come. Kansas City, Kansas City here I come.  
Got some pretty little women there, I'm gonna get me one.  
Standing on the corner, crawl straight in my hand  
With my Kansas City Baby, now by the Kansas City world.  
Well the water in the city, well, taste like Georgia Pie  
Going to Kansas City where it tastes like sugar, oh I know it.  
Kansas City, Kansas City here I come.  
Got some pretty little women there, I'm gonna get me one.  
Kansas City, here every night you gave me none  
Kansas City, surely looked like they were done  
You know they turned it around now Baby, gonna scratch it, gonna run.  
And rock with my Baby, rock with my Baby, one more time  
Rock with my Baby, Kansas City Baby, one more time  
Went to the city for, for this souvenir in my hand.  
Well I might take a plane, might take a train  
If I have to walk you won't grind in the same.  
Oh, Kansas City, Kansas City here I come.  
Got some crazy little women there, I'm gonna get mo one
