So good to be with  
The people that know you.  
It's good to hear  
The things that they say,  
At times when you are with them.  
So good to note  
My strength is growing from day to day,  
There's not a thing  
I try to do without you  
  
Troubled times of pain that come  
I take them any old day.  
You come and you wash them all away  
  
Everywhere you sing in everything,  
And I try by remembering  
All the things that you said to me,  
From within all you did for me.  
Just one word.
