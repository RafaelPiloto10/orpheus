If I listened long enough to you  
I'd find a way to believe that it's all true  
Knowing that you lied, straight-faced, while I cried  
Still I'd look to find a reason to believe  
  
Someone like you makes it hard to live without somebody else  
Someone like you makes it easy to give, never think of myself  
  
If I gave you time to change my mind  
I'd find a way to leave the past behind  
Knowing that you lied, straight-faced, while I cried  
Still I'd look to find a reason to believe  
  
[Chorus]  
Someone like you makes it hard to live without somebody else  
Someone like you makes it easy to give, never think of myself  
Someone like you makes it hard to think about somebody else  
  
If I listened long enough to you  
I'd find a way to believe that it's all true  
I'd find a reason, a reason to believe (oh no)  
And though I want you, you're just not what I need  
  
[Chorus]  
Someone like you, like you  
I'd find a reason to believe  
I would find a reason to believe
