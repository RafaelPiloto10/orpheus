Oh the lights in the harbour-our-our  
They don't shine for me-ee-ee-ee  
I'm like a lost shi-ip  
Adrift on the sea-ea-ea  
  
Sea of heartbreak, lost love and loneliness  
Memories of your caress, so divi-i-ine  
How I wish you were mi-ine again my dear-ear-ear  
I'm on the sea of tears, sea of heartbreak  
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  
  
Oh-oh how did I lose you-ou-ou  
Oh where, where did I fai-ai-ail  
Why-why-why-why did you leave me  
Always to sai-ai-ai-ail  
  
The sea of heartbreak, lost love and loneliness  
Memories of your caress, so divi-i-ine  
How I wish you were mi-ine again my dear-ear-ear  
I'm on the sea of tears, sea of heartbreak  
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  
  
Oh what I'd gi-I've to sail back to shore-ore  
Back to your are-are-arms once more-ore-ore  
Come to my rescue-ue-ue  
Oh co-o-ome here to me-ee-ee  
Oh-oh take me, take me and keep me-ee-ee  
Away-ay-ay from the sea-ea-ea  
  
Sea of heartbreaks, lost love and loneliness  
Memories of your caress, so divi-i-ine  
How I wish you were mi-ine again my dear-ear-ear  
I'm on the sea of tears  
Sea of heartbreak, lost love and loneliness  
Memories of your caress, so divi-i-ine  
How I wish you were mi-ine again my dear-ear-ear  
I'm on the sea of tears, sea of heartbreak  
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  
  
Ooh...ooh-ooh-ooh  
On the sea of tears, sea of heartbreak  
Ooh-ooh-ooh  
  
Ooh-ooh-ooh  
On the sea of tears, sea of heartbreak [fade]
