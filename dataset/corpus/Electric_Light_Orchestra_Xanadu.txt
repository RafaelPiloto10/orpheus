A place where nobody dared to go  
The love that we came to know  
They call it Xanadu  
And now, open your eyes and see what we have made is real  
We are in Xanadu  
  
A million lights are dancing and you are, a shooting star  
An everlasting world and you're here with me, eternally  
Xanadu, Xanadu  
(Now we are here) in Xanadu  
Xanadu, Xanadu  
(Now we are here) in Xanadu  
Xanadu, your neon lights will shine for you, Xanadu  
  
The love that echoes of long ago  
You needed the world to know  
They are in Xanadu  
The dream that came through a million years  
That lived through all the tears  
It came to Xanadu  
  
A million light are dancing and you are, a shooting star  
An everlasting world and you're here with me, eternally  
Xanadu, Xanadu  
(Now we are here) in Xanadu  
Xanadu, Xanadu  
(Now we are here) in Xanadu  
Xanadu, your neon lights will shine for you, Xanadu  
  
Now that I'm here, now that you're near, in Xanadu
