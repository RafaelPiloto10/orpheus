I'm here, you're there  
Come closer, tonight I'm lonely  
Come here with me  
I want it the way it used to be  
  
What is left of love?  
Tell me, who would even care?  
So much time has passed  
I'd still meet you anywhere  
Water under bridge  
Evening after day  
What is left of love  
Here that didn't drift away?  
  
I can remember days of sun  
We knew our lives had just begun  
We could do anything, we're fearless when we're young  
Under the moon, address unknown  
I can remember nights in Rome  
I thought that love would last, a promise set in stone  
  
I'd survive with only memories  
If I could change the way I feel  
But I want more than only memories  
A human touch to make them real  
  
Another day, another dream  
Over the bridge an empty scene  
We'd spend the weekend lost in bed and float upstream  
I don't know why we moved away  
Lost in the here and now we strayed  
Into a New York zone, our promise was betrayed  
  
I was there, caught on Tenth Avenue  
You elsewhere with Culver City blues  
Then and there I knew that I'd lost you  
  
What is left of love?  
Tell me, who will even care?  
So much time has passed  
I'd still meet you anywhere  
Water under bridge  
Evening after day  
What is left of love  
Here that didn't drift away?  
  
Don't give me all your love and pain  
Don't sell me New York in the rain  
Let's leave our promises behind  
Rewind and try again  
  
What remains in time that didn't fade away?  
Sometimes I need to see  
The way it used to be
