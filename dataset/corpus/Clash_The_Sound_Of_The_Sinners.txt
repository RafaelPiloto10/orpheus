As the floods of God  
Wash away sin city  
They say it was written  
In the page of the Lord  
  
But I was looking  
For that great jazz note  
That destroyed  
The walls of Jericho  
  
The winds of fear  
Whip away the sickness  
The messages on the tablet  
Was valium  
  
As the planets form  
That golden cross Lord  
I'll see you on  
The holy cross roads  
  
After all this time  
To believe in Jesus  
After all those drugs  
I thought I was Him  
After all my lying  
And a-crying  
And my suffering  
I ain't good enough  
I ain't clean enough  
To be Him  
  
The tribal wars  
Burning up the homeland  
The fuel of evil  
Is raining from the sky  
The sea of lava  
Flowing down the mountain  
The time will sleep  
Us sinners by  
  
Holy rollers roll  
Give generously now  
Pass the hubcap please  
Thank you Lord
