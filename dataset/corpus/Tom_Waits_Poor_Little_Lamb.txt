Poor little lamb now his fleece is all cold  
Wakes up in the morning alone  
Poor little lamb knows what's coming  
Life is an empty cup  
  
Poor little lamb watch your shoulder  
Coyote's waiting out there  
Nobody will get any older  
If we don't find a way out of here  
  
So let's go on a bummer this summer  
Where we won't have to be afraid  
The world will be on a hummer, boys  
And we'll laugh and we'll drink lemonade
