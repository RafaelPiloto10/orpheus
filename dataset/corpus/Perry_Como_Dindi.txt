Sky, so vast as the sky  
With far away clouds just wandering by . . .  
Where did they go?  
Oh I don't know, don't know . . .  
Wind, that speaks to the leaves  
Telling stories that no one believes . . .  
Stories of love  
Belong to you and me . . .  
Oh Dindi . . .  
If I only had words  
I would say all the beautiful things that I see  
When you're with me  
Oh my Dindi!  
Oh Dindi . . .  
Like the song of the wind in the trees  
That's how my heart is singing Dindi, happy Dindi,  
When you're with me!  
I love you more each day,  
Yes I do, yes I do . . .  
I'd let you go away  
If you take me with you!  
Don't you know Dindi . . .  
I'd be running an' searching for you,  
Like a river, that can't find the sea,  
That would be me, without you my Dindi!  
  
Don't you know Dindi . . .  
I'd be running an' searching for you,  
Like a river, that can't find the sea,  
That would be me, without you my Dindi!
