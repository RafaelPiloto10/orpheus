She says she met me on a tour  
She keeps knocking on my door,  
She won't leave me, leave me alone  
This girl she wouldn't stop, almost had to call the cops  
She was scheming, ooh, she was wrong  
  
'Cause she wanted all my attention, oh  
And she was dragging my name through the dirt, no  
She was dying for my affection  
But she got mad 'cause I didn't give it to her  
  
I'm talking to you, Maria  
Why you wanna do me like that?  
That ain't my baby, no, that ain't my girl  
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?  
She ain't my baby,no, she ain't my girl  
But she talking in, and she needs to quit  
But never this, all I know she's not mine  
That ain't my baby (that's not my baby), that ain't my girl  
'Cause she's wildin' out, what she talking about?  
Let me tell you now this girl she's not mine  
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl  
  
Now she's in the magazines, on TV, making a scene  
Oh she's crazy, crazy in love  
And she's all over the news, saying everything but the truth  
She's faking, faking it all  
  
'Cause she wanted all my attention, yeah  
And she was dragging my name through the dirt, no  
She was dying for my affection  
But she got mad 'cause I didn't give it to her  
  
I'm talking to you, Maria  
Why you wanna do me like that?  
That ain't my baby, no, that ain't my girl  
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?  
She ain't my baby, no, she ain't my girl  
But she talking in, and she needs to quit  
But never this, all I know she's not mine  
That ain't my baby (that's not my baby), that ain't my girl, no  
'Cause she's wildin' out, what she talking about?  
Let me tell you now this girl she's not mine  
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl  
  
Why are you trying, trying to lie girl  
When ain't I never met you at all  
Saying goodbye, but how could ya  
You throw this, you throw this  
Your foolishness, seduces  
  
Maria why you wanna do me like that?  
That ain't my baby, no, that ain't my girl  
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?  
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl

That ain't my baby, (that's no my baby) that ain't my girl  
'Cause she's wildin' out, what she talking about?  
Let me tell you now that girl she's not mine  
She ain't my baby (she is not my baby), she ain't my girl, no
