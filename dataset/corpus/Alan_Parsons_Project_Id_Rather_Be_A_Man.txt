(lead vocal - david paton)  
  
You don't fool me with your tinted eyes and make-up  
The firebird hides in shadow when you wake up  
Your golden hair is black  
Your jeans are tight but your hide is slack  
Try it on the company but you don't fool me  
  
Well I'd rather be a man than play my role like you do  
I'd rather be a man than sin my soul like you do  
I'd rahter be a man than slave the way that you do  
I'd rather be a man cause a man don't crawl like you do  
  
You don't fool me with your easy lies and fables  
You won't see me in ten buck furs and sables  
You sparkle like a snake  
The wine is real but the glass if fake  
Blame it on the apple tree but you don't fool me  
  
Well I'd rather be a man than play my role like you do  
I'd rather be a man than sin my soul like you do  
I'd rahter be a man than slave the way that you do  
I'd rather be a man cause a man don't crawl like you do  
  
Your golden hair is black  
Your jeans are tight but your hide is slack  
Try it on the company but you don't fool me  
  
Well I'd rather be a man than play my role like you do  
I'd rather be a man than sin my soul like you do  
I'd rahter be a man than slave the way that you do  
I'd rather be a man cause a man don't crawl like you do  
  
I'd rather be a man cause a man don't crawl like you do  
  
I'd rather be a man cause I wouldn't wanna be like you
