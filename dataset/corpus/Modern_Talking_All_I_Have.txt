Don't take away my heaven, don't take away my heart  
Close your eye's to seven, but, do not tear apart  
It's an endless fire, it's an endless dream  
I feel love and desire, oh, it's really love it seems  
  
[Chorus]  
All I have, all I need and all I want is you tonight  
All I see and all I feel is just holding you so tight  
All I miss, all I dream and all I want is your sweet love  
All I miss is you, where ever I go and whatever I do  
  
My love is getting stronger, my love is here to stay  
I can't wait no longer, baby, make my day  
Oh, tonight I am lonely, so lonely without you  
Know that your the only and that my heart is true  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, it's now or never, is it no empty way?  
I will stay forever, baby, what can I say?  
I miss you like crazy, where did you sleep last night?  
Nobody know's you baby, shouldn't you stay by my side?
