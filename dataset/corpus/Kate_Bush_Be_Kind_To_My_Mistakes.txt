(It is this that brings us together.)  
It's all right, darling,  
We can do this together.  
It's all right, darling,  
I can think of nothing better.  
I don't know you,  
And you don't know me:  
It is this that brings us together.  
(It is this that brings us together.)  
I don't know what you are  
Looking for in me.  
I don't know what I want,  
But my heart is needing.  
Am I yours? Are you mine?  
We'll find all we're meant to find.  
In your life, in my life,  
There are secrets too dark  
To let out, to let go of,  
To get over.  
But that's all right, baby.  
That's all right by me.  
It's all right now.  
Just let me say  
Please...  
Please...  
Please...  
Please be kind,  
Be kind to my mistakes.  
Be kind,  
Be kind  
To me.
