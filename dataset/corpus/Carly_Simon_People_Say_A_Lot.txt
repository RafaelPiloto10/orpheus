People say a lot when they want the job, yeah  
Lining up sideways around the block  
"It's not for the money" she say to you  
Almost convincing herself that it's true  
"I'll take care of your dog when you're away"  
"I don't mind working Saturdays"  
"When you wanna work I'll work with you", she say  
"And I'll go on working when you wanna play"  
"Nothing gonna hurt you when I'm around"  
"I'll keep my eyes wide open and my nose to the ground"  
"I'll be like a mama with a baby cub"  
  
[Chorus]  
People say a lot when they want the job  
People say a lot when they want the job, yeah  
People say a lot when they want the job  
  
When you begin to see a sinister gleam  
You're locked in too tight on the same team  
There's a little holiday in her heart  
When she sees you slip up, Ah  
It's like Christmas Eve just to see you trip up  
Ooops, then down again  
She'll sit on the floor hardly hiding a grin  
When her tears spill out, crocodile chagrin  
It's her contempt for you, she thinks you're a slob  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Greatest cook to bring a meal (didn't need a recipe)  
Said she'll also deal the cards (dealt the knave and two and three)  
Said she also feel the thrill of the willow in the wind  
(Feel the thrillo the willow, or oak or elm or ash or pine sol)  
  
It's already too late when she's reading your mail  
Calling your agent and making the deal  
She'll just copy and paste it and make it last  
Nothing is sacred about your past  
  
She'll tell of the poppies in the July fest  
Maybe her brother with the badge can make the arrest  
"You could go to jail, fail all the tests"  
"Forget your keys and your secrets and your little black box"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She was awfully good at fire (fiery fiery hussy burn)  
She burned bridges where she could (she really couldn't burn them very well)  
She turned young men into torches (burning scarecrow)  
She had a way with wood (do away with wood, do away with wood)  
  
People say a lot when they want the job  
Lining up eager around the block  
Promising, promising never to quit  
Well it's a full time job to be a hypocrite  
Maybe they remember that they've done it before  
Practicing, with their dolls on the floor  
The lie itself becoming the seed  
The messy mascara, the future deed  
The actor's bow, the junkie's need  
They line up again just to wipe you clean  
  
They line up again just to wipe you out  
Line up again around the block  
A mighty force of youth for hire  
Spouting ideas that geniuses would rob oh  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
"Tell me Phoebe, do you want someday to have an award like that of your own?"  
  
"More than anything else in the world"  
  
"Then you must ask Miss Harrington how to get one  
Miss Harrington knows all about it"
