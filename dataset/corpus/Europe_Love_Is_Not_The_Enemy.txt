It's glowing on the outside  
Coming by the moonlight  
Looking at this blue thing  
Falling by the waste time  
  
The years keep on calling  
Riding on a moonbeam  
Having on a daydream  
  
Crash the barricades, raise the alarm  
We've forgotten how to feel  
Break the silence, shout it out  
Call the angels there's a friend in need  
  
Love is not the enemy  
Love is not the enemy  
  
Looking at the bright side  
Walking in the sunshine  
Loving this blue thing  
Want it in my life  
  
The years keep on calling  
We headed for Venus  
No sign of life  
  
Crash the barricades, don't be afraid  
We've forgotten how to feel  
Break the silence, shout it out  
Call the angels there's a friend in need  
  
Love is not the enemy  
Love is not the enemy  
  
Oh, can you feel it? Does anybody care?  
Oh, do you need it? Say a little prayer  
Oh, can you feel it? Does anybody care?  
Oh, do you need it? Say a little prayer  
  
Crash the barricades, raise the alarm  
We've forgotten how to feel  
Break the silence, shout it out  
Call the angels there's a friend in need, oh  
  
Break the silence, shout it out  
Call the angels there's a friend in need  
Love is not the enemy  
Love is not the enemy  
  
Oh, can you feel it? Does anybody care?  
Oh, do you need it? Say a little prayer  
Oh, can you feel it? Does anybody care?  
Oh, do you need it? Say a little prayer
