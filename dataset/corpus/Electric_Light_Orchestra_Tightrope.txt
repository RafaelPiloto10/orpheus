They say some days you're gonna win  
They say some days you're gonna lose  
I tell you I got news for you  
You're losin' all the time, you never win, no  
  
If you believe that's how it's gonna be I'd better put you down  
Get off your tightrope up there, come down on  
The ground you gotta save me now, you better turn around  
  
When I looked around, I was heading down  
Won't somebody throw me down a line?  
  
They say some days you gotta give  
They say some days you gotta take  
If that's the way it's gotta be  
Roll it over and you will see  
  
The city streets are full of people going nowhere making time  
The change from night to day is really only hours  
It's just along the line, can't you see the sign?  
  
When I looked around, I was heading down  
Won't somebody throw me down a line?  
  
I want to look you straight in the eye  
I want to tell you how I really feel  
And I can feel the wheels are turnin' round  
Won't somebody throw me down a line?  
  
The city streets are full of people going nowhere making time  
The change from night to day is really only hours  
It's just along the line, can't you see the sign?  
  
When I closed my eyes, I was so surprised  
Somebody had thrown me down the line, stopped me drownin'  
Somebody had thrown me down the line
