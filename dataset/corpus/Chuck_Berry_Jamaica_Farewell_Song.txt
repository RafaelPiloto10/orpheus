Down the way where the nights are gay,  
And the sun shines brightly on the mountaintop,  
I took a trip on a sailing ship,  
And when I reached Jamaica I made a stop.  
But I'm sad to say, I'm on my way,  
Won't be back for many a day,  
My heart is down, my head is turning around,  
I miss all my friends in Kingston town.  
  
Down at the market you can hear,  
All the ladies cry out while on their heads they bear,  
Akie rice, salt fish are nice,  
And the sun is fine any time of the year.  
  
[CHORUS  
But I'm sad to say, I'm on my way,  
Won't be back for many a day,  
My heart is down, my head is turning around,  
I miss all my friends in Kingston town.]  
  
Sounds of laughter everywhere,  
And the children sway to and fro,  
I must declare that my heart is there,  
Though I've been from Maine to Mexico.  
  
[CHORUS (twice)  
But I'm sad to say, I'm on my way,  
Won't be back for many a day,  
My heart is down, my head is turning around,  
I miss all my friends in Kingston town.]
