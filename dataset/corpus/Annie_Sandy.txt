Fifi, That ain't a name for this mutt.  
So how about Champion?  
Champion you're anything but.  
  
We could call him Tiger, But there's no bite in him,  
Tiger! Tppth, Kittens would frighten him.  
Rover! Why not think it over?  
Rover is the perfect name for this dumb look-in' dog.  
  
Sandy, Sandy's his name if you please.  
If you don't believe me ask anyone of the fleas  
Residing on Sandy,  
  
True he ain't pedigreed, Sandy, there ain't no better breed.  
And he really comes in handy,  
'Specially when you're all alone in the night  
And you're small and terribly frightened it's  
Sandy, Sandy who'll always be there!
