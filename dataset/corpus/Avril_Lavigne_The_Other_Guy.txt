[Verse:]  
I know I'll never have him  
But I'm there when you're not over his friend  
I listen when you come to me  
But 'cause of who he is you don't have the time to see  
  
I really feel the way you feel  
Just 'cause it's him don't mean it's not real  
Your always sayin' your love's true  
I listen but I can't say the same for you  
  
[Bridge:]  
What I offer's unreturned  
You don't have time to see me burn  
You've so far failed to see  
How much you're affecting me  
  
[Chorus:]  
When you think of him  
I'm thinkin' of the other guy  
I'm in love to  
He's constantly on my mind  
If you weren't shared by blood  
Then would you have the time  
I don't get to choose  
Who I dream of at night  
You tell me how you feel  
I feel the same way with the other guy  
So bad it's not real  
You can't make me cover it up, you know I really try  
You can see by my skin  
I shiver and shake and I follow him with my eyes  
I'm nervous and I know it's a sin  
But seein' him drives me wild inside  
  
[Verse 3:]  
If it was another  
Maybe not your brother  
Would it be ok to let him drive me wild?  
But then lookin' back  
You've always turned your back  
Would it be ok to listen to my smile?  
  
[Verse 4]  
Your convinced  
He's so unperfect  
But I'm convinced  
That it's worth it  
  
I listen to you goin on and on  
Bout how you and that boy got it on  
You don't have time to listen to me  
I'm in love but you can't see  
I don't have opinions you just talk  
But with me you tell me I'm stupid to feel what I feel  
I can't run away you only let me walk  
Come on now girl, you ain't bein' real
