When you're in love  
You don't know much about it  
Not in your mind  
Romantic love  
Rots the brain,  
No doubt about it  
You're out of your mind,  
You're out of your mind  
  
Seeing things like your heart with wings  
Then you hear violin strings playing  
Feel all the things that you feel you should  
You would lie, you would kill, you would die  
At least that's what you're saying  
The worst thing is that you really would  
  
When you're in love  
You don't know much about it  
Not in your mind  
Romantic love  
Rots the brain,  
No doubt about it  
You're out of your mind,  
You're out of your mind  
  
Six thousand million people in the world  
And you say there's just one  
The only one, and you must be together  
And if they love you the pain is so sweet  
And it just gets better and better  
And if they don't  
You want them more than ever  
  
When you're in love  
You don't know much about it  
Not in your mind  
Romantic love  
Rots the brain,  
No doubt about it  
You're out of your mind,  
You're out of your mind
