Go baby driver  
Been drivin' on down the road  
Oh, what a rider  
Carryin' such a heavy load  
Don't ever need to know direction  
Don't need no tow, food, gas, no more  
  
Go baby driver  
Don't want to sleep alone  
Ooh, what a rider  
Push that pedal to the floor, yeah  
Nobody knows where you're goin'  
Nobody cares where you've been  
And if you want to hear some stories  
Exit girl, we'll let you in  
I mean let you in  
  
Go baby driver  
Ooh, what a rider  
Go baby driver, ooh you can pull  
Oh, baby driver, you've been drivin' too long  
Go baby driver, go baby driver  
Ooh, what a rider, you've been ridin' so long  
Go baby driver, go baby driver  
  
Don't ever sleep much past the sunrise  
Too much of nothin', nothin', nothin like that, oh  
Go baby driver, go baby driver  
Go baby driver, go baby driver  
Go baby driver, ooh, what a rider  
Go baby driver, come on  
  
Go baby driver, go baby driver  
Go baby driver, go baby driver  
Go baby driver, go baby, go, go (she's got the car)  
Go baby driver, go baby, go, go (ooh what a rider)  
Go baby driver, go baby, go, go  
(Ooh, she's can go a hundred miles an hour)  
  
Go baby driver, go baby, go, go (oh, baby driver, ooh yeah)  
Go baby driver, go baby, go, go (push that pedal to the floor)  
Go baby driver, go baby, go, go (all the way down)  
Go baby driver, go baby, go, go (gun it mom, I'm runnin')  
Go baby driver, go baby, go, go (yeah)
