For your precious love means more to me  
Than any love could ever be  
For when I wanted you I was so lonely and so blue  
For that's what love will do  
  
Darling, I'm so surprised,  
Oh, when I first realized  
That you were fooling me  
Darling, they say that our love won't grow  
  
I just want to tell them that they don't know  
For as long as you, long as you are loving me  
Our love will grow wider, deeper than any sea  
And all the things in the world, in this whole wide world  
Is just that you would say that you'd be my girl  
  
(Wanting you) Wanting you, (I'm lonely and blue) whoa, lonely  
That's what love will do  
  
For your precious love means more to me  
Than any love could ever be  
For when I, I wanted you I was so lonely and so blue  
That's what love will do
