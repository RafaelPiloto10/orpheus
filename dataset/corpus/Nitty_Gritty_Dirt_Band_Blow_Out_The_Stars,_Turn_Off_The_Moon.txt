Here on the hilltop where we fell in love  
Many moons later, now we're giving up  
I start the engine, you start to cry  
It's a beautiful memory but a sad sad goodbye.  
  
How many times have we wished on a star,  
Wrapped up in a quilt on the hood of my car  
We saw Halley's comet in lunar eclipse  
And I sure saw heaven when I tasted your lips.  
  
So blow out the stars, turn off the moon  
Fade out the crickets and the nightingale's tune  
Take down the magnolias that ride the soft wind  
Another love story has come to an end  
  
When our love was new as the first evening star  
We both said I'll worship you just as you are  
Then I tried to change you, girl, and I don't know why  
You tried to change me, hey we might as well try.  
  
To blow out the stars, turn off the moon  
Fade out the crickets and the nightingale's tune  
Take down the magnolias that ride the soft wind  
Another love story has come to an end.  
  
Take down the magnolias that ride the soft wind  
Another love story has come to an end
