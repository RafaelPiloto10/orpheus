Great North Special, would you all board  
You can't find a ride like that no more  
The night the chariot swung down low  
Ninety-nine children had a chance to go  
One long party from front to end  
Tune to the whistle going round the bend  
No great hurry, what do you say?  
  
Might as well to be every way  
Might as well, might as well, might as well, might as well  
Might as well, might as well, might as well, might as well  
Might as well, might as well, might as well  
  
Ragtime slowly for twenty-five miles  
Then switch over to the cajun style  
Bar car blowing rhythm and blues  
Rock 'n' roll wailing in the old caboose  
Long train running from coast to coast  
Bringing home a party when you need it the most  
Work on the box car, beat on the bell  
Nothing else shaking so you might just as well  
  
Might as well, might as well, might as well, might as well  
Might as well, might as well, might as well, might as well  
Might as well, might as well, might as well  
  
Never had such a good time in my life before  
I'd like to have it one time more  
Whoa! One good ride from start to end  
I'd like to take that ride again, again!  
Ran out of track and I caught the plane  
Back in the county with the blues again  
Great North Special been on my mind  
I might like to ride it just one more time  
  
Might as well, might as well, might as well, might as well  
Might as well, might as well, might as well, might as well  
Might as well, might as well, might as well
