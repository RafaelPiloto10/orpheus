I'm Frank Sinatra in a rock 'n roll band  
I'm a hevayweight demon with a heavyweight plan  
I'm Uncle Sam with a joint in my mouth  
And my V8's floored when I headed down south  
This ain't hell, sure ain't heaven  
Pull on over to the Seven Eleven  
Stop Rich now, Pontiac here  
Big blue love Budweiser beer  
Can't you see them  
Can't you see them  
GI Joe I'm Stretch Armstrong  
Every blade of grass I'm the water in the bong  
I'm aqua man I'm the devil with a grin  
Ambidextrous now 'cause I use both limbs  
East Palo Alto, age 26  
Full love circle not one love missed  
A1 liquor, Berone's too  
Crown Royal, No. 502  
Can't you see them  
Can't you see them  
August 27th on a calendar scale  
And on this day I went to jail  
The blue man on my trip and on my ride  
See I gotta go and will I survive  
I'm the man and I do and I don't  
I'm the man and I will and I won't  
I'm the man and I could not lie  
Why most should live now some should die
