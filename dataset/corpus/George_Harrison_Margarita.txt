Margarita, ah  
Margarita, ah  
Ooh  
  
It was in pittsburgh late one night  
I lost my hat, got into a fight  
I rolled and tumbled till I saw the light  
Went to the big apple, took a bite  
  
Still the sun went down your way  
Down from the blue into the gray  
Where I stood I saw you walk away  
You danced away  
  
I asked her what were gonna do tonight  
She said cahuenga langa-langa-shoe box soup  
We better keep tryin till we get it right  
Tala mala sheela jaipur dhoop  
  
She wrote a long letter on short piece of paper  
Oh margarita dont stay away too long  
Come on home  
Oh margarita dont say you will when you wont  
Margarita
