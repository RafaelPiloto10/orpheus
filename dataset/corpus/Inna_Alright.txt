[Hook:] x2  
In my life everything is alright  
Everything is alright  
Everything is alright, yeah  
  
When I'm really high  
Don't know why  
In my dreams, in my life  
Time is passing little bit fast.  
When life goes bad, I don't know  
Where to hide, where to go  
I don't really care about the past.  
  
And I say!  
  
[Bridge:] x2  
Oh, I fall in love  
With your body fall in love  
Oh, I say I fall in love  
I love you and I mean it.  
  
[Hook:] x4  
In my life everything is alright  
Everything is alright  
Everything is alright, yeah  
  
[Bridge:] x2  
  
[Hook:] x4  
In my life everything is alright  
Everything is alright  
Everything is alright, yeah
