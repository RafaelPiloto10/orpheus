She's got friends in high places, her picture's in vogue  
She's seen at the races and walking the dog  
She swallows the camera, she follows the press  
She covers the angles, she's dressed for success  
  
She don't bring me water  
She don't give me food  
All that she got is a real attitude  
  
Her mood swings are violent, it can't be denied  
She kisses the bridegroom and disses the bride  
Godfather's baby who gets every wish  
She drinks with the family, she's taking the fifth  
  
She don't bring me water  
She don't give me food  
All that she got is a real attitude
