I had that something from my head to my eye  
Just as I made it to the front of the line.  
I only seen them out in front of the rehab.  
My buddy's check form is all blown to sag.  
And just because I'm spoonfed on milo and cheese  
Don't go shooting every dog just 'cause one of us got fleas.  
And if you don't want to grow wear some  
Baby clothes  
Baby clothes  
Baby clothes  
Baby clothes  
Baby clothes  
Baby clothes  
Baby clothes  
Baby clothes.  
  
And I'm so sick of sickness yeah  
Why do I write the songs so dickless yeah.  
A just cause I'm too fat on cheap smokes and wine  
I can't look over your fat shoulder and make rock 'n' roll mine.  
Been hearing so much chitter chatter chitter chatter  
And now I found something that matters, matters, matters, matters.  
But if you don't want to grow wear some  
  
Baby clothes  
Baby clothes  
Baby clothes  
Baby clothes  
Baby clothes  
Baby clothes  
And if the bar is closed  
I don't want to know
