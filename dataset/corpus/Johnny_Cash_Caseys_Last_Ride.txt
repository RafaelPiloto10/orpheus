Casey joins the hollow sound  
Of silent people walking down  
The stairway to the subway  
In the shadows down below  
  
Following the footsteps  
Through the neon darkened corridors  
Of silent desperation  
Never speakin' to a soul  
  
The poisoned air he's breathin'  
Has the dirty smell of dyin'  
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine  
And it's never felt the rain  
  
But Casey minds the arrows  
And ignores the fatal echoes  
Of the clickin' of the turnstile  
And the rattle of his chain  
  
"Oh!" she said  
"Casey it's been so long since I've seen you"  
"Here" she said  
"Just a kiss to make a body smile"  
  
"See" she said  
"I've put on new stockings just to please you"  
"Lord" she said  
"Casey can you only stay a while?"  
  
Casey leaves the underground  
And stops inside the Golden Crown  
For something wet to wipe away  
The chill that's on his bones  
  
Seein' his reflection  
In the lives of all the lonely men  
Who reach for anything they can  
To keep from goin' home  
  
Standing in the corner  
Casey drinks his pint of bitter  
Never glancin' in the mirror  
At the people passin' by  
  
Then he stumbles as he's leavin'  
And he wonders if the reason  
Is the beer that's in his belly  
Or the tear that's in his eye  
  
"Oh!" she said  
"I suppose you seldom think about me"  
"Now" she said  
"Now that you've a family of your own"  
  
"Still" she said  
"It's so blessed good to feel your body"  
"Lord" she said  
"Casey it's a shame to be alone"
