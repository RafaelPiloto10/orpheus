You say it's time to leave now babe I can't believe  
That you have the strength to go now  
I won't stand in your way I'd be standing there all day  
Ain't that something we both know now  
You play your games but the fact remains  
I'm the only one that can hold your reins  
  
Didn't I bring your love down  
Didn't I bring your love down all night  
  
If you think you need a change well I'm sure we can arrange  
For you to get on your own for a while  
But I don't need to worry 'cause you'll get back in a hurry  
I know that you like my style  
You play your games but the fact remains  
I'm the only one that can hold your reins  
  
Didn't I bring your love down  
Didn't I bring your love down all night
