[Chorus]  
Lady loves to hang on  
Lady liked a real intellectual  
Sweet sister your still shaking  
And your tragedy is never ending  
Silver shoes you're wearing  
Every window that you've ever stared in  
Over my head, over my head  
  
Sidewalks of the city  
And every theater there you've ever played  
Your comic book impersonations  
Your wish for cinders embers to keep  
Over my head, so it' all  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Out in the street for just one more matinee  
Yes, your vaudeville carries on  
So put a smile in front your man can see  
Yes, your vaudeville carries on  
  
[Chorus]
