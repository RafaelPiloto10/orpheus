And if your baby leaves you  
And you got no place to go  
Oh, you come and see me darlin'  
And bring along some dough  
And we'll go honky-tonkin', honky-tonkin'  
We'll go honky-tonkin', honey, baby  
We'll go honkin'-tonkin' 'round this town  
And you and your old man  
You have a fallin' out  
Well, you come and see me darlin'  
And we'll go steppin' out  
And we'll go honky-tonkin', honky-tonkin'  
We'll go honky-tonkin', honey, baby  
We'll go honkin'-tonkin' 'round this town  
Well, I'm headin' out to the city  
Oh, to the city fair  
If you wanna do the boogie, babe  
You can meet me there  
We'll go honky-tonkin', honky-tonkin'  
We'll go honky-tonkin', honey, baby  
We'll go honkin'-tonkin' 'round this town  
Oh, we goin' honkin'-tonkin', honky-tonkin'  
Honky-tonkin', honey, baby  
We'll go honkin'-tonkin' 'round this town
