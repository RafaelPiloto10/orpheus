All my life, without a doubt I give you  
All my life, now and forever till the  
Day I die, you and I will share  
  
All the things this changing world can offer  
So I sing, I'd be happy just to  
Stay this way, spend each day, with you  
  
There was a time, that I just thought  
That I would lose my mind  
You came along and then the sun did shine  
We started on our way  
I do recall that every moment spent  
Was wasted time but then I chose to lay it on the line  
  
I put the past away  
I put the past away  
I put the past away  
  
All my life, I will carry you through  
All my life, between each hour of the passing days  
I will stay with you  
  
There was a time, that I just thought  
That I would lose my mind  
You came along and then the sun did shine  
We started on our way  
I do recall that every moment spent  
Was wasted time then I chose to lay it on the line  
  
I want this all my life  
I want this all my life  
I want this all my life  
I want this all my life  
I want this all my life  
I wanted this all my life
