As I lay here with you  
The shame lies with us  
We talk of love and trust  
That doesn't matter  
  
Though we may be the last in the world  
We feel like pioneers  
Telling hopes and fears  
To one another  
  
And oh what a feeling  
Inside of me  
It might last for an hour  
Wounds aren't healing  
Inside of me  
Though it feel good now  
I know it's only for now  
  
The feeling is intense  
You grip me with your eyes  
And then I realize  
It doesn't matter
