Those cocky little fires you started in the night  
The independent claims that just meant "Hold me tight"  
The bruises on your body that you swore were from a fight  
I'll pass at your insistence  
Alsatians fall unconscious at the shadow of your call  
One glance from your direction and the government will fall  
Whole continents of misery don't bother you at all  
But for me you have persistence  
  
[Chorus]  
Run all day, run all night  
Do or die, do or die  
Got to run for your life  
Do or die, do or die  
  
I'd like to leave so would you kindly look the other way  
You tell me to be honest but I've nothing left to say  
Just like your feet my goddess, my brain has turned to clay  
An end to all resistance  
  
[Chorus x 3]  
Run all day, run all night  
Do or die, do or die  
Got to run for your life  
Do or die, do or die
