Meet me at the market  
Where you bought me out  
Closely examine  
The contact point of the  
Opposing rams  
  
Now we are playing optical hopscotch  
  
Now we are over here  
Sketching the field of the spies  
  
Front me a coroner's allotment  
I'll not fail to return  
An exact earth pinprick  
  
Now we are engaged in optical hopscotch  
  
What's left of our vision?  
Our swimming vision?  
Of what division?  
  
Look!
