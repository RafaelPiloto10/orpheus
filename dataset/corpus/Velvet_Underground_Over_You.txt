Here I go again  
Just gonna play it like a fool again  
Here I go again  
Over you  
Over you  
I'm just like a bell again  
You know, I'm starting to ring again  
Here I go again  
Over you  
Over you  
Typically, when I had it  
Treated it like dirt  
Now, naturally, when I don't have it  
I am chasing less and less rainbows  
Here we go again  
I guess, I'm like a fool again  
Here I go again  
Over you  
Over you  
Over you  
Over you  
...
