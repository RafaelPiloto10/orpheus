Lyrics:bosson, music: bosson  
Gonna tell the world that I've fallen for you  
I've got a secret, I can't hold it back anymore  
I've got to share it with everyone I know  
It's a lifetime waiting for someone like you  
I'm falling, a feeling too good to be true, so true  
I write you a song on the radio  
I want them to know that I'll die for you  
Chorus:  
This is the right time, oh oh this is the moment  
I'm gonna tell the world that I've fallen for you x2  
I never thought that, there was a space inside me  
But you found it, a place where you wanted to be  
I'm happy, you gave me time to see  
I'm falling, for the first time I feel that I'm free  
I write you a song on the radio  
I want them to know that I'll die for you  
Chorus  
I'll write you a poem in the magazine  
I'll buy some time in the 7 o'clock news  
I run through the city naked shout and scream  
Heeyoo heyoooooo  
I'll drop some flyers from an aeroplane  
I'm making a movie where I'm singing in the rain  
I send out the message to the outer space  
Calling earth, ground control, do you read me?  
I read you, over  
We've got a small problem up here  
We found a guy who says he's got a message for the world  
I think he's really fallen in love...over and out  
Chorus  
Ohooo heeyooooo  
Ohooo can't hold it back no more  
Ohooo heeyooooo  
Ohooo gonna tell the world  
Chorus
