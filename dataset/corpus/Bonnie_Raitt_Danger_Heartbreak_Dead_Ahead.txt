When you give more than you get, you're in danger (you're in danger)  
You may find that you're in love with a stranger (with a stranger)  
For who knows what evil lurks within the hearts of men?  
It's vanity, insanity to play when you can't win  
When you find that you're losing, it's time to get on moving  
'Cause there's danger, heartbreak dead ahead  
  
It only takes one second, girl, to learn (to learn)  
That playing with fire will get you burned (get you burned)  
Now girl, don't you be foolish  
They say that love is blind, but it's clear as the highway sign  
That reads Danger, heartbreak dead ahead  
Heartbreak dead ahead  
  
Read the sign, girl, you'd better mind, girl  
Yeah, danger, heartbreak dead ahead  
  
Once the lying starts, start packing up your heart  
Listen to me, girl  
When there's nothing to be gained, don't keep goin' on in vain  
'Cause there's danger, heartbreak dead ahead  
I said there's danger, I said there's danger
