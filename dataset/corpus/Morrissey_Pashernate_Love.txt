Pashernate love  
In any form  
Whether real or a dream  
  
Pashernate love  
Could make your system erupt  
Into wild blisters and boils  
  
Oh, as for me  
It still doesn't understand me  
It wouldn't lay one single finger on me  
  
Pashernate love  
Could make your Grandmother zoom  
Roller-skating back from the grave  
  
Pashernate love  
Could make your old Daddy feel  
Like he may have a reason to live  
  
Oh, as for me  
It still doesn't understand me  
And it wouldn't lay one single finger on me  
  
I'm always there  
It's always elsewhere  
  
Whoah, Pashernate love  
Oh, where are you?  
Where are you?  
Where are you?  
Where are you?  
Where are you?  
Where are you?  
Where are you?  
Where are you?  
Where are you?  
Where are you?  
Where are you?  
Where are you?
