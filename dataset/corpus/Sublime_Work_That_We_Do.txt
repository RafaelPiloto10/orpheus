Well we realized so long, long ago, and I bet you,  
That we've seen it all, the lies won't get you.  
I've got fourteen miles to go,  
I've got rhythm comin' sense I've got the sto.  
But I won't wanna come around our love. So why?  
If you are rich, I'm gonna hang you on the wall.  
  
I'ma find you.  
And when I find you, I'm gonna get your lovin' arms today.  
So we fight to get, we fight to get our weary arms to bed.  
Real love's something that I still hope people make there own places to go.  
And now in '94 were gonna lie some more.  
In 1994 were going to die some more.  
It it ever going to be the last show?  
It's going to be the last drive,  
Boss to proud to make the cars that we drive.  
The women don't mind, I've got ample time,  
They don't wonder why that they do.  
  
That's work that we do, a work that we do is work that we do.
