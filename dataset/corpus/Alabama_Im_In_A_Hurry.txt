Chorus:  
  
I'm in a hurry to get things done  
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun  
All I really got to do is live and die  
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why  
  
Don't know why  
I have to drive so fast  
My car has nothing to prove  
It's not new, but it'll do 0 to 60 in 5.2  
  
Chorus  
  
Can't be late  
That leaves me plenty of time  
Shakin' hands with the clock  
I can't stop, I'm on a roll and ready to rock  
  
Chorus  
  
I hear a voice  
It says I'm runnin' behind  
I better pick up my pace  
It's a race and there ain't no room  
For someone in second place  
  
Break  
  
Chorus
