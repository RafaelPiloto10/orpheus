It's a marshmallow world in the winter  
When the snow comes to cover the ground  
It's the time for play, it's a whipped cream day  
I wait for it the whole year round  
  
Those are marshmallow clouds being friendly  
In the arms of the evergreen trees  
And the sun is red, like a pumpkin head  
It's shining so your nose won't freeze  
  
Oh, the world is your snowball, see how it grows  
That's how it goes, whenever it snows  
The world is your snowball just for a song  
Get out and roll it along  
  
Oh, it's a yum-yummy world made for sweethearts  
Take a walk with your favorite girl  
It's a sugar date, what if spring is late  
In winter it's a marshmallow world
