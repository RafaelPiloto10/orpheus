You tell me your friends are distant  
You tell my your man's untrue  
You tell me that you've been walked on  
And how you feel abused  
  
So you stand here an angry young woman  
Taking all the pain to heart  
I hear you saying you want to see changes  
But you don't know how to start  
  
Love will find a way (How do you know)  
Love will find a way (How can you see)  
I know it's hard to see the past and still believe  
Love is gonna find a way  
I know that  
Love will find a way (A way to go)  
Love can make a way (Only love can know)  
Leave behind the doubt  
Love's the only out  
Love will surely find a way  
  
I know this life is a strange thing  
I can't answer all the whys  
Tragedy always finds me  
Taken again by surprise  
  
I could stand here an angry young woman  
Taking all the pain to heart  
But I know that love can bring changes  
And so we've got to move on  
  
If our God His Son not sparing  
Came to rescue you  
Is there any circumstance  
That He can't see you through
