Ain't love a strain  
Ain't it a pain in your heart  
Ain't worth the trouble anyhow  
I'd like to give it up  
I've had enough and I've done my part  
But I'm in too deep to pull out now  
  
Good things we've had are going bad  
And I don't know why  
I'd turn it around if I knew how  
I'm pushing aside all of my pride and it's worth a try  
'Cause I'm in too deep to pull out now  
  
[Chorus:]  
We need to get our love back on its feet again  
We've come to far to let it come to an end  
  
What can I do  
I'm in to you up over my heart  
And I've tried all that I know how  
Doing all I can  
I can't stand to see us fall apart  
And I'm in too deep to pull out now  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I can't step aside and let you  
Slide right out of my life  
It will cause more hurt than the law will allow  
I'll get us back on the track  
And it will be all right  
'Cause I'm in too deep to pull out now  
  
'Cause I'm in too deep to pull out now
