There's a hole where my heart should be  
And baby only you can fill this emptiness in me  
There's a hole where my heart should be  
So baby wrap it up, pack it up  
Bring your lovin' back to me  
Chorus  
Everytime that we're apart  
I close my eyes and I  
I can't help think of you  
But girl unless you're in my arms  
It's just not feeling right  
The telephone won't do  
The space is killing me  
It just won't let me be  
And just the thought of you girl  
Can make me weak  
I feel so incomplete  
I'm looking at your photograph  
I dream I'm holding you  
I dream I'm kissing you  
But girl your picture never kisses back  
It's just not good enough  
I need your human touch  
Everyone can see  
What's missing here with me  
And just the thought of you girl  
Can make me weak  
I feel so incomplete  
Chorus (2x)  
Girl I'm a million miles from heaven  
Cause heaven is wherever you are  
I need you to feel alive again oh
