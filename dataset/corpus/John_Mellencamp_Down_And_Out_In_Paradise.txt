Dear Mr. President  
I live in the suburbs  
It's a long way from Washington, D.C.  
Had me a job  
Working for wages  
And they forgot about me  
Can't draw unemployment  
For some unknown reason  
My kids are hungry  
I've got four mouths to feed  
I go out everyday lookin' for suitable  
Employment  
Do you think, there's something  
You could do for me  
'Cause I'm...  
  
Down and out, here in paradise  
Down and out, and I'm on my knees  
I'm down and out, here in paradise  
Looks like the milk and honey  
Done run out on me  
  
Dear Mr. President  
I used to be a dancer  
Got a little bit too old  
So I became a secretary  
Married as man  
In Las Vegas, Nevada  
And ten years later  
He run out on the kids and me  
Some said, I was pretty  
But those days are over  
Now, I've no place to live  
And I'm out on the streets  
Oh, Mr. President  
Can I tell you a secret  
I never ever thought, that this could  
Happen to me  
'Cause I'm...  
  
Down and out, here in paradise,  
Down and out, and I'm on my knees  
I'm down and out, here in paradise  
Looks like the milk and honey  
Done run out on me  
  
Dear Mr. President  
I'm just a young kid  
I'm in the fourth grade  
At riley elementary  
My Mom and Dad's been actin' funny  
I'm not sure  
If it ain't got something to do with me  
My Daddy's always drunk  
My Mom's a babysitter  
And I don't like the Russians  
.Cause I hear, they hate me  
Dear Mr. President  
Can I ask you one question?  
When the bombs fall down  
Will they hurt everyone in my family  
Yeah, yeah  
  
Down and out, here in paradise  
Down and out, and I'm on my knees  
I'm down and out, here in paradise  
Looks like the milk and honey  
Done run out on me
