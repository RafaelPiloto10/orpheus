A trust betrayed a rusty blade  
Standing on edge  
I walked a line, paid my fine  
Hope I know the ledge  
Actual facts, unnatural acts, sins they take their toll  
The angel and the jinn and the beast within, the fight to take control  
Chorus  
Lord, have mercy on my soul  
On my soul, on my soul, on my soul  
Lord, I need ya like a junkie needs his drugs  
Need ya like a baby boy needs his hugs  
Need ya like a flower needs the sun  
I need you like D.M.C needs Run  
Chorus  
Love you like a Eskimos love the cold  
Love you like a miner man love his gold  
Love you like a fisherman love the sea  
Love you like the flowers love the bees  
Chorus  
Standing up tall on top of the wall  
Hoping I can fly Angel and the jinn  
and the beast within' say I'm gonna die  
Chorus
