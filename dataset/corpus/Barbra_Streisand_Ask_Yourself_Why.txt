When you're just out walking and you pass  
Little signs that say "keep off the grass"  
Did you ever stop and ask yourself why?  
Pretty playgrounds children used to know  
Little squares where lovers love to go  
Disappear so parking lots can grow  
Why?  
  
Once you start the questions never cease  
What's disturbed when you disturb the peace  
Pets and children are prohibited  
  
Why? ask yourself why?  
And when you think about it  
Bullets fly like popcorn on the screen  
Recommended wholesome nice and clean  
Making love's the thing that can't be seen  
Why?  
  
Let your hair down just an inch or two  
Let your skin be red or green or blue  
They invent a special name for you  
Why?  
  
On a clear day oh say can you see  
What remains of mountain's scenery  
Catch a glimpse of all the scenery, sky,  
Beautiful sky ..as shiny as a penny  
So when you're out walking and you pass  
Near a sign that say "keep off the grass"  
Put a sign right next to it that says "why?"
