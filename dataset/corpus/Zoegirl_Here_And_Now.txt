Here and now  
And now and now  
And now and now  
And now and now  
And now and now  
Here and now  
And now and now  
And now and now  
And now and now  
Here I am, you made it all so clear  
I understand, I am just a stranger here  
I leave it all behind  
All that's left is gone  
And I know about my mind  
Straight into your arms  
Here and now we will stand with one voice hand in hand  
We will never back down, we will never give in  
Here and now we will sing with one voice and we bring  
Our life as an offering we bring you everything  
Give me all the depth of the sweetest dreams which follow that I see  
You are eternal, eternal life  
Where could I, where could I, where could I go  
But I got you in the light with everybody's side  
Lord its clear when I needed day and night  
So leave it all behind  
To all that's left is gone  
And we'll go with all our might  
Straight into your arms  
Here and now we will stand with one voice hand in hand  
We will never back down we will never give in  
Here and now we will sing with one voice and we bring  
Our life as an offering we bring you everything  
Lord I give my life  
No matter what it takes  
'Cause you gave it all for me  
With all of our hearts we sing  
With all of our joy we bring  
Everything we will bring  
Our everything, everything  
Here and now we will stand with one voice hand in hand  
We will never back down we will never give in  
Here and now we will sing with one voice and we bring  
Our life as an offering we bring you everything  
Here and now we will stand with one voice hand in hand  
We will never back down we will never give in  
Here and now we will sing with one voice and we bring  
Our life as an offering we bring you everything  
Here and now  
Here and now  
Here and now
