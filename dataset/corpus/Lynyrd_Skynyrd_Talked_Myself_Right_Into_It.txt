Alarm Clock ring about a quarter after five  
I've been up all night raisin' hell  
With some friends of mine  
I take one good look in the mirror  
But only one things gettin' clearer  
The way I live I'm lucky to be alive  
  
There I go lying to myself  
Said I wasn't gonna do it  
Next thing ya know  
Here I go again  
Talked myself right into it  
  
Supposed to be to work an hour ago  
When I passed that boss stormin' down the road  
Now there's an angel on my shoulder  
Thinkin' she can win me over  
The Devil's got my number don't you know  
  
There I go lying to myself  
Said I wasn't gonna do it  
Next thing ya know  
Here I go again  
Talked myself right into it  
Maybe, Maybe, have I gone too far this time  
Maybe, Maybe, is my conscience workin' overtime, nah  
  
There's a knockout Georgia peach givin' me the eye  
Well if the truth be known I'm just a little shy  
Turns out she wasn't alone  
She had a six foot chaperon  
But that didn't slow me down  
Don't ask me why  
There I go lying to myself  
Said I wasn't gonna do it  
Next thing ya know  
Here I go again  
I got no one to blame except myself  
Said I wasn't gonna do it  
Next thing ya know  
Here I go again  
Talked myself right into it  
Talked myself,  
Talked myself right into it  
Talked myself, talked myself  
Talked myself right  
Said I wasn't gonna do it  
Talked myself, talked myself  
Talked myself right into it  
Talked myself, talked myself  
Talked myself right into it
