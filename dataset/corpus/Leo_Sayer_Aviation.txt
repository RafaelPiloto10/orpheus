(T. Clarke)  
  
He was working for the airline one day  
And out on the street the next  
The company always came first with him  
She came second best  
His life was aviation  
He was rising fast  
They let him go  
He became  
A victim of the past  
She lost her job the same month  
At "Fashions For You"  
She lost her chance of ever seeing Paris  
Lost the baby too  
They took all their belongings  
And managed to get a loan  
And put it all into this broken down building  
That called itself a restaurant  
He waits tables  
She does the cooking  
He can remember  
Seeing her look so beautiful  
And now she is just fading away  
She waits tables  
He does the cooking  
They don't owe nobody nothing  
If there's a God up there in heaven  
Must have lost his touch  
Maybe he's out to lunch  
His life was aviation  
He was rising fast  
But who needs expert in fuel conservation  
When the planes are out of gas  
He still reads "Aviation"  
When he has the time  
And if he gets to talk to God he's gonna  
Give him a piece of his mind, yeah  
He waits tables  
She does the cooking  
He can remember  
Seeing her look so beautiful  
Now she's just fading away  
She waits tables  
He does the cooking  
They don't owe nobody nothing  
If there's a God up there in heaven  
He must have lost his touch  
Maybe he's out for lunch  
He waits tables  
She does the cooking  
He can remember  
Seeing her look so beautiful  
Now she is just fading away  
She waits tables  
He does the cooking  
They don't owe nobody nothing  
If there's a God up there in heaven  
Maybe he's not to blame  
Maybe he's changed his name
