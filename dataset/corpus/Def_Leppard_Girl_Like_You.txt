Boy meets girl in prime of life  
Blinded by big city lights  
I'm on fire and you're the flame  
You inspire the road I take  
You take me to a better place  
You're the sun and I'm the rain  
  
You're all that I need to make me believe  
I'm over the edge but I'm not afraid  
Cause I know it's true  
  
With a girl like you (like you) to be by my side  
With a girl like you, love me for the inside  
With a girl like you I set the scene to follow  
With a girl like you, love for all tomorrow  
With a girl like  
You  
  
You were raised to be so good  
I grew up misunderstood  
We were distant worlds apart  
Feels so right it's meant to be  
Shootin' stars and chemistry  
They unite a beating heart  
  
You're pullin' me up, I can't get enough  
Comin' on strong but I'm not that tough  
But I know it's true  
  
With a girl like you (like you) to be by my side  
With a girl like you, love me for the inside  
With a girl like you I set the scene to follow  
With a girl like you, love for all tomorrow  
With a girl like  
  
You  
You  
  
With a girl like you (like you) to be by my side  
With a girl like you, love me for the inside  
With a girl like you I set the scene to follow  
With a girl like you, love for all tomorrow  
With a girl like  
You
