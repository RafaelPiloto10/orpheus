I believe in the wonder,  
I believe this new life took in,  
Like a God that I'm under,  
There's drugs running through my veins,  
I believe in the wonder,  
I believe I can touch the flame,  
There's a spell that I'm under,  
Got to fly, I don't feel no shame,  
  
The world is mine,  
The world is mine,  
The world is mine,  
The world is mine,  
  
Take a look what you've started,  
In the world flashing from your eyes,  
And you know that you've got it,  
From the thunder you feel inside,  
I believe in a feeling,  
Of the pain that you left to die,  
I believe in the livin'  
In life that you give to try,  
  
The world is mine,  
The world is mine,  
The world is mine,  
The world is mine,  
Mine,  
Mine,  
The world is mine,  
  
I've lost my fear to what appears,  
I do my best,  
The world is mine,  
You take the price and realize,  
That's in your eyes,  
The world is mine,  
I've lost my fear to what appears,  
I do my best,  
The world is mine,  
You take the price and realize,  
That's in your eyes,  
The world is mine,  
  
The world is mine,  
The world is mine
