You shoot me down in flames  
You put me down a lot  
But I'm giving you my heart  
Go on take it  
Please be careful not to break it  
Just remember it's the only one I've got  
It's the only one I've  
  
Don't break my heart  
Don't break my heart  
Don't break my heart  
  
You make me laugh a lot  
And buy me silly things  
And I'd rather be with you than anyone else  
But if you make me mad, but if you make me mad  
you'll wish that you had not  
You'll wish that you had not  
  
Don't break my heart  
Don't break my heart  
Don't break my heart  
  
Where are the roses and whispered sighs  
Where are the compliments and dreaming eyes  
It doesn't matter you see  
I know you love me  
And real basic love never dies  
  
Don't break my heart  
Don't break my heart  
Don't break my heart  
  
Where are the roses and whispered sighs  
Where are the compliments and dreaming eyes  
It doesn't matter you see  
I know you love me  
And real basic love never dies  
  
Don't break my heart  
Don't break my heart  
Don't break my heart
