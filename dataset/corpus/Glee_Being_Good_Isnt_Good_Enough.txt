Being good isn't good enough  
Being good won't be good enough  
When I fly, I must fly extra high  
And I'll need special wings so far to go  
From so far below  
  
Should I try?  
Am I strong enough?  
Is there time, have I long enough?  
Gotta fly and if I fall  
That's the way it's gotta be  
There's no other way for me  
Being good just won't be good enough  
I'll be the best or nothing at all  
  
I'll try, am I strong enough?  
Is there time, have I long enough?  
Gotta fly and if I fall  
That's the way it's gotta be  
There's no other way for me  
Being good just won't be good enough  
I'll be the best or nothing at all
