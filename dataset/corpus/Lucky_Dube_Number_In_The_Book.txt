No glove, no love  
You've been hearing this so many times  
Don't you think it's time  
To be a little more responsible  
Too many people die these days, oh  
If you read the papers, check out the news  
The numbers are there  
Every number, represents a human being  
Who was a father, who was a mother  
A son or a daughter of this land...oh  
You don't make the commitment but your body does  
Even if you're dead silent  
  
[Chorus:]  
You are here today, tomorrow you are gone  
You don't want to be another number in the book (x3)  
  
In the shadows of the night  
A lady from the street corner talks to a customer  
Money exchanges hands  
That's the formality and she says  
No glove, no love  
You can pay me well, but it ain't worth my life  
Too many people die these days  
If you read the papers, check out the news  
The numbers are there  
Every number, represents a human being  
Who was a father, who was a mother  
A son or a daughter of this land...oh  
It ain't worth my life...oh
