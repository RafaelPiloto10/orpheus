In the heat of the violence  
The night's exploding everywhere  
When hate pulls the trigger  
The devil comes to take his share  
  
In the garden of Eden  
The time is running out so fast  
Into heart of the demon  
With no escape our die is cast  
  
In the city of angels  
Death is just a moment away  
In the city of angels  
Your future won't see the light of the day  
  
Beware of the alien nation  
Beware of the truth that they seek  
They pray for eternal salvation  
They pray for your soul to keep  
  
On the eve of destruction  
A reign of terror rules the street  
When the heads start rolling  
The devil comes to let it bleed  
  
In the city of angels  
Death is just a moment away  
In the city of angels  
Your future won't see the light of the day  
  
Walk on past the alien nation  
Walk on to the end of your reach  
No fear of the alien nation  
No fear of the hatred they preach  
  
Don't run, there's no place to hide  
Today or tomorrow it will get you  
Don't move, the knife is right at your throat  
And whatever you do, there's no way out  
  
When the shroud comes down on this place  
To bury us all alive  
We'll know the time has come, to face the heat  
  
Beware of the alien nation  
Beware of the truth that they seek  
They pray for eternal salvation  
They pray for your soul to keep  
  
Walk on past the alien nation  
Walk on to the end of your reach  
They pray for eternal damnation  
They pray for your soul to keep
