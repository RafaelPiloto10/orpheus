When they opened the gates  
We emerged from the dark  
There was no turning back  
We go straight for your throat  
  
Our time has come  
Through the wars of the damned  
We bring darkness and death  
To your sacred land  
  
See that look in your eye  
Like a long lost child  
But your reign had to end  
You're a poison and dead  
  
Our time is here  
Through the wars of the damned  
We bring darkness and death  
To your dying land  
We lasted throughout  
Despite holy lies  
Impotent to deny  
  
Rege Satanas Satan's reign  
Rege Satanas Satan's reign  
  
The extinction of sin  
Broken churches lay bare  
Now their mental oppression  
Saying nought but prayers  
  
Our time is about  
Through unholy wars  
You are over and out  
Damned day walkers  
  
Rege Satanas Rege Satanas  
Rege Satanas Rege Satanas  
Satanas Satanas Satanas Satanas  
Satanas Satanas Satanas Satanas  
Satanas Satanas Satanas Satanas  
Satanas Satanas Satanas Satanas
