Is that you?  
Is that  
Is that really you?  
To call between my lips  
Two kangaroo fingers push  
Through and scratch my back in rhythm  
  
Slow foot  
Slow fast  
Waiting for a night to wrap around us  
I could go in there  
Get some sweet stuff  
  
All these things  
In me (in me)  
All these things  
In me (in me)  
  
Is that you?  
Is that  
Is that really you?  
To hold beneath my skin  
Two numbers click between her touch  
When you pull me down into them  
Rising and rising  
[through the inside of a glass eye painting]  
Calling me in there  
Get that sweet stuff  
  
All these things  
In me (in me)  
All these things  
In me (in me)  
  
Vocoder stuff [did you walk around the stairs?]  
  
Is that you?  
Is that  
Is that really you?  
To crawl between my lips  
Two kangaroo fingers push  
Through and scratch my back in rhythm  
  
Slow foot  
Slow fast  
Waiting for a night to wrap around us  
I could go in there  
Get some sweet stuff  
  
All these things  
In me  
All these things  
In me
