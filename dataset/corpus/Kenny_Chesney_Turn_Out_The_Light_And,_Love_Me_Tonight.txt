Well I've been lonesome  
I've been empty  
I got an aching  
Way deep down inside  
And I need someone  
Someone to hold me  
Pull down the shade, turn out the light and love me tonight  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't think about tomorrow  
It don't matter anymore  
We can turn the key and lock the world outside the door  
I need you so now  
Come on let go now  
Kick off your shoes, turn out the light and love me tonight  
  
Well don't you worry  
We're all alone now  
So let your hair down  
Come sit by my side  
And turn off the TV  
Put on some music  
Pull down the shade, turn out the light and love me tonight  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I need you so now  
Come on let go now  
Pull down the shade, turn out the light and love me tonight
