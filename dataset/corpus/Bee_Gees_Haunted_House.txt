I know baby's bad for my self-esteem.  
Find another face for your sympathy.  
Some of us cry, some of them lie,  
but no one sees inside.  
  
The spark of baby's eyes and I turn to stone.  
Maybe I can't survive in the danger zone.  
Sounds of the night.  
Streets without light.  
And baby's not alone.  
  
Try to hold her to myself.  
Someone else is breaking all my dreams. She  
needs so many games to play.  
One more time I climb the stairs.  
Open up the door and she was gone.  
  
And baby here I go,  
like a lamb to slaughter.  
  
Don't stop haunting me in this old house (like a lamb to slaughter).  
I still love you when you're not around.  
I'm still waiting for your midnight ride (like a lamb to slaughter).  
I'll still love you when it's cold outside.  
Me so sorry that I let you down (like a lamb to slaughter).  
But you keep haunting me in this old town.  
  
And the smile is no longer there.  
The face and the eyes and the hair.  
Nothing stands the test of time.  
You live forever, never mine.  
I cling to dreams that turn to sand.  
Our life is now a distant land.  
  
We commit emotional suicide.  
Every single room is electrified.  
Your memory shadowing me.  
The house where sorrow hides.  
  
Pull it down, blow it up.  
Help me send these walls of love away.  
  
And baby here I go,  
like a lamb to slaughter.  
  
Don't stop haunting me in this old house (like a lamb to slaughter).  
I still love you when you're not around.  
I'm still waiting for your midnight ride (like a lamb to slaughter).  
I'll still love you when it's cold outside.  
Me so sorry that I let you down (like a lamb to slaughter)  
But you keep haunting me in this old town.  
  
(Like a lamb to slaughter)  
Don't stop haunting me in this old house (like a lamb to slaughter).  
I still love you when you're not around
