When The Morning Sun Streaks Across My Room  
And I'm Waken Up From Another Dream Of You  
When I'm On The Road, Once Again It Seems  
All that's Left Behind, Is A Chain Of Broken Dreams  
But You Know I Love You  
Yes I Love You, Oh.... I Love You....  
How I Wish That Love, was all We Need To Live  
What A Life We'd Have, Cause I've Got So Much To Give  
But It Seems So Wrong, Deep Inside My Heart  
That The Dollar Sign Should Be Keeping Us Apart  
But You Know I Love  
Yes I Love You.....Ohhh I Love You  
And If Only I Could Find My Way Back To The Time  
When The Problems Of This Life it Did not Cross your Minds  
And All The Answers could be Found In Children's Nursery Rhymes  
And I'd Come Running Back To You, I'd Come Running Back To You  
But You Know We Can't Live On Dreams Alone  
And To Pay The Rent, I Must Leave You All Alone  
And Though I Made My Choice Many Years Ago  
And now This Traveling Life Is The Only One I Know  
But You Know I Love You  
Yes I Love You, Oh I Love You  
But You Know I Love You  
Yes I Love You, Oh I Love You...
