Even the bad times are good  
If there's a chance that your heart misses  
The words I try to say with kisses  
If I don't seem to look as happy  
As I should  
I don't want to live without you  
I love everything about you  
Yes, even the bad times are good  
Your middle name should be perfection  
For that's what you are to me  
Even in my darkest moment  
You made it easier to see  
I wouldn't change one thing about you  
If I knew that I could  
Yes, even the bad times are good  
Your middle name should be perfection  
For that's what you are to me  
Even in my darkest moment  
You made it easier to see  
I wouldn't change one thing about you  
If I knew that I could  
Yes, even the bad times are good  
Even the bad times are good
