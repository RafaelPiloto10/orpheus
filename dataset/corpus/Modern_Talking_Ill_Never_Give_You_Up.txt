Oh, I'll Never Give You Up - I'll Never Give You Up  
I'll Never Give You Up - My Promise Lasts Forever  
I'll Never Give You Up - I'll Never Give You Up  
I'll Never Give You Up - We Tie Our Dreams Together  
  
Oh, I Got What I Want - But, I Lost What I Had  
A Slave To Your Love - Oh, You'll Drive Me Mad  
Oh, Whatever May Be - My Baby And Me  
Oh, I'll Miss You Like Crazy - My Destiny  
I'm Talking To Myself - I Can't Let You Go  
We're Gonna Make It, Baby - I Know  
  
It's Higher Than Heaven - This Love Is No Lie  
Oh, I Promise You This Love Is No Goodbye  
If You Love Him Girl, I Will Sleep Beside  
All The The And Motion, My Baby Can't Hide  
I'll Never Be So Wrong - Please Don't Say Goodbye  
We Are Gonna Make It - Give Us One More Try  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, Baby I Know - That I'm Hurting You So  
Can't Stand The Pain - Oh, I Can't Let You Go  
I'll Never Forget You - There Will Be A Day  
There Will Never Be A Girl - Who Looked At Me This Way  
  
Oh, I'll Never Find Just What I Am Searching For  
But, My Love For - Just Can't Ignore  
Oh, What Are You Doing With The Rest Of Your Life?  
Oh, Without Your Love - I Cannot Survive
