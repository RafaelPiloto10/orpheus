Hey now baby whatcha gonna do when I go?  
Hey now baby who ya gonna do when I'm gone?  
As I watched you from above  
Bodiy glistened while I listened  
To you screaming out his name in love  
Oh no no  
Hey now baby whatcha gonna do when I go?  
Hey yeah they say you love the girl  
While I'm wasted as you taste it  
Wicked pleasures, sins of flesh and blood  
Woke up drunk in the morning  
Sipping on my cup all day  
Stone cold bitch you're ballin'  
And I bet that you want to stay  
Well you go down to the city  
And you get yourself in line  
Cause if I don't need you baby  
I'll catch you another time  
Get This!  
Hey now baby whatcha gonna do when I go?  
Hey now baby who ya gonna do when I'm gone?  
Hey now baby whatcha gonna do when I go?  
Hey now baby who ya gonna do when I'm gone?  
I'm asking whatcha gonna do!
