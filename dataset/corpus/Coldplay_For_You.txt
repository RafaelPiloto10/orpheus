If you're lost and feel alone  
Circumnavigate the globe  
All you ever have to hope for two  
  
And the way you seem to float  
Circumnavigate in hope  
And they seem to lose control  
With you  
  
Everyone of us is hurt  
And everyone of us is scarred  
Everyone of us is scared  
Not you  
  
Your eyes closed  
Your head hurts  
Your eyes feel so low  
  
Everyone of us is scared  
Everyone of us is hurt  
Everyone of us has hope  
  
For you  
X10
