I don't tell anyone about the way you hold my hand  
I don't tell anyone about the things that we have planned  
I won't tell anybody, won't tell anybody  
They wanna push me down, they wanna see you fall down  
  
Won't tell anybody that you turn the world around  
I won't tell anyone that your voice is my favorite sound  
I won't tell anybody, won't tell anybody  
They wanna see us fall, they wanna see us fall down  
  
I don't need a parachute baby if I've got you  
Baby, if I've got you I don't need a parachute  
You're gonna catch me, you're gonna catch if I fall  
(Down, down, down)  
  
Don't believe the things you tell yourself so late at night  
You are your own worst enemy, you'll never win the fight  
Just hold on to me, I'll hold onto you  
It's you and me up against the world, it's you and me  
  
I don't believe anything, don't trust anyone anymore  
But I believe you when you say we're never gonna fall  
Hand behind my neck, arm around my waist  
Never let me hit the ground, you'll never let me crash down  
  
I don't need a parachute baby if I've got you  
Baby, if I've got you I don't need a parachute  
You're gonna catch me, you're gonna catch if I fall  
(Down, down, down)  
  
I don't need a parachute baby if I've got you  
Baby, if I've got you I don't need a parachute  
You're gonna catch me, you're gonna catch if I fall  
(Down, down, down)
