Oh sometimes I go walkin' through fields where we walked  
Long ago in the sweet used to be  
And the flowers still grow but they don't smell as sweet  
As they did when you picked them for me  
And when I think of you and the love we once knew  
How I wish we could go back in time  
Do you ever think back on old mem'ries like that or do I ever cross your mind  
[ fiddle - mandolin ]  
Do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night  
Cause you miss me do you darling  
Oh and do your mem'ries ever take you back into another place in time  
And do you ever miss the feelings and the love we shared  
When you were with me tell me darling or do I ever cross your mind  
[ guitar ]  
Oh how often I wish that again I could kiss your sweet lips like I did long
ago  
And how often I long for those two lovin' arms that once held me so gentle and
close  
And when I think of you and the love we once knew  
How I wish we could go back in time  
Do you ever recall these old mem'ries at all or do I ever cross your mind  
Tell me darling do I ever cross your mind
