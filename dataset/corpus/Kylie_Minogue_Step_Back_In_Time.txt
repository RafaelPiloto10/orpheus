I want to funk  
I want to f-f-you f-you-n-k  
  
[Repeat: x 2]  
I want to funk, I want to funk  
I want to f-f-you f-you-n-k  
  
Non stop dancing the bus stop  
To the funky music  
Hustle, pumpin the muscle  
Blame it on the boogie  
  
Remember the old days  
Remember the O'Jays  
Walkin' in rhythm, life was for livin'  
  
[Chorus]  
When you can't find the music  
To get down and boogie  
All you can do is step back in time  
Ball of confusion  
When nothing is new, and  
There's nothing doin', step back in time  
  
Keep on truckin' along  
Riding on a love train  
And then we can float on  
You'll never go wrong  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Step back in time  
Step back  
I want to step back, step back  
  
[Chorus until fade]
