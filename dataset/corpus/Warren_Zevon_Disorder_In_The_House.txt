Disorder in the house  
The tub runneth over  
Plaster's falling down in pieces by the couch of pain  
  
Disorder in the house  
Time to duck and cover  
Helicopters hover over rough terrain  
  
Disorder in the house  
Reptile wisdom  
Zombies on the lawn staggering around  
  
Disorder in the house  
There's a flaw in the system  
And the fly in the ointment's gonna bring the whole thing down  
  
The floodgates are open  
We've let the demons loose  
The big guns have spoken  
And we've fallen for the ruse  
  
Disorder in the house  
It's a fate worse than fame  
Even the Lhasa Apso seems to be ashamed  
  
Disorder in the house  
The doors are coming off the hinges  
The earth will open and swallow up the real estate  
  
I just got my paycheck  
I'm gonna paint the whole town grey  
Whether it's a night in Paris or a Fresno matinee  
  
It's the home of the brave and the land of the free  
Where the less you know the better off you'll be  
  
Disorder in the house  
All bets are off  
I'm sprawled across the davenport of despair  
  
Disorder in the house  
I'll live with the losses  
And watch the sundown through the portiere
