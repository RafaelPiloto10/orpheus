What did you say  
I know I saw you saying it  
My ears won't stop ringing  
Long enough to hear  
Those sweet words  
What did you say  
  
And now the day  
The hour hand has spun  
Before the night is done  
I just have to hear  
Those sweet words  
Spoken like a melody  
  
All your love  
Is a lost balloon  
Rising up through the afternoon  
'Til it could fit on the head of a pin  
  
Come on in  
Did you have a hard time sleeping  
'Cause a heavy moon was keeping you awake  
And all I know is I'm just glad to see you again  
  
See my love  
Like a lost balloon  
Rising up through the afternoon  
And then you appear  
  
What did you say  
I know I saw you saying it  
My ears won't stop ringing  
Long enough to hear  
Those sweet words  
And your simple melody  
  
I just have to hear  
Your sweet words  
Spoken like a melody  
I just want to hear  
Those sweet words
