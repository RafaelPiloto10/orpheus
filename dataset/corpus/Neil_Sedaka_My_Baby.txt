My baby, my baby, my baby, my baby  
  
Wait till you see my baby  
You won't believe your eyes  
And if you think there's no such thing as an angel  
You're in for a surprise  
  
Wait till you see my baby, gee whizz she's out of this world  
And out of all the boys that she could have chosen  
She want to be my girl  
  
(What about her hair) Her hair is gold like the sunlight  
(What about her eyes) Her eyes are diamonds that shine  
(What about her lips) Her lips are redder than rubies  
This treasure is mine  
  
She took my heart to heaven  
Now I'm in paradise  
And if you doubt me wait till you see my baby  
You won't believe your eyes  
  
(What about her hair) Her hair is gold like the sunlight  
(What about her eyes) Her eyes are diamonds that shine  
(What about her lips) Her lips are redder than rubies  
This treasure is mine  
  
My baby, my baby, my baby, my baby  
  
Repeat and fade
