There was a time  
When crazy days would start with wine  
And now I tow a different line  
I stay in bed and use my loaf instead of my bread  
And stroll on 'cos I've been thinking so long  
That something's gonna go wrong  
It's gone to my head my vision's all blurred  
And my legs feel like lead  
  
But I'm clean yeah  
Friends with Mr Sheen yeah  
Don't have to wean myself up on nothing  
I'm two minutes clean and that's not very often  
Stroll on  
  
There was a time  
When I would dread what I had said  
Waking up in someone's bed  
Wondering who I was  
Naked and cold  
With an ache in my head  
And stroll on 'cos I've been thinking so long  
That's something's gonna go wrong  
It's gone to my head my vision's all blurred  
And my legs feel like lead  
  
But I'm clean yeah  
Friends with Charlie Sheen yeah  
Don't have to wean myself up on nothing  
I'm two minutes clean and that's not very often  
  
I'm clean yeah  
Gonna meet the queen yeah  
I won't be obscene yeah  
'Cos I'm two minutes clean and that's not very often  
Stroll on and on and on and on and on  
Oh yeah
