There's a party in Harlem, come on  
  
I like to reminisce about that night we kissed  
It was somewhere one night in Harlem  
The nights were hot and bright  
You could treat your honey right  
?Cause Sylvia's would burn all night  
  
The people there were really something  
(You know that's right)  
The music always kept us jumping  
And it used to knock me down  
When Smokey came to town  
(And the miracles, please)  
My favorite song was "Tears Of A Clown", oh yeah  
  
There ain't nothing like them nights in Harlem  
They really shake the funk up there  
Tonight I'm gonna stomp in Harlem  
And I'm gonna take my baby back  
To the heart of Harlem  
  
Big sister had a group  
And they'd sit out on the stoop  
And Lordy could they harmonize (Oh yeah)  
My cousin Joe could blow  
Just like the radio  
And he used to drove them "B" girls wild  
  
But when grandma started happy dancing  
(Oh, she gon' break somethin')  
She really turned the mother out  
I like the way they do it up in Harlem  
When there's a party up in Harlem  
That's what it's all about  
  
Ain't nothing like them nights in Harlem  
They never fake the funk up there  
I met my Cherie Amour in Harlem  
And tonight I'm gonna take her back to the 'pollo  
  
There's a party in Harlem  
They say that all the stars will be there  
Everyone is going to Harlem  
Harlem is a party and everybody's going there  
  
Follow me visually, ?cause I usually be all around  
Originally everybody headed uptown  
Finessing the fly way you ?cruisin in your car  
On the West Side to the highway, East Side D-R  
And yes, we are about to set it  
Forget it, I thought you knew  
The Apollo is where I had to go with my crew  
From BMW's to my daddy's Cadillac  
He had the sunroof top wit the diamond in the back  
Check the ambiance, the place a renaissance  
Who frontin' nonchalant up in the restaurant  
What you really really want, we grabbin' by the clutch  
Precise can flaunt with this and never too much  
It's such a love flow, high but natural  
The thug's a no-show, and drugs a no-no  
The only thing that they was shootin' was pool  
While Harlem nights was right, the party was cool  
  
Nothing like them nights in Harlem  
They really shake the funk up there  
Tonight I'm gonna stomp in Harlem  
I'm gonna take my baby back to the heart of Harlem  
  
Nights in Harlem  
They never fake the funk up there  
I met my Cherie Amour in Harlem  
Back to the Harlem Apollo  
  
Nights in Harlem  
They don't let you fake the funk up there  
Tonight I'm gonna stomp in Harlem  
I'm gonna take my honey  
Back to the Harlem Apollo  
  
Nights in Harlem  
They really shake the funk up there  
Tonight I'm gonna stomp in Harlem  
I'm gonna take my baby  
Back to the Harlem Apollo
