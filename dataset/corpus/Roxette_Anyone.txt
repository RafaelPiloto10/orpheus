Anyone who have a love close to this  
Knows what I'm saying  
Anyone who wants a dream to come true  
Knows how I'm feeling  
All I can think of is you and me  
Doing the things I want to do  
All I imagine is heaven on earth  
I know it's you  
  
Anyone who ever kissed in the rain  
Knows the whole meaning  
Anyone who ever stood in the light  
Needs no explaining  
But everything more or less appears so meaningless  
Blue and cold  
Walking alone through the afternoon traffic  
I miss you so  
  
Anyone who felt like I do  
Anyone who wasn't ready to fall  
Anyone who loved like I do  
Knows it never really happens at all  
It's over when it's over  
What can I do about it  
Now that it's over  
  
Everything more or less is looking so meaningless  
And fades to grey  
Lying awake in an ocean of teardrops  
I float away  
  
Anyone who ever felt like I do  
Anyone who wasn't ready to fall  
Anyone who loved like I do  
Knows it never really happens at all  
It's over when it's over  
What can I do about it  
Now it's all over
