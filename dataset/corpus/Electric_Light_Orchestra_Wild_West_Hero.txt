Sometimes I look up high  
And then I think there might,  
Just be a better life  
Away from all we know  
That's where I wanna go  
Out on the wild side,  
And I wish I was  
Oh oh oh oh, a wild west hero.  
  
Ride the range all the day  
Till the first fading light  
Be with my western girl  
Round the fire oh so bright  
I'd be the indians' friend  
Let them live to be free  
Ridin' into the sunset  
I wish I could be.  
  
I'd ride the desert sands  
And through the prairie lands  
Tryin' to do what's right  
The folks would come to me  
They'd say we need you here  
I'd stay there for the night,  
Oh I wish I was  
Oh oh oh oh, a wild west hero  
  
Ride the range all the day  
Till the first fading light  
Be with my western girl  
Round the fire oh so bright  
I'd be the indians' friend  
Let them love to be free  
Ridin' into the sunset  
I wish I could be.
