Friday night, I'm on my way home  
They oughta make work a crime  
I'm home for the weekend  
I'm gonna make the most of my time  
There's a rock and roll singer on the television  
Giving up his music, gonna take up religion  
Deserted rock and roll  
To try to save his soul  
  
Saturday night, gotta gig with the band  
Playing the electric guitar  
Someday I'm gonna make it  
Gonna be a super-duper-star  
Get a flashy car  
And a house for my Ma  
The big break better happen soon  
'Cause I'm pushing twenty-one  
  
Just like Cinderella  
When she couldn't go to the ball  
A voice said, "I'm your fairy manager  
You shall play the Carnegie Hall"  
I gotta give up my day job  
To become a heartthrob  
I may go far if I smash my guitar  
  
Away for the weekend  
I've gotta play some one-night stands  
Six for the tax man, and one for the band  
Back in the studio to make our latest number one  
Take two-hundred-and-seventy-six  
You know, this used to be fun  
  
Monday morning, I just got home  
Six and the birds are singing  
I need a drink and my clothes are wet  
Ooh, and my ears are still ringing  
There's a rock and roll singer boppin' on the TV  
He used to be a preacher, but now he sings in a major key  
Amended his decision to the new religion
