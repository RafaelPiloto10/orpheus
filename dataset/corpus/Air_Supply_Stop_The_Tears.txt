I stopped seeing all of our old friends  
I don't go to places that you've been  
I stopped talking about you  
Started living without you  
But there's just one thing, I don't understand  
  
How do I stop the tears  
How am I supposed to deal with this  
How do I stop the tears  
Do I get over you in a week or two  
When I been lovin' you for years  
  
Everybody thinks that I'm so strong  
They don't know what I go through when I'm alone  
I start thinkin' about you  
Goin' crazy without you  
But I stop myself and I hang up the phone  
  
How do I stop the tears  
How am I supposed to deal with this  
How do I stop the tears  
Do I get over you in a week or two  
When I been lovin' you for years  
  
One day, you'll call me up goin' crazy  
Too late you'll want me back  
You'll be sayin', you'll be saying  
  
How do I stop the tears  
How am I supposed to deal with this  
How do I stop the tears  
Do I get over you in a week or two  
When I been lovin' you for years
