Come on take my hand  
Come on little stranger  
The spirits are angry  
Stay away from danger  
This is insanity  
This could be the end  
This is insanity  
Farewell my friend  
  
[Chorus]  
In the garden of serenity  
In the garden of serenity  
In the garden of serenity  
In the garden of serenity  
  
Meet me in the graveyard  
We'll walk among the dead  
On a midnight odyssey  
Riding in my head  
  
I'm not your enemy  
Girl, I am your friend  
Come with me on a journey  
On a journey to the end
