When you hear twin fiddles and a steel guitar  
You're listenin' to the sound of the American heart  
And opry music on a Saturday night  
Brings a smile to your face and a tear to your eye  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Sing a song about the Heartland  
The only place I feel at home  
Sing about the way a good man  
Works until the daylight's gone  
Sing the rain on the roof on a summer night  
Where they still know wrong from right  
Sing a song about the Heartland  
Sing a song about my life
