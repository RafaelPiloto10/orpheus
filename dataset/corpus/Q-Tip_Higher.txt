Take you (higher)  
Hit you (higher)  
Make you (higher)  
Hit you (higher)  
Take you (higher)  
  
I don't know what to make of this  
Funny brothers on my nerves type ridiculous  
I guess I really gotta do it  
Put my game down  
Hold the game you fucking blew it  
Put my name down  
And it seems you fucked up like a drug deal gone wrong  
Figured out a lot, you won't be that way long  
Plus, you niggas is bush leaguers  
And I bet y'all ain't get no bush either  
My hood dogs sing songs of rejection and pain  
If we get sunshine, it's followed up by rain  
Like to lay your jig down and get a blessing of brains  
My man Skeet so he stressing your chain  
We see the 'morrow through the shades of it might not come  
Got to get it all now 'cause we might be done  
Matrix, nigga (nigga) you looking at the one  
Fortified with a bonafide blastin' of a gun  
We in the space for positionin'  
Money and illiciting  
Living out our lives while certain cats just lookin' in  
We bewildered off the sacks and the green  
Whether the bay, L.A., or Chicago or Queens  
You better raise your game  
They comin' at you high  
You better raise your game  
Don't ask no questions why, nigga  
Then speak figuratively, I mean this shit  
And speak literally, you in some shit  
  
(Higher) take you  
(Higher) hit you  
(Higher) make you  
(Higher) hit you  
(Higher)  
  
I dominate flows  
I dominate shows  
And, in the night time our dominance grows  
And, you could see from the posture I'm holding  
Yo, I'm re-ing up while the rest is folding  
A hip hop cat who's flown world wide and  
Experience, adventures like Poseidon  
Bunk heads with r and b chicks  
Give 'em one hit joints and they lookin' for the remix  
The shit that I spit like plain clothes days  
Surprised you legit make your whole team freeze  
I'm so irregular  
Ear on the cellular  
Let's celebrate 'cause your man is a hell of a  
Fillin' the blank with a good thing to fill in  
We hold it still 'cause we walkin' with still (chance)  
Blindsided up in your own reality  
While we in the heat of the moment, fuck morality  
I really wanna see you rise to my joint ma (ma)  
I'm lookin' straight don't see your eyes get my point ma (ma)  
However you do it, I'm doing you back  
Yo, don't misconstrue it, 'cause I'm screwing it back  
Yo, rappers better count my presence as they down time  
I gotta move around, don't have no fuck around time  
So, you better just get on back  
Just (incoherent scats) abst'act  
  
Hey yo, (higher) take you  
(Higher) hit you  
(Higher) make you  
(Higher) hit you  
(Higher)  
  
Uh, uh, higher, we gettin' higher  
Yeah, higher  
  
Yo, one more time  
I don't know what to make of this  
Funny brothers on my nerves type ridiculous  
I guess I really gotta do it  
Put my game down  
Hold the game you fuckin' blew it  
Put my name down  
And it seems you fucked up like a drug deal gone wrong  
Makin' out a lot, you won't be that way long  
Yeah yeah, plus, y'all niggas is bush leaguers  
And I bet y'all ain't gettin' no bush either  
And I bet y'all ain't gettin' no a-hoop either
