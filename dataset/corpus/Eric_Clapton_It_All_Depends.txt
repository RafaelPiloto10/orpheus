So you think you are something special  
I wonder why, baby, is that so  
Could admit, you are something special  
Won't you tell me, girl? I'd love to know  
  
Yes, I've seen you with your other girlfriends  
I can tell they really think you're fine  
And I've seen you with your other men friends  
They don't know if you're a love of mine  
  
[Chorus:]  
It all depends on how you feel, baby.  
I've got to know just how you feel, baby.  
It all depends on how you feel, baby.  
I've got to know just how you feel, baby.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
'Cause you've taken away  
The only thing I ever ever had.  
Don't you know that I love you?  
Why'd you make me feel bad?  
'Cause the only thing I ever loved  
Was loving you.  
  
So you think you are something special  
I wonder why, baby, is that so  
Could admit, you are something special  
Won't you tell me, girl? I'd love to know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So you think you are something special...  
  
What makes you think you are something special?
