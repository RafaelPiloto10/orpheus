Come to mama 'cause you know  
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba  
In the middle of the night  
When the last sheep jumps through my head  
Why shut out the light?  
When I know I'm gonna wake up again  
In crumpled sheets  
There is no silhouette  
To the sight of me  
It's much to cold in this bed  
  
Oooooohhhh,  
I miss my baby  
Oooooohhhh,  
I miss my baby  
Oooooohhhh,  
I miss my baby  
Oooooohhhh,  
I miss my baby  
  
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba  
I turn on my side  
And I can hear myself breathe  
It's pretty quiet outside  
I miss the sound of you next to me  
When you talk in your sleep  
And you mention my name  
I close my eyes to remember  
But it's just not the same  
  
Oooooohhhh  
I miss my baby  
Oooooohhhh  
I miss my baby  
Oooooohhhh (Ooh, I miss him)  
I miss my baby  
Oooooohhhh (in the middle of the night)  
I miss my baby  
  
Can't pet your head all with the covers to your chin  
And watch you kick them off again  
Can't watch you sleep in the light  
From the slit in the door  
And what I can't have  
It makes me want it even more  
It makes me want it even more  
Ba, ba, ba, ba  
  
Oooooohhhh  
I miss my baby  
Oooooohhhh  
I miss my baby  
Oooooohhhh (in the middle of the night)  
I miss my baby (in the broad daylight)  
Oooooohhhh (oh, I miss you)  
I miss my baby  
Oooooohhhh (oh, I miss you, miss you)  
I miss my baby  
Oooooohhhh (in the middle of the night)  
I miss my baby  
Oooooohhhh (gonna kiss you)  
I miss my baby  
Oooooohhhh (in the broad daylight)  
I miss my baby
