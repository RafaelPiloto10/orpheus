Talent:  
I'm tired of listening and reading about cats that claim they can rap  
When all they talk about is hoes, money they ain't got and heat that  
They can't pack so just face the facts all yall is whack nigga my little  
Brother could rip all yall on a track my bass thump so loud it will flip  
All yall on ya back so you could turn in your grave my rhymes so hot  
That before you start reading them they burn in your face so now you  
Know that your whole journey's a waste you can hang up freestlyling  
Before they turn your way and then just turn you away......  
  
(Chorus)x2  
Fake niggas  
Two faced niggas  
Couldn't come out with nonthing hotter than this if I gave you two days  
Niggas  
Can't stand gay niggas  
Owe me money but don't pay niggas  
If you really want to know the truth I think all you cats is fake niggas.  
  
Talent:  
I hope none of yall trying to get a record label you could barley get  
A job at a low class resturaunt trying to set the tables nigga who set your  
Goals better yet who set your fables you jelous of me uh oh another  
Kane and Able but this time it's the opposite I'm the freestyle king  
Ain't no one stopping it yall come on here and just start popping lips  
Think you bad cause you claiming folk, slobs, or crips that's a negative  
Hiv is the only thing about you that's positive you need to stop your  
Lyrics cause they getting norrogitive I'm similar to a puzzle piece and  
Ain't nobody solving this gotta let you know that fake niggas is my  
Only problem snitch......  
  
(Chorus)x2  
Fake niggas  
Two faced niggas  
Couldn't come out with nonthing hotter than this if I gave you two days  
Nigga  
Can't stand gay niggas  
Owe me money but don't pay niggas  
If you really want to know the truth I think all you cats is fake niggas
