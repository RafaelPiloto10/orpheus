Hey Louisiana woman, Mississippi man  
We get together every time we can  
The Mississippi River can keep us apart  
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart  
Too much love in this Louisiana heart  
  
See the alligators all a waitin' nearby  
Soon or later they know I'm gonna try  
When she wave from the bank don't you know I know  
It's goodbye fishin' line see you while ago  
With a Louisiana woman waitin' on the other side  
The Mississippi River don't look so wide  
  
Louisiana woman, Mississippi man  
We get together every time we can  
The Mississippi River can keep us apart  
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart  
Too much love in this Louisiana heart  
  
Well I thought I'd been loved but I never had  
Till I was wrapped in the arms of a Mississippi man  
When he holds me close it feels almost  
Like another hurricane just ripped the coast  
If he can't come to me, I'm gonna go to him  
That Mississippi River Lord, I'm gonna swim  
  
Hey Louisiana woman, Mississippi man  
We get together every time we can  
The Mississippi River can keep us apart  
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart  
Too much love in this Louisiana heart  
  
Well Mississippi River Lord it's one mile wide  
And I'm gonna get me to the other side  
Mississippi man, I'm losin' my mind  
Gotta have your loving one more time  
I'm gonna jump in the river and here go  
Too bad alligator you swim too slow  
  
Hey Louisiana woman, Mississippi man  
We get together every time we can  
The Mississippi River can keep us apart  
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart  
Too much love in this Louisiana heart
