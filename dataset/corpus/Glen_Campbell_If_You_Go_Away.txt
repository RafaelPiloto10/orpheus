If you go away on this summer day then you might as well take the sun away  
All the birds that flew in the summer sky  
When our love was new and our hearts were high  
When the day was young and the nights were long  
  
And the moon stood still for the night bird's song  
If you go away if you go away if you go away  
But if you'll stay I'll make you a day like no day has been or will be again  
We'll sail the sun we'll glide on the rain we'll talk to the trees and worship
the wind  
  
Then if you go I'll understand leave me just enough love to fill up my hand  
If you go away if you go away if you go away  
If you go away as I know you will you must tell the world to stop turning  
'Til you return again if you ever do for what good is love without loving you  
  
Can I tell you now as you turn to go I'll be dying slow to the next hello  
If you go away if you go away if you go away  
If you go away as I know you might there'll be nothing left in the world to
trust  
Just an empty room full of empty space like the empty look I see on your face  
  
I have been the shadow of your shadow  
If I thought it might have kept me by your side  
If you go away if you go away if you go away  
But if you'll stay I'll make you a night like no night has been or will be
again  
  
I'll sail on your smile I'll glide on your touch I'll talk to your eyes that I
love so much  
But if you go I know I will cry and all the good is gone from the words
goodbye  
If you go away if you go away if you go away please don't go away
