Thunder cracks, the sky is crying  
On her back she's pushing trying  
He holds her hand and kneels beside her bed  
Break the silence baby screaming  
In slow motion she ain't dreaming she closed her eyes looked  
Up to God and says  
  
Chorus  
Should I cry a little more  
Should I try a little more  
I'd pay the cost and laugh it off  
I'd do it all a thousand times again  
No Regrets  
Living's hard and dying's easy  
My mistakes they won't defeat me  
I like to burn the candle at both ends  
I've broke some hearts been broken hearted  
I've run away from fires I've started  
I didn't break but tried my best to bend  
  
Chorus  
Should I cry a little more  
Should I try a little more  
I'd pay the cost and laugh it off  
I'd do it all a thousand times again  
No Regrets  
  
No regrets-for things I've done  
No regrets-for wars I've won  
No regrets-for fires I've started  
No regrets-for faith departed  
Should I cry a little more  
Should I die a little more  
Should I lie a little more  
Should I get high a little more  
  
Should I cry a little more  
Should I try a little more  
I'd pay the cost and laugh it off  
I'd do it all a thousand times again  
No Regrets
