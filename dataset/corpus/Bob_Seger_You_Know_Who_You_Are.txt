It looked like it  
It felt like it  
But in the end it was just a show  
With good acting  
Fine acting  
Too bad the sponsers had to go  
And you know who you are  
Poor production  
Poor direction  
All the beautiful sad cliche's  
The sound was bad  
I couldn't hear you  
But then what were we doing on the stage  
And you know who you are  
Oh yeah  
Tell me if it feels like the key  
Well it's easy too easy  
Cause when I saw you there  
With your eyes in the air  
Ahh  
Everything we done we done before  
Somehow it seemed to make a little more sense  
It was such a close call I think that's why I'm writing this at all  
I'd call out your name loud  
You really don't think it would make any sense  
Cause you know who you are
