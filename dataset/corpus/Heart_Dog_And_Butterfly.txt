There I was with the old man  
Stranded again so off I'd ran  
A young world crashing around me  
No possibilities of getting what I need  
He looked at me and smiled  
Said "No, no, no, no, no child  
  
See the dog and butterfly  
Up in the air he likes to fly."  
Dog and butterfly  
Below she had to try  
She roll back down to the warm soft ground, laughing  
She don't know why, she don't know why  
Dog and butterfly  
  
Well I stumbled upon your secret place  
Safe in the trees you had tears on your face  
Wrestling with your desires frozen strangers  
Stealing your fires, the message hit my mind  
Only words that I could find  
  
See the dog and butterfly  
Up in the air he like to fly  
Dog and butterfly below she had to try  
She roll back down to the warm soft ground  
Laughing to the sky, up to the sky  
Dog and butterfly  
  
We're getting older the world's getting colder  
For the life of me I don't know the reason why  
Maybe it's livin' making us give in  
Hearts rolling in taken back on the tide  
We're balanced together ocean upon the sky  
  
Another night in this strange town  
Moonlight holding me light as down  
Voice of confusion inside of me  
No begging to go back where I'm free  
Feels like I'm through  
Then the old man's words are true  
  
See the dog and butterfly  
Up in the air he like to fly  
Dog and butterfly, below she had to try  
She roll back down to the warm soft ground  
With a little tear in her eye  
She had to try, she had to try  
Dog and butterfly
