Imagine the love  
Of a child for his toys,  
The love of a bird  
For it's mate,  
Imagine the love  
Of a miser for gold,  
Then imagine a love  
Twice as great.  
If you multiply each love  
A million times more,  
It won't be half the love  
That a mother has for:  
Baby shoes, baby shoes,  
Mother will never forget them,  
You have forgotten  
When your feet were bare,  
Mother remembers,  
She still has a pair  
Of baby shoes, baby shoes,  
To keep them,  
The world she'd refuse.  
If she had to choose,  
Her life she would lose,  
Before she'd part with her  
Baby's shoes.  
Baby shoes, baby shoes,  
Mother will never forget them,  
You have forgotten  
When your feet were bare,  
Mother remembers,  
She still has a pair  
Of baby shoes, baby shoes,  
To keep them,  
The world she'd refuse.  
If she had to choose,  
Her life she would lose,  
Before she'd part with her  
Baby's shoes.  
  
Alone in the attic  
She fondles those shoes,  
And wonders  
Where her boy has gone,  
And over his shoes  
She is saying a pray'r,  
That the good Lord  
Will keep him from harm.  
In her heart  
There is gladness,  
Tho' her eyes are wet,  
Because Mother remembers,  
Tho' you may forget:  
Baby shoes, baby shoes,  
Mother will never forget them,  
You have forgotten  
When your feet were bare,  
Mother remembers,  
She still has a pair  
Of baby shoes, baby shoes,  
To keep them,  
The world she'd refuse.  
If she had to choose,  
Her life she would lose,  
Before she'd part with her  
Baby's shoes.  
Baby shoes, baby shoes,  
Mother will never forget them,  
You have forgotten  
When your feet were bare,  
Mother remembers,  
She still has a pair  
Of baby shoes, baby shoes,  
To keep them,  
The world she'd refuse.  
If she had to choose,  
Her life she would lose,  
Before she'd part with her  
Baby's shoes.
