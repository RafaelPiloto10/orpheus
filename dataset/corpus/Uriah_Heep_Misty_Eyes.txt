I was missing my  
Little Miss Misty Eyes  
She made my life complete  
I'd been waiting on  
True love's sweet surprise  
And it tasted so sweet  
Oh it tasted so sweet  
  
I could hear  
The sound of the love bell  
Told me all it could tell  
And the sight of  
The blue moon rising  
Told me all was well  
Told me all was well  
  
I was just driftin'  
As a wind blown wave  
Like a stricken ship  
I thought I'd never be saved  
So far below me  
There seemed so much more  
Yet a man has to know  
What he's looking for  
  
Something unknown  
Kept my life turning around  
But I couldn't get near to  
Putting my feet on the ground  
With all that I had  
Any man would be glad  
But my everything was nothing  
So what made me sad  
  
I was missing my  
Little Miss Misty Eyes  
She made my life complete  
I was waiting on  
True love's sweet surprise  
And it tasted so sweet  
It tasted so sweet  
  
Farewell to that same lonely road  
I've seen the last of  
That heavy load  
No more blues about paying dues  
It's time for reaping  
All the seeds I sowed
