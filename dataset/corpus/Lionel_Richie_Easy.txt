Know it sounds funny  
But, I just can't stand the pain  
Girl, I'm leaving you tomorrow  
Seems to me girl  
You know I've done all I can  
You see I begged, stole, and I borrowed! (yeah)  
  
Ooh that's why I'm easy  
I'm easy like Sunday morning  
That's why I'm easy  
I'm easy like Sunday morning!  
  
Why in the world would anybody put chains on me?  
I've paid my dues to make it  
Everybody wants me to be  
What they want me to be  
I'm not happy when I try to fake it! no!  
  
Ooh that's why I'm easy  
I'm easy like Sunday morning  
That's why I'm easy  
I'm easy like Sunday morning!  
  
I wanna be high, so high  
I wanna be free to know  
The things I do are right  
I wanna be free  
Just me! Whoa, oh! Babe!  
  
That's why I'm easy  
I'm easy like Sunday morning, yeah  
That's why I'm easy  
I'm easy like Sunday morning, whoa  
'Cause I'm easy  
Easy like Sunday morning, yeah  
'Cause I'm easy  
Easy like Sunday morning
