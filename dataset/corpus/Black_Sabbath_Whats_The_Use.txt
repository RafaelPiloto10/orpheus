What's the use of paradise or everyday of livin'?  
They spend and learn in Heaven, sin in Hell  
  
What's the point of children  
When evil got before them?  
They learn in every tale we tell  
  
There's no point in being kind  
What's the use when love becomes an evil of the mind?  
  
Oh Yeah!  
  
What's the use of power  
When the battle isn't equal  
And we're all too Scared to use it anyway?  
  
What's the point of reason  
When no one wants to listen?  
Deliverance is all too far away  
  
Oh what's the use?  
Oh what's the use?  
Tell me, oh, what's the use?  
What's the use?  
  
Love becomes an evil of the mind  
What's the use?  
  
What's the use?..
