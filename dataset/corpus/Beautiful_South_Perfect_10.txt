She's a perfect 10, but she wears a 12  
Baby keep a little 2 for me  
She could be sweet 16, bustin' out at the seams  
It's still love in the first degree  
  
When he's at my gate, with a big fat 8  
You want to see the smile on my face  
And even at my door, with a poor poor 4  
There ain't no man can replace  
  
'Cause we love our love,  
in different sizes  
I love her body, especially the lies  
Time takes it's toll, but not on the eyes  
Promise me this, take me tonight  
  
If he's extra large well I'm in charge  
I can work this thing on top  
If he's XXL well what the hell  
Every penny don't fit the slot  
  
The anorexic chicks, the model 6  
They don't hold no weight with me  
Well 8 or 9, well that's just fine  
But I like to hold something I can see  
  
'Cause we love our love,  
in different sizes  
I love her body, especially the lies  
Time takes it's toll, but not on the eyes  
Promise me this, take me tonight  
  
I've bought a watch, to time your beauty  
But I've had to fit a second hand  
I've bought a calendar, and every month  
Is taken up by lover man  
  
'Cause we love our love,  
in different sizes  
I love her body, especially the lies  
Time takes it's toll, but not on the eyes  
Promise me this, take me tonight  
  
'Cause we love our love, in different sizes  
I love her body, especially the lies  
Time takes it's toll, but not on the eyes  
Promise me this, take me tonight
