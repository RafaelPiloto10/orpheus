Every day is a lost weekend  
Every day since my baby said goodbye  
Every day is a lost weekend  
I feel just like crawling off somewhere to die  
Just like a clown, I played around  
Too many times I was untrue  
I still remember, your parting words were  
If you need me, I'll call you  
Every day is a lost weekend  
Every day since my baby said goodbye  
Just like a clown, I played around  
Too many times I was untrue  
I still remember, your parting words were  
If you need me, I'll call you  
Every day is a lost weekend  
Every day since my baby said goodbye  
Well, I'm choking, choking on heartaches  
I feel just like crawling off somewhere to die  
I feel just like crawling off somewhere to die
