I got a rip in my shoes  
And a hole in my brand new shoes  
I got a Margarita nose  
And a breath full of Mad Dog Booze  
I got the fever, fever, fever, fever  
Yeah, they threw me outta jail  
I tell ya it ain't fair  
I tried to kiss the judge  
From the electrica' chair  
Yeah we're all here  
'Cause we're not all there tonight  
The guitar's cranked  
And the bass man's blown a fuse  
And when the whole gang bangs  
Then what is your excuse?  
I got the fever, fever, fever, fever  
Fever gives you lust with an appetite  
It hits you like the fangs  
From a rattlesnake bite  
Yeah we're all here  
'Cause we're not all there tonight  
We can't run away from trouble  
There ain't no place that far  
But if we do it right at the speed of light  
There's the backseat of my car - caviar  
I was feelin' so high I forgot what day  
Now I'm feeling low down  
Even slow feels way to fast  
And now the booze don't work  
'Cause the drugs ran out of gas  
I got the fever, fever, fever, fever  
The buzz that you're gettin'  
From the crack don't last  
I'd rather be O.D.in' on the crack of her ass  
Yeah we're all here  
'Cause we're not all there tonight  
My first time ever lover  
We fell asleep out on the lawn  
And when I woke up I was all alone  
Making love to the crack of dawn  
So yo, I beg yo pardon sir  
The gangster of love rides again  
You know I gotta chill  
It gimme such a thrill  
Like a burnin' plague  
Yeah get outta my way  
Fever may be Hell and a cross to bear  
As long as I'm in heaven, honey I don't care  
You look so good baby, look so fine  
I tell you you're the image of a perfect crime  
You get so tired holdin' on so tight  
If you think you're goin' crazy  
Well you may be right  
Yeah we're all here  
'Cause we're not all there tonight
