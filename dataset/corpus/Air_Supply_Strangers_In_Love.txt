Strangers in love must a star fall from the sky  
It's stranger than most and stranger when we try  
To understand it all, why we fall,  
As strangers in love,  
Strangers in love.  
Straight from the farm and a world apart and ready for-  
Someone to take her arm, she's never seen a movie  
  
What an innocent face, what an innocent place.  
It's natural, it's an easy thing to do,  
Natural, it's an easy thing to do.  
Strangers in love and a star fell from the sky  
Don't know which way to turn, don't know which boat to burn  
Don't know which way to turn, don't know which boat to burn.  
Strangers in love
