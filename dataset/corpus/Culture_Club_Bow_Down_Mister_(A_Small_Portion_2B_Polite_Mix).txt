From Bombay to Bangalore  
All the Hindus know the score  
If you wanna live some more  
Hare, Hare, Hare  
  
If you do not take the vow  
You can eat the sacred cow  
You'll get Karma anyhow  
Hare, Hare, Hare  
  
Bow down mister  
Hare Rama, Hare Krishna  
Bow down mister  
We say Radhe Shyam  
  
Do the right thing with your hands  
Lay down on the pleasing sands  
Whatever else your faith demands  
Hare, Hare, Hare  
  
From Bombay to Rajastan  
Nitai Guara, Radhe Shyam  
Hare Krishna, Hare Ram  
Hare, Hare, Hare  
  
Bow down mister  
Hare Rama, Hare Krishna  
Bow down mister  
We say Radhe Shyam  
  
Bow down mister  
Hare Rama, Hare Krishna  
Bow down mister  
We say Radhe Shyam  
  
In the desert Jaisalmer  
They put kumkum in their hair  
At the Westerners they stare  
Hare, Hare, Hare  
  
Paint a tilak on your brow  
Open like a lotus flower  
It's time to check your Karma now  
Hare, Hare, Hare  
  
Bow down mister  
Hare Rama, Hare Krishna  
Bow down mister  
We say Radhe Shyam

We say Radhe Shyam  
Bow down mister  
  
Raise your head and lift your hands to the Lord  
Raise your head and lift your hands to the Lord  
Raise your head and lift your hands to the Lord  
Raise your head and lift your hands to the Lord
