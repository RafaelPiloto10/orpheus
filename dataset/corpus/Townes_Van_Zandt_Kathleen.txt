It's plain to see, the sun won't shine today  
But I ain't in the mood for sunshine anyway  
Maybe I'll go insane  
I got to stop the pain  
Or maybe I'll go down to see Kathleen.  
  
A swallow comes and tells me of her dreams  
She says she'd like to know just what they mean  
I feel like I could die  
As I watch her flying by  
Ride the north wind down to see Kathleen.  
  
Stars hang high above, the oceans roar  
The moon is come to lead me to her door  
There's crystal across the sand  
And the waves, they take my hand.  
Soon I'm gonna see my sweet Kathleen.  
  
Soon I'm gonna see my sweet Kathleen.
