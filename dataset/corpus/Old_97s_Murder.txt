And the hole  
In the screen is barely big enough for you  
And not near enough for me to go  
  
And the whole damn complicated  
Situation could've been  
Avoided if I'd only shut the window  
  
Chorus:  
And I may be leavin' myself open  
To a murder or a heart attack  
But I'm leavin' the back door open  
'til you come back, 'til you come back  
  
And I may be movin' myself closer  
To a real untimely end  
But I'm leavin' the back door open  
'til you come home again, 'til you come home again  
  
And I told  
The neighbors, I put pictures up  
And handed out some flyers at the show  
  
And the whole town speculating  
Situation could've been  
Avoided if I'd only shut the window  
  
Chorus  
  
Repeat chorus
