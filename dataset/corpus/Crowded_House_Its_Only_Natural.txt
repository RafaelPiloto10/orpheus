Ice will melt, water will boil  
You and I can shake off this mortal coil  
It's bigger than us  
You don't have to worry about it  
  
Ready or not here comes the drop  
You feel lucky when you know where you are  
You know it's gonna come true  
Here in your arms I remember  
  
[Chorus]  
It's only natural that I should want to  
Be there with you  
It's only natural that you should  
Feel the same way too  
  
It's easy when you don't try  
Going on first impressions  
Man in a cage has made his confession  
Now you've seen me at my worst  
And it won't be the last time I'm down there  
  
I want you to know I feel completely at ease  
Read me like a book  
That's fallen down between your knees  
Please, let me have my way with you  
  
It's only natural that I should want to  
Be there with you  
It's only natural that you should  
Feel the same way too  
  
It's circumstantial, it's nothing written in the sky  
And we don't even have to try  
Shaking like mud, buildings of glass  
Sink into the bay, they'll be under the rocks again  
You don't have to say I know you're afraid  
  
It's only natural that I should want to  
Be there with you  
It's only natural that you should  
Feel the same way too  
  
It's circumstantial, it's something I was born to  
It's only natural, can I help it if I want to? Can I help it if I want to?
