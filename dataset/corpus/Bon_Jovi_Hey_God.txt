Hey God, I'm just a little man  
I got a wife and family  
I almost lost my house  
I bought into the dream  
We're barely holdin' on and I'm in way too deep  
We're two paychecks away from livin' out on the street  
  
She's a workin' single mom  
Like a saint she don't complain  
She never says a word but she thinks that she's to blame  
Her son just got convicted  
He blew some cop away  
She did her best to raise him but the world got in the way  
  
Hey God  
Tell me what the hell is goin' on  
It seems like all the good shit's gone  
It keeps on gettin' harder hangin' on  
But hey hey hey hey God  
There's nights you know I want to scream  
These days you're even harder to believe  
I know how busy you must be  
But hey hey hey hey God  
Do you ever think about me  
  
Born into the ghetto, 1991  
Just a happy child playin' beneath the summer sun  
A vacant lot's his playground  
By 12 he's got a gun  
The odds are bet against him  
Junior don't make 21  
  
Hey God  
Tell me what the hell is goin' on  
It seems like all the good shit's gone  
It keeps on gettin' harder hangin' on  
But hey hey hey hey God  
There's nights you know I want to scream  
These days you're even harder to believe  
I know how busy you must be  
But hey hey hey hey God  
Do you ever think about me  
  
I get down on my knees  
I'm gonna try this thing your way  
I seen a dyin' man to proud to beg  
Spit on his own grave  
Was he too gone to save  
Or did you even know his name  
Are you the one to blame  
I got something to say  
  
Hey God  
Tell me what the hell is goin' on  
It seems like all the good shit's gone  
It keeps on gettin' harder hangin' on  
But hey hey hey hey God  
There's nights you know I want to scream  
These days you're even harder to believe  
I know how busy you must be  
But hey hey hey hey God  
Do you ever think about me  
  
Do you ever think about me
