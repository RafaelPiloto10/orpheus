For the life of me  
I never thought that it could be  
The way it stands right now  
Emotions running high  
Every night I wish that I  
Could tell you how I feel  
Those words are here in my heart  
Oh but there is just one missing part  
  
How to put it together  
How to say it right  
And let you know that  
Every night  
  
I'll be dreamin'  
Dreamin'  
Hoping baby you will be there  
I'll be dreamin'  
Dreamin'  
Hoping baby you will be there  
  
Let me take time out  
To try and find out  
If this could be real  
Cause reality scares me  
I've been living a fantasy  
How should I feel  
  
Those words are here in my heart  
Oh but there is just one missing part  
  
How to put it together  
How to say it right  
And let you know that  
Every night  
  
I'll be dreamin'  
Dreamin'  
Hoping baby you will be there  
I'll be dreamin'  
Dreamin'  
Hoping baby you will be there
