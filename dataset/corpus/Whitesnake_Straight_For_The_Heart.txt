I'm coming round to see you,  
Kicking down your door  
I've got to tell you girl  
I really can't take no more  
'cause I've been hearing about you  
Everybody says you're front page news  
Laying it down, all around the town  
Giving all the boys the blues  
  
Stand and deliver in the name of love,  
I'm coming after you,  
I'll tell you want I'm gonna do  
  
I'm going straight for the heart,  
Gonna drive you crazy  
Going straight for the heart  
I'm gonna drive you insane  
  
I never loved a woman  
The way that I love you  
I can't escape the feeling,  
You don't know what you're putting me through  
  
So stand and deliver in the name of love  
My heart is in your hand,  
So try to understand  
  
Straight for the heart  
  
I'm going straight for the heart,  
Gonna drive you crazy  
Going straight for the heart  
I'm gonna drive you insane  
  
You got the love I dream of  
The kind that cost so much,  
Just cover me with kisses, baby  
Surrender to my touch  
  
Stand and deliver in the name of love  
My heart is in your hand,  
So try to understand  
I'm coming after you,  
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do  
  
I'm going straight for the heart  
Gonna drive you crazy  
Going straight for the heart  
I'm gonna drive you insane  
  
Straight for the heart,  
Gonna drive you crazy  
Going straight for the heart,  
I'm gonna drive you insane  
  
Straight for the heart
