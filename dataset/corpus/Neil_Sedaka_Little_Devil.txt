Woh who who who yeah yeah yeah  
Hey little devil  
Woh who who who yeah yeah yeah  
Hey little devil  
Hey little devil you're always runnin' around  
It's time that someone started bringing you down  
There'll be some changes made  
Your rovin' days are through  
Hey little devil I'm gonna make an angel out of you  
Hey little devil you got me all in a whirl  
You're a cute little devil and I'm gonna make you my girl  
You're out to break my heart  
But just before you do  
Hey little devil I'm gonna make an angel out of you  
They say beware but I don't care  
I love you just the same  
You're an old heart breaker and a mischief maker  
But I'm wise to your name  
Woh woh woh  
Hey little devil everything is gonna be fine  
'Cause someday soon I'm gonna make you all mine  
There'll be no runnin' around  
You met your Waterloo  
Hey little devil I'm gonna make an angel out of you  
Woh woh woh  
Hey little devil everything is gonna be fine  
'Cause someday soon I'm gonna make you all mine  
There'll be no runnin' around  
You met your Waterloo  
Hey little devil I'm gonna make an angel out of you  
Woh who who who yeah yeah yeah

Woh who who who yeah yeah yeah
