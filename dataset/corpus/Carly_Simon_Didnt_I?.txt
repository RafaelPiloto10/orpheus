Didn't I give you midnight?  
Didn't I give you the month of June  
Didn't I make it alright  
When everything was ruined  
Didn't I say didn't I  
Didn't you say didn't I too  
Didn't we both say didn't I  
'Till didn't we say we're through  
Didn't I try, didn't I cry  
Didn't I?  
  
Sorry that your mother dropped you on your head  
Maybe her mother dropped her too  
In the end we all get dropped  
We all get black and blue  
  
But didn't I always love you long  
When time was short and the night was cold  
Didn't I admit that I was wrong  
When the anger was new but the fight was old  
Didn't I say didn't I  
'Till didn't we say we're through  
Didn't I try, didn't I cry  
Didn't I, didn't I,  
Didn't I do?
