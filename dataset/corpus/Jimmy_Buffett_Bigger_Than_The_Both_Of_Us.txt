The moon's smiling over my shoulder  
I know these same stars will shine when I'm older  
So I'm keeping heaven on my mind  
'Cause a good love is so hard to find  
  
[Chorus:]  
And it's bigger than the both of us  
Deeper than the sea  
Tossing on the water riding destiny  
Bigger than the both of us  
Farther than the eye can see  
We're dancing, our souls are dancing  
Infinity  
  
You know there's a million ways to fail  
But I know this isn't just a fairy tale  
It's a one in million paradise  
And I know love is the light in your eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Bigger than the both of us  
Our souls are dancing  
Bigger than the both of us  
Our souls are dancing
