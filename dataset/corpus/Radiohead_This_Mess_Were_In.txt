Can you hear them?  
The helicopters?  
I'm in New York  
No need for words now  
We sit in silence  
You look me  
In the eye directly  
You met me  
I think it's Wednesday  
The evening  
The mess we're in and  
  
The city sun sets over me  
  
Night and day  
I dream of  
Making love  
To you now baby  
Love-making  
On-screen  
Impossible dream  
And I have seen  
The sunrise  
Over the river  
The freeway  
Reminding  
Of this mess we're in and  
  
The city sun sets over me  
  
What were you wanting?  
I just want to say  
Don't ever change now baby  
And thank you  
I don't think we'll ever meet again  
And you must leave now  
Before the sunrise  
Above skyscrapers  
The sin and  
The mess we're in and  
  
The city sun sets over me
