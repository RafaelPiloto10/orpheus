Somethin' 'bout the Goldie in me  
Somethin' 'bout an Oakland mack  
When I hear this song  
It makes an O.G. feel phat  
Somethin' 'bout the Goldie in me  
Somethin' 'bout an Oakland mack  
When I hear this song  
It makes an O.G. feel phat  
Somethin' 'bout the Goldie in me  
That makes me laugh at these wannabes  
'Cause they been watchin' too much TV  
Rambo and Clint Eastwood got ya trippin'  
But the Goldie in me  
Keeps me thinkin' 'bout my group and never slippin'  
In that played out tread  
'Cause most O.G.'s are in the pen or fresh out  
And when I hear rappers like you call me wack  
I laugh and just say over twenty million sold  
Can you buy that?  
Yeah, fake rappers are surreal  
You don't hear me though, I thought ya knew  
I'm a certified player, you see  
'Cause of the girls, the girls, they love me  
And no matter what my critics say  
They all know that I'm mackin' this fame  
'Cause fools can't recognize game  
I refuse to be a wannabe  
Somethin' 'bout the Goldie in me, yeah  
Somethin' 'bout the Goldie in me  
Somethin' 'bout an Oakland mack  
When I hear this song  
It makes an O.G. feel phat  
Somethin' 'bout the Goldie in me  
Somethin' 'bout an Oakland mack  
When I hear this song  
It makes an O.G. feel phat  
Somethin' 'bout the Goldie in me  
See I'm a G  
Hangin' wit fools like Big Loose  
Crossecuse, and Killa Week  
Just some hard knuckleheads from the east side  
Where we used to squab, shoot 'em down  
Collect ends, and high side and rise  
And get between thighs on the day to day  
Craps, big bank take little bank, were games we like to play  
Rollin' down east 14, the brothers be trippin'  
They hear the cats be slippin'  
'Cause the moves be quick to zippin'  
Pickin' up freaks every other block, wherever the ride stop  
The girls flock, and all the homies jock, sock  
Bustas makin' smart remarks, I'm quick to bust ya  
Never worry about my back, because I'm rollin' wit some hustlas  
And we don't sell, we bail  
Creep through the hood wit pockets fatter than the Goodyear blimp  
Yeah, an oak town player, G  
It's got to be the Goldie in me  
Somethin' 'bout the Goldie in me  
Somethin' 'bout an Oakland mack  
When I hear this song  
It makes an O.G. feel phat  
Somethin' 'bout the Goldie in me  
Somethin' 'bout an Oakland mack  
When I hear this song  
It makes an O.G. feel phat
