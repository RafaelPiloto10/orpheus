I'm sick in the mind, body, and soul  
This way of living has taken it's toll  
I'm abusing myself, but I'll never learn  
I just want to watch this city burn  
  
There's no turning back, once you've turned your back  
  
I'm sick of the human race  
Wanna see society laid to waste  
Of the people who destroy more than they create  
Live to kill, love to hate  
  
I used to feel sympathy but now it's all just apathy  
I'll just turn my back as the world burns all around me  
Am I dying for a change or just dead on the inside?  
Maybe I don't look cause I'm not sure what I'll find  
So I point the finger at whose to blame  
But deep inside, we're all the same  
Is this me, can it be?  
Have I become, one of them?
