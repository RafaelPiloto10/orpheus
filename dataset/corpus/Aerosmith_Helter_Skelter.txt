When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide  
Where I stop and I turn and go for a ride  
'Til I get to the bottom and I see you again  
  
Do you or don't you want me to love you  
I'm coming down fast but I'm miles above you  
Tell me tell me tell me the answer  
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer  
  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
  
Will you want you want me to make you  
I'm comin' down fast but don't let me break you  
Tell me tell me tell me the answer  
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer  
  
Helter skelter, look out  
  
She's coming down fast  
Yes she is, yes she is
