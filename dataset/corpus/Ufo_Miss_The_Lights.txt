(intro) walking tall, full of tedious charm,  
The smoothest (? ? ? ) in (? ? ? )  
The mission boys all cross their palms  
Don't you know who I am  
I guess you miss the lights? huh!  
I guess you miss the fame  
I guess you miss everybody  
Hanging onto your name  
Little caesar is prince of the city  
? ? ?  
In this town there's no pity  
This man stands alone  
I guess you miss the lights - ha!  
I guess you miss the fame  
I guess you miss everybody  
Hanging onto your name  
Sometimes when you're all alone  
And the blue turns to gray  
Better get down on those pinky knees,  
And you start to pray  
I guess you miss the lights - ha!  
I guess you miss the fame  
I guess you miss everybody  
Kiss-kissing your name  
(instrumental)  
A glimmering ? , a twilight star  
And so much love for show,  
A returning wave from the gallery bar  
And share the afterglow  
I guess you miss the lights  
I guess you miss the fame  
I guess you miss everybody  
Hanging onto your name  
Ha!  
I guess you miss the lights  
I guess you miss the fame, haha!  
I guess you miss everybody  
Hanging onto your name  
(fade out music and chorus)  
I guess you miss the lights  
I guess you miss everybody  
Kiss-kissing your name
