Gently breathing, lit by the morning sun  
Through the night, it'd been raining venom  
I want to be kind, not a bullet in the right place  
Or just of two minds, more important than importance  
  
I want to help you lift enormous things  
A pinch, a sting, I don't feel a thing  
As the earth revolved around the sun  
  
All those shadows, waiting round the last lights  
To the dream of being, here comes the night  
All of the tiptoeing, past all our most-feared buildings  
I only say this now because, I didn't when it was happening  
  
I want to help you lift enormous things  
A pinch, a sting, I don't feel a thing  
But as the earth revolves around the sun  
  
I can see it all at once  
And, oh, what a glittering chance  
In my head the game goes quiet  
And I can see it all at once  
Them yelling, "Yer not the goods!  
A kid before the rapids!"  
But in my head the game is quiet  
And, oh, what a glittering chance  
Oh, what a glittering chance  
Oh, what a glittering chance  
  
At transformation  
At transformation  
  
That's my dream of being  
That's my dream of being  
That's my dream of being  
That's my dream of being
