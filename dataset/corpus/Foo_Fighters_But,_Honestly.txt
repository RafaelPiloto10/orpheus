Where you off to with that head of yours  
Is there somewhere you should be  
Was it something that I said the time I held you down  
And told you it's not you, it's only me, baby  
  
Don't take what I don't need  
(Give me back my piece of mind)  
Don't say what I don't mean  
(Give me back my precious time)  
No way you'll silence me  
You'll see  
  
What you up to now your mirror's gone  
Is there someone you should be  
Did you think I was just fooling 'round with you  
But honestly  
But honestly  
But honestly  
  
Don't take what I don't need  
(Give me back my piece of mind)  
Don't say what I don't mean  
(Give me back my precious time)  
No way you'll silence me  
No where to hide from me  
You'll see  
  
And tonight I thank the stars  
As I count my lucky scars  
For everything you've given me  
And all the words I gave to you  
Something borrowed something blue  
If you want them back  
I'll give it to you  
Give it to you  
Give it to you  
Give it to you  
Give it to you  
Give it to you  
Give it to you  
I'll give it to you  
I'll give it to you  
Give it to you  
Give it to you  
I'll give it to you  
I'll give it to you  
Give it to you  
Give it to you  
I'll give it to you  
  
I don't want one thing that I gave to you  
I don't want one thing that I gave to you  
I don't want one thing that I gave to you  
I don't want one thing that I gave to you  
I don't want one thing that I gave to you  
I don't want one thing that I gave to you  
I don't want one thing that I gave to you  
I don't want one thing that I gave to you
