Hey girl ain't no mystery  
At least as far as I can see  
I want to keep you here  
Laying next to me  
Sharing our love between the sheets  
  
Oh baby I feel your love surrounding me  
Oh baby making love between the sheets  
  
Oh girl let me hold you tight  
And you know I'll make you feel alright  
Oh baby girl just cling to me and let your mind be free  
While making love between the sheets  
  
Oh girl I love you all night long  
And I know you felt it coming on  
Oh darling just taste my world  
Oh you taste so sweet  
Sharing our love between the sheets  
  
Oh baby I feel your love surrounding me  
Oh baby making love between the sheets  
  
Hey girl what's your fantasy  
I'll take you there to that ecstasy  
Oh girl you blow my mind  
I'll always be your freak  
Let's make sweet love between the sheets  
  
Oh baby I feel your love surrounding me  
Oh baby making love between the sheets  
  
Oh baby I feel your love surrounding me  
Oh baby making love between the sheets  
  
I'm not gonna say let's make love  
  
In between the sheets  
  
Oh I like the way you receive me  
Girl I love the way you release me  
I'm coming coming on strong  
In between the sheets  
  
Oh I like the way you receive me  
Girl I love the way you release me  
I'm coming coming on strong  
In between the sheets  
  
You got me moaning  
Girl You got me groaning  
I'm coming coming on strong  
In between the sheets  
  
Let's get all the way down  
  
You're the only one  
  
I'm coming coming coming baby coming on strong  
In between the sheets
