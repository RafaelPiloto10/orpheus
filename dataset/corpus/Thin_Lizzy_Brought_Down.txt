I was seldom sober in nineteen hundred and fifthy-four  
Hey baby, maybe 'cause my baby had a baby by me  
And I was still drinking dry gin  
While you cried "no, no more"  
And you were lyin' and a-cryin',  
And your tears fell dying on the floor  
  
And I'm brought down,  
And I don't think I can get up again  
Brought down,  
My heart is hurt again  
  
You were the fine lady in the early mornings  
That always painted her toes  
And lookin' towards the east  
You'd say hello to the early dawn before they rose  
And you were the love lady  
That always hung up her finely pressed clothes  
And sayin' so long to the western sundown,  
You taught me how it grows  
  
And I'm brought down,  
And I don't think I can get up again  
Brought down,  
And you just hurt my heart again  
Brought down  
Brought down  
I'm brought down  
  
Brought down  
Brought down  
Brought down  
Down  
  
I'm brought down,  
And I don't think I can get up again  
I'm brought down,  
I'm hurt, it's bad  
Brought down  
God, it's a shame there's no more Dr. Strangely strange  
Brought down  
And I'm brou-  
Brought down  
-ught down  
Brought down  
And there must be more to life than this
