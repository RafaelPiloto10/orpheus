Every day when I walk home  
I see loneliness  
When I waited for my baby.  
You know I open my front door,  
I said Mr. Loneliness is waiting for me at home  
Lordy, Lord at home, Lord at home, Lo-o-o-rd at home.  
You know, I get home every day, Lord,  
There ain't nobody waiting there, man  
And I ain't got no girlfriends, and I ain't got no boyfriends, man.  
I ain't got no any kind of friends, man, I ain't got no...  
My tv set doesn't work, my radio doesn't work, man.  
I come home there's nothing  
Nothing, man, there's no animals moving,  
There's nothing, man  
Walk in that door seems like I'm sitting there every day, man.  
Lord, loneliness  
Lord, loneliness  
Ah, ah, loneliness  
Loneliness  
Loneliness  
Loneliness  
Loneliness  
Lord.  
All right!
