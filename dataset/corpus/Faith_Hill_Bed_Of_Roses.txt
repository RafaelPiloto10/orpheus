There's something 'bout your manner  
That makes it hard to see  
Just how you take advantage  
Of a workin' girl like me  
I've seen you set 'em up  
And I've seen you take 'em down  
Our love is legal tender  
For your kind to pass around  
  
Don't want your bed of roses  
Don't want no handful of thorns  
Don't want to be your livin' doll  
Don't want to be no woman scorned  
I don't want to watch you turn the page  
When our chapter closes  
No, I'm not gonna lay me down  
In your bed of roses  
  
I've tasted good and bad love  
In the honky-tonks and bars  
I've settled for the moon  
When I was reachin' for the stars  
And though sometimes I have stumbled  
I've been known to fall  
It was always true love  
That took me to the wall  
  
Don't want your bed of roses  
Don't want no handful of thorns  
Don't want to be your livin' doll  
Don't want to be no woman scorned  
I don't want to watch you turn the page  
When our chapter closes  
No I'm not gonna lay me down  
In your bed of roses  
  
Girl you better hide your love away  
Girl you better save it for another day
