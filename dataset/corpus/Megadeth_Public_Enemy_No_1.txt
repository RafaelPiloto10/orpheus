Public enemy number one  
Jail break and a smoking gun  
You won't believe the things I've done  
And the killing was just for fun  
  
Public enemy number one  
A stolen car and I'm on the run  
Through the night through the rising sun  
And the trouble has just begun  
  
Roses on your grave  
I'll be on my way  
There's no time to stay  
With the enemies I've made  
  
I'm invincible  
You might say despicable  
Punishments reciprocal  
Public enemy number one  
  
I'm unbeatable  
My mind is untreatable  
Crimes unrepeatable  
Public enemy number one  
  
Public enemy number one  
Watch the authorities come undone  
With every standoff that I've won  
Flirting death just for fun  
  
Public enemy number one  
Born a fugitives fathers son  
Another heist of a bank is done  
And the trouble has just begun  
  
Roses on your grave  
I'll be on my way  
There's no time to stay  
With the enemies I've made  
  
I'm invincible  
You might say despicable  
Punishments reciprocal  
Public enemy number one  
  
I'm unbeatable  
My mind's untreatable  
Crimes unrepeatable  
Public enemy number one  
  
They say that I'm wanted  
For all those dead  
But everyone who's tried  
Got a bullet to their head  
  
I'm invincible  
You might say despicable  
Punishments reciprocal  
Public enemy number one  
  
I'm unbeatable  
My mind's untreatable  
Crimes, unrepeatable  
Public enemy number one  
  
Public enemy!  
Public enemy!  
Public enemy!  
Public enemy!
