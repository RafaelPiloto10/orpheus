Maybe I should go and live in Amsterdam  
In a side street in a big canal  
Spend my evenings in the Van Gogh Museum  
What a dream, Van Gogh Museum  
Maybe its time to see Tangiers  
A different life-style some different fears  
And maybe I should be Edinburgh  
In a kilt in Edinburgh  
Doin' a modern dance  
Doin' a modern dance  
Or maybe I should get a farm in Southern France  
Where the winds are wispy and the villagers dance  
And you and I we'd sleep beneath a moon  
Moon in June and sleep till noon  
And maybe you and I could fall in love  
Regain the spirit that we once had  
You'd let me hold you and touch the night  
That shines so bright, so bright with fright  
Doin' a modern dance  
Doin' a modern dance  
Shit, maybe I could go to Yucatan  
Where women are women, a man's a man  
Ah, no one confused, ever loses place  
With their place in the human race  
Maybe I'm not cut out for city life  
The smell of exhaust, the smell of strife  
And maybe you don't want to be a wife  
It's not a life being a wife  
Doin' a modern dance  
Doin' a modern dance  
So maybe I should go to Tanganyika  
Where the rivers run, down mountains tall and steep  
Or go to India to study chants  
And lose romance to a mantra's dance  
I need a guru, I need some law  
Explain to me the things we saw  
Why it always comes to this  
It's all downhill after the first kiss  
Maybe I should move to Rotterdam  
Maybe move to Amsterdam  
I should move to Ireland, Italy, Spain  
Afghanistan where there is no rain  
Or maybe I should just learn a modern dance  
Where roles are shifting the modern dance  
You never touch you don't know who you're with  
This week, this month, this time of year  
This week, this month, this time of year  
Doin' a modern dance  
You don't know who you're with modern dance  
I should move to Pakistan, go to Afghanistan  
Dance, you don't know who you're with  
Dance, you don't know who you're with  
Modern dance  
And maybe you don't want to be a wife  
It's not life being a wife  
Doin' a modern dance  
You never touch you don't know who you're with  
Dance, modern dance  
The roles are shifting dance  
You never touch you don't know who you're with  
Dance, modern dance  
Maybe you don't want to be a wife
