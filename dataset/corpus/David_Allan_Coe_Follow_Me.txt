I want you to love the things you love and even more  
Follow me, follow me  
Less gives less and more gives more  
Is your love sweeter now than it was before?  
  
Cross-purpose love it never flies  
True love's pure it magnifies  
Follow me, follow me  
  
It always surprises me when I make you laugh  
When you laugh at me  
Follow me, follow me  
Makes me want to do it more  
  
I like your laugh, it pleases me  
I see the lake behind the trees  
Flashing in ones and twos and threes  
Follow me, follow me  
  
There is nothing you need that you don't have or can't do  
  
I have love and so I stay, I have none so I go away  
Follow me, follow me  
You have no love, you need me now  
So I go away, I free you now  
  
I'll see you later on my love  
Got to go down to rise above  
Follow me, follow me  
  
You would love to see me now, you'd love to be with me  
Follow me, follow me  
Hold me close and don't let go  
Don't say yes, don't say no  
  
I see the lake behind the trees  
Flashing in ones and twos and threes  
Follow me, follow me  
  
There is nothing you need that you don't have or can't do
