Dawn wakes the silence,  
Of a fainted lullaby  
Day breaks the eyelid,  
From a song sung in my eye  
  
Night rests in peace,  
As the sun mourns the sky  
All's accounted for sheep,  
Over a horizon's I  
  
Rise, rise 'n shine  
A new day is coming  
Rise, rise in time  
For everything under the sun  
  
And when you see,  
A south wind blow  
Forecasting, you will know,  
A hot day, will be on the way  
(foolish one)  
You analyze,  
The earth and the sky  
I ask you why,  
You can't analyze the signs,  
Of the present time  
  
I had a dream,  
Not unlike the one from old  
Of a man king,  
Whose head was made of gold  
Stand castles of sand  
Weather the sundials rise 'n fall  
Chasing wind through your hands,  
'til water runs dry the well  
  
Dream, daniel, dream  
For what's yet to come  
See, daniel, see  
For everything under the sun  
  
And in the west,  
A cloud appears  
For shadows of  
A coming shower near,  
Oh, so near  
(hypocrites)  
You analyze,  
The earth and the sky  
I ask you why,  
You can't analyze the signs,  
Of the present time  
  
Vanity,  
Yes, all is vanity  
Vanity,  
Yes, all's futility  
  
For one that dies,  
Another's born  
Where laughter's heard,  
Comforters mourn  
There's a time for  
Everything  
  
A song for love,  
Even abhor  
An olive branch,  
Or winter's war  
There's a time for  
Everything, under the sun
