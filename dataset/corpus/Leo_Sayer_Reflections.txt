Through the hollow of my tears  
I see a dream that's lost  
From the hurt, ooh, that you have caused  
Through the mirror of my mind  
Time after time I see reflections of you and me  
  
Reflections of  
The way life used to be  
Reflections of  
The love you took from me  
  
I'm all alone now, no love to shield me  
Back to the world of that stops at reality  
Oh that happiness, ah you took from me  
And you left me with only memories  
Through the mirror of my mind  
Through all these tears I'm cryin'  
Reflects the hurt I can't control  
  
'cause though you're gone  
I keep holdin' on  
Through the happy times  
When you were mine  
  
As I peer through the window of lost time  
Thinkin' over my yesterdays  
All the love I had in vain  
All the love I have wasted  
All the tears I have tasted, uh-huh  
  
Through the hollow of my tears  
I see a dream that's lost  
From the hurt, ooh, you have caused  
Ev'rywhere I turn, ev'rything I see  
Reflects the love that used to be  
  
In you I put all my love  
My faith and trust  
And right before my eyes  
My world has turned to dust  
At drop of night I sat alone and wept  
Just a handful of promises'  
All that's left of lovin' you -- whoo  
  
Ya got the reflection  
Ya got the reflection  
Ya got the reflection  
The way I used to be  
Ya got the reflection  
Ya got the reflection  
Ya got the reflection  
Ya got the reflection
