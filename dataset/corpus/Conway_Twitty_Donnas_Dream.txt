Dream Donna dream  
Dream Donna dream.  
  
In a sleepy little border town  
Lives the cutest girl  
For miles around  
Never dreamed of things  
Like wealth and fame  
Oh Donna is her name.  
  
Every night when she's fast asleep  
Donna always dreams a dream of me  
I know all her little plans and schemes  
I'm the boy in Donna dream.  
  
Every night  
When the moon is bright  
I meet my Donna  
And I hold her tight  
Her angel eyes  
And her golden hair  
When Donna needs a dream lover  
I'll be there.  
  
When she wakes up  
And I'm all alone  
I lose my Donna  
With every dawn  
I'll be with her  
Once again you see  
When my Donna dreams of me.  
  
She gonna meet me  
Someday for sure  
I may even be the boy next door  
And if she finds me  
She's gonna to know  
That I'm her dream lover  
And I need her so.  
  
But until I am reality  
I know my Donna's  
Gonna dream of me  
I know all her little plans and schemes  
I'm the boy in Donna's dream  
  
Dream Donna dream  
Dream Donna dream...
