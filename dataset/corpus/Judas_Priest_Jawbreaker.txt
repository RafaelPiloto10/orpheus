Deadly as the viper  
Peering from its coil  
The poison there is coming to the boil  
  
Ticking like a time bomb  
The fuse is running short  
on the verge of snapping if it's caught  
  
And all the pressure that's been building up  
For all the years it bore the load  
The cracks appear, the frame starts to distort  
Ready to explode  
  
Jawbreaker  
  
Crouching in the corner  
Wound up as a spring  
Piercing eyes that flash are shimmering  
  
Muscles are all contorted  
Claws dug in the dirt  
Every ounce of fiber on alert
