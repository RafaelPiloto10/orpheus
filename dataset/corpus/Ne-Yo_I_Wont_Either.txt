There's me,  
Strong in what I believe but at times I try be correct politically  
There's her,  
Hard headed as can be, makes no apologies, the opposite of me  
  
But when it comes to love I'm inspired by her middle finger to the world  
And I love that she don't care how they see us  
And because of her now I don't either  
And I love that she will not let them beat us  
And because of her now I won't either  
Now I won't either  
  
There's us,  
Opposite enough to occasionally fuss  
Over things we simply just disagree on  
But there's us,  
Overwhelming trust in the fact that we gon' be us  
Come what may and no matter what  
I learned that from her  
  
But when it comes to love I'm inspired by her middle finger to the world  
And I love that she don't care how they see us  
(How they see us)  
And because of her now I don't either  
(Now I don't either)  
And I love that she will not let them beat us  
(Will not let them beat us)  
And because of her now I won't either  
(Now I won't either)  
Now I won't either  
  
She's shown me with, much stronger than  
What they may say, the circumstance  
I'm not ashamed to hold her hand  
Let the cameras flash I don't give a damn  
Oh whoa let the cameras flash I don't give a damn  
Let the cameras flash I don't give a damn  
  
And I love that she don't care how they see us  
(And she don't care how oooh)  
And because of her now I don't either  
(Now I don't either, I don't either)  
And I love that she will not let them beat us  
(Let them beat us)  
And because of her now I won't either  
(And I won't either)  
I won't either no, no
