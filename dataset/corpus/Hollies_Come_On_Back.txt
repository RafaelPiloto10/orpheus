Been so long since I last saw you  
Come on back Come on back  
I'm just feeling lost without you  
Come on back Come on back  
Because you never you never you never held me tight  
You didn't you didn't treat me right  
  
[Chorus]  
Why don't you admit you love me  
and come on back come on back  
Say you're always thinking of me  
Come on back Come on back  
Because you never you never you never held me tight  
You didn't you didn't treat me right  
  
It's not so very hard (It's not so very hard)  
to make me feel this way (to make me feel this way)  
It's not so very hard (I just can't)  
Can't find the words the words to say  
Can't find the words the words to say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Been so long since I last saw you  
Come on back Come on back  
I'm just feeling lost without you  
Come on back Come on back  
Because you never you never you never held me tight  
You didn't you didn't treat me right  
  
Come on back!
