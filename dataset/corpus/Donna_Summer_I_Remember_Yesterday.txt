I remember that first night we met,  
Dancing to the sounds of clarinets,  
Dancing cheek to cheek, oh how sweet,  
You and me and this fantasy,  
Oh I remember our first night.  
  
I remember how we carried on,  
On and on until the light of dawn.  
From the very start, you stole my heart,  
I knew right then we would never part,  
Oh I remember that first night.  
  
Remember that first night,  
Remember that first night.  
  
I saw your love light through the candle's glow,  
Champagne was flowing, and so I let myself go,  
And when the night was over, we both looked around the room,  
Remember darling, chairs on the table, and only me and you  
  
I remember how we carried on,  
On and on until the light of dawn,  
And from the very start, you stole my heart,  
I knew right then we would never part.  
I remember that first night  
  
Remember that first night,  
Remember that first night,  
Remember that first night.
