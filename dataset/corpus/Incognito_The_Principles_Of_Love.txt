It's the principle of love  
It's the principle of life  
  
When you shut your soul  
You're so hard to find  
And there's no light in my life  
  
When you come to me  
And open up your heart  
It's a joyful time in my mind  
  
Finding and losing, Hurting and healing  
Let's get it on, get it on now  
Yearning and learning, breaking, creating  
Let's get it on, get it on, get it on  
It's the principle of love  
It's the principle of life  
  
It's easy to forget  
So caught up in ourselves  
That we're not the only ones  
(Not the only ones)  
  
Trouble finds us all  
But love can break the fall  
Time and time and time again  
  
I've taken time to say goodbye to my sadness  
Now I know I'm free  
You took my hand, led me out of the darkness  
Help me find a brand new me  
  
It's the principle of love  
It's the principle of life
