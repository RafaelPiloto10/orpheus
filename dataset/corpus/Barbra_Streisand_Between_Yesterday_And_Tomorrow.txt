Between yesterday and tomorrow,  
There is more there is more than a day.  
Between day and night between black and white  
There is more, there is more than gray.  
  
Between the question and the answer  
There's the silence of the sea.  
Between the cradle and the grave,  
There is the someone that is me.  
  
Between yesterday and tomorrow,  
There is more there is more than a day.  
  
There's every dawn you've ever seen,  
And every thing you've ever known.  
There's every hand you've ever touched or that ever was,  
Or that could have been, or that should have been.  
  
Between yesterday and tomorrow  
There is more there is more than a day.  
Between day and night, between black and white  
There is more, there is more than gray.  
  
Between the summer and the winter, there's a multitude of falls.  
Between the entry and the exit, there's a labyrinth of halls.  
Between yesterday and tomorrow  
There is more there is more than a day.  
  
There's every plan you'll dare to make  
And every dream you'll dare to dream.  
There's every word you'll hope to say,  
All that's yet to be, all that ought to be, all that has to be--  
  
Between yesterday and tomorrow.  
Between yesterday and tomorrow.
