I'm a king bee buzzing around your hive  
Now I'm a king bee darling buzzing around your hive  
Yeah, I can make some honey babe if you let me fly up inside  
Cause I'm young and able to buzz all night long  
I'm young and able mama, lord to buzz all night long  
And you know together we can make some honey  
Like the world ain't never known  
Cause I'm asking king bee, won't you be my queen  
Now I'm a king bee rider, won't you be my queen  
Because you know we can make some sweet little honey  
Like the world ain't never seen  
Drive your car up in my driveway  
Cut your bright lights way down low  
Drive your car up in my driveway, mama  
Cut your bright lights way down low  
I'm gonna wind up your transmission  
Till your motor won't run no more
