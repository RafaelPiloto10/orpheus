The day I first met you  
You told me you'd never fall in love  
But now that I get you  
I know fear is what it really was  
Now here we are, so close  
Yet so far, haven't I passed the test?  
When will you realize  
Baby, I'm not like the rest?  
  
Don't wanna break your heart  
Wanna give your heart a break  
I know you're scared, it's wrong  
Like you might make a mistake  
  
There's just one life to live  
And there's no time to wait  
  
To waste  
So let me give your heart a break  
Give your heart a break  
Let me give your heart a break  
Your heart a break  
Oh yeah, yeah  
  
On Sunday, you went home alone  
There were tears in your eyes  
I called your cell phone, my love  
But you did not reply  
  
The world is ours if we want it  
We can take it  
  
If you just take my hand  
There's no turning back now (There's no turning back now)  
  
Baby, try to understand  
Don't wanna break your heart  
Wanna give your heart a break  
I know you're scared, it's wrong  
  
Like you might make a mistake  
  
Rachel and Brody:  
There's just one life to live  
And there's no time to wait  
  
To waste  
So let me give your heart a break  
Give your heart a break  
Let me give your heart a break  
Your heart a break  
There's just so much you can take  
Give your heart a break  
Let me give your heart a break  
Your heart a break  
  
Oh yeah, yeah  
When your lips are on my lips  
And our hearts beat as one  
But you slip out of my finger tips  
Every time you run  
  
Don't wanna break your heart  
Wanna give your heart a break  
I know you're scared, it's wrong  
  
Like you might make a mistake  
There's just one life to live  
And there's no time to wait  
  
To waste  
So let me give your heart a break  
  
'Cause you've been hurt before (Give your heart a break)  
I can see it in your eyes (Give your heart a break)  
You try to smile it away (Give your heart a break)  
Some things you can't disguise  
  
Don't wanna break your heart  
Maybe I can ease the ache, the ache  
So let me give your heart a break  
  
Give your heart a break  
Your heart a break  
  
Your heart a break  
There's just so much you can take,  
Give your heart a break  
Let me give your heart a break, your heart a break  
Oh yeah, yeah
