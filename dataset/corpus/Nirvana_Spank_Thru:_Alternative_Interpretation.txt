As soft as a mouth (or "when the sorrow's loud")  
It'll soon have the cheese  
All flowers are there my love  
All the girls I have bleed  
We're together once again my love  
Will you be back, oh baby, baby  
  
I can't splange us sad, we lost it from the start  
Living without you girl, you only bring my heart, now!!!  
  
I can feel it, I can howl  
I can pet it, shave it, mould it,  
I can cut it, I can paste it, spank it  
Beautify you, weigh it.  
  
I've been looking for day glow  
Always hearin' the same ol'  
Say you want to be faithful  
I can make it do things you wouldn't think it ever could.  
  
I can feel it, I can hold it,  
Pet it, shave it, mould it,  
He can cut it, he can paste it, Spank it,  
Beautify you, weigh it  
  
I've been looking for day glow  
Always hearin' the same ol'  
Say you want to be faithful  
I can make it do things you wouldn't think it ever could.

I've been looking for day glow  
Always hearin' the same ol'  
Say you want to be faithful  
I can make it do things you wouldn't think it ever, you wouldn't think it ever
could.
