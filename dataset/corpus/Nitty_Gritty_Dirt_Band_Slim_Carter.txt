Who's gonna give a job to old slim carter,  
Who's gonna give a man a place to say.  
Who do you know that needs an old tired out rodeo man  
Who do you know nowadays needs a gun hand  
Who needs a gunhand  
I heard he was born somewhere in south dakota  
His mama ran off with an indian agent  
They say they hung his daddy for selling bad whiskey to the balckfeet  
So at ten years old, he hit the road, and kept on moving  
Who's gonna give a job to old slim carter  
Who's gonna give a man a place to say  
Who do you know that needs an old tired out rodeo man  
Who do you know nowadays needs a gun hand  
Who needs a gunhand  
He finally ended up in hollywood california  
He hocked the gold buckle that he worked so hard for  
Landed a job as a stuntman for america's favorite cowboy  
Until the stage had a wreck, he broke his neck  
And it was all over  
Who's gonna give a job to old slim carter  
Who's gonna give a man a place to say  
Who do you know that needs an old tired out rodeo man  
Who do you know nowadays needs a gun hand  
Who needs a gunhand  
Who needs a gunhand  
Who needs a gunhand?
