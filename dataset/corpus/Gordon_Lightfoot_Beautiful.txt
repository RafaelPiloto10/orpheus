At times I just don't know  
How you could be anything but beautiful  
I think that I was made for you  
And you were made for me  
  
And I know that I won't ever change  
We've been friends through rain or shine  
For such a long, long time  
  
Laughing eyes and smiling face  
It seems so lucky just to have the right  
Of telling you with all my might  
You're beautiful tonight  
  
And I know that you won't ever stray  
Cause you've been that way from day to day  
For such a long, long time  
  
And when you hold me tight  
How could life be anything but beautiful  
I think that I was made for you  
And you were made for me  
  
And I know that I won't ever change  
We've been friends through rain or shine  
For such a long, long time  
  
Well, I must say it means so much to me  
To be the one who's telling you  
I'm telling you, that you're beautiful.
