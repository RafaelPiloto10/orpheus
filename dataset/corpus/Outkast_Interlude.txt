OutKast,  
Tea's long,  
Tea's strong,  
Lastin' long vs. long lastin',  
Education, however, the difference between the two  
Which do you live in, yo'self?  
To draw a master plan without a flaw  
Somethin' lastin' long leaves a compromising position,  
Everything that isn't becomes questionable, unbelieveable, and becomes weak at
some point,  
Done got the strength t blow and to hit jackin' this joint  
Somethin' long lastin'  
Big Boi and Dre, the duo whose chemistry gave the potion a rare fate,  
Two Atlanta boys that came into this industry,  
For the same ol' boys to be OutKast, raps an' OutBlast the peers of the game,  
Move with the groove an' don't let the smooth groove fool yu,  
So it is, believe in the dirty Southernplayalllisticcaddilac-funky-aliens,  
The kind that makes Aquemini,  
Big Boi and Dre presents OutKast,  
So get ready to bump!  
808-style, 2  
"The Speakerboxxx" and "The Love Below"  
Two albums  
With the ame ol' flow  
Now enjoy it  
Me?  
Signin' off  
A-K-A  
Possum Dre
