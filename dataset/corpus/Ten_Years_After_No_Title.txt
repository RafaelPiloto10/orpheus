Well, I got no worry, and I got no pain  
'Cause when I get rid of them, they come back again  
I just keep on doing what I want to do  
If I keep on trying, I'm sure to come through  
  
Well, money's no problem, it comes and it goes  
It stops me from starving, it keeps me in clothes  
There's a God and a devil, I'm sure it must be  
But why should I bother them, they don't bother me  
  
So, I'll keep on playing and do what I do  
These strings on my fingers are all that is true
