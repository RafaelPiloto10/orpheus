We like explosions that leave you feeling good  
We like ideas that change the world for good  
  
There's nothing past the stop 'n' go  
There's nothing but the ebb and flow  
There's nothing like some in and out  
There's nothing more than what you know  
  
We like new places that jets can't take you to  
We do like music when it does what it should do  
  
Yes oh yeah  
Yes oh yeah  
Yes (we like) oh yeah (explosions)  
Yes (we like) oh yeah (explosions)  
  
We like explosions it's only right we should  
We like ideas we thought you understood  
We like new places until they're overrun  
We do like music, loud shots from the big spudgun
