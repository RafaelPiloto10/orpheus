I gotta guitar all my own  
I gotta quarter for the telephone  
I ain't headed down this highway all alone  
One two three and maybe four  
Honey, they're knockin' on my door  
I know you're gonna miss me when I'm gone  
  
Got no daddy but I got a ma  
Think she lives in Arkansas  
Maybe I'll go see her some old day  
It ain't like she'd really care  
It ain't like she'd pay no fare  
But I might just blow on through there anyway  
  
Headed down to Alabam  
Cause some trouble if I can  
Aw, buddy, would you like to come along?  
It's a place I never been  
And you know I could use a friend  
They say they'll give us twenty bucks a song  
  
I gotta guitar all my own  
I gotta quarter for the telephone  
I ain't headed down this highway all alone  
One two three and maybe four  
Honey, they're knockin' on my door  
You know I'm gonna miss you when I'm gone
