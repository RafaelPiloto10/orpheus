An afternoon nostalgia  
Television show  
You spoke in silhouette  
(But they couldn't name you)  
Although the panel were  
Very polite to you  
But I remembered you  
Friday nights 1969  
ATV - you murdered every line  
Too old to be a child star  
Too young to take leads  
Four seasons passed  
And they axed you  
Nervous juvenile  
(Won't smile! )  
What became of you?  
Did that swift eclipse torture you?  
A star at eighteen  
And then-suddenly gone  
Down to a few lines  
In the back page of a faded annual  
Oh but I remembered you  
I remembered you.
