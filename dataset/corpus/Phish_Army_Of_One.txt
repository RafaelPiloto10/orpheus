Northern dilemma, call of the cold  
The arms of the arctic begin to unfold  
Sit in a circle facing the sun  
Get what you can now, winter is on  
  
Truth on condition, never dig deep  
Solemn reminders as groundwaters seep  
Into foundations, centers of joy  
To weaken and crumble, search and destroy  
  
Light up the city, hiding so strange  
You'd better take cover, it's love at close range  
Oh solo mission, cover of dark  
Army of one now, don't let down your guard  
  
Sit in a circle facing the sun  
Soak it in while you can, winter is on  
I got no answer but you've got no call  
I just can't compete with the weight of it all  
  
Silent treatment, stone in the rain  
Bright, shining doorway, try to remain  
Northern dilemma, call of the cold  
The arms of the arctic begin to unfold  
  
Sit in a circle facing the sun  
Soak it in while you can, winter is on  
I got no answer but you've got no call  
I just can't compete with the weight of it all
