If we knew a way to go back through time  
To the place where love was lost  
We could take each other's hand again  
And wander back across  
But we always seem to end up here  
Tryin' not to say goodbye  
Baby, we don't have to say the words  
Words can sometimes make you cry  
  
Ooh, have a good life baby  
Take good care of yourself  
Have a good life baby  
Be happy with someone else, mmm, mmm, ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo, mmm  
  
This time we really will let go  
And we won't look back again  
But pretend the sun is on a rise  
When the day is at an end  
So, let's kiss and wish each other love  
Over one more sip of wine  
Oh, honey, try to give me one last smile  
And I'll leave you one of mine  
  
Ooh, hoo-oo, have a good life baby  
Take good care of yourself, ah, ha, ha  
Have a good life baby  
Be happy with somebody else, ah, ha, oh  
  
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hey  
Have a good life baby  
Take good care of yourself, ahh  
Have a good life baby  
Hope you'll be happy with somebody else, oh, baby  
  
Have a good life baby  
Take good care of yourself, ah, ha, ho  
Have a good life baby
