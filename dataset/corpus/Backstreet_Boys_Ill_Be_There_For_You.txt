Oh  
  
Don't say a word  
I understand  
You want to know  
If I'm still your man  
Girl can't you tell  
By the touch of my hand  
I'm gonna please you  
Every way that I can  
  
I'll hold you  
(Hold you)  
Love you  
(Love you)  
I'll never let your love go  
(Let you go, Let you go)  
For always  
(For always)  
I'll stay  
Just look in my eyes  
And you'll know  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby, I'll be there for you  
Where ever you go  
What ever you do  
Girl, I've got forever in sight  
For all of my life  
I'll be there for you  
  
Mmm  
  
Don't ever doubt  
Your trust in me  
I'll give you my heart  
So honestly  
Deep in my soul  
Baby, you'll find the truth  
I'll never change  
Girl, I promise you  
  
I'll hold you  
(Hold you baby)  
Love you  
(Love you lady)  
I'll never let your love go  
(never let you go, let you go)  
For always  
(for always)  
I'll stay  
Just look in my eyes  
And you'll know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nothing and no one  
Can tear us apart  
(Tear us apart)  
You'll always be here  
Inside my heart  
(Inside my heart)  
And just as sure  
As the stars shine above  
No matter what happens  
You can count on my love  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll be there for you  
(When the morning comes)  
Where ever you go  
(When the evening falls)  
What ever you do  
(I'll be there baby)  
Girl, 'cause I've got forever in sight  
For all of my life  
I'll be there for you
