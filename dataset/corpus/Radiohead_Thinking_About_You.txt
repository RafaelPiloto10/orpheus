Been thinking about you, your records are here  
Your eyes are on my wall, your teeth are over there  
But I'm still no one, and you're now a star  
What do you care?  
Been thinking about you, and there's no rest  
Should I still love you, still see you in bed  
But I'm playing with myself?  
What do you care when the other men are far, far better?  
  
All the things you got,  
All the things you need  
Who bought you cigarettes,  
Who bribed the company to come and see you, honey  
  
I've been thinking about you, so how can you sleep?  
Those people aren't your friends, they're paid to kiss your feet  
They don't know what I know.  
Why should you care when I'm not there?  
  
Been thinking about you, and there's no rest  
Should I still love you, still see you in bed  
When I'm playing with myself?  
What do you care when I'm not there?  
  
All the things you got  
That you'll never need  
All the things you got  
I'm played out and bleed to please you  
  
Been thinking about you...
