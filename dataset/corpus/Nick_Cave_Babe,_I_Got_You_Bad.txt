Babe I got you bad  
Dreaming blood-wet dreams  
Only madmen have  
Baby I got you bad  
I wish to God I never had  
And it makes me feel so sad,  
O, Baby I got you bad  
Yeah, Babe I got you bad  
  
I long for your kiss,  
For the turn of your mouth  
Your body is a long thing  
Heading South  
And I don't know what I'm talking about  
All of my words have gone mad  
Ah, baby I got you bad  
  
Seasons have gone wrong  
And I lay me down in a bed of snow  
Darling, since you've been gone  
Well my hands, they don't know where to go  
And all of my teeth are bared,  
I got you so much I'm scared  
Ah, baby I got you bad  
  
With the sweep of my hand  
I undid all the plans  
That explode at the moment I kissed you  
On your small hot mouth  
And your caramel limbs  
That are hymns to the glory that is you.  
Look at me darlin' it's sad sad sad  
Look at me darlin' it's sad sad sad  
Baby I got you bad  
  
Smoke bilowing from the bridges  
And the rivers we swim in are boiling  
My hands are reaching for you everywhere  
But you're not there, or you're recoiling  
And a weary moon dangles from a cloud  
Oh honey, I know it's not allowed  
To say I got you bad.  
  
I got you bad...  
I got you bad...  
I got you bad...  
[Repeat and fade]
