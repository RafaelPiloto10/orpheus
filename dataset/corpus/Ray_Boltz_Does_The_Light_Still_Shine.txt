Does The Light Still Shine?  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Steve Millikan and Ray Boltz  
He used to run the mission  
This old friend of mine  
And it stood down on the corner  
Underneath a neon sign  
Had a cross that lit up heaven  
And the message "Jesus Saves"  
And each week at the old folks' home  
His question was the same  
Chorus:  
Does the light still shine?  
Does the light still shine?  
Is it bright enough  
For the lost to find?  
Does the light still shine?  
Now how was I to tell him  
They tore the old sign down,  
Explain about electric codes,  
And zoning in the town  
I knew that it would break his heart,  
I didn't want to lie  
So I just held his hand and smiled  
When he asked me the last time,  
Chorus  
In a quiet ceremony  
I began to understand  
After all the testimonies  
For this ordinary man  
He took them in, he gave them food  
He taught them of God's grace  
And as they spoke  
I saw a light  
Shining on each face  
And you may not believe it  
But I tell you that's it true  
The light kept growing brighter  
Until it filled the room  
I heard a voice say,  
This, my friend, is what  
I was speaking of...  
When you touch someone in Jesus' name  
There shines the light of love  
Oh the light still shines  
Oh the light still shines  
Yes it's bright enough  
For the lost to find  
Oh the light still shines  
Oh the light still shines  
Yes the light still shines  
And it's bright enough  
For the lost to find  
Oh the light still shines  
Yes the light still shines
