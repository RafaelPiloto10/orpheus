There's that melody again  
Burning through my head it does me in  
Turns me right around to my old friend  
Wonder how you've changed, are you still  
  
Running wild, like you do  
When all your dreams come true  
Happy days you pretend  
That your love will never end  
There's that melody again  
  
Where it's coming from I must have been  
Drifting out of time, now I'm in  
Underneath you'll find I'm just the same  
Running wild, like you do  
When all your dreams fall through  
  
I can always pretend  
That I'll fall in love again  
Running wild, like we do  
If only dreams came true  
I could even pretend  
That I'll fall in love again
