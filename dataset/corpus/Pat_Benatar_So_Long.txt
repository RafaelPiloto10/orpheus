So long, hope we'll meet again one day  
I'm hopin' maybe then you'll say  
Darlin' - I was wrong  
So long, so long, so long  
Gee, I hate to see you go - umm..  
You're really the world to me, you know  
You, you just stay so long  
  
All alone, with my memories of you  
And I can see that your lonely too  
You're my own, even though we're far apart  
But I'll keep you right here in my heart  
  
So long, so long, so long, so long  
Though you leave me hear to cry - huh..  
Or could it, could it, could it, could it be - goodbye  
Don't you know that you've been mine so long  
  
Yes I'm alone, with my memories of you  
Yes, I can dream, dream, dream, that you're lonely too  
You're my own, even though we're far apart  
Well I'll keep you right here in my heart  
  
So long, so long, so long  
Though you leave me hear to cry - huh..  
Well this could never, never, never mean goodbye  
Darlin' you, you just stay -- So Long.....
