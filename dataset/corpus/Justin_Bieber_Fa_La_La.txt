This is the time of year you could give it  
Give it, give it, give it all  
One through ten on your list your list you can get it,  
Get it, get it, get it now  
Make your wish tonight  
When you open your eyes  
When the lights go bright girl  
I'll be right there  
  
Baby you deserve everything you want  
It's your night, oh  
When put my ear to your chest girl  
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats  
Baby it sings to me like  
Fa la la, fa la la  
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats  
Baby it sings to me like  
Know that it's Christmas time  
  
You got on my favorite dress  
You're looking, looking, looking, good  
Snow falling on your hair, and I don't, I don't  
Wanna get it off  
Even the stars in the sky can't outshine your eyes  
Wanna be your biggest gift  
  
Baby you deserve everything you want  
It's your night, oh  
Wanna put my ear to your chest  
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats  
Baby it sings to me like  
Fa la la, fa la la  
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats  
Baby it sings to me like  
Know that it's Christmas time  
  
I'll deck your heart with boughs of holly  
Fa la la, fa la la  
Baby 'cause you're the reason to be jolly  
Fa la la, fa la la  
I hear melodies when your heart beats  
Baby it sings to me like  
Fa la la, fa la la  
Oh oh I hear melodies when your heart beats  
Baby it sings to me like  
Know that it's Christmas time  
Fa la la, fa la la (oh oh oh)  
Like Christmas  
Know that it's Christmas time  
Fa la la, fa la la  
Know that it's Christmas time
