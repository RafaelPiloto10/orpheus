I'm feeling down, in some kinda lonely  
Cuz my baby done left me here  
Hearts blazing like a five alarm fire  
And I don't even give a care  
I feel like the world is fallin'  
Dreams to ashes right in front of my face  
I'm gettin' kind of worried and I feel so out of place  
  
Chorus:  
Maybe my baby done made some other plans  
Maybe my baby done made some other plans  
  
In the morning when I get a heartache  
I can't call on the doctor for help  
Cuz the only person that could ever do me any good is runnin'  
Around with my best friend  
Oh, I feel like I'm slippin' deeper, lower, a little deeper into myself  
I tell you that I just can't handle it, you all  
It's scaring me to death  
  
Chorus:  
Maybe my baby done made some other plans  
Maybe my baby done made some other plans  
  
Repeat chorus
