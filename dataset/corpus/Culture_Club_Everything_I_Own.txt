You sheltered me from harm,  
Kept me warm, kept me warm  
You gave my life to me,  
Set me free, set me free  
The finest years I ever knew,  
Were all the years I had with you  
  
[Chorus]  
I would give anything I own,  
Give up my life, my heart, my home  
I would give anything I own,  
Just to have you back again  
  
You taught me how to laugh,  
What it solved, what it solved  
You never said too much,  
But still you showed the way  
And I knew from watching you  
Nobody else could ever know,  
The part of me that can't let go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Is there someone you know,  
You're loving them so  
But taking them all for granted  
You may lose them one day,  
Someone takes them away  
And they don't hear the words you long to say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just to touch you once again
