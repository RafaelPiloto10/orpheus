When I was a little boy back in West Virginia  
We lived very close to a railroad track  
And I remember I used to dream about them trains  
And where they might go  
And the people that worked on the trains  
  
And the train made music, it made you feel good  
I can remember sometimes  
I could just stand off all by myself  
And just get funky listenin' to the train  
  
And I used to pick up a handful of gravels  
And throw 'em down on the ground for ties  
Yeah, and I'd make up songs, I'd sing  
  
He was a railroad man  
He was a railroad man  
He was a railroad man  
'Til he stepped in front of the railroad train  
  
He rode across the plains  
He rode on a fruit freight train  
The hauled bananas to Savannah  
And wore bandannas made in old Japan  
  
He was a railroad man  
He was a railroad man  
And a railroad man  
'Til he stepped in front of the railroad train  
  
He used to change his name  
To every place he came  
You know, his name was Tex when he's in Texas  
And Bangor when he went to Maine  
  
And a railroad man  
No, he was a railroad man  
And a railroad man  
'Til he stepped in front of the railroad train  
  
Used to change his name  
To every place he came  
You know, his name was Tex when he's in Texas  
And Bangor when he went to Maine  
  
He rode across the plains  
He rode on a fruit freight train  
The hauled bananas to Savannah  
Wore bandannas made in old Japan  
  
And he was a railroad man  
He was a railroad man  
Oh, a railroad man  
'Til he stepped in front of the railroad train  
  
Used to change his name  
[Incomprehensible] to every place he came  
His name was Tex when he's in Texas  
And Bangor when he went to Maine  
  
You know, he was a good time railroad man  
Good time railroad man  
Oh, a railroad man  
'Til he stepped in front of the railroad train  
  
It's alright  
Say you know it's alright  
If you've ever been downtown  
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout  
  
You know, he was a good time railroad, road  
Good time railroad man  
Oh, a railroad man  
'Til he stepped in front of the railroad train  
  
He used to change his name  
To each and every place he came  
You know, his name was Tex when he's in Texas  
And Bangor when he went to Maine  
  
He rode across the plains  
He rode, he rode on a fruit freight train  
The hauled bananas to Savannah  
And wore bandannas made in old Japan  
  
Oh, railroad man  
Oh, railroad man  
Oh, railroad man  
Stepped in front of the railroad train
