[Z-Ro]  
Houston Texas is my city, Ridgemont 4 is my block  
I put my trust in no man, only my motherfucking glock  
Cause she ain't never let me down, before  
Fuck a gang I follow my bitch, cause she be busting rounds for Ro  
Unlike my homies, cause they phony than a motherfucker  
Even my broad, cause she might be fucking some other brother  
Lord knows, that I couldn't take it if I found out  
Premeditated, cause I'm about to let them automatic rounds out  
A prisoner of my own mind, losing it swiftly  
Clicking on motherfuckers, until the reaper come and get me  
Fuck a friend and a click, and a partner in crime  
Cause when you doing your bid, they won't be partners in time  
I bet they be the main reason, why you locked up in a county  
That's why I strive, to keep all the busta bitches from round me  
So take it how you want to take it, i don't give a damn  
I'm an asshole by nature, nigga this is who I am  
[Hook - 2x]  
I know they told y'all, deep down South we don't play  
Don't get too close, cause nigga I'm gon spray  
Everyone of y'all, piss me off and you gon see me touch  
Your noggin y'all, that's who I am nigga fuck you  
[Z-Ro]  
Don't worry my nigga, I'm coming to make your bail  
Wait a second, how this buster know I'm going to jail  
I seen the hatred in they faces, when the prince wanted to see me  
When they thought I was leaving, they wanted to D-E-A-D me  
Dropping salt on my name, saying I sold my soul  
And these suppose to be my people, damn my people so cold  
Why not be happy for a nigga, when he make a major move  
Chill you playing with this game, but I've been paying major dues  
I can't tell a motherfucker, how to fly a plane  
If I ain't never been up in the cockpit, you feeling me mayn  
I got a bunch of records sold, and y'all ain't sold shit  
Your foreign's at a standstill, but my Houptie's on the road bitch  
Beef with me nigga, and you can find out  
How I murder niggas with my lyrics, I ain't gotta pull my iron out  
Take it how you want to take it, i don't give a damn  
Fuck them niggas who say they down, one deep is who I am  
[Hook - 2x]  
[Z-Ro]  
I'ma follow the truth, and never follow lies  
So I'ma ride on Watts, until his fat ass apologize  
For saying what he said, about Screw  
Look who your style is named after motherfucker, you number two  
And you know what come before one, nigga this mouthpiece  
Z-Ro and S.U.C., Southside super hero  
Fucking with you pussies, cause it's time you be tampered with  
When you see me look me in the eyes, and pull up your pamper bitch  
My nigga named Tommy, say he's coming to get ya  
His people gon be swinging, everyone of em'll hit ya  
Holding on to my grudges, until my brain get a blister  
I love drama so much, because my life is so rough  
So when you see me out in public, don't you come at me wrong  
Disrespect me if you ain't, hoe I'ma fuck up your dome  
You can take it how you want to take it, I don't give a damn  
Street Military was my father, Z-Ro is who I am  
[Hook - 2x]
