Here in the country we dance and we play  
And we pray to our saints and we make love all day  
I fell in love with a real city boy  
Who's afraid of his nature, afraid of his joy  
I punched him out and brought him to this hut  
But I know he'll thank me when he wakes up  
We got trees, we got snakes, we got acres of sky  
His life in the city was making him cry  
  
Come on, come on darling, be brave for a while  
You don't look afraid when you laugh and you smile  
I'll be good, I'll be strong  
I'll be just what you needed all along

Us Amazonians know where we stand  
We got kids, we got jobs, why do we need a man?  
Us Amazonians make out alright  
But we want something to hold in the forest at night  
  
Come on, come on darling, be brave for a while  
You don't look afraid when you laugh and you smile  
Breathe in deep, stick with me  
You'll still be free as you let yourself be  
  
If you're certain, if you're true  
I'll be the only country girl for you  
I'll be good, I'll be strong  
I'll be just what you needed all along  
  
Here in the country we dance and we play  
And we pray to our saints and we make love all day  
I fell in love with a real city boy  
Gotta teach him about nature, and teach him about joy

Here's my boyfriend, he's small, he is blue  
He is cold, he is rough, he's appalling thatc
