(Out of Sight,  
Out of Mind,  
Out of Time,  
To Decide,  
Do we run, Should we hide,  
For the rest, of my life of my life) X2  
  
Dear anne my number one fan  
I write with the life of the lamp on my night stand  
With a pen in my right hand and that's also my mic hand  
Codeine in the sprite can ink on my white pad  
I'm thinking of life and wrong and right and  
Sometimes I'm right and sometimes I might  
I cannot find the light still my rhymes are bright  
So I continue my plan and I'm shore like white sand  
That there will be price paid before my flight landed  
But still I want to see more than my sight can
