You(x12)  
  
[Fabolous - Intro]  
Y'all niggas better stop playin with me  
Y'all know ya aint bout that life  
"SOUL tape"  
Niiiccee  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm callin them out  
I got they phone numbers (x2)  
When that money callin everything gon on hold (x2)  
  
[Fabolous - Verse 1]  
I'm having doubts, what they really believe  
Starting with these Stefan Urquelle, who really be Steve  
Photoshop don't make it better, it really deceive  
Long hair don't care, but it really be weave  
Lets get back to this real shit  
That life, I'm bout  
Anytime that I'm out, I keep ballin like there's no time out  
On the kush I'm stoned out  
  
On you haters, I zone out  
Y'all opinions don't make me money  
So what yall thinkin don't count  
I mean the nerve of these niggas giving me attitude  
When I be serving these niggas  
You rappers platter food  
  
[Chorus:] (x2)  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Saying they overrated is a understatement  
Them niggas is broke, look like they under maintanence  
They rapping bout mansions, but from they momma's basement  
Swear they in phantoms, but drive a honda station  
Lets get back to this real shit  
Stay away from that counterfeit  
That fake-it till you make-it life, really don't amount to shit  
Talkin never bothers us, sometimes it do bore me  
So if ya makin movies, hope it based on a true story  
Freck said "nothings worse than a rich hater"  
When money call, pick it up n call that bitch later  
  
[Chorus:] (x2)
