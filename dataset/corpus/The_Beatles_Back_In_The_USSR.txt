Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC  
Didn't get to bed last night  
On the way the paper bag was on my knee  
Man, I had a dreadful flight  
I'm back in the USSR  
You don't know how lucky you are, boy  
Back in the USSR, yeah  
  
Been away so long I early knew the place  
Gee, it's good to be back home  
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case  
Honey disconnect the phone  
I'm back in the USSR  
You don't know how lucky you are, boy  
Back in the US  
Back in the US  
Back in the USSR  
  
Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out  
They leave the west behind  
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout  
That Georgia's always on my my my my my my my my my mind  
Oh, come on  
Hu hey hu, hey, ah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
I'm back in the USSR  
You don't know how lucky you are, boys  
Back in the USSR  
  
Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out  
They leave the west behind  
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout  
That Georgia's always on my my my my my my my my my mind  
  
Oh, show me round your snow peaked  
Mountain way down south  
Take me to your daddy's farm  
Let me hear your balalaika's ringing out  
Come and keep your comrade warm  
I'm back in the USSR  
Hey, you don't know how lucky you are, boy  
Back in the USSR
