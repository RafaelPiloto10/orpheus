I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you  
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you  
Love you, I love you, I love you  
At the beach, in a pool  
In a lunchroom at school  
In a drive-in, child, in a car  
It don't matter, darlin', where you are  
I don't know how to show  
How I feel, but it's real  
Ain't no way I can say  
Just how real that I feel, but  
I wanna show you how I can please you  
'Cause I want you and I need you  
Gotta have you, gotta know you  
Let me love you and let me show you that
