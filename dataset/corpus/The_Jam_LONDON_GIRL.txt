Do you know what you're looking for?  
Streets of gold, fame and fortune?  
You didn't fancy working in a factory  
But your mum and dad didn't agree  
  
You slept on Waterloo station at first  
But now you've moved to a posher squat  
You wonder where your next meal will come from  
Still it's better than living at home  
  
You're looking tired 'cause it's been three weeks  
Since you changed your clothes or washed your feet  
But you're learning fast all the time  
How to cadge cigarettes and pills  
  
I don't condemn what you done  
I know what it is to be young  
You're only searching for today  
To see the answers about yesterday -  
And I hope you find
