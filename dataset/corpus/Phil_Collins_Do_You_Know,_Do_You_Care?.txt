You said you would, you didn't and I want to know why  
And don't make no excuses  
You promised, you promised, you better explain  
Tho' I don't know what the use is  
You said you could, you couldn't, now why did you lie  
You made it look so easy  
You did it, why do it, what was your point?  
Laughing while you tease me  
  
Oh, do you know and do you care?  
  
I said I did, I shouldn't 'cause the magic will go  
It happened once before  
You'll see it, you'll steal it and take it away  
And then come back for more  
Don't say you weren't, you were 'cause I saw you myself  
It's too late for your reason  
You're lying, you're lying, you've done it this time  
I'm sick of all the cheating  
  
Oh, well do you know and do you care?  
  
Cause I watch you  
Oo every day I watch you pass me by  
I'll get you  
Yes in the end I'll get you  
Just watch me try  
  
Oh you make it hard to be hard but I'm trying my best  
Cause down inside I'm burnin'  
You want it, you get it, now take it and run  
I'll hide how much it's hurtin'  
  
Oh, well do you know and do you care?  
Oh, well do you know and do you care?
