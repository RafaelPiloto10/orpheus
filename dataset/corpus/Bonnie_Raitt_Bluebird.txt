Listen to my bluebird laugh  
She can't tell you why  
Deep within in her heart, you see  
She knows only crying  
Oh just lie  
  
There she sits, a lofty perch  
Strangest color blue  
Flying is forgotten, now  
Thinks only of you...just you...awh yeah  
  
So get all those blues  
Must be a thousand yous  
And you just differently used, you just know  
You sit there mesmerized, by the depth of her eyes  
If you could categorize, she got soul  
She got soul, she got soul, she got soul  
  
Do you think she loves you  
Do you think at all  
  
Soon she's going to fly away  
Sadness is her own  
Give herself a bath of tears  
And go home, and go home
