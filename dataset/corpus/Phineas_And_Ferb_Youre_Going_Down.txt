You're goin' down) You're goin' down when I get mom to see  
(Down to the ground) This ridiculous monstrosity  
(You're goin' down) You'll never get away with this again  
(You're goin' down) You're G-O-I-N-G D-O-W-N  
(You're goin' down) Spread the news from coast to coast  
(Down to the ground) You're goin' down, your operation exposed  
(You're goin' down) I could say more, but I don't wanna boast  
(You're goin' down) Get used to butter, cause you both are toast!  
  
If a certain condition arises  
I'm the one to avert the crisis  
You think you're livin' large, but you forgot that I'm the one in charge...  
Conditionally!  
  
You're goin' down, down, down, down, down, down, down  
You're goin' down!
