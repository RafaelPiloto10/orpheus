Oh this must mean something  
For us to endure all the hurt  
And I've tried to analyze through  
If maybe it's more than it's worth  
  
I've already found a mountain to move  
Should that be all that it takes?  
And it isn't like there's nothing to lose  
Only me, only you  
  
I don't notice if it's night or day  
I stand around in the pouring rain  
I don't answer when they call my name  
I will come to if only you come back to me  
  
Like the shadow that follows  
I wander around in a trance  
You could wake me from this big sleep  
All that we take is a chance  
  
We could run away somewhere alone  
Make up a little lost time  
'Cause there's nothing worse than nowhere to go  
All alone, no one home  
  
I don't notice if it's night or day  
I stand around in the pouring rain  
I don't answer when they call my name  
I'll be rescued if only you come back to me  
  
More than long enough  
We've been holding all the way  
If you wait too long  
The colors start to fade  
  
'Cause it isn't like there's nothing to lose  
Only me, only you  
  
I don't notice if it's night or day  
I stand around in the pouring rain  
I don't answer when they call my name  
I will come to if only you come back to me  
  
I don't notice if it's night or day  
I stand around in the pouring rain  
I don't answer when they call my name  
I will come to if only you come back...  
I'll be rescued if only you come back...  
I'll get through if only you come back... To me  
  
Back to me, baby...  
  
Come back to me...  
  
Come back to me...
