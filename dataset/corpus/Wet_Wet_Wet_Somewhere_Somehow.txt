If you're there and you care  
And you listen very careful, darling  
You'll hear my prayer  
  
And if you hear, loud and clear  
You would get a million kisses from me  
Somewhere, somehow  
  
And if the night's a lonely time for you  
Just listen to the words I gave to you  
Let the song of ours play one more time  
Somewhere, somehow  
I'll be there  
  
Went out walkin' in the morning  
Standing in the pouring rain  
Let it run all over me  
  
Stayed up late last night  
Tryin' to put all the things right  
Then your tears roll over me  
  
And if the night's a lonely time for you  
Just listen to the words I gave to you  
Let the song of ours play one more time  
Somewhere somehow  
I'll be there  
  
If you're there, and you care  
You'll get a million kisses from me  
Somewhere, somehow  
  
And if you feel like I feel  
Love cuts the deepest part of me  
Somewhere, somehow  
  
And if the night's a lonely time for you  
Just listen to the words I gave to you  
Let the song of ours play one more time  
Somewhere, somehow  
I'll be there
