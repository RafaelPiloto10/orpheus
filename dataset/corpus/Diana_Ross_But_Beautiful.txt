Love is funny, or it's sad,  
Or it's quiet, or it's mad  
It's a good thing, or it's bad,  
But beautiful  
  
Beautiful to take a chance,  
And if you fall, you fall  
And I'm thinkin'  
I wouldn't mind at all  
  
Love is tearful, or it's gay,  
It's a problem, or it's play  
It's a heartache either way,  
But beautiful  
  
And I'm thinkin' if you were mine,  
I'd never let you go,  
And that would be just beautiful I know  
Beautiful to take a chance,  
And if you fall, you fall  
And I'm thinkin'  
I wouldn't mind at all  
  
Love is tearful, or it's gay,  
It's a problem, or it's play  
It's a heartache either way,  
But beautiful  
  
And I'm thinking if you were mine  
I would never let you go!  
And that would be so beautiful  
Yes, that would be but beautiful  
I know!
