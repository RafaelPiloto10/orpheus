One night, half a dozen tourists met together in Trafalgar Square  
A fourth nights tour on the continent was planned  
And each had his portmento in his hand  
Down the Rhine they ment to have a picnic to Joan siad I must decline  
The boys are being advised by me  
Stay away from Germany  
What's the good of going down the Rhine  
  
Chorus:  
Let's all go down the strand  
Let's all go down the strand  
I'll be leader, You can march behind  
Come with me and see what you can find  
Let's all go down the strand  
Oh what a happy land  
That's the place for fun and noise  
All amoung the girls and boys  
So let's all go down the strand  
  
One day 5 and 20 convicts  
Satted by their 20 little cells  
The bell then sounded ding-a-ding-a-dong  
To exercise the prisoners came along  
Buggler Ben exclaimed to Jacks The Warden  
To me sir, It's very strange  
The men are tired of going round  
Round and round the same old ground  
I purpose we make a little change  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Gray crowds gathered round to welcome  
Shackleton returning from the poll  
The Lord Mayor welcomed all the galant crew  
And said my lads, I've got a treat for you  
Come with me, The mansion house awaits you  
A banquet shall be supplied  
But a towering, grumbling mood  
Said we don't want any food  
Then he turned to Shackleton and sighed  
  
Repeat chorus (x2)
