Hard days I'm traveling alone for too long  
Ooh Ooh, I'm missing you  
I'm always somewhere that I never belong  
Ooh Ooh, I'm missing you  
  
I'm moving so fast now it doesn't seem true  
Ooh Ooh, I'm missing you  
I'm getting closer but I don't know what to  
Ooh Ooh, I'm missing you  
  
Oh, if I had you beside me  
Then I just might sleep through the night  
Your love is the promise that guides me  
All of the days of my life  
  
This life I'm living's getting so hard to feel  
Ooh Ooh, I'm missing you  
The days are empty and the nights are unreal  
Ooh Ooh, I'm missing you  
  
Oh, if I had you beside me  
Then I just might sleep through the night  
Your love is the promise that guides me  
All of the days of my life  
All of the days of my life  
  
Hard days I'm traveling alone for too long  
Ooh Ooh, I'm missing you  
I'm always somewhere that I never belong  
Ooh Ooh, I'm missing you  
Oh, if I had you beside me  
Then I just might sleep through the night  
Your love is the promise that guides me  
All of the days of my life  
All of the days of my life  
All of the days of my life
