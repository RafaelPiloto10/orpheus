There she lies, a vision in the dark  
Invader of my heart  
Look at me, behaving like a fool possessed  
Damned if I'll be doomed  
By this woman 'neath the moon over madness  
Shall I kiss the mouth, stroke the hair  
Undress her - do I dare  
Or bite into the vein above her heaving breast  
Ah, the sun best come up soon  
There's no telling with the moon over madness  
And when I see her face  
The tuft of hair beneath the lace  
I feel the fire of mortal men  
As she draws a languorous breath  
So full of life, so close to death  
I'm filled with wild revenge  
Shall I tear into her skin  
Let the beast inside me win  
I'm so uncertain  
Or shall I fight my heart no more  
Ease my lover to the floor  
And loose my burden  
What I'd give to know just what I am  
A monster or a man  
An angel born of Hell, or simply human flesh  
One of which is in this room  
Wondering 'neath the mood over madness  
Shall I tear into her skin  
Let the beast inside me win  
I'm so uncertain  
Or shall I end this lonely war  
Ease my lover to the floor  
And loose my burden  
Woman won't you hold me in your arms  
Before you come to harm  
And take this tender love and drive it through my chest  
Stike hard, do it soon  
There's no telling with the moon over madness  
My madness  
Over you
