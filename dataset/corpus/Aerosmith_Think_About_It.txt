When will the clouds all blow it away  
When will the good people have their say  
Now I hope you're still around to see the day  
  
[Chorus]  
Take a while, think about it  
Take a while, think about it  
Take a while, think about it  
  
Who's gonna tell what is up or down  
Who can be the king or be the clown  
Then climb your tree, take a look around  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Take it nobody out, if it in the tame  
That which is now, will be again  
Who can decide who is insane  
  
[Chorus]
