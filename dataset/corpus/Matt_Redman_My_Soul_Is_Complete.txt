Father of everlasting grace  
Be my comfort in this broken place  
I'll rest upon the perfect love  
In You, in You  
  
Faithful Lord You never change  
When all is lost, You remain  
Saviour all my hope is found  
In You, in You  
  
Chorus:  
My soul is complete in Jesus, in Jesus  
Your grace and Your truth  
Have made a way, and now I'm free in You  
  
King of glory be lifted high  
I'll worship You Lord with my whole life  
Fill my heart with a joy that's only found  
In You, in You  
  
Chorus 2  
My soul is complete in Jesus, in Jesus  
Your grace and Your truth  
Have made a way, and now I'm free  
My soul is complete in Jesus, in Jesus  
Your grace and Your truth  
Have made a way, and now I'm free in You  
  
Bridge:  
With hands held high I'll live my life  
To worship You, be glorified  
With hands held high I'll live my life  
To worship You, be glorified  
  
Chorus 2
