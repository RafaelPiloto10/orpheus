Let is snow, let is snow  
  
The weather outside is frightful  
The fire is so delightful  
We've got no place to go  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
Let is snow  
  
It doesn't show sings of stopping  
I've brought some corn for popping  
The lights are turned way down low  
Let it snow, let is snow, let it snow  
  
When we finally kiss goodnight  
How I hate going out in the storm  
If you'll really hold me tight  
All the way home I'll be warm  
  
The fire is slowly dying, oh, my dear  
We're still goodbyeing  
As long as you love me so  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
Let is snow, let is snow, let is snow  
  
When we finally kiss goodnight  
How I hate going out in the storm  
If you'll really hold me tight  
All the way home I'll be warm  
  
The weather outside is frightful  
The fire is so delightful  
As long as you love me so  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
Let is snow, let is snow  
Let is snow, let is snow
