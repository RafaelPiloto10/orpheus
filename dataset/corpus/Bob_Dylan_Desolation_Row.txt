They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting  
the passports brown  
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in  
town  
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a  
trance  
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in  
his pants  
And the riot squad they're restless, they need somewhere to  
go  
As Lady and I look out tonight, from Desolation Row  
  
Cinderella, she seems so easy, "It takes one to know one,"  
she smiles  
And puts her hands in her back pockets Bette Davis style  
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning. "You Belong to Me I  
Believe"  
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend, you  
Better leave"  
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go  
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row  
  
Now the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to  
hide  
The fortune telling lady has even taken all her things  
inside  
All except for Cain and Abel and the hunchback of Notre Dame  
  
Everybody is making love or else expecting rain  
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready  
for the show  
He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row  
  
Now Ophelia, she's 'neath the window for her I feel so  
afraid  
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid  
To her, death is quite romantic she wears an iron vest  
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness  
And though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow  
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row  
  
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood with his memories in a  
trunk  
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk  
He looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette  
  
As he when off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet  
  
Now you would not think to look at him, but he was famous  
long ago  
For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row  
  
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup  
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up  
Now his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the  
cyanide hole  
And she also keeps the cards that read, "Have Mercy on His  
Soul"  
They all play on the penny whistles, you can hear them blow  
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row  
  
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're  
getting ready for the feast  
The Phantom of the Opera a perfect image of a priest  
They're spoon feeding Casanova to get him to feel more  
assured  
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning  
him with words  
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, "Get Outa Here  
If You Don't Know  
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row"  
  
Now at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew  
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do  
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack  
machine  
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene  
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go  
Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row  
  
Praise be to Nero's Neptune the Titanic sails at dawn  
And everybody's shouting, "Which Side Are You On?"  
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's  
tower  
While calypso singers laugh at them and fishermen hold  
flowers  
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow  
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation row  
  
Yes, I received your letter yesterday (About the time the  
doorknob broke)  
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of  
joke  
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're  
quite lame  
I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another  
name  
Right now, I can't read too good, don't send me no more  
letters no  
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row
