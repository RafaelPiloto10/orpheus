Waiting throughout the year  
For Christmas morning to be here  
And counting how many days  
Till Christmas morning, drawing near  
On Christmas morning  
I'll wake up bright and early  
Be the first one out of bed  
With the mistletoe above my head  
On Christmas morning  
We can sing and celebrate  
And make the feeling stay  
All through the day  
Presents under the tree  
There's one from me to you and you to me  
Family and friends are here  
On the very best morning of the year  
On Christmas morning  
I'll wake up bright and early  
Be the first one out of bed  
With the mistletoe above my head  
On Christmas morning  
We can sing and celebrate  
And make the feeling stay  
All through the day  
On Christmas morning  
I'll wake up bright and early  
Be the first one out of bed  
With the mistletoe above my head  
On Christmas morning  
We can sing and celebrate  
And make the feeling stay  
All through the day
