Mama, why did you do it?  
Mama, who drove you to it?  
  
Was it the pigs in grey suits  
Persecuting you?  
Uncivil servants  
Unconcerned at how they frightened you  
Life is nothing much to lose  
It's just so lonely here without you  
  
Mama, why did you do it?  
Mama, who drove you to it?  
  
Spare priggish money men  
Who scared the life out of you  
Bailiffs with bad breath  
I will slit their throats for you  
Life is nothing much to lose  
It's just so lonely here without you, mama  
  
Life is nothing much to lose  
It's just so lonely here without you  
  
So, we're gonna run to you  
We're gonna come to you  
We're gonna lie down beside you, mama  
  
We're gonna be with you  
We're gonna join you  
We're gonna lie down beside you, mama  
  
And we will be safe and sheltered in our graves  
We'll come before you  
And we will kiss you  
By way of one final hug, mama
