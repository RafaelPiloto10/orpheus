(Bill Withers)  
  
When I'm kissing my love  
I can hear a thump thumping in my head  
Mmm when I'm kissing my love  
I close my eyes and see  
A pretty city  
With a million flowerbeds  
  
Ah I can hear the angels sing  
Songs that only angels sing  
He's such a pretty thing  
That I can feel my heart  
Just a thumping and a skipping  
When I'm kissing my love  
  
Mmm ah when I'm kissing my love  
I feel the blood pumping in my veins  
Mmm when I'm kissing my love  
He's such a tender sender  
With a sweet young frame  
  
Oh he's so good at what he does  
All I wanna do is kiss and hug  
He's got me in love  
And I can feel my heart  
Just a thumping and a skipping  
When I'm kissing my love  
  
When I'm kissing my love  
When he's kissing me  
When I'm kissing my love  
When he's kissing me  
When he's kissing me  
When I'm kissing my love  
When he's kissing me  
When I'm kissing my love  
  
When I'm kissing my love  
When he's kissing me  
When I'm kissing my love  
When he's kissing me  
When he's kissing me  
When I'm kissing my love  
When he's kissing me  
When I'm kissing my love  
When he's kissing me  
When I'm kissing my love  
When he's kissing me  
When I'm kissing my love  
  
Ah when I'm kissing my love  
I feel the blood pumping in my veins  
Oh when I'm kissing my love  
He's such a tender sender  
With a sweet young frame  
  
Oh now he's so good at what he does  
All I wanna do is kiss and hug  
He's got me in love  
And I can feel my heart  
Just a thumping and a skipping  
When I'm kissing my love  
  
When I'm kissing my love  
When he's kissing me  
(repeat chorus)
