Can't you see, she don't want you around no more  
Can't you see, that her hand's pointing at the door  
Feet don't fail me now  
How could anyone stay  
Anyone could see it's time to go away  
Time to take a powder  
Open up your eyes  
But it feels like my legs have been paralyzed  
  
Feet don't fail me now  
Begging please don't make a fool of me  
Feet don't fail me now  
Please don't keep me where i should not be  
Feet don't fail me now  
Stop pretending that you've gone to sleep  
Feet don't fail me now  
Begging please don't make a fool of me  
  
See your things piled in the hall  
Turn around, there's a new picture on the wall  
Feet don't fail me now  
We're the last ones to know  
Anyone could see it's time for us to go  
Time to hit the highway  
Nothing left to do  
But it feels like my shoes have been crazy glued
