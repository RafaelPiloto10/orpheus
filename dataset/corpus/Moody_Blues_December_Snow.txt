Like December snow  
That lays in the wood  
You're gone too soon  
I knew you should  
  
With October skies  
You brought your love  
But November came  
Taking all I have and  
Time, take this sadness from me  
Time, bring my heart back safely  
Hold on to warm September  
'Cause life can be like December snow  
  
With your touch of love  
In this Autumn world  
The Sun was bright  
The songs were heard  
  
And maybe fools like me  
Are under your spell  
But with leaves that fall  
I hear you callin'  
  
Time, take this sadness from me  
Time, bring my heart back safely  
Hold on to warm September  
'Cause life can be like December Snow  
  
Time, take this sadness from me  
Time, bring my heart back safely  
Hold on to warm September  
'Cause life can be like December Snow
