Free to turn like the wind on a summer day  
Heart worn, like a ring around the moon  
And your eyes are ablaze, reflections of time passing by  
That remind you there's much more to life than standing still  
  
Or running from place to place in the heat of the day  
Just follow your heart and you'll see, there's more to life  
  
There beyond the horizon, there's another day  
Far above the pain and fear you feel  
The power and the peace, the greatest sensation of all  
There is much more to life than you'll ever know, the rise and fall  
  
There'll always be you and me, we're moving as one  
So follow your heart and you'll see, there's more to life  
  
We all have our dreams, we all have our visions  
But time after time, we're faced with decisions  
Which road to follow? How hard to fight?  
Then you wake up and see that there's much more to life  
  
Free in acres of sky on a summer day  
Fire that burns with hope inside your heart  
We are never apart, reflections of time passing by  
That remind you there's much more to life  
  
So just follow your heart and you'll see  
If you follow your heart you'll be free  
'Cause there's more to life, more to life
