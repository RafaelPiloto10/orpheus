I believe in music,  
I believe in love, love, love!  
I believe in music,  
I believe in love!  
  
Well I can just sit around makin' music all day long,  
Long as I'm makin' music, I can't do nobody no wrong!  
And who knows maybe someday I'll come up with a song,  
That makes people want to stop their fussin' an' fightin'  
Long enough to sing along!  
  
I believe in music,  
I believe in love . . .  
I believe in music,  
I believe in love!  
  
Music is love, love is music, if you know what I mean,  
People who believe in music are the happiest people I've ever seen!  
So clap your hands an' stomp your feet, shake your tambourine,  
( Lift your voices to the sky ) God loves you when you sing!  
  
I believe in music,  
I believe in love . . .  
I believe in music,  
I believe in love!  
  
Music is the universal language and love is the key,  
To brotherhood an' peace an' understandin' to live in harmony!  
So, take your brothers by the hand and sing along with me,  
Find out what it really means to be young, rich an' free!  
  
I believe in music,  
I believe in love . . .  
I believe in music,  
I believe in love!  
  
I believe in music,  
I believe in love . . .  
I believe in music,  
I believe in love!  
I believe in music,  
I believe in love . . .
