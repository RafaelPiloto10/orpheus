How can I tell you  
That I love you,  
I love you  
But I can't think of right words to say  
  
I long to tell you  
That I'm always thinking of you...  
I'm always thinking of you,  
But my words just blow away,  
Just blow away  
  
It always ends up to one thing, honey  
And I can't think of right words to say  
  
Wherever I am girl,  
I'm always walking with you  
I'm always walking with you,  
But I look and you're not there  
  
Whoever I'm with,  
I'm always, always talking to you  
I'm always talking to you,  
And I'm sad that you can't hear,  
Sad that you can't hear  
  
It always ends up to one thing, honey,  
When I look and you're not there  
  
I need to know you,  
Need to feel my arms around you  
Feel my arms around you,  
Like a sea around a shore  
  
Each night and day I pray,  
In hope that I might find you,  
In hope that I might find you,  
Because heart's can do no more  
Can do no more  
  
It always ends up to one thing, honey,  
Still I kneel upon the floor  
  
How can I tell you  
That I love you,  
I love you  
But I can't think of right words to say  
  
I long to tell you  
That I'm always thinking of you  
I'm always thinking of you....  
  
It always ends up to one thing, honey  
And I can't think of right words to say
