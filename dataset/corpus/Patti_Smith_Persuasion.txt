What is the system that gets around  
Recruits hearts with its timeless rhythm  
The young glow but old men know  
It's all a part of some crazy schism  
  
Coming on like the dawn unrelenting light  
Streets thick with its radiating  
It's all aglow but we all know  
True love is so complicated  
  
Feeling funny don't know why  
On a plane circling high  
Equation persuasion  
It's just persuasion  
  
What is the body that has nobody  
Go through life with nobody at all  
It come and go where the wind blow  
When persuasion come to call  
  
Got me reeling don't know why  
I'm on a plane circling high  
Equation persuasion  
Got the feeling I'm running in place  
Caught in the orbit of the human race  
Equation persuasion  
It's just persuasion  
It's jut persuasion  
It's just persuasion  
  
What is the body that has nobody  
What is the rise without the fall  
What is illusion without beauty  
What is the system that's no system at all  
  
Hey scout there's no equation  
You can't prepare for the heart's invasion  
You can't prepare for the heart's invasion  
Love is its own
