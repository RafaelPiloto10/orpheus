i join the dots and i post date this letter  
so cross out my name you'd do best to forget her  
collapse of synapse she can't tie her laces  
learn to forgive her forget her disgraces  
i join the dots and i brought shame upon you  
so cross out my name as i come to seduce you  
i join the dots and i cry insurrection  
the river runs through it she knows my defection  
expose her devises you knew all along  
the girl in the mirror she'll sing you a song  
i join the dots and i brought shame upon you  
so cross out my name as i come to seduce you  
i become you  
i join the dots and this river below me  
for i am the rain and i'm running down country  
reach out on a limb and i touched severed vein  
her breath in the mirror i'll cross out my name
