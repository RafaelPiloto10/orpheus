She's got legs, she knows how to use them.  
She never begs, she knows how to choose them.  
She's holdin' leg wonderin' how to feel them.  
Would you get behind them if you could only find them?  
She's my baby, she's my baby,  
Yeah, it's alright.  
  
She's got hair down to her fanny.  
She's kinda jet set, try undo her panties.  
Every time she's dancin' she knows what to do.  
Everybody wants to see if she can use it.  
She's so fine, she's all mine,  
Girl, you got it right.  
  
She's got legs, she knows how to use them.  
She never begs, she knows how to choose them.  
She's got a dime all of the time,  
Stays out at night movin' through time.  
Oh, I want her, said, I got to have her,  
The girl is alright, she's alright.
