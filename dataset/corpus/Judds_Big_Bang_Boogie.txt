About 14 Billion years ago  
God put on a really big show  
He winked his eye  
Let a thunderbolt fly  
And the moon and the stars  
Appeared in the sky  
His toes started tappin'  
Finers started snappin'  
He laughed jumpin' Jupiter  
This is happenin'  
  
He did the Big Bang Boogie  
He did the Big Bang Boogie  
He did the Big Bang Boogie  
He said,"Let the dance begin!"  
  
He made the birds of the air  
The fish of the sea  
The beasts of the field,  
Adam and Eve  
He worked six days long  
Gettin' it right  
Then,just for fun he made Saturday night  
  
He hollered,  
"Gabriel,grab your horn and call some friends"  
And then all the saints came marchin' on in  
  
Doin' the Big Bang Boogie  
The Big Bang Boogie  
They did the Big Bang Boogie  
  
The skies not the limit anymore  
Infinity has your future in store  
When your all stressed up with no place to go  
There is a timeless place you already know  
It's your inner space honey  
Your greatest frontier and the sound of silence you just might hear  
  
The big bang boogie  
The big bang boogie  
The big bang boogie  
It's an atomic rockin' good time  
The big bang boogie  
The big bang boogie  
The big bang boogie  
It's a galactic groovin' time  
Big bang boogie  
Big bang boogie  
Big bang boogie  
It's the big bang boogie  
The big bang boogie  
The big bang boogie  
The big bang boogie  
It's a cosmic rockin' good time  
The big bang boogie  
A Supernatural swinging time
