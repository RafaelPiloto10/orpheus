On the streets of la  
Where the future is now  
We dance like nobody's watching us  
And we live like we want to  
But it can all get a little crazy  
Unless there's something to hold onto  
For me, that was true love  
  
I was a young girl, selfish and wild  
Like a fire in la  
Hot like the summer and mean like a child  
Who keeps crying till she gets her way  
(Like a true star)  
There were roses in my hair,  
Rock n roll on blare, and I was in trouble  
And no one could rock me like you could  
I was a bad girl gone good  
  
Look at me now, I have everything  
You gave to me and my heart can sing  
I was a kid who could only drink  
Dance on tables, makin' deal with devils,  
Like a drunk beauty queen  
Fighting the fantasy, hooked on the scene,  
And it brought me to my knees  
And it's all... Because... Of you  
  
(You know what I'm talkin' about)  
  
It was a mad world, we lived for fun  
And we got shit for free  
Had a face like an angel,  
But inside my heart was as black as a broke movie screen  
(It was pretty sad)  
But then I saw you standing there, like a millionaire  
Give me a number, call me before I get stupid  
Make me uncrazy like you did  
  
Look at me now, I have everything  
You gave to me and my heart can sing  
I was a kid who could only drink  
Dance on tables, makin' deal with devils like a drunk beauty queen  
Fighting the fantasy, hooked on the scene,  
But you brought me to my knees  
And it's all... Because... Of you  
  
It isn't hard to see, you got a hold on me,  
Give me your money, love me to death  
Talk like a baby, cause I'm so elated  
You tell me that I ain't seen nothing quite yet  
  
(I don't wanna lose it, I'm in love, but I didn't choose it)  
  
Roses in my hair, dancing in the air, feels like I'm flying  
Tell me you love me, boy, do it  
It's just like I thought, I just knew it  
  
Look at me now, I have everything  
You gave to me and my heart can sing  
I was a kid who could only drink  
Dance on tables, makin' deal with devils like a drunk beauty queen  
Fighting the fantasy, hooked on the scene,  
You bring me to my knees  
And it's all... Because... Of you  
Yeah it's all... Because... Of you
