My shattered dreams and broken heart are mending on the shelf.  
I saw you holding hands, standing close to someone else.  
Still I sit all alone, wishing all my feelings were gone.  
I gave my best to you, nothing for me to do..  
  
Chorus:  
But have one last cry, one last cry, Before I leave it all behind. I got to
put you out of my mind, this time, believe a lie, I guess I'm down to my last
cry.  
  
I was here, you were there, guess we never could agree.  
While the sun shines on you, I need some love to rain on me.  
Still I sit all alone, wishing all my feelings were gone.  
Gotta get over you, nothing for me to do...  
  
Chorus:  
But have one last cry, one last cry, before I leave it all behind. I got to
put you out of my mind, this time, believe a lie, I know I've gotta be strong,
cause 'round me life goes on and on, and on and on... Ohh..  
  
I'm gonna dry my eyes, right after I get my..  
  
Chorus:  
One last cry, one last cry, before I leave it all behind, I got to put you out
of my mind for the very last time, believe a lie, I guess I'm down, I guess
I'm down, I guess I'm down, to my last cry.
