Here I go again it's another messy morning  
Walk around the clothes that are covering the floor and  
Take my kiss and coffee to go  
Then put on my mascara while I'm driving down the road  
I thought that I could do it all  
Turns out I was crazy  
Man I need an iPhone and a cleaning lady  
We haven't had a date night in what seems like forever  
It might take a miracle to get myself together  
  
Oh I wish that there were more than  
24 hours in a day  
I haven't found it yet but there's gotta be a way  
And I keep praying that  
I can get everything done  
And still have time for love  
And a load of laundry  
  
I'd sure like to relax laying in a bubble bath  
But then I'd have to clean the tub and really who's got time for that  
There goes my day dream I'm just wishful thinking  
Oh shoot I'm running late, I gotta make it to a meeting  
  
I've been waiting for this moment all day, just you and me  
The lights are low, next thing I know  
We're both drifting off to sleep
