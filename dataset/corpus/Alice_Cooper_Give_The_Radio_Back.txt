Hey teacher, whatcha trying to do?  
I'm gettin' tired livin' in this zoo  
You slap my face and you knock me down  
You beat my head right in the ground  
I never ever felt this way before  
I can't take it no more  
  
So give the radio...  
Yeah, give the radio back  
Give the radio back to the maniacs, to the maniacs..  
  
Well, there's a party going on outside  
All my friends got ya terrified  
Don't call the cops, call the State Police  
Don't break up this blown-out symphony  
You think I'm wasting all my precious time  
You say my music oughta be a crime  
  
Give the radio  
Give the radio back  
Yeah, give the radio back  
To the maniac  
To the maniacs  
  
I never ever felt this way before  
Ain't gonna take it no more  
  
Yeah, give the radio..  
Give the radio back  
Ah, give the radio back  
To the maniacs  
To the maniacs  
Oh, give the radio  
To the maniacs  
Oh, give the radio  
To the maniacs  
Give it, give it, give it, give it, give, give, give give give the radio  
To the maniacs  
The little maniacs  
You're all maniacs
