It's alright to tell me  
What you think about me  
I won't try to argue  
Or hold it against you  
I know that you're leaving  
You must have your reasons  
The season is calling  
And your pictures are falling down  
  
The steps that I retrace  
The sad look on your face  
The timing and structure  
Did you hear she fucked him?  
A day late a buck short  
I'm writing the report  
On losing and failing  
When I move I'm flailing now  
  
And it'll happen once again I'll turn to a friend  
Someone that understands  
Sees through the master plan  
  
But everybody's gone  
And I've been here for too long  
To face this on my own  
Well I guess this is growing up  
  
Well I guess this is growing up  
  
And maybe I'll see you  
At a movie sneak preview  
You'll show up and walk there  
On the arm of that girl  
And I'll smile and you'll wave  
We'll pretend it's okay  
The charade it won't last  
When she's gone I won't come back  
  
And it'll happen once again I'll turn to a friend  
Someone that understands  
Sees through the master plan  
  
But everybody's gone  
And I've been here for too long  
To face this on my own  
Well I guess this is growing up  
  
Well, I guess this is growing up [4x]  
Well, I guess this is growing up
