Oh, you know, we'll get it right this time. I could be up  
There with you so high, girl. (I really love you baby).  
Oh and I say. living my life in my own kind of way. this  
Time, this time, this time. smacked on my chin but I'm back  
With a grin. this time, this time, this time. I know I was  
Wrong but I won't go it alone. this time, this time. this time.  
It won't be the same if you stay with me, baby.  
Heaven so high. I see you so clear. making up this time.  
Oh, you know, we'll get it right this time. this time will be  
For sure. I could be up there with you some time, girl. this  
Time will be for sure. (I really love you baby).  
It's been a year. but where there's love there is nothing to  
Fear. this time, this time, this time. made my mistakes but  
No foot on the brakes. this time.  
Heaven so wide. it seemed so clear. time after time after  
Time.  
Look at the way love has gone. up there in your lonely room  
Tonight. look at yourself pretty one. I could be holding you  
Oh so tight.  
You know, we'll get it right this time. this time will be for  
Sure. I could be up there with you so high, girl. this time  
Will be for sure. (I really love you baby).  
Look at the way love has gone. talk about, talk about, talk  
About, talk about. don't let it disappear now. up there  
Alone in your room every night. isn't it sad what I see? all  
Alone all alone all alone all alone. is this the way it should  
Be? open the book and then take one mad look back.  
Oh, you know, we'll get it right this time. this time will be  
For sure. I could be up there with you so high, girl. this time  
Will be for sure.  
(I really love you baby). oh, you know, we'll get it right this  
Time. I could be up there with you so tight, girl. this time  
Will be for sure. (I really love you baby).  
Oh, you know, we'll get it right this time. oh, you know,  
We'll get it right this time will be for sure. oh, you know,  
We'll get it right this time. oh, you know, we'll get it right  
This time this time will be for sure, girl.
