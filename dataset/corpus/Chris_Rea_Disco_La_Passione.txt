I stand alone  
Without a care  
Open the door  
But no-one's there  
The lonely night  
My only friend  
Love's wrongs are right  
I can't defend  
  
La Passione  
La Passione  
La Passione  
La Passione  
  
And now I know  
What I've become  
It haunts me so  
But I'll go on and on  
I know the pain inside  
Is the price you pay to ride  
Into the brightest flame  
Never the same again  
  
La Passione  
La Passione  
La Passione  
La Passione  
  
You dare to dream  
Take the chance and go  
Desire has taken hold  
Now the passion haunts you so  
  
La Passione  
La Passione  
La Passione  
La Passione
