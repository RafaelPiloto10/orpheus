Transliteration:  
  
Ze avar ze nigmar  
Ktze chalom vedai  
Chol hazman shenashar  
Bein etzbeotai  
  
Ze avar ze nigmar  
Letamid ulai  
Ma'agal shenisgar  
Venisharta chai  
  
Nipagesh nitrae  
Lev ohev eino to'e  
Kmo el yam nizrom nizrom  
Nevakesh ad shenagia  
Veniga el hachalom  
  
Translation:  
  
Now its gone  
Now its passed  
On the edge of a dream we linger..  
How  
The sands of time  
Have slipped between my fingers  
  
Now its gone  
Now its passed  
Forever, it appears..  
A circle  
That's been closed  
And I'm still alive, still here  
  
We shall meet  
And see each other  
For a loving heart can not go wrong  
Like rivers to the sea  
We flow, we stream  
Strive till we arrive  
To touch the dream.
