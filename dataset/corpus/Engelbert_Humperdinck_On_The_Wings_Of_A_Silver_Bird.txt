I know that I've stayed away for too long  
I've missed the sweet love you give me  
No other woman could warm me inside  
I need you much more  
Than I realized.  
On the wings of a silverbird  
I'm flying home to you  
On the wings of a silverbird  
I'll soon be holding you.  
So wipe all those tears away  
I'm coming home to stay  
Get ready my love  
Just look up above  
For the wings of a silverbird.  
You send me letters to help time go by  
I call your name while I'm dreaming.  
I need to feel you I long for your touch  
I wanna tell you  
I love you so much.  
On the wings ...  
I'll keep your picture  
To kiss and say good night  
But I wanna hold you forever.  
So wipe all those tears away  
I'm coming home to stay  
Get ready my love  
Just look up above  
For the wings of a silverbird.  
So wipe all those tears away  
I'm coming home to stay  
Get ready my love  
Just look up above  
For the wings of a silverbird.
