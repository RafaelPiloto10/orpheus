I don't know it is but (I love you I love you I love you)  
I don't know what you do but (I love you I love you)  
Oh baby,  
Baby I don't know what it is but you drive me  
Crazy and every time I'm around you girl it feels  
Amazing and I'm on my best behavior when I'm with  
My baby cause I cant lose my baby  
  
I don't met a lot girls in my life but they not like you no  
I don't been with the best and  
Baby you the best of the best you the greatest

I don't know what it is but (I love you I love you I love you)  
I don't know what you do but (I love you I love you I love you)  
I don't know what it is but (I love you I love you I love you)  
I don't know what you do but (I love you I love you I love you)  
  
Lately when you're gone all I do is think about my baby,  
I'm so gone off you're love and I don't know
