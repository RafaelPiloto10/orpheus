I used to think  
I had the answers to everything  
But now I know  
Life doesn't always  
Go my way, yeah...  
  
Feels like I'm caught in the middle  
That's when I realize...  
  
I'm not a girl  
Not yet a woman  
All I need is time  
A moment that is mine  
While I'm in between  
  
I'm not a girl  
There is no need to protect me  
It's time that I  
Learn to face up to this on my own  
I've seen so much more than you know now  
So tell me to shut my eyes  
  
I'm not a girl  
Not yet a woman  
All I need is time  
A moment that is mine  
While I'm in between  
  
I'm not a girl  
But if you look at me closely  
You will see it in my eyes  
This girl will always find  
Her way  
  
(I'm not a girl)  
I'm not a girl don't tell me what to believe  
(Not yet a woman)  
I'm just trying to find the woman in me, yeah  
(All I need is time)  
All I need  
(A moment that is mine)  
That is mine  
While I'm in between  
  
I'm not a girl  
Not yet yet a woman  
All I need is time  
(Is all I need)  
A moment that is mine  
While I'm in between  
  
I'm not a girl  
Not yet a woman
