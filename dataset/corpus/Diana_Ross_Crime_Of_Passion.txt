I must be crazy they don't know what we've done  
You are my lover  
Even though I know it's wrong  
I hear them talking  
But whatever they do  
I need to love you  
And if I love you couldn't we make it  
  
Got someone loving me  
He won't say goodbye  
He's been so good to me  
I don't want to make him cry  
I need you both to love me  
It's up to you  
You can help me  
You're the reason I can't decide  
  
Breakin' my bones and shakin' my nerves  
Till I just can't see tomorrow  
Looking at him and looking at you  
And I don't know who to follow  
I'll never win in the state I'm in  
  
It's a crime of passion, I'm bad to love you  
Whenever I'm with you, I lose control  
It's a crime of passion for me and for you  
Whatever I give you  
It's just too late to save my soul  
I need to love you  
My desperation is the power to go on  
Each night I prayed for love  
I'm at the mercy of  
And if you don't hear me now  
Then I'll be the only one  
Don't want to be, don't want to be the only one  
  
I saw him yesterday  
The questions he asked  
I think he knows about us  
Did we move too fast  
How can we hide it  
When we know it's a lie  
Keep our love under the covers  
The pressure is too high  
  
Why do I get myself tied up  
Why tangle with love you borrow  
I should have been known as a one man woman  
Should have been one love but oh no  
Never be a cure for the human law  
  
It's a crime of passion, I'm bad to love you  
Whenever I'm with you, I lose control  
It's a crime of passion for me and for you  
Whatever I give you  
It's just too late to save my soul  
I need to love you  
My desperation is the power to go on  
Each night I prayed for love  
I'm at the mercy of  
And if you don't hear me now  
Then I'll be the only one  
Don't want to be, don't want to be the only one
