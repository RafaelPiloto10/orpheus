Here's another Sunday morning call  
Yer hear yer head-a-banging on the door  
Slip your shoes on and then out you crawl  
Into a day that couldn't give you more  
But what for?  
  
And in your head do you feel  
What you're not supposed to feel  
You take what you want  
But you won't get it for free  
You need more time  
'cause your thoughts and words won't last forever more  
But I'm not sure if it ever works out right  
But it's ok. It's all right  
  
When yer lonely and you start to hear  
The little voices in your head at night  
You will only sniff away the tears  
So you can dance until the morning light  
At what price?
