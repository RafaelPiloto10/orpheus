I used to live my life in vain  
Until today it's been the same  
I've gone away to disappear  
My life with you was just too dear  
A better life is all I need  
To free me from this naughty league  
I've been and gone  
I won't be back  
I'll live my life without all that  
  
With my own eyes  
I realize  
It was time to say goodnight  
I was never really sure  
But now I know I'm right  
  
I used to live my life in vain  
Until today it's been the same  
I've gone away to re-appear  
My life with you was just too dear  
A better life is all I need  
To free me from this naughty league  
I've been and gone  
And I won't be back  
And I won't be back
