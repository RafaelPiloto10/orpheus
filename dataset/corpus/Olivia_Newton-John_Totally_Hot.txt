I want you  
But takin' it easy ain't an easy thing to do  
And I want you, want you  
You must know  
Cause baby I can't begin to keep it in  
Our love is so hot, totally hot  
You got to me  
Baby, baby, so hot, totally hot  
You got to me  
Gimme what you got, ready or not  
Our love is totally hot  
I'm burnin' up  
And if my mama could read my mind she'd lock me up  
And I'm burnin', burnin'  
You must know  
Cause baby when you're around I come unwound  
Our love is so hot, totally hot  
You got to me  
Baby, baby, so hot, totally hot  
You got to me  
Gimme what you got, ready or not  
Out love is totally hot  
Play the game and let me do the same  
And we gonna get along, gonna get along, gonna get along fine  
Watchin' out for my heart  
But when I am near you  
Near you ain't the place to start, no, no, no, no  
Takin' it slow  
Whenever I cross your trail, my brakes just fail  
My love is so hot, totally hot  
You got to me  
Baby, baby, so hot, totally hot  
You got to me  
Gimme what you got, ready or not  
My love is totally hot  
My love is so hot, totally hot  
You got to me  
Baby, baby, so hot, totally hot  
You got to me  
Gimme what you got, ready or not  
My love is totally hot  
Gimme what you got, ready or not  
My love is totally, totally, totally hot  
(repeats)
