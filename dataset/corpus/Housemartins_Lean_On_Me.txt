Heavy burden on your shoulder  
Lean on me  
Heavy burden on your shoulder  
Lean on me  
Heavy burden on your shoulder  
Everyday just a little bit harder  
Heavy burden on your shoulder  
Lean on me  
Down and out without hope  
Lean on me  
Down and out without hope  
Lean on me  
Down and out without hope  
I'm right here, I'll help you cope  
Down and out without hope  
Lean on me  
  
Grab a rope and pull me in  
But lean on me  
Everyday, you'll have a friend  
But lean on me  
  
Grab a rope, pull me in  
Everyday you'll have a friend  
Grab a rope  
  
In the world, ??  
And if you're looking for a rainy day friend  
Well grab a rope, pull me in  
Lean on me  
Heavy burden cloudy skies  
Lean on me  
I'll be the ?? of weeping eyes  
But lean on me  
  
If you always feels like rain  
All you've got in life is pain  
Heavy burden, go away  
Oh...goodbye  
Heavy burden, on you shoulder  
Lean on me
