I'm gonna lock my heart  
And throw away the key  
I'm wise to all those tricks  
You played on me  
  
I'm gonna turn my back on love  
Gonna snob the moon above  
Seal all my windows up with tin  
So the love bug can't get in  
  
Park my romance right along the curb  
Hang a sign upon my heart  
'Please Don't Disturb'  
  
And if I never fall in love again  
That's soon enough for me  
I'm gonna lock my heart  
And throw the key  
  
And it I never tall in love again  
That's soon enough for me  
I'm gonna lock my heart  
And throw away the key  
  
I'll never fall in love again  
I'm gonna lock my heart  
And throw away the key
