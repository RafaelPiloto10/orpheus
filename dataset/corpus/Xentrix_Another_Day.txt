Another day, you've no concerns but the desire burns  
Another day, for you to face your problem  
Is that the way that you want to be ?  
A constant liability  
Another day, why can't you see what you are gonna be  
Another day, will pass away unnoticed  
Your remedy for peace and quiet  
Constant intake liquid fire  
Good intentions permanent again  
Another crisis imminent again  
Your worst side dominant again  
Look at yourself again  
Look at yourself, what do you see ?  
Look at yourself, what do you see ?  
What do you see ?  
Everything revolves around the habit  
Like it or not it is the bottom line  
Hand to mouth a single reflex you are mine  
Detached from being forget your problems  
No misgivings are you happy now ?  
Good intentions permanent again  
Another crisis imminent again  
Your worst side dominant again  
Look at yourself again  
Look at yourself, what do you see ?  
Look at yourself, what do you see ?  
What do you see ?
