Falling out the window  
Tripping on a wrinkle in the rugfalling out of love, dear  
It hurt much worse when you gave up  
  
Just don't tell me which way I oughta run  
Or what good I could do anyone  
'Cause my heart it was a gun  
But it's unloaded now  
So don't bother  
  
Climbing up the ladder  
Breaking my shin on the very first rung  
Waking up the neighbors  
It's all right,they understand they're just as dumb  
  
And they don't tell me which way I oughta run  
Or what good I could do anyone  
'Cause my heart it was a gun  
But it's unloaded now  
So don't bother me now  
Don't bother  
  
Crawling back to you now  
I sold my guitar to the girl next door  
She asked me if I knew how  
I told her I don't think so anymore  
  
Don't tell me which way I oughta run  
What good could I do anyone  
'Cause my heart it was a gun  
But it's unloaded now  
So don't bother
