A bad situation right from the start  
She played me for a fool and she broke my heart  
An infatuation, a hard loss to take  
But we all must make our own mistakes  
  
Let her go  
I knew I had to let her go  
You know it wasn't easy  
It was painfully slow  
But I swear I finally let her go  
  
All of those feelings were so long ago  
I haven't felt a thing since I let her go  
But you don't believe it  
You still have your doubts  
And while you do the tension mounts  
  
Let her go  
You know you got to let her go  
You know it's never easy  
It's painfully slow  
But you know you got to let her go  
  
I will not deny it, I tried to hold on  
But human hearts can only stay broke so long  
I told you the truth, how much more can I do  
And now my love it's up to you  
  
Let her go  
You know you got to let her go  
You know it's never easy  
It's painfully slow  
But you're gonna have to let her go  
  
Let her go  
You know you got to let her go  
You know it's never easy  
It's got to be slow  
But you know you got to let her go
