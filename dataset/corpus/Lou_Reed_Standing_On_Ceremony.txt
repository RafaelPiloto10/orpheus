Remember your manners  
Will you please take your hat off  
Your mother is dying  
Listen to her cough  
We were always standing on ceremony  
We were always standing on ceremony  
Can't you show some respect please  
Although you didn't in real life  
Your mother is dying  
And I God damn well hope you're satisfied  
We were always standing on ceremony  
We were always standing on ceremony  
So please play another song on that juke box  
Please play another pretty sad song for me  
And if that phone rings, tell them that you haven't seen me  
If that last phone rings  
Tell them that you haven't seen me for weeks  
And this one here's on me  
Standing on ceremony, standing on ceremony  
Standing on ceremony, standing on ceremony  
Standing on ceremony, you were always standing on ceremony  
(standing, on ceremony)  
(standing, on ceremony)  
(standing, on ceremony)  
(standing, on ceremony)  
(standing, on ceremony)  
(standing, on ceremony)  
...
