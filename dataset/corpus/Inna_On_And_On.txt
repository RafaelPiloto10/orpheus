Hello (hello),  
Do you miss me?  
I don't know.  
My soul,  
Miss you baby,  
You don't know!  
Right now (right on),  
I am dreaming  
At no doubt.  
Real Love...  
Real Love...  
  
I need you on and on and on in my life...  
I need you on and on and on in my life...  
  
I need you on and on and on in my life...  
On and on and on in my life...  
  
You make me higher...  
Cause your my fire...  
You take me higher...  
Cause your my fire...  
  
I need you on and on and on in my life...  
I need you on and on and on in my life...  
  
I need you on and on and on in my life...  
On and on and on in my life...
