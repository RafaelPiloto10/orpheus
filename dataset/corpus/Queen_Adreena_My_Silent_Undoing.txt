My silent undoing  
My silent undoing  
My silent undoing  
My silent undoing  
My wasp in a jar  
Protruding hips  
And skull, and spine  
Ribcage cuts a clear outline  
Oh, oh  
All roped up and pinching in  
Distorted and disfiguring  
Oh, oh  
My silent undoing  
My silent undoing  
My wasp in a jar  
No photographs around the back  
Emaciated, iron flat  
Oh, oh  
Dehydrated cutting bones  
Today I'm over 7 stone  
Oh, oh  
My wasp in a jar  
My wasp in a jar  
My wasp in a jar  
Twinkle little star  
My wasp in a jar.
