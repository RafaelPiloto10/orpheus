Little Nemo rubbed his eyes and got out of bed,  
trying hard to piece together a broken dream.  
His visions lifelike and full of imagination  
it's strange to think they came from such a tiny head.  
  
Dragons breathing fire, but friendly.  
Mushrooms tall as houses.  
Giant Nymphs and goblins playing,  
scenes from a night's dream, poor Little Nemo!  
  
Eating all kinds of food so close to bedtime  
they always made him have these nightmares, it seemed.  
  
Helped young Washington in the garden,  
cut the cherry tree down.  
Now we all know that's not history,  
scenes from a night's dream, poor Little Nemo!  
  
"Nemo, get out of bed!"  
"Don't tell me stories, I don't want to know!"  
"Come on you sleepy head, we're waiting to go!"  
  
Once he went to the 'Carnival of Nations'  
dancing with the princess through the night.  
  
Found themselves on a moving platform  
ten ton weights above them,  
seeking audience with King Morpheus.  
Scenes from a night's dream, poor little Nemo!  
  
"Nemo, get out of bed!"  
"Don't tell me stories, I don't want to know!"  
"Come on you sleepy head, we're waiting to go!"
