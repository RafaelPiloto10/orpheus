Chain smoking cigarettes  
Enemies across the table  
Wonderin' if I can ever trust anyone again  
We argue through the night  
the restaurant shuts, you catch your flight  
I hail a cab with no idea where home might be  
  
We both believed my chance was gone  
But ain't it strange how life goes on  
A storm can never rage forever  
And darkness only lasts 'til dawn  
  
Hotel blinds stay down  
Nothing seems to make me care  
I can't find a reason to comb my hair  
Folks walkin' in the street  
Everyone has something to do  
My brain won't stop showin' those old movies of you  
  
Weeks pass,  
And your voice sounds strange on the telephone  
Strange how smooth and casual my own voice sounds  
I find that I'm listening to  
A tune coming over my radio  
It makes me think of a guy I knew a while ago  
A while ago a while ago
