Frum kidnaps an' jacks  
Knockouts an' craps  
Frum totin Tech-9's

Timez iz hard we all caught up in da struggle

Yung kids we got a man made disease

Tryin 2 get mine husslin like Larry Flynt  
No food in da fridge but we wuzn't alarmed  
Cuz my brutha wuz like a good neighba den like state farm  
Peeples always sayin wut they need an' want  
But they need 2 start wit they du's an' don'ts  
Just be thankful 4 day 2 day  
An' evrythang will be goin ya way  
  
Now ain't it odd 2 thank god  
We moovin in gangsta toyed  
We live an' die by tha sword  
An' still we thank tha lord  
Frum da maternity ward 2 tha morgue  
I count my blessins  
It's a game I shood but can't afford but i aint stressin  
I'm E-S-in 4 mines it's all gunna pay off in da long run  
An' no rest on da grind man a nigga just out here on one  
Stayin strong all alone or hangin wit my clique  
I rite a song rite or rong I'm realy bangin dis shit  
I used ta wonda y we had it so ruff  
My motto wuz my ancha an' 4 dat I can't thak ya enuff
