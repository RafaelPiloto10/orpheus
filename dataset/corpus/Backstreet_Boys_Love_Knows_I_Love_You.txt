Love Knows I Love You  
  
You make me say it 25 times a day  
You make me feel you don't believe the words I say  
What is a man to do to prove his love for you?  
You make me feel like I'm just givin' free love away  
  
I can send flowers tomorrow  
But it doesn't mean a thing  
If your heart rejects the message from mine  
It's a waste of time  
  
Baby love knows I love you  
Baby love knows the truth  
Baby love knows the feeling that is in here  
Resting in my heart  
From the very start  
I loved you  
Resting in my heart  
From the very start  
I loved you  
  
Yeah, I look at you and know I never loved anyone more  
You make me feel like a child in a candy store  
What can I do to prove  
That you're a dream come true  
And in this dream there's a pulse from my heart to you  
I can send daisies daily  
But it never will penetrate  
If your heart if rejects the best from mine  
It's a waste of time  
  
Baby love knows I love you (I really do)  
Baby love knows the truth  
Baby love knows the feeling that is in here  
Resting in my heart  
From the very start  
I loved you (I really do, babe)  
Resting in my heart  
From the very start  
I loved you  
  
Baby I'm lookin for cupid  
Can I tie him in a ball and chain  
To see if he can say to you  
The words that make you feel my love is real, oh  
  
Baby love knows I love you  
(That's right you know I love you, baby girl)  
Baby love knows the truth  
(Hey gotta know the truth, you know I love you)  
Baby love knows the feeling that is in here  
Resting in my heart  
(In my heart)  
From the very start  
I loved you  
(Yeah, that's right)  
Resting in my heart  
From the very start  
I loved you, yeah
