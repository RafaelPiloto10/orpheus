Licensed to kill  
On my 650 Bonneville  
"Hellfire" we yell  
Fueled and indestructible  
  
Get it down  
To take the crown  
Neon daze  
Renegades  
  
No fear just hate  
Drives us to the ultimate  
Cut loose extremes  
On our maniac machines  
  
Take me down  
Or hit the ground  
Neon nights  
At the speed of light  
  
So you motherfuckers want to race  
You've all got loser tattooed on your face  
  
Machine Man's running - you wanna try  
Machine Man's coming - you're gonna die  
  
Ignite the engines  
You can hear it scream  
You're gonna eat your words  
That challenged this machine  
  
The beast is revved up  
The flag is down  
The tires screech  
And lay a smoke screen all around  
  
Through the limits  
As they rocket past  
It's a blood bath  
There's no second place  
  
Machine Man's running - you wanna try  
Machine Man's coming - you're gonna die  
  
Machine Man - Machine Man's coming  
Machine Man - Machine Man's coming  
  
Ice nerves of steel  
As I notch another kill  
You lose - I win  
I get to ride again  
  
Get it down  
Hit the ground  
Neon nights  
Speed of light  
  
Feel no mercy as I cross the line  
Watch the suckers self-destruct behind  
  
Machine Man's running  
You wanna try  
Machine Man's coming  
You're gonna die  
  
Machine Man's running - you wanna try  
Machine Man's coming - you're gonna die  
  
Machine Man - Machine Man's coming  
Machine Man - Machine Man's coming
