Am I asleep?  
Or have I died  
(wanting peace)  
We fall in space  
(wanting peace)  
We can't look down,  
Death may come,  
(something takes a hold of me)  
Peace I have found  
(something takes a hold of me)  
I want to say my whole life,  
Am I asleep?  
We fall down.  
We come to this place  
Falling through time,  
Living a hollow life,  
Always we're taking  
Waiting for signs,  
Hollow lives  
Is there ever any wonder why we look to the sky?  
Search in vane?  
Asking why?  
All alone?  
Where is god?  
Looking down?  
We don't know? [Repeat x2]  
We fall in space  
We can't look down  
Death may come.  
Peace I have found
