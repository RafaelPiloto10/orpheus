I love the look of you, the lure of you  
The sweet of you, the pure of you  
The eyes, the arms, the mouth of you  
The east, west, north and the south of you  
  
I'd love to gain complete control of you  
And handle even the heart and soul of you  
So love, at least, a small percent of me, do  
For I love all of you  
  
I'd love to gain complete control of you  
And handle even the heart and soul of you  
So love, at least, a small percent of me, do  
For I love all of you, for I love all of you
