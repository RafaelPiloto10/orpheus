Shocka called me up to do this thing for Soundbombing  
And I figured that I'd do it cause it wasn't no harmin'  
Shine a little bit in case somebody was forgettin'  
About that Queens motherfucker, y'all need to take cover  
I'ma take position and y'all best to take sha-hida  
'Cause the shit that I spit is hot as hellfire, hotter  
Sendin' this to Cross, Meniski, and Bay Vigi  
Doug, Pretty Tone and the one that shoot the vidi  
Y'all stay in my heart, while I dabble with the charts  
Fuck the fame and my aim find the clarity in art  
This cowards got it once cause he kept his lips zippin'  
Now he in the news and he wettin' and I'm livin'  
This Southern cowards life who I used to do my clues with  
Subliminally this is me, I try not to assume shit  
Let's not forget the king of Internet  
Will assume another name while he tarnishes ya rep  
And calls you Ziggy Starters but who the major charm  
Who starts to elevate out the reach of his arm  
  
It's a great day fuck it  
Ya probably hear the bundles overflowin' out of Ruckers  
The name is Abstract don't confuse without description  
'Cause you lil' gremlins envy so just cut the fuckin' weak shit  
Ride off in the night, V8 lost power  
From a soundbomb killin' the lone ranger drillin'  
You eager with ya mouth then just be a big proactive  
Ya actin' with ya heart then start preachin' with ya fatness  
The clear voyage psychic MC is a minion  
You cornered and you bagged in so where you gon' run to  
Used to get my mother's switches now I grant her wishes  
Never superstitious breakin' mirrors with the pitches  
Ya man is insane with that do-do on his chain  
Funkin' up the joint he pain, that ain't a bling that's a blang  
Besides can he rap about a real life vision  
Success lies a struggle that's what most of y'all are missin'  
Got so many sons I wish I had as many ones  
Clown nigga's raps get converted into guns  
Illuminati president it's a government official  
They dogs and they henchmen is comin' out to get you  
The age of Aquarius, the change is goin' on  
We gotta keep strivin' movin' on  
  
Ya dead wrong, ya wrong, ya know ya wrong  
(Ya know ya wrong for that)  
(Now why ya gotta go and do that)  
Ya dead wrong, ya wrong, ya know ya wrong  
And you know, you know you are ooh  
And you know, you know you are
