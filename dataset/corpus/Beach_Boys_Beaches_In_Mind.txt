We've got beaches in mind  
Man it's been too much time  
  
Woke me up before dawn  
Wish I could sleep some more so I could carry on  
With the dream I've been meaning to make come true  
And that's to get away with you  
  
I think we all can agree  
That there's no better place for us to be  
We can drive on for miles till we're finally free  
It'll just be you and me  
  
We've got beaches in mind  
Man it's been too much time  
Not a care in the world is where I want to be  
  
South Bay surfing again  
Haven't been this way in I don't know when  
If I have my say we'll be back again  
Where the good times never end  
  
We've got beaches in mind  
Man it's been too much time  
Not a care in the world is where I wanna be  
With the surfers, sand, and the sea  
  
We'll find a place in the sun  
Where everyone can have fun  
  
Beaches in mind  
Man it's been too much time  
Not a care in the world is where I want to be  
With the surfers, sand, and the sea  
  
We've got beaches in mind  
Man it's been too much time  
Not a care in the world is where I want to be  
Beaches in mind
