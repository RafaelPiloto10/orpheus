I don't know where you're going,  
But do you got room for one more troubled soul  
I don't know where I'm going,  
But I don't think I'm coming home  
And I said, I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead  
This is the road to ruin and we're starting at the end  
  
Say, yeah  
Let's be alone together  
We could stay young forever  
Scream it from the top of your lungs, lungs, lungs  
  
Say, yeah  
Let's be alone together  
We can stay young forever  
We'll stay young, young, young, young, young  
  
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh  
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh  
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh  
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh  
  
Cut me off, I lost my track  
It's not my fault, I'm a maniac  
It's not funny anymore, no it's not  
  
My heart is like a stallion, they love it more when it's broken  
Do you wanna feel beautiful, do you wanna, yeah  
  
I'm outside the door, let me in  
So we can go back and play pretend  
I'm on deck, yeah I'm up next  
Tonight I'm high as a private jet  
  
'Cause I don't know where you're going,  
But do you got room for one more troubled soul  
I don't know where I'm going, but I don't think I'm coming home  
And I said, I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead  
This is the road to ruin and we're starting at the end  
  
Say, yeah  
Let's be alone together  
We could stay young forever  
Scream it from the top of your lungs, lungs, lungs  
  
Say, yeah  
Let's be alone together  
We can stay young forever  
We'll stay young, young, young, young, young  
  
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh  
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh  
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh  
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh  
  
My heart is like a stallion, they love it more when it's broken  
Do you wanna feel beautiful, do you wanna, yeah  
  
I'm outside the door, invite me in  
So we can go back and play pretend  
I'm on deck, yeah I'm up next  
Tonight I'm high as a private jet  
  
Yeah  
Let's be alone together  
We could stay young forever  
Scream it from the top of your lungs, lungs, lungs  
  
Say, yeah  
Let's be alone together  
We can stay young forever  
We'll stay young, young, young, young, young  
  
I don't know where you're going,  
But do you got room for one more troubled soul  
I don't know where I'm going, but I don't think I'm coming home  
And I said, I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead  
This is the road to ruin and we're starting at the end
