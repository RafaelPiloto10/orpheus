When the world and I were young,  
Just yesterday.  
Life was such a simple game,  
A child could play.  
It was easy then to tell right from wrong.  
Easy then to tell weak from strong.  
When a man should stand and fight,  
Or just go along.  
  
But today there is no day or night  
Today there is no dark or light.  
Today there is no black or white,  
Only shades of gray.  
  
I remember when the answers seemed so clear  
We had never lived with doubt or tasted fear.  
It was easy then to tell truth from lies  
Selling out from compromise  
Who to love and who to hate,  
The foolish from the wise.  
  
But today there is no day or night  
Today there is no dark or light.  
Today there is no black or white,  
Only shades of gray.  
  
It was easy then to know what was fair  
When to keep and when to share.  
How much to protect your heart  
And how much to care.  
  
But today there is no day or night  
Today there is no dark or light.  
Today there is no black or white,  
Only shades of gray.  
Only shades of gray.
