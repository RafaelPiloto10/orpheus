Unreleased rarity played live  
  
Does it have to get me in the morning (in the morning)  
  
Don't believe there's a face that you can't see  
  
Does it stay all alone (alone)  
  
Don't believe, that it's not you, it's not me, it's not hope, not free  
  
It's an ordinary day  
  
Got it, you got it, you got it [?]  
  
Ordinary day  
  
Got it, you got it, you got it [?]  
  
Ordinary, ordinary  
  
(From here on the song is hard to hear but most of it sounds like Raine's just
repeating the beginning.)  
  
High, high [?]  
  
Does it have to get me in the morning (in the morning)  
  
Don't believe you to say that you can't see  
  
Does it wait all alone (alone)  
  
Don't believe, that not you, not me, not hope, not faith  
  
It's an ordinary day  
  
Got it, you got it, you got it [?]  
  
Ordinary day  
  
Got it, you got it, you got it [?]  
  
Ordinary, ordinary  
  
High, high [?]  
  
But we don't want to lose  
  
But it all [?]  
  
(The rest just sounds like Raine is singing la or lu.)
