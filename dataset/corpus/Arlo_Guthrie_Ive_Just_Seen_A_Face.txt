I've just seen a face,  
I can't forget the time or place  
That we'd just met, she's just the girl for me  
And I want all the world to see we've met  
Na na na na na na  
  
Had it been another day  
I might have looked the other way  
But I had never been aware  
And as it is I dream of her tonight  
Na na na na na na  
  
[CHORUS:]  
Falling, yes I am falling  
And she keeps calling me back again  
  
I have never known  
The likes of this, I've been alone  
And I have missed things and kept out of sight  
But other girls were never quite like this  
Na na na na na na  
  
[CHORUS]  
I've just seen a face  
I can t forget the time or place  
And we'd just met, she's just the girl for me  
And I want all the world to see we've met  
Na na na na na na  
  
[CHORUS]
