I'm a disco dancer  
But I've got no place to go  
(I'm a disco boy I'm a disco boy)  
I'm a disco dancer baby  
But my feet won't touch the floor  
(I'm a disco boy I'm a disco boy)  
Oh no  
  
I've been sleeping twenty years or more  
I remember a long time ago  
(I'm a disco boy I'm a disco boy)  
Nya nya nya nya  
  
Now I'm back to change your mind  
Now I'm moving right in time  
In a world that's turned unkind  
I see what's going on behind my back  
I'm a disco dancer  
  
I keep dancin' on and on  
(I'm a disco boy I'm a disco boy)  
Oh no  
I'm a disco dancer baby  
But I think that something's wrong
