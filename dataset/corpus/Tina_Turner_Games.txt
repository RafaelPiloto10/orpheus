I know you're a gangster, but I'm the queen of space  
A ruler of hearts I shoot the moon  
I take my tricks right from the start  
  
I'm a sucker for love, the joker's running wild  
My heart it can break, oh it can break  
Frail as a child  
  
Whatever it is it is, Whatever will be it's gonna be  
Whoever you are you are  
Those games that you play, don't you play 'em with me  
  
You're a visionary dreamer  
A fool leaving things to chance, risk is a hazard  
Oh such a hazard if you flirt with romance  
  
It's like a shooting the dice  
Flipping coins in the air  
You're running on luck the odds are against you  
If you're not playing fair  
  
Whatever it is it is, Whatever will be it's gonna be  
Whoever you are you are  
Those games that play, don't you play em' with me  
  
Stacking the deck, dealing those cards  
Watch what you take and stand it on guard  
  
Whatever it is it is, Whatever will be it's gonna be  
Whoever you are you are
