1 and 2 and 3 and 4  
This my rap song  
  
1-2-3-4  
I get really sick and tired of boys up in my face  
  
Pick up lines like "What's your sign" won't get  
You anyplace  
When me and all my girls go walking down the  
Street  
It seems we can't go anywhere without a car that  
Goes "Beep-beep"  
  
Cuz this body is a priceless piece of lovin'  
Unconditionally  
So, Mr. Big-stuff, who you think you are?  
You was thinkin' you's gonna get it for free  
Now, now, now,  
  
Hey ladies  
(Yeah!)  
Let 'em know it ain't easy  
Are-E-S-P-E-C-T  
Let's come togeta'  
Sista's  
(Yeah!)  
Its time to be greedy  
Nothin' good comes for free  
1-2-3-4  
Mirror, mirror on the wall, damn I sure look fine  
I can't blame those horny boys, I would make me  
Mine  
When I pass you in a club, "Ooh, lala!" you gasp  
Back up boy, I ain't your toy, or your piece of  
Ass  
  
Cuz this body is a priceless piece of lovin'  
Unconditionally  
So, Mr. Big-stuff, who you think you are?  
You was thinkin' you's gonna get it for free  
Now, now, now  
  
Hey ladies  
(Yeah!)  
Let 'em know it ain't easy  
Are-E-S-P-E-C-T  
Let's come togeta'  
Sista's  
(Yeah!)  
Its time to be greedy  
Nothin' good comes for free  
  
Hey ladies  
(Yeah!)  
Let 'em know it ain't easy  
Are-E-S-P-E-C-T  
Let's come togeta'  
Sista's  
(Yeah!)  
Its time to be greedy  
Nothin' good comes for free  
  
No jealousy, no envy girls, c'mon, let's work it  
Out  
No freebies in the limousine, that's not what its  
About  
Let 'em know there's work to do, give it up he  
Won't call you  
Respect is just a minimum, go on girl and get you  
Some  
  
1-2-3-4

Nothin' good comes for free  
  
Let's come together  
C'mon girls let's work it out  
Let's come together  
We'll show them what we're talkin' bout  
Let's come together  
C'mon girls let's work it out  
Let's come together

Let's come together  
Nothin' good comes for free
