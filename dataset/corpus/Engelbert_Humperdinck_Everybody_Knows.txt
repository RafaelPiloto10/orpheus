Wish they hadn't seen him walk away,  
And heard me beg him stay, please stay.  
Why, why did we choose this crowded place,  
They all know it, cause I show it in my face.  
Everybody knows you said goodbye,  
Everybody knows we're through.  
Now they all can see the tears I cry,  
Running down my face for you.  
They all said it's too good to be true,  
He'll make a fool of you, one day.  
I just laughed and said our love was strong,  
But you left me, and they all know I was wrong.  
Everybody knows you're tired of me,  
Everybody knows we're through.  
Though I'm on my own I can't be free,  
Baby, I just live for you.  
Everybody knows you said goodbye,  
Everybody knows we're through...
