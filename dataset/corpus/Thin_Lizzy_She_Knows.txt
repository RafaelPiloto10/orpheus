Who's got the funk  
When you're feeling low down  
Who's going to love you  
When there's no one else around  
  
Who's going to help you  
Especially when you're sick  
Loving Mary  
I need you quick  
  
She knows and she gives her everything  
She knows and she can do her thing  
She knows and she tries her best  
She knows, oh, you know she knows  
  
Who's got the junk  
When you're feeling low down  
Who's going to give  
When there's none to go around  
  
Who's going to help you  
When you feel you've had enough  
Mother Mary  
This child, this rose  
  
But loving Mary  
Do you feel the pain?  
I'm falling down  
And I can't get up again  
  
Do ya, do ya, do ya  
Do ya, do ya, do ya  
Just a striped guitar reaction  
  
Who's going to help you  
Especially when you're ill  
Loving Mary  
I hope you will  
  
But loving Mary  
Do you feel the pain?  
I'm falling down  
And I can't get up again  
  
Do ya, do ya, do ya  
Do ya, do ya, do ya  
  
Mother Mary, is there nothing you can do?
