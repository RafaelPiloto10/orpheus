Do do do do do do do do do  
This is a Christmas remix  
  
And it's sang  
La la la la la la la la la la  
Baby  
  
Did you get my card  
Did you read my love letter  
Did it touch your heart  
When you read my love letter  
  
Pour the wine, read the signs  
Baby, it's Christmas time  
You and me underneath this tree  
Candle stories told  
Kisses under mistletoe  
And everyone's asking their family  
  
[Chorus]  
Did you get my card  
(Christmas card)  
Did you read my love letter  
(Did you read my love letter)  
Did it touch your heart  
(Did it touch your heart, girl)  
When you read my love letter  
(My Christmas love letter)  
  
Sleigh bells, sweet dreams  
Kids are sleep, you and me  
Wrap the gifts I can't wait til morning  
'Cause, this moment's so heaven sent  
Marshmallows, hot chocolate  
Fireplace, you and me cuddling  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(My hope is)  
I hope these words find you  
I wrote this letter according to my love for you  
So I hope these presents will travel safely to where you are  
You find my heart with a ribbon wrapped on it in a box  
Though near or far, I will find a way to send my love  
Only pray that it don't come back turned into cinder  
If you are reading this I hope that things are well  
And you can text me back, or write me back just check your mail  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Do do do do do do do do do  
Yeah yeah  
La la la la la la  
Sound real good  
It's Christmas time in the hood  
And everybody's childish  
They be out of this world  
They stepping on Mars  
So, mood and ropes up on me  
Say hey what's accurate  
Cause Kelly's at Christmas party and  
Everybody's V.I.P. then,  
I know we all have our problems  
And tryin' to make it better  
So I had to put on my music cake  
And write this Love Letter!  
Come on baby  
Dance, step, move whatever (Repeats)  
Merry Christmas y'all!
