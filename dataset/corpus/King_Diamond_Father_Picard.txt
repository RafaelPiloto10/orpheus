A new chaplain has arrived  
Madeleine and a few other nuns  
At the convent will meet him tonight  
Father picard:  
"welcome to my quarters, do come inside  
Welcome dearest sisters, come into the light"  
"I'm father picard, I'm taking over  
Things will be different here  
You are the four God has chosen  
To be his angels in white  
Drink my sweet holy wine"  
"oh yeah come on it's not a crime  
From now on every Sunday this time  
You will attend this communion of mine"  
Father picard is hiding something  
A white powder for the wine  
Father picard:

The nuns freak out, lust in their eyes  
From now on every Sunday this time  
Father picard's in control of their minds  
Father picard is hiding something  
A white powder for the wine
