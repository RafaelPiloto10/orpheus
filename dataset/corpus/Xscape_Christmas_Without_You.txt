[Verse One (Tamika):]  
The snow is falling like I knew it would,  
Carolers are already singing.  
Last year is all that I can think about,  
Everytime I hear sleigh bells ringing.  
[Bridge (Tamika):]  
But I know,  
That when summer came I pushed you away,  
I should have never let you go, no  
Now all I'm really trying to say is...  
[Chorus:]  
I want you to come home,  
I know that there won't be a christmas without you,  
I miss you so much.  
You're all that I want,  
I know that there won't be a christmas without you,  
I miss you, come home.  
[Verse Two (Kandi):]  
I remember all the love we made,  
I miss your stocking on the fireplace.  
Underneath the mistletoe we stayed,  
Twas a very special holiday.  
[Repeat Bridge (Tiny)]  
[Repeat Chorus]  
[Verse Three (LaTocha):]  
There's a fire that's still burning in my heart tonight,  
There's no reason why we both should be alone.  
It's the night before Christmas,  
And I'm waiting here for you to come home, come home.  
[Repeat Chorus to fade]
