I stepped into an avalanche  
It covered up my soul  
When I am not this hunchback that you see  
I sleep beneath the golden hill  
You who wish to conquer pain  
You must learn to serve me well  
  
You strike my side by accident  
As you go down to your goal  
This cripple here that you clothe and feed  
Is neither starved nor cold  
He does not ask for your company  
Not at the centre, the centre of the world  
  
I who am on a pedestal  
You did not raise me there  
Your laws do not compel me now  
To kneel grotesque and bare  
For I myself am the pedestal  
For this ugly hump at which you stare  
  
You who wish to conquer pain  
You must learn what makes me kind  
The crumbs of love that you offer me  
Are the crumbs I've left behind  
Your pain is no credential here  
It's just a shadow of my wound  
  
I have begun to ask for you  
I who have no greed  
I have begun to long for you  
I who have no need  
You say you've gone away from me  
But I can feel you when you breathe  
  
Do not dress in those rags for me  
I know you are not poor  
And do not love me quite so fiercely now  
When you know that you are not sure  
It is your turn, my beloved one  
It is your flesh that I wear
