Hey girls, gather round  
Listen to what I'm putting down  
Whooo babe, I'm your handy man.  
  
I'm not the kind to use a pencil or rule  
When it comes to lovin' I'm no fool  
I fix broken hearts,  
I know I surely can.  
  
If your broken heart should need repair  
Then I'm the man to see  
I whisper sweet words, you tell all your friends  
They'll come runnin' to me.  
  
Here is the main thing I want to say  
I'm busy 24 hours a day  
I fix broken hearts,  
I know that I surely can.  
  
If your broken heart needs repair  
I'm the man to see

Here is the main thing I want to say  
I'm busy 24 hours a day  
I fix broken hearts,  
I know I surely can.  
  
Come, come, come  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Come, come, come  
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
