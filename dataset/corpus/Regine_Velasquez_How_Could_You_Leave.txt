All day I sit till dawn just thinkin' about your smile I see you in my dreams
how you complete me the flowers you left me here still wilt on the shelf by
the phone you took a part of me all the tears I've cried for you I'ts day by
day for me the only way I get by I keep talking in my sleep as if you will
stay right by my side baby...  
  
Chorus:  
How could you leave, and leave here with me all of the precious memories, just
left me behind and how my heart cries without you I'm so lost baby I still
can't believe that you could just leave standing alone the misery just left me
behind to find this... Come back baby  
  
I pray I call your name still wishing that you would come home...  
Nothing comforts me... But if you could hold me...  
My world would start to turn for a moment that things would be right  
Can you hear me?  
Baby don't you need me too?  
Are you afraid of me? Please tell me how love passed us by...  
Right now I'll do anything just to have you right back in my life...  
Baby...  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
All of the pain and the hurt trapped inside, keeps pulling me down and God
knows how I try...  
So hard when you love someone, the way that I love you...  
Please come back...  
We can talk it out loud the time and space my love away from you...  
  
It's day by day for me the only way I get by...  
I keep talking in my sleep as if you were still right by my side...  
Baby...
