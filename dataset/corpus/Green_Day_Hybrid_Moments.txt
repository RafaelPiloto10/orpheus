1, 2  
1, 2, 3, 4!  
  
If you're gonna scream, scream with me  
Moments like this never last  
When do creatures rape your face?  
Hybrids opened up the door  
  
Ooh baby when you cry  
Your face is momentary  
You hide your looks behind these scars  
In hybrid moments  
Give me a moment  
  
Give me a moment  
Give me a moment  
  
Ooh baby when you cry  
Your face is momentary  
You hide your looks behind these scars  
  
In hybrid moments  
Give me your moment  
  
Give me a moment  
Give me a moment  
  
Give me a moment  
Give me a moment  
  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday to you  
  
30 years of Metallica
