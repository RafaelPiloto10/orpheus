Wrote a letter to the M.T.V.  
What's goin' on now  
Don't ya care about me  
Sent the same letter to the radio,  
But my party went dead  
Like a shot in the head  
We all like it-Rock and Roll  
We all want it-On your show  
Play it loud,don't play it low  
Blow your speakers with Rock and Roll  
  
We got lots of stations  
Around the nation  
And the stuff they're playing  
It just ain't worth my sayin'  
People want music to get'em movin'  
We don't want labels  
We want music on the table  
  
We all like it-Rock and Roll  
We all want it-on your show  
Play it loud,don't play it low  
Blow your speakers with Rock and Roll  
  
We all like it-Rock and Roll  
We all want it-on your show  
Play it loud,don't play it low  
Blow your speakers with Rock and Roll  
  
We got lots of stations  
Around the nation  
And the stuff they're playing  
It just ain't worth my sayin'  
  
We all like it-Rock and Roll  
We all want it-on your show  
Play it loud,don't play it low  
Blow your speakers with Rock and Roll
