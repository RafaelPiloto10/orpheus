Here's a glue guy, performance god  
A makeshift shrine, a newly lain sod  
Hardly even tryin', gives the nod  
I sure hope I'm not the type to dwell  
Hope I'm a fast healer, fast as hell  
Heaven is a better place today because of this  
But the world is just not the same  
If and when you get into the end zone  
Act like you've been there a thousand times before  
Don't blame, don't say people lose people all the time anymore  
A toonie to the busker and a husky 'keep it comin'' under my breath  
But then said, ?Though, if you wouldn't mind  
Less cryin' and more tryin', more tryin' and less cryin'?  
I'm not the type to dwell  
I'm a fast healer, fast as hell  
Heaven is a better place today because of this  
But the world is just not the same  
Oh, if and, if and when you get into the end zone  
Act like you've been there a thousand times before  
Don't blame, don't say people lose people all the time anymore  
Don't say people lose people all the time anymore  
If and when you get into that end zone  
Act like you've been there a thousand times before  
Don't change but don't say people lose people all the time anymore  
Ooh, it's just not the same because of this  
Ooh, it's not the same
