Nowhere to hide, you can't escape the fun  
No matter where you run  
All that is gone with the times  
And time will tell on you if you don't carry through  
You've got your soul on the line  
  
Long as you know which side the sun rises on everyone  
Wherever you go you'll understand  
Holding the light in the center of your hand, There's a  
  
[Chorus]  
Whole world to save  
There's a whole world to save  
You can start any place, there's a  
Whole world to save, Whole world  
Not any reason to wait  
  
You're alone, you and everything with a face  
Why'd they call it human race?  
All in a world of our own  
I think it's gone far enough, I say we call their bluff  
Somebody's got to be strong  
If you get one wild night in life, oh, you'd better get it right  
If it's the only life you get  
What is it worth if it's you and nothing left, there's a  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Making a difference, seeing what nobody sees  
I won't wait for a deliverance 'cause I know it's waiting for me  
  
Long as you know which side the sun rises on everyone  
Wherever you go, you'll understand  
Holding the light in the center of your hand, there's a  
  
[Chorus]
