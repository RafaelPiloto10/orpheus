Couldn't see my funny side  
As far as I recall and it didn't mean much to me  
Carried on messing round and getting lower every day  
And then a little while later  
Looking for a way to get ahead of all the ups and downs  
On the road, back at home, it didn't matter much to me  
Running round every corner, walk around every street  
Running round like a madman, run yourself off your feet  
Walk about like a zombie, run about like a freak  
Running round like a maniac, flipping out every week  
Well, I just gotta get away as far as I can go  
And as long as I don't see you there  
Turn around, look again, what is it happening to me?  
Well am I getting paranoid  
Or maybe superstition is making me feel this way  
Checking in, checking out, I seem to do it every day  
Running round every corner, walk around every street  
Running round like a madman, run yourself off your feet  
Walk about like a zombie, run about like a freak  
Running round like a maniac, flipping out every week  
Now I've been working on the road as long as I recall  
And it's feeling like yesterday  
Giggling, traveling and getting better every day  
But I was getting paranoid  
Or maybe superstition is making me feel this way  
Checking in, checking out, I seem to do it every day  
Running round every corner, walk around every street  
Running round like a madman, run yourself off your feet  
Walk about like a zombie, run about like a freak  
Running round like a maniac, flipping out every week  
Running round every corner, walk around every street  
Running round like a madman, run yourself off your feet  
Walk about like a zombie, run about like a freak  
Running round like a maniac, flipping out every week
