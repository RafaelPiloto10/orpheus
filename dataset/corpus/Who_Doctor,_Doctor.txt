Doctor, there's something wrong with me  
My health is not all that it used to be  
My heart is out of beat, I got chokers on my feet  
My eyesight's getting dimmer, I can't see  
  
Doctor thanks for seeing me today, I'm glad,  
I've got every sickness there is to be had  
I had whooping cough last month  
And today I've got the mumps  
And tomorrow I'll catch chicken pox as well.  
  
[Chorus]  
Doctor doctor doctor make me well  
I've not got long to go now I can tell  
Doctor doctor doctor make me well  
I've not got long to go I can tell  
I've not got long to go I can tell  
  
Those pills I took have no effect at all  
Just the other day I had a nasty fall  
And I think I broke my jaw when it hit the kitchen floor  
And I'm shrinking last week I was five foot four  
  
I've been getting shivers lately, is it flu?  
I know the bug is going round, what can I do?  
It's about to pick on me, I've still got the other three  
Do you think I caught smallpox I'd get flu?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Do you think it's time that I made out my will?  
I'll leave everything to you to pay my bill  
Just how long is there to go  
Please tell me I want to know  
But on second thoughts don't tell me, I'm too ill.
