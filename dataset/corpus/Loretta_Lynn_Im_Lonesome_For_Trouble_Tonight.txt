He's nothin' but trouble but he's always on my mind  
I tried all I know to do to leave trouble behind  
I can hardly live without him I even miss the fights  
I'm lonesome for trouble tonight  
I'm lonesome for trouble tonight  
And I ache for troubles arms to hold me tight  
Everytime we get together seems like nothin' comes out right  
Lord I'm lonesome for trouble tonight  
[ steel ]  
Unhappy when I'm with him I'm unhappy when I'm not  
I've tried so hard to get along but trouble's all I've got  
It's hard to have somebody on your mind but out of sight  
Yes I'm lonesome for trouble tonight  
I'm lonesome for trouble tonight...
