(Way down home way down home)  
I got to pack and go going back where I come from  
And the folks I really know  
Down home (Way down home) Way down home (Way down home)  
I got to say goodbye  
How I miss the taste of Grandma's potato pie  
And the pretty girls come in bunches  
And they never treat you wrong  
Down home (Way down home) Way down home (Way down home)  
Watermelon (Watermelon) costs but a dime (Watermelon)  
And the fish by the river  
They jump they jump on your line  
I got to go you see  
City life can never take the country out of me  
So I'm going back where I come from  
And I never gonna roam  
From home (Way down home) Way down home (Way down home)  
(Watermelon costs but a dime)  
And the fish down by the river  
Jump on your line  
I got to go you see  
Anyone who asks for me  
Tell them I have gone back home  
Gonna fall back with that living  
And I'm never gonna roam  
From home (Way down home) Way down home (Way down home)  
Down home (Way down home) Way down home (Way down home)  
Down home (Way down home) Way down home (Way down home)
