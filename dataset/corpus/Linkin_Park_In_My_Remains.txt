Separate, sifting through the wreckage  
I can't concentrate, searching for a message  
In the fear and pain, broken down and waiting  
For the chance to feel alive  
  
Now in my remains  
Our promises that never came  
Except this silent rain  
To wash away the worst of me  
  
Come apart, falling in the cracks  
Of every broken heart, digging through the wreckage  
Of your disregard, sinking down and waiting  
For the chance, to feel alive  
  
Now in my remains  
Our promises that never came  
Except this silent rain  
To wash away the worst of me  
  
Like an army, falling  
One by one by one  
Like an army, falling  
One by one by one  
Like an army, falling  
One by one by one  
Like an army, falling  
One by one by one  
  
Now in my remains  
Our promises that never came  
Except this silent rain  
To wash away the worst of me  
  
Like an army, falling  
One by one by one  
Like an army, falling  
One by one by one
