It's been a mystery  
But still they try to see  
Why something good can hurt so bad  
Caught on a one-way street  
The taste of bittersweet  
Love will survive somehow, somewhere  
  
One love, feeds the fire  
One heart, burns desire  
One love, who's crying now?  
Two hearts, born to run  
Who'll be the lonely one?  
One love, who's crying now?  
  
So many stormy nights  
So many wrong or rights  
Neither could change their headstrong ways  
And in a lover's rage  
They tore another page  
The fighting is worth the love they save  
  
One love, feeds the fire  
One heart, burns desire  
One love, who's crying now?  
Two hearts, born to run  
Who'll be the lonely one?  
One love, who's crying now?  
  
Only so many tears you can cry  
'Til the heartache is over  
And now you can say your love,  
Will never die  
  
Whoa ooh ooh, ooh ooh  
  
One love, feeds the fire  
One heart, burns desire  
One love, who's crying now?  
Two hearts, born to run  
Who'll be the lonely one?  
One love, who's crying now?
