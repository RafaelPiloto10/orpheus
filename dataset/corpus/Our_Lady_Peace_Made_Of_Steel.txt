I can be anything  
That you want me to be  
A punching bag  
A piece of string, no  
That reminds you not to think  
  
They found the note down in your car  
It's not your fault it gets this hard  
Gets this hard  
  
[Chorus]  
Hold your head high  
Don't look down  
I'm by your side  
I won't back down  
You wanted a hero tonight  
Well I'm not made of steel  
I'm not made of steel  
But your secret's safe with me  
  
I can be anything  
That you want me to be  
A holy cross  
Some sympathy, no  
That reminds you how to bleed  
  
They found the note down in your car  
You climbed up here to fall apart  
Fall apart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No, your secret's safe with me  
  
They knock you down  
I'll pick you up  
They laugh at you  
I'll shut them up  
  
But I'm not made of steel [Repeat x4]  
But your secret's safe with me  
Yeah, your secret's safe with me  
Yeah  
  
Hold your head high  
Don't look down  
I'm by your side  
I won't back down  
You wanted a hero tonight
