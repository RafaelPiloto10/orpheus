You know I need it  
To ride in your car  
I know it's dangerous  
You're going too far  
I'm always with you  
Wherever you go  
  
This is a sensual  
The way you drive is just sensational  
I hate to love you  
Love you all the same  
You know baby  
Driving is a serious game  
  
You gonna get me a heart attack  
Stop it, hold it  
Hold it back  
  
I know it's dangerous  
You're going too far  
I'm always with you wherever you go  
  
You know I need it  
To ride in your car  
I'm always with you  
Wherever you go  
  
This is a sensual  
The way you drive is just sensational  
I hate to love you  
Love you all the same  
You know baby  
Driving is a serious game  
  
You gonna get me a heart attack  
Stop it, hold it  
Hold it back
