Stay for just a while  
Stay, and let me look at you  
Its been so long, I hardly knew you  
Standing in the door  
Stay with me a while  
I only want to talk to you  
We've traveled halfway round the world  
To find ourselves again  
  
September morn  
We danced until the night became a brand new day  
Two lovers playing scenes from some romantic play
