Yo, turn it up a little so you (Focus)  
  
Homeboy I ain't never gon let em take me under  
I maintain with a mindframe to bring the rain and the thunder  
Fast 5 days straight to meditate, build hunger  
and focus(focus) on the days and times(focus) that approach us  
  
Bad seeds is planted to grow large and toke us  
Whatever is left will be eaten alive by the locusts  
Hear me not, believe me later  
You can feel the animosity through this Irwin Vega  
A full clip to make this bullshit stop  
I'm in the struggle to bring the underground to the top  
Head lock, Las Angeles, home of the scandalous  
And beautiful bitches, smell the aroma  
Nothin but doja, the Likwit soldier  
Quick to fold you in half, sit back and laugh at you  
Xzibit standing firm ground like a stone statue  
You ever have a .45 slug blown at you?  
We unstoppable, so everything is possible  
  
[Chorus]  
Xzibit maintain focus till the casket drop  
That's (focus) the only to survive and stay on top  
Fast 5 days straight to meditate, build hunger  
And focus(focus) on the days and times that approach us  
And focus(focus) on the days and times that approach us  
  
Be on the lookout  
Cause this year some niggas gettin' took out  
Takin' off of the scene  
Man versus machine  
I live between a rock and a hard place  
About face stand straight  
This is General X  
Dedicated to the critics that hope and pray  
That some day I'll go soft  
And try to swing with a gimmick and fall off  
Runnin' with dogs you can't call off  
Isolate to eliminate  
That's the mind state  
Never violate  
I make your whole chest dialate  
Defeat my appetite to annhilate  
I carry the weight from state to state  
Spread the product  
Tired of friends and relatives gettin' shot up  
It's time for some action like Redman' and be -Real  
Cause I can be a dead man if I stand still  
Too close for comfort, I'm under the gun  
Like a felon going back  
I'm ready to crack  
Making niggas role the credits and fade to black  
Fade to black fade to black fade to black  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, everyday of my life  
Got clear thinking, and everything stay tight  
Drop bomb shit  
Only bomb shit  
Here come Xzibit to break it down like this  
  
[Chorus]
