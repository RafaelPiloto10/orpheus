When you walked in the room, I thought I'd forgotten you  
Turns out it isn't true after all  
And now I do regret all the things I said  
I can't take this anymore  
  
I want you  
I'm telling you  
Oh, oh  
  
C'mon c'mon, I know I was wrong  
Throw my hands up and take the blame  
I still believe in you and me  
Do you feel the same  
I'm sitting there waitin' for you, and baby I can't ignore you  
I just adore you, and I can't get you outta my head  
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon  
Ooooooo  
  
I'll do overtime, just to make you mine  
I can't remember why I left you behind  
Things that I shoulda done, I was having too much fun  
Why did I let you go?  
  
I want you, and I'm telling you  
Oh, oh  
  
C'mon c'mon, I know I was wrong  
Throw my hands up and take the blame  
I still believe in you and me  
Do you feel the same  
I'm sittin' there waitin' for you, and baby I can't ignore you  
I just adore you, and I can't get you outta my head  
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon  
Ooooooo  
  
I was such a fool  
Oh, I was so damn cruel  
But I'm willing to change  
I wanna be your man again  
  
C'mon c'mon, I know I was wrong  
Throw my hands up and take the blame  
I still believe in you and me  
Do you feel the same  
I'm sitting there waitin' for you, and baby I can't ignore you  
I just adore you, and I can't get you outta my head  
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
