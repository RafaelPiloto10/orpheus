Well, uptown got its hustlers  
And the Bowery got its bums  
42nd Street got Big Jim Walker  
He's a pool shootin' son of a gun  
  
Yeah, he's big and dumb as a man can come  
He's stronger than a country horse  
And when the bad folks all get together at night  
They all call Big Jim, 'Boss'  
  
Just because, yeah, they say you don't tug on Superman's cape  
You don't spit into the wind  
You don't pull the mask off the ol' lone ranger  
And you don't mess around with Jim, oh no  
  
From the south of Alabama come a country boy  
He said, "I'm looking for a man named Jim  
Now I am a pool shootin' boy, my name is Willie Mccoy  
Down home, folks call me Slim"  
  
I'm lookin' for the man on 42nd Street  
He's drivin' some drop top Cadillac  
And I know it sounds funny  
That he took all my money  
Now I come to get my money back  
  
Everybody say, "Jack"  
And they say, "You don't tug on Superman's cape  
You don't spit into the wind  
You don't pull the mask off the Ole Lone Ranger  
And you don't mess around with Jim"  
  
A hush fell over the pool room  
As Jimmy walked in off the street  
And when the cutting was done  
The only part that wasn't bloody  
Was the souls of the big man's feet  
  
He was cut in a million places  
And was shot in a couple more  
And you better believe  
They told a different kinda story  
When Big Jim hit the floor  
  
And they say, "You don't tug on Superman's cape  
You don't spit into the wind  
You don't pull the mask off the Ole Lone Ranger  
And you don't mess around with Slim"  
  
You don't tug on Superman's cape  
You don't spit into the wind  
You don't pull the mask off the Ole Lone Ranger  
And you don't mess around with Slim  
  
You don't tug on Superman's cape  
You don't spit into the wind  
You don't pull the mask off the Ole Lone Ranger  
And you don't mess around with Slim
