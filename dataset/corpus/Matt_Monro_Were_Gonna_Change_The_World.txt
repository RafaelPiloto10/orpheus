Shirley Wood gulped down her breakfast  
Shut the fridge and joined the throng  
Margaret Beatty snatched the milk in  
Scanned the news and went along  
  
Annie Harris drew the curtains  
Screwed her eyes up, had a peep  
Saw the marchers, heard their voices  
Making early morning noises  
Stumbled back to bed and tried to sleep  
  
Come with us, run with us  
We're gonna change the world  
You'll be amazed, so full of praise  
When we've rearranged your world  
We're gonna change your world  
  
Shuffling through the cold black morning  
Went the marchers, spirits low  
Grunting greetings, grimly pressing  
Onto where they had to go  
  
When the sun came up, they brightened  
Stopped to have their thermos brew  
Annie Harris got up gladly  
Pondered for a little, sadly  
Then got on with what she had to do  
  
So, come with us, run with us  
We're gonna change the world  
You'll be amazed, so full of praise  
When we've rearranged your world  
We're gonna change your world  
  
At their target, numbers swollen  
'Up the marches', banners go  
Chanting, shouting out with leaflets  
Protest for everyone to know  
  
Sit in front of all the traffic  
Harried, busy shopping wives  
Try to stir their ostrich notions  
Whip them up to wild emotions  
Put some fire into their wretched lives  
  
So, come with us, run with us  
We're gonna change your world  
You'll be amazed, so full of praise  
When we've rearranged your world  
We're gonna change your world  
  
Shirley Wood was dragged still sitting  
By a policeman from the road  
Margaret Beatty had her face slapped  
By a man she tried to goad  
  
Annie Harris in the office  
Paused in typing, thought of Don  
Glanced again at his last letter  
Died for others to live better  
Brushed away a tear and carried on  
  
Come with us, run with us  
We're gonna change the world  
You'll be amazed, so full of praise  
When we've rearranged your world  
We're gonna change...  
Come with us, run with us  
We're gonna change your world  
You'll be amazed, so full of praise  
When we've rearranged your world  
We're gonna change...  
So, come with us, run with us  
We're gonna change your world  
You'll be amazed, so full of praise  
When we've rearranged your world  
We're gonna change...
