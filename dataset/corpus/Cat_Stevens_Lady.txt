I was cold and so alone, but I couldn't help but moan  
When the life that I was shown started crumbling  
Then this crazy world that I live in started giving more to me  
  
Oh, I've never known a lady like yourself  
Oh, I've never known a lady  
  
I was searching all the world, looking for a girl  
Then a lady made an Earl of this poor boy  
Now this crazy world that I live in started giving more to me  
  
Oh, I've never known a lady like yourself  
Oh, I've never known a lady  
  
Now this crazy world that I live in started giving more to me  
Oh, I've never known a lady like yourself  
Oh, I've never known a lady  
  
I've never known a lady
