[Verse 1]  
[Niall]  
I figured it out  
I figured out from black and white  
Seconds and hours  
Maybe we had to take some time  
  
[Liam]  
I know how it goes  
I know how it goes from wrong and right  
Silence and sound  
Did they ever hold each other tight, like us?  
  
Did they ever fight, like us?  
  
[Chorus]  
[Harry]  
You and I  
We don't want to be like them  
We can make it 'till the end  
Nothing can come between You and I  
  
Not even the Gods above  
Can separate the two of us  
No, nothing can come between You and I  
  
Oh, you and I  
  
[Verse 2]  
[Zayn]  
I figured it out  
Saw the mistakes of up and down  
Meet in the middle  
There's always room for common ground  
  
[Louis]  
I see what it's like  
I see what it's like for day and night  
Never together  
'Cause they see things in a different light, like us  
  
But they never tried, like us  
  
[Chorus]  
[Harry]  
You and I  
We don't want to be like them  
We can make it 'till the end  
Nothing can come between You and I  
  
Not even the  
Gods above  
Can separate the  
Two of us  
  
[Zayn]  
'Cause you and I!!!  
  
[Chorus]  
[All]  
We don't want to be like them,  
We can make it 'till the end  
Nothing can come between  
You and I  
  
Not even the  
Gods above  
Can separate the  
Two of us  
  
No, nothing can come between  
You and I  
Oh, You and I  
You and I  
  
[Outro]  
We can make it if we try  
You and I  
Oh  
You and I
