Not so long ago I set out on this road  
With my friends and my companions by my side  
And I think of you wherever I do go  
I'm a rambler, I ain't hard to satisfy  
  
[Chorus:]  
Won't be long till I am home again with you  
Just a few more miles to go  
Won't be long till I can get back on my own  
Won't be long till I can spend my time with you  
  
In the airport I'm standing in a line  
Search my pockets, check me out and I'm alright  
It's not hard but it ain't easy all the time  
To be in some other town most every night  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Oh, I miss the singing from porch banjo nights  
And when friends come by to pass the time away  
And when the winds that chill the Bershires in the night  
Heading east through Massachusetts toward the bay
