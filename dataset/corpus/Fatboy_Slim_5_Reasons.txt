Everytime I try to explain  
all you want to do is walk away  
gonna get you baby-gonna get the message through to you  
You don't understand when I'm not there  
then you tell my friends that I don't care  
In case you didn't get it..I'm gonna spell it out for you  
  
REASON 1 - You don't want me  
REASON 2 - You don't need me  
REASON 3 - You don't care I'm alive  
Do you, do you, do you want 4 and 5 ???  
REASON 4 - Im so helpless  
REASON 5 - You couldn't care less  
gimme , gimme , gimme a reason  
I don't wanna hear another good GOODBYE  
  
I know everything you say is true

we belong together  
gonna get the message through to you  
but I don't understand the way you are  
all you wanna do is break my heart

REASON 1 - You don't want me  
REASON 2 - You don't need me
