You took me wrong just because we kissed  
And now I don't know how to say goodbye  
I know it's wrong when you're holding me like this  
Still won't you stay, let me love you for awhile  
You know I'm not that strong when I see you smile  
Can't you see  
This is all a big mistake  
I should try and walk away  
But I need someone to hold me  
And I know there's no way that this can last  
Still I know that if you ask me to  
I know I would stay  
Tonight, just for tonight  
You look at me and you don't understand  
You know I'm not the one that could feel your dreams  
I can't believe that this is how I am  
Still won't you stay, let me love you for awhile  
You know I'm not that strong when I see you smile  
Can't you see  
This is all a big mistake  
I should try and walk away  
But I need someone to hold me  
And I know there's no way that this can last  
Still I know that if you ask me to  
I know I would stay  
Tonight  
I love the way you watch me  
I love you the way we move  
But in my heart I know  
I'll never be in love with you  
Can't you see  
Can't you see  
This is all a big mistake  
I should try and walk away  
But I need someone to hold me  
And I know there's no way that this can last  
Still I know that if you ask me to  
I know I would stay  
Tonight, just for tonight
