In the cruel month grey morning  
I woke up freezing cold  
To possibly start over  
Before the day got old  
  
To my anger in my solitude  
I had to say goodbye  
So I turned on my ignition  
No reason to deny  
  
I-95  
Alright  
From the canyons on the sidewalks  
Where the Wall St. banners fly  
  
To the farmlands and the deserts  
And the flying saucer skies  
To the running of the life lines  
The highway spirits rhyme  
  
There's a voice that speaks so clear to me  
And says  
I-95  
Yeah  
  
And I say hey hey hey yeah  
I'm so glad I'm alive  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
I'm so glad I can drive  
  
Burning down I-95  
It's a simple song of freedom  
And it feels like de ja vu  
Tai Jean knew about it  
  
John Lennon sang it too  
It's the ringing bell of truth and free speech  
On the radio  
It's there in the Constitution  
  
It's little sister  
It's called rock 'n roll  
And she's alright  
And I sing  
  
Hey hey hey yeah  
I'm so glad I'm alive  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
I'm so glad I can drive  
  
Burning down I-95  
Yeah yeah  
I'm so glad I can drive  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
I'm so glad I'm alive  
Burning down I-95  
Yeah  
I-95  
  
She's alright  
I-95  
In daylight  
I-95  
  
At nighttime too  
She's alright  
She's alright  
She's alright  
She's alright  
  
Yeah  
Said she's alright
