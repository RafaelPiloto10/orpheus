Now, me and this friend named, Streetlife Brown  
We got a bottle of red and walked downtown  
One hand on the jug and one on time  
He said, "I bet you a dollar against this next line"  
I said, "don't let the sunshine fool ya  
Don't let the bluebirds tool ya  
Don't let the women do ya  
Put your hand in mine"  
Oh, advice is fine if you've got a mind  
To listen to the end that's got the time  
But the muse?ll get ya if you don't watch out  
He's equipped to know what it?s all about  
don't let the sunshine fool ya  
Don't let the bluebirds tool ya  
Don't let the women do ya  
Put your hand in mine  
Oh, Fanon street in the afternoon is  
An easy way to get out of tune  
But the hard soap salesman, he said, "No dice"  
When I asked politely for a better price  
He said, "don't let that sunshine fool ya  
Don't let the bluebirds tool ya  
Don't let the women do ya  
Put your hand in mine"  
Well, here's a song for you, child of mine  
I hope you make it through this time  
Get yourself a piece of that rainbow pie  
No reason in the world you can't get by  
But don't let the sunshine fool ya  
And don't let the bluebirds tool ya  
And don't let the women do ya  
Put your hand in mine  
Oh, don't let the sunshine fool ya  
Don't let the bluebirds tool ya  
Don't let the women do ya  
Put your hand in mine  
Oh, don't let the sunshine fool ya
