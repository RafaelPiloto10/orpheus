Now you say you're leaving  
Leaving me without a friend  
How can you do what you're doing to me  
How can you say you want to be free of me  
  
Now you say it's over  
And your walkin out my door  
Tellin me you're going away for good  
Never coming back and I'll never see you again  
  
Chorus:  
  
You left me here with my empty arms  
My empty rooms  
And my empty heart is crying  
  
Nothing is left for me now you're gone  
It just aint right and I know it can't last I'm dying  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Lead
