Welcome  
In Lucy's Bar  
Hey you gentlemen over there  
Come on closer  
See me play  
The sensational game  
It's the only thing I've got in my life  
And I play it every day  
And, well, believe it or not,  
It's just, pinball  
And for me it's  
Claro Que Si  
Claro Que Si  
  
Come, come close to me  
I tell you man you will see  
I'm like happy tree  
Come close and then you will see  
  
Every ball for me's another game  
For you this always looks the same  
Every ball for me's another game  
For you this always looks the same  
  
Hey you, man you watch me  
Might be right I am a fool  
But man why don't you tell me  
If you know a better tool  
  
All the gates are lit  
This is very good for me  
It's like a kiss  
Watch out man and you will see  
Now all lights are on  
Believe me man that I have won  
I know for you this doesn't look a lot  
For me this is the only thing I got  
  
I really couldn't care less  
If you take me a for a fool  
I know you couldn't show me  
Any better tool  
  
Oy oy oy  
I like my toy  
Claro que si  
Is yes for sure  
Oy oy oy  
I like my toy  
A knack inside  
I win another game  
I press the button and it's not the same
