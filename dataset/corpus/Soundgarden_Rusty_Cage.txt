You wired me awake  
And hit me with a hand of broken nails  
You tied my lead and pulled my chain  
To watch my blood begin t boil  
  
But I'm gonna break  
I'm gonna break my  
I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run  
  
Too cold to start a fire  
I'm burning diesel burning dinosaur bones  
I'll take the river down to still water  
And ride a pack of dogs  
  
I'm gonna break  
I'm gonna break my  
I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run  
  
Hits like a Phillips head  
Into my brain  
It's gonna be too dark  
To sleep again  
Cutting my teeth on bars  
And rusty chains, I'm gonna break my  
Rusty cage and run  
  
When the forest burns  
Along the road  
Like God's eyes  
In my headlights  
When the dogs are looking  
For their bones  
And it's raining icepicks  
On your steel shore  
  
I'm gonna break  
I'm gonna break my  
I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run
