I'm saying all the things that I know you like  
Making good conversation  
I've gotta handle you just right  
You know what I mean  
  
I took you to an intimate restaurant  
Then to a suggestive movie  
There's nothing left to talk about  
Unless it's horizontally  
  
[Chorus]  
Let's get physical, physical  
I want to get physical  
Let's get into physical  
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk  
Let me hear your body talk  
  
I've been patient, I've been good  
Tried to keep my hands on the table  
Oh it's getting hard to hold me back  
You know what I mean  
  
I'm sure you understand my point of view  
We know each other better  
You've gotta know you're bringing out  
The animal in me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Physical) I want to get physical  
Let's get into physical  
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk  
Let me hear your body talk  
  
(Get physical)  
(Do you hear me)  
(Mmm, yeah)  
(C'mon)  
(I know you want me)  
(Physical)  
  
Woah, yeah  
Physical, physical, physical  
I want to get physical  
Let's get into physical  
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk  
Let me hear your body talk  
I want to get physical, physical  
I want to get physical  
Let's get into physical  
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk  
Let me hear your body talk  
Let's get physical, physical  
I want to get physical  
Let's get into physical  
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk  
Let me hear your body talk
