Isn't it weird?  
Isn't it strange?  
Even though we're just two strangers on this runaway train  
We're both trying to find a place in the sun  
We've lived in the shadows, but doesn't everyone?  
Isn't it strange how we all feel a little bit weird sometimes?  
  
Weird, oh ho  
  
Isn't it hard  
Standing in the rain?  
You're on the verge of going crazy and your heart's in pain  
No one can hear, but you're screaming so loud  
You feel like you're all alone in a faceless crowd  
Isn't it strange how we all get a little bit weird sometimes?  
  
Sitting on the side  
Waiting for a sign  
Hoping that my luck will change  
Reaching for a hand that can understand someone who feels the same  
When you live in a cookie-cutter world, being different is a sin  
So you don't stand out  
But you don't fit in  
  
Weird, whoa, oh  
Sitting on the side  
Waiting for a sign  
Hoping that my luck will change  
Oh ho  
Reaching for a hand that can understand someone who feels the same  
When you live in a cookie cutter world if you're different you can't win  
So you don't stand out and you don't fit in  
Oh, isn't it strange how we all feel a little bit weird?  
Strange, how we all get a little bit  
Strange, how we all feel a little bit weird sometimes  
Oh, just a little bit weird sometimes
