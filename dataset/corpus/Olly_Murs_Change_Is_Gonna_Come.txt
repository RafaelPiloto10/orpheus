Something's come, feel it down in my bones  
Yeah it's been a long time gone, but ya here tonight  
Now let's not look back, ya keeping me right on track  
Feel the karma coming back, we're gonna be alright  
  
If everything's a constant battle, sometimes you won't win  
If all our strengths turn into struggles we won't be giving in  
  
We'll be living on an all time high  
I'm trying to keep it  
We've learnt to walk but now it's time to run  
A change is gonna come  
Living on an all time high  
I'm gonna live it  
First thought we couldn't but it can be done  
Change is gonna come  
  
Troubled times, been a good friend of mine  
Yeah it's been around a while keeping me down  
But through it all, even with a broken soul  
Here I am standing tall cause you're around  
  
If everything's a constant battle, sometimes you won't win  
If all our strengths turn into struggles we won't be giving in  
  
We'll be living on an all time high  
I'm trying to keep it  
We've learnt to walk but now it's time to run  
A change is gonna come  
Living on an all time high  
  
I'm gonna live it  
First thought we couldn't but it can be done  
Change is gonna come  
  
For every sign that said we'd never find the means to  
For every word they said they never heard that they knew  
Given time I want some piece of mind  
Same as you do  
Sing it!  
  
Change is  
Coming  
You better be waiting  
You better be  
Ready  
Running  
Faster, faster it's coming  
  
We'll be living on an all time high  
I'm trying to keep it  
We've learnt to walk but now it's time to run  
A change is gonna come  
Living on an all time high  
I'm trying to keep up  
We've learnt to walk but now it's time to run  
Change is gonna come  
  
Living on an all time high  
I'm gonna live it  
First thought we couldn't but it can be done  
Change is gonna come  
  
Change is coming, oh you better be running  
I see you ready, I keep running  
Faster and faster it's coming  
  
Change is coming, oh you better be running  
I see you ready, I keep running  
Faster and faster it's coming
