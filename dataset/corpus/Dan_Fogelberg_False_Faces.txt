Oil on canvas  
Couplets and stanzas to divine who you are  
Pencil portrayals and jealous betrayals  
Get you further afar  
Oh false faces and meaningless chases  
I travel alone  
Oh first places and calendar races  
I need a home  
Hostile hotel walls, footfalls and phone calls  
And you're on the line  
Gentle coercions and bitter desertions  
When the truth is a lie  
Oh false faces and meaningless chases  
I travel alone  
Oh first places and calendar races  
I need a home  
Lover twice yearly  
That last battle nearly cost me the fight  
Broke through the ice and got cut down to size  
And escaped through the night  
Oh false faces and meaningless chases  
I travel alone  
Oh first places and calendar races  
I need a home
