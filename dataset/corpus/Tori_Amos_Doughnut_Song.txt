Had me a trick and a kick and your message  
Well you'll never gain weight from a doughnut hole  
Then thought that I could decipher your message  
There's no one here dear  
No one at all  
  
And if I'm wasting all your time  
This time  
Maybe you never learned to take  
And if I'm hanging on to your shade  
I guess I'm way beyond the pale  
  
And southern men can grow gold  
Can grow pertty  
Blood can be pertty  
Like a delicate man  
Copper to steel to a hinge that is faltered  
That let's you in let's you in let's you in  
Something's just keeping you numb  
  
You told me last night  
You were a sun now with your very own  
  
Devoted satellite  
Happy for you  
And I am sure that I hate you  
Too sons too many too many able fires  
  
And if I'm wasting all your time  
This time  
I think you never learned to take  
And if I'm hanging on to your shade  
I guess I'm way beyond the pale
