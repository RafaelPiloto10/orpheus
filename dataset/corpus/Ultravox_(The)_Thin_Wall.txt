The sound is on the visions move  
The image dance starts once again  
They shuffle with a bovine grace and glide in syncopation  
Just living lines from books we've read  
With atmospheres of days gone by  
With paper smiles  
The screenplay calls a message for the nation  
Chorus:  
And those who sneer will fade and die  
And those who laugh will surely fall  
And those who know will always feel their backs against the thin wall  
The thin wall  
Thin wall  
Grey men who speak of victory  
Shed light upon their stolen life  
They drive by night and act as if they're moved by unheard music  
To step in time and play the part  
With velvet voices smooth and cold  
Their power games a game no more  
And long the chance to use it  
(Chorus)  
And those who dance will spin and turn  
And those who wait will wait no more  
And those talk will hear the word  
And those who sneer will fade and die  
And those who laugh will surely fall  
And those who know will always feel their backs against the thin wall  
The thin wall  
Thin wall  
The thin wall (Repeat 3 times)  
And those who dance  
The thin wall  
And those who talk  
The thin wall  
And those who sneer  
The thin wall  
And those who laugh  
The thin wall  
And those who know  
The thin wall  
And those who dance  
The thin wall  
And those who wait  
The thin wall  
And those who talk  
(Fade)
