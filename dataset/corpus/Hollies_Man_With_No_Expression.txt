There's a man I know with no expression no not none at all  
  
Have you ever ridden horses through a rainstorm  
Or led a lion through a busy street bazaar  
There are many things I'd like to turn you on to  
But somehow I feel you're safer where you are  
  
If you're looking for examples to refer to  
Take a look around yourself I'm sure you'll find  
There are many things to make your life much brighter  
And I'd bet there's many more inside your mind  
  
There's a man I know with no expression no not none at all  
  
There's a man I know with no expression no not none at all  
  
But I've never seen this man laughing  
And come to think of it I've never seen him cry  
But I might by sitting hear him singing  
By and by he'll stop and sigh  
He'll feel a breeze and then begin to freeze  
As he thinks goodbye  
  
Have you ever ridden horses through a rainstorm  
Or led a lion through a busy street bazaar  
There are many things I'd like to turn you on to  
But somehow I feel you're safer where you are  
  
There's a man I know with no expression no not none at all  
There's a man with no expression  
Man with no expression  
Man with no expression
