I just walked in and you were gone  
To your mama's I suppose  
It looks like you won't be back, so I thought you'd ought to know  
I found that note you left today  
It only took you half a page  
I'm gonna grab my old guitar, take a pencil from the jar, fill in the empty
space  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm gonna tell you how I feel, straight-up genuine and real  
Open a bottle of ninety-proof and write a song for you  
Like Kristofferson would do  
  
In each line you're gonna hear "it's my fault" and "I miss you"  
I know it won't be in time, it may not even rhyme  
But all it has to be is true  
  
I'm gonna tell you how I feel, straight-up genuine and real  
Open a bottle of ninety-proof and write a song for you  
Like Kristofferson would do  
  
I'm gonna tell you how I feel, straight-up genuine and real  
Open a bottle of ninety-proof and write a song for you  
Like Kristofferson would do  
  
I'm gonna drink this bottle of ninety-proof and sing this song for you  
Like Kristofferson would do
