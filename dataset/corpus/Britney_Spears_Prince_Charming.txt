Verse 1:  
Hey Prince Charming  
You can kiss my ass  
I don't want cha or your fairy tales  
I want a Dark Night  
Who can rough me up  
Whose middle name is dangerous  
  
I don't want guarantees  
I don't want promises  
I just want a ride baby I'll never forget  
Got no expectations  
No need for a conversation  
Leave the drama out and just get right down to it  
  
Chorus:  
Hey Prince Charming  
I don't want cha  
I don't want cha  
What I want is me a bad, bad boy  
  
Hey Prince Charming  
I don't want cha  
I don't want cha  
What I want is me a bad, bad boy  
  
Hey Prince Charming  
I don't want cha  
I don't want cha  
What I want is me a bad, bad boy  
  
Verse 2:  
I'm talking damage  
With mystery  
I'll keep ya company tonight  
You bring the leather  
I'll bring the lace  
I'll wear it safe tonight  
I don't want future plans  
You can keep your romance  
You can give it to me baby  
Dying on ice  
We can make memories  
If you'll remember me  
You can have a shot  
Have a piece of lime  
  
Chorus:  
Hey Prince Charming  
I don't want cha  
I don't want cha  
What I want is me a bad, bad boy  
  
Hey Prince Charming  
I don't want cha  
I don't want cha  
What I want is me a bad, bad boy  
  
Hey Prince Charming  
I don't want cha  
I don't want cha  
What I want is me a bad, bad boy  
  
Verse 3:  
All I want is me a really bad boy  
Give it to me like a real bad boy  
All I want is me a really bad boy  
Give it to me like a real bad boy  
  
Chorus:  
Hey Prince Charming  
I don't want cha
