Too many words on the tip of my tongue and  
I can never figure out, when to speak when to  
Shout when to shut up when to knock myself out  
  
I need a brainwash, grey matter bath  
I need all the clutter thrown in the trash  
I need a brainwash 'cause I'm a loon  
So could you please throw my head in a tub I  
Could really use a cerebral scrub wash  
Away what I know, it's an over-rated frontal lobe  
  
Expensive thrills, sexual perversity, are always filling  
My mind, mixed with guilt 'cause bombs over  
Dresden are kinda bringin' me down  
  
I need a brainwash, grey matter bath  
I need all the clutter thrown in the trash  
I need a brainwash 'cause I'm a loon  
So could you please throw my head in a tub I  
Could really use a cerebral scrub wash  
Away what I know, it's an over-rated frontal lobe  
  
Cause I'm a psycho babble brain, a real live loon  
A mixed up maniac, I'm certifiable, so punt  
Me in a room right next to Nickleson and give  
Me Thorazine cause all I want to do is sing  
Traditional songs but I like to sing in  
Minor technologies not making sense so could  
You please put my head in a tub I could  
Really use a cerebral scrub wash away  
What I know it's an over rated frontal lobe
