There she goes with a smile on her face  
Riding right next to you  
Goin' out to all those places  
You used to take me to  
  
Wearin' your jacket like it was her own  
I used to wear it so well  
Why on earth did I let you go  
If I hadn't I'd be with you still  
  
Call it jealousy, call me a fool  
But it's more than my eyes want to see  
  
'Cause it should've been me  
With you tonight  
It should've been me  
There by your side  
Seein' you both is hard to believe  
'Cause it should've been me  
  
Flashin' that ring in everyone's face  
The one I gave back last week  
I wonder if you're tellin' her things  
You used to whisper to me  
  
To say it's over don't work anymore  
'Cause it's more than my heart wants to feel  
  
It should've been me  
With you tonight  
It should've been me  
There by your side  
Seein' you both is hard to believe  
'Cause it should've been me  
  
She looks so satisfied  
So close to you that I  
Can't help but wonder why  
I said goodbye last night  
As tears drop from my eyes
