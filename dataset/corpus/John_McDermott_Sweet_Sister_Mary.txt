Sweet sister mary what is this I hear  
I hear that you're planning on leaving from here  
And I fear that it's true there's a great empty space  
Faces are crying all over the place  
Stay mary stay  
Tears and the rain and the dew occupy  
The valley sweet mary where you say goodbye  
Now while under the rain I was told by a fish  
Sweet mary your plan to allow me one wish  
Stay mary stay  
The sun never shines o'er this valley  
The mountains are crying all day  
The trees never change from the autumn  
Since mary said mary can't stay away, away, away  
Sweet sister mary the church closed the doors  
The men's brooms are sweeping the tears from the floors  
And I know you'll be missed but I think we'll survive  
Mary sweet mary may I say good-bye  
Bye mary bye  
Bye mary bye  
Bye mary bye
