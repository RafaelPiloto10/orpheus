J. Bon jovi  
  
Sitting here just watching you sleep  
Wish I could slip inside and be  
In some technicolor dream  
But the airs too thick for one of us to breathe  
I'm not fool enough to think  
You couldn't live life without me  
  
I didn't come this far to throw the towel in  
I didn't fight this hard to walk away  
If I aint smart enough to say I'm sorry  
Its just because the words got in the way  
  
I remember how it used to be  
I was you and you were me  
We were more than just the same  
Now these shoes don't fit, my skins too tight  
When you want a kiss, I take a bite  
Let your heart call up the cops, read me my rights  
  
Last night I drak enough to drown  
Raise a toast to your good looks and to my health  
Look, we both know how much I've let you down  
Janie don't you take your love to town  
  
Janie don't you take your love to town  
Janie don't you take your love to town  
If I've got to beg, Ill beg, just don't walk away  
Janie don't you take your love to town  
  
You deserve a shooter, a saint  
Someone to give it to you straight  
To find the soul throught flesh and bone  
My lifes a treasure, full of sunny weather  
But its left me feeling cold  
Now all you want to do is take me home  
  
I hated you, the night you said you loved me  
I hated you, cause I couldn't love myself  
I'm begging you now, baby please just hold me  
I got one foot in, one foot off the ground  
  
Janie don't you take your love to town  
Janie don't you take your love to town  
If I've got to beg, Ill beg, just don't walk away  
Janie don't you take your love to town  
  
Sitting here while youre fast asleep  
In the bathroom by the sink  
Trying to write the right words down  
I turn out the lights, close my eyes  
There aint no prayers or kiss goodnight  
What Ill forget to say tomorrow, Ill say now  
Janie don't you take your love to town  
  
Janie don't you take your love to town  
Janie don't you take your love to town  
If I've got to beg, Ill beg, just don't walk away  
Janie don't you take your love to town
