I had a love that was so bright  
I used to dream of her each night  
And then rush to her side every morning (oooh)  
I had her all to myself  
We never noticed anyone else  
We didn't even hear the radio warnings  
Our love was no joke, you know  
It was the talk of downtown Tokyo  
We'll be happy forever, I promised her  
But just as I proposed, her feet  
Were made to touch her nose  
As she was crushed by a Japanese monster  
(ohhh-ohhh-ohhh-AAAAAAGH! GODZILLA!)  
Our love was so true  
But now she's 3 foot 2  
And she used to be 5 foot 11  
Her death was unintentional  
But now she's 2-dimensional  
My angel is truly in heaven  
She's the one I kiss and hug  
Till she was crushed like a bug  
I guess it's hard to see a monster above you  
She said she'd save her heart for me  
But now it's there for all to see  
And her last words to me were, "I AAAAAGGHH!"  
Our love was so true  
But now she's 3 foot 2  
And she used to be 5 foot 11  
Her death was unintentional  
But now she's 2-dimensional  
My angel is truly in heaven  
(Take it George!)  
[Guitar solo consisting entirely of glissandos]  
She was young (so young)  
And sweet (so sweet)  
But now she's part (she's part)  
Of the street (the street)  
And I want (so much)  
To have her back (come back)  
So I'll get a putty knife  
So I can scrape her from the crack  
(Oh. You might need a wider brush.)  
Our love was so true  
But now she's 3 foot 2  
And she used to be 5 foot 11  
Her death was unintentional  
But now she's 2-dimensional  
My angel is truly in heaven  
My angel is truly in heaven  
My angel is truly in heaven
