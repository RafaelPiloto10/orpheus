On a foggy night, an abandoned road  
In a twilight mirror mirage  
With no indication of a service station  
Or an all night garage, I was misinformed  
I was misdirected cause the interchange  
Never intersected leaving me marooned  
Beneath a bloodshot moon  
All upon a foggy night, on a foggy night  
An abandoned road, in a blurred brocade  
Collage, is that a road motel?  
I can't really tell, is that what you  
Might call some kind of a vacancy lodge  
Cause there's no consolation, what  
Kind of situation to be aimlessly skewed  
Amidst a powder blue?  
No tell tail light clue  
Spun like the spell you spin  
This precarious pandemonium  
I'm stranded, all upon a foggy night  
All upon a foggy night  
On a foggy night
