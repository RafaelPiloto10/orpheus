There are times  
When love soaks you to the bone  
'N then those moments leave you wonderin'  
If you'll lose your mind or lose control  
  
Life is nothing without love  
Love is nothing if not freedom  
  
They tell me the gates of hell  
That you shake 'n you rattle  
Are secretly locked from inside  
  
[Chorus]  
You hope 'n pray you'll find  
The one thing on your mind  
Not until you know  
The Art of Letting Go  
'N it may seem to be  
Defying gravity  
That's because they know  
The Art of Letting Go  
  
You may think  
You built a present perfect world  
And you may wonder to yourself  
Does anyone really know what else could ever matter?  
  
But the Man with His hand  
On the hammer  
Wears a velvet glove  
  
Does the rich man know he's poor?  
Does the beggar care for much more than survival?  
  
When you look into the eyes of children laughing  
Do you remember who you were?  
Or who you are?  
  
Life is nothing without love  
Love is nothing if not freedom  
  
They tell me the gates of hell  
That you shake 'n you rattle  
Are secretly locked  
From inside  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You hope and pray you'll find  
A love to last all time  
Not until you know  
The Art of Letting Go  
And it may seem to be  
Defying gravity  
That's because they know  
The Art of Letting Go  
  
You're dying to believe  
In love eternally  
Not until you know  
The Art of Letting Go  
And it may seem to be  
Defying gravity  
That's because we know  
The Art of Letting Go  
  
You can't go through it  
Without going through it  
'Til it goes through you  
'Til you know the truth
