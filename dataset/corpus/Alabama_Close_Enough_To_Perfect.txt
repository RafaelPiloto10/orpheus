Sometimes her morning coffee's way too strong  
And sometimes what she says she says all wrong  
But right or wrong she's there beside me  
Like only a friend would be  
And that's close enough to perfect for me  
  
Now she's been known to wear her pants too tight  
And drinking puts her out just like a light  
Heaven know's she's not an angel, but she'd really like to be  
And that's close enough to perfect for me  
  
She kisses me each morning  
And smiles her sleepy smile  
And she don't have to say it  
I can see it in her eyes  
Don't you worry about my woman  
Or what you think she ought to be  
'Cause she's close enough to perfect for me  
  
Well sometimes she gets down and starts to cry  
But then again a lady has a right  
She's everything I ever wanted, she's all I'll ever need  
She's close enough to perfect for me  
  
She kisses me each morning  
And smiles her sleepy smile  
And she don't have to say it  
I can see it in her eyes  
Don't you worry about my woman  
Or what you think she ought to be  
'Cause she's close enough to perfect for me  
  
Oh, she's close enough to perfect for me
