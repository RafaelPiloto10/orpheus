I seen a girl on a one way corridor  
Stealing down a wrong way street  
For all the world like an urban toreador  
She had wheels on on her feet  
Well the cars do the usual dances  
Same old cruise and the kerbside crawl  
But the roller girl she's taking chances  
They just love to see her take them all  
  
No fears alone at night she's sailing through the crowd  
In her ears the phones are tight and the music's playing loud  
  
Hallelujah here she comes queen roller ball  
Enchante what can I say don't care at all  
You know she used to have to wait around  
She used to be the lonely one  
But now that she can skate around town  
She's the only one  
  
No fears alone at night she's sailing through the crowd  
In her ears the phones are tight and the music's playing loud  
She gets rock and roll and a rock and roll station  
And a rock and roll dream  
She's making movies on location  
She don't know what it means  
But the music make her want to be the story  
And the story was whatever was the song what it was  
Roller girl don't worry  
DJ play the movies all night long  
  
She tortures taxi drivers just for fun  
She like to read their lips  
Says toro toro taxi see ya tomorrow my son  
I swear she let a big truck grease her hip  
She got her own world in the city  
You can't intrude on her  
She got her own world in the city  
'Cause the city's been so rude to her  
  
No fears alone at night she's sailing through the crowd  
In her ears the phones are tight and the music's playing loud  
She gets rock and roll and a rock and roll station  
And a rock and roll dream  
She's making movies on location  
She don't know what it means  
But the music make her want to be the story  
And the story was whatever was the song what it was  
Roller girl don't worry  
DJ play the movies all night long  
  
Come slipping and sliding  
Life's roller ball  
Slipping and a sliding  
Skate away that's all  
Shala shalay hey hey skate away  
She's going singing shala shalay hey hey  
Skate away
