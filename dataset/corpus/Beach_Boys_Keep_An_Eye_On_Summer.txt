Keep an eye on summer this year  
Keep an eye on summer  
Keep an eye on  
  
We said goodbye last September  
Your words I still can hear  
Keep an eye on summer this ahh haaa ahhhh (summer)  
(keep an eye on)  
Those things I say in my letters  
You'll find them most sincere  
Keep an eye on summer this year-ear-ear  
  
Soon we'll be graduating  
And we'll be so far apart  
And though you could be dating  
I'm waiting and waiting  
  
And as we look at the future  
Though it be through a tear  
Keep an eye on summer this (year)ahh haaa ahhhh  
(keep an eye on summer)  
(keep an eye on)  
Ahhh haaaa ahhhh  
(keep an eye on summer)  
(keep an eye on)  
Ahhh haaaa ahhhh  
(keep an eye on summer)  
(keep an eye on)  
Ahhh haaaa ahhhh
