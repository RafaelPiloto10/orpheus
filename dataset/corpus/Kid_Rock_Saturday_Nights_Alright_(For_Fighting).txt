It's getting late, I haven't seen my date  
So tell me when the boys get here  
It's seven o'clock and I wanna rock  
Wanna get a belly full of beer  
  
My old man's drunker than a bar full of wino's  
And his older lady she don't care  
My sister looks cute with her braces and boots  
And a handful of grease in her hair  
  
Don't give us none of your aggravation  
We've had it with your discipline  
Saturday night's alright for fighting  
Get a little action in  
  
Get about as oiled as a diesel train  
Gonna set this town alight  
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like  
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright  
  
P-p-packed pretty tight in here tonight  
I'm looking for a woman to see me right  
I could use a little muscle to get what I need  
I'll drink a fifth of Jack and scream out she's with me  
  
A couple of sounds that I really like  
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike  
I'm a juvenile product of the working class  
Whose best friend floats from the bottom of a glass  
  
Don't give us none of your aggravation  
We've had it with your discipline  
Saturday night's alright for fighting  
Get a little action in  
  
Get about as oiled as a diesel train  
Gonna set this town alight  
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like  
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright  
  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
  
Don't give us none of your aggravation  
We've had it with your discipline  
Saturday night's alright for fighting  
Get a little action in  
  
Get about as oiled as a diesel train  
Gonna set this town alight  
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like  
Saturday night's alright  
  
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday  
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday  
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night's alright  
  
Ooh, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday  
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday  
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night's alright  
  
Ooh, Saturday, Saturday, Saturday  
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday  
Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night's alright
