There's Frank James and Jesse James  
Billy the Kid and all the rest  
Supposed to be some bad cats  
Way out in the West  
  
If those cats could of dug me  
And my gangster ways  
They would have hung up their guns  
And dug into their graves  
  
Cause I'm a gangster  
A gangster of love  
I'm a gangster  
A gangster of love  
Now look here  
When I go into a bar  
Girls from near and far  
Say I'm a gangster  
A gangster of love  
  
I jumped in my white horse Cadillac  
I rode across the border line  
I roped 55 girls  
I kissed them all the same time  
  
Took 25 or 30, put 'em all on a freight  
There was a million dollar reward for me in each and every state  
Sheriff says is your name Stevie "Guitar" Miller in a very deep voice  
And I said yes sir brother sheriff, and that's your wife on the back of my
horse  
  
I can't help it  
I'm a gangster  
I can't help it  
You know, I'm a gangster
