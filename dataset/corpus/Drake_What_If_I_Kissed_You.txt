[Drake]  
What if I kissed you right now  
How would we explain it  
Trying to imagine how it might sound  
If I just yelled out  
What if I kissed you right now  
Would it bring us any closer  
Take a weight off our shoulders  
Take me I'm yours  
And I don't really care who knows it  
Can you afford to be open with all these emotions  
If you were a secret how long could you keep it  
Lyrics courtesy of www.killerhiphop.com  
Keep it to yourself don't tell nobody else  
Not a problem [?]  
And you just be mine  
And you just be mine  
And you just be mine (just, just be mine)  
  
What if I kissed you right now  
Would it bring us any closer  
Take a weight off of our shoulders  
Tell on me  
I don't mind cause if they ask me about it I won't lie  
Admit that I'm yours  
I doon't really care who knows it  
Can we afford to be that open with all these emotions  
  
If you were a secret how long could you keep it  
Keep it to yourself don't tell nobody else  
Not a problem [?]  
And you just be mine  
And you just be mine  
And you just be mine (just, just be mine)  
  
What if I kissed you right now  
What if I kissed you right now  
  
And you just be mine  
And you just be mine (all mine)  
And you just be mine (just, just be mine)  
  
What if I kissed you right now
