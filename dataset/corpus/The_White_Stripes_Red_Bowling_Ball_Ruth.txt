Well, pay attention  
Attention to my words  
I love ya  
I don't know what you heard  
And this fire  
Has got to go for sure  
  
Red bowling ball  
Red bowling ball Ruth  
Well that's somethin'  
Then I should know the truth  
I said, you roll it  
And then it breaks your tooth  
  
Well Peter  
Are you in the wrong town?  
Well, I love this girl  
So hell shall come around  
And you leavin'  
Will be the only sound
