I'm driving down a dusty road  
I've got nowhere to go  
No place that I can call my own  
On and on this road is burning  
  
I'm leaving all this crap behind  
The past is gone, the future's blind  
Don't care how long it takes this time  
On and on I'll take the long way home  
  
The long way home  
The long way home  
If it's for me it's on the way home  
  
Like fragments of a broken mind  
I splinter by my own design  
This search is not a waste of time  
On and on this road keeps burning  
  
My hands are glued upon the wheel  
The road ahead is all I feel  
The only thing left that's real  
On and on I'll take this long way home  
  
The long way home  
The long way home  
I will go alone  
I will go and find it on my own  
  
What lies ahead  
You cannot find for me  
On and on I'll take the long way home
