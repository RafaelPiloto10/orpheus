Everybody's talking, the world is goin' round  
Rumors are flying all over the town  
How could a stranger know what's still a  
mystery to me  
  
I don't know what to call it  
I don't know what it is  
I only know for certain I've never felt like this  
And, baby, it's the one thing I can believe  
  
There's nothing I fear in this life  
Long as I've got you by my side  
  
[Chorus]  
We're mighty as a hurricane, tougher than stone  
Stronger than anything I've ever known  
One look at us together anybody could see  
There ain't nothin' that can stand up to  
The power of you and me  
  
We're only good together, no good on our own  
Everything about you feels just like home  
Before you I don't remember how I got along  
  
You are the spark to my flame  
The only one that burns in your name  
  
[Chorus]  
So many souls searching for  
What we're holding right in our hands  
You're the woman that makes me a better man  
  
[Chorus]
