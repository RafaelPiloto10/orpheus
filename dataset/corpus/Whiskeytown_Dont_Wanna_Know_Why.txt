Don't wanna know why you like me I don't care  
Don't wanna know why I walk by and you stare  
Don't wanna know why just to wanna know why  
Don't wanna know why just to wanna know why  
  
When I... breathe in, breathe out.  
Carry on, carry out.  
Try to... drive through your life  
Breathe in, breathe out.  
Carry on, carry out.  
Try to... never say goodbye  
  
Don't wanna know how you're feeling I don't care  
Don't wanna know when you'll meet me I'm not there  
Don't wanna know why just to wanna know why  
Don't wanna know why just to wanna know why  
  
When I... breathe in, breathe out.  
Carry on, carry out.  
Try to... drive through your life  
Breathe in, breathe out.  
Carry on, carry out.  
Try to... never say goodbye  
  
I wish I knew  
How to tell you  
How to tell me why
