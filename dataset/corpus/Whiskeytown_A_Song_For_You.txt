Oh my land is like a wild goose  
Wanders all around everywhere  
Trembles and it shakes til every tree is loose  
It rolls the meadows and it rolls the nails  
So take me down to your dance floor  
And I won't mind the people when they stare  
Paint a different color on your front door  
And tomorrow we will still be there  
Jesus built a ship to sing a song to  
It sails the rivers and it sails the tide  
Some of my friends don't know who they belong to  
Some can't get a single thing to work inside  
So take me down to your dance floor  
And I won't mind the people when they stare  
Paint a different color on your front door  
And tomorrow we will still be there  
I loved you darlin', and now I'm leaving  
And I can see the sorrow in your eyes  
I hope you know a lot more than you believe in  
I hope the sun don't hurt you when you cry  
So take me down to your dance floor  
And I won't mind the people when they stare  
Paint a different color on your front door  
And tomorrow we will still be there  
And tomorrow we will still be there
