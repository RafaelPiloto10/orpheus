Take my advice  
Don't listen to me  
It ain't paradise  
But it used to be  
There was a time  
When the river was wide  
And the water came running down  
To the rising tide  
But the wooden ships  
Were just a hippie dream  
Just a hippie dream.  
  
Don't bat an eye  
Don't waste a word  
Don't mention nothin'  
That could go unheard  
'Cause the tie-dye sails  
Are the screamin' sheets  
And the dusty trail  
Leads to blood in the streets  
And the wooden ships  
Are a hippie dream  
Capsized in excess  
If you know what I mean.  
  
Just because it's over for you  
Don't mean it's over for me  
It's a victory for the heart  
Every time the music starts  
So please don't kill the machine  
Don't kill the machine  
Don't kill the machine.  
  
Another flower child goes to seed  
In an ether-filled room of meat-hooks  
It's so ugly  
So ugly.
