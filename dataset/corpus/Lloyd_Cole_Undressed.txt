You look so good when you're depressed  
Better even in your current state of undress  
Tears caressing me like rain  
And I'm not even thinking, I feel fine in your pain  
The coolest thing I ever saw  
You were sitting there smoking my cigarettes  
You were naked on the bare stone floor  
You looked at me to say don't guess  
I was only watching, yes I love you more undressed  
Is it really such a sin?  
Should I feel some kind of shame?  
Will I truly go to hell?  
Oh you never lock the bathroom door  
Should I be embarrassed when I've seen a hundred times before  
How do married couples cope  
Should I say excuse me darling, I don't know  
We could disconnect the telephone  
Just sit around and mess around  
And tell your ma we went to rome, tennessee  
And I'm not even drinking, I feel fine, it's scary  
Is it really such a sin?  
Should I feel some kind of shame?  
Will I truly go to hell?  
Oh well  
The coolest thing I ever saw  
You were sitting there smoking my cigarettes  
You were naked on the bare stone floor  
You looked at me to say don't guess  
I was only watching, is it bad that I should love you best  
Undressed
