You've got your secrets, girl I've got mine  
We're fallin' apart one glance at a time  
Night after night, actin' like strangers  
Out of emotion, nothing to say  
I brush your shoulder but you turn away  
Nobody tries, nobody's changin'  
Who'll be the first to say it's really the end  
Who's gonna walk out the door  
How did we let it get so out of control  
Our hearts can't take anymore  
  
Then we remember how much we love each other  
Pick the pieces up for one more try  
Then we remember how much we need each other  
Do we really want to say goodbye  
  
One night of passion won't stop the pain  
Back to the same old feelin' again  
Time after time, is it worth savin'  
Who'll be the first to say it's really the end  
Who's gonna walk out the door  
How did we let it get so out of control  
Our hearts can't take anymore  
  
Then we remember how much we love each other  
Pick the pieces up for one more try  
Then we remember how much we need each other  
Do we really want to say goodbye  
  
Then we remember how much we love each other  
Pick the pieces up for one more try  
Then we remember how much we need each other  
Do we really want to say goodbye  
  
Then we remember how much we love each other  
Pick the pieces up for one more try  
Then we remember how much we need each other  
Do we really want to say goodbye  
  
Then we remember how much we love each other  
Pick the pieces up for one more try  
Then we remember how much we need each other  
Do we really want to say goodbye
