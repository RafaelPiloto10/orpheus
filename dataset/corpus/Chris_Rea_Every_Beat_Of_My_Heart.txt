The daylight breaks, a picture show of endless takes  
And the music's coming through on the radio  
And I take my place, reluctantly I join the race  
It's not my fight, just trying to stay on my feet  
But oh there's one thing that gets to me  
It's that little girl she puts me down so easily  
In total absurd I'm saying these words  
  
With every beat of my heart, I will love you  
With every song, with every breath that you take  
I'll give you the moon and the sun, you're the only one  
Pleading love with every beat of my heart  
  
With every beat of my heart, I will love you  
With every song, with every breath that you take  
I'll give you the moon and the sun, you're the only one  
Pleading love with every beat of my heart  
Pleading love with every beat of my heart
