In the bright red sky  
In the heat of an evening  
When only prisoners sleep  
She said she couldn't  
Come to the garden  
See an old man wheel  
  
She said her dreams  
What too far to be thought of  
As scars too white to view  
She said she couldn't  
Come to the garden  
See a blind man kneel  
  
She sailed away  
To a blue horizon  
In floating thoughts she'd sway  
She said she couldn't  
Come to the garden  
See an old man pray  
  
She wished them luck  
As they left on their journey  
Maybe she'd join them soon  
But she lost her grip  
At the tip of life's finger  
Went home and worshiped the moon
