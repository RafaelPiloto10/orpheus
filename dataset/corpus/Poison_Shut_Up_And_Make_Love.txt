Drop the bass  
Drop the bass  
Drop the bass  
Drop the bass  
  
Shipped out on of knees  
Her old man thinks you're a social disease  
Dog pissed on the floor left a stain  
Your old lady's daddy driving you insane  
She stopped taking the pill  
Then left you sued you for a mil  
You've got your problems, boy so damn great  
  
(Ha Ha Ha, How do they do that?  
  
Can't find a good wife can't find a good job  
Can't find the keys to my car  
I lost my dog I lost my brain  
I lost my girl to a big movie star (whatever)  
  
Now I'm standing at the crossroads trying to find my way home  
But the truth is baby I'm so  
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely  
Sometimes I'd just  
  
Chorus:  
Like to jump in and get me some funky  
When push comes to shove  
You talk too much and way too rough  
How 'bout we both shut up and let's make love  
  
I'm home hangin', the walls are bangin'  
It's the neighbors next door  
They're talking trashy or doing the nasty  
They keep me up until four  
  
So they keep on going more and more  
I hear and said "Lord, I'm half crazy"  
I gotta get me some of that  
In and out, and in and out,and in and out  
  
Chorus  
  
When the clothes start flying  
There's no denying  
Gonna get some funky  
Good, good funky  
  
Your blood starts pumpin'  
Baby start somethin'  
Here oh right here, right here baby  
Oh give me a little bit of loving  
  
Solo  
  
It's all so simple  
I'll bring the ripple  
When she stayed all night  
  
How 'bout we drink, get drunk  
  
  
Chorus  
  
Alt Chorus  
  
When push comes to shove  
Skip your lip and all the politics  
How 'bout we both shut up and let's make love  
  
It would sound like this....  
Boom, boom, ha, ha, boom, boom, ha, ha  
Stop!  
Aight!
