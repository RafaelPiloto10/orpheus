I can tell that you don't feel good  
I guess you're not alone.  
Now that you packed your things  
And you're ready to go  
Let's do something tonight I don't know.  
We can take a ride across town  
Come on, baby, get your clothes on.  
All night long, we'll be so high  
That's the way we'll say goodbye.  
What's the name of the old cafe  
Where we used to go?  
It could be good to go there now  
But I don't want to be unhappy today.  
We can take a ride across town  
Come on, baby, get your clothes on.  
All night long, we'll be so high  
That's the way we'll say goodbye.
