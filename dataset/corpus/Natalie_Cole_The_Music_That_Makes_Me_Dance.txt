I add two and two, the most simple addition  
Then swear that the figures are lying  
I'm a much better comic, then mathematician  
'Cause I'm better on stage than at intermission  
  
And as far as the man is concerned  
If I've been burned, well I haven't learn  
I know he's around when the sky and the ground starting ringing  
I know that he's near by the thunder I hear in advance  
  
His words and his words alone  
Are the words that can start me heart singing  
And his is the only music that makes me dance  
He'll sleep and he lies in the light of two eyes  
That adore him  
  
Oh bore him it might, but he won't leave me sight  
For a glance  
In every way every single day  
I need less of myself I need more him, more him  
And his is the only music that makes dance  
Yes his is the only music that makes dance
