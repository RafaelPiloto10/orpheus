Chocolate Rain!  
Some stay dry and others feel the pain  
Chocolate Rain!  
A baby born will die before the sin  
Chocolate Rain!  
The school books say it can't be here again.  
Chocolate Rain!  
The prisons make you wonder where it went  
Chocolate Rain!  
Build a tent and something in your sink  
Chocolate Rain!  
A baby born will never cry again  
Chocolate Rain!  
Only in the [?] was they say  
Chocolate Rain!  
Raise your neighborhood insurance rates  
Chocolate Rain!  
Make us happy living in a gay  
Chocolate Rain!  
Made me cross the street the other day  
Chocolate Rain!  
Made you turn your head the other way  
Chocolate Rain!  
Made you turn your head in history  
Chocolate Rain!  
I don't know the words but again  
Chocolate Rain!  
Seldom mentioned on the radio  
Chocolate Rain!  
It's the failure leader's call control  
Chocolate Rain!  
Worse than swearing worse than calling names  
Chocolate Rain!  
Then they say it publicly and say  
Chocolate Rain!  
No one wants to hear about it now  
Chocolate Rain!  
Orlando Bloom was good in that one movie  
Chocolate Rain!  
Makes best friends begin to fight and stuff  
Chocolate Rain!  
Worse than swearing worse than calling names  
Chocolate Rain!

Chocolate Rain!  
Yea! That's why I come here  
Chocolate Rain!  
Stays behind as colors celebrate  
Chocolate Rain!  
Get your cute ass to the gay parade  
Chocolate Rain!  
The same crime has a higher price to pay  
Chocolate Rain!  
There's no parking places in Grand Street  
Chocolate Rain!  
The judge and jury swear its not [?]  
Chocolate Rain!  
I got tin foil on my spokes again  
Chocolate Rain!  
Well I'm in another state and stuff  
Chocolate Rain!  
I don't have the lock for my bicycle  
Chocolate Rain!  
These scars on my...oh wait I'm reading the wrong song  
And behind my...  
Chocolate Rain!  
Chocolate Rain!  
Your Doing It fucking Wrong!
