Even though his times are hard  
You can hardly see it on his face  
Because of the smile  
People coming in from miles away  
To hear him sing and see him play  
So he can' t disappoint them now  
The room is full of smoke  
But he can see them dancing  
And he can see them crying  
It doesn' t bother him at all 'Cause he knows it' s only tears of joy  
  
[Chorus:]  
Let the band play on  
  
There' s a girl sitting by the corner there  
And she looks at him with her big brown eyes  
He smiles back and carries on playing  
It doesn' t bother him at all  
Somehow, it gives him some comfort  
Police came in halfway through the night  
With the good news  
Neighbors are complaining  
'Cause the music is so low low low low  
So turn it up, now  
  
[Chorus:]  
Let the band play on
