Just when the sun shines the brightest and the world looks all right again  
The clouds fill the skies you can't believe your eyes sometimes you just can't
win  
My love never meant much to you dear and to you I was always a friend  
Oh why did I fall you'd have no heart at all sometimes you just can't win  
[ ac.guitar ]  
I can't live like this any longer not knowing just where I stand  
I know I shouldn't care but sweetheart it don't seem fair  
Sometimes you just can't win  
And then when the sun shines the brightest...  
Yeah sometimes you just can't win
