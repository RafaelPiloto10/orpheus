The night  
Is like a lovely tune  
Beware  
My foolish heart  
How white  
The ever constant moon  
Take care  
My foolish heart  
There's a line between love and fascination  
That's hard to find on an moment such as this  
For they all have that very same sensation  
When you're lost in the magic of a kiss  
Your lips  
Are much too close to mine  
Beware  
My foolish heart  
But should  
Our eager lips combine  
Then let  
The fire start  
For this time it isn't fascination  
Or a dream that could fade and fall apart  
It's love  
This time it's love  
My foolish heart  
There's a line between love and fascination  
That's hard to find on an moment such as this  
For they all have that very same sensation  
When you're lost in the magic of a kiss  
Your lips  
Are much too close to mine  
Beware  
My foolish heart  
But should  
Our eager lips combine  
Then let  
The fire start  
For this time it isn't fascination  
Or a dream that could fade and fall apart  
It's love  
This time it's love  
My foolish heart
