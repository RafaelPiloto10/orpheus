Nervous you need a drink  
Tired you need a lift  
You feel on the brink  
Maybe you need new tits  
  
Vulnerable as a ship  
But you re not on the sea  
Can you talk to anyone here?  
No, not really  
  
And the crowd stays on your back  
And the girls are all s0 stacked  
And the stress it lines your face  
And you really need a place  
  
Its just that social life  
Its got you on the run  
That goddamn social life  
It's torture dressed as fun  
It's just that social life  
They got you seeing things  
That goddamn social life  
And now you re chasing strings  
That goddamn social life  
  
God-awful art and clothes  
Plenty of money, though  
You guess it must be worth something  
What that would be you don' t know  
In your imagination  
There's a face of love  
  
Someone who will come along  
Instead of coming on  
  
Anp the forces ebb and flow  
And the money goes and goes  
And something makes you  
Want to throw a brick  
Through the window  
  
It's just that social life  
It's got you on the run  
That goddamn social life  
It's torture dressed as fun  
It's just that social life  
They got you chasing strings  
That goddamn social life  
And you are seeing things
