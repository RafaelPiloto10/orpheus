My Father's Song  
Words and music by Ray Boltz  
When I was just a little child  
We'd climb in this old family car  
And daddy would start to sing  
Before we rode very far  
I really don't remember  
If his songs were quite on key  
But that didn't matter to me  
It was my Father's song  
CHORUS:  
And he sings a song of love  
And a song of caring  
You sing it with your heart  
You sing it with your life  
And it's a song of giving  
Much more than you're asked  
And knowing that  
What you've done for Christ  
Is all that's going to last  
As I grew up I heard that song  
Time and time again  
A gentle word or a tender touch  
And that song would begin  
I can hear it in his laughter  
And it moves me more and more  
I can see it in his eyes  
When he talks about the Lord  
It's my Father's song  
And if I were the greatest musician  
Who ever walked upon a stage  
If I could sing any song I liked  
Any instrument I could play  
I wouldn't need a piano  
I wouldn't need a violin  
I'd choose a heart filled with his love  
And then I'd begin  
To sing my Father's song  
His song
