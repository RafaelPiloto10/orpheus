There were nights where I was sure  
I wouldn't see the morning sun  
And there were days that seemed so dark  
I couldn't wait for night to come  
  
I couldn't stand to think about how  
My life used to be  
And how without a single warning  
It all slipped away from me  
  
And like a fool I thought that I could fight  
The shadows on my own  
To the dark I was no stranger  
But this was stronger than I'd known  
  
And by the time I knew that I was in too deep  
I'd gone too far  
And the light that used to guide me  
Had faded from my heart  
  
And I found myself in places I thought I'd never go  
Surrounded by strangers I was so far from home  
And I don't know how you found me  
All I know is I owe you everything to you  
Yes I do  
  
[Chorus]  
And I thank you for my heart  
I thank you for my life  
And I thank god for grace and mercy  
And that you became my wife  
I'm seeing for the first time  
The stars, the sun and moon  
But they've got nothing on the power  
Of this love I have for you  
  
And I thank you, I thank you  
  
Now people say they'll stand beside you  
They swear they never leave  
But when the rain started falling  
You know it only fell on me  
  
and it was hard to keep believing in myself  
When all I felt was so much pain  
And guilt and shame  
I couldn't even as for help  
  
I don't know if I believe in other lives  
But when you came  
There was something so familar  
About the way you said my name  
  
And the whole world started turning  
And I swear that I'd been born again brand new  
And it's all because of you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I thank you  
  
And I've seen so many things  
That I just can't explain  
But the miracle of miracles is how  
With your love I was saved  
  
And I thank you for my heart  
I thank you for my life  
I thank god for grace and mercy  
And that you became my wife  
And I'm seeing for the first time  
The stars, the sun and moon  
But they've got nothing on the power  
Of all this love I give to you  
  
And I thank you for my heart  
I thank you for my life  
I thank god for grace and mercy  
And that you became my wife  
The day I started breathing  
Was the day you took my hand  
And 'till the day I die  
Baby, I'll forever be your man  
And I thank you, I thank you  
Oh, yes I do  
Oh, don't you know, that I thank you  
Oh
