When I was boy  
There's a dream that I had  
That a war if was fought  
Was for good against bad  
And I woke up to find  
That the world had gone mad  
  
And we'd all fall down  
  
And I feel like a child again  
Sitting or turning  
You're toying with power  
Your fingers are burning  
You're pushing so hard  
That the worlds won't be turning  
  
We'll all fall down  
  
When you try to pretend  
That you're a god upon high  
With your party ideals  
And your squeaky clean lies  
When it comes to the crunch  
You're no smarter than I  
  
And we'll all fall down  
  
If it's colour of creed or all time religion  
Well fighting for that shows  
A pure lack of vision  
The fight that we strive  
Is a fight to survive  
  
And we'll all fall down  
  
Well look in the mirror  
And what do you see  
An American, Russian  
A soldier or me  
When you all press the buttons  
Just where will you be?  
  
When we all fall down
