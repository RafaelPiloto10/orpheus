I'm waiting here in patience  
Am I waiting all in vain?  
Will I see you? will I touch you?  
Will I hear you call my name?  
Come and make  
Ten steps to every one step that I take  
  
Nobody comes and nobody goes,  
No one is happy, and no one has woes.  
Everything lasting, ever the same,  
Nothing is ending, nothing can change.  
  
The good lord always has been,  
Always will be ever the same.  
And confusion mixed with illusion  
All years only turn again  
With one and one hundred names  
Had all the rooms, our key is to change.  
  
Nobody comes and nobody goes,  
No one is happy and no one has woes,  
Everything lasting, nothing can change,  
Nothing is ending, ever the same
