Two highways lay before me, which one will I choose  
Down one lane I'd find happiness and down the other I would lose  
There is no one that I can trust, I must decide alone  
My decision is an awful one, which road will take me home  
  
In the mornin' would I wake to find, down the wrong road I have gone  
Will I hear the melodies I've searched for oh so long  
Only time will tell if I have made a loser's choice  
And though sadness cries my inner soul, goodbye lover moans my voice  
  
Perils, there are many, as I set out on my way  
If I lose your love I know that I can call it back someday  
Rambler, lonely rambler, just 'cause anyplace is home  
Nashville, lights how you have always shined  
  
Wishing now that you had found a word or two to say  
But the mornin' came and we both knew my eyes gave it away  
As I kissed your cheeks and said goodbye I thought only time will tell  
And you can't draw water from an empty well  
  
In the mornin' would I wake to find, down the wrong road I have gone  
Will I hear the melodies I've searched for oh so long  
Only time will tell if I have made a loser's choice  
And though sadness cries my inner soul, goodbye lover moans my voice
