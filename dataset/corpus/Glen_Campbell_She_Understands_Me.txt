She understands me and she cares how I feel  
Cause she's always there to hold my hand  
Somehow she knows it when this old world's got me down  
Yes she understands her man  
We've seen the rain and the sunshine together  
Many times she's watched me stumble and fall  
And she's always there by my side when I need her  
Through the good through the bad through it all  
And though how it hurts me when her dreams don't come true  
When I can't give her all the things I planned  
But Lord it ain't easy and she knows that's light  
Thank God for my woman she understands
