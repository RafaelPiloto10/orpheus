Sometimes it seems like a beautiful dream  
The girl from the wadi hammamat  
Lovely as a green parakeet  
I awake alone again  
In the desert of my dreams  
A fertile oasis i have seen  
  
I cast my voice to the burning winds  
Across the dunes khamsin khamsin  
Bring her to me on desire's wings  
On the burning desert wind  
  
She means the world to me  
In a single grain of sand  
Bring a camel to this man  
Perched on a bough her tresses hang down  
The girl from the wadi hammamat  
She is as sweet as a green parakeet  
  
Sometimes it seems like a beautiful dream  
The girl from the wadi hammamat
