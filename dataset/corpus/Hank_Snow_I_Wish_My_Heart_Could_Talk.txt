I wish my heart could talk to you like I do every night  
When we're apart you know it's true I love you every night  
You'd come running back and never leave me feelin' blue  
If my heart (if my heart) could talk (heart could talk)  
To you (heart could talk to you)  
  
Ya know, honey, whenever you're close enough to me  
To reach out and kiss my fingertips  
Then what I'm really feelin' deep down in my heart  
Always fails to leave my lips  
'Cause I plan on all the things that my heart wants to say  
And then I think I'm all set for the next time I see you walk my way  
But it just seems that every time you do I only make a standing start  
And then, darlin, you're gone, yes, you're gone again  
Before these words can ever leave my heart  
  
If my heart could talk to you, you'd never go away  
If my heart could talk to you, forever you would stay  
You'd come running back and never leave me feelin' blue  
If my heart (if my heart) could talk (heart could talk)  
To you (if my heart could talk to you)
