Of the darkness in men's minds  
What can you say  
That wasn't marked by history  
Or the T.V. news today  
He gets away with murder  
The blizzards come and go  
The stab and glare and buckshot  
Of the heavy heavy snow  
It comes and goes  
It comes and goes  
  
His grandpa loved an empire  
His sister loved a thief  
And lindsey loved the ways of darkness  
Beyond belief  
Girls in chilly blouses  
The blizzards come and go  
The stab and glare and buckshot  
Of the heavy heavy snow  
It comes and goes  
It comes and goes  
  
The cops don't seem to care  
For derelicts or ladies of the night  
They're weeds for yanking out of sight  
If you're smart or rich or lucky  
Maybe you'll beat the laws of man  
But the inner laws of spirit  
And the outer laws of nature  
No man can  
No, no man can  
  
There lives a wolf in Lindsey  
That raids and runs  
Through the hills of Hollywood  
And the downtown slums  
He gets away with murder  
The blizzards come and go  
The stab and glare and buckshot  
Of the heavy heavy snow  
It comes and goes  
It comes and goes
