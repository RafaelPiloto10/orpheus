Christmas time is here again  
Santa needs a helping hand  
We cannot find his evil sheet  
To draw his laying for the night  
So all the waiting Christmas trees  
Gonna hear their master sing  
  
There's no presents, not this Christmas  
There's no presents  
Tom and Jerry, drinking sherry  
They don't give a damn  
  
Christmas time is here again  
Santa needs a helping hand  
It's getting very, very late  
St.Peter's crossed the Golden Gate  
And Donald Duck is still in bed  
I wonder who he's gonna help  
  
There's no presents, not this Christmas  
There's no presents  
Tom and Jerry, all done sherry  
They don't give a damn  
  
There's no presents, not this Christmas  
There's no presents  
Tom and Jerry, still drinking sherry  
They don't give a damn  
  
I'm dreaming of a white, Sabbath
