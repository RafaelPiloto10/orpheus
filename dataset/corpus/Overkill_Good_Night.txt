Hey man, what's it gonna be?  
Indecision is killing me  
Hey now, turn around  
as you're clawing at the ground  
It's about to get away  
Living in America  
Got the mass hysteria  
Burning on the right  
As you're putting up a fight  
And it's just the price to pay  
For another perfect day  
  
Show me a good thing, give me the time  
Burn on the left wing, scene of the crime  
no need begging give me all your money  
There's a flat dope fee if all ya want is honey  
Show me a good thing, got no more time  
  
hey man, it's a wild thing  
Getting what you're going to bring  
Hey now, let it out  
As it covers up the doubt  
And you keep the dogs at bay  
Living in the perfect dream  
Riding on the laser beam  
Tuck 'em in at night  
Get a sweet dream bite  
And that's just the way it goes  
The whole thing fucking blows  
  
Here we come and there they go, in the ever fading light  
There's a nightmare waiting, don't you know, it's time to say good night  
And all the sweet dreams tucked away, the devil out to fight  
There's a nightmare waiting, don't you know, it's time to say good night  
Good night kiss  
  
Good night
