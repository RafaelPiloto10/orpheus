Don't you know you better watch this man,  
Better look him in the eye  
See if he returns your look or if he  
Tries to stay a little shy  
Maybe soon you'll get involved again  
Better best beware  
You may expose this man for what he is,  
And prove he just doesn't care  
  
And I believe in the things that I said  
And the prosecution rests  
But if you're gonna try and defend this man  
I said you better do your doggone best  
  
He's been consistent for quite a few years  
Said he always acts the same  
Check the record of the things that he's done  
And you'll know the nature of his game
