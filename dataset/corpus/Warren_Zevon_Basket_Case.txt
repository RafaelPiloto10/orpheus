My baby is a basket case  
A bipolar mama in leather and lace  
Face like an angel, she's a perfect waste  
My baby is a basket case  
  
Dracula's daughter, Calamity Jane  
Smoke on the water, water on the brain  
She's pretty as a picture, and totally crazed  
My baby is a basket case  
  
She's gonna make a madman outta me  
She's gonna make a madman outta me  
  
She's manic-depressive and schizoid, too  
The friskiest psycho that I ever knew  
We're paranoid lovers lost in space  
My baby is a basket case  
  
My baby's gonna celebrate  
I'm being dragged through the nuthouse gates  
Got my straitjacket on and I'm taking her place  
My baby is a basket case  
  
She finally made a madman outta me  
She finally made a madman outta me  
My baby made a madman outta me  
She finally made a madman outta me
