All the people had their share of the glory  
Looking out after you  
It's just a story about winners and glory  
And you know that it's true  
  
Ah ha, oh yeah, you're just a shooting star  
Ah ha, oh yeah, you're just a shooting star  
  
Some men may glory from a different condition  
Of another car  
And later persuasion would permit the arranging  
Of a ...  
And to cause more confusion, and to make this illusion  
Would have gone too far  
And it's my ambition, of a jacket ignition  
In a cadillac metal car  
  
Ah ha, oh yeah, you're just a shooting star  
Ah ha, oh yeah, you're just a shooting star  
Ah ha, oh yeah, you're just a shooting star  
Ah ha, oh yeah, you're just a shooting star  
  
You're just a shooting star
