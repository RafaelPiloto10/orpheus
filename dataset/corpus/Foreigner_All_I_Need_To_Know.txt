So I walk another mile down this crooked road  
Clouds rolling in Lord it's getting cold  
Feeling fine  
Feel lost feeling blue tonight  
But my only friend is Mr. Moonlight  
Then I see you girl lost in your book of poems  
You're in another world  
I should leave you alone  
My heart races on I try and hold it back  
  
But like a runaway train I'm about to jump the tracks  
Now you say you need a friend  
I swear to you if that's what you need  
That's what I'll be  
But I hope this never ends  
I feel there's something more the way  
You look at me  
  
And that's all I need to know  
I won't question why, don't need a reason  
We can take our time we can take it real slow  
When I see it in your eyes  
That's all I need to know  
  
Now we're talking 'bout angels that have lost their wings  
This melancholy world and the nature of things  
But then there's only silence when your eyes meet mine  
  
Reciting from your black book you were like some wounded bird  
I tried to catch your heart as it fell between your words  
You tore out one page and let it blow away  
Then you disappeared into your world  
It's a place I just can't stay  
  
You say you need a friend  
I swear to you if that's what you need  
That's what I'll be  
But I hope this never ends  
I feel there's something more the way  
You look at me  
  
And that's all I need to know  
I won't question why, don't need a reason  
We can take our time we can take it real slow  
When I see it in your eyes  
That's all I need to know  
  
All I need to know  
I won't question why, don't need a reason  
We can take our time we can take it real slow  
When I see it in your eyes  
That's all I need to know
