I never been too good at doin right  
Done mostly wrong, most all my life  
Never found a place to settle down  
But baby I do believe I found it now  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm gonna walk that line  
Gonna tote that barge  
Gonna lift that bale  
Gonna work real hard  
Doin anything that you want me to  
'cause baby I'm gonna walk that line for you  
  
Ooooh gonna walk that line for you.....  
  
If strait an' narrow ever was my path,  
And everlasting love never seemed to last,  
Used to be a tomcat out on the prowl  
But baby I'm just your puppy dawg now  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Ooooh gonna walk that line for you...  
Ooooh gonna walk that line for you...  
Do anything that you want me to...  
Ooooh gonna walk that line for you.....
