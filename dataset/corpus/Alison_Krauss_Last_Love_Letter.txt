I'm writing my last love letter  
And for reasons now, I don't know where to start  
Seems so many times I've written down "I love you"  
Well I hope this time I can get that through your heart  
Only fools will go on and keep talkin' to a wall  
But I can't fool around forever  
And if stone is the wall that you've built around your heart  
Then I guess it's goodbye in this letter  
And maybe I was wrong to ever think that you could love me  
I was hoping you just couldn't find the time  
Have my efforts been in vain with pen and paper?  
Did you ever care, did I ever cross your mind?  
Only fools will go on and keep talkin' to a wall  
But I can't fool around forever  
And if stone is the wall that you've built around your heart  
Then I guess it's goodbye in this letter  
In this letter  
In this letter
