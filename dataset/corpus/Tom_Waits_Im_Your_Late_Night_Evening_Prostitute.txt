[Chorus:]  
Well I got here at eight and I'll be here till two  
I'll try my best to entertain you and  
Please don't mind me if I get a bit crude  
I'm your late night evening prostitute  
  
So drink your martinis and stare at the moon  
Don't mind me I'll continue to croon  
Don't mind me if I get a bit loon  
I'm your late night evening prostitute  
  
And dance, have a good time  
I'll continue to shine  
Yes Dance, have a good time  
Don't mind me if I slip upon a rhyme  
  
[Chorus]  
Well I got here at eight and I'll be here till two  
I'll try my best to entertain you and  
Please don't mind me if I get a bit crude  
I'm your late night evening prostitute [Repeat: x2]
