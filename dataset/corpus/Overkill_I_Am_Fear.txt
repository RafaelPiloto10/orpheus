You point that little finger out  
You got four pointing back at you  
It goes everywhere you go  
Does everything you do  
  
He got roughed up on the inside  
Screaming that this ain't fair  
And in a blocked moment alone on the inside  
Thought that no one cared  
You want me, you need me, you have me, I'm yours  
  
So he puts in a call to his only friend  
He dials 1-800-FEAR  
Then he hid his face inside his hands  
You know he wasn't very clear  
Said I'm roughed up on the inside  
You know that this ain't fair  
And in a new york minute, he felt like a million  
Cause he knew somebody cared and said  
I have but a nation in me for everyone to see  
I am but a tribute to mediocrity  
I'm your mother, father, brother, son  
I'm a little bit of everyone  
Hide in the shadow cast by the sun  
In constant misery, I'm fear  
You want me,you need me, you have me, I'm yours  
  
Yes I know you've always loved me  
Call me now, between the tears  
I know you put no one above me  
Call me now, between the tears  
I'm fear  
  
Call me now uncover me  
Watch me work, it's what I do  
Call me now uncover me  
Watch me work, and watch what I undo  
  
So he broken-up all his fingers  
While pulling out his hair  
And he broke into a million pieces  
No, nobody cared  
He was beat-up on the inside  
Fighting ' to survive  
Spent a long time dyin' no not for tryin'  
When you want to feel alive  
Seem like total chaos everywhere you turn  
  
When you're wiped out on the inside  
You can't catch your breath  
And in a black out moment  
Alone on the outside, beat him right to dead  
You want me,you need me, you have me, I'm yours  
  
Yes I know you've always loved me  
Call me now, between the tears  
I know you put no one above me  
Call me now, between the tears  
I'm fear [Repeat x2]
