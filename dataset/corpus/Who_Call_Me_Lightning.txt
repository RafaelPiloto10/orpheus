See that girl who's smiling so brightly,  
Well I reckon she's cool and I reckon rightly,  
She's good looking and I ain't frightened,  
I'm gonna show you why they call me lightning.  
  
Hey little girl who's dancing so lightly,  
My XKE is shining so brightly,  
The noose around us is slowly tightening,  
I'm gonna show you why they call me lightning.  
  
Hey little girl who's dancing so lightly,  
My XKE is shining so brightly,  
The noose around us is slowly tightening,  
I'm gonna show you why they call me lightning.  
  
You can't catch me, I'm as fast as can be,  
Call me lightning, I'm as fast as can be,  
No you can't catch me, no you can't catch me.
