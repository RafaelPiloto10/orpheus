What you heard is true  
The disappointing truth  
Is I don't like to lose  
Shame on me, shame on me  
  
Promises I made  
And bills I never paid  
Another missed birthday  
Shame on me, shame on me  
  
Bridges that I burned  
And lovers that I hurt  
Lessons never learned  
Shame on me, shame on me  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey, I'm not tryin to be perfect  
Its not like its worth it  
Everyone hurts the same  
Hey, I'm not tryin to be special  
'Cause I ain't no angel  
Everyone hurts the same  
What a shame  
  
I repeat my words  
Sometimes they seem rehearsed  
And I speak out of turn  
Shame on me, shame on me  
  
Bridges that I burned  
And lovers that I hurt  
Lessons never learned  
Shame on me, shame on me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
That were hiding underneath our skin  
And were scared of letting somebody in  
Nobody showed us how to live  
Or how to be perfect  
Its not like its worth it  
  
[Chorus: x2]
