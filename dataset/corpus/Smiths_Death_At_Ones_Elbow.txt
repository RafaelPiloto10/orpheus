Oh Glenn  
Don't come to the house tonight  
Oh Glenn  
Oh Glenn  
Don't come to the house tonight  
Oh Glenn  
Because there's somebody here  
Who really really loves you  
Oh Glenn  
  
Stay home  
Be bored  
(It's crap, I know)  
Tonight  
  
Oh Glenn  
Oh Glenn  
Don't come to the house tonight  
Oh Glenn  
Oh Glenn  
Don't come to the house tonight  
Because there's somebody here  
Who'll take a hatchet to your ear  
The frustration it renders me  
Hateful, oh...  
  
Oh, don't come to the house tonight  
Oh, don't come to the house tonight  
Because you'll slip on the  
Trail of all my sad remains  
That's why, that's why  
Goodbye my love, goodbye my love  
Goodbye my love, goodbye my love  
Goodbye my love, goodbye my love  
  
Belch
