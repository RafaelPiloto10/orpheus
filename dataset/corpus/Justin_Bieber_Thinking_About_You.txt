A tornado flew around my room before you came  
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain  
In southern california, much like arizona  
My eyes don't she'd tears, girl, they bawl  
  
I've thinkin' 'bout you  
(Ooh, no, no, no)  
I've been thinkin' 'bout you  
(You know, know, know)  
I've been thinkin' 'bout you  
Do you think about me still?  
Do ya, do ya?  
  
Do you not think so far ahead?  
'Cause I been thinkin' about forever (oooh, oooh)  
  
Do you not think so far ahead?  
'Cause I been thinkin' about forever (oooh, oooh)  
  
(Jaden smith rap):  
I been thinking 'bout you and you know I do  
When I be thinking 'bout them kisses girl so are you  
Man I heard some things I don't know it's true  
But people say you really like me and I hope that's true  
You my baby girl and I hope you know it,  
A boy will tell you that he loves you but a man will show it  
That's why you in my arms  
Just for the day  
Coz let so much go by you be dancing away but let's just have some fun girl  
As long as your here coz when you get up on that plane you be gone for a year  
And when you come up in my room I'll be bawling some tears but people say just
live in the moment it's wrong to be scared girl is it wrong to be scared  
Coz that's what they say and every day that I don't see you, you slippin'
away,  
And all my teachers in my class thinkin' I'm crazy but they don't know that I
think about you daily coz I be  
  
Thinkin' 'bout you  
(Ooh, no, no, no)  
I've been thinkin' 'bout you  
(You know, know, know)  
I've been thinkin' 'bout you  
Do you think about me still?  
Do ya, do ya?  
  
Do you not think so far ahead?  
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (oooh, oooh)  
Do you not think so far ahead?  
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (oooh, oooh)  
  
(Justin bieber rap):  
Baby I could pick you up in the roll royce  
Anywhere you wanna go it's your choice  
Every time that I'm away girl I miss your voice  
And I promise that I'm nothing like them other boys  
I came from the bottom now  
I'm at the top tell you I love you every day and that I'll never stop  
They say it's true love well is love true  
Yeah I think it's love that's why I found you  
And a second that'll go by that don't think you are so fly  
And I know why ain't no guy gonna treat you like I wanna,  
Gonna be the man that treat you right  
Be the man to hold you tight  
You know I know you right  
Let's go into the night,  
  
[Chorus:]  
Thinkin' 'bout you  
(Ooh, no, no, no)  
I've been thinkin' 'bout you  
(You know, know, know)  
I've been thinkin' 'bout you  
Do you think about me still?  
Do ya, do ya?  
  
Do you not think so far ahead?  
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (oooh, oooh)  
Do you not think so far ahead?  
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (oooh, oooh)
