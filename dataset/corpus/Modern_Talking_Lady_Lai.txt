Stay, I want to be your man  
Please, stay  
You need a helping hand  
Tonight I'm falling in love  
Stay, I love your Chinese eyes  
Please, stay  
'Cause you're a big surprise  
Tonight, I'm fallin' in love in love  
  
Oh, Lady Lai  
The time when you touched me  
I love you till eternity  
Oh ever I'll be your loving guide  
Be here tonight  
Oh, Lady Lai  
Oh, please come stay with me  
By the light of the magical moon  
Later or soon, I'll be your guide  
Be here tonight  
  
Hey, you're like a butterfly  
Oh stay, oh give my love a try  
Tonight, I'm fallin' in love  
Stay, I want to be your man  
I feel, I'll never feel again  
Tonight, I'm fallin' in love in love
