The streets were deserted though the police were alerted  
They considered the phone call a hoax  
Furtively glancing the jauntily prancing  
The youth caught the guards unaware  
  
Slipping between them he ought to have seen the  
The eyes and their owner so near  
With torch shining bright he strode on in the night  
Till he came to the room with the safe  
  
"Hello son, I hope you're having fun"  
"You've got it wrong Sir, I'm only the cleaner"  
With that he fired, the other saying as he died  
"You've done me wrong", it's the same old song forever  
  
Robbery, assault and battery  
The felon and his felony  
  
He picked up the diamonds and bundles of fivers  
He pushed them well down in his sack  
But the alarm had been sounded, he was completely surrounded  
  
But he had some more tricks up his sleeve  
  
"Come outside with your hands held high"  
"You'll not get me alive Sir, I promise you that Sir"  
With that he fired, the other saying as he died  
"You've done me wrong", it's the same old song forever  
  
Robbery, assault and battery  
The felon and his felony  
  
"He's leaving via the roof, the bastard's got away  
God always fights on the side of the bad man"  
  
"I've got clean away but I'll be back some day  
Just the combination will have changed  
Some day they'll catch me, to a chain they'll attach me  
But until that day I'll side the old crime wave  
  
If they try to hold me for trial  
I'll stay out of jail by paying my bail  
And after I'll go to the court of appeal saying  
"You've done me wrong", it's the same old song forever"
