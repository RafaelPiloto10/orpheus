Blue eyed dressed for every situation  
Moving through the doorway of a nation  
Pick me up and shake the doubt  
Baby I can't do without  
  
[Chorus:]  
Move out, don't mess around  
Move out, you bring me down  
Move out, how you get about  
Don't make a sound just move out  
  
I remember only for an hour  
Move right through me can you feel the power  
I don't know what's going on  
It scares me but it won't take long  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now he's in control he is my lover  
Nations stand against him he's your brother  
Been a long time, been a long time now  
I'll get to you somehow  
  
[Chorus]
