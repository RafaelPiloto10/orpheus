I know that I'm bonkers  
Stupidity conquers  
Forgive me I know not what I do  
The cunning behavior  
Takes up every acre  
Of emotional cage in the zoo  
You know how it goes  
The volcano blows  
Eruptions hold the duvet down  
The words on the lips  
The sticking out ribs  
As I try to push my weight around  
  
I'm sorry please witness  
This act of forgiveness  
It's all I can do for her to see  
That I was the sad case  
A mouse in the rat race  
Won't somebody pass me the cheese  
  
The size of her breasts  
Like woodpeckers nests  
Would comfort me on winter nights  
The brains in my pants  
Create milli amps  
Of pleasure with seconds of delight  
  
I'm bonkers believe me  
A Federico Fellini  
I'm swinging on the windmills of my mind  
Where I have been ground down  
I'm still walking down town  
I'm leaving all this madness behind  
  
Laid back on the couch  
With me the old slouch  
For an Oscar on the silent screen  
There's no time to waste  
As I fill my fat face  
With a pizza slice and custard cream  
  
I'm sorry I hurt you  
I'm bonkers believe me
