As I go travelling down lifes highway  
whatever course my fortunes may foretell  
I shall not go alone on my way  
for thou shall always be with me Rydell  
  
When I seek rest from worldly matters  
in palace or in hovel I may dwell  
and though my bed be silk or tatters  
my dreams shall always be of thee Rydell  
  
Through all the years, Rydell  
And tears, Rydell  
We give three cheers Rydell for thee  
  
Through everything Rydell  
We cling, Rydell  
And sing, Rydell to thee
