'Love can make you do things you never dreamed possible... '  
  
I got lost, couldn't find my way  
And I guess there's nothing more to say  
Love can make you blind, make you act so strange  
But I'm here and here I will stay  
  
So everyday I cry  
Yes everyday I fall  
Do you ever wonder why, why I love everything about you  
  
But everyday I say I'll try to make my heart be still  
'til then every way there is to cry, ourselves to sleep we will  
  
It picked me up, knocked me off my feet  
I've got no way to explain  
Still I love you, love you, love you but this fire inside  
Will never see the light of day  
  
So everyday goes by  
And everyday I fall  
It makes me wonder why,  
My life's worth nothing without you  
  
But everyday I say I'll try  
To make my heart be still  
Cause every way there is to cry,  
Ourselves to sleep, we will  
  
You'll never know, no, no, no, no, no  
You'll never know just how close we were  
You'll never know, no, no, no, no, no  
You'll never know  
No you'll never see  
  
The book closes and we try to forget  
But I know that things won't change  
How we feel, how life goes on  
And that seems so strange  
  
And so the light fades away  
Try, try, try as I may  
I can't stop thinking about you  
It seems my life's worth nothing without you  
  
But everyday I say I'll try  
To make my heart be still  
'til then every way there is to cry,  
Ourselves to sleep, we will  
  
Everyday, everyday you know I try so hard  
Everyday, everyday it gets a little harder
