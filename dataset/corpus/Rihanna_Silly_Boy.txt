You're callin' me more than ever now that we're done  
Took keys back to my place, we were having no fun  
But you're not ok, tellin' me you miss my face  
I remember when you would say you hate my ways  
  
I said I'm not coming back  
It seems you only want what you can't have  
That egos hurting  
You fooled me once but you can't have that ego turning  
Just too bad for you, that when you had me  
Didn't know what to do,  
Games over, you lose!  
  
Cause you had a good girl, good girl, girl  
That's a keeper, k-k-k-k-keeper  
You had a good girl, good girl but  
Didn't know how to treat her, t-t-t-t-treat her (treat her)  
So silly boy get out my face (my face)  
Don't you like the way regrets taste?  
So silly boy get out my hair (my hair)(get outta here)  
No, I don't want you no more (get outta here)  
  
Silly boy (silly boy)  
Why you acting silly boy?  
Silly boy boy (boy boy)  
Acting acting silly boy?  
  
You comin with those corny lines  
Can't live without me  
I'll get some flowers for the day that you are burried  
No, people make mistakes  
But I just think your ass is fake  
Only thing I want from you, is for you to (stay away)  
  
I said I'm not coming back  
It seems you only want what you can't have  
That ego's hurting  
Just too bad for you, that when you had me  
Didn't know what to do  
Game's over, You lose!
