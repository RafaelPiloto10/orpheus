Lying alone at night  
Listen to the rain that's falling down  
You're calling out your baby's name  
Ah but she just ain't around  
Sleep don't come at all  
You can't ease a troubled mind  
Yeah they call it love  
Ah but it's the heartbreak kind  
  
Rumors whispered low  
There's been talk around the town  
Phone don't ring no more  
Friends they say don't come around  
Suspicion running high  
But she says everything's just fine  
She tells you that it's love  
Ah but it's the heartbreak kind  
  
There's darkness all around  
As the evening shadows fall  
Time keeps dragging by  
But she ain't coming home at all  
You tell yourself she still cares  
But pretty soon you're gonna find  
You thought it was a lasting love  
Ah but it's the heartbreak kind  
You thought it was a lasting love  
Ah but it's the heartbreak kind
