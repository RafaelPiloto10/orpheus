In the Big Rock Candy Mountains  
There's a land that's fair and bright  
Where the handouts grow on bushes  
And you sleep out ev'ry night  
Where the boxcars are all empty  
And the sun shines ev'ry day  
Oh, I'm bound to go where there ain't no snow  
Where the rain don't fall and the wind don't blow  
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.  
  
Oh, the buzzin' of the bees in the peppermint trees  
'Round the soda water fountains  
Where the lemonade springs and the bluebird sings  
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains  
  
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains  
You never change your socks  
And little streams of lemonade  
Come a-tricklin' down the rocks  
The hobos there are friendly  
And their fires all burn bright  
There's a lake of stew and soda, too  
You can paddle all around 'em in a big canoe  
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.  
  
Oh, the buzzin' of the bees in the peppermint trees  
'Round the soda water fountains  
Where the lemonade springs and the bluebird sings  
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
