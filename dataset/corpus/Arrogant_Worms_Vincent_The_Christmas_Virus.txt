This year at Christmas, everybody's feeling funny  
No one's making joyful sounds  
Cranberry sauce ain't staying down  
The lineups at the bathroom are longer than at the mall  
Everybody's meeting Vincent  
The Christmas Virus  
Vincent the Christmas Virus  
He's the one that'll keep you up all night  
He's the festive parasite  
Vincent the Christmas Virus  
Vincent the Christmas Virus is resistant to penicillin  
Doesn't notice Aspirin  
Don't matter if you're fit and trim  
But Vincent's not immune to the effects of alcohol  
So get real drunk on Christmas Day  
Let's all toast to Vincent (Hooray!)
