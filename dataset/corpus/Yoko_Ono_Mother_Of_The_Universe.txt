Our mother who art of the universe,  
Hallow be thy name.  
Thy wisdom reign, thy will is done,  
As it is to be.  
  
You gave us life and protection,  
And see us through our confusion.  
Teach us love and freedom,  
As it is to be.  
  
For thy is our wisdom and power,  
Glory forever.  
For thy is our wisdom and power,  
Glory forever.  
  
For thy is our wisdom and power,  
Glory forever.  
For thy is our wisdom and power,  
Glory forever.  
For thy is our wisdom and power,  
Glory.
