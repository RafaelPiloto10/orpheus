Time is on my side, yes, it is  
Time is on my side, oh yes, it is  
'Cause I got the real love  
The kind that you need  
So you'll come runnin' back  
That you'll come runnin' back  
You'll come runnin' back to me  
  
Time is on my side, yes, it is  
Time is on my side, oh yes, it is, baby  
'Cause you always said  
That you want to be free  
But you'll come runnin' back  
You'll come runnin' back  
You'll come runnin' back to me, to me  
  
Go ahead, go ahead and lie to me, baby  
And do anything that you want to do  
And I told ya, ya know I told ya so many times before  
You're gonna come back, baby  
You're gonna come back  
Knockin' at my door  
  
Time is on my side, yes, it is  
Time is on my side, oh yes, it is  
'Cause I got the real love  
The kind that you need  
So you'll come runnin' back  
That you'll come runnin' back  
You'll come runnin' back to me, to me, to me  
  
Oh, time is on my side  
You know it is  
Time is on my side, yes, it is  
Time is on my side, yes, it is
