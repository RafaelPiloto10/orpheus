Speak to me  
Speak to me  
Speak to me  
Tell me all about the way you make me feel  
  
Speak to me  
Speak to me  
Tell me all the things I want to know  
And tell me all the places that you go  
  
Tell me all the nothings in your life  
Mix them with the somethings in your life  
But speak to me  
Yeah, speak to me  
  
?My name is Joy Friend.  
I'm thirty and I was born on the thirtieth of the second sixty.  
I work as an accountant and my dream job would be to be a pilot.  
This morning for breakfast I had half a grapefruit.  
My favourite part of myself is my eyes.  
My least favourite part of myself is, sometimes when alone,  
Perhaps late at night I like to read a dirty book.  
I watch Prisoner Cell Block H.  
My favourite animal?  
  
Speak to me  
Tell me all the things you really feel  
Speak to me  
Speak to me  
Speak to me  
Speak to me
