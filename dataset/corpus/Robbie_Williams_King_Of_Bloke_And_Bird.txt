What you do speaks so loud  
I cannot hear what you say  
Except for the occasional word  
Sulphates a sentimental sight it bothers me  
No longer king of bloke and bird  
  
All of my life  
Searching hard  
Down in the wires  
Of love  
  
Summer me now summer my life away  
Summon me onto another day  
  
A hand through the clouds keeps  
Knocking me down  
It's no less than I deserve  
They built museums I don't visit them  
I've made enough trouble of my own  
  
Into the night  
Searching hard  
Look for the light  
Of love  
  
Summer me now summer my life away  
Summon me on to another day  
  
Summer the evening, winter ways  
Are falling down again  
I sing from the chaos in my heart, my heart  
  
Then comes the evening that  
Makes life worth living  
Shoving the shoes out in the light  
She walks in, I can hear her
