I love you, Porgy  
Don't let him take me  
Don't let him handle me  
And drive me mad  
  
If you can keep me  
I want to stay with you forever  
And I'll be glad  
  
I love you, Porgy  
Don't let him take me  
Don't let him handle me  
With his hot hands  
  
If you can keep me  
I want to stay with you forever  
I like my man  
  
Someday I know he's coming  
Back to call me  
He's gonna handle me  
And hold me so  
  
It's going to be like dying, Porgy  
When he calls me  
But when he comes, I know  
I'll have to go
