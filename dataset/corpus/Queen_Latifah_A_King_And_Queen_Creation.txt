Let's start the show off sisters ago look alive  
The Queen Latifah the King of 45  
Bringing a mixture of pure flavor  
I make beats she rock rhymes so I gave a  
A sample sound the she added a compound  
Word this is for those who haven't heard  
A King and Queen combine minds and trample  
Those who oppose us here's an example  
  
It's time to run, the King and Queen is on the set  
The competition is petty and ready to step  
To the first one, go ahead, rehearse one  
I hope you don't know you sound like the worst one  
Rhymes are smoking, concentration can't be broken  
Queen Latifah's outspoken  
Use your imagination, picture this  
Any male or female rapper trying to diss  
Here for excitement and enticement  
With my competitors killed I go build with my enlightenment  
Teach the youth, feed the needy  
Confident descendant of Queen Nefertiti  
The mother of civilization will rise  
Like the cream and still build the strong foundation  
Secondary but necessary to reproduce  
Acknowledge the fact that I'm black and I don't lack  
Queen Latifah is giving you a piece of my mind  
A rhyme spoken by a feminine teacher  
Rhymes I do employ, no time for slimy toys  
I'm steady and stable and the label is Tommy Boy  
Backed by The Unit, produced by The King  
Perfection pressed with the style that we bring  
For the hip-hop patients, this is a King and Queen creation  
  
Technician, musical musician  
I'm stating the facts, strictly non-fiction  
In hip-hop, you wonder who's in trouble most  
Creativity, you get a double dose  
How can you stop me? No, I put you to a test  
The rhymes are Romeo (The beat's a Juliet)  
With topic blend, this makes me a hard one  
Persevere, I'm here, gets taught one  
Strength producer, I send you an ultimatum  
Hardcore worldwide is how I take 'em  
I rock, never hyperventilate  
Others get tired, could use a commercial break  
45 King, DJ Mark's my alias  
It takes a ton of M-C's to prevail against me  
Just listen, I'm unstoppable  
You want a mission? This one's impossible  
Beats rock all night with no curfew  
My talent's advanced, you haven't a clue  
How I do it, the smoothest loopest spare it  
If the style fits, I wear it  
Many attempts were made, none was recognized  
45 King said sample soundified  
I'm going to Wonderland to check, find out who's next  
You pretty good, but not quite a legend yet  
Studio mixer, I got the formula  
And said the man from self, I'm warning you  
It's my domain, just ask my chauffeur  
My ride's equipped everything from a pool to a sofa  
On top, it's a usual act  
Can't wait to get down to 45 Studios  
I'm into rap, but no urge to sing  
I'm DJ Mark, 45, 45 King of Swing
