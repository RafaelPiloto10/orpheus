Lay beside me  
Tell me what they've done  
Speak the words I wanna hear  
To make my demons run  
The door is locked now  
But it's open if you're true  
If you can understand the me  
Then I can understand the you  
  
Lay beside me  
Under wicked sky  
The black of day  
Dark of night  
We share this paralyze  
The door cracks open  
But there's no sun shining through  
Black heart scarring darker still  
But there's no sun shining through  
No, there's no sun shining through  
No, there's no sun shining  
  
What I've felt  
What I've known  
Turn the pages  
Turn the stone  
Behind the door  
Should I open it for you?  
  
Yeah  
What I've felt  
What I've known  
Sick and tired  
I stand alone  
Could you be there  
'cause I'm the one who waits for you  
Or are you unforgiven too?  
  
Come lay beside me  
This won't hurt, I swear  
She loves me not  
She loves me still  
But she'll never love again  
She lay beside me  
But she'll be there when I'm gone  
Black heart scarring darker still  
Yes, she'll be there when I'm gone  
Yes, she'll be there when I'm gone  
Dead sure she'll be there  
  
What I've felt  
What I've known  
Turn the pages  
Turn the stone  
Behind the door  
Should I open it for you?  
  
Yeah  
What I've felt  
What I've known  
Sick and tired  
I stand alone  
Could you be there  
'cause I'm the one who waits for you  
Or are you unforgiven too?  
  
Lay beside me  
Tell me what I've done  
The door is closed, so are your eyes  
But now I see the sun  
Now I see the sun  
Yes, now I see it  
  
What I've felt  
What I've known  
Turn the pages  
Turn the stone  
Behind the door  
Should I open it for you?  
  
Yeah  
What I've felt  
What I've known  
So sick and tired  
I stand alone  
Could you be there  
'cause I'm the one who waits  
The one who waits for you  
  
Oh  
What I've felt  
What I've known  
Turn the pages  
Turn the stone  
Behind the door  
Should I open it for you?  
So I dub thee unforgiven  
  
Oh, what I've felt  
Oh, what I've known  
I take this key  
And I bury it in you  
Because you're unforgiven too  
  
Never free  
Never me  
'cause you're unforgiven too
