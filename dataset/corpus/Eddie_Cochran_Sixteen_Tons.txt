Some people say a man is made outta mud  
A poor man's made outta muscle and blood  
Muscle and blood and skin and bones  
A mind that's weak and a back that's strong  
  
[Chorus]  
You load sixteen tons, what do you get?  
Another day older and deeper in debt  
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go  
I owe my soul to the company store  
  
I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine  
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine  
I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal  
And the straw boss said "Well, bless my soul"  
  
I was born one mornin', it was drizzlin' rain  
Fightin' and trouble are my middle name  
I was raised in the canebrake by an ol' mama lion  
And no high-toned woman make me walk the line  
  
If you see me comin', better step aside  
A lotta men didn't and a lotta men died  
One fist of iron, the other of steel  
If the right one don't get you then the left one will
