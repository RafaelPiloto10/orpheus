Well I'm on the Downeaster "Alexa"  
And I'm cruising through Block Island Sound,  
I have charted a course to the Vineyard  
But tonight I am Nantucket bound.  
We took on diesel back in Montauk yesterday  
Left this morning from the bell in Gardiners Bay,  
Like all the locals here I had to sell my home  
Too proud to leave I worked my fingers to the bone.  
So I could own my Downeaster "Alexa"  
And I go where the ocean is deep  
There are giants out there in the canyon  
And a good captain can't fall asleep.  
I got bills to pay and children who need clothes  
I know there's fish out there but God only knows,  
They say these waters aren't what they used to be  
But I got people back on land who count on me.  
So if you see my Downeaster "Alexa"  
And if you work with the rod and the reel,  
Tell my wife I am trolling Atlantis  
And I still have my hands on the wheel.  
Now I drive my Downeaster "Alexa"  
More and more miles from shore every year  
Since they told me I can't sell no stripers  
And there's no luck in swordfishing here  
I was a bayman like my father was before  
Can't make a living as a bayman anymore,  
There ain't much future for a man who works the sea  
But there ain't no island left for islanders like me.
