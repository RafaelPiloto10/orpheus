Oh, don't sell me out, only love.  
You don't get it so well.  
  
Please tell someone  
Everything is gone  
Dream less of me, less to guess on you  
I felt so much  
Every tick and tussle  
Heart torn because it's a kissin' time.  
  
So pass on by  
You'll never find out  
I love someone else  
Find your God  
You'll find yourself  
But, he falls  
I'm confessing to you  
Just my guess  
It's a kissin' time.  
  
He can't pass on you  
Oh no, I see far right through you.  
  
Please understand my kissin' song  
Think for yourself,  
It's a lesson, guess it's kissin' time.  
Heart torn because  
Parts of me I'd sell myself  
Oh, just in time I'm assessing myself.  
  
Someone told me  
Keep on, hold me  
Don't let go until I reach the other side.  
  
Your time will come  
Your time will come again  
Your time will come  
Your time will come again  
Your time will come  
Your time will come again  
Your time will come  
Your time will come again  
Your time will come  
Your time will come again  
Your time will come  
Your time will come again  
  
Someone told me, keep on hold me  
Don't let go until I reach the other side.  
  
Your time will come  
Your time will come  
Your time will come  
Your time will come  
  
Time  
Time  
Time
