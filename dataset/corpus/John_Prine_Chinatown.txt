Well, the moon is yellow and the people are too  
They roll eggs on a bar-be-que  
I was feeling kinda cocky with a head full of sake  
Down in chinatown  
There was dragons flyin' kites high above the stores  
Dead fish heads laying on the floor  
I got a sideways hickey from a slant-eyed chickie  
Down in chinatown  
And it was suddenly, was suddenly, whoa whoa  
Yeah, suddenly yeah, suddenly whoa whoa  
They smelled fish  
We smelled like a meat  
Sucking on a soda pop oh so sweet  
Got a sugar rush that'd would make 'em blush  
Down in chinatown  
Won ton two ton three ton four  
Smoke a cigarette throw it on the floor  
I killed the pie-faced mothey with a shoeshine clothy  
Down in chinatown  
It was suddenly, was suddenly, whoa whoa  
Yeah, suddenly, yeah, suddenly whoa whoa  
The moonie is yellowie and the people are too  
They roll eggs on a bar-be-que  
I was feeling kinda cocky with head full of saki  
Down in chinatown  
I got a sideways hickey from a slant-eyed chickie  
Down in chinatown  
Hey, down in chinatown  
Hey, down in chinatown
