In the midnight moon light hour  
I keep walking along that lonely mile  
And everytime I do  
I keep seeing this picture of you  
  
Chorus:  
Here comes my baby  
Here she comes now  
And it comes as no surprise to me  
With another guy  
Here comes my baby  
Here she comes now  
Walking with a love with a love that's oh so fine  
Never to be mine no matter how I try  
  
Oh you never walk alone  
And you're forever talking on the phone  
I try to call your name  
But everytime it comes out the same  
  
Chorus (x2)  
  
Here comes my baby  
Here she comes now (x4)
