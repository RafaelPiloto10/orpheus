America needs you  
Harry Truman  
Harry could you please come home  
Things are looking bad  
I know you would be mad  
To see what kind of men  
Prevail upon the land you love  
  
America's wondering  
How we got here  
Harry all we get is lies  
We're gettin' safer cars  
Rocket ships to mars  
From men who'd sell us out  
To get themselves a piece of power  
  
We'd love to hear you speak your mind  
In plain and simple ways  
Call a spade a spade  
Like you did back in the day  
You would play piano  
Each morning walk a mile  
Speak of what was going down  
Each honesty and style  
  
America's calling  
Harry Truman  
Harry you know what to do  
The world is turnin' round and losin' lots of ground  
Oh Harry is there something we can do to save the land we love  
Oh woah woah woah  
  
America's calling  
Harry Truman  
Harry you know what to do  
The world is turnin' round  
And losin' lots of ground  
So Harry is there something we can do to save the land we love  
Oh  
Harry is there something we can do to save the land we love  
Harry  
Harry is there something we can do to save the land we love
