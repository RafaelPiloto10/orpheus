Blue skies smiling at me  
Nothing but blue skies do I see  
Bluebirds singing a song  
Nothing but bluebirds all day long  
  
Never saw the sun shining so bright  
Never saw things going so right  
Noticing the days hurrying by  
When you're in love, my, how they fly  
  
Blue days, all of them gone  
Nothing but blue skies from now on  
(Blue skies smiling at me  
Nothing but blue skies do I see)  
  
Never saw the sun shining so bright  
Never saw things going so right  
Noticing the days hurrying by  
When you're in love, my, how they fly  
  
Blue days, all of them gone  
Nothing but blue skies from now on  
Nothing but blue skies from now on
