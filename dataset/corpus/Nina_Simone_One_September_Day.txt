Years, they will come and go.  
Sometimes the tears will flow.  
Some of my memories will fade,  
But I'll always remember that one September day.  
I used to reminisce  
'Cause I thought that love was bliss.  
How did they know it would go astray?  
It began, and it ended on one September day.  
We met by chance,  
As people often do,  
But it blossomed, yes, it blossomed  
Into something I never knew.  
Now... It is in the past.  
They said it would never last.  
I'll not forget the moment back,  
Nor hot May or December,  
Nor June or November,  
But one September day.
