Well the wind blows cold in New York City along about the middle of now  
And I'm telling you I'd be a happy man if I could get away somehow  
Cause I'm growing old before my time finally I see the light  
But if it costs a dime to get around the world I couldn't get out of sight  
But if I ever get back to Georgia there'll be no messin' around  
If I ever get back to Georgia I'm gonna nail my feet to the ground  
[ guitar ]  
Well the buildings here in New York City grow so doggone tall  
Sometimes you can walk for a couple of days and never see the sun at all  
So I left last night I was homeward bound now I wanna sit and I cry  
Cause I stuck out my thumb till my thumb got numb and the cars went right on
by  
But if I ever get back to Georgia...  
[ piano ]  
Well I guess my time in New York City hasn't been a total waste  
Cause I met a little girl from a social world and really put her in her place  
When she sold me half of the Brooklyn Bridge I hung around just for spite  
And I played this part till I won her heart and I bought the other half last
night  
But if I ever get back to Georgia...
