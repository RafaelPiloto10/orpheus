If you get up in the morning at a quarter to one  
And you want to have a little fun,  
You brush your teeth ch ch ch ch, ch ch ch ch  
  
If you get up in the morning at a quarter to two  
And you want to find something to do,  
You brush your teeth ch ch ch ch, ch ch ch ch  
  
If you get up in the morning at a quarter to three  
And you want to hum a tweedle dee dee,  
You brush your teeth ch ch ch ch, ch ch ch ch  
  
If you get up in the morning at a quarter to four  
And you think you hear a knock at the door,  
You brush your teeth ch ch ch ch, ch ch ch ch  
  
If you get up in the morning at a quarter to five  
And you just can't wait to come alive,  
You brush your teeth ch ch ch ch, ch ch ch ch
