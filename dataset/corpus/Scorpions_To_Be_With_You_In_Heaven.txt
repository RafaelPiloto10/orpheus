You can shoot me down  
You can drag me 'round  
Girl I'll get you  
It won't be long  
You can smash my heart  
You can trash our love  
But my desire for you is much too strong  
  
To be with in heaven  
I would go through the darkest hell  
In heaven  
There's no cure for love that kills  
  
You can waste my time  
But you can't change my mind  
I won't stop you  
So just go on  
You can play your games  
But it's all in vain  
'Cause my desire for you is much too strong  
  
To be with in heaven  
I would go through the darkest hell  
In heaven  
There's no cure for love that kills  
  
To be with in heaven  
I would go through the darkest hell  
In heaven  
There's no cure for love that kills  
  
Girl I'm on fire  
Heaven seems so close tonight  
Girl I would die for your love  
  
You can shoot me down  
You can drag me 'round  
Girl I'll get you  
It won't be long  
You can smash my heart  
You can trash our love  
But my desire for you is much too strong  
  
To be with in heaven  
I would go through the darkest hell  
In heaven  
There's no cure for love that kills  
  
To be with in heaven  
I would go through the darkest hell  
In heaven  
There's no cure for love that kills  
  
To be with in heaven  
I would go through the darkest hell  
In heaven  
There's no cure for love that kills...
