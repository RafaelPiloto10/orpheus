There is something I wanted to tell you,  
It's so funny you'll kill yourself laughing  
But then I, I look around,  
And I remember that I am alone,  
Alone.  
For evermore  
  
The tile yard all along the railings,  
Up a discolored dark brown staircase  
Here you'll find, despair and I,  
Calling to you with what's left of my heart,  
My heart,  
For evermore  
  
Drinking tea with the taste of the Thames,  
Sullenly on a chair on the pavement  
Here you'll find, my thoughts and I,  
And here is the very last plea from my heart  
My heart. For evermore,  
Where taxi drivers never stop talking  
Under slate grey Victorian sky,  
Here you will find, despair and I  
And here I am every last inch of me is yours,  
Yours,  
For evermore  
  
Your leg came to rest against mine,  
Then you lounged with knees up and apart  
And me and my heart, we knew,  
We just knew,  
For evermore  
  
Where taxi drivers never stop talking,  
Under slate grey Victorian sky  
Here you'll find, my heart and I,  
And still we say come back,  
Come back to Camden  
And I'll be good, I'll be good,  
I'll be good, I'll be good
