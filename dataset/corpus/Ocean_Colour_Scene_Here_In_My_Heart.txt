I feel a love that's so hard to bear  
Won't you come kiss me and take this despair  
Let the morning time dapple its light in your hair  
Like warm running water in snow  
  
But I feel a love of jealousy and pain  
Lost in the race 'tween the foolish and vain  
Come in the morning time whistle to take you away  
Where the sun always burns in the Winter  
  
Oh...Here in my Heart  
Oh...Here in my Heart  
  
And I know that all I'm saying is wrong  
Etched in the night - time and rhymed in a song  
Come tomorrow I'll lighten-up and drink to the ones  
Who love without asking for loving  
  
Don't forsake me  
The morning time plays at the children's door  
If you leave me  
Then what would I tell them you're leaving for?  
  
I feel a love that's so hard to bear  
Won't you come kiss me and take this despair  
Let the morning time dapple its light in your hair  
Like warm running water in snow
