Like a snowball rolling down that side  
Of that snow covered hill, man it's growing  
Like that size of the fish that man claimed  
He broke his reel, man it's growing  
  
Like the rosebud, that's bloomin' man  
In the warning of the sun, it's growin'  
Like a tale by the time it's been told, man  
By more then one, it's growing  
  
When every day it grows a little more  
Than it was the day before  
My love for you, it grows and grows  
Hey, hey, hey, how it grows and grows  
  
But when it's going to stop  
I feel that nobody knows, man  
I said, it grows and grows, man  
A little bit stronger  
  
It grows and grows  
A little bit more, every day  
It keeps on growing  
  
Like the need of a guy to see his girl  
When she's gone away, man it's growing  
Like the sadness in his heart  
When he knows that she's gone to stay, man it's growing  
  
I said, every day it grows and grows  
A little bit more  
Than it was before  
My love for you, it grows and grows, man  
Hey, hey, hey, how it grows and grows  
  
My heart is gonna stop, I feel, man  
My heart is gonna stop, I feel  
That nobody know man  
Hey, hey, hey, man  
  
Nobody know how it grows and grows  
Nobody knows it grows and grows  
Everyday it gets little bit stronger  
And every time it gets little bit stronger  
I'm there for you, just keep on growing
