Baby's Got Her Blue Jeans On  
Conway Twitty  
  
Down on the corner, by the traffic light,  
Everybody's lookin', as she goes by.  
They turn their heads and they watch her till she's gone.  
Lord have mercy, baby's got her blue jeans on.  
  
Up by the bus stop, and across the street,  
Open up their windows, to take a peek,  
As she goes walkin', rockin' like a rollin stone.  
Heaven help us, baby's got her blue jeans on  
  
She can't help it if she's made that way.  
She's not to blame if they look her way.  
She ain't really tryin' to cause a scene.  
It just comes naturally,  
No, the girl can't help it.  
  
Well up on main street, by the taxi stand  
There's a crowd of people, and a traffic jam.  
She don't look back, she ain't doin nothin' wrong  
Lord have mercy, baby's got her blue jeans on.  
  
She can't help it if she's made that way.  
She's not to blame if they look her way.  
She ain't really tryin' to cause a scene.  
It just comes naturally,  
No, the girl can't help it.  
  
Down on the corner, by the traffic light,  
Everybody's lookin', as she goes by,  
They turn their heads and they watch her till she's gone.  
Lord have mercy, baby's got her blue jeans on  
Heaven help us, baby's got her blue jeans on
