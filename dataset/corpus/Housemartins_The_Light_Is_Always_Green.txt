We dig our models with the brains the size of models  
And cars that we can trust with out wives  
And we dig converstations with girls from every nation  
But not the ones that whisper or tell lies  
Wherever there's a will there's a motorway  
Wherever there is greed there is speed  
And they've always got to be there for yesterday  
Welcome to the new scalextric's breed  
And the light they always show to them  
Is green, green, green  
And the heels they always show to me  
Are clean, clean, clean  
We're only flying past so we dig our sevice fast  
From the waiters to the women to the wine  
Never mind the match, I've an urgent date to catch  
Get me to the concert hall on time  
Pretending to be pilots in a war  
Pretending to weave between the flak  
No-one knows what the mission's for  
Blinkered horses on the track  
And the light they always show to them  
Is green, green, green  
And the heels they always show to me  
Are clean, clean, clean
