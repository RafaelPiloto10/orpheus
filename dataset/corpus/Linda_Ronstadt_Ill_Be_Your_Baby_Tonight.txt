Close your eyes, close the door  
You don't have to worry anymore  
I'll be your baby tonight  
Shut the light, shut the shade  
You don't have to be afraid  
I'll be your baby tonight  
Well, that mockingbird is gonna sail away  
We're gonna forget it  
Well, that big fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon  
But we're gonna let it, you won't regret it  
Kick your shoes off, do not fear  
Bring that bottle over here  
I'll be your baby tonight  
Well, that mockingbird is gonna sail away  
We're gonna forget it  
Well, that big fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon  
But we're gonna let it, you won't regret it  
Kick your shoes off, do not fear  
Bring that bottle over here  
I'll be your baby tonight
