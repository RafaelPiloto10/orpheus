I don't think you understand  
Oh the rhythm of my heart  
Theres a strong line to mind and soul  
I feel it tearing apart  
I've been searching for new words  
Gonna make you understand in a different way  
When I told you Id hang on forever  
I threw my choice away  
And its cold as ice  
I can't let go  
Its cold as ice  
Baby but I need your love  
  
And I wish I could have been the first one  
Oh to walk out the door  
The more I find myself to blame  
The less there is to come back for  
You wish you could have been the last one  
To tell me how you really feel  
Cause when you closed the door oh deep inside  
My heart it still seemed so sincere  
And its cold as ice  
I can't let go oh  
Its cold as ice  
Baby but I need your love  
  
Its cold as ice  
I can't let go  
Its cold as ice  
Baby but I need your love  
  
If theres a message to this madness  
Well it still seems quite unclear  
If I really need to save myself  
Why can't I just walk out of here  
Theres a message in your eyes  
And you make it perfectly plain  
Either I leave your heart behind  
Or crack beneath this freezing  
Freezing freezing freezing rain  
Cold as ice  
(cold as ice)  
I can't let go  
(but I can't let go)  
Cold as ice  
Baby but I  
But I need your love  
  
All right  
I said I'm cold  
Cold I'm cold  
(cold as ice)  
Cold I'm cold  
(baby)  
Cold I'm cold  
(cold as ice darling)  
Cold as ice  
(cold as ice)  
Oh no but I can't let go  
(I said I'm freezing, freezing)  
Oh no no I can't let go  
(freezing, freezing, freezing, freezing)  
No no I'm cold as ice  
(whoa whoa baby yeah)  
I'm cold as ice  
But I can't let go  
No
