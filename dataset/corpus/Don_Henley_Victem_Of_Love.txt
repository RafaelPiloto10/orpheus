What kind of love have you got?  
You should be home, but you're not  
A room full of noise and dangerous boys  
Still makes you thirsty and hot  
I heard about you and that man  
There's just one thing I don't understand  
You say he's a liar and he put out  
Your fire  
How come you still got his gun in your hand?  
Victim of love, I see a broken heart  
You got your stories to tell  
Victim of love, it's such an easy part  
And you know how to play it so well  
  
Some people never come clean  
I think you know what I mean  
You're walkin' the wire, pain and desire  
Looking for love in between  
  
Tell me your secrets, I'll tell you mine  
This ain't no time to be cool  
And tell all your girlfriends,  
You "been around the world" friends  
That talk is for losers and fools  
  
Victim of love, I see a broken heart  
I could be wrong, but I'm not  
Victim of love, we're not so far apart  
Show me, what kind of love have you got?  
  
Victim of love, you're just a victim of love  
I could be wrong, but I'm not  
Victim of love, now you're a victim of love  
What kind of love have you got?  
What kind of love have you got?  
What kind of love have you got?
