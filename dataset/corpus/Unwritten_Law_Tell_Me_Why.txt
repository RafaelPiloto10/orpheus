Hey mister god  
Can you tell me what's wrong  
With my life and all of it's confusions  
Why did she leave me  
With nothing to show  
Except fro a shallow disillusion  
Cause I can't seem to figure why you feel this way  
And I guess I'm to blame  
And if I told you that I didn't care about this place  
Would you think of me the same  
  
Could you please tell me why  
Could you please tell me why  
Could you please tell me why  
Why I can never find the answer to something I will never understand  
Could you please tell me why  
  
I sit back thinking that there once was a time  
A time where everything was perfect  
It seems the things we shared were so far behind  
Behind but we're never getting closer  
Cause I can feel your shadow hanging over me  
And I'm just peering through the light  
And now I realize you never really cared for me  
Will I ever see  
Could you please tell me why  
Could you please tell me why  
Could you please tell me why  
Why I can never find the person  
That I've tried so hard to find  
Could you please tell me why
