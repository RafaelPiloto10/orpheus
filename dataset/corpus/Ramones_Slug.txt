Lying in bed one summer's night  
Everything wasn't alright  
Something started crawling on me  
A S-L-L-you-G  
I saw her walking in the woods last night  
And I knew something wasn't right  
S-L-you-G  
A no no no no, why'd she have to go-oh-oh-oh?  
I saw her walking in the woods last night  
And I knew something wasn't right  
S-L-you-G  
A no no no no, why'd she have to go-oh-oh-oh?  
And I know that if I had her back today  
Yeah I know  
(I know)  
I know  
(I know)  
Why is it always this way?
