D.W. Washburn, I heard a sweet voice say.  
D.W. Washburn, this is your lucky day.  
A hot bowl of soup is waitin'.  
A hot bowl of soup and a shave.  
D.W. Washburn, we picked you to say.  
  
Can't you hear the bugle call? Can't you hear the bells?  
Even you can be reborn, you naughty  
If you don't get out of that gutter,  
before the next big rain.  
D.W. Wahsburn, you're gonna wash right down the drain.  
  
Up, up, come on get up off your street.  
If you can only make it from your hands to your knees,  
I know you can make it to your feet. Wooah!  
D.W. Washburn, I said to myself.  
D.W. Washburn, why don't you go save sombody else?  
  
Well, I got no job to go to.  
I don't work and I don't get paid.  
I got a bottle of wine, I'm feelin' fine.  
And I believe I got it made.  
  
I'd like to thank all you good people  
for comin' to my aid.  
But I'm D.W. Washburn.  
I do believe I got it made.  
  
I do believe I got it made, don't need nobody.  
I do believe I got it made, I do believe I got it made.
