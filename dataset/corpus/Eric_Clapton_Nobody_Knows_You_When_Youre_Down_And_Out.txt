Once I lived the life of a millionaire,  
Spent all my money, I just did not care.  
Took all my friends out for a good time,  
Bought bootleg whisky, champagne and wine.  
  
Then I began to fall so low,  
Lost all my good friends, I did not have nowhere to go.  
I get my hands on a dollar again,  
I'm gonna hang on to it till that eagle grins.  
  
'Cause no, no, nobody knows you  
When you're down and out.  
In your pocket, not one penny,  
And as for friends, you don't have any.  
  
When you finally get back up on your feet again,  
Everybody wants to be your old long-lost friend.  
Said it's mighty strange, without a doubt,  
Nobody knows you when you're down and out.  
  
When you finally get back upon your feet again,  
Everybody wants to be your good old long-lost friend.  
Said it's mighty strange,  
Nobody knows you,  
Nobody knows you,  
Nobody knows you when you're down and out.
