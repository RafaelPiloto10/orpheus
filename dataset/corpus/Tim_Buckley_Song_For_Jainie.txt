You've got the untortured mind of a woman  
Who has answered all the questions before  
You've got the free-givin' ways of a woman  
Who has kicked all the heartache out the door  
And Jainie, don't you know?  
Jainie, don't you know I been tryin'?  
Jainie, don't you know?  
Jainie, don't you know I been tryin'?  
I brought to you my tired plans and wearied faith to you  
And with a smile you took me in and showed me love again  
Now it has to be say goodbye or stay that I don't know  
But remember please I gave you love that's only mine to give  
And Jainie, don't you know?  
Jainie, don't you know I been tryin'?  
Jainie, don't you know?  
Jainie, don't you know I been tryin'?  
Yes, I truly love to be with you  
If I wasn't with the one that I'm with  
Yes, I truly love to lie by you  
If I didn't have to give what I give  
And Jainie, don't you know?  
Jainie, don't you know I been tryin'?  
Jainie, don't you know?  
Jainie, don't you know I been tryin'?  
I brought to you my tired plans and wearied faith to you  
And with a smile you took me in and showed me love again  
Now it has to be say goodbye or stay that I don't know  
But remember please I gave you love that's only mine to give  
And Jainie, don't you know?  
Jainie, don't you know I been tryin'?  
Jainie, don't you know?  
Jainie, don't you know I been tryin'?
