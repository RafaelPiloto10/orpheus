She's thinkin' about what her kids are doing  
Five miles away it's almost time for bed  
They're brushing teeth and hearing one more story  
And in the mirror, she paints her lips bright red  
  
She wishes she could call and say she loves them  
But the boss man says no calls go out or in  
So she puts on a dress that might feel pretty  
If she didn't have to take it off again  
  
[Chorus:]  
She's dancin' for the groceries  
She's dancin' for the rent  
She's dancin' for the credit card that she's already spent  
In sequins and in laces, she's dancing for the braces  
So her kids can have a perfect smile someday  
Smiling while she dances, is the price she has to pay  
  
They tell her in this job there is no future  
So get it while you can cause looks don't last  
There's money in those pockets for the taking  
And if you do it right it makes the time go fast  
  
The music's loud, the drinks are mostly water  
Whatever her name is tonight she can't recall  
The business men stare at the single mother  
Who's smiling while she's staring at the wall  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Someday she'll have a house out in the country  
Someday she'll see the other side of dawn  
And no one will ever know what it was she did before  
But she just heard the DJ say "you're on"  
And the lights come up and they play her song  
  
She's dancin' for the groceries  
She's dancin' for the rent  
She's dancin' for the credit card that she's already spent  
In sequins and in laces, she's dancing for the braces  
So her kids can have a perfect smile someday  
Smiling while she dances, smiling while she dances  
Is the price she has to pay  
She's dancin' for the groceries  
It's the price she has to pay
