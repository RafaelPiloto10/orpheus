Ooh ooh  
You're all alone  
Well, so am I  
We could dance all night  
Are you willing to try  
All night's all right  
If you're in no hurry -- well  
Neither am I  
Do you like to boogie  
Well just stop on by  
All night's all right  
All night's all right  
  
Ooh ooh  
Mama's away  
Daddy too  
Me and you all alone  
With nothing to do  
All night's all right  
We're taking it slow  
We're taking it fast  
Do you like tomorrow  
Make it last  
All night's all right  
All night's all right  
  
All night's all right  
All night's all right  
All night's all right
