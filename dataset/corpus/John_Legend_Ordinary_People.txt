Girl, I'm in love with you  
This ain't the honeymoon  
Passed the infatuation phase  
Right in the thick of love  
At times we get sick of love  
Seems like we argue everyday  
  
I know I misbehaved and you made your mistakes  
And we both still got room left to grow  
And though love sometimes hurts  
I still put you first  
And we'll make this thing work but I think maybe we should take it slow  
  
We're just ordinary people  
We don't know which way to go  
Cause we're ordinary people  
Maybe we should take it slow  
Take it slow, ohh  
This time we'll take it slow  
Take it slow, ohh  
This time we'll take it slow  
  
This ain't a movie love  
No fairytale conclusion y'all  
It gets more confusing everyday  
Sometimes it's heaven sent  
Then we head back to hell again  
We kiss then we make up on the way  
  
I hang up, you call  
We rise and we fall  
And we feel like just walking away  
As our love advances we take second chances  
Though it's not a fantasy I still want you to stay  
  
We're just ordinary people  
We don't know which way to go  
Cause we're ordinary people  
Maybe we should take it slow  
Take it slow, ohh  
This time we'll take it slow  
Take it slow, ohh  
This time we'll take it slow  
  
Take it slow  
Maybe we'll live and learn  
Maybe we'll crash and burn  
Maybe you'll stay, maybe you'll leave  
maybe you'll return  
Maybe another fight  
Maybe we won't survive  
But maybe we'll grow  
We never know Maybe you and I  
  
We're just ordinary people  
We don't know which way to go  
Cause we're ordinary people  
Maybe we should take it slow  
  
We're just ordinary people  
We don't know which way to go  
Cause we're ordinary people  
Maybe we should take it slow  
  
Take it slow, ohh  
This time we'll take it slow  
Take it slow, ohh  
This time we'll take it slow  
Take it slow, slow  
This time we'll take it slow  
Take it slow, ohh  
This time we'll take it slow
