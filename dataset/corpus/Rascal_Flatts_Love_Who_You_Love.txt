I should have stolen every moment  
Now there's a page with not enough on it  
Where we belong  
I guess I'll never understand it  
Why do we take it all for granted  
Until it's gone  
'Cause then it's gone  
  
Love who you love  
With all that you have  
And don't waste the time that flies so fast  
Love who you love  
And say that you do  
Hold on as tight as they'll let you  
Love who you love  
  
Give all ya' got like its your last day  
Your heart and soul before it's too late  
And pull 'em in  
So close enough that they can feel it  
With every single breath that you're breathin'  
Breathe it in again and again  
  
[Chorus]  
Love who you love  
With all that you have  
And don't waste the time that flies so fast  
Love who you love  
And say that you do  
Hold on as tight as they'll let you  
  
Hold on, hold on  
Love who you love  
Say that you do  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Love who you love)  
Love who you love  
(Love who you love)  
  
Hold on, keep on holding on  
Yeah, with every single breath you're breathing  
  
Love who you love  
Love who you love  
Again and again and again and again.
