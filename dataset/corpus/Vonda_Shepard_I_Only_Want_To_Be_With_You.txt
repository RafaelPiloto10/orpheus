I don't know what is that makes me love you so  
I only know I never want to let you go  
'Cause you started something, can't you see?  
That ever since we met you've had a hold on me  
It happens to be true  
I only want to be with you  
It doesn't matter where you go or what you do  
I want to spend each moment of the day with you  
Look what has happened with just one kiss  
I never knew that I could be in love like this  
It's crazy but it's true  
I only want to be with you  
You stopped and smiled at me, asked me if I'd care to dance  
I fell into your open arms and I didn't stand a chance  
Now listen honey, I just want to be beside you everywhere  
As long as we're together, honey, I don't care  
'Cause you started something, can't you see  
That ever since we met you've had a hold on me  
No matter what you do  
I only want to be with you  
No matter what you do  
I only want to be with you
