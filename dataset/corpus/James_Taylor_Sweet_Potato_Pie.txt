Oh Lord I feel fine today,  
I'm walking on cloud nine today.  
I'm over that line today,  
Happiness is finally mine today.  
I guess I'm just a lucky guy  
And I'm prepared to tell you why.  
It's strictly on account  
Of my sweet potato pie.  
  
I'm the fellow that she loves the most,  
The main reason why she left the coast.  
She's my little girlzina,  
That much hotter that a jalapeno.  
Tender like a night in June,  
Sweeter than a honeymoon,  
Brighter than a silver spoon,  
Just as crazy as a loon.  
  
Softer than a lullaby,  
Deeper than the midnight sky,  
Soulful as a baby's cry,  
My sweet potato pie.  
  
I used to see her around the neighborhood,  
I wonder how she grew up so good.  
She belonged to Freddy and he was bad  
And I never was ready to make him mad.  
I'm glad I had to wait awhile,  
A little bit too juvenile.  
I needed to refine my style, a silk suit  
And a crocodile smile.  
  
So let the whole damn world go by  
'Cause I just want to testify  
From now on it's me  
And my sweet potato pie.
