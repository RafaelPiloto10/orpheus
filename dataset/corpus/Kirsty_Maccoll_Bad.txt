I've been the token woman all my life  
The token daughter and the token wife  
Now I collected tokens one by one  
'Til I've saved enough to buy a gun  
Now you can't get even but you can get mad  
And it's not funny no and it's not sad  
It's just a feeling that I've always had  
Oh Look out world I'm about to be bad  
  
I want a brief encounter in a stolen car  
A hand on my buttock in a Spanish bar  
I want to meet the man who wants to go too far  
For a token of my affection  
I want to taste excitement  
Smell the danger  
Get swept off my feet by the perfect stranger  
I want to try something that I've never had  
Oh look out world I'm about to be bad  
  
I've been an awful woman all my life  
A dreadful daughter and a hopeless wife  
And I've had my eye on that carving knife  
Oh you've been lucky so far  
I'm not crazy no I'm just mad  
I don't want to be sorry  
No I want to be glad  
It's just a feeling inside that I have always had  
So look out world I'm about to be bad
