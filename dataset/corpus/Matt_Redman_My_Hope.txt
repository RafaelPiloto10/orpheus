My hope is built  
On nothing less  
Then Jesus' blood and righteousness  
I dare not trust  
The sweetest frame  
But wholly lean  
On Jesus' Name  
  
When the mountains are falling  
When the waters are rising  
I shall be safe in You  
Though the nations are quaking  
Every kingdom be shaken  
Still will rest in You  
  
When darkness seems  
To hide Your face  
I rest on Your  
Unchanging grace  
In every high  
And stormy gale  
My anchor holds  
Within the veil
