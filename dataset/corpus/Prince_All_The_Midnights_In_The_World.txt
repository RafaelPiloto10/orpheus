Because I turned my eye toward you  
Because I seek your hand  
Every other woman envies you  
And me, every other man  
  
A massive circle of jealousy  
Is coming round again  
Those prickly fingered scallywags  
That masquerade as friends  
  
Make a promise this very night  
That they will no longer pose  
A threat to either one of us  
Then let the chapter close  
  
For all the midnights, in the world  
This one will serve us better  
If you choose to be my girl  
  
Like Susan's petals  
A wonderful life, the two of us shall lead  
The children of the future've all the  
Spiritual food they need  
  
The secrets that the ones before  
With grace, they've come and shown  
Together with love for one another  
We shall make them known  
  
With the love and happy days  
I number the grains of sand  
Writing twelve times ever more  
If I could be your man  
  
Amethyst and rubies  
Crystals and black pearls  
I trade them all, just to spend with you  
All the midnights, in the world  
  
All the midnights, in the world
