I'll bring my love to you  
I'll bring my love to you  
  
I've been stood up messed around  
And taken for a fool  
But next time round  
I'm gonna change the rules  
  
And I don't care about the things that people say  
It's you I think about each and everyday  
It's much too late for you to change your ways  
I can't keep holding on expecting you to stay  
  
When you're all alone and if you're feeling down  
Call me, I'll be around  
  
Whenever you need somebody  
I'll bring my love to you  
You don't have to say you love me  
I just want to be with you  
  
Lost inside your love is where I want to be  
I'm just asking you to spend some time with me  
Time and time you say you want to be free  
And you can have some fun that's okay with me  
  
You will never know just how good I feel  
The joy inside of me makes me feel so real  
When you're all alone and if you're feeling down  
Call me, I'll be around  
  
Whenever you need somebody  
I'll bring my love to you  
You don't have to say you love me  
I just want to be with you  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
I'll bring my love to you  
I just want to be with you  
  
It's much too late for you to change your ways  
I can't keep holding on expecting you to stay  
When you're all alone and if you're feeling down  
Call me, I'll be around  
  
Whenever you need somebody  
I'll bring my love to you  
You don't have to say you love me  
I just want to be with you  
  
[Chorus: x2]
