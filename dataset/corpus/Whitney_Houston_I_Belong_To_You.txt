You are the flame in my heart  
You light my way in the dark  
You are the ultimate star  
You lift me from up above  
Your unconditional love  
Takes me to paradise  
I belong to you  
And you  
You belong to me too  
You make my life complete  
You make me feel so sweet  
You make me feel so divine  
Your soul and mind are entwined  
Before you I was blind  
But since I've opened my eyes  
And with you there's no disguise  
So I could open up my mind  
I always loved you from the start  
But I could not figure out  
That I had to do it everyday  
So I put away the fight  
Now I'm gonna live my life  
Giving you the most in every way  
I belong to you  
And you  
You belong to me too  
You make my life complete  
You make me feel so sweet  
Oh I belong to you  
I belong to you  
And you, you  
You belong to me too  
You make my life complete  
You make me feel so sweet  
Oh I belong to you  
I belong to you  
And you, you  
You belong to me too  
You make my life complete  
You make my life complete  
You make me feel so sweet  
Oh I belong to you  
I belong to you  
And you, and you  
You belong to me too  
You make my life complete  
You make my life complete  
You make me feel so sweet
