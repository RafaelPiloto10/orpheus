Well I've been waiting all year  
Just for this day to get here,  
And I've been learning nothing goes  
Exactly like you plan.  
  
Yeah, I've been flying solo,  
Wishing I was in Soho.  
I thought I'd be a no-go for this show,  
But here I am.  
  
You might have seen me checking out  
What's underneath that tree,  
But I have realized that there is  
Just one gift for me.  
  
It's a perfect Christmas,  
It's a perfect Christmas,  
It's a perfect Christmas  
'Cause I'm with you!  
  
Wooh!  
  
The ornaments are rocking,  
Somebody stole my stocking.  
I think I threw out all my gift cards  
With the recycling.  
  
The Christmas lights are tangled,  
The mistletoe got mangled,  
And even though my nerves are jangled,  
I'm good with everything!  
  
'Cause now I know the reason  
It's the season of good cheer.  
I'd even eat the fruit cake,  
It's the same one as last year!  
  
It's a perfect Christmas,  
It's a perfect Christmas,  
It's a perfect Christmas  
'Cause I'm with you!  
  
Hey! Hey! Hey!  
Put your hands up in the air!  
Ho! Ho! Ho!  
Santa, can you feel it?  
Here we go!  
Spread the magic everywhere.  
Hey! Ho! Everybody shout out loud!  
  
It's a perfect Christmas,  
It's a perfect Christmas,  
It's a perfect Christmas  
'Cause I'm with you! (Hey! Hey! Hey!)  
'Cause I'm with you! (Ho! Ho! Ho!)  
'Cause I'm with you! (Here we go!)  
'Cause I'm with you! (Ho! Ho! Ho!)  
'Cause I'm with you.
