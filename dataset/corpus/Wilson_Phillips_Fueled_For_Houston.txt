Fueled for Houston  
I missed all my calls this morning  
The coffee may still be burning  
I'm in a yellow taxi racing down to LAX  
Will you be next? I can't wait.  
I'm moving around, moving around (I'm ready baby)  
I'm on my way  
  
The jet is fueled for Houston  
I'm coming for you, for you, for you, for you  
I didn't bring my enemies or my worries  
I'm on my way to you  
  
The pilot says we're climbing  
I can feel the engines burning  
And it won't be long 'til I get down to Texas yes  
The Wild Wild West  
I'm on my way. Movin'around  
I'm ready baby I'm on my way  
  
The jet is fueled for Houston  
I'm coming for you, for you, for you, for you  
I didn't bring my enemies or my worries  
I'm on my way to you  
  
Movin' at a real fast pace, don't wanna slow down  
Movin' at a real fast pace, don't wanna slow down  
Movin' at a real fast pace, don't wanna slow down, 'til I see your face.  
  
I'm ready baby (Movin' around) I'm on my way Aaah  
  
The jet is fueled for Houston  
I'm coming for you, for you, for you, for you  
I didn't bring my enemies or my worries  
I'm on my way to you  
  
I don't have any bags, just get me off this plane!
