Breaking the silence  
Is the hardest thing in life  
Knowin' that you're wrong  
Feelin' like you can't go on  
I've been a victim  
So many times  
But I'm man enough to know when I'm wrong  
  
With the fresh cut mullets  
Back row in sight  
Pass the packed bullet  
I'm gonna rock all night  
  
Up tight right wingers  
Trying to say I'm what  
But I'm a flight bound singer  
Not givin' a fuck  
  
Hard luck of the devil  
With the grace of God  
On a level of Oz  
And it makes you nod  
  
With the body of a sinner  
Mind of a saint  
I'm everything you love  
Everything you hate  
  
Hit a lot of curves  
Hard roads and hills  
Got nerves of steel  
And watched time stand still  
  
It took too long  
But I stood my height  
You can say I'm wrong  
  
[Chorus]  
But you ain't right  
You ain't right  
You ain't right  
You ain't right  
You ain't  
Right  
You ain't  
Right  
You ain't  
Right  
You ain't  
right  
  
You can save the environment  
With all your wit  
But can you save your children  
From a world of bullshit  
You look at me  
With a loss for love  
But if you took me out  
Would your kid still do drugs  
You want to point your finger in the unclear  
You ought a point your finger at the mirror  
  
You want to trip  
Quit 'cause I'm a keep rippin'  
You can bitch but the strippers gonna keep strippin'  
I'm singing songs in the key of life  
You can say I'm wrong  
  
[Chorus]
