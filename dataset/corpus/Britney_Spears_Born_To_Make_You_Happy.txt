I'm sitting here alone up In my room  
Thinking about the times that we've been through (oh my love)  
I'm looking at a picture In my hand  
Trying my best to understand  
  
I really want to know what we did wrong  
With the love that felt so strong  
If only you were here tonight  
I know that we could make It right  
  
I don't know how to live without your love  
I was born to make you happy  
'Cause your the only one within my heart  
I was born to make you happy  
  
Always and forever you and me  
That's the way our life should be  
I don't know how to live without your love  
I was born to make you happy  
  
I know I've been a fool since you've been gone  
I'd rather give It up then carry on (oh my love)  
'Cause livin In a dream of you and me  
Is not the way my life should be  
  
I don't want to cry a tear for you  
So forgive me If I do  
If only you were here tonight  
I know that we could make It right  
  
I don't know how to live without your love  
I was born to make you happy  
'Cause your the only one within my heart  
I was born to make you happy  
  
Always and forever you and me  
That's the way our life should be  
I don't know how to live without your love  
I was born to make you happy  
  
I'd do anything  
I'd give you my world  
I'd wait forever to be your girl  
Just call out my name (just call out my name)  
  
I will be there (and I will be there)  
Just to show you how much I care  
I don't know how to live without your love  
I was born to make you happy  
  
'Cause your the only one within my heart  
I was born to make you happy  
Always and forever you and me  
That's the way our life should be  
  
I don't know how to live without your love  
I was born to make you happy  
I was born to make you happy  
Always and forever you and me  
  
That's the way our life should be  
I don't know how to live without your love  
I was born to make you happy
