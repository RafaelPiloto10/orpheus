Look for the strength you know you can feel  
Search for the truth you know that is real  
Then reach for the place you know they can't steal  
And say, I'm feeling good with my life  
  
No point in letting life bring you down  
There's always something bad hangin' round  
Face up to trouble and stare it out  
I know I'm feeling good with my life  
  
In my life - everything is feeling good  
In my life - feeling like you know it should  
In my life - can't you see it's understood  
I'm feeling good with my life  
  
No better place to start than with you  
Get your head together then follow through  
It's not what you're saying it's what you do  
I know I'm feeling good with my life  
  
Don't fantasize how your life could be  
Make all your dreams a reality  
Then there is nothing can bring you down  
I know I'm feeling good with my life  
  
In my life - everything is feeling good  
In my life - feeling like you know it should  
In my life - can't you see it's understood  
I'm feeling good with my life  
  
We've got to make it living together  
Learning to share our lives  
We've got to speak from the heart  
Find a new way to start  
That's something we've all got to realise  
In my life
