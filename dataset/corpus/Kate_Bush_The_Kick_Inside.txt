I've pulled down my lace and the chintz.  
Oh, do you know you have the face of a genius?  
I'll send your love to Zeus.  
Oh, by the time you read this,  
I'll be well in touch.  
  
I'm giving it all in a moment or two.  
I'm giving it all in a moment, for you.  
I'm giving it all, giving it, giving it.  
This kicking here inside  
Makes me leave you behind.  
No more under the quilt  
To keep you warm.  
Your sister I was born.  
You must lose me like an arrow,  
Shot into the killer storm.  
  
You and me on the bobbing knee.  
Didn't we cry at that old mythology he'd read!  
I will come home again, but not until  
The sun and the moon meet on yon hill.  
  
I'm giving it all in a moment or two.  
I'm giving it all in a moment, for you.  
I'm giving it all, giving it, giving it.  
This kicking here inside  
Makes me leave you behind.  
No more under the quilt  
To keep you warm.  
Your sister I was born.  
You must lose me like an arrow,  
Shot into the killer storm.
