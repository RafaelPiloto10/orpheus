Well I've had a lot of money  
I had a good paying job  
But all I want is for her to be happy  
To do something she can be proud of  
That's all I want  
That's all I need  
All I want is for her to keep loving me  
And that eternal flame  
Will remain we will sustain  
And that jealousy  
Ain't no part of me  
Jealousy ain't a part of me  
Jealousy ain't a part of me  
Jealousy so she can keep loving me  
Walking around with a  
Chap on my back  
(girls) this man don't care  
I don't care rat a tat tat  
All I want is just a little of your love  
I want to give you something baby  
That you can be real proud of  
All I want that's all I need  
All I want that's all I need  
For you to keep loving me  
Give you good loving  
Make you proud of me  
Give you good loving  
Make you proud of me  
Give you good loving  
Make you proud of me  
Give you good loving  
Make you proud of me  
(girls) give me good loving  
Make you proud of me  
Give me good loving  
Make you proud of me  
(girls) all I want and all I need  
Is you to keep loving me  
Just keep on loving me like the water to the sea  
Let it flow let it be  
Like the wind when it blows  
You can't see it but somehow you know it's cold  
All I need is for you to keep loving me  
And that eternal flame will remain  
We will sustain  
Jealousy ain't a part of me  
Jealousy no part of me  
Jealousy no part of me  
Then you can keep loving me  
Jealousy
