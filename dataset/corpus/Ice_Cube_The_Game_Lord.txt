[Ice Cube]  
I love chrome and paint, lookin' for some motherfuckin' corners to bank  
West coast what the fuck you thank?  
Everybody here off weed and drank (everybody)  
Before you check my rims  
When you leave the parking lot, check ya limbs  
You better check ya friends  
And see if ya baby momma left with them  
Blacks and Mexicans, stop all that bullshit in the pen  
Understand that is us verse them  
They can give a fuck if we sink or swim  
They give us guns and drugs  
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs  
I got to show my ass  
To thank these motherfuckers for my past  
In South Central, Los Angeles, Grandmama smoke cannabis  
Granddaughter wanna dance and shit, her own momma can't stand the bitch  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
If you fuckin' up, pray to the game lord  
Wanna bust a nut? Pray to the game lord  
Nigga get ya cup, pray to the game lord  
You can throw it up, pray to the game lord  
  
[Ice Cube]  
I love where I from, hungry ass niggas better get you some  
Smart ass niggas play dumb  
Y'all can't fuck with the city I run  
If I snap my fingers, better curl up just like a fetus  
I hope you know Jesus  
Because if you don't, boy you will see us  
Where? Up in your house, two double barrels up in your mouth  
You got some explainin' to do  
And don't get the line 'cause we aiming at you  
(Ewww!) It's a doggy dog world baby, you a nut and I'ma squirrel baby  
Can I get ya in my world baby?  
Can ya grease my Jerry curl baby?  
Did you flip yo' wig  
To let Michael Jackson baby sit yo' kids?  
That nigga old as hell  
They need to throw the motherfuckin' momma in jail  
Let 'em know  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Fuck wit this if you want to, the game lord will punish you  
Punish us if we ain't true, to the game like we 'pose to  
  
[Ice Cube]  
I'm the game lord, y'all come now  
Casanova niggas, got the sun down  
Run down every hoe that wanna go shoppin'  
Get they kids, take 'em to the mall, buy 'em somethin'  
Are you a gentleman?  
Big bear wit a nigga named Gentle Ben  
Ladies, he'll be yo' friend  
Wait for the cable guy, even let him in  
Not me, I won't flex or bend  
Just 'cause a hoe promise me some trim  
You better get wit the rest of them  
Cause can't none of y'all even fuck wit Kim  
Some niggas was born wit hoe in 'em  
I was put on this Earth to spit ism  
And I shall return like it's written  
And slay all the suckers who be sippin'  
  
[Chorus: x2]
