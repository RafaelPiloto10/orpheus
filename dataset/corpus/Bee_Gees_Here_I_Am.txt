I know that you want a man  
To love you like no other can  
Here I am , here I am  
I know that you want a boy  
To fill your lonely heart with joy  
Here I am , here I am  
I'm gonna prove that my love was made for only you  
If you don't believe me ,watch and you'll see me  
Make you love me too  
I know that you want a boy  
To fill your lonely heart with joy  
Here I am , here I am  
(break)  
Here I am , here I am  
(break)  
Here I am , here I am  
I'm gonna prove that my love was made for only you  
If you don't believe me , watch and you'll see me  
Make you love me too  
I know that you want a boy  
To fill your lonely heart with joy  
Here I am , here I am  
Here I am , here I am
