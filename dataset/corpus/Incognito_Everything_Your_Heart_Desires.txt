Out in Rio, we strolled the Ipanema  
And headed for the samba  
How could we know, Just what would come at sunset  
The day we'll never forget  
  
With Sugar loaf in the distance fading  
We held the night, and it felt so right  
No greater feeling have I known  
Than to watch the sunrise in your eyes  
Sweet love  
  
Now I got this feeling, it's undenying  
Gonna give you everything your heart desires  
Yes I got the feeling, making me feel so good  
Gonna give you everything your heart desires  
  
Come with me now, let's take a flight to Mexico  
Something there I want to show you  
Lets take our wings like butterflies, together we can touch the skies  
Like Frida and Diego  
  
Through the deserts and the harsh lands baby  
I hold you tight, it feels so right  
No greater feeling have I known  
Than to watch the sunrise in your eyes  
Sweet love
