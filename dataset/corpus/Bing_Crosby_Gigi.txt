Gigi, am I a fool without a mind  
Or have I merely been to blind to realize?  
Oh Gigi, why you've been growin' up  
Before my very eyes!  
  
Gigi, you're not at all the funny  
Awkward little girl I knew  
Oh no, overnight there's been a breathless  
Change in you!  
  
Gigi, why you were tremblin' on the brink  
Was I out yonder somewhere blinkin' at a star?  
Oh Gigi, have I been standin' up to close  
Or back too far?  
  
When did your sparkle turn to fire  
And your warmth become desire?  
Oh, what miracle  
Has made you the way you are?
