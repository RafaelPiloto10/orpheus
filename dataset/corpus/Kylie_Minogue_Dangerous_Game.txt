Surely this can't be heaven  
Though it feels like I died  
I guess it's just goodbye then  
There's nowhere left to hide  
Can't you see you have the power  
  
To make or break my day  
I'm getting weaker by the hour  
All the time you stay away  
  
I'm so in alone I feel so lonely  
Here on my own I've lost my way  
I never dream't that it could hurt like this, boy  
Lost in the absence of your precious kiss  
Why do I feel this pain  
Loves just a dangerous game  
  
So where do I go from here  
What do I have to do  
Something to make you realize  
Just how I feel for you  
  
Don't you see you have the power  
To make or break my day  
I'm getting weaker by the hour  
Do you hear me when I say  
  
I'm so in alone I feel so lonely  
Here on my own I've lost my way  
I never dreamt that it could hurt like this, boy  
Lost in the absence of your precious kiss  
Why do I feel this pain  
Loves just a dangerous game  
  
But the feeling still remains  
And the embers feed the flame  
How I hope you feel the same  
So I love will grow again  
  
It's only you see you have the power  
To make or break my day  
I'm getting weaker by the hour  
Can't you hear me say  
I can't face the world today  
  
I'm so in alone I feel so lonely  
Here on my own I've lost my way  
I never dreamt that it could hurt like this, boy  
Lost in the absence of your precious kiss  
Why do I feel this pain  
Loves just a dangerous game
