Clouds roll by  
Reeling is what they say  
Or is it just my way?  
  
Wind blows by low light  
Side tracked low light  
Can't see my tracks your scent way back  
  
Can I be here all alone?  
Clear a path to my home  
Blood runs dry  
Books and jealousy tell me wrong  
All I feel calm  
Voice blows by low light  
Car crash low light  
Can't wear my mask your first my last  
  
Voice goes by  
Two birds is what they'll see  
Getting lost upon their way  
Wind rolls by, low light  
Eye sight, low light  
I need the light  
I'll find my way from wrong, what's real?  
The dream I see
