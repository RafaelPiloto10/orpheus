Won't you come and go with me  
Down that Mississippi?  
We'll take a boat to the land of dreams  
Come along with me on down to New Orleans  
  
Now the band's there to greet us  
Old friends will meet us  
Where all them folks goin' to the St. Louis cemetery meet  
Heaven on earth, they call it Basin Street  
  
I'm tellin' ya Basin Street is the street  
Where all them characters from the first street they meet  
New Orleans, land of dreams  
You'll never miss them rice and beans  
Way down south in New Orleans  
  
They'll be huggin' and a kissin'  
That's what I been missin'  
And all that music, Lord, if you just listen'  
New Orleans, I got them Basin Street blues  
  
Now ain't you glad you went with me  
On down that Mississippi?  
We took a boat to the land of dreams  
Heaven on earth, they call it Basin Street
