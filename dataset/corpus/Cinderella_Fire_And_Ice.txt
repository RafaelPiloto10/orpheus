And do ya feel like I feel  
When I want you baby  
Inside can't ya hide  
Cause it's scratchin' right through  
Come on  
And take it easy, nowhere to go  
She'll take ya fast and she'll take ya slow  
  
Like fire and ice  
She'll take your heart away  
Fire and ice  
She'll take your breath away  
  
And when ya shake for me, shake for me  
Shake for me ooo yea  
Ya take me down and around  
When ya do what ya do  
Come on  
And take it easy, nowhere to go  
She'll take ya fast and she'll take ya slow  
  
Like fire and ice  
She'll take your heart away  
Fire and ice  
She'll take your breath away  
  
Don't let me down  
I couldn't take it this time  
Don't kick me round  
I'll kick you out of my mind  
Take it  
  
Fire and ice  
Fire and ice  
  
Fire and ice  
She'll take your heart away  
Fire and ice  
She'll take your breath away  
  
Fire and ice  
She'll take your heart away  
Fire and ice  
She'll take your breath away fire and ice  
She'll leave ya breathless  
Fire and ice
