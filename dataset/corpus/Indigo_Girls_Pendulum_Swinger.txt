I meet you for coffee  
We get together periodically and  
I got a bad case I can't shake off of me  
The fevered wanderin round wondering how it ought to be  
You work in the system  
You see possibilities and you're glistening  
Eyes show the hell you're gonna give 'em  
When they back off the mic for once and give it to a woman  
I dream like a mad one  
Brutal fantasies I catch as catch can  
I'm a psychic and a laywoman  
I see love and I like to make it happen  
What we get from your war walk  
The ticker of the nation breaking down like a bad clock  
I want the pendulum to swing again  
So that all your mighty mandate was just spitting in the wind  
It doesn't come by the bullwhip  
It's not persuaded with your hands on your hips  
It's not the company of gunslingers  
The epicenter love is the pendulum swinger  
She is she is she is  
It's fine about the old scroll Sanskrit  
Gnostic gospels the da vinci code a smash hit  
Aren't we dying just to read it and relate it  
Too hard just to go by a blind faith  
But they left out the sisters  
I've been praying to a father god so long I really missed her  
The goddess of benevolence  
You should listen to your mama if you have a lick of sense left  
Pushed under by the main press, buried under a code of dress  
Relegated by the Vatican  
But you can't keep a spirit down that wants to get up again  
If we're a drop in the bucket  
With just enough science to keep from saying fuck it  
Until the last drop of sun burns its sweet light  
Plenty revolutions left until we get this thing right
