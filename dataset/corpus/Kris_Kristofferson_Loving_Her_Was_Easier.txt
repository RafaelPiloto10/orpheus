(That Anything I'll Ever Do Again)  
  
I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountains in the skies.  
Achin' with the feelin' of the freedom of an eagle when she flies.  
Turnin' on the world the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying.  
Healin' as the colours in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes.  
  
Wakin' in the mornin' to the feelin' of her fingers on my skin.  
Wipin' out the traces of the people and the places that I've been.  
Teachin' me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying.  
Talkin' of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend.  
  
Lovin' her was easier than anything I'll ever do again.  
  
Comin' close together with a feelin' that I've never known before, in my time.  
She ain't ashamed to be a woman, or afraid to be a friend.  
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind.  
But dreamin' was as easy as believin' it was never gonna end.  
  
And lovin' her was easier than anything I'll ever do again.  
  
Oooooh.  
Oooooh.  
Ahhh.
