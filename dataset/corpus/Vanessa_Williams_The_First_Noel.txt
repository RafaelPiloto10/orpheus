The first Noel, The angels did say  
Was to certain poor shepherds,  
In fields as they lay  
  
In fields where they  
Lay keeping their sheep  
On a cold winter's night, that was so deep  
  
[Chorus:]  
Noel, Noel  
Noel, Noel  
Born is the king of Israel  
  
When they looked up, and saw a star  
Shining in the east, beyond them far  
And to the earth, it gave great light  
And so it continued both day, and night  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
(Noel, Noel)  
  
[Chorus: x4]
