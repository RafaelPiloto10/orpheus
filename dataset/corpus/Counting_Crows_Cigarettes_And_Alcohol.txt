(original by Oasis)  
  
Is it my imagination  
Or have I finally found  
Something worth living for?  
I was looking for some action  
But all I found was cigarettes and alcohol  
You could wait for a lifetime  
To spend your days in the sunshine  
You might as well do the white line  
Cos when it comes on top. ..  
You've gotta make it happen!  
You gotta make it happen  
You gotta make it happen  
You gotta make it happen  
Is it worth the aggravation  
To find yourself a job  
When there's nothing worth working for?  
It's a crazy situation  
But all I need are cigarettes and alcohol  
You could wait for a lifetime  
To spend your days in the sunshine  
You might as well do the white line  
Cos when it comes on top. ..  
You've gotta make it happen!  
You've gotta make it happen!  
You gotta make it happen!  
You gotta make it happen!  
You gotta, you gotta, you gotta make it  
You gotta, you gotta, you gotta fake it  
You gotta, you gotta, you gotta make it  
You gotta, you gotta, you gotta fake it
