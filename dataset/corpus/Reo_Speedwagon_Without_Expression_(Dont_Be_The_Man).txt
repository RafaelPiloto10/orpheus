Have you ever ridden horses through a rainstorm  
Or led a lion through a busy street bazaar  
There are many things I'd love to turn you on to  
But somehow I feel they're safer where they are.  
  
Well some people in bound infatuation  
While some others spell depression as the law  
Someone's mother getting no imagination  
So beware then, baby, sin is at everyone's door.  
  
Don't be the man I know with no expressions lord  
Ain't got none at all  
Pity the man I know with no expressions lord  
Ain't got none at all  
  
But you'll never, no you'll never see this man laughing  
Come to think of it, I've never seen this man cry  
But you might by sitting quietly hear him singing  
By and by, he'll stop and sigh,  
His voice will even start to speak and he will say goodbye.
