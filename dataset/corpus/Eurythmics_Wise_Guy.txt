Leave my face down beneath the sun  
I'll get a better view of what's going on  
Let me do the things that I do best  
In a state of humble gratefulness  
This must be where I belong  
The ice-cream king is playing my song  
To a girl with a teenage clothing dilemma  
Who says  
Let me kiss your lips  
  
If you smile with the wise  
You get a key to an open sky  
If you smile with the wise  
You get to see your name in neon lights  
  
Lead me into unknown pleasures  
Save your lying for the needy  
Give me something good to treasure  
As I bite the hands that feed me  
Suffer  
Suffocate in wisdom  
Read a book then smash the system  
Free and foolish call it clever  
I'm the one and only  
Go-go getter  
  
If you smile with the wise  
You get a key to an open sky  
If you smile with the wise  
You get to see your name in neon lights
