The sky is crying the streets are full of tears  
Rain come down wash away my fears  
And all this writing on the wall  
Oh I can read between the lines  
Rain come down forgive this dirty town  
Rain come down and give this dirty town  
A drink of water a drink of wine  
  
If I've been hard on you I never chose to be  
I never wanted no one else  
I tried my best to be somebody you'd be close to  
Hand in hand like lovers are supposed to  
  
As you'd sleep I'd think my heart would break in two  
I'd kiss your cheek I'd stop myself from waking you  
But in the dark you'd speek my name  
You'd say baby what's wrong  
Oh, here I am baby I'm coming back for more  
I'm like a wave that's going to roll into the shore  
Yes and if my love's in vain how come my love is so strong?  
  
Now you and me go parallel together and apart  
And you keep your perfect distance and it's tearing at my heart  
Did you never feel the distance?  
You never tried to cross no line  
Now it's another dirty river and another dirty scar  
And I don't know who's kissing you and I don't know where you are  
So far from home don't you think of me sometimes
