I'm trying to remember the very last time I felt a simple  
Thing going past. Was it the day in north Georgia you were  
Trying to take her back. She sees the day lilies for sale sign  
And the tears spring to her eyes. You turned the car around  
You headed back down that track.  
She's had a heart attack but the bottle of jack sits on the  
Counter like the devil she knows. He beats her up as she fills  
Her cup and the embers of a dying fire glow.  
You see how she looked in her school yearbook.  
Her friends signed the margins all around, would you stay in  
Touch you know I'll miss you so much and I hope we get out  
Of this town.  
Every day that you get up and force your cards. You're  
Playing your story in fists ans starts. You take your prospects  
And your pick axe and you trudge down to the stream.  
And you bloody your hands digging for your dream.  
I went looking for the answers from someone I heard believes that life gets
easier. You learn how to breathe or you lern how to grieve the past.  
You study the masters and their books giving in to the barbs and hooks.  
Till you execpt it with grace when your true love doesn't last.  
Every day that you get up and force your cards. You're  
Playing your story in fists ans starts. You take your prospects  
And your pick axe and you trudge down to the stream.  
And you bloody your hands digging for your dream.
