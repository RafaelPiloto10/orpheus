La la la  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Can you hear me now?  
  
This is not the girl you used to know  
Talking to you know  
I don't think you want me to explore  
It's the countdown  
It took you too long  
To find out what you want  
Right now  
I'm too gone  
To stay around  
Switching up my style  
  
Now our faces never stick around  
A.K.A  
Never hold you down  
A.K.A  
Can't figure it out  
A.K.A  
You don't know me now, oh  
You don't know me now  
A.K.A  
A.K.A  
Oh, you don't know me now  
A.K.A  
You don't know me now  
Oh, you don't know me now  
  
They all seem to want you when you go  
I was here, I was here before  
What goes around, comes back around for sure  
So I'mma let, I'mma let you know  
It took you too long  
To find out what you want  
Right now  
I'm too gone  
To stay around  
Switching up my style  
  
Now our faces never stick around  
A.K.A  
Never hold you down  
A.K.A  
Can't figure it out  
A.K.A  
You don't know me now, oh  
You don't know me now  
A.K.A  
A.K.A  
Oh, you don't know me now  
A.K.A  
You don't know me now  
Oh, you don't know me now  
  
You don't know me now  
Oh, you don't know me now  
  
It took you too long  
To find out what you want  
Right now  
I'm too gone  
To stay around  
Switching up my style  
  
Now our faces never stick around  
A.K.A  
Never hold you down  
A.K.A  
Can't figure it out  
A.K.A  
You don't know me now, oh  
You don't know me now  
A.K.A  
A.K.A  
Oh, you don't know me now  
A.K.A  
You don't know me now  
Oh, you don't know me now
