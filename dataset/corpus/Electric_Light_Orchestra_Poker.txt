Away, the joker's closing in,  
Reform and they will win,  
The light is fading fast.  
I know, you know, they know, we all know,  
Everybody's gonna burn down.  
  
The girls come crawling on all fours,  
Banging on locked doors,  
High cards call the tune.  
I know, you know, they know, we all know,  
Everybody's gonna burn down.  
  
Play me another hand,  
Loose everything I am,  
Until we meet again.  
  
The ace, that's hiding up your sleeve,  
Will cause the world to grieve,  
The love you had is gone,  
I know you know, they know, we all know.  
  
The dream, in every player's heart,  
To win it all not part,  
They lie awake at night,  
I know, you know, they know, we all know.  
  
The game, where gamblers rule the night,  
And get your blood they might,  
The joker's closin' in,  
I know, you know, they know, we all know.
