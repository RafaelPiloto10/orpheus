It's a cold and winter's night and the rain is falling down  
It's so cold, cold outside, snow is laying all around  
There is blackness in my window, and the silence is the only sound  
  
Well I'm sitting and I'm thinking though I like to watch T.V.  
It just fills my head with garbage that my eyes ain't supposed to see  
Got the turned off T.V. blues now, but I'm lonely as you see  
  
Well I've got a worried feeling, all the pain and misery  
Well, it's happening in the world now, even though I cannot see  
Though my body is now with you, still my mind is running free  
  
There's just nothing I can do now, though I search from day to day  
But the truth is so hard to tell you, and you know it, anyway  
It's a cold and winter's evening, I wish my blues would go away
