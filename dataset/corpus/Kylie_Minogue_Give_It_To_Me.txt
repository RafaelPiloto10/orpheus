I never ask for much  
I just want some good lovin'  
More of you tender touch  
I don't C the need for rushin'  
Take it slow, slow down  
Move to the rhythm that is in my mind  
Take it slow, you know now  
Not to fast, make it last for the longest time  
  
[Chorus]  
Give it, give it to  
Give it to me like I want it  
Give it, give it to  
Give it to me like I want it  
  
I need a shot of love  
Cause I got a bad bad habit  
Can't seem to get enough  
Give it to me cause I got to have it  
  
Here we go.  
Let's go now  
Move to the rhythm that is in my mind  
Here we go you know now  
I'm the lead follow me  
for a real good time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Givin' all your love to me  
O so right so can't you C  
You're some kind of fantasy  
Just like I want it  
  
Hit by love I don't know how  
Come to me I want you now  
Feel so high I won't come down  
Just like I want it
