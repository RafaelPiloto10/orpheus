We're character actors from the Tower of Babel  
Bewildered, burnt out, hardly able  
To sit astride the high wire cable  
It's hard to balance, a little unstable.  
  
Through broken eyes and contact lenses  
Watched you draw your future tenses  
See kisses of flame blow out of your lips  
You're back telling me your Apocalypse.  
  
Don't get me wrong, I'll be strong  
When the slow burn sunset come along  
You've gotta stay the night  
I gotta think that you might.  
  
We've tried a handful of bills and a handful of pills  
We've tried making movies from a volume of stills  
But the words fell like hailstones,  
bouncing at our feet  
Covering our feelings with a frozen sheet.  
  
A chance to move, I take a shot  
I get cold you get hot  
We look outside, lyin' awake  
See birds breaking surface on a silent lake.  
  
But don't get me wrong, I'll be strong  
When I'm back on the Isle of Avalon  
Don't get me wrong, I'll be strong  
When the slow burn sunset come along  
You've got to stay the night  
I've got to think that you might.  
  
Don't try to make it easy, it'll cut you down to size  
Darlin' we've got to trust in something  
We're shooting down our skies  
Shooting down our skies.
