Remember when somebody tried to tell you how to walk  
And now they got the balls to tell us how we should talk  
Oh no, glove love ain't cool, I must agree  
So get outta my face, you ain't got nothin' on me  
  
Some say they do, some say they don't, I take it in stride  
And I can never get enough if I don't got to swallow my pride  
I heard it all before and then she told me, gimme some slack  
Then she smiled at me and gave me the shirt right off her back  
(And that's when I took advantage of the situation)  
  
Don't stop  
Rockin' your socks off  
Don't stop  
Knockin' their blocks off  
Don't stop  
Gettin' your rocks off  
Don't stop  
Takin' a hit, boy  
Don't stop  
Shakin' your fist, boy  
Don't stop  
I ain't got much to lose  
I'm feelin' so confused  
  
There's such a small thin line between pleasure and pain  
And when you say don't, then it's don't stop, I got to complain  
(Yeah) I think I may be gettin' real tired of all the steam  
Because it's hard to get the way you move out of my dreams  
(Got to get it while you can)  
  
Whenever you're in doubt, you got to whip it out  
When you keep hearin' no and your body says yes  
But you can't hear a word that's been said  
But you gotta confess lookin' up her address  
Got you thinkin' with your other head
