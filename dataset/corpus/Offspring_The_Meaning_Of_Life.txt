On the way  
Trying to get where I'd like to say  
I'm always feeling steered away  
By someone trying to tell me  
  
What to say and do  
I don't want it  
I gotta go find my own way  
I gotta go make my own mistakes  
  
Sorry man for feeling  
Feeling the way I do  
On yeah, Oh yeah  
Open wide and they'll shove in  
  
Their meaning of life  
Oh yeah, Oh yeah  
But not for me I'll do it on my own  
Oh yeah, Oh yeah  
  
Open wide and swallow their meaning of life  
I can't make it work your way  
Thanks but no thanks  
By the way  
  
I know your path has been tried and so  
It may seem like the way to go  
Me, I'd rather be found  
Trying something new  
  
And the bottom line  
In all of this seems to say  
There's no right and wrong way  
Sorry if I don't feel like  
  
Living the way you do
