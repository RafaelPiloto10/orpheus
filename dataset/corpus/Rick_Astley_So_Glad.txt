I left my baby  
I bought a ticket for the train  
I waited all day long  
But the train never came  
  
And I was so glad  
I was so glad  
The train never came  
  
The reason I was leaving  
Was all because of sin  
I didn't want to do it  
But I was sucked in  
  
And I was so sad  
I was so bad  
I didn't go home  
  
I was out with the boys  
Drinking all night  
Gambling all my money  
Got into a fight  
  
And I cried for my baby  
But my baby never came  
Sirens were a wailing  
And I stepped off of the train  
  
I picked up my bags  
And started down the road  
The night was drawing in now  
And I was getting cold  
  
And I was so glad  
I was so glad  
She was still home  
  
I'll never go out with the boys  
Drinking all night  
I'm saving all my money  
Never getting in a fight  
  
And I'll stay with my baby  
Never leaving her alone  
I'm keeping outta trouble  
So I'll be staying at home  
  
I'll be so glad  
We're both still home  
  
We're both still home  
  
We're both still home  
  
Staying at home  
Staying at home  
  
We're both still home
