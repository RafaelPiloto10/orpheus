Down in old Kentucky where horseshoes are lucky  
There's a village smithy standin' under the chestnut tree  
Hear the hammer knockin', see the anvil rockin'  
He sings the boogie blues while he's hammerin' on the shoes  
  
See the hot sparks a-flyin' like fourth of July-in'  
He's even got the horses cloppin' pop, down the avenue  
Folks love the rhythm, the clang bangin' rhythm  
You'll get a lot of kicks out of the blacksmith blues

Oh, down in old Kentucky where horseshoes are lucky  
There's a village smithy standin' under the chestnut tree  
Hear the hammer knockin', see the anvil rockin'  
He sings the boogie blues while he's hammerin' on the shoes

Out of the blacksmith blues  
Out of the blacksmith blues  
Hammer knockin', anvil rockin'  
Horses cloppin', pops are boppin'  
The blacksmith blues
