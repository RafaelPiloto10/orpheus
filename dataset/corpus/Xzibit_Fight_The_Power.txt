Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Let's go...  
  
Fight the power  
Fight the power  
Fight the power  
You gotta fight the power that be  
Let me hear you say  
Fight the power  
Fight the power  
Fight the power  
You gotta fight the power  
That be  
  
1989 the number another summer (Get down)  
Sound of the fucking drummer  
Music hitting your heart cause I know you got soul (Brothers and sisters)  
Listen if you're missing y'all  
Swinging while I'm singing  
Giving whatcha getting  
Knowing what I know  
While the Black bands sweating  
And the rhythm rhymes rolling  
Got to give us what we want  
Gotta give us what we need  
Our freedom of speech is freedom or death  
We got to fight the powers that be  
  
Let me hear you say  
Fight the power  
Fight the power  
Fight the power  
You gotta fight the powers that be  
Let me hear you say  
Fight the power  
Fight the power  
Fight the power  
You gotta fight the powers  
That be  
  
As the rhythm designed to bounce  
What counts is that the rhymes  
Designed to fill your mind  
Now that you've realized the prides arrived  
We got to pump the stuff to make us tough  
From the heart  
It's a start, a work of art  
To revolutionize make a change nothing's strange  
People, people we are the same  
No we're not the same  
'Cause we don't know the game  
What we need is awareness, we can't get careless  
You say what is this?  
My beloved lets get down to business  
Mental self defensive fitness  
Bum rush the show  
You gotta go for what you know  
Make everybody see, in order to fight the powers that be  
  
Let me hear you say  
Fight the power  
Fight the power  
Fight the power  
You gotta fight the powers that be  
Let me hear you say  
Fight the power  
Fight the power  
Fight the power  
You gotta fight the powers  
That be  
  
Elvis was a hero to most  
But he never meant shit to me you see  
Straight up racist that sucker was  
Simple and plain  
Motherfuck him and John Wayne  
'Cause I'm Black and I'm proud  
I'm ready and hyped plus I'm amped  
Most of my heroes don't appear on no stamps  
Sample a look back you look and find  
Nothing but rednecks for 400 years if you check  
Don't worry be happy  
Was a number one jam  
Damn if I say it you can slap me right here  
Let's get this party started right (Right on, come on)  
What we got to say  
Power to the people no delay  
To make everybody see  
In order to fight the powers that be  
  
Let me hear you say  
Fight the power  
Fight the power  
Fight the power  
You gotta fight the powers that be  
Let me hear you say  
Fight the power  
Fight the power  
Fight the power  
You gotta fight the powers  
That be
