I won't be told anymore  
That I've been brought down in this storm  
And left so far out from the shore  
That I can't find my way back, my way anymore  
  
No I won't be told anymore  
That I've been brought back in this storm  
And left so far out from the shore  
That I can't find my way back, my way anymore  
  
No, I..  
No, I...  
  
Forgive them they teared down my soul  
Bless them that they might grow old  
And free them so that they may know  
That it's never too late  
  
For the many times would seem like a memory  
I searched and found the way to choose to the end  
I found the ways, why it had to be  
Mired in denial and saw all the rain  
  
If we ever find it true  
Life we have is made to choose  
Free the ball, the chain  
We're here together  
  
I'm gonna tell you a story  
Stand up for righteousness!  
What?  
Stand up for justice!  
What?  
Stand up for truth!  
How can a person grow up with all this around them?  
You got to call on that something  
Where does it come from?  
That can make a way out of no way  
All this hatred?  
What we've got here is..  
Fear!  
That power that can make a way out of now no way  
Failure to communicate  
I tell ya I seen the lightning...I've heard the thunder roll!  
Everybody's acting like we can do anything and it don't matter what we  
Do. Maybe we gotta be extra careful because maybe it matters more than  
We even know..  
Sometimes...  
Hatred isn't somethin' you're born with  
I feel discouraged  
It gets taught  
Sometimes I feel discouraged  
I felt this fear  
He promised never to leave me, never to leave me alone, no never alone,  
No never alone!  
Let's get something straight, alright?  
Promised never to leave me!  
This whole thing was fucked up  
Never to leave me alone!  
All men betray. All lose heart!  
I don't want to lose heart!...I want to believe  
Black men and white men  
Together at the table of brotherhood!  
I have a dream  
Free at last! Free at last! Thank God almighty!! WE ARE FREE AT LAST!!  
  
  
I won't be told anymore  
That I've been brought down in this storm  
And left so far out from the shore  
And I can't find my way back, my way anymore  
  
No I won't be told anymore  
That I've been brought back in this storm  
And left so far out from the shore  
That I can't find my way back, my way anymore
