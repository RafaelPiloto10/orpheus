Hear that old train whistle  
Howling in the night  
If that flyer's southbound  
Things will be all right  
  
I'm leaving now, leaving now, leaving now,  
I'm gonna get back home somehow  
  
Don't nobody tell me  
Baby's been untrue  
If she's been unfaithful  
I don't know what I'll do  
  
I'm leaving now, leaving now, leaving now  
I'm gonna get back home somehow  
  
Never thought that I could miss her so  
I never thought I could, but now I know  
The sound of the old train whistle  
Makes me want to cry  
Reminds me of that lonely feeling  
When I said goodbye  
  
I'm leaving now, leaving now, leaving now  
I'm gonna get back home somehow  
  
Never thought that I could miss her so  
I never thought I could, but now I know  
The sound of the old train whistle  
Makes me want to cry  
Reminds me of that lonely feeling  
When I said goodbye  
  
I'm leaving now, leaving now, leaving now  
I'm gonna get back home somehow
