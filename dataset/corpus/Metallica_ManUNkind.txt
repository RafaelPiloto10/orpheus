Chaos  
Awaiting for Adam's return  
Madness  
Smiling, as we watch it burn  
  
I've become  
  
Hostage to my mind  
Left myself behind  
Blind lead blind  
Quest to find  
Faith in man(un)kind  
  
Garden  
Of Eden, so simple and pure  
Greedy  
Needy, must we have more?  
  
I've become  
  
Hostage to my mind  
Left myself behind  
Blind lead blind  
Quest to find  
Faith in man(un)kind  
  
Fascinate  
Partner of insanity  
Decimate  
Lessons we never learn  
  
Dominate  
Killing of the innocence  
Deviate  
And to dust you return  
Yeah  
  
Seized by the day  
Frozen captive by the night  
Seized by the day  
All the dark days of your life  
  
Seized by the day  
Frozen captive by the night  
Led so astray  
All the dark days of your life  
  
Zero  
Reset, creation of man  
Foolish  
Ready, to witness again?  
  
I've become  
  
Hostage to my mind  
Left myself behind  
Blind lead blind  
Quest to find  
Faith in man(un)kind  
  
Faith in man(un)kind  
Oh, Faith in man(un)kind  
Faith in man(un)kind  
Oh, Faith in man(un)kind
