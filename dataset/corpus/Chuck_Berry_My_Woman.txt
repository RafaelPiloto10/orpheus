Last night as I lay me down in bed  
Over and over I heard the last words my woman said  
Take me with you, I'm so lonesome  
But I choose to leave instead  
Yesterday, she came to me and held my hand  
Said she was blue and oh so lonesome  
And would I try to understand  
I didn't know till this morning  
How much my woman means to me  
This morning when I got home, she was not there  
I noticed her clothes were gone  
And a little note lay on my shelf  
Said as you read this, I love you still  
But I'll be gone, I don't know where  
Today I got the blues and I got 'em bad  
Last night as I lay sleeping  
My conscious will not go to rest  
Yesterday I lost the best woman I ever had  
One of these days, can't say where and I don't know when  
It may be in time, it may be soon  
It may be in a place I've never been  
But I'm gonna find that fine woman  
And together with her again
