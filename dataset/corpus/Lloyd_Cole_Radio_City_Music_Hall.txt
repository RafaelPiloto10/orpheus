You just saved my life  
Now this may not be what you had in mind  
Would you love me to death my dear  
Oh no no she said better alive than dead  
When are you gonna come home  
(when are you gonna come home)  
Are you waiting for the end of the world  
(when are you gonna come home)  
When are you gonna come home  
And be loved by the ones you love  
It's a senseless thing desire  
To be loved by everyone  
It's a senseless thing desire  
To be loved by everyone  
When are you gonna come home  
(when are you gonna come home)  
Are you waiting for the end of the world  
(when are you gonna come home)  
When are you gonna come home  
And be loved by the ones you love  
Ah ah ah oh

You don't find my jokes that funny do ya  
If I took you to the hollywood bowl  
Oh no no she said radio city music hall  
Ah ah ah oh  
And be loved by the ones you love  
Ah ah ah oh  
Come on love the ones you love  
It's a senseless thing desire  
To be loved by everyone  
It's a senseless thing desire  
To be loved by everyone  
(when are you gonna come home)  
When are you gonna come home, ah oh

When are you gonna come home

When are you gonna come home, ah oh

When are you gonna come home  
And be loved by the ones you love
