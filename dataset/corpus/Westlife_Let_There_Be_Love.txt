Let there be you  
Let there be me  
Let there be oysters  
Under the sea  
  
Let there be wind  
An occasional rain  
Chile con carne  
Sparkling champagne  
  
Let there be birds  
To sing in the trees  
Someone to bless me  
Whenever I sneeze  
  
Let there be cuckoos  
A lark and a dove  
But first of all, please  
Let there be love  
  
Let there be cuckoos,  
A lark and a dove,  
But first of all, please  
Let there be love  
  
Hmmm umm...love  
Hmmm umm...love  
  
Let there be love
