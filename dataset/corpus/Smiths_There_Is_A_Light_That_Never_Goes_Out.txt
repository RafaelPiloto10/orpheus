Take me out tonight  
Where there's music and there's people  
And they're young and alive  
Driving in your car  
I never never want to go home  
Because I haven't got one  
Anymore  
  
Take me out tonight  
Because I want to see people and I  
Want to see life  
Driving in your car  
Oh, please don't drop me home  
Because it's not my home, it's their  
Home, and I'm welcome no more  
  
And if a double-decker bus  
Crashes into us  
To die by your side  
Is such a heavenly way to die  
And if a ten-ton truck  
Kills the both of us  
To die by your side  
Well, the pleasure - the privilege is mine  
  
Take me out tonight  
Take me anywhere, I don't care  
I don't care, I don't care  
And in the darkened underpass  
I thought oh God, my chance has come at last  
(But then a strange fear gripped me and I  
Just couldn't ask)  
  
Take me out tonight  
Oh, take me anywhere, I don't care  
I don't care, I don't care  
Driving in your car  
I never never want to go home  
Because I haven't got one,  
Oh, I haven't got one  
  
And if a double-decker bus  
Crashes into us  
To die by your side  
Is such a heavenly way to die  
And if a ten-ton truck  
Kills the both of us  
To die by your side  
Well, the pleasure - the privilege is mine  
  
Oh, there is a light and it never goes out  
There is a light and it never goes out  
There is a light and it never goes out  
There is a light and it never goes out  
There is a light and it never goes out  
There is a light and it never goes out  
There is a light and it never goes out  
There is a light and it never goes out  
There is a light and it never goes out
