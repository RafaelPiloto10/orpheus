[Chorus]  
Woke up screaming fuck the world today I, had it up to here  
Ex-girlfriend got custody today cause, they say she feels  
That I'll never be the daddy that she, wants me to be  
Hardest thing I've ever had to do, sayin' bye to my seeds, ohhh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Damn, look at what I call my life, a glock-9  
And a eightball of white, I got mine  
Well, not quite, I got signed  
And fifty put me right in the light, it took time  
Meanwhile I'm livin the life  
Where a nigga just might see prison tonight  
My rent due, baby need food and shoes  
I'm flat broke, still I refuse to lose  
So I smoke, lookin' for the fools with jewels  
I'm 'bout to see if it's true what a Uzi do  
Nobody cares, and life ain't fair or free  
The best thang you can do is say a prayer for me  
And how dare, y'all try to lock me up  
You not here, so you ain't really givin' a fuck  
But I swear, as long as I'm breathin', I'm hustlin'  
I'm thuggin', and this is the reason because I  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you see me in a suit and tie (in a suit and tie)  
Tell all my niggaz goodbye (tell my niggaz goodbye)  
Tell 'em that I'm on my wayyyyy (tell 'em I'm on my way man)  
Say a prayer for me and hug the kids (hug the kids)  
Tell God all of the shit I did (the shit I did)  
And how the kids looked up to me (cause they did look up to me nigga!)  
Yeahhhh  
  
Heyyy, holla if you feel my pain  
I been to hell and back, and I'm still the same  
The block hotter than flames, but we sell the 'caine  
Putti'n all kind of thangs in our baby's name  
Tell the hoes "I'm rich bitch" like my name Rick James  
I really ain't got shit, but I can't complain  
Cause L.T. got life, and Big Ju got fifty  
Jimmy did his ten and D doin his twenty  
Come get me, seems like it's no way out  
So when I say "Dirty," you say "South"  
Tryin' to put my hands on somethin', brush off my shoulders  
Buy up some land or somethin', get what they owe us  
You don't have a plan, you're nuttin' is what they told us  
Remember what the O.G.'s showed to the soldiers  
Gotta make it to heaven or die tryin' to get it  
The day dude fuck with Dre, I was feelin' like  
  
[Chorus]
