I can watch little girl  
From the back of my car  
I see you and show  
At the place that you are  
Groceries spillin' up  
Out of your bag  
Thinkin' you'll end up  
A penniless hag  
  
But I see the girl  
That you are deep inside  
Won't you allow me  
To give you a ride  
I can console you  
And give you kiss  
Show you that you can do  
Better than this  
  
[Chorus]  
Angel girl  
In a cold dark world  
I'm gonna be your man  
Angel girl  
In a cold dark world  
I'll make you understand  
  
I know  
That you're thinkin'  
I'm trying to score  
But deep in your heart  
You know that I'm more  
Than a cat or a scoundrel  
Now that I've found you  
I don't want to lose you  
How can I prove  
You know that I am sincere  
You don't need to fear  
I'm not like the others  
I'll be like a brother  
I will protect you  
Never disrespect you  
But if you love  
Then I'll be here  
To sex you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It might take awhile  
To get with the style  
Life at the end  
Of the miracle mile  
But you're gonna love  
The rising above  
All the trash  
That is sweeping  
You under the rug  
  
I'm gonna be there  
  
[Chorus: x2]
