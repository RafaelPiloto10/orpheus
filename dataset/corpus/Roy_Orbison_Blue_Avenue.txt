Blue Avenue  
Where I spend my lonely days without you  
Blue Avenue  
Why did you go and tell me we were through?  
  
You've stolen my heart and my love  
And now you say we're through  
I'm walkin' down  
Yeah, walkin' down on Blue Avenue  
  
Oh, Blue Avenue  
Yeah I'm feeling so bad  
Blue Avenue  
I lost the very best woman that I ever had  
  
Alone so alone  
But I pray that someday I'll find you  
Down at the end  
Down at the end of Blue Avenue  
  
Oh, Blue Avenue  
Yay yay I'm feeling so bad  
Blue Avenue  
I lost the very best woman that I ever had  
  
Alone so alone  
But I pray  
That someday I'll find you  
Down at the end  
Down at the end of Blue Avenue
