Angela, I'm still alive  
Angela, I'm still alive  
The sun and the sea  
The darkness in the way  
All the pain don't get no better  
It gets stronger every day  
  
It happens to be true  
That I still pray to you my love  
Voices in the night, don't help  
My searching for the truth, my love  
  
And when I'm lost  
And high above the storm  
I hear your name  
I'm empty inside, I'm empty inside  
And where are you  
  
Angela, I'm still alive  
For the two of us  
I'm still alive  
You've got to imagine us  
All the world was on our side  
We had the power of the universe  
And we were ready  
We were ready for the ride  
  
Moonlight in her hair  
Her eyes the wonder of the age  
But all I mean to you my love  
Is just a spotlight on an empty stage  
  
And through it all  
One fire in the rain  
Keeps burning on, keeps burning on  
I can't stop my heart  
It's beating for you  
Reaching for you  
But you are gone  
I'm empty inside, I'm empty inside  
And where are you  
  
Angela, I'm still alive  
For the two of us  
I'm still alive  
Angela, I'm still alive  
Angela, I'm still alive  
Angela, I'm still alive
