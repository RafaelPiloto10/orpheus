Last round  
Looks like I'm in for a fight  
Knocked down  
There is nowhere left to hide  
Stick 'n' move  
When I try to run away  
Old one-two  
I only end up face to face  
  
Mirror, mirror getting clearer  
It's just me and my shadow  
Dancing round the ring  
I try to fight it  
But then how can I win  
When I'm only shadow boxing?  
  
Time out  
I'm looking for a  
Standing eight  
No doubt  
My inside has come out to play  
Bob 'n' weave  
It's conscious of my  
Every move  
Been deceived  
Can no longer ignore the truth  
  
Mirror, mirror getting clearer  
Split decision, blur my vision
