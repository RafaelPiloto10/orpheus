On the eastern highway we ride  
Windshield wipers disperse the rain from the sky  
What's left is ivy and vine  
All the letters I'd sent back home  
Never express the idea of how a young man  
Can be so far from home  
  
Take your guns to town  
Don't take your guns to town  
Take your guns to town  
  
Don't take your guns to town  
Stumble down main street alone  
Just gotten home with my hand on the phone  
I was drinking alone on the quilted (?????????)  
  
Take your guns to town  
Don't take your guns to town  
Take your guns to town  
Don't take your guns to town
