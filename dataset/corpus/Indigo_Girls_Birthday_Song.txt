I couldn't think of a thing to write  
On your birthday card  
Considered the poets  
But they didn't know what  
Lay quite inside my heart  
I thought of Atlanta  
I thought of Toronoto  
And all of the places we've been  
I filled up my tea and looked into the trees  
And still came up empty again  
So I guess the next time you see me  
In a world of partial truths  
You will fully believe me  
I have nothing to give except but to live  
Like the person you know me to be  
I can clean up the kitchen  
And fold up your clothes  
Neatley as I am able  
Wrap a box up with ties for a surprise  
And order you flowers for the table  
I could book us a trip  
On a plane or ship  
I know how much you love the sun  
You could gamble on me  
Like the lottery  
And I'll make you feel like you've won  
And I'll bet the next time you see me  
In a world of partial truths  
You will fully believe me  
I have nothing to give except but to live  
Like the person you know me to be  
Life is short and so on  
I'd like to give you something to go on  
Grow on  
They recently paved the walk on our street  
We looked at the shiny cement  
We stopped the car ready to carve  
Our names into permanence  
For a moment we're kids  
Intent on a whim  
There is no shadowy past  
But even so the urge is to go  
And put something down  
That will last  
So here goes  
The next time I show up for you  
You will know  
And believe  
I am ready to give  
Ready to live  
Like the person you know me to be.
