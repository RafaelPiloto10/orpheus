Everything grows and grows  
Babies do  
Animals too  
Everything grows  
Everything grows and grows  
Sisters do  
Brothers too  
Everything grows  
A blade of grass, fingers and toes  
Hair on my head, a red, red rose  
Everything grows, anyone knows  
That's how it goes  
Yes, everything grows and grows  
Babies do  
Animals too  
Everything grows  
Everything grows and grows  
Sisters do  
Brothers too  
Everything grows  
Food on the farm, fish in the sea  
Birds in the air, leaves on the tree  
Everything grows, anyone knows  
That's how it goes  
Yes, everything grows and grows  
That's how it goes under the sun  
That's how it goes under the rain  
Everything grows, anyone knows  
That's how it goes  
Yes, everything grows and grows  
Babies do  
Animals too  
Everything grows  
Everything grows and grows  
Sisters do  
Brothers too  
Everything grows  
Mamas do and papas too  
Everything grows
