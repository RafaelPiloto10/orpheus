I love those dear hearts and gentle people  
Who live in my home town  
Because those dear hearts and gentle people  
Will never ever let you down  
  
They read the good book  
From Fri till Monday  
That's how the weekend goes  
I've got a dream house  
I'll build there one day  
With picket fence and rambling rose  
  
I feel so welcome each time I return  
That my happy heart keeps laughing like a clown  
I love the dear hearts and gentle people  
Who live and love in my home town  
  
There's a place I'd like to go  
And it's back in Idaho  
Where you're friendly neighbors smile and say hello  
It's a pleasure and a treat  
To meander down the street  
That's why I want the whole wide world to know  
(I love those dear hearts)  
I love the gentle people  
(Who live in my home town)  
Because those dear hearts and gentle people  
Will never ever let you down  
  
They read the good book  
From Fri till Monday  
That's how the weekend goes  
I've got a dream house  
I'll build there one day  
With picket fence and rambling rose  
  
I feel so welcome each time that I return  
That my happy heart keeps laughing like a clown  
I love the dear hearts and gentle people  
Who live and love in my home town  
  
(Home, home, sweet home)  
(Home, home, sweet home)  
(Home, home, sweet home)  
(Home, home, sweet home)
