Well I can wash out forty four pairs of socks  
And have 'em on the line  
You know I can starch and iron two dozen shirts  
'Fore you can count from one to nine  
I can slip up a great big dip up of lard from a drippings can  
Throw it in the skillet, do my shopping, and be back before it melts in the
pan  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause I'm a woman  
W-O-M-A-N  
Let me tell ya again  
I'm a woman  
W-O-M-A-N  
  
Well I can rub and scrub till this house shines just like a dime  
Feed the baby  
Grease the car  
Powder my nose at the same time  
  
You know I can get all dressed up  
Go out swinging with the M-A-N  
Jump in bed at five  
Sleep till 6  
And start all over again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well now if you come to me sick you know that I'm gonna make you well  
And if you come to me all hexed up you know I'm gonna break the spell  
And if you come to me hungry, you know  
I'll feed ya full of my grits  
And if it's loving you want, I can kiss you and give you the shivering  
fits  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(I'll say it again)  
  
Well, I got a twenty dollar gold fee that says there's nothing that I  
can't do  
Well I can make a dress out of feeding sacks and I can make a man out  
of you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm a woman  
I'm a woman  
I'm a woman  
Yeah I'm a woman
