I'll still be missing you  
Just as long as the sun shines through  
No matter what I do, I'll still be missing you  
I told myself when I walked out your door  
Don't look back you don't need him anymore  
Out there somewhere a new world you're gonna find  
So walk away and leave the rest of time  
I'll still be missing you  
Just as long as the sun shines through  
Pretending that I'm not blue, I'll still be missing you  
  
What a fool I was  
To think that I could lead a way of life already built in me  
Now all those times that used to seem so bad  
I know now were the best I've ever had  
I'll still be missing you...
