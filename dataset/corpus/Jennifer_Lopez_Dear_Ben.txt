You're perfect  
Oh perfect  
  
I just can't control myself  
I can't be with no one else  
It seems like I'm addicted to the way you like to touch me  
I don't think they understand  
Why love at your command from  
The words you speak so deep  
Our bodies read  
I have to have you  
  
[Chorus]  
I love you  
You're perfect  
A manifestation of my dreams  
  
You made my  
Body feel  
About a million different things  
  
I think God made you for me  
A mix of passionate fidelity  
Baby you're so complete  
I write this song to let you know  
That you will always be to me  
My lust, my love, my man, my child, my friend  
and my king  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's no way  
I'd leave you  
It's just not a reality  
  
Sometimes I  
Feel like I'm  
Livin' in a fantasy
