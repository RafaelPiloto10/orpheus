I've seen visions in the night, passing through the stars  
Who's to run and who's to fight?  
  
Evil tries to pull me in, enslaving me to die  
Who's to lose and who's to win  
  
I'll see the light, tonight  
Flashing through the sky  
Take my life, tonight  
  
Now, the chaos has begun, people crying out  
You're all alone, you gotta run  
  
Victims of circumstance, not able to decide  
No, we never had a chance  
  
I'll see the light, tonight  
Flashing through the sky  
Take my life, tonight  
  
Evil tries to pull me in, enslaving me to die  
Who's to lose and who's to win  
  
Victims of circumstance, not able to decide  
No, we never had a chance  
  
I'll see the light, tonight  
Flashing through the sky  
Take my life, tonight
