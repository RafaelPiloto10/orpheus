I met her at the Living Earth Show  
She crossed the room, the lights sank low  
We're together, she really digs me she fucks me  
Who would think I could be so happy?  
When I'm cold, I know she's keepin' me warm  
We're together, she really digs me she fucks me  
  
She's in my arms, she's in my heart, yeah  
Pins and needles up and down my spine  
We're together, she really digs me now  
She fucks me, she fucks me
