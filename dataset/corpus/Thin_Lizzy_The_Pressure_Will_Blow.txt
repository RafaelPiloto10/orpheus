Set me on my destination  
Point me the way to my position  
What's the meaning of my mission  
I have made my decision clear  
  
I don't need another reason  
I don't want anymore prime time  
I have made my decision  
Not for the first but for the last time  
  
I'm setting on slow  
I'm building it up  
I'm letting it go  
The pressure will blow on time  
  
I don't want another story  
You can place it with your nursery rhymes  
I don't want to take the glory  
Why don't you and him take it this time  
  
I don't need another reason  
I can't make another plan  
I know you're both in secret liaison  
So we must go our separate ways  
  
I'm setting on slow  
I'm building it up  
I'm letting it go  
The pressure will blow on time  
  
So I'll keep pushing my position  
Till the pressure builds it well  
But I keep pressing your decision  
Till you've made your mind up as well  
  
I can't take another season  
I can't make another play  
I know you're in secret liaison  
So we must go our separate ways  
  
I'm setting on slow  
I'm building it up  
I'm letting it go  
The pressure will blow on time
