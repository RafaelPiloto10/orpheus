Mount up, move on,  
May you find the way back home.  
  
Down and down we go,  
Down into bright October,  
Brothers in arms no more  
Now that the war is over.  
Have you waded in  
And been to hell?  
Will you lie upon the sofa,  
See to the decoration of your shell  
Now that the war is over?  
  
Mount up, move on,  
Damn the darkness,  
Speed the dawn,  
They lost, we won.  
Try to find  
Your way back home, native son.
