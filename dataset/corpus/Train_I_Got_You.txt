Hey, did you hear, about the one that got away,  
They say, he looked left,  
She turned right, meant to be together but not that night,  
It's when fate's running late, we tend to make mistakes,  
We go 'round and 'round, from love to love  
It's either way too much or not enough  
  
Gimme lazy days with nothing better to do  
Than singin' oh black water keep on rollin' while I wait for you  
I don't care if it rains, I'll be just fine,  
I'm leaving the ghosts behind until  
I got you, I got you  
You're the sun through my window, warming my skin  
Oh you, I got you  
Hey,  
  
Then when one of them was taken, the other one was waiting  
For the next big thing  
To bring them to the gates of heaven  
Or maybe just a late night in Vegas  
It's true, that's what we do when were going down swingin'  
Then coming up singing the blues  
Wearing out my shoes, chasing new faces to get to you  
  
Driving home on a summer night  
Singin' old black water  
Keep on rolling 'till the time is right  
I don't care if it rains, I'll be just fine  
Sit back enjoy the ride  
  
Until I got you, I got you  
You're the sun through my window  
Warming my skin, oh you I got you Like Sonny and Cher  
Except I'll be there for you, I got you  
Let old black water bring us together  
  
Old black water keep on rolling  
Mississippi moon won't you keep on shining on me  
Old black water keep on rolling  
Mississippi moon won't you keep on shining on me  
Wanna hear some funky Dixieland  
Pretty Mama come on take me by the hand,  
Wanna hear some funky Dixieland  
Pretty mama,  
Here she comes,  
  
I got you, I got you  
You're the sun through my window warming my skin,  
Oh you I got you  
Like Sonny and Cher you know I'll be there for you  
I got you, let old black water bring us together  
You, I got you, I got you , I got you baby  
By the hand hand take me by the hand  
Pretty mama dance with your daddy all night long  
Wanna hear some funky Dixieland  
Pretty mama come and take me by the hand  
By the hand hand, take me by the hand  
Pretty mama dance with your daddy all night long  
Wanna hear some funky Dixieland  
Pretty mama come and take me by the hand  
By the hand hand, take me by the hand  
Pretty mama dance with your daddy all night long  
Wanna hear some funky Dixieland  
Pretty mama come and take me by the hand
