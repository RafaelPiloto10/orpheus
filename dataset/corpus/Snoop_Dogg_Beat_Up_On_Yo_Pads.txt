They bang every Saturday and Sunday loc  
SYFL man it ain't no joke  
Helmet and shoulders pads ain't no bullet proof vest  
See there ain't to many options in the wild wild west  
So I've been blessed so I guess I can give back  
Football in the hood dog you did that  
I brought the demos back and that's just one  
I'm in the one where the steelers come and get some  
Want some bad enough take it  
Running backs dip and cut shake it you ain't getting none  
Inside out hit that 8 I love it when they say that who's house  
C house g house b house d house well we house wherever we go  
Blowing them out letting them know that you could shine its all for the kids  
Plus there having a good time  
And as long as I live I'm stay doing positive and helping the kids  
And when you see me on the football field I need to holla at you dog  
Homie chill what you need to do is read up on my past  
Before I have my little homies go and beat up on your ass  
Matter fact lil homie go and be up on yo pads

Beat up on yo pads, SYFL Beat up on yo pads  
Beat up on yo pads, come on lil homie go on beat up yo pads
