(bert's blues)  
I've been looking for a good guy  
For a long, long time.  
Been looking for a good guy,  
One to ease my mind  
As well as my time.  
I've been singing in the evening,  
Flying through the night.  
But I hurt my good guy,  
I hope he makes out right,  
Flying through the night.  
I've been picking up the sunshine,  
Been drinking down the rain.  
I've been picking up the sunshine,  
It makes me wonder when  
I'll see him again.  
You know time could bring a change, man,  
It ain't for me to say.  
You'll soon be out of range, man,  
This could only be the way  
It's meant to be.  
Fairy castle stark and black in the moonlight,  
The jingle jangle jester rides his stallion.  
Seagulls fly across my mind forever.  
Sadly goes the wind on it's way to hades.  
Would I, should I, could I be a stranger ?  
I shall walk right by and sigh good-bye.  
I've been looking for a good guy  
For a long, long time  
Been looking for a good guy,  
One to blow my mind  
As well as my time.  
I've been looking, you know I've been looking,  
You better believe I've been looking.  
I've been picking up the sunshine,  
I've been drinking down the rain.  
I've been thinking of the sunshine,  
I've been looking for a good guy,  
One to ease my mind  
As well as my time.  
Blow my mind  
As well as my time,  
Blow my mind ...
