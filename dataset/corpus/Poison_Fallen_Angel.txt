She stepped off the bus out into the city streets  
Just a small town girl with her whole life  
Packed in a suitcase by her feet  
But somehow the lights didn't shine as  
Bright as they did  
On her mama's TV screen  
And the work seemed harder  
And the days seemed longer  
Than she ever thought they'd be  
  
But you know you got to stick to your guns  
When it all comes down  
Cause sometimes you can't choose  
It's like heads they win  
Tail you're gonna lose  
  
[Chorus]  
Win big, mama's fallen angel  
Lose big, livin' out her lies  
Wants it all, mama's fallen angel  
Lose it all, rollin' the dice of her life  
  
Now she found herself in the fast lane  
Livin' day to day  
Turned her back on her best friends, yeah  
And watched her family slip away  
Just like a lost soul  
Caught up in the Hollywood scene  
All the parties and limousines  
  
Such a good actress  
Hiding all her pain  
Trading in memories for fortune and fame  
Just a step away from the edge of the fall  
Caught between Heaven and Hell  
Where's the girl I knew a year ago  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Too much too soon  
Or just a little too late  
'Cause when her ship came in  
She wasn't there and it just wouldn't wait  
  
[Chorus]
