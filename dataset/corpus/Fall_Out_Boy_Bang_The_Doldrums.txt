I wrote a goodbye note  
In lipstick on your arm  
When you passed out  
I couldn't bring myself to call  
Except to call it quits  
  
[Chorus]  
Best friends  
Ex-friends till the end  
Better off as lovers  
And not the other way around  
Racing through the city  
Windows down  
In the back of  
Yellow-checkered cars  
  
This city says  
Come hell or high water  
When I'm feeling hot and wet  
I can't commit to a thing  
Be it heart or hospital  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The tombstones are waiting  
They were half engraved  
They knew it was over  
Just didn't know the date  
  
And I cast a spell over the West  
To make you think of me  
The same way I think of you  
This is a love song in my own way  
Happily ever after below the waist  
  
Best friends  
Ex-friends till the end  
Better off as lovers  
Racing through the city  
Windows down  
In the back of  
Yellow-checkered cars  
  
Best friends  
Ex-friends till the end  
Better off as lovers  
And not the other way around  
Ex-friends till the end  
Better off as lovers
