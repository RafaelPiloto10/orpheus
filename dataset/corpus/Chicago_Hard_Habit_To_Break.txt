I guess I thought you'd be here forever  
Another illusion I chose to create  
You don't know what you got until it's gone  
And I found out a little too late  
I was acting as if you were lucky to have me  
Doin' you a favor, I hardly knew you were there  
But then you were gone, and it all was wrong  
Had no idea how much I cared  
  
Now being without you takes a lot of getting used to  
Should learn to live with it but I don't want to  
Being without you is all a big mistake  
Instead of getting easier, it's the hardest thing to take  
I'm addicted to you babe, you're a hard habit to break  
  
You found someone else you had every reason  
You know I can't blame you for runnin' to him  
Two people together but livin' alone  
I was spreading my love too thin  
After all of these years I'm still tryin' to shake it  
Doin' much better, they say that it just takes time  
But deep in the night, it's an endless fight  
I can't get you out of my mind  
  
Now being without you takes a lot of getting used to  
Should learn to live with it but I don't want to  
Being without you is all a big mistake  
Instead of getting easier, it's the hardest thing to take  
I'm addicted to you babe, you're a hard habit to break  
  
Can't go on, just can't go on, on, can't go on  
Just can't go on, on  
Now being without you takes a lot of getting used to  
Should learn to live with it but I don't want to  
Being without you is all a big mistake  
Instead of getting easier, it's the hardest thing to take  
I'm addicted to you babe, you're a hard habit to break  
  
Such a hard habit to break I'm addicted to you  
You're a hard habit to break  
Such a hard habit to break I'm addicted to you  
You're a hard habit to break  
Such a hard habit to break I'm addicted to you
