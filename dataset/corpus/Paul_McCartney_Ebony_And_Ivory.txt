Ebony and ivory live together in perfect harmony  
Side by side on my piano keyboard, oh Lord, why don't we?  
  
We all know that people are the same where ever we go  
There is good and bad in ev'ryone,  
We learn to live, we learn to give  
Each other what we need to survive together alive.  
  
Ebony and ivory live together in perfect harmony  
Side by side on my piano keyboard, oh lord why don't we?  
  
Ebony, ivory living in perfect harmony  
Ebony, ivory, ooh  
  
We all know that people are the same where ever we go  
There is good and bad in ev'ryone,  
We learn to live, we learn to give  
Each other what we need to survive together alive.  
  
Ebony and ivory live together in perfect harmony  
Side by side on my piano keyboard, oh lord why don't we?  
  
Ebony, ivory living in perfect harmony (repeat and fade)
