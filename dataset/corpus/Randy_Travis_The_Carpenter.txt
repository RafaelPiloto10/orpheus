He was just a carpenter by trade  
He learned from his father at a very early age  
There was something special in the man  
There was much more to his life  
Than just working with his hands  
And He'd say  
"There's no home I could design  
That would match the one you'd find, when you leave this world behind  
If you only took the time"  
  
[Chorus:]  
Love your neighbor like your brother  
Treat your brother like a friend  
Always turn the other cheek  
Help the weary and the weak  
Make the time for young and old  
And as your life unfolds  
Each kindness that you've shown  
Will be the nails and hammers  
As you build your final ladder  
In the manner of the carpenter of old  
  
You could feel compassion in his eyes  
Only fools that hurt him did not realize  
That he was speaking to us all  
The righteous and the mighty  
The silent and the small  
And He'd say "  
There's no home I could design  
That would match the one you'd find, when you leave this world behind  
If you'd only take the time"  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
He was just a carpenter by trade  
He learned from his father at a very early age
