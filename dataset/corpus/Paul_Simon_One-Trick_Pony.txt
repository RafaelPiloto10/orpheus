He's a one-trick pony  
One trick is all that horse can do  
He does one trick only  
It's the principle source of his revenue  
And when he steps into the spotlight  
You can feel the heat of his heart  
Come rising through  
  
See how he dances  
See how he loops from side to side  
See how he prances  
The way his hooves just seem to glide  
He's just a one-trick pony (that's all he is)  
But he turns that trick with pride  
  
He makes it look so easy  
He looks so clean  
He moves like God's  
Immaculate machine  
He makes me think about  
All of these extra moves I make  
And all this herky-jerky motion  
And the bag of tricks it takes  
To get me through my working day  
One-trick pony  
  
He's a one-trick pony  
He either fails or he succeeds  
He gives his testimony  
Then he relaxes in the weeds  
He's got one trick to last a lifetime  
But that's all a pony needs (that's all he needs)  
  
He looks so easy  
He looks so clean  
He moves like God's  
Immaculate machine  
He makes me think about  
All of these extra moves I make  
And all this herky-jerky motion  
And the bag of tricks it takes  
To get me through my working day  
  
One-trick pony, one-trick pony  
One-trick pony, one-trick pony  
One-trick pony (take me for a ride)  
One-trick pony
