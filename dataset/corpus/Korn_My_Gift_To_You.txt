Laying by my precious  
Not long ago  
Hiding behind the shadows  
Of your broken soul  
Why is it always you and something you can never have?  
Why did you you try to tell me?  
How could you be this way  
Your throat, I take grasp  
Can you feel the pain?  
Then your eyes roll back  
Can you feel the pain?  
Your racing through my veins  
Can't you feel the pain?  
Your heart stops beating  
Can't you feel the pain  
Like orgasms  
  
Can't you feel the pain  
I guess your life is dead  
Can't you feel the pain  
There you are my precious  
With your broken soul  
  
Forever my crotch take control  
Why is it  
You fuck up something you have always had  
Why'd you try to tell me  
How could you be so cold?  
Your throat, I take grasp  
Can you feel the pain?  
Then your eyes roll back  
Can you feel the pain?  
  
Your racing through my veins  
Can't you feel the pain?  
Your heart stops beating  
Can't you feel the pain  
Like orgasms  
Can't you feel the pain  
I guess your life is dead  
Can't you feel the pain  
Here I am, just a man  
Feeling the pain, gives me life  
Relieving us is my plan  
  
I'd anything to see through your eyes  
Just to see through your lies  
I hate you, Can you feel the pain?  
Can't you feel the pain?  
I hate you, Can you feel the pain?  
Your throat, I take grasp  
  
Can you feel the pain?  
Then your eyes roll back  
Can you feel the pain?  
Your racing through my veins  
Can't you feel the pain?  
Your heart stops beating  
Can't you feel the pain  
Like orgasms  
Can't you feel the pain  
I guess your life is dead  
Can't you feel the pain
