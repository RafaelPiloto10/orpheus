When I was p poor young boy at school  
Girls like you always played me for a fool  
But now a time has come to lay to waste  
The theory people have of getting an acquired taste  
You treated me oh, so senselessly cruel  
Oh, oh, baby, you were so senselessly cruel  
From the beginnings I suspected the worst  
And you didn't disappoint me  
It was just that you were the first  
Now, I wouldn't let you touch me if you were within a foot  
And girl, I'm never ever gonna get hurt  
Cause you treated me oooh, so senselessly cruel  
Oh, so senselessly cruel, oh, so senselessly cruel
