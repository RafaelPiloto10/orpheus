Three sons have I, and they  
Ride by my side. The fierce,  
The black, and the wicked are  
Their names we ride down my  
Enemies on their half-hearted flight.  
No voice of mercy no evangels of light.  
  
Mighty messengers heathens rage  
Witness our coming gods of the dead.  
I ride through the air  
I laugh as I die with powers of evil  
Dark knowledge is mine.  
The ride of the wicked.  
The 1st sin was trust.  
Kill without warning for blood now  
I lust.  
  
Strong winds magic mist  
To Asgard the Valkries fly  
High overhead they carry the dead  
Where the blood of my enemy lies.
