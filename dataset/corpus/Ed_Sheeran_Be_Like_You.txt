Unhappy days that left us on the floor  
And you breathe me 'til you're not feeling sure  
Everything will brighten up  
If we go to Brighton, I'll take you along the pier  
Everything will lighten up  
If you feel too frightened, I'll make it disappear, dear  
  
And darling, don't be nervous  
I'll understand if you'll let me go  
I did this on purpose now  
  
And when I'm missing you, I'll stop eating food  
And I'll squeeze into a dress so I can be like you  
And then I'll see your bitterness and why you're leaving too  
Maybe I'll put you to a test and say that 'I love you'  
I think that I love you  
  
And sunny days that left my skin bright red  
And you squeeze me 'til these thoughts leave my head  
If it gets too complicated,  
I'll keep up and be frustrated, can you see what's wrong?  
If you feel like you've been hated,  
This love's too overrated, see what's going on, on  
  
And darling, don't be nervous  
I'll understand if you'll let me go  
I did this on purpose now  
  
And when I'm missing you, I'll stop eating food  
And I'll squeeze into a dress so I can be like you  
And then I'll see your bitterness and why you're leaving too  
Maybe I'll put you to a test and say that 'I love you'  
I think that I love you  
  
Take me back to live at home  
And take me back to Albert Road  
  
Now I'm missing you, I've stopped eating food  
And I've squeezed into your dress so I can feel like you  
But then I saw your bitterness and why you left me too  
I thought I'd put you to a test and say that 'I love you'  
I think that I love you  
  
And I've stopped eating food  
And I've squeezed into your dress so I could feel like you  
But then I saw your bitterness and why you left me too  
Maybe I'll put you to a test and say that 'I love you'  
Now it seems you loved me too
