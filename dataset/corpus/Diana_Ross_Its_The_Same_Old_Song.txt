You're sweet as a honey bee  
But like a honey bee stings  
You've gone and left my heart in pain  
All you left is our favorite song  
The one we danced to all night long  
It used to bring sweet memories  
Of a tender love that used to be  
  
Now it's the same old song  
But with a different meaning  
Since you been gone  
It's the same old song  
But with a different meaning  
Since you been gone  
I, oh I  
  
Sentimental fool am I  
To hear a old love song and wanna cry  
But the melody keeps haunting me  
Reminding me how in love we used to be  
Keep hearing the part that used to touch our heart  
Saying together forever, breaking up never  
  
It's the same old song  
But with a different meaning  
Since you been gone  
But it's the same old song  
But with a different meaning  
Since you been gone  
  
Precious memories keep a lingering on  
Every time I hear our favorite song  
Now you're gone, left this emptiness  
I only reminisce the happiness we spent  
We used to dance to the music  
Make romance through the music  
  
Now it's the same old song  
But with a different meaning  
Since you been gone  
Now it's the same old song  
But with a different meaning  
Since you been gone  
I, oh I can't bear to hear it  
  
It's the same old song  
But with a different meaning  
Since you been gone  
It's the same old song  
But with a different meaning  
Since
