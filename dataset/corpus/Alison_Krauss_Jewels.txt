When He cometh, when He cometh  
To take up his jewels  
All his jewels, precious jewels  
His Loved and His own.  
  
Like the stars of the morning  
His bright crown adorning  
They will shine in their beauty  
Bright jems for his crown.  
  
He will gather, He will gather  
The jems for His kingdom  
All the pure ones, all the bright ones  
His loved and His own.  
  
Like the stars of the morning  
His bright crown adorning  
They will shine in their beauty  
Bright jems for his crown.  
  
Little children, little children  
O love their Redeemer  
All the jewels, precious jewels  
His loved and His own.  
  
Like the stars of the morning  
His bright crown adorning  
They will shine in their beauty  
Bright jems for his crown
