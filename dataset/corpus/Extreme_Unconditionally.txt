So tell me, what can I do  
That you couldn't see through  
From the very start?  
There is only one thing  
Yet to come from my heart  
  
Loving you, unconditionally  
Loving you, unconditionally  
That's what I want to be  
What you are to me  
  
Can you see why it's so hard  
For me to break apart  
From all the things I hold  
Closer to a heart  
That has grown far too cold?  
  
Loving you, unconditionally  
Something new  
To a heart yet not free  
That's what I want to be  
What you are to me  
  
And though it seems impossible  
When both of my hands are full  
That's the only condition  
That keeps me  
From loving you
