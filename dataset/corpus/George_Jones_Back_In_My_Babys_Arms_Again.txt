Written by D. Frazier and A. Owens  
The honey bees are gonna be hummin'  
Guitar strings are gonna be strummin'  
When I'm back in my baby's arms again  
Happy wheels are gonna be turnin'  
Flames of love are gonna be burnin'  
When I'm back in my baby's arms again  
(Chorus)  
No more tears are gonna be fallin'  
I done heard my true love callin'  
Open arms are waitin' yonder 'round the bend  
Rivers of honey are gonna be flowin'  
Big sweet flowers are gonna be growin'  
When I'm back in my baby's arms again  
The voice of love is gonna be talkin'  
Hand in hand we're gonna be walkin'  
When I'm back in my baby's arms again  
Big ol' swings are gonna be swingin'  
Water springs are gonna be springin'  
When I'm back in my baby's arms again  
(Repeat Chorus)  
Oh, honey  
Back in my baby's arms again
