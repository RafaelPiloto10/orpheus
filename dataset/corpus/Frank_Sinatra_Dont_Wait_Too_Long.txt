You are the summer and I am the autumn  
Don't wait too long  
Your song's beginning while mine's nearly sung  
Don't wait too long  
  
Fall is a lovely time of the year  
When leaves turn to golden brown  
But soon fall is ending and winter is near  
And the leaves start tumblin' down  
  
Why must the moments go by in such haste?  
Don't wait too long  
Winter is coming, I've no time to waste  
Don't wait too long  
  
So while my heart's gay and foolish and free and still can sing its song  
Share every precious moment with me, don't you wait too long  
  
[instrumental-first line of a verse]  
Don't wait too long  
[instrumental-second line of a verse]  
Don't wait too long  
  
So while my heart's gay and foolish and free and still can sing its song  
Share every precious moment with me, don't wait too long
