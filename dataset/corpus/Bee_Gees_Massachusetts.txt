Feel I'm goin' back to Massachusetts,  
Something's telling me I must go home.  
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts  
The day I left her standing on her own.  
  
Tried to hitch a ride to San Francisco,  
Gotta do the things I wanna do.  
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts  
They brought me back to see my way with you.  
  
Talk about the life in Massachusetts,  
Speak about the people I have seen,  
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts  
And Massachusetts is one place I have seen.  
  
I will remember Massachusetts
