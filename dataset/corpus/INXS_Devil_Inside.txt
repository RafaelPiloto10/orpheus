Here come the woman  
With the look in her eye  
Raised on leather  
With flesh on her mind  
  
Words as weapons  
Sharper than knives  
Makes you wonder how the other half die  
How the other half die  
Make you wonder  
  
Here come the man with the look in his eye  
Fed on nothing but full of pride  
Look at them go, look at them kick  
Makes you wonder how the other half live  
  
The devil inside  
The devil inside  
Every single one of us  
The devil inside  
  
Here come the world  
With the look in its eye  
Future uncertain but certainly slight  
Look at the faces listen to the bells  
It's hard to believe we need a place called hell  
A place called hell  
  
The devil inside  
The devil inside  
Every single one of us  
The devil inside  
  
Here comes the woman  
With the look in her eye  
She's raised on leather  
With flesh on her mind  
Words are weapons sharper than knives  
Makes you wonder how the other half die  
  
The devil inside  
The devil inside  
Every single one of us  
The devil inside
