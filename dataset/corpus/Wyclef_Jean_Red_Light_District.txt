Intro  
Yea, oh!  
Check me out, look  
It goes love, hate, pleasure and pain  
Four albums in the can and I'm still in the game (what up?)  
And last album, they don't like me to tell this  
Debuted at number one and sold more records than Elvis (shut up!)  
That's what they telling me, switch up your melody  
Through with misdemeanors, they trying to give rappers felonies  
So they can lock us up one at a time  
But true writers stay free in every one of our lines  
And if you not feeling I'm the cream of the crop  
I'll knock rappers off your list 'til I get to the top!  
Still you looking at a man that's financially stable  
Only nigga getting checks cut from four different labels  
That Pillsbury dough, women poke my guts  
Still I walk around the streets like I'm broke as fuck  
So if you see me in your town and I appear to be moody  
It's cause I'm thinking 'bout plans that's bigger than Serena booty  
Me and shaka still starving and looking for meals  
And heads up! Ludacris is almost out of his deal  
I'm over ten million sold, every album is crack  
And for now I'm bout to carry def jam on my back  
Mad rappers I hear you talking way down at the bottom  
Though I make big money, still handle small problems  
The rambling at the mouth, I don't play that shit  
I'm the best and I ain't really got say that shit!
