The photographer smiles  
Take a break for a while  
Take a rest, do your very best  
Take five, honey  
Five, honey  
  
You search in your bag  
Light up a fag  
Think it's a drag, but you're so glad  
To be alive honey  
Alive honey  
  
Hey when this is all over  
You'll be in clover  
We'll go out and spend  
All of your blue money  
Blue money  
  
Do do you do...  
  
Well the cameraman smiles  
Take a break for a while  
Do your best, do your very best  
Take five, honey  
Take five  
  
You search in your bag  
Light up a fag  
Say it's a drag, but you're so glad  
To be alive honey  
Alive honey  
  
When this is all over  
You'll be in clover  
We'll go on out and spend  
All of your blue money  
Blue money  
Blue money alright  
  
Do do you do...  
One more time  
Do do you do...  
  
When this is all over  
You'll be in clover  
We'll go on out and spend  
All of your blue money  
  
Blue money  
Blue money  
Blue money  
Juice money  
Loose money  
Blue money, honey  
Blue money...
