Hush now don't explain  
I know you raise Cain  
I'm glad you're back  
Don't explain  
  
Quiet, don't explain  
You mixed with some dame  
Skip that lipstick  
Don't explain  
  
You know that I love you and what love endures  
All my thoughts are of you  
For I'm so completely yours  
Cry to hear folks chatter, and I know you cheat  
But right and wrong don't matter when you're with me sleep  
  
Hush now, don't explain  
You're my joy and pain  
My life's yours love  
Don't explain
