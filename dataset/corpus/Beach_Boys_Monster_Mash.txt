I was working in the lab, late one night  
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight  
For my monster from his slab, began to rise  
And suddenly to my surprise  
He did the mash, he did the monster mash  
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash  
He did the mash, it caught on in a flash  
He did the mash, he did the monster mash  
From my laboratory in the castle east  
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast  
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes  
To get a jolt from my electrodes  
They did the mash , they did the monster mash  
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash  
They did the mash , it caught on in a flash  
They did the mash , they did the monster mash  
If you've ever seen a monster before  
Dancin' across the dance floor  
Don't be afraid, don't run and shout  
Turn around and help the monster turn it out  
Get down with the monster mash  
Get down with the monster mash  
Get down with the monster mash  
Get down with the monster mash  
And if you don't have core hard cash  
You can still do the monster mash  
The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds  
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds  
The coffin-bangers were about to arrive  
With their vocal group, 'The Crypt-Kicker Five'  
They played the mash, they played the monster mash  
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash  
They played the mash, it caught on in a flash  
They played the mash, they played the monster mash  
Out from the coffin', Drac's voice did ring  
Seems he was troubled by just one thing  
He opened the lid and shook his fist and said  
"Whatever happened to my Transylvania Twist?  
It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash  
The monster mash, it was graveyard smash  
It's now the mash, it caught on in a flash  
It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash  
Now everything's cool, Drac's a part of the band  
And my Monster Mash is the hit of the land  
For you, the living this mash was meant too  
When you get to my door, tell them Borris sent you  
Then you can mash, then you can monster mash  
The monster mash and do my graveyard smash  
Then you can mash, you'll catch on in a flash  
Then you can mash, then you can monster mash  
The monster mash  
Get down with the monster mash  
Get down with the monster mash  
Get down with the monster mash  
Mash
