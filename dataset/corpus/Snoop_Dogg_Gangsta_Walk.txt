Gang Gang Gang Gang Gang Gangsta (I'm a gangsta)  
  
I'm a mother fucking gangsta nigga  
I still make moves and smoke weed with thug niggas  
I love you niggas, my drug dealin' days in the past  
But I never hesitate to kick a dumb dumb niggas ass  
  
I call shots just like I was the last don  
you heard a TRU Records bitch that's mine  
My shits hot, not even all the ice in the North Pole  
Could make my mother fucking rhymes cold  
  
And I'm ghetto like a bitch tradin' food stamps for cash, huh  
I'm about to score another bag  
And I speak with a mother fucking slur when I talk  
And I still do that mother fucking gangsta walk

You know my apparel, double barrel with the hollow points  
My young homie in the back seat he swollowin' joints  
When the po-lice get after, we dippin' on three wheels  
Cup filled to the rim feather in my brim, headed to a party in the LBC  
  
No Limit Soldiers with the DPG  
When me and my homeboys step into the house  
All the bitch ass niggas start breakin' out cause you know  
They know whas up  
  
So we started lookin' for the bitches with the big butts  
Like her but she keep cryin', I got a boyfriend, bitch stop lyin'  
Punk ass hooker ain't nuthin' but a dyke,  
Suddenly I see some niggas that i don't like  
  
Cripped out ripped out flipped out they dipped out  
Soon as they found out who we all a-bizout

Sometimes I want me a bitch, sometimes I don't  
And sometimes I gotta bust a nut, and sometimes I won't  
Check it, from the crips to the bloods to the niggas sellin' drugs  
Yet niggas pimp hoes in the mother fucking clubs  
  
I'm the 'G' in gangsta  
The nigga that'll hang ya, the ship that'll sink ya  
And the bullet that'll bang ya  
I'm the hour in a clock, I'm the high on the rock  
  
I'm the last mother fucker you would ever want to stop bitch  
I'm rich, fuck rap, I'll preach then have your bitch ass workin for me  
I hit ya with a 187, I'll shank ya  
'Cause I'm a mother fucking gangsta nigga
