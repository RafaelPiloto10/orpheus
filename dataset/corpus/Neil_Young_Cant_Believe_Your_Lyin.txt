Daylight breaks and I go to bed  
And I find myself worryin' about things you said  
Oh honey, I can't believe your lyin'  
But you tell me things  
Things I know aren't true.  
  
You have changed my life  
In too many ways.  
  
Well, I lost my job thinkin' about you  
Now there's another man workin' in my place  
Oh honey, I can't believe your lyin'  
But you tell me things  
Things I know aren't true.  
  
You have changed my life  
In too many ways.  
  
You have changed my life  
In too many ways.  
  
Well, my money's gone and so are you  
My friends all tell me I have been a fool  
Oh honey, I can't believe your lyin'  
But you tell me things  
Things I know aren't true.  
  
You have changed my life  
In too many ways.
