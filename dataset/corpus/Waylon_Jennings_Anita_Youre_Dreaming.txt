Anita, come closer  
Stop crying and listen to me  
I guess it's too late now  
But somehow I must make you see.  
What we thought was our world  
Was only a dream world  
And we just can't go on like this  
Anita, you're dreaming  
Of a world that can never exist.  
  
Anita, it's over  
There's nothing that's left now to say  
Anita, you're dreaming  
And I know it's better this way.  
  
Anita, come closer  
And close your pretty blue eyes  
Your young dreams just can't be  
And somehow you must realize.  
And each time you're with me  
My conscience reminds me  
Of someone who's waiting alone  
Anita, you're dreaming  
And when you awake, I'll be gone.  
  
Anita it's over  
There's nothing that's left now to say  
Anita, you're dreaming  
And I know it's better this way
