You said you're overreacting  
You're reading too much into this  
If you think this is important  
Your sense of proportion has gone  
I said, really?  
  
Everything means something  
And something has occurred  
Everything means something  
All other meaning can be blurred  
  
You said we all can make mistakes  
It doesn't matter that much  
I said, really?  
  
Everything means something  
You see wrong our mistakes  
Common sense means something  
Not simple give you take  
  
Everything means something  
And something has occurred  
Everything means something  
All other meaning can be blurred  
  
You said, oh don't be so pious  
You're taking this all the wrong way  
I said, really?  
  
Everything means something  
And something has occurred  
Everything means something  
All other meaning can be blurred  
  
Everything means something  
And something has occurred  
Everything means something  
All other meaning can be blurred
