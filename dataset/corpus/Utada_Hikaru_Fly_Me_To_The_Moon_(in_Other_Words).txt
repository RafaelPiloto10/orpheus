Poets often use many words  
To say a simple thing  
It takes thought and time and rhyme  
To make a poem singing  
With music and words I've been flying  
For you I have written a song  
To be sure that you'll know what I'm saying  
I'll translate as I go along  
Fly me to the moon,  
And let me play among the stars  
Won't you let me see what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars  
In other words: Hold my hand!  
In other words: Darling, kiss me!  
Fill my heart with song,  
And let me sing forever more  
You are all I long for all I worship and adore  
In other words: Please be true!  
In other words: I love you!  
In other words: Please be true!  
In other words: I love you!  
Com'on, just take me to the moon... yeah
