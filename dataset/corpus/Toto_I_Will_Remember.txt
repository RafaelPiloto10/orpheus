I was born in the land of the sun  
And the tall green grass  
And I don't understand  
How all this has come to pass  
  
How we've come to surround ourselves  
In a sea of thieves  
In a land without learning  
Only the fools believe  
  
I went driving last night  
On a dark canyon road  
Had the sky to myself  
But I wasn't alone  
  
Had the pain of my lifetime  
For my company  
How did it end up like this  
For you and me  
  
When love breaks the promise  
The heart has to keep  
It leaves only truth here to find  
When the spirit is crushed  
And the hurt is so deep  
Between you and I  
  
Even when love has come and gone  
And our hearts have moved along  
I will remember  
There was a time we had the trust  
  
And that always was enough  
I will remember  
I will remember you  
  
As I open my eyes to one more day  
The wind burns my face  
As it whispers your name  
As it's pulling me forward  
  
It tears me free  
And the only thing left  
Is the tears for you and me  
  
'Cause when love breaks the promise  
The heart has to keep  
It leaves only truth here to find  
When the spirit is crushed  
And the hurt is so deep  
Between you and I  
  
Even when love has come and gone  
And our hearts have moved along  
I will remember  
There was a time we had the trust  
And that always was enough  
I will remember  
  
Even when love has come and gone  
And our hearts have moved along  
I will remember  
There was a time we had the trust  
  
And that always was enough  
I will remember  
I will remember you
