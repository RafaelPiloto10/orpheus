This day when you left me  
I realized how much you mean to me  
This day when you said goodbye  
I never thought that I would cry  
Our faultless dream that we used to do (faultless dream that we used to do)  
Now shattered and filled with sorrow too  
  
We can never go back to that dream again  
'coz I know my heat  
It will soon end  
  
[Chorus:]  
How could it be  
That our love can't be saved  
How can I say  
My love for you will forever embrace  
It's too late  
It's too late  
Our promised love has gone to late...  
  
This night when you left me  
I realized how much you mean to me  
This night when you said goodbye  
I never thought that I would cry  
Our faultless dream that we used to do  
Now shattered and filled with sorrow too  
  
We can never go back to that dream again  
Coz I know my heart  
It will soon end  
  
(Repeat Chorus)
