If you ever get the chance to go to Dallas  
Take it from me, pass it by  
Cause you'll only sing the blues down in Dallas  
Take it from me, don't go and cry  
  
[Chorus]  
And I'm leaving this town as soon as I can  
Gonna stop off for a while and see my woman  
  
People do you wrong down in Dallas  
I know well, they've done it to me  
Stealin' all your bread, they're so callous  
I know well, just look and see  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And people like me just can't be free  
The promo man won't let us us be  
If the people who knew could get away  
I'm real sure they'd leave today  
  
Now come on down and lose your mental balance  
Look at me, half crazy now  
Talkin' to chairs, strange and I know it  
Look at me I'm doin' in now
