Oh I'm waitin' in the darkness  
Hesitatin' in the darkness  
Follow on your shadows in the night  
I'm feelin' it's burnin'  
The point of no return babe  
Easy for two  
Baby it's so hard for one  
Princess of the night (of the night)  
I'm drownin' in the light (in the light)  
Princess of my dream (of my dream)  
Cross-fire of feeling  
Princess of night what have you done  
Baby I know our day will come  
Princes of night princess of day  
When the night will fade away  
Gotta date babe with an angel  
With a hot child of the city  
Follow all your shadows in the night  
Oh somewhere there is someone  
And two hearts beatin' as one  
Easy for two  
It's so hard for one
