I've got an unfortunate feelin', I've been beaten down  
I feel I don't believe and now the truth is coming out  
What they've taken is more than a vow  
They've taken your innocence and then they throw them on a burning fire  
  
All along they're sayin' mind your manners  
  
I caught myself believin' that I needed God  
And if it's hard for some we sure could use it now  
  
Try my patience, my patience tried  
This world's no longer good enough that makes me wanna cry  
  
All along they're sayin' mind your manners  
  
Silence save him  
  
Self-realized and metaphysically redeemed  
May not live another life  
May not solve a mystery  
Right around the corner  
Could be bigger than ourselves  
We could will it to the sky  
Or we could something else  
  
No longer sayin' mind your manners  
Always burning  
  
Self-realized and metaphysically redeemed  
May not live another life  
May not solve a mystery  
Right around the corner  
Could be bigger than ourselves  
We could will it to the sky  
Or we could something else  
  
Go to Heaven  
That's swell  
How do you like it  
Livin' Hell  
Go to Heaven  
That's swell  
How do you like it  
Livin' Hell  
Go to Heaven  
That's swell  
How do you like it  
Livin' Hell  
  
Livin' Hell!
