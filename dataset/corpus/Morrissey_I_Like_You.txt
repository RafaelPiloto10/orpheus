Something in you caused me to,  
Take a new tact with you,  
You were going through something,  
I had just about scraped through  
Why do you think I let you get away,  
With the things you say to me?,  
Could it be I like you,  
It's so shameful of me,  
I like you  
  
No one I ever knew or have spoken to,  
Resembles you,  
This is good or bad, all depending on,  
My general mood  
Why do you think I let you get away,  
With all the things you say to me?  
Could it be I like you,  
It's so shameful of me,  
I like you  
  
Magistrates who spend their lives,  
Hiding their mistakes  
They look at you and I, and,  
Envy makes them cry,  
Envy makes them cry  
  
Forces of containment,  
They shove their fat faces into mine,  
You and I just smile,  
Because we're thinking the same lines  
Why do you think I let you get away,  
With all the things you say to me?  
Could it be I like you,  
It's so shameful of me,  
I like you  
  
You're not right in the head and nor am I,  
And this why,  
You're not right in the head and nor am I,  
And this why  
This is why I like you, I like you, I like you,  
This is why I like you, I like you, I like you  
Because you're not right in the head, and nor am I,  
And this is why,  
You're not right in the head, and nor am I  
And this is why,  
This is why I like you, I like you, I like you, I like you  
This is why I like you, I like you, I like you, I like you,  
This is why I like you, I like you
