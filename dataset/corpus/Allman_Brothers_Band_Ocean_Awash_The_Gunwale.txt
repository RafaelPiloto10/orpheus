Our lives are hanging in the balance  
Or they're dangling by a thread  
A spark of life brought down from an angel  
To raise the stranger from the dead  
Once more we're cheating on the reaper  
With all the gypsy in our souls  
Cause I know there's a God up in heaven  
Who must love rock and roll  
  
Once again we sail home to Sarasota  
As the ocean awash the gunwale  
But she still keeps her head above water  
Guess we're all gonna live to tell this tale  
  
And here's to the you for always hangin' in  
Without you there's no reason to go  
I'd be lying face down in some river  
Waiting on an angel to take me back home  
  
Once again we sail home to Sarasota  
With the ocean awash the gunwale  
But she still keeps her head above water  
Guess we're all gonna live to tell this tale  
  
Solo:  
  
Once again we sail home to Sarasota  
With the ocean awash the gunwale  
But she still keeps her head above water  
Guess we're all gonna live to tell this tale
