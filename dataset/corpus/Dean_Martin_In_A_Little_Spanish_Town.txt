In a little Spanish town it was on a night like this  
  
Stars were peek-a-booing down  
  
It was on a night like this  
  
I whispered be true to me and she sighed si si si  
  
Man the skies have turned to gray because we're far apart  
  
Many moons have passed away and still she's in my heart  
  
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss  
  
Ah, in a little Spanish town it was on a night like this  
  
  
  
I whispered be true to me and she sighed oh si si  
  
Man the skies have turned to gray because we're far apart  
  
Many moons have passed away and still she's in my heart  
  
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss  
  
In a little Spanish town it was on a night like this  
  
In a little Spanish town it was on a night like this  
  
In a little Spanish town it was on a night like this
