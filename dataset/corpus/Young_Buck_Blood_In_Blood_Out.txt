Dis for all dem niggaz out dere jackin'  
This how we gon' put it down  
Dem gangsta niggaz from J.C. center court 12th, 3rd Avenue, my block  
Nigga, murder, murder mayne  
I come nake faceded, ain't no need for a ski-mask  
From neck down, I'm black down, eye to eye when I blast  
No question, I got the code  
Now how many bodies out there, take out before I reload, hit 'em below  
His fuckin' knees, before we leave, we gon' locate them ki's  
A nigga gotta eat, ya heard me?  
You know the player when we get there, kill everything in there  
Leavin' no clues, like we never even been there  
Life ain't fair but fuck it, it's a new year  
I'm grabbin' my strap, cockin' it back and boo-yaa  
We almost thay, lock down the spot  
Put your vest on punk, we in the parking lot  
One of them, all day killers, who's hard to spot  
Jackin' all y'all whether it's dark or not  
It's blood in, blood out and you know what I'm about  
I'm ridin' high, nigga, I'm ridin' high  
So don't get in if you ain't about it spendin' it big  
'Cause I'm clearin' the block, oh, I'm clearin' the block  
It's blood in, blood out and you know what I'm about  
I'm ridin' high, nigga, I'm ridin' high  
So don't get in if you ain't about it spendin' it big  
'Cause I'm clearin' the block, we clearin' the block  
We did our job, now we on the next mission  
The next victim, go on, see if the tec spittin'  
No bullshittin', see they don't know just how we livin'  
I'm goin' all out, I ain't scared to go to prison  
Make your own decision, it's gon' be a long ride  
I need the money, I can't wait a long time  
Keep a strong mind 'cause we done waited in a long line  
Just to get our shine on, now it's our time  
Believe that, it's our turn  
Pull out your weapon to burn, get what you earned  
We all must learn, that money is the key to life  
And niggaz gon' die if we ain't eatin' right  
It's blood in, blood out and you know what I'm about  
I'm ridin' high, nigga, I'm ridin' high  
So don't get in if you ain't about it spendin' it big  
'Cause I'm clearin' the block, oh, I'm clearin' the block  
It's blood in, blood out and you know what I'm about  
I'm ridin' high, nigga, I'm ridin' high  
So don't get in if you ain't about it spendin' it big  
'Cause I'm clearin' the block, we clearin' the block  
Who you know livin' right, ain't nobody spreadin' love  
Niggaz snow off that white, goin' out and sheddin' blood  
Life lookin' like my momma said it would  
Whether or not, I still ride for the hood, I'm on my block  
My niggaz they slang rocks, shoot it out with cops  
From J.C., the center court life's hard knocks  
Hold on, grab your glock, did you see the car stop?  
Which one? The black Benz with the top dropped  
Fuck 'em, the mac-10 with the infrared dot  
Represent how I'm livin', keep on drivin' down the block  
Oh, it's on now, let's take the back route  
Get your mac out, it's blood in blood out  
It's blood in, blood out and you know what I'm about  
I'm ridin' high, nigga, I'm ridin' high  
So don't get in if you ain't about it spendin' it big  
'Cause I'm clearin' the block, oh, I'm clearin' the block  
It's blood in, blood out and you know what I'm about  
I'm ridin' high, nigga, I'm ridin' high  
So don't get in if you ain't about it spendin' it big  
'Cause I'm clearin' the block, oh, we clearin' the block  
Clear the block, shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up  
Nuttin' but gangsta niggaz be clearin' the block  
Ay man, Rizin Sun and Buck
