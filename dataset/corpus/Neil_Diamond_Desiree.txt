It was the third of June  
On that younger day  
Well I became a man  
At the hands of a girl  
Almost twice my age  
And she came to me  
Just like a morning sun  
And it wasn't so much  
Her words as such  
As the way they were sung  
It was the way they were sung  
Desiree  
Oh, Desiree  
There I was found  
By the sweet passion sound  
Of you loving song  
Time was right, the night was long  
Remember, Desiree  
Oh Desiree  
Somehow I knew  
I could only have you  
'Til the morning light  
If only for that single night  
Sweet Desiree, you made it right.  
  
Then came the fourth of June  
On that sleepless night  
Well I tossed and I turned  
While the thought of her burned  
Up and down my mind  
For she was there and gone  
Without one regret  
But she continues on  
Like the words of a song  
I could not forget  
I could not forget  
  
Desiree  
Oh, Desiree  
There I was found  
By the sweet passion sound  
Of your loving song  
Time was right, the night was long  
Remember, Desiree  
Oh, Desiree  
And though somehow I knew  
I could only have you  
'Til the morning light  
The night was long, the time was right  
Do you remember, Desiree
