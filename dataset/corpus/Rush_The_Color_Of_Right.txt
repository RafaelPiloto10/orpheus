I don't have an explanation  
For another lonely night  
I just feel this sense of mission  
And the sense of what is right  
  
Take it easy on my now  
I'd be there if I could  
I'm so full of what is right  
I can't see what is good  
  
It's a hopeless situation  
Lie awake for half the night  
You're not sure what's going on here  
But you're sure it isn't right  
  
Make it easy on yourself  
There's nothing more you can do  
You're so full of what is right  
You can't see what is true  
  
A quality of justice  
A quantity of light  
A particle of mercy  
Makes the color of right  
  
Gravity and distance  
Change the passage of light  
Gravity and distance  
Change the color of right
