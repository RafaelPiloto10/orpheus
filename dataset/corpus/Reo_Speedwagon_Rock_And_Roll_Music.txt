Rock And Roll Music  
(Chuck Berry)  
Just let me hear some of that rock'n'roll music  
Any old way you choose it  
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it  
Any old time you use it  
It's gotta be rock - roll music  
If you want to dance with me  
If you want to dance with me  
I have no kick against modern jazz  
Unless they try to play it too darn fast  
And change the beauty of the melody  
Until it sounds just like a symphony  
That's why I go for that rock'n'roll music  
Any old way you choose it  
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it  
Any old time you use it  
It's gotta be rock, roll music  
If you want to dance with me  
If you want to dance with me  
I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks  
So she could her my man a, whalin' sax  
I must admit they have a rockin' band  
Man they were goin' like a hurricane  
That's why I go for that rock'n'roll music  
Any old way you choose it  
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it  
Any old time you use it  
It's gotta be rock, roll music  
If you want to dance with me  
If you want to dance with me  
Way down South they gave a jubilee  
Them country folks they had a jamboree  
They're drinkin' home, brew from a wooden cup  
The folks dancin' got all shook up  
And started playin' that rock 'n' roll music  
Any old way you choose it  
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it  
Any old time you use it  
It's gotta be rock, roll music  
If you want to dance with me  
If you want to dance with me  
Don't care to hear 'em play the tango  
I'm in no mood to dig a mambo  
It's way too early for the Congo  
So keep a, rockin' that piano  
So I can hear some of that rock 'n' roll music  
Any old way you choose it  
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it  
Any old time you use it  
It's gotta be rock, roll music  
If you want to dance with me  
If you want to dance with me
