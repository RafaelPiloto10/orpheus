Johnny was a good boy  
According to his mother  
But when she wasn' t looking yeah  
Johnny became a bad boy  
He got into drugs yeah  
Oh poor Johnny  
One day he double-crossed  
And it cost him his life  
She couldn' t believe it  
When she saw him lying  
On the ground  
In a pool of blood yeah  
Her only son  
Her only hope yeah!!  
Oh Johnny  
With her hands above her head  
She cried Johnny Johnny  
How can you do something  
Like that to me Oh she cried  
And said  
  
Chorus:  
Oh Johnny you broke my heart  
Oh Johnny you made me cry  
  
Her only hope her only boy  
Lying on the ground  
In a pool of blood  
She said Johnny remember  
How I raised you boy?  
You could have been a doctor  
You could have been a teacher  
Oh Johnny  
With her hands above her head  
She cried Johnny  
How can you do something  
Like this to me  
She said I took you  
To the best schools  
In the country boy  
Spent my last dime on you  
Johnny  
Thought you would be  
My shoulder  
To cry on Johnny  
  
Her only boy her only son  
Lying on the ground  
In a pool of blood  
She couldn' t hold back  
Her tears  
Oh Johnny  
With her hands above her head  
She cried Johnny Johnny  
How can you do something  
Like that to me  
Oh she cried  
  
Chorus till fade
