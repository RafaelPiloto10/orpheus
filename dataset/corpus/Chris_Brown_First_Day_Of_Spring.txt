When I Got Her Love Here  
Look What (What) I've Tumbled Upon  
The Woman That Sees Me (Me) For Me  
Not What I've Done  
You Give Me This (This) Bling Ba-ding  
I Give You My Time  
Girl You Make Me Feel Like Everything's Alright  
You're Sorta Like  
Hearing The Birds Churping In The Morning Light  
Or Maybe Even Recieving A Kiss Goodnight  
Girl You Got Me Believing We Just Might  
End Up Bein More Than Jus Two Friends  
  
When We're Together It Feels Ideal  
The Sunny Weather Puts A Smile Right On My Face  
So Why Would I Ever Turn My Back On What We Had  
Oh Girl  
You Always Bring That First Day Of Spring  
  
We Kept Things Friendly (Friendly)  
Without Crossing That Boundary  
Darling I'm Expressing  
Are You Listening?  
You Give Me That (That) Bling Ba-ding  
To Give You My Time  
Girl You Make Me Feel Like Everything's Alright  
You're Sorta Like  
Hearing The Birds Churping In The Morning Light  
Or Maybe Even Recieving A Kiss Goodnight  
Girl You Got Me Believing We Just Might  
End Up Bein More Than Jus Two Friends  
  
When We're Together It Feels Ideal  
The Sunny Weather Puts A Smile Right On My Face  
So Why Would I Ever Turn My Back On What We Had  
Oh Girl  
You Always Bring That First Day Of Spring
