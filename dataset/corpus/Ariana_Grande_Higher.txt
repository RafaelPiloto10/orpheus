(Hahaha) lalala uhuh  
Been runnin' 'round in circles  
Tryin' to find the end (end)  
Bumped into this shy guy  
While chillin' with my friends (friends)  
  
He's eyein' me, his eyes on me  
Makes my body weak  
He's bringing out the freak in me  
It's only been a minute  
Since you came in, and changed my li-ife  
When I get around you, I feel this spark igni-ite  
  
I got that fire, you got me open  
You dig it deeper, we take it higher x2  
  
Crazy what we're doin'  
Livin' lettin' go  
Ridin' havin' good times  
And no one has to know  
  
He's eyein' me, his eyes on me  
Makes my body weak  
He's bringing out the freak in me  
It's only been a minute  
Since you came in, and changed my li-ife  
When I get around you, I feel this spark igni-ite  
  
I got that fire, (fire) you got me open (you got me)  
You dig it deeper, we take it higher x2  
  
We got that jam, make them dance  
Make them lose their mi-i-i-i-inds x4  
  
I got that fire, (fire) you got me open (you got me)  
You dig it deeper, we take it higher x4
