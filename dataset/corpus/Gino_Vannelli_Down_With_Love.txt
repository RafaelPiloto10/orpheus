I must have been high  
I must have had plenty  
If she had one  
I don't know I might have had twenty  
Flat on my back with the wind out of my sail  
My friends all say I look a little skinny and pale  
I caught a nasty little bug  
One thing sure there ain't no cure  
When you're down with love  
My head's too hot  
My nose a little runny  
My family doctor  
Stuck me twice and stole my money  
Mirror mirror on the wall let me tell you what I see  
Some kind of strung-out fool staring back at me  
I need a miracle drug  
One thing sure there ain't no cure  
When you're down with love  
  
Enough to make a grown man cry  
Enough to make a mule comply  
Enough to make a made dog tame  
And give a man a good name  
  
One thing sure there ain't no cure  
One thing sure there ain't no cure  
When you're down with love  
Flat on my back with the wind out of my sail  
My friends all say I look a little skinny and pale  
I need a miracle drug  
One thing sure there ain't no cure  
When you're down with love  
  
Enough to make a grown man cry  
Enough to make a mule comply  
Enough to make a made dog tame  
And give a man a good name  
  
One thing sure there ain't no cure  
One thing sure there ain't no cure
