You might remember  
How it used to be  
3 and 9 could show you  
Any fantasy  
Parti-coloured pictures  
Now and then 3D  
No cheap nostalgia  
Conjured up by me  
Back to the old days  
Close to home  
Show me some new ways  
I'll carry on  
  
Whether making out or played out  
Three and nine make twelve  
I've a dozen reasons  
Lying on the shelf  
be feature back rows  
Filed away  
No point pretending  
Change is here to stay  
  
3 and 9 to 45  
Decimal romance  
If you've warmed to centigrade  
You stand a sporting chance  
I'm not so special  
You're a misfit too  
  
Why must they interfere  
In everything we do?  
Should we play safe now  
Or go all the way?  
Six and two threes now  
More I cannot say
