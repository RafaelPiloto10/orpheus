Turn another turn...  
  
Turn another turn, sp00l...  
  
I think therefore I am, familiar to most?  
How long did we eat the seed planted by our host?  
4 billion years between our ears  
Still hatred brings us many tears  
Still we judge each other...  
Why when were only looking for the same high?  
  
Grind time for old misconceptions.  
Roll out new scenery as per suggestion.  
Wont salute you. wont desert you.  
Wont be a prisoner of assumption anymore.  
  
Does language define us? is reality... words?  
How far do we appear to be...  
Is the measure of... scope. but...  
With our junkie soul, we face the need,  
Of natures planned dependency.  
Dont hold contempt for ecstasy  
Just... mourn the dead... on the (national) screen,  
Mourn the dead... on the screen, mourn the dead...  
On the screen, mourn the dead... while they scream!!!  
  
Grind time for old misconceptions.  
Roll out new scenery as per suggestion.  
Wont salute you. wont desert you.  
  
Sp00l  
Turn another turn!  
Turn another turn!  
Sp00l  
Turn another turn!  
  
Dont need persuading by the status quo.  
  
We can make changes.  
If we open up well see... the history they sell us  
Holds the structure firm, reinforce the mold.  
We need to strip it all away....  
And let the sp00l turn, turn,  
Another turn,  
Another turn.  
Watch it turn, watch it turn. what well learn.  
  
Grind time for old misconceptions.  
Roll out new scenery as per suggestion.  
Wont salute you. wont desert you.  
  
Sp00l  
Turn another turn!  
Turn another turn!  
Sp00l  
Turn another turn!  
  
Push away what theyre selling me,  
Realize what we need to be.  
Focus on a strategy to  
Open up our minds and then,  
Together... turn another turn.
