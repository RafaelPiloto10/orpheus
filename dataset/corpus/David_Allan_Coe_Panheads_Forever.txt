By David Allan Coe  
She's hard to get started  
She's always so cold  
In the mornings I find her -  
She's looking so old  
There's so many miles  
I've been down that road once or twice  
She's not much to look at  
When we ride through town  
But I know when the chips fall  
She won't let me down  
She knows how to run  
And she don't run around on her man  
She's a high flyin' lady  
She takes me where I want to be  
There's no other woman  
Standing between her and me  
I'll always be faithful  
And keep her 'til the end of time  
God knows I'll always love  
That old Panhead of mine  
I've seen fancy dressers  
And they've caught my eye  
I rode'em to ride'em  
Then I told them goodbye  
I flirted with Low Riders  
Sportsters and Shovelheads too  
I cussed her and beat her  
And kicked her to just get her started  
A couple of times  
God knows I'll always love  
That old Panhead of mine.
