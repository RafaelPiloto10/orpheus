Go.  
Disjointed we scare ourselves with all that we wanna be.  
Just got paid and now you're going, how long should you be?  
If I get scared, I just call you.  
And I, miss your glow as I unsettle,  
Oh I'll always feel, I'll always be.  
Right.  
  
One, two, three, four.  
  
So sell your suit and tie, and come and live with me.  
Leukemia, schizophrenia, polyethylene.  
There is no significant risk to your health.  
She used to be beautiful once as well.  
  
Plastic bag, middle class, polyethylene.  
Decaffeinate, unleaded, keep all surfaces clean.  
If you don't believe in it, sell your soul.  
If you don't get into it, no one will.  
Oh...... Oh........
