Just drive I'm sick of talkin',  
We know where this is going,  
I'm done take me home,home,  
I can't wait forever,  
For you to get yourself together.  
I'd rather be alone,  
  
I'm so tired of pretending,  
Just want a happy ending,  
  
[Chorus]  
Wish I could put a spell on you,  
Wish I could make you feel like I do,  
Wouldn't that be sweet so magical,  
Wish I could blink and wave a wand,  
Get everything that I ever wanted,  
And put a spell on you,  
And make it all come true,  
  
You taught me what I know,  
Guys like you come and go,  
But I know things can change  
  
See my heart it may be broken,  
But that wont stop me hoping  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I just wanna know what we should've done,  
Wanna figure out what we could've become,  
'Cause I know in my heart I'm not over you,  
I just wanna go back and try it again,  
Turn back the time this isn't the end of us,  
This isn't the end of us  
This isn't the end of us  
  
Whoa  
  
[Chorus: x2]
