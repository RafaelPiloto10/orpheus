Aint no cure for love  
Aint no cure for love  
There aint no cure for love  
Aint no cure  
Cupid was a blind man  
He must have missed his mark  
Shot an arrow in the air and hit me in the heart  
I went to see Saint Valentine  
Said Whats come over me?  
Daddy must have missed the chapter about the birds and bees  
You can be the King of diamonds  
You can cash in all your gold  
You could hire Johnnie Cochran  
Its too late to save your soul  
Don't need no shot, no ambulance  
Don't need prescription drugs  
There aint no cure for love  
They can find the cure for the common cold  
When the pushing comes to shove  
There aint no cure for love  
Now someone call my lawyer  
I'm going to see my shrink  
I found myself in the jewelry store buying a diamond ring  
I went to see my doctor  
Said Wont you help me please?  
He said Son I'm sorry, its a terminal disease  
Can't get no love insurance  
Cupid draws his bow  
I aint waving boys, I'm drowning  
Its a damn good way to go  
Don't need no shot, no ambulance  
Don't need prescription drugs  
There aint no cure for love  
They can find the cure for the common cold  
When the pushing comes to shove  
There aint no cure for love  
You can be the King of Diamonds  
You can cash in all your gold  
You can hire Johnnie Cochran  
Its too late to save your soul  
Don't need no shot, no ambulance  
Don't need prescription drugs  
There aint no cure for love  
They can find the cure for the common cold  
When the pushing comes to shove  
There aint no cure for love  
No aspirin  
No ambulance  
Or Voodoo you can think up  
Aint no cure for love  
Aint no cure for love  
Aint no cure for love  
Aint no cure for love  
There aint no cure for love  
Aint no cure for love  
Aint no cure for love
