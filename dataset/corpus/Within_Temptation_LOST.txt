My hope is on fire  
My dreams are for sale  
I dance on a wire  
I don't want to fail her  
  
I walk against the stream  
Far from what I believe in  
I run towards towards the end  
Trying not to give in  
  
She's lost in the darkness  
Fading away  
I'm still around here  
Screaming her name  
She's haunting my dreamworld  
Trying to survive  
My heart is frozen  
I'm losing my mind  
  
Help me, I'm buried alive  
Buried alive  
  
I'm burning the bridges  
And there's no return  
I'm trying to reach her  
I feel that she yearns  
  
I walk against the stream  
Far from what I believe in  
I run towards towards the end  
Trying not to give in  
  
She's lost in the darkness  
Fading away  
I'm still around here  
Screaming her name  
She's haunting my dreamworld  
Trying to survive  
My heart is frozen  
I'm losing my mind  
  
Help me, I'm buried alive  
Buried alive  
  
I tried to revive what's already drowned  
They think I'm a fool  
Can't realise,  
Hope plays a wicked game with the mind  
'Cause I thought that love would bind  
I cannot revive what's already drowned  
She won't come around  
  
She's lost in the darkness  
Fading away  
I'm still around here  
Screaming her name  
She's haunting my dreamworld  
Trying to survive  
My heart is frozen  
I'm losing my mind  
  
Help me, I'm buried alive  
Buried alive
