When the stars are in the skies,  
Make a wish then close your eyes.  
Are you dreaming,  
Angels singing,  
Everything is right.  
It's the magic of the night.  
  
Far horizons made of snow,  
Bring the hopes each child will know.  
Someone's dreaming,  
Bells are ringing,  
Everything is white.  
It's the magic of the night.  
  
High up in the sky, can you see a shining light?  
Can it be that we can see an angel who is flying, flying?  
  
Can an angel lose their way,  
Who of us on earth can say?  
Someone's dreaming,  
Angels singing,  
Everything is right.  
It's the magic of the night.  
  
High up in the sky, can you see a shining light?  
Can it be that we can see an angel who is flying, flying?  
  
When the stars are in the skies,  
Make a wish then close your eyes.  
Are you dreaming,  
Bells are ringing,  
Angels are in flight.  
It's the magic of the night.  
  
Angels are in flight,  
It's the magic of the night.
