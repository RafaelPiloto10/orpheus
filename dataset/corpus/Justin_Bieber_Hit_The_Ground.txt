[Verse]  
I close my eyes, I take it slow  
Lay on down and let me rest my soul  
I've been so high, I've been so low  
I'm just tryna find my way back home  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Can't help but roam  
My signal's gone  
Guess this journey's left me on my own  
I don't care why  
I'm alone, alone, alone  
  
[Chorus]  
And if I could  
Forget about the way you love me  
Forget about the world we set in stone  
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now  
If only I could hit the ground  
I never thought that I'd be broken  
I never thought I'd be this far from home  
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now  
If only I could hit the ground  
If only I could hit the ground  
If only I could hit the ground  
  
[Verse]  
I close my eyes, I take it slow  
Lay on down and let me rest my soul  
I've been so high, I've been so low  
I'm just tryna find my way back home  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Can't help but roam  
My signal's gone  
Guess this journey's left me on my own  
I don't care why  
I'm alone, alone, alone  
  
[Chorus]  
And if I could  
Forget about the way you loved me  
Forget about the world we set in stone  
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now  
If only I could hit the ground  
I never thought that I'd be broken  
I never thought I'd be this far from home  
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now  
If only I could hit the ground  
If only I could hit the ground  
If only I could hit the ground  
  
[Bridge]  
Take it one day at a time  
Reach for the stars now  
Ooh just leave the past behind  
That's a part of living, woah  
That's a part of living, woah, oh yeah  
  
[Outro]  
If only I could hit the ground  
Yeah, eh, eh, eh, if only I could  
If only I could hit the ground  
If I could hit the ground, right now, I would  
If only I could hit the ground  
If I could hit the ground  
Then I'd be falling down  
Yeah, woah if only I could hit it  
If only I could hit the ground  
If I could hit the ground  
Then I'd be touching down  
If only I could hit the ground
