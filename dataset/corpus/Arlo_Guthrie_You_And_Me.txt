Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
The sun is sinking down  
I'm standing 'round my window  
You say you're going away  
But I believe in love  
CHORUS:  
The power of love divine  
Will surely shine you'll see  
And guide us to where we ought to be  
You and me  
The moon is coming up  
And I'm still here in prayer  
You say you've had enough  
And that you just don't care  
CHORUS  
But while the stars are coming out  
And light shines from above  
You tell me in my dreams  
That you believe in love  
CHORUS  
The sun is coming up  
A rainbow on my window  
You say you're going away  
And even though you do  
The power of love divine  
Will surely shine you'll see  
And guide you home again to be...  
You and me
