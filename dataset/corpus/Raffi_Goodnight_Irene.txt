Foxes sleep in the forest  
Lions sleep in their dens  
Goats sleep on the mountainside  
And piggies sleep in pens  
  
Chorus:  
Irene goodnight, Irene goodnight  
Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene  
I'll see you in my dream  
  
Whales sleep in the ocean  
Zebras sleep on land  
Hippos sleep by the riverside  
And camels sleep on sand  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Coyote sleeps in the canyon  
And birdie sleeps in a tree  
And when it's time for me to rest  
My bed's the place for me.  
  
[Chorus:]
