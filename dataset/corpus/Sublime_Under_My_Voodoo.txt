Be it your guide is so much to love  
And you can hide your love its true  
It's the freedom game  
You can see it every day,  
Cause your freedom ain't free  
  
Come on down, I know how  
I'm gonna make you so feared.  
Don't you know it ain't no thing before  
So don't take more than you need  
It's somethin' that I'll do later,  
Now it's over  
It's not my fault  
  
Under my voodoo  
It's under my voodoo  
  
Pray that I leave you high and dry  
Pray you can make me cry  
If your faded, put it in my prayers  
I damn my feeling, I roll on  
I tell you the truth  
It ain't no thing  
If you want to get real dry, one thing though  
Gonna kill for it, more, more, it's not my fault, it's got me,  
And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone  
  
Under my voodoo  
Under my voodoo  
It's under my voodoo  
  
Lord, hey, voodoo  
Lord, hey, voodoo  
Lord, hey, voodoo  
What 'cho want to, want to, want to do
