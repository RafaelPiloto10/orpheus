All the world's  
A masquerade  
Made up of fools  
And philosophers  
Were it to rain  
On our charade,  
All washes away,  
Except for our true colors  
  
If any people bothered  
Looking for truth, please,  
Stop the world  
From spinning 'round  
Instead we choose to follow  
Footsteps of fools, please  
Stop the world  
From spinning 'round  
If nothing's new under the sun  
For me and you  
Won't somebody please  
  
Stop the world  
Stop the world  
I wanna get off  
Stop the world  
Stop the world  
Where there is love  
  
If we forget  
Yesterday,  
We're bound to repeat it  
Tomorrow  
It's not too late  
To start today,  
Better off safe,  
Than sorry  
  
Do unto those as you would  
Do to yourselves, please,  
Stop the world  
From spinning 'round  
We need more feet to walk  
In one another's shoes, please  
  
Stop the world  
From spinning 'round  
There's nothing new  
Under the sun  
For me and you,  
Won't somebody please
