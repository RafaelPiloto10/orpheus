Josie's gone now She cried a lot Had to go away And though I miss her I want
to kiss her Ain't it just the way But it's no way at all 'Cos if you knew what
I'm goin' Through you'd know That there's one thing wrong With the way I'm
living Ain't got no Josie no-more Hey mr. dream maker send me a dream This one
is over it's not what it seamed And so tonight when I turn out the light Send
me a new dream tonight, ooh She didn't say much Just a little touch And she
was on her way Ooh I could have cried then Instead I died then She left me
standing dazed But it's no use crying Well that's what everybody Tells me and
they all seem to know That there's one thing wrong With the way I'm living
Ain't got no Josie no-more Hey mr. dream maker send me a dream This one is
over it's not what it seamed And so tonight when I turn out the light Send me
a new dream tonight ooh, hey mr., ooh, hey mr. hey mr. dream maker mr. dream
maker send me a dream This one is over it's not what it seamed And so tonight
when I turn out the light Send me a new dream tonight aaahhh, send me a new
dream tonight Hey mr. dream maker send me a dream This one is over it's not
what it seamed And so tonight when I turn out the light Send me a new dream
tonight aah, send me a new dream tonight.....
