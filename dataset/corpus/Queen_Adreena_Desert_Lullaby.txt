How, how did I get here  
What world is this  
How, how did I get here  
What world is this  
Looking at forever  
The ivory bones did speak  
I walked the path to nowhere  
Found there's nothing underfeet  
Looking at forever  
This river's running dry  
The desert thirst  
Has done her worst  
She cursed my lullaby  
How, how did I get here  
What world is this  
How, how did I get here  
What world is this  
The midnight sun burns holes  
In the soles of my feet  
I kneel before you  
I say, please fuck me baby  
Looking at forever  
I cling to every limb  
Please hold me tight  
For the dead of night  
Prefers my suffering...  
How, how did I get here  
What world is this  
What world is this  
What world is this  
What world is this  
What world is this  
The midnight suns burns holes  
In the soles of my feet  
I kneel down before you  
I say, please fuck me baby  
Please, fuck me baby.
