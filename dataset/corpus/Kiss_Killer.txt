Her love is a gun, her love is a blade, she's a killer  
Bitch is insane, she deals in pain, she's a killer  
Ooh, she'll cut you clean, then she'll watch you bleed  
So obscene, she's what I need, she loves to hear me scream  
Black lace, stiletto heels, she's a killer  
Crack the whip, submission trip, she's a killer  
Ooh, cat in heat, mistress of deceit  
Nerves of steel, her next meal, she's searching for the meat  
She's a killer, stone cold killer, killer, stone cold killer  
  
Watch out for your jugular vein, she's a killer  
Animal with a twisted brain, she's a killer  
Ooh, she guarantees you'll suffer with desire  
Wicked queen, night machine,  
She'll make you walk through fire  
Killer, run for your life, killer, will she bite  
Killer, run for your life, killer, will she bite,  
Suck your blood tonight  
  
Killer, stone cold killer, she's a killer, stone cold killer  
Killer, stone cold killer, she's a killer, stone cold killer  
She's a killer, she's a killer, stone cold killer  
She's a killer, stone cold killer, she's a killer
