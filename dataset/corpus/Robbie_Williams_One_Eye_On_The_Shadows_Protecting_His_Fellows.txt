From sun up to the moon on his back  
Sent the villains to Hades  
A hit with the ladies  
A stallion in the sack  
You can't get your life back  
When right follows left Jack  
The more you see the less you know  
When others would leak it  
His service is secret  
Plays God when it's your time to go  
  
Queen and country safe and sound  
With villains six feet underground  
And no one knows cause no one's found  
Any trace of a man for all seasons  
Loves them and leaves them alone, so alone  
And you and I wouldn't have a clue  
Who's doing what, why, when and who  
Up the creek with no canoe  
Watch out for the man for all seasons  
Loves them and leaves them alone, so alone  
But safe at home  
  
From the House of Lords  
Saving Norfolk Broads  
Commoners and landed gentry  
His word is Bond  
Whether brunette or blonde  
Baby it's so elementary  
For the man never messed up your life with one stare  
See the film you'll know how it goes  
But this ain't no fiction  
Just check the diction quit pro quo a prose pro yeah  
Fellows  
Don't be jealous  
When they made him they broke the mould  
So charismatic  
Will on automatic  
Never prematurely shooting his load  
  
Queen and country safe and sound  
With villains six feet underground  
And no one knows cause no one's found  
Any trace of a man for all seasons  
Loves them and leaves them alone, so alone  
And you and I wouldn't have a clue  
Who's doing what, why, when and who  
Up the creek with no canoe  
Watch out for the man for all seasons  
Loves them and leaves them alone, so alone  
But safe at home
