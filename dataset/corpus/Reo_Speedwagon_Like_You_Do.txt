Well I've seen women who cross their legs  
Before they sit down to the table  
And I've seen women who look to the sky  
Screamin' Lord I believe in the Bible  
And I've seen hookers dancin' through Times Square  
With their heads held up so high  
But I've never seen a woman  
Who makes me feel  
Woah, like you do  
  
Well I've seen couples holdin' hands  
With that glazy look in their eyes  
And I've seen lovers rollin' round in bed  
Screamin' as if they're gonna die  
And I've seen lovers holdin' hands  
And then laughin' when their back is turned  
But I've never seen a woman  
Who makes me feel  
Woah, like you do  
  
Well I've seen women who cross their legs  
Before they sit down to the table  
And I've seen women who look to the sky  
Screamin' Lord I Believe in the Bible  
And I've seen hookers dancin' through Times Square  
With their heads held up so high  
But I've never seen a woman  
Who makes me feel  
No I've never seen a woman  
Who can make me feel  
Like you do
