Do nothin' till you hear from me  
Pay no attention to what's said  
Why one should tear the seam of anyone's dream  
It's over my head  
  
Do nothin' till you hear from me  
At least consider our romance  
If you should take the word of others you heard  
Baby, I haven't a chance  
  
True I've been seen  
With someone new  
That doesn't mean  
I've been untrue  
While we're apart  
The words in my heart  
Reveal how I feel about you  
  
Some kiss may cloud my memory  
And other arms may hold a thrill  
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me  
Baby, you never will
