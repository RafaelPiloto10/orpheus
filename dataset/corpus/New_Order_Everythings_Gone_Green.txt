Help me, somebody help me  
I wonder where I am  
I see my future before me  
I'll hurt you when I can  
It seems like I've been here before  
  
Confusion sprung up from devotion  
A halo that covers my eyes  
It sprung from this first estrangement  
No one have I ever despised  
Is this the way that you wanted to pay  
Won't you show me, please show me the way  
Is this the way that you wanted to pay  
Won't you show me, please show me the way
