Close the door on a short night  
Lift the lid on the daylight  
6: 09 West Tennessee time  
And I buy all my days  
  
At the same place where the girl sells her nights  
To a God of ocean tides.  
  
All night long,  
Writing poems to California  
Melodies of failure  
And the people I have thrown away  
Meanwhile, somewhere west of Carolina  
In a congregation of strangers  
We are digging holes to China  
Then we pray to our reflections  
In the water when it rises.  
  
I said headlights pin the highway down  
Jesus spins the world around  
And I'll spend all my tomorrows coming down  
Goodbye all my days.  
I know I said I never loved you  
But I might just try again tonight.  
  
Truck stops and river Gods  
Gas stations of the Cross  
Following a ghost,  
Following a ghost,  
I pray the water wash away  
The memories and the cost.  
  
Cary me south, to the sea  
Along with your memories of me  
We are born in the water  
Now we return to Thee.  
Colored lights  
And birthday cakes  
Candle wax  
On paper plates.  
  
Breathe the water  
Hush-a-bye, hush-a-bye.  
You can see through water  
All the way up to the sky.  
  
Gods of water, Gods of rain  
Cover up the sun again  
We are crossing it at the Mississippi line  
And I tried all my days  
To love you just the way you hoped I might,  
But I'm leaving here tonight.  
I can't remember yesterday  
I tried, if I said I could I lied.
