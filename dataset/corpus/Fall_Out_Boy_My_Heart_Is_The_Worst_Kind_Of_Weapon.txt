Spent most of last night  
Dragging this lake  
For the corpses of all my past mistakes  
Sell me out the jokes on you  
We are salt and you are the wound  
  
Empty another bottle  
And let me tear you to pieces  
This is me wishing you into the worst situations  
I'm the kind of kid that can't let anything go  
But you wouldn't know a good thing  
If it came up and slit your throat  
  
Whoa  
Whoa  
Oh  
Whoa  
Whoa  
  
Your remorse hasn't fallen on deaf ears  
Rather ones that just don't care  
Cause I know that your in between arms somewhere  
Next to heartbeats  
Where you shouldn't dare sleep  
Now, I'll teach you a lesson  
For Keeping secrets from me  
  
Take your taste, back  
Peel back your skin  
And try to forget how it feels inside  
You should try saying "No once in a while"  
"Oh once in a while"  
  
Take your taste, back  
Peel back your skin  
And try to forget how it feels inside  
You should try saying "No once in a while"  
"Oh once in a while"  
  
And did you hear the news?  
I could dissect you  
And gut you on this stage,  
Not as eloquent as I may have imagined  
But it will get the job done  
And you're, done  
  
Every line is plotted and designed  
To leave you  
Standing on your bedroom window's ledge  
And everyone else  
That it hits, that it gets to  
Is nothing more than collateral damage  
  
Take your taste, back  
Peel back your skin  
And try to forget how it feels inside  
You should try saying "No once in a while"  
"Oh once in a while"  
  
Take your taste, back  
Peel back your skin  
And try to forget how it feels inside  
You should try saying "No once in a while"  
"Oh once in a while"
