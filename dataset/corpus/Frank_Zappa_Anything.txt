(Ray Collins)  
  
For you, I could do anything  
For your love, my heart cries  
Take my heart, my love my everything  
For so long I've needed your love  
  
Oh, when, when you first came to me  
I-I-I-I-I doubted your love  
But now you mean everything to me  
And each day I love you more  
  
For you, I could do anything  
For your love, my heart cries  
Take my heart  
(Take my heart)  
My love, my everything  
(Take my love)  
For so long  
(Take my heart)  
I've needed you  
(Take my love)  
  
Take my heart  
Take my love  
Take my heart  
Take my love  
Take . . .
