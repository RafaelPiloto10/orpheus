You're walkin' 'round like a doll without a head  
You should be thinking 'bout how to give your love instead  
I've seen you lying and cheating your way  
Then you complain about what all of your friends say  
You shoot your mouth like you damn well own the world  
We always have to keep our little white flags unfurled  
Just try to finish the things that you start  
Stop thinking with your fists  
And start thinking with your heart  
Oh can't you see  
Oh what you could be now  
You never listen to me  
Oh you're like a gun turned on the world  
Things have to be attempted one step at a time  
You got to take that poison from your eyes  
You know the lights are going out in your life  
Your killing yourself with your own knife  
Oh can't you see  
Oh what you could be now  
You never listen to me  
Oh you're like a gun turned on the world  
You don't want a love you need a chaperone  
You want a first-class alibi  
You bore the pants off people on the telephone  
People are sick of your lies  
You better open your eyes  
You're like a gun turned on the world, like a gun  
You're takin' one step forward then two steps back  
Friendly advice gets treated like a heart attack  
You can drown in the shallow water of hate  
Get the sense before it's too late now  
Oh can't you see  
Oh what you could be now  
You never listen to me  
Oh you're like a gun turned on the world  
Oh can't you see  
Oh what you could be now  
You never listen to me  
Oh you're like a gun turned on the world
