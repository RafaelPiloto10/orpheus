You can run and you can hide  
You can tell me you're untrue  
You can play around with my feelings  
Say you found somebody new  
But there's one thing you can't do  
You can't stop me loving you  
  
You know I love you baby  
Why do you treat me this way  
I don't deserve this kind of treatment  
And I'd have been so good like a lover should  
And I'd have loved you anyway  
  
You can run and you can hide  
You can tell me you're untrue  
You can play around with my feelings  
Say you found somebody new  
But there's one thing you can't do  
You can't stop me loving you  
  
You're gonna drive me crazy honey  
Why are you so blind  
Cool, aw you think you're so cool now, baby  
But you just can't see all the love in me  
When I give you all the time  
  
I know I'm gonna be fine  
You ain't gonna pull my chain  
I ain't gonna change my mind  
  
How do you feel baby  
I bet you feel real tall  
Why did you leave your manhunt, honey  
When I give you love and it's not enough  
And you try to make me look small
