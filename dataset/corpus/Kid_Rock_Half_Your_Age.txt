Hey now darlin', you thought it was all fun and games  
Runnin' 'round, telling everyone why we're not together  
I guess you just had to feel important  
And I'm sure you thought I was just gonna sit back and take it on the chin  
But honey, I'm a songwriter  
And that darling is where you end and this song begins  
  
[Chorus]  
I found someone new who treats me better  
She don't bitch about things we ain't got  
When I sing this tune it don't upset her  
She's half your age and twice as hot  
  
Oh she wakes up every morning and she folds my clothes  
Doesn't care about the strippers dancing at my shows  
She knows that I love her so I just wanted you to know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yee haw!yeah!...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh she don't start trouble cuz she dont need drama  
She likes it in the mornin' and she loves my momma  
I'm her big poppa an she's my little rock n roll  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She's half your age and twice as hot  
She's half your age and twice as hot
