Layin' on my back  
In the newly mown grass  
Rain is coming down  
But I know the clouds will pass  
You bring me tea  
Say "the babe's a-sleepin'"  
Lay down beside me  
Love ain't for keeping  
  
Black ash from the foundry  
Hangs like a hood  
But the air is perfumed  
By the burning firewood  
The seeds are bursting  
The spring is a-seeping  
Lay down my darling  
Love ain't for keeping  
Lay down beside me  
Love ain't for keeping  
  
Lay down beside me  
Love ain't for keeping  
Lay down my darling  
Love ain't for keeping
