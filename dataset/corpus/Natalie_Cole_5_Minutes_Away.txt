Well, I've been a lot of places  
And I've seen a lot of things  
I met all kinds of people  
Including queens and kings  
  
Had my share of heartbreak  
Stabbed me in my back  
I cried to my friends about it  
And they talked a lot of slack  
  
But oh, what a revelation  
When much to my surprise  
Then came you, wonderful you  
Right before my eyes  
  
5 minutes away, 5 minutes away  
You know I been  
All around the world to find  
It was right at my door  
  
5 minutes away, 5 minutes away  
I found love, love  
Just minutes away  
  
Everybody's got a story  
And it ain't nothing new  
I'm talking to the one  
Who's been looking for love  
And it just might be you  
  
While you're running around  
Hanging all around town  
With a fool that ain't no good  
But that very special someone  
Could be right in your neighborhood  
  
5 minutes away, 5 minutes away  
You know I went  
All around the world  
Just to find it right at my door  
  
5 minutes away, 5 minutes away  
You see, I found love, love, love  
Just minutes away  
  
Times when love ain't easy  
It's a game that we all play  
And the prize that we pay  
Is sometimes much too high  
  
Take it from me and don't look too far  
Love might be in your own backyard  
There's a better chance to find romance  
Just by starting today  
  
5 minutes away  
You know I went  
All around the world  
To find it right at my door  
  
5 minutes away, 5 minutes away  
You know, love, love, love  
Could be minutes away  
I said, love, love, love  
Is just minutes away  
  
5, 5, 5, 5 minutes away  
5, 5, 5 minutes away  
5, 5, 5, 5 minutes away  
5, 5, 5 minutes away  
  
5, 5, 5, 5 minutes away  
5, 5, 5 minutes away  
5, 5, 5, 5 minutes away  
5, 5, 5 minutes away  
5, 5, 5, 5 minutes away  
5, 5, 5 minutes away
