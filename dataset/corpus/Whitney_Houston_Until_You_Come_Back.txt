I lost my heart a long time ago  
You made me feel like no one had before  
Boy, you made me love you  
Then you walked out the door  
See, I will not rest until you say I'm forever yours  
  
[Chorus]  
And boy I won't stop at nothing  
I won't give you up  
And you've gotta feel something  
I know I will not love again  
Until you come back  
Come back to my arms  
Till you come back to me baby  
Until you come back  
  
I don't care how long baby  
It's not important to me  
Don't care how far  
Love's never too far for me, oh no it ain't  
I just might be crazy, yes I am  
When it comes to my heart  
But I can not rest until  
The day we're no longer apart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To me  
Nobody plays with my heart  
You can walk away from it all, baby  
You can run but your heart can not hide  
'Cause it knows you belong in my arms  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To me  
Oh yeah  
Till you come back to me baby  
Come on home, come home  
To me
