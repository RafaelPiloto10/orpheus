Sure gets funny thinkin' 'bout money  
Makin' my daily bread,  
The more you make, the more they take  
You never seem to get ahead,  
You break your backs just to pay your tax  
Then you don't like the way that it's spent,  
Somewhere back we jumped the track  
This isn't what the governmeant...  
  
Bet my now I've made a hundred thou  
But I ain't saved a dime,  
The IRS came out best  
They got my money every time,  
  
It can't be fair when the millionaire  
Never has to give them a cent,  
Sad to say we've lost the way  
This isn't what the governmeant ...  
  
Then the war , don't know what for  
Somebody said it had to be fought,  
I'se sposed to go but I said no  
'Cause I'se afraid I might get shot,  
but here I am on my hands and knees  
scrubbin' in my dungarees  
I got burned but I finally learned  
This isn't what the governmeant
