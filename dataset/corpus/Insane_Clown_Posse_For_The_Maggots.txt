For The Maggots  
[Violent J]  
One for the maggots, pumpkin's light  
Everytime his crew gets into a fight  
If I somehow get stomped and kicked  
I'm coming for your ass with an ice pick, prick  
[Shaggy 2 Dope]  
One for the maggots, two for the bitch  
Three for the brick that smacks your lips  
'cause you's a sneaky creepy ho  
So don't fuck around no more, yo  
[Violent J]  
One for the maggots, weak as pits  
Who sell out they boys for a bitch they just met  
And then try to come crawling back  
Bitch, you can juggle my nutsac, ho  
[Shaggy 2 Dope]  
One for the maggots, punk, fuck you  
Trying to be like everybody that you ever knew  
Trying to be somebody that you not  
Bitch, that's how ya get shot  
And left for the maggots
