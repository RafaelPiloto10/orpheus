Come Hear The Moon Is Calling  
Witching Hour Draws Near  
Come Hear The Bell Is Tolling  
Mortals Run In Fear  
Prepare The Altar Now  
And Hear The Virgin's Cry  
Hold Fast The Sacrifice  
For Now It's Time To Die  
All Hell Breaks Loose  
Hell's Breaking Loose  
Unveil The Pentagram  
And Feel The Demon's Lust  
Come Watch The Holy Men  
Who Look On In Disgust  
Come Taste The Blood  
And Feel The Heat Of Satan's Breath  
Look In The Sky  
And See The Warriors Of Death  
All Hell Breaks Loose  
Hell's Breaking Loose  
Witching Hour  
Our Work Is Now Complete  
The Blood Runs Fast And Free  
And Satan Takes His Bride  
And Cries Out Blasphemy  
All Hell Rejoices  
At The Child That She Will Bear  
And Satan's Only Son  
Shall Be The World's Despair  
All Hell Breaks Loose  
Hell's Breaking Loose  
Witching Hour
