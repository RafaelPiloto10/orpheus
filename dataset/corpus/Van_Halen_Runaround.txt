Oh  
Oh  
That's right  
She don't like it when it's cut right  
And don't like me making future plans  
And don't want me trying to live it down  
She ain't about to give an inch of ground, no..  
Well she can take me for is a little ride  
Just as long as she drives me home  
Around the block, maybe once or twice,  
And then some loving, wouldn't that be nice, yeah!  
I want what I wanted  
Oh, what a fool believes  
I got her in my sights, but  
Just out of reach oh-oh  
Here we go Around, (round, round, round)  
Run-run-runaround, yeah! (round, round, round, round)  
Here we go around, (round, round, round)  
She's given me the runaround, yeah, ow! (round, round, round, round)  
I just love her keeping me hanging on,  
She knows exactly what I need  
And right down to the nick of time,  
I'm chasing love down a fine, fine line, ow!  
I want what I wanted  
Oh, what a fool believes  
I got her in my sight, but  
Just out of reach, oh-oh  
Here we go around, (round, round, round)  
Run-run-runaround, yeah! (round, round, round, round)  
Here we go around, (round, round, round)  
She's given me the runaround, oh, ow! (round, round, round, round)  
  
Yeah, hey, yeah!  
Ooh, yeah  
Ooh, ah, goes like this  
Listen baby ooh, ow, ow, uh  
Oh, man it's hard enough, yeah  
And you make it harder  
Fill me up and then I'm satisfied, own me  
She owns the time.  
Here we go around, (round, round, round)  
Run-run-runaround, yeah! (round, round, round, round)  
Here we go around, (round, round, round)  
She's given me the runaround, oh, ow! (round, round, round, round)  
Here we go around, (round, round, round)  
Run-run-runaround, yeah! (round, round, round, round)  
Here we go around, (round, round, round)  
She's given me the runaround, oh, ow! (round, round, round, round)

Pleasure dome  
Now I know none of this was planned, it all just kinda happened  
I got more than I wanted, but how is still a mystery  
Obsessed with this feeling, I trusted it, so I followed it  
I'm tripping and stumbling across the land, full of miracles  
Into a world so far from home, miles and miles from nowhere  
Rooms without doors open for me, oh no  
Taking me miles and miles from nowhere  
Oh (miles and miles), oh yeah  
Lost in this pleasure dome, lost in my own pleasure dome  
Oh man, I ain't got a clue, how you get out, or how to find this place  
I want my control back, but I'm afraid, I'll lose that feeling  
Lost in a world so far from home, I'm miles and miles from nowhere  
Falling inside my own pleasure dome, I'm miles and miles from nowhere  
Oh (miles and miles), oh yeah  
Lost in this pleasure dome, lost inside my pleasure dome  
  
Lost in a world, can't find my way home, miles and miles from nowhere  
Falling inside my own pleasure dome, miles and miles from nowhere  
Millions of miles, oh no, miles and miles and miles from nowhere  
Miles and miles and miles and miles, oh  
Lost in this pleasure dome, lost inside my pleasure dome, yeah  
Lost, lost
