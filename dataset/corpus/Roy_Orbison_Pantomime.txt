Well thanks a lot thank you  
Now I'm the talk of the town  
Of all the fools they drink to  
I am the king of the clowns  
I play the lonely joker  
I take what fun I can find  
I laugh when things aren't funny  
I throw away my last dime  
You're not mine so I waste my time in pantomime.  
It's pantomime.  
  
I'm ready for lonely fun times, yeah  
Loud music may dull my mind  
Black coffee and electric sunshine  
Get set for this pantomime.  
  
I-ay-ay-ay cry inside cause you're not mine  
I-ay die-ay-ay-ay inside cause you're not mine  
I pantomime.  
  
Laughing when I feel like crying  
Crying when I feel like dying  
You're not mine so I waste my time in pantomime  
Bring on the girls and the parties, yeah  
Guitars and drums beating time  
Be merry, be gay and hardy, yeah  
I'm set for this pantomime.
