I was walking along, minding my business,  
When out of the orange colored sky,  
Flash, bam, alacazam, Wonderful you came by.  
  
I was humming a tune, drinking in sunshine,  
When out of that orange colored view  
Wham, bam, alacazam, I got a look at you.  
  
Oh one look and I yelled timber.  
Watch out for flying glass.  
Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out  
I went into a spin and I started to shout  
I've been hit, This is it, this is it.  
  
I was walking along minding my business  
When love came and hit me in the eye  
Wham, bam, alacazam,  
Out of the orange colored sky  
  
Oh, one look and I yelled timber.  
Watch out for flying glass.  
Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out  
I went into a spin and I started to shout  
I've been hit, This is it, this is it.  
  
I was walking along minding my business  
When love came and hit me in the eye  
Wham, bam, alacazam,  
Out of the orange colored, purple striped, pretty green polka dot sky  
Flash, bam, alacazaaam,  
And good bye, good bye.
