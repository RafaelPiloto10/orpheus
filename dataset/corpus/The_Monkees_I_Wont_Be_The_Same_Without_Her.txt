Life is hard for me to touch now.  
I just don't enjoy it as much now.  
When she left, something inside of me died.  
And I won't be the same without her,  
No I won't be the same without her  
By my side.  
  
There's no end end to my sorrow.  
I'm afraid to face tomorrow.  
When she left, she took much more than my pride.  
And I won't be the same without her,  
No I won't be the same without her  
By my side.  
  
It isn't easy to forget her,  
And the way it used to be.  
She changed my life the day I met her.  
And I won't be the same without her,  
No I won't be the same without her  
Close to me.  
  
Life is hard for me to touch now.  
I just don't enjoy it as much now.  
When she left, something inside of me died.  
And I won't be the same without her,  
No I won't be the same without her  
By my side.
