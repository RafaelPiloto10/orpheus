I once had an ice cube  
Purty little ice cube  
Now it's gone  
Now it's gone  
  
Her name was Mary  
Purty little ice cube  
Now she's gone  
Now she's gone  
  
She was so shiny,  
My Purty little ice cube  
Now she's gone  
Where she gone?  
She's gone with the others  
The shiny little ice cubes  
Movin' on. Movin' on.  
  
She's gone  
Doesn't nothin' ever last forever?  
  
I miss my ice cube  
Purty little ice cube  
Since she's withdrawn  
  
I held her in my hand  
My chilly little ice cube  
Was it wrong? Was it wrong?  
  
She slipped away  
My moist little ice cube  
To oblivion, oblivion  
  
She left me standing  
With tears on my face  
On the lawn  
So I wrote this song  
  
Purty little ice cube  
Where have you gone?  
  
Doesn't nothing ever last forever?  
  
Now she's gone  
Nothing ever lasts forever  
  
Doesn't nothing ever last forever?  
  
It's been declared  
That it's not wise  
To prize something too much  
I just wish to find something to  
Flaunt the right to  
Touch so gently  
  
Doesn't nothing ever last forever?
