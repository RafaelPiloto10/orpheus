Some fine day we'll live  
Together, give together.  
One fine day,  
A time beyond our time.  
Come that day we'll make  
It if we're strong,  
So help it along, help it along,  
Help it along.  
Please don't laugh at me  
When I tell you  
I believe in love,  
'cause it's still  
The only thing that  
There is too little of.  
And it's a long time coming,  
But come I'm sure it will  
And just in time  
The world will rhyme on  
The far side of a hill.  
On some fine......  
....... help it along.
