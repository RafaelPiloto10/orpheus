She moves like and angel  
And seven evening stars  
Dance through the window  
Of her universal house  
  
He voice a crystal echo  
Lies humming in your soul  
So patiently awaiting  
For your ears to behold  
  
She ripples on the water  
Leaves diamonds on the shore  
And fish from every distance  
Watch her ocean cellar door  
Her breath a warm fire  
In every lovers heart  
A mistress to magicians  
And a dancer to the gods  
And a dancer to the gods  
  
Her clothes are made of rainbows  
And twenty thousand tears  
Shine through the spaces  
Of her golden ochre hair  
Ooh my babe I want you  
And on my life I swear  
My conscience will I follow you forever  
If you meet me everywhere  
Yes if you if you meet me everywhere
