My father always promised me  
That we would live in France  
We'd go boating on the Seine  
And I would learn to dance  
  
We lived in Ohio then  
He worked in the mines  
On his dreams like boats  
We knew we would sail in time  
  
All my sisters soon were gone  
To Denver and Cheyenne  
Marrying their grownup dreams  
The lilacs and the man  
  
I stayed behind the youngest still  
Only danced alone  
The colors of my father's dreams  
Faded without a sound  
  
And I live in Paris now  
My children dance and dream  
Hearing the ways of a miner's life  
In words they've never seen  
  
I sail my memories of home  
Like boats across the Seine  
And watch the Paris sun  
As it sets in my father's eyes again
