I'm crazy 'bout you baby, my my my  
You love just drives me crazy, heaven knows  
Why  
So let me love you while, the moon's still high  
Guarantee you we'll have a good time  
Making love under the stars  
  
I feel the earth move when I'm in your arms  
Got the river Nile in my veins  
And when you're with me, darling I could be  
The white rabbit falling into space  
Look at him go  
  
I crazy 'bout you baby, my my my  
You love just drives me cuckoo, heaven knows  
Why  
So let me love you while, the moon's still high  
Let yourself go and have a good time  
Making love under the stars  
  
I see the lights dance when we're holding hands  
It's like magic being with you  
And when I'm dogged out, I still dream about  
All the simple things that you do  
All the little things  
  
I crazy 'bout you baby, my my my  
You love just drives me crazy, heaven knows  
Why  
So let me love you while, the moon's still high  
Let yourself go and have a good time  
Making love under the stars
