There's too many people  
Planning your downfall  
When your spirit's on trial  
These nights can be frightening  
Sleep transports sadness  
To some other mid-brain  
And somebody here  
Will not be here next year  
So you stand by the board  
Full of fear and intention  
And, if you think that they're listening  
Well, you've got to be joking  
Oh, you understand change  
And you think it's essential  
But when your profession  
Is humiliation  
Say the wrong word to our children...  
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you  
Lay a hand on our children  
And it's never too late to have you  
Mucus on your collar  
A nail up through the staff chair  
A blade in your soap  
And you cry into your pillow  
To be finished would be a relief  
To be finished would be a relief  
To be finished would be a relief  
To be finished would be a relief  
To be finished would be a relief  
To be finished would be a relief  
Say the wrong word to our children...  
We'll have you, oh yes, we'll have you  
Lay a hand on our children  
And it's never too late to have you  
To be finished would be a relief  
To be finished would be a relief  
To be finished would be a relief  
To be finished would be a relief  
To be finished would be a relief  
To be finished would be a relief  
  
I'm very glad the spring has come  
The sun shines out so bright  
All the birds that are on the trees  
Are singing for delight
