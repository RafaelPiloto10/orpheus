Every time we speak, our words betray intentions  
Insincere inventions that never quite reach the heart  
So we turn the other cheek and gather our defenses  
Again rebuild the fences that just been keeping us apart  
  
Waiting out the worst, we keep the best inside us  
In hopes our hearts can hide us, in hopes our tears don't show  
And you know we're not the first to try and breach the distance  
And though we meet resistance the love between us grows  
  
And in the time it takes us to look beyond the lies  
We could be sailing through each other's eyes  
And in those stolen moments when love is caught off guard  
We see it never had to be this hard
