If you find yourself looking for someone  
To make good the bad things that you've done  
Now do you think you're looking straight ahead  
And will you find the answer when you're dead  
  
Well then you should listen now to me  
And I'll tell you how I think it should be  
No one tells you why you're here to live  
And this is why it's you who must forgive  
  
No! You can't kill your brother  
No! Because you love each other  
No! You can't steal his pennies  
No! 'Cause you didn't leave him any  
  
Ah  
Ah  
Ah  
Ah  
  
And if reason tells you not to live  
But you feel there's something left to give  
You can't leave this place until it's done  
So you'll see one more rising of the sun  
  
Sun  
Sun, you're just gonna see it one more time  
Sun, oh you can't get away from it  
Sun, you're gonna see it, oh just one more time, Oh
