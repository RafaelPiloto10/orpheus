Give me liberty or give me death  
No truer words have ever been said  
Well are you prepared for your very last breath?  
Don't you dare start what you cannot finish  
So when we face, face the adversary  
No longer are we the minority  
  
And when history repeats her hour  
The pendulum will swing, swing into power  
Though not in vain like our forefathers  
Freedom, never had no room for cowards  
  
For in the end, there will be equality  
By any means necessary  
  
The ballot or the bullet  
The choice is up to you  
The ballot or the bullet  
Tell me what you gonna do  
The sword or the pen  
Can be held by the same hand  
  
What's it gonna take to liberate?  
An emancipation, a false proclamation?  
All these token words that you legislate  
Sound a little bit absurd. Hey! And a little too late  
  
When a house is divided, it just will not stand  
Once it's decided, a line drawn in the sand  
  
Ah! The ballot or the bullet  
The choice is up to you  
The ballot or the bullet  
Tell me what you gonna do  
The sword or the pen  
Can be held by the same hand  
  
The ballot or the bullet  
The choice is up to you  
The ballot or the bullet  
Tell me what you gonna do  
  
The ballot or the bullet  
The choice is up to you  
The ballot or the bullet  
Tell me what you gonna do  
The sword or the pen can be  
The sword or the pen can be  
The sword or the pen can be  
The sword or the pen can be  
The sword or the pen can be  
Held, held by the same hand!
