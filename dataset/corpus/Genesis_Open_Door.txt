I see your smiling face, by the open door  
There's the morning light  
Shining in your hair, and in your eyes  
  
And just a little way behind that smile of yours  
I see another one, oh so far away  
If only for one second, I could hold you close to me  
When the Master calls for me again  
There's nothing I can say, or I can do  
  
Goodbye, my love  
Time has come to say farewell  
I hear the call again  
Goodbye to the world  
I've shouted for so long  
Oh there's so much my love, that I can never say  
  
And in a little while, in a little while  
There's nothing left to see  
  
As the years go by and I have not returned  
And the night has come, falling all around  
Ooh if you count the stars you'll know  
How many have gone out  
And when the Master calls for me again  
There's nothing that I can say  
Or I can do  
  
Stand in the sun  
Shut your eyes and feel the world  
It's changing every day  
Goodbye my love  
Each day will seem so long  
Ooh there's so much I feel, that I can never say  
  
I can't see you  
I can't feel you anymore  
I've just a memory of that open door
