Heartaches  
You know my heart aches  
Every time I think of you  
Lonesome  
I'm on my own some  
Yes, I could loan some  
Tears for you  
Daybreak  
Another day break  
And I wonder  
How I got through  
You know sleepin'  
I'm only sleepin'  
In between my weepin'  
Tears for you  
  
You know that one night  
One night can be such a long night  
At midnight  
I know all the stars by name  
But it's alright  
I'll get myself together  
Nothin' lasts forever  
I'll just play another game  
  
Because mistakes  
Everyone makes mistakes  
Can one kiss make  
Dreams come true  
Nice try  
I'll just say goodbye  
Let someone else cry  
Tears for you  
  
Tears for you  
Tears for you  
Tears for you  
Tears for you
