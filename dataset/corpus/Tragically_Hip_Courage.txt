Watch the band through a bunch of dancers  
Quickly, follow the unknown with something more familiar.  
Quickly something familiar  
Courage, my word it didn't come it doesn't matter  
  
Sleepwalk, so fast asleep in a motel  
That has the lay of home and piss on all of your  
Background and piss on all your surroundings  
Courage, my word, it didn't come, it doesn't matter  
Courage, it couldn't come at a worse time  
  
So there's no simple explanation  
For anything important any of us do  
And yeah the human tragedy  
Consists in the necessity  
Of living with the consequences  
Under pressure, under pressure.  
Courage, my word, it didn't come, it doesn't matter,  
Courage, it couldn't come at a worse time.
