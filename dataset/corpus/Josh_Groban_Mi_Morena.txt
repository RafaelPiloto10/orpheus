And so my love  
From my window I can see  
A beautiful vision  
And when the music plays  
Your body rises like a bird of grace  
  
[Chorus]  
Mi morena  
I saw you dancing in the rain  
Holy water  
Shining like a silver flame  
Come like a ghost  
I will watch you dance alone  
Mi morena  
You're the light within my soul  
  
And so my love  
The way you're moving in your dress  
To a nylon guitar  
On wings of silk and lace  
You lift upon the notes and slip away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Take this cross of feathers and bone  
Take this heart I've carved into stone  
In your name  
  
Where the setting sun surrenders to the moon  
Mi querida  
I will wait for you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mi morena  
Hold your hands out to the light  
Be my lover  
I will fall into your eyes  
Sweet fire of love  
For you I'd steal the stars  
'Cause I adore you  
O my morena
