My, my, my, my  
Don't you worry 'bout what's on your mind (oh my)  
I'm in no hurry I can take my time (oh my)  
I'm going red and my tongue's getting tied (tongues' getting tied)  
Climb over here 'cause my mouth's getting dry  
I'm high, but I try, try, try (oh my)  
Let's spend the night together  
Now I need you more than ever  
Let's spend the night together now  
  
I feel so strong that I can't disguise (oh my)  
Let's spend the night together  
But I just can't apologize (oh no)  
Let's spend the night together  
Don't hang me up and don't let me down (don't let me down)  
We could have fun just foolin' around, around and around  
Oh my, my  
Let's spend the night together  
Now I need you more than ever  
Let's spend the night together  
  
Let's spend the night together  
Now I need you more than ever  
  
You know I'm smiling baby  
You need some guiding baby  
I'm just deciding baby, now  
I need you more than ever  
Let's spend the night together  
Let's spend the night together now  
  
This doesn't happen to me everyday (oh my)  
Let's spend the night together  
No excuses offered anyway (oh my)  
Let's spend the night together  
I'll satisfy your every need (your every need)  
And I now know you will satisfy me  
Oh my, my, my, my, my  
Let's spend the night together  
Now I need you more than ever  
Let's spend the night together now (oh my my my my my my)  
Let's spend the night together  
Now I need ya, need ya more than ever (oh my)  
Let's spend the night together  
I satisfy your every need (whoa my)  
Let's spend the night together  
Now I know, I know you satisfy me (whoa my) Let's spend the night together  
I beg ya baby... (Let's spend the night together)
