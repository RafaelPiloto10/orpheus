Well, I was feeling kinda lonely, just a little bit blue  
All I wanted was someone to talk to  
I wasn't looking for love or a do romance  
I had no intention of taking that big chance  
Until she walked in, in that low-cut dress  
She was a first class ticket on Heartbreak Express  
  
Well, punch my ticket, I'm headin' on down the line  
First stop misery, here I go one more time  
Destination dead ahead, ain't that loneliness  
I got a first class ticket on Heartbreak Express  
  
Well, I ought a know better, you think I'm learned  
But if you're gonna chase fire, you're gonna get burned!  
Yeah, I was still gettin' over the hurtin' from the one before  
She walked in right through that ballroom door  
I ain't never been one to settle for second best  
I want a first class ticket on Heartbreak Express  
  
Well, punch my ticket, I'm headin' on down the line  
First stop misery, here I go one more time  
Destination dead ahead ain't that loneliness  
I got a first class ticket on Heartbreak Express  
  
Punch my ticket, I'm headin' on down the line  
First stop misery, here I go one more time  
Destination dead ahead, ain't that loneliness  
I got a first class ticket on Heartbreak Express  
  
I got a first class ticket on Heartbreak Express  
I got a first class ticket, Heartbreak Express  
I got a first class ticket on a Heartbreak Express  
I got a first class ticket, Heartbreak Express
