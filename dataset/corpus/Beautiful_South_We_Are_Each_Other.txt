There's no more little secrets we haven't yet disclosed  
We bore the living daylights of anyone too close  
And all our cards at Christmas are written to us both  
Count them up who's got the most?  
  
Said we'd be close  
Said we'd work perfectly  
Said that we'd toast  
Beautiful company  
  
Closer than a sister to her baby brother  
Closer than a cat to the child that she'll smother  
It's too close for a lover  
It's too close for a lover  
We are each other  
We are each other  
  
We've been through all positions and this one's definitely best  
You move Middle East and I'll move Wild West  
What happened to our friendship we could easily have guessed  
Add it up we're self-possessed  
  
Said we'd be true  
Said we'd be so so proud  
Just me an you  
We'd shout it out aloud  
  
Closer than a sister to her baby brother  
Closer than a cat to the child that she'll smother  
It's too close for a lover  
It's too close for a lover  
We are each other  
We are each other  
  
Remember we went shopping and we went by piggyback  
I shaved all my legs and you grew hairs upon your back  
Well no-one's ever been since to this lover's shack  
It's a cul-de-sac  
  
Said we'd be close  
Said we'd work perfectly  
Said that we'd toast  
Beautiful company  
  
Said we'd be true  
Said we'd be so so proud  
Just me an you  
We'd shout it out aloud  
  
Closer than a sister to her baby brother  
Closer than a secret agent working under cover  
It's too close for a lover  
It's too close for a lover  
We are each other  
We are each other
