It's alright for some but not alright for me  
When the one that I'm lovin' slips around  
You think it's fine to do things I cannot see  
And you're doin' it to me, baby, can't you see  
That I know how it is?  
I can see it in your eyes  
And feel it in the way you kiss my lips  
I can hear it in your voice  
Whenever we are talking like this  
I can see what you believe in  
When his name is mentioned and I die  
I can watch the way you walk, the way you talk  
The way you close your eyes  
It's alright for some, but not alright to be  
Where the one that I'm lovin' can't be found  
The city where we live, might be quite large  
But the circle is small, why not tell us all  
And then all of us will know?  
I can see it in your eyes  
And feel it in the way you kiss my lips  
I can hear it in your voice  
Whenever we are talking like this  
I can see what you believe in  
When his name is mentioned and I die  
I can watch the way you walk, the way you talk  
The way you close your eyes  
It's alright to leave, but not alright to lie  
When you come home and you can't say where you've been  
You think it's fine to do, things I cannot see  
And you're doin' it to me, baby, can't you see  
That I know how it is?  
I can see it in your eyes  
And feel it in the way you kiss my lips  
I can hear it in your voice  
Whenever we are talking like this  
I can see what you believe in  
When his name is mentioned and I die  
I can watch the way you walk, the way you talk  
The way you close your eyes  
I can see it in your eyes  
And feel it in the way you kiss my lips  
I can hear it in your voice  
Whenever we are talking like this  
I can see what you believe in  
When his name is mentioned and I die
