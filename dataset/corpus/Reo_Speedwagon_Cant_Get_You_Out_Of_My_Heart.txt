[Chorus]  
Can't get you out of my heart, can't get you out of my soul  
When I get next to you, all I get is out of control  
Can't get you out of my head, I've memorized every word you ever said  
You've been here from the start, can't get you out of my heart  
  
Sometimes I feel like breakin' up with you  
I'm tired of bein' true, tired of bein' blue  
Still you're the one I give my best love to  
No other girl would do the things to me you do, and I  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sometimes I think I might be better off free  
No strings attached to me, yeah that's how it should be  
But just about the time that I get goin'  
You read me like a poem, you keep me comin' home, and I  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I look at you sometimes, I see the woman I love  
But I can be so blind, the good times I sometimes lose sight of  
  
[Chorus: x3]
