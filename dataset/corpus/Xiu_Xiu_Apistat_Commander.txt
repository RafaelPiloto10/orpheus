All  
All along the rocks  
It's good  
It's not so hard now  
  
I  
I bite my tongue  
Who cares?  
There's chance to draw on  
  
Once you left, you left for someone  
All that's left has wilted up  
Oh this relief, it's the hardest thing  
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God  
  
Once you left, you left for someone  
All that's left has wilted up  
Oh this relief, it's the hardest thing  
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God  
  
Children  
He'll never come  
I know it's written  
I lost my thumb  
  
He  
Could talk me down  
Still lost it  
It's just her goal  
  
Once you left, you left for someone  
All that's left has wilted up  
Oh this relief, it's the hardest thing  
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God  
  
Once you left, you left for someone  
All that's left has wilted up  
Oh this relief, it's the hardest thing  
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God  
  
Once you left, you left for someone  
All that's left has wilted up  
Oh this relief, it's the hardest thing  
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God
