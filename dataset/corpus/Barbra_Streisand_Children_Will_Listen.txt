How do you say to your child in the night  
Nothing is all black but then nothing is all white?  
How do you say it will all be alright  
When you know that it mightn't be true?  
What do you do?  
  
Careful the things you say,  
Children will listen.  
Careful the things you do,  
Children will see.  
And learn.  
Children may not obey,  
But children will listen.  
Children will look to you  
For which way to turn,  
To learn what to be.  
Careful before you say,  
"listen to me."  
Children will listen.  
  
Careful the wish you make,  
Wishes are children.  
Careful the path they take,  
Wishes come true,  
Not free.  
Careful the spell you cast,  
Not just on children.  
Sometimes the spell may last  
Past what you can see  
And turn against you...  
  
Careful the tale you tell.  
That is the spell.  
Children will listen...  
  
How can you say to a child who's in flight,  
Don't slip away and i won't hold so tight?  
What can you say that no matter how slight won't be misunderstood?  
What do you leave to your child when you're dead  
Only what ever you put in its head  
Things that your mother and father had said  
Which were left to them too.  
Careful what you say, children will listen  
Careful you do it too, children will see and learn.  
Oh!  
  
Guide them but step away,  
Children will glisten.  
Temper with what is true  
And children will turn,  
If just to be free.  
Careful before you say,  
"listen to me."  
Children will listen...  
Children will listen!  
Children, children will listen
