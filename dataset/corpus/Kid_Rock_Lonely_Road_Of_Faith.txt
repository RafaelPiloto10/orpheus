Up and down that lonely road of faith  
I have been there  
Unprepared for the storms and the tides that rise  
I've realized one thing, how much I love you  
And it hurts to see, see you cryin'  
I believe we can make it through the winds of change  
  
God is great indeed  
If you believe, in the everlife  
Yeah we gotta  
Make some sense of the piece that's not defined  
And if you just hold on, I won't let ya fall  
We can make it through the storms and the winds of change  
  
Though I walk through the valley of darkness  
I am not afraid  
'Cause I know I'm not alone  
  
And if the wind blows east, would you follow me  
And if the wind blows north, would ya stay your course  
And if the wind blows west, would ya second guess  
And if it blows to the south, would you count me out  
And if the sun don't shine, would you still be mine  
And if the sky turns grey, would you walk away  
Would you say I do, if I say I'll be  
And walk this road through life with me  
You know I love youuuuuu  
  
On this lonely road of faith  
On this lonely road of faith
