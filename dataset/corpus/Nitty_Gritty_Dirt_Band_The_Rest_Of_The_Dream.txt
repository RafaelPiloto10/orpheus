of you but I never realized that baby  
Ream was true until you opened my eyes and I will come through give my very
best for you and your loving arms will keep me warm cause no other arms will

in your loving eyes as We make love in the dark and dream of the big surprise
and the old man will come through son  
Ughter just for you and your mama's arms will keep you warm like no other arms

The light of the day is as be
