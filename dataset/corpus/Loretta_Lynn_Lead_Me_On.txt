Once I made a promise that I'd never lead you on  
But I feel the yearn to love you even though I know it's wrong  
You'll have to take my hand and lead me slowly through the door  
I'll be wrong in what I'm doin' I can't refuse you anymore  
Lead me on and take control of how I feel  
I can't do this on my own cause it's against my will  
I need love warm and tender in a way I've never known  
If you want me I'll go with you but you'll have to lead me on  
[ steel ]  
Lead me on and take control...
