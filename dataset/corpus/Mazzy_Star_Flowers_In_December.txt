Before I let you down again  
I just want to see you in your eyes  
I wouldn't have taken everything out on you  
I only thought you could understand  
  
They say everyman goes blind in his heart  
And they say everybody steals somebody's heart away  
And I got nothing more to say about it  
Nothing more than you would me  
  
Send me your flowers, of your december  
Send me your dreams, of your candy wine  
I got just one thing I can't give you  
Just one more thing of mine  
  
They say everyman goes blind in his heart  
They say everybody steals somebody's heart away  
And I've been wondering why you let me down  
And I been taking it all for granted
