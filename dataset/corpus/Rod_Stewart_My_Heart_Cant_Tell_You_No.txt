I don't want you  
To come round here no more  
I beg you for mercy  
You don't know how strong  
My weakness is  
Or how much it hurts me  
Cause when you said it's over with him  
I want to believe it's true  
So I let you in knowing tomorrow  
I'm gonna wake up missing you  
Wake up missing you  
  
When the one you love's  
In love with someone else  
Don't you know it's torture  
I mean it's a living hell  
No matter how I try to convince myself  
This time I won't lose control  
One look in your blue eyes  
And suddenly my heart can't tell you no  
  
I don't want you  
To call me up no more  
Saying you need me  
You're crazy if you think  
Just half your love  
Could ever please me  
Still I want to hold you, touch you  
When you look at me that way  
There's only one solution I know  
You gotta stay away from me  
Stay away from me  
  
When the one you love's  
In love with someone else  
Don't you know it's torture  
I mean it's a living hell  
No matter how I try to convince myself  
This time I won't lose control  
One look in your sad eyes  
And suddenly my heart can't tell you no  
My Heart can't tell you no  
  
I don't want you  
To come round here no more  
I beg you for mercy  
You don't know how strong  
My weakness is  
Or how much it hurts me  
Cause when you say its over with him  
I want to believe it's true  
So I let you in knowing tomorrow  
I'm gonna wake up missing you  
Wake up missing you  
  
When the one you love's  
In love with someone else  
Don't you know it's torture  
I mean it's a living hell, a living hell  
When the one you love's  
In love with someone else  
Don't you know it's torture  
I mean it's a living hell, a living hell
