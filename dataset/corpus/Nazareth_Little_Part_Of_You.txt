I don't want to take you prisoner  
Or do it against your will  
I wouldn't ever take you over  
Only want a little part of you  
Only want a little part of you  
  
I would never leave you stranded  
Alone on some point of view  
Couldn't ever hold you under  
Only want a little part of you  
Only want a little part of you  
  
I know that the world  
All it's diamonds and it's pearls  
Could never buy you  
Could never even try to  
  
Wouldn't ever bring you sadness  
Leave you standing in the rain  
Never thought you would be easy  
Only want a little part of you  
Only want a little part of you  
  
I know that the world  
All it's diamonds and it's pearls  
Could never buy you  
Could never even try to
