You've got the best of both worlds  
You're the kind of girl who can take down a man,  
And lift him back up again  
You are strong but you're needy,  
Humble but you're greedy  
Based on your body language  
And Shoddy cursive I've been reading  
Your style is quite selective,  
Though your mind is rather reckless  
Well I guess it just suggests  
That this is just what happiness is  
  
[Chorus]  
And what a beautiful mess this is  
It's like picking up trash in dresses  
  
Well it kind of hurts when the kind of words you write  
Kind of turn themselves into knives  
And don't mind my nerve you could call it fiction  
But I like being submerged in your contradictions dear  
Cause here we are, here we are  
  
Although you are biased I love your advice  
Your comebacks they're quick  
And probably have to do with your insecurities  
There's no shame in being crazy,  
Depending on how you take these  
Words I'm paraphrasing this relationship we're staging  
  
[Chorus]  
And what a beautiful mess this is  
It's like picking up trash in dresses  
  
Well it kind of hurts when the kind of words you say  
Kind of turn themselves into blades  
Kind and courteous is the life I've heard  
But it's nice to say that we played in the dirt  
Cause here, here we are, Here we are  
  
[X7]  
(Here we are)  
  
We're still here  
  
[Chorus]  
And what a beautiful mess this is  
It's like taking a guess when the only answer is yes  
  
And through timeless words and priceless pictures  
We'll fly like birds, not of this earth  
And tides they turn and hearts disfigure  
But that's no concern when we're wounded together  
And we've torn our dresses and stained our shirts  
But it's nice today, oh the wait was so worth it
