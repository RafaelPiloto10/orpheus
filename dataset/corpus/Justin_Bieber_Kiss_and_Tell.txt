No, noo,  
  
Now I can see it girl,  
You ain't gotta say nothing  
Your lips are callin me,  
Like they wanna do something,  
  
I feel the chemistry,  
Yeah we got it made,  
A little kiss is a definite possibility,  
Seen you a couple times,  
Had a couple conversations,  
Since you've been on my mind,  
Had a couple observations,  
  
If you a fly chick,  
You could be my chick,  
Play by the rules and  
You could get what I get,  
  
Just keep it quiet,  
Keep it on the hush  
(Yeah, yeah)  
And what we do keep it just between us,  
(Yeah, yeah)  
  
I don't want to see a tweet about jb,  
Cause the only people that should know,  
Is you and me so,  
  
Baby, I know that you're cool  
With rockin with me,  
But I can't have you tellin everybody  
You got me all twisted with your lips  
Like this,  
  
So tell me, tell me,  
Are you gonna kiss, kiss and tell,  
Tell me are you gonna kiss, kiss and tell  
Tell me are you gonna kiss me  
Then tell everybody,  
That you got me twisted  
With your lips girl,  
Are you gonna kiss and tell,  
  
It's confidential,  
No one has to do with it,  
Just you and me girl,  
Tellin' will ruin it,  
  
Don't need that tmz,  
All in our privacy,  
Use em' lips for kissin girl,  
If you wanna ride with me,  
  
And if you wanna tell somebody,  
Then we can call the whole thing off,  
No Problem  
  
You can go your way,  
And I'll go mine,  
But I'd rather spend a little time with you,  
Yeah,  
  
Just keep it quiet,  
(Yeah, yeah)  
Keep it on the hush,  
And what we do,  
Keep it just between us,
