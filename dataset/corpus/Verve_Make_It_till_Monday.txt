Hey my friend are we gonna make it till Monday?  
Another Friday night waiting for a revelation  
I can see a million faces in the condensation  
  
Hey my friend are we gonna make it till Monday?  
Hey my friend you better leave now  
I'm gonna go my own way  
You said I suffer from inner frustration  
  
In a moment you changed  
Now things weren't the same  
You were talking at me not with me  
And your tongue was burning up in flames  
Are you coming back?  
Are you coming back?  
When Monday comes you'll be alone  
With the whole world staring at you  
Better leave now
