Moon river  
Wider than a mile  
I'll be crossing you in style  
Someday  
  
Oh, dream maker  
You heartbreaker  
Wherever you're going  
I'm going your way  
  
Two drifters  
Off to see the world  
I'm not so sure the world  
Deserves us  
  
We're after  
The same rainbow's end  
How come it's just around the bend ?  
It's always just around the bend ?
