Platinum and felt acrylics  
Skim the paper for the critics  
Baby's printing Elvis lyrics  
On the copper bar  
  
Late, Motel lounge is singin'  
Spotlight on the band that's swingin'  
Chateau Marmont memories fading  
Hope is very far  
  
Elvis where are you when I need you most?  
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost  
Pick me up and make a toast  
Champagne in the air  
  
Tipping back, his head relaxing  
Thank you very much and I'm laughing  
All my chantilly lace catchin'  
Baby, on the chandelier  
  
Sweeping scents and blue hydrangia  
Summer hail and summer stranger  
Baby, he's in constant danger  
Help is very far  
  
You look like a Florida Native  
Are you? I said, at the rate of  
Slow molasses from the State of  
Vermont with the Southern drawl  
  
Elvis where are you when I need you most?  
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost  
Pick me up and make a toast  
Champagne in the air  
  
Tipping back, his head relaxing  
Thank you very much and I'm laughing  
All my chantilly lace is catchin'  
On the chandelier  
  
He said he come to welcome warn me  
Gesture diamond to adorn me  
Come to be and see the one and only  
For my final year  
Well thank you  
  
Elvis where are you when I need you most  
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost  
Pick me up and make a toast  
Champagne in the air  
  
Tipping back, his head relaxing  
Thank you very much an' I'm laughing  
All my chantilly lace is catchin'  
On that chandelier  
  
It's catchin' on that chandelier [x2]  
  
Where are you when I need you most?
