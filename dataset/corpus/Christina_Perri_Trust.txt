Like the winds, blowing  
Changes, fast and growing  
I knew better then  
I knew better then  
  
Words that hurt the ones you lovin'  
Hatred for who you're becomin'  
I knew better then yes  
I knew better then  
  
To trust myself  
To trust someone else  
To trust the lies that slip from my mouth  
Trust the heart I'm so quick to sell  
  
Yes I knew better then  
I knew better then  
To trust love again  
  
Memories who won't stop stinging  
Promises I could't believe in  
I knew better then  
I knew better then  
  
To trust myself  
To trust someone else  
To trust the doubt in the back of my mind  
Trust the trail of pain left behind  
Yes, I knew better then  
I knew better then to trust love again  
  
And I'm so quick to lose  
What was never mine to keep  
And I cannot stand (oh) what's broken under me  
I don't know how to forgive  
Myself for everything that I missed  
Learn trust  
  
Like the winds, blowing  
Changes, fast and growing  
I knew better then  
I knew better then
