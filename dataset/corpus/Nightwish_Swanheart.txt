All those beautiful people  
I want to have them all  
All those porcelain models  
If only I could make them fall  
  
Be my heart a well of love  
Flowing free so far above  
  
A wintry eve  
Once upon a tale  
An Ugly Duckling  
Lost in a verse  
Of a sparrows carol  
Dreaming the stars  
  
Be my heart a well of love  
Flowing free so far above  
  
In my world  
Love is for poets  
Never the famous balcony scene  
Just a dying faith  
On the heaven's gate  
  
Crystal pond awaits the lorn  
Tonight another morn for the lonely one is born
