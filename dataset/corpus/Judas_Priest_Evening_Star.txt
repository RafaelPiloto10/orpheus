I traveled to a distant shore  
I felt I had to go  
An inner voice had called me there  
But why I did not know  
I saw the evening star rise up  
Shining out to sea  
And now I understand at last what it means  
What it all means  
  
Evening star I can see the light  
Evening star guiding me so bright  
  
I used to tempt fate  
I couldn't see straight  
I faltered through my younger days  
Never knowing where I was going  
Then something helped me penetrate the haze  
  
Evening star I can see the light  
Evening star guiding me so bright  
  
Now I am stronger  
The haze no longer  
Ruins my future destiny  
Such inspirations and new sensations  
Pull up these string ties chasing me  
  
Evening star I can see the light  
Evening star guiding me so bright  
  
I'm home once more, much better for  
The things that I have found  
Much wiser now, so simple how  
Each time I turn around  
I see the evening star rise up  
Shining out on me  
And now I understand at last what it means  
What it all means  
  
Evening star I can see the light  
Evening star guiding me so bright
