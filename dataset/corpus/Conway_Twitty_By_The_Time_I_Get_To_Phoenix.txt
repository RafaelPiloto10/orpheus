By the time I get to Phoenix she'll be risin'.  
She'll find the note I left hangin' on her door.  
She'll laugh when she reads the part that says I'm leavin',  
'Cause I've left that girl so many time before.  
  
By the time I make Albuquerque she'll be workin'.  
She'll prob'ly stop at lunch and give me a call.  
But she'll just hear that phone keep on ringin',  
Off the wall, that's all.  
  
By the time I make Oklahoma she'll be sleepin',  
She'll turn softly and call my name out low.  
And she'll cry just to think I'd really leave her,  
'Tho' time and time I've tried to tell her so.  
She just didn't know I would really go...
