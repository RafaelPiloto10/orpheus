I had eyes but I could not see, I hurt everybody who believed in me  
I had it all but I lost the key, oh  
I saw the world through fogged-up glasses, like some Lothario making passes  
I showed the world just what an ass is, oh  
  
I was over the edge, I was always out of my head  
Trouble in paradise, treadin' on the thinnest ice  
Oh-oh, over the edge, I wouldn't listen to what anybody said  
Cuttin' with a razor blade, spendin' every cent I made  
Over the edge  
  
I dreamed of standin' on my own two feet  
My fists held high and I clenched my teeth  
But I'd wake up to the same old me, oh  
I was living a lie, but you brought me truth  
Afraid to cry, but you taught me to  
You stood beside me, now I'll stand by you, oh  
  
I was over the edge, I was always out of my head  
I wasn't foolin' anyone, playin' with a loaded gun  
Oh-oh, over the edge, I wouldn't listen to what anybody said  
I was numbing all the pain, you taught me how to feel again  
  
If I had died, it would have been a shame  
They'd have said "he only had himself to blame"  
You saved my life when you called my name, oh  
  
I was over the edge, I was always out of my head  
I was numbing all the pain, you showed me how to feel again  
Oh-oh, over the edge, I wouldn't listen to what anybody said  
When you looked me in the eyes, you finally made me recognize  
  
Oh-oh, over the edge  
Oh-oh, over the edge  
Oh-oh, over the edge  
Oh-oh, over the edge
