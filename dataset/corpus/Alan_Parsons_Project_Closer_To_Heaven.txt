Rising and falling lighter than air  
Silently calling no one is there  
Oh, bird that is flying so high and so free  
Closer to heaven than you and me  
  
Voices of strangers keep me from sleep  
Guardian angels watch over the deep  
A ship that is sailing way out to the sea  
Closer to heaven than you and me  
  
Visions of rain fall out of blue skies  
Rivers of tears fall out of dry eyes  
Answer my question tell me no lies  
Is this the real world or a fool's paradise?  
  
Wind that is blowing so wild and so free  
Closer to heaven than you and me  
  
Closer to heaven longing to be  
Closer to heaven than you and me  
  
Visions of rain fall out of blue skies  
Rivers of tears fall out of dry eyes  
Answer my question tell me no lies  
Is this the real world or a fool's paradise?  
  
Love that lies sleeping wakes in the night  
Secrets for keeping that won't see the light  
I look to the future and I hope it will be  
Closer to heaven than you and me  
  
Closer to heaven longing to be  
Closer to heaven than you and me
