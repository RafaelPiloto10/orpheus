Goin' to a party,  
Meet me out after school.  
Well we go to a place  
Where the jive is really cool.  
And if the band stops a playin'  
There's a jukebox in the hall.  
  
Well put your blue dress on,  
And your folks all gone.  
You'll sure give the guys a ball.  
  
[Chorus]  
Get that real guitar boy shakin',  
I'm a California man,  
Dance right on till the floors are breakin'  
I'm a California man.  
  
Well I cross my mamma so bad  
And this a woman's just a making me mad.  
So I don't care if your legs start aching,  
I'm a California man.  
Oh my, I'm a California man.  
  
Oh my legs start to shiver  
When I hear you call my name.  
Well, my knees keep a knocking,  
And my bow tie's bustin' out  
  
An' when we take off fine,  
An' my jeans are way down low.  
When I waggle my hips  
It's making me feel like a king of rock n' roll  
  
[Chorus]
