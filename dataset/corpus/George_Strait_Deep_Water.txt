I'm drifting into deep water  
I'm startin' to care for you  
You're gettin' me into deep water  
Be careful what you do  
  
You want a romance  
But I'm seekin' love  
I know I'll regret it when it ends  
I'm winding up in deep water  
Why can't we just be friends  
  
It's restless in this deep water  
I'm lost between right and wrong  
My love is true as deep water  
You're love won't last as long  
  
Where will it lead me  
And where will it end  
I can't help but wish I only knew  
I'm winding up in deep water  
So deep in love with you
