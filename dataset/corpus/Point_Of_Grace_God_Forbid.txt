The more I know your power, lord  
The more I'm mindful  
How casually we speak and sing your name  
How often we have come to you  
With no fear or wonder  
And called upon you only for what we stand to gain  
  
(chorus)  
God forbid, that I find you so familiar  
That I think of you as less than who you are  
God forbid, that I should speak of you at all  
Without a humble reverence in my heart  
God forbid  
  
Lord, I often talk about your love and mercy  
How it seems to me your goodness has no end  
It frightens me to think that I could take you for granted  
Though you're closer than a brother  
You're more than just a friend  
  
(repeat chorus)  
  
You are father, God almighty  
Lord of lords, your king of kings  
Beyond my understanding  
No less than everything  
  
(repeat chorus)  
  
God forbid  
God forbid
