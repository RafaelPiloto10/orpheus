When we walk  
Down the street  
We don't care  
Who we see  
Or who we meet  
  
Don't have to run  
Don't have to hide  
'Cause we got something burning inside  
  
We got love power  
It's the greatest power of them all  
We got love power  
And together we can't fall  
  
Sometimes we're up  
Sometimes we're down  
But our feet are always on the ground  
We always laugh  
Don't have to cry  
And this is the reason why  
  
We got love power  
It's the greatest power of them all, hey, hey, hey  
We got love power  
And together we can't fall, hey  
  
Sometimes we're up  
Sometimes we're down  
But our feet are always on the ground  
We always laugh  
Don't have to cry  
And this is the reason why  
  
We got love power  
It's the greatest power in the world  
We got love power  
And together we can't fall  
  
We got love, hey, love power  
It's the greatest feeling of them all, hey, hey, hey  
We got love, oh, power  
And together
