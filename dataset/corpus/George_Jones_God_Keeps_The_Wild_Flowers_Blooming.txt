I been working all day long on some old forgotten place  
A place where mom and papa rest beneath the cold cold clay  
Though the tears may fill my eyes there's a smile upon my face  
I see God remembered mom and daddy put flowers on their grave  
  
And there's wild flowers blooming on mom and papa's graves  
There's no tame ones ever brought here anymore  
For the family they've all gone I've been in prison much too long  
But God keeps the wild flowers blooming on mom and papa's grave  
  
You know I still remember just as though it was only yesterday  
All the hell that my mom and dad went through to live on from day to day  
But the love they both gave us oh it was surely heaven sent  
And all the heartaches that I know I've caused 'em God knows I'll always
regret  
  
And there's wild flowers blooming
