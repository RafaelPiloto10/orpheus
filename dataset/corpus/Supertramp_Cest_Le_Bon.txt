I never knew what a man was supposed to be  
I never wanted the responsibility  
I still remember what they tried to make of me  
They used to wonder what they couldn't get through to me,  
  
'Cause all that I had as this music  
A-coming to me  
And all that I had was this rhythm  
A-running through me.  
  
I took a tip from the man in the ministry  
He said, "My son, better work in the factory"  
Well there were days I can tell you quite honestly  
I saw myself winding up in the military  
  
So lucky to have all this music  
A-coming to me  
I'm lucky to have all this rhythm  
A-running through me  
  
I'm watching the movie go down  
Around, about me  
I'm watching the merry-go-round  
Go down about me.  
  
I said, "Lovers, you're needed in the garden  
'Cause there's a lot of crazy people  
Who've forgotten where their heart is  
And they don't give a damn  
About hurting those flowers and those trees."  
C'est bon, sailing on and on...  
  
Sometimes I wonder where my life is taking me  
Sometimes I wonder what they all expect of me  
Well there were days I can tell you quite honestly  
I saw myself winding up in the monastery  
  
'Cause all that I have is this music  
A-coming to me  
And all that I have is this rhythm  
A-running through me  
  
I'm watching the movie go down  
Around, about me  
I'm watching the merry-go-round  
Go down about me.  
  
I said, "Lovers, you're needed in the garden  
'Cause there's a lot of crazy people  
Who've forgotten where their heart is  
And they don't give a damn  
About hurting that small child in me."  
C'est le bon, sailing on and on
