Nickels and dimes  
Memories and wines  
She's on his mind once again  
The same old fool  
The same old stool  
Played by the rules but didn't win  
There's an old love in his heart that he can't lose  
He tried forgetting but he knows that it's no use  
  
[Chorus]  
He's got a fool hearted memory  
That won't let him see  
That she walked out the door  
He's got a fool hearted memory  
He sits patiently  
Here every night so it can fool him more  
  
She was his girl  
His only whirl  
That string of pearls that slipped away  
A thousand dimes  
A thousand times  
He doesn't mind what they say  
He fills the jukebox  
And plays the same old song  
He fills his glass  
And then he turns her memory on  
  
[Chorus: x2]
