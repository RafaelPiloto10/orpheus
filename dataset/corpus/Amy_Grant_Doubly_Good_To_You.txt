If you see the moon  
Rising gently on your fields  
If the wind blows softly on your face  
If the sunset lingers  
While cathedral bells peal  
And the moon has risen to her place  
You can thank the father  
For the things that he has done  
And thank him for the things he's yet to do  
And if you find a love that's tender  
If you find someone who's true  
Then thank the Lord  
He's been doubly good to you  
And if you look in the mirror  
At the end of a hard day  
And you know in your heart you have not lied  
And if you gave love freely  
If you earned an honest wage  
And if you've got Jesus by your side  
You can thank the father  
For the things that he has done  
And thank him for the things he's yet to do  
And if you find a love that's tender  
If you find someone who's true  
Thank the Lord  
He's been doubly good to you  
You can thank the father  
For the things that he has done  
And thank him for the things he's yet to do  
If you find a love that's tender  
If you find someone who's true  
Thank the Lord  
He's been doubly good to you  
Thank the Lord  
He's been doubly good to you
