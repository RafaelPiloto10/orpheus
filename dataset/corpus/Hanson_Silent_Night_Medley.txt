O holy night the stars are brightly shining  
This is the night of our dear savior's birth  
Long lay the world in sin and error pining  
Till he appeared and his soul felt it's worth  
  
At thrill of hope, the weary soul rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn  
Fall on your knees  
O hear the angels' voices  
O night divine  
O night when christ was born  
  
Silent night, holy night  
All is calm, all is bright  
Round yon virgin mother and child  
Holy infant so tender and mild  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
  
Fall on your knees  
O hear the angels' voices  
O night divine  
O night when christ was born  
  
O come o ye faithful  
Joyful and triumphant  
O come ye o come ye to bethlehem  
Come and behold him, born the king of angels  
O come let us adore him  
O come let us adore him  
O come let us adore him christ the lord.  
  
Fall on your knees  
O hear the angels' voices  
O night divine  
O night when christ was born  
Oh night divine o night o holy  
Oh holy night  
Oh holy night  
Woah  
Oh holy night  
When jesus was born  
Oh holy night  
Oh holy night  
Oh holy night  
Oh holy night  
Look at those stars in the sky  
Oh holy night  
Oh holy night  
Oh holy night  
Jesus was born tonight  
Oh holy night  
Oh holy night  
Oh holy night
