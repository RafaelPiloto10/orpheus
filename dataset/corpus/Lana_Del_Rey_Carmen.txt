Darling, darling, doesn't have a problem  
Lying to herself 'cause her liquor's top shelf  
It's alarming honestly how charming she can be  
Fooling everyone, telling them she's having fun  
  
She says you don't want to be like me  
Don't wanna see all the things I've seen  
I'm dying, I'm dying  
She says you don't want to get this way  
Famous and dumb at an early age  
Lying, I'm lying  
  
The boys, the girls, they all like Carmen  
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes  
She laughs like God, her mind's like a diamond  
Audio tune lies, she's still shining  
Like lightning, light, like lightning  
  
Carmen, Carmen, staying up 'til morning  
Only seventeen, but she walks the streets so mean  
It's alarming truly how disarming you can be  
Eating soft ice cream, Coney Island queen  
  
She says you don't want to be like me  
Looking for fun, getting high for free  
I'm dying, I'm dying  
  
She says you don't want to get this way  
Street walk at night and a star by day  
  
It's tiring, tiring  
  
The boys, the girls, they all like Carmen  
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes  
She laughs like God, her mind's like a diamond  
Audio tune lies, she's still shining  
Like lightning, light, like lightning  
  
Baby's all dressed up with nowhere to go  
That's the little story of the girl you know  
Relying on the kindness of strangers  
Tying cherry knots, smiling, doing party favors  
Put your red dress on, put your lipstick on  
Sing your song, song, now, the camera's on  
And you're alive again  
  
Mon amour, je sais que tu m'aimes aussi  
Tu as besoin de moi  
Tu as besoin de moi dans ta vie  
Tu ne peux vivre sans moi  
Et je mourrais sans toi  
Je tuerais pour toi  
  
The boys, the girls, they all like Carmen  
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes  
She laughs like god, her mind's like a diamond  
Audio tune lies, she's still shining  
Like lightning, light, like lightning  
  
Like lightning, light, like lightning  
  
Darling, darling, doesn't have a problem  
Lying to herself 'cause her liquor's top shelf
