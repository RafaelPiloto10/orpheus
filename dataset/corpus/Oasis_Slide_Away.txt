Slide away and give it all you've got  
  
My today fell in from the top  
  
I dream of you and all the things you say  
  
I wonder where you are now?  
Hold me down all the world's asleep  
Need you now you've knocked me off my feet  
I dream of you and we talk of growing old  
  
But you said please don't!  
Slide in baby together we'll fly  
I've tried praying but I don't know just what you're saying to me  
  
Now that you're mine  
We'll find a way  
Of chasing the sun  
Let me be the one that shines with you  
In the morning we don't know what to do  
  
Two of a kind  
We'll find a way  
To do what we've done  
Let me be the one who shines with you  
And we can slide away  
Slide away  
Slide away  
Away  
  
Slide away, and give it all you've got  
My today, fell in from the top  
I dream of you and all the things you say  
I wonder where you are now?  
  
Slide in baby together we'll fly  
I've tried praying and I know just what you're saying to me  
Now that you're mine  
We'll find a way  
Of chasing the sun  
Let me be the one that shines with you  
In the morning we don't know what to do  
  
We are two of a kind  
We'll find a way  
To do what we've done  
Oh, let me be the one that shines with you  
And we can slide away  
Slide away  
Slide away  
  
Slide away  
Slide away  
Slide away  
Slide away  
Slide away  
Slide away  
Slide away  
  
Slide away  
Slide away  
Slide away  
Slide away  
Slide away  
Slide away  
Slide away  
  
Slide away
