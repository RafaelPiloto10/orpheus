In an Appalachian, Greyhound station  
She sits there waiting, in a family way  
"Goodbye brother, Tell Mom I love her  
Tell all the others, I'll write someday"  
[Chorus:]  
From an teenage lover, to an unwed mother  
Kept undercover, like some bad dream  
While unwed fathers, they can't be bothered  
They run like water, through a mountain stream  
In a cold and gray town, a nurse say's "Lay down"  
'This ain't no playground, and this ain't home'  
Someone's children, out having children  
In a gray stone building, all alone  
On somewhere else bound, Smokey Mountain Greyhound  
She bows her head down, hummin' lullabies  
'Your daddy never, meant to hurt you ever'  
'He just don't live here, but you've got his eyes'  
[Chorus]  
Well, they run like water,  
Through a mountain stream
