Don't want to wait til tomorrow  
Why put it off another day  
One more walk through problems  
Built up, and stand in our way ,ah  
One step ahead, one step behind me  
Now you gotta run to get even  
Make future plans, don't dream about yesterday, hey  
C'mon turn, turn this thing around  
Right now, hey  
It's your tomorrow  
Right now,  
C'mon,it's everything  
Right now,  
Catch a magic moment, do it  
Right here and now  
It means everything  
Miss the beat, you lose the rhythm  
And nothing falls into place, no  
Only missed by a fraction  
Slipped a little off your pace, oh  
The more things you get, the more you want  
Just trade in one for the other  
Workin so hard, to make it easier, whoa  
Got to turn, c'mon turn this thing around  
Right now, hey  
It's your tomorrow  
Right now  
C'mon, it's everything  
Right now  
Catch that magic moment, do it  
Right here and now  
It means everything  
It's enlightened me, right now  
What are you waitin for  
Oh, yeah, right now  
  
Right now, hey  
It's your tomorrow  
Right now  
C'mon, it's everything  
Right now  
Catch that magic moment, and do it right  
Right now  
Right now, oh, Right now  
It's what's happening?  
Right here and now  
Right now
