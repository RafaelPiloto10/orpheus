I cannot follow you, my love,  
You cannot follow me.  
I am the distance you put between  
All of the moments that we will be.  
  
You know who I am,  
You've stared at the sun,  
Well I am the one who loves  
Changing from nothing to one.  
  
Sometimes I need you naked,  
Sometimes I need you wild,  
I need you to carry my children in  
And I need you to kill a child.  
You know who I am  
  
If you should ever track me down  
I will surrender there  
And I will leave with you one broken man  
Whom I will teach you to repair.  
You know who I am  
  
I cannot follow you, my love,  
You cannot follow me.  
I am the distance you put between  
All of the moments that we will be.  
You know who I am
