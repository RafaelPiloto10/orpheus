Amarillo by mornin'  
Up from San Antone  
Everything that I got  
Is just what I've got on  
  
When that sun is high in that Texas sky  
I'll be buckin' at the county fair  
Amarillo by mornin'  
Amarillo, I'll be there  
  
They took my saddle in Houston  
Broke my leg in Santa Fe  
I lost my wife and a girlfriend  
Somewhere along the way  
  
But I'll be lookin' for 8 when they pull that gate  
And I hope that judge ain't blind  
Amarillo by mornin'  
Amarillo's on my mind  
  
Amarillo by mornin'  
Up from San Antone  
Everything that I got  
Is just what I've got on  
  
I ain't got a dime but what I got is mine  
I ain't rich but Lord I'm free  
Amarillo by mornin'  
Amarillo's where I'll be  
  
Amarillo by mornin'  
Amarillo's where I'll be
