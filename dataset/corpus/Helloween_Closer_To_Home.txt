Everybody listen to me  
And return me  
My Ship  
I'm your captain  
I'm your captain  
No I'm feeling mighty sick  
  
I've been lost now  
Days uncounted  
And it's months since  
I've seen home  
Can you hear me  
Can you hear me  
Oh am I all alone  
  
If you return me  
To my home port  
I will kiss you  
Mother Earth  
Take me back now  
Take me back now  
To the port  
Of my birth  
To the port  
Of my birth  
  
Am I in my cabin dreaming  
Or are you really scheming  
To take my ship away from me?  
You better think about it  
I just can't live without it  
So please don't take my ship from me  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
I can feel the hand  
Of the stranger  
As it's tightening  
Around my throat  
Heaven help me  
Heaven help me  
Take this stranger  
From my boat  
I'm your captain  
I'm your captain  
Though I'm feeling mighty sick  
Everybody listen to me  
And return me my ship  
I'm your captain  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
I'm getting closer to my home
