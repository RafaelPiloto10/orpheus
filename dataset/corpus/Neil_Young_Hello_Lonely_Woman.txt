Well, hello lonely woman  
Won't you take a walk with me.  
I know a place where we can go  
Grab a bite to eat.  
Hello lonely woman.  
Are you feelin' all right?  
Well, you look just like heaven  
On a clear clear night.  
Well, I know you're a lonely woman  
And I know what's on your mind  
I won't ask you any favors  
I'm familiar with your kind.  
I know you need me  
Like a river needs rain  
I won't ask you any favors  
Until I pass this way again.
