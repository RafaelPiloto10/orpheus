I was born in a beauty salon  
My father was a dresser of hair  
My mother was a girl you could call on  
When you called she was always there [Repeat: x5]  
  
Ah but don't go home with your hard-on  
It will only drive you insane  
You can't shake it (or break it) with your Motown  
You can't melt it down in the rain  
  
You can't melt it down in the rain  
You can't melt it down in the rain  
You can't melt it down in the rain  
  
I've looked behind all of the faces  
That smile you down to you knees  
And the lips that say, Come on, taste us  
And when you try to they make you say Please  
  
When you try to they make you say Please  
When you try to they make you say Please  
When you try to they make you say Please  
When you try to they make you say Please  
  
Ah but don't go home with your hard-on  
  
Here come's your bride with her veil on  
Approach her, you wretch, if you dare  
Approach her, you ape with your tail on  
Once you have her she'll always be there  
  
Once you have her she'll always be there [Repeat: x4]  
  
Ah but don't go home with your hard-on  
  
So I work in that same beauty salon  
I'm chained to the old masquerade  
The lipstick, the shadow, the silicone  
I follow my father's trade  
  
I follow my father's trade  
Yes I follow my father's trade  
Yes I follow my father's trade  
Yes I follow my father's trade  
  
Ah but don't go home with your hard-on  
It will only drive you insane  
You can't shake it (or break it) with your Motown  
You can't melt it down in the rain [Repeats]
