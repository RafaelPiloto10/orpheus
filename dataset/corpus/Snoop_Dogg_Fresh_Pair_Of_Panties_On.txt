It's time to slow it down, steadily grinding  
And this is, the big Doggy Dogg  
  
And I ain't talking about no Air Force Ones  
I just gotta know, before you let me get some  
  
[Chorus]  
Do you have a fresh pair of panties on?  
I got to know, or you could show, me  
Silk cotton see-through lace your sexy thong  
I got to know, or you could show, me  
  
[Snoop Dogg]  
Freak-a-leek, peak peak  
Let a nigga sneak a few, peek-a-boo  
Let's see what we can do  
I'm bout freaking you, and sneaking you  
Into a quiet place  
So I can look at it face to face  
Let me guess, you prefer to wear cotton  
I can tell, cause you like squatting  
Your last dude, he was so rotten  
And now your love is to be gotten  
Yeah baby girl I can read your mind  
But what I'm really trying to do is ready between your pantylines  
I know it seems oh so personal  
But I'm just trying to make you feel real comfortable  
I know, so, what will it be?  
And the type of underwear you wear I mean it's troubling me  
Can I get a glimpse, one for the pimps?  
I got one question, answer me this then  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Snoop Dogg]  
You came by the chuuch with a whole lot of body  
Got invited to our annual pajama party  
Working that lace, I think it was the French cut  
Yeah bitch, you got a big ol' butt  
Hiding it, should be dividing it  
It's real tight now but I got a way to widen it  
And slide in it, real smooth like  
with a little bit of Miles Davis to get you in the mood like  
zoom boom hit the poom-poom right  
Just to get your groove right  
I can make it happen, but it can't happen if you ain't good at it  
When you goin' let a nigga have a look at it?  
Calling all cars, yeah baby girl you a star  
But it's on you if you want to go real far  
Now let me get a glimpse, one for the pimps  
I, have one question, answer me this  
  
[Chorus]
