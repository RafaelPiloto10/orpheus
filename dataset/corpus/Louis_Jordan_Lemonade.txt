Yes I'm looking for a chick  
That only drinks lemonade  
Yes I'm looking for a chick  
That only drinks lemonade  
I haven't found one yet  
But I been told that a few was made  
  
Now you know the type  
And I know 'em too  
They stand at the bar drinking ten cent brew  
You ask them what they're drinking  
Though you already know  
They'll say whiskey every time to make you spend your dough  
  
That's why I'm looking for a gal  
That only drinks lemonade  
I haven't found one yet  
But I been told that a few was made  
  
I met a gal I thought was so fine  
I begged her to please, please baby be mine  
I took her out one thursday night  
She got two shots of joy juice  
And was ready to fight  
  
That's why I'm looking for a gal  
That only drinks lemonade  
I haven't found one yet  
But I been told that a few was made  
  
Now whiskey's too powerful  
For a woman's frame  
It'll make some of them simple  
And it makes other chicks insane  
It can make a girl, weighing one hundred and four,  
Feel so powerful she could think she could even whip you  
This I know to be a solid fact  
Cause I fell for one  
A little while back  
She was so sweet  
At the start of the night  
But after two drinks  
Was nothing right  
  
That's I'm looking for a chick  
That only drinks lemonade  
I'm tired of being broke  
The day after I get paid
