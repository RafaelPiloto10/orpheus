Chris thompson vocals  
  
Standing around for an hour in the rain  
The porcelin promise is breaking once again  
Fill me with everything I want to hear  
These are the same lines that I heard last year  
And you always seem to talk and walk away  
Saying things will start to happen anyday  
  
And I say when  
So tell me when  
And I say when  
So tell me when  
  
I've heard so much about boats coming in  
Well I've seen no ships so I guess I should swim  
How did I come to get caught in your wake  
The more that I give you the more you still take  
And you always seem to talk and walk away  
Saying things will start to happen any day  
  
And I say when  
So tell me when  
And I say when  
So tell me when  
  
Monday is tuesday then march becomes may  
The days of my life are just ticking away  
  
So I say when  
So tell me when  
I say when  
So tell me when
