The sky collapsed around us, you didn't seem to care  
I hailed you through the raindrops, you weren't even there.  
I juggle with the breakfast, you fret behind the sheets  
I want you to be steadfast, you want to be released.  
Chorus:  
Oh my pretty darling, where did we go astray  
Oh my pretty darling, I thought you'd come to stay.  
We're all dollied up for the circus, oh isn't it grand  
We're laughing, jumping and kissing, we're beating the band.  
I've got no more smiles to win you, no tricks to turn your head  
When love cannot continue, there's not much to be said.  
Chorus  
It's all cut and thrust at the circus, and maybe makes three  
You're twisting my words into serpents, I'm down on my knees.  
Oh my pretty darling, I thought you'd come to stay  
I thought you'd come to stay, I thought you'd come to stay.
