Sonny signed his name up for tomorrow and laughed with all his friends  
At all the little men who borrows tunes they heard just yesterday  
Davey got us down but we got away and drank to all the days  
That we had whiled away just playing Robin Hood a little out of phase  
  
And then the nightmares come and you get blown away  
And up in your room, your walls are cold  
You find your head is holding out for the welcome of a better day  
  
And then the nightmares come and you get blown away  
And up in your room, your walls are getting colder  
Like you're getting on a roller coaster, you can't find the breaks  
  
Stevie burned the sky when he flew away and left us things to say  
When all the world was falling down around our shoulders, cold and gray  
Harry carried on in his usual way and Minnie went inside  
And came out once and we both cried and Minnie blew my head away  
  
When you're giving everything away, everybody lets you pay  
You're saving up for a better day, seeing things in a better way  
When you know you've got to live, there's nothing you won't give  
To hear the phone and not let it ring every Monday morning  
  
Shughie found love and he almost cried, we laughed and wondered why  
We love the sky and found the space and gazed out over Stevie's plane
