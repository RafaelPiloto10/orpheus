It's a cold, old world that we're walking through  
They ought to tell you at the start  
But it's warm as toast walking two by two  
Lay down the burden of your heart  
  
[Chorus]  
Lay down the burden of your heart  
I know you'll never miss it  
Just show me, angel, where it hurts  
And let your mammy kiss it  
  
It's a fine, fine line between love and hate  
It's hard to tell the two apart  
But what strength I have, I offer you  
Lay down the burden of your heart  
  
[Chorus: x2]
