You stop the crowd  
I cried out to break the spell  
You wake and smile  
I just snapped and lost control  
  
Distracted by irrelevance  
The stress and the tension  
The stress and the tension  
I'm in a lull  
  
There's nothing more dull  
Then talking about yourself  
But what I meant to say  
I'm sorry that I lost control  
  
Distracted by irrelevance  
The stress and the tension  
Crawling through the keyhole  
I'm in a lull
