I used to get mad at my school  
The teachers that taught me weren't cool  
Holding me down, and turning me round  
Filling me up with your rules  
  
Got to admit it's getting better  
It's getting better all the time  
Have to admit it's getting better  
It's getting better, since you'll be mine  
  
I used to be angry young man  
Me hiding me head in the sand  
You gave me the word, I finally heard  
I'm doing the best that I can  
  
Got to admit it's getting better  
It's getting better all the time  
Have to admit it's getting better  
It's getting better, since you'll be mine  
Getting so much better all the time  
  
It's getting better all the time, better, better, better  
It's getting better all the time, better, better, better  
  
I used to be cruel to my woman, I beat her  
And kept her apart from the things that she loved  
Man I was mean but I'm changing my scene  
And I'm doing the best that I can  
  
Got to admit it's getting better  
It's getting better all the time  
Have to admit it's getting better  
It's getting better, since you'll be mine  
Getting so much better all the time
