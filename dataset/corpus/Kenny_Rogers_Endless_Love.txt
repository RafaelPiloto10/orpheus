My Love  
There's only you in my life  
The only thing that's right  
My first love  
  
You're every breath that I take  
You're every step I make  
And I  
I want to share  
  
All my love with you  
No one else will do  
And your eyes  
They tell me how mush you care  
  
Oh yes, you will always be  
My endless love  
Two hearts  
Two hearts that beat as one  
  
Our lives have just begun  
Forever  
I'll hold you close in my arms  
I can't resist your charms  
  
Oh, love  
I'll be the fool  
For you I'm sure  
And you know I don't mind  
  
'Cause you  
You mean the world to me  
I know I found in you  
My endless love  
  
And love  
I'll be the fool  
For you I'm sure  
And you know I don't mind  
  
And yes  
You'll be the only one  
'Cause no one can deny  
This love I have inside  
  
And I'll give it all to you  
My love
