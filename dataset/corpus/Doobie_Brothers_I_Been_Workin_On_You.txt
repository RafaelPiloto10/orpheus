Mama been workin', so hard  
Keep on workin' mama but you don't get far  
But baby I know, baby you're blind  
And I'll keep a-risin' mama, just to show you're mine  
And I keep workin' on you  
Well I been watchin' you grow  
And baby you got what it takes to let me know  
Sure as the devil, rise in the blind  
It's gonna be nasty and it's gonna be mine  
I been workin' on you  
Keep on movin' pretty baby, I feel you in my heart  
Gentle on me movin' honey, honey, but you can't be far but you  
Keep on with me, true to form  
I can't ask for more now but your  
Soul star is born
