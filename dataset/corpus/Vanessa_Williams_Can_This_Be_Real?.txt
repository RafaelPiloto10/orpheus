Your face, my door  
Haven't we both been here before  
Sightless no more  
No vision so high  
  
Your touch, my hand  
Suspecting that I understand  
Night stands passin'  
I'm askin', your life  
  
Can this be real ?  
Can this be lovin' feelin'  
Can this be a dream that fades a morning light  
Can this be real ?  
Can this be lovin' feelin'  
Are you what you seem, will you be real tonight  
  
Ouick turn, long stares  
Is that a shadow or are there  
You feel so real  
But is this confusion  
  
Ooh your voice soft and low  
Comes in my ear and breezes that blow  
No choice I knew  
I ask my illusions  
  
Can this be real ?  
Can this be lovin' feelin'  
Can this be a dream that fades a morning light  
Can this be lovin' feelin'  
Are you what you seem, will you be real tonight  
  
Night goes and day's here  
I can still remember the taste of the tear  
I still face a cold stare  
The essence of someone is constantly here  
  
Can this be real ?  
  
I can almost feel your touch  
But you're not there  
  
This - and I need you in the end, yeah, oh  
  
Can this be real ?  
Can this be lovin' feelin'  
Can this be a dream that fades a morning light  
Can this be lovin' feelin'  
Are you what you seem, will you be real tonight  
  
Your face, my door  
Haven't we both been here before
