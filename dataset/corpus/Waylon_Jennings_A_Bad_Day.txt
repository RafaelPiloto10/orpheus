I guess it all started when I woke up  
This morning everything seemed okay  
Till I let my pet snake get loose in the kitchen  
Now I've been in trouble all day.  
  
I got some paint on the wall a pretty orange color  
And a little on the carpet and floor  
I covered it up with mom's coat from the closet  
That she says she can't wear anymore.  
  
I've had a bad, bad day  
Not like I thought it would be  
I've had a bad, bad day  
It seems like everyone's picking on me.  
  
I put some sand in my grandpa's tobacco  
And he frowned at me all day  
Then I hid his pipe 'cause it smells when he smokes it  
He shouldn't smoke anyway.  
  
So between mom's coat and my grandpa's tobacco  
Life can be rough on a kid  
They've almost worn out the seat of my britches  
It don't hurt much now, but it did.  
  
I've had a bad, bad day  
Not like I thought it would be  
I've had a bad, bad day  
It seems like everyone's picking on me.  
  
I've had a bad, bad day  
Not like I thought it would be  
I've had a bad, bad day  
It seems like everyone's picking on me
