Well me an' my buddies we got us some beer  
And a great big bottle of rye  
And boxes of ammo and guns to go with 'em  
And good old Charlie's glass eye  
Well we looked all around so we sees all of nature  
So calm and so serene  
But not for long 'cause we're gonna use guns  
To make furry animals scream  
  
'Cause we're goin' huntin'  
We're gonna kill somethin'  
I don't care what it is  
Maybe a raccoon, maybe a gopher,  
Maybe the neighbour's kids!  
We're goin' huntin'  
We're gonna kill somethin'  
I don't care what it is  
Maybe a raccoon, maybe a gopher,  
Maybe the neighbour's kids!  
  
Well off we go, our guns are loaded  
And so's are we  
We weaves through the bushes and falls on our faces  
And piss on the nice trees  
And then we spot something moving an' a rustle  
We pump it full of lead  
And smile real wide as we hear it scream  
And thud as it falls down dead  
  
'Cause we're goin' huntin'  
We're gonna kill somethin'  
I don't care what it is  
Maybe a raccoon, maybe a gopher,  
Maybe the neighbour's kids!  
We're goin' huntin'  
We're gonna kill somethin'  
I don't care what it is  
Maybe a raccoon, maybe a gopher,  
Maybe the neighbour's kids!  
  
Well off we go to see what we killed  
And watch the damn thing bleed  
The first thing we see is a bright orange cap  
And we shot down Ol' Charlie  
But he don't to mind, he smiled all the time  
He died real happy  
But next time he should tell us  
When he's goin' off to take a pee  
  
'Cause we're goin' huntin'  
We're gonna kill somethin'  
I don't care what it is  
Maybe a raccoon, maybe a gopher,  
Maybe the neighbour's kids!  
We're goin' huntin'  
We're gonna kill somethin'  
I don't care what it is  
Maybe a raccoon, maybe a gopher,  
Maybe the neighbour's kids!  
  
Well the sun goes down and we head back to town  
And we hop in our pickup truck  
Strap Charlie to the hood, start up the engine  
Drive it home with any luck  
Well what do you know, we run into a pole  
But we're all still in one piece  
And we get a free ride back into town  
Courtesy of the police.  
  
'Cause we're goin' huntin'  
We're gonna kill somethin'  
I don't care what it is  
Maybe a raccoon, maybe a gopher,  
Maybe the neighbour's kids!  
We're goin' huntin'  
We're gonna kill somethin'  
I don't care what it is  
Maybe a raccoon, maybe a gopher,  
Maybe the neighbour's kids!
