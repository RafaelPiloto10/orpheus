Here we are, born to be kings  
We're the princes of the universe  
Here we belong, fighting to survive  
In a world with the darkest powers, heh  
And here we are, we're the princes of the universe  
Here we belong, fighting for survival  
We've come to be the rulers of you all  
  
I am immortal, I have inside me blood of kings - yeah - yeah  
I have no rival, no man can be my equal  
Take me to the future of you all  
  
Born to be kings, princes of the universe  
Fighting and free  
Got your world in my hand  
I'm here for your love and I'll make my stand  
We were born to be princes of the universe  
  
No man could understand  
My power is in my own hand  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, people talk about you  
People say you've had your day  
I'm a man that will go far  
Fly the moon and reach for the stars  
With my sword and head held high  
Got to pass the test first time - yeah  
I know that people talk about me - I hear it every day  
But I can prove them wrong 'cos I'm right first time  
Yeah, yeah, alright, let's go, let's go, ha haa  
Yeah, watch this man fly, wooh  
Bring on the girls - c'mon - c'mon - c'mon  
Here we are - here we are  
Born to be kings, we're the princes of the universe  
Here we belong  
Born to be kings, princes of the universe  
Fighting and free, got your world in my hand  
I'm here for your love and I'll make my stand  
We were born to be princes of the universe, of the universe, of the universe  
Of the universe of the universe
