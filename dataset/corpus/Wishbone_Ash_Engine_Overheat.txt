Picked up my baby before the sun set -  
She's always ready to step inside.  
I can't wait, though, to get started,  
And her love is so bona fide.  
I'm in the mood for it, I'm in the mood for it,  
Your love, your love.  
Yeah, my serenity, her intentions -  
And we were rolling on down that road.  
She was tuned to, to perfection -  
I was heading for that overload.  
I'm in the mood for it, I'm in the mood for it,  
Your love, your love.  
It makes my engine overheat,  
Puts me back into the seat,  
It's just the nature, just the nature,  
That makes my engine overheat.  
Twin barrels burning, just like a rocket -  
She took me faster than I've ever been.  
There was nothing I could do, and I didn't ask for something  
Like sitting on a guillotine. you know just what I mean.  
I'm in the mood for it, right in the mood for it,  
Your love, your love, your love, your love.  
It makes my engine overheat -  
Puts me back into the seat,  
It's just the nature, it's just the nature of the beast.  
Just the nature, just the nature,  
Makes my engine overheat.
