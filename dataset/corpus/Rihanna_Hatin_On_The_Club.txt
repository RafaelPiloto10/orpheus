Now this be the last time you did me wrong  
No more laying up in your arms  
No calling, saying you want me back  
I'm packing my bags, what you think about that?  
  
Stayed at home like a good girl do  
But Tonight baby you got me sad and blue  
I just heard about the girl in your car, y'all kissing at the bar  
Got me crying  
  
[Chorus:]  
Ohhh, you got me hatin' on the club  
'Cause you took my love  
Oh you took my love  
Now you got me like whoahhh  
You got me hatin' on the club  
'Cause you took my love  
Why'd you have to take my love  
Whoahh  
  
And you can be mad at me all you want  
I ain't coming in, I'll be waiting out front  
Coming out the door with your girlfriend  
You did me wrong boy tell me where our love went  
  
Stayed at home like a good girl do  
But Tonight baby you got me sad and blue  
I just heard about the girl in your car, y'all kissing at the bar  
Got me crying  
  
[Chorus:]  
Ohhh, you got me hatin' on the club  
'Cause you took my love  
Oh you took my love  
Now you got me like whoahhh  
You got me hatin' on the club  
'Cause you took my love  
Why'd you have to take my love  
Whoahh  
  
Now this is the sound of a broken heart  
There's only one reason why we're apart  
She never woulda made it to your car  
If it wasn't for the club, I'd still have my love  
We would still have us  
I'd still have my love  
We would still have us  
  
But now we're like whoahhhh  
  
Ohhh, you got me hatin' on the club  
'Cause you took my love  
Oh you took my love  
  
But now, now we're like whoahhh  
You got me hatin' on the club  
You took my love  
Oh you took my love
