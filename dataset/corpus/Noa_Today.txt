Here we are again  
After everything has happened  
Only you and me  
And the light is fading fast  
Who would have believed  
When the tiny seed was planted  
This would be the year  
When the rain would come at last  
  
Every passing hour  
Changes us  
But I love you more than any day before today  
Today  
  
Listen to my heart  
As it stutters like the raindrops  
Let me fill my soul  
With the beauty of your eyes  
I may be a fool  
But I always want to hold you  
Tenderly I say  
You give reason to my life  
  
Every passing hour  
Changes us  
But I love you more than any day before today  
Today
