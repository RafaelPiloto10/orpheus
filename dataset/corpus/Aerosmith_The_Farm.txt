(It's not a place you can get to  
By a boat or a train...it's far,  
Far away...Charlie...I have a  
Feeling we're not in Kansas anymore)  
Oaahh!  
There's a cockroach in my coffee  
There's a needle in my arm  
And I feel like New York City  
Get me to the farm  
Get me to the farm  
Get me to the farm  
Get me to the farm  
Somebody get me to the farm  
I got terminal uniqueness  
I'm an egocentric man  
I get caught up in my freakness  
But I ain't no Peter Pan  
Get me to the farm  
Get me to the farm  
Get me to the farm  
Get me to the farm  
Get me...  
Buckle up straightjack  
Insanity is such a drag  
Jellybean Thorazine  
Transcendental jet lag  
Sanity I ain't gonna  
Feeling like a pifiata  
Sucker punch, blow lunch  
Mother load, pigeonhole  
I'm feeling like I'm gonna explode  
Yeah, I wanna shave my head and  
I wanna be a Hare Krishna  
Tattoo a dot right on my head  
Heh, heh  
And the Prozac is my fixer  
I am the living dead  
(Follow the yellow brick road...  
Follow the yellow brick road...)  
Take me to the farm  
Take me to the farm  
Somebody get me to the farm  
Somebody take me to the farm  
Take me to the farm  
Take me to the farm  
Somebody take me to the farm  
Somebody take me to the farm  
Take me to the farm  
Take me to the farm  
Take me to the farm  
Buckle up straightjack  
Insanity is such a drag  
Jellybean Thorazine  
Transcendental jet lag  
Sanity I ain't gonna  
Feeling like a pifiata  
Sucker punch, blow lunch  
Motherload, pigeonhole  
I'm feeling like I'm gonna explode  
Yeah, I wanna shave my head and  
I wanna be a Hare Krishna  
Tattoo a dot right on my head  
Heh, heh  
And the Prozac is my fixer  
I am the living dead  
Take me to the farm  
Take me to the farm  
Somebody get me to the farm  
(Wake up, honey...Then I'm sure to  
Get a brain uh, huh...)
