[Chorus:]  
In my own way I'm a believer  
In my own way right or wrong  
I don't talk too much about it  
It's something I keep working on  
I don't have too much to build on  
My faith has never been that strong  
  
There's a man in that old building  
He's a holy man, they say  
He keeps talking about tomorrow  
While I keep struggling with today  
He preaches hell, fire and brimstone  
And heaven seems so far away  
  
I do believe in a higher power  
One that loves us one and all  
Not someone to solve our problems  
Or to catch me when I fall  
He gave us all a mind to think with  
And to know what's right or wrong  
He is that inner spirit  
That keeps us strong  
  
[Chorus]
