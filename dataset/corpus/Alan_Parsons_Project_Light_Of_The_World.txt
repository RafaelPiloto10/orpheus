I am just a stranger, in a promised land  
I am only learning a game with the rules i don't understand  
Going round in circles, I've been round before  
I can walk no more  
I can walk no more  
I am just a drifter, in an open sea  
But no matter how much i try, the tide will not turn for me  
Going round in circles, till i reach the shore  
I am blown by so many winds  
I can take no more  
I can take no more  
Light of the world, i stand alone  
Cause i could not see the light of the world  
Show me the fire, in a true believer's eye  
I am just a dreamer, when i close my eyes  
I can fly so close to the sun, that i can not see it rise  
Going round in circles, in a silent sky  
I am lost for so many worlds  
I can not say why  
I can not say why  
Light of the world, i stand alone  
Cause i could not see the light of the world  
Show me the fire, in a true believer's eye  
Just a traveler, on an endless flight  
But no matter which way i turn, i journey into the night  
Going round in circles, till the mountains fall  
To believe in so many truths  
Makes no sense at all  
Makes no sense at all  
Light of the world, i stand alone  
Cause i could not see the light of the world  
I was afraid, cause i could not see the light of the world  
Show me the fire, in a true believer's eye
