Address me in the eyes  
When you look at me and lie  
'Cause I know that you're wrong  
I know what's going on  
Decisions have been made  
A friendship's been betrayed  
So come back  
Pick up the drumming boys again  
  
[Chorus:]  
I know that stopping is hard to do  
But just think for one second  
To what this is doing to you  
But deep down inside  
This song's for another girl  
Who can take this pain away  
Once in a while  
I try to forget this hate  
I'll rest on it today  
  
Sitting on your bed  
The mind will just regress  
And things that once were  
We'll never be again  
Swallowing this dust  
I think about this trust  
That once was before  
But will never be again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Falling back  
To you  
And I won't  
And I won't  
And I try  
And I try  
Do you see  
That my jeans  
Have a c on the side  
Wanting more  
Not giving in  
And I won't  
And I won't  
And I try  
And I try  
Do you see  
That my jeans  
Have a c
