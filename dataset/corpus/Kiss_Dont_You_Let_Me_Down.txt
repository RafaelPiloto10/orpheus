Baby, don't you let me down (don't you let me down)  
Don't you leave me lonely (don't you leave me lonely)  
Don't you run around  
I said baby (baby) when I'm on the ground, yeah  
(When I'm on the ground)  
Try to keep my chin up, feel I'm fallin' farther down  
Ooh, you know I'm feelin' sorry  
But I know that won't do  
Ooh, looks like there's no tomorrow  
There's no tomorrow without you  
  
Baby (baby) don't you let me down (don't you let me down)  
Don't you leave me lonely (don't you leave me lonely)  
Or run around  
I said baby (baby) when I'm on the ground, yeah  
(When I'm on the ground)  
Try to keep my chin up, feel I'm fallin' farther down  
  
Ooh, remember when you smile so bright  
Raise my heart up to my throat  
Ooh, sure took hard times to drag me down  
So darlin' brighten up all of my hopes  
  
Baby (baby) when I'm on the ground, yeah  
(When I'm on the ground)  
Try to keep my chin up, feel I'm fallin' farther down  
Try to keep my chin up, feel I'm fallin' farther down  
  
Fallin' down, down, down  
Fallin' down, down, down  
Fallin' down, down, down  
Fallin' down, down, down  
Fallin' down, down, down  
Fallin' down, down, down  
Fallin' down, down, down  
Fallin' down, down, down  
Fallin' down, down, down  
Fallin' down, down, down  
Fallin' down, down, down  
Fallin' down, down, down  
Fallin'
