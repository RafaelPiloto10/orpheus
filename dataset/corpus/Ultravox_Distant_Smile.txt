Sometimes I find I drift away  
Behind a distant smile  
Light years ago I think someone spoke  
Quizzical glances behind cigarette smoke  
She drew the curtains at the end of the day  
And then we laughed because the room sailed away  
Fancy glitter in the summer arcades  
Then autumn leaves fall by a winter lane  
Piano echoes and the perfume still lingers  
But you fell through my fingers like sand  
With a distant smile  
A distant smile  
A distant smile  
Somehow I always seem to be  
Adrift in other times with a distant smile  
(???) the sound of the streets  
The city's glittering like diamonds in heat  
Our secret destination, touch down in the haze  
As the cameraman pans away  
Hey look, it's a long lost horizon  
Private oceans you can surface a sunrise in  
Hearts well ? dodging logic  
But nevertheless still permanently surprised  
Behind a distant smile  
A distant smile  
A distant smile  
Somehow I always seem to be  
Adrift in other times behind a distant smile  
You will see (?)
