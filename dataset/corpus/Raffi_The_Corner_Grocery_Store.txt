There was cheese, cheese, walkin' on its knees  
In the store, in the store  
There was cheese, cheese, walkin' on its knees  
In the corner grocery store  
  
[Chorus]  
My eyes are dim, I cannot see,  
I have not brought my specs with me  
I have not brought my specs with me  
  
There were plums, plums, twiddling their thumbs  
In the store, in the store  
There were plums, plums, twiddling their thumbs  
In the corner grocery store  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There was corn, corn, blowin' on a horn  
In the store, in the store  
There was corn, corn, blowin' on a horn  
In the corner grocery store  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There were beans, beans, trying on some jeans  
In the store, in the store  
There were beans, beans, trying on some jeans  
In the corner grocery store  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There was more, more, just inside the door  
In the store, in the store  
There was more, much more, just inside the door  
In the corner grocery store
