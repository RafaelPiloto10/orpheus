Seemed to stop my breath  
My head on your chest waiting to cave in  
From the bottom of my  
Hear your voice again  
Could we dim the sun and  
Wonder where we've been  
Maybe you and me so kiss me like you did  
My heart stopped beating such a softer sin  
I'm melting never caught my breath  
Every second I'm without you  
I'm a mess  
Ever know each other  
Trust these words  
Are stones  
My cuts aren't healing  
Learning how to love  
I'm melting I'm melting  
  
[Chorus]  
In your eyes  
I've lost my place could stay a while  
And I'm melting  
In your eyes like my first time  
That I caught fire  
Just stay with me lay with me  
  
You can stay and watch me fall  
And of course  
I'll ask for help  
And we could take our heads off  
Just stay in bed lets make love  
That's all  
  
Just stay with me now  
  
I'm melting  
I'm melting  
  
[Chorus]
