[Intro]  
Ra, ra, Cleopatra!  
Famous beauty coming at ya!  
Ra ra, patra Cleo!  
Guys all go gaga for me-o!  
  
[Verse 1]  
I am a leader  
And a lady and a queen  
I'm Cleopatra  
Such a queen, never been seen  
I am a pharoah  
Yet they're-o meant to be guys  
But I don't care-o  
I just wear-o beard disguise  
  
[Verse 2]  
My mum and dad were pharoahs  
I thought my rule's due  
But both my older sisters  
Thought that they should rule too  
  
[Verse 3]  
Oh dear, they both died!  
I wonder who that would leave  
Little me-o, pharoah Cleo?  
Okay, no time to grieve!  
  
[Verse 4]  
Think that's alarming, you'd be right  
But it gets worse  
Married my half brother  
And we ruled the universe  
  
[Verse 6]  
That bad romance  
Led to an overcrowded throne  
But then he died, boo-hoo  
So now I rule alone  
  
[Chorus]  
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah  
All hail lady Cleo!  
Wah, wah, wah, la, la  
Coolest pharoah by far!  
  
[Verse 7]  
Fashion topped my list of vices  
Bathed in asses' milk and spices  
Then I dressed like goddess Isis  
Long, black hair in ringlets nicest  
Viper's tooth for men entices  
Finest linen robe, top prices!  
  
[Verse 8]  
Married another brother  
He's an okay geezer  
But never told  
Of my love for Julius Caesar  
  
[Verse 9]  
Had Caesar's child and hoped  
That he'd be crowned king  
My bro said no, I said 'Oh! '  
And I murdered him  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause I am Cleopatra  
Egypt's royalty  
The ruling pharoah, don't you dare-o  
Mess with me!  
  
[Verse 10]  
My pokerface smiles  
Only when I see  
A man who takes my fancy like  
Oh! Mark Antony!  
  
[Chorus]  
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah  
Another Roman leader  
Wah, wah, wah, la, la  
No Egyptian crowd pleaser  
  
[Chorus]  
Ra, ra, Cleopatra!  
Finally, I'd met my matcher!  
Ra, ra, patra Cleo!  
Ends in death for him and me-o!  
  
[Outro]  
My life was a drama  
I was one kooky mama!  
Wah, wah, wah, you know  
Today I'd be a favourite of the  
Paparazzo!
