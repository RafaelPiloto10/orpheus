Don't thank me for what you got  
I've given you love I've given you too much thought  
Don't blame me for sinking the ship  
You're a hopeless liar and a hypocrite  
  
Only you know  
Only you know  
Only you know  
Only you know  
  
Don't thank me for what you got  
I've given you love I've given you too much thought  
Don't shame me for calling it quits  
You're a hopeless sinner and an optimist  
  
Only you know  
Only you know  
Only you know  
Only you know  
  
Hey, don't hate me for what you got  
I've given you drugs I've given you too much fun  
Don't blame me for flunking the test  
I would rather think that you were honest  
Don't blame me cause you got caught  
You've given me up, you've taken everything I got  
Those lies came straight from your mouth  
I never dreamed that you would be a sellout  
  
Only you know  
Only you know  
Only you know  
Only you know  
  
Don't use me as your last crutch  
I've taken you in, I've trusted you way too much  
Don't wear me around your wrist  
You should've thought it through before you blew it  
Same day, same life, different person  
Your ghost, my pride, perfect  
Don't hate me for what you got  
I've given you love, I've given you too much thought.  
Don't shame me for sinking the ship  
You're a hopeless liar and a hypocrite  
Don't hate me for what you're not  
I'm aiming your gun  
I'm lining up the perfect shot  
Don't waste me  
On something stupid like this  
  
I would rather die than take your bullet  
I would rather die than take your bullet  
I would rather die than take your bullet  
I would rather die than take your bullet  
I would rather die than take your bullet  
  
Only you know  
Only you know  
Only you know  
Only you know  
  
Only you know  
Only you know  
Only you know  
Only you know
