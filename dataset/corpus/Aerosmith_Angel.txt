I'm alone, yeah, I don't know if I can face the night  
I'm in tears and the cryin' that I do is for you  
I want your love  
Let's break the walls between us  
Don't make it tough  
I'll put away my pride  
Enough's enough  
I've suffered and I've seen the light  
  
[Chorus]  
Bayayby, you're my angel  
Come and save me tonight  
You're my angel  
Come and make it alright  
  
Don't know what I'm gonna do about this feeling inside  
Yes it's true, loneliness took me for a ride  
Without your love I'm nothing but a beggar  
Without your love a dog without a bone  
What can I do? I'm sleepin' in this bed alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Come and save me tonight  
You're the reason I live  
You're the reason I die  
You're the reason I give when I break down and cry  
Don't need no reason why  
Baby, baby, bayayby  
You're my angel  
Come and save me tonight  
You're my angel  
Yeah, come and make it alright  
You're my angel  
Come and save me tonight  
You're my angel  
Come and take me alright  
Come and save me tonight  
Come and save me tonight  
Come and save me tonight  
Come and save me tonight  
Come and save me tonight
