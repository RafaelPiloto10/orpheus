Too doo dup too doo doo doo doo doo  
You're just a little baby boy six months old lying in your mama's lap  
I'm sittin' here thinkin' of a song I could sing to get you to take a nap  
You were born on the part of the river of life where the water is troubled and
deep  
This day and time there are not many songs to sing a little baby to sleep  
Too doo dup too doo doo doo doo doo  
I search my mind for a proper subject to set down the reason and rhyme  
And I got to thinking it might have been better to be born at some other time  
I know you're tired and I know you're weary and I don't like to see you weep  
But there just don't seem to be any songs going to sing a little baby to sleep  
Too doo dup too doo doo doo doo doo  
I'll rock your cradle and your mama will croon that's all the comfort we know  
You need a song you can keep on singing cause you've got a long way to go  
Faith writes the words and love writes the music and hope can establish the
beat  
Your generation might know a song to sing a little baby to sleep  
Too doo dup too doo doo doo doo doo
