Tell me a secret, tell me anything  
What's your weapon? What's your middle name?  
What do you believe in? What's your animal?  
Are you a cat or a dog person?  
What's your outlook? What's your favourite saying?  
  
Hey, maybe you laugh, maybe you laugh a lot  
Maybe you started, but you somehow quit the part  
And you may be a hippie and a democrat,  
Yeah I remember that, I think  
And you might like wine, but you're not the type who likes to drink  
  
What made me, forget everything I know?  
All my beliefs, replaced by scenarios  
Of unintelligent life, echoing in stereo  
On invisible mics, winding to my mind  
So I would like another look inside you,  
Yeah I would love the chance to love you, like I'd never known you  
  
Yeah, maybe you're sleeping on a telephone.  
And maybe you're dreaming of an anglophone with a crooked smile  
And maybe your profile, boasts a brand new nose  
And maybe your new job, it requires that you cannot wear any clothes.  
  
What made me, forget everything I know?  
All my beliefs, replaced by scenarios  
Of unintelligent life, echoing in stereo  
On invisible mics, wired into my mind  
So I would like another look inside you,  
Yeah I would love the chance to love you, like I've never known you  
  
After all, I have fallen  
  
Maybe your favourite colour is brown,  
And maybe your crying and you're not sure why  
Maybe you're living in a whole new town  
And maybe you're back with your old boyfriend and you're busy going down.  
  
What made me, forget everything?  
All my beliefs, are my memories  
All the episodes of you, especially the ones that hurt  
And even the few that made me laugh  
Well I can't get them back,  
That's why I'm asking for some more of you now  
Yes I would love the chance to love you  
And I would love to love you!  
  
What made me, forget everything I know?  
All my beliefs, replaced by scenarios  
Of unintelligent life, echoing in stereo  
On invisible mics, wired into my mind  
So I would like another look inside you,  
Yes I would love the chance to love you, I would love to love you  
  
Yes I would love the chance to love you  
Like I'd never known you
