What makes a man go crazy when a woman wears her dress so tight  
What makes a man go crazy when a woman wears that ol' dress so tight  
Must be the same ol' thing that make a tom cat fight all night  
Now, why do all the big men try to run a big-legged woman down  
Now, why do all the big men try to run a big ol' woman down  
Must be the same ol' thing that makes a bulldog a huggling 'round  
It's that ol' same thing, now tell me who's to blame  
The whole world is fighting about that ol' same thing  
What make you feel so good when your baby's in her evening gown  
When your baby get a little bit of an evening gown  
Must be that same ol' thing that makes a preacher lay his bible down  
It's that ol' same thing, it's that ol' same thing
