Don't try to cry your way out of this  
Don't try to lie or I'll catch you in it  
Don't try to make me feel sorry for you  
Just because I'm blond  
Don't think I'm dumb  
Cause this dumb blond ain't nobody's fool  
  
When you left you thought I'd sit  
An' you thought I'd wait  
An' you thought I'd cry  
You called me a dumb blond  
Ah, but somehow I lived through it  
And you know if there's one thing this blond has learned  
Blonds have more fun  
  
You flew too high up off the ground  
It's stormy weather an' had to come back down  
But I've found a new thread for my old spool  
Just because I'm blond  
Don't think I'm dumb  
Cause this dumb blond ain't nobody's fool
