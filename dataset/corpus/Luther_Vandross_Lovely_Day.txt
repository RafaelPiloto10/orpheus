When I wake up in the morning, love  
And the sunlight hurts my eyes  
And something strange without a warning, love  
Bears heavy on my mind  
  
[Chorus]  
Then I look at you  
And the world is all right with me  
Just one look at you  
And I know it's gonna be  
A lovely day  
lovely day, lovely day, lovely day  
  
When the day that lies ahead of me  
Seems impossible to face  
When somebody else instead of me  
Always seems to know the way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's gonna be a lovely day (it's gonna be)  
It's gonna be today  
It's gonna be a lovely day  
Today I love the world and I love you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's gonna be today  
A lovely day today  
It's gonna be today  
A lovely day today
