A Cosmopolitan, a Manhattan  
Call me one  
Pour a round for me and my friends  
Cape Cod Sea Breeze, Long Island Ice Teas  
I won't go there or drink it if you paid me  
  
When they come to waylay me  
When they close in for the capture  
I did it all  
I did it all  
For the love and the laughter  
I did it all  
I did it all  
I did it all  
  
Slept in late  
Stayed up for days  
Partied hard  
Lived my twenties in haze  
Smoked second-hand in crowded bars  
With the A-list of B-list movie stars  
  
When they come to arrest me  
Pat me down and undress me  
I'll confess without miranda  
Strike a pose for the tabloid cameras  
I did it all  
I did it all  
I did it all  
  
I did it all  
I didn't ask permission  
I did it all  
What kind of life  
Is not an exhibition  
I did it all  
Crash and burn  
And then you know you're living  
I did it all  
Some pain a few tears after  
I did it all  
To the last line of the final chapter  
I did it all  
I did it all  
  
My heat is a wound that festers  
Seduced my share in silk and polyester  
Oh my great loves  
And my few losses  
I'll tell it all  
When my little black book is published  
  
When they come to interview me  
For my made for TV movie  
Say I'm the bitch who was a bastard  
Who did it all for the love and laughter  
I did it all  
I did it all  
I did it all
