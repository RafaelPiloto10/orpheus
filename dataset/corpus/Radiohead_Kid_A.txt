I slip away  
I slipped on a little white lie  
  
We've got heads on sticks  
You've got ventriloquists  
We've got heads on sticks  
You've got ventriloquists  
  
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed  
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed  
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed  
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed  
  
The rats and children follow me out of town  
The rats and children follow me out of town  
Come on kids
