Nothing can survive in a vacuum  
No one can exists all alone  
We pretend things only happen to strangers  
We've all got problems of our own  
  
It's enough to learn  
To share our pleasures  
We can't sooth pain with sympathy  
All that we can do is be reminded  
We shake our heads at the tragedy  
  
Every day we're standing  
In a time capsule  
Racing down a river from the past  
Every day we're standing  
In a wind tunnel  
Facing down the future coming fast  
  
It's just the age  
It's just a stage --  
We disengage --  
We turn the page...  
  
Looking at  
The long-range forecast  
Catching all the names in the news  
Checking out  
The state of the nation  
Learning the environmental blues  
  
Truth is after all a moving target  
Hairs to split,  
And pieces that don't fit How can anybody be enlightened?  
Truth is after all so poorly lit
