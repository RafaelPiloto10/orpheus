The air is warm  
I hear the wind and the trees  
I know I'm there, but I'll never be  
The wind is soft tonight, the tide is low  
And I know the way  
(I never felt better now)  
  
Sometimes life, it moves too slow  
Slows to a crawl, and then the poetry is lost  
And without speed, hope becomes certainty  
And for once I'm certain  
(I never felt better now)  
  
A garden is it's own perfect world  
Where everything has a place  
Every leaf, every stone, every speck of dirt  
But where's my place?  
I even tried to get arrested today  
But everyone looked the other way  
I count the hours, and I count the days  
But for once I'm certain  
  
Don't want your help  
Don't need your help  
Don't want your help  
Don't need your help  
Helpless  
  
You found a way to make me say  
Help me please someone  
  
The water's clear  
I see that it's full of dimes  
For every wish, I wonder why  
Why all I want is something beautiful  
A place to rest  
(I never felt better now)  
HELP
