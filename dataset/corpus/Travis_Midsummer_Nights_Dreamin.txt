Do it to me  
Do it to me  
Do it again  
Takin' me high  
  
Takin' me low  
Takin' ma friends  
Think I'm a fool  
Leavin' the school  
  
Bending them rules  
But do it to me  
Do it to me  
Do it again  
  
Mid summer nights dreamin'  
You might treat me right i  
Had too much to drink  
Don't ask me now  
  
Head in the sink  
Do it to me  
Do it to you  
Do it to them  
  
So much to see  
So much to do  
So little time  
You're breakin' ma heart  
  
You're makin' me cry  
You're stealin' ma soul  
You don't even try  
But do it to me  
  
Do it to you  
Do it to them  
Mid summer nights dreamin'  
You might treat me right i  
  
Had too much to drink  
Don't ask me now  
Head in the sink
