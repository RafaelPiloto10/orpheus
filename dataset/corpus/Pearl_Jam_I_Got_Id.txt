My lips are shakin', my nails are bit off. Been a month since I heard myself
talk.  
All the advantage this life's got on me.. Picture a cup in the middle of the
sea.  
And I fight back in my mind.  
Never let's be right.  
I got memories I got shit.  
So much it don't show.  
  
  
I walked in light, when you held me in that night.  
I walked the line, when you held my hand that night.  
  
  
An empty shell seems so easy to crack.  
Got all these questions don't know who I could even ask.  
So I'll just lie alone and wait for the dream, where I'm not ugly and you're
lookin' at me.  
And I stay in bed, all blue I've seen hell.  
If just once I could feel love, stare back at me.  
But I walked in light, when you held me in that night.  
I walked the line, when you held my hand that night.  
I walked in light, when you held me close that night.  
I paid the price never held you in real life...  
my lips are shakin'...
