I see you jaded like a debutante  
Things your image never shows  
There's something hiding deep inside of you  
Something that I'll never know  
Then I saw you on the streets alone  
Had you paged on the corner phone  
The words just kept me straining to express  
You're hard to break and you still ache  
Like a young girl, like a young girl's heart  
Like a young girl, just like a young girl's heart  
I stand here waiting in my lily white  
Scan the lines you'll be famous for  
Then we'll talk about what's good and what's bad  
Romantic moves we won't have to score  
Like you were saying what you really want  
Ah, it's funny you should ask me now  
It was all right there in the story I just read  
I'm hard to break and you still ache  
Like a young girl, like a young girl's heart  
Like a young girl, just like a young girl's heart  
Like a young girl, just like a young girl's heart  
Like a young girl, like a young girl's heart  
Just like a young girl, like a young girl's heart  
Like a young girl, just like a young girl's heart  
Like a young girl, like a young girl's heart  
Like a young girl, just like a young girl's heart  
Like a young girl, like a young girl's heart  
Just like a young girl's heart
