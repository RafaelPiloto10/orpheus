Today, I'm the dirt beneath your feet  
At your beckon call  
Today, I'm down on my bended knees  
I learn to crawl  
  
Days like these  
It's like I never lived at all  
  
And my heart is open and my eyes are open  
Today, I give my life to you  
And my arms are open and my faith is open  
Today, the Devil sings the blues  
  
Tonight, angels' presence fill the room  
So, this is how it feels  
Tonight, the Devil takes the long way round  
There will be no deal  
  
Times like these  
It's like I never lived at all  
  
And my heart is open and my eyes are open  
Tonight, I give my life to you  
And my arms are open and my faith is open  
Tonight, the Devil sings the blues  
  
And my heart is open and my eyes are open  
Tonight, I give my life to you  
And my arms are open and my faith is open  
Tonight, the Devil sings the blues
