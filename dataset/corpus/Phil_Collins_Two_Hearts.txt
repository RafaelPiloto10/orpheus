Well, there was no reason to believe she'd always be there  
But if you don't put faith in what you believe in  
It's getting you nowhere  
'Cos it hurts, you never let go  
Don't look down, just look up  
Cos she's always there to behind you, just to remind you  
  
Two hearts, believing in just one mind  
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind  
  
'Cos there's no easy way to, to understand it  
There's so much of my life in her, and it's like I'm blinded  
And it teaches you to never let go  
There's so much love you'll never know  
She can reach you no matter how far  
Wherever you are  
  
Two hearts, believing in just one mind  
Beating together till the end of time  
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind  
Together forever till the end of time  
  
She knows (she knows)  
There'll always be a special place in my heart for her  
She knows, she knows, she knows  
Yeah, she knows (she knows)  
No matter how far apart we are  
She knows, I'm always right there beside her  
  
We're two hearts, believing in just one mind  
Beating together till the end of time  
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind  
Together forever till the end of time  
  
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind  
Together forever, til the end of time  
Two hearts two hearts, believing in just one mind  
Beating together til the end of time
