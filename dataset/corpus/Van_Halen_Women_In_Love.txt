My heart, you're breakin' my heart.  
Girl, you better start thinkin' somethin' real.  
Seems like loving you is just a crazy dream,  
But do as you feel.  
All these crazy women,  
One more crazy night.  
But one night's all we're given,  
So, baby, leave me alone, or, baby, stay the night.  
(oh, women in love)  
Oh baby, make up your mind.  
(make up your mind)  
I know you're in love,  
So, baby, make up your mind.  
Scream, go on and scream that your love is all you're  
Knowin'.  
But, honey, if you're needing a woman just as bad as me,  
You ought to be goin'.  
All these crazy women,  
One more crazy night.  
But one night's all we're given,  
So, baby, leave me alone, or, baby, stay the night.  
(oh, women in love)  
Oh baby, make up your mind.  
(make up your mind)  
I know you're in love,  
So, baby, make up your mind.
