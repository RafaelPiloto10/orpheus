Oh baby, what a place to be  
In the service of the bourgeoisie  
Where can my believers be  
I want to jump into the endless sea  
  
Oh, oh the endless sea  
Oh, oh the endless sea  
I want to jump into the endless sea  
Let it wash all over me  
  
Above us is a dirty sky  
Full of youths and liquors  
A little girl, a little guy  
This air can't get much thicker  
  
Oh, oh the endless sea  
Oh, oh the endless sea  
Oh, oh the endless sea  
Let it wash all over me  
  
And when you're tight for the rent  
You think you're gonna break  
But you know it's no damn good  
Just one more phony on the take  
You better go home, buddy  
  
I really think,  
You better go home, buddy  
You better go home, buddy  
The endless sea
