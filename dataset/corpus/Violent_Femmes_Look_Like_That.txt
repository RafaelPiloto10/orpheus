I like his shoes I like his hat  
I'd like me better if I looked like that  
Uh -huh uh-huh  
I like her shoes I like her hat  
I'd like you better if you looked like that  
Uh-huh uh-huh  
But then my love starts burning  
For what we are yearning to ignore  
I like her clothes I love her dress  
I'd like her better if she loved me best  
I like his shoes I love his pants  
I'd want him better if he wanted to dance  
Uh-huh uh-huh  
But then our love starts turning  
For what we are learning to adore  
I'm meeting people nice people too  
I'm meeting people nice people like you  
We're meeting people nice people too  
We're meeting people nice people like you
