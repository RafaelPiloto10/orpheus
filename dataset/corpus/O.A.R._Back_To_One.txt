I see you there,  
But you don't look right  
You got a ten mile stare,  
In your eyes tonight  
Time ain't fair,  
Like it used to be  
  
We're all dressed up,  
Nowhere to go  
We lost our way,  
About halfway home  
And we hurt the ones  
Who get too close  
  
Don't look back,  
You'll never find your way  
There's a million different people  
Who break the same way  
When everything has come undone,  
We got to bring it back to one  
Back to one  
We're all caught up  
In what used to be  
A grounded love,  
And some memories  
Why do I hurt the ones  
Who get close to me?  
Darling, are you listening?  
  
Don't look back,  
You'll never find your way  
There's a million different people  
Who break the same way  
Forget about the things we've done,  
And bring it back to one  
More night,  
Another's on the way  
We're all a little different,  
But break the same way  
When everything becomes undone,  
Bring it back to one  
Bring it back to one more night  
Bring it back to one  
Let's bring it back to one  
Bring it back to one  
It's just beyond my reach  
So bring me back to one  
  
I know forever always asks so much,  
Don't you let it scare you  
Don't you lose your touch  
And when your still waters start to run,  
Bring it back to one  
  
One more night,  
Another's on the way  
We're all a little different,  
But break the same way  
When everything becomes un-  
Everything becomes un-  
Don't look back  
We'll never find the way  
A million different people will break  
The same way  
When everything becomes undone,  
Bring it back to one
