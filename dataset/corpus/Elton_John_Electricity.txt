I can't really explain it  
I haven't got the words  
It's a feeling that you can't control  
I suppose its like forgetting,  
Losing who you are,  
And at the same time,  
Something makes you whole,  
Its like that there's a music,  
Playing in your ear,  
And I'm listening, and I'm listening  
And then I disappear  
  
And then I feel a change  
Like a fire deep inside  
Something bursting me wide open  
Impossible to hide  
  
And suddenly I'm flying  
Flying like a bird  
Like electricity  
Electricity  
Sparks inside of me  
And I'm free, I'm free  
  
It's a bit like being angry,  
It's a bit like being scared,  
Confused and all mixed up,  
And mad as hell,  
It's like when you've been crying,  
And you're empty, and you're full,  
I don't know what it is,  
It's hard to tell,  
  
Its like that there's some music,  
Playing in your ear,  
But the music,  
Is impossible,  
Impossible to hear,  
  
But then I feel it move me,  
Like a burning deep inside,  
Something bursting me wide open  
Impossible to hide  
  
Then suddenly I'm flying  
Flying like a bird  
Like electricity  
Electricity  
Sparks inside of me  
And I'm free, I'm free  
  
Electricity  
Sparks inside of me  
And I'm free, I'm free  
Oh oh whoa.  
I'm free.
