And over in the teacher's home she waited by the phone  
For calls which never rang, and people who never sang  
Train man rambled dusty into town and made his daily round  
Train man and he comes in the night  
Brings her no love but he's right  
Yes he's right  
  
Through fog and misty morning dew, she'd seen his oily face  
And he had touched her heart, taken it apart  
  
Though he never stopped to speak a word his voice was all she heard  
Train man and he comes in the night  
  
Brings her no love but he's right  
  
Little girl you're a pretty little girl  
Yes he's right  
Won't you come with me a while  
Little girl in your frilly little world  
Won't you give me your sweet smile  
(first solo)  
  
If you come tonight bring someone  
If you come tonight bring someone  
Don't come alone  
  
If you come alone don't come  
Don't come  
Don't come  
(solo)  
Yes I know he's right  
  
Yes I know he's right  
Oh I know he's right  
fade...  
She held his hand and whispered soft  
  
I love you train man  
He just grumbled like engine as it rumbles  
And said someday  
Train man and he knows something's wrong and he's right  
Oh yes he's right
