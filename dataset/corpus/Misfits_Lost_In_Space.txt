Go!  
  
Of all the things they taught you I'm telling you this son  
All the wars fought before won't compare to this one  
Giant spiders prepare to take over  
  
Here comes another mutant suicide-squad  
You blast them out but now you're way off course  
You start to shiver and shake  
I'm calling you Houston  
  
Am I following all the right leads?  
or am I about to get lost in space?  
When my time comes they'll write my destiny  
Will you take this ride?  
  
Communication's lost we crash to the earth  
Too late to see the giant spider monster giving birth  
The future is here and here is the future  
  
Am I following all the right leads?  
or am I about to get lost in space?  
When my time comes they'll write my destiny  
Will you take this ride with me?
