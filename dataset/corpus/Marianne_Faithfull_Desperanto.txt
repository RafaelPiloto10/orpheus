Desperanto spoken here,  
Today I hear it everywhere,  
It is the language of Despair  
It's in your nails and It's in your hair  
It's in your mouth instead of air  
It's in your house  
It's in your heart  
It's in your mind  
It's everywhere  
  
It's in your heart  
It's in your heart  
It's in your blood  
It's in your prayer  
C'mon baby get over here  
It's in your mouth  
  
In your mouth  
In your mouth  
In your mouth  
It's in your mouth instead of air  
It's in your breath  
It's in your blood  
It's in your heart  
It's in your blood  
It's in your heart  
It's everywhere  
  
Everybody loves my baby  
Everybody loves my baby  
Everybody loves my baby now  
I know baby you don't care  
To speak in Desperanto here  
And I know you'd never dare  
To speak the language of despair  
C'mon baby get over here  
C'mon baby get over here  
It's in your mouth  
  
It's in your hair  
It's in your tiny little prayer  
It's in your tiny little prayer  
It's in your tiny little prayer  
C'mon baby get over here  
C'mon baby get over here  
It's in your heart  
It's in your heart  
It's in your heart  
It's everywhere  
  
Everybody loves my baby  
Everybody loves my baby  
Everybody loves my baby now  
The Desperanto they are broken here  
Broken darlin' by Despair  
The rain it speaks  
The wind the air  
  
Today I hear it everywhere  
It's in your tiny little prayer  
It's in your tiny little prayer  
It's in your breath  
It's in your tears  
  
This has been going on for years  
It's in your mouth  
In your mouth  
In your mouth  
In your mouth  
  
C'mon baby get over here  
It's in your mouth  
It's in your mouth  
It's in your blood  
It's everywhere  
  
It's in your mouth  
It's in your mouth  
In your blood  
It's everywhere  
It's in your mouth  
  
In your mouth, and  
Everybody loves my baby  
Everybody loves my baby  
Everybody loves my baby now  
Everybody loves my baby  
Everybody loves my baby  
Everybody loves my baby now
