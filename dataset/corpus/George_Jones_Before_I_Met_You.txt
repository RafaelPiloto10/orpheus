I thought I had seen pretty girls in my time  
But that was before I met you  
I never saw one that I wanted for mine  
But that was before I met you.  
  
I thought I was swinging the world by the tail  
I thought I could never be blue  
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved  
But that was before I met you.  
  
I wanted to ramble and always be free  
But that was before I met you  
I said that no woman could ever hold me  
But that was before I met you.  
  
They tell me I must reap just what I have sown  
But darling I hope it's not true  
For once I made plans about living alone  
But that was before I met you...
