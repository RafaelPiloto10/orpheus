The lady you see me with now and again in this dimly lit hideway place  
With eyes deep as midnight and smooth golden skin  
And that warm look of love on her face  
And you say ain't he lucky just look at those eyes  
She's worth any price you can name  
And you think that she's mine but you don't realize  
I'm just someplace to come when it rains  
Someplace to hide when she's tired of the ride just someone to soften my pain  
Lord knows where she plays on her warm sunny days  
I'm just someplace to come when she can't find the sun  
Just someplace to come when it rains  
The lady she dances so close in your arms you swear she can float you away  
And gives you the feeling you're safe from all harm  
Just as long as she holds you that way  
And I can't say it's wrong cause I've known all along  
That her lovin' is worth all the pain  
So whenever she leads I'll be there when she needs someplace to come when it
rains  
Someplace to hide when she's tired...
