If you ever leave me, I'll be sadand blue  
Don't you ever leave me, I'm so in love with you  
The birds in the sky would be sad and lonely,  
If they knew that I lost my one and only,  
They'd be sad if you're bad to me  
The leaves on the trees would be softly sighin  
If they heard from the breeze that you left me crying,  
They'd be sad, don't be bad to me  
But I know you won't leave me cause you told me so,  
And I've no intention of letting you go,  
Just as long as you let me know, you won't be bad to me  
So the birds in the sky won't be sad and lonely,  
Cause they know I got my one and only  
They'd be glad that you're not bad to me  
But I know you won't leave me cause you told me so,  
And I've no intention of letting you go,  
Just as long as you let me know, you won't be bad to me  
So the birds in the sky won't be sad and lonely,  
" Cos they know I got my one and only  
They'd be glad that you're not bad to me,  
They'd be glas that you're not bad to me, to me, to me
