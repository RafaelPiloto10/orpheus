Starlight on my face  
Moon bright on the ground  
Fill this empty space  
Rest the travel bound  
After weary days  
Lady luck please smile  
Show the many ways  
We can go where wishes go  
Let's chase the shadow child  
  
Here in my dreams  
Love is warm, love is golden  
Causin' me to believe  
I have touch, I have seen  
  
Sunshine of the night  
Dance on crystal streams  
All the things  
That wishes bring  
Are living in my dreams  
  
Break  
  
Here in my dreams  
Love is warm, love is golden  
Causin' me to believe  
I have touch, I have seen  
  
Sunshine of the night  
Dance on crystal streams  
All the things  
That wishes bring  
Are living in my dreams  
  
Here in my dreams  
Love is warm, love is golden  
Causin' me to believe  
I have touch, I have seen  
  
Here in my dreams  
Love is warm, love is golden  
Causin' me to believe  
I have touch, I have seen
