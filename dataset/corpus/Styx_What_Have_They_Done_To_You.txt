There must be something out there,  
There must be something real  
Well this mystery's a nightmare  
And I don't know what to feel  
Well I heard you had a hell of a time there  
I guess it chilled you down to the bone  
If there's one thing I can tell you  
It'll never leave you less than alone  
  
In spite of everything you told me  
In spite of everything I've heard  
There's nothing here that I call holy  
Not a solitary word  
Could you tell me what it's like on the outside  
Were you really lost and out of control  
Were you reaching for your freedom  
When the gatekeeper called for the toll  
  
Oh-oh, what have they done to you  
Where, where have you gone  
Oh-oh, I want to run to you  
In spite of what you're saying  
I still can't let you go  
  
Well they say you witnessed some kind of lefe there  
Was it something real or nothing at all  
Or is your imagination all that's there to catch you  
If you start to fall  
  
Oh-oh, what have they done to you  
Where, where have you gone  
Oh-oh I want to run to you  
In spite of what you're saying  
I still can't let you go  
  
Oh-oh, what have they done to you  
Where, where have you gone  
Oh-oh I want to run to you  
In spite of what you're saying  
I still can't let you go  
  
What have they done to you
