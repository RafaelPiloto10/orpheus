Not much difference 'tween a cow and you  
Flesh, blood, bones  
She cries like you do  
Cries like you do  
  
Yours is the hippest hypocritical point of view  
Wake up and realise the things that you do  
You're busy whipping Hitler 'cause he gassed so many Jews  
You're as guilty of murder - look at what you chew  
Everybody's worried 'bout a Third World War  
Nuclear annihilation, need I say more?  
While you're feasting at the peace meeting  
Feasting at the peace meeting  
Wake up!  
Flesh, blood, bones  
Peace on earth and goodwill to all men  
The lower species we will condemn  
While we're feasting at the peace meeting  
Feasting at the peace meeting  
  
She cries like you do  
Cries like you do  
She cries like you do  
She cries like you do oo oo oo !!
