I'll be around no matter how you treat me now  
I'll be around from now on  
Your latest love can never last, and when it's past  
I'll be around when she's gone  
Goodbye again, and if you find a love like mine  
Just now and then, drop me a line to say you're feeling fine  
And when things go wrong, perhaps you'll see you're meant for me  
So I'll be around when she's gone  
Just now and then, drop me a line to say you're feeling fine  
And when things go wrong, perhaps you'll see you're meant for me  
So I'll be around when she's gone
