Sometimes it's hard to know that it's all over  
Sometimes it hurts so bad  
To think that we did feel much for each other  
Yet lost what we once have  
  
To love you is one thing I can do  
I have always been around to love you  
  
But times when I'm alone I feel so empty  
I've always wished you're here  
And now you're gone and all is gone forever  
Oh girl, it's so unfair  
  
Remember the things I always say  
I made them all so please believe the things  
That I've been telling you  
  
Just hang on  
Who knows we might get there  
After all the waiting done  
We'll be the ones to find out  
If we hang on  
You know we're on our way  
So just hang on  
  
At times when I'm alone I feel so empty  
I've always wished you're here  
When I look at the sky  
I see your memory  
That was where I used to be  
  
I love you  
I always think of you  
Please listen to the words I say  
These words that I've been telling you  
  
Just hang on  
Who knows we might get there  
After all the waiting done  
We'll be the ones to find out  
If we hang on  
  
Just hang on  
Who knows we might get there  
After all the waiting done  
We'll be the ones to find out  
If we hang on  
You know we're on our way  
So just hang on  
  
If we hang on
