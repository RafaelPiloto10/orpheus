Love ridden, I've looked at you  
With the focus I gave to my birthday candles  
I've wished on the lidded blue flame  
Under your brow  
And baby, I wished for you  
Nobody sees when you are lying in your bed  
And I want to crawl in with you  
But I cry instead  
I want your warm, but it will only make  
Me colder when it's over  
So I can't tonight, baby  
  
No, not "baby" anymore-if I need you  
I'll just use your simple name  
Only kisses on the cheek from now on  
And in a little while, we'll only have to wave  
  
My hand won't hold you down no more  
The path is clear to follow through  
I stood too long in the way of the door  
And now I'm giving up on you  
  
No, not "baby" any more-if I need you  
I'll just use your simple name  
Only kisses on the cheek from now on  
And in a little while, we'll only have to wave
