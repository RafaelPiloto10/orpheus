  
  
(Shaggy 2 Dope)  
Dearest almight creator...  
  
(Violent J)  
I've lived one hell of a life, if your to take it tonite  
I've lived the life of a king, but so much to darken the light  
  
(Shaggy 2 Dope)  
Lookin 360 degrees, 2 hundred thousand disease  
How can I lay back and chill, so many down on there knees  
  
(Violent J)  
But then again who am I, I'm just some typical guy  
I ain't no fuckin hero, I just been wonderin why....  
  
(Chorus)  
I seen some children crossing the bridge  
What kind of life did they get to live?  
What kind of choice do they get to make?  
What if it was a child's mistake?  
  
(Violent J)  
I'll never question the book, but let's say I lived by the book  
I never ate meat on Tuesdays, how much bigger would my wings look?  
  
(Shaggy 2 Dope)  
I try to pray everyday, but sometimes get lost on the way  
I seen the holiest spirit, so much to miss lead the way  
  
(Violent J)  
I gave the visions I got, I been told i'm gonna rot  
Inside the devil's intestines, I'm still here holdin my spot  
  
(Chorus)  
  
(Breakdown)  
Come on up and open up your door  
What if it's a pergatory door (repeat)  
(fuckin take me instead)  
  
(Chorus)2x
