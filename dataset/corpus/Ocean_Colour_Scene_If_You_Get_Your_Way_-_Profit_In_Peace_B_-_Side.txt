She is home  
Tellin' she's the one  
Who makes you well  
She makes you feel okay  
  
She is home  
Tellin' she's the one  
Who makes you go  
And sends you on your way  
  
But she's getting something  
You start to feel  
She blows the faster deal [?]  
  
She is there  
Making up the face  
To hide the scar  
You won't lurk beneath it  
  
She is there  
She's got more than anyone  
And so I've always thought she must deserve it  
  
And if you get your way  
I may blow the faster deal [?]  
  
Everyone  
Hope's say I the one(?? ?)  
I wish you well  
I hope you feel okay  
(repeat)  
  
And if you get your way  
Feel the way you're feeling  
(x3)
