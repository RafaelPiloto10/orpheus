Good morning my love  
The skies are clearing up today  
Can I kiss you on the boob like I did yesterday?  
  
You let me in, you let me sin  
You made me cry, you got me high  
  
Can I touch you in the nude?  
You lookin' really good in bed  
How come you ain't talkin' like we was yesterday?  
  
You let me in, you let me sin  
You made me cry, you got me high  
  
Wake up little wakeup  
Got somethin' to say  
Don't move a muscle  
I'm gettin' dressed and I can't stay  
  
Ohh, you let me in, you let me sin  
You made me cry, you got me high  
  
You let me in, you got me high,  
Got me high, got me high, high, high  
Good morning love,  
Good morning my love
