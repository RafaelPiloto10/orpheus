I'll say good-bye for now  
All this love burns away  
Did you love for long?  
I'll let the boys come in  
They'll crawl for you  
Here am I  
Not talking  
Here am I  
Not sleeping  
Here am I  
There's no more I can do  
Here am I  
There's no more I can say  
Here am I  
Not talking  
Here am I  
Not sleeping  
Here am I  
There's no more I can do  
Here am I  
There's no more I can say to you  
I'm so tired of this  
Please send in someone else  
You play games with me  
But did you win?  
How do you feel?
