You're no good, heart breaker,  
You're a liar and you're a cheat,  
And I don't know why  
I let you do these things to me.  
  
My friends keep telling me  
That you ain't no good.  
But oh, they don't know  
That I'd leave you if I could.  
  
I guess I'm uptight  
And I'm stuck like glue  
Cause I ain't never  
No, I ain't never, I ain't never loved,  
Loved a man the way that I love you.  
  
Some time ago I thought  
You had run out of fools  
But I was so wrong,  
You got one that you'll never lose.  
The way you treat me is a shame  
How could you hurt me so bad?  
Baby, don't you know that I'm the best thing  
That you'll ever had  
Kiss me once again,  
  
Don't you never, never say that we we're through  
Cause I ain't never  
No, I ain't never, I ain't never loved,  
Loved a man the way that I, I love you.  
  
I can't sleep at night  
And I can't even fight  
I guess I'll never be free  
Since you got your hooks in me.  
  
Whoa, oh, oh  
Yeah! Yeah!  
I ain't never loved a man, baby,  
I ain't never loved a man,  
Ain't never had a man hurt me so bad,  
I ain't never loved a man.
