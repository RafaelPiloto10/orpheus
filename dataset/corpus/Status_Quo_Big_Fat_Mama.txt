Say you need me, say you need me  
Tell me that you want my love  
Say you will be mine and I am yours  
You think that you're way above me  
I'm telling you that I can see  
All those things that you might wanna be  
I am yours tonight  
You be mine tonight  
  
You keep telling me you're not having me  
I'm telling you that I can see  
All the things that you might wanna be  
Say you need me, say you need me  
Tell me that you want my love  
Say will be mine and I am yours  
I am yours tonight  
You be mine tonight  
  
I got a big fat Mama  
With a big fat boy  
Really thinks she's something else  
But I love that woman  
Like fish loves the water  
And there is nobody else  
I'm gonna tell you woman better do as you're told  
If you don't, I'm gonna bring you down  
I've got a big fat Mama  
And there's no one else around  
  
I said say you need me  
Come on and say you need me  
I said say you need me  
  
Say you need me  
Come on and say you need me  
I said say you need me
