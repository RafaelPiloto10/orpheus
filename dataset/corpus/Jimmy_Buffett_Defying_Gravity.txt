I live on a big round ball  
I never do dream I may fall  
And even one day if I do  
Well I'll jump up and smile back at you  
I don't even know where we are  
They tell me were circling a star  
Well I'll take their word, I don't know  
But I'm dizzy so it may be so  
  
I'm riding a big round ball  
I never do dream I may fall  
And even the high must lay low  
But when I do fall I will be glad to go  
Yes when I do fall I will be glad to go
