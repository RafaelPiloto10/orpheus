After all the things that you have shown me  
I'd be a fool to let them slip away  
In doing things I know I shouldn't do  
But I don't want to fall away from you  
From you  
  
After all  
I've only grieved your spirit  
And then I don't know why you stay with me  
But every time I fall, your love comes through  
And I don't want to fall away from you  
  
When the light is gone  
And good times are getting old  
There's no one left to count on  
And all my friends are cold  
When I thirst for love, oh Lord  
You're a fountain to my soul  
My soul  
My soul  
Oh lord  
My soul  
  
In a way my life is full of burdens  
But in a way you carry them from me  
Jesus  
'Cause no one understands the way you do  
And you know, Lord  
I don't want to fall away from you  
  
Well, every day I pray to start anew  
'Cause I don't want to fall away from you  
  
No, Lord  
I don't want to fall away from you  
No, Lord  
I don't want to fall away from you  
  
From you, Lord
