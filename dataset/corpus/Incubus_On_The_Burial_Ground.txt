Die by violence in this world  
Is nothing strange for us  
With all those chemicals, wars and destructions  
We do not know what mother nature has in store for us  
The race for economy  
Makes people forget  
The lives around this planet  
As men become more egoistic  
Pretty soon, there will be nothing in this world  
For men to spare  
Stupidity  
Causing pain  
And sickness  
To our world  
Suffer  
Chorus  
On the burial ground  
Is what this planet is all about  
It's where we are right now  
We might not have any future to be found  
On this burial ground  
We have nowhere to hide  
Death is laughing at our crimes  
And now we are feeling the effects  
That the forces of nature has brought  
The droughts, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions  
It's getting worse than ever before  
We can see the revenge of this planet upon us  
As we keep hurting the sea, the soil and the air  
Sometimes some catastrophic accidents happen  
Causing death rate and we wonder from where  
People are dying in civilizations of different lands  
Because of drought  
Occurrences of flooding everywhere  
Killing innocent people and leaving others in despair  
Abomination because people fear that all these events  
Happen without any warning killing unexpectedly  
Men subjugate the forces of nature  
But we don't know that it's destroying us slowly  
The animals are becoming extinct  
Seas and rivers polluted by toxic waste  
Combustible smoke  
Factories are creating acid rains  
That is burning our skins, damaging plantations  
And soon it will us to death  
Air pollution is disintegrating our atmosphere  
Allowing the ultra-violet rays to burn the earth  
Ad to provoke us fear  
Chorus  
On the burial ground  
Is what this planet is all about  
It's where we are right now  
We might not have any future to be found  
On this burial ground  
We have nowhere to hide  
Death is laughing at our cries  
Soon some of the lives on this planet  
Won't exist anymore  
Because we won't be able to recreate  
Some of the beauty that we had before  
Nobody seems to care  
About the future of our children's civilizations  
We better act now  
So they won't have a life of torment and frustration  
Stupidity  
Causing pain  
Punishment for violating  
The ecologic balance  
Chorus  
On the burial ground  
Is what this planet is all about  
It's where we are right now  
We might not have any future to be found  
On this burial ground  
We have nowhere to hide  
Death is laughing at our face  
Cursed by men this world has become  
We are building our own tombs  
By eliminating our source of life  
When blindly we continue the destructions  
There's no future  
Day by day we are reaching the end of our lives
