Just touched down in town again  
You think about me now and then  
Been missing my lover friend  
Let's say we have a second round again  
  
Girl it's been a while  
So I thought I'd hit you up  
You never left my mind  
Let's pick it up where we left off  
The last time I loved you fiercely baby  
So let me feel you up  
Yeah it's been a minute  
I know you miss the way we touch  
You can think about you don't want it  
You don't wanna come across too anxious  
Come see if you're ready for a second round  
  
Girl I'm in your town, come over  
Girl don't let me down, I won't be here for long  
I'll show you a good time, one that we'll both remember  
Girl give me your best respect unless girl  
  
Said you wouldn't but you did it, oh girl  
I can tell you don't regret it 'cause you ain't been touched like this  
Since the last time  
  
The feeling that I get every time we connect, oh there it is  
Who else cares, let 'em out, but I'll be back around  
Baby you can hang around if you want to  
But I gotta be out, have some V-I  
When I get back, be ready for a second round  
  
Girl I'm in your town, come over  
Girl don't let me down, I won't be here for long  
I'll show you a good time, one that we'll both remember  
Girl give me your best respect unless girl
