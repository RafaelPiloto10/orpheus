(Fats Domino)  
Blue Monday how I hate Blue Monday  
Got to work like a slave all day  
Here come Tuesday, oh hard Tuesday  
I'm so tired got no time to play  
Here come Wednesday, I'm beat to my socks  
My gal calls, got to tell her that I'm out  
'Cause Thursday is a hard workin' day  
And Friday I get my pay  
Saturday mornin', oh Saturday mornin'  
All my tiredness has gone away  
Got my money and my honey  
And I'm out on the stand to play  
Sunday mornin' I'm feelin' bad  
But it's worth it for the time that I had  
But I've got to get my rest  
'Cause Monday is a mess
