I got a feelin' called the blues, oh Lord, since my baby said goodbye  
Lord I don't know what I'll do, all I do is sit and sigh "Oh Lord"  
That last long day she said goodbye, well Lord I thought I would cry  
She'll do me, she'll do you, she's got that kinda lovin'  
Lord I love to hear her when she calls me sweet daddy  
Such a beautiful dream, I hate to think it's all over  
I've lost my heart it seems, I've grown so used to you somehow  
Well I'm nobody's sugar daddy now  
And I'm lonesome, I got the love sick blues  
  
Well I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal  
That's what's the matter with me  
I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal  
But she don't care about me  
Lord I've tried and I've tried to keep her satisfied  
But she just wouldn't stay  
So now that she is leavin', this is all I can say  
  
I've got a feelin' called the blues, oh Lord, since my baby said goodbye  
Lord I don't know what I'll do, all I do is sit and sigh, "Oh Lord"  
That last long day she said goodbye, well Lord I thought I would cry  
She'll do me, she'll do you, she's got that kinda lovin'  
Lord I love to hear her when she calls me sweet daddy  
Such a beautiful dream, I hate to think it all over  
I've lost my heart, it seems, I've grown so used to you somehow  
Well I'm nobody's sugar daddy now  
And I'm lonesome, I got the love sick blues
