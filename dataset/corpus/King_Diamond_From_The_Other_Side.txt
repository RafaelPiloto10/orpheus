I don't know if I'm dead or alive  
All I know is I'm running out of time  
Oh, I'm leaving my body... Oh, leaving it behind  
  
From the other side, looking down I know that it's me  
From the other side, looking fown it's the devil I see  
  
Someone down there is saving my life  
I see a tear being shed by THE EYE  
Oh, I'm drifting much higher... Oh, into the light  
  
From the other side, looking down I know that it's me  
From the other side, looking fown it's the devil I see  
  
I see the strangest faces  
Faces that I've never seen before  
They see me through empty spaces  
Spaces that do not exist no more  
  
I swear by the moon and the devil  
I'll be their guardian if they will be mine  
  
There's a demon with red glowing eyes  
He's invading the body that was mine  
Oh, is there still time... Oh, Time to return  
  
From the other side, looking down I know that it's me  
From the other side, looking fown it's the devil I see  
  
I guess I wasn't ready yet  
'Cause someone there is calling me back from the dead  
  
Demon, demon, are you there  
Demon, demon, leave my lair  
  
From the other side, looking down I know that it's me  
From the other side, looking fown it's the devil I see  
WAKE UP!
