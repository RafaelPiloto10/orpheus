You know, of all the things in the world I'd miss  
It would probably be music and love  
They say you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone  
That's so true  
Even though we still take it for granted  
And I used to be like that, but not anymore  
'Cause I found out what love really means  
Love means happiness and dedication  
Love will sometimes bring complications  
But you must have faith and a whole lot of trust  
Most of all you can never give up just  
  
(Hold on, hold on)  
Hold on to your good thing, yeah  
(Hold on, hold on) forget about the small things  
(Hold on, hold on) do it for love, do it for love  
  
And remember that love is a feeling  
But it's also an action, yes  
You've got to give sometime  
If you want to get back some, well  
And when all the king's horses  
And even all the king's men  
Can't put it together again  
That is exactly when you've got to  
  
(Hold on, hold on) hold on to what you've got  
(Hold on, hold on)  
It's the little things that mean a lot  
(Hold on, hold on) do it for love, do it for love  
In spite of everything, no matter what  
You've got to H-O-L-D on (you gotta hold on)  
Hold on, hmm, hmm, hmm, ooh, oh, oh  
  
You're so hard headed  
'Cause you feel that you're right  
Well, tell me how you gonna feel  
In the middle of the night  
All alone, all alone  
I know, I know  
It doesn't matter who's right or wrong  
If you feel so inclined  
To blame that shame on someone else  
Ooh, stop and think about it  
Point the finger at yourself  
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo  
  
Hold on to your good thing (hold on)  
Forget about the small (hold on) things  
(Hold on) And hold on  
Hold on, oh hold on (hold on)  
Real tight in spite of everything  
Hold on (hold on)  
When you feel like walking out that door.
