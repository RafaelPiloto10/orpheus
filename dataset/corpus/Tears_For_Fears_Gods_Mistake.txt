Have a friend, calls me up  
Says hello, then hangs up  
He must have read my mind  
These are the days of a different paradigm  
Maybe once, even twice  
He said "God does not play dice"  
Yet if he's everywhere  
He's in casinos with aces to spare  
  
Oh, Love is God's mistake  
Oh, Love is God's mistake  
  
Ours is not to reason why  
As we fall from way up high  
Into the water  
Like a lamb to the slaughter  
Even now, God's mistake  
Sets us up for one more heartbreak  
God you look mighty fine  
Dressed as the devil in a cosmic pantomime  
  
Oh, Love is God's mistake  
Oh, Love is God's mistake  
Never was so much at stake  
Oh, Love is God's mistake
