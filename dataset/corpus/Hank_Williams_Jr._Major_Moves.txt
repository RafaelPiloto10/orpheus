I took a job in the city  
And I left my country home  
I learned to survive and I got street-wise  
But I couldn't tell for how long  
  
Then I met you where they sing the blues  
Downtown a few months ago  
And you taught me it's still good to believe in love  
And I love you so  
  
I'm makin' some major moves  
Oh, city girl, to get to you  
I'm makin' some major moves  
Oh, darlin', major moves just for you  
  
I sold some things and I bought a ring  
And I've been married before one time  
And this major move just goes to prove  
Like they say love is really blind  
  
Yes, I've made a change  
And there ain't no one to blame  
But me if things don't work out right  
  
And they just might work out  
'Cause all I think about  
Is that city girl and country boy tonight  
  
I'm makin' some major moves  
Oh, city girl, just for you  
I'm makin' some major moves  
Oh, darlin, major moves to get to you  
  
I'm makin' some major moves  
Oh, darlin', just to get with you  
I'm makin' some major moves  
Oh, baby, major moves to get to you  
Major moves all for you
