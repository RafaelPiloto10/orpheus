Well, this is such a sad affair  
I've opened up my heart so many times  
But now it's closed  
Oh my dear  
Every salted tear  
It wrings  
Bitter-sweet applause  
But when the show's in full swing  
Every once in awhile  
High stepping chorus lines  
Mean I'm forgetting  
Mein lullaby - liebchen  
How rich in contrast  
Love can be  
Sometimes I'm quite amused  
To see it twist and turn  
To taste both sweet and dry  
These vintage years  
Lovers you consume, my friend  
As others their wine  
Nein - das ist nicht  
Das ende der welt  
Gestrandet an leben und kunst  
Und das spiel geht weiter  
Wie man weiss  
Noch viele schoum.... Weidershen  
And now, as you turn to leave  
You try to force a smile  
As if to compensate  
Then you break down and cry
