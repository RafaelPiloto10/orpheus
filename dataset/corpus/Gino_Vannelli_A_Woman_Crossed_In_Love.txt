Can't stand this silence any more I'm dying  
The words no sooner leave my lips  
I'm out of your life in the beat of a heart  
It was selfish it was cruel undeniably uncool  
Have your way with me  
Slap me twice across the face once for a stolen embrace  
Once more for honesty  
  
They say the truth will set you free  
It's true for some but not for me  
No sorry on earth is sorry enough  
To win back the heart of a woman crossed in love  
  
Call me shameless I don't care I love you  
Desperate measures for desperate times  
So much for the sway of a kiss  
Darling here I am your ever-loving man  
In his darkest hour  
Had I known it meant goodbye I would have sooner lived a lie  
Than live without you girl  
  
They say the truth will set you free  
It's true for some but not for me  
No sorry on earth is sorry enough  
To win back the heart of a woman crossed in love  
  
So it's over like that pack you bags your coat and hat  
End of story  
Before I fade away hear me when I say  
Baby I'm sorry  
  
They say the truth will set you free  
It's true for some but not for me  
No sorry on earth is sorry enough  
To win back the heart of a woman crossed in love  
  
No sorry on earth is sorry enough  
To win back the heart of a woman crossed in love
