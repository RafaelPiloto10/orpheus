The story is told of the power of gold  
And its lure on the unsuspecting  
It glitters and shines, it badgers and blinds  
And constantly needs protecting  
  
Balance the cost of the soul you lost  
With the dreams you lightly sold  
Are you under the power of gold?  
  
The letters and calls got you climbing the walls  
And everyone wants a favor  
They beg to remind you of times left behind you  
But you know the past is a loser  
  
The face you're wearing is different now  
And the days run hot and cold  
Are you under the power of gold?  
The power of gold  
  
You're a creature of habit, run like a rabbit  
Scared of a fear you can't name  
You own paranoia is looming before you  
But nobody thinks that it's a game  
  
Balance the cost of the soul you lost  
With the dreams you lightly sold  
Then tell me that you're free of the power of gold  
The power of gold  
  
The women are lovely, the wine is superb  
But there's something about the song that disturbs you
