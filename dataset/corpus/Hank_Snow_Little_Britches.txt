I don't know much on religion and I ain't never had no show  
But I got a middlin' tight grip sir on the handful of things that I know  
I don't pan out on the prophets good will and that sort of thing  
But I believe in God and the angels ever since one night last spring.  
  
I come into town with some turnips and my little Gabe came along  
No four year old in this country could beat him for purty and strong  
Pert and chipper and sassy and always ready to swear and fight  
And I learned him to chaw tobaccy just to keep his teeth milk white.  
  
The snow came down like a blanket as I passed by Taget's store  
I went in for a jug of molasses and I left the team at the door  
But they scared at somethin' and started and I heard one little squeal  
And lickety split over the prairie went team Little Britches and all.  
  
Yes lickety split over the prairie I was almost froze with skeer  
But we rousted up some torches and we searched from far and near  
At last we struck hosses and wagon snowed under a soft white mound  
Upsot dead beat but of little Gabe no hide nor hair could be found.  
  
And here all hope soured on me of findin' my little Gabe  
So I just flopped down on my marrow bones  
And crotched deep in the snow and prayed  
By this time the torches was played out and me and Israel Par  
Went off with some wood to a sheep fold that he said was somewhere thar.  
  
We found it at last in a little she'd where they shut up the lambs at night  
We looked in and seen them huddled there so warm and sleepy and white  
And there sot Little Britches and chirped as pert as ever you see  
I wants a chaw of tobaccy and that's what's the matter of me.  
  
How did he get there angels he could never have walked in that storm  
They just scooped down and toted him to where it was safe and warm  
And I think that savin a little child and fodging him to his own  
Is a dern sight better business than loafin' around the throne...
