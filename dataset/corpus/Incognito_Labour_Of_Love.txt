I'm a man, I know that you've been hurt by one and more  
Understand, you have never known a love like this  
A love like this before  
A love like this before  
  
Promises, I know that they come knockin' at your door  
But it's me who stays, true to every word and more than this  
I can give you more  
I can give you more  
  
[Chorus]  
You're living on the run, tell me baby, when will it all stop  
I'm waiting for the chance I wanna give you, everything I got  
Slow down take it easy, all you've got to do is reach out for me  
We can work and make it  
A labor of love  
  
I'm a man, I know that you've been hurt by one and more  
Understand, you have never known a love like this  
A love like this before  
A love like this before  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Reach our for me)  
A labor of love  
(Reach our for me)  
A labor of love  
(Reach our for me)  
A labor of love  
(Reach our for me)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Stop think it over, where I'm coming from  
I'm not here to fool anybody, please don't get me wrong  
Slow down take it easy, all you've got to do is reach out for me  
We can work and make it  
A labor of love
