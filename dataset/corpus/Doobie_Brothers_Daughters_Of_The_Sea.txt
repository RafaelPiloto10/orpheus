Autumn breeze blowin' to the east  
Shift of breeze upon a sea of peace  
Hear them call, can't you hear them sing  
Hear them call, how their voices ring  
Dizzy dancin', golden ladies  
Misty eyes that cannot fool  
Silver shoreline waves come crashin'  
To the end of all of you  
Like a spider weavin' silken nets  
Fingers move, swaying silhouettes  
Hear them call, can't you hear them sing  
Hear them call, how their voices ring  
Spinning, turning, moonlit madness  
'Round the fire burnin' bright  
I can see it risin' higher  
Lightin' up the starry night  
  
Hear them call, can't you hear them sing  
Hear them call, how their voices ring  
Hear them call, can't you hear them sing  
Hear them call, how their voices ring
