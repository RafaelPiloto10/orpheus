In the morning when I saw the light  
On the letter you left in the night  
After you had gone without saying goodbye  
Here to tell you that I'm not afraid to cry  
  
Oh, no oh, no  
Tried to find you but I lost my way  
Tried to tell you what I couldn't say  
After you had gone without telling me why  
  
I'm just here to tell you  
That I'm not afraid to cry, oh no  
And I'm not afraid to cry, oh no  
  
[Chorus]  
Not afraid to cry  
And I'm not afraid to say  
Doesn't seem the same  
When you're not around  
  
Now I'm here to tell you  
That I'm going out today  
Gonna pick-a-myself back up  
Get my feet on the ground  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm not afraid--repeat
