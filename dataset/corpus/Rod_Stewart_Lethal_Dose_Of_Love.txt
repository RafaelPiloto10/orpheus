Wild thing!  
  
Should've known better  
With a girl like you  
You satisfied my every need  
What a little heartbreaker  
You turned out to be  
Prettiest face I've ever seen  
Oh dance little sister, you turn me on  
You make my blood run hot  
Killer legs in that short black dress  
Baby, you was born to rock  
  
I don't mind you foolin' me around  
Just don't let me out of your jail  
I don't mind you messin' me up  
I tell all my friends  
It's a lethal dose of love  
  
Lethal dose of love, watch out  
Lethal dose of love  
Lethal dose of love  
Lethal dose of love  
  
Should 've know better  
With a girl like you  
You're totally misunderstood  
I hear them talkin'  
In this one horse town  
You scandalize the neighborhood  
My family was shocked by your  
The color of your lips and hair  
Even my brother, he's a God fearin' man  
Poor boy had to sit and stare  
  
I don't mind you foolin' me around  
Just don't let me out of your jail  
I don't mind you messin' me up  
I tell all my friends  
It's a lethal dose of love  
  
Lethal dose of love  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Lethal dose of love  
Lethal dose of love  
  
I hear the clickin'  
Of your heels on the stairs  
You don't talk and I don't ask  
What a little difference  
Some eyeliner makes  
Tomorrow you'll be back in class  
Although my blueprint for happiness  
Depends on you  
I'll cook and clean and be your slave  
I'll tie you up but I won't tie you down  
Baby, I might even shave  
  
I don't mind you foolin' me around  
Just don't let me out of your jail  
I don't mind you messin' me up  
I tell all my friends  
It's a lethal dose of love  
  
Lethal dose of love
