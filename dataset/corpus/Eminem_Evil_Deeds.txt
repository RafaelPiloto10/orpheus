Lord please forgive for what I do  
For I know not what I've done.  
  
Father please forgive me for I know not what I do,  
I just never had the chance to ever meet You,  
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be,  
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds  
  
Mama had a baby and its head popped off  
(head popped off)  
(head popped off)  
(head popped off)  
(head popped off)  
(head popped off)  
But mama don't want me the next thing I know I'm gettin' dropped off  
(getting dropped off)  
(getting dropped off)  
(getting dropped off)  
(getting dropped off)  
Ring, ring, ring on the doorbell of the next door neighbors on their front
porch  
(Their front porch)  
(Their front porch)  
(Their front porch)  
(Their front porch)  
But they didn't want me neither so they left me on someone else's lawn  
(Else's lawn)  
(Else's lawn)  
(Else's lawn)  
Til' someone finally took me in my great aunt and uncle Edna and Charles  
(Edna and Charles)  
(Edna and Charles)  
(Edna and Charles)  
They were the ones who were left in charge  
My elementary they'd gang up on me and sing this song  
(Sing this song)  
(Sing this song)  
(Sing this song)  
It went a little something like  
Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb,  
Debbie had a Satan spawn Satan spawn  
Mama why do they keep saying this I just don't understand understand  
And by the way where's my dad?!  
  
[Chorus]  
Father please forgive me for I know not what I do  
I just never had the chance to ever meet you  
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be  
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds  
  
Predominately, predominately, everything's always predominately  
Predominately-white, predominately-black, well what about me?  
Where does that leave me?  
Well I guess that I'm between predominately both of em'  
I think if I hear that fuckin' word again I'm a scream  
While I'm projectile vomiting.  
What do I look like a Comedian to you?  
Do you think that I?m kidding?  
What do I look like some kinda idiot?  
Wait a minute shit, don?t answer that  
Why am I so misunderstood?  
Why do I go through so much bullshit  
It's such Bullshit it's tush mull bish  
Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again  
Whining about his millions  
And his mansion and his sorrow he's always drowning in  
And the dad that he never had,  
And how his childhood was so bad  
And how his mom was a dope addict  
And his ex-wife how they go at it man  
I'd hate to have it as bad as that Mr. Mathers  
Claims he had it, I can't imagine it  
That little rich poor white bastard  
Needs to take some of that cash out of the bank  
And take a bath in it  
Man if I only had half of it,  
Shit if you only knew the half of it?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds  
Please release me from these demons I never  
Had any of this shit planned Mom please believe  
I don't wanna be Satans spawn, never got the chance to say I'm sorry  
Now look at all the pain I caused  
Dear Santa-Clause why are you not coming this year again  
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this?  
Everything could have been So perfect but life ain't a fairy tale.  
I'm about to be hoisted up in the air  
Forty feet below me there's people everywhere  
I don't even know but who feel like they know me 'cause I'm in this Ferris
wheel  
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hallie on the carousel  
Without this crowd everywhere I go but life is like a merry-go-round  
Here we go now do-si-do now curtains up the show must go on now  
Ring-around-the-rosie the show's over you can all go home now  
But the curtain just don't close for me  
This ain't how fame was supposed to be  
Where's the switch I can just turn off-and-on this ain't what I chose to be  
So please God give me the strength  
To have what it takes to carry on  
'Til I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Ooh!  
Last one baby  
Lets Go  
Detroit!
