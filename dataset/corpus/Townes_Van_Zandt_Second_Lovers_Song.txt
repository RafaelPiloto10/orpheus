You're wakin' next to me  
Tears splash across the sun  
You whisper soft to me  
That I ain't the only one  
To breathe your yellow hair  
Caress your bosom fair  
Do you think I really care?  
Do you think it matters?  
  
What do your feelin's mean?  
Do you think I'd love more  
If you stood pure and clean  
Of those you'd known before  
Would your words be sweeter then  
Upon November's wind  
If you began again  
Could your smile be softer?  
Would your eyes more brightly shine?  
Would your laughter be so tender  
If you'd been only mine  
For as long as you remember?  
  
I don't want tears from you  
Don't build your love on shame  
All what we've done is through  
And all we can do remains  
My lady can't you see  
I love not jealously  
But for all you are to me  
And all you'll be tomorrow
