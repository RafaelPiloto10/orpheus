I said one day I'd find the game  
Well now you know I'm not insane  
You tried to take me for a ride  
Now all you feel is suicide  
We're two of a kind  
Take what you can find  
But don't blow your mind away  
You led me to another life  
Of work and pain and sacrifice  
I broke away from you somehow  
And look who's goin' through it now  
We're two of a kind  
Take what you can find  
But don't blow your mind away  
So now you know the reason why  
I'm laughing here and why you cry  
'cause you don't mean a thing no more  
And I'm just like I was before
