God is love  
Through all your trials and tribulations  
God is love  
He'll get you through all situations  
  
God is love  
And if you are ready He always is ready for you  
  
God loves everyone  
That's why He gave His son oh yeah  
And you should feel His pain  
Yet He gave us everything  
  
God is love  
He'll get you through your pain and sorrow  
God is love  
He's coming back maybe tomorrow  
  
God is love  
And if you are ready He's gonna be ready for you  
  
God loves everyone  
That's why He gave His Son, oh yeah  
And you should feel His pain  
Yet He gave us everything  
  
And though much time has passed  
His words and promises always last  
And I am here to say  
That He loves each one of us in every way  
  
God is love  
He makes the rain that makes the flowers  
God is love  
And so amazing are His powers  
God is love  
And if you are ready He's gonna be ready for you  
  
God loves everyone  
That's why He gave His son, oh yeah  
And you should feel His pain  
Yet He gave us everything [Repeat: x 3]
