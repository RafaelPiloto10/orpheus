You try to find a reason why it all went away  
And you think of what you could have done different  
When you thought you were complete  
You opened up your eyes  
  
When you thought you had it all that's when you lost it  
If you want to hold onto everything you will fall  
  
You are around chasing things that disappear  
You can't get enough cauze you want it all  
When you thought you were okay  
You opened up your eyes  
  
When you thought you had it all that's when you lost it  
If you want to hold onto everything you will fall  
  
When you thought you had it all that's when you lost it  
If you want to hold onto everything you will fall  
  
When you thought you had it all that's when you lost it  
If you want to hold onto everything you will fall
