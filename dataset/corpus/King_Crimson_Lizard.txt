A:Prince Rupert Awakes  
Farewell the temple master's bells  
His kiosk and his black worm seed  
Courtship solely of his word  
With Eden guaranteed.  
For now Prince Rupert's tears of glass  
Make saffron sabbath eyelids bleed  
Scar the sacred tablet of wax  
On which the Lizards feed.  
Wake your reason's hollow vote  
Wear your blizzard season coat  
Burn a bridge and burn a boat  
Stake a Lizard by the throat.  
Go Polonius or kneel  
The reapers name their harvest dawn  
All your tarnished devil's spoons  
Will rust beneath our corn.  
Now bears Prince Rupert's garden roam  
Across his rain tree shaded lawn  
Lizard bones become the clay-  
And there a Swan is born  
Wake your reasons' hollow vote  
Wear your blizzard season coat  
Burn a bridge and burn a boat  
Stake a Lizard by the throat.  
Gone soon Piepowder's moss-weed court  
Round which upholstered Lizards sold  
Visions to their leaden flock  
Of rainbows' ends and gold.  
Now tales Prince Rupert's peacock brings  
Of walls and trumpets thousand fold  
Prophets chained for burning masks  
And reels of dreams unrolled . . .
