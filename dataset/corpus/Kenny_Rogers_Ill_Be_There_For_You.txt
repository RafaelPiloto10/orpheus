I'll be there for you  
You don't have to feel alone  
Like a shadow by your side  
I'll be with you right or wrong  
  
You stumble and you fall  
But you can always lean on me  
I'll be there to see you through  
I'll be there for you  
  
I'll be there for you  
When your dreams seem far away  
Even in the darkest night  
You can face the world unafraid  
  
And if you close your eyes  
You will feel me next to you  
No matter what you're going through  
I'll be there for you  
  
Here today, here tomorrow  
Through the joy, laughter and sorrow  
You're in my heart, we're kindred souls  
If you could read my mind  
You'd know...  
  
I'll be there for you  
The one who comes to your rescue  
I'm the one you'll never leave  
I'll be there for you  
No matter what...
