A little bird told me that you love me  
And I believe that you do  
This little bird told me I was fallin'  
Fallin' for no one but you.  
  
There's no use denying  
I might as well confess  
Of all the girls I know, dear  
I'm sure I love you best.  
  
The little bird told me we'd be happy  
And I believe that it's true  
This little bird told me we'd be married  
Yea, Yea, And I believe that it's true.  
  
We'll have a pretty cottage  
Not too far  
All fenced in like a movie stars  
We'll call him Ace  
Lying there by the fireplace  
A goldfish pond and a wishing well  
Everything is gonna turn out swell.  
  
A little bird told me we'd be happy  
Yea, yea, And I believe that it's true  
For I believe that it's true  
Don't you know that I believe that it's true  
Well baby, I believe that it's true...
