They're singing 'deck the halls'  
But it's not like christmas at all  
I remember when you were here  
And all the fun that we had last year  
  
The snow's coming down  
Now I'm watching it fall  
All the people around  
Baby please come home  
  
The church bells in town  
All ringing in song  
Full of happy sounds  
Baby please come home  
  
They're singing 'deck the halls'  
But it's not like christmas at all  
I remember when you were here  
And all the fun that we had last year  
  
Now the snow's coming down  
Now I'm watching it fall  
Lot's of people around  
Baby please come home  
(won't you please, oh)  
  
They're singing 'deck the halls'  
But it's not like christmas at all  
I remember when you were here  
And all the fun that we had last year  
  
The snow's coming down  
Now I'm watching it fall  
All the people around  
Baby, baby, baby please come home  
  
Baby please come home  
Baby please come home  
Baby please come home  
Now I'm feeling all alone  
  
Oh the snow's coming down  
Now I'm watching it fall...
