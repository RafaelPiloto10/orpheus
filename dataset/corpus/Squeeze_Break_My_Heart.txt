I hit the bottle  
I hit the high  
Blue is my colour  
Dark is my night  
Now she has left me  
I'm doing time  
In this prison of a heart  
Where I've fallen apart and cried  
On to the table  
Where she threw her ring  
Slamming her goodbyes  
She took everything  
Now that the jack has  
Beaten the king  
In this opera of old soap  
There has got to be some new hope  
That I'll win  
  
Break my heart  
Snap my feelings  
Break my heart  
Walk out and see  
There are more fish in the ocean  
But somehow they're not for me  
  
Caught with another  
And reasons there are  
She needs attention  
When I'm at the bar  
Now there's another  
That's safe in her arms  
And if that's not understood  
Then I guess that you should  
Break my heart
