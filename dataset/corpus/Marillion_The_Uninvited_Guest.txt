You may not recall the moment that you asked me  
But your invitation was clear  
You'll pretend you've never met me but it's far to late  
Now I'm here  
  
Cause I'm the one who knows what scares you  
I'm the one who loves you best  
I'm the thirteenth at the table  
I'm the uninvited guest  
I'm the Banquo at your banquet  
I'm the cuckoo in your nest  
I'm your fifteen-stone first-footer  
I'm the uninvited guest  
  
I was there when you said insincere "I love you's"  
To a woman who wasn't your wife  
And I fronted you the money  
That you ran away and blew  
On the biggest regret of your life  
  
Cause I'm the one who knows what scares you  
I'm the who loves you best  
I'm the thirteenth at the table  
I'm the uninvited guest  
I'm the Banquo at your banquet  
I'm the cuckoo in your nest  
I'm your New Year's resolution  
I'm the uninvited guest  
  
I'm the face you hoped you'd never see  
But always knew you would  
I'm the one thing you knew you shouldn't do  
But did because you could  
  
I'm the evil in your bloodstream  
I'm the rash upon your skin  
And you made a big mistake all right  
The day you let me in  
And you can fly to the other side of the world  
You know you'll only find  
I've reserved the seat behind you  
We can talk about old times  
  
Cause I'm the one who knows what scares you  
I'm the who loves you best  
I'm the thirteenth at the table  
I'm the uninvited guest  
I'm the Banquo at your banquet  
I'm the cuckoo in your nest  
I'm your fifteen-stone first-footer  
I'm the uninvited guest  
Let me in!  
I'm your New Year's resolution  
I'm the uninvited guest
