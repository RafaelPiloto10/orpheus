We give, we take, we bend until we break  
We touch and feel, to hurt or heal  
And in the end  
  
We run so far from who we really are  
And we starve and thirst, we praise and curse  
And I don't care  
  
How near or far, I'll find you, wherever you are  
You know I'll find you, wherever you go  
  
We shout and scream, but it's just a silly dream  
And we hold it inside like its live or die  
Till in the end we learn to wait  
And we squeeze the hands of fate  
And we twist and turn  
We freeze and burn, but I don't care  
  
How near or far, I'll find you, wherever you are  
You know I'll find you, wherever you go  
Through the time and space  
I'll always see your face  
And if I must count every star  
  
How near or far, I'll find you, wherever you are  
You know I'll find you, wherever you go
