Politician drivin' down the road  
Flashin' that smile that got him the vote.  
Here's another country girl,  
He's teachin' her about the world in his room  
On the 45th floor - get 'em all while they're young.  
Campaign money comes rollin' in  
Ain't nobody askin' where it's been,  
Talk about a smokin' gun.  
What'd we pay to get his son out of jail?  
Don't inhale  
On the 45th floor.  
We all know what's been happenin',  
Ain't no slappin' him down.  
We're supposedly invited to the party,  
But the elevator's never gonna stop  
On the 45th floor.  
Doesn't matter if it's day or night  
'Cause we're all gonna pay the price.  
And the party rolls on.  
Used to be a rumour goin' round,  
The people tried to run my man outta town.  
We thought we'd see him ride the rails.  
No one's ever gonna nail him down  
All because of the 45th floor.  
We all know what's been happenin',  
Ain't no slappin' him down.  
We're supposedly invited to the party,  
But the elevator's never gonna stop  
On the 45th floor.  
Oesn't matter if it's day or night  
'Cause we're all gonna pay the price.  
And the party rolls on.  
None of these fools ever thinks about the pain they cause.  
It's all about an image to uphold.  
How could anybody be so bold?  
Takin' all the candy from the hands of a child.  
We all know what's been happenin',  
Ain't no slappin' him down.  
We're supposedly invited to the party,  
But the elevator's never gonna stop  
On the 45th floor.  
Doesn't matter if it's day or night  
'Cause we're all gonna pay the price.  
And the party rolls on.  
Doesn't matter if it's day or night  
'Cause we're all gonna pay the price.  
And the party rolls on.
