Well the boll weevil and the little black bug  
Come from a-mexico they say  
Came all the way to texas  
Just a-lookin' for a place to stay  
Just a-lookin' for a home, just a-lookin' for a home  
(Doo-doo-wop-wop)  
Well the first time that I seen the boll weevil  
He was a-sittin' on the square  
Well the next time that I seen him  
He had his a-family there  
Just a-lookin' for a home, just a-lookin' for a home  
(Doo-doo-wop-wop)  
Well the farmer took the boll weevil  
And he put him on the red hot sand  
Well the weevil said this is a-mighty hot  
But I take it like a man  
This will be my home, this will be my home  
  
Well the f armer took the boll weevil  
And he put him on a keg of ice  
Well the weevil said to the farmer  
This is mighty cool and nice  
This will be my home, this will be my home  
(Doo-doo-wop-wop)  
Well if anybody should ask you  
Who it was who sang this song  
Say a guitar picker from a-oklahoma city  
With a pair of blue jeans on  
Just a-lookin' for a home, just a-lookin' for a home  
(Doo-doo-wop-wop)
