Here in the dark, the shadows, they haunt me  
Here in the shade, oh, the bright lights, they blind me  
Yesterday is gone, time for moving on  
Here's a brand new start, gonna base it on my heart  
It's another day, I've got to find a better way  
Won't you help me?  
Failing that  
If you have to go  
It's all up to me, I know  
I just wanna change my world but from the inside  
I just wanna live my life  
And make this place, make this time  
For all our lives to be respected  
Here in the cold light of day, this vision  
Paints a different world, a world of the heart  
And I want to live there  
I've been on the run from all the people I've become  
I want to shed this skin and start it all again  
I want to draw a line in the sand for one last time  
Will you help me?  
Failing that  
If you have to go  
It's all up to me, I know  
I just wanna change my world but from the inside  
I just wanna live my life  
With some hope and to do what's right  
I just wanna change this world  
And make this place, make this time  
For all our lives to be respected  
I just wanna change my world  
(Change my world, ooh)  
I just wanna live my life and to do what's right  
(I just wanna live my life and to do what's right)  
I just wanna change this world  
(I just wanna change this world from the inside)  
I just wanna live my life  
(Just wanna live my life)
