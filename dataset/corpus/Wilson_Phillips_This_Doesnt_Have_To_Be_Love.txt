Softly, love is standing here with its demands  
(Tell me what you want from me, you want from me)  
Slowly, I think I'm letting go of all my plans  
(Tell me where we're goin' to, we're goin' to)  
  
Why, why am I afraid to give into this  
Why am I afraid?  
  
[Chorus]  
This doesn't have to be love  
But it's all I can feel, it's all that I fear.  
This doesn't have to be anything at all,  
So hard to fall (from this high above)  
But do we have to call it love?  
  
I hold back, from everything I really want to say  
(Should I let my guards down, my guards down, my guards down)  
I don't, I don't make commitments that could break  
(Maybe it's just too late, it's just too late)  
  
I, I'm so afraid to give into this  
I'm so afraid, Oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Need a little time to think things through, Baby  
Do I really want to give myself, give all myself to you, now?  
I can't believe it's happening so fast  
'Cause I don't want to bring back what I left in the past, No.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So hard to fall... in love  
This doesn't have to be... love  
(Love, love is all I feel... your love is what I fear)  
Love me... love me  
So hard to fall  
So very hard to fall.
