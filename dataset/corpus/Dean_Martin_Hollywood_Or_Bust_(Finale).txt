(Land of stardust land of glamour)  
  
(Hollywood Hollywood)  
  
Land of stardust and land of glamour  
  
Vistavision and cinerama  
  
Everyone considers it a must  
  
To get to Hollywood or bust  
  
  
  
Kids from Kansas to Pennsylvania  
  
Soon develop that movie mania  
  
Driving their jalopies through the dust  
  
And out to Hollywood or bust  
  
  
  
Underneath that moonlight in Malibu  
  
Lovers stroll in the dark  
  
Jeepers creepers ten to one sleepers are winning at Hollywood Park  
  
  
  
Land of burgers and land or weenies  
  
Bathing beauties in their bikinis  
  
Mingle with the lower upper crust  
  
You'll see your favorite dolly out and jolly  
  
Hollywood or bust  
  
  
  
(Sound the trumpets strike the cymbals)  
  
(Boys from Bonwit and girls from Gimbels)  
  
(Shaking off that old Manhattan dust)  
  
(To get to Hollywood or bust)  
  
(Town of tinsel and town of bubbles)  
  
(Drive-in theaters and daily doubles)  
  
(Let me tell you mister it's a must)  
  
(To get to Hollywood or bust)  
  
  
  
Drugstore cowboys Hollywood Indians extras looking for jobs  
  
Waiting for someone to discover them down at the counter of Schwabs  
  
Land of burgers and land of weenies  
  
Bathing beauties in their bikinis  
  
Mingle with the lower upper crust  
  
You'll see your favorite dolly out and jolly  
  
Hollywood  
  
Hollywood  
  
Hollywood or bust
