It's time to face the music  
Tonight I came to use it  
You never know  
Who you're gonna meet in here  
I thought I'd never find it  
The dark and handsome kind  
I used to dream of  
And now you're standing there  
Though you're looking good to me  
It doesn't mean that you can do as you please  
  
Oh baby you're the best thing in my life  
But a one-track mind is what you got  
Oh baby you're the best bet here tonight  
And a one-track mind is worth a lot  
I've got no good reason to believe we'll last for long  
But that's good enough for me till the right man comes along  
  
I've waited for a lover  
The kind who'll stay forever  
You look to me  
Like the sort of man I need  
It's not the best scenario  
But now I've found you I'm letting you go  
  
Oh baby you're the best thing in my life  
But a one-track mind is what you got  
Oh baby you're the best bet here tonight  
And a one-track mind is worth a lot  
For the perfect guy maybe I should be holding on  
And with you I could till the right man  
Till the right man comes along
