Never, I know I'll never, oh ever grow tired of you  
Oh never, I know I'll never, oh ever stop loving you  
And you will never have to cry  
'Cause I will never make you blue  
And there will never be a cloud  
To keep the sun from shining through  
Oh never, I know I'll never, oh ever stop loving you  
And if someone should ever try  
To take me from your love and charms  
They'd only be the one to cry  
'Cause I would never leave your arms  
Oh never, I know I'll never, oh ever stop loving you  
Never...
