Dear, when you smile at me  
I hear a melody  
It haunted me from the start  
Something inside of me  
Started a symphony  
Zing went the strings of my heart  
  
Whoa now the breath of spring  
Whoa i heard a robin sing  
About a nest... apart  
All that you seem to be  
End up in harmony  
Zing went the strings of my heart  
  
I still recall the thrill  
I guess i always will  
I hope we'll never depart  
Dear, with your lips to mine  
A rhapsody divine  
Zing went the strings of my heart  
Zing went the strings of my heart  
Zing zing zing zing
