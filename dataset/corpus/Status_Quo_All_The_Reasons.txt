When I find myself in trouble and I need someone to lean on  
I only have to call and you're right there by my side  
When I can't see all the reasons why you have to be so far away  
I wonder if your love is really here to stay  
And I can't help my feelings and I can't hide my love for you  
And I'll always believe in all the things that you want me to  
  
When you're telling me not to worry ''cause you're being there won't be long  
I only live in hope that you just can't be wrong  
Because I can't help my feelings and I can't hide my love for you  
And I'll always believe in all the things that you want me to  
  
And I can't help my feelings and I can't hide my love for you  
And I'll always believe in all the things that you want me to
