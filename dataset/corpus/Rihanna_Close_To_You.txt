[Verse 1]  
Nothing but a tear, that's all for breakfast  
Watching you pretend you're unaffected  
You're pulling our connections, expecting me to let you go  
But I won't  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
No you don't need my protection  
But I'm in love, can't blame me for checking  
I look in your direction, hoping that the message goes  
  
[Chorus]  
Somewhere close to you  
Close to you  
Like so close if they heard you, you wouldn't find out  
Just say now, I'm coming right now, to be close to you  
  
[Verse 2]  
Said you let it go, you kept it  
Working hard to perfect it  
Now your fear is reckless, and it's out of your control  
Would you let it go?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
No you don't need my protection  
But I'm in love, can't blame me for checking  
I look in your direction, hoping that the message goes  
  
[Chorus]  
Somewhere close to you  
Close to you  
Like so close if they heard you, you wouldn't find out  
If you let me, I'd be there by now  
Close to you
