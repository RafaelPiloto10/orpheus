Cold winds may blow o'er the icy sea  
But I'll take with me  
The warmth of thee  
A taste of honey,  
A taste much sweeter than wine  
He will return...he will return  
He'll come back  
For the honey and me  
I leave behind  
My heart to wear  
And may it e'er remind you of  
A taste of honey  
A taste much sweeter than wine  
He will return...he will return...  
He'll come back for the honey and me.
