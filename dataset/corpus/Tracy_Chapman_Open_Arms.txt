If love is what you want  
Baby here I am  
If tenderness is what you need  
I've got that to give  
If you need some affection  
Baby these are open arms  
Open arms, open arms, open arms, open arms  
  
You come home you've had a hard day  
Every door your tried to open  
Was closing in your face  
I'm right here I'll be right here  
I'll embrace you  
  
I'll be open with my heart  
I'll let you in  
I'll be open with my thoughts  
I'll be your best friend  
If you need some attention  
Baby these are open arms  
Open arms, open arms, open arms, open arms  
  
Every corner you turn  
Trouble come your way  
But when you get home  
I'll try to be there  
And I'll embrace you  
  
These are  
These are  
These are  
Open arms  
  
If time is what you need  
Baby I'll stop clocks  
If you're looking for something  
Maybe I've got what you want  
If there's one thing to remember  
Don't forget that these are open arms  
Open arms, open arms, open arms, open arms  
  
These are  
These are  
These are  
Open arms
