One plush summer you come to me ripe and ready  
And bad through and through  
With that deep mystical soul synergy pumping steady  
Between me and you  
  
Lovin' all the beautiful work we've done cara mia  
And it's barely July  
If we keep on boppin' until Labor Day  
Li'l miz Abbie bye bye  
  
What will it be some soothing herb tea?  
That might be just the thing  
Let's say we spike it with Deludin  
Or else, maybe tonight a hand of solitaire  
  
[Chorus]  
Flame is the game  
The game we call gas lighting Abbie  
It's a luscious invention for three  
One summer by the sea  
  
With the long weekend that's comin' up fast  
Let's get busy  
There's just too much to do  
That black mini looks just like the one she's been missin'  
Feels good on you  
  
There's a few items we need in town, allez-vous girl  
There's no time to waste  
Such as fresh cable and fifteen watt bulbs  
Couple dozen, it's a big old place  
  
Let's keep it light, we'll do a fright night  
With blood and everything  
Some punky laughter from the kitchen  
And then, a nice relaxing hand of solitaire  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You can choose the music  
I'll set up my gear  
Later on we'll chill and watch the fireworks from here  
  
How can you knock this mighty spite lock  
Check out the work itself  
A mix of elegance and function  
That's right, a tweak or two and then she's out of here  
  
[Chorus]
