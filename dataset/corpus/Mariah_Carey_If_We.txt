[Ja Rule]  
Yeah  
  
[Mariah Carey (Ja Rule)]  
I never (who would've thought baby)  
Thought I'd be (missing you baby)  
Without you (I need you baby)  
By me (why me?)  
I never (who would've thought baby)  
Thought I'd be (missing you baby)  
Without you (I need you baby)  
By me (why me?)  
  
[Ja Rule]  
Love what your body does to me  
On me, asking me, off that ecstasy  
Reminiscing how we used to smoke and freak  
Fuck then fall asleep, locking for a week  
Now we barely even talk and walk the block  
Kiss and cuddle up, girl we losing touch  
What's a man to do but go crazy babe?  
I know you mad but you don't really hate me babe  
It's deeper than that, now  
  
[Chorus 1]  
Baby if we got together again  
Sugar I'ma be your very best friend  
I would love you unconditionally  
You're never gonna let me go baby  
  
Promise I will be by your side  
I'll be everything you need to get by  
What I broke you know we finally mend  
Baby if we got together again  
  
[Nate]  
Sometimes I close my eyes and just pretend  
What if I had a chance to do it all again?  
Sometimes for happiness we hesitate  
Just like the game, I need the love, won't wait  
And if I had another best friend  
What if I had someone on whom I could depend?  
Someone who makes me feel like you used to  
Tell me baby, what would you do?  
  
[Chorus 1]  
  
[Chorus 2: Mariah Carey (Ja Rule)]  
Baby if we got together again (who would've thought baby)  
Sugar I'ma be your very best friend (missing you baby)  
I would love you unconditionally (I need you baby)  
You're never gonna let me go baby (why me?)  
  
Promise I will be by your side (who would've thought baby)  
I'll be everything you need to get by (missing you baby)  
What I broke you know we finally mend (I need you baby)  
Baby if we got together again (why me?)  
  
[Ja Rule]  
Why would you want to go through the pain?  
The loving another name  
The truth is nobody can love you like I can  
It's a damn shame  
We can't even get along  
We used to get it on, where'd it all go wrong?  
I admit, the flesh is weak  
But the game is strong  
We go my way, your way baby, we moving on  
It's true, goin' miss you  
Who would've thought I'd be without you?  
  
[Mariah Carey (Ja Rule)]  
I never thought (baby there's nothing to lose)  
Thought I'd be (you know my soul's so cold)  
Without you (and my love is pain)  
By me (spit it one more time)  
I never thought (my baby)  
Thought I'd be (pride and joy)  
Without you (I'ma make you mine)  
By me (no doubt, whoa)  
  
[Chorus 1]  
  
[Chorus 2: Repeats]
