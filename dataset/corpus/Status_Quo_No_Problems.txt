Sitting on a corner watching half the world go by  
Thinking something 'long the lines of whiskey and rye  
Rolling to the left, rolling to my right  
Well, anybody out there wanna help me?  
Looking at a picture of the trouble and strife  
Even got a picture of the Queen  
Getting back to thinking 'bout the secrets of life  
Will I ever find another? No, it's just a dream  
Walking round in circles, oh I must have walked a mile  
Trying to imagine I was putting on my style  
Rolling to the left, rolling to my right  
Can't you see I'm going along the wrong lines?  
Searching for the person with a shoulder to cry on  
Calling out to almost anyone  
Have you got a secondary bed I could lie on  
You'd better watch your step or you'll be first in line  
Baby, baby, baby  
What the hell on earth is wrong with you?  
Baby, baby, baby  
What the hell am I supposed to do?  
Baby, baby, baby  
What the hell on earth is wrong with you?  
Baby, baby, baby  
What the hell am I supposed to do?  
Cutting back to visions taken from the silver screen  
Believing I was someone I had never been  
Rolling to my left, rolling to my right  
Surprised the motion picture is in black and white  
Sitting here alone is how it's gonna be  
Will my lucky star ever shine on me?  
I guess it's not a problem  
That's the way it's meant to be  
Oh, it's never been a problem  
It's never been a problem to me  
Baby, baby, baby  
What the hell on earth is wrong with you?  
Baby, baby, baby  
What the hell am I supposed to do?  
Baby, baby, baby  
What the hell on earth is wrong with you?  
Baby, baby, baby  
What the hell am I supposed to do?  
Woh, oh, oh, baby, baby, baby  
What the hell on earth is wrong with you?  
Baby, baby, baby  
What the hell am I supposed to do?  
Woh, oh, oh, baby, baby, baby
