Let's meet in the city where  
The rivers cross bridges there  
Let's float down into the stream  
Of rich and poor pioneers  
A kid from a western town  
Wants to be seen and go out  
Let's borrow my parent's car  
Let's stay out all night up there  
And Burnside will be our street  
Where the kids and the hookers meet  
Diners and strip club junk  
Bookstores and punk rock clubs  
Water, Building and Sin  
(I'm as green as this blade in the grass that bends)  
Big Oregon city draws you in  
(In the wind that blows on the long weekends)  
A promise fulfilled or not  
(Where I take the bridge to the water fountains)  
Just hang on until the summer, it's hot  
(And to gain the hope that the city brings)  
We'll make our home water-tight  
Work all day, play all night  
And hope we're not washed away  
By deceit or tragedy  
And Joan of Arc rules Northeast  
Where the poor and the hipsters meet  
The grid that divides us all  
The river makes final call  
Out at the edge of town  
Where airfield runs water down  
Coyote crosses the tracks  
And hops on the Light-Rail Max  
Water, Building and Sin  
(I'm as green as this blade in the grass that bends)  
Big Oregon city draws you in  
(In the wind that blows on the long weekends)  
A promise fulfilled or not  
(Where I take the bridge to the water fountains)  
Just hang on until the summer, it's hot  
(And to gain the hope that the city brings)  
And if you wanna be a friend of mine  
Cross the river to the east side  
Find me on the eve of suicide  
Tell me the city is no place to hide  
Take me out into a sunny day  
Through the grotto or the promenade  
You came to me in the nick of time  
Thankful for the things I left behind  
Oh dirty river, come let me in (3X)  
Oh dirty river
