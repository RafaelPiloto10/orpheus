You read the business page  
See how you did today  
You live up on the hill  
You've got a view that kills  
Never wonder why  
  
[Bridge]  
After you've counted everything you saved  
Do you ever hit your knees and pray?  
You know there's gonna be a judgment day  
So what will you say?  
  
[Chorus]  
No matter what you make  
All that you can take  
Is what you give away  
What you give away  
  
There's people on the street  
Ain't got enough to eat  
You just shake your head  
The measure of a man is one who lends a hand  
That's what my father said  
  
After you've counted everything you saved  
Do you ever hit your knees and pray?  
You know there's gonna be a judgment day  
So what will you say?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's what you give away  
  
After you've counted everything you saved  
Do you ever hit your knees and pray?  
You know there's gonna be a judgment day  
So what will you say?  
  
No matter what you make  
All that you can take  
Is what you give away  
  
You know it's not too late  
It's all for Heaven's sake  
What you give away  
What you give away  
What you give away
