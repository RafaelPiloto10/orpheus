Oh! England, my Lionheart  
I'm in your garden, fading fast in your arms  
The soldiers soften, the war is over  
The air raid shelters are blooming clover  
Flapping umbrellas fill the lanes  
My London Bridge in rain again  
  
Oh! England, my Lionheart!  
Peter Pan steals the kids in Kensington Park  
You read me Shakespeare on the rolling Thames  
That old river poet that never, ever ends  
Our thumping hearts hold the ravens in  
And keep the tower from tumbling  
  
Oh! England, my Lionheart  
Oh! England, my Lionheart  
Oh! England, my Lionheart  
I don't want to go  
  
Oh! England, my Lionheart!  
Dropped from my black Spitfire to my funeral barge  
Give me one kiss in apple-blossom  
Give me one wish, and I'd be wassailing  
In the orchard, my English rose  
Or with my shepherd, who'll bring me home  
  
Oh! England, my Lionheart  
Oh! England, my Lionheart  
Oh! England, my Lionheart  
I don't want to go  
Oh! England, my Lionheart  
Oh! England, my Lionheart  
Oh! England, my Lionheart  
I don't want to go
