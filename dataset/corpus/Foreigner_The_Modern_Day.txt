I stand up for my pride  
I don't wanna be just like anyone  
In this world I cannot hide  
I must finish what I have begun  
  
That's the way I play  
In the modern day  
'Cause I wanna stay  
In the modern day  
  
Got a picture in my mind  
Of the way that I wanna be  
So I search until I find  
The power inside of me  
  
It's another phase  
Of the modern day  
  
Gotta face up to this life  
Can't let it get the best of me  
So I make a sacrifice  
If that's the way it has to be  
  
I'm doin' what I feel is right  
I'm ready if I need to fight  
  
In the modern way  
In the modern day  
  
Gotta face up to this life  
Can't let it get the best of me  
If I make a sacrifice  
That's the way it has to be  
  
Like a motor in overdrive  
I feel good and I feel alive  
I got no need to beg or borrow  
Got a shortcut to tomorrow  
  
And I'm on my way  
To the modern day  
Got a lot to say  
In the modern day  
  
'Cause I need to stay  
In the modern day  
  
In the modern day
