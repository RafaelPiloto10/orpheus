Did I have a dream?  
Or did the dream have me?  
Did I have a dream?  
Or did the dream have me?  
  
Set off on a night-sea journey  
Without memory or desire  
Drifting through lost latitudes  
With no compass and no chart  
  
Flying through hallucination  
Distant voices, signal fires  
Lighting up my unconscious  
And the secret places of the heart  
  
Dream temporary madness  
Dream a voice in the wilderness  
Dream unconscious revelations  
The morning says, the answer is yes  
  
Did I have a dream?  
Or did the dream have me?  
Did I have a dream?  
Or did the dream have me?  
  
Floating through a darkened mirror  
Deep reflections in disguise  
Soaring through lost altitudes  
Without wonder, without fear  
  
Symbols on a field of visions  
Behind the curtain of sleeping eyes  
On the instant of waking  
Another world of dreams appears  
  
Dream temporary madness  
Dream a walk in the wilderness  
Dream unconscious recreation  
The morning says the answer is yes  
  
Dream temporary madness  
Dream a voice in the wilderness  
Dream unconscious revelations  
The morning says, the answer is yes  
The morning says, the answer is yes
