Expanse of land that would cushion your fall  
As you tumble down from the sky  
Marble cakes of delicious design and  
They're yours, you can fly  
  
I have no wings but I wish that I had  
I have dreams about it every night  
And I can soar with the wind in my face  
On my flight, on my flight  
  
Won't you try and just bother  
Won't you bother to care  
And then somehow or other  
You'll be there  
  
Cotton clouds look like mountainous land  
Covered by December snow  
And I can see from my majestic view  
Down below, yes I know
