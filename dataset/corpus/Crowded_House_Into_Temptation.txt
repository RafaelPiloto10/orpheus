You opened up your door  
I couldn't believe my luck  
You in your new blue dress  
Taking away my breath  
The cradle is soft and warm  
Couldn't do me no harm  
You're showing me how to give  
Into temptation  
Knowing full well the earth will rebel  
Into temptation  
  
A muddle of nervous words  
Could never amount to betrayal  
The sentence is all my own  
The price is to watch it fail  
As I turn to go  
You looked at me for half a second  
With an open invitation for me to go  
  
Into temptation  
Knowing full well the earth will rebel  
Into temptation  
Safe in the wide open arms of hell  
  
We can go sailing in  
Climb down, lose yourself when you linger long  
Into temptation  
Right where you belong  
  
The guilty get no sleep  
In the last slow hours of morning  
Experience is cheap  
I should've listened to the warning  
But the cradle is soft and warm  
  
Into temptation  
Knowing full well the earth will rebel  
Into your wide open arms  
No way to break the spell  
Don't tell
