Engineer: Aren't you a little young to build a rollercoaster?  
Phineas: Yes, yes I am  
Eng.: Well, I must say that I'm really quite impressed!  
But all your permits are in order,  
Don't forget the bricks and mortar  
And if you need a power loader be my guest  
But if I'm pressed -  
I'd say you look a little young to drive a forklift...  
Phineas: Yes, yes I am  
Eng.: It's good to see a younger guy like you,  
Who's creative and ambitious  
A little bigger than his britches  
And who got a fresh, exciting point of view  
Yes, it's true  
That you seem a little young  
To do the things that you do,  
Even with all the moxie you've got,  
Yes, you seem a little green  
To be controlling this machinery...  
Phineas: Yeah, I get that a lot
