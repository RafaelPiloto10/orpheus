I can feel the world upon my back  
I got sixteen people breathin down my neck  
And it's kinda hard to keep your head afloat  
When the rain won't stop and your face is soaked  
But I'm  
  
I'm alright alright  
I'm alright alright  
  
[Chorus:]  
So just hang on cause I  
I won't be long and  
Just sing that song to me  
It goes I'm in love with you  
In love with me  
  
And I can feel your breath upon my neck  
One last caress I'm a nervous wreck and it's  
Kinda hard to keep your head afloat  
When the rain won't stop and your face is soaked  
But I'm  
  
I'm alright alright  
I'm alright alright  
  
So just hang on cause I  
I won't be long and  
Just sing that song to me  
It goes I'm in love with you  
In love with me  
Yeah I'm in love with you in love with me  
  
I'm alright alright  
I'm alright alright  
  
So just hang on cause I  
I won't be long and  
Just sing that song to me  
It goes I'm in love with you  
In love with me  
Goes I'm in love with you in love with me  
Yeah I'm in love with you in love with me now  
Yeah I'm in love with you in love with me
