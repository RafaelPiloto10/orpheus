I, walk alone in the dark, with you  
And deep, in the shadows I run, without you  
And here, here I stand, the king of fools  
Now Love's here, where are you  
Baby can you hear me  
Can you hear me callin'  
Baby can you hear my  
Message of love  
Baby can you hear me  
Can you hear me callin',  
Baby can you hear my  
Message of love  
Why, have I waited so long to be there...for you  
Now, now I'm ready to give everything...to you  
Now love's here, where are you  
Baby can you hear me callin',  
Baby you hear my  
Message of love  
Baby can you hear me  
Can you hear me callin',  
Baby can you hear my  
Message of love  
I hear...but I never listen  
I see...and still I'm blind  
All alone...lost in the silence, I'm dyin'  
Baby can you hear me  
Can you hear me callin',  
Baby can you hear my  
Message of love  
Baby can you hear me  
Can you hear me callin',  
Baby can you hear my  
Message of love  
Message...do you, do you. do you hear me  
Do you hear my message  
Baby can you hear me callin', callin'  
Do you, do you hear me
