Some girls got it some girls don't  
Some girls do it some girls won't  
Some girls want to run your life  
Some want to sink your boat  
  
Girls - Sweet sweet girls  
Make you break you girls don't care  
Wake you shake you get you there  
Some girls like to play it cool  
  
Some like to kiss and tell  
Girls - Sweet sweet girls  
It's not new but it's gotta be faced  
A man can be turned by a pretty face  
  
Can't live with them  
Can't live without them  
Girls - Sweet sweet girls  
Girls in movies girls in space  
Girls on T.V. girls that race  
  
Some girls want to tie you down  
Some girls don't want to know  
Girls - Sweet sweet girls  
It's not true but it's gotta be faced  
  
A man can be turned by a pretty face  
Can't live with them  
Can't live without them  
Girls - Sweet sweet girls  
  
Some girls got it some girls don't  
Some girls do it some girls won't  
Some girls want to run your life  
Some want to sink your boat  
  
Girls - Sweet sweet girls  
Girls - Sweet sweet girls  
Girls - Sweet sweet girls  
Girls - Sweet sweet sweet girls
