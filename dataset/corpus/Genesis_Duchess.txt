Times were good,  
She never thought about the future, she just did what she would  
Oh but she really cared  
About her music, it all seemed so important then,  
  
And she dreamed that every time that she performed  
Everyone would cry for more,  
That all she had to do was step into the light,  
And everyone would start to roar.  
  
And on the road,  
Where all but a few fall by the wayside on the grassier verge,  
She battled through  
Against the others in her world, and the sleep, and the odds.  
  
But now every time that she performed  
Oh everybody cried for more,  
Soon all she had to do was step into the light,  
For everyone to start to roar.  
And all the people cried, you're the one we've waited for.  
  
Oh but time went by  
It wasn't so easy now, all uphill, and not feeling so strong.  
Yes times were hard,  
Too much thinking 'bout the future and what people might want.  
  
An then there was the time that she performed  
When nobody called for more  
And soon every time she stepped into the light,  
They really let her know the score.  
But she dreamed of the times when she sang all her songs  
And everybody cried for more,  
When all she had to do was step into the light  
For everyone to start to roar.  
And all the people cried, you're the one we've waited for.
