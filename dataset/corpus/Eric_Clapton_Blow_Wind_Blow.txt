When the sun rose this morning  
I didn't have my baby by my side  
When the sun rose this morning  
I didn't have my baby by my side  
I don't know where she was  
I know she's out with some another guy  
Don't the sun look lonesome  
Shadin' down behind the trees?  
Don't the sun look lonesome  
Shadin' down behind the trees?  
But don't your house look lonesome  
When your baby's packed to leave?  
Blow wind, blow wind  
Blow my baby back to me  
Blow wind, blow wind  
Blow my baby back to me  
Well you know if I don't soon find her, I will be in misery  
Goodbye baby that is all I have left to say  
Ohh, goodbye baby, that is all I have left to say  
But you have lost your good thing  
Go ahead and have your own way
