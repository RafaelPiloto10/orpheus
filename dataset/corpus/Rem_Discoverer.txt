Hey baby!  
This is not a challenge, just means that I love you as much as I always said I
did  
I was wrong  
I have been laughable, wrong  
Sand-paper, paper-mache, chalk, hung out wet.  
  
Oh the city! We all scan now, na, na, na, na, na, na.  
Well I didn't have to be afraid, I didn't have to be so stupid.  
I can see myself.  
I can feel  
  
With just the slightest bit of finesse  
I might have made a little less mess  
But it was what it was  
Lets all get on with it  
Now!  
  
Discoverer!  
Discoverer!  
Discoverer!  
Discoverer!  
Laughing  
Discoverer!  
  
From the cross Houston where I am  
I see the city rise up tall  
The opportunities  
The possibilities  
I have never felt so called  
  
Remember the vodka-espresso night of discovery?  
Remember that  
Laughing  
Discovery  
Oh how I look back and reflect  
How I felt it  
I was sick  
I don't have to feel so wrong  
Now I wake up dreaming saffron, turmeric and brass  
  
With just the slightest bit of finesse  
I might have made a little less mess  
But it was what it was  
Let's all get on with it  
Now!  
  
With just the slightest bit of finesse  
I might have made a little less mess  
But it was what it was  
Lets all get on with it  
Now!  
  
Discoverer!  
Discoverer!  
Discoverer!  
Discoverer!  
Discoverer!  
Discoverer!
