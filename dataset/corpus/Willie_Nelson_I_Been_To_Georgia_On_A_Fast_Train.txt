On a rainy Wednesday morning that's the way that I was born in  
That old sharecropper's one room country shack  
They said my mommie left me the day before she had me  
Said she hit the road and never once looked back  
And I just like to mention my grandma's old age pension  
Is the reason why I'm standing here today  
I got all my country learning a milking and a churning  
Picking cotton raisin' hell and baling hay  
I been to Georgia on a fast train honey I wouldn't born no yesterday  
I got a good Christian raisin' and an eight grade education  
Ain't no need in y'all a treatin' me this way  
  
Now sweet Carolina I don't think I'll ever find  
Another woman put together like you are  
I like your wiggle in your walking and your big city talking  
And your brand new shiny Plymouth ragtop car  
Well it's hurry up and wait in this land of give and take  
It seems like haste it makes for waste everytime  
I declare to my soul when you hear those ages roll  
You better know I'm gonna get my share of mine  
I been to Georgia on a fast train  
  
I been to Georgia on a fast train  
There ain't no need in y'all a treatin' me this way
