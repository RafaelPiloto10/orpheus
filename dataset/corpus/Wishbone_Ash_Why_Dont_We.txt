Why don't we get some answers,  
Stop messin' around with our lives?  
We hear the same old story, where's the glory?  
It's our lives, it's our lives!  
Changes are vital, do we care?  
It's taken far too long - maybe we're there?  
Start walkin' with our time, if you dare.  
There is a rightness, yes, everywhere.  
Why don't we, why don't we,  
Open our eyes?  
Why don't we, why don't we,  
Change our minds?  
Honest and sweet surrender -  
Never wanted this illusion  
In our lives.  
Trials and tribulations,  
Familiar conversations,  
In our lives, in our lives.  
Competing against everyone,  
A trap, that, and a snare.  
Return to nature, no solution, so beware!  
How can it be this way?  
Shouldn't be so.  
Surviving day after day,  
Unwilling to let go.  
Why don't we, why don't we,  
Share this time?  
Why don't we, why don't we,  
Open our eyes?  
Livin' with a global village,  
Aware of the unexpected  
In our lives.  
Transforming greed and pillage,  
Not to be rejected -  
It's our lives, it's our lives!  
Changes are vital, do we care?  
It's taken far too long - maybe we're there?  
Stop workin' with our time, if you dare.  
There is a rightness, yes, everywhere.  
Why don't we, why don't we,  
Open our eyes?  
Why don't we, why don't we,  
Share this time?  
Why don't we, why don't we,  
Change their minds?  
Why don't we, why don't we,  
Share our lives?
