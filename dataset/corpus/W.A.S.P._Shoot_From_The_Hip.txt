All my life I've taken what I want  
Give an inch, take a mile  
Always on the hunt  
Ooh - sex, money, fast cars, never get my fill  
I ride hard and die free  
Paying for my thrills  
Fire, water, moonshine, going to my head  
He and my pistols loaded  
Go out and knock'em dead  
  
[REFRAIN:]  
I'm gonna shoot it, bang-boom  
Shoot it from the hip  
Got it loaded bang, pull the trigger boom  
I don't never miss  
I'm gonna shoot it, bang-boom  
Shoot it from the hip  
Got it loaded bang, pull the trigger boom  
I don't never miss  
  
Hot sweaty steel, a woman's finger's on my gun  
Pull it hard, touch the trigger  
Squeeze it when I'm gone  
Ooh, come, woman, touch me, put it in your hand  
Take a hold heart and soul  
Honey, I'm your man  
Cock the hammer slowly and aim it at your love  
Put my barrel in your holster  
Like a velvet glove  
  
[REFRAIN:]  
  
Hot and sticky, here it comes  
Emotion you can't tame  
Kind a tricky watch it run  
Smoking like a flame, flame, flame  
  
Hot and sticky, here it comes  
I got the bullet, load it up  
Slide it into place  
My emotions  
Coming down all across your face  
  
[REFRAIN:]
