Yes, it's a good day for singin' a song,  
And it's a good day for movin' along,  
Yes, it's a good day, how could anything go wrong,  
A good day from mornin' till night.  
  
Yes, it's a good day for shinin' your shoes,  
And it's a good day for losin' the blues,  
Ev'rything to gain and nothin' to lose,  
Cause it's a good day from mornin' till night.  
  
I said to the sun, "good mornin', sun.  
Rise and shine, today"  
You know you've gotta get goin'  
If you're gonna make a showin'  
And you know you've got the right of way  
  
Cause it's a good day for payin' your bills,  
And it's a good day for curin' your ills,  
So take a deep breath and throw away your pills,  
Cause it's a good day from mornin' till night.
