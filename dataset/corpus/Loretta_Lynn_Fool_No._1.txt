Am I fool number one or am I fool number two  
How many other girls have been fooled by you  
I suppose that the number is far from being small  
But I'll bet that I'm the biggest fool of all  
  
If I had the chance I guess I'd do it all again  
I'd go down that same old road even knowing at the end  
You'd leave me when your heart hears a new love call  
So I guess that I'm the biggest fool of all  
[ piano ]  
Am I fool number one...
