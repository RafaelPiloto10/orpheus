Before we take off all our clothes and get close together  
Before it gets too serious both of us need to know  
Are we gonna go the whole awy this time?  
This time?  
  
Before all secrets are revealed old scars must heal or wither  
But it's getting very late and I can't wait anymore  
Are we gonna go the whole way this time  
Do you want to go the whole way this time?  
This time?  
  
Do you want to go the whole way now?  
We're taking it easy  
Do you want to go the whole way, Babe?  
Kick it in, kick it in slowly.  
  
Do you want to go the whole way this time?  
Do you want to go the whole way for sure  
Do you want to go the whole way this time?  
This time?  
This time?  
Do ya?
