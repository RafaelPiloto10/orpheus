Into the night  
Still falls the rain  
Even the dogs stay home tonight  
Out on the streets  
Going nowhere  
Just one direction in my thoughts  
Love can be magic  
It can be a game  
Sometimes it's tragic  
And sometimes a shame  
Words were my bullets  
Emotion my gun  
I was a runner  
Now I'm on the run  
Sometimes I wish that you were dead  
That is because you haunt me so  
I wasn't right to let you go away  
I try to kill the pain inside  
But you are always on my mind  
No matter where I go or stay  
Sometimes I dream my time away  
And we're together again  
But I know that can never be  
And all my hopes are in vain  
You were my treasure  
That I didn't know  
You were the sun in my life  
Thought I was dying  
When I realized  
There's just one chance to survive.
