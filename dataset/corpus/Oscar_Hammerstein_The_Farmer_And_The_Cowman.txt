Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends  
Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends  
One man likes to push a plow  
The other likes to chase a cow  
But that's no reason why they can't be friends  
  
Territory folks should stick together  
Territory folks should all be pals  
Cowboys dance with the farmer's daughters  
Farmers dance with the rancher's gals  
  
Territory folks should stick together  
Territory folks should all be pals  
Cowboys dance with the farmer's daughters  
Farmers dance with the rancher's gals!  
  
I'd like to say a word for the farmer  
  
Well, say it!  
  
He come out west and made a lot of changes  
  
That's right!  
  
He come out west and built a lot of fences  
And built 'em right across our cattle ranges!  
  
Why don't you dirt strangers go back to Missouri Where you belong?  
  
We got just as much right here!  
  
Shut up!  
The farmer a good in criticism  
No matter what the cowman says or thinks  
You seldom see 'I'm drinkin in a bar room  
  
Unless somebody else is buying drinks!  
  
Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends  
Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends  
The cowman ropes a cow with ease  
The farmer steals her butter and cheese  
That's no reason why they can't be friends  
  
Territory folks should stick together  
Territory folks should all be pals  
Cowboys dance with the farmer's daughters  
Farmers dance with the rancher's gals!  
  
I'd like to say a word for the cowboy  
  
You would!  
  
The road he treads is difficult and stony  
He rides fer days on end with just a pony for a friend  
  
I sure am feeling sorry for the pony!  
  
The farmer should be sociable with the cowboy  
If he rides by an' asks fer food and water  
Don't treat 'I'm like a louse  
Make him welcome in your house  
  
But be sure that you've locked up your wife and daughters!  
  
(They all offend themselves at the same time and fight)  
  
Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends  
Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends  
One man likes to push a plow  
The other likes to chase a cow  
But that's no reason why they can't be friends  
  
Gun shot  
  
Ain't nobody gonna slug anything! This here's a party!  
Break it up ya two ol' fools! Alright, Andrew, sing it.  
Dum-dah-dee-um-dum-dum  
  
Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends  
  
Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends  
One man likes to push a plow  
The other likes to chase a cow  
But that's no reason why they can't be friends  
  
And when this territory is a state  
An' joins the Union just like all the others  
The farmer, the cowman, and the merchant  
Must all behave theirselves and act like brothers  
  
I'll teach you all a little sayin'  
And learn the words by heart the way you should  
I don't say I'm no better than anybody else  
But I'll be danged if I ain't just as good!  
  
I don't say I'm better than anybody else  
But I'll be danged if I ain't just as good!  
  
Territory folks should stick together  
Territory folks should all be pals  
Cowboys dance with the farmer's daughters  
Farmers dance with the rancher's gals!
