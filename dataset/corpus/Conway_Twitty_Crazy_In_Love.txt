Ain't it funny how time  
Steals the feelings from a love affair  
And there's no place to lay the blame  
It ain't a case of no one cares  
Helplessly just watch it fade away  
Neither will admit it, we're both aching to say  
  
Ooh, I miss the days when we were crazy in love  
When you weren't so sure of me  
I had my little jealousies  
Ooh, bring back the days when we were crazy in love  
I need to feel that way again  
Remember when we were crazy in love  
  
Oh, it used to be so easy  
One touch and you were high  
And I could get intoxicated just by looking in your eyes  
Baby ain't there anything we can do  
'Cause I know you're missing me  
As much as I've been missing you  
  
Ooh, I miss the days when we were crazy in love  
When you weren't so sure of me  
I had my little jealousies  
Ooh, bring back the days when we were crazy in love  
I need to feel that way again  
Remember when we were crazy in love  
  
We were more than best of friends  
We were crazy in love  
Crazy in love  
Crazy in love
