[Chorus]  
Love, talk about love  
Why do you always  
want to talk about love?  
Love, talk about love  
Why do you always  
want to talk about it?  
  
I say that love  
Is something you feel  
You know in your heart  
If it's real  
But you've got to analyze  
Organize, synchronize, formalize  
And compromise  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I say love  
It's like when you sing  
You move to the music  
When the words don't mean a thing  
But, know you've got to clarify  
Define it and refine it  
Align and realign it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You don't have to understand  
Every little thing between  
A woman and a man  
True love  
Comes from deep inside  
Try to use your logic  
And you'll only lose your mind  
  
[Chorus]
