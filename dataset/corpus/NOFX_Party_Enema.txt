Hangin' out in long beach.  
A lil' party in the sun, but ya just can't sit there smoking and drinking
anymore.  
You got a new jive. All your friends are getting weird. Ahhh!  
It goes, "you ain't a shakin till the shit shot.  
  
Shoot it up.  
No one jammin' til the gin juice jigger jets.  
They say it ain't a party til the party enema, the party enema.  
You get a funnel tube, pour in a 40 oz.  
  
Pull down your clothes, touch your toes.  
Get a hose, hold your nose.  
It's a party hat. Forget the beer bong.  
Forget the nitrous shots.  
  
It goes "you ain't a shakin' 'til the shit shot.  
Shoot it up.  
No one jammin' til the gin juice jigger jets.  
They say it ain't a party 'til the party enema, the party enema.  
  
The party enema, the party enema.  
The party enema, the party enema...
