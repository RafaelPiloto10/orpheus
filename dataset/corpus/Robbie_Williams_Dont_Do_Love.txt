I could be an animal for many years to come  
It would be understandable if this animal had fun  
My wayward soul will never set me free  
And commitment's a miracle, and I'm physical, you see  
  
I'm not your lover, baby  
I'm not the one  
I won't meet your mother, lady  
I don't do love  
  
You won't buy my attitude,  
So it's solitude for free  
And I can't help being rude,  
If you get to close to me  
You are the one, with your finger on the gun  
So I am that animal, and animals will run  
  
I'm not your love's, baby  
I'm not the one  
I won't meet your mother, lady  
I don't do love  
  
I can't believe  
It's not in me  
You see me leave  
If I can't breathe  
  
I could be an animal, for many years to come  
It would be understandable, if this animal had fun  
And I've got my alibi, so I'll say goodbye  
  
I'm not your lover, baby  
I'm not the one  
I've been too smothered lately  
I don't do love  
  
I can't believe  
That you can't see  
It's not in me  
Now see me leave  
  
I don't do love  
I don't do love  
I don't do love  
I don't do love  
I don't do love  
I don't do love
