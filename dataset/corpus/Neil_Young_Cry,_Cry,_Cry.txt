Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry,  
Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry,  
Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry.  
  
Well, old man river just keeps on rollin'  
On down the line  
Like my tears just keep on flowin'  
All the time  
Can't you hear me cry.  
  
Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry,  
Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry,  
Cry, cry, cry, cry.  
  
Well, somewhere there's a rainbow for me,  
I know it's my time  
I am getting so tired  
Of standing in this light  
Can't you hear me cry.  
  
Boo, hoo, hoo, boo, hoo, hoo,  
Boo, hoo, hoo, boo, boo, hoo,  
Boo, hoo, hoo, cry, cry, cry.  
  
Boo, hoo, hoo, boo, hoo, hoo,  
Cry, cry, cry, cry.
