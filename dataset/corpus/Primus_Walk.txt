Can't you see I'm easily bothered by persistance?  
One step away from lashing out at you...  
You want in to get under my skin and call yourself a friend.  
I've got more friends like you  
What do I do?  
Is there no standard anymore?  
  
What it takes, who am I, where I've been, belong  
You can't be something you're not  
  
Be yourself, by yourself, stay away from me  
A lesson learned in life, known from the dawn of time  
  
Respect. Walk  
  
Run your mouth when I'm not around, it's easy to acheive.  
You cry to weak friends that sympathize. Can you hear the  
Violins playing your song? Those same friens tell me your  
Every word  
  
Are you talking to me?  
  
No way punk!
