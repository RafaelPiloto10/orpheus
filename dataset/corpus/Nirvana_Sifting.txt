Afraid to grade  
Wouldn't it be fun  
Cross says floss  
Wouldn't it be fun  
Wet your bed  
Wouldn't it be fun  
Sun felt numb  
Wouldn't it be fun  
  
Your eyes  
Teacher said  
Your eyes  
Teacher said  
Your eyes  
Teacher said  
The Preacher said  
  
Don't have nothing for you  
Don't have nothing for you  
Don't have nothing for you  
Don't have nothing for you  
Don't have nothing for you  
Don't have nothing for you  
Don't have nothing for you  
  
Spell the smell  
Wouldn't it be fun  
Search for a church  
Wouldn't it be fun  
Wet your bed  
Wouldn't it be fun  
Colt ain't cold  
Wouldn't it be fun  
  
Your eyes  
Teacher said  
Your eyes  
Teacher said  
Your eyes  
The Preacher said  
The Preacher said  
  
Don't have nothing for you  
Don't have nothing for you  
Don't have nothing for you  
Don't have nothing for you  
Don't have nothing for you  
Don't have nothing for you  
Don't have nothing for you  
  
Don't have nothing for you  
Don't have nothing for you  
Don't have nothing for you  
Don't have nothing for you  
Don't have nothing for you  
Don't have nothing for you  
Don't have nothing for you  
Don't have nothing for you  
Don't have nothing for you
