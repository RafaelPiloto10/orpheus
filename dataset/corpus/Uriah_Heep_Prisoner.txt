Time has come to say goodbye  
To the broken memories  
They're locked inside like prisoners  
In a place that no-one sees  
  
Stayed up late with a friend of mine  
Southern comfort till dawn  
We talked about the pains of love  
Should've known from  
The start you were wrong  
  
I'm just a prisoner  
Don't wanna lock myself away  
Prisoner, I get so lonely, lonely  
I'm a prisoner  
Just when do you think love will stay  
It walks right out on you, out on you  
  
Tired blood runs through my veins  
But I can't get no sleep  
You lock my heart  
In these prison walls  
This place I've got to leave  
  
I'm a prisoner  
Don't wanna lock myself away  
Prisoner, I get so lonely, lonely  
I'm a prisoner  
Just when do you think love will stay  
It walks right out on you, out on you  
  
The sky is gray, it's raining  
Like the storm in my heart  
There ain't no use explaining  
'cause I'm leaving, leaving  
  
Won't somebody set me free  
Take me away from this misery  
I get so lonely  
I get so lonely, lonely, lonely  
Won't somebody set me free  
Please, please, set me free
