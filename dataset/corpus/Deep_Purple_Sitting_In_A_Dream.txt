I'm just passing time before the Ball  
Playing my guitar  
I don't have to be where I don't want to be at all  
Maybe I'll go far  
Going nowhere, sitting in a dream...  
Ah, in a dream  
Sitting in a landscape full of sighs  
Dream away the day  
Making up a tune about the blueness of the skies  
This is where I'll stay  
Going nowhere, sitting in a dream...  
Oh, in a dream  
Watching as a red and white balloon  
Sails across my mind  
In between the images that drift along my tune  
Smile as they unwind  
Going nowhere, sitting in a dream...  
Ah, in a dream
