My dusty feet have kicked the stones  
Between a thousand railroad ties  
From Boston down to New Orleans  
I left the girls a cryin'  
But I've still got some ramblin' in me  
Got some miles left on my shoes  
And before I take a job again  
I'll have to be low-down  
Cryin' the blues  
So it's goodbye, baby, the whistle is a blowin'  
If I miss the train I'll have to stay around  
But as long as those railroad tracks go on unending  
I'll be off to another day in another town  
  
You say you'd like to ramble with me  
This ain't no life for a girl  
Too many people out to get you in a hobo's world  
And it gets mighty cold when you're on the road  
'Cause a boxcar never was a home  
But you could join me if you want  
I'm gettin' mighty tired of bein' alone  
So it's goodbye, baby, the whistle is a blowin'  
If we miss the train we'll have to stay around  
But as long as those railroad tracks go on unending  
We'll be off to another day in another town  
  
But as long as those railroad tracks go on unending  
We'll be off to another day in another town  
We'll be off to another day in another town
