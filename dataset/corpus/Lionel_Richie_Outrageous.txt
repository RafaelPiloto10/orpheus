She's outrageous, scandalous  
The way she rocks is too much  
And she's fire and rain, She blows your brains  
The way she works that body  
  
And she'll tease ya and she'll please ya  
She'll make you feel like you're king of the world  
She's so funny takes your money  
Ah! But that's just what she does  
  
And it's all night baby, And it's alright baby  
She's outrageous, scandalous  
The way she rocks is too much  
And she's fire and rain, She blows your brains  
The way she works that body  
  
There's no weakness to her sweetness  
She's as nasty as you want to be  
Can't deny her your desire  
She'll love you good and set you free  
  
And it's all night baby, And it's alright baby  
She's outrageous, scandalous  
The way she rocks is too much  
And she's fire and rain, She blows your brains  
The way she works that body  
  
Just you and me baby, You're driving me crazy  
I'll spend a little more money, On you and me honey
