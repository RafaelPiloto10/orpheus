Open the window  
Let the sunset in  
If only for the last time  
Let me see you smile again  
  
I'll take my records  
You can have your books  
I'm sorry I never read them  
But it says so much about us  
  
Always trying  
To make love out of care  
The perfect recipe  
But something wasn't there  
  
[Chorus]  
And I wish you  
Sunrays and Saturdays  
Perfect starry nights  
Sweet dreams and moonbeams  
And a love that's warm and bright  
  
Sunrays and Saturdays  
Friendship strong and true  
Oceans of blue and a room with a view  
To live the life you choose  
  
You'll write me letters  
I'll call you on the on the phone  
A wire away from touching  
And never quite alone  
  
We'll get to know ourselves again  
And we'll heal our hearts  
It's not that we're bad together  
We're just better off apart  
  
Always trying  
To have one and one make two  
And even though it never worked  
I still feel love for you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sunrays and Saturdays  
Friendship strong and true  
Oceans of blue and a room with a view  
To live the life you, live the life you,  
Live the life you choose
