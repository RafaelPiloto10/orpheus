Feet hit the ground feet leavin' town quicker than a bullet or a knife  
Fallin' ain't no fun when you're on the run honey we was running for our life  
When Stagger Lee had drunk his fill of moonlight  
He turned his burning eyes upon my soul  
It's time my God to spend this night with someone else he said  
Squeeze a little pleasure from the gold love and glory  
We can take it easy when we're old  
He said we'll take us into town lay our money down  
I'll bring you to the sweetest thing that grows  
Because the fairest ones in sight are bloomin' every night  
At a tavern called the Sabre and the Rose  
We swang into the saddle sick as breathing  
And slapped 'em once for pleasure with the reins  
The horses snorted frosty in the moonlight  
Somethin' dark was singing in my veins older than the voices in my brain  
He said this place you're gonna see is why they live and breathe  
And sink down a little bit deeper everyday  
And sometimes at night when the wind is running right  
You can hear it suckin' thirty miles away  
Then the light was crimson and I found her all naked and eternal and insane  
Secred as the mysteries around her like a veil nothin' but her prison was
profane  
All we had in common was our chains  
Oh burn it down boys burn it to the ground boys burn it on down  
Feet hit the ground feet leavin' town quicker than a bullet or a knife  
All there was she ran holdin' to my hand runnin' for the river and our life  
Slidin' from the moonlight into shadows silent as the river as it flows  
Swimmin' to the place they'll never find us all we left behind us was our
clothes  
And the stories children sing about the Sabre and the Rose
