Ain't necessarily so.  
Ain't necessarily so.  
Things you're liable  
To read in a bible  
  
Ain't necessarily so.  
Little David he was small, alright,  
Yeah, now David he was small alright,  
Just like Goliath  
  
Lay dying then he dieth,  
Oh he was small, alright.  
Little Moses he was found in a stream.  
Yeah Moses now he was found in a stream  
  
When that Pharaoh's sweet daughter  
She came by and fished that boy out from the water,  
Fished him, she said, from a stream.  
Now Jonah now he lived in a whale.  
  
Yeah Jonah he lived in a whale  
Yet he made his home in that  
Fish's abdomen.  
Jonah he lived in a whale.  
  
I said, ain't necessarily so.  
No, ain't necessarily so.  
The things you're liable  
To read in a bible  
  
Ain't necessarily so.  
Ain't necessarily so.  
No, it ain't necessarily so.
