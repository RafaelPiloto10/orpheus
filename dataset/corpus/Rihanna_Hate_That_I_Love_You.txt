That's how much I love you  
That's how much I need you  
And I can't stand you  
Must everything you do make me wanna smile  
Can I not like you for awhile? (No)  
  
But you won't let me  
You upset me, girl  
And then you kiss my lips  
All of a sudden I forget (that I was upset)  
Can't remember what you did  
  
(But I hate it) You know exactly what to do  
So that I can't stay mad at you  
For too long, that's wrong  
  
(But I hate it) You know exactly how to touch  
So that I don't want to fuss and fight no more  
Said I despise that I adore you  
  
And I hate how much I love you, boy (yeah)  
I can't stand how much I need you (I need you)  
And I hate how much I love you, boy (ooh, whoa)  
But I just can't let you go  
And I hate that I love you so (ooh)  
  
And you completely know the power that you have (the power that you have)  
The only one makes me laugh (one that makes you laugh)  
  
Sad, and it's not fair  
How you take advantage of the fact  
That I love you beyond a reason why  
And it just ain't right  
  
And I hate how much I love you, girl  
I can't stand how much I need you (yeah)  
And I hate how much I love you, girl  
But I just can't let you go  
But I hate that I love you so  
  
One of these days maybe your magic won't affect me  
And your kiss won't make me weak  
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me  
So you'll probably always have a spell on me  
Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
That's how much I love you (how much I need you)  
That's how much I need you (how much I love you)  
That's how much I love you (Oh, need you)  
That's how much I need you (I need you)  
  
And I hate that I love you so  
And I hate how much I love you, boy  
I can't stand how much I need ya (I can't stand how much I need you)  
And I hate how much I love you, boy  
But I just can't let you go (but I just can't let you go, no)  
And I hate that I love you so (ooh)  
  
And I hate that I love you so, so
