Sometimes I wonder  
what this old world's comin' to  
where it's all gonna end  
'Cause I work all week  
try'n' to save me a dollar  
but I get further in debt  
But now on in  
I'm gonna spend time lovin'  
find a baby sitter right now  
Put on your red dress  
high heels darlin'  
tonight we're going up town  
  
We're goin' out dancin'  
We're goin' out dancin'  
We're goin' out dancin'  
Chase our blues away  
  
I know a funny little place  
down on main street baby  
where the band will play all night long  
They play some hot rock 'n' roll to fine syncopation  
and a brother on the saxophone  
We got one chance baby  
gotta be now or never  
Yeah I know as I'm broke  
We're gonna make this weekend last forever  
come on honey put on your coat  
  
We're goin' out dancin'  
We're goin' out dancin'  
We're goin' out dancin'  
Chase our blues away  
  
I've been lovin' you for seven years I won't forget  
and I know it's been hard sometimes  
open up the wine let's pretend we just met  
  
We'll get home in the morning  
while the milk man's calling  
and the early birds start to sing  
I will roll you some breakfast  
and we'll jump into bed  
and we'll start all over again  
So hang on tight baby  
we'll go flyin'  
give your man a big kiss  
We're gonna boogie on down  
from the Bronx to Manhattan  
memories are made of this  
  
We're goin' out dancin'  
We're goin' out dancin'  
We're goin' out dancin'  
Chase our blues away  
  
Dancin'  
We're goin' out dancin'  
It may be the Bossanova  
It may be the twist  
It may be the Watusi  
It may be the Chachacha  
  
Just as long as we're dancin'  
come on baby dancin  
Take away our blues tonight  
take away my blues tonight  
Just as long as we're dancin'  
dancin', dancin', dancin'
