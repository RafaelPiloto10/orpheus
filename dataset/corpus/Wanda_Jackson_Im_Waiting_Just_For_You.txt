You have to leave me all by myself dear and I've been crying the whole night
through  
But I've been telling everybody I'm waitin' just for you  
Your friends are trying so hard to tempt me there's no use trying cause I'll
be true  
And darling you don't have to worry nobody else will do  
  
I know this waitin' can drive me crazy don't mind this waitin' it's nothing
new  
For I'll be telling everybody I'm waitin' just for you  
Maybe a long time before I see you so we can do what we used to do  
But I'll be telling everybody I'm waitin' just for you
