[Chorus]  
I'm gonna suffer for you no longer  
I'm gonna suffer for you no more  
I'm gonna write you out of my life  
And shut the door  
  
You tried to drive a wedge between me and my friends  
You pushed me to the edge time and again  
I've been living in your shade since I can't remember when  
Now I'm bringing this charade to an end  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There was subtlety and skill in your manipulative ways  
You chipped away my will so you could make me stay  
You soothed me with your voice until I obeyed  
But I'm making my own choice from today  
  
You used the tongue of love like a boxer uses fists  
You contained me like a glove or a creeping cloak of mist  
You guaranteed the stars but there always was a twist  
Now I see you as you are, Egotist !  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've got a ticket in my hand and I must be moving on  
But I want you to understand that from the moment I am gone  
I release and let you go, you owe nothing now to me  
I'm not angry anymore, I'm free !  
  
[Chorus]
