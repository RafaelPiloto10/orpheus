I feel like I died and went to Heaven  
The cupboards are bare  
But the streets are paved with gold  
  
I saw a young girl who didn't die  
I saw a glimmer from in her eye  
I saw the distance, I saw the past  
And I know I won't awaken, it's a dream that can last  
  
I feel like I died and went to Heaven  
The cupboards are bare  
But the streets are paved with gold  
  
And all the lights were turned down low  
And no one wondered or had to go  
Out on the corner the angels say  
There is a better life for me someday  
  
I feel like I died and went to Heaven  
The cupboards are bare  
But the streets are paved with gold
