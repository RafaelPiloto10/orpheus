All day  
Hiding from the sun  
Waiting for the golden one  
Waiting for your fame  
After the parade has gone  
  
Outside was a happy place  
Every face had a smile like the golden face  
For a second  
Your knuckles white as your fingers curl  
The shot that was heard around the world  
For a seconds  
  
It took seconds of your time to take his life  
It took seconds  
  
It took seconds of your time to take his life  
It took seconds  
  
It took seconds of your time to take his life  
It took seconds of your time to take his life  
Seconds  
Seconds  
  
It took seconds of your time to take his life  
It took secons  
  
It took seconds of your time to take his life  
It took seconds  
  
For a second  
  
It took seconds of your time to take his life  
It took seconds  
  
It took seconds of your time to take his life  
It took seconds  
  
For a second  
  
It took seconds of your time to take his life  
Seconds of your time to take his life  
For a second  
For a second  
For a second
