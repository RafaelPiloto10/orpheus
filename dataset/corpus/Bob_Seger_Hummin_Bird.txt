Sometimes I get impatient  
Be she cools me without words  
And she comes so softly  
My hummingbird  
And have you heard  
I thought my life had ended  
But I found that it's just begun  
Cause she gets me where where I live  
I'd give her everything I've got to give  
All for that hummingbird  
Oh she's little and she loves me  
Too much for words to say  
I see her in the morning sleeping  
Yeah she's little and she loves me  
It's my lucky day  
Hummingbird don't fly away  
When I'm feelin' wild and lonesome  
She knows just what to say  
She gives me so much understanding  
In her little way  
Lord I gotta say  
In my life I'm gonna love no other  
She's more than I deserve  
She gets me where where I live  
I'd give her everything that's mine to give  
All for that hummingbird  
Oh she's little and she loves me  
Too much for words to say  
I see her in the morning sleeping  
Yeah she's little and she loves me  
It's my lucky day  
Hummingbird don't fly away
