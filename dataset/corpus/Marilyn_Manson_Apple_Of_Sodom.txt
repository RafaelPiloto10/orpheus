I've drained my heart, I've burned my soul.  
I've trained the core to stop my growth.  
I pray to die in grace,  
To cover me in snow,  
To cover me in snow,  
Cover me in snow,  
I'm dying, I hope you're dying too.  
Cover me in snow.  
I'm dying, I hope you're dying too.  
I'm dying, I hope you're dying too.  
I'm dying, I hope you're dying too.  
  
I'm dying, I hope you're dying too.  
I'm dying, I hope you're dying too.  
I'm dying, I hope you're dying too.  
I'm dying, I hope you're dying too.  
  
Take this from me.  
Hate me. Hate me.  
Take this from me.  
Hate me. Hate me.
