Honey its getting close to midnight, and all the myths are still in town  
True love and lipstick on your linen, bite the pillow make no sound  
If there's some living to be done before your life becomes your tomb  
You'd better know that I'm the one, so unchain your back door invite me around  
  
Bring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter  
Let her go, let her go, let her go  
Bring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter  
Let her go, let her go, let her go  
Let her go, yeah!  
Honey its getting close to daybreak, the sun is creeping in the sky  
No patent remedies for heartache, just empty words and humble pie  
So get down on your knees honey, assume an attitude  
You just pray that I'll be waiting cos you know I'm coming soon  
  
Bring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter  
Let her go, let her go, let her go  
Bring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter  
Let her go, let her go, let her go  
  
So pick up your foolish pride, no going back  
No where, no way, no place to hide  
  
(2:24-Solo: Janick Gers)  
  
Bring your daughter, bring your daughter  
Bring your daughter, bring your daughter  
Bring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter  
Bring your daughter, fetch your daughter  
Bring your daughter, fetch your daughter  
Bring your daughter, fetch your daughter to the slaughter  
  
Bring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter  
Let her go, let her go, let her go  
Bring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter  
Let her go, let her go, let her go
