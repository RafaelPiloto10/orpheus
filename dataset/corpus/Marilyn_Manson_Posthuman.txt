She's got eyes like Zapruder  
And a mouth like heroin  
She wants me to be  
Perfect like Kennedy  
This isn't god, this isn't god  
God is just a statistic,  
God is just a statistic  
Say,  
"show me the dead stars,  
All of them sing."  
This is a riot  
Religious and clean  
  
God is a number you cannot count to  
You are post human and hardwired  
  
She's pilgrim and pagan  
Softworn and social  
In all of her dreams  
She's a saint like Jackie-o  
  
This isn't god, this isn't god  
God is just a statistic,  
God is just a statistic  
Say,  
"Show me the dead stars,  
All of them sing."  
This is a riot  
Religious and clean  
  
"All that glitters is cold, all that glitters is cold"
