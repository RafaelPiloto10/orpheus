People come and people go  
Movin' fast and movin' slow  
I'm in a crowd yet I'm all alone  
The road is long the road is rough  
I do believe I've had enough  
I'm gonna turn around and head for home.  
  
And I hope you're there  
And you still care  
And if you do,  
I'll spend my life with you.  
  
I've had all the time I need  
To rearrange my mind and lead  
The life I thought I wanted yesterday  
I played a game that couldn't last  
And now some mem'ries from the past  
Have turned my thoughts around a different way.  
  
And girl, I find  
You're still on my mind.  
And if you want me to  
I'll spend my life with you.  
  
And girl, I find  
You're still on my mind.  
And if you want me to  
I'll spend my life with you.
