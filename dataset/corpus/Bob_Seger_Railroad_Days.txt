Jan would climb up so high on the foul screen  
Down below I would yell to watch out  
When we'd play ? was always the winner  
He was brave never listened to me shout  
Afternoons playin' ball by the old wall  
Hidin' out and of course be the star  
Kept my records in old looseleaf notebooks  
And today I think I still know where they are  
Oh, Railroad days  
Railroad days  
Railroad days  
When I was young, in my prime  
On my way  
When the rain never got in my way  
Oh in my younger railroad days  
Some nights, Drifters playin' on the hi-fi  
Talkin' 'bout girls, or preposterous lies  
Laughin hard, watchin' Soupy at eleven  
Skonkin' down, one of Mom's lemon pies  
Ten o'clock, bringin' groceries from the market  
Singin songs, to the darkness of the night  
Even sang the parts the instruments were playing  
Life was freer, dreams were really quite all right  
Oh, Railroad days  
Railroad days  
Railroad days  
When the sun seemed to smile on it's way  
When the darkness was easier to play yeah  
Oh in my younger railroad days  
Yesterday, I heard they shut the trains down  
The ones than ran, by the field where I would play  
Said the folks want new and faster transportation  
It's just like me, I'll be obsolete one day  
Oh, Railroad days  
Railroad days  
Railroad days  
When I was young, in my prime  
On my way  
When the rain never got in my way  
Oh in my younger railroad days
