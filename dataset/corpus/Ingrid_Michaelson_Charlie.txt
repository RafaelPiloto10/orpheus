Charlie don't let the girls hurt your heart  
Don't let the angry boys tear you apart  
I know you're tired of not fittin' in  
But it's not fitting in that will help to begin  
To show you, your beauty  
Where is the red-headed girl?  
The one with the green lunch box  
Even though you had a brown paper bag  
Sandwiches hard as rocks  
Lunch was the happiest 45 minutes of the day  
(Lunch was the happiest 45 minutes of the day)  
For the red-headed angel would glide your way and say  
"Hello, hello, Charlie hello"  
Wake up it's after 9 and now you're late  
Yellow school bus is brimming with hate  
They love your face when it's blush as red  
Get out of bed, you're stronger now  
Get out of bed, you're stronger than before  
Get out of your bed  
Where is that red-headed girl?  
The one with the green lunch box  
Even though you had a brown paper bag  
Sandwiches hard as rocks  
Lunch was the happiest 45 minutes of the day  
(Lunch was the happiest 45 minutes of the day)  
For the red-headed angel would glide your way and say  
"Hello, hello, Charlie hello  
Hello, hello, Charlie hello  
Hello, hello, Charlie hello  
Hello, hello Charlie hello"
