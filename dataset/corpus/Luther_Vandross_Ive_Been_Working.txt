I don't know why the world loves a forever love affair  
(I'm just a freak)  
Who loves a one night thing oh yeah  
(A one night all night)  
And after a long day of work all I wanna do is play around  
(So I'm going out)  
For a little bit of love  
And a whole lotta getting down  
Do you believe me, you gotta believe me  
  
[Chorus]  
I've been working  
I've been all day working  
And I need somebody  
Said I need some  
I need some love tonight oh yeah  
I need some love  
I need some love tonight  
  
People talk about my life and here's what they say  
(It's incomplete)  
It's too bad that they feel that way  
(He's sho is crazy)  
But I don't listen to any of them after five o'clock  
Because the night is mine  
And I don't wanna change anything 'cause I like what I got  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So don't give me a forever love affair, no don't you dare  
(I like to freak)  
To the one night beat, oh yeah  
(Again and again, yeah yeah)  
I work hard every day so I do what I wanna do  
That's why I'm steppin' out (Stepping out)  
To find me somebody to do what I wanna do  
  
[Chorus]
