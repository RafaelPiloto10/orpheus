Jezebel, Jezebel  
  
If ever the devil was born without a pair of horns  
It was you, Jezebel, it was you  
If ever an angel fell, Jezebel, it was you  
Jezebel, it was you  
  
If ever a pair of eyes promised paradise  
Deceiving me, grieving me, leaving me blue  
Jezebel, it was you  
  
If ever the devil's plan was made to torment man  
It was you, Jezebel, it was you  
  
Could be better that I never know a lover such as you  
Forsaking dreams and all for the siren call of your arms  
  
Like a demon, love possessed me, you obsessed me constantly  
What evil star is mine, that my fate's design should be Jezebel?  
  
If ever a pair of eyes promised paradise  
Deceiving me, grieving me, leaving me blue  
Jezebel, it was you  
  
If ever the devil's plan was made to torment man  
It was you, Jezebel, it was you, night and day, every way  
Jezebel, Jezebel, Jezebel!
