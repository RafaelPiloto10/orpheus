Good morning heartache  
You old gloomy sight  
Good morning heartache  
Thought we said goodbye last night  
I turned and tossed until it seems you had gone  
But here you are with the dawn  
Wish I forget you, but you're here to stay  
It seems I met you  
When my love went away  
Now everyday I start by saying to you  
Good morning heartache what's new  
  
Stop haunting me now  
Can't shake you nohow  
Just leave me alone  
I've got those Monday blues  
Straight to Sunday blues  
Good morning heartache  
Here we go again  
Good morning heartache  
You're the one  
Who knew me when  
Might as well get use to you hanging around  
Good morning heartache  
Sit down
