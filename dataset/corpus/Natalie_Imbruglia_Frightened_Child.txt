I hear your silent scream  
Deep in your private dream  
Two ways to go from here  
One way will bring you near  
Fragile wish  
  
Full moon, no rain, no shame  
That distance still remains  
More shades of grey to come  
We've been through more than one  
Close your eyes  
  
Like a frightened child  
Fragile in spirit  
Like a wind blowin' wild  
No name you can give it  
Like an infant I see in the light for the very first time  
  
No tricks, no slight of hand  
Find somewhere safe to land  
Before your walls were shaken  
But now the whole thing's brakin'  
And it makes you feel  
  
Like a frightened child  
Fragile in spirit  
Like a wind blowin' wild  
No name you can give it  
Like an infant I see in the light for the very first time  
  
Yes, your right  
What is right?  
Yes it's night I can tell  
  
Yes it shows  
Yes I know  
You're a beautiful stranger to yourself
