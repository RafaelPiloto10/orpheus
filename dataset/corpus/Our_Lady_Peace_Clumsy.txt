Throw away the radio suitcase  
That keeps you awake  
Hide the telephone in case, you realize that sometimes you're not okay  
You level off but its not all right now  
You need to understand  
There's nothing strange about this  
You need to know your friends  
I'll be waving my hand watching you drown  
Watching you scream  
Quiet or loud  
Maybe you should sleep  
Maybe you just need a friend  
As clumsy as you've been  
There's no one laughing  
You will be safe in here  
Throw away this very old shoelace that tripped you again  
Try and shrug it off  
It's only skin now  
You need to understand  
There's nothing fake about this  
You need to let me in  
I'm watching you
