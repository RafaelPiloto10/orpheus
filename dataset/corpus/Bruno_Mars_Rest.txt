Everyday I wakeup  
Next to an angel  
More beautiful than  
Words can say.  
  
They said it wouldn't work  
But what do they know?  
Cause years have past  
And we're still here today.  
  
Never in my dreams  
Did I think  
That this  
Would happen to me.  
  
As I stand here  
Before my woman  
I can't fight back  
The tears in my eyes.  
  
Oh how could I be so lucky  
I must have done something right.  
And I promise to love her  
For the rest of my life.  
  
It seems like yesterday  
When she first said "Hello"  
Funny how times fly  
When you're in love.  
  
It took us a lifetime  
To find each other  
It was worth the wait  
'Cause I finally found the one.  
  
Never in my dreams  
Did I think  
That this  
Would happen to me.  
  
As I stand here  
Before my woman  
I can't fight back  
The tears in my eyes.  
  
Oh how could I be so lucky  
I must have done something right.  
And I promise to love her  
For the rest of my life.
