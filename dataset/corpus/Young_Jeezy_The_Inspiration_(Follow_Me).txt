Whats up?  
Ha ha  
Yeah! Yes! It's real talk, can I talk to y'all for a minute?  
I was in the streets the other day,  
I had a homie come through and he ask me  
Say "Yo! Everybody listen to you,  
Everybody all ears, what you gonna do to give back?"  
I told him "Look homie, I'm ten steps ahead of you, if not thirty"  
Real talk, listen up, I got one song, let's make it right, let's go  
  
I'm high on life and a fifth of Remy  
From the city where them young niggas die skinny  
Keep work on deck if you need any  
Just holler at them boys cause they keep plenty, follow me!  
Got the weight of the world on my shoulders  
And I swear it feels like ten thousand boulders  
And it's so heavy, but I'm so ready  
Feels like I was born for this  
If not, at least I'll die for it  
They said I couldn't do it but I'll still try for it  
The big question is what can I do for the youth?  
Everybody lyin to 'em so I told 'em the truth  
  
[Chorus]  
"I'm a hustler!" So, one man, one stage, one mic  
One song, one chance to get it right  
I really thank y'all, we gon' see the night  
And I think I know the way, follow me  
"I got hustle!" One man, one stage, one mic  
One song, one chance to get it right  
I really thank y'all, we gon' see the night  
And I think I know the way, follow me  
"I'm a hustler!"  
  
Real niggas don't die, they go to the Feds  
Fresh out, right back chasin' bread  
My life's so hard, so concrete  
I was raised by 'em homie, that's why I think so street  
Take me for instance  
My life is not about you, think me for instance  
I did the impossible, I made it out  
Got dealt a bad hand but I played it out  
I'm a left lane nigga, my life's so fast  
Now I'm thinking holmes, got my right blinker on  
Spread my word, got my Kirk Franklin on  
Stuntin' in traffic like "This my car"  
Sometimes I wonder how I made it this far  
Life's a bitch so I'm tryna wife her  
Just ball around, you know, buy her some things  
Lovin' every minute of it, still breakin' chains  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Y'all my brush, let me paint a perfect picture  
Gotta pay attention cause it's three dimensional  
Same picture, see it one of three ways  
Let it marinate, it might take a few days  
They say all I talk about is drugs and violence  
So I shouldn't say nothin' Get a moment of silence  
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense  
Words to live by, took it out of context  
They say your pass is your present and your present is your cash  
So I look forward to the future  
Get a lil' paper your baby momma won't have  
Part of the college so I need a forecast  
Where's the weatherman at when you need him?  
A hungry nigga eat anything you feed him  
A rich nigga will buy anything you sell him  
And a broke nigga believe anything you fuckin' tell him  
  
[Chorus]
