We were a blown out of wicked proportions  
An accidental company  
If we said, we're gonna go out and get all tore up tonight  
Then we did, we got a little happenin'  
Player tonight's the night's right  
And don't clear the place  
Sweep up a little on your way out  
You might make it  
With Dottie, the bluegrass singer  
Baring her local breast  
Singing, "You want an open concept  
I'll give you open concepts"  
You player 'Fuck-up nows' right  
And don't clear the place  
Wreak some havoc on the way out  
You might make it  
?Drink up folks it's getting on time to close?  
They said,"We don't even like you", "I'm with you", I said  
Perhaps you think the road is a means to an end  
Where it's a living in the end  
The living end, the living image of the end  
Player tonight's the night's right  
Don't clear the place  
Sweep up a little on your way out  
You might make it  
If your tonight's the night's right  
You don't clear the place  
Sweep up a little on your way out  
You might make it  
Tonight's the night  
Tonight's the night, tonight  
Tonight's the night, tonight  
Tonight, tonight, tonight  
Tonight's the night, tonight  
Tonight, tonight, tonight  
Tonight's the night, tonight  
Tonight, tonight, tonight
