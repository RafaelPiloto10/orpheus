You think I could be the one to look inside your mind  
I don't think we'll have the time, so let us get in line  
  
Another town another bed, another thing to go  
By now I learned to take it cool, but I don't want to know  
  
My head is empty, all the stories that I've known I've told  
The situation I escaped from, now it looks like gold  
  
Anyway and anyhow we did it, it was good  
But now I take the time to think 'bout ev'rything I should  
  
'Cause after this I'm gone, the show is done  
No other town or bed that lies ahead  
I'll go home to what I know  
I'll go home, home to you  
  
By the time that you think 'bout it twice no spotlight makes you stay  
By the time that you feel you don't know, you have to go  
  
The plane is ready in my head, so many things to do  
A few more hours till it's over I reach out for you  
  
A kind of peace inside is growing, thinking 'bout the shows  
Until the next time I'll be so much better, yes I know  
  
Now this is it I'm gone, the show is done  
No other town or bed that lies ahead  
I'll go home to what I know  
I'll go home, home to you  
  
I'll go home
