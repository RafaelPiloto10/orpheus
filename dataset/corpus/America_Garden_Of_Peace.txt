I look inside at the scarlet room  
Places to hide in the dusty gloom  
A noisy clock and a silver spoon  
A china cup on the mantlepiece  
Gathering dust as it did in the east  
And just outside lies the garden of peace  
Oh, tell me is this really true  
Can it be, peace has come to me and you  
Tell me over, over and over  
Tell me is this really happening  
Inside this world it's beautiful  
Peace in this garden has come true  
A mirror pond reflects the dawn  
Over the banks, 'cross the emerald lawn  
A breeze has come and I'm carried along  
So follow the path through the knowing trees  
And each time you laugh, it is love you release  
That love will come back in the garden of peace  
So, tell me is this really true  
Can it be, peace has come to me and you  
Tell me over, over and over  
Tell me is this really happening  
Inside this world it's beautiful  
Peace in the garden has come true  
Oh, tell me is this really true  
Can it be, peace has come to me and you  
Tell me over, over and over  
Tell me is this really happening  
Inside this world it's beautiful  
Peace in the garden has come true ...
