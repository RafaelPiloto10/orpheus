I know I let you tell me what to do  
You were confident you know best  
Now things aren't working like you want them to  
Your confidence is what I detest  
You got me lookin' up high  
You got me searchin' down low  
You got me I know you know  
You got me jerkin' back 'n' forth  
You told me people like to suffer  
You told me that's the way it is  
You said that things were getting better  
You said I should expect all this  
You think it's funny  
But what I say is true  
The reason that I live like this  
Is all because of you  
There is a thought that keeps me thinking  
Like a stone inside my shoe  
It is a vision reoccurring  
A dirty window I can see you through
