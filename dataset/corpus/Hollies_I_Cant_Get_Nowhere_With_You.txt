I can't get nowhere with  
I can't get nowhere with  
  
Talk to me  
Say things to me  
Make me understand you love me  
I can't get nowhere with you  
  
I'm saying  
You're playing  
With my feelings  
I'm just praying  
I can't get nowhere with you  
  
I put my trust in you  
But how you let me down  
I tried to treat you right  
But you made me look like a clown  
  
I'm showing  
That you're going  
Tears me up  
My tears are flowing  
I can't get nowhere with you  
  
[Verse 3]  
I'm showing  
That you're going  
Tears me up  
My tears are flowing  
I can't get nowhere with  
I can't get nowhere with  
I can't get nowhere with you
