[Intro:]  
(Dance Music Playing)  
  
You're looking through my face  
Why don't you notice me  
I'm hungry  
People are passing by  
Exchanging glances  
Promising more to  
  
Come in the nights to come  
You are my date but you don't know it  
Me and myself and I are going to get you  
Sooner or later  
  
Come to me, come to me  
Come give me all your colours  
I can see the shades of life  
With you I'm feeling free  
  
Come to me, come to me  
Come give me all your colours  
I can see the shades of life  
With you I'm feeling free  
  
I got a lot to give,  
And I'm gonna give a lot my baby  
I got a lot to give  
I'm giving you my love  
I'm giving you my love  
  
Standing here all alone  
Going through all our levels now  
I'm changing the highest one  
Commitments to follow  
  
Come to me, come to me  
Come give me all your colours  
I can see the shades of life  
With you I'm feeling free  
  
Come to me, come to me  
Come give me all your colours  
I can see the shades of life  
With you I'm feeling free  
  
I'm a stranger in the night  
Without you all alone  
I'm dancing with myself  
  
It's a long way yet to go  
I'm longing for your touch  
To hold you forever on  
And on and on and on  
  
Come come to me, come come to me  
I can see the shades of life  
With you I'm feeling free  
  
Come come to me, come come to me  
I can see the shades of life  
With you I'm feeling free  
  
Come to me, come to me  
Come give me all your colours  
I can see the shades of life  
With you I'm feeling free  
  
Come to me, come to me  
Come give me all your colours  
I can see the shades of life  
With you I'm feeling free
