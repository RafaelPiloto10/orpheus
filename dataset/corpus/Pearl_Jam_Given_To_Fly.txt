He could've tuned in tuned in  
But he tuned out  
A bad time nothing could save him  
Alone in a corridor waiting locked out  
He got up outta there ran for hundreds of miles  
He made it to the ocean had a smoke in a tree  
The wind rose up set him down on his knee  
  
A wave came crashing like a fist to the jaw  
Delivered him wings "Hey look at me now"  
Arms wide open with the sea as his floor  
Oh power oh  
  
He's flying  
Whole  
High wide, oh  
  
He floated back down 'cause he wanted to share  
His key to the locks on the chains he saw everywhere  
But first he was stripped and then he was stabbed  
By faceless men, well, fuckers  
He still stands  
  
And he still gives his love, he just gives it away  
The love he receives is the love that is saved  
And sometimes is seen a strange spot in the sky  
A human being that was given to fly  
  
High flying  
Oh, oh  
High flying  
Oh, oh  
He's flying  
Oh, oh
