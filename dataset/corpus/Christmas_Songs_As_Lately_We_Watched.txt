As lately we watch'd o'er our fields thro' the night,  
A star there was seen of such glorious light.  
All thro' the night, angels did sing  
Carols so sweet of the birth of a King.  
  
A King of such beauty was ne'er before seen,  
And Mary His mother so like a queen.  
Blessed be the hour, welcome the morn,  
For Christ our dear Saviour on earth now is born.  
  
His throne is a manger, His court is a loft,  
But troops of bright angels, in lays sweet and soft,  
Him they proclaim, our Christ by name,  
And earth, sky and air straight are filled with his fame.  
  
Then shepherds, be joyful
