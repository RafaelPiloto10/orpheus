It's like a normal Times Square day on 42nd Street  
I feel like trashing some windows and crunching some feet  
I watch society crumble and I just laugh (hee hee)  
They soon will see what it's like to be the other half  
  
But I'm trying  
Said I'm trying to forget  
And it ain't happened yet  
I must of woke up this morning with a bug up my ass  
  
I think I'll just haul off and belt the next jerk that I pass  
My old man says I'm just a stoned little punk  
But he keeps himself a pistol and he's always drunk  
I know  
  
Something's gonna give  
Pretty soon  
I know it  
Something's gonna give  
  
I want to live  
I want to mess thing whole world around  
Go on and poison all the water, use up all the air  
Blow your stupid heads off, see if I could care  
  
Put me down but don't blame me for what you did  
'Cause inside everyone is a heavy metal kid  
I was a sweet little kid once  
Now I'm a full grown crank  
  
And when I die I'll probably come back as a Sherman tank  
I know that I could make this world so peaceful and calm  
If I could only get my hands on a hydrogen bomb
