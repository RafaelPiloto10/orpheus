Tiny bones and skin, sand on your feet  
These healthy children are fruits of the tree  
Turquoise flotation on the Indian Sea  
We can float together, you and me now  
And we love you it's a beautiful day  
Thank you for the journey to this new day where we've been  
Gifted this island we've been gifted this day  
And we're all here together on this beautiful day  
Feel a daddy is taking his steps 1, 2, 3  
While the other one keeps on amazing us by what he can see  
To you're through broken shells a white moth comes  
She gives herself to him 'cause he keeps you strong  
And we love you it's a beautiful day  
Thank you for the journey to this new day where we've been  
Gifted this island we've been gifted this day  
And we're all here together on this beautiful day  
And we love you it's a beautiful day  
And we're all here together on this beautiful day  
Well we love you it's a beautiful day  
And we're all here together on this beautiful day
