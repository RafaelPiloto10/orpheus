Please stay with me now  
Don't you let me go  
I'll make it somehow  
I got to let you know  
That I'll make it  
Somehow, some way  
Though I wait on the day  
What I'm doing's gotta pay  
Some way, somehow  
  
My baby, when he cries  
It's 'cause something's on his mind  
This world is full of lies  
You and me are one of a kind  
The good lord will stand behind every step  
We are blind to fate, that's life, that's life  
  
Stay, stay, stay, stay (won't you please)  
Stay, stay, stay, stay  
  
It fits, but you can't make it work  
Where there's pain, there's got to be hurt  
And the green grass grows from the dirt  
Yeah, that's a fact of life alright  
The good lord stands behind every step  
We are blind to fate, that's life, that's life  
  
Stay, oh won't you please  
Stay, stay (won't you)  
Stay, stay, stay, stay  
Stay, stay, stay, stay  
  
Stay, stay (right here)  
Stay, stay (don't you go, no no)  
Stay, stay (oh no no)  
Stay, stay (stay baby baby please stay)  
Stay, stay (right here, right here, right here)  
Stay, stay (i want you to stay right here)  
Stay, stay (we can stay here, together, together yeah)  
Stay, stay (don't listen to what people say)  
Stay, stay (stay, stay, listen now yeah)  
Stay, stay (stay, yeah yeah now)
