Over time, I've been building  
My castle of love  
Just for two, though you never  
Knew you were my reason  
I've gone much too far  
For you now to say  
That I've got to throw my castle away  
  
Over dreams, I have picked out  
A perfect come true  
Though you never knew it was  
Of you I've been dreaming  
The sandman has come from too far away  
For you to say come back some other day  
  
And though you don't believe that they do  
They do come true  
For did my dreams  
Come true when I looked at you  
And maybe too, if you would believe  
You too might be  
Overjoyed, over love, over me  
  
Over heart, I have painfully  
Turned every stone  
Just to find, I had found what  
I've searched to discover  
I've come much too far for me now to find  
The love that I sought can never be mine  
  
And though you don't believe that they do  
They do come true  
For did my dreams  
Come true when I looked at you  
And maybe too, if you would believe  
You too might be  
Overjoyed, over love, over me  
  
And though the odds say improbable  
What do they know  
For in romance  
All true love needs is a chance  
And maybe with a chance you will find  
You too like I  
Overjoyed, over love, over you,  
Over you
