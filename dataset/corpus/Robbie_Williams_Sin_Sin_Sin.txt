Don't let your eyes tell the brain  
You should feel ashamed  
Everyone needs it, baby  
And I feel the same  
Didn't quite catch your name  
  
Hush, hush, hush  
Don't say a thing  
Let's see what the night will bring  
It might be everything  
  
Oh it hurts  
When you're too blind to see  
Please don't read my mind  
I tell the truth to me  
  
Sin sin sin  
Look where we've been  
And where we are tonight  
Hate the sin, not the sinner, I'm just after a glimmer  
Of love  
And light  
Deep inside  
  
Ooh ooh  
  
Hush, hush hush  
To speak is a sin  
And neither of us need rescuing  
  
Just relax, it's what Jesus would do  
We're made in his image, baby  
Let's rock this thing through  
  
Oh, it hurts  
When you're too blind to see  
What about us  
Well it was just for me  
  
Sin sin sin  
Look where we've been  
And where we are tonight  
Hate the sin, not the sinner, I'm just after a glimmer  
Of love  
And light  
Deep inside  
  
Oooh ooh  
  
I won't sing of amore  
It don't sound sincere  
Love is a cliche  
But it fits not here  
I'll disappear  
  
Sin sin sin  
Look where we've been  
And where we are tonight  
Hate the sin, not the sinner, I'm just after a glimmer  
Of love  
And light  
Deep inside  
Deep inside  
  
It's love  
Clean sex joy  
I love you  
You love my  
Hate how it it feels inside  
Feels inside  
Feels inside  
Deep inside
