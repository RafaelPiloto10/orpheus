Their eyes are down and the track looks slow  
It don't look like a good thing  
Your horse could jump it when the pack runs wild  
It don't look like a sure thing  
You must be crazy  
To gamble this way  
The kids are crying  
And your bills ain't paid  
Gamblin' man, ramblin' fool  
I must be crazy to gamble on you  
The deal is done so you slip right in  
You got the depth but you can't win  
The cards are cold and the cut feels thin  
You got the deck but you can't win  
You must be crazy  
To gamble this way  
The kids are hungry  
And your brain ain't paid  
Gamblin' man, ramblin' fool  
I must be crazy to gamble on you  
Gamblin' man, you're a ramblin' fool  
I must be crazy to gamble on you
