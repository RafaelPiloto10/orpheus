Oh  
Tonight I'm gonna show  
Them what I'm made up for  
The killer queen inside me's  
Coming out  
Say, "Hello!"  
  
Oh  
Tonight I will return  
The fame and riches earned  
With you I'd watch them all be burnt  
Whoa-Oh, Whoa-Oh  
  
Whenever I start feeling strong  
I'm called a bitch in the night  
But I don't need these 14-carat golds to win  
I am a woman, I insist it's my life  
  
[Chorus]  
I can be  
The queen that's inside of me  
This is my chance to release it  
Be brave for you you'll see  
I can be  
The queen you need me to be  
This is my chance to be the dance  
Our dream is happening  
I can be the queen  
  
I  
Wind and hurricane  
The stormy sky and rain  
When you run dry I'll flood your pain  
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh  
  
In between the moments of  
The lady I've become  
A voice speaks through the noise like drums  
Rhomp-a-bump-a  
  
Whenever I start feeling strong  
I'm called a bitch in the night  
But I don't need these 14-carat golds to win  
I am a woman, I insist it's my life  
  
I can be  
The queen that's inside of me  
This is my chance to release it  
Be brave for you you'll see  
I can be  
The queen you need me to be  
This is my chance to be the dance  
Our dream is happening  
I can be the queen  
  
The quee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-een  
The que-ee-een  
Quee-ee-een  
Quee-ee-een  
  
Starry night come inside me like never before  
Don't forget me when I come crying to heaven's door  
I will fly on a challenger across the sky  
Like a phoenix so you can remind them of the dream I bore  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Whoa, oh, oh  
Whoa-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Whoa-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh
