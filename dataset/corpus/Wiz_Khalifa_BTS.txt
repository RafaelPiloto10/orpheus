[Intro]  
My momma ain't raise no fool nigga  
Matter of fact, maybe she did  
My momma raised a fool (haha)  
But that don't mean we can't get rich  
Too rich (too rich)  
That's what they say  
  
[Verse 1]  
Humble beginnings, rich ass endings  
Pockets on swole, big ass benjies  
Started off losin', man it wasn't choosin'  
Stuck with my nigga's, now we all winnin'  
Rollin' up paper, ball like a Laker  
Top on the building, I'm high as a 'scraper  
What can I say now, cops know my name now  
No time to play 'round, I'm rich and I'm paid now  
Stay on that piece for shit for nigga's that spray rounds  
Hear all the talk, they gon' come see you any day now  
Try not to fade now, try to find a way out  
Nobodies innocent nigga, get down or lay down  
Made so much money but look how I'd paid out  
Don't trust the bank no more so I went and got a safe in my house  
Guess all these diamonds on my wrist, what you blinkin' about  
It's all my money on my mind when I'm thinkin' about  
  
[Hook]  
Try to be the best that I can  
They got the right decisions, handle it like a man  
You know I try to do shit with my heart  
They talk but I don't listen  
I just finish what I start  
You know I tried the nigga's that said I can't  
They got the right decisions, handle business like a man  
You know I try when people say I should change  
Sometimes I'm done with trying, I'm just trying to be the same  
  
[Verse 2]  
Nigga's still hating, critics still waiting  
Said that I'd change my ways and start catching these cases  
But never said I'd stop counting these faces  
Flyin' new places, buying them cases  
Nigga's want problems, I don't entertain it  
Cause if it's real problems, It's not entertainment  
I'm rollin' a joint up, precise like a painter  
The grind is what made us, the grind is what made us  
Now the nigga's that I grew up with lookin' richer  
Too much turnin' up, the club owners tryin' to censor  
Tatted everywhere my full body full of scriptures  
Pull up in the phantom, paparazzi takin' pictures  
Sellin' so much swag, we should be your swag vender  
Big winner in the club, big cash spender  
Throwin' signs to my man like he a damn pitcher  
Some shit you can't witness, my nigga we been business  
  
[Hook]  
Try to be the best that I can  
They got the right decisions, handle business like a man  
You know I try to do shit with my heart  
They talk but I don't listen  
I just finish what I start  
You know I tried the nigga's that said I can't  
They got the right decisions, handle business like a man  
You know I try when people say I should change  
Sometimes I'm done with trying, I'm just trying to be the same
