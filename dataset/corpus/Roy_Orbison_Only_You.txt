Only you can make, oh, this world seem right  
Only you can make the darkness bright  
Only you and you alone can thrill me like you do  
And fill my heart with love for only you.  
  
Only you can make, oh, this change on me  
Oh it's true you are my destiny  
When you hold my hand I understand the magic that you do  
You're my dream come true, my one and only you  
  
Only you can make, oh, this change on me  
Oh it's true you are my destiny  
When you hold my hand I understand the magic that you do  
You're my dream come true, my one and only you
