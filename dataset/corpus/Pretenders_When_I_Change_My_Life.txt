When I change my life  
There'll be no more disgrace  
The deeds of my past  
Will be erased  
  
And you'll forgive me  
Then you will come back  
Hold my hand and say "I still love you"  
When I change my life  
  
When I change my life  
And all the scars have faded  
I'll be someone you look up to  
Not excused when your friends come around  
  
And you'll want me always to be there  
You'll be proud to say "I'm with her"  
When I change my life  
  
I want a place in the sun - I do  
I want to be in love with someone  
I want to forget every regret  
And all those rotten things that I put you through  
  
When I change my life  
And the idiot me  
Leaves this town forever  
Leaves us to be  
Together - for the rest of our lives  
Happily forever and ever  
When I change my life
