They got nothing on me  
Anymore  
They got nothing on you  
I don't care  
What they say anymore  
All I want is the truth  
  
I don't feel  
To unveil  
In my soul  
Singled out  
  
They got nothing on me  
Anymore  
They got nothing on you  
I don't care  
What they say anymore  
All I want is the truth  
  
I don't feel  
To unveil  
Hear my sound  
Singled out  
Watch my style  
Pick a place  
Wipe the smile  
From your face  
  
I feel no way  
To unveil  
In my soul  
Singled out  
Watch my style  
Pick a place  
Wipe the smile  
From your face  
  
Hey-e  
Yeah-e-ey  
  
They got nothing on me  
Anymore  
They got nothing on you  
I don't care  
What they say anymore  
All I want is the truth
