Are we all we are  
Are we all we are  
  
Cut to now, holy wow  
When did everything become such a hell of a mess  
Maybe now maybe now can somebody come and take this off my chest  
  
I know you think it's not your problem  
I know you think that god will solve them  
But if your sh-t is not together  
It'll never be you and me, plant the seed  
Open up and let it be  
  
We are the people that you'll never get the best of  
Not forget the rest of, rest of  
We've got it all, we've had enough, we've had it up here  
Are we all we are  
Are we all we are  
  
We are the people that you'll never get the best of  
Not forget the rest of, rest of  
Just say it loud, until the kids are singing right back  
Are we all we are  
Are we all we are  
  
Are we all we are  
Are we all we are  
  
Seven seconds, seven seconds  
That is all the time you got to make your point  
  
My attention, my attention's like an infant trying to crawl across the joint  
I know we're better than the masses  
But we follow with our asses  
And if our shit is not together  
It'll never be you and me, plant the seed  
Open and let it be  
  
We are the people that you'll never get the best of  
Not forget the rest of, rest of  
We've got it all, we've had enough, we've had it up here  
Are we all we are  
Are we all we are  
  
We are the people that you'll never get the best of  
Not forget the rest of, rest of  
Just say it loud, until the kids are singing right back  
Are we all we are  
Are we all we are  
  
Are we all we are  
Are we all we are  
  
Four, that's how many years it took me to get through the lesson that I had to
do it all on my own  
Three, that's how many hail mary's they would pray for me thinking I was gonna
end up all alone  
Two for the second changes that you've given me, can it be?  
Lucky me lucky me, now let's go  
One is what we are, is what we are  
Are we all we are  
Are we all we are  
  
We are the people that you'll never get the best of  
Not forget the rest of, rest of  
We've got it all, we've had enough, we've had it up here  
Are we all we are  
Are we all we are  
  
We are the people that you'll never get the best of  
Not forget the rest of, rest of  
Just say it loud, until the kids are singing right back  
Are we all we are  
Are we all we are  
  
Are we all we are  
Are we all we are  
  
We are the people that you'll never get the best of  
Not forget the rest of, rest of  
Look to the future, sing it loud, and take the power back  
Are we all we are  
Are we all we are
