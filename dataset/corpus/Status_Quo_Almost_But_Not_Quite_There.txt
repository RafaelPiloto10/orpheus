I want to have you here with me  
To cuddle up so near to me  
And do the things you like me to do to you  
You like it when I tickle you  
We start to kiss, it pleased you  
It gets so hot, I just don't know what to do  
  
To take you when you're feeling good  
To love you like I know I should  
It makes me feel all of ten feet tall  
  
So I just try to give to you  
All that I can to satisfy you  
I don't like to leave you girl  
Almost but not quite there  
  
So I just try to give to you  
All that I can to satisfy you  
I don't like to leave you girl  
Almost but not quite there  
  
Now when I finally get to you  
I'm gonna put my love to you  
And then I'll see just how good you are  
So I've got to have you here with me  
To cuddle up so near to me  
And do the things you like me to do to you  
  
So I just try to give to you  
All that I can to satisfy you  
I don't like to leave you girl  
Almost but not quite there
