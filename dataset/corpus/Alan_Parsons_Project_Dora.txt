Dora, in the middle of the night  
Will you wait for me  
Till the morning sun shine bright  
For it's all a dream  
And it's only make believe  
  
Dora, oh it hurts to hear you say  
You're all alone  
And the pain won't go away  
But it's all a dream  
And it's only make believe  
  
Listening through the hours of the day  
Waiting for the night to end  
Thinking, though it's not for me to say  
When will I see you again  
When will I see you again  
  
Forget the lies they whisper in your ear  
And every superstitious word you hear  
Dora, though the truth is hard to face  
And the fantasy  
Is not easy to replace  
It's all a dream  
And it's only make believe  
  
Oh, I keep thinking  
Of the words I shouldn't say  
When will I see you again  
When will I see you again  
  
And every doubt they whisper in your ear  
And all the half-forgotten past you fear  
One day will fade away and disappear  
  
Dora, in the middle of the night  
Do you wait for me  
Where the morning sun shine bright  
Is it all a dream  
Is it only make believe  
  
Is it all a thread  
Of the tangled web you weave  
Is it all a dream  
Is it only make believe
