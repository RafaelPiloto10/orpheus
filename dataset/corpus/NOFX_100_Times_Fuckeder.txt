Fighting with gloves  
Now we're the ones a hundred times fuckeder  
Hitting above the belt  
Now we're the ones a hundred times fuckeder  
Citing the facts  
Now we're the ones a hundred times fuckeder  
Exposing all the lies  
Now we're the ones a hundred times fuckeder  
we get what we fucking deserve  
Bringing raised fists to a knife fight  
You'd think developed minds could learn  
Not to give benefit of doubt  
You wouldn't trust a hungry animal  
Around your newborn, would you?  
sharing the wealth  
Now we're the ones a hundred times fuckeder  
Taking the high road  
Now we're the ones a hundred times fuckeder  
Showing respect  
Now we're the ones a hundred times fuckeder  
Giving a shit  
Now we're the ones a hundred times fuckeder  
did anyone really expect  
To win a race already fixed  
The spoils doled out in advance  
The appointed already picked  
All allegations of fraud  
Categorically dismissed as absurd
