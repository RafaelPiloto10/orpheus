I loved ya' baby,  
From the start.  
Loved ya' baby,  
Baby, with all of my heart.  
I need ya' baby,  
Can't ya' see.  
I love that little girl,  
Lord, you put a spell on me.  
  
I just want to testify,  
That I can't get by without your love.  
  
I told ya' baby,  
I's gonna' love you.  
I said it girl,  
Now that's what I'm gonna' do.  
Turn down the lights,  
I'm gonna' show ya how.  
Turn down your lights little mama,  
'cause I'm gonna show ya how, right now.  
  
I just want to testify,  
That I can't get by without your love.  
  
Ohhh, baby.  
I said baby, baby.  
Would you do the same,  
Hey, baby, if I treat you right?  
I don't mean maybe,  
When I tell you baby,  
If you're after me,  
I'm givin' up without a fight.  
  
I just want to testify,  
That I can't get by without your love.  
No, no, no, no, no, no.  
I just want to testify,  
That I can't get by without your love.  
  
Ohhh, baby.  
I said baby, baby.  
I just want to testify,  
That I can't get by without your love, baby.  
  
Oh I, I just want to testify,  
I just want to testify,  
That I can't get by without your love.
