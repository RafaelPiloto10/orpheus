(You gotta wake up)  
You don't commit to me  
You won't make a start  
You don't tell me no  
You haven't got the heart  
You sit in a chair  
Or you lie in bed  
With a faraway stare  
And a swollen head  
  
Well, listen here my lover  
I have had enough  
And I can tell you brother  
I could fall in love  
With someone who  
Looks a lot like you  
But gets up and does  
What he's thinking of  
  
I can't wait another day  
I can give and I can take  
There's a choice you have to make  
  
So many times things pass you by  
Imagination running wild  
You've got to start choosing right from wrong  
Instead of daydreaming all day long  
  
I want to catch a plane  
To an open space  
I want to feel the sun  
Shining on my face  
But time is short  
And waiting is long  
And my patience is exhausted  
I'm just not that strong  
  
I want to see the parade  
You want to watch TV  
So we don't do either  
It's insanity  
You say there's plenty of time  
And life is good  
So you never make your mind up  
Well you never could  
  
I can ask you when or why  
And you'll look up to the sky  
The parade is marching by  
  
So many times things pass you by  
Imagination running wild  
You've got to start choosing right from wrong  
Instead of daydreaming all day long  
Daydreaming, oh, oh, daydreaming, daydreaming  
  
You gotta wake up, you gotta wake up  
(Leave me alone I'm only dreaming)  
You gotta wake up, you gotta wake up  
(Leave me alone I'm only dreaming)  
You gotta wake up, you gotta wake up  
(I'm only dreaming), oh, oh  
  
I can't wait another day  
I can give and I can take  
There's a choice you have to make, oh, oh  
  
So many times things pass you by  
Imagination running wild  
You've got to start choosing right from wrong  
Instead of daydreaming all day long  
  
So many times things pass you by  
Imagination running wild  
You've gotta choose right from wrong  
Instead of daydreaming all night long  
  
(Daydreaming)  
So many times  
(Daydreaming)  
Things pass you by  
(Daydreaming)  
You've gotta choose right from wrong  
(Daydreaming)  
All day long  
All day long
