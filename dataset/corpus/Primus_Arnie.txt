The man he stepped up to the microphone and he gave it a kiss.  
It was a big wet, slippery kiss.  
And he had sweat dripping off of his nose onto the windscreen.  
As he looked out over the audience he said,  
God bless you, God bless you one and all.  
Then he took a can of Ronson lighter fluid  
And he squirted it over the top of his head.  
And proceeded to light himself on fire  
As he stood there glowing and said,  
Remember this day.
