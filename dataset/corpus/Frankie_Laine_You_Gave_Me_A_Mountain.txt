Born in the heat of the desert  
My mother died giving me life  
Deprived of the love of a father  
Blamed for the loss of his wife  
  
You know, Lord, I've been in a prison  
For something that I've never done  
It's been one hill after another  
But I've climbed them all, one by one  
  
But this time, Lord, you gave me a mountain  
A mountain I may never climb  
And is isn't a hill any longer  
You gave me a mountain this time  
  
My woman tired of the hardships  
Tired of the grief and the strife  
So tired of working for nothing  
Tired of being my wife  
  
She took my one ray of sunshine  
She took my pride and my joy  
She took my reason for living  
She took my small baby boy  
  
So this time, Lord, you gave me a mountain  
A mountain I may never climb  
And is isn't a hill any longer  
You gave me a mountain this time
