Oh there's nothin' like a woman  
When you're all alone  
No there's nothin' like a woman  
To make a man come home  
She's always there to understand  
The little boy inside of the man  
Oh there's nothin' like a woman  
Nothin' at all  
  
She knows when to hold you  
And when to leave you alone  
She's there to console you  
When everything in the world's gone wrong  
She lights a candle  
And gets that look in her eye  
And she's says boy you can handle  
Staying up with me all night  
  
Oh there's nothin' like a woman  
When you're all alone No there's nothin' like her lovin'  
To make a man come home  
She's always there to understand  
The little boy inside of the man  
No there's nothin' like a woman  
Nothin' at all  
  
No there's nothin' like a woman  
When you're all alone  
No there's nothin' like a woman  
To make a man come home  
She's always there to understand  
The little boy inside of the man  
No there's nothin' like a woman  
Nothin' at all
