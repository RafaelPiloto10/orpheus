I'm standing on your doorstep  
And I don't know what to do  
Should I ring your doorbell or just walk away  
My friends all say that you were never true  
I'm hiding in the shadows  
  
I hear the music coming out of your radio  
Are you there with another guy instead of me  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
I hear the laughter and there's something I've got to know  
Are you there with another guy instead of me  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
  
I only know I love you and I couldn't say goodbye  
So if there's another, I don't want to know  
If you should go, I would surely die  
I'm hiding in the shadows  
  
And I see two silhouettes in back of your window shade  
Are you there with another guy when I am gone  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
I can't believe you'd break the promises that you made  
If you're there with another guy, I can't go on, oh no  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
  
You would never leave me, hurt me or deceive me  
I'm a fool to doubt you, worry so about you  
Love requires faith, I've got a lot of faith but  
(I hear the music coming out of your radio)  
  
I only know I love you, and I couldn't say goodbye  
So if there's another, I don't want to know  
If you should go, I would surely die  
I'm hiding in the shadows  
  
Yeah, (In the shadows)  
Really plotting, hiding in the shadows  
I'm hiding in the shadows, yeah  
  
(Umm pah pah, pity the girl)  
Pity, pity  
(Umm pah pah, pity the girl)  
Umm pah pitty  
(Umm pah pah, pity the girl)  
Umm pah pah, pity pity  
(Umm pah pah, pity the girl)  
  
I hear the music coming out of your radio  
Are you there with another guy instead of me  
Oh no, don't tell me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
No I can't believe it  
I hear your laughter and there's something I've got to know  
Are you there with another guy instead of me  
Please don't say (Yeah, yeah yeah)  
(It's a pity)  
  
I hear the music coming out of your radio  
(Umm pah pah, pity the girl)  
(Umm pah pah, pity the girl)  
(Umm pah pah, pity the girl)  
  
No, I can't believe it  
I hear the laughter and there's something I got to know  
(Umm pah pah, pity the girl)  
(Umm pah pah, pity the girl)  
(Umm pah pah, pity the girl)  
  
Yeah baby  
Without my love, I pity the girl  
(Umm pah pah, pity the girl)  
(Umm pah pah, pity the girl)  
Your radio  
(Umm pah pah, pity the girl)  
Oh yeah, yeah  
Umm pah pah, pity the girl  
(Umm pah pah, pity the girl)  
(Umm pah pah, pity the girl)
