You were a child reaching out brave and true  
For big thins in the next room  
And I couldn't step into such open sky  
Where on the crest of uncertainty you loom  
I'm learning to hunt for you  
Say that you'll never run too far away  
Even with all the answers out there  
Where it's brighter but no one will care  
Half as much as I care about you  
I'm learning to hunt for you  
(back inside ordinary)
