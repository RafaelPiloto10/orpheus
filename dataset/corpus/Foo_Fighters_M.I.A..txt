Call and I'll answer  
At home in the lost and found  
You say that I'm much too proud  
Someone who's taken pleasure  
In breaking down  
  
Never mind the mannequins  
Drunk in their hollow town  
Drinking their spoils down  
Cheap imitations  
A revelation is now  
  
Yeah, you won't find me  
I'm going M.I.A.  
Tonight I'm leaving  
Going M.I.A.  
Getting lost in you again  
Is better than being numb  
  
Counting every minute  
Till the feeling comes crashing down  
Run when it hits the ground  
I'm good at escaping,  
But better at flaking out  
  
Calling unanswered  
The center becomes blown out  
Stuck on the inside now  
It's fear I'm embracing  
I never could face you down  
  
Yeah, you won't find me  
I'm going M.I.A.  
Tonight I'm leaving  
Going M.I.A.  
Getting lost in you again  
Is better than being numb  
  
Red, red, laced around your head  
Cold and rescued  
  
Call and I'll answer  
At home in the lost and found  
You say that I'm much too proud  
Someone who's taken pleasure  
In breaking down  
  
Never mind the mannequins  
Drunk in their hollow town  
Drinking their spoils down  
Cheap imitations  
A revelation is now  
  
Yeah, you won't find me  
I'm going M.I.A.  
Tonight I'm leaving  
Going M.I.A.  
So you don't find me  
I'm going M.I.A.  
Tonight I'm leaving  
Going M.I.A.  
Say goodbye to me  
I'm going M.I.A.  
I can find relief  
I'm going M.I.A.  
Getting lost in you again  
Is better than being numb  
  
Better than playing dumb
