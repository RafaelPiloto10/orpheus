Like the fly on the wheel who says  
'What a lot of dust we're raising'  
Are you under the illusion  
That you're part of this scheme?  
Seems like a lifetime ago  
You could look with pride  
On your world of dreams  
What is the meaning of this?  
And the stars look down  
What are you trying to do?  
And the stars look down  
Was it something I said  
And the stars look down  
Like the rat in a maze who says  
'Watch me choose my own direction'  
Are you under the illusion  
The path is winding your way?  
Are you surprised by confusion  
When it leads you astray?  
Have you lived a lifetime today...  
Or do you feel like you just got carried away?  
What is the meaning of this?  
And the stars look down  
What are you trying to do?  
And the stars look down  
Was it something I said?  
And the stars look down  
Something you'd like me to do?  
And the stars look down
