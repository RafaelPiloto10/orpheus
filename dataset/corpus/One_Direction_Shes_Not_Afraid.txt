She sneaks out in the middle of the night, yeah  
Tight dress with the top cut low  
She's addicted to feeling of letting go, oh, ohoo, let it go  
  
She walks in and the room just lights up  
But she don't want anyone to know  
That I'm the only one who gets to take her home, oh, ohoo  
Take her home  
  
But everytime I tell her that I want more  
She closes the door  
  
She's not afraid of all the attention  
She's not afraid of running wild  
How come she's so afraid of falling in love  
She's not afraid of scary movies  
She likes the way we kiss in the dark  
But she's so afraid of f-f-falling in love  
Ohoo  
  
Maybe she's just trying to test me  
Wanna see how hard I'm gonna work  
Wanna see if I can really tell how much she's worth  
What your worth  
  
Or maybe all her friends have told her  
Don't' get closer he'll just break your heart  
  
But either way she's teasing me  
And it's just so hard (So hard)  
  
'Cause every time I tell her how I feel  
She says it's not real  
  
She's not afraid of all the attention  
She's not afraid of running wild  
How come she's so afraid of falling in love  
She's not afraid of scary movies  
She likes the way we kiss in the dark  
But she's so afraid of f-f-falling in love  
Ohoo  
  
What about all the things we said?  
Talking on the phone so late  
I can't let her get away from me (Ohh)  
  
When I say that I can't do it no more  
She's back in my door  
  
She's not afraid of all the attention  
She's not afraid of running wild  
How come she's so afraid of falling in love  
She's not afraid of scary movies  
She likes the way we kiss in the dark  
But she's so afraid of f-f-falling in love (Ohoo, ohoo)  
She's not afraid  
She's not afraid (Ohoo, ohoo)
