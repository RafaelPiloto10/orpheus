Well, I woke up this morning,  
And the night had been so long  
Seems that I had had my mind on you  
Well, the day it has begun  
And I can't get a minute  
Can't get a minute without you  
You're always on my mind  
You're always in my head  
And I can't live  
I can't live another day without you  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause when the minutes seem like hours and the hours seem like days  
Then a week goes by--you know it takes my breath away  
All the minutes in the world could never take your place  
There's one-thousand-four-hundred-forty hours in my day  
  
I've been trying to call you all day  
'Cause I got so many things that I want to say  
I'm going crazy 'cause all my thoughts are filled with you  
There's got to be some way I can get through to you, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can't keep myself from thinking about you  
It's because I love you, and I know that it's true, whoa  
I'll call it desperation  
Can't you see it in my eyes  
That I want be with you until the sun falls from the sky?  
  
[Chorus: x2]
