Sometimes I can't move my feet it seems  
As if I'm stuck in the ground somehow like a tree  
As if I can't even breathe  
And my screams come whispering out  
As if nobody can even see me  
Like a ghost  
I can't see myself sometimes  
  
Then again if I were a king  
If I had everything  
If I had you  
And I could give you your dreams  
If I were giant size  
On top of it all  
Tell me what in the world would I sing for  
If I had it  
  
Sometimes I feel lost  
As I pull you out like strings of memories  
Wish I could weave them into you  
And I could figure the whole damn puzzle out  
  
But then again if I were a king  
If I had everything  
If I had you  
And I could give you your dreams  
If I were giant size  
On top of it all  
Tell me then what I would sing for  
If I had it all  
  
Oh  
I could take anything  
If I had no greed to big  
Just poison tainting the green  
  
Remembering time  
Much younger than me now  
When my breath was light  
When the world raised me kind  
Here the mother comforts child  
Every moment was waking up  
But now I have grown tired  
  
If I had it all  
Oh I'd fuck it up sure  
  
If I were a king  
If I had everything  
If I had you  
And I could give you your dreams  
If I were giant size  
On top of it all  
Tell me what in the world would I sing for  
  
If I were a king  
If I had everything  
Piece by piece  
If had you  
If I could give you your dreams  
If I were giant size  
On top of it all  
Then why in the world would I sing  
If I had it all
