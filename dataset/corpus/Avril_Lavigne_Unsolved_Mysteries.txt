Am I dreaming?  
Or Stupid?  
I think I've been hit by cupid  
No one needs to know  
Right now.

I met a tall, dark and handsome man  
And I've been busy making big plans  
No one needs to know  
Right now.  
I got my heart set  
My feet wet  
But he don't even know it yet  
No one needs to know  
Right now.  
  
I'll tell him someday, someway, somehow  
But I'm gonna keep it a secret for now  
  
I want bells to ring  
The choir to sing  
A white dress that gets to keep the kinda hold on thing  
But no one needs to know  
Right now.  
  
I'll tell him, someday, someway, someway  
But I'm gonna keep it a secret for now.  
  
Gonna have a little girl  
A little boy  
A little engy we call Leroy  
But no one needs to know  
Right now.  
  
And I'm not lo-ohnly anymore at night  
And he don't kno-oh-only he can make it right  
And I'm not lo-ohnly anymore at night  
And he don't kno-oh-only he can make it right  
  
Am I dreaming?  
Or Stupid?  
But boy have I been hit by cupid.  
No one needs to know  
Right now.  
No one needs to know  
Right now  
No one needs to know right now
