You got me feeling so alive  
We better slow down  
It's like I'm on a roller coaster ride  
And I'm screaming so loud  
  
I got you so hungry for my love  
From the walls right down to the floor  
An animal let me hear you roar  
I'll take you to the heaven right before  
  
We turn the lights down  
Low low low low  
  
  
We turn the lights down  
Low low low low  
  
We turn the lights down  
Low low low low  
  
We turn the lights down  
Low low low low  
  
Love it how you touch me  
You're reading my mind  
Close my eyes, I need to see  
I feel you inside  
  
I got you so hungry for my love  
From the walls right down to the floor  
An animal let me hear you roar  
I'll take you to the heaven right before  
  
We turn the lights down  
Low low low low  
  
We turn the lights down  
Low low low low  
  
We turn the lights down  
Low low low low  
  
We turn the lights down  
Low low low low
