I'm going downstairs to be a poet  
Got a great idea: gonna write a sonnet  
A verse or two of fearless prose  
A priceless quip to gild the rose  
I'll make my fortune overnight  
My work will set the world alight  
Just a line is all I need  
Just a thought to sow the seed  
Just a word to start me out.  
The rest will come without a doubt  
I'm going downstairs to write a book  
Got a great idea's gonna really cook  
A rattling good yarn with an ironic twist  
A riveting ending that's not to be missed  
Makesure the presses are ready to steam  
This book is a scorcher, a publisher's dream  
Just the first part's all I need  
The rest will come with lightning speed  
Just a line to set the stage.  
My pen will dance across the page  
I'm going downstairs to write a play  
Got a great idea gonna make it pay  
This serious drama won't be understood  
The critics will love it and say that it's good  
"at last a new writer, a true nouvelle vague"  
In no time at all I'll be king of the stage  
Just a story's all I need.  
Just a thought to sow the seed  
Just a line to start me out .  
The rest will come without a doubt
