Eh-oh oh oh, eh-oh oh oh  
  
I'm underneath it all tonight  
Out my window there's a million lights  
Thousand hearts feeling just like me  
Man, it feels like Heaven out here in the street  
I know I got a lot to learn  
Breaking bottles only left me hurt  
Play with fire 'til I burn myself  
Don't you know that love will bring us somewhere else?  
  
So you take the left, I'll take the right  
Under arrest, we're under fire  
Oh oh oh oh  
I don't wanna go to Heaven if I can't get in  
You take the low, I'll take the high  
You lock the gate, I hear the quiet  
Everybody got a problem with the way I live  
I don't wanna go to Heaven if I can't get in  
  
Maybe I should take my time  
And build this life by my own design  
With no direction that is in between  
Everything I love and everything I need  
So bring it back, all I want is understanding  
To live my life the way that I planned it  
Wouldn't change a thing  
Man, it feels like Heaven underneath my feet  
  
So you take the left, I'll take the right  
Under arrest, we're under fire  
Oh oh oh oh  
I don't wanna go to Heaven if I can't get in  
You take the low, I'll take the high  
You lock the gate, I hear the quiet  
Everybody got a problem with the way I live  
I don't wanna go to Heaven if I can't get in  
  
So raise 'em up, raise 'em up  
All I ever wanted was a shot at your love  
I know, and I believe  
Everything we got is everything we need  
Oh, love will get you higher  
I set my heart on fire  
I know, it's what you see  
Don't wanna go to Heaven if they don't want me  
  
'Cause I'm no criminal  
I'm not your enemy  
All I have is life  
And I don't wanna go to Heaven if I can't get in  
  
So you take the left, I'll take the right  
Under arrest, we're under fire  
Oh oh oh oh  
I don't wanna go to Heaven if I can't get in  
You take the low, I'll take the high  
You lock the gate, I hear the quiet  
Everybody got a problem with the way I live  
I don't wanna go to Heaven if I can't get in  
  
Oh, yeah, raise 'em up, raise 'em up  
Everything you wanted is inside your cup  
Drink up  
Love will get you higher  
Oh, oh, all that your rhythm needs  
I never met no criminal  
And in the end I'll do it again  
I don't wanna go to Heaven if I can't get in  
  
Oh, I'm not a criminal  
Yeah, I'm no enemy  
It's just the way I live  
I don't wanna go to Heaven if I can't get in
