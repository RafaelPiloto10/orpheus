I'm coming back to you one more time  
To give you one more chance to clear your mind  
I know how much you don't want to be free so I'm doing this for you not for me  
All you have to do is apologize I'll be there soon as I dry my eyes  
I know how much you don't want to be free so I'm doing this for you not for me  
[ guitar ]  
All you have to do is apologize...  
I'm doing this for you not for me
