Visions of artemis  
Goddess of the moonlight  
The spell remains unbroken  
The wrong begin the right of the fire dance  
Standing strong and steady  
Waiting for the night sign  
The helix has just risen  
Now we have no choice but to drink the wine  
Now is the time of the fire dance fire dance  
  
Black-hearted woman  
Creature of the deep night  
In the darkness of your soul  
I'm hungry and searching to find the light  
You are in control  
I am in your power  
Bell eee the bell has tolled  
Now I know that the hour is near  
As I burn with fear of the fire dance  
  
The dharuba voice the wind is calling your name  
You leave me no choice  
Here I am falling again and again  
Again into the flames of the fire dance
