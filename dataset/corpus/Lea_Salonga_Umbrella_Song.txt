On the poor side of town, lives a girl no one knows  
With her worn out shoes and her ragged clothes  
Her mother tries to provide since her father has died  
But no one even cares if she's alive  
  
And when the rain comes down  
She's never getting wet  
And though the skies are gray  
She'll still be smiling yet  
  
Cause in her eyes there's no teardrops  
In her heart there's no pain  
She's got her love as an umbrella from the rain  
Oh, what love is an umbrella from the rain  
  
On the rich side of town, lives a boy no one knows  
With his shiny shoes and his fancy clothes  
He's got everything he needs if he wants to succeed  
But no one even cares if he's alive  
  
And when the rain comes down  
He's never getting wet  
And though the skies are gray  
He'll still be smiling yet  
  
Cause in his eyes there's no teardrops  
In his heart there's no pain  
He's got his love as an umbrella from the rain  
Oh, his love is an umbrella from the rain  
  
Isn't life feeling strange and money can't buy  
All you need to get by  
All around the world, there are folks no one knows  
If they're worn out shoes, their fancy clothes  
Will they find more there to give for and open the door  
To know that someone cares if they're alive  
  
And when the rain comes down  
We're never getting wet  
And though the skies are gray  
We'll still be smiling yet  
  
Cause in our eyes there's no teardrops  
In our hearts there's no pain  
We've got a love as an umbrella from the rain  
Oh, our love is an umbrella from the rain  
  
And when the rain comes down  
We're never getting wet  
And though the skies are gray  
We'll still be smiling yet
