Yes, yes, I know your hungry  
Ah, and here comes dinner  
  
"Feed my Frankenstein"  
  
Well, I ain't evil  
I'm just good lookin'  
Start a little fire  
And baby start cookin'  
I'm a hungry man  
But I don't want pizza  
I'll blow down your house  
And then I'm gonna eat ya  
Bring you to a simmer  
Right on time  
Run my greasy fingers  
Up your greasy spine  
  
Feed my Frankenstein  
Meet my libido  
"He's a psycho"  
Feed my Frankenstein  
Hungry for love, and it's feeding time  
  
You don't want to talk  
So baby shut up  
And let me drink the wine from your fur tea cup  
Velcro candy, sticky sweet  
Make my tattoos melt in the heat  
Well, I ain't no veggie  
Like my flesh on the bone  
Alive and lickin' on your ice cream cone  
  
Feed my Frankenstein  
Meet my libido  
"He's a psycho"  
Feed my Frankenstein  
Hungry for love, and it's feeding time  
Baby whoa-whoa oh yeah  
Feed my Frankenstei-ei-ein  
Baby Chow Down  
Feed my Frankenstei-ei-ein  
  
"He's a psycho"  
  
Feed my Frankenstein  
Meet my libido  
"He's a psycho"  
Feed my Frankenstein  
Hungry for love, and it's "lunch time"  
Baby whoa-whoa oh yeah  
Feed my Frankenstei-ei-ein  
Whoa-whoa Baby Chow Down  
Feed my Frankenstei-ei-ein  
  
Feed my Frankenstein  
Meet my libido  
"He's such a psycho"  
Feed my Frankenstein  
Hungry for love, and it's feeding time  
Baby whoa-whoa oh yeah  
Feed my Frankenstei-ei-ein  
Whoa-whoa Baby Chow Down  
Feed my Frankenstei-ei-ein
