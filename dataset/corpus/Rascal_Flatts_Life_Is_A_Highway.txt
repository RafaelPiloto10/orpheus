Whooo umm yeah  
Life's like a road that you travel on  
When there's one day here and the next day gone  
Sometimes you bend and sometimes you stand  
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind  
There's a world outside every darkened door  
Where blues won't haunt you anymore  
Where brave are free and lovers soar  
Come ride with me to the distant shore  
We won't hesitate  
To break down the garden gate  
There's not much time left today  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Life is a highway  
I wanna ride it all night long  
If you're going my way  
I wanna drive it all night long  
Gimme gimme gimme gimme yeah  
  
Through all these cities and all these towns  
It's in my blood and it's all around  
I love you now like I loved you then  
This is the road and these are the hands  
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights  
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights  
Knock me down and back up again  
You're in my blood I'm not a lonely man  
There's no load I can't hold  
A road so rough this I know  
I'll be there when the light comes in  
Tell 'em we're survivors  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
There was a distance between you and I  
A misunderstanding once  
But now we look in the eye  
  
There ain't no load that I can't hold  
A road so rough this I know  
I'll be there when the light comes in  
Tell 'em we're survivors  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x3]
