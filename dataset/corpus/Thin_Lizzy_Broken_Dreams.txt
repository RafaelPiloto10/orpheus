Have you ever had your dreams broken?  
It really messes up your heart  
You want to stop right there  
And go right back to the start  
  
You got to leave the town you're living in  
Oh I'm leaving, I'm leaving on the next train  
My dreams have been broken  
I don't think I'll ever be the same  
  
It's a bad, bad feeling when all the things  
That you've worked for just don't seem to turn out right  
Well this happened to me last night  
I woke up this morning and said I must be going  
  
You see my dreams have been broken  
I don't think I have  
The strength to carry on  
So I'll catch the next train southbound  
  
I don't want no pity  
Not from you or anyone  
It's just my dreams been broken  
And I got to tell someone before I go crazy  
  
I'll be leaving  
I'll be leaving  
On that next train going southbound  
Yes, I'll be leaving on that next train  
  
You see my dreams been broken  
And I just can't  
Take the pain  
I've got to move on  
  
You see my dreams been broken  
And I don't have  
The strength  
To carry on
