They've got so much things to say right now  
They've got so much things to say  
They've got so much things to say right now  
They've got so much things to say  
I'll never forget no way, how they crucified Jesus Christ  
I'll never forget no way, how they sold Marcus Garvey for rice  
I'll never forget no way, how they turned their back on Paul Bogle  
So don't you forget no way...  
Who you are, and where you stand in the struggle  
They've got so much things to say right now  
They've got so much things to say  
They've got so very many things, to say right now  
They've got so much things to say  
I'n'I nah come to fight flesh and blood  
But spiritual wickedness in high and low places  
And don't you fight me down  
I'll stand firm, and give Jah all the thanks and praises  
I don't expect to be justified, by these laws of men  
Though the we can find me guilty, Jah will proove my innocency  
'cause when the rain falls, it don't, fall on one man's house top  
Remember that  
See when this rain falls, it don't, fall on one man's house top  
They've got so much things to say right now  
They've got so much, so much things to say  
They've got, heh, so much things to say right now  
They've got so, so much things to say  
But let them keep talking, oh let them keep talking  
'cause non of them walking, oh non of them walking, no  
And while they still talking, see I'ma be walking  
I'ma be walking, so let them keep talking  
Said I never forget no way, how they crucified Jesus Christ  
And I, I'll never forget, how they sold Marcus Garvey for rice  
Said I, never forget, how they turned their backs on Paul Bogle  
So non of you, non of you forget...  
Who you are, and where you stand in the struggle  
'cause when this rain, 'cause when this rain, rain, rain, rain, rain falls  
It don't fall on one man's house, I'm telling you the rain...  
I'm telling you the rain, rain, rain, rain, rain don't fall  
It don't fall... they...  
They've got, they've got, so many very things to say about me  
I'm telling you: lie  
They, and they, and they will have so many things  
They'll have so many things to say about you... to say about you  
'cause they don't know me, know me  
They don't know me, oh they don't know me, oh they don't know me  
Oh they don't know me well  
They, they, they, they, they, they, they don't know my Father  
'cause if they did, if they did... hey ey... theeey... heh..
