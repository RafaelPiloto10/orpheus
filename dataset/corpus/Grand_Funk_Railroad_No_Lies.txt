Oh ... I got one thing to tell ya', then you make up your mind.  
It's what I been tryin' to tell ya', for a long, long time.  
We need each other, to live in peace and harmony.  
Don't need a whole lot to give, 'cause love is for free.  
  
I ... I got one thing to tell ya',  
I ... oooo, I ain't tryin' to sell ya',  
No lies.  
  
Forget all of your troubles, for a minute or two.  
Just listen to what I'm sayin', 'cause I'm talkin' to you.  
We don't need no leader, to tell us just what's wrong.  
We need love in the country, so we can get strong.  
  
And, I ... oh, you know, I got one thing to tell ya',  
I ... oooo, I ain't tryin' to sell ya',  
No lies.  
  
I ... I got one thing to tell ya',  
I ... oooo, I ain't gonna' sell ya',  
No lies.  
  
I ... I got one thing to tell ya',  
I ... oooo, I ain't gonna' sell ya',  
No lies.
