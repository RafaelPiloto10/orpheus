Don't whisper love and dream of wedding bells  
Don't do all the talking, let love speak up itself  
Let love speak up itself  
  
So when you feel a little tatty and unhappy with your face  
Let it breathe into us and put you back in place  
Let it breathe, let it breathe  
From the day it came into us till the day it wants to leave  
For it will, it will go  
And it will not say goodbye just like it didn't say hello  
There will not be a send-off, a funeral or mass  
Just a pathetic little vodka from a dirty little glass  
'To the world's greatest mum  
From the oldest swinger in town'  
  
Let love speak up itself  
Let love speak up itself  
Let it rise up in the morning and take us for that walk  
Let it do the talking when we're too tired to talk  
When we're too tired to talk  
  
And when you feel unhappy that I'm not the one I was  
Let love rot inside and let love palm you off  
Let it rot, let it rot  
Let it take your feelings and tie them in a knot  
In a knot, in a knot  
Let it take your feelings and tie them in a knot  
Hang them from a cleaver and say 'Look what we've got  
A man and a woman and guess what they forgot'  
'To the world's greatest mum  
From the oldest swinger in town'  
  
Let love speak up itself
