I'm laying it  
On the line to show you  
I'll never let you go  
On the line for your love  
There's nothing I want more  
  
Another dead-end street, another love gone wrong  
Another shattered dream, always the same old song  
I started thinking that you never come along  
I've got all this love inside and that was all that was tonight  
I'm wish you knew what I've been through to get you  
  
I meant it  
On the line to show you  
I'll never let you go  
On the line for your love  
There's nothing I want more  
When you smile  
I feel my heart open and I know there's nothing that I wouldn't do  
I'm laying it  
On the line this time  
Just to be with you  
  
After everything my heart's been through  
I treasure every moment I spend with you  
For me to feel this way is something new  
Now it's got a hold on me it's making me believe  
The love we got is something unlike any other  
  
I'm laying it  
On the line to show you  
I'll never let you go  
On the line for your love  
There's nothing I want more  
When you smile  
I feel my heart open and I know there's nothing that I wouldn't do  
I'm laying it  
On the line this time  
Just to be with you  
  
If you think it wasn't thinking, all you gotta do is say the words  
(Say the words)  
If you tell me what you need then I can give you what you ask for  
(Ask for)  
  
When I didn't have a prayer, I thought nobody cared  
I turned around and you were there  
  
Now I've been waiting for you  
(Oh waiting for you baby)  
And I want you to know  
(I want you to know)  
  
On the line to show you  
(That I'll never let you go)  
On the line for your love  
(There's nothing I want more)  
When you smile  
I feel my heart open and I know there's nothing that I wouldn't do  
(Nothing that I wouldn't do)  
  
I'm laying it  
On the line to show you  
(Never gonna let you go)  
On the line for your love  
There's nothing I want more  
When you smile  
I feel my heart open and I know there's nothing that I wouldn't do  
  
I meant it  
On the line this time  
Just to be with you
