Tell me what do I do about it?  
When you break down and cry  
I try to give you all my love and affection  
Please believe me I tried  
Oh Aimee, I know I've been unkind  
I guess I wasn't much of a friend  
Oh Aimee, let's leave it all behind  
'Cause I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you  
I'm gonna love you 'til the end  
Aimee, there is so much you gave me  
So much to live for  
When I'm feeling down you just turning around  
And the pain isn't there anymore  
Oh Aimee, I know I've been unkind  
I guess I wasn't much of a friend, oh yeah  
Aimee, let's leave it all behind  
'Cause I'll always love you, I'll always love you  
I'll always love you 'til the end  
(Angel in the night)  
Gonna be my angel in the night  
(Angel in the night)  
Gonna be my angel in the night  
(Angel in the night)  
Gonna be my angel in the night

Don't ever tell me lies  
'Cause I'll always be your friend  
And I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you  
I'm gonna love you 'til end  
So tell me what do I do about it?  
When you break down and cry  
And I try to give you all my love and affection  
Please believe me I tried  
Oh Aimee, I know I've been unkind  
I know I wasn't much of a friend, oh yeah
