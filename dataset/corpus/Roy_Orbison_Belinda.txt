Oh sweet, sweet Belinda  
They say that you're looking for a home  
Fresh out of a love affair, fresh out  
Of hope, fresh out of dreams  
I know you're as strong as any human can be  
But you need love - why don't you take it from me?  
I know I ain't much but you can have me for free  
Belinda  
  
Oh sweet, sweet Belinda  
You don't owe me no gratitude or love  
We're just two souls stuck here  
Two lonely rivers filled with life.  
Two lights shinin' in the darkness ahead  
Two feet touchin' in a cold winters' bed  
I promised you safety but I loved you instead  
Belinda  
  
Oh Belinda I'd die of loneliness if you ever left  
Oh Belinda I'd die of loneliness if you ever left  
Oh Belinda I'd die of loneliness if you ever left
