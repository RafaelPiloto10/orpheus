When you came into the pod, you told me that something was wrong  
Said you wasn't havin' no more fun and you want to lick the sun  
Couldn't say it was any fun, oh dude  
  
Now you're on the couch, you can't even move your fucking head  
Tell me that you wish you was dead  
Dude, I really don't wish you was dead  
Better stay in your sweaty mucus bed, oh dude  
  
I can't have a smoke, can't even enjoy a little brew  
What the hell's my buggy going to do?  
Can't even pet the horses in the zoo  
Little Miss Mandy's in this too, oh dude
