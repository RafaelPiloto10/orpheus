Don't ya love her madly  
Don't ya need her badly  
Don't ya love her ways  
Tell me what you say  
  
Don't ya love her madly  
Want to be her daddy  
Don't ya love her face  
Don't ya love her as she's walkin' out the door  
  
Like she did one thousand times before  
Don't ya love her ways  
Tell me what you say  
Don't ya love her as she's walkin' out the door  
  
All your love  
All your love  
All your love  
All your love  
All your love is gone  
  
So sing a lonely song  
Of a deep blue dream  
Seven horses seem to be on the mark  
Yeah, don't you love her  
Don't you love her as she's walkin' out the door  
  
All your love  
All your love  
All your love  
Yeah, all your love is gone  
  
So sing a lonely song  
Of a deep blue dream  
Seven horses seem to be on the mark  
Well, don't ya love her madly  
Don't ya love her madly  
Don't ya love her madly
