I must've dreamed a thousand dreams  
Been haunted by a million screams  
I can hear the marching feet  
They're moving into the street.  
  
Now did you read the news today  
They say the danger's gone away  
But I can see the fire's still alight  
Burning into the night.  
  
Too many men  
Too many people  
Making too many problems  
And not much love to go round  
Can't you see  
This is a land of confusion.  
  
This is the world we live in  
And these are the hands we're given  
Use them and let's start trying  
To make it a place worth living in.  
  
Superman where are you now  
When everything's gone wrong somehow  
The men of steel, men of power  
Are losing control by the hour.  
  
This is the time  
This is the place  
So we look for the future  
But there's not much love to go round  
Tell me why, this is a land of confusion.  
  
This is the world we live in  
And these are the hands we're given  
Use them and let's start trying  
To make it a place worth living in.  
  
I remember long ago  
When the sun was shining  
The stars were bright  
All through the night  
And the sound of your laughter  
As I held you tight  
So long ago  
  
I won't be coming home tonight  
My generation will put it right  
We're not just making promises  
That we know, we'll never keep.  
  
Too many men  
Too many people  
Making too many problems  
And not much love to go round  
Can't you see  
This is a land of confusion.  
  
This is the world we live in  
And these are the hands we're given  
Use them and let's start trying  
To make it a place worth fighting for.  
  
This is the world we live in  
And these are the names we're given  
Stand up and let's start showing  
Just where our lives are going to.
