Bells will be ringing the sad sad news  
Oh, what a Christmas to end the blues  
My baby's gone, and I have no friends  
To wish me greetings, once again  
  
Choirs will be singing Silent Night  
Christmas carols by candlelight  
Please come home for Christmas  
Please come home for Christmas  
If not for Christmas, by New Year's night  
  
Friends and relations send salutations  
Sure as the stars shine above  
For this is Christmas, yeah, it's Christmas my dear  
It's the time of year to be with the one you love  
  
So won't you tell me you'll never more roam  
Christmas and New Years will find you home  
There'll be no more sorrow no grief or pain  
And I'll be happy, happy once again  
  
[instrumental interlude]  
  
There'll be no more sorrow no grief or pain  
And I'll be happy, happy Christmas once again
