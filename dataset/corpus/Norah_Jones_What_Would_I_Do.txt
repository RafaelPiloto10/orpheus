Don't decieve me  
Please don't leave me  
What would I do without you  
To see me through  
If you leave me, then you'll grieve me  
What would I do without you  
To see me through  
What would I do  
I wanna know  
What would I do  
Where would I go  
Can you please me  
When you squeeze me  
What would I do, oh, if I, oh  
To see me through  
What would I do  
I wanna know  
What would I do  
Where would I go  
Oh, yes I'm crazy  
'bout my baby, yes I am  
What would I do without you  
To see me through, ohhhh
