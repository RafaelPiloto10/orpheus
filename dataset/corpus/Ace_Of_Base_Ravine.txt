Have you heard, have you heard,  
About this girl who was ripped up  
By her roots  
Have you heard, what she learned?  
  
Like humility, you win when you lose  
I have learned, I have learned  
The most horrifying nights have an end  
I was hurt, I was lost.  
  
In the dark I found a way to a friend  
I am standing here in my ravine.  
Once again I see a piece of the sky  
And my joy'll never be denied  
  
'Cause I was meant to be here,  
The only place on earth  
Where you are near, where you are near  
Was a flower, so frail,  
  
And I let the trees grow wild around me.  
Grew so high, hid the sky,  
Shaded everything I needed to see  
Then one night, someone came  
  
Took a knife an ripped me up by my roots  
Tossed astray, far away.  
In my darkest night I started to pray  
I am standing  
  
Why do you, why do you ask  
Why I'm not blaming my god?  
I'll tell you, I'll tell you what,  
He was the only one there  
  
I am standing
