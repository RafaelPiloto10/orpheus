Got to meet the hottie with the million dollar body  
They say it's over budget but you'd pay her just to touch it, come on  
Needs to hit the big screen and shoot a little love scene  
If Hollywood had called her she'd be gone before your holler, come on  
  
Pretty little lady with the pretty pink thong  
Every sugar daddy hitting on her all night long  
Doesn't care about the money she could be with anybody  
Ain't it funny how the honey wanted you all along  
  
[Chorus]  
(You naughty thing)  
Your ripping up the dance floor honey  
(You naughty women)  
You shake your ass around for everyone  
(Your such a mover)  
I love the way you dance with anybody  
(The way you swing)  
And tease them all by sucking on your thumb  
Your so much cooler when you never pull it out  
Cause you look so much cuter with something in your mouth  
  
Crafty little lip tricks  
Tattoos on her left hip  
She bending as your spending  
There's no ending it so baby come on  
Dressed up like a princess  
Bettin' that her skin smells better  
Than the scent of every flower in the desert come on  
  
Pretty little lady with the pretty pink thong  
Every sugar daddy hittin' on her all night long  
Doesn't care about the money she could be with anybody  
Ain't it funny how the honey wanted you all along  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She loves the night scene bar queen  
Was living for the fun taking over every dance floor like shes the only one  
In the spotlight all night dissin' everyone  
And trying to look so innocent while sucking on her thumb  
  
Your so much cooler  
When you never pull it out  
So much cuter  
With something in your mouth  
  
(You naughty thing)  
Your ripping up the dance floor honey  
(You naughty women)  
You shake your ass around for everyone  
I love the way you dance with anybody  
(The way you swing)  
And tease them all by sucking on your thumb  
  
(You naughty thing)  
Your ripping up the dance floor honey  
(You naughty women)  
You shake that ass around for everyone  
(Your such a mover)  
I love the way you dance with anybody  
(The way you swing)  
And tease them all by sucking on your thumb  
  
Your so much cooler when you never pull it out  
Cause you look so much cuter with something in your mouth
