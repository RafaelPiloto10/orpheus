What happened  
It seems like every time love comes  
You're never ready  
That's why they call it?  
The Rush  
  
Tell me, are you there?  
Could it be that you're the answer to my prayer  
See, I've prayed for peace and love  
Like so many of us do  
Then I prayed to find someone like you  
Up in the morning  
Fell out of my bed  
Worn out, I couldn't sleep  
Thoughts of you filled my head  
How could it be?  
This is scaring me  
  
Seems every time I try  
To rest my heart is when  
The rush is back again  
Maybe this time I'll  
Make it work somehow  
Guess I'm gonna find out now  
  
I get a rush  
And it's love for sure  
What else can it be  
Something beckons me  
And I go back for more  
Ooo such a rush  
Can't pass love by  
What else can I do  
Something tells me to  
Give it one more try  
  
I'm not gonna die if love passes me by  
It goes and comes around, I know  
So maybe the next time I'll be one of the few  
Chosen by love to do just what I wanna do  
I will carry on wading through every day till love needs me  
Waiting for the rush to come and find me  
I still remember when love was an angel send  
It will be back again  
  
I can't remember when, I can't remember how  
It's very different now  
It's not a fantasy, it's very real to me  
True to the touch  
I get a rush
