Well you are  
Such an easy evil  
You're such a sensuous sin  
Sometimes I don't know where I'm goin'  
'Til I been taken in  
  
You're such an easy evil  
Such a promise of fun  
Sometimes I don't know what I'm doin'  
'Til I'm done, you're a sneaky one  
  
Here he comes now touchin' me  
Callin' my name  
Again  
Here I go now  
Like a moth to a flame  
I'm a puppet for you baby  
  
Such an easy evil  
You're such a sensuous sin  
Sometimes I don't know where I'm goin'  
'Til I been taken in, yeah  
  
Ooh, ooh, yeah, ooh, oh  
Here he comes now touchin' me  
Callin' my name  
Again  
Here I go now  
Like a moth to a flame  
I'm a puppet for you baby  
  
Such an easy evil  
You're such a sensuous sin  
Sometimes I don't know where I'm goin'  
'Til I been taken in  
  
Well, no, no, no, no, no, no  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no  
'Til I been taken in  
I been taken in  
I been taken in
