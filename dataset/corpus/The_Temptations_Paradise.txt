Each night I dream...  
I cry when I go to sleep,  
So sorry that we broke up,  
But then I dream that you're in my arms,  
With all your charms. And I,  
  
[All:]  
Don't want to wake up, don't want to wake up.

I hope you'll have a change of heart,  
And come back to paradise, oh, oh, back to paradise.
