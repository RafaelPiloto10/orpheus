And I can not be saved  
Not by you  
Not by God  
I want to bleed  
And I can hardly breath  
Look at me  
Falling down  
Before your eyes  
All I've needed  
Takes me away from you  
All I've wanted  
Takes me away from you  
All I live for  
Takes me away from you  
All I'd die for  
Takes me away from you  
And this is not my voice  
Not my face  
Not my life  
It belongs to you  
And you will not believe  
The things I've seen  
The things I've done  
All in your name  
All I've needed  
Takes me away from you  
All I've wanted  
Takes me away from you  
All I live for  
Takes me away from you  
All I'd die for  
Takes me away from you
