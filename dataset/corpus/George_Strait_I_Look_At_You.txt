Sometimes I can't put up with bein' so put down  
And all my faith can manage, is the shadow of a frown  
My soul's about to break, there's only one escape  
  
I look at you, when the world is full of lies  
I look at you, and the truth is in your eyes  
I look at you, when I lay me down at night  
And I want to see a dream come true  
I look at you, and I know I've got it all  
You touch my hand, and the burdens start to fall  
You ease my troubled mind, I love you more each time I look at you  
  
You know someday's I'm tempted to run away and hide  
'Cause I can't miss the bad luck that's fallen from the sky  
I'm under some dark cloud, and there's only one way out  
  
I look at you, when the world is full of lies  
I look at you, and the truth is in your eyes  
I look at you, when I lay me down at night  
And I want to see a dream come true  
I look at you, and I know I've got it all  
You touch my hand, and the burdens start to fall  
You ease my troubled mind, I love you more each time I look at you  
  
I look at you, and I know I've got it all  
You touch my hand, and the burdens start to fall  
You ease my troubled mind, I love you more each time I look at you
