Heat's up, tea's brewed  
Clothes strewn around the room  
Looks like a wind swept through  
Made a wild man out of you  
And doesn't anger turn you on  
And expectation of a calm  
After the storm  
And your body feels so warm  
After the storm  
  
The wind's pulling the moon down  
under the eiderdown  
You're taking me to town  
And you're tossing me around  
You come on like a hurricane  
I'm settling like you're weathervane  
After the storm  
And your body feels so warm  
After the storm
