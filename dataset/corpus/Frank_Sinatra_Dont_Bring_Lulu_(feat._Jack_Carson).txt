"Your presence is requested," wrote little Johnny White,  
"But with is invitation, there is a stipulation,  
When you attend this party, you'll be treated right, but  
There's a wild and wooly woman you boys can't invite, now.  
Chorus:  
You can bring Pearl, she's a darn nice girl, but don't bring Lulu.  
You can bring Rose with the turned up nose, but don't bring Lulu.  
Lulu always wants to do, what we boys don't want her to,  
When she struts her stuff around, London bridge is falling down,  
You can bring cake or Porterhouse steak, but don't bring Lulu.  
Lulu gets blue and she goes cuckoo like the clock on the shelf,  
She's the kind of smartie who breaks up every party,  
Hullabaloo loo, don't bring Lulu, I'll bring her myself.  
  
We all went to the party, real hi-toned affair,  
Then along came Lulu, wild as any Zulu,  
She started into Charleston, and how the boys did stare, but  
When she did the hula-hula, then she got the air, now.  
Chorus:  
You can bring Pearl, she's a darn nice girl, but don't bring Lulu.  
You can bring Rose with the turned up nose, but don't bring Lulu.  
Lulu always wants to do, what we boys don't want her to,  
When she struts her stuff around, London bridge is falling down,  
You can bring cake or Porterhouse steak, but don't bring Lulu.  
Lulu gets blue and she goes cuckoo like the clock on the shelf,  
She's the kind of smartie who breaks up every party,  
Hullabaloo loo, don't bring Lulu, I'll bring her myself.
