All aboard  
Or are all y'all bored?  
It's good to have y'all back now  
Ladies and gents  
Y'all already know what it is  
God don't make no mistakes  
God don't make no mistakes  
  
Little do they know when I was brought up into this game  
Point ain't always in a vibe for spitting I made a change  
Like the diaper on the bottom of my baby daughter  
I wasn't ready to be no father, maybe, kind of, sorta  
'Cause when I saw her I swear it made a tear fall  
Not tears of sorrow but of joy so listen here y'all  
I grabbed the mic and moved the crowd then disappeared dog  
Back in '94 that was the motherfucking year homeboy  
Then that southernplayalistic went platinum  
Stacks on deck they ain't tell us to pay our taxes  
Walking around the table in the kitchen we was practicing  
Reciting rhymes to sharpen minds now lets deliver to the masses  
  
[Chorus]  
It's been a good long road  
Now its time for me to go  
I say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye  
Time to spread my wings  
And high up in the sky  
I can fly, I'll fly, I'll fly, so high  
  
Welcome to my life I think its time I take it back  
I got to give you all the facts so you can see what type of cat  
That you dealing with now on ATLiens we was killing it  
And then my auntie pass she was like my mother I was feeling it  
The first person close to me to die I needed healing  
But I see her as an angel when I look up at the ceiling  
Like my daddy and grandaddy on both shoulders steady chilling  
So you got to keep on living like each day is the beginning  
It's yo birthday even on your worst day  
Live it like the first day I'm Antwan Andre  
Or General Patton if you know bout Purple Ribbon or Got Purp  
I, I be on that kryptonite that means I can't be hurt  
Gotta leave this place it's been cool but I gotta go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Even on the train  
Should've asked two free mans  
I'll be back again  
(Know we been though a lot I ain't perfect but I swear  
To you I'm a changed man)  
Even on the train  
Should've asked two free mans  
I'll be back again  
(From the caboose)  
  
Now it's time to say goodbye they should've turned me loose  
I was all about my team but now I call upon my crew  
I'm a family type of person but I'm deadly dolo too  
And you can achieve anything that you put your heart into  
See the second hand will never stop and neither will the clock  
The nigga big still hit the stage by himself and still rock  
Cause when your faith is in the right place see he ain't gon let you flop  
You can say whatever you want (Bet you can't do it like me) Boy stop!!  
  
Before you can say you can't get going  
There's no excuse this time don't be afraid to fly  
You never know what day the doors will close  
It's time to say goodbye time to pack up and ride  
Got to leave this place it's been cool but I gotta go  
  
[Chorus]
