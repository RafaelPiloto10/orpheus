I've got a dollar deal hidden  
Down in my shoe  
So listen friends  
I tell you what I'm gonna do  
I'm gonna run up  
The road of mystery  
Hangin' by a thread to a fantasy  
A background black  
Showing my face  
Buried in the image  
Of an empty space  
  
I'm back on my feet  
Getting no sleep  
Makin' it all mine  
Give me a chance  
To follow the bands  
Waitin' for the sunshine  
  
Husslin' my will  
In a bar downtown  
And f it don't work out now  
'll keep movin' around and around  
  
Tll I'm back on my feet  
Getting no sleep  
Makin' it all mine  
Give me a chance  
To follow the bands  
I'm waitin' for the sunshine, yeah  
  
A dreamer, a dreamer  
Hangin' around  
A dreamer, a dreamer  
Trying to hitch a ride  
A dreamer, a dreamer  
Hangin' around  
A dreamer, a dreamer  
When I turn my back  
You're by my side  
  
Well I fought my way  
Through the back-stage door  
Staring at my goal  
Till my eyes get sore  
And working my way  
Through the little I say  
Caring no less just  
The light of the day  
A background black  
Showing my face  
Buried in the image  
Of an empty space  
  
I'm back on my feet  
Getting no sleep  
Makin' it all mine  
Give me a chance  
To follow the bands  
I'm waitin' for the sunshine, yeah  
  
Just a dreamer  
When I turn by back  
You're by my side  
  
Dreamer
