You pack your bag, you take control  
You're moving into my heart and into my soul  
Get out of my way! Get out of my sight!  
I won't be walking on thin ice to get through the night  
Hey where's your work? What's your game?  
I know your business but I don't know your name...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Hold on tight, you know she's a little bit dangerous  
She's got what it takes to make ends meet,  
The eyes of a lover that hit like heat  
You know she's a little bit dangerous  
  
You turn around, so hot and dry,  
You're hiding under a halo, your mouth is alive  
Get out of my way! Get out of my sight!  
I'm not attracted to go-go deeper tonight  
Hey what's your word? What's your game?  
I know your business but I don't know your name...  
  
Hold on tight, you know she's a little bit dangerous  
She's got what it takes to make ends meet,  
The eyes of a lover that hit like heat  
You know she's a little bit dangerous  
Oh just a little bit dangerous...  
  
Hey what's your word? What's your game?  
I know your business but I don't know your name...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chorus to Fade]
