Today I was gonna conquer the world,  
Go on ahead and make a stand.  
Today I saw an old friend a dyin'  
And as he lay there no one lent a hand,  
I'm gonna call you up,  
You'll forsake the one you love,  
Though I've left you many times before  
You are just a sinner.  
  
I was the one who understands,  
You were my one and only man.  
I was lost, now I'm the winner.  
You stand there waitin' by the shore,  
But I don't come that way no more,  
Because you are just a sinner.  
  
Today I was gonna hold out my hand,  
Reach up for that light and let it shine.  
Today I have no light to guide me  
Feelin' like the one they left behind,  
So I called you up,  
You left your love and took me away,  
Though I've left you many times before  
You are just a sinner.  
  
I am the only one, you see,  
You were the only one for me,  
I was lost, now I'm the winner.  
You'll keep the candle burning bright,  
But I won't be home tonight,  
Because you are just a sinner.  
  
Today I was gonna conquer the world,  
Go on ahead and make a stand.  
Today I saw an old friend a dyin',  
And as he lay there, no one lent a hand.
