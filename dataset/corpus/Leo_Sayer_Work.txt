Five days outa seven  
Eight hours of every one  
I'm tryin' to buy a piece of heaven  
But I'll be gone before that heaven comes  
  
Work, work, work  
Who needs it  
It's all I ever seem to do  
I'm killin' myself for a livin'  
  
Livin' the working man's blues  
Minute to minute  
Day after day  
Wherever I go it's always the same  
  
I work a little longer  
And make up my pay  
But when the cheque comes along  
They've taken half of it away  
  
All this work, work, work, work  
Who needs it  
All, all I ever seem to do  
Why'know I'm killin' myself for a livin'  
  
I should be stayin' at home with you  
City to city  
All over the world  
Wherever I've been to  
  
That's all I ever heard  
You work a little longer  
To double up on that pay  
Then the tax man comes along  
  
They've taken half of it away  
Work, work, work  
Who needs it  
It's all I ever seem to do  
  
I'm killin', killin', killin' time for a livin'  
Livin' the working man's blues  
Yeah, work, work, work  
Oh, my  
  
That's all it is  
Killin' myself for a livin'  
Like drivin' a nail straight into my hand  
I've been working my life away  
  
That's right  
Working my life away  
I'm working my life  
All this work, work, work,  
  
Working my life away  
Working my life away  
You know sometimes I get home in the evenin'  
And lay in bed at night just dreamin'  
  
I had enough a whole pay cheque sittin' in my hand  
So we can split it between the two of us  
And buy that big mansion on the hill  
Where that rich guy lives  
  
Who says he pays me every week  
Oh, I don't want to work no more  
I can't stand it
