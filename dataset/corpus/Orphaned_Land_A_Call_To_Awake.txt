"On to the lands we must go to warn all"  
Said the Snake, to the Eagle and the Lion  
"Beg them to repent so they might be saved  
From the fury and the anger that shall claim them"  
  
And so they set sail across the land ans seas alike  
In a quest to avoid the setting of the sun  
  
"God's rage is true  
He urges you  
To awake... "  
  
"Thou has stolen, betrayed  
And worshiped pagan gods  
Thou must awake, thy lost faith to be saved"  
  
And so spoke the propets,  
As the mob has gathered round  
(They) said their empire would soon crumble  
And fall down  
  
"Thou art our our brothers, hear our call this day  
We come not to see your end,  
But to revive we pray"  
  
"God's rage is true  
He urges you  
To awake... "  
  
"Where did these three come from"  
Asked the crowd anxiously  
Furious and confused at the same time,  
"Surely these people are lying or jesting.  
Either way they are here to cause harm. "  
  
"You just be on your way", said the mob as a  
Warning, "or else (all) hell will break loose!"  
"It's all a matter of choice..." said the Eagle,  
Though they really didn't  
Have much to choose...(From)
