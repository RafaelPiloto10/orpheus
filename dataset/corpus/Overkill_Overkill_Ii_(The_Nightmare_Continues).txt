Strangled in this knot of sin,  
He returns, again begins.  
Again to bend, and tear the will.  
A witness to this Overkill!!!  
  
Awaken! Awaken in me,  
Through my eyes! through my eyes you will see,  
What is real, what is to be.  
All the madness, madness in me...  
  
You taste the blood that I long for,  
Regain my strength and complete my chore...!  
  
Like a serpent!, poised to strike.  
Like the moon... that, fills the night.  
You, the question, answer they cried.  
You've always been destined to ride.  
  
Passion rests in an empty will,  
The nightmare continues.  
  
Into the night!  
A rider goes then disappears,  
Out! of the light.  
He reappears again.  
  
Beware!  
One eye does follow you.  
To kill again!  
And again!!!  
  
Slow and sure, a beating heart.  
Is sure to have, the killing starts  
The beating stops, fin de la vie.  
Overkill rides again!!!  
  
A killer like no man,  
A faster death, by one's own hand.  
Safety comes, when the wind is still.  
This the legend, Overkill!
