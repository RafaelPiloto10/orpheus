It doesn't matter what car you drive, she'll wreck it  
It doesn't matter where you sleep at night, she'll wreck it  
It doesn't matter where you go to work  
Doesn't matter where you go to church  
Doesn't matter just how bad it hurts, she'll wreck it  
  
My bleached bones in the desert, it's all she's left of me  
  
Poison ivy in your touch, being with you destroyed so much  
Home wrecker  
Deadly venom in your kiss, hell can't be worse than this  
Home wrecker  
  
It doesn't matter what you pretend, she'll wreck it  
It doesn't matter what you defend, she'll wreck it  
It doesn't matter how you live your life  
Doesn't matter anymore to your wife  
Doesn't matter even how you die, she'll wreck that too  
  
Like a vulture picking my bones clean, it's all that's left of me  
  
Poison ivy in your touch, being with you destroyed so much  
Home wrecker  
Deadly venom in your kiss, hell can't be worse than this  
Home wrecker  
  
Doesn't matter where you live  
Doesn't matter what you drive  
Home wrecker  
  
Poison ivy in your touch, being with you destroyed so much  
Home wrecker  
Deadly venom in your kiss, hell can't be worse than this  
Home wrecker
