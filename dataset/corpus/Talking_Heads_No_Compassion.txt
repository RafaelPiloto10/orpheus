In a world  
Where people have problems  
In this world  
Where decisions are a way of life  
Other people's problems they overwhelm my mind  
They say compassion is a virtue, but I don't have the time  
  
So many people...have their problems  
I'm not interested...in their problems  
I guess I've...experienced some problems  
But now I've...made some decisions  
Takes a lot of time to push away the nonsense  
Take my compassion...Push it as far as it goes  
My interest level's dropping, my interest level is dropping  
I've heard all I want to, I don't want to hear any more  
  
What are you, in love with your problems?  
I think you take it...a little too far  
It's...not so cool to have so many problems  
But don't expect me to explain your indecisions  
Go...talk to your analyst, isn't that what they're paid for  
You walk, you talk...You still function like you used to  
It's not a question...Of your personality or style  
Be a little more selfish, it might do you some good  
  
In a world where people have problems  
In this world where decisions are a way of life  
Other people's problems, they overwhelm my mind  
They say compassion is a virtue, but I don't have the time  
(Here we go again)
