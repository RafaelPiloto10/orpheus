All alone, lost in my dreams  
Who could know, just how I feel  
All the hopes and fears, the joy,  
The tears hidden in my heart  
Tell me I'm not dreaming, is it you?  
Time stand still, when I see you  
All these years, if you only knew  
How I've wanted to ask, would you come back?  
I'm here for you, please don't go away  
I'll never leave, I'll always stay  
Oh baby, please come back to me  
Or, it is the only way love's meant to be  
I'll stay here with you for eternity  
Oh baby, please come back to me  
All alone, lost in my dreams  
Who could know, just how I feel  
All the hopes and fears, the joy,  
The tears hidden in my heart  
Tell me I'm not dreaming, is it you?  
Time stand still, when I see you  
All these years, if you only knew  
How I've wanted to ask, now you've come back  
I'm here for you, please don't go away, love calls our names,  
Love has a way  
Oh baby, please come back to me  
Or, it is the only way love's meant to be  
I'll stay here with you for eternity  
Oh baby, please come back to me  
I can't live without you, don't you see  
We have a true love, love beyond the dreams  
Oh baby, please come back to me
