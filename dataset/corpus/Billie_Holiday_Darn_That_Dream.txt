Darn that dream  
I dream each night  
You say you love me and you hold me tight  
But when I awake you're out of sight  
Oh, darn that dream  
  
Darn your lips and darn your eyes  
They lift me high above the moonlit skies  
Then I tumble out of paradise  
Oh, darn that dream  
  
Darn that one track mind of mine  
It can't understand that you don't care  
Just to change the mood I'm in  
I'd welcome a nice old nightmare  
  
Darn that dream  
And bless it too  
Without that dream I never would have you  
But it haunts me and it won't come true  
  
Oh, darn that dream
