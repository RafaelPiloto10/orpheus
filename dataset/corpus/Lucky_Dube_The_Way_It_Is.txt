Didn't I raise my voice  
High enough for you  
I was running like a fugitive all the time  
Risking rejection from my own people yeah  
Now that you got what you wanted  
You don' t even know my name  
It' s so funny, we don' t talk anymore  
Be good to the people on your  
Way up the ladder  
Cause you' ll need them on your way down  
  
[Chorus:]  
That' s the way it is  
  
Didn't I raise fists high enough for you  
I guess I can' t pat myself on the shoulder  
For a job well done  
Dodging bullets in the streets  
I was there  
Risking rejection from my own people yeah  
Now that you got what you wanted  
You don' t even know my name  
remember  
Be good to the people on your way  
Up the ladder 'cause you' ll need  
Them on your way down  
  
[Chorus:]  
That' s the way it is
