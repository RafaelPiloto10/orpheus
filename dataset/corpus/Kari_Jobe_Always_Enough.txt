I lift my hands to the highest of all  
As I draw near  
Surrender my life to Your promise, oh God  
There is no other  
  
I will find my life in You  
You're always enough  
Always enough  
Let the fullness of Your love  
Be all I need  
All I need  
  
Consume me, come like a fire, oh God  
Reign in me  
For You alone will satisfy  
There is no other  
If I have You, I have everything  
But without You, I have nothing
