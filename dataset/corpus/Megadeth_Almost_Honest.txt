I lied just a little  
When I said I need you  
You stretched the truth  
When you said that you knew  
Just can't believe it  
There's nothing to say  
I was almost honest, almost  
Living alone, can't stand this place  
It's four in the morning and I still see your face  
I was nearly pure  
When I said I loved you  
You were semi-sincere  
You said I'd bleed for you  
We were kind of candid  
Now you've gone away  
You were almost honest, almost  
Living alone, falling from grace  
I want to atone but there's just empty space  
I can't face tomorrow, now you're not coming back  
Walked off in the night and just left me the tracks  
I question your call by the tone of your voice  
I know I should hang up but I don't have a choice  
It happened that night when you told me to go  
Don't ask who's to blame, I don't know  
Almost, almost honest  
Almost, I was almost honest
