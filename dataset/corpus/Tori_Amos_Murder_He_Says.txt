Finally found a fella  
Almost completely divine  
But his vocabulary  
Is killing this romance of mine  
We get into an intimate situation  
And then begins this character's conversation  
He says, murder, he says  
Every time we kiss  
He says, murder, he says  
At a time like this  
He says, murder, he says  
Is that the language of love?  
He says, solid, he says  
Takes me in his arms  
And says, solid, he says  
Meaning all my charms  
He says, solid, he says  
Is that the language of love?  
He says, chick chick  
You torture me  
Zoom, are we livin?  
I'm thinkin' of leaving him flat  
He says, dig dig the jumps  
The old ticker is giving  
He can talk plainer than that  
He says, murder, he says  
Every time we kiss  
He says, murder, he says  
Keep it up like this  
He says, murder, he says  
In that impossible tone  
Will bring on nobody's murder  
But his own  
He says, Jackson, he says  
And my name's Marie  
He says, Jackson, he says  
Shoot the snoot for me  
He says, Jackson, he says  
Is that the language of love?  
He says, mmmhmm  
When he likes my hat  
He says, tsk tsk tsk  
What the heck is that?  
He says, woo hoo! he says  
Is that the language of love?  
He says hep hep with helium  
Now babe, we're cookin'  
And other expression's too ill  
He says, we're in the groove  
And the groove is good lookin'  
Sounds like his uppers don't fit!  
He says, murder, he says  
Every time we kiss  
He says, murder, he says  
Keep it up like this  
In that, murder, he says  
In that impossible tone  
Will bring on nobody's murder  
But his own
