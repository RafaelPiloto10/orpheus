Oh baby doll!  
When bells ring out the summer free  
Oh baby doll  
Will it end for you and me?  
We'll sing our old Alma Mater  
And think of things that used to be  
  
I remember it so well  
Back when the weather was cool  
We used to have so much fun  
When we were walking to school  
If we stopped off to hear  
The latest songs they sing  
And we just make it in  
Before the bells would ring  
  
Oh baby doll!  
When bells ring out the summer free  
Oh baby doll  
Will it end for you and me?  
We'll sing our old Alma Mater  
And think of things that used to be  
  
When the teacher was gone  
That's when we'd have a ball  
We use to dance and play  
All up and down the hall  
We had a portable radio  
We was ballin' the jack  
We'd be all back in order  
When the teacher got back  
  
Oh baby doll!  
When bells ring out the summer free  
Oh baby doll  
Will it end for you and me?  
We'll sing our old Alma Mater  
And think of things that used to be
