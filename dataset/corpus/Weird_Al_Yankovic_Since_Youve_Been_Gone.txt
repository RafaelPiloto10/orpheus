Since you've been gone  
Well, I feel like I've been chewing on tinfoil  
Since you've been gone  
It's like I got a great big mouthful of cod liver oil  
Oh well, I'm feelin' like I stuck my hand  
Inside a blender and turned it on  
You know, I've been in a butt load of pain  
Since you've been gone  
(Since you've been gone)  
I couldn't feel any worse if you dropped  
A two-ton bowling ball on my toes  
(Since you've been gone)  
It couldn't hurt anymore if you shoved  
A red-hot cactus up my nose  
  
Since you've been gone  
Well, it feels like I'm getting tetanus shots every day  
Since you've been gone  
It's like I've got an ice cream headache that won't go away  
Ever since the day you left me  
I've been so miserable, my dear  
I feel almost as bad as I did  
When you were still here
