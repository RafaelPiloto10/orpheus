[Usher]  
What's so complicated  
Everythings so simple when you say it  
No one said the shit was easy  
No one said I'd take you out in the city  
Forgive me forgive  
But fuck with me fuck with fuck with me, now  
  
I'mma be real with you now, I don't know why I called her  
When you called me I was wrong, so thats why I bought ya  
Couple things for your wrist, thats shining in the dark  
Hope you'd forgive me thats why I bought it Yeah  
Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me  
Can't you see that I'm trying  
Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me  
  
Baby I can change can you stick around yeah  
Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me  
It's easy when I'm up can you hold me down  
  
Tell me what nigga is perfect  
Tell me what nigga is right  
Tell me what nigga has been with the same bitch  
And she holding it down for life  
Tell me who get it right on the first try  
I know I did wrong but what nigga is trying harder  
Than the one in this song  
Can you stay down  
Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me  
Boo don't give up on me now  
Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me  
Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me  
  
Baby I can change can you stick around yeah  
Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me  
It's easy when I'm up can you hold me down  
Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me  
Baby I can change can you stick around yeah  
Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me  
It's easy when I'm up can you hold me down  
Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me  
  
I ain't perfect, but smile ? its worth it  
A good man you deserve it  
Bear with me I promise I'm working (on it)  
I ain't changing over night  
Didn't you see me change your life  
I can admit that a lot, can we put this shit aside  
Baby Don't you see my trying  
Fuck with me  
  
Baby I can change can you stick around yeah  
Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me  
It's easy when I'm up can you hold me down  
Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me  
Baby I can change can you stick around yeah  
Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me  
It's easy when I'm up can you hold me down  
  
(Fuck with me fuck with fuck with me...)
