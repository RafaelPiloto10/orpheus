It's been a long time, baby  
High priest of rhythmic noise  
Living inside of me  
I been goin' round in circles  
And I've considered first degree  
Just a singer in a mind choir  
Lives on harmony  
If the song don't change the choir won't sin  
Won't sing the same song forever  
It's such a pity  
What's a poor boy to do  
It's such a pity  
What's a poor boy to do  
You look strange, that's what I like  
You look strange like me  
Fit to be tied, a little bedtime story  
Next position please  
Just a singer in a mind choir  
Lives on harmony  
If the song don't change the choir won't sing  
Won't sing the same song forever  
It's such a pity  
What's a poor boy to do  
It's such a pity  
What's a poor boy to do  
It's such a pity  
What's a poor boy to do  
When the high priest of rhythmic noise  
Is inside of you  
Don't give up, get out, get down  
(forever is a long long time)  
Don't stand up, shut up, sit down  
(you're strange, that's what I like)  
Don't make a move till you hear that sound  
(i'm just a singer in a mind choir)  
Don't give up, get out, get down  
(high priest of rhytmic noise)  
It's such a pity  
What's a poor boy to do  
It's such a pity  
What's a poor boy to do  
It's such a pity  
What's a poor boy to do  
When the high priest of rhythmic noise  
Is inside of you  
Forever is a long long time  
If you can...  
I'm a ...little tiny plastic pills  
From my little plastic pills  
It's such a pity  
What's a poor boy to do  
It's such a pity  
What's a poor boy to do  
It's such a pity  
What's a poor boy to do  
When the high priest of rhythmic noise  
Is inside of you  
Don't give up, get out, get down  
(forever is a long long time)  
Don't stand up, shut up, sit down  
(you're strange, that's what I like)  
Don't make a move till you hear that sound  
(I'm just a singer in a mind choir)  
Don't give up, get out, get down  
(high priest of rhytmic noise)  
Don't give up, get out, get down  
(forever is a long long time)  
Don't stand up, shut up, sit down  
(you're strange, that's what I like)  
Don't make a move till you hear that sound  
(i'm just a singer in a mind choir)  
Don't give up, get out, get down  
(high priest of rhytmic noise)
