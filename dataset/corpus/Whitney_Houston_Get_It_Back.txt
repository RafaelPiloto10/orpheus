Remember when  
It all began  
We were all in love  
Then came the friends  
Telling you when  
Your time for me was good enough  
I constantly  
Had to compete  
With your crew and their schemes  
Remembering  
Back in the day  
I used to mean everything  
  
(If we could just get it back)  
To the way it used to be  
(My only wish would be that)  
Nothing would change for you and me  
(I remember how it was)  
And I know that for a fact  
(We were oh so deep in love)  
If we could just get it back  
  
Now tell me why  
So many nights  
You had so much to do  
When you said bye  
Sometimes I tried  
I tried to make you choose  
Now tell me how  
You can allow  
You boys to control  
The time we shared  
It was unfair  
But now you need to know  
  
(Now if I told you)  
That I'm moving on  
(Boy what would you do)  
Things just ain't the same  
(We were supposed to)  
Conquer everything yeah  
(Boy let me tell you)  
You've got to make a change  
  
(If we could just get it back)  
To the way it used to be  
(My only wish would be that)  
Nothing would change for you and me  
(I remember how it was)  
And I know that for a fact  
(We were oh so deep in love)  
If we could just get it back  
  
(If we could just get it back)  
To the way it used to be  
(My only wish would be that)  
Nothing would change for you and me  
(I remember how it was)  
And I know that for a fact  
(We were oh so deep in love)  
If we could just get it back
