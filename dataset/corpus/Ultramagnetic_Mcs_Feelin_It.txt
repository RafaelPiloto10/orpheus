[Keith] Yo whattup Ced Gee this beat is hype I'm feelin' it  
[C.Gee] Word up Kool Keith, yeah yeah  
Yo Moe Luv, tell em one more time how Kool Keith is feelin'  
"You've got the feelin"  
Word up I like that, one more time, one more time  
"You've got the feelin"  
Aight yo Keith, bust this, tell em how you REALLY feel  
  
[Kool Keith]  
Now here's a funky beat, my rhyme is updated  
For soft ducks, I played it once  
A biter jumped on it  
Girls got stupid, freaks humped on it  
And from the back, I pumped on it  
mostly, with skill, top finesse  
East to West, but I guess, I'm right  
while others are wrong  
Tryin to teach, and usin my song  
along, with your wiggedy-wack  
Stay back, get back, sit back down  
and think about it, whenever you're dissin me  
You are the roach, the six legs wishin me  
and pushin me, steadily on  
Metaphor, better for, psychin more  
On my tour, brains are sore  
I'll be sure, I'm fresher  
So tell me how I..  
duck, wack rappers around  
In town, never wearin no boots  
Toy Bally, sharkskin suits  
Rip a story, and threw his auditory  
Canal Street, is my territory  
For gold glory, reachin my hand  
to smack rappers, and makin em stand outside  
waitin for me, to tell them, my secret style  
And show them, how really it's done  
My son, now I'm back to you  
And if you're bad I'll smack you too  
A glass of rhymes, shattering  
Now you're cut up, say what up?  
Shut up, cause I'm feelin' it  
  
[TR L.] Yo that was dope!  
"You've got the feelin"  
[Keith] Whattup Trev I'm runnin America about right now  
Whassup with Ced Gee  
"You've got the feelin"  
[TR L.] Yo, Ced, you ready to get on and tell em how you feel?  
[C.Gee] Yeah word up, bust this  
Man I'ma do this  
"You've got the feelin"  
I might as well go do this right?  
[TR L.] Definitely man  
[C.Gee] Aight, do it  
  
[Ced Gee]  
Hello! I'm back again  
It's Ced Gee, the champion  
of knowledge and wisdom over all topics  
I'm the chief, the general prophet  
Topping, all the ducks who are delerious  
about rhymin, I'm more serious  
Like this, with twists as changes  
I took time, and rearranged this  
style like how versatile you ask me now wow  
I'm like ??  
The movie, you seen on TV  
I'll be numerous, but believe me  
I'll chop you up, bash your brain, rotate your liver  
Then I'm gonna give ya, a fresh rhyme, maybe  
Sealed and delivered, by me  
The manufacturer  
Straight out of Attica, I come after ya  
And if ya run, I have to damage ya  
mentally, by using my mind  
Choosing adjectives hard to define  
in rhymes, a dictionary wordpiece  
From the Brainiac, I blew your domepiece  
open, hopin you'll say to me  
"That was dope," like an anatomy  
operation on the turntables  
Slicing nerds with verbs, fully enabled  
Equipped, with a white handkerchief  
to wipe away the germs who wanna hang with this  
Ultra smoker, dope man, no joker  
With the line I wrote, and I quote them  
Cause I'm feelin' it!  
  
"You've got the feeling"  
[C.Gee] I feel it.. one more time man  
"You've got the feeling"  
[Keith] Just another Boogie Down Bronx sure shot  
"You've got the feeling"  
[C.Gee] Word up, 4-3 Mission posse in effect  
"You've got the feeling"  
To my man Tim Southfield  
? my next door neighbor  
Hollywood House family  
Oh the whole 9 crew, Dexter, everybody  
[TR L.] Brother Kevvy Kev, brother Kev  
Keith, Brother Kevvy Kev is in effect  
[C.Gee] Yo Calvin what's up?  
[TR L.] Jungle Brothers, Violators, the whole family man  
[C.Gee] London  
  
(We out!)
