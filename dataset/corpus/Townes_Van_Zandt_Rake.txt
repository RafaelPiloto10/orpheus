I used to wake and run with the moon  
I lived like a rake and a young man  
I covered my lovers with flowers and wounds  
My laughter the devil would frighten  
The sun she would come and beat me back down  
But every cruel day had its nightfall  
I'd welcome the stars with wine and guitars  
Full of fire and forgetful  
  
My body was sharp the dark air clean  
And outrage my joyful companion  
Whisperin' women how sweet did they seem  
Kneelin' for me to command them  
And time was like water but I was the sea  
I'd have never noticed it passin'  
Except for the turnin' of night into day  
And the turnin' of day into cursin'  
  
You look at me now, and don't think I don't know  
What all your eyes are a sayin'  
Does he want us to believe these ravings and lies  
They're just tricks that his brains been a playin'?  
A lover of women he can't hardly stand  
He trembles he's bent and he's broken  
I've fallen it's true but I say unto you  
Hold your tongues until after I've spoken  
  
I was takin' my pride in the pleasures I'd known  
I laughed and thought I'd be forgiven  
But my laughter turned 'round eyes blazing and  
Said my friend, we're holdin' a wedding  
I buried my face but it spoke once again  
The night to the day we're a bindin'  
And now the dark air is like fire on my skin  
And even the moonlight is blinding
