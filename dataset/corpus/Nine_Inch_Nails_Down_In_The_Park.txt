Down in the park  
Where the machmen meet the machines  
And play 'kill-by-numbers'  
Down in the park with a friend called 'five'  
  
I was in a car crash  
Or was it the war  
But I've never been quite the same  
Little white lies like "I was there"  
  
Come to Zom-Zom's a place to eat  
Like it was built in one day  
You can watch the humans  
Trying to run  
  
Oh look there's a rape machine  
I'd go outside if he'd look the other way  
You wouldn't believe  
The things they do  
  
(CHORUS)  
We are not lovers  
We are not romantics  
We are here to serve you  
  
Down to the park  
Where the chant is death  
Death until the sun cries morning  
Down in the park with friends of mine  
  
[chorus]  
A different face but the words never change  
  
[chorus]x4
