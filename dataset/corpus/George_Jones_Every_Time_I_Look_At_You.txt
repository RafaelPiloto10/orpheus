I see a beautiful rose  
And my heart with love overflows  
I get a feeling that I never knew  
Every time that I look at you.  
  
The world looks so different to me  
Everything's so pretty I see  
I get a feeling that I never knew  
Every time that I look at you.  
  
The world is your lips so divine  
In you arms heaven is mine  
I always see a dream come true  
Every time that I look at you.  
  
Every time that I look at you
