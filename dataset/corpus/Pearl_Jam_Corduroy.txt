The waiting drove me mad... you're finally here and I'm a mess  
I take your interest back... can't let you roam inside my head  
I don't want to take what you can give...  
I would rather starve than eat your bread...  
I would rather run but I can't walk...  
Guess I'll lie alone just like before...  
I'll take the vermin's path... oh and I must refuse your test  
A push me and I will resist... this behavior's not unique  
I don't want to hear from those who know...  
They can buy, but can't put on my clothes...  
I don't want to limp for them to walk...  
Never would have known of me before...  
I don't want to be held in your debt...  
And I'll pay it off in blood, let I be wed...  
And I'm already cut up and half dead...  
I'll end up alone like I began...  
Everything has chains, absolutely nothing's changed  
Take my hand, not my picture, spilled my tincture  
I don't want to take what you can give...  
I would rather starve than eat your bread...  
All the things that others want for me...  
Can't buy what I want because it's free... (2x)  
Can't be what you want because I'm...  
I ain't s'posed to be just fun  
Oh, to live and die, let it be done  
I figure I'll be damned, all alone like I began...  
It's your move now...  
I thought you were a friend, but I guess I, I guess I hate you...
