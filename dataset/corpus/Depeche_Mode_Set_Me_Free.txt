Set me free  
Set me free  
  
Remotivate me  
Set me burning  
After years in deep freeze  
My body is yearning  
For a new lease of life  
And a little spice  
Set me free  
Remotivate me  
  
Give me a reason  
To scream and shout  
Give me something  
To get excited about  
When everything is looking dull  
I'm sure it isn't impossible to  
Set me free  
Remotivate me  
  
Remotivate me  
Set me burning  
After years in deep freeze  
My body is yearning  
For a new lease of life  
And a little spice  
Set me free  
Remotivate me  
  
Don't think I'm impatient  
Because I'm willing to wait  
But something must must happen  
Before it gets too late  
It could be my imagination  
But wasn't there more than this dull sensation  
Set me free  
Remotivate me
