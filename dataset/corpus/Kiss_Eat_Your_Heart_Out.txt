Eat your heart out baby (yeah)  
A hot mess is just what I need (uh, yeah)  
  
Yeah, give me a kiss I'll bite your lip  
C'mon baby let your backbone slip  
You've got something that gets me jumpin'  
I got something wanna talk about

Sparks fly, my blood runs high  
I wanna show you what it's all about  
Grease lightning at my feet  
I know I feel the heat  
  
You're my pleasure  
You're my pain

It feels right  
It feels goods  
You give me pleasure like a big girl should
