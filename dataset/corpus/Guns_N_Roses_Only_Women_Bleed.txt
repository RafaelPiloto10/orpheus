Man's got his woman to take his seed  
He's got the power - oh  
She's got the need  
She spends her life through pleasing up her man  
She feeds him dinner or anything she can  
She cries alone at night too often  
He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all  
  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
  
Man makes your hair gray  
He's your life's mistake  
All you're really lookin' for is an even break  
He lies right at you  
You know you hate this game  
He slaps you once in a while and you live and love in pain  
She cries alone at night too often  
He smokes and drinks and don't come home at all  
  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
  
Black eyes all of the time  
Don't spend a dime  
Clean up this grime  
And you there down on your knees begging me please come  
Watch me bleed.  
  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed
