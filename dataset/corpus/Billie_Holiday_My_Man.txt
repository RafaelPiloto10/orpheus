It's cost me a lot  
But there's one thing that I've got  
It's my man  
Cold and wet, tired you bet  
But all that I soon forget  
With my man  
He's not much for looks  
And no hero out of books  
Is my man  
Two or three girls has he  
That he likes as well as me  
But I love him!  
I don't know why I should  
He isn't good, he isn't true  
He beats me too  
What can I do?  
  
Oh, my man I love him so  
He'll never know  
All my life is just despair  
But I don't care  
When he takes me in his arms  
The world is bright, all right  
What's the difference if I say  
I'll go away, When I know  
I'll come back on my knees some day?  
For whatever my man is  
I am his forever more  
Oh, my man I love him  
  
Sometimes I say  
If I could just get away  
With my man  
He'd go straight sure as fate  
For it never is too late  
For a man  
I just like to dream  
Of a cottage by a stream  
With my man  
Where a few flowers grew  
And perhaps a kid or two  
Like my man  
And then my eyes get wet  
I most forget till he gets hot  
And tells me not to talk such rot  
  
Oh, my man I love him so  
He'll never know  
All my life is just despair  
But I don't care  
When he takes me in his arms  
The world is bright, all right  
What's the difference if I say  
I'll go away, When I know  
I'll come back on my knees some day?  
For what ever my man is  
I am his forever more
