He's living in that big old house that he knows was built by me  
He's playing with the baby that belongs to her and me  
At night he loves a woman that was held by these two hands  
He must be leaving hell to live with a ghost of another man  
  
My name is in the side wall outside our bedroom door  
He can't help but see what's too dare in me everywhere he goes  
He gladly walked through heaven to forget what he can't stand  
He must be leaving hell to live with a ghost of another man  
  
I don't mean to haunt him when they turn out the lights  
I'm there in the bedroom with both of them each night  
And he wonders if he just loved her as good as I loved her back then  
He must be leaving hell to live with a ghost of another man
