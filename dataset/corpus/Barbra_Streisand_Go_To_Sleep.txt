Now that's what I call a man!What are you gonna do about Warren?  
That's the first time in my life I felt like the opposite sex.  
What are you gonna do about Warren? I wonder if he'll ask me  
Tomorrow night. What are you gonna do about Warren? What am I  
  
Gonna do about Warren? Oh, Warren doesn't care.Warren cares!  
Warren cares, but I don't care! You have to care because you're  
Engaged to him and you don't have to care about him because how  
Will he know he cares about you? Then what are you gonna do?  
  
What did you say?  
When you know there's someone loving you  
And you know there's someone you love too  
And they're not the same, what do you do?  
  
Go to sleep, girl! Go to sleep! Go to sleep!  
Close your eyes and hide from every care  
When you wake up they may not be there  
But tell me how can I sleep  
  
Tell me who could  
When you see your whole life tangled up good  
I could drink, I could weep  
But tell me how can I sleep?  
  
Go to sleep! Go to sleep!  
And when you and someone have a date  
(Which you made when you were thinking straight!)  
And when you and someone stay out late  
(It was bad too...)  
  
Mmm...But I had to!  
When they're not the same who gets the gate?  
(This is not the way to find a mate!)  
Go to sleep, girl! Go to sleep! Go to sleep!  
  
( Go to sleep, girl! Go to sleep! Go to sleep!)  
Comes the dawn I may not feel the same  
(Comes the dawn he may not know your name!)  
In the sunlight who can see a flame?  
  
But tell me how can I sleep, look what I've done  
Mess around with two men  
Soon you'll have none  
As you sow, so you reap  
  
Which is why I can't sleep, mmm...  
Go to sleep, girl! Go to sleep! Go to sleep! Go to...
