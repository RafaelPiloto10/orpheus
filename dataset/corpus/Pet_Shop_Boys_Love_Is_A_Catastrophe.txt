Love is a catastrophe  
Look what it's done to me  
Brought me down here so low  
Stranded, nowhere to go  
  
No concentration  
Just rerunning conversation  
Trying to understand  
How I fell into this quicksand  
  
What happens next?  
With life I'm unimpressed  
Pain like a cutter's knife  
Never been lonelier in my life  
  
Who issued the instruction  
For this mad act of destruction?  
An end to equilibrium  
Fate laughs:  
Look what we've done to him!  
  
High wind through the trees  
Falling November leaves  
A weak sun hanging low  
Summer seems so long ago  
  
All my former dreams  
Tender romantic schemes  
Revealed as so naive  
To think I could believe  
  
In love as the kindest law  
Not as a declaration of war  
On my life and sanity  
Now I know at last for me  
Love is a catastrophe
