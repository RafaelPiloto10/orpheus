Well don't you know I need a  
Little indulgence?  
Listen to the hunter becoming  
Hunted  
Everyday there's a million advances  
Don't be too forceful you'll ruin  
Your chances  
Well don't you know that time is a  
Broken glass  
That splinters against the wall?  
But the picture is coming back  
Now baby  
And I want to take it all  
  
Don't go making all these promises  
You know you cannot keep  
There's a time to play a king and a  
Time to be a thief  
Cause if you're making all these  
Promises you know you cannot keep  
You know time will be the thief and  
Your fallen king end up alone  
  
So let your body move a little bit closer  
Silent like the sound proceeding a cyclone  
Don't you know that powerful thinking  
Can be a force you don't want  
To relinquish?  
Well don't you know that  
They say hanging on will justify the wait?  
But patience and elated wisdom  
Don't share a common phrase  
  
Don't go making all these promises  
You know you cannot keep  
There's a time to play a king and a  
Time to be a thief  
Cause if you're making all these  
Promises you know you cannot keep  
You know time will be the thief and  
Your fallen king end up alone  
  
Well I'm only hanging on for what  
Goes down  
I'm floating high and my feet don't  
Touch the ground  
I'd take advantage but I can't see  
Through this charade  
So don't you, don't go make it harder  
That hell  
Cause it comes down to the making  
You'd better be damned sure you can  
Take it  
Hey baby  
  
Don't go making all these promises  
You know you cannot keep  
There's a time to play a king and a  
Time to be a thief  
Cause if you're making all these  
Promises you know you cannot keep  
You know time will be the thief and  
Your fallen king end up alone  
  
Time will be the thief  
And your fallen king will end up...  
A fool, a fool, a lonely sorry fool  
Oh baby, 'cause I told you baby
