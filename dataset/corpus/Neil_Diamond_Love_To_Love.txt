Love's a thing that needs wants to thrive on  
Then it grows  
At least that's what I've been told  
You can't love someone  
If you find that all you get in return  
Is a heart that's cold  
They say you need love to love  
You gotta have love to love  
They all say it works that way  
But if it's true  
Why do I love you  
Seems like you keep tryin' to break me  
You do things designed just to make me cry  
And I've heard if warm lips don't touch you  
Love won't grow no matter  
How much you try  
They say you need love to love  
You gotta have love to love  
They all say it works that way  
But if it's true  
Why do I love you  
They say you need love to love  
You gotta have love to love  
They all say it works that way  
But if it's true  
Why do I love you  
Why do I love you  
Like I do
