I never said I was more than I am  
Do what I want and I don't give a damn  
You're all so weak you know it makes me ill  
Don't like you now and probably never will  
You cheat and lie, and wonder why  
You can't sleep at night  
  
You're not well, Mr. Blackwell  
And we can tell  
You're not well, Mr. Blackwell  
Why don't you go to hell  
  
I am a sinner who just loves to sin  
I am a fighter who just loves to win  
I am the truth about this crummy hole  
There's nothing here that can't be bought or sold  
You're cold and mean, and in between  
You're rotten to the core  
  
You're not well, Mr. Blackwell  
And we can tell  
You're not well, Mr. Blackwell  
Why don't you go to hell  
  
You're a victim, a real disgrace  
You should be banished from the human race  
  
We'll drink to sorrow then we'll drink to waste  
We'll drink a toast to the inhuman race  
Here's to the world and the times we're in  
Here's to the kid a real man among men  
You're cold and mean, and in between  
You're rotten to the core  
  
You're not well, Mr. Blackwell  
And we can tell  
You're not well, Mr. Blackwell  
Why don't you go to hell
