Once we were lovers, can they understand?  
Closer than others I was your, I was your man  
Don't talk of heartaches, oooh, I remember them all  
When I'm checking you out one day, to see if I'm  
Faking it all  
  
CHORUS  
Can you hear me?  
Can you feel me inside?  
Show your love, love  
Take it in right (take it in right)  
Take it in right (take it in right)  
  
There's been many others (Oo-oo-oo-oohh) so many times  
Sixty new cities an' what do I, what do I  
What do I find?  
I want love so badly, I want you most of all  
You know it's harder to take it from anyone  
It's harder to fall  
Can you hear me call?  
  
CHORUS  
  
Well, can you hear me? (yeah)  
Can you feel me inside? (I do)  
Show your love, show your sweet, sweet love  
Show me your love  
  
Take it in right (take it in right)  
Take it in right, yeah (take it in right)  
Take it in right to your love life, baby  
Take it in right, to your love life  
Take it in right, take it in right, right to your love life  
Take it in right, ah  
Take it in, take it in right  
Right down, right down  
(Why don't you take it?)  
Mmmm, why don't you take it?  
(Right to your heart)  
Can you hear me?  
(Why don't you take it?)  
Can you feel me?  
(Why don't you take it?)  
Can you? Take it in right  
(Why don't you take it?)  
Wuhh, right down, right down  
(Right to your heart)  
Can you take it? Feel me?  
(Why don't you take it?)  
Down, to right down  
(Why don't you take it?)  
To your heart  
(Why don't you take it?)  
To your heart  
(Right to your heart)  
Take it down, take it down  
(Why don't you take it? Why don't you take it?)  
Take it in right  
(Right to your heart)
