Hey yo, Soopafly

Hmm...ain't that a trip

Snoop D-O double G (from the DP)  
  
Every nigga in this rap game, to the dope game  
Now I got the hook up on the dodo, for sure tho'  
But I'm not a weed seller, but a crocka sack beller  
A rap star plus a 2 time felon  
Sellin' phones out the trunk I mix G with funk  
I put it all together, and rock it till it chump  
Then bag it up and sag it up and then serve  
I'm always on the pager, never on the curb  
I'm big time, get mine, stay down for the grizind  
I keep it gangsta, nigga, all the tizime  
Ask them niggaz, from way down South (who?)  
The boys right there with the gold in they mouth  
They'll tell ya (tell ya)  
There ain't no bullshit to sell ya  
Snoop D-O double G who wannabes wannabe  
I got love for my folkers out in 'Lejo  
And all my soldiers gettin' busy down in N-O  
Gangsta's, get respect from me  
And all you other niggaz gettin' checked by me  
That's on the C, DPG will never break up  
There's too much motherfuckin' paper to cake up  
That's on me (DPG)

That's the old fashion way, and bring a friend with ya  
So when I'm through with ya she can hit ya  
Shit I ain't trippin'  
I'm dippin'  
There's money to be made  
It's funny how she layed when I told her she couldn't stay  
Look here, my boo'll be through  
So you gotta raise, boy game pays  
On the next phase, gotta show to do at 4  
Then I'm headed right back to the studio  
If you need the hook up  
Give a nigga a holla  
I slide through your hood, in the gold impala  
Drop off a sack, then I head right back  
And I hope I don't get jacked, cause you know I'm ridin' strapped  
But if the boys decide to pull me over loc  
They recognize my face, and so they go  
Gangsta's get respect ya see  
All y'all other niggaz gettin' shook like fleas  
That's on the C  
DPG will never break up  
There's too much motherfuckin' paper to cake up  
That's on me
