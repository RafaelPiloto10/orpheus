I see the way he treats you  
I feel the tears you cry  
And it makes me sad and it makes me mad  
There's nothin' I can do, baby  
'Cause your lover is my best friend  
And I guess that's where the story ends  
So I've gotta try to keep it inside  
You'll never be, never be mine  
  
But if I was the one who was loving you, baby  
The only tears you'd cry would be tears of joy  
And if I was by your side  
You'd never know one lonely night  
  
If it was my arms you were running to  
I'd give you love in these arms of mine  
If I was the one in your life  
  
If I could have just one wish  
I'd wish that you were mine  
I would hold you near, kiss away those tears  
I'd be so good to you, baby  
You're the one I want next to me  
But I guess that's just not meant to be  
He's there in your life, he's sharing your nights  
I'll never be, never be, never be right  
  
But if I was the one who was loving you, baby  
The only tears you'd cry would be tears of joy  
And if I was by your side  
You'd never know one lonely night  
  
I want to reach out and feel you beside me, beside me  
Right here, right now, right beside me baby, baby  
And take you in my arms right now  
And scream I love you right out loud  
And then someday I'll pray I'll find  
I'll find the strength to turn to you and say  
  
But if I was the one who was loving you, baby  
The only tears you'd cry would be tears of joy  
And if I was by your side  
You'd never know one lonely night  
  
If I was the one, if I was the one, the one  
If I was the one in your life
