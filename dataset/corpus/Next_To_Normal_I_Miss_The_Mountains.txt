Diana:  
There was a time when I flew higher,  
Was a time the wild girl running free  
Would be me.  
Now I see her feel the fire,  
Now I know she needs me  
There to share  
I'm nowhere.  
  
All these blank and tranquil years  
Seems they've dried up all my tears.  
And while she runs free and fast,  
Seems my wild days are past.  
  
But I miss the mountains.  
I miss the dizzy heights.  
All the manic, magic days,  
And the dark, depressing nights.  
  
I miss the mountains,  
I miss the highs and lows,  
All the climbing, all the falling,  
All the while the wild wind blows,  
Stinging you with snow  
And soaking you with rain  
I miss the mountains,  
I miss the pain.  
  
Mountains make you crazy  
Here it's safe and sound.  
My mind is somewhere hazy  
My feet are on the ground.  
  
Everything is balanced here  
And on an even keel.  
Everything is perfect  
Nothing's real...  
Nothing's real.  
  
And I miss the mountains.  
I, I miss the lonely climb.  
Wand'ring through the wilderness.  
And spending all my time  
Where the air is clear  
And cuts you like a knife  
I miss the mountains...  
I miss the mountains...  
I miss my life.  
I miss my life.
