Ah, ah  
  
I've seen it on your face  
Tells me more than any worn out old phase  
So now we'll go separate ways  
Never again we two  
Never again, nothin' I can do  
  
Like an image passin' by, my love, my life  
In the mirror of your eyes, my love, my life  
I can see it all so clearly  
(See it all so clearly)  
Answer me sincerely  
(Answer me sincerely)  
Was it a dream, a lie?  
  
Like reflections of your mind, my love, my life  
Are the words you try to find, my love, my life  
But I know I don't possess you  
So go away, God bless you  
You are still my love and my life  
Still my one and only  
  
I've watched you look away  
Tell me, is it really so hard to say?  
Oh, this has been my longest day  
Sitting here close to you  
Knowing that maybe tonight we're through  
  
Like an image passin' by, my love, my life  
In the mirror of your eyes, my love, my life  
I can see it all so clearly  
(See it all so clearly)  
Answer me sincerely  
(Answer me sincerely)  
Was it a dream, a lie?  
  
Like reflections of your mind, my love, my life  
Are the words you try to find, my love, my life  
But I know I don't possess you  
So go away, God bless you  
You are still my love and my life  
Yes, I know I don't possess you  
So go away, God bless you  
You are still my love and my life  
Still my one and only
