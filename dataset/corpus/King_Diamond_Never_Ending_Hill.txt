Time is never ever standing still.  
Except on Never Ending Hill.  
  
From here you can see Devil Lake.  
The velvet sunset is never too late.  
  
Never Ending Hill is where I live.  
The Old Oak Tree is standing still.  
  
Can you hear the birds singing in the tree.  
Can you hear the wind shaking all the leaves.  
  
Whoa, Take a look at the sky.  
Golden clouds are moving right by my eyes.  
Black Cat Magic is down by the lake.  
Chasing butterflies that can't get away.  
  
Now the sun is slowly going down.  
I can hear... Devil Lake is quiet now.  
Magic! Magic come home!  
Say goodbye to your butterfly cause nighttime is coming our way!  
  
Time is never ever standing still.  
Except on Never Ending Hill.  
  
From here you can see Devil Lake.  
The velvet sunset is never too late.  
  
Whoa, Take a look at the sky.  
Golden clouds are moving right by my eyes.  
Black Cat Magic is down by the lake.  
Chasing butterflies that can't get away.  
  
Darkness coming.  
Sun is drowning.  
Drowning in Devil Lake.  
Magic come in.  
Light is fading.  
Oh yeah its getting late.  
  
Take a look at the sky.  
Golden clouds are moving right by my eyes.  
Black Cat Magic is down by the lake.  
Chasing butterflies that can't get away.
