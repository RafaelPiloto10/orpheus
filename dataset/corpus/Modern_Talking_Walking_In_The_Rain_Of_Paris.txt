Oh baby I tell I never say never (ce soir, ce soir)  
I know you deserve what love just can do (ce soir, ce soir)  
And this is the final call for you angel (oh angel, oh angel)  
This is the final call to you  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm not walking in the rain of Paris  
I don't promise , that I'll die for you  
And I never said I want to marry, that is true  
But Baby I swear you  
My love is true  
  
Tonight oh I miss you like I miss the sunshine (ce soir, ce soir)  
Babe you and I  
We can fly  
One mile high (ce soir, ce soir)  
Oh don't tell a lie about me my angel (oh angel, oh angel)  
And I won't tell the truth on you
