You've been out again tonight  
With the girls out on the town  
But in those magic neon lights  
I know exactly what you found  
What about your home?  
And the man who loves you so  
Is it worth the thrill you feel down on neon row  
  
If you're lonely then your easy  
Them good ol' boys just pick and choose  
And lonely women are in season  
A one night stand's an all night lose  
And all those lonely high-heeled ladies  
Are always putting on a show  
But in the morning putting on coffee  
And putting back on the clothes they wore the night before  
To neon row  
  
Girl I can't hold you back  
Not one day longer  
If my love ain't strong enough  
To keep you home  
Just start the fire  
To burn the bridges  
And maybe some night will lead in the magic light  
Down on neon row  
  
If you're lonely then your easy  
Them good ol' boys just pick and choose  
And lonely women are in season  
A one night stand's an all night lose  
And all those lonely high-heeled ladies  
Are always putting on a show  
But in the morning putting on coffee  
And putting back on the clothes they wore the night before  
To neon row  
  
And putting back on the clothes they wore the night before  
To neon row
