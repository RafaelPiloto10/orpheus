There were days when each hour was a war I fought to survive  
There were nights full of nightmares and I dreaded closing my eyes  
There were skies that burst open with a downpour to drown me alive  
But the world took a spark like a match in the dark and the fire brought me to
life  
So I'm fanning the flames to climb so high 'cause there's no other way we can
stay alive  
  
'Cause we're burning bright as we all unite  
And when it's all said and done we'll shine like the sun so don't let the fire
die  
And we'll watch the sky as it fills with light  
And though the embers are new, whatever you do just don't let the fire die  
  
And you'll find, there'll be mornings when the ashes and embers are cold  
But you'll fight with a passion and you'll never stop 'cause you know  
Yeah you know it gets better and your story is yet to be told  
Every push, every shove, every war, every love  
Yeah the coals are beginning to glow  
So I'm fanning the flames to climb so high 'cause there's no other way we can
stay alive  
  
'Cause we're burning bright as we all unite  
And when it's all said and done we'll shine like the sun so don't let the fire
die  
And we'll watch the sky as it fills with light  
And though the embers are new, whatever you do just don't let the fire die  
  
Don't let the fire die  
It gets better  
Just don't let the fire die, no  
  
'Cause we're burning bright as we all unite  
And when it's all said and done we'll shine like the sun so don't let the fire
die  
And we'll watch the sky as it fills with light  
And though the embers are new, whatever you do just don't let the fire die  
  
And though the embers are new, whatever you do just don't let the fire die  
Don't let the fire die
