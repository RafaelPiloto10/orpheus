Why can't you just admit it,  
You've had it, you're  
Sick of me  
  
You're fed up  
With my almighty attitude  
Sick of me  
  
Generalize  
You've become so desensitized  
Sick of me  
  
Loss of breath  
I can see that you've had it, you're  
Sick of me  
  
Wandering out the door  
I am on to you  
You're comin' back for more  
Am I losing you?  
  
Like a dog  
That just pissed on your barbecue  
Sick of me  
  
Losing faith  
And you still don't know what to do  
Sick of me  
  
Loss of love  
Now you hate everything and you're  
Sick of me  
  
It's a waste  
But we still keep on trying, you're  
Sick of me  
  
Wandering out the door  
I am on to you  
You're comin' back for more  
Am I losing you?  
  
So you got your problems  
So you've got your worries  
Do you have a conscience?  
Do you have a need?  
Well I'm sick of you too.
