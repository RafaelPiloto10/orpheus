Mommy, where's daddy?  
Mommy, where's daddy?  
  
Right here, girl  
Sweet thing, you look so sad  
Cheer up, don't you know your dad is bad  
Give daddy a kiss, girl  
Oh, dad  
  
There ain't no problem I can't face, 'cos  
Your daddy's got a bigger bag of tricks  
Give daddy a kiss, girl  
Oh, dad  
  
Mommy, where's daddy?  
Mommy, where's daddy?  
  
Come on, sit on your daddy's lap 'cos  
I'm the one who pats your back  
Give daddy a kiss, girl  
Oh, dad  
  
Lemme see now where to begin  
Lemme start by tuckin' you in  
Give daddy a kiss, girl  
Oh, dad  
  
Mommy, where's daddy?
