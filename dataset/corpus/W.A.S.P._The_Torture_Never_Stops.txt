Bang, bang, banging in your head  
You're banging on the walls  
Hang, hang, hanging up yourself  
You're hanging by your balls  
  
And you, you die but no-one hears or cares  
And hope's the rope that keeps you tied in knots  
  
The torture never stops  
The torture never stops  
  
Suck, suck, sucking at your life  
Your master sucks the juice  
Shoot, shoot, shooting at you  
And the hangman's noose is loose  
  
And you, you cry but no-one hears or cares  
And hope's the rope that keeps you tied in knots  
  
The torture never stops  
The torture never stops  
  
Your masters beat you bloody  
Still you're running back for more  
And every day, you lay down and play the whore  
  
The torture never stops  
The torture never stops
