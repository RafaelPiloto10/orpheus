As the dawn is breaking on your future my child  
Is there none of your love alive?  
If every door you open closes on me  
I don't know if I can survive, I don't know if I can survive  
Long is the road that takes you from home  
My baby, oh my darling sleepless are the hours  
And lonely is the night for the poor tormented soul  
Who is searching for the light  
This morning I opened my eyes  
I knew from the silence that something was wrong  
Turning I realized I wanted to cry  
When I knew I was alone  
But where will you go and who will be your guide  
And which way will you turn the waters are so wide  
'cause I never told you no you'll never really know  
I need you so  
Now the sun is rising on your freedom my child  
Is there none of your love alive?  
Every door you open closes on me  
I don't know if I can survive knowing part of your love was lies  
Long is the road that takes you from home  
My baby oh my darling sleepless are the hours  
And lonely is the night the poor tormented soul  
Who is searching for the light  
The moment I opened my eyes  
I knew from the silence that something was wrong  
Turning I realized I wanted to cry  
When I knew I was alone  
But where will you go and who will be your guide  
And which way will you turn the waters are so wide  
'cause I never told you no you'll never really know  
I need you so
