Oh, your eyes of blue  
Your kisses too  
I never knew what they could do  
I can't believe that you're in love with me  
  
Yes, you're telling everyone I know  
I'm on your mind each time you go  
They can't believe that you're in love with me, oh yeah  
  
Oh baby, I have always placed you far above me  
I just can't imagine that you love me  
And after all is said and done  
To think that I'm the lucky one  
I can't believe you're in love with me
