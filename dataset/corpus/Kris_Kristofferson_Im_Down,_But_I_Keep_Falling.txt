Hey, fairweather friend,  
You know you can bend me  
I don't wanna break  
Hey, lend me a hand  
Something I can lean on  
'Til I'm strong enough to  
Make it...  
  
'Cause I'm lost, but I'll be lookin'  
I've been hurt, but I keep on hopin'  
'Cause I'm down, but I keep fallin'  
Fall in love with you  
Fall in love with you.  
  
Take all you can find  
Any way you want to  
Easy as you can  
Leave something behind  
Love enough to live on  
'Til I'm strong enough to stand it  
On my own...  
  
But I'll be lookin'  
All alone--but I keep on hopin'  
'Cause I'm down, but I keep fallin'  
Fall in love with you  
Fall in love with you.......
