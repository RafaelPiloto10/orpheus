Richard talks too slow  
He'd get interrupted long before  
I always loved that guy  
And he's not on T.V. anymore.  
To get before he had  
The wherewithal to get out before  
He had the wherewithal  
  
You've got to coax him slow,  
That's the only way that he'll confess.  
Tell him that the truth will  
Help him live with less.  
To get out before he had the wherewithal  
To get out before he had the wherewithal.  
That's a breathy body of work  
Set your sights inward for a leaner look.  
  
Richard died real slow,  
He won't get interrupted anymore.  
I always loved that guy  
And he's not on T.V. anymore.  
To get out before he had the  
Wherewithal to get out before  
He had the wherewithal
