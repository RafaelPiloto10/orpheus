There's a ship arriving too late  
To save a drowning witch  
She was swimmin' along  
Tryin' to keep a date  
With a merchant marine  
Who told her he was really rich  
But it doesn't matter no more...  
She's on the ocean floor  
'n the water's all green down there  
'n it's not very clean down there  
'n water snakes  
'n rusty wrecks  
Is all that she can see  
As the light goes dim  
And she's tryin' to swim  
Will she make it?  
(boy, we sure hope so...)  
Not even a witch oughta be caught  
On the bottom of america's spew-infested  
Ho-ho-ho, hey-hey...  
She could get radiation all over her  
She could mutate insanely... (aie-ee-aie)  
She could mutate insanely... (earth wall)  
Then you know  
She could go on the freeway and grow up to be 15 feet tall  
And very very scary-lookin'  
And then...  
Cars could crash all over the place  
As a result of people with hawaiian shirts on...  
Lookin' up to hear her go "ha ha ha..."  
Sardines in her eyebrows...  
Lobsters up 'n down her pudenda  
All of them horribly large from graduation...  
And smelling very bad  
And dangerous!  
Maybe a submarine could save her,  
That's right! yes, that's true!  
And bring her back just like a mud-shark...  
Tell 'em what they win, bob!  
Well, therefore ladies:  
A full week's supply of gartenion's onion rings,  
Bronco's new bondage-in-a-bottle!  
It won't crack, it won't stake, it won't beat, it won't budge,  
It won't bite the old fate...  
And of course a brand new, absolutely brand new,  
New, new, and of course, but also a new car!
