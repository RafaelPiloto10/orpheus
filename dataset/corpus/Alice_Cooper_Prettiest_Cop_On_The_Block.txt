I'm six foot three with a fist like a hammer  
And I work with the Vice Squad when I can  
And when I pull out my badge they forget all my glamor  
Little guys all surprised, take a seat  
Peek at me, it's a bust, I'm a man  
I'm the prettiest cop on the block  
I set your souls on fire  
Yes, I'm the prettiest cop on the block  
I'm cool and I'm so mean  
Oh, I'm the prettiest cop on the block  
I've handcuffed your desire  
I've got a stiff reputation with a stick like a rock  
My kids are confused and my wife is in shock  
I'm a full blooded man not a weak imitation  
I like to flex my arms in the neon lights  
I'm a queen on the street and a king at the station  
It's a secret of mine, not a sign I'm gonna make that right  
Because I'm the prettiest cop on the block  
I set your souls on fire  
Yes, I'm the prettiest cop on the block  
I'm cool and I'm so mean  
I'm the prettiest cop on the block  
I've handcuffed your desire  
I've got a stiff reputation with a stick like a rock  
My kids are confused and my wife is in shock  
I must look pretty shocking  
In my bullet proof vest  
With my black lace stockings  
All this hair on my chest  
When the boys see me coming  
All the boys start to run  
They all got their empty holsters  
And I got the only gun  
Because I'm the prettiest cop on the block  
I set your souls on fire  
Yes, I'm the prettiest cop on the block  
Cool and I'm so mean  
Yes, I'm the prettiest cop on the block  
I handcuff your desires  
I got a stiff reputation with a stick like a rock  
My kids are confused and my wife is in shock  
I'm the prettiest cop on the block  
I set your souls on fire  
Yes, I'm the prettiest cop on the block  
And I'm cool, so mean  
I'm the prettiest cop on the block  
I handcuff your desires  
I'm so pretty, I'm so pretty, so pretty  
Yes, I'm gorgeous  
I'm really lovely  
And I'm so mean, so mean  
I'm ooh, I'm mean  
But I'm pretty and I'm mean  
So pretty but I'm mean  
And I'm pretty
