I Can't Love You Enough  
I'd crawl through the desert on my hands and knees without a drink of water  
Just for a chance of a little romance with that coal miner's daughter  
Yeah, if I was a poor girl beggin' in the street livin' crumb to crumb  
I'd turn down a 12-pound t-bone steak for a bum-bum-bum  
Love is all we feel  
Spinnin' like a wheel  
We let it roll  
Roll, I love you so  
When you walk that walk and you talk that talk  
I can't love you enough, I can't love you enough  
You've got a way of making me say  
I can't love you enough, I can't love you enough  
I'm never gonna give you up  
I can't love you enough  
Hey Conway, you're my Mississippi man  
You're really gettin' to me fast  
Every time we kiss it burns so deep  
It just lasts and lasts and lasts  
Loretta my love for you is strong  
I wouldn't sell it for a million dollars  
I know I belong here singin' this song  
With that girl from Butcher Hollow
