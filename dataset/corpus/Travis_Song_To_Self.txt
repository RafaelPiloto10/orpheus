Singing a song to myself  
I'm singing a song to myself  
  
Pictures in your mind  
Out of focus and unkind  
Picture me  
I picture you  
Outside the sun is shining  
At the back of your mind there's a memory  
  
By the time you hear this I'll be gone  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm singing a song to myself  
Cause I don't belong any longer  
Just making it up in my head  
This feeling is strong and getting stronger  
Do you see the light?  
Tell me you see the light  
Just making it up in my head  
Cause I need someone to sing along with  
  
Sing along with  
  
Pictures in your heart  
Out of focus torn apart  
Picture me  
I picture you  
Outside the moon is shining  
At the back of your mind there's a memory  
  
By the time you hear this I'll be gone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sing along with,  
Yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Singing a song to myself
