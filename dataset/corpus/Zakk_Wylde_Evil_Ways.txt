Sittin', sippin' sorrow  
It's gone straight to my head  
I say the pain shall come and it shall go  
A friend once said  
You ain't livin' for no God, no  
You be livin' for the dollar sign  
I say a frown upon your makers face  
You shall find  
So, ooh, so much wrong  
You have tried, oh, yeah  
I waited far  
Ooh, far too long, yeah  
Talking about your evil ways  
And the pen that wrote this song  
I'm talking about your evil ways  
And the pen that wrote this song  
Wanting to know nothing  
Living through a child's eyes  
A smile comes upon your face  
As I break and cry  
If nothing seems to matter  
In the end what are you doin' it for  
To see the trail of twisted broken souls  
Across the floor  
So, ooh, so much wrong, yeah  
You've done tried, oh, yeah  
I waited far  
Lord, I waited far too long  
(Yeah)  
Talking about your evil ways  
And the pen that wrote this song  
I'm talking about your evil ways  
And the pen that wrote this song  
Ooh, so much wrong, child  
You done tried, oh, yeah  
I waited far  
Lord, I waited far too long, yeah  
Talking about your evil ways  
And the pen that wrote this song  
I'm talking about your evil ways  
And the pen that wrote this song, yeah  
Talking about your evil ways  
And the pen that wrote this song  
I'm talking about your evil ways  
And the pen that wrote this song, oh yeah
