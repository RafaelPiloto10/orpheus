They come from the cities  
And they come from the smaller towns  
Beat up cars with guitars and drummers  
Goin crack boom bam  
  
[Chorus]  
R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A.  
R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A.  
R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A., Yeah, Yeah!  
Rockin' in the U.S.A.  
  
Said goodbye to their families  
Said goodbye to their friends  
With pipe dreams in their heads  
And very little money in their hands  
Some are black and some are white  
Ain't to proud to sleep on the floor tonight  
With the blind faith of Jesus you know that they just might, be  
Rockin' in the U.S.A.  
Hey!  
  
Voices from nowhere  
And voices from the larger towns  
Filled our head full of dreams  
Turned the world upside down  
  
There was Frankie Lyman-Bobby Fuller-Mitch Ryder  
(They were Rockin')  
Jackie Wilson-Shangra-las-Young Rascals  
(They were Rockin')  
Spotlight on Martha Reeves  
Let's don't forget James Brown  
Rockin' in the U.S.A.  
Rockin' in the U.S.A.  
Hey!  
  
[Chorus]
