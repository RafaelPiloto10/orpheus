You know they played that melody the first time that you danced with me  
And way back then I didn't even know the words  
Then they played that song again when our love came to an end  
It was the saddest happy song I ever heard  
  
What a song what a song you know I've heard it for so long  
You know it seems to be the theme song from my whole life  
A simple tune simple lines but every time it comes to mind  
I always think oh what a song what a song  
  
Well I don't know who made it up I only know the way it touched  
The very heart and soul of me with every note  
When everything it said and done when all the other songs're sung  
I hope they play the greatest song they ever wrote  
What a song what a song...
