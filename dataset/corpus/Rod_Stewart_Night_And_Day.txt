Night and day, you are the one  
Only you beneath the moon and under the sun  
Whether near to me, or far  
It's no matter darling where you are  
I think of you  
  
Night and day, day and night, why is it so  
That this longing for you follows wherever I go  
In the roaring traffic's boom  
In the silence of my lonely room  
I think of you  
  
Night and day, night and day  
Under the hide of me  
There's an oh such a hungry yearning burning inside of me  
And this torment won't be through  
'Til you let me spend my life making love to you  
  
Day and night, night and day  
Whether near to me, or far  
It's no matter darling where you are  
I think of you  
  
Night and day, night and day  
Under the hide of me  
There's an oh such a hungry yearning burning inside of me  
And this torment won't be through  
'Til you let me spend my life making love to you  
  
Day and night, night and day  
I think of you  
Night and day, and day
