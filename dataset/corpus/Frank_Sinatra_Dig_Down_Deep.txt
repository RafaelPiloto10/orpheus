You better get up and do it now, you better get up, my friend, and how,  
The land that you love the best, is asking you to invest,  
With a personal request from mr. morgenthau.  
Dig down deep, to buy the bonds that buy the tanks,  
Palmers for our fighting yanks, dig down deep.  
Dig down deep to buy the bonds that keep us free, supply the sky, the land and
sea,  
Dig down deep. put your hand on your gismo, citizen, everybody must do his
part,  
It's the easiest piece that the citizen to show the world we finish what we
start,  
Dig down deep, the boys are giving all for you, so the least that you can do,  
Is dig down deep.
