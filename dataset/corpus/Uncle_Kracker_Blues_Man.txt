Hey What 'chu tryin' to do  
Why you tryin' to see through me baby  
It's way too hazy  
Hey I'm still feelin' the same  
So don't go tryin' to change me baby  
You can't save me  
So many people try to bring me down  
They wouldn't last a second in my town  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey I've always been a blues man  
Hey I little rhythm and blues man  
Don't try walkin' inside my shoes  
Unless you're puttin' up somethin' to lose  
I said Hey I've always been a blues man  
Hey a little rhythm and blues man  
Don't try walkin' inside my shoes tonight  
  
You stem so far from the truth  
You hide inside all your talkin' papers  
Flashin' statements  
You never put your money down  
And watched a big wheel go around and take it  
And in remake it  
All you do is follow me around  
Then you go ahead and ride it down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't try walkin' inside my shoes  
Unless you're puttin' up somethin' to lose  
I said don't try walkin' inside my shoes baby baby  
I said Hey I've always been a blues man  
Hey a little rhythm and blues man  
Don't try walkin' inside my shoes  
Unless your puttin' up somethin' to lose  
I said Hey I've always been a blues man  
Hey A little rhythm and blues man  
Don't try walkin' inside my shoes  
Unless your unless your unless your  
Hey I've always been a blues man  
Hey A little rhythm and blues man  
Don't try walkin' inside my shoes tonight
