Don't fear the morning  
It's okay  
It's okay  
Hurt weighs heavy  
It's okay  
It's okay  
  
When your body's  
Cold and shaking  
I'll steal you, darling,  
Steal you  
And when your body's  
Old and aging  
I'll heal you, darling,  
Heal you  
  
[Chorus]  
Your soul lights the day  
I'm on my way  
I'm on my way  
When your soul filled with pain  
I'm on my way  
I'm on my way  
Well maybe, baby, it's just me  
  
Look out the window  
Past the pines  
Through the rain  
Oh, skies will open  
Let sun shine  
On your face  
And when your mind is  
Old and fading  
I'll heal you, darling,  
Heal you  
  
Your soul lights the day  
I'm on my way  
I'm on my way  
When your soul filled with pain  
I'm on my way  
I'm on my way  
Maybe, baby, it's just me  
Maybe, baby it's just  
  
In a matter of  
In a matter of days  
We'll find love  
Yeah, in a matter of  
In a matter of days  
We'll find love  
  
Well maybe, baby, that's just love  
And maybe, baby, it's just me  
  
[Chorus'  
  
And it's going to get easier on you  
And it's going to get easier on you  
And it's going to get easier on you  
Now it's got to get easier on your soul  
  
Soul [Repeat: x 3]  
  
Your soul lights the way  
Lights the way  
I'm on my way  
Well maybe, baby, it's just me
