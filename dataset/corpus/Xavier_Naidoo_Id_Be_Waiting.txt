I'd be waiting, waiting for a lifetime I'm sure  
I'd be waiting, waiting for a lifetime and more  
  
If that serious alliance lies ahead  
Let every necessary word be said  
Remembering the blood that we've shed  
Keep it mind that there are things we must forget  
  
Beware of tragedy left right and center  
Don't allow hell on earth to enter  
Get rid off all the damage in your head  
Remember there's an enemy in your bed  
  
The jokes on me for sure  
But then wishes and hopes come true for sure  
It's you for sure, out of the blue for sure  
It's you for your past rich and poor towards  
That hard encore  
  
I've walked on the African sands like the Kosan  
The original man from lands sacred  
Battled Zulu tribes for the passion of word play and swam  
The Zambezi butt naked  
  
Seen the sun rise in the east and set in the west  
Plotted stars charts and directions for god to manifest  
From the peaks of the pyramids I left tags in dark gaves  
That gave humanity clues on how to star gaze  
  
I've seen a snake shed its skin like the seasons and change  
I've seen world re-arrange in a flash  
Now for this cash they rape our lands strictly for wealth  
It's left me stranded in a spiritual realm all by myself  
  
Headed to mecca I stopped and spoke swahm with tribes  
Chanted native dialects over the hill I felt vibes  
Threw my hands in the sky then beat them hard on a  
Drum over the horizon I waited for freedom to come  
  
But the ships just keep sailing and whips just keep cracking  
I wonder where I am so I begin back tracking through the  
Solomonic dynasty I read the kebra tr took mt swift  
Across the mains like I was riding on a zebra the Ashante  
Draped me in robes or royalty the shona tribe blessed me-acapo
