See the features of my rage  
Begin to shoot the fiend without a face  
My face  
  
The fever rots  
The brain goes numb inside  
I feel the blackout coming  
A boiled blister pops inside  
  
My ears still bleed  
With razor-sharp precision  
Mouths that mouth the sweetness  
Dank of final breath upon my chest  
  
See the features of my rage  
Begin to shoot the fiend without a face  
My face  
  
We lasted all night  
The dogs keep up and snickering  
Just stay with me one moment  
Then I'll go away  
  
My ears still bleed  
With razor-sharp precision  
I'll burn in hell  
Before I plunge into life's darkness  
Darkness  
  
See the features of my rage  
Begin to shoot the fiend without a face  
See the features of my rage  
Begin to shoot the fiend without a face  
My face  
  
A fiend without a face  
A fiend without a face  
A fiend without a face  
A fiend without a face
