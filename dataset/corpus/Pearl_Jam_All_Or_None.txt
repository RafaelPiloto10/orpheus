It's a hopeless situation  
And I'm starting to believe  
That this hopeless situation  
Is what I'm trying to achieve  
But I try to run on  
It's all or none  
All or none...  
Here's the selfless confession  
Leading me back to war  
Can we help that our destinations  
Are the ones we've been before?  
I still try to run on  
But it's all or none  
All or none...  
To myself, I surrender  
To the one I'll never please  
But I still try to run on  
No, I still try to run on  
But it's all or none  
All or none...
