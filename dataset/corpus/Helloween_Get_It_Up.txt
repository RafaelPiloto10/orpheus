A little thing you sure will know  
Why you came here tonight  
And not to those other places  
I could imagine there's PCs and DVDs  
And TV shows  
And sex in cars what else you like  
Now right here is the place I got to be  
Tomorrow I'll be far away  
If you got time and nothing else to do now  
Together we can change the world  
  
Lets get it up  
Rock's here to stay  
With the best years of our lives we paid our share,  
Yeah, yeah  
Now tell me what is in our way  
To push this right in the face every day  
  
We spread it further, on the town  
Now, what d'ya know we're good  
To incite a few more disciples  
No tie to waste makin' haste we're movin' on  
Where we'll suspend another night  
  
Do I see grinning faces all round here?  
And is this due to my words  
Come treat me nice, why'know, I wasn't raised here  
But I mean everything I say  
  
Lets get it up  
Rock's here to stay  
With the best years of our lives  
We paid our share yeah yeah  
Now tell me what is in our way  
To push this right in the face everyday
