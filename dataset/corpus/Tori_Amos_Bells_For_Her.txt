And through the life force and there goes her friend  
On her Nishiki it's out of time  
And through the portal they can make amends  
  
Hey would you say whatever we're blanket friends  
Can't stop what's coming  
Can't stop what's on its way  
  
And through the walls they made their mudpies  
I've got your mind I said  
She said I've your voice  
I said you don't need my voice girl  
You have your own  
But you never thought it was enough of  
So they went years and years  
Like sisters blanket girls  
Always there through that and this  
There's nothing we cannot ever fix I said  
  
Can't stop what's coming  
Can't stop what's on its way  
Bells and footfalls and soldiers and dolls  
Brothers and lovers she and I were  
Now she seems to be sand under his shoes  
There's nothing I can do  
Can't stop what's coming  
Can't stop what's on its way  
  
And now I speak to you are you in there  
You have her face and her eyes  
But you are not her  
And we go at each other like blank ettes  
Who can't find their thread and their bare  
  
Can't stop loving  
Can't stop what is on its way  
And I see it coming  
And it's on its way
