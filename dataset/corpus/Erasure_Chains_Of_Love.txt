How can I explain  
When there are few words I can choose  
How can I explain  
When words get broken  
  
Do you remember  
There was a time ahaha  
When people on the street  
We're walking hand in hand in hand  
They used to talk about the weather  
Making plans together  
Days would last forever  
  
Come to me, cover, hold me  
Together we'll break these chains of love  
Don't give up, don't give up  
Together with me and my baby  
Break the chains of love  
  
Do you remember  
Once upon a time ahaha  
When there were open doors  
An invitation to the world  
We were falling in and out with lovers  
Looking out for others  
Our sisters and our brothers  
  
Come to me, cover me, hold me  
Together we'll break these chains of love  
Don't give up, don't give up now  
Together with me and my baby  
Break the chains of love  
Together we'll break these chains of love  
  
How can I explain  
When there are few words I can choose  
How can I explain  
When words get broken
