Someone told me long ago  
They were gone before the storm  
I know, it's been coming for sometime  
Be it so, and so I say  
Little rain and sun by day  
I know, shining down like water  
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain  
Coming down, down this day  
Coming down, down this day  
Yes for days and days before  
So there's is rain and cold is hot  
I know, in this place got all my found  
Through the circles fast and slow  
There for every moment goes  
I know, I can't stop, I wonder  
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain  
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain  
Coming down, down this day  
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain  
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain  
Coming down, down this day
