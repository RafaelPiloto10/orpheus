I walk this mile  
Like anyone  
What could be found  
In this sweet damaged smile  
Weh heh heh  
We are lost, we are found  
We are thrown together  
  
Weh heh heh  
Would you take my hand  
  
Weh heh  
Would you take my hand  
  
I walk this mile  
Like anyone  
What could be found  
In this sweet damaged smile  
  
The cage is found  
Fools gold inside  
Is there a key to the  
Bars of the mind  
  
Ahhh  
We are lost, we are found  
We are thrown together  
  
Ah hah hah  
Would you take my hand  
  
You look for love  
You just get skin  
You turn around  
And the changes begin  
  
We are lost, we are found  
We are thrown together  
  
Ah hah hah  
Won't you take my hand  
  
Takes a second for your world to change  
Satisfactions what you give away  
Sucks you in and spits you out again  
Picks you up and drives you down again  
  
Takes a second for the world to change  
Sucks you in and spits you out again  
Throws you down and picks you up again  
Satisfactions what you give away  
  
Takes a second for your world to change  
Satisfactions what you give away  
  
Ah hah hah  
We are lost, we are found  
We are thrown together  
Won't you take my hand  
  
Would you take my hand  
Would you take my hand
