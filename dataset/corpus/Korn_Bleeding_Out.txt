I'm staring at a face  
I don't recognize  
Rotten and replaced  
Lifeless and benign  
You can never say  
That I didn't try  
I can not erase  
What's in my mind  
  
I'm the one to give to you  
I'm the one to break you through  
Anything you ever do will  
Eat you up and impale you  
  
I'm bleeding out  
Been crucified by trusting you  
Hate turns to shame  
By praising you, adoring fool  
I'm the one that set you free  
Bound to burn for eternity 'cause  
I'm bleeding out  
You're never there when I need you  
  
My thoughts they interlace  
Been spun out for sometime  
I wander in this maze  
An act that is sublime  
You can never say  
That I didn't try  
I cannot erase  
What's in my mind  
  
I'm the one to give to you  
I'm the one to break you through  
Anything you ever do will  
Eat you up and impale you  
  
I'm bleeding out  
Been crucified by trusting you  
Hate turns to shame  
By praising you, adoring fool  
I'm the one that set you free  
Bound to burn for eternity 'cause  
I'm bleeding out  
You're never there when I need you  
  
I'm bleeding out  
Been crucified by trusting you  
Hate turns to shame  
By praising you, adoring fool  
I'm the one that set you free  
Bound to burn for eternity 'cause  
I'm bleeding out  
You're never there when I need you
