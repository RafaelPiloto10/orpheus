By the time you read this letter  
I'll be outta your life  
Gone forever more  
But guess I'll survive  
I'm gonna leave my records  
And a forwarding address  
Ain't you glad honey  
That I'm offa your chest  
  
You said you wanted Paris  
Rome 'n' St. Tropez  
Perfume by Chanel  
And a ring by Cartier  
But I gave you headaches  
With my old fashioned ways  
But that's all irrelevant  
To what I'm tryin' to say  
I'm a fool for you baby  
Pride won't let me stay  
I'm a fool for you honey  
and I'll come back any day  
Guess I'll always love you all my life  
  
You can keep your Streisands  
Bardots and Lorens  
You're my everything  
But now you're my end  
It may be over  
But just before I go  
I can make a new start  
But I can't mend a broken heart  
  
So when I read about you  
In all the national press  
On the arm of so and so  
I may get depressed  
Cause I tried to love you  
But didn't fit in  
I came on the dust  
I'll leave on the wind  
  
I'm a fool for you baby  
My pride won't let me stay  
I'm a fool for you honey  
I'll come back any day  
I'm a fool for you baby  
I don't care what your friends say  
I'm a fool for you honey  
And that's the way I'll stay  
I guess I'll always love you all my life
