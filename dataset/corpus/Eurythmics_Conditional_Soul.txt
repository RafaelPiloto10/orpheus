(When will you make up your mind?)  
Darling just be yourself tonight.  
There's nothing wrong with the way you feel.  
The moon and stars are in the sky.  
We're centuries apart  
And the lights are shining down on you.  
(I can't stand it)  
Everybody's kissing someone.  
Holding hands just to get some fun.  
I couldn't care less if I ever get none.  
Or never fall into some lover's arms again.  
(I can't stand it)  
Aah... Conditioned soul  
When will you make up your mind?  
(I can't stand it)  
Aah... Conditioned soul  
When will you make up your mind?  
(I can't stand it)  
Darling don't be afraid tonight.  
Something's wrong with the way you feel.  
The moon and stars have all gone by.  
We're centuries apart and the lights are dying.  
Everybody's hurting someone.  
Stabbing back just to get some fun.  
I hope to God I don't get me none.  
Or never fall into some killer's arms again.  
When will you make up your mind?  
(I can't stand it)
