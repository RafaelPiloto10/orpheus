Back in the days of covered wagons  
A man had his own way  
Whether talkin' to a woman  
Or crossing the you. S. A.  
No telephones were ringing  
No angry words exchanged.  
I wish I was back in the saddle now  
Riding on the range.  
  
Let your fingers do the walking  
Call me up some time  
I'm listed under Broken Hearts  
Looking for a good time.  
I can't reach out and touch you  
You're hung up on the line  
I'm your disconnected number now  
And you're a private line.  
  
Well, I used to be so happy,  
When you gave good 'phone.  
I could call you up from anywhere  
For a little bit of home  
But now my heart is aching  
After every call  
By the way you talk you'd think  
You never gave good 'phone at all.  
  
Let your fingers do the walking  
Call me up some time  
I'm listed under Broken Hearts  
Looking for a good time.  
I can't reach out and touch you  
You're hung up on the line  
I'm your disconnected number now  
And you're a private line.  
  
Let your fingers do the walking  
Call me up some time  
I'm listed under Broken Hearts.  
Looking for a good time.  
I can't reach out and touch you  
You're hung up on the line  
I'm your disconnected number now  
And you're a private line.
