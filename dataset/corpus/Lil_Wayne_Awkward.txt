See we ain't got much in common  
So we don't do that much talking  
Sometimes it feels so awkward  
She watch me take a shower  
I asked her why she didn't join me  
She said because you didn't ask me  
I said damn I didn't think I had to  
Then she take off my towel and I take off her blouse  
I tell her that that pussy for me just in case she thought it was ours  
And she say cool  
  
And if you like it I love it  
If she like it I love it  
  
See we ain't got much in common  
So we don't do that much talking  
'cause every time she try to tell me something  
She open up her mouth and I stick my tongue in  
She got a piercing in her vagina  
A skirt with nothing under  
  
And she say when she don't see me  
She feel like stevie wonder
