And so they came with perfect schemes  
And precious dreams that made them one  
One by one  
  
Oh, and there they stood lost in the haze  
With spirits blazing like the sun  
Mothers and daughters,  
Fathers and sons  
  
They held the light  
Yes they did  
And it shined all night  
Oh, all night  
And they took the blows  
Yes they did  
Never letting go  
Oh no, oh no  
Oh no  
  
And so they came with perfect schemes  
And precious dreams that made them one  
One by one  
  
Oh, look up and see the eagles fly  
And fill the sky beneath the sun  
Mothers and daughters,  
Fathers and sons  
  
You hold the light  
Yes you do  
And you've got the right  
Oh, got the right  
And you'll feel the blows  
Yes you will  
Don't you dare let go  
Oh no, oh no  
  
Said that we have the right  
Yes we do  
It's down in black and white  
Oh oh, oh oh  
  
And we made it so  
Yes we did  
And we won't let go  
Oh no, oh no
