The path is clear  
Though no eyes can see  
The course laid down long before.  
And so with gods and men  
The sheep remain inside their pen,  
Though many times they've seen the way to leave.  
  
He rides majestic  
Past hordes of men  
Who care not or gaze with joy,  
To see reflected there  
The trees, the sky, the lily fair,  
The scene of death is lying just below.  
  
The mountain cuts off the town from view,  
Like a cancer growth is removed by skill.  
Let it be revealed.  
A waterfall, his madrigal.  
An inland sea, his symphony.  
  
Undinal songs  
Urge the sailors on  
Till lured by sirens' cry.  
  
Now as the river dissolves in sea,  
So Neptune has claimed another soul.  
And so with gods and men  
The sheep remain inside their pen,  
Until the shepherd leads his flock away.  
  
The sands of time were eroded by  
The river of constant change.
