Baby, oh, baby  
  
Tell the man at the ticket stand  
That you've changed your mind  
Well, let me run on out and tell the cab  
To keep the meter flying  
  
'Cause if you say goodbye to me, baby  
You know you're gonna break my mind  
  
Break my mind, break my mind  
I know I just can't stand to hear  
The big jet engines whine  
  
Break my mind, break my mind, oh, Lord  
If you leave you're gonna leave  
A babbling fool behind  
  
Baby, oh, baby  
  
Let me take your suitcase off  
Of them scales in time  
Tell the man that you suddenly developed  
A thing about flying  
  
'Cause if you say goodbye to me, baby  
You know you're gonna break my mind  
  
Break my mind, break my mind  
I know I just can't stand to hear  
The big jet engines whine  
  
Break my mind, break my mind, oh, Lord  
'Cause if you leave you're gonna leave  
A babbling fool behind  
  
Break my mind, break my mind  
I know, I just can't stand to hear  
The big jet engines whine  
  
Break my mind, break my mind, oh, Lord  
If you leave you're gonna leave  
A babbling fool behind  
  
If you leave you're gonna leave yourself  
A babbling fool behind  
If you leave you're gonna leave  
A babbling fool behind
