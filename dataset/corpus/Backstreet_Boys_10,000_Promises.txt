Once we were lovers just lovers we were  
Oh, what a life  
Once we were dreamers just dreamers we were  
Oh, you and I  
Now I see you're just somebody who wastes all my time and money  
What a lie, you and I  
  
[Chorus]  
What about your  
Your 10,000 promises?  
That you gave to me  
Your 10,000 promises  
That you promised me  
  
Once I could handle the truth  
When the truth was you and I  
But time after time all the  
Promises turned out to be all lies  
Now I see I'm just somebody who wasted my time and money  
What a lie (what a lie, what a lie, oh)  
You and I  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You said "I'll take you back"  
But I closed the door 'cause I don't want  
10,000 more  
Oh  
  
10,000 promises yeah (oh)  
10,000 promises you gave to me  
  
Repeat chorus  
What about your 10,000 promises?  
You gave to me (That you gave to me)  
What about your 10,000 promises?  
You gave to me  
Once we were lovers just lovers we were  
Oh you and I  
What a lie
