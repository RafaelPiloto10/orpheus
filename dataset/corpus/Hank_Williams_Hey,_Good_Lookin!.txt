Say hey, good lookin' whatcha got cookin'?  
How's about cookin' something up with me?  
Hey, sweet baby don't you think maybe  
We can find us a brand new recipe?  
  
I got a hot rod ford and a two dollar bill  
And I know a spot right over the hill  
There's soda pop and the dancin's free  
So if you want to have fun come along with me.  
  
Hey, good lookin' whatcha got cookin'?  
How's about cookin' something up with me?  
  
I'm free and ready so we can go steady  
How's about saving all your time for me  
No more lookin' I know I been cookin'  
How's about keepin' steady company?  
  
I'm gonna throw my date book over the fence  
And find me one for five or ten cents  
I'll keep it 'til it's covered with age  
'Cause I'm writin' your name down on ev'ry page.  
  
Say hey, good lookin' whatcha got cookin'?  
How's about cookin' something up with me?
