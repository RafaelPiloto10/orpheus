What happened?  
Wake up in the morning,  
Clock says half past one  
I have no sunglasses  
As I step into the sun  
  
There's no recollection  
Of the evil things I've done  
My head feels like I musta had some fun  
  
What happened?  
  
Last thing I remember  
I was chillin' at a party  
Pinching girlies' asses  
I was drinking recklessly  
  
I know I did something  
Lord what could it be  
Woke up in the morning  
And all my friends hate me  
  
What happened?  
  
What I'm I doing here  
Who is this girl in my bed  
What is this shit on my face  
My God, what is that awful smell  
  
[Chorus]  
She may be an angel  
She may be a queen  
She might be black, white, American, Indian or Japanese  
Through a bottle at a bouncer  
Didn't think that he was cool  
Pissed in someones drink  
And through a bike into a pool  
  
Driven down the side walk  
Like a crazy possessed fool  
I broke every single traffic rule.  
  
What happened?  
What happened?  
  
Let's go  
  
[Chorus]
