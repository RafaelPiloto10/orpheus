You know what I want, I know what you don't  
I should be the one you love uh  
Boy you got my mind, playing truth or dare  
Daring me kiss you right here  
  
Though we've been friends so long, and it seems so wrong  
And everyone can see, you're perfect for me  
But I just can't let it show  
  
I've been thinking about you  
Boy it's killing me and I got to let you know  
Baby tell me, don't you feel it like I do  
Cause we both know what could go down if we got too close  
(ah, hah, ha)  
Down if we get too close  
(ah, hah, ha)  
Down if we get too close  
  
  
Remember that girl, that you used to date  
She with my ex-boyfriend, that's great  
So what would you do? What would you say?  
If I said I loved you [?]  
  
Though we've been friends so long, and it seems so wrong

(ah, hah, ha)  
Down if we get too close
