  
  
Well I'm reading this poem  
  
and it's so profound  
  
and I like its rhythm  
  
and I like its sound  
  
it's by a very famous poet  
  
no critic can criticise  
  
and then I pause a moment  
  
and I start to realize  
  
he's tellin'  
  
lies lies lies  
  
on the motel TV.  
  
I dig the evangelist  
  
he'll tell you all about that  
  
and then he tell you all about this  
  
he's preachin' up a storm  
  
by the sea of Galilee  
  
he's mixin' up the truth  
  
with something funny I start to see  
  
he's tellin'  
  
lies lies lies  
  
I never had this problem  
  
with nobody in the government  
  
I guess I always figured  
  
they never mean what they meant  
  
and GOD help us all  
  
not to be so stone surprised  
  
when we wake up in the stars  
  
with the skies in our eyes  
  
if we keep tellin'  
  
lies lies lies
