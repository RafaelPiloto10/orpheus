Ladies and gentleman,  
Today is a day for mourning and remembering  
They had a hunger to explore the universe  
And discover its truths and  
They had that special grace  
That special spirit that says give me a challenge  
And I'll meet it with joy  
  
The crew of the space shuttle challenger  
Honored us in the manner  
Of which they lived their lives  
We will never forget them  
As they prepared for their journey  
And waved goodbye  
And they slipped the surly of earth  
To touch the face of God.
