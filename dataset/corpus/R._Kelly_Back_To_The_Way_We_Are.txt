Oh, yeah!  
Girl I'm missing you, yeah!  
Who... Missing you?  
Let's go back to the way, back to the way you were!  
Let's go back to the way, back to the way you were!  
Let's go back to the way, back to the way you were!  
Do you remember the time that we fell in love?  
  
Girl, I hope you're lying next to me when I wake up!  
Hope you're in the bathroom, taking a shower, girl when I wake up!  
I say I hope you're in the kitchen, girl when I wake up!  
Cause if you're no there...
