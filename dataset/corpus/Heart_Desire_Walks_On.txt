Stand at the window  
Pull back the lace  
I feel the night wind on my face  
All that I long for - all that I crave  
Am I master, Am I slave?  
The night's so still  
I feel the lovers out in the hills  
The breathing of young girls lying in bed  
Visions of love in their heads  
Desire walks on  
Desire walks on  
A beautiful boy gazed in a pool  
His eyes looking back like jewels  
The call of the mirror - too strong to resist  
The call of the water - the call of a kiss  
Desire walks on  
Desire walks on  
It wants to be held - possessed  
It wants consummation  
It moves on obsessed  
Bloodstream through pipes  
Singing in the wires  
Heat - motion - control  
Desire walks on  
Stand at the window  
The world is so still  
Calling you back by force of will  
Where did you go?  
I don't know why  
Too much longing inside  
You wrapped me in nighttime sexual disguise  
I was the love in your eyes  
You took me over  
My innocence cracked  
You own my passion  
I want you back  
Desire walks on  
Desire walks on
