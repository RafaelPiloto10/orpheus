Whiteboy gettin ready to do his thing  
Uh...Uh...Uh...Uh...Uh...Uh  
Here's a new jam for you to cling to  
A funky rhythm that you can swing to  
  
Kid Rock that's me  
And the party jumpin is what I'm for seeing  
So just chill or I'll boot you  
Get on me and I'll shoot you  
  
I'm fresh to that there's no guessin  
Rock the mic without any fessin  
With your blessin  
I will get stupid, you didn't know it  
  
I thought you knew it  
I'm the kid that comes exactin  
With my ace the black man  
Two b-boys from the Midwest  
  
Rock the shows 'Cause were professionals  
On the set night and day while the girls say  
  
The Upside Down  
Can't you turn me inside out  
And round and round  
The Upside Down  
Can't you turn me inside out  
And round and round  
  
The bass drops and works its hardest  
For Kid Rock the new young rap artist  
Clockin' paper 'cause I got soul  
Comin' at you from the Motor capital  
  
Shakin' booties  
Not all the cuties  
I'm too cool to be a little fruity  
Drinkin' forties every weekend  
  
I'm the master who's always speakin  
To some freak and if I freak her  
Its at Red Roof Inn where we sleep cheaper  
But off that topic got to get it  
  
Super dope, extremely poetic  
The K-I-D-are-O-see-Kin  
I love girls that's how its layin  
With these jammies  
  
Fuck the grammies  
All I care about is shaking fannies  
And I have been doin it for a long time  
But now I'm nineteen  
  
And in my prime  
Waxin booties everyday while the girls say  
  
The Upside Down  
Can't you turn me inside out  
And round and round  
The Upside Down  
Can't you turn me inside out  
And round and round  
  
On the mico is solo  
'cause I'm the Kid with all the dope lingos  
Only rappin 'cause I don't sing dope  
Create a jam that's fresh in your bingo  
  
Lace up the Reebox  
Comb the high top  
Black dose with a little hip hop  
And I style it with some uniqueness  
  
You say I'm not fresh  
But I could careless  
When I rock the mic  
I'm your girl is likin  
  
? women are not lookin  
Create a beat that is fully hookin  
'Cause when I get dumb  
People ave fun  
  
? sisco hand me the magnum  
In a hell of a show I always display  
While the girls say  
The Upside Down  
  
Can't you turn me inside out  
And round and round  
The Upside Down  
Can't you turn me inside out  
And round and round  
  
Upside Kid Rock, Kid Rock  
He's on the upside  
Get down Kid Rock  
He's on the upside  
  
Get down Kid Rock  
On the Upside  
Upside, Upside get down Kid Rock  
Get on the Upside  
  
Get down Kid Rock  
Get on the Upside  
Get down Kid Rock  
Get on the Upside  
  
Upside, Kid Rock
