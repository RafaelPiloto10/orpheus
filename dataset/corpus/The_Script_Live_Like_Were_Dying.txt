Sometimes we fall down and can't get back up  
We're hiding behind skin that's too tough  
How come we don't say I love you enough  
Till it's too late, it's not too late  
  
Our hearts are hungry for a food that won't come  
We could make a feast from these crumbs  
And we're all staring down the barrel of a gun  
So if your life flashed before you  
What would you wish you would've done  
  
Yeah, gotta start  
Lookin' at the hand of the time we've been given here  
This is all we got and we gotta start thinkin'  
If every second counts on a clock that's tickin'  
Gotta live like we're dying  
  
Yeah, we got 86400 seconds in a day  
To turn it all around or throw it all away  
We gotta tell 'em that we love 'em  
While we got the chance to say  
Gotta live like we're dying  
  
And if your plane fell out of the skies  
Who would you call with your last goodbyes  
Should be so careful who we let fall out of our lives  
So when we long for absolution  
There'll be no one on the line  
  
Yeah, gotta start  
Lookin' at the hand of the time we've been given here  
This is all we got and we gotta start thinkin' if  
Every second counts on a clock that's tickin'  
Gotta live like we're dying  
  
We only got 86400 seconds in a day  
To turn it all around or throw it all away  
We gotta tell 'em that we love 'em  
While we got the chance to say  
Gotta live like we're dying  
  
Like we're dying, oh  
Like we're dying  
Like we're dying, oh  
Like we're dying  
  
We only got 86400 seconds in a day  
To turn it all around or throw it all away  
We gotta tell 'em that we love 'em  
While we got the chance to say  
Gotta live like we're dying  
  
You never know a good thing till it's gone  
You never see a crash until it's head on  
All these people right when we're dead wrong  
You never know a good thing till it's gone  
  
Yeah, gotta start  
Lookin' at the hand of the time we've been given here  
This is all we got and we gotta start thinkin' if  
Every second counts on a clock that's tickin'  
Gotta live like we're dying  
  
We only got 86400 seconds in a day  
To turn it all around or throw it all away  
We gotta tell 'em that we love 'em  
While we got the chance to say  
Gotta live like we're dying  
  
Like we're dying, oh  
Like we're dying  
Like we're dying, oh  
Like we're dying  
  
We only got 86400 seconds in a day  
To turn it all around or throw it all away  
We gotta tell 'em that we love 'em  
While we got the chance to say  
Gotta live like we're dying  
Live like we're dying
