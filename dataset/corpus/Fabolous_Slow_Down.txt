[Intro - Fabolous]  
I wanna be your number 1 fan, but from the stage  
Know it's hard to see way up in the stands  
  
I understand, but damn [x2]  
  
Wishing I could be that one man, but you juggle  
Way too many of them with one hand  
  
I understand, but damn [x2]  
  
[Verse 1 - fabolous]  
Yea, slow down baby, let me be your yellow light  
The way we met was wrong, let me say hello right  
You need a mellow night, a break from this ghetto life  
The way I roll make them haters wanna yellow dice  
She say what matters is that you keep them stilettos nice  
And when you slap this ass, it shake like jello, right?  
Well alright, roll them cigarellos tight  
I nicknamed her bape chicken and yellow rice  
Pretty brown skin, long blonde hair  
And she know they talking but she never gon' care  
Cause when you balling trash-talk is what you gon' hear  
I can't imagine what a fall upon lebron's ear  
Always been the girl that didn't have to wait in line  
Niggas buy her watches just for making time  
Fake say "give it up" never had to ask  
They call her the stick up girl that never wore a mask  
Baby, ain't you tired of life in this fast lane?  
Packing luggage, rushing, trying to catch that last plane?  
There's some dudes who take pride in trying to gas dames  
The same dudes will see her and give they last name  
Funny how I became the apple of her eye  
The game went south and I'm a rapper from ny  
Don't get me wrong: lil mama love "trap or die"  
But through it all she kept her watch on the dapper guy  
And fell in love with a 2009 verse  
She said before we met, I fucked her in her mind first  
We crossed paths, a mixture of karma and luck  
I walked in strong, mentally palming my nuts  
I got em swarming and stuck, she calm in the cut  
You know me? I can spot a swan from a duck  
My approach? Smoother than an armani tux  
The diamonds going off, like the alarm on a truck  
The small talk, warming her up, she palming her cup  
She told me that I make her laugh and I'm charming as fuck  
But for now she had to go, the chat just quickly changed  
She was chilling, now she leaving, I mean that was kinda strange  
Asked "can we meet again?" she said "that can be arranged"  
And I'm sure we both have phone numbers that can be exchanged  
We did, she slid, that'd a be explained  
But for now she hopped into a platinum-colored range  
  
[Trey songz]  
See baby, see you gotta get ur mind right while there's still time left.  
You know life, wanting vip sections and flight confirmations  
Jumpin start to star, got ur own constellation  
I aint tryna say dat you, shit, maybe I am  
Never follow ur heart  
Sure to lose your mind... If you neva follow ur heart...  
  
[Bridge:]  
You need to slow down... (yes baby you need to slow down) [x2]  
Slow down...  
You need to slow down  
You need to slow... You need to slow... You need to slow down  
You need to slow...  
Baby for real you need to slow it on... Slow it on down
