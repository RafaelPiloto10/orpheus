No mercy  
No mercy  
No mercy  
  
In the midnight hush, the restless hours between dark and light  
In dreams we come together underneath the cover of the night  
You're holding out, but I'm holding on  
Can't wait until your resistance is gone  
  
No mercy, accept no defeat  
No mercy, 'til you're here with me  
  
Now the pressure's on  
You can run away but you can't hide  
You might as well surrender,  
The walls are closing in on every side  
I'm getting closer, now, there's no escape  
Victory is written all over my face  
  
No mercy, accept no defeat  
No mercy, 'til you're here with me  
No mercy, I won't give in no!  
No mercy, 'til you let me in  
  
I won't take no for an answer  
I won't let go  
  
No mercy,  
No mercy, no  
Ohh oh  
No mercy,  
  
You're holding out, but I'm holding on  
Can't wait until your resistance is gone  
No mercy, accept no defeat  
No mercy, 'til you're here with me  
  
No mercy, until you let me in  
No mercy, no, I'll never give in  
No mercy, I won't let you go no!  
No mercy, and I want you to know, oh  
No mercy
