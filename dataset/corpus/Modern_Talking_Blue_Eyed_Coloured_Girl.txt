It's 5 o'clock, I think of you  
Live my life without you and I'm feeling blue  
I told you lies, love fades away  
Oh I loved you baby but didn't say  
It's 5 o'clock a lonely night  
And I just remember, we were side by side  
I made mistakes, you went away  
And now I know the words, I didn't say  
  
How can I fall in love  
With a blue eyed coloured baby girl  
How can you tell me, we can't be together, oh no  
  
The night is gone, I couldn't sleep  
I saw the old videos, I'll always keep  
Day in day out, I'm missing you  
Is there just a little chance, what I can do?  
The night is gone, I watched a star  
I have to face the future, oh you're so far  
Some lies are true  
Can we stay friends  
Tell me baby when will I see you again  
  
How can I fall in love  
With the girl with the golden hair  
How can you tell me, we can't be together, oh no
