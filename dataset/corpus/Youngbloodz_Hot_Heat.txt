Early mornin' to late night  
Gonna give it to ya', just like you like  
Lettin' this world know just what it be  
Look, shawty an' dem, lay you down with hot heat  
Forever grind on this here concrete  
You can quote every word that I speak  
Stay sharp, heavy starch in my crease  
An' spit this slang like a automatic piece  
I hear em' hollerin', ?Tell me what do we wanna do??  
We finna' act a fool, Youngblood, dat Attic Crew  
We keep it movin' on these suckers in an' outta town  
Caught 'em slippin' on that corner, lil' shawty draw down  
S.W.A.T.s, mean mugs an' thugs  
The art of money makin', murder, murder an' drugs  
Hear what I say, don't play no games, this automatic hit ya'  
They say these ladies shady, baby, keep your pistol witcha  
Jump out four doors, let me get that there  
Partna, leave it where you standin', sucka get somewhere  
Lil' shawty, shake some, lil' shawty, take some  
Shoot a G, bet a G, I say, I break some  
Gotta get 'em, split 'em, let this hot heat penetrate 'em  
My lil' buddies drop 'em on the spot, no hesitation  
Better know 'bout that, we leave 'em stuck like four flat  
Gear it up, you seen this here before black  
Early mornin' to late night  
Gonna give it to ya', just like you like  
Lettin' this world know just what it be  
Look, shawty an' dem, lay you down with hot heat  
Forever grind on this here concrete  
You can quote every word that I speak  
Stay sharp, heavy starch in my crease  
An' spit this slang like a automatic piece  
You on your last an' only way of ever livin'  
An' it's forbidden to even mention on what your life is riskin'  
Gettin' fold, now whether you know, see you S.O.S  
Put an S on your chest, see it ain't nothin' less unless you confess  
An' go tell the rest on what is real, what is flawed  
Where you been an' who you saw, nigga, naw  
We won't fall for no broad an' all because see, we gonna pause  
In the night, see they gonna crawl, so listen when we hit ya'  
Comin' dead off to you fuckin' raw  
Like underdogs, see, we gonna win, never was you just a friend  
From way back when count to ten, now this shit is 'bout to end  
So suck it in an' get a grip, make your move an' make it quick  
Before you snooze, you gon' lose, dwellin' on that other shit  
Early mornin' to late night  
Gonna give it to ya', just like you like  
Lettin' this world know just what it be  
Look, shawty an' dem, lay you down with hot heat  
Forever grind on this here concrete  
You can quote every word that I speak  
Stay sharp, heavy starch in my crease  
An' spit this slang like a automatic piece  
Now let me tell you how it go, man, shackled like the chain gang  
Stuck off in this range, trappin', tryin' to snap my chain, man  
Here, it's an ugly thang, I'm back on these streets again  
Own the strength, I'm known to limp, everythin' is against da grain  
Can't you tell? ATL, sack it up, make it sale  
Fat sacs keep 'em comin' back, now they shop with Pelle  
Pelle, big time playa, never scared, hill-top nigga, never fell  
Terroristic threats, shawty, tell 'em that this here death or trill  
Ain't no time, fuck around with crime, strap it up, sack up them dimes  
Chill the Mo',[Incomprehensible] Billy Dee drankin', everyday livin' fine  
Constantly stay on the grind, niggas, they don't fuck with mine  
Hit 'em hard, one hit caught, the other two times can't fuck with mine  
Early mornin' to late night  
Gonna give it to ya', just like you like  
Lettin' this world know just what it be  
Look, shawty an' dem, lay you down with hot heat  
Forever grind on this here concrete  
You can quote every word that I speak  
Stay sharp, heavy starch in my crease  
An' spit this slang like a automatic piece
