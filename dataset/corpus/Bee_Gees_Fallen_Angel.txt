Fool in the night on the stair,  
With the light by the window.  
Out in the jungle of life she was  
Yearning to go.  
  
All of the years I've been there for the tears  
She will sell you.  
Out in the city she search for the face  
That she knew.  
  
Did you believe that a love so alive could be over?  
  
[Chorus:]  
Caroline,  
Fallen Angel.  
Caroline.  
Oh oh oh,  
Fallen Angel,  
I'm so lost,  
Tonight, lonely tonight.  
Lonely tonight.  
  
Fool is the father who clings to the  
Child he is losing.  
Mother too weary to question  
The wisdom of youth.  
  
There with your head in your handa  
As you pray to her picture.  
Out in the rain she would search  
For somebody to hold.  
  
Did you believe you could find  
What you need with a stranger?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Did you believe that a love so alive could be over?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Caroline,  
Fallen Angel
