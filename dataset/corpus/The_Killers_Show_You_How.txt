Ha  
I gotta tell ya  
I'll make it better  
But I know there's somethin' I needed to say  
When I was out, though  
Maybe you were better alone  
I know I'll make it home  
  
She told me sweet thang  
Run a labour  
In your shoes  
Touch me til I follow in love  
I wanna help her  
Maybe we were better alone  
I wanna show you how  
  
And then we walked out  
Make it made now  
I said I want it but I never alone  
I wanna show you  
Maybe we were somethin' uncool  
I wanna make you sing  
  
Uh uh oh  
Uh uh oh  
Uh uh oh
