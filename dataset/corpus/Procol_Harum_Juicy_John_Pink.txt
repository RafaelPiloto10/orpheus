I opened my eyes this morning and I wasn't at home in bed  
There was four angels standing round me, I thought "I must be dead"  
Well, I opened my eyes this morning, thought "I must be dead"  
Four angels standing round me, and the room was painted red  
  
Won't you have my sugar, on your waiting son  
Take me up to heaven it's not hell where I belong  
Yeah  
  
Well, the stars began to tremble, and rain began to fall  
Four angels standing round me an it wasn't no social call  
Well, the stars began to tremble, and rain began to fall  
I got down on my knees praying Lord, but it didn't do no good at all  
  
Won't you have my sugar, on your waiting son  
Take me up to heaven it's not hell where I belong  
Yeah
