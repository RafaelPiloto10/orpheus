Spring sweet rhythm dance in my head  
Slip into my lover's hands  
Kiss me won't you kiss me now  
And sleep I would inside your mouth  
Don't be us too shy  
For knowing it's no big surprise that  
I will wait for you  
I will wait for no one but you  
  
Oh please lover lay down  
Spend this time with me  
Together share this smile  
Lover lay down  
Spend this time with me  
Walk with me, walk with you  
Hold my hand your hands  
So much we have dreamed  
And you were so much younger  
Hard to explain that we are stronger  
A million reasons life to deny  
Let's toss them away  
See you and me we  
Lay down look see  
She and he  
By my lover's side  
Together share this smile  
Each other's tears to cry  
Together share this smile  
Lover lay down  
Oh please oh please  
Oh please lover lay down  
Oh please lover lay down  
And you weep  
Lover lay down  
Cause it's over  
Lover lay down  
  
Say love, say love, say love, say love, say love  
Should I love you  
Could you love me  
Darling it's all the same  
'Til we dance away  
Chasing me all around  
Leading me all around  
Leading me all around in circles  
Say...
