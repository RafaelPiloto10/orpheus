Ah, when Jack comes ashore  
He's got money galore  
And he's seldom cut short of a job  
He can dress now as well  
As any can tell  
With a good silver watch in his fob  
Poor Jack in his life  
Was ne'er plagued with a wife  
Though sometimes with lasses he links  
He's a seafaring sailmaking gamboling capering  
Grog drinking hero, Jack Hinks  
Oh, Jack Hinks  
When inclined for to spend  
He walks in with a friend  
And with pleasure he sits himself down  
He tips off his glass  
And he winks at the lass  
And he smiles if she happens to frown  
And like a rattlin' true blue  
When the reckoning comes due  
On the table the money he clinks  
He's a seafaring sailmaking gamboling capering  
Grog drinking hero, Jack Hinks  
Bound home the other fall  
We fell into a squall  
Near the northernmost head of Cape Freels  
We were washed away  
Without further delay  
At the thought how my spirit it chills  
We were bashed on the rocks  
Like a hard hunted fox  
(Then) of death and destruction he thinks  
He's a seafaring sailmaking gamboling capering  
Grog drinking hero, Jack Hinks  
Oh, Jack Hinks  
Jack without fail  
Was out in that same gale  
Having drove across Bonavist Bay  
Oh Neptune did rail  
As he handled all sail  
And he had his two spars cut away  
Oh, but Providence kind  
Who so eases the wind  
And on sailors so constantly thinks  
He saved that seafaring sailmaking gamboling capering  
Seafaring sailmaking gamboling capering  
Seafaring sailmaking gamboling capering  
Grog drinking hero, Jack Hinks
