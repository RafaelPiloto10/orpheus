You may walk away in anger  
Wear your heart upon your sleeve  
You make act like it don't matter  
Keep me laughing while you leave  
But burning bridges won't get me back  
If you change your mind some day  
Why can't we turn this scene around  
Before you walk away?  
Will you be leaving, leaving me today?  
Like the ocean leaves us waiting on the sand  
Crumbling in our hand  
I can't live this scene again  
You may turn away in silence  
While the tears run down your face  
Say there's nothing left to bind us  
Leaving love without a trace  
But if I loved you well  
You'd soon find out why your new love falls some day  
Why can't we burn this heartache down  
Before you walk away?  
Will you be leaving, leaving me today?  
Like the ocean leaves us waiting on the sand  
Crumbling in our hand  
I can't live this scene again  
Will you be leaving, leaving me today?  
Like the ocean leaves us waiting on the sand  
Crumbling in our hand  
I can't live this scene again
