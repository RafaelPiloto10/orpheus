Me and you and the Sunday paper  
Spread all over the bed  
A rose colored morning light  
All to ourselves  
Hot coffee and the comic strips  
Pillow talk and your fingertips  
Laying down and loving  
'Til there's nothing left  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll take the little things  
The simple pleasures that your sweet love brings  
I'll take the little things with you  
  
Open the window, leave that old fan on  
Lay here with me 'til the sun is gone  
  
Don't say nothin' just let the time  
Pass right on by  
I want to hear you breathe  
I want to brush your hair  
I don't care if we go anywhere  
We've got everything we need  
  
Right here in this room  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Me and you and the Sunday paper  
Spread all over the bed
