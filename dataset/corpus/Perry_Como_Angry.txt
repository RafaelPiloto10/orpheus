Angry, please don't be angry,  
'Cause I was only teasing you!  
I wouldn't even let you think of leavin'  
Don't you know I love you true!  
Just because I took a look at somebody else,  
That's no reason you should put poor me on the shelf!  
Angry, please don't be angry,  
'Cause I was only teasing you!  
Don't believe a thing you hear, just wait 'till you see,  
Then you'll find no cause to show that you're jealous of me!  
Oh! Angry, please don't be angry,  
'Cause I was only teasing you!  
Music by Henry Brunies and Jules Cassard
