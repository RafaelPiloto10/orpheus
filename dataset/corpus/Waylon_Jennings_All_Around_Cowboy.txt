Just a broken down cowboy all down on his luck been through the best of his
friends  
On a long lonesome highway in an old pickup truck  
Crossed Texas like a hot dusty wind  
He was all around cowboy back in1949 from the top it's been long way down  
Since the whiskey and the women started winnin' his time  
They rode him high and hard to the ground  
He remembers the thrill of bein' a winner in the days of his first rodeo  
But there's somethin' about winning that didn't last forever  
Maybe tomorrow things'll get better if devil lets loose of his soul  
He'll be be the all around cowboy again  
[ ac.guitar ]  
So he rolls up a smoke and he sips his Old Crow  
Whipes the whiskers that cover his chin  
And he grins as he dreams of old rodeo he's the all around cowboy again  
He remembers the thrill...
