Melody 1)  
Working in a coal mine, goin' down down  
Working in a coal mine. Whoop! Somebody slipped down  
Working in a coal mine, goin' down down  
Working in a coal mine. Whoop! Somebody slipped down  
Five o'clock in the morning - I'm up before the sun  
And when my workday is over - No time for having fun  
No, no, no.  
(Repeat Melody 1)  
Ahhh. I'm so tired. How long can this go on?  
Said if you see me comin' better step aside  
A lot of men didn't and a lot of men died  
I got one fist of iron, and the other of steel  
If the right one don't a get ya then the left one will  
I was born one morning when the sun didn't shine  
Picked up my shovel and walked to the line  
I hauled 16 tons of number 9 coal  
And the straw boss said "Well bless my soul."  
(Melody 2)  
Sixteen tons what do you get?  
Another day older and deeper in debt.  
Saint Peter don't you call me cuz I can't go.  
I owe my soul to the company store.  
(Melody 3)  
Hit the road Jack.  
And don't you come back no more no more no more no more.  
Hit the road Jack.  
And don't you come back no more.  
(Melody 2 and 3)  
Five o'clock in the morning  
I'm up before the sun  
And when my workday is over  
No time for having fun  
No No No  
(Melody 1 and 2)  
Ahhh. I'm so tired. How long can this go on?  
Wah wah wah. How long can this go on? Man, that's all we ever hear from this
guy. Listen, you need to go out and get a job, Jack.  
(With Melody 1 and 2)  
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen.  
Nobody knows my sorrow.  
Working.  
Going.  
Working.  
Whooooop  
Somebody slipped down.  
(Repeat)
