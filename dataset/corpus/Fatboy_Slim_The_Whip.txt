I know some people they ain't got no money  
But they do got a means to an end,  
Cuz they got juice and they got plenty of lovin'  
And a big heap of beautiful friends.  
I know some people didn't know that they're born,  
They don't know the soles of their feet.  
Well you can't fight a war when you got lovin' in store  
There on the sunny side of the street.  
Let's do the whip  
Everybody get hip to it  
  
Ain't nothin' missin' we got a pot to kiss in  
We got karma, we am what we am.  
It's up to you because the best that you can do  
Is the best that you can.  
My situation is the fellation nation,  
Dancing to the brotherly beat,  
Well you can't fight a war when you got lovin' in store  
There on the sunny side of the street
