Carve your name  
Carve your name in ice and wind  
Search for where  
Search for where the rivers end  
Or where the rivers start  
Do everything that's in you  
That you feel to be your part  
But never give your love, my friend,  
Unto a foolish heart  
  
Leap from ledges  
Leap from ledges high and wild  
Learn to speak  
Speak with wisdom like a child  
Directly from the heart  
Crown yourself the king of clowns  
Or stand way back apart  
But never give your love, my friend,  
Unto a foolish heart  
  
Shun a friend  
Shun a brother and a friend  
Never look  
Never look around the bend  
Or check a weather chart  
Sign the Mona Lisa  
With a spray can, call it art  
But never give your love, my friend,  
Unto a foolish heart  
  
A foolish heart will call on you  
To toss your dreams away  
Then turn around and blame you  
For the way you went astray  
A foolish heart will cost you sleep  
And often make you curse  
A selfish heart is trouble  
But a foolish heart is worse  
  
Bite the hand  
Bite the hand that bakes your bread  
Dare to leap  
Where the angels fear to tread  
Till you are torn apart  
Stoke the fires of paradise  
With coals from hell to start  
But never give your love, my friend  
Unto a foolish heart  
  
Unto a foolish heart [Repeats]
