Like this I've never seen a woman baby  
That looks quite the way you do  
The way you shake that thing now honey,  
Can't take my eyes off you  
  
The way you work it honey  
It brings me to my knees  
You give me what I'm looking for,  
I'll give you what you need  
And I said  
  
[Chorus]  
I got the one thing you want,  
Get it all night long  
You got the one thing I need,  
When your body talks  
I hear it talking to me  
Say, get it all night long  
Woman why can't you see  
You're my one thing  
  
I got a world of trouble, baby  
It's going on inside my head  
Playing your game, got me half insane  
Trying to make sense of every word you said  
  
Stop beating around the bush  
You're just wasting time  
Let's get down to the business honey  
And lay it one the line  
And I said  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tell me the news,  
Let's hear your story  
You think you got nothing to lose  
You better use it up  
Before it gets old, baby  
And becomes yesterday's news  
  
[Chorus]
