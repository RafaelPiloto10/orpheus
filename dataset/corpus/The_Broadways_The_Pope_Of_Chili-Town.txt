Stormy seas closing in american society will never be the same again  
Do you remember what it means to be free?  
Do you remember when theft was the only threat to private property?  
Now the cops are stormtroopers on parade  
Swat team nazi repo men machine guns and grenades  
Martial law is coming in time the seizure of your home?  
They need not charge you with a crime, how can an american feel safe  
When police authority runs virtually unchecked?  
And how can a human being ignore legislation that signals  
The cops declaring war on the private citizen?  
There is a bill being discussed right now  
That would bring the army into the interior of our country  
And do you know where we'd be then?  
Our every move observed by uniformed militia men  
Machine guns on every corner and unbridled state of martial law  
It's just a little too late to write your congressman  
Justice for and by the people is long gone  
And you can smile dumbly about the rights that you still have  
But you're living in a dream  
Just keep your tv watching jenny jones  
Your fridge filled up with beer  
And you'll n ever even hear your neighbor's scream  
Until it's you  
Until it's you
