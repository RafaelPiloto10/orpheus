This is really something  
People will be envious  
But our roles aren't clear  
So we mustn't rush  
Still, we're burning brightly  
Clinging like fire to fuel  
I'm grinning like a fool  
Stay in touch  
We should stay in touch  
Oh! Stay in touch  
In touch  
  
Part of this is permanent  
Part of this is passing  
So we must be loyal and wary  
Not to give away too much  
Til we build a firm foundation  
And empty out old habits  
Old habits  
Stay in touch  
We should stay in touch  
Oh! Stay in touch  
In touch  
  
During times like these  
The wise or influential  
They can bear the imperfections  
They can keep the money  
No doubt about it  
No doubt that's essential  
No doubt that's always been a tricky one for me  
So, we should just surrender  
Let fate and duty shape us  
Let light hearts remake us  
Let the worries hush  
In the middle of this continent  
In the middle of our time on Earth  
We perceive one another  
Stay in touch  
We should stay in touch  
Oh! Stay in touch  
In touch
