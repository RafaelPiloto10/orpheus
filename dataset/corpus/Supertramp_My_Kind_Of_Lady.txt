Let me tell you what I want to say  
You're the only one who can make me feel this way  
My kind of lady  
No better love could I embrace  
  
No better heart, no other face  
Can quite compare with you  
You came along and then you mend my broken dreams  
I was so down and then as foolish as it seems  
  
You gave me your affection  
Yeah baby you came through  
We'll make it you'll see  
In spite of those who say it's wrong  
  
This time we feel that we belong  
Now we can truly say  
We'll be together and that's all we'll ever need  
We'll love each other, that's the way it's gonna be  
  
And nothin' under the sun of moon  
Can make us be apart  
Oh my honey  
You know I'll love you every day  
  
When things go wrong we'll find a way  
I'm so glad I met you  
Much more than I can ever say  
We're making plans and holding hands just like before  
  
We'll try again, we'll make amends along the road  
It's fellin' good, just like it should, this time we know  
We'll share each other's happiness for now and evermore  
I've been wastin' my life away  
  
I've got a message for you today  
To tell you that you are  
My kind of lady  
I'm not the same since I met you  
  
All of my dreams had fallen through  
And then you came along  
One magic night when things went right it was so fine  
Looked in your eyes and realized that you were mine  
  
And nothin' under the sun of moon  
Can make us be apart  
Oh my baby  
You know I'll love you all the way  
  
When times get hard we'll smile and say  
I'm so glad I met youI'll love you more and more each day  
We're making plans and holding hands just like before  
We'll try again, we'll make amends along the road  
  
It's fellin' good, just like it should, this time we know  
We'll share each other's happiness for now and evermore
