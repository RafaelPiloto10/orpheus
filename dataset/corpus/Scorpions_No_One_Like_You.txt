Girl, it's been a long time that we've been apart  
Much too long for a man who needs love  
I miss you since I've been away  
Babe, it wasn't easy to leave you alone  
It's getting harder each time that I go  
If I had the choice, I would stay  
  
There's no one like you  
I can't wait for the nights with you  
I imagine the things we'll do  
I just want to be loved by you  
  
No one like you  
I can't wait for the nights with you  
I imagine the things we'll do  
I just want to be loved by you  
  
Girl, there are really no words strong enough  
To describe all my longing for love  
I don't want my feelings restrained  
Oh, babe, I just need you like never before  
Just imagine you'd come through this door  
You'd take all my sorrow away  
  
There's no one like you  
I can't wait for the nights with you  
I imagine the things we'll do  
I just want to be loved by you  
  
No one like you  
I can't wait for the nights with you  
I imagine the things we'll do  
I just want to be loved by you  
  
No one like you
