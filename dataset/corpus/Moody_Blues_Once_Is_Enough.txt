Just ask me once  
Don't ask me twice  
Never ask me three times  
I don't give that much advice  
I took my chance at the first opportunity  
To wander through this world  
And to do what comes so naturally  
Once is enough  
Just ask me once  
Once is enough  
Just ask me once  
  
Sometimes you're first  
Sometimes you're last  
Then again you're somewhere  
In your "days of future passed"  
If you can find yourself and know just where you are  
Don't let the wind turn you  
You're stronger than you think you are  
Once is enough  
Just ask me once  
Once is enough  
Just ask me once  
  
Once I was rich  
Once I was poor  
Once I was no-one  
I ain't no-one anymore  
Once in a lifetime there's a chance that comes your way  
Take it with both your hands and be somebody for a day  
Once is enough  
Just ask me once  
Once is enough  
Just ask me once
