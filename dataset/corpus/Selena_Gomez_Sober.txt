[Verse 1]  
We fall for each other at the wrong time  
Only for a moment, but I don't mind  
Guess I don't know where to draw the line, the line, the line  
And we'll play the same game every night  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Up in the clouds  
Yeah, you know how to make me want you  
When we come down  
Oh I know, yeah I know, it's over  
  
[Chorus]  
You don't know how to love me when you're sober  
When the bottle's done you pull me closer  
And you're saying all the things that you're supposed to  
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober  
  
[Verse 2]  
Why is it so different when we wake up?  
Same lips, same kiss, but not the same touch  
Don't you know that you do it just enough, but not enough  
But I know what's next, and I want so much  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Up in the clouds  
Yeah, you know how to make me want you  
When we come down  
Oh I know, yeah I know, it's over  
  
[Chorus]  
You don't know how to love me when you're sober  
When the bottle's done you pull me closer  
And you're saying all the things that you're supposed to  
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober  
  
[Bridge]  
I know I should leave, I know I should, should, should  
But your love's too good, your love's too good, good, good  
I know I should leave, I know I should, should, should  
But your love's too good, your love's too good, good, good  
Yeah!  
  
[Chorus]  
You don't know how to love me when you're sober  
When the bottle's done you pull me closer  
And you're saying all the things that you're supposed to  
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober  
  
[Outro]  
You've got a hold on me  
You're like a wasted dream  
I gave you everything  
But you don't know how to love me when you're sobe
