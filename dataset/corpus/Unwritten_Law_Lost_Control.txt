Your a problem child  
You got me running wild  
I came to save you, tried to but I ran for miles  
  
I got my breath back now  
I'm gonna let you down  
It's vain to save you, tried to but I don't know how  
  
Whoa oh whoa oh  
You told me  
Don't let go don't let me down  
Whoa oh whoa oh  
Control is lost  
Control is lost and I won't be around  
  
Don't wanna change you girl  
Don't wanna save the world  
Don't wanna blame you for the same things you just can't learn  
  
I guess it's my turn now  
I'm gonna shut my mouth  
Your gonna hate it cause this time I won't be around  
  
Whoa oh whoa oh  
You told me  
Don't let go don't let me down  
Whoa oh whoa oh  
Control is lost  
Control is lost and I won't be around!  
  
Whoa oh whoa oh  
You told me  
Don't let go don't let me down  
Whoa oh whoa oh  
Control is lost  
Control is lost and I won't be around  
  
Whoa oh  
Don't let go don't let me down  
Whoa oh yeah  
  
Whoa oh  
Don't let go don't let me
