Imagination is funny  
It makes a cloudy day sunny  
Makes a bee think of honey  
Just as I think of you  
  
Imagination it's so crazy  
Your whole perspective gets hazy  
Starts you asking a daisy what to do, what to do  
Have you ever felt the gentle touch and then a kiss and then and then  
  
Find it's only your imagination again, oh well  
Imagination is silly  
You go around willy nilly  
For example I go around wanting you  
  
And yet I can't imagine that you want me too  
Imagination is silly  
You go around willy nilly  
For example I go around wanting you  
  
And yet I can't imagine that you  
Can't imagine that you  
Can't imagine you want me too
