Barley malts and does eat oats and little girls are lively  
And your liveliness has left me in a brew  
So I'm sitting here just drinking beer  
'Cause there's nothing else to do  
And when I'm out of love, I'm out of you.  
  
We were so happy, honey when we were together  
Why we should have won a ribbon colored blue  
But those Rocky Mountain waters came between us  
And when I'm out of love, I'm out of you.  
  
[Chorus:]  
So I'm living in the land of sky blue waters  
And I'm grabbing all the gusto up, it's true  
Well, you only go around once in life, they say  
And when I'm out of love, I'm out of you  
  
These teardrops that I'm crying are the champagne of bottled tears,  
And I must admit that I've shed one or two,  
But when good friends get together well they always tip a few  
And when I'm out of love, I'm out of you.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So put me in a cool place, for I'm the King of Beers  
Forty to forty-five degrees will do  
And if you must play that jukebox, let it be low and now  
'Cause when I'm out of love, I'm out of you.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So if you got the time, we got the tears  
And when I'm out of love, I'm out of you.
