She came from a happy home  
A very happy home a very happy home  
  
Miss personality, a grade 'a' student naturally  
She had it all worked out but things aren't what  
They seem is this real or just a dream?  
And things will never ever be the same again  
  
She came from a happy home  
A very happy home a home of happiness  
  
Miss personality, a grade 'a' student naturally  
She had it all in place but things aren't what  
They seem is this real or just a dream?  
Things will never ever be the same again  
  
The dangers, it's the dangers of love  
The dangers, it's the dangers  
  
She came from a happy home  
A vey happy home a vert happy scene  
  
She caught him with another it turns out it  
Was her mother what a tragedy can things be  
What they seem is this just some crazy dream  
Things may never ever be the same again  
  
The dangers, it's dangers of love  
The dangers, it's the dangers  
  
Keep telling li-ie-ies, but you this you know you did  
It's coming,. It's coming,. It's coming  
  
The dangers, it's the dangers of love  
The dangers, it's the dangers  
  
What went wrong she couldn't tell but we know  
It all too well  
  
The dangers, it's the dangers of love  
The dangers, it's the dangers
