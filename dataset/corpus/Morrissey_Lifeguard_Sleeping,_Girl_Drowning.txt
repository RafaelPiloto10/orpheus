Always looking for attention  
Always needs to be mentioned  
Who does she  
Think she should be?  
The shrill cry through darkening air  
Doesn't she know he's  
Had such a busy day?  
  
Tell her sshhh  
Somebody tell her sshhh  
Oh, no way, no way, there's no movement  
Oh, oh, hooray  
Slowest  
  
It was only a test  
But she swam too far  
Against the tide  
She deserves all she gets  
The sky became marked with stars  
As an out-stretched arm slowly  
Disappears  
  
Hooray  
Oh hooray  
No, oh, oh, woh, there's no movement  
No, oh, hooray  
Oh, hooray  
  
Please don't worry  
There'll be no fuss  
She was nobody's nothing  
  
(What's your name?)  
(What's your name?)  
(What's your name?)  
(What's your name?)  
  
When he awoke  
The sea was calm  
And another day passes like a dream  
There's no no way  
  
(What's your name?)  
(What's your name?)  
(What's your name?)  
(What's your name?)  
(What's your name?)  
(What's your name?)  
(What's your name?)  
(What's your name?)  
(What's your name?)
