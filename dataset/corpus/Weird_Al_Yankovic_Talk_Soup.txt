I dated Siamese twins  
I slept with Bigfoot, too  
Get me on Sally Jesse  
Put me on Donahue  
'Cause I want to tell the world about it  
Right Now  
  
My dog's a narcoleptic  
My mom's a circus freak  
I gotta get a spot on  
Geraldo's show this week  
'Cause I want to tell the world about it  
Right Now  
  
I'm just an anorexic codependant bingo addict  
Stripper born without a chin  
And I'm only comfortable talking about it  
When the whole wide world is listening in  
  
Talk Soup... Talk Soup  
Listen to me, (listen to me) listen to me, (listen to me) listen to me  
  
My wife ran off with Elvis  
My boss shaved off my hair  
I've got a thing for poodles  
And rubber underwear  
And I want to tell the world about it  
Right Now  
  
I had a close encounter  
I never chew my food  
I got eleven nose jobs  
I yodel in the nude  
And I want to tell the world about it  
Right Now  
  
I'm just a cross-dressin' alcoholic neo-Nazi  
Porno star, as you may have guessed  
And I'm really gonna feel a whole lot better  
If you let me get this thing off my chest  
  
Talk Soup... Talk Soup  
Listen to me, (listen to me) listen to me, (listen to me) listen to me  
  
I'm just your average schizophrenic nymphomaniac  
Albino go-go dancer, you see  
Nothin' so bad that I can't share it  
With a billion friends on national TV, whoa...  
  
I have no genitalia  
I sold my kids for cheese  
I love my blow up doll, so  
Bring out those cameras, please  
'Cause I want to tell the world about it  
Right Now  
  
Talk Soup... Talk Soup  
Listen to me, (listen to me) listen to me, (listen to me) listen to me  
  
Talk Soup... Talk Soup  
Listen to me, (listen to me) listen to me, (listen to me) listen to me  
  
Talk Soup... Talk Soup  
Listen to me, (listen to me) listen to me, (listen to me) listen to me  
  
Talk Soup... Talk Soup  
Listen to me, (listen to me) listen to me, (listen to me) listen to me
