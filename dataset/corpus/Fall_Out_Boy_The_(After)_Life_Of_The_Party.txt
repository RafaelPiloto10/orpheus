I'm a stitch away from making it  
And a scar away from falling apart, apart  
Blood cells pixelate, and the eyes dilate  
And the full moon peels, got me out on the street at night  
  
Could it last?  
Watch you work the room  
Could it last?  
Watch you work the room  
Could it last?  
Watch you work the room  
Could it last?  
Watch you work the room  
  
Oh, put love on hold, Young Hollywood  
'Cause on the other line  
A nose runs ruby red, death's seen a double bed  
Singing songs that could only catch the ear of the desperate  
  
Could it last?  
Watch you work the room  
Could it last?  
Watch you work the room  
Could it last?  
Watch you work the room  
Could it last?  
  
I'm a stitch away from making it  
And a scar away from falling apart, apart  
The blood cells pixelate, and the eyes dilate  
Kiss away all these thrills and kills on the mouths of all my friends  
  
Could it last?  
Watch you work the room  
Could it last?  
Watch you work the room  
Could it last?  
(Watch you work the room)  
  
(I'm a stitch away)
