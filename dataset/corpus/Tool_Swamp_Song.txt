My warning meant nothing.  
You're dancing in quicksand.  
Why don't you watch where you're wandering?  
Why don't you watch where you're stumbling?  
You're wading knee deep and going in.  
And you may never come back again.  
This bog is thick and easy to get lost in  
When you're a stupid, dumb ass, belligerent fucker.  
I hope it sucks you down.  
Wander in and wandering.  
No one even invited you in.  
But still you stumble in stumbling.  
So suffocate  
Or get out while you can.  
No one told you to come.  
I hope it sucks you down.
