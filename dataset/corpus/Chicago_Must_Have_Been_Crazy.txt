She's fine, so fine  
And I think I'm going to lose my mind  
So high, so high,  
You know you make me want to  
Scream and shout  
Well, you know I'm like a fool  
Who's just got to have a reason  
You know that I've found mine  
Must have been crazy  
Must have been crazy, yeah  
Must have been crazy  
To have done this so long  
This time, it's time  
Every singer's got to sing his song  
So fine, it's fine  
You know you make me want to  
Sing along  
'cause you know I'm not a fool  
Got to find a piece of heaven  
You know that I found mine  
Must have been crazy  
Must have been crazy, yeah  
Must have been crazy  
To have done this so long  
'cause you know I'm not a fool  
Got to find a piece of heaven  
You know that I found mine  
Must have been crazy  
Must have been crazy, yeah  
Must have been crazy  
To have done this so long
