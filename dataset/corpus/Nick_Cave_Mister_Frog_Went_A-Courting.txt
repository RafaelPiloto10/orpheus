Mister frog went a-courting and he did ride  
Uh-hmm, Uh-hmm  
Mister frog went a-courting and he did ride  
A sword and pistol by his side  
Uh-hmm, Uh-hmm.  
  
  
He went down to Missy Mousie's door  
Where he had often been before.  
  
  
He said, "Missy Mouse, are you within?"  
"Yes kind sir, I sit and spin."  
  
  
He took Missy Mouse upon his knee  
And said "Missy Mouse, will you marry me?"  
  
  
"Without my Uncle Rat's consent"  
"I wouldn't marry the pres-I-dent."  
  
  
Uncle Rat laughed and shook his fat sides,  
To think his niece would be a bride.  
  
  
When Uncle Rat gave his consent  
The weasel wrote the publishment.  
  
  
Where will the wedding supper be?  
Way down yonder in a holler tree.  
  
  
What will the wedding supper be?  
Two green beans and a black-eyed pea.  
  
  
The first guest in was a bumblebee  
He danced a jig with a crook-backed flea.  
  
  
The owl did hoot, the birds they sang  
And through the woods the music rang.  
  
  
They all went sailing 'cross the lake  
And got swallered up by a big black snake  
  
  
There's bread and cheese upon the shelf  
If you want any more you can sing it yourself.
