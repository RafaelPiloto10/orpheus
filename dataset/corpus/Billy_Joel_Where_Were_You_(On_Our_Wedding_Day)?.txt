Where were you on our wedding day?  
I got bad news that you went away  
Where were you on our wedding day?  
You did me wrong now you must pay  
Whoa oh (whoa oh) give me back my ring (my ring) whoa oh (whoa oh)  
Whoa oh (whoa oh) I ain't gonna let you keep a thing (a thing), whoa oh  
  
Where were you when I said "I do"?  
Everybody laughed and my inlaws too  
Where were you when I turned around  
Someplace you knew you never could be found  
Whoa oh (whoa oh), give me back my ring (my ring), whoa oh (whoa oh)  
Whoa oh (whoa oh), I ain't gonna let you keep a thing (a thing), whoa oh  
  
Where were you when I searched the town?  
And turned the whole neighborhood upside down  
Where were you, little girl I say?  
Where were you on our wedding day?  
Whoa oh (whoa oh), give me back my ring (my ring), whoa oh (whoa oh)  
Whoa oh (whoa oh), I ain't gonna let you keep a thing (a thing), whoa oh
