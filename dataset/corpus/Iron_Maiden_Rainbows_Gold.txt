In the heat of the morning  
When your day is still dawning  
And your bird, she's singing  
Catch your soul, he's willing to fly away  
  
Packed your bags in a hurry  
Because your mind's in a worry  
Mark my words, you're gonna be sorry if you ever fly away  
  
Sweet little girl with the Saint Da Vinci-smile  
Stares at me with sadness in her eyes  
I'm not sure if she's really real or make-believe  
Maybe she's a vision that comes to only me  
  
'Cause I'm so tired  
Yes I'm so tired  
So tired  
Yes I'm so tired  
  
In the heat of the morning  
When your day is still dawning  
And your bird, she's singing  
Catch your soul, he's willing to fly away
