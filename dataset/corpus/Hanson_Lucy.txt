The day that I left Lucy  
A tear fell from her eye  
Now I don't have nobody  
And I was such a fool  
On the day that I left Lucy  
The day that I left Lucy  
She cried, then said goodbye  
  
Now it's done and it's over and I am all alone  
On the day that I left Lucy  
Now I don't have anymore songs to sing  
'Cause you're everything, everything to me  
I don't realize I felt this way until the day  
  
Today I'm missing Lucy  
And you say that she's okay  
I hope she is  
Now I don't have nobody and no one will ever replace  
  
My Lucy  
I love Lucy  
Lucy  
On the day that I left Lucy, my Lucy
