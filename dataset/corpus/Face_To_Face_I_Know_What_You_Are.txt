even if it make you want to stop and stare you'd be better off it you were
unaware everybody wants to see that it's not them focused and unaffected
you'll get what you expected you're boring and predictable doesn't everybody
want to get their hands on everything that they desire? i know you're not
afraid and i know exactly what you want to be even still you want to take what
you can't get you'd be better off if you could just forget there isn't anyone
who lives without regret so it seems to be that no one really cares and so the
struggle to achieve the lion's share and i know what you are i'm not what you
are
