By a lonely prison wall  
I heard a young girl calling,  
'michael, they are taking you away.  
For you stole travelyns corn,  
So the young might see the morn,  
Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay. '  
  
Chorus  
  
Low lie the fields of athenry  
Where once we watched the small freebirds fly.  
Our love was on the wing,  
We had dreams and songs to sing  
It's so lonely rond the fields of athenry  
  
By a lonely prison wall  
I heard a young man calling  
'nothing matters, mary when you're free  
Against the famine and the crown,  
I rebelled, they cut me down,  
Now you must raise our child with dignity. '  
  
Chorus  
  
By a lonely harbour wall,  
As she watched the last star falling  
As the prison ship said out against the sky  
For she lived in hope and prayed,  
For her love in botany bay  
It's so lonely round the fields of athenry  
  
Chorus  
  
It's so lonely round the fields of athenry
