When I look in the mirror I can't believe what I see  
Tell me, who's that funky dude starin' back at me?  
  
Broken, beaten down can't even get around  
Without an old-man cane I fall and hit the ground  
Shivering in the cold, I'm bitter and alone  
  
Excuse the bitchin' - I shouldn't complain  
I should have no feeling, 'cause feeling is pain  
As everything I need is denied me  
And everything I want is taken away from me  
But who do I got to blame? Nobody but me  
  
And I don't want to be a old man anymore  
It's been a year or two since I was out on the floor  
Shakin' booty, makin' sweet love all the night  
It's time I got back to the good life  
It's time I got back, it's time I got back  
'N I don't even know how I got off the track  
I wanna go back, yeah!  
  
Screw this crap, I've had it! I ain't no Mr. Cool  
I'm a pig, I'm a dog, so 'scuse me if I drool  
I ain't gonna hurt nobody, ain't gonna cause a scene  
I just need to admit I want sugar in my tea  
Hear me? Hear me! I want sugar in my tea!  
  
And I don't want to be a old man anymore  
It's been a year or two since I was out on the floor  
Shakin' booty, makin' sweet love all the night  
It's time I got back to the good life  
It's time I got back, it's time I got back  
'N I don't even know how I got off the track  
I wanna go back, yeah!  
  
I wanna go back, I wanna go back  
And I don't even know how I got off the track  
It's time I got back, it's time I got back  
And I don't even know how I got off the track  
I want to go back, yeah!  
And I don't want to be a old man anymore  
It's been a year or two since I was out on the floor  
Shakin' booty, makin' sweet love all the night  
It's time I got back to the good life  
It's time I got back, it's time I got back  
'N I don't even know how I got off the track  
It's time I got back, it's time I got back  
'N I don't even know how I got off the track  
I wanna go back, I wanna go back!
