Go if you wanna go, stay if you wanna stay  
My hearts not a game you can play with and out away  
Baby tryin' to figure you out, could make a man go insane  
So just go if you wanna go, stay if you wanna stay  
  
Dream what you want to dream, be who you gotta be  
I never wanna be the one who kept you from being free  
But girl I gotta know what you want, 'cause I've takin' all I can take  
So just go if you wanna go, stay if you wanna stay  
  
Every time you decide, to spread your wings and fly  
You make the same mistake, and I can't take anymore goodbyes  
So baby just go if you wanna go, stay if you wanna stay  
  
Every time you decide, to spread your wings and fly  
You make the same mistake, and I can't take anymore goodbyes  
So baby just go if you wanna go, stay if you wanna stay  
  
I don't wanna lose everything our love has made  
But I don't wanna feel alone every time you go away  
So just go if you wanna go, stay if you wanna stay  
  
Baby just go if you wanna go, stay if you wanna stay
