Why am I not surprised, I see it in your eyes  
You're just not happy with your life  
Running from guy to guy  
Living another lie when you should be mine  
  
I saw you on the block today  
Was gonna speak, but I walked away  
Couldn't find a single thing to say  
Down the street the thought had still remained  
Girl he must be insane  
How could he treat you that way, oh  
  
Just 'cause he wants to make love  
Doesn't mean that he's in love with you  
And I really hope you hear me this time  
Maybe one day you'll wake up  
Then you'll have to face up to the truth  
  
I don't want to be a hater  
But he really needs to raise up off you  
And I hope you understand it tonight  
I don't care what it takes girl  
There's too much at stake girl  
No mountain's too high to climb  
To bring your heart to mine  
  
Why do we play this game  
Love can't be contained  
I've got to make my move, oh yeah  
I can feel the flames  
Whenever you're close to me  
I don't know what to do  
  
I'll wait long as I can for you  
Give all that I am for you  
I know he's not the man for you  
In my soul, I got plans for you  
I'll be holding on (Yeah)  
'Cause I know that he'll be gone, ooh  
  
Just 'cause he wants to make love  
Doesn't mean that he's in love with you  
And I really hope you hear me tonight  
Maybe one day you'll wake up  
Then you'll have to face up to the truth  
  
I don't want to be a hater  
But he really needs to raise up off you  
Girl I really hope you hear me this time  
I don't care what it takes girl  
There's too much at stake girl  
Just give me some kind of sign  
And I'll bring your heart to mine  
  
Girl, I know sometimes  
That you feel like the sun don't shine  
But if you look real deep inside  
You'll realize you should be mine  
  
Just 'cause he wants to make love  
Doesn't mean that he's in love with you  
Won't you try to understand me tonight  
Maybe one day you'll wake up  
Then you'll have to face up to the truth  
  
I don't want to be a hater  
But he really needs to raise up off you  
Girl, I swear that what I'm saying it right  
I don't care what it takes girl  
There's too much at stake girl  
I'll come for you anytime  
To bring your heart to mine  
  
Just 'cause he wants to make love  
Doesn't mean that he's in love with you  
I really hope you hear me tonight  
Maybe one day you'll wake up  
And give me your love  
It's killing me but I'm trying  
To bring your heart to mine
