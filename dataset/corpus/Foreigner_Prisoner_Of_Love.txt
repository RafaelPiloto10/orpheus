In your book of broken hearts  
You had my name now the story starts  
We'll never be the same again I know  
I'm a victim of circumstance  
  
I'm the one that got the second chance  
One chance...that's all I need, and I won't let go  
Now you've got to understand I'm ready  
I won't be denied  
  
This lonely heart must be satisfied  
You lie waiting far across the sea  
Wild horses could never stop me  
The highest mountain ain't high enough  
  
I'm coming back, gonna take you prisoner of love  
Calling all dreamers, every heart broken fool  
Doing what I can...but, love is cruel  
The highest mountain ain't high enough  
  
I won't give up, gonna take you prisoner of love  
You took the magic of the silver screen  
You've got the look, that dreams are made of  
I'll do anything to make my dreams come true  
  
Now turn this city upside down  
I comb the streets of every lonely town  
I'll never rest, I'm a man possessed  
I need love from you  
  
I know you've got it there and I want it  
I won't be denied  
Your lonely heart will be satisfied  
You lie waiting far across the sea  
  
Wild horses could never stop me  
The highest mountain ain't high enough  
I'm coming back, gonna take you prisoner of love  
Calling all dreamers, every heart broken fool  
  
Doing what I can but love is cruel  
The highest mountain ain't high enough  
I won't give up, gonna take you prisoner of love  
Calling all dreamers, every heart broken fool  
  
Doing what I can but love is cruel  
The highest mountain ain't high enough  
I'm coming back, gonna take you prisoner of love  
Baby, I'll be sailing far across the sea  
  
Wild horses could never stop me  
The highest mountain ain't high enough  
I won't give up, gonna take you prisoner of love  
I'm coming back gonna take you prisoner of love  
  
I'm coming back, I'm coming back  
I won't give up, gonna take you prisoner of love  
I get to your love  
I'm coming back, gonna take you prisoner of love  
  
Take you prisoner of love  
I won't give up, I won't give up, gonna take you prisoner of love  
I'm coming back, gonna take you prisoner of love
