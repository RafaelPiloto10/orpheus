Lying on the ground together staring at the stars  
The night can carry us forever we're ready to go far...  
Beyond the realm of us is nothing nothing that matters  
The world can fall apart but love, love won't be shattered!  
You take the words from my mouth  
Like you take the beat from my heart...  
Never had this with anyone else  
I just don't wanna be apart  
I understand you in the silence  
So there's no need to say a word  
It feels so right you can't deny it  
The best is what you haven't heard...  
Time has lost it's meaning when you hold me in your arms  
And I can hear so clearly in the quiet in the dark  
Skin to skin so close to me  
There's nowhere else I'd rather be...  
You take the words from my mouth  
Like you take the beat from my heart  
Never had this with anyone else  
I just don't wanna be apart  
I understand you in the silence...  
So there's no need to say a word  
It feels so right you can't deny it  
The best is what you haven't heard  
Skin to skin to skin so close to me  
There's nowhere else I'd rather be...  
Skin to skin to skin!  
Skin to skin to skin!  
I understand you in the silence  
So there's no need to say a word  
It feels so right you can't deny it  
The best is what you haven't heard...  
I understand you in the silence  
So there's no need to say a word  
It feels so right you can't deny it  
The best is what you haven't heard...
