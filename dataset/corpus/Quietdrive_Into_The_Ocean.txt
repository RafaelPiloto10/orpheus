I know trust, I know fate, I know lust  
I've lived to tell the tales  
Many years pass me by, leaving me alone with wasted time  
  
The arrow flies, just as fast as time  
As I watch it fly, the sunset fills my eyes, oh  
  
Throw myself back into the ocean, and I've lived to tell the tale  
Throw myself back into the ocean, but it wouldn't take me back  
No it wouldn't take me back  
  
I don't trust, I don't hate, I don't lust anymore  
Since I was left behind  
Consciously I'm awake, I don't sleep anymore since god erased your life  
  
The arrow flies, just as fast as time  
As I watch it fly, the sunset fills my eyes, oh  
  
Throw myself back into the ocean, and I've lived to tell the tale  
And I've lived to tell the tale  
Throw myself back into the ocean, but it wouldn't take me back  
No it wouldn't take me back  
  
My father said you did your best  
You tore your soul out of your chest  
He said he made the same mistake  
My mother wept, she told me son  
I'll let you cry but just this once  
Because I made the same mistake  
  
Throw myself back into the ocean, but it wouldn't take me back  
No it wouldn't take me back
