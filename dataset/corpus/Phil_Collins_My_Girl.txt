I've got sun shining on a cloudy day  
When it's cold outside  
I got the month of May  
Oh but I guess you'll say  
What can make me feel this way?  
  
It's my girl  
(My girl, my girl)  
You know that I'm talkin' 'bout my girl  
(My girl)  
  
I've got so much honey, you know the bees envy me  
Got a sweetest song that I can sing  
The birds in the trees  
Oh but I guess you'll say  
What can make me feel this way?  
  
It's my girl  
(My girl, my girl)  
Talkin' 'bout my girl  
(My girl)  
  
Whoo  
Hey, hey, hey  
Hey, hey, hey  
  
I don't need no money, fortune or fame  
I've got all the riches, baby  
You know that one man alone can claim  
Oh but I guess you'll say  
What can make me feel this way?  
  
It's my girl  
(My girl, my girl)  
You know that I'm talkin' 'bout my girl  
(My girl)  
  
Talkin' 'bout my girl  
I've got sunshine on cloudy day with my girl  
Talkin' 'bout my girl  
(My girl, my girl)  
  
Talkin' 'bout my girl  
(My girl, my girl, my girl)  
Talkin' 'bout my girl  
(My girl, my girl)  
  
Talkin' 'bout my girl  
My girl, my girl  
I'm talkin' 'bout my girl  
My girl
