It started off so well  
They said we made a perfect pair  
I clothed myself in your glory and your love  
How I loved you  
How I cried  
The years of care and loyalty  
Were nothing but a sham it seems  
The years belie we lived the lie  
"I love you 'til I die"  
  
Save me, save me, save me  
I can't face this life alone  
Save me, save me, save me  
I'm naked and I'm far from home  
  
The slate will soon be clean  
I'll erase the memories  
To start again with somebody new  
Was it all wasted  
All that love?  
I hang my head and I advertise  
A soul for sale or rent  
I have no heart, I'm cold inside  
I have no real intent  
  
Save me, save me, save me  
I can't face this life alone  
Save me, save me  
Oh I'm naked and I'm far from home  
  
Each night I cry and still believe the lie  
I love you 'til I die  
  
(Save me, save me, save me)  
Yea, yeah  
Save me yeah save me oh save me  
Don't let me face my life alone  
Save me, save me  
Oh I'm naked and I'm far from home
