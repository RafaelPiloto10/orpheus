Made their threats ruin your name  
Thought I was broken but the spirit remains  
And this flame will keep on burning strong  
And I will continue to sing this song  
Bad-mouthed behind us, taken their shots  
But this tattered body will never be stopped  
And this flame will keep on burning strong  
And I will continue to sing this song  
We've heard it all before  
And we're ready for some more  
If you think I'm gonna break it's  
Gonna take more than what you've got  
Don't count me out cause I've got some more  
And I'm back with more strength and vigor than before  
And this flame will keep on burning strong  
And I will continue to sing this song  
My feelings in the music and the words  
Are written in stone, and I know I'm not singing this song alone
