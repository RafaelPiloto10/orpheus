Annie says I should do what she tells me  
Annie tells me what to do  
Annie says I should do what I'm told  
And she'll tell me what to do  
  
Annie moves in mysterious ways  
Annie says that she thinks I might be crazy  
She might be right  
  
'Cause Annie says, I'm just a loony  
Annie says I'm a fool  
And I think the same about everyone else  
That Annie just tells me about  
Annie says that  
  
Annie says, I'm a fool and I'm a loony  
I believe it could be true  
Annie says I'm stranger than crazy  
I say, "Annie you could be, too"  
  
It could happen to a bishop or a priest  
Or any man that you see on the street  
They could be crazy  
Any woman or man you see  
Any child, any star you find  
  
Annie says, "Any chance"  
Annie says, "Any fortune"  
The luck of the draw, the sling of the dice  
The lowest hand, the highest nose  
Don't think twice 'cause Annie says  
  
Johnny says, "Annie's all right"  
Johnny loves her all the time  
Johnny says, "Annie's all right"  
Johnny loves her all the time  
  
She's got to be right  
Annie, got to be right, Annie, got to be right  
Annie, got to be right, Annie, got to be right  
  
Annie says that I'm crazy  
Annie knows I'm a lazy animal  
Annie knows in her heart that I'm crazy  
I tell you that it's something spiritual  
  
Annie's right, I'm always wrong  
Annie's wrong, I'm always right  
Annie's right and I'm always wrong  
Annie's wrong and I'm always right  
  
Annie says I should move like a winner  
Annie says she'll show me how  
Annie says that I know how to pin her  
I just have the don't know smile  
  
Little Johnny boy  
'Cause the don't know smile  
Oh, little Johnny boy  
Annie says there's a don't know smile  
Annie says there's a don't know smile  
Annie says there's a don't know smile  
Annie says
