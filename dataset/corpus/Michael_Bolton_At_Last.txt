At last  
My love has come along  
My lonely days are over  
And life is like a song  
  
Ooh at last, at last  
The skies above are blue  
My heart was wrapped up in clover  
The night I looked at you  
  
I found a dream  
That I could speak to  
A dream that I could call my own  
I found a thrill  
To press my cheek to  
A thrill that I have never known  
  
You smile  
You smile  
And then the spell was cast  
And here we are in heaven  
For you are mine at last  
  
I found a dream  
That I could speak to  
A dream that I  
Can call my own  
I found a thrill  
To press my cheek to  
A thrill that I have never known  
  
You smile  
You smile  
And then the spell was cast  
And here we are in heaven  
For you are mine at last
