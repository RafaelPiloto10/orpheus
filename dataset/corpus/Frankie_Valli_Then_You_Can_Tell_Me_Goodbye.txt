Kiss me each morning for a million years  
Hold me each evening by your side  
And tell me you'll love me for a million years  
If it don't work out, if it don't work out  
Then you can tell me goodbye  
  
Sweeten my coffee with a mornin' kiss  
Soften my dreams with a sigh  
After you'd loved me for a million years  
If it don't work out, if it don't work out  
Then you can tell me goodbye  
  
If you must go, no, I won't grieve  
If you wait a lifetime before you leave  
  
But if you must go, I won't tell you no  
Just so we can say that we tried  
Tell me you'll love me for a million years  
If it don't work out, if it don't work out  
Then you can tell me goodbye  
  
But if you must go, I won't tell you no  
Just so we can say that we tried  
Tell me you'll love me for a million years  
Then if it don't work out, and if it don't work out  
Then you can tell me goodbye  
Then you can tell me goodbye
