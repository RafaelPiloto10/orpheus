Hope has found its home within me  
Now that I've been found in You  
Let all that I am be all You want me to be  
'Cause all I want is more of You  
  
Let Your presence fall upon us  
I want to see You face to face  
Let me live forever lost in Your love  
'Cause all I want is more of You  
All I want is more of You  
  
I'm living for this cause  
I lay down my life  
Into Your hands  
I'm living for the truth  
The hope of the world  
In You I'll stand  
'Cause all I want is You  
All I want is  
All I want is You  
Jesus
