Thinking about you  
How it would be  
If I could live without you  
Something I just can't seem to visualise  
When I look into your eyes  
I only hear the words I want to hear  
  
Say that you'll be mine  
For ever and ever  
You don't have to tell the truth  
But I want you to  
Say that you're mine  
Say that you'll be mine  
For ever and ever  
  
Let me live a fantasy  
Gotta lie to me won't you please  
Say that you're mine  
Deep inside me  
I hear a warning voice  
Speak softly to me  
Asking how I could ever be so blind  
I've been trying to read your mind  
Why don't you say the words I want to hear  
Why don't you  
  
Say that you'll be mine  
For ever and ever  
You don't have to tell the truth  
But I want you to  
Say that you're mine  
Say that you'll be mine  
For ever and ever  
  
Doing all I can to make you see  
Ooh, baby what you do to me  
Don't you know my heart's in jeopardy  
The effect you havin' over me  
  
Say that you'll be mine  
For ever and ever  
You don't have to tell the truth  
But I want you to  
Say that you're mine  
Say that you'll be mine  
For ever and ever  
  
Say that you'll be mine  
For ever and ever  
You don't have to tell the truth  
But I want you to  
Say that you're mine  
Say that you'll be mine  
For ever and ever
