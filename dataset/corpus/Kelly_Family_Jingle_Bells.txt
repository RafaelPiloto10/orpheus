Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride  
In Santas Christmas sleigh hey  
Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride  
In Santas Christmas sleigh  
  
Dashing through the night  
In a wonderous christmas sleigh  
Round the world he goes  
Laughing all the way  
  
There high up in the skies  
You see his reindeer climb  
As this jolly gentleman  
Sings his merry rhyme hey  
  
Jengle bells...  
  
White hair and beard in wind  
And frost bit cheeks and nose  
With twinkly eyes big belly laugh  
Red and white his clothes  
  
Dashing house to house  
To childrens wild delight  
Dear Santa flies from north to south  
To every light tonight hey  
  
Jingle bells...  
  
Down your chimney he glides  
His reindeer makes no sound  
He fills and light your christmas tree  
And up again he bounds  
  
Dear Santa laugh with glee  
To see his magic pack  
The more he gives to every child  
The bigger the bag on his sack hey  
  
Jengle bells...
