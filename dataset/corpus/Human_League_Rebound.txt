And they don't come any closer. And they don't come  
Anyway.  
On the rebound on the rebound on the rebound on the  
Rebound on the rebound on the rebound on the rebound  
On The rebound on the rebound on the rebound on the  
Rebound On the rebound on the rebound on the rebound on  
The Rebound on the rebound  
The chronicle hasn't changed for fifteen years. The  
Apathetic outnumber volunteers. The grime on buildings is  
Just a memory. A shining face on the old academy.  
Have a lovely day. Aftermath okay. Have a lovely day. Wipe  
Your tears away.  
The gaze of laughter, an echo or a scream. The  
Reinforcement of someone else's theme. Turn and walk  
Without ever saying no. Light and dark in an even ratio.  
Have a lovely day. Aftermath okay. Have a lovely day. Wipe  
Your tears away.  
On the rebound on the rebound on the rebound on the  
Rebound on the rebound on the rebound on the rebound  
On The rebound  
And they don't come any closer. And they don't come  
Anyway.  
On the rebound on the rebound on the rebound on the  
Rebound on the rebound on the rebound on the rebound  
On The rebound on the rebound on the rebound on the  
Rebound On the rebound on the rebound on the rebound on  
The Rebound on the rebound  
On the rebound on the rebound on the rebound on the  
Rebound on the rebound on the rebound on the rebound  
On The rebound on the rebound on the rebound on the  
Rebound On the rebound on the rebound on the rebound on  
The Rebound on the rebound
