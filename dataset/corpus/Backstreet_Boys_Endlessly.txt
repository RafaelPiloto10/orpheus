Ohhhh Ohhhh  
  
Late at night you call on the phone  
We talk about the day  
When you found out he was cheating  
You tell me that it hurts to the bone  
To trust someone that way  
To find out he was decieving  
And I know I've always just been your friend  
But if you look my way I'll make sure that you'll never hurt again  
  
Do you know I exist  
Just to promise you this  
Endlessly to be true to you  
And if you answer my prayer  
I'd cross my heart and I'd swear  
Endlessly to be true to you  
And if you'd only see  
How beautiful you and I would be  
Endlessly  
  
Ohhh ohh yea  
I remember when you fell in love  
I could not believe  
That it was not with me  
I said a secret prayer up above  
And put my heart away  
So that you could be free  
And I know right now your broken in two  
But did you know my hearts been broken since the day i met you  
  
Do you know I exist  
Just to promise you this  
Endlessly to be true to you  
And if you answer my prayer  
I'd cross my heart and I'd swear  
Endlessly to be true to you  
And in my sweetest dream you'd learn to put your faith in me  
Endlessly  
  
Sometimes the thing you need is the one thing you can't see  
If you put your faith in me  
How beautiful you and I would be  
  
  
Do you know I exist  
Just to promise you this  
Endlessly to be true to you  
And if you answer my prayer  
I'd cross my heart and I'd swear (I'd swear)  
Endlessly to be true to you  
And if you'd only see  
How beautiful you and I would be  
Endlessly
