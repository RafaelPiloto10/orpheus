Nothing's ensconced  
Nothing's entrenched  
Nothing's entangled or twisted or wrenched  
Everything smoothly flows right through my head  
What I had hoped might linger is swept off instead  
  
Tunnels and channels and chasms and rifts  
Shiny smooth streams and unclimbable cliffs  
I see you ever so slowly being drawn to the sea  
As if by some signal that's unheard by me  
  
I stand on a featureless sheet of blue stone  
And for one instant I'm not quite alone  
Your hand is extended but then you rescin  
And you like my thoughts are borne off by the wind  
  
And here I maneuver in doubtful terrain  
Wondering which of my feelings remain  
Have I even met you, or is that still ahead?  
What I had hoped might linger is swept off instead
