When you say goodbye I really want to know  
Everything you do and everyplace you go  
And did you take a regular supply  
Of those crazy little tampax with you  
It hurts me deep inside, it hurts me outside too  
I feel a little pardon and I feel a little used  
If you ever needed someone to polish up your shoes  
I'll be waiting, with my brush  
  
I'd move to Italy with you if I had the money  
But 'til then I'll sit at home and read maps and go to pub  
Where the weather isn't sunny and the weather isn't bad  
Where the bellies look so happy but the faces look so sad  
But it doesn't really matter what's outside  
'Cause I'm in here and he's in here  
And she's in here and they're in here  
We're all in here, we're all so glad  
  
And in our own funny way we're all in Italy anyway  
Eating fancy pasta, climbing mountain ranges  
Drinking ice-cold lagers, living in Spanish castles  
We're all with you, in our thoughts  
In white ankle socks and pink Bermuda shorts  
I'll be with you, with you one day, we'll all be with you, with you one day  
One sunny beach, one sunny life, we're all glad for you  
But 'til then, we're all glad for you, I'm so glad  
  
I am a man, and I have a tent, I have a ball and a bat  
I have a li-lo, I have a bucket  
I have a good, good, good pair of trunks  
I've got a good, good pair of trunks  
  
Well here I am at the airport, with my passport  
I have a brain but only just, and we're all glad  
We're all so glad, I'm so glad, she's so glad, he's so glad  
You know how glad I am?
