(graham russell)  
  
If I've got to run instead of feeling proud  
If I've got to find you in a big wide crowd  
No doubt the country side is waiting for me  
There ain't no answer to what I say.  
  
Now that I've found my soul I'm free  
Back to the highway that's calling me  
There must be reasons why I've got to hide  
There ain't no answer to what I say  
  
  
I'm standing alone my money's all gone  
So throw me a gun and teach me to run  
I'm standing alone my money's all gone  
So throw me a gun and teach me to run  
  
  
Here I stand I'm a wanted man  
Living in the shadows wherever I can  
There must be reasons why I've got to hide  
There ain't no answer to what I say.
