There's a secret place I like to go  
Everyone is there but their face don't show  
If you get inside you can't get out  
There's no coming back, I hear them shout  
Welcome to my hide away, my secret place  
How I arrived I can't explain  
You're welcome to, if you want to stay  
But everyone just runs away  
Let me in, get me out  
Can't do more than twist and shout  
Lost my soul without a trace  
Found it again in my secret place  
In disgrace  
I hide from those that try to find me  
Scary things that's right behind me  
I lost myself, I must confess  
I can't explain how I got this mess
