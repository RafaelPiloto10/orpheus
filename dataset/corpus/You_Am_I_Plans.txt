Brush your hair to some Eurodisco trash  
Two prophylactics and forty-five dollars cash  
Corduroy jacket and some fifty buck shoes  
That can lead like a lamp when they're a scrubbing up new  
Sunday best on a Friday night alright  
I'll meet you at the corner beneath the Goodyear foot sign  
Where all dates are made by mobile  
I'll send you a smoke signal just be there by nine  
  
This smoke, I left it for you  
To show Mum and Dad your new tattoo alright  
So they're my plans, how'd they fit with you?  
  
There's a streetlight for each night your heart hit the deck  
This drink says I love you, this drink says I couldn't care less  
Kiss me so I know I'm alive  
The drinks taste crap but they keep coming til five  
  
Numbers on the wall, I got my ears like a shell  
The phone stinks of chips, cheap wine, mouthwash and gel  
C'mon we'll drink the last of the rent  
And I'll leave my number right down on the strap of your dress  
  
And it's late, and she's Sue  
'cause I read it on the back of her boyfriends neck alright  
So they're my plans, how'd they fit with you?  
  
Yeah, I had a plan, but how'd it fit with you?
