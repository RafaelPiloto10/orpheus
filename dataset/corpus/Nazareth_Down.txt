Another bridge I have burned  
A lesson I learned  
One more mistake to my cause  
One more hand got lost  
In a game  
So I was up for awhile  
Livin' in style  
Feelin' high on the hog  
  
I was down  
  
[Chorus]  
Now some say I lost  
His other soul  
How barely a young man  
Can sink so low  
And I don't know, don't care at all  
  
I had a similar dream  
Of my dreams while  
I thought I had wandered a mile  
I was wrong  
  
Now I'm on the way up  
When you reach the top  
No way to go  
And people just don't want to know  
When you're down
