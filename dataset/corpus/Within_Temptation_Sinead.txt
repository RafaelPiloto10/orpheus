I've gotta try  
It's not over yet  
No signals of love  
Have you left  
My heart is bleeding just for you  
Bleeds for only you  
  
And it hurts to know the truth  
  
Are you looking for saviours  
Chasing a dream  
Love turned to hate  
  
Now I'm crossing the border  
See then I fade  
But I'm not afraid  
  
Oh Sinead,  
For the first time  
Love is gonna turn around  
I'm telling you  
You will like it, I know  
  
Oh Sinead,  
It's the first time  
Only you can set it free  
Oh Sinead  
Come break away with me  
  
This second chance I know won't last  
But it's OK  
Got not regrets  
And I, I feel the end here  
I'm a fool  
Getting closer  
  
But I'm doing what I should  
I been drowning in sorrow  
Chasing tomorrow,  
Running away  
  
Now you're crossing the border  
See no tomorrow  
But you're not afraid  
  
Oh Sinead,  
For the first time  
Love is gonna turn around  
I'm telling you  
You will like it, I know  
  
Oh Sinead,  
It's the first time  
Only you can set it free  
Oh Sinead  
Come break away with me  
  
But I'm doing what I should  
I've been drowning in sorrow  
Chasing tomorrow,  
Running away  
  
Now you're crossing the border  
See no tomorrow  
But you're not afraid  
  
Oh Sinead,  
For the first time  
Love is gonna turn around  
I'm telling you  
You will like it  
  
Oh Sinead,  
For the first time  
Love is gonna turn around  
I'm telling you  
You will like it, I know  
  
Oh Sinead,  
It's the first time  
Only you can set it free  
Oh Sinead  
Come break away with me.
