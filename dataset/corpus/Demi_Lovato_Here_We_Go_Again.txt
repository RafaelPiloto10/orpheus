I throw all of your stuff away  
Then I clear you out of my head  
I tear you out of my heart  
And ignore all your messages  
  
I tell everyone we are through  
Cause I'm so much better without you  
But it's just another pretty lie  
Cause I break down  
  
Every time you come around  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
[Chorus]  
So how did you get here  
Under my skin?  
I swore that I'd never let you back in  
Should have known better  
Than trying to let you go  
Cause here we go go go again  
Hard as I try I know I can't quit  
Something about you  
Is so addictive  
We're falling together  
You'd think that by now I'd know  
Cause here we go go go again  
  
You never know what you want  
And you never say what you mean  
But I start to go insane  
Every time that you look at me  
  
You only hear half of what I say  
And you're always showing up too late  
And I know that I should say goodbye  
But it's no use  
  
Can't be with or without you  
O oh o oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh  
And again (and again)  
And again (and again)  
And again  
  
I threw all of your stuff away  
And I cleared you out of my head  
And I tore you out of my heart  
O oh o oh  
O oh o oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Cause here we go go go again  
Again (again) again and again and again  
And again and again and again and again  
And again and again and again and again and again
