Hold on cause this feels just like a first love  
There's no way to rehearse love  
We'll just learn as we go  
  
I know you can see it in my eyes  
I've been looking in your eyes  
The feeling is starting to grow  
  
[Chorus]  
Hold on  
Love can take us up so high  
But it can take us down so low  
You either laugh or you cry  
Hold on  
Cause love's a chance that we're taking  
And I don't think we're mistaking  
We'll never know till we try  
  
Hold on  
Cause here comes all the conversations  
The painful midnight confessions  
That leave you feeling so sad  
  
I know we can make it forever  
If we just face it together  
Take the good with the good  
  
[Chorus: x2]
