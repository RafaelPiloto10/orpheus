People in love  
They've got it all  
They've got the world in their hands  
Chosen their eyes  
There's no way to hide  
Of the love that we had  
  
People in love  
Live everyday  
Knowing each other by heart  
A power of two  
Leading them through  
Like a torch in the dark  
  
Yesterday  
Love seemed so far away  
I never dreamed I could be  
One of those people in love  
  
But I found you  
To give up my love in two  
Only you  
I never dreamed we could be  
Two of those people in love  
  
People in love take care forever  
Knowing someone truly cares  
Love is the key  
Of those who believe  
Of a lifetime to share
