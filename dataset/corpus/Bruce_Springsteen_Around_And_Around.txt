They say the joint was rockin'  
A goin' 'round and round  
Yeah reelin' and a rockin' what a crazy sound  
Well they never stopped rockin' till the moon went down  
  
Oh it sounds so sweet I gotta take me a chance  
Rose out of my seat just had to dance  
Started movin' my feet well a clappin' my hands  
Well the joint started  
  
Rockin' Going 'Round and around  
Yeah reelin' and a rockin' what a crazy sound  
A well they never stopped rockin' till the moon went down  
  
Twelve o'clock  
Well the place as packed  
Front doors was locked  
Well the place was packed  
When the police knocked  
Both doors flew back  
But they kept on a....  
  
Oh they kept on a....
