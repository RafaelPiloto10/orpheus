In your heart, I found mine  
Fill me with your life  
Boy you make it hot on your red planet  
Turn it up on your red planet  
  
I-I-I-I-I thought my love was bittersweet  
Broken into pieces but now back on my feet  
Thanking you for letting me through your galaxy  
Pam-pa-rum-pam my heart beats,  
So you and I like to explore things  
The way you make me feel, I could never explain  
You make me, make me, make me, make me feel  
That your love is real, yeah  
  
In your heart, I found mine  
Fill me with your life

Loving you, loving you  
  
Way you won't let me alone  
It's like a ghost hunting me, now it's in my bones  
  
Never knew my comfort zone could be so sweet  
Loving you and you and me, now that's twice as deep  
  
That's what I love about us two  
  
Cause I see me and you yeah

And again and again  
  
And use your body language, don't say a thing  
  
And do it over again
