Breeze still carries the sound  
Maybe I'll disappear  
Tracks will fade in the snow  
You won't find me here  
  
Ice is starting to form  
Ending what had begun  
I am locked in my head  
With what I've done  
  
I know you tried to rescue me  
Didn't let anyone get in  
Left with a trace of all that was  
And all that could have been  
  
Please, take this  
And run far away, far away from me  
I am tainted  
The two of us were never meant to be  
All these pieces and promises and left behinds  
If only I could see  
In my nothing  
You meant everything, everything to me  
  
Gone  
Fading  
Everything  
  
And  
All that  
Could have been  
Could have been  
  
Please, take this  
And run far away, far as you can see  
I am tainted  
And happiness and peace of mind  
Were never meant for me  
All these pieces and promises and left behinds  
If only I could see  
In my nothing  
You meant everything, everything to me
