Red like fire was the day I met you  
I tell you now, there are no regrets  
In this room there are many memories  
Some are good, some I try to forget  
  
I thought we were the chosen ones  
Who were supposed to fly  
  
We're very much the same, you and I  
The sweet hello, the sad goodbye  
Still waiting to get hurt, time after time  
The sweet hello, the sad goodbye  
When love lies in our hands we seem to run and hide  
And I can't help but wonder why  
The sweet hello, the sad goodbye  
  
My heart was like a runaway train, babe  
I don't believe I've ever felt more alive  
In this room I hear voices linger  
We never talked about the pride  
  
You know you're not the only one  
Who knows how to cry  
  
We're very much the same, you and I  
The sweet hello, the sad goodbye  
Still waiting to get hurt, time after time  
The sweet hello, the sad goodbye  
When love lies in our hands we run away and hide  
And I can't help but wonder why  
The sweet hello, the sad goodbye
