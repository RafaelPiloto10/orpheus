I bought a bonnet to suit my face  
I had my petticoat trimmed with lace  
I looked at the mirror, around I twirled  
And then I went out in the wide, wide world  
  
I dreamed of gentlemen I would meet  
I saw them all kneeling at my feet  
I can't understand it, my hair is all curled  
But my goodness me, it's a great big world  
  
[Chorus:]  
And it's a cold, cold, cold and we'll soon be old  
Alas and a lack, it's a great big world.  
  
I learned to sew and I learned to bake  
I even frosted an angel cake  
On Saturday evening, when folks dropped in  
My house was as neat as a brand new pin  
  
I thought by learning each social grace  
A chap might learn to forget my face  
I can't understand it, I've knitted and pearled  
But my goodness me it's a great big world!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I had no petticoat trimmed with lace  
My angel cake was a sure disgrace  
My face was my fortune, my mother said  
And my dancing slippers of bright, bright red.  
  
A million miles I've danced or more  
In hopes Prince Charming would cross the floor  
I can't understand it, I've Waltzed and I've whirled  
But my goodness me, it's a great big world.  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
But I'll keep on knitting and doing it well  
My slippers are one thing I never will sell  
My petticoat's waiting, because who can tell?  
It's a great big world, it's a great big world.
