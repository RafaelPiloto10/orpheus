[Verse 1]  
I've got to get out of here  
This town's no longer fun  
And I'm falling closer, falling closer  
Closer to the sun  
I've got to get out of here  
Come kiss another face  
Cause it hurts too bad, it hurts too bad  
And I don't like the taste  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
You say it's over, leaving me so far from sober  
Now sun is colder, I lean on a stranger's shoulder  
I walk the streets and there are beats and cities smoulder  
Without a trace I'm under  
  
[Chorus]  
And God knows I try  
Looking for lovers at night  
But each time I do  
It only reminds me of you  
It only reminds me of you  
  
[Verse 2]  
I've got to get out of here  
Cause you never want me back  
You are moving on, moving on  
And I'm stuck on the track  
I've gotta get out of here  
Before I self-destruct  
And I don't want, I don't want  
My heart to ever stop  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I walk the streets and there are beats and cities smoulder  
Without a trace I'm under  
  
[Chorus]  
And God knows I try  
Looking for lovers at night  
But each time I do  
It only reminds me of you  
It only reminds me of you  
  
And God knows I try  
Looking for lovers at night  
But each time I do  
It only reminds me of you  
It only reminds me of you
