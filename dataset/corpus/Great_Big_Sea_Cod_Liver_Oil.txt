I'm a young married man and I'm tired of life  
Ten years I've been wed to a pale sickly wife  
She's nothing to do, only sit there and cry  
Praying and praying to God she would die  
A friend of my own came to see me one day  
He told me my wife, she was pining away  
He afterwards told me that she would get strong  
If I get a bottle from dear Dr John  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh doctor, oh doctor, oh dear Dr John  
Your cod liver oil is so pure and so strong  
I'm afraid of my life, I'll go down in the soil  
If me wife don't stop drinking your cod liver oil  
  
I bought her a bottle, well just for to try  
And the way that she drank it  
You'd think she might die  
I bought her another, it vanished the same  
And then she got cod liver oil on the brain  
I bought her another, she drank it no doubt  
And then she began to get terrible stout  
And when she got stout  
Well of course she got strong  
And I became jealous of dear Dr John  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My house it resembles a great doctor's shop  
It's covered in bottles from bottom to top  
Well early the morning the kettle does boil  
You would swear it was singing of cod liver oil  
  
Oh doctor, oh doctor, oh dear Dr John  
Your cod liver oil is so pure and so strong  
I'm afraid of my life, I'll go down in the soil  
If me wife don't stop drinking  
  
[Chorus]
