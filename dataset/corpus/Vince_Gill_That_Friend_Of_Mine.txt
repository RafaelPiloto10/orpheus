That friend of mine wears an old work shirt  
For a long long time she has blessed this earth  
And a smile that shines even when she hurts  
O how I love that friend of mine  
That friend of mine gave her heart to me  
How sweet and kind the truth can be  
And God's tie that binds us as family  
Oh how I love that friend of mine  
  
She's an angel she's the answer  
The sweetest piece of heaven in my eyes  
She's drawn to me like gravity  
I'd lay down and die for that friend of mine  
  
She's an angel she's the answer  
The sweetest piece of heaven in my eyes  
She's drawn to me like gravity  
I'd lay down and die for that friend of mine  
I'd lay down and die for that friend of mine  
That friend of mine wears an old work shirt
