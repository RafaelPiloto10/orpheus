Is a zone where  
There is no doubt  
No more fall-out  
Why don't you step  
Through the mirror and see?  
  
From Arizona  
To Eldorado  
Sure is a mighty long way.  
Hey little girl  
Is something wrong?  
I know it's hard  
For you to get along  
  
The bell-tower rings  
It tolls a hollow sound  
But your castles in Spain  
Still maybe realized  
And longings more profound.  
  
You see, every cloud  
Has a silver lining  
And sometimes paradise  
Around your corner lies.  
In Amazona everything is nice  
  
Little one, come take my hand?  
I'll try to help you there  
I'll take you there.  
  
Amazona's  
Getting closer  
Soon you'll see.  
Journey's over  
We almost there!
