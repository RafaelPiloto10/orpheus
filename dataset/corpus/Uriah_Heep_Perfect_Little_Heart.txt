When I think about it  
Does anybody win  
Taking for yourself and giving nothing  
Now that we're apart  
I see it wasn't really love  
I can ride down the road  
And let my soul run free  
You may think it over  
But no matter what you say  
You're talking to yourself  
And getting nowhere  
There ain't no second chances  
No reason to pretend  
I'm gonna ride down the road  
And let my soul run free  
Now that we've grown apart  
It seems so very sad  
Why did it turn so bad and I remember  
You said that all good things  
Must surely end  
Never mind all the hearts  
That lie broken  
I know I'll never make  
The same mistake again  
I doesn' matter what you say  
Now I think about it  
We all need a little time  
'cause if we ain't got love  
We ain't got nothing  
The doors are opened wide  
On my one and only life  
Gonna ride down the road  
And let my soul run free  
I know I'll never make  
The same mistake again  
But I will always be your friend  
Now that we've grown apart  
It seems so very sad  
Why did it turn so bad and I remember  
And I remember  
Let my soul run free  
Let my soul run free  
Did I break your perfect little heart
