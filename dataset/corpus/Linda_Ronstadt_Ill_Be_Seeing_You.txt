Cathedral bells were tolling  
And our hearts sang on  
Was it the spell of Paris  
Or the April dawn  
Who knows if we shall meet again  
But when the morning chimes ring sweet again  
  
I'll be seeing you  
In all the old familiar places  
That this heart of mine embraces  
  
All day through  
In that small cafe  
The park across the way  
The children's carousel  
The chestnut tree  
The wishing well  
  
I'll be seeing you  
In every lovely summer's day  
In everything that's light and gay  
I'll always think of you that way  
  
I'll find you in the morning sun  
And when the night is new  
I'll be looking at the moon  
But I'll be seeing you
