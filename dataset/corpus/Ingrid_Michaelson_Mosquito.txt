Mosquito, mosquito, buzzing around  
Landing on my knee  
How can I truly be angry with you?  
All you want is to be part of me  
Now we are lying and counting the leaves  
Underneath our tree  
How can I truly be angry with you?  
All you want is to be part of me  
You love like no human could  
You love like no human should  
Poison, the poison, I taste on your lips  
Makes the apple red  
Wouldn't you love if I fell like Snow White  
Slumbered in your bed?  
You love like no human could  
You love like no human should  
You love like no human could  
You love like no human should  
Are you poison?  
Are you poison?  
Are you poisoning me?  
Are you poison?  
Are you poison?  
Are you poisoning me?  
Are you poison?  
Are you poison?  
Are you poisoning me?  
How can I truly be mad  
When all that you want is to be  
When all that you want is to be  
Part of me, me, me?
