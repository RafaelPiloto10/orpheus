Something somewhere  
Is calling out your name  
In the middle of the night  
Your eyes go wide  
I see your legs shaking  
  
You don't believe it's happening  
Oppressor man ye  
  
Don't tell me you are scared now  
It's not the end of your life  
But it's the end of your kingdom  
It's not the end of your life  
But it's the end of your shitty kingdom  
  
Oppressor man you running  
Your kingdom is falling  
Your kingdom is falling  
Your kingdom is falling  
Yo Yo Yo Yo  
  
You run for your gun  
To your surprise it's empty  
'Cause we had those bullets  
For breakfast Jah children did ye ye ye  
Teargas won't make me cry anymore  
Your handcuffs won't hurt my arms anymore  
  
It's not the end of your life but it's the end of your kingdom  
It's not the end of your life  
But it's the end of your shitty kingdom  
  
Oppressor man you running  
Your Kingdom's falling  
Your Kingdom's falling  
Your Kingdom's falling  
  
I won't do to you  
What you did to my people ye  
Four hundred years ago  
Four hundred years ago  
Turning them to slaves  
Making them your prisoners  
  
You can run but you can't hide  
Your time has come now now now  
  
Oppressor man you running  
Your kingdom's falling
