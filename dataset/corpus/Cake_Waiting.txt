So we think that we're important  
And we think that we make sense  
And we think there's something better on the other side of this fence  
And you can soak your bread in gravy  
You can soak your bread in soup  
But the car that you are driving doesn't really belong to you  
So you know you'll always be waiting  
Always be waiting  
For someone else to call  
Yeah you know you'll always be waiting  
Always be waiting  
I say always be waiting  
  
And you can soak your bread in water  
You can soak your bread in wine  
It can seem like you are living like you're having a real good time  
And you can do it to your conscience  
You can do it all the time  
You can do it with a vengeance in the morning after nine  
But you know you'll always be waiting  
Always be waiting for someone else to call  
Yeah you know you'll always be waiting  
Always be waiting  
I say always be waiting  
I say always be waiting
