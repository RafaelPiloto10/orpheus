How you spend your minutes are what matters  
All tomorrows come from yesterdays  
When you're feeling broken, bruised and sometimes shattered  
Blow out the candles on the cake  
Like everything's a big mistake  
  
It seems you always wait for life to happen  
And your last buck can't buy a lucky break  
If all we've got is us then life's worth living  
And if you're in, you know I'm in  
I'm ready and I'm willing  
  
I am  
When you think that no one needs you, sees you or believes you  
No one's there to understand  
I am  
I'll be there to be that someone  
When you think that no one is there to hold your hand  
I am  
  
We're just who we are, there's no pretending  
It takes a while to learn to live in your own skin  
Say a prayer that we might find our happy ending  
And if you're in you know I'm in  
I'm ready and I'm willing  
  
Chorus: I am  
When you think that no one needs you, sees you or believes you  
No one's there to understand  
I am  
I'll be there to be that someone  
When you think that no one is there to hold your hand  
I am  
  
I ain't got no halo hanging over my head  
I ain't gonna judge you, I'm just here to love you  
I am, I am  
  
Chorus: I am  
When you think that no one needs you, sees you or believes you  
No one's there to understand  
I am  
I'll be there to be that someone  
When you think that no one is there to hold your hand  
I am  
When you think that no one needs you, sees you or believes you  
No one's there to understand  
I am  
I'll be there to be that someone  
When you think that no one is there to hold your hand  
I am  
I am  
I am
