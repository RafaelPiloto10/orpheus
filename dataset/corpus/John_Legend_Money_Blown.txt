Don't let it fool you brother  
Beware of what you see  
You've been consumed by all your visions of luxury  
Betrayed your friends and burned the  
Bridges that carry you  
But when you need them later, they won't be there for you  
  
You're so high now  
You think you'll never fall  
But when you come down, who will you call?  
  
[Chorus]  
Whatcha gonna do when your money's blown  
Your friends are gone and you're all alone  
Now you barely hanging on with no one else to run to  
You should know it won't make you whole  
You gain the world but lose your soul  
Spend your life in the search for dough  
You'll find out it just won't save you  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
You think that having money brings joy and peace to you  
But the pursuit of it might bring out the beast in you  
Chase the American Dream but can't face reality  
That what you're chasing only lasts temporarily  
  
You're so high now  
You think you'll never fall  
But when you come down, who will you call?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Whatcha gon do  
Whatcha gon do  
Whatcha gon do  
Whatcha gon do  
Whatcha gon do  
Whatcha gon do  
Whatcha gon do  
Whatcha gon do  
  
Whatcha gonna do when there's nowhere (Nowhere to run to) oh  
I think you're gonna find that it just won't (Just won't save you) oh  
Whatcha gonna do when there's nowhere (Nowhere to run to)  
Ooh you're gonna find that it just won't (Just won't save you) oh  
Whatcha gonna do when there's nowhere (Nowhere to run to)  
I think you're gonna find that it just won't (Just won't save you) Hey  
Whatcha gonna do when there's nowhere to run to (Nowhere to run to)  
I think you're gonna find that it just won't (Just won't save you) Hey, yeah
yeah  
Whatcha gonna do when there's nowhere (Nowhere to run to) oh, yeah, yeah  
I think you're gonna find that it just won't (Just won't save you) Hey,
there's nowhere  
  
Nowhere to run to  
Just won't save you  
Nowhere to run to  
Just won't save you
