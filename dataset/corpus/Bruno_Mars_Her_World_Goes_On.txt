I'm without her somewhere far away  
I keep thinking about her but I know I can't stay  
She haunts me like a nightmare her image is everywhere  
She doesn't leave me alone  
I can't escape her or erase her  
When I know she's not coming home  
  
I can't understand where I went wrong  
I can't understand where her love has gone  
I don't know where I belong  
My world is over  
When life goes on (her world goes on) and on and on  
(Her world goes on)  
When life goes on (her world goes on) and on and on  
(My world is gone)  
  
Am I crazy or just human  
Is this what heartbreak is  
What should I be doing  
It feels like I got seconds to live  
She haunts me like a nightmare her image is everywhere  
She doesn't leave me alone  
I can't escape her or erase her  
When I know she's not coming home  
  
I can't understand where I went wrong  
I can't understand where her love has gone  
I don't know where I belong  
My world is over  
When life goes on (her world goes on) and on and on  
(Her world goes on)  
When life goes on (her world goes on) and on and on  
(My world is gone)  
  
My world is over while her world goes on  
(... I don't know where I belong  
My world is over)  
When life goes on (her world goes on) and on and on  
(Her world goes on)  
When life goes on (her world goes on) and on and on  
(My world is gone)
