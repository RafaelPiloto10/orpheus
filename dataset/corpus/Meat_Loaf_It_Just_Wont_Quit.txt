And I never really sleep anymore  
And I always get those dangerous dreams  
And I never get a minute of peace  
And I gotta wonder what it means  
And I gotta wonder what it means  
Maybe it's nothing and I'm under the weather  
Maybe it's just one of those bugs going round  
Maybe I'm under a spell and it's magic  
Maybe there's a witch doctor with an office in town  
  
Is this a blessing? Or is it a curse?  
Does it get any better? Can it get any worse?  
Will it go on forever? Is it over tonight?  
Does it come with the darkness? Does it bring out the light?  
Is it richer than diamonds?  
Or just a little cheaper than spit?  
  
I don't know what it is but it just won't quit  
I don't know what it is but it just won't quit  
I don't know what it is but it just won't quit  
I don't know what it is but it just won't quit  
  
And there used to be such an easy way of living  
And there used to be every hope in the world  
And I used to get everything that I went after  
But there never used to be this girl  
No there never used to be this girl  
  
Maybe I'm crazy and I'm losing my senses  
Maybe I'm possessed by a spirit or such  
Maybe I'm desperate and I got no defenses  
Can you get me a prescription for that one perfect touch?  
  
Is this a blessing? Or is it a curse?  
Does it get any better? Can it get any worse?  
Will it go on forever? Is it over tonight?  
Does it come with the darkness? Does it bring out the light?  
Is it richer than diamonds?  
Or just a little cheaper than spit?  
  
I don't know what it is but it just won't quit  
I don't know what it is but it just won't quit  
I don't know what it is but it just won't quit  
I don't know what it is but it just won't quit  
  
There was a time when nothing ever really mattered  
There was a time when there was nothing I didn't know  
There was a time when I knew just what I was living for  
There was a time and the time was so long ago  
There was a time and the time was so long ago  
And I never really sleep anymore
