You don't know a thing about me  
Is there something that you should know?  
I can tell you what you want to hear  
Let you inhibitions just go  
No you don't know what you will give up  
You don't know what you want  
It may take you years to find out  
  
You don't know what you need  
It's something that may never come to you  
Trust is something that comes easy  
When you've never been a victim  
Lies and promises and words are said  
It's your decision to accept them
