Eponine  
'Parnasse, what are you doing  
So far out of our patch?  
  
Montparnasse  
This house, we're going to do it  
Rich man, plenty of scratch  
You remember he's the one  
Who got away the other day  
Got a number on his chest  
Perhaps a fortune put away!  
  
Eponine  
Oh Lord, somebody help me!  
Dear God, what'll I do?  
He'll think this is an ambush  
He'll think I'm in it too!  
  
What'll I do, what'll I say?  
I've got to warn them here  
I've got to find a way.  
  
[Thenardier arrives with the rest of his gang.]  
  
Thenardier  
This is his lair  
I've seen the old fox around  
He keeps himself to himself  
He's staying close to the ground  
I smell profit here!  
  
Ten years ago  
He came and paid for Cosette  
I let her go for a song  
It's time we settled the debt  
This'll cost him dear  
  
Brujon  
What do I care  
Who you should rob  
Give me my share  
Finish the job!  
  
Thenardier  
You shut your mouth  
Give me your hand  
  
[He notices Eponine but doesn't recognize her.]  
  
Brujon  
What have we here?  
  
Thenardier  
Who is this hussy?  
  
Babet  
It's your brat Eponine  
Don't you know your own kid  
Why's she hanging about you?  
  
Thenardier  
'Ponine, get on home  
You're not needed in this  
We're enough here without you  
  
Eponine  
I know this house  
I tell you there's nothing here for you  
Just the old man and the girl  
They live ordinary lives  
  
Thenardier  
Don't interfere  
You've got some gall  
Take care, young miss,  
You've got a lot to say!  
  
Brujon  
She's going soft  
  
Claquesous  
Happens to all  
  
Montparnasse  
Go home, 'Ponine,  
Go home, you're in the way  
  
Eponine  
I'm gonna scream, I'm gonna warn them here.  
  
Thenardier  
One little scream and you'll regret it for a year.  
  
Claquesous  
What a palaver  
What an absolute treat  
To watch a cat and it's father  
Pick a bone in the street  
  
Brujon  
Not a sound out of you!  
  
Eponine  
Well I told you I'd do it, told you I'd do it...  
  
[She screams.]  
  
Thenardier  
You wait my girl, you'll rue this night  
I'll make you scream, you'll scream all right  
Leave her to me, don't wait around  
Make for the sewers, go underground!  
  
[The gang scatters.]  
  
Marius  
It was your cry sent them away  
Once more 'Ponine saving the day  
Dearest Cosette, my friend 'Ponine  
Brought me to you, showed me the way!  
  
Someone is near  
Let's not be seen  
Somebody's here...  
  
[Marius leaves quickly as Valjean enters.]  
  
Valjean  
My God, Cosette  
I heard a cry in the dark  
I heard the shout of angry voices in the street.  
  
Cosette  
That was my cry you heard, Papa.  
I was afraid of what they'd do.  
They ran away when they heard my cry  
  
Valjean  
Cosette, my child, what will become of you?  
  
Cosette  
Three men I saw beyond the wall  
Three men in shadow moving fast  
  
Valjean  
This is a warning to us all  
These are the shadows of the past  
Must be Javert!  
He's found my cover at last!  
I've got to get Cosette away  
Before they return!  
We must get away from shadows  
They will never let us be  
Tomorrow to Calais  
Then a ship across the sea!  
Hurry, Cosette, prepare to leave and say no more  
Tomorrow we'll away!  
Hurry, Cosette, it's time to close another door  
And live another day!
