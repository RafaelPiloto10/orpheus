Hey Lorene girl, huh  
Bring yourself home to me  
You've got my mind  
Messed up and shattered  
I'm at the point  
Where don't nothin' matter  
You got me beggin', pleadin' and needin'  
Oh sweet Lorene, girl, all right  
  
The places that we used to go  
I can't stand to go there no more  
The smilin' faces we used to see  
I bow my head  
'Cause they're starin' at me, now  
You got me scared, weepin' and moanin'  
Oh sweet Lorene, girl, all right  
Let me tell you about it  
  
If you want my lovin', girl  
You got to get it home to me, girl  
I'm gonna kiss you from head to toe  
Love you more and more  
When you get here  
I'm gonna sock it to you  
ou, ha  
ou yeah  
  
Do it, do it  
Ooh sweet Lorene, all right, yeah girl  
You got to hurry, don't stay no longer  
'Cause my need for you  
Is gettin' mighty stronger, girl  
Five long years I been sufferin'  
Tryin' to tell you, girl  
I ain't had nothin'  
You got me beggin', pleadin' and weapin'  
Oh sweet Lorene, girl, all right
