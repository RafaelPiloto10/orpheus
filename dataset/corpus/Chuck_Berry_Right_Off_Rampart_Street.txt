Way down south in Louisiana, up under the Delta heat, child  
There's an old boy plays an electric guitar right off Rampart Street  
Sometimes a Go-Go girl come in with him, she be shakin' out a Mojo beat  
That old boy sure pick some old mean guitar right off Rampart Street  
Stays crowded every time he's there, people come there from near and far  
I don't think nobody knows his name, they just know it's a Go-Go guitar  
They just know it's a Go-Go guitar  
Way down south in Louisiana, up under the Delta heat, child  
Go see that old boy play his guitar right off Rampart Street  
Right off Rampart Street
