You spoonfed us on a Saturday morning mouthfuls of maggots and lies  
Disguised in your sugary breakfast cereals  
The plates you made us clean were filled with your fears  
These things have hardened in our soft pink bellies  
We are what you have made us  
We have grown up watching your television  
We are a symptom of your christian America, the biggest Satan of all  
This is your world in which we grow,  
and we will grow to hate you  
  
Hallelujah mother-fuckers  
  
I eat innocent meat  
The housewife I will beat  
The pro-life I will kill  
What you won't do I will  
I bash myself to sleep  
What you sow I will reap  
I scar myself you see  
I wish I wasn't me  
I am the little stick  
You stir me into shit  
I hate therefor I am  
Goddamn your righteous hand  
Goddamn, oh Lord  
Goddamn, oh Lord  
Goddamn, oh Lord  
Goddamn, oh Lord  
  
Pseudo morals work real well  
On the talk shows for the week  
Goddamn  
But your selective judgment  
And goodguy badges  
Don't mean a fuck to me  
Goddamn  
  
I throw a little fit, I slit my teenage wrist  
The most I can learn is in records that you burn  
Get Your Gunn, Get Your Gunn  
Get Your Gunn, Get Your Gunn  
  
Pseudo morals work real well  
On the talk shows for the week  
Goddamn  
But your selective judgments  
And goodguy badges  
Don't mean a fuck to me

I am the VHS  
Record me with your fist  
You want me to save the world  
I'm just a little girl  
Goddamn, Goddamn  
Goddamn, Goddamn

Sound like anybody you know?
