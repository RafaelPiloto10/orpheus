It's warm outside  
But I can hear the snow  
Falling on my window  
I had to go away  
To somewhere deeper down  
I know it's my mistake  
To take off out of this town  
And June becomes July  
  
This road's on fire  
And my train's running slow  
It rains against my window  
I had to get away  
To somewhere no-one knows  
I know it's my mistake  
To take off now in this way  
And June becomes July  
  
The air is thin  
When you're above the clouds  
I see them from my window  
It's strange to get away now  
To somewhere no-one goes  
I know it's my mistake  
But I don't even know now  
And June becomes July  
And June becomes July
