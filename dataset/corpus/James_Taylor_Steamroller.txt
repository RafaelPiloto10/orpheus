Well, I'm a steamroller, baby  
I'm bound to roll all over you  
Yes, I'm a steamroller now, baby  
I'm bound to roll all over you  
I'm gonna inject your soul with some sweet rock 'n roll  
And shoot you full of rhythm and blues  
  
Well, I'm a cement mixer  
A churning urn of burning funk  
Yes, I'm a cement mixer for you, baby  
A churning urn of burning funk  
Well, I'm a demolition derby (yeah)  
A hefty hunk of steaming junk  
  
Now, I'm a napalm bomb, baby  
Just guaranteed to blow your mind  
Yeah, I'm a napalm bomb for you, baby  
Oh, guaranteed, just guaranteed to blow your mind  
And if I can't have your love for my own (now)  
Sweet child, won't be nothing left behind  
It seems how lately, baby  
Got a bad case steamroller blues
