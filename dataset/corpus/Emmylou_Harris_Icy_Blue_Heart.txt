She came on to him like a slow moving cold front  
His beer was warmer that the look in her eye  
She sat on the stool, and she said "What do you want  
She said Give me a love that don't freeze up inside  
He said, I have melted some hearts in my time dear  
But to sit next to you Lord I shiver and shake  
And if I knew love, well I don't think I'd be here  
Askin' myself if I had what it takes  
To melt your icy blue heart  
  
Should I start to turn what's been frozen for years  
Into a river of tears  
These days we all play cool calm and collected  
Our lips could turn blue just shooting the breeze  
But under the frost, wee thought he detected  
A warm blush of red, and the touch of her knee  
He said you're a beauty like I've never witnessed  
And I've seen the northern lights dance in the air  
I've felt the cold that can follow the first kiss  
And there's not enough heat in the fires burning there  
To melt your icy blue heart  
  
Should I start to turn what's been frozen for years  
Into a river of tears  
To melt your icy blue heart
