Seven years of hard luck, comin' down on me  
From the Florida border, yeah up to Nashville, Tennessee  
I worked in every joint you can name, mister every honky tonk  
Along come Mr. Yankee Slicker, sayin' maybe you're what I want  
  
[Chorus]  
Want you to sign your contract  
Want you to sign today  
Gonna give you lots of money  
Workin' For MCA  
  
Nine thousand dollars, that's all we could win  
But we smiled at the Yankee Slicker with a big ol' Southern grin  
They're gonna take me out to California,  
Gonna make me a superstar  
Just pay me all of my money  
And mister maybe you won't get a scar  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Suckers took my money since I was seventeen  
If it ain't no pencil pusher, it got to be a honky tonk queen  
But I'll sign my contract baby, and I want you people to know  
That every penny that I make, I'm gonna see where my money goes  
  
[Chorus]
