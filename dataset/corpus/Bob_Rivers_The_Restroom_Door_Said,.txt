The restroom door said gentlemen  
So I just walked inside  
I took two steps and realized  
I'd been taken for a ride  
I heard high voices turned and found  
The place was occupied  
By two nuns, three old ladies and a nurse  
What could be worse  
Than two nuns, three old ladies and a nurse?  
  
The restroom door said gentlemen  
It must have been a gag  
As soon as I walked in there  
I ran into some old hag  
She sprayed me with a can of mace  
And smacked me with her bag  
I could tell this just wouldn't be my day  
What can I say?  
It was just turning out to be day  
  
The restroom door said gentlemen  
And I would like to find  
The crummy little creep who had the nerve  
To switch the signs  
'Cause I got two black eyes  
And one high heel up my behind  
Now I can't sit with comfort and joy  
Boy oh boy  
No I'll never sit with comfort and joy
