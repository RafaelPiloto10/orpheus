[Verse 1:]  
To bring this world to life  
To heal this heart of mine  
Your grace enough  
Your grace enough  
  
[Verse 2:]  
To mend this world in need  
To break the chains in me  
Your grace enough  
Now this means love  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
The weight of all our sin upon His shoulders  
That we should all be called  
Your sons and daughters  
  
[Chorus:]  
Father  
Let heaven and earth collide  
In the endless wonder  
Of Your love upon the cross  
We will follow  
And offer this life forever  
To see Your love unfold  
  
[Verse 3:]  
Adopted as Your own  
Alive to make You known  
Now this means love  
This means love  
  
[Chorus:]  
Father  
Let heaven and earth collide  
In the endless wonder  
Of Your love upon the cross  
We will follow  
And offer this life forever  
To see Your love unfold  
  
[Bridge:]  
For the lost and for the broken  
For the slave and for the orphan  
For everyone to realize Your love  
  
From the famous to the faceless  
From the beggar to the king  
For everyone to realize Your love  
  
You restore the broken hearted  
You bring freedom to the captive  
For one and all  
Forever this means love  
  
All Your children come together  
All Your sons and all Your daughters  
Your grace enough  
Forever this means love  
Singing  
  
[Chorus:]  
Father  
Let heaven and earth collide  
In the endless wonder  
Of Your love upon the cross  
We will follow  
And offer this life forever  
To see Your love unfold
