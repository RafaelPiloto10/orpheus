Out on highway 1, I saw a camper van parked out on the shoulder  
Thinkin' they had broken down, I pulled over  
There was a little old lady and her old man kickin' back relaxin'  
They said "sit down and help us celebrate our golden anniversary"  
They had foldin' chairs, they were holdin' hands starin' at the fields  
I said "man this ain't no movie, this is real"  
  
Love should be as simple as that  
Foldin' chairs, holdin' hands and matching baseball caps  
Love is wanting what you have  
Love should be as simple as that  
  
They said "stay awhile", I said "I thought I might and ask some burnin'
questions"  
Like how'd you make love last so long, they started laughing  
He said "to keep our love from danger, I treat her like a stranger"  
Courteous, considerate and kind  
  
Love should be as simple as that  
Foldin' chairs, holdin' hands and matching baseball caps  
Love is wanting what you have  
Love should be as simple as that  
  
So I went home and I said "baby, baby listen"  
There's something missin' in our lives  
She said "I know, I been tryin' to tell you"  
We need more communication, an exotic vacation  
Big screen TV, redwood jacuzzi  
Dinners out, concerts and movies  
New kitchen, big addition, a pool, jewelry  
Sauna, fish pond and a five acre lawn  
I said "get in the camper"  
  
Love should be as simple as that  
Foldin' chairs, holdin' hands and matching baseball caps  
Love is wanting what you have  
Love should be as simple as that  
  
Love should be as simple as that  
Love should be as simple as that
