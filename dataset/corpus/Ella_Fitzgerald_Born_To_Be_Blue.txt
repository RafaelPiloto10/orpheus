Some folks were meant to live in clover,  
But they are such a chosen few  
And clover being green is something I've never seen  
Cause I was born to be blue  
  
When there's a yellow moon above me,  
They say there's moonbeams I should view  
But moonbeams being gold are something I can't behold  
Cause I was born to be blue  
  
When I met you the world was bright and sunny  
When you left the curtain fell  
I'd like to laugh but nothing strikes me funny  
Now my world's a faded pastel  
  
Well, I guess I'm luckier than some folks,  
I've known the thrill of loving you  
And that alone is more than I was created for  
Cause I was born to be blue
