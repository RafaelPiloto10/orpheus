Some day in some old familiar rain will come along and know my name  
And then my shelter will be gone and I'll have to move along  
But till I do I'll stay awhile and track the hidden country of your smile  
Some day the man I used to be will come along and call on me  
And then because I'm just a man you'll find my feet are made of sand  
But till that time I'll tell you lies and chart the hidden boundrys of your
eyes  
Some day the world I used to know will come along and lead me go  
Then I'll be leaving you behind for love is just a state of mind  
But till that day I'll be your man and love away your troubles if I can  
And till that day I'll be your man and love away your troubles if I can
