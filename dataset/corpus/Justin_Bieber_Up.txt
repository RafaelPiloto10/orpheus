It's a big big world  
It's easy to get lost in it  
You've always been my girl (ah)  
And I'm not ready to call it quits  
We can make the sun shine in the moonlight  
We can make the gray clouds turn to blue skies  
I know it's hard baby believe, me  
  
That we can go nowhere but up  
From here my dear  
Baby we can go nowhere but up  
Tell me what we got to fear  
We'll take you to the sky past the moon  
Through the galaxy  
As long as you're with me baby  
Honestly (honestly)  
With the strength of our love  
We can go nowhere but up  
  
It's a big, big world  
And girl, I'm gonna show you all of it  
I'm gonna lace you with pearls, oh  
From every ocean that we're swimming in  
We can make the sun shine in the moonlight  
We can make those gray clouds turn to blue skies  
Yeah I know it's hard baby believe me (oh)  
  
That we can go nowhere but up  
From here my dear  
Baby we can go nowhere but up, oh  
Tell me what we got to fear  
We'll take you to the sky past the moon  
To the galaxies  
As long as you're with me baby  
Honestly (honestly)  
With the strength of our love  
We can go nowhere but up  
(Nowhere but oh up, whoa whoa)  
(Nowhere but oh up, whoa whoa)  
  
Baby we were underground  
We're on the surface now  
We're gonna make it girl I promise  
If you believe in love  
And you believe in us  
We can go nowhere but up  
  
We can go nowhere but up (yeah yeah)  
From here my dear (yeah whoa)  
Baby we can go nowhere but up  
Just tell me what we got to fear  
We'll take you to the sky past the moon  
To the galaxy  
As long as you're with me baby  
Honestly (honestly)  
With the strength of our love  
We can go nowhere but up  
  
(We can go oh oh, whoa whoa)  
Nowhere but up  
(We can go oh oh, whoa whoa)  
Whoa  
(Nowhere but oh up, whoa whoa)  
Yeah  
(Nowhere but oh up, whoa whoa)  
Yeah yeah
