Everybody's talkin' 'bout me  
I don't hear a word they're sayin'  
Only the echoes in my mind  
Everybody stops to starin'  
I don't even see their faces  
Only the shadows of their eyes  
I'm goin' where the sun keeps shinin'  
Through the fallin' rain  
Going where the weather suits my clothes  
Bankin' off the northeast wind  
And sailin' on summer breeze  
Skippin' over the ocean like a stone  
  
Everybody's talkin' 'bout me  
I don't hear a word they're sayin'  
Only the echoes of my mind  
Everybody stops to starin'  
I don't even see their faces  
Only the shadows of their eyes  
I won't let you leave my love behind  
I won't let you leave my love behind  
I won't let you leave my love behind
