I've been believing in something so distant as if I was human  
And I've been denying this feeling of hopelessness  
In me, in me  
  
All the promises I made just to let you down  
You believed in me, but I'm broken  
I have nothing left  
And all I feel is this cruel wanting  
We've been falling for all this time  
And now I'm lost in paradise  
  
As much as I'd like the past not to exist it still does  
And as much as I'd like to fell like I belong here  
I'm just as scared as you  
  
I have nothing left  
And all I feel is this cruel wanting  
We've been falling for all this time  
And now I'm lost in paradise  
  
Run away, run away  
One day we won't feel this pain anymore  
Take it all the way  
Shadows of you  
'Cause they won't let me go  
  
So I have nothing left  
And all I feel is this cruel wanting  
We've been falling for all this time  
And now I'm lost in paradise  
  
Alone, and lost in paradise
