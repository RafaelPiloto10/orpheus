Don' t tell me love makes the world go round  
That is how it used to be  
So many years ago yeah  
These days we' re living in  
Everything needs a dollar  
These days we' re living in  
Everything needs some money  
You can' t get no love without the dollar  
You can' t get no justice without the dollar  
So everything is.........  
  
[Chorus:]  
Money money money  
  
Judge dread I know I' ve done something wrong here  
And today you' re here  
To put me away forever  
But before you bring that hammer down  
Look what I have in my hand  
Yeah, the wheels of justice  
They turn so slow  
But with this we can make them turn faster  
Than a rocket in my favour  
Doesn't matter what they say  
I've done here today  
Just look the other way  
Like you always do  
When you see......  
  
[Chorus till fade]
