Wait for me I'll understand  
I just need time to comprehend your changes  
There's always been these changes in you  
I remember that there was a time when  
Fears we had we left behind and we danced  
But it seems the more we learn  
We learn that it's  
  
Over, Over  
It's dangerous this game we play  
You're killing me with words  
  
Forget if you can  
The way you moved when our hands touched  
You forced me to force you  
Do you remember the dreams,  
the nightmares we shared?  
The poison of love so pure it's deceiving  
And deceit is all we have it's got to be over  
  
Over, Over  
It's dangerous this game we play  
You're killing me with words  
Over, Over  
Too late to take a chance again it's over
