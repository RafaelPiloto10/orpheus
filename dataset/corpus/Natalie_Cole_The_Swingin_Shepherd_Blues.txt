Along the mountain pass  
There is a patch of grass  
Where the swingin' shepherd plays a tune  
His sheep never stray  
Dancin' all day  
Until they see the palin' yellow moon  
And then he leads his flock  
And homeward they all rock  
To the tune of the swingin' shepherd blues  
  
Chorus:  
This i-is something really extra special  
A ditty we like to do just for you  
It's the onliest swinginest grooviest thingy that we've ever done  
And if you like it then before we are thru  
Then you ought to move along groove and join this song and I don't have to
repeat  
It's swing!  
Ah yes!  
Now it's complete. Wooh!
