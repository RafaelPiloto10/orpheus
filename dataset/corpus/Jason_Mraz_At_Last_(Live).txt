So thank you guys so much for comin' around, stickin' around.  
Some of you who came to both shows, that's really cool.  
  
Well you see at last  
My love well she's come along  
And my lonely days well they're finally over  
And my life is like a song  
At la-ya-ya-ya-ya-yast, at la-a-a-a-ast, oh at last, at last, oh  
  
Oh, this night above, well it looks like all of you  
But you know, my heart is always wrapped up in Toca  
(audience laughing)  
(Jason: Ha ha)  
Oh, the way he plays the fool-oo-oo  
Well well - do do do do do  
  
Oh, did you bring your french horn tonight with you Mr. T  
(yeah I brought the french horn)  
French me with your horny, horny, horny, horny, horn  
  
Woah-ooo-ooo  
Wah-ah ah  
Woah-ooo-ooo  
Wah  
  
You know he plays the low notes, but he sings the high notes.  
Again this is Mr. Ian Sheridan our friend.  
  
You know what that sounds like?  
Sounds like - love, (laughing) life's sweetest reward  
It's an open sword  
  
(Toca: sword?)  
  
Hey love, exciting and new (laughing)  
Come aboard, we're expecting you  
On the loooove boat (applause)  
Soon we'll be making another run  
On the loooove boat oh-oh-oh  
I'm lookin' to dock my boat - oh  
  
(one, two)
