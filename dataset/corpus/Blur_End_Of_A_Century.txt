She says there's ants in the carpet  
Dirty little monsters  
Eating all the morsels  
Picking up the rubbish  
Give her effervescence  
She needs a little sparkle  
Good morning TV  
You're looking so healthy  
  
[Chorus]  
We all say  
Don't want to be alone  
We wear the same clothes  
Cause we feel the same  
We kiss with dry lips  
When we say goodnight  
End of a century, oh, it's nothing special  
  
Sex on the TV  
Everybody's at it  
The mind gets dirty  
As you get closer to thirty  
He gives her a cuddle  
They're glowing in a huddle  
Good night TV  
You're all made up  
And you're looking like me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Can you eat her yes you can  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Oh, end of a century, oh, it's nothing special
