Let me take you far away  
You'd like a holiday  
Let me take you far away  
You'd like a holiday  
  
It sends the cold days from the sun  
The good time and fun  
Let me take you far away  
You'd like a holiday  
  
Let me take you far away  
You'd like a holiday  
Let me take you far away  
You'd like a holiday  
  
It sends your troubles for so long  
Wherever you are  
Let me take you far away  
You'd like a holiday  
  
Ooh, ooh, oh  
Ahh  
Ahh  
  
Longing for the sun  
You will come on the island without me  
Longing for the sun  
We will come on the island  
Many miles away from home  
We will come on the island without me  
  
It sends you troubles for so long  
Wherever you are  
Let me take you far away  
You'd like a holiday  
  
Longing for the sun  
You will come to the island without me  
Longing for the sun  
We will come on the island  
Many miles away from home  
We will come on the island without me  
  
Let me take you far away  
You'd like a holiday  
Let me take you far away  
You'd like a holiday  
Ooh  
Aah  
Ahh
