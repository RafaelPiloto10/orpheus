My white bicycle, my white bicycle  
  
Riding all around the street  
Four o'clock and they're all asleep  
I'm not tired and it's so late  
Moving fast everything looks great.  
  
My white bicycle, my white bicycle  
  
See that man, he's all alone  
Looks so happy but he's far from home  
Ring my bell, smile at him  
Better kick over his garbage bin  
  
My white bicycle, my white bicycle  
  
The rain comes down but I don't care  
The wind is blowing in my hair  
Seagulls flying in the air  
  
My white bicycle, my white bicycle  
  
Policeman shouts but I don't see him  
They're one thing I don't believe in  
To find some charge but it's not leavin'  
  
Lift both hands, his head in disgrace  
Shines no light upon my face  
Through the darkness, we still speed  
My white bicycle and me  
  
My white bicycle, my white bicycle
