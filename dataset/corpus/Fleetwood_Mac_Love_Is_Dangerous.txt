Oh there's a stranger  
Standing in the shadows of love  
Oh the danger  
Demands what you're needing of  
  
Be careful what you love  
Be careful what you need  
Be careful what you say  
Be careful who you please, careful who  
you please  
  
Love, love, love  
Love is dangerous  
Love...  
Love is dangerous  
  
Oh there's no warning  
That takes you to the promised land  
Hearts made of crystal  
Crumble like castles of sand  
  
Echoes of emotion  
And the visions of a fool  
Echoes of forbidden ground  
And it's too good to be true, too good  
to be true  
  
Love, love, love  
Love is dangerous  
Love...  
Love is dangerous  
  
Standing at the crossroads  
Ooh yeah this is wild  
Maybe it's my crossroads  
Maybe this is mine  
Maybe this is mine, oooh  
  
Love, love, love  
Love is dangerous  
Love...  
Love is dangerous  
Don't be a fool  
  
Love, love, love  
Love is dangerous  
Love...  
Love is dangerous
