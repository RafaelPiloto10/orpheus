Oh have you seen my dear companion  
For he was all this world to me  
I hear he's gone to some far country  
And that he cares no more for me  
I wish I were a swallow flying  
I'd fly to a high and lonesome place  
I'd join the wild birds in their crying  
Thinking of you and your sweet face  
Oh have you seen my dear companion  
For he was all this world to me  
But now the stars have turned against me  
And he cares no more for me  
Oh when the dark is on the mountain  
And all the world has gone to sleep  
I will go down to the cold dark waters  
And there I'll lay me down and weep  
Oh have you seen my dear companion  
Oh have you seen my dear companion  
Oh have you seen my dear companion  
For he was all this world to me
