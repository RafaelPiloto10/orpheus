We never talk to one another  
We just disagree  
I'm the one who runs for cover  
And you turn your back on me  
  
They say nothing's gonna last forever  
But some things are worth fighting for  
Yeah, well love could bring us back together  
But love don't come round here no more  
  
The words unspoken in the night  
Locked away in my heart  
And I'm feeling out of place  
But if love is the key  
Let it open the door  
So we'll be standing -- face to face  
  
You never want to see me face to face  
Think it over  
Face to face  
If only it could be just face to face  
  
Baby you and me  
Face to face  
  
I may be better off without it  
I can't go on this way  
Time has come to talk about it  
This is our judgement day  
  
You know we swore it would last forever  
Always felt so sure it would  
But it's looking like now or never  
Time to turn a bad thing into good  
  
The words that echo in the night  
They're fading away  
And they're gone without a trace  
Now it's up to you and me  
Let's open the door  
And meet each other -- face to face  
  
It's time we saw each other face to face  
To talk it over  
Face to face  
You know it's gotta be just face to face  
Baby you and me  
Face to face  
  
We gotta see each other -- face to face  
And talk about it  
Face to face  
Hope it ain't too late to meet face to face  
Just you and me  
[solo]  
  
Face to Face  
It's time we saw each other face to face  
To talk it over  
Face to face  
You know it's gotta be just face to face  
Baby you and me  
  
Face to face  
We gotta see each other  
face to face  
And talk about it  
Face to face  
I hope it ain't too late to meet  
Face to face  
Don't turn your back on me  
Face to face  
It's time we saw each other  
Face to face  
To talk it over
