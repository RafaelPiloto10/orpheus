Put me in  
A special school  
'Cause I am such a fool  
And I don't need  
A single book  
To teach me how to read  
Who needs stupid books?  
They are for petty crooks  
And I will learn  
By studying  
The lesson in my dreams  
Turn off the TV  
'Cause that's what others see  
And movies are as bad as  
Eating chocolate ice cream  
They only sicken me  
Don't let me play football  
I'll sack the quarterback  
A jack the brother of the ball  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a troublemaker  
Never been a faker  
Doing things my own way  
And never giving up  
I'm a troublemaker  
Not a double taker  
I don't have  
The patience  
To keep it on the up  
  
I picked up a guitar  
What does that signify?  
I'm gonna play  
Some heavy metal riffs  
And you will die  
You wanted arts  
And crafts  
How's this for arts  
And crafts  
...  
That's right  
I'm growing out my hair  
I'm movin' out  
To Cherokee  
I'm gonna be  
A rock star  
And you will go  
To bed with me  
'Cause I can't work a job,  
Like any other slob,  
Punch it in  
And punch it out  
And suckin' up to Bob,  
Marrying a bitch  
Having 7 kids  
Giving up  
And growing old  
And hoping  
There's a God  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm gonna be a star  
And people  
Will crane necks  
To get a glimpse of me  
And see  
If I am having a sex  
In studying  
And my moves  
They try  
To understand  
Why I am so unlike  
The singers  
In the other bands  
  
I'm such a mystery  
As anyone can see  
There isn't  
Anybody else  
Exactly quite  
Like me'  
  
And when  
It's party time  
Like 1999  
I party by myself  
Because I'm such  
A special guy  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Keep it on the up)  
I'm a troublemaker  
(Keep it on the up)  
I'm a troublemaker  
(Keep it on the up)  
I'm a troublemaker  
Never giving up
