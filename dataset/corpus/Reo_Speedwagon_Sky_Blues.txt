I was sittin' on a plane, I was lookin' at the dreary day  
I saw somebody, she was sittin' just an aisle away  
She was a first class lady, and I knew that she looked refined  
My heart started thumpin' louder than the engine whine  
  
I got the sky blues, I'm up in the air  
Runnin' from a lady who just don't care  
And all I want to do is get down to earth with you  
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo, I got the sky blues  
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo, I got the sky blues  
  
Well, I sat down beside her and I told her I was feeling blue  
I said, "My girl don't want me and it's breaking my heart in two"  
Well I felt so bad that I didn't even stick around. I said,  
"We may be flying but heart's draggin' on the ground."
