Every road that I walk  
Every single flight I ever take  
Though I'm thousands of miles away  
In my mind every journey leads me closer to you  
I've been all around this world  
I've been in far too many states  
But I'm under your spell  
I've made my mistakes, oh you can probably tell  
  
You're every dream that I dream  
You're every beautiful thing I've ever seen  
I'm always singing your praises  
Counting the days away  
I would be your slave  
I'd even be your fool  
I'm so in love with you  
I'm in love with you baby  
I'm gonna break every rule  
  
I hope you can forgive  
Every white lie I'm forced to tell  
They say that everything's fair in love and in war  
And I'm not above cheating for you  
One night I'll catch you off your guard  
And you'll finally fall so hard  
Strategically speaking I'm already beaten  
I'll surrender to you  
  
You're every dream that I dream  
You're every beautiful thing I've ever seen  
I'm always singing your praises  
Counting the days away  
I would be your slave  
I'd even be your fool  
I'm so in love with you  
I'm in love with you baby  
I'm gonna break every rule  
  
Every road that I walk on  
Every flight that I ever take  
Every dream that I dream of  
Every journey brings me closer
