Let's go  
  
Just in time found me just in time  
Before you came my time was running low  
I was lost them losing dice were tossed  
My bridges all were crossed nowhere to go  
Now you're here now I know just where I'm going  
No more doubt fear I've found my way  
Your love came just in time you found me just in time  
And changed my lonely nights that lucky day  
  
Just in time  
  
Before you you came my time was running low oh baby  
I was lost them losing dice were tossed  
My bridges all were crossed nowhere to go  
Now you're here now I know just where I'm going  
No more doubt or fear I've found my way  
Your love came just in time you've found me just in time  
And changed my lonely nights an changed my lonely nights  
And changed my lonely nights an changed my lonely nights  
And changed my lonely nights that lucky day
