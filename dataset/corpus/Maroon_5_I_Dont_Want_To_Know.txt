[Verse 1]  
Wasted the more I think, the more I think about you  
But no I can't take it  
[????]  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Do your thing on me  
How we used to be  
Is it better now that I'm not around?  
Things are left astray  
Yelling out your name  
Are you happy now?  
Are you happy now?  
[Chorus]  
I don't wanna know know know know  
Who's taking you home home home home  
I'm loving you so so so so  
The way I used to love you, oh  
I don't wanna know know know know  
Who's taking you home home home home  
I'm loving you so so so so  
The way I used to love you, oh  
I don't wanna know  
  
[Verse 2]  
And I every time I go out  
I hear it from this one, I hear it from that one  
Mentioning someone new  
Yeah  
Say I don't believe it  
I'm losing my head  
Must've been my bad  
Maybe I'm just a fool  
  
[Bridge]  
Wasted  
The more I drink, the more I'm thinking about you  
But no, I can't take it  
Maybe I should just go on without you, no  
  
[Chorus 2]  
I don't wanna know  
Who's taking you home  
I'm loving you so  
The way I used to love you, no  
I don't wanna know  
Who's taking you home  
I'm loving you so  
The way I used to love you, no  
  
Yeah, yeah, woah oh oh oh
