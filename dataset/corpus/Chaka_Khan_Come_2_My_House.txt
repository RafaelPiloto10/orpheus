I've got this feelin' inside  
And it won't go away  
It'll take time for it to subside  
And oh by the way  
Come 2 my house  
Where we can play  
Like I'm your flower  
We'll hide and seek  
Then we will find  
Love's highest power  
Could you stop by for some really good beer  
Or a glass of wine  
There's no threat, there's no danger here  
If you fore go, go the time  
A look in your eyes  
And you remind  
Me of my daddy  
I can't say why  
I decided tonight  
Yes, you can have me  
Love will surrender  
Oh, when the heart cries out  
Don't leave me standin' here  
Not here, not now
