As I roved out one evening fair  
It bein' the summertime to take the air  
I spied a sailor and a lady gay  
And I stood to listen  
And I stood to listen to hear what they would say.  
  
He said "Fair lady, why do you roam  
For the day is spent and the night is on"  
She heaved a sigh while the tears did roll  
"For my dark-eyed sailor  
For my dark-eyed sailor, so young and stout and bold."  
  
"'Tis seven long years since he left this land  
A ring he took from off his lily-white hand  
One half of the ring is still here with me  
But the other's rollin'  
But the other's rollin' at the bottom of the sea."  
  
He said "You may drive him out of your mind  
Some other young man you will surely find  
Love turns aside and soon cold has grown  
  
Like the winter's morning  
Like the winter's morning, the hills are white with  
Snow."  
  
She said "I'll never forsake my dear  
Although we're parted this many a year  
Genteel he was and a rake like you  
To induce a maiden  
To induce a maiden to slight the jacket blue."  
  
One half of the ring did young William show  
She ran distracted in grief and woe  
Sayin' "William, William, I have gold in store  
For my dark-eyed sailor  
For my dark-eyed sailor has proved his honour long"  
  
And there is a cottage by yonder lea  
This couple's married and does agree  
So maids be loyal when your love's at sea  
For a cloudy morning  
For a cloudy morning brings in a sunny day.
