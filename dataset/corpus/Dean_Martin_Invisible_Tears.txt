Invisible tears in my eyes, incredible pain in my heart  
Indestructible memories are passing in the view  
Impossible, all things may get, improbable, I will forget  
Indelible memories of sweet lovable you  
  
You're back again, so I let you in  
Although I'm only seeing pictures of the past  
Those arms they aren't real but somehow I feel  
If I just close my eyes then maybe it will last  
  
Invisible tears in my eyes, incredible pain in my heart  
Indestructible memories are passing in the view  
Impossible, all things may get, improbable, I will forget  
Indelible memories of sweet lovable you  
  
Indelible memories of sweet lovable you  
Indelible memories of sweet lovable you
