I had a heartache, I cried a tear  
There was a girl I met, she doesn't care  
Oh bad baby doll what's wrong with you  
Why did you leave this way  
When you tore the love we shared I cried  
When you told me that you love me, oh you lied  
Well I'm findin' out again, into love I shouldn't fall  
Oh why-why-why, oh my baby doll  
  
Sometimes I sit around, I'm feelin' all alone  
I try to call you but you won't pick up that phone  
Ooh bad baby doll look what you do, I can't go on this way  
Why can't we get together to explain  
Just why I've left you standin' in the rain  
Well I'm findin' out again, into love I shouldn't fall  
Oh why-why-why, oh my baby doll
