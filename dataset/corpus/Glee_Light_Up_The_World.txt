Hey you and me keep on dancing in the dark,  
It's been tearing me apart, never knowing what we are  
Hey you and me keep on tryin' to play it cool,  
Now it's time to make a move  
And that's what I'm gonna do  
  
Lay it all down  
Got something to say  
Lay it all down  
Throw your doubt away  
Do or die now  
Step on to the plate  
Blow the door wide open like up up and away  
  
Let's light up the world tonight  
You gotta give up the bark and bite  
I know that we got the love alright  
Come on and light it up, light it up tonight  
  
Let's light up the world tonight  
You gotta give up the bark and bite  
I know that we got the love alright  
Come on and light it up, light it up tonight  
  
Hey you and me turn it up ten thousand watts  
Tell me why we've gotta stop, I just want to let it rock  
  
Hey you and me keep on tearing at the road  
Like we don't know where to go, step back, then we take control  
  
Lay it all down  
Got something to say  
Lay it all down  
Throw your doubt away  
Do or die now  
Step on to the plate  
Blow the door wide open like up up and away  
  
Let's light up the world tonight  
You gotta give up the bark and bite  
I know that we got the love alright  
Come on and light it up, light it up tonight
