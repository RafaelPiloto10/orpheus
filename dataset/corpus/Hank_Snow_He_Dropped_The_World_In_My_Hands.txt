I loved you before you met him and I loved even after you were wed  
I told you I'd never forget you that I'd be here when his love was dead  
Now you're back in my arms and I'm happy  
And I guess he knows just where he stands  
'Cause when he lied and cheated on you that's when he dropped the world in my
hands  
  
Didn't he realize what he was losing to give you up he must happened insane  
And to him it just didn't seem to matter that his love was another man's game  
It's his right if he wants to be a fool but I wonder if he really understands  
That when he gave your love back to me that's when he dropped the world in my
hands
