"Beautiful Reality"  
  
I sometimes believe that everything I dream  
Will one day be my reality  
I sometimes think that every move I make  
Will gather up and shape my reality  
  
I can only dream  
I can only hope  
That one day I will see  
A beautiful reality  
I can only wish  
And I can only want  
That one day I will see  
A beautiful reality  
  
I sometimes search for signs my dreams can work  
Until I stand alert with my reality  
I sometimes look in the paradise by the book  
To give back what I took from my reality  
  
I can only dream  
I can only hope  
That one day I will see  
A beautiful reality  
I can only wish  
And I can only want  
That I will one day see  
A beautiful reality  
  
I can only dream  
I can only hope  
That one day I will see  
A beautiful reality  
I can only wish  
And I can only want  
That I will one day see  
A beautiful reality  
  
Beautiful, beautiful reality  
A beautiful reality  
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful  
Beautiful reality
