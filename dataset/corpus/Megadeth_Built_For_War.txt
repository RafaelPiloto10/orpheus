Built for war, what do you think your fists are for? Built for war!  
  
Listen, I didn't start this believe me, I will finish it  
You called down the thunder too late now there's no way out  
Nothing is gonna stop me until then better watch your back  
  
Built for war, what do you think your fists are for? Built for war!  
  
There is no retreating I will cut you down to size  
You will beg for mercy a bad seed, you're as good as dead  
Yield to new dimension Hell's coming, better say your prayers  
  
Built for war, what do you think your fists are for? Built for war!  
Built for war, are you looking at me, you want some more?  
What do you think your fists are for?  
  
One day you will face me and see the terror trapped inside  
Final retribution torture and pure punishment  
Vengeance running so deep a dungeon of agony awaits  
Fear not as death surrounds you  
Bitch all you want, but here it comes  
  
Built for war, what do you think your fists are for? Built for war!  
Built for war, are you looking at me, you want some more?  
What do you think your fists are for?
