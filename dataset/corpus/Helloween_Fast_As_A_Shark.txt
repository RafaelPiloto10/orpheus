Fog in the streets  
A church clock beats  
Midnight, darkness all around  
  
You better beware  
You better take care  
Be prepared for the shock  
  
The time has come  
And he's the one  
Who's breathing down your neck  
  
Coming from behind  
Now it's your time  
A loser will die  
  
Fast as a shark he'll cut out of the dark  
He's a killer, he'll rip out your heart  
On a one way track and you're not coming back  
Because the killer is on the attack  
  
Surprise attack  
Coming from the back  
An expert of the deadly knack  
  
Just take care  
Just beware  
Be prepared for the fight  
  
Fast as a shark he'll cut out of the dark  
He's a killer, he'll rip out your heart  
On a one way track and you're not coming back  
Because the killer is on the attack  
  
Watch out, watch out  
  
Fast as a shark he'll cut out of the dark  
He's a killer - he'll rip out your heart  
On a one way track and you're not coming back  
Because the killer is on the attack  
  
Fast as a shark he'll cut out of the dark  
He's a killer, he'll rip out your heart  
On a one way track and you're not coming back  
Because the killer's  
Because the killer's  
Because the killer's on the attack
