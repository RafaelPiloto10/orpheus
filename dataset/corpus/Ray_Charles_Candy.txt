Candy, I call my sugar Candy  
Because I'm sweet on Candy  
And Candy's sweet on me  
  
She understands me  
My understanding Candy  
And Candy's always handy  
When I need sympathy  
  
I wish that there were four of her  
So I could love much more of her  
She has taken my complete heart  
Got a sweet tooth for my sweetheart  
  
Candy, it's gonna be just dandy  
The day I take my Candy  
And make her mine, all mine
