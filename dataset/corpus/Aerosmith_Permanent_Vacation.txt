I got a letter from a friend the other morning  
He say it's hot down by Montego Bay  
I got the point and now I think it's finally dawning  
Yeah, yeah, I got to get away  
I got to take myself a Permanent Vacation  
The sky's the limit, but my plane won't fly  
My nose is clean and Lordie don't need no sedation  
Yeah, yeah, and that's the reason why  
I really need it, really, really need St. Tropez  
I want a tan where the sun it never shines  
I really need it, really, really need St. Tropez  
You best believe it that I got to get away  
I got a sister, man she really got a pin head  
She think she kinky but she can't get straight  
She say she livin', but I kinda think she's brain dead  
Just excess baggage on a late night freight  
I really need it, really, really need St. Tropez  
I want a tan where the sun it never shines  
I really need it, really, really need St. Tropez  
You best believe it that I got to get away  
I gotta take me on a Permanent Vacation  
The girl's be cummin' down in Cayman Brack  
I gotta hand it to a firm situation  
Yeah, yeah, got to cut me some slack  
I really need it, really, really need St. Tropez  
I want a tan where the sun it never shines  
I really need it, really, really need St. Tropez  
I really need it, really need it, really really...
