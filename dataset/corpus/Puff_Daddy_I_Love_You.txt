I thought I would just have to say  
I need to meet you I will await the day  
I hear your voice so hear me out  
I need to stand up and and take a shout  
And say to god I will pray  
That you will come back to me and stay  
And stay for the reasons I love you  
And you should know by now my love is true  
So don't ask me these simple things  
Ill give you my love and dimond rings  
If you can just come over and talk to me  
And no lovin if you want just walk wit me  
I just want to see your pretty face  
Cause your face brings everyone grace  
And I wish you would never leave  
But no your gone I sit and plead  
To god that you will come back to me  
And we can live happily  
But that will never happen anytime  
But I say I love you and I wish you were mine
