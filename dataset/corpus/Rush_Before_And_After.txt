Love won't see my coming  
On a Sunday noon today  
Still don't believe we're fading  
But now the world should wait  
  
And now you're finally listening  
To what I have to say  
Well, the time is right  
And it is today  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Maybe we could talk about it  
And try to get it straight  
After all these years, baby,  
Maybe it's too late  
  
But I really need to  
Have you by my side  
And that's the only feeling  
Baby, I can't hide  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Well you aren't listening  
I ain't talking  
We ain't getting nowhere  
  
I keep trying to get  
Through to you baby  
All you do is stare  
  
I don't want to see that  
I need you by my side  
Well, I don't want to be your lover  
Babe, I want to be your man  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Well, now my story's over, baby  
And I ain't gonna tell it twice  
Well, you better start listening  
Or get out of my life  
  
Or you're gonna be left out  
I said left out in the cold  
Yeah, before you get my loving, babe  
You'll be too old  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Well, I'm talking to you baby  
Well, I said  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
