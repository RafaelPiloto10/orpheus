O come all ye faithful  
Joyful and triumphant  
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem  
Come and behold him  
Born the King of Angels  
  
O come let us adore him, O come let us adore him  
O come let us adore him, Christ the Lord  
  
Sing choirs of angels  
Sing in exaltation  
Oh sing all ye citizens of Heaven above  
Glory to God  
All glory in the highest  
  
O come let us adore him, O come let us adore him  
O come let us adore him, Christ the Lord  
  
Yeah Lord we greet thee  
Born this happy morning  
O Jesus to thee be all glory given  
Word of the Father  
Now in flesh appearing  
  
O come let us adore him,  
O come let us adore him,  
O come let us adore him,  
Christ the Lord,  
Christ the Lord  
O come let us adore him  
Christ the Lord
