You move like a flame of fire  
Your eyes like a flash of lightning  
You lie since you're cold inside  
And I'm gonna tame you, wild thing  
You'd better watch out  
I said you'd better watch out  
Watch out  
Anywhere you go I'll find you  
Watch out  
I'll be staying close behind you  
And I've tired of waiting (Oh-a-la-la)  
Yes it's driving me crazy (Oh-a-la-la-la)  
And my patience is fading (Oh-a-la-la)  
Oh, you'd better watch out  
I said you'd better watch out  
  
You speak and you're funny lately  
You act like I was a stranger  
I think you're beginning to hate me  
But then you're a girl in danger  
  
You'd better watch out  
Ooh, I said you'd better watch out  
Watch out  
Anywhere you go I'll find you  
Watch out  
I'll be staying close behind you  
And I've tired of waiting (Oh-a-la-la)  
Yes it's driving me crazy (Oh-a-la-la-la)  
And my patience is fading (Oh-a-la-la)  
So you'd better watch out  
Yes I said you'd better watch out  
Watch out  
Watch out  
  
And I've tired of waiting (Oh-a-la-la)  
Yes it's driving me crazy (Oh-a-la-la-la)  
And my patience is fading (Oh-a-la-la)  
I said you'd better watch out  
Oh girl you'd better watch out  
Ah, you'd better watch out  
Oh, ah, you'd better watch out
