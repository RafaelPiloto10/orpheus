You better come together  
Learn to love one another  
We got to come together  
Learn to love one another  
  
We got to come together  
Learn to love your brother  
We got to come together  
Learn to love your sister  
  
One eye can't see  
One ear don't hear  
One hand can't clap  
One foot don't run  
  
Where do we go from here  
Here, there or nowhere  
I said where do we go from here  
Here, there or nowhere  
  
One eye can't see  
One ear don't hear  
One hand can't clap  
One foot don't run  
  
Birds unite  
Fishes unite  
Animals unite  
Mankind still fight  
  
One eye can't see  
One ear don't hear  
One hand can't clap  
One foot don't run
