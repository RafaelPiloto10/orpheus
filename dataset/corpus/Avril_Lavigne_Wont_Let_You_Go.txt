[Verse:]  
When you're falling, you're crushing  
When your fire has turn to ashes  
You're screaming, your heart is bleeding  
When you're feeling like there's no reason  
  
[Refrain]  
I won't let you go  
No I, I won't let you go  
  
[Chorus:]  
Cause when you're all alone, and it's cold and there's no one to hold  
When you're feeling lost and there's nowhere, there's nowhere to go  
When you're feeling sad, don't forget you can reach for my hand  
When you're feeling down just remember  
I won't let you go, I won't let you go  
I won't let you go, I won't let you go  
  
[Verse 2:]  
When you're torn down, when you're messed up  
Don't you give in  
No, don't you give up.  
When you're drowning, and you're fading  
Always know that, I'm always waiting  
  
[Refrain]  
And I, I won't let you go  
No, I won't let you go  
  
[Chorus:]  
Cause when you're all alone, and it's cold and there's no one to hold  
When you're feeling lost and there's nowhere, there's nowhere to go  
When you're feeling sad, don't forget you can reach for my hand  
When you're feeling down just remember, remember, remember  
  
[Bridge:]  
When I said forever, I know that I meant forever  
And I won't let you down, I can always be found, and I'm always around  
  
[Chorus:]  
When you're all alone, it's cold, there's no one to hold  
When you're feeling lost and there's nowhere, nowhere  
When you're feeling sad, don't forget you can reach for my hand  
When you're feeling bad just remember  
I won't let you go, I won't let you go  
I won't let you go, I won't let you go  
Won't let you go
