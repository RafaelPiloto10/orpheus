A man like you, a man like you  
Could be my new beginning  
And get me on the winning side of life  
If I had you, a man like you  
All the fairy tales I dreamed about  
Just a breath ago would all come true  
  
If I had you baby  
If I had a man like you  
  
A man like you baby, just like you  
I'd share all of the precious things  
That I've been saving deep within my soul  
Well a man like you, and baby  
A little ol' sweet girl like me  
The two of us together  
Ride the waves forever and we'll be home free  
  
Well don't you feel it, yeah  
I need a man like you  
And all I want is to know  
I need you by my side yeah  
And I want to protect you baby  
From all things in life  
Well I do, yeah  
  
Oh, what I wouldn't do for a man like you  
A man like you, a man like you
