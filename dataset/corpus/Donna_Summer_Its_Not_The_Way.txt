We used to south of paradise  
That was okay until you put your heart on ice  
Walked out the door but you couldn't say goodbye  
Hide away and left me lonely  
When I asked you why  
You wouldn't be precise  
Now it's my turn, start taking my advice  
  
It's not the way that you love me  
It's not the way that you care  
  
Running down long back alleys  
Pouting like a spoiled child  
You've been acting so crazy, driving me wild  
Your heart is like an elevator  
You tell me that's just human nature  
I've done all I can, I can't seem to change you  
  
It's not the way that you love me  
It's not the way that you care  
  
Oh no, it's not the way  
Oh no, it's not the way  
Listen mister to what I say  
Oh no, it's not the way  
  
Your love is like a nasty habit  
I finally got control but I just can't take it  
I tried to be cool but I just can't make it  
Your heart is like an elevator  
You tell me that it's just human nature  
I've done all I can, but just can't change you  
  
Oh no, it's not the way  
Oh no, it's not the way  
Listen mister to what I say  
Oh no, it's not the way  
Oh no, it's not the way  
Listen mister to what I say  
Oh no, it's not the way  
  
Love is tough, love is tender  
Love will make your heart surrender  
Love is sweet, love is kind  
Love will always blow your mind  
  
It's not the way that you love me  
It's not the way that you care  
  
Oh no, it's not the way  
Oh no, it's not the way  
Listen mister to what I say  
Oh no, it's not the way  
Oh no, it's not the way  
Listen mister to what I say  
Oh no, it's not the way  
Oh no, it's not the way  
Listen mister to what I say  
Oh no, it's not the way  
Oh no, it's not the way  
Listen mister to what I say.
