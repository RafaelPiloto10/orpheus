Cataract blinding your eyes  
To the violent design  
Regenerating impending genocide  
It's the dawn of decay  
Mark the end of your days  
Just another lost casualty of the times  
  
The wicked will feed the chaos  
Control and rule disorder  
Disintegration's multiplying  
Till there is no more bloodline  
A future of never ending  
Insane civil disorder  
Free yourself from the red dawn  
The time has come  
  
Death's head shattering  
Blow to the throat  
At the end of the rope  
Degeneration that follows into the fire  
In a world gone insane  
No one else left to blame  
Your just another part of the collective vile  
  
The wicked will feed the chaos  
Control and rule disorder  
Disintegration's multiplying  
Till there is no more bloodline  
A future of never ending  
Insane civil disorder  
Free yourself from the red dawn  
The time is now  
  
Era of total destruction has slowly begun  
Yielding death none will survive  
Order out of chaos the true will of the Beast  
A life of desolation  
  
Ten bleeding hearts  
One wicked mind  
In spiritual sin  
Their time is now  
  
Era of total destruction will never disease  
Only death is your savior Order out of chaos the true will of the Beast  
A life of persecution  
  
Ten bleeding heats  
One wicked mind  
In spiritual sin  
Their time is now  
  
Famine, plagues, war and death  
Scourges preceding the end  
Death is your only savior  
  
Ten bleeding heats  
One wicked mind  
In spiritual sin  
Their time is now  
Bringing total annihilation
