Now the time has come when all is said and done  
We're back together on the road it's time to fly  
No more time to wait you know it feels so great  
Wearin leather on a horse of steel I ride  
I ain't waiting to get old I'm runnin hot I'm never cold  
Kiss my ass if you don't like me I don't care  
I got my wheels I got my friends we're on the road again  
We're all crazy gonna ride until we die  
  
Time to burn you losers better learn  
No one controls our goddamn lifes  
We'll do just what we feel riding horses made of steel  
We're here to burn up the night  
  
Losers try to put us down it's just another day  
I got no money or big house just got life  
I don't like to save it's more fun to spend  
If you like metal you're my friend  
And that bike out in the yard well that's my wife  
Don't try to understand me my family never will  
Had to punch my teacher out now he's chilled  
I might stay in school or die in prison  
Either way it's my decision one more beer and heavy metal  
And I'm just fine  
  
Time to burn you losers better learn  
No one controls our goddamn lifes  
We'll do just what we feel riding horses made of steel  
We're here to burn up the night  
  
We are the undefeated we're not living in the past  
We're here tonight to kick some goddamn ass  
Feel the power of the wheel lets drink to riding steel  
Livin hard and ridin fast  
  
Time to burn you losers better learn  
No one controls our goddam lifes  
We'll do just what we feel riding horses made of steel  
We're here to burn up the night
