Amazing grace! How sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost but now am found  
Was blind but now I see  
  
T'was grace that taught my heart to fear  
And grace my fears relieved  
Oh how precious did that grace appear  
The hour I first believed  
  
Amazing grace! How sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost but now am found  
Was blind but now I see  
  
Shall I be wafted to the skies  
On flowery beds of ease  
While others strive to win the prize  
And sail on bloody seas  
  
Amazing grace! How sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost but now am found  
Was blind but now I see
