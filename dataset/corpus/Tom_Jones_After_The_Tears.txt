Do you want a shoulder  
I only want to hold you  
In your hour of need  
I hate to say I told you so  
But you should've let him go  
It just wasn't meant to be  
  
Let me make your pain a little lighter  
I can help you make your world a little brighter  
  
I'll be there when the shouting's over  
I'll be here after the tears  
You just may need me to hold you  
I'll be here after the tears  
  
Just a matter of time now  
Till I make you mine now  
It could happen any day  
Waited patiently  
Now it looks like you're gonna be free  
The tide is turning my way  
  
I'll see you through all the confussion  
I'll be your only true solution  
  
I'll be here when the party's over  
I'll be here after the tears  
You just may need another lover  
I'll be here after the tears  
  
Hold on  
Love is not so far away  
Can you hear it calling  
Be strong  
I'll be waiting in the wings  
  
(I'll be here when the shouting's over)  
i can make it better  
(I'll be here after the tears)  
I can make it better  
(You just may need me to hold you)  
I can make it better  
(I'll be here after the tears)  
(I can make it better)  
  
I'll be here when the party's over  
(I can make it better)  
I'll be here after the tears  
(I can make it better)  
You just may need another lover  
(I can make it better)  
I'll be here after the tears  
(I can make it better)
