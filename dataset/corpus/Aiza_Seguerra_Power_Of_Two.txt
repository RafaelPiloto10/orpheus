Now the parking lot is empty  
Everyone's gone someplace  
I pick you up and in the trunk I've packed  
A cooler and a two day suitcase  
'Cause there's a place we like to drive  
Way out in the country  
Five miles out of the city limit we're singin'  
And your hand's upon my knees  
So we're ok, we're fine  
Baby I'm here to stop your crying  
Chase all the ghosts from your head  
I'm stronger than the monster beneath your bed  
Smarter than the tricks played on your heart  
Look at them together then we'll take them apart  
Adding up the total of a love that's true  
Multiply life by the power of two  
I know the things that I am afraid of  
I'm not afraid to tell  
And if we ever leave a legacy  
It's that we loved each other well  
'Cause I've seen the shadows of so many people  
Trying on the treasures of youth  
But a road fancy and fast ends in a fatal crash  
And I'm glad we got off to tell you the truth  
'Cause we're ok, we're fine  
Baby I'm here to stop your crying  
Chase all the ghosts from your head  
I'm stronger than the monster beneath your bed  
Smarter than the tricks played on your heart  
Look at them together then we'll take them apart  
Adding up the total of a love that's true  
Multiply life by the power of two  
All the shiny little trinkets of temptation  
Something new instead of something old  
But all you gotta do is scratch beneath the surface  
And it's fool's gold  
Fool's gold  
Now we're talking about a difficult thing  
And your eyes are getting wet  
I took us for better and I took us for worse  
And don't you ever forget it  
Now there's steel bars between me and a promise  
Suddenly bend with ease  
And the closer I'm bound in love to you  
The closer I am to free  
So we're ok, we're fine  
Baby I'm here to stop your crying  
Chase all the ghosts from your head  
I'm stronger than the monster beneath your bed  
Smarter than the tricks played on your heart  
Look at them together then we'll take them apart  
Adding up the total of a love that's true  
Multiply life by the power of two
