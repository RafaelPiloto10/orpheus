What did I do to deserve this?  
Tell me the truth and don't lie  
You're pretty good at that but, no not this time  
You walk around like you run the world  
Running your mouth, and talking about me now,  
They think that you're the perfect girl,  
They're gonna see everything so get back  
It's gonna come back around  
You know that this town is just too small and I'm too strong to take this
again  
Your dressed to impress but I have got news  
You know you're just gonna lose  
Everything and everyone that means so much to you.  
I'm feeling bad for,  
You are alone and nobody cares that you are  
One look into your eyes,  
Easy to see what you could be but you're not  
I say it's time that you give in,  
Since it was real, you cannot fulfill, you're over  
You feel your heart beat deep down  
Ignoring the shame of causing this pain,  
Just get out  
It's gonna come back around  
You know that this town is just too small and I'm too strong to take this
again  
You dress to impress but I got news  
You know you're just gonna lose  
Everything and everyone that means so much to you.  
Someway  
You keep hearing everything that people say  
And you can't take the pain another day  
It's coming back around  
I told you this town was just small  
You dress to impress but you can stop now  
Cuz it's gonna come back around  
And around and around and around and around  
Yeah yeah  
It's gonna come back around  
You know that this town is just too small and I'm too strong (Too strong)  
To take this, take this again [Whoa]  
You dress to impress but I've got news  
You know you're just gonna lose  
Everything and everyone that means so much to you  
Everything and everyone that means so much to you  
Everything and everyone that means so much to you.
