I think I fin'lly know you  
I can see beyond your smile  
I think that I can show you  
That what we've had is still worthwhile  
Don't you know that love's just like a thread  
That keeps unraveling but then  
It ties us back together in the end  
  
[Chorus:]  
In your eyes I can see my dream's reflections  
In your eyes I found the answers to my questions  
In your eyes I can see the reasons why our love's alive  
In your eyes  
We're drifting safely back to shore  
(And) I think I've fin'lly learned to love you more  
  
And she warns me that life changes  
And that no one really knows  
Whether time would make us strangers  
Or whether time would make us grow  
Even though the winds of time will change  
In a world where nothing stays the same  
Through it all our love will still remain  
  
[Chorus:]  
In your eyes I can see my dream's reflections  
In your eyes I found the answers to my questions  
In your eyes I can see the reasons why our love's alive  
In your eyes  
We're drifting safely back to shore  
(And) I think I've fin'lly learned to love you more  
  
In your eyes I can see the reasons why our love's alive  
You and I  
We're driftin' safely back to shore  
I think I've fin'lly learned to love you more  
I think I've fin'lly know you  
I fin'lly love you  
I see it all  
In your eyes
