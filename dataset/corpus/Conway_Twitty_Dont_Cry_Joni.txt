Jimmy please say you'll wait for me  
I'll grow up someday you'll see  
Savin' all my kisses just for you  
Signed with love forever true  
  
Joni was the girl who lived next door  
I've known her I guess 10 years or more  
Joni wrote me a note one day  
And this is what she had to say  
  
Jimmy please say you'll wait for me  
I'll grow up someday you'll see  
Savin' all my kisses just for you  
Signed with love forever true  
  
Slowly I read her note once more  
Then I went over to the house next door  
Her teardrops fell like rain that day  
When I told Joni what I had to say  
  
Joni, Joni, please don't cry  
You'll forget me by and by  
You're just fifteen I'm twenty two  
Joni I just can't wait for you  
  
Soon I left our little home town  
Got me a job and tried to settle down  
But her words kept haunting my memory  
The words that Joni said to me  
  
Jimmy please say you'll wait for me  
I'll grow up someday you'll see  
Savin' all my kisses just for you  
Signed with love forever true  
  
I packed my clothes and I caught a plane  
I had to see Joni, I had to explain  
How my heart was filled with her memory  
And ask my Joni if she'd marry me  
  
I ran all the way to the house next door  
But things weren't like they were before  
My teardrops fell like rain that day  
When I heard what Joni had to say  
  
Jimmy Jimmy please don't cry  
You'll forget me by and by  
It's been five years since you've been gone  
Jimmy I married your best friend John.
