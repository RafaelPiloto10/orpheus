[Fabolous]  
Shawty you autumn time cool  
But they don't see your beauty f-ck all them blind fools  
Body so mean that it's border line cruel  
Work 8 to 3, then from 4 to 9 school  
Dominican girl who knows more than mongul  
She say lets stay in the room and order Dom Cruz  
It sounds like a plan  
'Cause girl once I got you by your limbs  
That guy who spot you at the gym can't put it down like I can  
I wanna take you places further than where your feet walk  
Why scream when your voice is better for sweet talk  
A little accent, cute ass lisp  
First a toast is said then a flute glass kiss  
I like it when you whip yo hair, but that's Willow fault  
I speak body language, f-ck pillow talk  
We can wake up 'round noon on a saturday  
And make a f-ckin movie, now that's a matinee  
But on the weekdays I wanna be yo' wake up call  
Kiss yo' face before you put that make up all over it  
You go from gettin' ready at the bathroom sink to gettin' bent over it  
Then it's over with  
Now you rushin' to work, ipod touchin' yo purse  
Ima let you go but not without touchin' it first  
When you think 'bout it later you blush and you smirk  
Your co-workers thinkin' you got a crush on the clerk  
You always talk about yo boss, about how much of a jerk he is  
But tell me baby does he touch you and flirt?  
'Cause that's how such and such get hurt  
And lame ass n-ggas start bringin' crutches to work  
I know you got it girl, I trust in your work  
Ladies is pimps too, go 'head brush off the dirt  
I be here when you get off with dutches and purp  
I want you after dinner, your such a dessert  
The night is lookin' sweet the only thing I'm tryna bite is yo physique  
And in most cases with you  
Only thing I wanna fight is gettin sleep 'cause I eat and go to sleep  
You know I is in the sheets, niceeeee  
Don't touch it, let my eyes do the undressin'  
Play Usher and take ya back to confessions  
I wanna crush ya' nevermind the tongue wrestlin'  
Wont rush ya, one question  
  
[Hook:]  
Can I Hit it in the mornin'  
Can I Hit it in the mornin'  
Can I Hit it in the mornin'  
Sun risin' while you yawnin'  
Shawty, can I Hit it in the mornin'  
Shawty, can I Hit it in the mornin'  
Shawty, can I Hit it in the mornin'  
Shawty sun risin' while you yawnin'a
