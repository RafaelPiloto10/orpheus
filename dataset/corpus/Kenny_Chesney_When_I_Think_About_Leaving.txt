You know some times me and my lady have these crazy fights and when we do it
makes me wonder  
Are we're ever gonna get it right  
  
When I think about leaving I think about me  
What my life would be like if I were back to being free  
Go where I wanna go, do what I wanna do, wouldn't have a soul I had to answer
to  
When I think about leaving I think about me  
  
You know I got a friend him and his wife just couldn't see eye to eye he had
all he could  
Stand one day and just packed up and said good-bye  
  
When I think about leaving I think about him  
That little apartment cross town he's living in  
Got an old Corvette, got a new girlfriend, but only sees his kids every other
weekend  
When I think about leaving oh I think about him  
  
I never will forget her face or the day she told me about her dad, how he
walked out on her  
And her mom when she was just a kid  
  
When I think about leaving oh I think about her  
Only five years old and her heart filled up with hurt  
With her little arms wrapped around his neck saying daddy where you going, are
you coming  
Back  
When I think about leaving I think about her  
  
You know the truth is, most of the time things were really great and I know we
got something  
Special  
When I think about leaving I think about us  
How we build this love we share on faith and trust, honest way we talk, tender
way we touch,  
All those nights we spent making love,  
When I think about leaving oh I think about us  
  
When I think about leaving I think again  
Even though that thought crosses my mind every now and then  
In my heart I know I would never leave, there's nowhere else on earth I would
rather be  
When I think about leaving I think again  
  
When I think about leaving  
When I think about leaving  
When I think about leaving: I think again
