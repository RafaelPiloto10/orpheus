You are my dream maker  
Taking me places I've never been  
Making me feel so alive again  
Tell me that all of this will never end.  
  
You are my dream maker  
Chasing away all of my blues  
With these dreams of me and you  
Dream maker, make my dreams come true.  
  
Dreams, beautiful dreams  
Dreaming of two  
I used to never have these kind of dreams till you  
You came along  
And painted my nights, with all your love.  
  
You are my dream maker  
Taking me places I've never been  
Making me feel so alive again  
Tell me that all of this will never end.  
  
You are my dream maker  
Chasing away all of my blues  
With these dreams of me and you  
Dream maker, make my dreams come true.  
  
Nights, long, lonely nights  
Wondering when  
All my loneliness was ever gonna end  
Then I saw you  
Just one look, that's all it took.  
  
You are my dream maker  
Taking me places I've never been  
Making me feel so alive again  
Tell me that all of this will never end.  
  
You are my dream maker  
Chasing away all of my blues  
With these dreams of me and you  
Dream maker, make my dreams come true.  
  
You are my dream maker  
Taking me places I've never been  
Making me feel so alive again  
Tell me that all of this will never end...
