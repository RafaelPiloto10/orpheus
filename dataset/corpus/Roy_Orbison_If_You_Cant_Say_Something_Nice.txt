Don't talk about her, she does the best she can  
Don't talk about her, Don't talk about her  
She's just lost her man  
She's lonely, just try and understand.  
  
And if you can't say something nice  
Don't say anything at all  
Don't you know that she's had a bad, bad fall  
And if you can't say something nice  
Don't say anything at all.  
  
Don't talk about her, because she feels that way  
Don't talk about her, don't talk about her  
She don't feel so good today  
She's crying, because her baby walked away.  
  
And if you can't say something nice  
Don't say anything at all  
Don't you know that she's had a bad, bad fall  
And if you can't say something nice  
Don't say anything at all.
