Carbon monoxide  
Making me choke  
No A.C.  
And the radio's broke  
Cars backed up  
Far as you can see  
Seems like I've been waiting here for all eternity  
Oh, and just in case you're wondering  
I'll tell you where I am  
I'm right here (right here) right here (right here)  
Stuck right here in the middle of this...  
  
Traffic jam  
I haven't moved one inch from this here spot  
Traffic jam  
The freeway's one big parking lot  
Traffic jam  
My radiator's boiling hot  
And I'm stuck right here in the middle (right here in the middle)  
Right here in the middle of a traffic jam  
  
Trapped inside  
My automobile  
Cobweb's gowin'  
On the steerin' wheel  
Now, I'm no genius  
But one thing I know  
I shouldn't have had that bag of bran muffins  
An hour and a half ago  
Yeah, and if you need to find me  
I'll tell you where I am  
I'm right here (right here) right here (right here)  
Stuck smack dab in the middle of this...  
  
Traffic jam  
I haven't moved one inch from this here spot  
Traffic jam  
The freeway's one big parking lot  
Traffic jam  
Well, I thought we were movin' but I guess we're not  
'Cause I'm stuck right here in the middle (right here in the middle)  
Right here in the middle of a traffic jam  
  
Stuck in the middle of a traffic jam  
yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Bumper to bumper to bumper to bumper to  
Bumper to bumper to bumper to bumper to  
Bumper to bumper to bumper to bumper...  
Yay-hey!  
  
There's a yuppie on a cellular phone  
I'm gonna puke if I here any more  
There's a motorcycle zoomin' by me  
Watch what happens when I open my door  
Now we're all goin' nowhere fast  
Well, I guess that's perfectly clear  
I left home five hours ago  
And I can still see my house from here  
So if anybody's tryin' to find me  
Well, I'll tell you where I am  
Right here (right here) right here (right here)  
Stuck right here in the middle of this...  
  
Traffic jam  
I haven't moved one inch from this here spot  
Traffic jam  
The freeway's one big parking lot  
Traffic jam  
Now my back teeth are floatin' and my nerves are shot  
And I'm stuck right here in the middle (right here in the middle)  
Stuck right here in the middle of a traffic jam  
Traffic Jam... traffic jam... traffic jam... woo!
