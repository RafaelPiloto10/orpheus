When I lost my baby  
I almost lost my mind  
When I lost my baby  
I almost lost my mind  
My heads been in a spin  
Since she's left me behind.  
  
I went to see the gypsy  
To have my fortune read  
I went to see the gypsy  
To have my fortune read  
I hung my head in sorrow  
When she said what she said.  
  
Well, I can tell you, people  
The news was not so good  
I can tell you, people  
The news was not so good  
This time "Your baby's left you"  
And but "This time she's gone for good".  
  
She said, This time "Your baby's left you"  
And but "This time she's gone for good."...
