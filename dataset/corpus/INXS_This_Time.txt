I will believe you  
If you say it's true  
Girl you know I need you  
More than any word spoken  
I've seen you before  
Turn and walk away  
You say you won't come back  
It's a game anyway  
  
We are hoping, yes and we're praying  
  
This time will be the last time  
That we will fight like this  
This time will be the last time  
That we will fight like this...hey!  
  
We are always wanting  
Things we cannot find  
You know that we are always wasting time  
  
We are hoping, yes and we're praying  
  
This time will be the last time  
That we will fight like this  
This time will be the last time  
That we will fight like this  
  
You know I can forget  
We have fought before  
I've seen inside your heart  
And I know it's breaking  
  
We are hoping, yeah and we're praying  
  
Maybe this time will be the last time  
That we will fight like this  
This time will be the last time  
That we will fight like this  
This time will be the last time
