A Child is born in Bethlehem  
In Bethlehem  
And gladness fills Jerusalem  
Allelujah, allelujah.  
  
A lowly manger shelters Him  
This Holy Boy  
God's angels sing above with joy  
Allelujah, allelujah!  
  
We now give thanks eternally  
Eternaly  
To God, the Holy Trinity  
Allelujah, allelujah!  
  
The work which His goodness began  
The arm of His strength will complete  
His promise is Yea and Amen  
And never was forfeited yet.  
  
Things future, nor things that are now  
Not all things below or above  
Can make Him His purpose forego  
Or sever my soul from His love.  
  
My name from the palms of His hands  
Eternity will not erase  
Imprest on His heart, it remains  
In marks of indelible grace.  
  
Yes! I to the end shall endure  
As sure as the earnest is giv'n  
More happy, but not more secure  
When all earthly ties have been riv'n...
