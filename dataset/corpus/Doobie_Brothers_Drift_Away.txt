Day after day I'm more confused  
When I look for the light in the pouring rain  
I know that's a game that I hate to lose  
And I'm feeling the strength  
Ain't it a shame  
[Chorus:]  
Give me the Beat Boys to free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock 'n roll and drift away  
Oh.. Give me the Beat Boys to free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock 'n roll and drift away  
Beginning to think that I'm wasting time  
I don't understand the things I do  
The world outside looks so un-kind  
I'm countin' on you  
To carry me through... Oh...  
Give me the Beat Boys to free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock 'n roll and drift away  
Yeah!.. Give me the Beat Boys to free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock 'n roll and drift away  
When my mind is free  
You know a melody can move me  
When I'm feeling blue  
The guitar is coming through to soothe me...  
Thanks for the joy that your giving me  
I want you to know I believe in your song  
Rythem and Rhyme and Harmony  
You've helped me along  
Making me strong.... Oh!...  
(Acapalla)  
Give me the Beat Boys to free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock 'n roll and drift away  
Give me the Beat Boys to free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock 'n roll and drift away  
Oh.... Give me the Beat Boys to free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock 'n roll and drift away  
Oh... Give me the Beat Boys to free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock 'n roll and drift away  
Now, now, now, wont ya  
Wont ya take me, oh... Take me
