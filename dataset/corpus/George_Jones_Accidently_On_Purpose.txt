In the paper I saw you this morning you were lovely dressed in your wedding
gown  
  
And it said you would marry a stranger to me  
  
That had drifted into our old hometown  
  
Accidentaly you've met him one evening and you say it was love at first sight  
  
Accidentaly on purpose you've married accidentaly on purpose for spite  
  
For you say you're sorry I'm painting the town  
  
That I was just a fool with a heart of a clown  
  
Accidentaly you were mistaken that night accidentaly on purpose for spite  
  
Yes you say you're sorry...
