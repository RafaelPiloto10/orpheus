I can make  
Any man do whatever it takes  
Yet I hesitate  
Sit 'em down wine and dine him  
There's more to love then you're thinkin' of  
If I can wait  
Then why don't you my, my, my, my love  
  
[Chorus:]  
There's more to love than making love  
So why don't you just hold on  
There's a time for every thing  
So why don't you just hold on  
Hold on to love [Repeat: x3]  
  
It's not too late  
To slow it down, settle down, and appreciate  
All the love  
I'm showing you and giving you in other ways  
Soon enough my heart will say I do to you  
To love always  
I'll give myself to you that day  
Oh my baby, oh yeah  
I don't want to be another one  
So you can say that you had your way  
I'll show you I'm worth the wait  
Just hold on to everyday  
And we will know how far to go in time  
  
[Chorus]  
There's more to love than making love  
So why don't you just hold on  
There's a time for every thing  
So why don't you just hold on  
Hold on to love [Repeat: x3]
