The actors and jesters are here  
The stage is in darkness and clear  
For raising the curtain  
And no-ones quite certain whose play it is  
How long ago, how long  
If only we had listened then.  
If wed known just how right we were going to be.  
For we dreamed a lot  
And we schemed a lot  
And we tried to sing of love before the stage fell apart.  
  
If everyone was listening you know  
There'd be a chance that we could save the show  
Who'll be the last clown  
To bring the house down?  
Oh no, please no, don't let the curtain fall  
  
Well, what is your costume today?  
Who are the props in your play?  
You're acting a part which you thought from the start  
Was an honest one.  
Well how do you plead?  
An actor indeed!  
Go re-learn your lines,  
You don't know what you've done  
The finales begun.  
  
If everyone was listening you know  
There'd be a chance that we could save the show,  
Who'll be the last clown  
To bring the house down?  
Oh no, please no, don't let the curtain fall.
