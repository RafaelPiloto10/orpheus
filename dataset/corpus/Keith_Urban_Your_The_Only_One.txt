I know it's gonna take some time  
For you to trust this love of mine  
I know he broke your heart in two  
You've been betrayed and ... your afraid  
That I will do the same to you  
  
But you'll be safe here in my arms ... forever and a day  
Though you don't believe me now ... I'll never walk away  
You ... You know that I'll be there ... when tomorrow comes  
  
( Your the only one )  
I know you've heard this all before  
( Your the only one )  
Your the one that I adore  
( Your the only one )  
You make me shine just like the sun  
( Your the only one )  
You bring this heart of mine undone  
( Your the only one )  
  
For evry Lie you've ever heard  
You can believe my every word... yes you can  
Whatever heaven holds in store  
Through good and bad ... I'll be your man  
Stand beside you through it all  
  
But you'll be safe here in my arms ... forever and a day  
Though you don't believe me now ... I'll never walk away  
And you ... you know that I'll be there ... when tomorrow comes  
  
( Your the only one )  
I know you've heard this all before  
( Your the only one )  
Your the one that I adore  
( Your the only one )  
You make me shine just like the sun  
( Your the only one )  
You bring this heart of mine undone  
( Your the only one )  
  
I know you've heard this all before  
( Your the only one )  
But your the one that I adore  
( Your the only one )  
You make me shine just like the sun  
( Your the only one )  
You bring this heart of mine undone  
( Your the only one )  
  
( Your the only one )  
  
Make me shine just like the sun ... yes you do  
  
( Your the only one )
