In a line of fire I stand and wait for you, I can't hold out for too long  
Searchin' every part of me for a sign, I'm in the middle of a storm  
I keep hopin', keep on dreamin', somehow you'll get through to me  
  
So I reach across the silence, in the air, I keep hopin' for a sound  
Just a word or two is all I need, how can I bring you back around  
Can you hear me, can I touch you, show me the way to your heart  
  
Send a message, send me a message tonight  
Send a message, in my dreams you are never out of sight  
Send a message, let me stand in your light, just send me a message  
  
In my dark and lonely night I look for you, won't you save me from myself  
When my senses melt away you will be here and I won't need nobody else  
I can't hold back, I won't fight it, roll back this stone from my heart  
  
Send a message, send me a message tonight  
Send a message, in my dreams you are never out of sight  
Send a message, let me stand in your light, just send me a message  
  
Everything you are (Everything you are)  
Means everything to me (Means everything to me)  
I will wait for you (I will wait)  
Time is all we need (Is all)  
  
I keep hopin', keep on dreamin', somehow you'll get through to me  
  
Send a message, send me a message tonight  
Send a message, in my dreams you are never out of sight  
Send a message, let me stand in your light, just send me a message  
  
(Send a, send a, send a, send a, send a, send a) I'm ready, I am ready  
Send a, send a  
Send me a, me a  
Send a, send a
