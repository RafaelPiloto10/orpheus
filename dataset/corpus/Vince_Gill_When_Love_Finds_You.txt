Love sure is something no one can explain  
It can bring you such joy, it can bring you pain  
And with every emotion, love puts us through  
There's nothing you can say, when love finds you  
  
Love is the power that makes your heart beat  
It can make you move mountains, make you drop to your knees  
When it finally hits you, you won't know what to do  
There's nothin' you can say, when love finds you  
  
[Chorus]  
Give it all you can give it, when your love comes around  
If you put your heart in it, then it won't let you down  
You'll find out it's true, baby, someday when love finds you  
  
And when you least expect it, it will finally come true  
There's nothing you can say when love finds you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You'll find out it's true, baby, someday when love finds you
