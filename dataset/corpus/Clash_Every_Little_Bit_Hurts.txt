Every little bit hurts  
Every little bit hurts  
Every night I cry  
Every night I die  
Every night I wonder why  
You treat me cold  
Yet you won't let me go  
Every little hurt does  
Every little hurt does  
To you I am a toy  
And you're the girl  
Who has the say  
Why I should play  
Yeah you hurt me  
Desert me I just can't take  
The loneliness you give me  
I just can't go  
Another night this way  
Come back to me  
Darlin' you'll see  
I can give you all the things  
You wanted me for  
If you will stay with me  
Every little bit hurts  
Every little bit hurts  
Every night I cry  
Every night I die  
Every night I wonder why  
You treat me cold  
Yet you won't let me go  
Come back to me  
Darlin' you'll see  
I can give you all the things  
That you wanted me for  
If you will stay with me  
Every little bit hurts  
Every little bit hurts  
Every little bit hurts
