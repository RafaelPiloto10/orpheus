Did you see our brother  
He was here the other day  
But he only came to say that he was leaving  
Did you see his lady  
She was looking where he'd gone  
But she wasn't letting on  
That she was grieving  
  
She's bound to go  
Perhaps she'll find him waiting  
For his boat in some city far away  
She's bound to go  
  
Lately I remember  
Afternoons of smoke and wine  
There was nothing we could find  
But peace and pleasure  
And with a smile he told me  
That he wanted just to be on his way  
Across the sea no man can measure  
  
He won't be back,  
And the sun may find him sleeping  
In the dust of some ruin far away  
He won't be back  
  
Early today as I watched while  
The skyline was shaking  
I heard a rumbling  
Early today the mechanical city was waking  
And I ran out stumbling, mumbling  
Out through the laughter  
Of children and dogs  
  
Did you see our brother  
He was here the other day  
But he only came to say that  
He can't breathe here  
Did you see his lady  
She was reaching for his hand  
Just as if to tell her man  
That she can't either  
  
They're bound to go  
And the sun may find me running after them,  
Seeing something far away  
We won't be back  
  
...COUNTER SONG AT THE END OF "FROM SILVER LAKE"  
.....Someone who had been away  
.....Suddenly came back today  
.....And I allowed him home today into my mind  
.....For a moment face to face  
.....Evil packed upon the place  
.....Long ago he meant to stay out there this time  
.....Oh, what do you know  
.....The love that I've been feeling  
.....The past is healing so slow  
.....By tomorrow, gone from sorrow.
