Let's have a hand for that young cowboy and wish him better luck next time  
I hope we'll see him up in Fargo or somewhere farther down the line  
This time he sure drew a bad one one that nobody could ride  
By the way he pulled his hat on you know he'd be there for the fight  
And it's the classic contradiction the unavoidable affliction  
And it don't take much to predict son the way it always goes  
'Cause one day she'll say she loves you and the next she'll be tired of you  
And push'll always come to shove you on that midnight rodeo  
  
He almost made it to the buzzer somehow he gave up in the end  
He put one hand around the other and let that pick up man on in  
It was his last chance to ride it now he'll have to move along  
But he knows back in his mind that he won't be away for long  
And it's the classic contradiction...  
So let's have a hand for that young cowboy and wish him better luck next time  
I hope we'll see him up in Fargo or somewhere farther down the line
