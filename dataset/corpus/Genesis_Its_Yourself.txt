Stepping out the back way  
Hoping nobody sees  
Feeling can be easy  
Think how I feel  
What will (can) you say?  
What will you do?  
Why can't you see?  
It's yourself I love  
(Don't you know I'm not asking  
You must have made up your mind  
Is it worth the pain you're causing  
To those you're leaving behind  
What will you say?  
What will you do?  
Why can't you see?  
It's yourself I love)  
Don't you know I'd like some answers  
You could give me a call  
I hardly know the reason  
And I really feel no good at all  
Where will you go?  
Where will you be?  
Where can I try?  
It's yourself I love
