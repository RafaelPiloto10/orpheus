Hey mom and dad, I don't know where to start.  
I hate to break the news, but I got a broken heart.  
That sweet southern belle, that I met in Tennessee  
Got a hickey on her neck and it ain't from me.  
Seems there's someone special she's been meeting at the gym,  
but the crazy thing about it, is that someone's not a him.  
  
[Chorus]  
My girlfriend's got a girlfriend now.  
It was cool for a minute, now its bringing me down.  
People talkin' bout it all over this town.  
My girlfriend's got a girlfriend now.  
  
All my friends say, she's just going through a phase  
and I believed her when she said I just need a little space  
But then I found pictures on her cellular phone,  
of them doing things, when I wasn't home  
It hit me like a brick, I guess I should have seen the signs  
This was more than just a friend and a bottle of wine.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah mom and dad, really nothing left to say  
I'll be sure to keep you posted if she swing it back this way  
I guess I'm not as sad as you think I might be  
The part that makes me mad is that they didn't invite me.  
  
[Chorus]  
My girlfriend's got a girlfriend now.  
My girlfriend's got a girlfriend now.
