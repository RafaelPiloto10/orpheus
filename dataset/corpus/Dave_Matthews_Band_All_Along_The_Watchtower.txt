There must be some way out of here  
Said the joker to the thief  
There's too much confusion  
I can't get no relief  
  
Business men they  
Drink my wine  
There plowmen dig my earth  
None of them along the line  
Know what any of it's worth  
  
No reason to get excited  
The thief he kindly spoke  
There are many among us  
Who feel that life is but a joke  
  
But you and I we've been through all that, yes we have  
And this is not our fate  
So let us not talk falsely now  
The hour is getting late  
  
And all along the watchtower  
Princes kept the view  
While all the women all the women all the women came and went  
Barefoot servants too  
Outside in the cold distance  
A wild cat did growl, la la la  
Two riders, two riders approaching  
The wind began to howl  
  
The thief he take  
My money take  
The thief he take  
My money take  
  
Am I insane  
Auf wiedersehen  
Am I insane  
The thief is safe  
  
No reason to get excited
