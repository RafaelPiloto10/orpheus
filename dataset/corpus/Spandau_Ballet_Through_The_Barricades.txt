Mother doesn't know where love has gone  
She says it must be youth  
That keeps us feeeling strong  
See it in her face, that's turned to ice  
And when she smiles she shows  
The lines of sacrifice  
And now I know what they're saying  
When the sun begins to fade  
And we made our love on wasteland  
And through the barricades  
Father made my history  
He fought for what he thought  
Would set us somehow free  
He tought me what to say in school  
I learned off by heart  
But now that's torn in two  
And now I know what they're saying  
In the music of the parade  
We made our love on wasteland  
And through the barricades  
Born on different sides of life  
We feel the same  
And feel all of this strife  
So come to me when I'm asleep  
We'll cross the line  
And dance upon the street  
And now I know what they're saying  
When the drums begin to fade  
We made our love on wasteland  
And through the barricades  
Oh, turn around and I'll be there  
There's a scar through my heart  
But I'll bare it again  
I thought we were the human race  
But we were just another border-line-case  
And the stars reach down and tell us  
That there's always one escape  
I don't know where love has gone  
And in this trouble land  
Desperation keep us strong  
Fridays child is full of soul  
With nothing left to lose  
There's everything to go  
And now I know what they're are saying  
It's a terrible beauty we've made  
So we make our love on wasteland  
And through the barricades  
Now I know what they're are saying  
As hearts go to their graves  
We made our love on wasteland  
And through the barricades.
