You think you've heard this before  
I'll try to say it differently  
As long as it come naturally to me  
It's been making me sad  
'Cause I can't find a better way  
To speak the words I wanna say to you  
  
Know how I love you  
And know how I need you  
  
And I want you to know  
Won't let you down  
No, I can't let go  
And I want you to see  
Everyday I wear my heart on my sleeve  
On my sleeve  
  
It's been driving me mad  
Consistent tones and constant drones  
Keep pulling me back inside my head  
Nothing matter at all  
The world will keep on spinning round  
All these feeling keep on pouring out  
  
Oh, how I love you  
Oh, how I need you  
  
And I want you to know  
Won't let you down  
No, I can't let go  
And I want you to see  
Everyday I wear my heart on my sleeve  
  
I try to write the words down  
Before they're lost and won't come out  
Oh, please, help me sing my song  
  
And I want you to know  
Won't let you down  
No, I can't let go  
And I want you to see  
Everyday I wear my heart on my sleeve  
Heart on my sleeve  
Heart on my sleeve  
Heart on my sleeve  
  
No, I can't let you go  
Can't let you go  
  
Oh, I want you to know  
Won't let you down  
Everyday, yeah, I can't let go  
I wear my heart on my sleeve
