No man ever sounded so lonesome  
No man ever made you feel such pain  
Lord, it must have been a real mean bottle  
That made you sing that way  
The stories you told about prison  
'Bout a young man gone astray  
Lord, it must have been a real mean bottle  
That made you write the songs that way  
A real mean bottle poured straight from the devil  
It's a miracle you're standin' here today  
A real mean bottle made you such a rebel  
It must have been a real mean bottle made you sing that way  
You spent most all your life with strangers  
With a ramblin' fever in your veins  
Hag, it must have been a real mean bottle  
That made you write the songs that way, oh, yeah  
A real mean bottle poured straight from the devil  
It's a miracle we're standin' here today  
A real mean bottle made you such a rebel  
It must have been a real mean bottle made you sing that way  
Must have been a real mean bottle made you sing that way  
It must have been a real mean bottle made you sing that way
