JUST ONCE IN MY LIFE  
IF I COULD FIND SOMEONE, IF ONCE  
THE FEELING WAS RIGHT  
I'D NEVER LET HER GO  
I'D ALWAYS BE THERE  
IF I COULD HAVE MY CHANCE TO BE  
THE ONLY ONE  
IT JUST ISN'T FAIR  
  
CHORUS  
  
IF I COULD HOLD ON TO LOVE  
I'D NEVER LET IT GO  
I'D KEEP IT RIGHT NEXT TO MY HEART  
  
IF I COULD HOLD HER TONIGHT  
SHE'D NEVER LEAVE MY SIDE  
IF I COULD ONLY HOLD ON TO LOVE  
  
I'M SEARCHING MY DREAMS  
I'M TRYING TO RECOGNIZE THAT FACE,  
OH,  
WHO CAN IT BE?  
SHE'S CALLING OUT TO ME AND NOW  
I'M  
  
RUNNING TO HER  
BUT EVERYTIME I GET THIS CLOSE  
SHE VANISHES  
INTO THE NIGHT  
  
REPEAT CHORUS  
  
IS IT EVER COME TO PASS  
THAT I FIND A LOVE THAT LASTS  
OR IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK?  
  
IF I COULD HOLD HER TONIGHT  
SHE'D NEVER LEAVE MY SIDE  
IF I COULD ONLY HOLD ON TO LOVE  
IF I COULD ONLY HOLD ON TO LOVE
