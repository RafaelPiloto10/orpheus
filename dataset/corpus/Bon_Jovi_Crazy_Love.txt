The city sounds like a symphony  
A cabbie screams obscenities  
The horns are honking jazz in the night  
The street is lit like a Christmas tree  
This place its my amphetamine  
She junks me but its alright  
In her summer dress she parts the sea  
Her hair wrapped up in rosary beads  
Everybody else is gone but her and me  
  
Here she comes  
Its crazy love  
Here it comes again,  
That crazy thing called love  
Here she comes  
Its crazy love  
Here it comes again  
  
Sittin' on my stoop I lit one up  
Hit the ashes in my coffee cup  
And watch the world passin' me by  
Throw a coat of paint on this rusty heart  
Ain't it funny how life imitates art?  
Saint Valentine he's got bloody knees tonight  
  
But when she's walkin' down the street  
The sidewalks there to kiss her feet  
  
Here she comes  
Its crazy love  
Here it comes again,  
That crazy thing called love  
Here she comes  
Its crazy love  
Here it comes again  
  
She needs me, pleads me  
And wraps me in her loving charm  
She'll tease me, squeeze me  
But I'm the man when I'm in her arms  
  
Now the angels sing a melody  
They wrote for her explicitly  
And no one hears but her and me  
  
Now wait a minute  
Wait, I can't believe my eyes  
Who's that comin' round the corner?  
Oh she's lookin' fine ain't she?  
Get out the way!  
No, no, no, no, no get out the way!  
Oh look at those high heel sneakers  
  
Here she comes  
Its crazy love  
Here it comes again,  
That crazy thing called love  
Here it comes  
That crazy love  
Here she comes again  
That crazy thing called love  
Here she comes  
Its crazy love  
Here it comes again  
That crazy thing called love  
Here it comes  
That crazy love  
Here she comes again  
That crazy thing called love  
Here she comes
