You're so square--baby  
You're so square. ..  
Oh, you don't like greasy diners  
You don't like sleazy bands  
You just want to go  
To a movie show  
And sit there holding hands  
You're so square  
Baby I don't care  
  
You don't like going to parties  
To toot and talk all night long  
You just want to park  
Where it's nice and dark  
And kiss me, sweet and strong  
You're so square  
Baby I don't care  
  
You don't know any dance steps  
That are new  
But nobody else can love me  
Like you do  
  
I don't know why my heart flips  
I only know it does  
I wonder why  
I love you baby  
I guess it's just because  
You're so square  
Darlin' I don't care  
  
Oh, I don't know why my heart flips  
I only know it does  
I wonder why  
I love you baby  
I guess it's just because  
You're so square  
I don't care  
  
You're so square
