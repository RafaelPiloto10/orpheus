Old 61's my number on the hi-way  
I'm turnin' up the V's on the airways  
I'm tuned into some bad-ass transactions  
It's the only way to get my satisfaction  
  
Yeah antenna head, yeah antenna head  
  
Antenna waves be burnin' up my radio  
Mister DJ say it's the only way to go  
Cranked up all the way my tube is turnin4 red  
Got a pocket full uh cornbread just call it  
Antenna head  
  
Yeah antenna head  
Yeah antenna head  
Yeah yeah yeah antenna head  
Yeah antenna head  
  
Yeah antenna head  
Yeah antenna head  
Yeah yeah yeah antenna head  
Yeah antenna head
