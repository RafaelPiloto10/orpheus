I think I had one too many  
I know I had one too many  
I think I had one too many is all  
  
I'm trying hard  
But I can't remember  
How I got home  
Don't recall any streets I roamed  
Can't remember at all  
  
I think I had one too many  
It must have been the one too many  
I think I had one too many is all  
To my disgrace  
All I recall is my daddy's face  
And how I wished  
That I could see home again  
  
I think I had
