Nothing but lying and killing and dying in this dream  
Anything better than what we better believe  
No mention of freedom no glory hallelu  
No mention you freedom I'm coming home for you  
Life was but of a simple dream of doing what was right  
Broken into pieces as day turns into night  
Life was but a simple dream now all I see is red  
Broken into fragments by the thunderhead  
  
Send the word ahead don't want to be alone  
Time to wake the dead I'm coming home  
Send this word ahead now I'm cast in stone  
Feel the thunderhead I'm coming home  
I'm coming home Thunderhead  
I'm coming home Thunderhead  
I'm coming home Thunderhead  
I'm coming  
  
Everyone crying and burning and frying in my dream  
Everyone needs just a little bit more to believe  
Intention no bleeding thinking what I have to do  
Intention more bleeding I'm coming home for you  
Life was just a simple dream of doing what was right  
Broken into pieces when day turned into night  
Life was but a simple dream now all I see is red  
Broken into fragments feel the thunderhead
