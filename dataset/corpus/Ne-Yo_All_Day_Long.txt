So he finally called  
I waited so long and he finally called  
To tell me him and his ex-girlfriend  
They gonna work it out  
  
I went to make a withdrawl  
Make a withdrawl at an ATM  
I sat and watched my card go in  
But it didn't come out  
  
It's one of them days  
Where you just shake your head and smile  
And know that God has a sense of humor  
He's laughin' at me right now  
  
So I'm gonna turn off my tv  
Just let it watch me  
With my head under the sheets  
I spend this whole damn day asleep (whole damn day asleep)  
Said I'm turnin' off my phone  
Tell the world to leave to alone  
Gonna stay right here in bed  
All day long  
  
I said, all day long  
Hey, all day long  
I'm talkin', all day long  
All day long  
  
Yeah  
I'm takin' off these clothes  
So I can throw on a big t-shirt  
The one that he thought he lost (that he thought he lost)  
I had it all along (not giving it back)  
And I ain't taking no calls (nooo)  
Acceptin' no calls (nooo)  
Not even from work (nooo)  
(Nooo) Today I'm my own boss  
And I gave myself the day off  
  
Hey  
Cause it's one of them days  
Where you just shake your head and smile  
I know that God has a sense of humor  
I'm laughin' with him right now (laughin' with him right now)  
  
Cause I turned off my tv  
Just let it watch me  
With my head under the sheets  
I spend this whole damn day asleep (whole damn day asleep)  
Said I'm turnin' off my phone  
Tell the world to leave to alone  
Gonna stay right here in bed (hey)  
All day long  
  
Hey-ey-ey

Honestly that's a-ok with me  
It's rainin' anyway  
There ain't no need to go outside  
I tell you that the only firends I need today  
Is my blanket and my pillowcase with me (hey)  
And I'm alright  
  
Gonna turn off my tv  
Just let it watch me  
With my head under the sheets  
I spend this whole damn day asleep (whole damn day asleep)  
Said I'm turnin' off my phone  
Tell the world to leave to alone  
I'm gonna stay right here in bed  
All day long  
  
I said, all day long  
Hey, all day long
