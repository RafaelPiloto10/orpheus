So you think you're a Romeo  
playing a part in a picture-show  
Take the long way home  
Take the long way home  
  
'Cause you're the joke of the neighborhood  
Why should you care if you're feeling good  
Take the long way home  
Take the long way home  
  
But there are times that you feel you're part of the scenery  
All the greenery is comin' down, boy  
And then your wife seems to think you're part of the  
furniture oh, it's peculiar, she used to be so nice.  
  
When lonely days turn to lonely nights  
You take a trip to the city lights  
And take the long way home  
Take the long way home  
  
You never see what you want to see  
Forever playing to the gallery  
You take the long way home  
Take the long way home  
  
And when you're up on the stage, it's so unbelievable,  
Oh unforgettable, how they adore you,  
But then your wife seems to think you're losing your sanity,  
Oh, calamity, is there no way out?  
  
Does it feel that your life's become a catastrophe?  
Oh, it has to be for you to grow , boy.  
When you look through the years and see what you could  
have been oh, what you might have been,  
If you'd had more time.  
  
So, when the day comes to settle down,  
Who's to blame if you're not around?  
You took the long way home  
You took the long way home...
