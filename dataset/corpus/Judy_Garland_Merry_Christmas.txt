Merry Christmas,  
Have a very, very merry Christmas.  
Dream about your hearts desire,  
Christmas Eve when you retire,  
Santa Claus will stop and I know he'll drop  
Exactly what you wanted from your chimney top.  
So be jolly,  
Have a holiday as gay as holly.  
May the ones you love be near you  
With the laugh of friends to cheer you.  
When the church bells ring,  
Like the angels sing,  
And you hear the joyful hymn they chime,  
Hang a wish from me on your Christmas tree  
[Repeat]  
For a very merry Christmas time.
