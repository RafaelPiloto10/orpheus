There's miles of land in front of us,  
And we're dying with every step we take,  
We're dying with every breath we make,  
And all fall in line.  
  
A stranger's back is all I see,  
He's only a few feet in front of me,  
And all look left and right sometimes,  
But all fall in line.  
  
No one looks up anymore,  
'Cause you might get a raindrop in your eye,  
And heaven forbid, they see you cry,  
As we fall in line.  
  
And about this time of every year,  
The Line will go to the ocean pier,  
And walk right off into the sea,  
Then we fall asleep.  
  
As we near the end of land,  
And our ocean graves are just beyond the sand,  
I ask myself the question, why  
I fall in line.  
  
Then out of the corner of my eye,  
I see a spaceship in the sky,  
And hear a voice inside my head:  
"Follow me instead."[2x]  
  
Follow me.  
  
Then the wages of war will start,  
Inside my head with my counterpart,  
And the emotionless marchers will chant the phrase:  
"This Line 's the only way."  
  
Then I start down the sand,  
My eyes are focused on the end of land,  
But again the voice inside my head  
Says, "Follow me instead."  
  
Follow me instead.  
  
Follow me.  
  
Follow me instead.[4x]  
  
Take me up. Seal the door.  
I don't want to march here anymore.  
I realize that this Line is dead,  
So I'll follow you instead.  
  
So then you put me back in my place,  
So I might start another day,  
And once again, I will be  
In a march to the sea.
