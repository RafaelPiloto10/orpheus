If you could see me now  
The one who said that she'd rather roam  
The one who said she'd rather be alone  
If you could only see me now  
  
If I could hold you now  
Just for a moment if I could make you mine  
Just for a while turn back the hands of time  
If I could only hold you now  
  
I've been too long in the wind  
Too long in the rain  
Taking any comfort that I can  
Looking back and a-longing for the freedom of my chains  
Lying in your loving arms again  
  
If you could hear me now  
Singing somewhere through a lonely night  
Dreaming of the arms that held me tight  
If you could only hear me now  
  
I've been too long in the wind  
Too long in the rain  
Taking any comfort that I can  
Looking back and a-longing for the freedom of my chains  
Lying in your loving arms again  
I want to be lying in your loving arms again
