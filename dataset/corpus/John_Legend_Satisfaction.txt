I wonder, wonder wonder  
Why your eyes they wonder?  
I wonder, wonder wonder  
About the spell that you are under  
Tell me its some hocus pocus  
Made to lose your focus  
I wonder why the cold kiss and you think I wouldn't notice  
  
[Bridge]  
You don't love me like you say you do  
You don't want me the way that I want you  
You don't love me like you say you do (you do) you do  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Can I get me some satisfaction [Repeat: x3]  
That's all I'm asking you, you, of you  
Give me the magic pass, that's all I ask of you  
  
I wonder if it's over, middle of October  
I don't know why in autumn, she keeps giving a cold shoulder  
She knows how much I love her don't know what I could have told her  
I wonder why she makes me think I didn't even know her  
  
[Bridge]  
  
Why don't you give me (give me give me give me give me your love)  
Give me your love (give me give me give me your love  
Is that too much to ask you can I  
Get some satisfaction from you  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus: Repeats]
