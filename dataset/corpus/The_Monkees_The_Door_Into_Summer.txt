With his fool's gold stacked up all around him  
From a killing in the market on the war  
The children left King Midas there, as they found him  
In his counting house where nothing counts but more  
  
[Chorus]  
And he thought he heard the echo of a penny whistle band  
And the laughter from a distant caravan  
And the brightly painted line of circus wagons in the sand  
Fading through the door into summer  
  
Well, it's travel onto "maybe next year" 's places  
As a trade-in for a name upon the door  
And he pays for every year he cannot buy back with his tears  
As he finds out there's been no one keeping score  
  
[Chorus]
