Treated like a refugee  
Never seems to be a place for me  
In my mind there is a scene i see  
My house is burning  
No-one returning  
To a land once free.  
  
Dreaming like a deportee  
Cast away upon the open sea  
No hand of friendship for the likes of me.  
I feel the thunder  
I'm going under  
And i can't get free.  
  
If there is a heaven  
I don't want to hang around this hell.  
I could be an angel  
Let god (slip? )out of heaven back to hell.  
  
And i say  
I wont cry, no more tears  
I wont cry, no more tears  
  
Carry me away from here  
Cut the crying and the see-through tear  
Make emotion dissappear  
My life is changing  
I'm re-arranging  
Everything i feel.
