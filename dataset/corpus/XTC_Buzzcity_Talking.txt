What makes you wander far  
Don't know who you are  
Now if the vibe is right  
I'll go out tonight  
  
Cause it's Buzzcity talking  
It's Buzzcity talking  
Go and find a late night bar  
If I'm not back, leave the door ajar  
It's Buzzcity talking  
Talking to me  
  
We have sickness in our hair  
We have time to spare  
You close another door  
Break another law when it's  
  
Fast, night goes fast  
Oh! Oh! Oh!
