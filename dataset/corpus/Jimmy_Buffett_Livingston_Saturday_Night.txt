You got your Tony Lamas on your jeans pressed tight  
Take a few tokes make you feel alright  
Rocking and a rolling on a Livingston Saturday night  
Pickup's washed and you just got paid  
With any luck you might even get laid  
Cause they're making and they're breaking  
On a Livingston Saturday night  
  
You got to listen to the sound of the hot country band  
Two heels a shuffling on the dance floor sand  
Sing a song play some pong, shoot a little pool  
Hitting on the honeys right out of high school  
Fifteen may get you twenty, that's all right  
Cause they'll be rocking and a rolling on a Livingston Saturday night  
  
Oh listen to the sound of the hot country band  
Two heels a shuffling on the dance floor sand  
Hum a song play some pong, eat a deviled egg  
Temperature is rising better pop another keg  
Fifteen may get you twenty, that's all right  
Cause they'll be rocking and a rolling on a Livingston Saturday night  
  
Yeah I said they'll be rocking and a rolling on a Livingston Saturday night  
One more time they'll be rocking and a rolling on a Livingston Saturday night
