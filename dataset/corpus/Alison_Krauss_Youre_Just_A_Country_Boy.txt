Ain't gonna marry in the fall  
Ain't gonna marry in the spring  
For you're in love  
With a pretty little girl  
Who wears a diamond ring  
  
[Chorus]  
You're just a country boy  
Money - have you none?  
But you've got silver  
In the stars  
Gold in the morning sun  
Gold in the morning sun  
  
Never gonna kiss the ruby red lips  
Of the prettiest girl in town  
Never gonna ask her if she'll marry you  
She'd only turn you down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Never could afford a store-bought ring  
With a sparklin' diamond stone  
All you could afford is a loving heart  
The only one you own  
  
[Chorus]
