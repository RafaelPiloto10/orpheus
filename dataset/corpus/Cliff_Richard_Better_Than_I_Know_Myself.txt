You were there - at the moment I began  
When the child became a man  
Saw my future in the making - saw the path my life was taking  
You saw a million things I'll never understand  
  
You know me better than I know myself  
Better than I know myself  
Time after time you've shown it to be true  
That no one loves me like you  
  
You are here so let it rain or let it shine  
You are with me all the time  
When I'm waking - when I'm sleeping  
In the secret thoughts I'm keeping  
  
You know everything about this heart of mine  
You know me better than I know myself  
Better than I know myself  
Time after time you've shown it to be true  
  
That no one loves me like you  
You'll be there - when the end of time has come  
And I know you'll take me home  
So I thank you for tomorrow  
  
All my joys and all my sorrows  
And I thank you for the greatest thing I've known  
You know me better than I know myself  
Better than I know myself  
  
Time after time you've shown it to be true  
That no one loves me like you
