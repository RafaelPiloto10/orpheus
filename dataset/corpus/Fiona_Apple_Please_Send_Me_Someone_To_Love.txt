Heaven please send to all mankind,  
Understanding and peace and mind.  
But if it is not asking too much,  
Please send me someone to love, someone to love.  
  
Show the world how to get along,  
And peace will enter, when hate is gone.  
But if it's not asking too much,  
Please send me someone to love,  
Please send me someone to love.  
  
I lie awake nights, and ponder a world of trouble  
And my answer is always the same.  
That when this man put an end to this damnable sin.  
Hate will put the world in a flame, what a shame  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Just because i'm, in misery  
I don't beg for no sympathy  
But if it is not asking too much,  
Please send me someone to love,  
Please send me someone to love.
