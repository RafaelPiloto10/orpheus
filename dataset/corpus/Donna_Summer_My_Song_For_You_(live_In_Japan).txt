I've been so many places in my life and time  
I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes  
I've acted out my life in stages  
With ten thousand people watching  
But we're alone and I'm singing my song for all of you  
I know your image of me is what I hope to be  
I treated you unkindly but boy can't you see  
There's noone more important to me  
Baby can't you please see through me  
Cause we're alone now and I'm singing my song for all of you  
I love you in a place we're there's no space or time  
I love you for my life cause you're friends of mine  
And when my life is over  
Remember when we were together  
We were alone and I was singing my song for all of you  
You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing  
You came out in front I was hiding  
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together  
Listen to the melody  
Cause my love's in there hiding  
I love you in a place where there's no space or time  
I love you for my life cause you're friends of mine  
And when my life is over  
Remember when we were together  
We were alone and I was singing my song for all of you  
Thank you people  
Thank you people oh yeah  
And you will help me every step of the way  
Yes you will  
And I will sing my song for all of you.....
