Come back little raven and bite my face  
I've been waiting, endless waiting  
Come back and bite my face  
  
Come back little raven, decend your home  
This is not then, it is not now  
Come back, decend your throne  
  
I think you realize what I've done  
Well, on a corner slept my horrible corpse  
I'm not alive for anyone  
I think you realize what I've done  
  
You gotta come back  
You gotta come back  
You gotta come back  
You gotta come back  
  
Come back little raven, here bite my face  
I've been waiting, endless waiting  
Come back and bite my face  
  
I think you realize what I've done  
We're on the corner, slashed my heart for fun  
I'm not alive for anyone  
I think you realize what I've done  
  
You gotta come back  
You gotta come back  
You gotta come back  
You gotta come back  
  
You gotta come back, come back, well, come back  
Right back to me  
You gotta come back, come back, come on back  
Right back to me  
You gotta come back, come back, come on back  
Right back to me  
You gotta come back, come back, come on back  
Right back to me, yeah
