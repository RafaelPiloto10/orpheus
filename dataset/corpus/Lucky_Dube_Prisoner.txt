Somebody told me about it  
When I was still a little boy  
He said to me, crime does not pay  
He said to me, education is the key, yeah  
As a little boy I thought I know  
What I was doing, yeah man  
But today here I am in jail  
  
I' m a prisoner  
I' m a prisoner  
I' m a prisoner  
  
I looked all around me  
But to see nothing  
but four grey walls staring at me  
the policeman said to me, son  
They won' t build no schools anymore  
All they' ll build will be prison, prison  
All they' ll build will be prison, prison  
All they' ll build will be prison, prison  
'Cause today, yeah  
  
I am a prisoner  
I am a prisoner  
I' m a prisoner  
Dear lord  
  
I asked the policeman and said  
How much must I pay for my freedom?  
He said to me, son  
They won't build no schools anymore  
They won't build no hospitals  
They won't build no hospitals  
All they' ll build will be prison, prison  
All they' ll build will be prison, prison  
All they' ll build will be prison, prison  
All they' ll build will be prison, prison  
  
I am a prisoner  
I am a prisoner  
I' m a prisoner  
Dear lord
