Confess, your kiss still knocks me off my legs.  
The first time I saw you was like a punch right through my chest  
And I will forever, 'cause you'll forever be  
My one true broken heart, pieces inside of me and you  
And you'll forever, my baby be.  
  
You will rest your head, your strength once saving.  
And when you wake you will fly away,  
Holding tight to the legs of all your angels.  
Goodbye my love, into your blue, blue eyes,  
Your blue, blue world, you're my baby blue.  
  
Confess I'm not quite ready to be left.  
Still, I know I gave my level best.  
You give, you give, to this I can attest  
You made me, you made me.  
You and me forever, baby.  
  
You will rest your head, your strength once saving.  
And when you wake you will fly away,  
Holding tight to the legs of all your angels.  
Goodbye my love, into your blue, blue eyes,  
In your blue, blue world, you and me forever.  
  
You will rest your head, your strength once saving.  
And when you wake you will fly away,  
Holding tight to the legs of all your angels.  
Goodbye my love, into your blue, blue eyes,  
In your blue, blue world, you and me forever.
