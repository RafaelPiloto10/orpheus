[Verse 1]  
Now everybody wants to have fame  
But you'll pay the price if you're not playin' it by the game  
'cause this game is made up of a bunch of crazy rules  
And fools get took if they're not playing by the rules  
Now, the Ice is kickin' it, kickin' it kickin' it like a champ  
But don't try to play me like some wet food stamp  
They say that it was a fluke  
'cause I used a fat loop  
But here's the sccop, troop  
The Ice is back to make it hoop  
An' since it's 94, and now I'm back on the scene  
Escapin from the hell of takin' it to the extreme  
It's kind of strange, 'cause people say you've changed..  
But I never changed  
Even though I got Fame  
Yo, I'm still the same... Ugh!  
[Verse 2]  
Fame, I'm still the same person  
I never ever switch, an' even if I'm rich  
But now it's like an itch  
'cause I love the music  
They say I do it for the money  
And it's funny, clockin' all the honeys:  
The ones that used to dis  
Now they want to kiss  
Lookin' at what my troops got  
Now they're getting their boots knocked  
Damn it's a shame - do I love 'em  
No I don't "G"  
A couple of years ago, they didn't want me  
Now I got these so called friends  
It's down with the Ice, 'cause they know I'm makin' ends  
But my real friends have been friends through the fame  
An' since I have fame ain't a damn thing changed  
Yo I'm still the same... Ugh!  
[Verse 3]  
And let me tell you about the pros and the cons  
Fame only lasts if you keep droppin' them bombs  
Now in the public eye - you know I'm havin' to admit it  
You become a target for a whole lot of critics  
Reporters stickin' to ya like white on rice  
Now everywhere I go they want to interview the Ice  
Before every show it's like I'm steadily surrounded  
By all of my fans and the media's houndin'  
This is not a dis 'cause I love all my fans  
But the media doesn't really understand  
They take what ya say, twist it around into lies  
And the next thing ya know  
A bunch of rumors start to fly  
Then they try to make you out to be a straight liar  
And next you'll be the front page of the National Enquirer  
Oh what a price to pay to play this crazy game  
You betta' be prepared if you ever reach fame  
Yo, I'm still the same... Ugh!
