What life is all about  
I  
Isn't it right that we be together  
Just like we've always been  
Isn't it time that we start tomorrow  
With what we have today  
Refrain  
Here we are, we live, we laugh and we cry  
We share the dream someday we may find  
A love that is true that will last for all time  
It seems what life is (just) all about  
Ii  
Isn't it love we need to believe in  
Whenever we're in doubt  
It isn't hard to share what we're feelin  
We just have to try  
Refrain  
Refrain  
Coda  
Life's for you and I
