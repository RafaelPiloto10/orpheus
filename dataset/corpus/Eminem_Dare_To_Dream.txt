You can own this city  
You have everything you need  
All it takes is all you got  
Life don't ask you if you're ready or not  
You can own this city  
Deep inside you hold the key  
While the world is fast asleep  
You can take it all if you just dare to dream  
  
Ever since Tony Montana told me that the world is mine  
I started to think positive  
Left the negative behind  
And while the other stars were fast asleep  
I had to rise and shine  
It's funny how I've got a brand new G shock on my wrist  
But I ain't got time to sit and talk about who slept with the most girls  
And who committed the most crime  
One day I had a dream like Martin  
Back when I had a homemade skinframe and a side parting  
They used to make jokes about me  
Now look who's laughing  
I'm sitting at the top of the game  
Love in my heart  
Jme on my chain  
Money on my head  
So it stays on my brain  
Till it turns me insane  
You can own this city  
You have everything you need  
All it takes is all you got  
Life don't ask you if you're ready or not  
You can own this city  
Deep inside you hold the key  
While the world is fast asleep  
You can take it all if you just dare to dream  
  
But I don't wanna spend my whole life sleeping in bed  
I'm tryna make a dream come to life  
I'll sleep when I'm dead  
Time to get down  
Tie my lace up  
Cos I'm about to chase some paper  
And I can blow a hundred fast  
Like Usain Bolt like when he ran for Jamaica  
Me giving up is against the law  
I work hard  
I play more  
I fell in love with my sold out tour  
Sometimes I think some other artists love the after parties more  
Fell victim to the don beat  
So when I'm all counting paper  
Them man are just counting shit  
  
Yeah  
Yeah  
I was the boy in the corner  
Made a transition into a champion  
My discovery was televised  
I'm talking anthem after anthem  
Against all odds  
I made it look a walk in the park  
Now it's a brand new day  
And I'll be doin it again  
It's time for the main attraction  
  
You can own this city  
You have everything you need  
All it takes is all you got  
Life don't ask you if you're ready or not  
You can own this city  
Deep inside you hold the key  
While the world is fast asleep  
You can take it all if you just dare to dream
