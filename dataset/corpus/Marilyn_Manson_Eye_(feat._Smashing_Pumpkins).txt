I lie, I wait  
I stop, I hesitate  
I am, I breathe  
I meant, I think of me  
  
Is it any wonder I can't sleep?  
All I have is all you gave to me  
Is it any wonder I found peace through you?  
Turn to the gates of heaven, to myself be damned  
Turn away from light  
It's not enough, just a touch  
It's not enough  
  
I taste, I love  
I come, I bleed enough  
I hate, I'm not  
I was, I want too much  
  
Is it any wonder I can't sleep?  
All I have is all you gave to me  
Is it any wonder I found peace through you?  
Turn to the gates of heaven, to myself be damned  
Turn away from light  
It's not enough, just a touch  
It's not enough, just a touch  
It's not enough, just a touch  
It's not enough, just a touch  
It's not enough, just a touch  
It's not enough, just a touch
