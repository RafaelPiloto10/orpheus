Everybody all around the world, gotta tell you what I just heard  
There's gonna be a party all over the world  
  
I got a message on the radio, but where it came from I don't really know  
And I heard these voices calling all over the world  
  
[Chorus:]  
All over the world, everybody got the word  
Everybody everywhere is gonna feel tonight  
  
Everybody walkin' down the street, everybody movin' to the beat  
They're gonna get hot down in the U.S.A.  
New York, Detroit, L.A.  
  
We're gonna take a trip across the sea, everybody come along with me  
We're gonna hit the night down in gay Paris  
  
[Chorus]  
  
London, Hamburg, Paris, Rome, Rio, Hong Kong, Tokyo  
L.A., New York, Amsterdam, Monte Carlo, Shard End and  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everybody all around the world, gotta tell you what I just heard  
Everybody walkin' down the street, I know a place where we all can meet  
Everybody gonna have a good time, everybody will shine till the daylight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All over the world, everybody got the word  
All over the world, everybody got the word  
All over the world, everybody got the word
