You're awake as dawn breaks, another day  
And the gray clouds weep how you feel  
Oh but the way she touch you just brings you back to life  
Oh, don't let them bury your soul in concrete and steel  
So what's so bad about feeling good?  
What's so bad, what's so bad?  
What's so bad about feeling good?  
What's so bad, what's so bad?  
Why hold back when you know you should?  
Break the chains of your life and start  
Feeling good, I said, feeling good  
As we're walking home there's a whispering  
From the city lights to the stars  
And the way she move her body next to me  
In her hair I breathe the air of Venus and Mars  
So what's so bad about feeling good?  
What's so bad, what's so bad?  
Why hold back when you know you should?  
Break the chains of your life and start feeling good  
What's so bad about feeling good?  
Break the chains of your life and start feeling good  
Dream on, dream on  
If you're happy, feeling sad  
Dream on, dream on  
'Bout the things you could've had  
Then tell me what  
Oh, what's so good about feeling bad?  
Oh, tell [Incomprehensible]  
So what's so bad about feeling good?  
What's so bad, what's so bad?  
Why hold back when you know you should?  
Break the chains of your life and start  
What's so bad about feeling good?  
What's so bad, baby, what's so bad?  
(About feeling good)  
What's so bad about feeling good?  
Break the chains of, baby  
(What's so bad?)  
What's so bad about feeling good?
