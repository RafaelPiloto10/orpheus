When you get home, baby  
Write me a few of your lines  
When you get home, little baby  
Write me a few of your lines  
That'll be consolation  
Lord, Honey, oh my worried mind  
  
Left my baby  
Standin' in the back door cryin'  
Well, I left my little baby  
Standing in the back door cryin'  
I never felt so sorry  
Lord, Honey, till he said goodbye  
  
Kokomo me, baby  
Kokomo me right  
Kokomo your mama  
She'll be back tomorrow night  
I'd like to cry in your arms tonight  
Baby, don't you want to go  
Right on to Lemon Light City?  
Sweet home Kokomo  
  
Go on down to the river, baby  
Goin' to sit down on the ground  
Well, I'm goin' down to the river, baby  
Goin' to sit down on the ground  
And let the way of the water  
Lord, Honey, wash my troubles down  
  
Kokomo me, baby  
Kokomo me right  
Kokomo your mama  
She'll be back tomorrow night  
I gotta cry with you, baby  
Baby, don't you want to go  
Right on to Lemon Light City  
Sweet home Kokomo?
