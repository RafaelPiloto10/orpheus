[verse 1]  
Hey Hey My My  
Rock and Roll can never die  
There's more to the picture  
Than meets the eye  
Hey Hey My My  
  
[chorus]  
My my, hey hey  
Rock and roll is here to stay  
It's better to burn out  
Than to fade away  
My my, hey hey  
  
[verse 1]  
Out of the blue and into the black  
They give you this but you pay for that  
And once you're gone, you can't come back  
When you're out of the blue and into the black  
  
[verse 2]  
The king is gone but he's not forgotten  
(Johnny Rotten, Johnny Rotten)  
This is the story of Johnny Rotten  
(Johnny Rotten, Rotten Johnny)  
It's better to burn out than it is to rust  
The king is gone but he's not forgotten  
  
[chorus 2]  
Hey hey, my my  
Rock and roll will never die  
There's more to the picture  
Than meets the eye  
Hey hey, my my  
  
[outro]  
Hey hey, my my
