Most people are not ok, but they're taking their siestas in the sun  
Got some ideas on the way it should be  
But most of 'em just carrying on  
  
Happy colored marbles that are rolling in my head  
I put 'em back in the jacket of the one I love  
Carry that velvet sack full of pretty colored marbles  
And I'll ask you for 'em back, when I'm ready and done  
  
Most people are not ok, and they're slackin' cause the job ain't done  
Fillin' up on the poison nut  
And getting down till the dawn  
  
Happy colored marbles that are rolling in my head  
I put 'em back in the jacket of the one I love  
Carry that velvet sack full of pretty colored marbles  
And I'll ask you for 'em back, when I'm ready and done
