Followed your road till the sky ran out  
Followed your love till love was in doubt  
Followed your love till it never really was at all  
Feeling stupid and hollow  
Now the moon's gonna' follow me home  
  
Waited for you till the snow fell down  
Over my skin like a thin nightgown  
Waited for you but you never came around at all  
Waited for you till they pulled the plug  
Bartender emptied out his big tip jug  
They swept all the floors  
Vacuumed the rugs and went home  
Drank all I could swallow  
Now the moon's gonna' follow me home  
  
[Repeat 2X]  
Time go easy on me tonight  
'Cause I'm one of the lost sheep alright  
Take what you must, take what you must  
Of what I've lost as I have roamed  
And let the moon follow me home  
  
Followed your tears with a washing pail  
I followed your story I followed your tail  
Followed you straight through the  
Doors of your jail cell too  
  
Followed your voice in the darkness soft  
A wind came through and carried it off  
I followed your love till it never really was at all  
Drank all I could swallow  
Followed a road  
'Til the sky ran out
