[Pre-Chorus]  
When I was younger I couldn't wait for the days to pass  
Now I know they'll never last  
And I just want my childhood back  
I just want my childhood dead  
I just wanna take it back  
  
[Chorus][X2]  
Cargo and despair  
All american made  
Let's see who burns the truest in the flame  
  
Huh  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
When I was younger I couldn't wait for the days to pass  
Now I know they'll never last  
And I just want my childhood back  
I just want my childhood dead  
I just wanna take it back  
  
[Chorus]  
Cargo and despair  
All american made  
Let's see who burns the truest in the flame  
  
[Outro]  
Whoo! Fuckin' flames
