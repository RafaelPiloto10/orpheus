Won't you tell me oh my darlin' that you love none one else but me  
For I love you oh my darlin' you are all the world to me  
Oh tell me darlin' that you love me put your little hand in mine  
Take my heart please oh my darlin' say that you will give me time  
Molly there is sweetest and dearest look up darling tell me this  
Do you love me oh darlin' let your answer be a kiss let your answer be a kiss
