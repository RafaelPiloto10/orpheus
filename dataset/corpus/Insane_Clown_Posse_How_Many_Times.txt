How Many Times?  
How many times will I ask myself why, how many times?  
How many times will I ask myself why, how many times will I cry? (2x)  
[Violent J]  
How many times will you honk your horn and say fuck you?  
Now what the fuck does that do?  
Ya feel better now? I didn't let ya pass  
How 'bout I stop my car, and beat your fuckin' ass?  
How many times will my neighbor beat his wife?  
Somewhere in that house there's a butcher knife  
Fuckin' drunk, swingin' his fists about  
Why don't she wait till he sleeps then take him out  
How many times will I sit in a hot car?  
Traffic jam, been sittin' for a fuckin' hour  
Must be an accident, I hope nobody died  
Finally get there, and the crash is on the other side  
The gawkers roll and they creep slow  
Hoping they can see a mangled body show  
Some park, and stand there and watch it all  
With their kids, they point, and fuckin stare (and just look)  
I remember one time I was pulled over  
Handcuffed, the cop was like, show's over  
People watching, hoping that he shoots me  
I just wanted to choke the fucking head  
[Chorus (2x)]  
How many times will I ask myself why, how many times?  
How many times will I ask myself why, how many times will I cry?  
[Violent J]  
How many times will I wait in a line?  
It's three-thirty, I fuckin' got here at nine  
I'm finally up to the front, can't wait another minute  
Why am I here? to pay a fucking parking ticket  
The lady at the counter acts like a fuckin bitch  
No smiles, no help, you're just a piece of shit  
I'm gettin' pissed, calm down, fuck it, forget it  
Back to my car, and there it is, another ticket  
How many times will a crackhead smoke crack  
And ask me for some money 'cause he wants crack  
Give him money, again, he's coming back  
Walk away, and here's another, "Gimme some crack"  
How many time will a kid give a dirty look?  
A little punk-ass bitch tryin to be a crook  
I wrote the book, I was out robbin' liquor stores  
When you were just a nut stain in your momma's drawers  
[Chorus (2x)]  
[Violent J]  
How many times will you steal my car stereo?  
It don't even work, ya feel like a bitch, don't you?  
I vacuum all the fuckin' glass off from my seat  
I sit down, and got a piece stuck in my butt cheek  
How many times did I walk in, and just sit?  
And have to listen, and learn all this bullshit  
Learnin' history and science, fuckin' wait  
Knowin' that, will that put food on my plate?  
Yeah, can I walk into McDonald's, up to the counter  
And tell 'em you can make limestone from gunpowder  
Will they give me a cheeseburger if I know that shit?  
Fuck no, fuck you, and shut your fuckin' lip  
How many times will a judge decide my fate?  
Who is he? A bitch, nothing great  
He takes shits, and fucks his old floppy wife  
Plays with his balls and judges my life!  
[Chorus (5x)]  
"And who the fuck is he?  
He judges my life"
