Mary belongs to the words of a song  
I try to be strong for her  
Try not to be wrong for her  
She will not wait for me anymore, anymore  
Why did I say all those things before I was sure  
  
She is the one  
But I have a purpose  
She is the one  
And I have to fight this  
She is the one  
The villain I can't knock down  
  
I see your face with every punch I take  
Every bone I break  
Its all for you  
And my worst pains are words I cannot say  
Still I will always fight on for you  
  
Mary's alive  
In the bright New York sky  
And the city lights shine for her  
And above them, I cry for her  
  
Every thing's small on the ground below,  
Down below  
What if I fall then  
Where would I go  
Would she know  
  
She is the one  
All that I wanted  
She is the one  
And I will be haunted  
She is the one  
This gift is my curse for now...  
  
I see your face with every punch I take  
And every bone I break  
Its all for you  
And my worst pains are words I cannot say  
Still I will always fight on for you  
  
I see your face with every punch I take  
And my worst pains are words I cannot say  
Still I will always fight on for you  
Fight on for you  
Fight on for you
