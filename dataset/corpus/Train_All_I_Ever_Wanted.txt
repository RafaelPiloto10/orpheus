You were my ticket out of here  
And I was your dream come true  
You gave me everything I ever wanted  
Except for you  
  
I convinced myself that over don't mean over  
And I convinced myself that I could fix it all  
Two dreams collided  
And maybe we got too excited  
For our own good  
  
No more hold on we can make it  
No more holding each other while the words all break it  
Move on you know we'll be stronger in the end  
  
Now I convinced myself that nothing could ever tear me away  
And I convinced myself that we'd look back and laugh at this one day  
Two lives collided  
And maybe we got too excited  
For our own good  
  
No more hold on we can make it  
No more holding our breath while the truth all breaks it  
Move on you know we'll be stronger in the end  
  
Hey wait hey don't you know  
That this is where the whole thing went wrong  
Hey wait hey don't you want  
To hear what I have to say  
Hey wait hey don't you know  
This is where the strong will go on  
  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever wanted  
Was you  
  
No more hold on we can make it  
No more holding each other while the world tries to break us  
Move on you know we'll be stronger in the end  
  
Hey wait hey don't you know  
That this is where the whole thing went wrong  
Hey wait hey don't you want  
To hear what I have to say  
Hey wait hey don't you know  
This is where the strong will go on  
  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever wanted  
Was you
