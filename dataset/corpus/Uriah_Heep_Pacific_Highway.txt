Tryin' to make it back  
To my old home town  
I've been driving since  
The break of dawn  
Got a feeling like a fever  
Burning in my brain  
When I see her  
It'll be all gone  
  
Pacific highway  
Getting nearer now  
And I feel like  
The dream is coming true  
Pacific highway  
Getting closer now  
I don't need directions  
To find my way back to you  
  
Take another turning  
On the old creek road  
Making sure I don't get lost  
I'm hoping to hell  
My taco's reading right  
Get ahead no matter  
What the cost  
  
Tryin' to take it easy  
On the old home stretch  
But city limits come into sight  
I'm getting ready for my Betty  
God how I missed that girl  
We're rock-n-rollin'  
Through the night  
  
I don't need directions  
To find my way back to you  
  
I only got five more miles, yeah  
Only four more miles, yeah  
I only got three miles, two miles  
One mile to go
