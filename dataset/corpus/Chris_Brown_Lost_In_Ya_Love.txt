(Can you hear me now?)  
  
[Verse 1]  
Yeah  
Sweet like honey dew  
I love it when you come around  
It's just me and you, girl  
And you  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Her fragrance turns me on  
Her skin's so soft, oh  
I just wanna hold you  
All night and day  
And we got all the time, girl  
So come a little closer  
Cause I just wanna hold you  
All night and day  
I'm thinking 'bout you all day, all night  
I'm holding on tight  
Baby I just can't let you go  
  
  
[Chorus] (x2)  
I get lost in ya love  
I get wrapped in the words you say  
I get lost in the love we make  
I even fall hard for the games you play  
  
[Verse 2]  
Baby, you're the truth  
I wanna talk about your loving  
I'm so connected to you  
I want it all, I need it all from you girl  
You're my only one and you know that  
I hold it down cause I own that  
Too much history, we go way back  
It's so personal and we got that  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
  
[Chorus] (x2)  
  
[Bridge]  
Run it back, run it back, run it back  
Oh, this my favorite song  
And shout out to the DJ  
Cause he gon' play this record all night long  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
  
[Chorus] (x2)
