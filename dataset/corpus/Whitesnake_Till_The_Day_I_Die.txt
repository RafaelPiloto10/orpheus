When ice cold winds of winter  
Chill me to the bone,  
An' thoughts of summer breezes  
Turn my heart to stone  
That's when I need a hand to guide me,  
When it's more than I can bear  
A shoulder I can cry on,  
Someone to lead me there  
  
An' give me love,  
Give me love,  
Give me love  
Till the day I die,  
Till the day I die  
  
Slowly I awaken  
To the Weavers plan for me,  
To drift upon the waters  
Of my own uncertainty,  
To look for a companion  
Who will share my destiny,  
A guiding hand to understand  
An' walk to road with me  
  
An' give me love,  
Give me love,  
Give me love  
Till the day I die,  
Till the day I die  
  
I want to be the master of my destiny,  
I never want to crawl an' beg for no sympathy,  
When everything I have is yours,  
An' all I ask of you  
  
Is give me love.  
Give me love,  
Give me love  
Till the day I die,  
Till the day I die  
  
I never want to be the first  
To show I'm down,  
But, I'm never gonna wear the frozen smile of a clown  
When everything I have is yours  
And all I ask of you  
  
Is give me love  
Give me love,  
Give me love  
Till the day I die,  
Till the day I die  
  
Give me love,  
Give me love,  
Give me love.  
'Til the day I die  
Give me love,  
Give me love,  
Give me love.  
Till the day I die  
  
Till the day I die
