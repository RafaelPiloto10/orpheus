Dig you better dead, I'd dig you better dead (I'd dig you)  
Dig you better dead, I'd dig you better dead  
Dig you better dead, I'd dig you better dead (I'd dig you)  
Dig you better dead, I'd dig you better dead  
  
A long time ago, you took six months a walkin'  
Talkin' on the other side  
What started as an experiment  
Turned into a heaven-sent message that saved your ass from dyin'  
Somebody said  
  
[Chorus]  
"In life there's always peaks and valleys,  
And if you're lost they won't show you the way"  
That same somebody said "I'd dig you better dead  
But I'd much rather see if your God is what you say, say, say"  
  
And with the awesome power they struck  
1st they offered up the buck  
Right in the middle, right in the middle they stuck (right in the middle)  
A toke or to, what the fuck? (what the fuck?)  
  
One minute you're hot  
Tell the truth and you're not  
That's the noose that they hang on a goose like you  
Somebody said  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Dig you better dead, I'd dig you better dead [Repeat: x4]  
  
And whatever you do, don't make somebody happy  
Don't dress to freaky and make their daughters stare  
Then you'll find out how deep the valley truly be  
If you plan on catchin' the bus, you better have plenty fare  
Somebody said  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Dig you better dead, I'd dig you better dead  
Dig you better dead, I'd dig you better dead  
Dig, dig, dig you better dead  
I'd dig, dig you better dead  
Somebody said  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'd dig you better dead, I'd dig you better dead  
Dig you better dead, I'd dig you better dead [Repeat: x3]
