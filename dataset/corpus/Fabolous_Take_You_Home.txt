(If I take you home, will you still be my thug baby)  
  
You gotta love the way this playa be minglin  
If you don't tell yo man mama, I ain't sayin a thing and  
That nigga got you used to the H.N.O. Kingsten  
I'm fuckin limbos, lay on the wingfin  
  
By the way I be blingin, the pay that I bring in  
Mind spendin a day with the kingpin?  
Answer yo cell, all day it been ringin  
Tell that nigga, we on our way out to England

The way the be jinglin, letz stay til the spring and  
Know I thugged you out, the way that you drinkin  
And don't be scared cabby, the Yay I be slingin

We can hop in a lid and fly where you want to be  
Yea, you a G, the type that ryde with them cameraz  
Instead of the rearviews on the V, I know  
  
[Chrous] (Lil' Mo)  
I wonder if I take you home  
Would you still be my thug baby  
Because I need one tonight  
I wonder if I take you home  
Would you still be my thug baby  
Because I need one tonight  
  
[Verse 2]  
Allright, okay...  
You just gotta stay patient boo  
I'm a make sure to take you, where eva you dream a vacation to  
You can push the grey station through  
  
I'm a sit in the passanger, and rock PlayStation 2  
How da hell [unknown] been tweekin out  
How you been sneekin out, spent weekends out  
She'll be tired of trainin dat month  
  
You probably be fakin' like you came and you ain't even nut  
Miss I'll pipe you til you get a pain in yo gut  
The kid'll be responsible for changin yo struck  
Wherever you hurt, I'ma rub it down  
  
I be ready to smack it up, flip it in public now  
I know how to get you hot, I know how to hit yo spot  
If I take you home, I know how to keep you stylin  
I know how to keep you smilin if I take you home, let's go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
I think it's just that ladies ???  
I'm in love with my red 6, and got a crush on a navy Caddy  
I like'em deepcut, bust, with crazy fatties  
They be wishin' I was just, they baby daddy  
  
I'm the one that make it real easy  
For you to just drop'em like he hot, like he Lil' Weezy  
I ain't goin' never make you feel sleezy  
And I'm a put the roof up on the drop if it feel breezy  
  
I love the way you smerk and giggle, jerk and wiggle  
Throw yo legs up while I work the middle  
Already told me how you strictly be witt'em  
Now I'm a show you so much cash, that you'll quickly forget'em  
  
I'm young, but know I'll have you in a bungalow  
Fillin' yo stomach wit Cris, yo lungz with dro  
I'll have you sprung fa sho  
It ain't goin' be no limit where yo tongue will go, ya heard me?  
  
[Chorus until fade]
