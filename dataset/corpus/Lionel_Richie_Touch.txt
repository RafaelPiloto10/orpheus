Making love the time is right  
Let me take you on a journey  
I want tonight to be the night  
I spend with you girl  
  
Just relax, close the door  
Don't hold back your feelings  
All I want to do is just explore  
The night with you girl  
  
Let me show you how love can feel  
Show you that my love is really real  
  
[Chorus:]  
Touch, let me touch you baby  
(I wanna touch your sweet body)  
Touch and touch  
(Touch, touch your sweet soul)  
Touch, let me hold you baby  
(Touch I want your mind to surrender)  
And touch and touch  
(Touch make me whole)  
  
Gentle whispers will fill the night  
Words hardly spoken  
I feel the passion, I see the light  
With you girl  
  
I want to live inside your fantasy  
I want to feel your fire burning  
I want to know just how free is free  
With you girl, only with you  
  
Do you feel what I feel inside  
If you do then come on take this ride  
  
Chorus  
Do you feel what I feel inside  
If you do then come on take this ride  
  
Chorus  
  
And touch, I want to touch  
I want to touch your mind  
I want to be your friend  
I want to touch your heart  
I want to touch in you
