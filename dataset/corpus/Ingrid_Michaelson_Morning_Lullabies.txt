Yesterday I woke up  
With your head on my arm  
My hand was numb, circulation gone  
But I dared not move the pretty sleeping one  
  
The sun had painted patterns on your face  
As you breathe Sunday air  
You rolled onto my open arms  
I became your pillow  
You let me smooth your hair  
  
I will sing you morning lullabies  
You are beautiful and peaceful this way  
I know you have to close your eyes on everyone  
Let me help you, I'll sing you to sleep  
With morning lullabies  
  
Let me lie in the curve of your body tonight  
And I will hear you tumble into sleep  
I will watch you heal  
I will watch you heal with me  
  
I will sing you morning lullabies  
You are beautiful and peaceful this way  
I know you have to close your eyes on everyone  
Let me help you, I'll sing you to sleep  
With morning lullabies  
  
I know you have to close your eyes on everyone  
Let me help you, I'll sing you to sleep  
With morning lullaby, bye baby  
Close your eyes and I will sing you  
Morning lullabies and I will sing you  
Morning lullabies
