Be free with your love  
Free with your love  
Be free with your love  
Free with your love  
Two young babes in a foreign land  
Draw no milk from the dusty sand  
Close heir eyes from the night so cold  
Feel the love in their mothers hold  
Two old men on their different shores  
Stretch the world with their tug of war  
Tension pulls on a tightening cord  
Spread your love over Mans discord  
Life's your reward  
So sing it to your Lord  
Be free with your love  
Free with your love  
Be free with your love  
Free with your love  
Science stands on threshold of life  
Man could be cut by a blow of its knife  
Time to live by a new resolution  
In the spirit of loves evolution  
Two young girls shining in the sun  
Feel your pain but they dance for everyone  
Beauty lives in their innocent glow  
Things so dear should be free to let grow  
So let your heart flow  
And sing it to your soul  
Be free with your love  
Free with your love  
Now baby, be free wih your love  
Free with your love  
Be free with your love  
Free with your love  
Now baby, be free wih your love  
Free with your love  
Be free with your love
