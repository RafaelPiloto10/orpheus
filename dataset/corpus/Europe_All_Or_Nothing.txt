I'd bet my soul on a roll of a dice  
I hit the ground runnin'  
And I never think twice  
I'd brave the heat of a  
Wild cat fire to satisfy  
My animal desire  
  
Can't stop me now  
I've set my sights on you  
Right to your heart  
My aim is true, that's why  
  
All or nothing at all  
Is how I feel about it  
Won't stand my back to the wall  
I'll find my way around it  
All or nothing at all  
There's nothing I won't do  
And the one thing I want  
All of is you  
  
Don't want to labor at love  
Rather do without  
Won't carry the touch  
I want to burn down the house  
I wanna give you all my lovin'  
Baby listen to this  
I would never settle for  
Anything less  
  
Can't stop me now  
Once you've got me goin'  
Can't slow me down  
I'm driven by your motion  
  
All or nothing at all  
Is how I feel about it  
Won't stand my back to the wall  
I'll find my way around it  
All or nothing at all  
There's nothing I won't do  
And the one thing I want  
All of is you
