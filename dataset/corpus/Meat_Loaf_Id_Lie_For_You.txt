I'd never tell you one lie  
I'd never let you down  
I'd never leave  
I'd be the one who'd always be around  
Baby give me a chance  
I'd pull the sun down from the sky  
To light your darkest night  
I wouldn't let one drop of rain fall down into your life  
Put your heart in my hands  
Baby believe me I could never do you wrong  
And I would never paint your world blue  
And if sometimes it seems I must have lost my mind  
I might be crazy, but I'm crazy about you  
I'd lie for you and that's the truth  
Do anything you asked me to  
I'd even sell my soul for you  
I'd do it all for you  
If you just believe in me  
Just take a look in my eyes  
You'll see a love that's blind  
Just take a hold of my hand  
And I'll take you to paradise  
Ain't a star that's too far  
Your every wish will be a wish  
That I will make come true  
And if you want the moon  
I swear I'll bring it down for you  
Let me into your heart  
Believe me baby, got your name carved on my soul  
'Cause you're the only one that I'll give it to  
Go let 'em say that I'm a fool to act this way  
'Cause if I'm crazy, I'm just crazy 'bout you  
I'd lie for you and that's the truth  
Do anything you asked me to  
I'd even sell my soul for you  
I'd do it all for you  
If you just believe in me  
I'd lie for you and that's the truth  
Move mountains if you want me to  
I'd walk across the fire for you  
I'd walk on the wild for you  
If you just believe in me  
And you will never see a day, I'll ever break your heart  
You'll see the sky fall down before it ever gets that far  
I'll show you Heaven every second that you're in my arms  
Baby I'm crazy, but I'm crazy 'bout you  
I'd lie for you and that's the truth  
Move mountains if you want me to  
I'd walk across the fire for you  
I'd walk on the wild for you  
If you just believe in me  
I'd walk across the wild for you  
Move mountains if you want me to  
I'd walk across the fire for you  
Do anything you asked me to  
I'd lie for you and that's the truth  
Do anything you asked me to  
I'd even sell my soul for you  
I'd do it all for you  
If you just believe in me  
I'd lie for you and that's the truth  
Move mountains if you want me to  
I'd walk across the fire for you  
I'd walk on the wild for you  
If you just believe in me  
I'd lie for you and that's the truth
