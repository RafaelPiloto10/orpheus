Met a shy guy from Knoxville, Tennessee  
High School Yum Yum, gimme some Henessey  
I threw him a ball but he didn't hit it  
Said gimme a call but he never did it  
  
I-I-I-I don't care, I don't care  
If you don't wanna bother with me baby,  
'Cause I-I-I-I don't care, I don't care  
There's better guys everywhere, so there!  
  
Never gonna say that I'm sorry I kissed him  
Guess it's not my day, he turned and I missed him  
I was workin' overtime, now I just wanna walk out.  
I just tried to make him mine, it's not like he's a knockout.  
  
I-I-I-I don't care, I don't care  
If you don't wanna bother with me baby,  
'Cause I-I-I-I don't care, I don't care  
There's better guys everywhere, so there!  
  
I-I-I-I don't care, I don't care  
If you don't wanna bother with me baby,  
'Cause I-I-I-I don't care, I don't care  
There's better guys everywhere...  
I-I-I-I don't care, I don't care  
If you don't wanna bother with me baby,  
'Cause I-I-I-I don't care, I don't care  
There's better guys everywhere, so there!
