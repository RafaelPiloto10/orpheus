Driving through the desert I met a man  
Who told me of his crazy plan  
He'd been walking there for 20 days  
He was gonna walk on for 20 more  
I said, "How 'bout a drink or a bite to eat"  
He said, "No, my faith is all I need"  
So then, save me, save me  
Mister walking man, if you can  
  
You don't need to prove a thing to me  
Just give me faith make me believe  
C'mon save me, save me  
Mister walking man, if you can  
C'mon save me, save me  
I said, "Stranger if you please"  
Save me, save me  
Stranger if you please  
Or am I too far gone?  
I said, "to get back home"  
  
How 'bout you take a ride with me  
We could kill some time, shoot the breeze  
He said, "every whispering wind and second counts"  
Oh, maybe if you walk but you should drive around  
  
Save me, save me  
Mister walking man, if you can  
C'mon save me, save me  
I said, "stranger, if you please"  
Save me, save me  
Stranger, if you please  
Or am I too far gone?  
To get back home  
  
I don't need you to stop the sunshine, no  
I don't need you to turn water into wine, no  
I don't need you to, to fly  
I'm just asking you to save me  
  
(You might try savin' yourself)  
I'm gonna save me  
(You might try savin' yourself)  
I swear those lips shine  
(You might try savin' yourself)  
As it, the, the moon it shines  
(You might try savin' yourself)  
Why don't you, save me  
(You might try savin' yourself)  
Come on and save me  
(You might try savin' yourself)  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
(You might try savin' yourself)  
Why don't ya save me  
(You might try savin' yourself)  
Why don't ya save me  
Save me, save me
