I am a small and lonely grape  
Clutching to the vine  
Waiting for the day when I'll become my Savior's wine  
Oh, wouldn't French cuisine just yearn it  
I've eternity to ferment  
But knowing me I'd end up ripple  
In a cellar of cheblis  
Are you a small and lonely grape  
Clutching to the vine  
Waiting for the day when you'll become your Savior's wine?  
Don't give up hope ye heavy laden  
You don't want to be a raisin  
There's a grape, grape joy in Jesus  
In the vineyard of The Lord
