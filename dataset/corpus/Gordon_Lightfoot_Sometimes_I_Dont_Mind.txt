Sometimes I don't mind the sunshine  
Sometimes I need the rain  
Sometimes I don't mind the fun times  
Sometimes they're all the same  
  
When I'm thinking of you  
There's a fever around I don't know what to do  
When I'm drinking to you  
I get down in my shoes in a waltz with the blues  
  
Sometimes I don't mind the sunshine  
Sometimes I need the rest  
Sometimes I don't mind a good time  
Sometimes I do what's best  
  
When I'm thinking of you  
There's a feeling inside which is long overdue  
When I'm drinking to you  
I get down in the mouth tell me what can I do  
  
Sometimes I don't mind the sunshine  
Sometimes I need the change  
Sometimes I don't mind a fun time  
To me it's all the same  
  
When I'm thinking of you  
There's a fever around I don't know what to do  
When I'm drinking to you  
I get down in my shoes in a waltz with the blues
