In the middle of Hollywood Boulevard  
Screaming at each other, screaming at each other  
Like oh oh oh, can't take it anymore  
Like a tragedy, like a dark comedy  
Laughing at each other, laughing at each other  
Like, oh oh oh it isn't funny anymore  
  
I was the man who never lied  
I never lied until today  
But I just couldn't break your heart  
Like you did mine yesterday  
I was the man who never lied, oh  
I was the man who never lied, oh yeah  
  
Sometimes honesty is the worst policy  
Happy ever after, happy ever after  
Let it go, you never need to know  
I don't wanna be picking up all of these  
Tiny little pieces, tiny little pieces  
Of your heart, won't do it anymore  
  
I was the man who never lied  
I never lied until today  
But I just couldn't break your heart  
Like you did mine yesterday  
I was the man who never lied, oh  
I was the man who never lied, oh  
  
I was the  
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh  
  
In the middle of Hollywood Boulevard  
What am I doing in Hollywood Boulevard?  
In the middle of Hollywood Boulevard  
Screaming at each other, screaming  
  
I was the man who never lied  
I never lied until today  
But I just couldn't break your heart  
Like you did mine yesterday  
  
I was the man who never lied  
Never lied until today  
But I just couldn't break your heart  
Like you did mine yesterday  
I was the man who never lied, oh (oh I was the man)  
I was the man who never lied, oh yeah (I was the man oh yeah)
