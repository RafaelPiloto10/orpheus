Here she comes, you better watch your step  
She's going to break your heart in two, it's true  
It's not hard to realize  
Just look into her false colored eyes  
She builds you up to just put you down, what a clown  
  
'Cause everybody knows  
(She's a femme fatale)  
The things she does to please  
(She's a femme fatale)  
She's just a little tease  
(She's a femme fatale)  
See the way she walks  
Hear the way she talks  
  
You're put down in her book  
You're number thirty seven, have a look  
She's going to smile to make you frown, what a clown  
Little boy, she's from the street  
Before you start, you're already beat  
She's going to play you for a fool, yes it's true  
  
'Cause everybody knows  
(She's a femme fatale)  
The things she does to please  
(She's a femme fatale)  
She's just a little tease  
(She's a femme fatale)  
See the way she walks  
Hear the way she talks  
  
'Cause everybody knows  
(She's a femme fatale)  
The things she does to please  
(She's a femme fatale)  
She's just a little tease  
(She's a femme fatale)  
Ooh ooh oh  
(She's a femme fatale)  
Ooh ooh oh
