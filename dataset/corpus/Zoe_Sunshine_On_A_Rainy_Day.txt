I see you in the darkness  
I see you in light  
I see your light shining in through the night  
Make me feel make me feel  
Like I belong  
Don't leave me Don't leave me here  
All I alone  
Cause' Your eyes like summer skies,  
Blue words in the ocean clear as in the skkkkyyyy!  
CHORUS: x4  
Sunshine on a rainy day  
Makes my soul, makes my soul  
Trip Trip Trip Away  
You touch me with your spirit  
You touch me with your heart  
You touch me in the darkness,  
A feeling starts  
Make you feel make you feel so unreal (so unreal)  
Like a wind in the desert  
Like a moon on the street  
CHORUS x4  
Instrumental  
Sunshine on a rainy day makes my soul makes my soul trip trip trip away x4
