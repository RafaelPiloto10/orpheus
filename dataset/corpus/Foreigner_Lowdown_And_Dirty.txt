This is the thirteenth day of waiting, the second long weekend  
These liberties you've taken, have got to end  
This distance you've been keeping, grows wider everyday  
Time is running out, there's nothing left to say  
  
Innocent child, that's what I once believed  
But now I know better, and I ain't gonna let you play that game with me  
I'm telling you mama  
I'm gonna get lowdown and dirty, run wild in the night  
Lowdown and dirty, this time I'll do it right  
Loving every minute, making up for lost time  
I'll get lowdown, lowdown and dirty  
  
A little time to do something, some searching of the soul  
I never knew your heart could be so cold  
You're driven by ambition and you want the best that you can get  
Ambition leads you blindly if you let it  
And I guess you let it  
  
That innocent smile, it fooled me all the way  
It drew me in, but now there's gonna be some hell to pay  
Gonna be hell to pay  
  
I'm gonna get lowdown and dirty, and break every rule  
Lowdown and dirty, nobody gonna treat me like a fool  
Running free and easy, now I'm out on the loose  
I'll get lowdown and dirty, lowdown and dirty tonight  
  
Such an innocent child, you fooled me all the way  
You drew me in, but now there is going to be some hell to pay  
  
I'm gonna get lowdown and dirty, run wild in the night  
Lowdown and dirty, do it good, do it right  
You see I've reaching for something that's been  
Missing in my life  
I've got to get lowdown and dirty, lowdown and dirty tonight  
Got to get, got to get, got to get lowdown and dirty  
If you could see me right now darlin' you'd see me flyin' high,  
Goin' crazy
