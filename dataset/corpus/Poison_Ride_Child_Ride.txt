Well I'm sitting here this evening  
I've got some old friends on my mind, yeah I do  
Yeah, me and Slick and Davy saluting Mr. Daniels  
For the very first time  
We was jamming to old Jimi, singing Purple Haze,  
No doubt, no, no  
I think between weed and whiskey  
My head went north and man, my feet went south  
  
We had some good times,  
And man do I remember them well  
Those days are long gone,  
But now I got to tell you just how we left some stories to tell  
  
[Chorus]  
Ride, child ride  
Hell we had some good times then  
Ride, child, ride  
Sometimes I need those times again  
Do you remember when?  
  
Remember all our big talk,  
How we were going to be president, one day, baby  
How we were going to save the whole world  
But man, I got to tell you Lord,  
Didn't have a clue back then  
  
We had some good times,  
And man do I remember them well  
Those days are long gone,  
But now I got to tell you just how we left some stories to tell  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ride, child, ride  
Hell, we had some good times then  
Ride, child ride  
Sometimes I need those times again  
Ride, child ride  
Hell, we had some good times then  
Ride, child, ride  
Take me back there, man, do you remember when?
