I went down to the  
Mary Cater Paint Store  
I said, give me one of them  
Smith and Wesson Magnum.44s  
  
'Cause there's a man that the law let loose  
And justice was not done  
This man he killed my wife  
And my only little son  
  
I'll never forget the way he looked  
All through the trial  
He had a big name lawyer  
And he had that smirky smile  
  
Oh yeah, he got you off  
On a technicality  
But you'd have to grow wings  
And fly to ever get away from me  
  
'Cause I got rights  
I got rights too  
And this time there won't be no damn lawyers  
And systems to protect you  
  
But I'm gonna read you  
I'm gonna read you your rights  
You got the right to know that you're gonna go to hell  
  
One of these black nights  
  
And when the trial was over he had the nerve to say  
"That's the way it goes"  
I said, "Well, hoss, you better get you some corks  
'Cause you're gonna have to plug up a few holes"  
  
I guess he thought I was talkin'  
Just to pass away time  
But he kinda looks different  
Now on his knees beggin' for his life  
  
Hey, I got rights  
I got some rights too  
And this time there won't be no damn lawyers  
And systems to protect you  
  
But I'm gonna read you  
I'm gonna read you your rights  
'Cause I want you to know that you're gonna go to hell  
One of these black nights  
  
Yeah, and this time there ain't no damn lawyers  
And systems to save you
