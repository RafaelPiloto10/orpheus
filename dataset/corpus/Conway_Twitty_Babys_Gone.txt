Baby's Gone  
My hand is trembling  
As the key unlocks the door  
My legs are shaky  
  
As I walk across the floor  
My voice weakens  
As I call out, "I'm home!"  
Do my eyes deceive me  
  
Or is my baby gone  
Baby's gone, she couldn't stand to tell me  
Face to face  
And things just ain't the way they used  
  
To be around this place  
Her perfume lingers  
Where she once lay her head  
And I can almost taste the teardrops  
  
That she shed  
As she searched her mind  
And tried to find  
Just where our love went wrong  
  
But it's ended and it's over  
Baby's gone
