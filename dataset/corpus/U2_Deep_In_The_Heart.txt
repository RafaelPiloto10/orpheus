Angel, everything's gonna be alright  
Angel, everything's gonna work out tonight  
Thirteen years old, sweet as rose  
Every petal of her wafer thin  
Love will make you mine  
Creep up from behind  
Get you jumping out of your skin  
Angel, it's sink or swim  
  
Deep in the heart  
Deep in the heart of this place  
Deep in the heart  
Deep in the heart of this place  
  
Door is closed behind me now  
The Window is sealed to shut out the light  
Green as the leaves  
And the cure of the meadow stain  
Do your work, it'll work out right  
  
Deep in the heart  
Deep in the heart of this place  
Deep in the heart  
Deep in the heart of this place  
  
The scent of cedar, I can still see her  
You can't return to the place you never left  
Angel, we'll make it work out tonight  
Angel, I wanna be home tonight  
  
Door is closed behind me now  
The window is sealed, they shut out the light  
Green as the leaves  
And the cure of the meadow stain  
I do my work, and you'll work out right  
  
Deep in the heart  
Deep in the heart of this place  
Deep in the heart  
Deep in the heart of this place
