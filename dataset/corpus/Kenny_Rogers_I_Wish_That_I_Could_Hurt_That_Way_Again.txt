Oh, I wish that I could hurt that way again  
At least I had you every now and then  
And in between the sorrow  
At least there was tomorrow  
And as long as there's tomorrow  
There's no end  
Oh, I wish that I could hurt that way again.  
  
Oh, I wish that we could play that game again  
Even though I'd always lose and you would win  
At times you would desert me  
The emptiness would hurt me  
But your coming back  
Was always worth the pain  
Oh, I wish that I could hurt that way again.  
  
I?d love to hear you tell me  
You don't need me anymore  
Just like you used to tell me everyday  
I'd love to watch you leaving  
Like the hundred times before  
At least my eyes could see you walk away.  
  
Oh, I wish
