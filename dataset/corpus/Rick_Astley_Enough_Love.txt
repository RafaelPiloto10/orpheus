Not so long ago my life was, oh, so easy  
I did what I want, said what I want  
I did what I want, said what I want  
Not so long ago my life was, oh, so easy  
I did what I want, said what I want  
I did what I want, and then you came  
Once in my life I found a joy like this  
One special moment captured in a kiss  
For the rest of my life I may never feel like this again, again  
I don't know if I'm ready, I hope I'm strong enough  
To be a man that someone can depend on  
I don't know if I'm ready but I know I've got enough love  
As the days go by I see that it's so easy  
To do what I want, say what I want  
Do what I want, say what I want  
As the days go by, yeah, I feel that it's so easy  
To do what I want, say what I want, do what I want  
And only once in my life I may find a joy like this  
One special moment captured by a kiss  
For the rest of my life I may never feel like this again, again  
I don't know if I'm ready, I hope I'm strong enough  
To be a man that someone can depend on  
I don't know if I'm ready but I know I've got enough love  
I've got enough love, ooh yeah, I've got enough love, ooh  
And only once in your life you may feel like this  
One special moment captured in a kiss  
For the rest of your life you may never feel like this again  
I don't know if I'm ready, I hope I'm strong enough  
To be a man that someone can depend on  
I don't know if I'm ready but I know I've got enough love
