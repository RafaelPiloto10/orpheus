have you ever seen, people turn into thy devil,  
over money green, Tell me what it means  
have you even been, to thy wicked part of town and,  
would you go again, they don't want you in  
Would you follow me, If i knew where it rains diamonds,  
no more poverty, as clean as we can be, yeah  
  
It rains diamonds nightly, in my Shangri-La lit brightly,  
who could miss this so inviting?  
Come stand mountain top and yell!

It rains diamonds mightly, in my Shangri-La lit brightly,  
who could miss this so inviting?

Diamonds drift upon thy mist of forgetfull ness,  
bringing a peace untold, as i fade away to become what my eyes see,  
seeing into thy eternity of Shangri-La  
  
It rains diamonds mightly, in my Shangri-La lit brightly,  
who could miss this so inviting?  
Come stand mountain top and yell!
