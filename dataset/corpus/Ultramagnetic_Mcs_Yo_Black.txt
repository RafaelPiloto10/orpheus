Bobbito's in the house!  
I gotta say one thing, y'all been great playin the real shit  
why'know, all this radio shit, this flower shit you be hearin  
All this la-la-la and this, TLC condoms on your eyes and all that shit  
I'm not with that..  
  
Yeah! You listenin to the sounds, of the one, Rhythm X -- the man  
I'ma show you how to get wreck  
The right way, not the wrong way  
Watch me when I do this, pay attention  
  
Check it out  
Shut up! Step back! That picky-packy-wacky rap  
Your old flow is over and your rhyme style is over with  
In fact, big head, yo take it as a bigger diss  
I come walk in your show like David Berkowitz  
Make you think you swimmin like that homey Mark Spitz  
How can you put up a fox, against an ALLIGATOR  
I chew your crew one by one, like a Now or Later  
I make a heavy man light, turn a black kid white  
Bust a rhyme in they rectum, squeeze it tight  
I wreck shop like Rock the Ricky Wrecka  
Crush-a, stomp-a, nother, brother  
I make MC's go,
