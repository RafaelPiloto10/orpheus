Me and my, me and my, me and my,  
Me and my, me and my friends  
Like two sweet peas  
In an even sweeter pod  
That's my friend  
And my friends named Bob  
Like the devil knows hell  
I know Bob well  
Well enough to tell you  
'bout his 67 smells  
Well enough to tell you  
He's a hell-a-swell fellow  
Well enough to tell you  
That we know each other better  
Than we know our selves  
Like freaks of a feather  
We rock together  
I know Bob well  
But I think he knows me better  
Me and my, me and my, me and my,  
Me and my, me and my friends  
He's as close to me  
As a friend can be  
I'll be standin' by my buddy  
He'll be standin' by me  
Just another half of  
The two headed freak  
But I need him like  
My heart needs to beat  
At this point  
In this friendly verse  
I've got to sing a little something  
That I haven't rehearsed  
It's about my man  
And his name is Hillel  
For who my love  
Is woul brother sacred  
Take it hickleberry  
Slim boy take it  
Me and my, me and my, me and my,  
Me and my, me and my friends  
Jacky's eyes are closed  
But he's right on course  
Because he's guided by  
The invisible force  
He drives a kooky green chrysler  
Bad as anybody's porsche  
He's a working class drummer  
He's as strong as a horse  
Me and my, me and my, me and my,  
Me and my, me and my friends
