There once was a group with Liam and Niall  
Vas Happenin' boys? Vas Happenin' boys?  
  
They lived with Zayn and their room was vile  
Vas Happenin' boys? Vas Happenin' boys?  
  
Did you know Harry's such a slob?  
He needs to win X Factor 'cause he can't get a job  
And Oh, Louis needs a boat  
He dresses like he owns one  
'Cause he's got no other clothes  
They really need your vote  
Vas Happenin' boys? Vas Happenin' boys?  
  
Mick Jagger could be Harry's dad  
Vas Happenin' mum? Vas Happenin' Mick?  
  
When Liam sings he makes his face look sad  
Vas Happenin' song? Vas Happenin' sad?  
  
And Zayn's the master of echoes  
And Niall was raised by leprechauns  
So he won't ever grow  
And Oh, Louis needs that boat  
He dresses like he owns one  
And it's becoming a joke  
They really need your vote  
  
Vas Happenin' boys? Vas Happenin' boys?  
Vas Happenin' boys? Vas Happenin' boys?  
Vas Happenin' boys? Vas Happenin' boys?
