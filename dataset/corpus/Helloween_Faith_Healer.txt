If your body's feeling bad  
And it's the only one you have  
You want to take away the pain  
Go out walking in the rain  
You watch the flowers go to bed  
Ask the man inside your head  
Your spirit never has to grieve  
All you've got to do's believe  
The faith healer, the faith healer  
  
All you've got to do is feel  
Your body's going to start to heal  
The fingertips of holy fire,  
Everlasting sweet desire  
It never mattered  
What the doctor said  
The healer man will sail away  
It's immortality for two,  
Oh the miracles  
They will come to you  
From faith healer,the faith healer  
Can I put my hands on you?  
Can I put my hands on you?  
  
Faith, and hope, and charity,  
The simple relativity  
He can make you understand  
All you've got to take his hand  
Remember somebody said  
Ask the man inside your head  
The fingertips of holy fire,  
Everlasting sweet desire  
The faith healer, the faith healer!  
Can I put my hands on you?  
Can I put my hands on you?  
Let me put my hands on you?  
Let me put my hands on you?  
Can I put my hands on you?  
Can I put my hands on you?  
The faith healer, the faith healer...
