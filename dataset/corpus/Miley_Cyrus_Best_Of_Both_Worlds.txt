Oh yeah  
Come on  
  
You get the limo out front (ohohoh)  
Hottest styles, every shoe, every color  
Yeah when you're famous it can be kinda fun  
It's really you but no one ever discovers  
  
In some ways you're just like all your friends  
But on stage you're a star  
  
You get the best of both worlds  
Chill it out, take it slow  
Then you rock out the show  
You get the best of both worlds  
Mix it all together  
And you know that it's the best of both worlds  
  
The best of both worlds  
  
You go to movie premiers (is that Orlando Bloom?)  
Hear your songs on the radio  
Livin' two lives is a little weird (yeah)  
But school's cool 'cause nobody knows [nobody knows]  
  
Yeah you get to be a small town girl  
But big time when you play your guitar  
  
You get the best of both worlds  
Chill it out, take it slow  
Then you rock out the show  
You get the best of both worlds  
Mix it all together  
And you know that it's the best of both  
You know the best of both worlds  
  
Pictures and autographs  
You get your face in all the magazines  
The best part is that  
You get to be whoever you wanna be  
  
Best... Best... Yeah the best of both  
Best... Best... You got the best of both  
Best... Best... C'mon the best of both  
  
Who would have thought that a girl like me  
Would double as a super staaaaaaaaaaaaaaar  
Woo!  
You get the best of both worlds  
Chill it out, take it slow  
Then you rock out the show  
You get the best of both worlds  
Mix it all together  
And you know that it's the best  
You get the best of both worlds  
Without the shades and the hair  
You can go anywhere  
You get the best of both worlds  
Mix it all together... Oh yeah  
It's so much better  
'Cause you know you've got  
The best of both girls
