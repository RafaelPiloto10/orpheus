Dream...Dream...  
  
Damaged...do you see through the scream...  
Damaged...but I know I will survive  
Damaged...but I guess I'll move on...  
  
Dream...Dream...  
Live this life before your soul's a small grain, in the sky...  
  
Just keeping it, keeping it on, on ,on...  
Just keeping it, keeping it on, on on...  
Just keep it, keep it, keep it on, just keeping it, keep anything...  
  
Dream...Dream...  
Live this life before your soul's a small grain, in the sky  
  
Damaged...do you see through the scream  
Damaged...but I know I will survive  
Damaged...but I guess I'll move on  
  
To many people, to many dreams now, to many dreams now,  
I gonna come out now, I've gotta come back now...  
  
Dream...Dream...Yeah, dream  
Live your life before your soul's a small grain in the sky  
  
Dream...Dream...  
Live your life before your soul's a small grain in the sky
