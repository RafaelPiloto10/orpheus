It's time now to pick all the toys off the floor  
I'll say it again and I've said it before  
We don't have a nickel to spend at the store  
And don't run away from me now  
Your daddy's gone looking to find him a job  
Your grandmother's sent all her welfare to god  
Your brother's been taking it out on the dog  
So don't run away from me now  
There's you and your brothers and sisters to care for  
But I don't know how when we ain't got the wherefor  
So come let me hug you and show you what love's for  
And don't run away from me now  
The screaming and shouting's all done for today  
I'll clear up the mess when you're all out the way  
So give us a kiss 'cause there's nothing to say  
But don't run away from me now  
There's you and your brothers and sisters to care for  
A whole lot of things that you should say your prayers for  
So don't make a fuss now or I'll give you what for  
Just don't run away from me now  
Don't run away from me now
