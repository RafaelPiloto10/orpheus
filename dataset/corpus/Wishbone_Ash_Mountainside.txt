It was a night, yeah, the kind of night  
Left me pacing 'cross the floor.  
It was a dream, like those other dreams,  
So many times before.  
I went back to the old town,  
To the streets I used to roam,  
And I looked into my daddy's eyes  
And asked that fatal question, "why'd  
You have to go? "  
You had to go.  
  
There was a time when life was good  
And everything felt so right.  
I don't know why, I never understood  
Why you left us on that night.  
I went back, to that day when you left us on our own -  
Now I look into my baby's eyes  
And I just know there is no way  
I'd ever go.  
I'll never go.  
  
Take me to the mountainside,  
Far away from here,  
Where my eyes are open wide -  
No one gets too near.
