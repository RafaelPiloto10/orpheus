Strange times in Portland, Maine  
Lobsters dancing on the dock  
Switzerland's been weird since they unplugged the clocks  
Man and a woman living in Brooklyn Heights  
Each convinced that the other is in the wrong  
Last year the divorce rate tripled in Hong Kong  
If through all the madness  
We can stick together  
We're safe and sound  
The world's just inside out and upside down  
  
Flash from Mexico, the tornadoes have all turned gay  
Roman whores have quit to seek a better way  
Dope has undermined the morale of the Buckingham Palace guards  
Motorcycle gangs ride naked down Hollywood Boulevard  
If through all the madness  
We can stick together  
We're safe and sound  
The whole world's just turned inside out and upside down  
  
Marahaj wants you to lead a pilgrimage to Tibet  
New York women want me sounding off like a Suffragette  
I know that each of us is alone in the end  
But the trip still feels less dangerous when you've got a friend  
If we stick together  
You and me forever  
We're safe and sound  
The world's just turned inside out and upside down  
The world's just turned inside out and upside down
