Like every young man, I had some things that I  
Wanted to say  
Ere I could begin, you know the world got  
In my way  
  
Oh Lilah, to sleep like a baby  
To open the window and reel the fair wind  
Oh Lilah, to sleep like a baby again  
We spend so much time weeping and wailing and  
  
Shaking our fists  
Creating enemies that really don't exist  
Oh Lilah, to sleep like a baby-  
To open the window and feel the fair wind  
  
Oh Lilah, to sleep like a baby again  
All these comings and goings that cut like a knife  
These small, simple pleasures that make up a life  
A man needs a home, and a child, and a wife  
  
To always be there-always  
After I'm gone, there are some things that I know  
I will miss:  
The taste of your mouth, the smell of the perfume  
  
On your wrist Oh, Lilah, the fields lie fallow  
What are ye sow, so shall ye reap  
Oh Lilah, this ground we hallow  
Is ours to tend, but not to keep  
  
Too-rah, loo-rah, loo-rah Lilah  
Too-rah, loo-rah, loo-rah lay  
Now, while all the streets are silent  
Take my hand and come away
