I hear the chimes playing the evening breeze,  
Bringing the night along it's way.  
Just like the tide swaying the endless sea,  
It keeps you forever from the day.  
  
Chorus  
Haunt me tonight.  
Float to me on your illusion.  
Show me a sign to let me know.  
Haunt me tonight  
Let me see your silent vision,  
That's all of your light I have to hold.  
  
I can't explain, can't even understand  
How what we had has come to this.  
When loves sweet refrain is played with a ghostly hand,  
And I am so helpless to resist.  
  
Chorus  
Haunt me tonight.  
Float to me on your illusion.  
Show me a sign to let me know  
Yeah, yeah.  
Haunt me tonight.  
Let me see your silent vision,  
That's all of your light I have to hold.  
  
[guitar interlude]  
  
I feel you near, waiting beyond the shore,  
Don't leave me longing anymore, ooh. ..  
  
Repeat chorus
