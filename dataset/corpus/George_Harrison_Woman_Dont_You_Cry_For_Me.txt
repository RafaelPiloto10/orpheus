I'm gonna leave you here  
I'm gonna leave you at the station  
I've got a long way to go baby  
Woman don't you cry for me  
  
Now I can't take no more  
Now I don't need no complication  
I've got a long way to go baby  
Woman don't you cry for me  
  
There's no one place I want to be  
Attachment only hurts you  
Take care of yourself baby  
C'mon won't you let me be  
  
There's just one thing I got to see  
That's the Lord got to keep him in sight  
Take care of yourself baby  
C'mon won't you let me be  
  
There's no one place I want to be  
Attachment only hurts you  
Better take care of yourself baby  
C'mon won't you try to see  
  
There is just one thing I got to see  
That's the Lord got to keep him in sight  
Take care of yourself baby  
C'mon won't you let me be  
  
Now baby here's the door  
I don't need no aggravation  
I've got a long way to go baby  
Woman don't you cry for me  
  
I'm gonna leave you here  
I'm gonna leave you at the station  
I've got a long way to go baby  
Woman don't you cry for me  
  
I've got a long way to go baby  
Woman don't you cry for me
