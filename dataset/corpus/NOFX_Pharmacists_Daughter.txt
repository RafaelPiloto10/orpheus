Give her a call for Demerol and Amal Nitrate  
I tell her dad don't worry sir we won't stay out late  
I'm in love with her the pharmacist's daughter  
She's got my love, I get her drugs  
  
Waking up in the afternoon can't wait to see her  
Bringin' in some colonopin, I'm huffin' ether  
  
She's the one for me without personality I still want to see her everyday  
  
We got a date and I can't wait to see my baby  
If I wine and dine her she just might sedate me  
She's so beautiful, she keeps my prescriptions full  
She's got my love I get her drugs  
  
She's got my love I get her drugs  
She's got my love I get her drugs  
Looks like I've gone and bought the pharmacy
