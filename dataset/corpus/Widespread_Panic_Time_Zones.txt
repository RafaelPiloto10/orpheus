Time zones  
It doesn't matter where you go or how you wiggle and squirm  
We're in a maze, baby  
All alone  
What doesn't kill you has a momma's way of  
Helping ya learn  
Blast off!  
Five, four, three, baby 'bout to  
Push it through  
It's a payoff  
You can tell cause  
Don't tow it away  
We'll all be back tomorrow  
After today  
We'll all come back tomorrow.  
Pit stop  
We're in the middle, everybody's learnin' to breathe  
Leavin' like an  
Earthquake  
Leaves you shakin' but at least we're not  
Shakin' alone  
Angel bright, life and death  
Up the road gonna salt my bread  
Angels fly around my head  
All gatherin' at the foot of my bed  
Don't believe the lies they said  
Keep it simple around  
Hot steam  
We're in the middle and baby that's a  
Beautiful thing  
Don't kill the  
Mockingbird, who's really just  
Learning to sing  
Don't tow it away  
Angel bright, life and death
