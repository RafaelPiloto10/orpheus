How can I sleep tonight?  
When I know that tomorrow I'll be miles away,  
And how can I leave if I know when I kiss you goodbye,  
Baby you'll cry  
  
Where do I find the words?  
To convince you that there's a secret part of me,  
That dies every time I must pack up and walk out the door,  
When I'm wanting you more  
  
So while there's still time,  
Know that I love you,  
Baby please hold me tight,  
Girl while there's still time  
  
If I could stop the dawn,  
Make the moon and the stars shine on forever more,  
And never again have to say how much I'm missing you,  
But what can I do?  
  
So while there's still time,  
Say that you love me,  
Baby please hold me tight,  
Girl while there's still time  
  
If I should go, if I should go,  
There's a chance I could lose,  
The love of my life, the love of my life,  
Baby please don't make me choose  
  
Believe me  
Trust me  
Let me inside  
  
And while there's still time,  
Forget about tomorrow,  
Baby please let's not fight,  
Not while there's still time  
While there's still time  
While there's still time  
While there's still time  
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
