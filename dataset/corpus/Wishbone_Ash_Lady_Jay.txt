Hear me when I cry,  
Listen to my song  
The jay, my lovely lady,  
To the earth she did belong.  
I can't trace her,  
Lost her from my life,  
But the manor lady's bright young son  
Can take her for his wife.  
Under the forest branches  
She came to me,  
Until the day she cried aloud  
A father I should be.  
That was the last time that we met,  
I never saw her again,  
For she took her life on princeton wharf  
To save my worthy name.  
She found death's open arms  
And lay in them in grace  
I watched as icy fingers  
Clawed her lovely face.  
Now I stumble through the mist  
To where they laid her in the grave,  
And maybe I'll remember  
The flowers for my days.  
Far beyond the sand  
I will take your hand,  
The spirit of our love will live forever.  
Far beyond the clouds  
We will laugh aloud,  
The spirit of our love will live again.
