As I lay me down  
Heaven hear me now  
I'm lost without a cause  
After giving it my all  
  
Winter storms have come  
And darkened my sun  
After all that I've been through  
Who on earth can I turn to  
  
I look to you  
I look to you  
  
After all my strength is gone  
In you I can be strong  
  
I look to you  
I look to you  
  
Yeah  
  
And when melodies are gone  
In you I hear a song  
  
I look to you, you  
  
About to lose my breathe,  
There's no more fighting left,  
I'm sinking to rise no more,  
Searching for that open door, door  
  
Every road that I've taken  
Lead to my regret.  
I don't know if I'm going to make it.  
Nothing to do but lift my head  
  
I look to you.  
I look to you.  
After all my strength is gone,  
In you I can be strong  
I look to you.  
I look to you.  
And when melodies are gone,  
In you I hear a song.  
I look to you (Whitney)  
We love you Whitney, rest in peace
