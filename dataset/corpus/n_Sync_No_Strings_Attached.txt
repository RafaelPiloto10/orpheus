Baby, you're not the only one  
I see the things he does to you  
All the pain that he puts you through  
If I see what's really going on  
Staying out at night  
While you're by the phone  
  
Take it from me  
It's a lesson to be learned  
Even the good guys get burned  
Take it from me  
See, I would give you love  
The kind of love that you've only dreamed of  
  
Baby, you're not the only one  
You don't have to be afraid to fall in love  
And I know that you've hurt in the past  
But if you want it here's my heart  
No strings attached  
  
He doesn't give you the kind of attention  
That a girl like you needs (that a girl like you needs)  
'cause he always looks around  
His eyes wander around  
He doesn't see you like I see  
  
Take it from me  
It's a lesson to be learned  
Even the good guys get burned  
Take it from me  
Baby, I would give you love  
The kind of love that you'd only dreamed of  
  
Baby, you're not the only one (baby, you're not the only one)  
You don't have to be afraid to fall in love (to fall in love)  
And I know that you've hurt in the past (hurt in the past)  
If you want it here's my heart (here's my heart)  
No strings attached  
  
Take it from me  
It's a lesson to be learned

(If you) Baby (take) take a chance (a chance) with me
