There's a crooked street in Houston town  
It's a well born path I've traveled down  
Now there's ruin in my name, I wish I never got off the train  
I wished I'd listened to the words you said  
  
Don't go down to Fannin Street  
Don't go down to Fannin Street  
Don't go down to Fannin Street  
You'll be lost and never found  
You can never turn around  
Don't go down to Fannin Street  
  
Once I held you in my arms, I was sure  
But I took that silent stare through the guilded door  
The desire to have much more, all the glitter and the roar  
I know this is where the sidewalk ends  
  
Don't go down to Fannin Street  
Don't go down to Fannin Street  
Don't go down to Fannin Street  
You'll be lost and never found  
You can never turn around  
Don't go down to Fannin Street  
  
When I was young I thought only of getting out  
I said goodbye to my street, goodbye to my house  
Give a man gin, give a man cards, give an inch he takes a yard  
And I rue the day that I stepped off this train  
  
Don't go down to Fannin Street  
Don't go down to Fannin Street  
Don't go down to Fannin Street  
You'll be lost and never found  
You can never turn around  
Don't go down to Fannin Street
