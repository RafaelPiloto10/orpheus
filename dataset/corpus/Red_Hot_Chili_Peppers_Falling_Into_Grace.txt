What ever never knew  
That I could feel so good  
Smile in your eyes  
What ever never knew  
That I could walk through wood  
I guess I never tried  
A million years old  
But just a little girl  
Vibin' off the gong  
Rubbin' on the bowls  
Make you float around  
Make your lovin' strong  
  
And when we get  
In the same place  
At the same time  
It is your grace  
That I want to  
Fall right into now  
To love avow  
  
I'm falling into grace with you  
I'm falling into guru muhk  
I'm falling into grace with you  
I'm falling into guru muhk  
  
She moves in a rapture  
That her capsule might  
Land on your star  
Meditating in the morning  
Head dressed in white  
Beauty bazaar  
  
You can smell the purple light  
Comin' from her heart  
Get lost and wet  
I treat you like a teacher  
Cause that's what you are  
I want to be your pet  
  
And when we get  
In the same place  
At the same time  
It is your grace  
That I want to  
Fall right into now  
To love avow
