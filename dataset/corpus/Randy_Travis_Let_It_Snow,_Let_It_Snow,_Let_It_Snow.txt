Oh the weather outside is frightful  
But the fire is so delightful  
And since we've no place to go  
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!  
  
It doesn't show signs of stopping  
So I've bought some corn for popping  
The lights are turned way down low  
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!  
  
When we finally kiss goodnight  
How I'll hate going out in the storm!  
But if you'll only hold me tight  
All the way home I'll be warm  
  
Oh, the fire is slowly dying  
And, my dear, we're still good-bying  
As long as you love me so  
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!
