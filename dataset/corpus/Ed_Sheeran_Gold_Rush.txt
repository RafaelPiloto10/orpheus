Smoke alarm went off at night  
I woke up wiped the sleep out of my eye  
She left a note, I'll be back in five  
Well I'm still waiting for that moment to arrive  
  
Hey!  
  
I was told to put my job in front of you,  
But it won't hold me like you do  
  
But I do it for the love,  
Waiting on the gold rush  
Keep it on the edge  
Smoking on a roll up  
When I see my friends all they say is hold up  
And remember the time  
When we were in school, listening to grown ups  
Didn't learn a thing, but then again you know what  
You know how to sing  
But you don't know anything other than that  
  
So maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way  
And maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way  
And maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way  
And maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way  
You wanna be loved  
  
I never told her that I liked  
The way she dances slightly out of time  
And pretends she knows the words, to a song she's never heard  
But I tell her all the time  
  
Hey!  
  
Well I was told to put my job in front of you  
But it won't hold me like you do  
  
But I do it for the love, waiting on the gold rush

And maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way  
But maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way  
And maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way  
You wanna be loved, hey  
  
I do it for the love, waiting on the gold rush  
Keep it on the edge, smoking on a roll up
