Ignorance is bliss, ya know it's true  
Ignorance is bliss, just look at you  
Is it goin' anywhere?  
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, yeah!  
What's happening to our society?  
Disintegration of humanity  
Destruction of the environment  
Cram that cop donation in your ass  
  
Is it goin' anywhere?  
(?) Politicians to confuse you  
What's good for them, now it ain't good for you  
But there ain't nothing that you can do  
  
I'm alive, I'm alive,  
I'm alive, yeah!
