We were just two kids in high school  
Who'd never been in love before  
Just happened to be together  
We never wanted more  
We had one long crazy summer  
Life was like a honeymoon  
But we couldn't hold back our feelin's  
Guess you came along too soon  
  
Ooh, darlin'  
I think we fell in love too fast  
Ooh, darlin'  
I think we fell in love too fast  
  
I was workin' my way through college  
When you wrote and told me the news  
Said you were gonna have a baby  
Yeah, I knew my college days were through  
Had to work late to make the money  
You saw more of the kid than me  
I guess I knew I failed you when  
You said that you'd rather be free  
You wanted to be free  
  
Ooh, darlin'  
I think we fell in love too fast  
Ooh, darlin'  
I think we fell in love too fast  
  
Well I heard you got away to Florida  
Got a husband, took the kid  
I bet they think the whole world of you  
Just like I always did  
You were the only one I ever wanted  
But I know you can't be replaced  
If only we'd met a little later, babe  
We wouldn't of made the same mistakes  
  
Oh, no, no, no, ooh  
Darlin', yeah  
I think we fell in love too fast  
I know it now  
Ooh, darlin', darlin'  
I know we fell in love too fast, too fast  
Ooh, darlin', yeah  
I think we fell in love too fast  
I know it now  
Ooh, darlin', darlin'  
I know we fell in love too fast, too fast
