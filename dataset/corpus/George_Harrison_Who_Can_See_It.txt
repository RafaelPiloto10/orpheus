I've been held up,  
I've been run down  
I can see quite clearly now  
Through those past years,  
When I played towing the line.  
I only ask, that what I feel,  
Should not be denied me now,  
As it's been earned, and  
I have seen my life belongs to me  
My love belongs to who can see it  
  
I've lived in fear,  
I've been out there,  
I've been 'round and  
Seen my share  
Of this sad world  
And all the hate,  
That it's stirred  
I only ask,  
That what I know,  
Should not be denied me now  
As it's been learned,  
And I have seen my life belongs to me  
My love belongs to who can see it  
  
I only ask, that what I feel,  
Should not be denied me now  
As it's been earned, and  
I have seen my life belongs to me  
  
My love belongs to who can see it.  
  
My love belongs to who
