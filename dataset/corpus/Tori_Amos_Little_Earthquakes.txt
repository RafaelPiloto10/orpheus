Yellow bird flying gets shot in the wing  
Good year for hunters and Christmas parties  
And I hate and I hate and I hate  
And I hate elevator music  
The way we fight  
The way I'm left here silent  
  
Oh these little earthquakes  
Here we go again  
These little earthquakes  
Doesn't take much to rip us into pieces  
  
We danced in graveyards with vampires till dawn  
We laughed in the faces of king never afraid to burn  
And I hate and I hate and I hate  
And I hate disintegration  
Watching us wither  
Black winged roses that safely changed their color  
  
Oh these little earthquakes  
Here we go again  
These little earthquakes  
Doesn't take much to rip us into pieces  
  
I can't reach you  
I can't reach you  
  
Give me life  
Give me pain  
Give me myself again  
  
Oh these little earthquakes  
Here we go again  
These little earthquakes  
Doesn't take much to rip us into pieces  
Doesn't take much to rip us into pieces  
Doesn't take much to rip us into pieces
