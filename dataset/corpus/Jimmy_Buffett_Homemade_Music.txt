I ain't no video king  
I still have to sing  
For my supper each night  
  
You stand on the benches  
I play in the trenches  
Beneath the big spotlights  
Lived in a suitcase for half of my years  
I got strange little voices that live in my ears  
Hall monster, mall monster  
I can't be the old me no more  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Homemade music down in the passion pits  
Homemade music lots o grits but no hits  
Homemade music is part of my philosophy  
  
Oh cooking is a pleasure  
And singing is a treasure  
That most don't' find  
  
There ain't' no harm in telling  
I like to eat my melon right  
Down to the rind  
  
I had a hippy girlfriend when I was a kid  
She died and went to the suburbs most of them did  
Where did all the wild ones go  
  
Homemade music ain't on the radio  
Homemade music searching high and low  
Homemade music where did all the good songs go  
  
First there were records, then cassettes and CDs  
Managers, lawyers, then came the Japanese  
But homemade music still makes a lot of sense to me  
  
Homemade music is funky and nice  
Homemade music sits on very thin ice  
But homemade music is part of my philosophy  
  
Homemade music ain't on the radio  
Homemade music searching high and how  
Homemade music where did all the good songs go
