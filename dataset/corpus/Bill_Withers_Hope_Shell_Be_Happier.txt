Maybe the lateness of the hour  
Makes me seem bluer than I am  
But in my heart there is a shower,  
I hope she'll be happier with him.  
Maybe the darkness of the hour  
Makes me seem lonelier than I am,  
But over the darkness I have no power,  
Hope she'll be happier with him.  
  
I can't believe that she don't want to see me,  
We lived and loved with each other so long.  
I never thought that she really would leave me,  
But she's gone.  
Maybe the lateness of the hour  
Makes me seem bluer than I am,  
But in my heart there is a shower,  
Hope she'll be happier with him.
