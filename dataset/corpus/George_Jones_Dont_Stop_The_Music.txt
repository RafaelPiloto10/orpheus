Don't stop the music let it play one more song  
The same one that's played tonight for so long  
She's out with another I saw them tonight  
Sitting there close together she knows that not right  
So don't stop the music let it play one more song  
The same one that's played tonight for so long  
My pockets are empty I spent my last dime  
But I've just got to hear that song one more time  
  
Don't be mad at me Mister I know that it's wrong  
But I want you to hear the words of that song  
So don't stop the music don't make me go home  
I know she's not there and I cry all night long  
So don't stop the music...
