Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
  
Beneath this balcony of stars  
Beyond the searchlight stage where we've become  
The stuff of time amid the waves  
Whose nets are cast along the shore when day is done  
  
As the seabird flies aboce  
My songs are sung to those I've come to love  
The petals strung into the leis  
The flowering of days I've just begun  
  
A second chance to grasp a dance  
Beneath the last rays setting of the sun  
Tears along the trail of sand  
Footprints in the water lead me back to who I am  
  
When gods and goddesses decreed  
The mountains raised up from beneath the seas  
The sound of sovereign thrones  
Above the hand tied bureaucrat who moans  
  
This crazy love amazes me  
As I just gaze into your eyes  
The liquid sun is split upon the sea  
I want to be where I can see the moon arise  
  
A second chance to grasp a dance  
Before the moment fades to summarize  
Tears along the trail of sand  
Footprints in the water lead me back to who I am  
  
Along the lonely stretch of sand  
Reduced to just a woman and a man  
Bathed in the lunar light  
The likes of which I might just understand  
  
Among the myths I know are real  
The goddess disguised as herself revealed  
I sang her song out loud  
She sat herself beside me in the crowd  
  
A second chance to grasp a dance  
Into the moment that she would allow  
Tears along the trail of sand  
Footprints in the water lead me back to who I am
