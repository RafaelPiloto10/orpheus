Why don't you take the rest of the day off  
You do deserve a break  
Follow that road, it ain't long  
Just cross that silver lake  
Yea, pass the pond, the off-white fence  
When you see the mailbox to the left you've made it all right,  
No way to go wrong  
All you do is blow that horn  
  
It takes you no time to get here  
Just drive out of town today  
It takes you no time to get here and when  
You've arrived you might as well stay  
You might as well stay  
  
Why don't you leave your desk for a short while  
You do deserve some time  
Enjoying the other side of life you forgot to memorize  
Stay in the sun, reach for the moon  
Make a little love in the afternoon  
You're doing all right, no way you go wrong  
This is the place where you belong  
  
It takes you no time  
No time to get here
