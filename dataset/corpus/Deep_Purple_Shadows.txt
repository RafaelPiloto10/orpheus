You think by leaving me the sun will go away  
You think that if you go there'll be no other way  
But your leaving now won't even spoil my day  
  
Oh no no no  
Oh no no no  
You keep a-waiting for the tears I'm supposed to cry  
The promise leaves so I'm supposed to die  
I'd forgotten who you were until you dropped on by  
  
Oh no no no  
Oh no no no  
Oh no no no  
Oh no no no  
You think I'm guilty throwing off the likes of you  
That there'll be no one else but there'll be quite a few  
At least I've got my health and somehow I'll pull through  
  
Oh no no no  
Oh no no no  
Oh no no no  
Oh no no no  
Oh no no no  
Oh no no no  
Oh no no no  
Oh no no no
