When you move in right up close to me  
That's when I get the shivers all over me  
Shivers down my backbone  
I get the shakes in the thighbone  
Shivers in my knee bone  
Shakin' all over  
  
Just the way you say goodnight to me  
There's a feeling on the side of me  
Shivers down my backbone  
I got the shakes in my thighbone  
Shivers in my kneebone  
Shakin' all over  
  
Just the way you say goodnight to me  
Brings a feeling I'm inside of me  
Shivers down my backbone  
I've got the shakes in my thighbone  
Oh shivers in my knee bone  
I'm shakin' all over  
I'm shakin' all over  
I'm shakin' all over  
  
When you're moving right up close to me  
That's when I get the shivers all over me  
Just the way you say goodnight to me  
Brings a feeling outside of me  
I'm shakin' all over  
I'm shakin' all over  
I'm shakin' all over
