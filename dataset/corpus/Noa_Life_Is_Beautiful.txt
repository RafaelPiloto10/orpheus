Smile, without a reason why  
Love, as if you were a child,  
Smile, no matter what they tell you  
Don't listen to a word they say  
Cause life is beautiful that way.  
  
Tears, a tidal wave of tears  
Light, that slowly disappears  
Wait, before you close the curtain  
There is still another game to play  
And life is beautiful that way  
  
Here with his eyes forevermore  
I will always be as close as you  
Remember from before  
Now that you're out there on your own  
Remember what is real and  
What we dream is love alone  
  
Keep the laughter in you eyes  
Soon your long awaited prize  
We'll forget about our sorrows  
And think about a brighter day  
Cause life is beautiful that way.  
  
We'll forget about our sorrows  
And think about a brighter day,  
Cause life is beautiful that way  
There's still another game to play  
And life is beautiful that way.
