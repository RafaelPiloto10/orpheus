There was a man  
A lonely man  
Who lost his love  
Through his indifference.  
A heart that cares  
That went unshared  
And slowly dies  
Within his silence.  
  
Chorus:  
Now solitaire's the only game in town and  
Every road that takes me takes me down,  
I find myself that's easy to pretend,  
I'll never love again and deep into myself I play the  
Game, without you love it always ends the same,  
While life goes all around me everywhere, I'm playing Solitaire.  
  
Another day a lonely day  
So much to say that goes unspoken  
And through the night  
Each sleepless night  
The eyes are closed  
The heart is broken.  
  
Chorus:  
Now Solitaire's the only game in town and  
Every road that takes me takes me down,  
I find myself that's easy to pretend I'm coming back  
Again and deep into myself I play the game without  
You love it always ends the same,  
While life goes all around me everywhere, I'm playing Solitaire.  
Solitaire's the only game in town.  
Every road that takes me takes me down.
