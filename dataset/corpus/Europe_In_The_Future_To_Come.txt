So many tears ago the people on this earth  
They were laughin'  
They didn't think of anything else  
Than love and peace  
But generations failed to see  
That they were causin'  
Trouble for the future  
They didn't know that one single war  
  
Would continue to increase  
But I'll be beside you  
'Cause I want to hide you  
  
I'll cover my pain  
Or I'll gone insane  
Oh Lord where will it end  
When tomorrow is done  
Oh Lord can we stop to pretend  
That we can survive in the future to come  
  
As long as you can see  
As long as you can feel  
There's no cause for alarm  
As long as you can touch  
As long as you can more  
  
It ain't too bad  
But one day or another  
This world would maybe  
Be destroyed forever  
A holocaust maybe be spread  
And drive us all mad
