Funny how everything changes for me  
Memories take me away  
Each time I open the door to my room  
Where I must stay in all day  
  
I don't want to be here, I'm much too tired  
So I close my eyes and, 'snap', I'm with you  
We are on vacation, you and me together  
Lying in the sunshine  
  
I travel to Romantis  
I travel to Romantis  
Where nothing but the blue skies  
Will tell me that the time flies  
I travel to Romantis  
Every time I think of you  
You're giving me my life back  
I travel to Romantis  
  
One day I'll give you myself in a ring  
Bounded by law and by heart  
(Bounded by law and by heart)  
It's you and me against the world  
That is the way it should be  
(That is the way it should be)  
  
I don't want to be here, I'm much too tired  
So I close my eyes and, 'snap', I'm with you  
We are on vacation you and me together  
Lying in the sunshine  
  
I travel to Romantis  
I travel to Romantis  
Where nothing but the blue skies  
Will tell me that the time flies  
I travel to Romantis  
Every time I think of you  
You're giving me my life back  
I travel to Romantis  
  
Give me my life back  
  
You are the best  
You are the best that has happened to me  
You're giving me my life back  
I travel to Romantis  
  
You are the best that has happened to me  
Please, God, let it be  
  
I travel to Romantis  
I travel to Romantis  
Where nothing but the blue skies  
Will tell me that the time flies  
I travel to Romantis  
(I travel to Romantis)  
Every time I think of you  
You're giving me my life back  
I travel to Romantis  
  
I travel to Romantis  
I travel to Romantis  
Where nothing but the blue skies  
Will tell me that the time flies  
I travel to Romantis  
Every time I think of you  
You're giving me my life back  
I travel to Romantis
