I sit and wonder  
How my life would be  
If you were here with me  
What a beautiful fantasy  
Early in the morning  
I find myself with tears in my eyes  
From a dream that you're featured in  
And it hurts deep inside  
To know that you won't let me in to your life  
And I wonder why  
I'm going crazy  
I keep thinking about your foolish smile  
Here I go I just can't stop  
  
Dreamin'  
Dreamin'  
All the time  
I'm dreamin' of all the joy we could have baby  
Dreamin'  
Dreamin'  
For your heart  
I'm dreamin' of all the love that we could share  
  
It's my decision  
To leave you now  
Just because it hurts too much  
Knowing you'll never give enough  
But how I long to  
Experience the magic of your touch again  
Now you're always on my mind  
I just can't stop  
  
Dreamin'  
Dreamin'  
All the time  
I'm dreamin' of all the time we could have baby  
Dreamin'  
Dreamin'  
For your heart  
I'm dreamin' of all the love that we could share  
  
I think of the time we had  
You're making me want you so bad  
I'm watching you walk away  
But I wish I could make you stay  
The only thing that I can do  
Is baby, baby to dream of you  
I wake up in the morning thinking 'bout you baby  
All the time and the time that we could be together yeah
