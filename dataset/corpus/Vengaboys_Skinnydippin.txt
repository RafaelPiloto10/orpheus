Here's an invitation and you gotta bring your friends along.  
  
Gonna pick you up tonight at one.  
  
A private Vengaparty that is gonna last the whole night long  
  
Party till the cops show up, 'cause then we gotta run.  
  
  
We don't care what the people say,  
  
Nothing's gonna stop us gonna do it anyway.  
  
Tonight's the night let us show you how  
  
Hey what you waiting for... get in the water now!!!!  
  
  
Listen up tonight it's on  
  
Take your clothes off  
  
Skinnydippin' all night long  
  
That's what we love  
  
come along let's have some fun  
  
Take your clothes off  
  
skinnydippin' all night long  
  
  
Get in the water now!  
  
Take your clothes off!  
  
Get in the water now!  
  
That's what we love!
