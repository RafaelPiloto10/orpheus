You got yours and I got mine  
She got his and she got shine  
Under moon and overseas  
She got those and we got these  
  
Dance, dance, dance, dance  
All night long, yes all night long  
Dance, dance, dance, dance

Give yourself a chance to find a way  
The holiness for free is here to stay

He got his and she got bad  
You got mine and I've got yours  
I got love but you got more

He got his and she got shine  
We got all but she got high  
Some got hot and then gone by
