Pissing in plastic cups before we went on stage  
Playing hackey sack back when Audioslave were still Rage  
Watching all the freaky Dutch kids vomit then have sex  
Listening to techno music on the bus while we under dressed  
  
[Chorus]  
Memories make me want to go back there, back there  
All the memories make me want to go back there, back there  
All the memories, how can we make it back there, back there  
I want to be there again  
  
Messing with the journalists and telling stupid lies  
They had a feeling that something was up  
Because of the look in our eyes  
In fact we didn't know what we were doing half of the time  
We were so sure of ourselves and sure of our way of life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I got so many people that I got to look out for  
I never know when I'll become away and buy some food at the store  
I can hear them babies crying and the lawn needs to be mowed  
I gotta get my groove on 'cause I'm freakin' bored!  
  
[Chorus]
