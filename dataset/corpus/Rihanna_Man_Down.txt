I didn't mean to end his life, I know it wasn't right  
I can't even sleep at night, can't get it off my mind  
I need to get out of sight, fore I end up behind bars  
  
What started out as a simple altercation  
Turned into a real sticky situation  
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing  
Makes me wanna cry  
  
'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him  
Coulda been somebody's son  
And I took his heart when  
I pulled out that gun  
  
Rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum bum  
Man Down!  
Rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum, bum rum bum bum bum  
Man Down!  
  
Oh mama mama mama

In central station  
In front of a big ol' crowd  
Oh, why? oh, why?  
Oh mama mama mama  
I just shot a man down  
In central station  
  
Little 22, I call her Peggy Sue  
When she fits right down in my shoes  
Whatchu expect me to do? if you're playing me for a fool  
I will lose my cool, and reach for my fire arm  
  
I didn't mean to lay him down  
But its too late to turn back now  
Don't know what I was thinking  
Now he's no longer living  
So I'm bout to leave town, aye uh  
  
'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him  
Coulda been somebody's son  
And I took his heart when  
I pulled out that gun  
  
Rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum bum

Rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum, bum rum bum bum bum
