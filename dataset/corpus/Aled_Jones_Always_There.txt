When I'm less than I should be  
And I just can't face the day  
When darkness falls around me  
And I just can't find my way  
When my eyes don't clearly see  
And I stumble through it all  
You I lean upon  
You keep my strong  
And you rise me when I fall  
  
(Chorus)  
You are there when I most need you  
You are there so constantly  
You come shining through  
You always do  
You are always there for me  
  
When life brings me to my knees  
When my back's against the wall  
You are standing there right with me  
  
Just to keep me standing tall  
Though a burden I may be  
You don't weary  
You don't rest  
You are reaching out to carry me  
And I know I'm Heaven-blessed  
  
(Chorus)  
You are there when I most need you  
You are there so constantly  
You come shining through  
You always do  
You are always there for me  
  
(Chorus)  
You are there when I most need you  
You are there so constantly  
You come shining through  
You always do  
You are always there for me  
For me.
