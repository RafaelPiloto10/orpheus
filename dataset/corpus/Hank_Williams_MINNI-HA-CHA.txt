MINNI-HA-CHA  
WRITERS HANK WILLIAMS, FRED ROSE, BETTIE WESTERGARD, TOMMY COLLINS  
Minni-ha-cha was the name of the maid  
That was old Kawliga's gal  
The customer took far far away  
But Kawliga's with her now  
Minni-ha-cha  
She left a trail for ol' wooden head to find  
Now ol' Kawliga's with her all the time  
She dropped her beads along the way  
To make a trail for him  
She knew if ol Kawliga stayed her life would be so grim  
Minni-ha-cha  
How she loved that poor ol' wooden head  
The man of knotty pine with a face so red  
Minni-ha-cha  
Years have passed and now at last they got Papoose by the score  
Kawliga beats his old tom tom while she sweeps the floor  
Minni-ha-cha  
She works her fingers to the bone  
While ol' Kawliga sings an Indian song  
Minni-ha-cha  
Now you've heard the story about a wooden head affair  
An Indian with a tomahawk and a maiden with the coal black hair  
Minni-ha-cha  
They're as happy as anyone can be  
'Cause they're together and have a family  
Minni-ha-cha
