No reply  
I'm trying hard to somehow frame a reply  
Pictures, I've got pictures, and I run them in my head  
When I can't sleep at night  
Looking out at the white world and the moon  
I feel a soft exchange taking place  
Merging with the people on the brains (?)  
Whirling my face in conversation  
Slow motion  
Slow motion  
  
Hush, can you feel the trees so far away?  
Hush, can you feel the breeze of another day?  
When we held each other close in the night  
While we wheeled away in our own light  
Stepping sideways into our own time  
Such a simple way  
Slow motion  
Slow motion  
  
And we held each other close in the night  
While we wheeled away in our own light  
And some of us from another time  
And drifted away  
Slow motion  
Slow motion
