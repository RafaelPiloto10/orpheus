I've been making some enemies  
I've been taking some liberties  
Just living my life  
Try getting it right  
Lord, let me tell you  
I'm always in the doghouse  
  
I've been running right or wrong  
Always running right or wrong  
Just living my life  
Try getting it right  
Lord, let me tell you  
I'm always in the doghouse  
  
Oh my Lord  
My sweet Lord  
What have you done  
Are you ever  
Are you ever  
Are you ever gonna take me home  
  
I've been making some enemies  
I've been taking some liberties  
Just living my life  
Try getting it right  
Lord, let me tell you  
I'm always in the doghouse  
  
Just living my life  
It's been a hell of a ride  
Lord, let me tell you  
I'm always, always, always in the doghouse
