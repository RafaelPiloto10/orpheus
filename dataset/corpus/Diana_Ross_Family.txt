"Is it a beautiful day? You're beautiful!  
I mentioned earlier that the world is watching each of you.  
You make me so proud I'm the happiest woman in the world right now.  
I have a dream come true."  
"I want you to listen to me now.  
This is being televised again worldwide today.  
Just calm yourselves, come on. Alright.  
Can you feel me?  
Yes, this may be the most important moment in my life.  
There are words in this song that to me are very special Listen."  
It's more than you  
It's more than me  
No matter what we are  
We are a family  
This dream is for us  
This one can be real  
They can't stop us now  
Because of how we feel  
It's more than you  
It's more than me  
whatever dreams we have  
They're for the family  
We're not alone any more then  
There are others there  
And this dream's big enough  
For all of us to share  
So don't think you're going  
We're not going anywhere  
We're staying, taking our share  
If you get afraid again  
I'll be there  
We are a family  
Like a giant tree  
Branching out towaards the sky  
We are a family  
And so much more  
Than just you and I  
We are a family  
Like a giant tree  
Growing strong  
Growing wiser  
We are  
We are  
a family  
"I love you"
