My heart is telling me that you were gonna change, but no  
My heart is lying right to my face, yeah  
  
My heart is making up excuses for your ways, but I wish that  
My heart knew when I should walk away  
  
It lets me down, it helps me as I get back up off the ground  
You're telling me that this is love but I found, it wasn't really on my side  
Now I think it's time  
  
I tell my heart to just butt out, keep its opinion to itself  
I should just listen to my head, 'cause it's the one who knows what's best  
It tells me not to love you, but my heart says just forgive you  
Oh but it's not thinking clearly, I wish that I could leave my heart out of
this  
Leave my heart out of this  
  
I'm done feeling like a stranger to myself, so I know  
I've got to put all my feelings on a shelf, yeah  
  
It lets me down, loves me as I get back up off the ground  
You're telling me that this is love but I found, it wasn't really on my side  
Now I think it's time  
  
I tell my heart to just butt out, keep its opinion to itself  
I should just listen to my head, 'cause it's the one who knows what's best  
It tells me not to love you, but my heart says just forgive you  
Oh but it's not thinking clearly, I wish that I could leave my heart out of
this  
Leave my heart out of this  
  
Sometimes I wish you'd just shut up and let me think  
I've had enough, I need to just make up my mind (Make up my mind)  
So that's why  
  
I should just listen to my head, 'cause it's the one who knows what's best  
  
It tells me not to love you, but my heart says just forgive you  
Oh but it's not thinking clearly, I wish that I could leave my  
Leave my heart out of this  
Leave my heart out of this  
  
Le le le leave my heart  
Le le le leave my head  
No no oohhh
