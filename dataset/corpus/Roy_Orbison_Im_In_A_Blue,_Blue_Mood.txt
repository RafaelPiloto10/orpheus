I'm in a blue blue mood  
Now that you're gone away  
I'm in a blue blue mood  
It's been a lonesome day  
I'm in a blue blue mood  
I miss your caress  
I reach out to hold you  
But you're not there  
It's just my blue blue mood  
  
Maybe, someday, yeah love will come  
And stay, and things will turn  
How bright, oh oh oh but for tonight  
I'm in a blue blue mood  
  
I'm in a blue blue mood  
I'm in a blue blue mood  
I'm in a blue blue mood
