Does your conscience still say anything to you?  
You have fallen down so far from what you knew  
Its been so long that I can't believe I still remember  
Exactly how I used to be  
Its not enough  
Of what you want  
I've given up  
Its come and gone  
Its not enough  
Its not enough  
Its not enough  
You've been running from your shadow in the hall  
You've been hanging up your failure on the wall  
Its been so long that I can't believe I still remember  
Exactly how you used to be  
Its not enough  
Of what you want  
You've given up  
Its come and gone  
Not enough  
Its not enough  
Its not enough  
Its not enough
