If you want my love tell me 'bout tomorrow  
Cause I can't wait one more day  
Cold in the night waiting for a promise  
So all alone I'm hanging on  
  
Woman don't play this game  
You'll never get my lovin this way  
All this time you've been livin' for the moment  
It works for some, but not for me no  
  
[Chorus]  
It's not enough, to tell me you love me  
It's not enough, to tell me that you care (Yeah)  
It's not enough, to tell me you want me  
Darlin' you know deep inside  
If you want my love, then girl you must show me  
(Not enough) Oh show me girl  
  
We can make it last if we hold on till tomorrow  
Or will we throw it away  
Empty words you say you want to please me  
But half a heart won't make it right  
  
It's not enough to tell me you love me  
It's not enough to tell me that you cried (Yeah)  
It's not enough to tell me you're sorry  
Darlin' you know deep inside  
If you want my love, then girl you must show me  
(Not enough)  
  
Empty words you say you want to please me  
But half a heart won't make it right no  
  
It's not enough to tell me you love me  
It's not enough to tell me that you care (Yeah)  
It's not enough to tell me you want me  
Darlin' you know  
Not enough to tell me you need me  
It's not enough to tell me that you cried (Yeah)  
It's not enough to tell me you're sorry  
Darlin' you know deep inside  
It's just not enough (Not enough)  
  
Oh, if you really want to know girl (Not enough)  
What it takes if you want my love
