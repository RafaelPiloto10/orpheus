All my friends have someone  
I need someone too  
Someone to hold the whole night through  
  
I need a lover  
someone like you  
Someone to make my dreams come true  
  
Maybe if I close my eyes  
Everything will be alright  
Cause I don't wanna be alone  
No more, baby  
  
Chorus:  
I want some  
I need some  
anybody, somebody  
Someone custom built for me  
I want some  
I need some  
Whole lotta lovin' satisfaction guaranteed  
  
I wake in the morning  
And wrap my arms around no one  
But that no one could be someone meant for me  
  
So I jump out of my bed  
And throw my hands on my head  
And scream I need a lover just for me  
  
Maybe if I close my eyes  
Everything will be alright  
Cause I don't wanna be alone  
I know that baby  
  
Chorus, solo, chorus out
