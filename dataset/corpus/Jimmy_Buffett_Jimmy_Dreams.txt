Verse  
JIMMY DREAMS HE'S A CHILD TILL THE END  
WHAT A JOY WHEN YOU ARE YOUR BEST FRIEND  
THE WORLD'S SUCH A TOY  
IF YOU'LL JUST STAY A BOY  
YOU CAN SPIN IT AGAIN AND AGAIN  
  
JIMMY FLIES WITH NO USE FOR DISGUISE  
JUST ESCAPES USING MIRRORS AND CAPES  
AND THE WORDS DO THE TRICK  
THERE IS NO BIGGER KICK  
THAN JUST RHYMING AGAIN AND AGAIN  
  
Bridge  
IT'S THE SOUND OF THE LOW TIDE,  
THE SMELL OF THE RAIN  
TRAVELIN' ALONE  
ON MY BOAT AND MY PLANE  
TAKE IT ALL IN IT'S AS BIG AS IT SEEMS  
COUNT ALL YOUR BLESSINGS  
REMEMBER YOUR DREAMS  
  
Verse  
JIMMY STARES TOWARD THE BRIGHT PLEIADES  
IT'S SO STRANGE  
WHAT HIS DISTANT EYE SEES  
WHO KNOW WHY YOU START  
RE-DISCOVERING YOUR HEART  
BUT YOU DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN  
  
THE SOUND OF THE LOW TIDE,  
THE SMELL OF THE RAIN  
TRAVELIN' ALONE  
ON MY BOAT AND MY PLANE  
TAKE IT ALL IN IT'S AS BIG AS IT SEEMS  
COUNT ALL YOUR BLESSINGS  
REMEMBER YOUR DREAMS  
  
Verse  
JIMMY STARES TOWARD THE BRIGHT PLEIADES  
IT'S SO STRANGE  
WHAT HIS DISTANT EYE SEES  
WHO KNOWS WHY YOU START  
RE-DISCOVERING YOUR HEART  
BUT YOU DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN  
THE WORLDS STILL A TOY  
IF YOU JUST STAY A BOY  
AND THAT'S WHY JIMMY DREAMS
