Written by Kirk Franklin  
CHORUS  
It really doesn't matter  
What you're going through  
I know that Jesus can work it out for you  
His yoke is easy, and His burden light  
Just give it to Jesus  
He'll make it alright  
He can handle it  
He can handle it  
Repeat  
He can handle it  
There's no doubt about my savior  
I know He will deliver  
He can handle it  
There's no doubt about my savior  
I know He will deliver  
Whatever it is  
He can handle it  
Repeat  
He can (4x's)  
Repeat  
He can  
Handle it  
He can  
If you know He can say yes  
Yes!  
Repeat 2x's
