Intro:  
March along, sing our song, with the Army of the free  
Count the brave, count the true, who have fought to victory  
We're the Army and proud of our name  
We're the Army and proudly proclaim  
  
First to fight for the right,  
And to build the Nation's might,  
And The Army Goes Rolling Along  
Proud of all we have done,  
Fighting till the battle's won,  
And the Army Goes Rolling Along.  
  
Then it's Hi! Hi! Hey!  
The Army's on it's way.  
Count off the cadence loud and strong (Two! Three!)  
For where e'er we go,  
You will always know  
That The Army Goes Rolling Along.  
  
Valley Forge, Custer's ranks,  
San Juan Hill and Patton's tanks,  
And the Army went rolling along  
Minute men, from the start,  
Always fighting from the heart,  
And the Army keeps rolling along.  
  
Then it's Hi! Hi! Hey!  
The Army's on it's way.  
Count off the cadence loud and strong (Two! Three!)  
For where e'er we go,  
You will always know  
That The Army Goes Rolling Along.  
  
Men in rags, men who froze,  
Still that Army met it's foes,  
And the Army went rolling along.  
Faith in God, then we're right,  
And we'll fight with all our might,  
As the Army keeps rolling along.  
  
Then it's Hi! Hi! Hey!  
The Army's on it's way.  
Count off the cadence loud and strong (Two! Three!)  
For where e'er we go,  
You will always know  
That The Army Goes Rolling Along.
