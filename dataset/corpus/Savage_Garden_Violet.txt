If there's a way that you could  
Be everything you want to be  
Would you complain that it came too easy?  
Just like the games with you and me  
A resolution hard to see  
But that's OK 'cause I don't  
See things that are plain to see  
  
I've got a dream to take you over  
Exploding like a supernova  
I'm gonna crash into your world  
And that's no lie  
  
You want to give ecstasy delivered  
With certainty  
But you're afraid that the pleasure  
Won't be needed  
In a way, we're the same two people  
Looking out to sea  
For a wave that would carry all our fantasies  
  
If there's a way to infiltrate you  
Sway your mind and complicate you  
I'm gonna crash into your world  
And that's no lie  
  
Let your body move into the doorway  
To the disco inside your head (Violet)  
Wear a color that you want to cling to  
The color inside your head (Violet)  
  
Contemplate jealousy intermixed  
With urgency  
A million things take a damned  
Good shot at you and me  
  
If there's a way to infiltrate you  
Sway your mind and complicate you  
I'm gonna crash into your world  
And that's no lie  
  
Let your body move into the doorway  
To the disco inside your head (Violet)  
Wear a color that you want to cling to  
The color inside your head (Violet)  
  
I'm gonna take you  
I'll do my best to break you  
I'm gonna take you higher  
And that's no lie  
  
Common sense is a game many  
People don't like to play  
But give it in and the moment takes  
You either way  
  
I've got a dream to take you over  
Exploding like a supernova  
I'm gonna crash into your world  
And that's no lie  
  
Let your body move into the doorway  
To the disco inside your head (Violet)  
Wear a color that you want to cling to  
The color inside your head (Violet)  
  
If there's a way that you could  
Be everything you want to be,  
Would you complain that it came too easy?  
In a way, we're the same two people  
Looking out to sea  
For a wave that would carry all our fantasies
