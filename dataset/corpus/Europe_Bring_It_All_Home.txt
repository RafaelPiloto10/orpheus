It's curtain call  
Guess you can't outrun  
All the truth  
  
We've staggered on  
With broken parts  
Like you do  
  
But it's alright, thrills will fade  
We've had some good laughs on the way  
Thank you for coming along  
To bring it all home  
  
Well, I'd take them back  
Those early years  
Oh anytime  
  
As we make our beds  
We get to shine  
Once in a while  
  
But it's alright, thrills will fade  
We've had some good laughs on the way  
Thank you for coming along  
To bring it all home  
  
It's alright, thrills will fade  
We've had some good laughs along the way  
Thank you for coming along  
Bring it all home  
Thank you for coming along  
Let's bring it all home
