Back in Wilson High  
I had two best friends  
They lived down the block  
Where Eagle Court bends  
One she cared for my bones  
Fed me ice cream cones  
One she cared for my happiness  
Wouldn't leave me alone  
  
Back in Wilson High  
Said I had these two best friends  
Till the school bus came  
And took my friends away  
Now I'm left alone at home  
To sit and think all day  
  
Hear you me, Mykel  
Hear you me, Carli  
  
They gave me a hat  
The hat was awful rad  
Wore it every day  
Made my teacher mad  
She tore it off my head  
Now my head's well-read  
My head gets cold at night sometimes  
But I can't be misled  
  
Hear you me, Mykel  
Hear you me, Carli
