Just don't know any more  
  
But think of what you're saying I really think you should  
You'd better stop complaining it won't do you any good  
You know you should have done the right thing  
When you drew your master plan  
But little by little I'll try to make you understand  
Little by little

Got so far from the shore  
  
You're one in a million, if you could only see  
You've less than perfect vision can't see the woods before the trees  
Gonna to shake you till your bell rings, you're like a ship that's lost at sea  
But little by little I'm going to bring you back to me  
Little by little I'm gonna to bring you back to me  
  
Well you gotta get back home  
(You gotta get back home)  
Cause you gotta change your ways  
(You gotta change your ways)  
Can't do it all alone  
(Can't do it all alone)  
Cause you've got too much at stake  
(You've got too much at stake)  
So get to it right away  
Ooh woah woaah  
  
I'm going to set out on a rescue until this mission is complete  
Oh yes you know I'm going to get you, I'll make you listen to my plea  
Ah yeah you thought the grass was greener but then it didn't prove to be  
But little by little  
I'm going to bring you back to me  
Little by little  
I'm going to bring you back to me  
  
Well little by little
