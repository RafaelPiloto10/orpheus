Oh I love those Colorado Rockies  
And that big starry Montana sky  
And the lights of San Francisco  
On a California night  
Enjoyed those ballgames in Chicago  
On those windy afternoons  
It' s a big beautiful country  
But I' m never home too soon  
If it ain' t Dixie, it won' t do  
  
If it ain' t Dixie it don' t feel quite like home  
My southern blood runs deep and true  
I' ve had good times  
North of the line  
I' ve got a lot of good friends too  
But if it ain' t Dixie, it won' t do  
It won' t do  
  
When the leaves turn in New England  
I love the chill that' s in the air  
I' ve walked the New York City sidewalks  
Had a big time in Times Square  
But now my wheels are rollin' southward  
And heaven' s comin' into view  
Home-sweet-home is Alabama  
That' s what I look forward to  
  
If it ain' t Dixie it don' t feel quite like home  
My southern blood runs deep and true  
I' ve had good times  
North of the line  
I' ve got a lot of good friends too  
If it ain' t Dixie, it won' t do  
It won' t do  
  
If it ain' t Dixie  
Oh no, Oh no-whoah  
  
Now my wheels are rollin' southward  
And heaven' s comin' into view  
Home-sweet-home is Alabama  
That' s what I look forward to  
  
Y' all come to Dixie...
