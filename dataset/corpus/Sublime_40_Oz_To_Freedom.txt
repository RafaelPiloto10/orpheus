You've got your hair permed  
You've got your red dress on  
Screamin' that second gear was such a turn on  
And the fog forming on my window tells me that the morning here  
And you'll be gone before too long  
  
Who taught you those new tricks?  
Damn I shouldn't start that talk,  
but life is one big question when your starin' at the clock  
And the answers always waiting at the liquor store, 40 oz to Freedom,  
so I'll take that walk.  
  
And I know that ohhhh, I'm not comin' back  
Oh not going back  
God knows not going back  
  
You look so fine when you lie it just don't show,  
That I know which way the wind blows  
40 oz to freedom is the only chance I have to feel good,  
Even though I feel bad  
  
And I know that oh, I'm not comin' back  
Oh not going back  
God knows I'm not going back  
God knows I'm not going back
