Primitive love, I want what it used to be  
Primitive love, no more in love, it's all a hustle  
What's done is done, now it's my turn to have some fun  
You're much too sly, don't give me alibis  
I don't wanna know, I don't want to know  
Primitive love  
I want what it used to be, I want it  
Primitive love, primitive love  
I want what it used to be  
I want what it used to be  
Primitive love I want, I need, primitive love  
Don't have to arrange, I don't want your money  
I don't have to think, right now you've got me at the brink  
This is goodbye for all the times I cried  
Don't want no more, don't want no more  
Primitive love  
I want what it used to be, I want it  
Primitive love, primitive love  
I want what it used to be  
I want what it used to be  
Primitive love I want, I need, primitive love  
Is it right or is it wrong  
Primitive drums call me backward into stone  
Pack up and leave, I'm not yours to deceive  
Don't want you no more, don't want you no more  
Primitive love  
I want what it used to be, I want it  
Primitive love, primitive love  
I want what it used to be  
I want what it used to be  
Primitive love I want, I need, primitive love  
Primitive love, primitive love, primitive love
