This lovely day will lengthen into evening  
We'll sigh good-bye to all we've ever had  
Alone where we have walked together  
I'll remember April and be glad  
  
I'll be content, you loved me once in April  
Your lips were warm, and love an' spring were new  
But I'm not afraid of autumn, and her sorrow  
For I'll remember, (I'll remember)  
April and you! (I'll remember)  
  
The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes  
For flames and love live such a little while  
I won't forget, but I won't be lonely (Oh, no)  
I'll remember April, and I'll smile  
  
The fire will dwindle into glowing ashes  
For flames and love live such a little while (a little while)  
  
I won't forget, but I won't be lonely (I won't be lonely)  
I'll remember April, and I'll smile  
  
I won't forget but I won't be lonely, no  
I'll remember April, and I'll smile!  
  
This lovely day will fade away
