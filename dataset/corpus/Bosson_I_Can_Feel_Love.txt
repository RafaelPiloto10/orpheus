(I feel love)  
  
I couldn't believe, it happened to me  
You knocked me away  
So close to my heart, don't know who you are  
So sudden but maybe too far  
How could I believe it  
Finding us here where we are  
I still don't know who you are  
  
I can feel love, I can feel love in your eyes  
I'm finding my way to your heart  
I can feel love in my mind  
And it doesn't matter whatever you're saying  
In everything you show me I feel love  
  
So much I have seen, so far I have been  
But never so close  
So deep in my soul, so much I've been told  
That love is a heartbreaking game  
How can I believe it  
Finding us here where we are  
I've never been so far  
  
I can feel love.I can feel love in your eyes  
I'm finding my way to your heart  
I can feel love in my mind  
And it doesn't matter whatever you're saying  
In everything you show me I feel love  
  
And I know deep in my heart  
Nothing could ever bring me down  
When you feel love, you know who you are  
It's moving you on and on  
  
I can feel love.I can feel love in your eyes  
I'm finding my way to your heart  
I can feel love in my mind  
And it doesn't matter whatever you're saying  
In everything you show me I feel love
