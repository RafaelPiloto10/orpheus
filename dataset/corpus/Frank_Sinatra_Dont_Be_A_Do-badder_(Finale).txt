Take it from me, don't be a do-badder up,  
Do-badder up, do bother to put your foot up.  
That ladder that leads you to that place.  
Below and every day you lose other you.  
Feel sadder you get madder so use the other.  
Step ladder you climb the other way.  
Scrapping and fighting, scratching and fighting,  
Cheating and acting. selfish makes your heart.  
Like a part of the hardest heart, so selfish.  
Take it from me, don't you be a do-badder up,  
A do-badder up, a do-badder up, just step up for that.  
Step ladder and climb the other way.  
(Larry: What the hell does all this nonsense talk mean?)
