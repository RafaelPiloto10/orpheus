[Mario:]  
I Could Tell How You Doubted Me  
I Knew My Heart Was Broken  
And So Empty  
Even Though My Girl Was Next To Me  
She Didn't See  
I Do Believe  
That You Wanna Come By  
Rescue Me  
If You Read My Mind  
I Have Set You A Place  
I Wonder If I'll Just Will Be  
In Time We'll See  
She Told Me  
  
She Told Me  
She Showed Me  
But She Hurt Me  
Yet She Loved Me The Same  
Has Anybody Ever Made You Feel That Way?  
Could You Really Love Her Through The Pain?  
  
[Diddy:]  
...Yeah  
Well I Don't Wanna Feel This Way ( This Way )  
I Got Too Many Bills To Pay ( To Pay )  
I'm Hanging On Patrone All Day ( Aye )  
Mind In A Maze ( Maze)  
Blowing On Shit  
I Can't Function  
It Gotta Be Something ( Go Ahead )  
That You Doing  
That Got Me Unconscious ( Aye)  
All This Money This Fame This Fire  
How Could I Feel This Empty Inside? ( Talk To 'Em)  
  
[Mario:]  
I've Been Thinking 'Bout Giving Up ( Can't Give Up)  
But There's Something Inside Me That's Holding On  
When We Don't Know Who's Right Or Wrong  
We Still Stay Strong  
Keep Movin' On ( Don't Stop )  
And I Promise I Will Never Leave  
Now Would You Do The Same For Me?  
I Wonder If I'll Just Will Be  
In Time We'll See  
She Told Me  
  
She Told Me  
She Showed Me  
But She Hurt Me  
Yet She Loved Me The Same  
Has Anybody Ever Made You Feel That Way?  
Could You Really Love Her Through The Pain?  
  
[Diddy:]  
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah  
Fine As Hell  
Fly Chanel ( So Fly )  
But Will It Last?  
Only Time Will Tell ( Only Time )  
Love Is Real  
And What I Mean Is  
There's Not Enough Words To Explain The Meaning ( C'mon )  
And What I'm Saying Is  
All I Need Is For You To Understand  
How Beautiful She Is ( She Is )  
And All It Takes Is A Little Faith  
And No Matter The Situation  
Is My Heart You'll Stay  
  
[Mario:]  
I'll Always Be Your Friend  
You'll Always Be My Girl ( I'll Always Love You)  
I'll Never Let It End  
For Nothing In The World ( You'll Never Stop Me )  
'Cause No One Else Can Do  
The Things You Do ( No One Else Do The Things )  
You Make Me Feel ( You Make Me Feel )  
So Warm And New  
So Would You Stay With Me? ( She Told Me )  
  
She Told Me ( She Showed Me )  
She Showed Me ( But She Hurt )  
But She Hurt Me ( Yet She Loved Me )  
Yet She Loved Me The Same ( All The Same )  
Has Anybody Ever Made You Feel That Way? ( Has Anybody...Ever Made You Feel
That Way? )  
Could You Really Love Her Through The Pain? ( Could You? )  
  
Thank You For Showing Me How To Love  
Thank You For Showing Me  
  
Girl You Mean The World To Me  
Just A Little More Than I Can See  
Breaks Us Down  
We'd Stay Together  
Only We Can Hustle Who Ever  
Would You Come And Go With Me  
To Fulfilled Our Fantasies  
Take Me By My Hand My Dear  
Promise Me You Won't Have No Fear  
  
She Told Me ( She Showed Me )  
She Showed Me ( But She Hurt Me )
