Here we go sailin' low  
Bet your mom and pop, baby, will never know  
We're steppin' by the river  
Where the woodchucks go  
Down by the Yukon Railroad  
  
When the sun come up, we go down  
You can have your partner  
And you're foolin' around  
Spendin' my time on the open ground  
Down by the Yukon Railroad  
  
You can bring a bottle  
And we'll drink it on the track  
Baby never comin' back  
Well I can just imagine  
About a hundred years ago  
Old Number 7  
Just a steamin' on to heaven  
With it's twenty cars a rockin' in tow  
Bringin' on the payroll  
  
Here comes the sun now, we're havin' fun  
You and me together baby, are number one  
I can feel another day's just begun  
Thanks to the Yukon Railroad

With it's twenty cars a rockin' in tow  
Bringin' on the payroll  
  
Yeah  
  
Well here we go, sailin' low  
Bet your mom and pop, baby, will never know  
Steppin' by the river  
Where the woodchucks go  
Down by the Yukon Railroad  
Thanks to the Yukon Railroad  
We love the Yukon Railroad
