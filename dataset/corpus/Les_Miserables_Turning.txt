[The women of Paris mourn their lost loved ones.]  
  
Women  
Did you see them  
Going off to fight?  
Children of the barricade  
Who didn't last the night?  
Did you see them  
Lying where they died?  
Someone used to cradle them  
And kiss them when they cried.  
Did you see them  
Lying side by side?  
  
Who will wake them?  
No one ever will.  
No one ever told them  
That a summer day can kill.  
They were schoolboys  
Never held a gun  
Fighting for a new world  
That would rise up like the sun  
Where's that new world  
Now the fighting's done?  
  
Nothing changes, nothing ever will  
Every year another brat, another mouth to fill.  
Same old story, what's the use of tears?  
What's the use of praying if there's nobody who hears?  
Turning, turning, turning, turning, turning  
Through the years.  
  
Turning, turning, turning through the years  
Minutes into hours and the hours into years.  
Nothing changes, nothing ever can  
Round and round the roundabout and back where you began!  
Round and round and back where you began!
