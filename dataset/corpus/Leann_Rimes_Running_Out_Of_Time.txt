I'm sittin' on my porch  
And watchin' the flowers bloom  
I walk through my front door  
Everything is perfect in every room  
But something's wrong 'round here  
I'm always fighting back the tears  
And even when you come home  
I still feel all alone  
  
I need you to find me  
I'm the one you left behind  
I want you to see me  
'cause we're running out of time  
  
You made it look so pretty  
Such a beautiful family, such wonderful friends  
But how we're going so dirty  
I don't know what's real  
'cause it all feels pretend  
But something's missing here  
I'm always drowning in my fears  
I've gotta take care of myself  
Before there's left  
  
I need you to find me  
I'm the one you left behind  
I want you to see me  
'cause we're running out of time  
  
I'm more than just a pretty face  
I'm more than just your wife  
I have my hopes and my dreams too  
This is our song, my love  
I need you  
I want you  
'cause we're running out of time  
  
I have my hopes and my dreams too, yeah  
This is our song, my love  
  
I need you to find me  
I'm the one you left behind  
I want you to see me  
'cause we're running out of time  
  
I need you, find me  
I have no where left to hide  
I want you to see me  
'cause we're running out of time.
