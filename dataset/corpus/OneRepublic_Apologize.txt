I'm holding on your rope  
Got me ten feet off the ground  
And I'm hearing what you say  
But I just can't make a sound  
  
You tell me that you need me  
Then you go and cut me down, but wait  
You tell me that you're sorry  
Didn't think I'd turn around and say  
  
That it's too late to apologize, it's too late  
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late  
Too late, oh  
  
I'd take another chance, take a fall  
Take a shot for you  
And I need you like a heart needs a beat  
But it's nothing new, yeah yeah  
  
I loved you with a fire red, now it's turning blue  
And you say sorry like the angel  
Heaven let me think was you  
But I'm afraid  
  
It's too late to apologize, it's too late  
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late, whoa whoa  
  
It's too late to apologize, it's too late  
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late  
  
I said it's too late to apologize, yeah, too late  
I said it's too late to apologize, yeah, too late  
  
I'm holding on your rope  
Got me ten feet off the ground
