You've got the money, I've got the time  
You want your freedom, make your freedom mine  
'Cause I've got the style it takes  
and money is all that it takes  
You've got connections and I've got the art  
You like my attention and I like your looks  
and I have the style it take  
and you know the people it takes  
Why don't you sit right over there, we'll do a movie portrait  
I'll turn the camera on and I won't even be there  
A portrait that moves, you look great I think  
I'll put the Empire State Building on your wall  
Watch the sun rise above it in your room  
Wallpaper art, a great view  
I've got a Brillo box and I say it's art  
It's the same one you can buy at any supermarket  
'Cause I've got the style it takes  
And you've got the people it takes  
This is a rock group called The Velvet Underground  
I show movies on them  
Do you like their sound  
'Cause they have a style that grates and I have art to make  
Let's do a movie here next week  
We don't have sound but you're so great  
You don't have to speak  
You've got the style it takes (Kiss)  
You've got the style it takes (Eat)  
I've got the style it takes (Couch)  
We've got the style it takes (Kiss)
