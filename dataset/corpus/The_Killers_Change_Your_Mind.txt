Racy days  
Help me through the hopeless haze  
But my oh my  
Tragic eyes  
I can't even recognize myself behind  
So if the answer is no  
Can I change your mind  
  
Out again, a siren screams at half past ten  
And you won't let go  
While I ignore, that we both felt like this  
Before it starts to show  
So if I had a chance  
Would you let me know  
  
Why aren't you shaking  
Step back in time  
Graciously taking  
Oh your too kind  
  
And if the answer is no  
Can I change your mind  
  
We're all the same  
And love is blind  
The sun is gone  
Before it shines  
  
And I said if the answer is no  
Can I change your mind
