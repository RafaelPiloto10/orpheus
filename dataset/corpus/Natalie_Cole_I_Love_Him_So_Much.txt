Today we broke up, tomorrow we'll make up  
And again he'll hang up on me  
But you see I know he'll never hurt me  
I know he'll never desert me  
And so I just say that's my man anyway  
Tonight we'll love plenty, tomorrow maybe not any  
But I'm sure he'll come through just in time  
And to me he's more than just a man  
He's my life so I understand why things has got to be his way  
And I love him so much, so much 'til it hurts me  
Yes, I do, so much, so much 'til it hurts me  
He makes me cry when I wanna laugh sometimes  
His moods, they keep changing all the time  
But I know just where his head is when it's not laying on top of mine  
His world is not so different and you may not believe  
But I'm sure you'd understand him if you were me  
And that's why this world can't look and frown  
But I'll never let him down  
That is my man and he means the world to me  
And I love him so much, so much 'til it hurts me  
Yes, I love him so much, so much 'til it hurts me  
Oh (so much, so much 'til it hurts me)  
I love him so (so much, so much 'til it hurts me) much  
So much, so much--
