Give a little bit  
Give a little bit of your love to me  
Give a little bit  
I'll give a little bit of my love to you  
There's so much that we need to share  
Send a smile and show you care  
  
I'll give a little bit  
I'll give a little bit of my life for you  
So give a little bit  
Give a little bit of your time to me  
See the man with the lonely eyes  
Take his hand, you'll be surprised  
  
Give a little bit  
Give a little bit of your love to me  
I'll give a little bit of my life for you  
Now's the time that we need to share  
So find yourself, we're on our way back home  
  
Going home  
Don't you need to feel at home  
Oh yeah, we gotta sing
