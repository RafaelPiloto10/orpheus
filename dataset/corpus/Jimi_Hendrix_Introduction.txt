"lady's and gentlemen, the Jimi Hendrix experience."  
  
[Jimi]  
"I see that we meet again hmmm. yeah well, well, well. dig,  
Dig, I'd like to get something strait, we umm we got tired  
Of the experience, and every once in a while we're blowing  
Our minds too much, so we decided to change everything around.  
And a call it 'gypsy sons and rainbows' for short nothin' but  
A band of gypsies. we have billy cox playin' bass, and um from  
Nashville Tennessee we have lary lee playin' guitar over there,  
We got juma playin' congos over there, juma, and we have granny  
Goose, oh I'm sorry Mitch Mitchell on drums over there, and we  
Got jerry velez on congos too. you got yours truly on Pete Whistle,  
What me worry? gives us about a minute and a half to tune up ok.  
Like we only had about two rehearsals so a we'll only do a primary  
Rhythm thing. (someone in the background) I have mine thank you  
I have mine thank you, baby."
