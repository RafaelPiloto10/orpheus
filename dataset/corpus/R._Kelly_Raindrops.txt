Can you hear the sounds of the love angels calling us  
Sweet violins,and harps playing  
Then suddenly there's this kiss of trust  
Damper than the morning dew,tonight has chosen me and you  
And girl I vow to make everyone of your fantasies come true  
  
I can here the horns sounding,  
Bells ringing a full orchestra  
And the choir singing  
The oceans calm and the rivers flowing  
It feels so good, keep on going.  
  
Rain drops keep fallin' on our heads,as we make love  
We won't stop the rain keeps fallin' down on both of us.  
Rain drops keep fallin' on our heads, as we make love  
We won't stop the rain keeps fallin' down on both of us.  
  
Can you see the flowers blooming,slowly as the seasons change,  
The gift of joy is found in when I softly here you call my name  
Rose pedals, and all these oils, surrounded by a hundred candles,  
The eagle delivers a letter, that says this night will last forever.  
  
Damper than the morning dew,the night has chosen me and you  
And girl I promise to make everyone of your fantasies come tru  
  
I can here the horns sounding, bells ringing a full orchestra  
And the choir singing.the oceans calm and the rivers flowing  
Don't you stop, just keep on going.  
  
Rain drops keep fallin' on our heads,as we make love  
We won't stop the rain keeps fallin' down on both of us.  
Rain drops keep fallin' on our heads, as we make love  
We won't stop the rain keeps fallin' down on both of us.  
  
Through all the trees, the smooth wind blows,then suddenly a rainbow  
An ocean filled with white sail boats and huge waterfalls that overflow  
? and fairy tales  
?  
And imagine far away from here,  
Where the land cry's joyful tears,  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Rain drops keep fallin' on our heads,as we make love  
We won't stop the rain keeps fallin' down on both of us.  
Rain drops keep fallin' on our heads,as we make love  
We won't stop the rain keeps fallin' down on both of us.
