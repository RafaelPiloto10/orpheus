Na, na, na, na, na  
Na, na, na, na, na  
  
Ain't got a damn [?] your last thing may change  
Get to your Virgo, to feel you I could change  
[?] I know he wanted fame  
You stay there, I gotta a problem, man  
I gotta fix this like we're in plan,  
I still sip [?] follow no trance, beyond verse, that's beyond thoughts  
I just say it hoe, this is my fault, my fault, my better need the [?]  
Computer love [?] she's rocking that [?]  
Smell like living, at least [?] cause I got a good feeling,  
Gotta get your girl, cause your [?] got willing  
My dream girl!  
  
So I got to get you, I can't let you get away from,  
I can't let you get away from me!  
I gotta get you!  
I got to get you, I can't let you get away from,  
I can't let you get away!  
I can't let you get away!  
Oh Canada, oh Canada!  
  
I notice my cookies don't crumble,  
What's up is got me on form Toronto  
My favorite [?] no stereo  
You know it, is falling  
Our bigger first day in New York  
Pardon [?] said I look like a [?] boss  
Deserve double lubba tons I bought  
I pray [?] to get me to the Lord  
But I ran now, just what I respect  
Not a hand down, not one for the jealousy  
I'm a [?] eleven seven, seven six, but I'm [?]  
So random, you're the atom,  
Don't let it be, spread like cancer [?]
