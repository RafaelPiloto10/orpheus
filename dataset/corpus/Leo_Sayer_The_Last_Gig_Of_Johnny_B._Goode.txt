He pleads to his manager  
There just seems to be no way out  
Have one last cigarette  
No time to put it out  
He's quitting this time for good  
This is the last gig for Johnny B. Goode  
And now the pressure's really on  
Black limousines close in  
His hotel suite is really neat  
But the flight nearly did him in  
A telegram said break a leg  
But the doctor says he's broken his head  
Set up the amps  
Play it loud  
So no one can hear the words  
Good job  
They wouldn't want to hang around  
Set up the lights  
But keep 'em dim  
So no one will see him in  
The state that he's in  
Ladies and gentlemen  
Will you welcome for the last time  
A man who if he could help it  
Would not be here tonight  
The man who has nothing left to prove  
Bye bye Johnny B. Goode  
The agent's looking restless  
He says this house is awful bad  
He said we should have booked the audience  
Rather than booked the band  
He's quitting this time for good  
Because they won't turn up for Johnny B. Goode
