It's my party and I'll cry if I want to  
Cry if I want to  
Cry if I want to  
You would cry too if it's happened to you  
Nobody knows where my johnny has gone  
But Judy left the same time  
Why was he holding her hand  
When he's supposed to be mine  
  
Play all my records keep dancing all night  
But leave me alone for a while  
'Till johnny's dancing with me  
I've got no reason to smile  
  
Judy and johnny just walked through that door  
Like a queen with her king  
Oh what a birthday surprise  
Judy's wearing his ring
