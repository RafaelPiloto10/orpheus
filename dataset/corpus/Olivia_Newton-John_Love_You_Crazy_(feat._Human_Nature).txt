Watching the shadow dance  
Reflected in your eyes  
Open up and take a chance - talk to me  
Don't hold everything inside  
And if you want me say  
Hold me now - hold me now  
And it's ok to say - please hold me now  
  
Lay your head down in my arms  
Whispering my name  
Go ahead and fall asleep  
Dream the night away  
  
I love you right - I love you wrong  
I love you weak - I love you strong  
I love you crazy everyday and all night long  
I share your joy - I'll ease your pain  
I'll take your sunshine and your rain  
Oh my baby - I love you crazy  
  
My hands are innocent - my arms are open wide  
There's nothing to fight against  
I'll help you thru the stone cold night  
And if you feel afraid - reach for me - reach for me now  
Cause I can't stand the wait - reach for me now  
  
I'll be here when you awake  
Whispering your name  
Here's a promise I will make  
My love will never change  
  
I love you right - I love you wrong  
I love you weak - I love you strong  
I love you crazy everyday and all night long  
I share your joy - I'll ease your pain  
I'll take your sunshine and your rain  
Oh my baby  
  
I love you crazy high and crazy low  
More than you will ever know  
I will love you crazy all my life  
I love you right  
I love wrong  
I love you weak  
I love you strong  
  
I love you right - I love you wrong  
I love you weak - I love you strong  
I love you crazy everyday and all night long  
I share your joy - I'll ease your pain  
I'll take your sunshine and your rain  
Oh my baby - I love you crazy
