I saw her dancing, dancing  
In some old smokey place  
I bet I was the only one there to watch her face  
  
All night I never saw a smile there  
'Cause she didn't even try  
You know for just a little while there  
I saw a tear in her eyes  
  
[Come on  
Come on baby I love to see you now  
Ou wi  
One more time baby watch me swinging, huh]  
  
I sit and watch her on the floor  
I said baby, baby, baby  
Come on baby just dance some more  
  
I wonder how it is to love her  
I toss it to her in my head  
The way she dance to the music  
She got me going out of my head  
  
[Come on  
Watch  
One more time you fine foxy thing you  
Uh, yeah ]  
  
One more time just watch she do  
She do this  
  
Huh  
She walk the mellow-man a little bit  
Then she skate a little bit  
Then she boog a little bit  
Then she twist a little bit  
I gotta  
  
One more time  
I got to see her on the floor, now, now  
Gotta, gotta  
I gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta see her now, now  
One more time  
Sweet little thing, sweet little thing, sweet little thing  
You sweet little  
Come on, watch that, yeah, yeah, yeah...
