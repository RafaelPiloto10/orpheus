I'm goin' to Kansas City Kansas City here I come  
Got some crazy little fellows and I'm a gonna get me one  
I'm gonna be standin' in the corner 12th street in line  
I'm gonna be standin' in the corner 12th street in line  
With my Kansas City baby and my bottle of Kansas City wine  
Well I may take a train I might take a plane  
But if I have to walk I'm gonna be just the same  
I'm goin' to Kansas City Kansas City here I come  
Got some crazy little fellows and I'm a gonna get me one  
  
I'm gonna be standin' in the corner...  
Well if I don't have this man I know I'm gonna die  
Gotta find a brand new baby and that's the reason why  
I'm goin' to Kansas City Kansas City here I come  
Got some crazy little fellows and I'm a gonna get me one  
Got some crazy little fellows and I'm a gonna get me one  
Got some crazy little fellows and I'm a gonna get me one  
Got some crazy little fellows and I'm a gonna get me one just one
