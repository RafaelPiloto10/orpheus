Since you've been away  
I've been down and lonely  
Since you've been away  
I've been thinking of you  
Trying to understand  
The reason you left me  
What were you going through?  
  
I'm missing you  
Tell me why the road turns  
Ooh ooh  
I'm missing you  
Tell me why the road turns  
  
As i look around  
I see things that remind me  
Just to see you smile  
Made my heart fill with joy  
I'll still recall  
All those dreams we shared together  
Where did you run to, boy?  
  
I'm missing you  
Tell me why the road turns  
Ooh ooh  
I'm missing you  
Tell me why the road turns  
  
Sometimes i've wondered  
I didn't understand  
Just where you were trying to go  
Only you knew the plan  
And i tried to be there  
But you wouldn't let me in  
  
But now you've gone away boy  
I feel so broken hearted  
I knew the day we started  
That we were meant to be  
If only you'd let me!  
I've cried so many tears  
Gotta face now all my fears  
We let time slip away  
I need you boy  
Here today!  
  
There was so much you gave me  
To my heart  
To my soul  
There was so much of your dreams  
That were never told  
You had so much hope  
For a brighter day  
Why were you my flower  
Plucked away  
  
I'm missing you  
Tell me why the road turns  
Ooh ooh  
I'm missing you  
Tell me why the road turns
