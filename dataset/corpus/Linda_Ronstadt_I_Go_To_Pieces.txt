I've been wrong  
I've been of no use  
I wander these streets alone  
Heard every excuse  
I go to pieces  
Why don't you  
Get carried away  
I go to pieces  
Why don't you  
  
I've know all about  
The pain I've caused you  
I wish I could run away  
What else can I do  
Cause I go to pieces  
Why don't you  
Stick in my side  
I go to pieces  
Why don't you  
Hear anything that I say  
Watching you drifting away  
  
I've known all about  
Love I've refused  
I tried to hide you away  
Ain't no use  
I go to pieces  
Why don't you  
Know what it means  
I go to pieces  
Why don't you  
Get carried away  
I go to pieces  
Why don't you  
Why don't you  
Why don't you
