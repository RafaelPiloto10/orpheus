If you've got a heartache  
Of the kind that will not pass by  
Even if you don't see the end  
Of what lies around the bend  
Don't stay that way  
It's all in a day believe me  
Even the best of dreams must end  
Even so it grieves me  
Stay loose, don't fight it  
Let it take you all the way and  
If it's wrong, you will right it  
Do not waste these hours away  
How many times have I told you  
These are the tears I've shed  
Could it be that I need help  
Is it maybe I've come undone  
And one thing more  
You know it don't come easy  
Even the best of friends must part  
Even so it grieves me  
Stay loose, don't fight it  
Let love take a holiday  
If it's wrong, you're gonna right it  
Do not waste these hours away  
Soon the storm will be over  
And the clouds will all pass by  
To be insane beyond belief  
Is sometimes the best relief  
And one thing sure  
Love never did come easy  
Even the best of dreams must end  
Even so it grieves me  
Stay loose, don't fight it  
Let it take you all the way and  
If it's wrong, you will right it  
Do not waste these hours away  
Stay loose, don't fight it  
Let love take a holiday  
If it's wrong, you're gonna right it  
Do not waste these hours away
