Tiran porter  
Well, I've had some thought in a loving direction  
I want to be the part of someone' affection  
Been alone too long, my head hangin' low  
There's no one to see and no place to go  
Need a lady  
Drive me crazy  
Come with me and surely we'll be free  
I walk the streets in the dead of night  
Wishing for some lovin' arms to hold me tight  
But it's always down to my old guitar  
That's all that keeps me from the bars  
I need a, need a lady  
Need a lady  
Like the lady from tennessee
