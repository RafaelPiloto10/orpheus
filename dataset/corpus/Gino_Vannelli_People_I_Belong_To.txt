Oh my father, he was a brother  
He worked his body hard to make ends meet  
Oh my mother remained his lover  
The things they did, the things they said  
Go 'round and 'round inside my head for good  
Oh my brother, when he was a schoolboy  
He gave up all his dreams to take on mine  
Oh my brother, now I have me one other  
The things we've said, the things we've done  
Stay in my heart since I was young  
And oh this world won't change for me  
The special things in life are free  
I've always known and understood  
There are people I belong to for good  
Oh my lady, she want my baby  
She get me through my days and through my nights  
Oh my lover, now I have me no other  
The things we do, the things we say  
I get more and more love each day  
And oh this world won't change for me  
The special things in life are free  
I've always known and understood  
There are people I belong to for good  
Oh my mother and my father  
And my brother and my lover  
Oh my mother, oh and my father  
And my brother and my lover
