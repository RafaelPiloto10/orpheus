Save the planet for another day  
(Attention shoppers, buy with a conscience and save!)  
Save the planet for another day  
(Save Alaska, let the caribou stay)  
Don't care what the governments say  
(They're all bought and paid for anyway.)  
Save the planet for another day  
(Hey Big Oil, what did you say?)  
  
We were runnin' through the night  
Never knowin' if we would see the light  
Paranoid schizophrenic visions  
Livin' in fear of the wrong decisions  
We got to wake up  
We got to keep goin'  
If they follow us  
There's no way of knowin'  
We got a job to do  
We got to save Mother Earth  
  
Be the ocean when it meets the sky  
(You can make a difference if you really try)  
Be the magic in the Northern lights  
(Six Days...six nights)  
Be the river as it rolls along  
(It has three-eyed fish and it's smelling strong)  
Be the rain you remember fallin'  
(Be the rain, be the rain)  
  
Yeah, rain was fallin' and we're soakin' wet  
Hail is beatin' down on our heads  
The wind is blowin' through our hair  
Faces frozen in the frigid air  
We got to get there  
Alaska  
We got to be there  
Before the big machines  
We got a job to do  
We got to save Mother Earth  
  
Dream the hunter on the western plain  
(The birds are all gone, where did they go?)  
Dream the fisherman in his boat  
(He's comin' home empty, he's barely afloat.)  
Dream the logger in the great northwest  
(They're runnin' out of trees, they got to give it a rest)  
(There's no other way to cut it)  
Dream the farmer in the old heartland  
(Corporate greed and chemicals are killin the land)  
  
Next mornin' Sun was up at dawn  
She looked around and Earth was gone  
Dark visions he had last night  
He needed peace, he needed light.  
He heard the rumble and  
He saw the big machines  
The green army rose  
It was a bad dream  
He had a job to do  
He had to save Mother Earth  
  
Be the ocean when it meets the sky  
(Greek freighters are dumping crap somewhere right now)  
Be the magic in the northern lights  
(The ice is melting!)  
Be the river as it rolls along  
(Toxic waste dumpin' from corporate farms.)  
Be the rain you remember fallin'  
(Be the rain, be the rain)  
Save the Planet for another day  
(Be the rain, be the rain)  
Be the river as it rolls along  
(Be the rain, be the rain)
