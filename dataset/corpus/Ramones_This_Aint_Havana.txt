I had no advantage over you  
There was troubles and I had 'em too  
Just 'cause you're so strung out  
Don't mean it can't work out  
  
Ba-ba-banana, this ain't Havana  
Do you like bananas, ba-ba-bananas  
  
Say you're a victim of society  
You ask them for your mercy  
Just like the cats in the garbage cans  
When's their time coming, man  
  
You better offer some resistance  
You better give up on my insistence  
Things happen overnight  
You don't give up without a fight  
  
Ba-ba-banana, this ain't Havana  
Do you like bananas, ba-ba-bananas  
  
You say you're poor and uneducated  
You ain't gotta chance 'cause you're hated  
You're on your way to life's promotion  
You hinder it with emotion  
  
Ba-ba-banana, this ain't Havana  
Do you like bananas, ba-ba-bananas
