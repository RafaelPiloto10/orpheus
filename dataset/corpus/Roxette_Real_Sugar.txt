Right at the front door I recognized the perfume  
The scent was perfect in the dusk by the moon  
There must be many ways to ask her to my room  
Why didn't I dare?  
  
Well, every hour I try to get somethin' done  
Out on the weekend when I'm just havin' some fun  
I'm windin' up with none, just zeros, no one's, just space with no air  
  
I get: "bye-bye baby-baby bye baby-baby bye-bye  
Real sugar, I don't want to climb no walls  
Real sugar, that's what I want or none at all  
Real sugar, sweet as a sweet can be  
Real sugar, that's what I want and what I need  
That's what I need  
  
Yeh, every Friday I'm gattin' ready to roll  
I want her blue eyes start sayin' "hi" and "hello"  
But I can always tell she'd rather be alone with some other guy  
  
I get: "bye-bye baby-baby bye baby-baby bye-bye  
Real sugar, I don't want to climb no walls  
Real sugar, that's what I want or none at all  
Real sugar, sweet as a sweet can be  
Real sugar, that's what I want and what I need  
Real sugar, I don't want to climb no walls  
Real sugar, that's what I want or none at all  
Real sugar, sweet as a sweet can be  
Real sugar, that's what you've got so what's for me? Hey, what's for me?  
  
I turn myself in, turn turn turn  
I turn myself out. outside and in  
Gimme gimme real sugar  
I don't want to climb no walls
