Woman is a man's best friend  
And I was crying in the night for love  
Baby, to the rainbows end  
I'll run for that sweet sweet stuff  
Oh, side by side  
I'll give all my love and emotions  
  
Don't lose my number, girl  
I'm qualified for  
Don't lose my number, girl  
I'm qualified for  
Don't don't lose my number  
I'm waiting for you  
Don't don't lose my number  
I'm qualified for love  
  
Diamonds are forever girl  
Save them for a rainy day  
I just want to be your world  
There's nothing left for me to say  
Oh, eye to eye  
I'll give all my love and devotion
