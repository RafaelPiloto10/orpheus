She's gonna leave me on my own again  
I guess it happens every now and then  
She closes her eyes and says goodnight  
God only knows the reason why  
We get together and we fall apart again  
  
Don't want to forgive me now  
You want to forget it  
But I know I'll be happy in your heart  
  
She spends her time so easy  
She casts the spell then leaves me  
She's on the make, she's out of touch  
My heart she breaks, much, too much  
When we're together we fall apart again  
  
Don't want to forgive me now  
You want to forget it  
But I know I'll be happy in your heart  
  
In the warmth of a winter morning  
The thorn and the kiss  
The rose in a withered garden  
Then true love lies like this  
  
She makes it look so easy  
Her sugar smile deceives me  
She closes her eyes and says goodnight  
God only knows the reason why  
We get together and we fall apart again  
  
Don't want to forgive me now  
You want to forget it  
But I know I'll be happy in your heart  
  
I hope that you're happy now  
You can forgive me  
I know I'll be happy in your heart
