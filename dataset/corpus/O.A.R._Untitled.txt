She takes it deep to the heart right from the start she talks softly over a
glass of wine.  
Now and again she's more than a friend, why don't you just throw me that line.  
It would be great if she'd dedicate just a minute from her precious time.  
I'll give it a while, but that's not my style, now how is that a crime?  
  
Everyone says that I'm wild.  
Pardon my French but I still know my child.  
And that was the day I told her I needed some time.  
  
Well I began walking when she was still talking I'm looking for that exit
sign.  
Pardon my face but I'm leaving no trace cause I really haven't got the time.  
Well I began thinking and my heart is just sinking and I'm looking for that
place to go.  
Isn't it sad that she'll treat you so bad, but you never really let her know.  
  
And everyone says that she's crying.  
But I can't forget all the time I spent trying.  
And that was the day I told her I needed some time.  
  
I know, I know what it feels like to be alone.  
I know, I know what it feels like to be at home.  
I like, I like stopping to say hello.  
It's my life, my life why can't we take this slow?  
Why can't we take this slow?  
  
Well I've been through these phases, I've walked through these mazes.  
I'm sick and I'm little tired.  
It sure isn't fair but I'm not aware of the patience that's required.  
If I could have kissed her every time that I missed her I wouldn't be out the
door  
But now and again, I sure need a friend now isn't that what she's for?  
  
And everyone says that I'm lying,  
But I can't forget all the time she spent crying.  
And that was the day I told her I needed some time.  
  
I know, I know what it feels like to be alone.  
I know, I know what it feels like to be at home.  
I like, I like stopping to say hello.  
It's my life, my life why can't we take this slow?  
Baby take it slow.  
It's my life.  
My life.  
Why can't we take it slow?  
Baby, take it slow.
