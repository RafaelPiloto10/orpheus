Overbearing woman makin' it so hard for me  
Now you've laid it down for all to see  
Can I ask a question, d'ya think you can take a  
Blow  
This is why I always come and go.  
  
Now you see it, now you don't  
Careful of words that get caught in your throat  
Face the music. Take it like a man  
Givin' it to me anyway you can  
  
Everybody's feeling everything you've got to  
Feel  
I've got something that you can conceal  
  
Now you see it  
Now you don't  
Now you see it  
Now you don't  
  
Give me central heating hope that I can pay the  
Bill  
  
Makin me forget my fear of hell  
Myst be luck in odd numbers now you face me  
Upside down  
I'm so far up I'm afraid to come back down
