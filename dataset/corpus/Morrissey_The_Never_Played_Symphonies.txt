Reflecting from my deathbed,  
I'm balancing life's riches...against the ditches  
And the flat gray years in between  
All I can see are the never laid,  
That's the never played symphonies  
  
I can't see those who tried to love me,  
Or those who felt they understood me  
And I can't see those who  
Very patiently...put up with me  
  
All I can see are the never laid,  
Or the never played symphonies  
  
You were one  
You were meant to be one,  
And you jumped into my face  
And laughed and kissed me on the cheek  
And then were gone, forever...not quite  
  
Black sky in the daytime  
And I don't much mind dying,  
When there is nothing left to care for...anymore  
Just the never laid  
The never played symphonies  
  
You were one  
You knew you were one  
And you slipped right through my fingers  
No not literally,  
But metaphorically  
And now you're all I see...as the light fades...
