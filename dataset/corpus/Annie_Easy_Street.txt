Rooster:  
I remember the way  
Our sainted mother  
Would sit and croon us  
Her lullaby  
  
Miss Hannigan:  
She'd say, kids, there's a place  
That's like no other  
You got to get there before you die  
  
Rooster:  
You don't get there  
By playing from the rule book  
  
Hannigan:  
You stack the aces  
  
Rooster:  
You load the dice  
  
Hannigan and Rooster:  
Mother dear  
Oh, we know you're down there listening,  
How can we follow  
Your sweet Advice to...  
  
Rooster:  
Easy street  
Easy street  
Where you sleep till noon  
  
Hannigan:

Rooster and Hannigan:  
She'd repeat  
Easy street  
Better get there soon.  
  
Rooster, Hannigan, and Lily:  
Easy street  
Easy street  
Where the rich folks play  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Move them feet  
  
Hannigan:  
Move them ever-lovin' feet  
  
Rooster, Hannigan, and Lily:

Hannigan:

Rooster, Hannigan, and Lily:  
When you get there stay  
  
Rooster:  
It ain't fair  
How we scrounge  
For three of four bucks  
While she gets Warbucks  
  
Hannigan:  
The little brat!  
It ain't fair this here life  
Is drivin' me nuts!  
While we get peanuts  
She's livin' fat!  
  
Rooster:  
Maybe she holds the key  
That little lady  
  
Hannigan:  
To gettin' more bucks  
  
Rooster:  
Instead of less  
Maybe we fix the game  
With something shady  
  
Lily:  
Where does that put us?  
  
Hannigan:  
Oh, tell her.  
  
Rooster:  
I'll give you one gues  
  
Rooster, Hannigan, and Lily:  
Yes!  
  
Easy street  
Easy street  
Annie is the key  
Yes sirree  
Yes sirree  
Yes sirree  
  
Easy street  
Easy street  
That's where we're gonna... Be!
