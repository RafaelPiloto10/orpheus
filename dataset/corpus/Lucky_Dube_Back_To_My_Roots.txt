I and my go to a naughty party one day  
Them said it' s gonna be irie there  
But when I and my go to a naughty party  
I and I was disappointed yeah  
All we could hear there was their crackadoo  
All we could hear there was their  
Shoobee doobee yeah  
And the music they played there  
Was not good for a rasta man yeah  
It was not good for a Jah man  
  
Chorus: (x3)  
I' m going back to my roots yeah yeah  
Reggae music is all that I need  
  
All we could hear there was their crackadoo  
All we could hear there was their  
Shoobee doobee yeah  
And the music they played there  
Was not good for a rasta man  
It was not good for a Jah man  
  
Chorus: (x2)  
Reggae is mine reggae is mine yeah yeah  
Reggae is mine yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
(fade)  
  
Chorus till fade
