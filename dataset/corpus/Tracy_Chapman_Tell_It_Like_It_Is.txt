Say it say it say it Tell it like it is  
Say it say it say it Tell it like it is  
  
What breaks your heart  
What keeps you awake at night  
What makes you want to breakdown and cry  
  
But say you'll never turn your back  
Say you'll never harden to the world  
Say you'll never try to still the rhythms in your breast  
Say you'll never look at the evil among us and try to forget  
Say you'll tell it like it is  
  
Say it say it say it  
So everyone can hear  
Say it say it say it tell it like it is  
  
What breaks your hear  
What keeps you awake at night  
How your anger and grief  
Make you want to cry out  
And tell it like it is  
  
But say you'll never close your eyes  
Or pretend that it's a rosy world  
Say you'll never try to paint  
What is rotten with a sugarcoat  
Say you'll talk about the horrors you've seen and the torment you know  
And tell it like it is  
  
Say it say it say it  
So no one can forget  
Say it say it say it Tell it like it is  
  
What breaks your heart  
What keeps you awake at night  
What makes you want to break the ties that silence and bind  
And tell it like it is  
  
Say you'll never cover your ears and close your mouth  
And live in a silent world  
Say you'll only run as far or as fast as you need to be secure  
Say that then you'll tell the truth  
When a lie could cross your lips  
And tell it like it is  
  
Say it say it say it, Say it say it say it  
Say it say it say it, Say it say it say it  
Say it say it say it, Say it say it say it  
Say it say it say it, Say it say it say it
