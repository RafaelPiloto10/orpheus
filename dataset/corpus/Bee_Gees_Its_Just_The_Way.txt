It's just the way that I feel about tomorrow  
I'll be sad and alone all the time  
It's just the way that you said you don't love me anymore, then 'Goodbye'  
I can't believe what you're saying  
You don't love me anymore, 'Goodbye'  
  
Just the way that I feel about tomorrow  
Knowing you won't be there by my side  
I wish that I could say to you: well, can't we just be good friends?  
Would you leave the door open, let me walk in again?  
  
That's the way I been thinking 'bout tomorrow  
I only know that friends can't be lovers again
