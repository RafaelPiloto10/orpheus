As Dorothy Parker once said to her boy friend,  
"Fare thee well,"  
As Columbus announced when he knew he was bounced,  
"It was swell, Isabelle, swell,"  
As Abelard said to Heloise,  
"Don't forget to drop a line to me, please,"  
As Juliet cried in her Romeo's ear,  
"Romeo, why not face that fact, dear?"  
  
It was just one of those things,  
Just one of those crazy flings,  
One of those bells that now and then rings,  
Just one of those things.  
  
It was just one of those nights,  
Just one of those fabulous flights,  
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings,  
Just one of those things  
  
If we'd thought a bit  
Of the end of it,  
When we started painting the town,  
We'd have been aware  
That our love affair  
Was too hot not to cool down.  
So goodbye, Dear, and Amen.  
Here's hoping we meet now and then,  
It was great fun,  
But it was just one of those things
