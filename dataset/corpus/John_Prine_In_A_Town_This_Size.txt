In a town this size, there's no place to hide  
Everywhere you go you meet someone you know  
You can't steal a kiss in a place like this  
How the rumors do fly in a town this size  
In a smokey bar in the backseat of your car  
In your own little house someone's sure to find you out  
What you do and what you think  
What you eat and what you drink  
If you smoke a cigarette they'll be talkin' about your breath

Oh, I had a fight with my girlfriend last night  
Before the moon went down it was all over town  
How he made me cry how I said goodbye  
If it's true or not doesn't seem to count alot
