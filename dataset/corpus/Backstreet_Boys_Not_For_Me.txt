Yeah  
Yeah yeah  
  
I was looking for something  
On the crime scene where you're in too deep  
I found a note with his number  
It's just another clue (that leads to you)  
  
I got a little suspicious  
I got a feeling that you ain't true to me  
I should've known better  
Than to buy your lie (your sweet disguise)  
  
Yeah  
You can fool anyone but I've got eyes to see  
that you're not for me babe  
  
[Chorus]  
No no, uh uh  
Things will never be the same again with you  
No no, uh uh  
Now I know what it's comin' to  
No no, uh uh  
'cause' if you think that it's the way  
That love should be  
Let me tell you it's not for me  
  
No no  
  
I don't want to be part of your screenplay  
Just tell me  
Did you rehearse on me?  
Now give me the story  
On baby who's to blame (maybe I am)  
Caught in the middle  
And I'm tired of your games of hide and seek  
I'm getting a feeling  
That it's time for me to leave  
  
You can fool anyone but I've got eyes to see  
That you're not for me babe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah (yeah)  
I said no no (no way)  
No no, no no (whoa)  
  
I had enough of your talk, your games  
And you won't go away  
Justify my reasons to say  
(Say, reasons to say)  
  
[Chorus: x2]
