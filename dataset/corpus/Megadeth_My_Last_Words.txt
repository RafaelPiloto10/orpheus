My life's on time but again my sense is late.  
Feel a might unsteady but I still have to play.  
Six to one's the odds and we have the highest stakes.  
And once again I gamble with my very life today.  
Highly polished metal, the oil makes it gleam.  
Fill the terror chamber, your mind begins to scream.  
Your life is like a trigger, never troubled till you're squeezed.  
Now you crack a smile as you give the gun a tease.  
Place the pistol down, now give the gun a spin.  
Soon as the spinning stops, oh no, the game starts in.  
A hateful way of vengeance, a bit of playful sin.  
Load another bullets, now the second round begins.  
A couple grains of power, a couple grams of lead.  
A touch against the trigger, a touch inside the head.  
Take another drink and raise the last bets.  
Think about my last words, they might be what I just said.  
A click comes from the hammer that couldn't drive a nail.  
Sense the numbing cold blue or the red of Hades' grill.  
A fraction of a second, do you lose or maybe still.  
Pass it to the left and collect your mighty kill.  
Add another bullet, the third round begins.  
Soon as the spinning stops, oh no, the game starts in.  
Please, no IOUs no markers for death.  
Does anybody play? Anybody? Somebody? Anybody play?  
You, you! Next victim! You, next to die.  
You, you! Next victim! You, next to die.  
You, come on! Next victim! Your turn to die!  
You, come on! Next victim! Your turn to die!
