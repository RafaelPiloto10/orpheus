Hold it here boy is that your bag  
In a small sneak and you've just been had  
Is that your scene bin, been what have I seen  
Well take a seat, feet, get your feet a seat  
  
Put circle round this this and a circle round that  
You put one in the front, and one in the back  
Would you show it to your mother or share it with another  
Slow down bitch  
Oh bitch slow down  
  
I'm so good, I'm so good, I'm so good, man I've been so good  
I'm so nice, I'm so nice, I'm so nice, man I'm so nice

I'm here to harass you, I want your pills and your grass you  
You don't look first class you  
Let me look up your ass you  
I smell dope, I smell dope, I smell dope, I am smelling dope  
I smell dope, I smell dope, I smell dope, I am smelling dope  
Holiday  
We're so good, We're so good, We're so good, man we've never been so good  
We're so nice, We're so nice, We're so nice, man we've never been so nice
