Hear the merry laugh of children,  
Hear the chestnut horses neigh!  
See the mice all scurry,  
See the farmers hurry,  
When it's time for  
Bringing in the hay!  
  
Good smells coming from the kitchen,  
We'll get lots of treats today!  
Cattle are a-mooing  
Pigeons are a-cooing,  
As they watch us  
Bringing in the hay!  
  
Pitchforks shining in the sunlight,  
As the farmers work all day,  
They were early starting,  
And they won't be parting,  
'Til we finish  
Bringing in the hay.
