If you change your mind, I'm the first in line.  
Honey I'm still free, take a chance on me.  
If you need me, let me know, and I'll be around.  
If you've got no place to go, when you're feeling down.  
  
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown.

Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie.  
If you put me to the test, if you let me try.  
  
Take a chance on me. (come on, give me a break will ya?)  
Take a chance on me.  
  
We can go dancing, we can go walking,  
As long as we're together. (together)  
Listen to some music, maybe just talking,  
Get to know you better. (better)  
  
Cause you know I've got so much that I want to do,  
When I dream I'm alone with you.  
It's magic!  
You wanted to leave me there, afraid of a love affair,  
But I think you know, that I can't let go.
