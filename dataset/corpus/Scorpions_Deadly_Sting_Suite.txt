Sometimes there's a time you must say goodbye  
Though it hurts you must learn to try  
I know I've got to let you go  
But I know anywhere you go  
You'll never be far  
'Cause like the light of a bright star  
You'll keep shining in my life  
You're gonna be right  
  
Here in my heart  
That's where you'll be  
You'll be with me  
Here in my heart  
No distance can keep us apart  
Long as you're here in my heart  
  
Won't be any tears falling from these eyes  
'Cause when love's true love never dies  
It stays alive forever  
Time can't take away what we have  
I will remember our time together  
You might think our time is through  
But I still have you  
  
Here in my heart  
That's where you'll be  
You'll be with me  
Here in my heart  
No distance can keep us apart  
Long as you're here in my heart  
  
I know you'll be back again  
And 'till then  
My love is waiting  
  
Here in my heart  
That's where you'll be  
You'll be with me  
Here in my heart  
No distance can keep us apart  
Long as you're here in my heart  
  
Tracy I Love You
