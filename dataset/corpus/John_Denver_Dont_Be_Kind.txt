You've been sweet, you've been good  
I've been better than you ever cook  
I've been yours, you've been mine  
Don't be kind  
You got dreams, I've got plans  
I'll be gone before you understand  
I betrayed, you've been blind  
Don't be kind  
(Don't be kind)  
Shoot it straight as an arrow  
(Don't be kind)  
To the quick, to the marrow  
You can say what you've got on your mind  
Don't be kind  
We've been friends, we've been folks  
We've been lovers clinging so close  
We've believed but not this time  
Don't be kind  
When you hurt me, oh, you hurt me  
Then you feel you must be nice  
Well, it's bad enough to take it once  
Being kind makes it twice  
It's been great, it's been real  
It's been soft as silk and tough as steel  
You be yours and I'll be mine  
Don't be kind  
(Don't be kind)  
Shoot it straight as an arrow  
(Don't be kind)  
To the quick, to the marrow  
You can say what you've got on your mind  
Don't be kind  
Don't be kind  
You can say what you got on your mind  
(Don't be kind)  
Shoot it straight as an arrow  
(Don't be kind)  
To the quick, to the marrow  
You can say what you've got on your mind  
Don't be kind  
Don't be kind  
You can say what you've got on your mind  
Don't be kind  
Don't be kind  
You can say what you've got on your mind  
Don't be kind  
Don't be kind
