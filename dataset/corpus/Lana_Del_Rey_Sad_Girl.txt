Every single night when I go down to the west coast  
The people seem dead like I'm dancing with their ghost  
Nothing in this world keeps me more on my feet  
Than your sweet lovin' oooh your lovin'  
  
What happened to days when you were mine  
The way you looked, so God damned fine  
Guess I'll be alone this summertime  
  
'Cause I'm a sad girl dancing on my own  
Long way, far away from home  
Some day I will find you in the sunset  
I'm a sad girl, searching for a dream  
Just know that we're on each other's team  
Some day I will find you, you bet  
But now you've left me,  
Singing this sweet song  
Hold me, never held me for too long  
Love me, your love was porous like a rock  
Maybe you just forgot  
That I loved you
