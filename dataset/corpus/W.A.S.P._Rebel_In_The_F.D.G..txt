I live my life like a shot in the wind  
If tomorrow don't come I know  
I stole my share of fun for me  
Cause I'm too fast, too rad  
I'm going wasted when I go  
The cost of freedom's never free  
It's the deep six, it's my fix  
It's my best friend, cause it's my way or the highway  
I'll tell you it's the living end  
  
I'm a rebel in the FDG  
And I say only God in heaven knows  
I'm a bad child, come and love me  
And I say, oh yeah  
  
If you're fast you might last  
Slow you gotta go  
A wild one in the decadent zoo  
Ooh, I lick up all my seven deadly sins  
Cause I'm too hot, too cool  
Oh I've been playing in the fire of fools  
I might burn but I'll burn in the wind  
It's the deep six, it's my fix  
It's the big jam, cause it's my way or the highway  
I'll tell you what I am  
  
Oh I, I feel the heat and I, I touch the flesh and bone  
And I feel the kiss of fire  
Too fast to live, too fast to die  
Mom and daddy say, "I'm dancing in the fire"  
  
Sometimes I feel like an animal in a cage  
I pace back and forth and look around  
For something to sink my teeth into  
But nobody knows what's going on inside me
