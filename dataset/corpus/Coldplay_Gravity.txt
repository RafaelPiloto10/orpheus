Honey  
It's been a long time coming  
And I can't stop now  
Such a long time running  
And I can't stop now  
Do you hear my heart beating?  
Can you hear that sound?  
'Cause I can't help thinking  
I don't look down  
  
And then I looked up at the sun  
And I could see  
Oh, the way that gravity turns for you and me  
And then I looked up at the sky  
And saw the sun  
And the way that gravity turns on everyone  
On everyone  
  
Baby  
It's been a long time waiting  
Such a long, long time  
And I can't stop smiling  
Oh I can't stop now  
Do you hear my heart beating?  
Oh, do you hear that sound?  
'Cause I can't stop crying  
And I won't look down  
  
And then I looked up at the sun  
And I could see  
Oh, the way that gravity turns on you and me  
And then I looked up at the sun  
And saw the sky  
And the way that gravity pulls on you and I  
On you and I
