You shall cross the barren desert  
But you shall not die of thirst  
You shall wander far in safety  
Though you do not know the way.  
  
You shall speak your words in foreign lands  
And all will understand  
You shall see the face of God and live.  
  
Be not afraid  
I go before you always  
Come follow Me  
And I shall give you rest.  
  
If you pass through raging waters  
In the sea, you shall not drown  
If you walk amidst the burning flames  
You shall not be harmed.  
  
If you stand before the pow'are of hell  
And death is at your side  
Know that I am with you, through it all.  
  
Be not afraid  
I go before you always  
Come follow Me  
And I shall give you rest.  
  
Blessed are your poor  
For the Kingdom shall be theirs  
Blest are you that weep and mourn  
For one day you shall laugh.  
  
And if wicked men insult and hate you  
All because of Me  
Blessed, blessed are you!  
  
Be not afraid  
I go before you always  
Come follow Me  
And I shall give you rest...
