See Boy Strange on the  
Horizon of love  
He's calling to you  
What do you say?  
  
See Boy Strange as an  
Example of youth  
So close to the truth  
But still far away  
  
And he's such a strange boy  
Will he make a good  
Exchange for  
The one before a closed door  
That you left behind?  
  
When you realize that this boy  
Is strange  
It's too late to change  
Your point of view  
  
He's often there when the  
Sun meets the sky  
With a perfect alibi  
Unlike you  
  
And he's such a strange boy  
Do you think he'll make a good  
Exchange for  
The one before a closed door  
That you left behind?  
  
To talk of common sense is a  
Complete waste of time  
His looks are a crime  
Bound to commit  
  
In the eyes of the world he's  
A borderline fool  
Both naive and cruel  
Why would you inflict  
Him on you?
