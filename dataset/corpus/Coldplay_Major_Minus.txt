They got one eye watching you  
One eye on what you do  
So be careful who it is you're talking to  
They got one eye watching you  
One eye on what you do  
So be careful what it is you're trying to do  
  
And be careful when you're walking in the view  
Just be careful when you're walking in the view  
  
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  
Got one eye on the road and one on you  
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  
Got one eye on the road and one on  
  
They got one eye watching you  
And one eye on what you do  
So be careful 'cause nothing they say is true  
D-don't believe a word, it's us against the world  
And we just got to turn up to be heard  
  
Hear the crocodiles ticking round the world  
Hear those crocodiles ticking, they go ticking round the world  
  
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  
Got one eye on the road and one on you  
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  
Got one eye on the road and  
You could hear them climbing the stairs  
I got my right side fighting while  
My left hides under the chairs  
  
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  
Got one eye on the road and one on you  
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  
Got one eye on the road and one on you
