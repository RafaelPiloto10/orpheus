Oh my my, I could love you forever.  
Oh my my, I only wish that I could.  
Oh my my, I could love you forever.  
Oh my my, girl you feel so good.  
  
You, you make my heart sing.  
You make my life worthwhile.  
I feel such there's so much to discover  
To uncover it is gonna take a while.  
  
Oh my my, I could love you forever.  
Oh my my, I only wish that I could.  
Oh my my, I could love you forever.  
Oh my my, girl you feel so good.  
  
I think of us together  
It takes my breath away.  
Up to the sky I go flying  
"Oh my my" is all I can say.  
  
Oh my my  
Oh my my my my  
Oh my my my my my my  
Oh my oh my (oh my oh my oh my my my my my my)  
  
You, you make my heart sing.  
You make my life worthwhile.  
I feel such there's so much to discover  
To uncover it is gonna take a while.  
  
Oh my my, I could love you forever.  
Oh my my, I only wish that I could.  
Oh my my, I could love you forever.  
  
Oh my my, I could love you forever.  
Oh my my, I only wish that I could.  
Oh my my, I could love you forever.  
Oh my girl you feel so good.
