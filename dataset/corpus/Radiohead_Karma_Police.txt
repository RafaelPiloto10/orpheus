Karma police  
Arrest this man  
He talks in maths  
He buzzes like a fridge  
He's like a detuned radio  
  
Karma police  
Arrest this girl  
Her Hitler hairdo  
Is making me feel ill  
And we have crashed her party  
  
This is what you'll get  
This is what you'll get  
This is what you'll get  
When you mess with us  
  
Karma police  
I've given all I can  
It's not enough  
I've given all I can  
But we're still on the payroll  
  
This is what you'll get  
This is what you'll get  
This is what you'll get  
When you mess with us  
  
For a minute there  
I lost myself, I lost myself  
Phew, for a minute there  
I lost myself, I lost myself  
  
For a minute there  
I lost myself, I lost myself  
Phew, for a minute there  
I lost myself, I lost myself
