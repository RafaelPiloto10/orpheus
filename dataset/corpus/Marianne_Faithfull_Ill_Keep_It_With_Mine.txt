You will search, babe  
At any cost  
But how long, babe  
Can you search for what is not lost?  
Everybody will help you  
Some people are very kind  
But if I can save you anytime  
Come on, give it to me  
I'll keep it with mine  
I can't help it  
If you might think I am odd  
If I say I'm loving you  
Not for what you are but for what you're not  
Everybody will help you  
Discover what you set out to find  
But if I can save you anytime  
Come on, give it to me  
I'll keep it with mine  
The train leaves  
At half past ten  
But it will be back  
In the same old spot again  
The conductor  
He's still stuck on the line  
But if I can save you anytime  
Come on, give it to me  
I'll keep it with mine
