Fat and weak, what a disgrace  
Guess the champ got too lazy  
Ain't gonna fly now he's just takin' up space  
Sold his gloves, threw his eggs down the drain  
  
But he's no bum, he works down the street  
He bought the neighborhood deli  
Back on his feet, now he's choppin' up meat  
Come inside maybe you'll hear him say  
  
Try the rye or the kaiser they're our special tonight  
If you want you can have an appetizer  
You might like our salami and the liver's all right  
And they'd really go well with the rye or the kaiser  
  
Never eats while on the job  
He heard it's good to stay hungry  
But he makes a pretty mean shishkabob  
Have a taste they were made fresh today  
  
Try the rye or the kaiser or the wheat or the white  
Maybe I can suggest an appetizer  
Stay away from the tuna it smells funny tonight  
But you just can't go wrong with the rye or the kaiser  
  
So today, his deli comes first  
Still he dreams of his past days of glory  
Goes in the back and beats up on the liverwurst  
All the while you can still hear him say  
  
It's the rye or the kaiser, it's the thrill of one bite  
Let me please be your catering advisor  
If you want substitutions I won't put up a fight  
You can have your roast beef on the rye or the kaiser  
  
The rye or the kaiser  
The rye or the kaiser  
The rye or the kaiser
