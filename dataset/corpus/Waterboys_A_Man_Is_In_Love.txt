A man is in love, how do I know?  
He came and walked with me, and he told me so  
In a song he sang, and then I knew  
A man is in love with you  
  
A man is in love, how did I hear?  
I heard him talk too much whenever you're near  
He whispered your name when his eyes were closed  
A man is in love and he knows  
  
A man is in love, how did I guess?  
I figuered it out while he was watching you dress  
He'd give you his all, if you'd but agree  
A man is in love and he's me
