Tommy Still drives that ol' pickup truck  
He had back in high school  
He says he won't trade it in  
'Cause they don't make 'em like they used to  
His wife Donna's got a picture of Elvis  
By the clock in the kitchen  
Her hair and Clothes come back in style  
Ever now and then  
They made a promise on their wedding day  
Nothin's gonna take this feeling away  
  
Let the world turn  
Let the years drift by  
The fire will burn  
In their hearts just as bright  
Time may take it's toll  
But their love won't grow old  
And if they live to be a hundred and one  
They're still gonna die young  
  
Tommy spent years fixin' wheels and brakes  
at the texaco on the highway  
Donna kept the kids and did Permanent waves  
At the beauty shop on fridays  
It's been forty years but who'd ever know  
By the way they carry on  
Just the same two kids as much in love  
as the day they married on  
They made a promise on there wedding day  
Nothings gonna take this feeling away  
  
Let the world turn  
Let the years drift by  
The fire will burn  
In their hearts just as bright  
Time may take it's toll  
But their love won't grow old  
And if they live to be a hundred and one  
They're still gonna die young  
  
Gonna die young  
  
Let the world turn  
Let the years drift by  
The fire will burn  
In their hearts just as bright  
Time may take it's toll  
But their love won't grow old  
And if they live to be a hundred and one  
They're still gonna die young  
  
Let the world turn  
Let the years drift by  
The fire will burn  
In their hearts just as bright  
Time may take it's toll  
But their love won't grow old  
And if they live to be a hundred and one  
They're still gonna die young  
  
Let the world turn  
Let the years drift by  
The fire will burn  
In their hearts just as bright  
Time may take it's toll  
But their love won't grow old  
And if they live to be a hundred and one  
They're still gonna die young  
  
They're still gonna die young
