I've got the brains, you've got the looks  
Let's make lots of money  
You've got the brawn, I've got the brains  
Let's make lots of  
  
I've had enough of scheming and messing around with jerks  
My car is parked outside, I'm afraid it doesn't work  
I'm looking for a partner, someone who gets things fixed  
Ask yourself this question, Do you want to be rich?  
  
I've got the brains, you've got the looks  
Let's make lots of money  
You've got the brawn, I've got the brains  
Let's make lots of money  
  
You can tell I'm educated, I studied at the Sorbonne  
Doctored in mathematics, I could have been a don  
I can program a computer, choose the perfect time  
If you've got the inclination, I have got the crime  
  
Oh, there's a lot of opportunities  
If you know when to take them, you know?  
There's a lot of opportunities  
If there aren't, you can make them  
Make or break them  
  
I've got the brains, you've got the looks  
Let's make lots of money  
Let's make lots of  
Money  
  
You can see I'm single-minded, I know what I could be  
How'd you feel about it, come and take a walk with me?  
I'm looking for a partner, regardless of expense  
Think about it seriously, you know, it makes sense  
  
Let's (Got the brains)  
Make (Got the looks)  
Let's make lots of money (Oh money)  
(Let's) You've got the brawn  
(Make) I've got the brains  
Let's make lots of money (Oh money)  
  
I've got the brains (Got the brains)  
You've got the looks (Got the looks)  
Let's make lots of money (Oh money)  
Money
