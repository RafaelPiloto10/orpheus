I stand alone I'm just a face in the crowd  
I get lonely if the truth be said  
Sometimes I want to cry out loud  
But I try to understand instead  
I wish I had the strength inside to walk  
Right up to you  
I'd never have to hide behind these  
Doubts I know are true  
  
It's not too late to fall in love  
Accept your fate I'm the one you're  
Thinking of  
It's not too late so don't run away  
I need you too, but it's hard for me  
So hard for me to say  
  
So I listen for the perfect moment  
To rush to you but my heart's too slow  
Everybody here can see me stumble  
Better wait until the lights get low  
Wish I had the strength inside to walk  
Right up to you  
I wouldn't have to hide behind these  
Doubts I know are true  
  
It's not too late to fall in love  
Accept your fate I'm the one your  
Thinking of  
It's not too late so don't run away  
I need you too  
  
But it's hard for me  
Yes it's hard for me  
Yes it's hard for me  
So hard for me to say  
  
It's not too late to fall in love  
Accept your fate I'm the one you're  
Thinking of  
It's not too late so don't run away  
I need you too, but it's hard for me  
So hard for me to say
