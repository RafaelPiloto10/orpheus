When you passed my way  
It seemed my lucky day  
The world was oh-so fine  
Once upon a time  
  
We walked for a little while  
You smiled that special smile  
And when we said goodnight  
You held me oh-so tight  
  
Then you found someone new  
And I spent my nights alone  
'Cause now we're through  
There's nothing I can do  
I gotta say forget...  
Forget him, forget him  
'Cause he's no good, no, no  
  
Now, when you pass my way  
I guess I'll smile and say  
To think that boy was mine  
Once upon a time  
  
To think that boy was mine  
Once upon a time  
Once upon a time  
Woh, oh, once upon a time  
No, no, no, no, no, once upon a time
