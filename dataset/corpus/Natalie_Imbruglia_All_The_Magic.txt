(colonna sonora del film delle winx)  
  
Promises have meaning once again  
And broken dreams are drifting to an end  
I'm feel it like my life has just begun  
  
I'm waking for the first time, waking for the first time  
Waking for the very first time to the sun  
  
I'm getting a feeling that I want to explore  
My heart to the ceiling and my feet off the floor  
You let in all the magic  
  
Oh it's even better than before  
You open your heart and then you open the door  
I'm getting all the magic  
  
Desert land is drinking from the sky  
Ever since I heard the words that made me cry  
There's love in shadows waiting to be seen  
  
I'm waking for the first time, waking for the first time  
Waking for the very first time to a dream  
  
I'm getting a feeling that I want to explore  
My heart to the ceiling and my feet off the floor  
You let in all the magic  
  
Oh It's even better than before  
You open your heart and then you oprn the door  
I'm getting all the magic  
  
I'm getting a feeling that I want to explore  
My heart to the ceiling and my feet off the floor  
You let in all the magic  
  
I'm getting all the magic  
I'm getting all the magic  
  
Could you imagine, all the magic  
I'm getting all the magic
