[Puff] Escobar season has returned...  
[Nas]  
It's been a long time, been a long time comin  
Looks like the death of me now  
But you know, there's no turning back now  
This is what makes me - this is what I am  
[Puff] Feel me? Let's go  
[Base Chorus: Puff Daddy]  
You can hate me now.. but I won't stop now..  
Cause I can't stop now.. you can hate me now..  
But I won't stop now.. cause I can't stop now..  
You can hate me now.. you can hate me NOWWWW..  
[1st Chorus: add Nas after each pause]  
Q.B., real niggas, Bravehearts, c'mon  
[1st Chorus: after Nas add Puff Daddy ad lib]  
Well you hate me I'm gon' hate you too  
It's as simple as that  
Die motherfucker die motherfucker die  
You don't give a fuck I don't give a fuck  
Go down any way you want it to go down (do it now)  
Weak, jealous motherfuckers (do it now, do it now)  
Fuck y'all!  
[Verse 1]  
Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy  
Ice that I wear, clothes that I try, close your eyes  
Picture me rollin, sixes, money foldin  
Bitches honies that swollen to riches, Nas get in ya  
Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer, prize winner  
Best storyteller thug narrator my style's greater  
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters  
Commentators ringside try watchin my paper  
Almost a decade, quite impressive  
Most of the best is in the essence  
For this rap shit that I stand for  
Expandin more to the big screen, Bill Gates dreams  
But it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens  
Want me off the scene fast, but good things last  
Like your favorite MC still makin some mean cash  
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque, back to the projects  
But you still wanna hate,
