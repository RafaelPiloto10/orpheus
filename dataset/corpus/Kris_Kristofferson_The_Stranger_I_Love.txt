I've been a simple man and I've been insane  
And I've been a vagabond and I've been a king, yeah  
But I've been a better man just tryin' to please the stranger I love  
  
Lost in a wilderness, darker than pain, drawn to her loneliness just like a
flame  
The closer we come the more that I learn, the stranger I love  
Bad as I loved her, I ain't afraid we'll be together some lovin' way  
  
I'll be her lover just as long as I can, then when it's over, she'll need a
friend  
So I'll take her hand-me-downs, I'll take the blame  
I'll be a hang-around, I ain't ashamed  
'Cause the longer I love her, the more I believe the stranger I love.
