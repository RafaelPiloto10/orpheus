Are the Wings of Angels all a lie Tell me is this  
not you Are these Signs and Warnings all we know  
Tell me is this not you West Wind at my shoulder,  
North Wind at my back On the Bridge of Death no  
turning back The Cavern waits before me, a Falcon  
at my fist Seven Rings of Knowledge I exist . . . to Kill ! ! !  
Guardian of the Red Queen, Seven Rivers wide This  
won't end til one of us has died Eternal Death devour  
those who left their Mark Bleeding all the Light out  
of the Dark . . . to Kill ! ! !  
Gods of the Night, Gods of Day Lead me to another  
place We have the Force to make Wrong Right As the  
River leaves the stream All your yesterdays, shining  
bands unfold With the Power to Smash  
WE CAME, WE SAW, WE CONQUERED YOU ALL WE CAME, WE SAW,  
WE LIVE BY THE SWORD WE CAME, WE SAW, WE CONQUERED YOU  
ALL WE CAME, WE SAW, WE LIVE BY THE SWORD  
Arrows rip my shoulder, forge a distant Prize Shadows  
of their Might I know their Eyes On the Black Horizon  
see our Banners Wave Baring all Perdition for the  
Brave . . . to Kill ! ! !  
Gods of the Night, Gods of Day Lead me to another place  
We have the Force to make Wrong Right As the River runs  
away . . . All your yesterdays, shining bands of gold  
With the Guardian that hangs on the Pine We are Children  
of those who left their Mark With the Power to Smash ! ! ! ! ! !!  
WE CAME, WE SAW, WE CONQUERED YOU ALL WE CAME, WE SAW,  
WE LIVE BY THE SWORD WE CAME, WE SAW, WE CONQUERED YOU  
ALL WE CAME, WE SAW, WE LIVE BY THE SWORD All your  
yesterdays shine on Wings of Light Sky Father, Lord of our  
Sorrows, our Victory is at hand Watch us . . . SHINE ! ! !
