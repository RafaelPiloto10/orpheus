Jumbo said to say goodnight  
See you in the morning  
Please don't lose your appetite  
He knows who is yawning  
tomorrow you can climb a moutain  
Sail a sailboat trough a fountain  
  
Jumbo said he say goodnight  
Play no games , he'd say to me  
We know who is wrong  
So please don't make no hesitation  
There will be no recriation  
  
Jumbo said to say goodnight  
He's a friend of yours  
Listen you can chew it  
If it's loud enough you can hear it  
  
'Cause it's narrow as a sparrow  
And it shoots a bow and arrow  
Thro'a top that's made with  
Powder with a gun it's even louder  
  
And it's shattering to hear  
Yuo mustn't listen with your ear  
But it gets to you  
Yes ! yes ! yes ! yes ! yes ! yes !
