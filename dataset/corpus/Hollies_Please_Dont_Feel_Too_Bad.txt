Please don't feel too bad because I'm leaving.  
I'm coming home again to you.  
And when I go away, I know you're grieving  
Although you know that I'll be true.  
  
I'm wondering what to do to make you know you're mine.  
I'll take you in my arms and then all will be fine.  
And when I'm away from you, you know I'll miss you.  
I want to feel your tender touch.  
  
And when I'm feeling blue, I want to kiss you.  
I stay away from you too much.

Whoa whoa yeah, too much  
Yeah yeah yeah, too much  
Whoa whoa whoa, too much
