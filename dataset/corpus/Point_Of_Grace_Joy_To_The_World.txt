Joy to the world! The Lord is come:  
Let earth receive her King.  
Let every heart prepare Him room,  
And heaven and nature sing,  
And heaven and nature sing,  
And heaven and heaven and nature sing.  
He rules the world with truth and grace,  
And makes the nations prove  
The glories of His righteousness  
And wonders of His love,  
And wonders of His love,  
And wonders, wonders of His love.
