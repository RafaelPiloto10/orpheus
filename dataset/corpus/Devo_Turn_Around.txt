take a step outside yourself  
then you turn around  
take a look at who you are  
it's pretty scary  
  
you're so silly  
well it's revolting  
you're not much  
if you're anything  
  
take a step outside the city  
and you turn around  
take a look at what you are  
well it's revolting  
  
you're really nowhere  
you're so wasteful  
so foolish  
no big deal  
  
(booji boy)who said don't look back  
don't you believe 'em  
you go for that corner seat in the restaurant  
'cause they're gonna try and get behind ya  
don't you let 'em do it  
you know what i'm talkin' about?  
you hear me talking?  
  
it's pretty scary  
it's so revolting  
  
take a step outside the country  
then you turn around  
take a look at where you are  
well it's amazing  
  
take a good look  
you're no big deal  
you're so petty  
it's a laugh  
  
take a step outside the planet  
you turn around and round  
now take a look at where you are  
it's pretty scary
