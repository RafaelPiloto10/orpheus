I had a face so cute made a young girl cry  
And I could blow 'em away with just a wink of my eye  
I got all dolled up on a Saturday night  
Can't find a lady so I'll start a fight  
Hey but ain't that the American Dream  
  
But at School the young boys would assemble down in the parking lot  
And we spoke of the homecoming queen and all the goodies she's got  
Well those stories would choke a semi  
And every dare was do or die  
Hey but ain't that the American Dream  
  
[Bridge:]  
  
Well I grew up believin' I could do what I wanted to do  
When I got a little older I found that it just wasn't true  
There's gotta be a place for me  
Where I can out-be just what I want to be  
Hey but ain't that the American Dream  
  
Some of the girls are out teaching high school biology  
And all of my boyfriends they work down at Cummmins factory  
But me I'm still out on the streets trying to locate some destiny  
Hey but ain't that the American Dream  
  
(repeat bridge)
