You've been riding this horse a long time  
Why can't you find what you've been looking for?  
Always greener on the other side  
Always believing there must be something more  
  
Never stay very long anywhere  
As the next girl you leave gets smaller  
In your rear view mirror  
  
You're an outlaw  
You're an outlaw  
You're an outlaw running from love  
You're an outlaw  
You're an outlaw  
You're an outlaw running from love  
If you tear her world apart you have no regrets  
If there's a key to your heart no one's found it yet  
You're an outlaw  
You're an outlaw  
You're an outlaw running from love  
  
Your reputation's getting out of control  
I can't believe she believes one word you said  
Before I let you take my girlfriend home  
I've got to warn her about the price on your head  
  
It must feel so alone out there  
Always running away from someone  
But you get no where  
  
You're an outlaw  
You're an outlaw  
You're an outlaw running from love  
You're an outlaw  
You're an outlaw  
You're an outlaw running from love  
If you tear her world apart you have no regrets  
If there's a key to your heart no one's found it yet  
You're an outlaw  
You're an outlaw  
You're an outlaw running from love  
  
I'm from the Lone Star state  
I'm ready to bring you in, oh  
I'm gonna seal your fate  
Make you pay for all of your sins, oh  
Oh oh  
  
You've been riding this horse a long time  
I've had my eye on you all night  
I'm gonna find a way to make you mine  
I know, even though  
  
You're an outlaw  
You're an outlaw  
You're an outlaw running from love  
You're an outlaw  
You're an outlaw  
You're an outlaw running from love  
If you tear her world apart you have no regrets  
If there's a key to your heart no one's found it yet  
You're an outlaw  
You're an outlaw  
You're an outlaw running from love  
  
Stop running
