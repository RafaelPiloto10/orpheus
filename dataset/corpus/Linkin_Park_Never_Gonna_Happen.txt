You might as well quit while your at it  
You aint going no where  
I feel so hollow inside  
And it' s all your fault  
You' re the cause of all this pain  
Now I' m left here dying  
  
You think you can beat me  
It' s never gonna happen  
You wanna reach the end  
It' s never gonna happen  
Do what you wanna do  
It aint gonna happen  
  
I wont let you do this  
Not anymore  
Ur so vindictive  
You always have been  
I regret the day I met you, I saw you  
Now you don' t even remember me  
I' m just the voice in your head  
Screaming, crying  
And telling you......  
  
That it aint gonna happen ....
