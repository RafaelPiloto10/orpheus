So many years that we were one  
So many things we've done  
The memories alive  
But most of me has died  
  
As I struggle with events  
I'm offered words of strength  
They do not comprehend  
The passion we possessed  
  
People tell me what to do  
Tell me how I should get through  
But they haven't got a clue  
No one else comes close to you  
  
I see your eyes before they closed  
They looked right inside my soul  
And they asked me not to grieve  
I tried but still I bleed  
  
I wake up, I break up  
Try hard to shake off  
The desolation as it grows  
As nothing else comes close  
  
And as I stand here by the grave  
And the wind calls out your name  
I know that time could never heal  
The emptiness I feel  
  
People try to give me hope  
Tell me how I should let go  
But they'll never really know  
'Cause there's nothing else comes close  
  
People tell me what to do  
Tell me how I should get through  
But they haven't got a clue  
No one else comes close to you
