My whole life rides on the mood of my lady  
Her ups and downs are turning my life around  
She's happy today, it's like a breath of new life  
But tomorrow her sorrow will tear me down.  
  
Slowly, oh slowly I can tell that she needs me  
It shows right through the walls she's built around herself  
Oh higher, oh higher I'm climbing in her eyes  
It's a servant she wants but a man she must have.  
  
Oh, oh woman I need you like I never needed anyone  
Oh, oh woman like the morning needs the sun  
Oh, oh woman you know that our lives have just begun  
I'll behave, oh woman, 'cause I'm your slave.  
  
Oh, two lives in tune, it's a delicate balance to keep  
We'll stand together but never too near  
Oh, hold me close but don't you smother me  
I'll speak of my love but only for you to hear.  
  
Oh, oh woman I need you like I never needed anyone  
Oh, oh woman like the morning needs the sun  
Oh, oh woman you know that our lives have just begun  
I'll behave, oh woman, 'cause I'm your slave.
