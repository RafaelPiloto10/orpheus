Baby, never have I ever wanted anyone like I want you babe  
Come and let me show you just how much I feel inside  
I got so much love  
Oh baby, when I get near you  
Ooh, I can't control what I'm feeling  
Baby  
I got so much love to give that I would probably want all the time  
  
Carino, Carino, Carino, Carino  
I gotta have your love, Carino  
Need to feel your touch, Carino  
Never get enough, Carino, Carino  
  
I wish that I could spend all my days  
And nights wrapped in your arms  
Spending time with you 'cause all I see  
In this world is me and you and no one elase, ooh  
I want you more and more  
Oh baby, please understand me  
I think that you deserve me  
Cause I'm the type that would give you all the love  
And affection that you need  
  
Carino, Carino, Carino, Carino  
I gotta have your love, Carino  
Need to feel your touch, Carino  
Never get enough, Carino, Carino
