What makes me treat you the way I do  
Gee, Baby ain't I good to you  
There's nothing in the world  
Too good for a girl that's good and true  
Gee, Baby ain't I good to you  
Bought you a fur coat for Christmas  
A diamond ring  
A big Cadillac car  
And everything  
It's love that makes me treat you the way I do  
Gee, Baby ain't I good to you  
  
What makes me treat you the way I do  
Gee, Baby ain't I good to you  
There's nothing in the world  
Too good for a guy that's good and true  
Gee, Baby ain't I good to you  
Fur coat for Christmas  
A diamond ring  
A big Cadillac car  
And everything  
There's nothing in the world that I wouldn't do  
Gee, Baby ain't I good to you  
  
What makes me treat you the way I do  
Gee, Baby ain't I good to you  
There's nothing in the world  
Too good for a girl that's good and true  
Gee, Baby ain't I good to you  
Fur coat for Christmas  
A diamond ring  
Big Cadillac car  
And everything  
It's love that makes me treat you the way that I do  
Gee, Baby ain't I good to you  
Gee, Baby ain't I good to you
