Headed north on a one way trip  
I never thought I'd be back this way  
I never thought I'd be missin' you  
Enough to suffer for a whole night through  
  
Headed south and I didn't look back  
I rode the wind off the beaten track  
I tried runnin' from the thought of you  
Hunted down by what I know is true  
  
To the north to the south it don't matter  
Every road leads to you  
  
All roads lead to you wherever I go  
Every time I told you I was just passin' through  
What my heart didn't know  
Was all roads lead to you  
  
Headed east on an Amtrak train  
I hit the city in the pourin' rain  
I never thought I'd be callin' you  
Every hour from that hotel room  
  
Headed west on a jumbo jet  
I rode off into the red sunset  
I stood there knockin' on the devil's door  
Wonderin' what the hell I'm searchin' for  
  
To the east to the west it don't matter  
Every sign points to you  
  
All roads lead to you wherever I go  
Every time I told you I was just passin' through  
What my heart didn't know  
Was all roads lead to you  
  
All my life the winding road i followed  
Has led me straight to your arms  
  
All roads lead to you wherever I go  
Every time I told you I was just passin' through  
What my heart didn't know  
Was all roads lead to you
