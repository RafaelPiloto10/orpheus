Move on as we step in time  
Strange words from the other line  
Edging forward, feeling strong  
Syncopate with the marching song  
Thoughts and dreams flick across your mind  
Fade away as you wait for your time to go  
You're waiting, waiting, waiting  
Looking back as you head for home  
Unsure if you walk alone  
Friends call from an open door  
Strange voice as you cross the floor  
Thoughts of home flick across your mind  
Slip away as you wait for your time to go  
You're waiting, waiting, waiting
