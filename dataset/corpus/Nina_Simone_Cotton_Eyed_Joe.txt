If it hadn't been for cotton-eye Joe  
I'd been married long time ago  
Where did you come from? Where did you go?  
Where did you come from cotton-eye Joe?  
  
If it hadn't been for cotton-eye Joe  
I'd been married long time ago  
Where did you come from? Where did you go?  
Where did you come from cotton-eye Joe?  
  
He came to town like a midwinter storm  
He rode through the fields so  
Handsome and strong  
His eyes was his tools and his smile was his gun  
But all he had come for was having some fun  
  
If it hadn't been for cotton-eye Joe  
I'd been married long time ago  
Where did you come from? Where did you go?  
Where did you come from cotton-eye Joe?  
  
He brought disaster wherever he went  
The hearts of the girls was to hell broken sent  
They all ran away so nobody would know  
And left only men cause of cotton-eye Joe  
  
If it hadn't been for cotton-eye Joe  
I'd been married long time ago  
Where did you come from? Where did you go?  
Where did you come from cotton-eye Joe?
