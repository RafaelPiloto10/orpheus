Like an angel out of the sky you came  
Clearing up all the clouds  
Of sadness and the rain  
So pure you and healing was the love you bring  
I knew inside  
It felt so right  
  
For me, I've struggled, all my life  
To find that thing that makes it right  
With you it seems I may have found  
Some other kind of love  
  
I will, love you all my life  
Always be by your side  
And I will give you all I have  
Cause you gave me peace and joy  
Again, again, again  
  
I was scared to let go and trust your love  
After what I'd been through I have had enough  
Whispering through your eyes you never said a word  
But something said  
You're heart's safe  
  
For me, I've struggled, all my life  
To find that thing that makes it right  
With you it seems I may have found  
Some other kind of love  
  
I will love you all my life  
Always be by your side  
And I will give you all I have  
Cause you gave me peace and joy  
Again, again, again  
  
A friend is what you always have in me  
I'm so grateful for the man you turned out to be  
And it doesn't who you happen to meet  
You're forever me  
A secret part of me  
  
I will love you all my life  
Always be by your side  
And I will give you all I have  
Cause you gave me peace and joy  
Again, again, again
