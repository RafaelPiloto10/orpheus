I can feel sorry for my friends, they must be tired  
Of all the fuss that I've been making  
But since last night I'm feeling so inspired  
It's like a dream and I'm not waking  
If they could hear you whisper they'd agree  
It's more than a love song, it's a symphony  
  
It was that good, it was that right  
That chance you get once in your life  
The answer to the prayer my heart's been praying  
It was that real, it was that strong  
That feeling just can't be wrong  
I'd go on forever if I could  
It was that good  
  
Suddenly I'm saying things I've never heard  
My soul is doing all the talking  
If it was ordinary you wouldn't hear a word  
I'd keep it to myself and just keep walking  
  
But it's no secret what you've done to me  
There's no doubt in my mind girl, I believe  
The more I think about it  
Don't know how I lived without it  
It's given new life to me, to know you agree
