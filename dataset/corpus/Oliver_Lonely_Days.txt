Lonely days go on and on forever  
Like the memories of you in my mind  
No, I can't forget you now  
It's impossible  
'Cause I'll miss you more than now tomorrow  
  
Ooh  
Will these lonely days  
Will these lonely days  
Will these lonely days ever end?  
Ooh  
Will these lonely days  
Will these lonely days  
Will these lonely days ever end?  
  
Morning finds me staring in the mirror  
There's a stranger now who's looking at me  
Oh, how could you let her go, just walk away?  
What will you do each night, each lonely day?  
  
Ooh  
Will these lonely days  
Will these lonely days  
Will these lonely days ever end?  
Ooh  
Will these lonely days  
Will these lonely days  
Will these lonely days ever end?  
  
Morning finds me staring in the mirror  
There's a stranger now who's looking at me  
Oh, how could you let her go, just walk away?  
What will you do each night, each lonely day?  
  
Ooh  
Will these lonely days  
Will these lonely days  
Will these lonely days ever end?  
Ooh  
Will these lonely days  
Will these lonely days  
Will these lonely days ever...  
Ooh  
Will these lonely days  
Will these lonely days  
Will these lonely days ever end?  
Ooh  
Will these lonely days  
Will these lonely days  
Will these lonely days ever end?  
Ooh  
Will these lonely days  
Will these lonely days  
Will these lonely days ever end?  
Ooh  
Will these lonely days  
Will these lonely days  
Will these lonely days ever end?
