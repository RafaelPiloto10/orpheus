On a highway along the Atlantic I'm rifling through these last 17 years  
The radio waxes romantic, its lullabies fill our eyes with tears  
  
We don't say a word  
There's nothing to say that hasn't been heard  
And how you've grown my little bird  
I'm regretting letting you fly  
  
6 pounds and 7 ounces, a ball of bones and flesh and tears were you  
Now your hands, your tiny pink hands, grew larger than my hands ever grew  
  
We don't say a word  
There's nothing to say that hasn't been heard  
And how you've grown my little bird  
I'm regretting letting you fly  
I'm regretting letting you fly  
I'm regretting letting you fly  
  
On a highway, on a highway
