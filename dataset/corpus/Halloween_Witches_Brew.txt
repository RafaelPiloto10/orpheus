Dead leaves, seaweed, rotten eggs, too.  
Stir them in my witches' brew.  
I got magic, Alakazamakazoo.  
  
Spider web, moldy bread, mucky mud, too.  
Stir them in my witches' brew.  
I got magic! Alakazamakazoo  
  
Ooo - My witches' brew - ooo  
What's it gonna do to you?  
Boo!  
Floor wax, thumb tacks, purple paint, too.  
Stir them in my witches' brew.  
I got magic, Alakazamakazoo.  
  
Finger nails, lunch pails, apple cores, too.  
Stir them in my witches' brew.  
I got magic, Alakazamakazoo.  
  
Ooo - My witches' brew - ooo  
What's it gonna do to you?  
Boo!  
  
Wrinkled prunes, mushrooms, motor oil, too.  
Stir them in my witches' brew.  
I got magic, Alakazamakazoo.  
I got magic, Alakazamakazoo.
