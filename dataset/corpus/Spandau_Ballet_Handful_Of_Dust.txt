Your pressed your face against my heart  
I felt that you could look right through me  
We live in days that have no time  
We live in times that now refuse me  
And somewhere out beyond his town  
There lies a world that now can turn us round  
And we need it and we need it  
Oh, got to have some thing to believe in  
I've got enough to believe in you  
What can I give just to know that it's true?  
But I've gotta begin to say  
Now they've taken my pride in this way  
How can you give me your love?  
I just can't give you enough  
How can you give me your trust, ooh hoo  
With a handful of dust?  
I feel to thin before your eyes  
I feel so naked under open skies  
I once stood tall within this town  
But now the time has come to bring us down  
We must have more with his power in hand  
We must believe things will go as we planned  
But I've gotta begin to say  
Now they've taken my pride in this way  
How can you give me your love?  
I just can't give you enough  
How can you give me your trust, ooh hoo  
With a handful of dust, with a handful of dust ?  
Making love through electric skies  
Now I know where my fortune lies  
Breathe the air and feel this land  
'Cause it's slipping through me like dust from my hand  
How can you give me your love?  
I just can't give you enough  
How can you give me your trust, ooh hoo  
With a handful of dust?  
(How can you give me your love?)  
I just can't give you enough  
How can you give me your trust, ooh hoo  
With a handful of dust?  
(How can you give me your love?)  
How can you give me your love?  
Now give me your love  
(How can you give me your trust)  
Ooh hoo, hey, with a handful of dust?  
(How can you give me your love?)  
Give me  
(How can you give me your trust)
