Why do we do this c.g. and i?  
Every night vegetables,  
Minds numbed up by thc.  
I've got my pen, c.g. the remote.  
Laurel and hardy's the best bet at four a.m. on a friday  
No dreads about the working day after though.  
Funny thing about weekends when you're unemployed.  
They don't quite mean so much,  
Except you get to hang out with all youur working friends.  
Well we got us a spegetti western on 36.  
I like spegetti westerns  
I like the way the boots are all reverbed out  
Walking across the hardwood floors.  
In fact, everything's got  
That big reverb sound.  
Well what'll I do now?  
Go to sleep.  
Pull the pud.  
We need new pornos.  
Well, I guess I'm still writing...
