I know it's been a long road  
To get these towns behind me and I  
Will gladly reap what we may sow I am  
There for you and you're there for me  
  
Pictures and photographs  
Memories and windows  
Goodbyes and epitaphs  
Heartbeats and hellos  
  
[Chorus]  
Are you waiting for  
Heart in hand  
Woman and man  
See me where I stand I am  
Heart  
Heart in hand  
  
These fields may hold a hunting ground  
But the wolves are far behind me and I  
Hear the howls and the distant sound  
Of the messengers lost at sea  
  
Into the morning light  
Followed by madness  
Reach through the empty fight  
Searching through sadness  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know it's been a long road  
To get these fears behind me and I  
Will gladly reap what we may sow I am  
There for you and you're there for me  
  
Pictures and photographs  
Memories and windows  
Goodbyes and epitaphs  
Heartbeats and hellos  
  
Are you waiting for  
Heart in hand  
Woman, man  
You see me, where I stand  
I am, heart  
Heart in hand  
  
Heart in hand  
All for a woman  
And I am, and I am waiting  
Where I stand  
I am, heart  
Heart in hand
