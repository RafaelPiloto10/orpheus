You said you didn't know  
That the cats with the birds were there  
And you never go along with that kind of stuff no where  
But that just isn't the point man  
That's the wrong wrong way to go  
If you didn't know about that one, well then what else don't you know  
You said that you were lied to  
Well that ain't hard too see  
But you must have been fooled again by your friends across the sea  
And maybe you were fooled again by your people here at home  
Because nobody could talk like you  
And know what's going on  
Nobody elected your family  
And we didn't elect your friends  
No one voted for your advisers  
And nobody wants the men  
You're the one we voted for, so you must take the blame  
For handing out authority to men who were insane  
You say its all fixed up now, you've got new guys on the line  
But you had better remember this while you still got the time  
Mothers still are weeping for their boys that went to war  
Father still are asking what the whole damn thing was for  
And People still are hungry and people still are poor  
And on this week of work these days don't feed the kids no more  
Schools are still like prison  
'Cause we don't learn how to live  
And everybody wants to take, nobody wants to give  
Yes you will be remembered, be remembered very well  
And if I live a long life, all the stories I could tell  
A mans who falls in poverty of sickness and of grief  
Hell yes  
You will be remembered, be remembered very well  
You said you didn't know  
That the that the cats with the birds were there  
You'd never go along with that kind of stuff no where  
But that just isn't the point man  
That's the wrong ,wrong way to go  
You did
