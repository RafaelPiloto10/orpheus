I've dealt with my ghosts  
And I've faced all my demons  
Finally content with the past I regret  
I've found you find strength in your moments of weakness  
For once, I'm at peace with myself  
I've been burdened with blame  
Trapped in the past for too long  
I'm moving on  
  
I've lived in this place  
And I know all the faces  
Each one is different  
But they're always the same  
They mean me no harm  
But it's time that I face it  
They'll never allow me to change  
But I never dreamed home would end up where I don't belong  
I'm moving on  
  
I'm moving on  
At last I can see  
(Last I can see)  
Life has been patiently waiting for me  
And I know there's no guarentees  
But I'm not alone  
There comes a time in everyone's life  
When all you can see are the years passing by  
(The years passing by)  
And I have made up my mind  
That those days are gone  
  
I sold what I could  
And packed what I couldn't  
Stopped to fill up on my way out of town  
I've loved like I should  
But lived like I shouldn't  
I had to lose everything to find out  
Maybe forgiveness will find me somewhere down this road  
I'm moving on  
I'm moving on  
I'm moving on
