I was hungry you feed me  
Naked you clothed me  
They will know us by our love  
  
Can't imagine how it felt as layed there  
Through the dark through the heat through the cold  
With your friend by your side held his hand and watched him die  
And you cried as you prayed for his soul  
  
I can't imagine how it felt as you stood there  
Through the winds that would just not go away (um huh)  
  
Kiss my wife tell my son my work on earth is done  
You're the one that can still hear them say (ooh)  
  
Is there anybody out there listening  
And does anybody know my name

But we're here and we care  
And yes we feel your pain (ooh yes)  
And yes we feel your pain  
  
I can't imagine how you felt as you sat there  
Trying to hide the fear upond your face  
  
As the earth begins to cry and you ask the preacher why  
Tonight we can hear the children say (hear them say)  
  
Is there anybody out there listening  
And does anybody know my name (anybody)  
No my friend we were not there  
But we're here and we care  
And yes we feel your pain (ooh)

Can you stop the clock make this go away(make it do away)  
No the cross we can not bare but god can and he cares  
And yes he feels your pain (we can feel the pain)  
And yes he feels your pain  
  
And can anybody see because my faith is getting weak  
Don't know how much more I can take  
Hear my heart and please don't delay (lay)
