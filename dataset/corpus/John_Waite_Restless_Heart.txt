Three years come  
I'm still alone and you're so lonely  
I look in the mirror  
I see those lines on my face  
All of my dreams are gone  
Flyin' with the starlings  
But they were not stolen gems  
Colored glass I can replace  
You've got a restless heart  
Restless change is blowing  
Through your life  
Tears in your eyes  
Tears in the books that I've been reading  
I don't understand you now  
And I never did  
But I still love your restless heart  
Days into nights  
Nights into days  
Lights flicker 'round me  
And down to the shore I walk  
I'm haunted by your face  
Ungracious moves I've made  
Just like a broken dancer  
If I could get you back  
They are steps I would retrace  
You've got a restless heart  
Restless change is blowing through your life  
Tears in your eyes  
Tears in the books that I've been reading  
I don't understand you now  
And I never will  
But I still love your restless heart  
Three years come  
You're still alone and I'm so alone  
And I would give anything  
To feel my heart beat again  
I wouldn't say that I've been losin' time  
I've been dreaming  
And I'd give up anything to keep you as my friend  
You've got a restless heart  
Restless change is blowing through your life  
Tears in your eyes  
Tears in the books I've been reading  
I don't understand you now  
And I never did  
But I love you  
And I know you've got a restless heart  
(Restless heart)  
I know you've got a restless heart (in you)  
(Restless heart)  
I know (in you)  
You got a restless heart (heart)  
And I know it (in you)  
You got a restless heart (heart)  
You got a restless heart (in you)  
I know it (heart)  
But I'm just like you (in you)  
Just like you
