Only name Table Rogers a share man am I  
On a three-masted schooner from Twelingate Isle  
I've been the world over North, South, East and West  
But the middle of nowhere's where I likes it best  
  
Where it's wave over wave sea over bow  
I'm as happy a man as the sea will allow  
There's no other life for a sailor like me  
Than to sail the salt sea boys to sail the sea  
There's no other life but to sail the salt sea  
  
Well I leave my wife lonely ten months of the year  
For she built me a home and raised my children D'ere  
She never come out to bid farewell to me  
Or can why a sailor must sail the salt sea  
  
Where it's wave over wave sea over bow  
I'm as happy a man as the sea will allow  
There's no other life for a sailor like me  
Than to sail the salt sea boys to sail the sea  
There's no other life but to sail the salt sea  
  
Oh the work it is hard and the hours are long  
But my spirit is willing my back it is strong  
And when the works over the whisky will pour  
We'll dance with the girls upon some foreign shore  
  
I've sailed the world over for decades or more  
And oft times I wonder what I do it for  
I don't know the answer it's pleasure and pain  
But with life to live over I'd do it again  
  
Where it's wave over wave sea over bow  
I'm as happy a man as the sea will allow  
There's no other life for a sailor like me  
Than to sail the salt sea boys to sail the sea  
Where it's wave over wave sea over bow  
I'm as happy a man as the sea will allow  
There's no other life for a sailor like me  
Than to sail the salt sea boys to sail the sea  
There's no other life but to sail the salt sea  
Ohh ohhhh
