You spend my money  
You drink my best red wine  
You think it's funny  
To see me all the time  
Sitting with my head hanging down  
Treating me just like a clown  
You spend my money  
But come on honey don't waste my time  
  
When you get older  
You'll see what you have done  
You hung on my shoulder  
And loved me just for fun  
But some day when I'm older too  
I'm gonna come and make fool out of you  
You spend my money  
And honey  
You sure did waste my time  
  
You spend my money  
You drink my best red wine  
You think it's funny  
To see me all the time  
Sitting with my head hanging down  
Treating me like a clown  
You spend my money  
Come on honey don't waste my time
