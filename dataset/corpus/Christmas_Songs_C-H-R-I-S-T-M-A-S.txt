When I was but a youngster,  
Christmas meant one thing,  
That I'd be getting lots of toys that day.  
I learned a whole lot different,  
When my Mother sat me down,  
And taught me to spell Christmas this way:  
  
"C" is for the Christ child, born upon this day,  
"H" for herald angels in the night,  
"R" means our Redeemer,  
"I" means Israel,  
"S" is for the star that shone so bright,  
"T" is for three wise men, they who traveled far,  
"M" is for the manger where he lay,  
"A"'s for all He stands for,  
"S" means shepherds came,  
  
And that's why there's a Christmas day,  
And that's why there's a Christmas day
