Yes I know, 'fore you go, I'm gonna miss you  
A good piece of ass is hard to find  
Before you leave home, go out on your own  
I just  
Like to fuck you one more time  
  
One more time  
I'd like to stick my pecker in you  
Even if it's just a quickie  
I won't mind  
  
No I won't get your new white dress dirty, baby  
I just  
Like to fuck you one more time  
  
There is no need to cry, 'cause you're leavin'  
Your mother and me, we ain't blind  
We both knew someday, you'll go on your way  
And I just  
Like to fuck you one more time  
  
One more time  
I'd like to stick my pecker in you  
Even if it's just a quickie  
I won't mind  
  
No I won't get your new white dress dirty, baby  
I just  
Like to fuck you one more time  
  
Heaven knows that you've been a good daughter, baby  
And I just  
Like to fuck you one more time  
  
Lord I love even you call me dirty  
And I just  
Like to fuck you one more time  
One more time
