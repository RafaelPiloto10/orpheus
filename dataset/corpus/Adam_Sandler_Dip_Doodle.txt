Plus you gotta dip, you gotta doodle, you gotta eat Grandma's stroodle  
'Cause she stayed up all night to make it from scratch  
You gotta gish, you gotta gash, you gotta wax Grandma's mustache  
And lay out here socks and make sure they match  
Whoa, you gotta help out your Gram

You gotta libby, you gotta labby, you gotta hug Grandma even though she's

'Cause you should know Grandmas are people too  
Whoa, you gotta love your Gram  
  
Now if you listened to the words of this song  
You know they're coming straight from the heart  
Never make fun of your Grandma  
Even when she rips a juicy fart  
  
And remember to dip, you gotta doodle  
You gotta stop playing with your noodle  
'Cause Grandma said it will make you go blind  
You gotta gipper, you gotta giper, you gotta change Grandma's diaper  
And then pretend that you really didn't mind  
Whoa, respect to the Grandma
