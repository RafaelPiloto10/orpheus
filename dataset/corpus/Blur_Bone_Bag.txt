When you see in see you dancing  
Own reflection was never bent  
Be a man can shaking bone bag  
One day up is another down  
I don't want to hurt you, no not ever  
No not ever  
This is my street, I stay here and sleep  
You're outside on sunny days  
Nicotine flow stops a pain grow  
Stay a while, so nearly there  
I don't want to hurt you, no not ever  
No not ever  
This is my street I stay here and sleep  
You're outside on sunny days  
Be a man can shaking bone bag  
One day up is another day  
I don't want to hurt you, no not ever  
No not ever
