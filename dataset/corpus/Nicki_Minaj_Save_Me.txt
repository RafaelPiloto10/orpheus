I drove for miles just to find you and find myself  
Only screams all these voices in my head  
You gave me strength gave me hope for a lifetime  
I never was satisfied  
  
This time won't you save me, this time won't you save me  
Baby I can feel myself giving up, giving up  
This time won't you save me, this time won't you save me  
Baby I can feel myself giving up, giving up  
  
Giving up (giving up)  
Giving up (giving up)  
Giving up  
  
It's not your fault  
I'm a bitch, I'm a monster  
Yes I'm a beast and I feast when I conquer  
But I'm alone on my throne, all these riches  
I came this way all this way just to say eh  
  
This time won't you save me, this time won't you save me  
Baby I can feel myself giving up, giving up  
This time won't you save me, this time won't you save me  
Baby I can feel myself giving up, giving up  
  
Giving up (giving up)  
Giving up (giving up)  
Giving up  
  
I'm giving up baby yes I'm giving up baby  
It seems like I've been driving for miles  
Yes I'm giving up baby  
And I can't seem to silent these voices in my head  
This time won't you save me?  
Come save me  
This time won't you save me?  
Come save me  
  
This time won't you save me, this time won't you save me?  
Baby I can feel myself giving up giving up  
This time won't you save me, this time won't you save me?  
Baby I can feel myself giving up, giving up  
  
This time won't you save me, this time won't you save me?  
Baby I can feel myself giving up giving up  
Giving up
