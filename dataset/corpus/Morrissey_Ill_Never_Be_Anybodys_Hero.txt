Ill never be Anybody's hero-Morrissey  
  
Warm lights from the grand houses blind me  
Haves cannot stand have-nots  
And my love is under the ground  
My one true love is under the ground  
And I'll never be  
Ill never be  
I'll never be anybodys hero now  
Ill never be  
Ill never be  
Ill never be anybodys hero now  
They who should love me walk right through me  
I am a ghost and as far as I know  
I haven't even died  
And my love is under the ground  
My one true love is under the ground  
And I'll never be  
Ill never be  
I'll never be anybodys hero now  
Ill never be  
Ill never be  
Ill never be anybodys hero now  
Ill never be  
Ill never be  
Ill never be anybodys lover now  
Ill never be  
Ill never be  
Ill never be anybodys lover now  
Things I've heard and I've seen  
And I've felt and I've been  
Tell me I'll never be anybodys lover now  
It begins in the heart  
And it hurts when it's true  
It only hurts because it's true.
