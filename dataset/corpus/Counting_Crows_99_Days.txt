She said,  
"I wanna be the rain, I am a red balloon, I got a book of dates."  
She's gonna go away and leave me here tonight  
Some worlds last longer then others  
She's got a red balloon, she's gonna be the sky,  
I'm gonna paint my face tonight  
Hey 99 days out of San Francisco  
Headed for Berlin  
Hey 99 days left of California  
Headed with the wind  
If I sail across the water, I'll be floating blind, here beside the wild  
Monkey came alive, she's leaving me behind  
It's so hard to find  
She said,  
"I wanna be a plane, I am a red balloon, I'll never be the same  
And I'm gone, gone, gone on the wind."  
She said,  
"You'll never get away, you need a red balloon, you need a better day.  
This time, your headed home this time."  
Some trips last longer then others, she just said, "Good-bye."  
She just float away, I'm gonna die right here this time  
Some girls last longer then others,  
Too few red balloons, too little time tonight  
Hey 99 days out San Francisco  
Headed for Berlin  
Hey 99 days left of California  
Setting with the wind, home
