Down the end of this barroom,  
Out of sight of the light in the window.  
His mind in his whiskey  
And his body in a folding chair,  
Far beyond repair.  
I enter his vision,  
He watches me look for my seat.  
He makes his decision  
And he stands to his feet,  
Lord, it's a long way down.  
  
It happened to me, wonderful sight.  
Only for me, only for you.  
It happened to be a light shining through  
From one who was lost and found  
Just like me and you.  
  
Old man says, "Young man,  
My you're looking pretty green,  
Like a stranger to this kind of place.  
Come sit at my table,  
Come and look into my face,  
I've got a story to tell.  
There was a father and son,  
But that was a long time ago.  
And when the time came to run,  
I just couldn't say no  
So I left them behind."  
  
It happened to me, wonderful sight.  
Only for me, only for you.  
It happened to be a light shining through  
From one who was lost and found  
Just like me and you.  
  
We have seen it before  
In times of great sorrow  
That human compassion  
Will flow from a well  
That has long run dry.  
  
It happened to me, wonderful sight.  
Only for me, only for you.  
It happened to be a light shining through  
From one who was lost and found  
Just like me and you.
