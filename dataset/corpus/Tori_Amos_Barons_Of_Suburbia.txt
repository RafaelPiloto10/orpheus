Barons of suburbia take another piece of my good graces  
I'm in my war you're in yours  
Do we fight for peace as they take another piece of us  
But baby I would let your darkness invade me  
You could maybe turn this white light into navy  
Before you leave  
  
It was a slight miscalculation that my friends  
My friends would be waiting on the other side of the bridge  
On the other side of this  
This mole hill of a mountain  
This potion now a poison  
They're on the other side of right  
We're on the other side of her midnight  
  
When it's all said and done we will lose a piece  
To a carnivorous vegetarian  
Barons of suburbia I have heard you pray  
Before you devour her  
So baby will you let my darkness invade you  
You always liked your wafer sweet in the middle  
Before you leave  
  
It was a slight miscalculation that our friends  
Our friends would be waiting on the other side of the bridge  
On the other side of this  
This mole hill of a mountain  
This potion now a poison  
They're on the other side of right  
We're on the other side of her midnight  
  
I am piecing a potion  
To combat your poison  
  
She is risen  
She is risen  
Boys  
I said she is risen
