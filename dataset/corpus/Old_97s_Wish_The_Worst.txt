Why aren't you here? It's almost 4 a.m.  
I finished up all of your beer, now I'm startin' on your gin  
I went through your diary, flipped through your phone book  
Called all your friends, I just wanna know where you been  
I just wanna know where you been  
I pulled back your sheets, now I'm crawlin' in your bed  
Every drink's one more defeat and every footstep hurts my head  
I don't want excuses, I don't wanna hear that you were out with your friends  
I just wanna know where you been, I just wanna know where you been  
I hope you crash your momma's car  
I hope you pass out in some bar  
I hope you catch some kinda flu  
Let's say I wish the worst for you  
I hope you're happy with yourself  
I hope you found somebody else  
'Cause I ain't askin' you again  
I just wanna know where you been  
I just wanna know where you been  
Why am I here? I've got better things to do  
I could hang out on the pier down by the Hudson, sniffin' glue  
I guess I'm a looser, but I like being miserable, swimming in sin  
I just wanna know where you been, I just wanna know where you been  
I hope you crash your momma's car  
I hope you pass out in some bar  
I hope you catch some kinda flu  
Let's say I wish the worst for you  
I hope you're happy with yourself  
I hope you found somebody else  
'Cause I ain't askin' you again  
I just wanna know where you been  
I just wanna know where you been  
I just wanna know where you been  
I just wanna know where you been
