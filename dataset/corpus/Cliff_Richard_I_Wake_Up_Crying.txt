I wake up crying  
After tossin' and turnin'  
And a-yearnin' the whole night long  
Pretty baby since you went away  
I haven't spent a happy day  
  
I wake up crying  
After sobbin' and sighin'  
And a-wonderin' just what went wrong  
Pretty baby I was good to you  
Why'd you go and make me blue  
  
I need your arms to hold me tight  
I need your sweet lips to kiss me goodnight  
I'm so unhappy on my own  
Don't don't leave me sad and lonely  
  
I wake up crying  
After tossin' and turnin'  
And a-yearnin' the whole night long  
Pretty baby please come back to me  
Save me from this mesery  
Oh baby won'tcha save me from this mesery  
Please baby won'tcha save me from this mesery
