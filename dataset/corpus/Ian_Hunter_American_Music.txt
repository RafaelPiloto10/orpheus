I have a dream its only one dream  
But I know dreams can come true  
And I have a wish its only one wish  
But I know wishes can too  
  
I want to be-faraway from here  
With those honky tonk heroes burnin' my ears oh  
  
Love American music I play it all night long  
Just me n' records n' a vivid imagination  
I love to dance in the mirror I practice every single word  
And it seems to me American music is all I've ever heard  
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh its lonely on the underground  
I sit and watch my world go round n' round n' round n' round n' round  
I sit and watch the world go round  
  
I hear the sons of Memphis I hear the brothers or Harlem  
I hear the Nashville Cats n' the rag time mamas outta New Orleans  
I hear the Windy City I hear a gospel singers hymn and it seems to me  
American music is all there's ever been  
  
C'mon baby oh oh oh oh-oo-oo  
I love the names of the cities I hear the echo echoing  
And it seems to me American music is all there's ever been
