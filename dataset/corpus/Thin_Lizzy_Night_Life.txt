They say that the night life  
They say it ain't no good life  
But it's my life  
  
I've been a gambler  
I've been a thief  
And most of my good friends  
They don't hold with my belief  
  
They say that the night life  
They say it ain't no good life  
Oh but buy you know that it's my life  
  
And if you've had troubles  
If you've felt them woes  
I don't have to tell you  
How this whole world is so low  
  
Hey now baby  
It can drive you crazy  
Oh but baby  
Baby, the night life's for me  
  
Just one more time  
I'll hit the road  
And I want to thank you  
I want to thank the Lord  
  
For that old night life  
Some say it ain't no good life  
But baby, baby  
There ain't nothing like this night life
