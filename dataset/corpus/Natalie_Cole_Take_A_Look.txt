Take a look in the mirror, look at yourself  
But don't you look too close, cause you just might see the person  
That you hate the most, lord, what's happening to this human race  
I can't even see one friendly face,  
Brothers fight brothers and sisters wink their eyes  
  
While silver tongues bear fruits of poison lies,  
Take a look at your children  
Born innocent, every boy and every girl,  
Denying themselves a real chance  
  
To build a better world,  
Oh! dear lord what's happening to your precious dream  
I think it's washing away on a bloody, bloody stream,  
Yes, take a look at your children  
  
Before it's too late, and tell them nobody,  
Nobody wins when the prize is hate  
Oh, no, no, no it's not too late,  
We gotta tell all of our children  
That love, love, love is the way, yeah, yeah
