Crossing the mountains of truth see them  
Shadows of night disappear  
Rise from the slough of despond, find the pathway  
Guiding us forward through pastures of dream day  
Days to enjoy, peace I knew once before me  
Dawning to dusk on the hills until morning  
Come see me take my hand  
Come see me in my land  
Flying invisibly high, watch me  
All on a beautiful sky, I'll be  
Clear and serene in the love I've discovered  
Long search is over, the soul is uncovered  
Resting on joy that abounds without ceasing  
Bidding farewell to the fears now decreased  
Come see me take my hand  
Come see me in my land  
High on a golden crested wave she sits  
The little nymphs dance in her hair  
The trees all beckon to the sky to bless their empty lives  
Horizons come to sip wine there  
The veiled mist reveals the wandering ship upon the reef  
The albatross flies to the stern  
And only Jack Frost saw the kiss you gave him in return  
Crossing the mountains of truth see them  
Soaring majestically high, and then  
Stop at the warning light, see it flash brightly  
Thunder awakes me, it crashes beside me  
Shatter the scene and bring chaos to beauty  
Leading me forward where destiny may be  
Come see me take my hand  
View from another land
