When I see the moon, I hear the sound of the strip  
Just calling my name  
Just calling my name  
When I see the moon, I hear the sound of the strip  
Just calling my name  
Yeah, it's calling my name  
Man, I love the feel  
When I go out  
Dancing with the women at the bar  
Man I love the feel  
When I go out  
I always know my woman's close somewhere  
My daddy saw the moon, heard the sound of the strip  
Yeah, it called out his name  
Yeah, it called out his name  
My daddy saw the moon, and heard the sound of the strip  
Yeah, it called out his name  
And it called his son's name too  
Man I love the feel  
When I go out  
Dancing with the women at the bar  
Man I love the feel  
When I go out  
I always know my woman's close somewhere  
Close somewhere...  
When you see the moon, hear the sound of the strip  
Yeah, call out my name  
Yeah, call out my name  
And if you see the moon, or hear the sound of the strip  
Yeah, call out my name  
And call my friend's names too  
Man, I love the feel  
When I go out  
Dancing with the women at the bar  
Man I love the feel  
When I go out  
I always know my woman's close somewhere  
Close somewhere...
