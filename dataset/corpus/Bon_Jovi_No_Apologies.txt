No apology (no apology)  
We will not back down (no apology)  
We are not afraid (no apology)  
Not a drop of doubt  
  
Let's start this from the happy ending  
Just another white trash train-track kid  
Fighting for survival  
Trying not to do like his daddy did  
Double down the devil at three card monte  
No apology, he just knew when to quit  
Push your luck, say your prayers  
Make believe you don't care  
Take a chance, sometimes it's all you need  
  
(No apology)  
No apology (no apology)  
We will not back down (no apology)  
We are not afraid (no apology)  
Not a drop of doubt (no apology)  
Hand in hand across this land  
Our voices shouting out  
No apologies  
No apologies  
  
You wanna start a personal revolution  
Think of living somebody else's life  
You can lie about retribution  
But there ain't no fire in your lover's eyes  
  
Seems like everybody's selling you dreams 'round here  
But no one's buying and it's closing time  
Light the fuse, make your break, there's no time left to waste  
Baby just like freedom, nothin's free  
  
(No apology)  
No apology (no apology)  
We will not back down (no apology)  
We are not afraid (no apology)  
Not a drop of doubt (no apology)  
Hand in hand across this land  
Our voices shouting out  
No apologies  
  
You wanna start a personal revolution  
What else you gotta do tonight  
  
(No apology)  
No apology (no apology)  
We will not back down (no apology)  
We are not afraid (no apology)  
Not a drop of doubt (no apology)  
Hand in hand across this land  
Our voices shouting out  
No apologies  
(No apology)  
No apology  
(No apology)  
No apology  
Hand in hand across this land  
Our voices shouting out  
No apologies
