I like that though  
That's what's up  
  
Some people like the summer when it's hot  
  
Some people like the winter cold  
Some people speak their minds when they wanna  
And some other people ain't so bold  
Whatever it is that you do  
You should do you should do with your head held high  
So when you're doing you're thing it's cause you wanna  
And they never can ask you why  
  
1 I say  
Do what you do  
Say what you say  
Mean what you mean when you say  
Cause it's your life  
Gotta make your own rules  
And you gotta do it, do it your own way  
  
  
  
  
  
Repeat 1  
  
2 - Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Some like it easy when others they like it rough  
But ain't nobody gotta like it but you  
Girl, boy, boy, girl, girl, girl, boy, boy  
Whatever, you should do what you do  
How can they tell you that you could or should?  
Would or wouldn't  
Well ask 'em can they walk in your shoes  
Cause it's your life and you do what you wanna  
And remember baby it's all about you  
  
Repeat 1 (2x)  
  
Repeat 2  
  
3 - So if it's on your mind  
Then you should speak your piece  
And say what'cha say  
And if you want it done  
Then you should get it done  
And do it your way  
  
Repeat 3  
  
Repeat 1 (2x)  
  
Repeat 2 (2x)  
  
Repeat 1 till end
