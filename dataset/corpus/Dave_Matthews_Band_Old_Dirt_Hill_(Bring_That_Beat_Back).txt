Bring that beat back to me again  
Take me back, take me back, can't catch me can't catch me  
Bring that beat back to me again  
Take me back, take me back, can't catch me, can't catch me  
  
Ride my bike down that old dirt hill (can't catch me)  
First time without my trainin' wheels  
First time I kissed you I lost my legs (can't catch me)  
Bring that beat back to me again  
  
Screamin', shoutin', louder innocence  
Days when all we did would never end  
  
Bring that beat back to me again  
Take me back, take me back, can't catch me can't catch me  
Bring that beat back to me again  
Take me back, take me back, can't catch me can't catch me  
  
Smokin' on the railroad bridge  
I used to ride my bike down that old dirt hill  
The first time I kissed you I lost my legs  
Bring that beat back to me again  
  
Screamin', shoutin', louder innocence  
Days when all we did would never end  
  
Screamin' down that old dirt hill  
Bring that beat back to me again  
  
Oh when it gets hard  
That's when the days I remember seem so far  
When I was just a kid that's what I miss  
When I was just a kid that's what I miss  
Take me back, Take me back to that beat again  
  
Smokin' on the railroad bridge  
Bring that beat back to me again (again)  
Bring that beat back to me again (can't catch me)  
Bring that beat back to me again  
First time all we were was good friends  
Bring that beat back to me again  
Bring that beat back to me again  
Bring that beat back to me again (can't catch me)  
Bring that beat back to me again  
Bring that beat back to me again  
Bring that beat back to me again
