Way back when in sixty-seven  
I was the dandy  
Of Gamma Chi  
Sweet things from Boston  
So young and willing  
Moved down to Scarsdale  
And where the hell am I  
  
Hey Nineteen  
No we can't dance together  
No we can't talk at all  
Please take me along  
When you slide on down  
  
Hey Nineteen  
That's 'Retha Franklin  
She don't remember the Queen of Soul  
It's hard times befallen  
The Soul Survivors  
She thinks I'm crazy  
But I'm just growin' old  
  
Hey Nineteen  
No we got nothin' in common  
No we can't talk at all  
Please take me along  
When you slide on down  
  
The Cuervo Gold  
The fine Colombian  
Make tonight a wonderful thing  
  
We can't dance together  
No we can't talk at all
