Hello, good evening  
  
Came in here, shut the world out  
Nothing to get into, nothing to bein' bout  
Just grab a little bite, quite a little night  
By no means looking for Miss Right  
But hello, good evening  
  
Clearly she was out with her girls alone (That I could tell)  
Beautiful, barely any make-up on (So natural)  
The kind that make you wanna put the games away  
Think about the future, but first I'll say  
Hello, good evening  
  
Oh Miss Right, Miss Right  
What are you doing here?  
Oh Miss Right, wasn't expecting you tonight  
Oh Miss Right, Miss Right  
How about we disappear?  
Said if you got no plans, baby if you got time  
Come and be the rest of my life  
Oh, Miss Right, yeah  
  
But ain't it amazing?  
Spend forever looking, all the time wasting  
Soon as I throw my hands up and say I quit  
Turn the corner and there my future sits

What are you doing today? (What are you doin' baby)  
Wasn't expecting you tonight  
Oh Miss Right, Miss Right  
How about we disappear?  
Said if you got no plans, baby if you got time  
Come and be the rest of my life  
  
Please forgive if I'm forward , hmm  
But this chance won't pass me by  
'Cause, see, I'm looking at forever  
And it's the most beautiful thing I've seen in my life  
Ooh Miss Right  
  
Miss Right, what are you doing here? (So what are you doin' here baby)  
Wasn't expecting you tonight (I wasn't expecting you tonight, ohh)  
Miss Right, how about we disappear?  
Said if you got no plans, baby if you got time  
Come and be the rest of my life (The rest my life)
