Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go  
Anywhere He leads me in this world below  
Anywhere without Him dearest joy would fade  
Anywhere with Jesus I am not afraid  
  
[Chorus]  
Anywhere, anywhere ...any little fear I'll never know  
Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go  
  
Anywhere with Jesus, I am not alone  
Other friends may fail me, He is still my own  
Tho' His hand may lead me over dearest ways  
Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep  
When the darkening shadows round about me creep  
Knowing I shall waken nevermore to roam  
Anywhere with Jesus will be home, sweet home  
  
[Chorus]
