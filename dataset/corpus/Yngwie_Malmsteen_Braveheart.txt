Closing my mouth  
before I scream  
No-one can shake  
my self-esteem  
  
Whisper my name  
confuse my mind  
To me it's the same  
if I'll survive  
  
This game you can't win  
Who is free from sin  
I won't be afraid  
My soul will remain  
  
Go on and sleep  
the sleep of the just  
If your conscience is clean  
do what you must  
  
One day you will know  
I was a friend, not foe  
I won't be afraid  
My soul will remain  
Let go of your hate  
I won't be afraid  
  
I won't be afraid  
My soul will remain  
let go of your hate  
I won't be afraid, oh no...
