Sit down her by me, baby, let me hold your hand  
Listen to me, baby, try and understand  
I'm in misery, I'm in misery  
I'm all upset and I'm shook up as I can be  
Ya say you were out shakin', doin' the Go Go Go  
Sometimes I really wonder if you know  
I'm in misery, I'm in misery  
I'm all upser and I'm shook up as I can be  
You make me think you've got something up your sleeve  
You shake me up a little, then you up and leave me in  
Misery, I'm in misery  
I'm all upser and I'm shook up as I can be  
Now, let me tell you something that I learned in school  
You reap just what you sow, so, baby, someday you'll be in  
Misery, you'll be in misery  
You'll be all upser and shook up over losing me
