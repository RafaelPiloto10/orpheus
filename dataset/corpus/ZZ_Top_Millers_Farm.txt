Now here comes sundown  
And a Cadillac too  
Now here comes sundown  
And a Cadillac too  
The man was walking on his girlfriend  
Longshot, it could have been you  
Now somewhere down on Miller's Farm  
You're gonna have your day too  
You been stayin' out late nights  
You been going home alone  
You been stayin' out late nights  
You been going home alone  
The man gonna get you  
And gonna bring you to the farm  
Some day here down on Miller's Farm  
You're gonna have your day too  
Ever since I known you for a long, long time  
You can't be satisfied  
If you don't watch out what you're doing to yourself  
My man gonna take you for a ride, oh yeah  
Midnight and morning  
I seen you bringin' up them stairs  
Between midnight and morning  
I seen 'em bring you up them stairs  
They're calling for your [unverified]  
The maid don't catch you there  
Some day here down on Miller's Farm  
You're gonna have your day too
