Mama was a rock and roll singer yeah  
Papa used to write all her songs  
Well you could hear their music playing  
On the jukebox all day long  
  
Whoa They was bringing down together yes they is  
In a 2-Part harmony,  
Till one day, one day my daddy sang alone  
He sang his song just for me  
Good God  
  
You think you're just a fox  
And that's all that you got to be  
Oh well you might be a fox  
But lady that ain't enough for me  
You're jacking everybody in town  
But you ain't jacking me around  
  
[Chorus:]  
Foxy lady shining on  
I hope you miss me when I'm gone  
Coz foxy lady gone is where I'm gonna be  
  
You're super fine  
And you blow people's mind I know  
But will you pardon me please  
If I don't stick around for your show  
You got everybody chasing your tail  
They even let you put them in jail  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Oh damn you girl  
You went and messed up  
The world we had  
And what I'm trying to say  
In my own sweet way if I may  
You got everybody singing your tune  
But you're flying on a friendly balloon  
  
[Chorus:]
