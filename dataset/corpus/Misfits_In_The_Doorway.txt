Light  
In the doorway  
Shining so bright  
In the doorway  
I clench your hips  
For the flesh  
You tore my prose  
  
In the doorway  
Animal lie  
Like the doorway  
As you hide  
Hear it then  
Will you let me in  
  
Let me in  
Oh  
  
In the doorway  
We were so young  
In the doorway  
Release the black dogs  
On our breasts  
We'll never rest  
  
We'll never rest  
We'll never forget  
I ain't never gonna let you rest  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
