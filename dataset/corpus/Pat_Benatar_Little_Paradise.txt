Can you see the view? Can you feel the heat?  
I'm savin' no time for you, no time for me  
You're up on the news, I'm wild in the streets  
I'm under the lights, tonight I won't have to hide the need  
But you got love in its place  
In its own time and space  
You got love in its place in your  
Little Paradise  
  
You got fashion secure in your own little world  
Diamonds are forever for Hollywood girls  
No need to cover, no reason to lie  
Life without your Maserati is grounds for suicide  
  
But you got love in its place  
In its own time and space  
You got love in its place in your  
Little Paradise  
Little Paradise  
  
You got love in its place  
In its own time and space  
You got love in its place in your  
  
You got love in its place  
In its own time and space  
You got love in its place in your  
  
Little Paradise  
Little Paradise  
Little Paradise  
Little Paradise  
Little Paradise  
Little Paradise  
Little Paradise  
Little Paradise
