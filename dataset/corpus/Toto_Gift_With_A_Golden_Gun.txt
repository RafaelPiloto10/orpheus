It's a twelve o'clock depression, my mind is in recession  
And I can't answer you  
It's the day I can't remember, I think it's late September  
Or is it April blue  
  
I can't find peace of mind in a world so unkind  
It's just a little heart breaker, just a little heart breaker, yeah  
  
It's a sticky situation when I'm near hallucination, and I refuse to bow  
They used to think me funny when I promised them their money  
But they're not laughing now  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't find peace of mind, then she calls me just in time  
She's a gift with a golden gun, and she's got them on the run  
She's a gift with a golden gun, 'cause she knows what they've done  
  
Just what they've done, done, done, done, done  
What they've done, done, done, done, done  
Just what they've done, done, done, done, done
