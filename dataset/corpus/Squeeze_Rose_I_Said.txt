Yes I cried the moment that her hand slapped my face  
A mouth full of sandwich went all over the place  
She left like a tornado the door of course slammed  
I stood in the kitchen a very confused man  
The thump thump of her foot steps went right up the stairs  
The cat ran for cover to the living room chairs  
But what was the problem what on earth could be wrong  
To deserve a slapped face it all seemed far too strong  
  
Rose I said, heaven knows what we've done  
Rose I said, water flows under the bridge  
Rose I said, heaven knows is this love  
Rose I said, curtains close back to read the script  
  
Up to the bedside where she lay in tears  
The drawers were left half open, her clothes laying near  
A suitcase tipped sideways at the end of the room  
I swallowed my sandwich and picked up her boots  
She turned just like an actress, a glare came my way  
I said what's the matter, what have I done today  
She spat out the name of the girl across the road  
I'll never forget the way she flared her nose  
  
Rose was the girl who some days I'd drive to work  
She worked in the office as an articled clerk  
Sometimes we had lunch in the pub along the street  
There was nothing between us, just good company  
I admit that I liked her but that's all it was  
I stood at the bedside in a state of shock  
She heard it different from a friend she met today  
Who says she saw us kissing down an alleyway  
I felt like two people a Jekyll and a Hyde  
I'd really made my bed to lay in this time  
I picked with my tongue at the bread stuck in my teeth  
There through the window, her house on the street  
I knew I was guilty, I told myself to lie  
It seemed to make no differen
