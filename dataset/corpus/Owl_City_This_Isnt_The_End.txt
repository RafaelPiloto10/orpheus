[Intro]  
An 8 year old girl had a panic attack  
Cause the father she loved left and never looked back  
No longer the hero, she counted on  
He told her he loved her and then he was gone  
  
[Verse 1]  
She tried to look happy in front of her friends  
But knew that she'd never feel normal again  
She fought back the tears as they filled her eyes  
And wanted him back just to tell him goodbye  
  
[Chorus]  
When the rain falls down  
When it all turns around  
When the light goes out this isn't the end  
  
[Verse 2]  
Her dad was a good guy that everyone liked  
But nobody knew he was dying inside  
He promised his family he'd be all right  
And then with a gunshot he left them behind  
  
[Chorus (x2)]  
When the rain falls down  
When it all turns around  
When the light goes out this isn't the end  
  
[Verse 3]  
The role of a father, he never deserved  
He abandonned his daughter and never returned  
And over the years though the pain was real  
She finally forgave him, and started to heal  
  
[Bridge]  
How close to the ending? Well, nobody knows  
The future's a mystery and anything goes  
Love is confusing and life is hard  
You fight to survive cause you made it this far  
  
[Outro]  
It's all too astounding to comprehend  
It's just the beginning this isn't the end  
It's just the beginning this isn't the end
