Look out!  
Mama let me out on a Saturday night, she said now  
Go out and get her go and hold her tight  
I said now Mama, you don't understand  
Ev'ry time I touch her hand  
It's like I'm burning in the fires of hell  
And if I hold her too long  
You never can tell what'll happen to me  
I wouldn't want you to see  
  
Look out  
She's a hell raiser, star chaser, trail blazer  
Natural born raver, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
She's a hell raiser, star chaser, trail blazer  
Natural born raver, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Look out!  
  
She's like a live bomb shell  
Like a flash out of hell  
And when she's shaking her ooh  
Everyone fell at her feet  
And that's neat and she took me completely  
By surprise with her ultra sonic eyes  
That were flashing like hysterical danger signs  
That said beware where you tread  
Or you'll go out of your head  
  
Look out  
She's a hell raiser, star chaser, trail blazer  
Natural born raver, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
She's a hell raiser, star chaser, trail blazer  
Natural born raver, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Look out!  
  
Hell raiser, hell raiser, hell raiser  
Hell raiser, hell raiser, ooh  
Now Mama, you don't understand  
Ev'ry time I touch her hand  
It's like I'm burning in the fires of hell  
And if I hold her too long  
You never can tell what'll happen to me  
I wouldn't want you to see
