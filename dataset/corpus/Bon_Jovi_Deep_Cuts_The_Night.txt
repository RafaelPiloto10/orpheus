I've been waitin' for this scene to end  
I don't need somebody baby, I need a friend  
I work all day just like doin' time  
I've stood tall through the fires of hell  
And I've walked through enemy lines.  
  
So now you've gone and built a wall around you  
Its gonna take a heart to knock it down too.  
Deep cuts the night, when you're without love  
Deep cuts the night, when you're without love  
Deep cuts the night, and it's bringing me down, it's bringing me down  
  
If I could be the hero in your masquerade,  
I could sweep you off your feet and take you far away.  
There ain't no saviors in the real world,  
There's only broken hearts and souls for you and me girl.  
  
Now you've gone and built a wall around you  
It's gonna take a heart to knock it down too.  
Deep cuts the night, when you're without love  
Deep cuts the night, when you're without love  
Deep cuts the night, when you're without love  
Deep cuts the night, well it's bringing me down  
  
So load your guns and fire away,  
All it takes is one fair shot to blow your world away.  
  
Deep cuts the night, when you're without love  
Deep cuts the night, when you're without love  
Deep cuts the night, and it's bringin' me down, it's bringin' me down
