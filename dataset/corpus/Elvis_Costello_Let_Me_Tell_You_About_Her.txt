I wasn't very indiscreet and yet  
That is a notion that I might as well forget  
Friends look at me these days with fond surprise  
But when I start to speak they roll their eyes  
  
Let me tell you about her  
Hush now, I've said too much  
There's something indescribable I can't quite catch  
Let me tell you about her  
The way that she makes me feel  
Then draw a curtain on this scene I shan't reveal  
  
Some things are too personal  
Too intimate to spill  
And gentlemen don't speak of them  
And this one never will  
  
I wasn't very conversational  
Accept to say that, "You're sensational"  
Friends now regard me with indulgent smiles  
But when I start to sing they run for miles  
  
Let me tell you about her  
Hush now, I've said too much  
There's something indescribable I can't quite catch  
Let me tell you about her  
The way that she makes me feel  
Then draw a curtain on this scene I shan't reveal
