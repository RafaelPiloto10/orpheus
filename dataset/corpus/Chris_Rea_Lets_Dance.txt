When you sing of the joy only love can bring  
Heaven knows it's in my heart and my soul  
We're caught in a world full of tears  
So many bad times and fears  
So while there's a chance and you're near  
  
Let's dance  
Let's dance  
  
There's a world far away from the one we see  
There's a dream I will never let go  
One thing is certainly true  
This moment's for me and for you  
So while there's not a thing that we can do  
  
Well, Let's dance  
Let's dance
