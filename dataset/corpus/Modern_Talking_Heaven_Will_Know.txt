When I'm down, feeling blue  
I close my eyes, oh just to be with you  
I'm a dreamer and you know  
You're my woman and I'll never go  
God put an angel here on earth  
Who gave me more than all I'm worth  
You're my angel in the night  
In the darkness you're the light  
  
Heaven will know, oh heaven will know  
My love will grow baby  
Heaven will know  
That I need you so  
I can't say, goodbye lady  
  
Heaven will know  
That I'll never let go  
And I'm stay until my heart stand still  
No matter what baby  
Feel what you want  
Heaven sent me an angel  
Heaven sent me a star  
  
And it's more, than a passing phase  
And it's more, than a good night's day's  
And it's more, than you'll ever know  
And you'll never be alone
