Where is she going - ooh, she looks like she's lost  
Won't someone help her - somebody give her a hand  
She's got such sweet eyes - look like they've seen too much  
Knew someone like here - nobody helped, but she's  
Home again...Home again...Home again  
Where are you going - to see a crazy old man  
What will he tell you - he'll tell me where I'm going  
What will you do then - I might just quit my job  
What will you do then - I'm gonna find my way  
Home again...Home again...Home again  
(Chorus)  
(Where're we going, where're we going, Home again,  
We're home again, we're home)  
Where is he going - why does he walk that way  
Sticking his chest out - what is he trying to say  
He's got charisma - but when he's all alone  
He curls up in a ball - and wishes that he was  
Home Again...Home Again...Home Again  
Where are we going - why do we feel so small  
Alone and helpless - in this big crazy world  
Looking for something - that's so hard to describe  
But just like children - going along for the  
Ride again...Ride again...Ride again  
(Chorus)  
Well, ain't that something - guess I lost my head  
Must have took a wrong turn - when I got out'a bed  
Ended up on the wrong street - wrong side of town  
People here are the wrong type - they've got me down  
I'm eating the wrong food - drinkin' the wrong wine  
Can't hardly see straight - can't walk the line  
Shakin' all the wrong hands - makin' the wrong talk  
Steppin' on the wrong feet - every time I walk  
(Chorus)
