[Ed Lover]  
Ultramagnetic mc's  
I remember the first time I ever seen ultramagnetic, at Latin quarter  
  
[Kool Keith]  
Yeah!  
It's time to come out and give the people something they can understand  
Something not too complicated (cated)  
You know what we goin' do?  
We goin' bring it down to earth (earth)  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
Bring it down to earth, I don't understand!  
  
[Kool Keith]  
Mega bomb ignite, super reflection  
Power ignites the fourth horseman, turbo  
I kick styles like data, computer reading  
Miles away to beam star trek  
Moving my style up, optimus level 4  
I get it warp speed, youse on my space tour  
Get with the elements, eloquent spacecraft  
Change my gamma flow, one-three-eight-seven  
Twenty-oh-nine-six, cereal silver seven  
I got the skills to rap, so what you want spock?  
Style like captain kirk, gamma ray one block  
Particle leading out, rock the way intercourse  
Damaging animals, a lady with menopause  
Rising at one speed, altitude x be  
We need some gas or fuel, yo come in major!  
I'm just a level or pinch, I'm hitting new york  
Flying with ced, I see the other world  
I need some gas, yo Jim, I gotta come down  
Perimeter's reading we might crash!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Kool Keith]  
I know you out there and y'all understand  
But I'ma let Ced get on and tell y'all what it's really like  
It's not so complicated  
But connect with me and y'all follow me right on through!  
  
[Ced Gee]  
Yo  
Ultra power flowing, get ready for centron  
React with the digital, kicks like loose bombs  
High tech C-spects, hit data brain checks  
Sounding like john ?, time's up brain test  
Info storm, locked
