Don't know why  
It's the strangest thing  
It's no lie  
Don't know what's happening  
  
And I know that you know that  
It's a matter of fact  
I know that you know that  
It's a matter of fact  
  
Don't want to stay  
But I don't want to go  
Don't want to say it  
But you already know  
  
And I know that you know that  
It's a matter of fact  
I know that you know that  
It's a matter of fact  
  
Tell me now  
What is that thing you do?  
Tell me how  
I keep thinking of you?  
  
'Cause I know that you know that  
It's a matter of fact  
I know that you know that  
It's a matter of fact  
  
If it's gone  
Come out and say it  
Don't go on  
Living in make believe  
  
'Cause I know that you know that  
It's a matter of fact  
I know that you know that  
It's a matter of fact  
  
I know that you know that  
I know that you know that  
I know that you know that  
I know that you know that  
  
I know that you know that  
It's a matter of fact  
I know that you know that  
It's a matter of fact  
  
I know that you know that  
I know that
