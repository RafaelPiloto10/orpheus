You came smilin' softly, shyly movin'  
Easy as a dreamer into my room  
And before I realized the danger  
I found myself looking into your eyes  
Somewhere in their colors I saw promises  
Of things I'd never seen before  
It's all over  
I've got to have you  
  
Holding onto, talking, saying nothing  
Knowing in a moment I could lose you  
Then without a warning I remembered that  
You trembled at the touch of my hand  
Knowing when you came to me that no one else  
Would ever feel the same in my arms  
It's all over  
I've got to have you  
  
Wakin' in the morning to the tenderness  
Of holding you asleep in my arms  
Dreaming while my hair was blowing  
Softer than a whisper on my cheek  
I don't know the feeling so I don't know if it's love  
But it's enough  
It's enough  
I can't help it  
I've got to have you  
It's all over  
I've got to have you
