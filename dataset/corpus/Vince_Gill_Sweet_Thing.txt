I'd be out runnin' most every night  
We'd always wind up in one hell of a fight  
The end is comin' there ain't no doubt  
But there's just that one thing I can't live without  
  
I won't try to stop you  
I can't change your mind  
It's been nice to know you  
Could you leave that sweet thing behind?  
  
You take the dishes, the silverware  
Well, I'll keep the hound dog and this easy chair  
Keep the Ranchero but that TV is mine  
She said, "You can stick that clicker where the sun don't shine"  
  
I know you're leaving  
I can't change your mind  
It's been nice to know you  
Could you leave that sweet thing behind?  
  
Well, that woman was real mean  
My trailer park drama queen  
I'm gonna have bad dreams  
About missing that sweet thing  
Oh Lord, I don't know what I am gonna do  
  
Why's a tornado like a redneck divorce?  
Either way somebody's bound to lose a mobile home of course  
Well, that's my story, it's sad but true  
I've only got one request of you  
  
I know you're leaving  
I can't change your mind  
It's been nice to know you  
Could you leave that sweet thing behind  
  
Well, I know you're leaving, baby  
I can't change your mind  
It's been nice to know you  
Could you leave that sweet thing behind?
