Just jealousy, my jealousy  
Is what you see doing me  
Jealous of me, such jealousy  
It shouldn't be - leave me alone  
  
Time is running out, out runs the time  
I waste it on my own  
But don't think I'm alone  
Oh no, not again, I won't reply  
I can't stay on the phone  
I'll see you back at home  
I really did think that problem was solved  
But it is not  
  
Just jealousy, my jealousy  
Is what you see doing me  
Jealous of me, such jealousy  
It shouldn't be - leave me alone  
  
I've got another one, listen to me  
And don't get all hung on  
To things I have done wrong  
Oh no, not again, I won't reply  
It's only how I feel  
It sometimes seems unreal  
But everyone gets there once in a while  
Are you wishing?  
  
Just jealousy, my jealousy  
Is what you see doing me  
Jealous of me, such jealousy  
It shouldn't be - leave me alone  
Just jealousy, my jealousy  
Is what you see doing me  
Jealous of me, such jealousy  
It shouldn't be - leave me alone ....
