You're burnin' my heart  
You're burnin' my mind  
You're spoilin' my art  
You're wasting my time  
No taste in your actions  
No taste in your line  
No tears now...  
Just don't do you ever mind  
  
You say you want to be a superstar  
You're givin' up half to get that far  
You say you want to ride a diamond car  
But i don't like your fancy car  
  
Hey hey hey, don't you want to see  
I'm not your steppin' stone  
Hey hey hey, i've gotta be free  
So leave my life alone  
So leave my life alone  
So leave my life alone  
  
You're in love with success  
You're spilling my wine  
No part of my address, babe  
Your ways aren't mine  
You may got the money  
But your wastin' my life  
I'm not your bugs bunny  
And you're not my wife  
  
You say you only do it for affect  
But you don't want to see what i detest  
I think you're depraved  
I'm gonna leave you so  
But you can't see what i see so let me go  
  
Hey hey hey, don't you want to see  
I'm not your steppin' stone  
Hey hey hey, i've gotta be free  
So leave my life alone  
So leave my life alone  
So leave my life alone  
  
Hey hey hey, don't you want to see  
I'm not your steppin' stone  
Hey hey hey, i've gotta be free  
So leave my life alone  
So leave my life alone  
So leave my life alone  
  
Hey hey hey, don't you want to see  
I'm not your steppin' stone  
Hey hey hey, i've gotta be free  
So leave my life alone  
So leave my life alone  
So leave my life alone
