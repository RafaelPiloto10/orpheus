I could give you a dozen  
Fresh  
Cut  
Pink, or red, or white  
I wonder if they knew what they  
Would grow to become

You'll have to cut it down  
And burn me into splinters  
Or I'll unwrap the string  
That was me  
Around your finger  
And I'll hang you in  
Your bedroom burial ground  
  
There is a taste for blood  
And it's something deep inside  
There is a taste for blood  
And it's deep inside  
  
Become become  
Become become  
Be be become  
Become become  
Become become  
Be be become  
  
I don't ever want god  
To hear our screams  
And mistake them for prayers  
And you know I'm loaded  
But not which chamber  
Touch me and I'll go  
Click click click click click  
Click click click click click  
Click click click click click  
  
There is a taste for blood  
And it's something deep inside  
There is a taste for blood  
And it's deep inside  
  
Become become

Be be become  
Become become  
Become become  
Be be become  
  
And you know I'm loaded  
But not which chamber  
Touch me and I'll go  
Click click click click click  
Click click click click click  
Click click click click click  
  
I'm born villain  
Don't pretend to be a victim  
I'm born villain  
Don't pretend to be a victim  
I'm born villain  
Don't pretend to be a victim  
I'm born villain  
Don't pretend to be a victim
