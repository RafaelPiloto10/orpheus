Come on in and take me on an override  
Been stuck inside and up all night at Dave's  
Now trouble's far away, and mother in her cage  
And nothings gonna pinch this nerve of mine  
  
I want to make it right  
  
Close the door and pull the shades  
And climb the walls  
Feel medicine heal the lines of age  
I'm here and now I'm gone  
I'm there and far beyond  
And nothing's gonna pinch this nerve of mine  
Nothing's gonna pinch this nerve of mine  
  
I want to make it right  
  
I'm on the wire over and higher  
Over the pretense over the (spire) why  
On and connected I'm over floating now  
I'm over floating alone  
  
Hold the potion up  
Tear your shadow down  
Remember to forget and then rename your shame  
  
I want to make it right  
  
I'm on the wire over and higher  
Over the pretense over the (spire) why  
On and connected I'm over floating now  
I'm over floating alone
