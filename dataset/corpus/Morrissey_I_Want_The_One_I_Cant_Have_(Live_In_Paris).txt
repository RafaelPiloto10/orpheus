On the day that your mentality  
Decides to try and catch up with your biology  
Please come round because I want the one I can't have  
And it's driving me mad, it's all over, all over, all over my face  
  
On the day that your mentality  
Catches up with your biology  
I want the one I can't have  
And it's driving me mad, it's all over, all over, all over my face  
  
A double bed and a stalwart lover for sure  
These are the riches of the poor  
A double bed and a stalwart lover for sure  
These are the riches of the poor  
  
And I want the one I can't have  
And it's driving me mad, it's all over, all over my face  
  
A tough kid who sometimes swallows nails  
Raised on prisoner's aid  
He killed a policeman when he was thirteen  
And somehow that really impressed me  
It's written all over my face  
  
These are the riches of the poor  
These are the riches of the poor  
I want the one I can't have  
And Jesus it's driving me mad, it's written all over my face  
  
On the day that your mentality  
Catches up with your biology  
And if you ever need self validation  
Just meet me in the alley by the railway station  
It's all over my face, oh yes, oh
