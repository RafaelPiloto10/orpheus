Who are you and who am I  
Except a couple of people  
Wasting lots of time  
Worrying about the future  
Forever asking why  
Some people go on living  
While others die before their time  
Yet there's never been a reason  
Whatever is is right  
If only just because  
Its much too big a fight  
Like the painter who is way ahead  
Or worse still far behind  
You only punch yourself out  
When you start swinging blind  
These are the things too often gone unsaid  
These are the things that keep  
You better off than dead  
These are the things that keep running through your head  
  
These are the things too often gone unsaid  
Who are you and who am I  
Except a couple of people  
With nothing else to do  
But follow vain obsessions  
Making gestures towards the truth  
While trying to ignore it  
When its convenient to  
The symbols we believe in  
Sometimes turn inside out  
Reshaping each dimension  
Were so sure about  
Dreams get so frustrated  
Fantasies turn pranks  
A simple ounce of common sense  
Is money in the bank.
