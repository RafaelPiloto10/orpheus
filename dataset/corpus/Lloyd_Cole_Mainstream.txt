When am I ever going to kick the curse?  
I took my medication I feel worse  
Swimming is easy when you're stuck in the middle of the Mississippi  
All you have to do is crawl  
Fifteen years a big shot in a one horse town  
Riding the elevator shafts with your hip flask and your sun bed tan  
You were born stupid mister you were born cheap  
All you have to do is crawl  
When are you ever going to see sense?  
I kick it in and you spit it right out again  
Swimming is easy when you're headed for the deep  
All you have to do is  
All you have to do is crawl  
One for the money baby two for the money  
Get back in that elevator Jack eat up your milk and honey  
Guess you were born lucky mister ain't life sweet?  
All you have to do is crawl  
When are you ever going to see sense?  
I kick it in and you just spit it right out again  
Swimming is easy when you're stuck in the middle of the Mississippi  
All you have to do is  
All you have to do is crawl
