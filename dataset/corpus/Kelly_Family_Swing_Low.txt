Swing low sweet chariot  
  
Coming for to carry me home  
  
Swing low sweet chariot  
  
Coming for to carry me home  
  
A band of Angels coming after me  
  
Coming for to carry me home  
  
Swing low sweet chariot  
  
Coming for to carry me home  
  
If you get there before I do  
  
Coming for to carry me home  
  
Jess tell your friends  
  
That I'm coming too  
  
Coming for to carry me home  
  
Swing low sweet chariot  
  
Coming for to carry me home  
  
I'm sometimes up and sometimes down  
  
But stills my sould feels heavenly bound  
  
Coming for to carry me home
