His letter came this morning  
C.O.D.  
Says he's found somebody  
Who reminds him of me  
He says he needs some space  
  
That might be the case  
Wasn't even man enough  
To tell me to my face  
I got the rompin', stompin'  
Bad news blues  
  
He stole my money  
He stole my time  
When he stole my heart  
Honey, he really crossed that line  
  
A major felony  
Send out an A.P.B.  
Go tell that thief of hearts  
To bring it on back to me  
  
I got the rompin', stompin'  
Bad news blues  
  
Well, come tonight  
I'm steppin' out  
Gonna sing and dance  
Gonna shake and shout  
  
Forget about ol' what's his name  
You know two can play this game  
Whatever it takes to lose  
These rompin', stompin'  
Bad news blues  
  
Well, men are full of trouble  
Girl, that ain't nothin' new  
We ain't found nothin' better  
And until the day we do  
  
Sister friend, be wise  
Just realize  
Stay away from the ones  
Who'll do you wrong and tell you lies  
  
They'll give you the rompin', stompin'  
Bad news blues  
  
That's right  
They'll give you the rompin', stompin'  
Bad news blues
