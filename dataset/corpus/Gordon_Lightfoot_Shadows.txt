Won't you reach out, love and touch me  
Let me hold you for awhile?  
I been all around the world  
Oh, how I long to see you smile  
There's a shadow on the moon  
And the waters here below  
Do not shine the way they should  
And I love you just in case you didn't know  
Let it go  
Let it happen like it happened once before  
It's a wicked wind and it chills me to the bone  
And if you do not believe me  
Come and gaze upon the shadow at your door  
Won't you lie down by me, baby  
Run your fingers through my hands?  
I been all around the town  
And still I do not understand  
Is it me or is it you?  
Or the shadow of a dream?  
Is it wrong to be in love?  
Could it be the finest love I've ever seen?  
Set it free  
Let it happen like it happened once before  
It's a wicked wind and it chills me to the bone  
And if you do not believe me  
Come and gaze upon the shadow at your door  
Please kiss me gently, darling  
Where that river runs away  
From the mountains in the spring time  
On a blue and windy day  
Where there's beauty all around  
As the shades of night grow deep  
When the morning stars grow dim  
They will find us in the shadows fast asleep  
Let it go  
Let it happen like it happened once before  
It's a wicked wind and it chills me to the bone  
And if you do not believe me  
Come and gaze upon the shadow at your door
