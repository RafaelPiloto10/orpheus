Drive into the sky until  
It turns the afternoon black  
Halfway across the state on the day  
We set the clocks back, yeah  
And I don't know where I'm going  
I follow broken yellow lines  
And I hope this open road  
Could read my broken mind  
  
This wouldn't be the first day  
You left me thirsty  
This wouldn't be the first day  
You went your way, left me empty, dry  
  
Living in the dark and it's  
Turned your heart black  
Halfway to the moon since you  
Took your nights back  
Well I was finished being cool  
I'd unmasked this masquerade  
And you leave me here to clean up  
All this mess you've made?  
  
This wouldn't be the first day  
You left me thirsty  
This wouldn't be the first day you  
Went your way and left me empty  
  
This wouldn't be the first day  
You left me thirsty  
This wouldn't be the first day you  
Went your way, left me empty, dry  
  
This wouldn't be the first day  
You left me thirsty  
This wouldn't be the first day you  
Went your way, left me empty, dry
