I freed my mind in the oxygen tent  
Sold my ass, now my trousers fit again, yeah yeah  
I blew my stash on hallucinogens  
You love my song, well I don't know what it means, no  
  
Man I need t.v.  
For when I got my morrissey  
Have you seen the future of rock and roll  
(Have you seen the future of rock and roll)  
Have you seen the future of rock and roll  
(Have you seen the future of rock and roll)  
  
All my friends do the model girl thing  
So I found one, now she wears my nose ring  
She's really beautiful  
But she's hung up on the chelsea kid  
And I'm a renaissance man but she just can't dig it, no  
  
Man I need t.v.  
For when I got my morrissey  
Have you seen the future of rock and roll  
(Have you seen the future of rock and roll)  
Have you seen the future of rock and roll  
(Have you seen the future of rock and roll)  
  
Do you believe that the war is really over  
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)  
Do you believe your coast is really clear  
And your batteries clean, do you know  
  
Come on, yeah yeah yeah  
Na na na na na na na na  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Na na na na na na na na  
Yeah yeah yeah  
(Have you seen it, have you seen it)  
Na na na na na na na na  
(Have you seen the future of rock and roll)  
Yeah yeah yeah  
(have you seen it, have you seen it)  
Na na na na na na na na  
(Have you seen the future of rock and roll)
