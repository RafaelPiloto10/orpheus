Elves, elves, elves  
Elves, elves, elves  
Elves, elves, elves  
  
Santa doesn't shop at Toys "R" Us  
Doesn't have to fight the Christmas rush  
He's never out of stock of even the hardest toys and games  
It's easy  
  
Nothing in his sack he really made  
No one gets forgotten Christmas day  
So if you wanna know how he gets it done in the knick of time  
It's easy  
  
All you need is elves  
That's us!  
All you need is elves  
The little people.  
All you need is elves, Love  
Elves are all you need  
  
Toys "R" Elves  
All toys are made by elves.  
Elves, elves, elves  
There's nothing we can't make.  
Elves, elves, elves  
Do you have any idea how hard it is to make a 64-bit video system out of wood?  
  
Ho, ho, let me tell you, it ain't easy.  
  
No kidding!  
  
Tell me about it!  
  
All you need is elves  
All you need is elves  
We're non-union labor.  
All you need is elves, Love  
Elves are all you need  
  
Nothing you can know not much is known  
Cause no one's ever caught one in his home  
They're never really seen but that doesn't mean that they're make believe  
They're teensy  
Hey! Watch where you're stepping, you big freak!  
  
All you need is elves  
All you need is elves  
We're too short for Space Mountain.  
All you need is elves, Love  
Elves are all you need  
Elves are all you need  
Elves are all you need  
Elves are all you need  
Elves are all you need...  
  
He loves you, ho, ho, ho.  
He loves you, ho...
