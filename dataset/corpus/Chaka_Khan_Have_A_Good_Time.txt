Chorus:  
Have a good time, yeah  
Have a good time, yeah  
Have a good time, yeah  
Have a good time, yeah  
  
Who said this party's over?  
When I feel like my fun has just begun  
Together we will raise this roof and party  
And have a good time, yeah  
Have a good time, oh yeah  
All we need is some funky music  
So we can play the part and get way down  
Into some rhythm we can groove to  
Have a good time, yeah  
Have a good time, yeah
