If this is our last dance  
Let's take it slow-owly  
Let's let our hearts break  
Just for old time's sake  
For old time's sake  
  
I don't want to be the one  
To say the night is over  
I don't want to be the one  
To say goodbye  
Let's face the music  
There's no turning back  
Just take my hand  
  
If this is our la-a-a-ast dance  
Let's take it slow-owly  
Let's let our hearts break  
Just for old time's sake  
For old time's sake  
  
Baby let me waltz away  
The memories of hard times  
Let me wipe away  
The tears from your eyes  
Can we be tender  
Just one more time  
We have tonight  
  
If this is our la-a-a-ast dance  
Let's take it slow-owly  
Let's let our hearts break  
Just for old time's sake  
For old time's sake  
  
For old time's sake (For old time's sake)  
Let me walk you home to your door  
For old time's sake (For old time's sake)  
Let's have one more night together  
For old time's sake (For old time's sake)  
Let me waltz you around across the floor  
For old time's sake (For old time's sake)
