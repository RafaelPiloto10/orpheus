She said, "Tell me what it's all about." I said "Why, why, why?  
It's just something you could do without. You better try, try try."  
She said, "I can't reach you on the telephone.  
I can't call you when you're not at home.  
You keep saying that you're all alone.  
That's a lie, lie, lie."  
  
[Chorus:]  
Bad advice had me down and undone. Got to try again to believe in myself.  
Look at me, I'm alone in the end. Can you see me falling, falling down.  
I said, "Mama can you get it straight?" She said "Why, why, why?"  
-"I want to tell you that it just can't wait, so let's try, try, try"  
She said, "I don't care where you might have gone.  
I don't care 'cause you've done me wrong.  
You been doin' it far too long,  
So goodbye, bye, bye."  
  
[Chorus]  
She said "Tell me what it's all about." I said, "Why, why, why?  
It's just something you can do without. You better try, try, try."  
"I can't reach you on the telephone. I can't call you when you're not at home  
You keep saying that you're all alone. That's a lie, lie, lie.
