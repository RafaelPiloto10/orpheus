The streets are paved with tourist and the record companies flourish,  
Lord knows every singer wants to be the king.  
  
But some of them couldn't take it and some good one's didn't make it.  
That's the way it goes on The Nashville Scene.  
  
Now there's a wino on the corner,  
He was a well known guitar picker 'til he got burned out by the game.  
  
Now he'll bum you for some whiskey  
And tell you how it was back in '52 when he played for Hank.  
  
And I'm watching the sun go down this evening  
And soon it will wake this town that's made of dreams.  
  
But before it does a new star will be shining  
And that's the way it is on the Nashville scene.  
  
From the outside its a castle,  
From the inside its a prison its easy to live way beyond your means.  
  
And its a long, long way to the top  
And even further when you drop and I've been on both ends of the Nashville
scene.
