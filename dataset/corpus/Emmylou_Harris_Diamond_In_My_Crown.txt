As each long day rolls by and falls behind me  
In the lonely night there's a peacefulness I've found  
Tho' I'm weary even then  
When I rise to start again  
  
Ther'll be a diamond, a diamond in my crown  
I have wasted all that life has laid before me  
I have watched as all the green fields turn to brown  
But I shall not disavow  
All these ties that bind me now  
  
Ther'll be a diamond, a diamond in my crown  
Shinning down some day I know  
Brighter than all their streets of gold  
When the burdens that I carry I will lay down  
And the sorrows I have known  
I'll see them all be overthrown  
  
Ther'll be a diamond, a diamond in my crown  
Through the passing of the years I will grow stronger  
Just as sure as this old world keeps spinning 'round  
Then the closer I will be  
To my sweetest victory  
  
Ther'll be a diamond, a diamond in my crown
