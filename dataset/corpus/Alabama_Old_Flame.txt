I saw you staring at each other  
I saw your eyes be-gin to glow  
And I could tell you once were lover's  
You ain't hiding nothing I don't know  
  
There's an old flame, burning in your eyes  
That tears can't drown,and make-up can't disguise  
That old flame may not be stronger, but it's been burning longer  
Than any spark I might have,started in your eyes  
  
You said it ended when he left you  
You say your love for him is gone  
But those old memories still up set you  
For I might be a memory before to long  
  
There's an old flame burning in your eyes  
That tears can't drown and make-up can't disguise  
That old flame may not be stronger, but it's been burning longer  
Than any spark I might have,started in your eyes  
  
There's an old flame burning in your eyes  
That tears can't drown,and make-up can't disguise
