Just when everything was making sense.  
You took away all my self-confidence.  
Now all that I've been hearing must be true.  
I guess I'm not the only boy for you.  
[Chorus:]  
But that's what I get  
That's what I get  
That's what I get  
That's what I get  
How could you turn us into this?  
After you just taught me how to kiss you.  
I told you I'd never say goodbye.  
I'm slipping on the tears you made me cry.  
But that's what I get.  
That's what I get.  
That's what I get.  
That's what I get.  
For trusting you.  
That's what I get.  
Why does it come as a surprise.  
To think that I was so naive.  
Maybe didn't mean too much.  
But it meant everything to me.  
[Chorus:]
