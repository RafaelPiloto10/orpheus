Jesus was A man  
He was better than you or I  
And they didn't tell him  
No they tell him  
You didn't know  
  
Hitler was A man  
He didn't know what to do anymore  
Everybody said someone else  
But they know that is A lie  
  
Yeah, gandhi was A man  
He took the millions and gave them more  
We all adore  
  
I said it long ago when the situations scream so true  
All of it was long ago in humanity  
So climb out of the cradle and show yourself  
To the rest of humanity  
Cause I told you long ago even though you know yourself  
And all you thought was true, so true, too true  
  
The pieces of you  
Little pieces, little pieces of you  
Oh... Little pieces of me and you  
Jesus was A man  
He was better than you or I  
No one told him, no one knew  
Hitler was A man  
You know it  
In humanity to man  
Pieces of you  
Little pieces of me and you  
Oh... Oh...  
Little pieces of me and you  
Oh... Oh... Oh...  
My guitar doesn't work  
I wanna play A solo..!
