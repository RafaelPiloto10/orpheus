Verse 1:  
I want a smile on my face.  
A happy alert to my brain.  
I want to be on the other side.  
I want a wonderful life.  
I want to avoid the rush.  
I don't even wanna hide.  
  
Chorus:  
I want a smile make this worth while.  
And get as much,  
As I can.  
I want to fly just you and I.  
I'm ready for love,  
Yes I am.  
  
Verse 2:  
I want a rainbow above me.  
And feel inside so free.  
  
I want to have you right here.  
I want to fly up above.  
And feel all the love.  
I want everything so clear.  
  
Chorus x1.  
  
Bridge:  
I want a smile.  
All worth while.  
I want to change.  
And just rearrange.  
I want to be.  
Just only me.  
I want a smile on my...

I want a smile on my face.  
Cos I'm ready for love.
