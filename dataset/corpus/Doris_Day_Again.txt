This couldn't happen again  
This is that once in a lifetime  
This is the thrill divine  
What's more, this never happened before  
Though I have prayed for a lifetime  
That such as you would suddenly be mine  
Mine to hold as I"m holding you now and yet never so near  
Mine to have when the now and the here disappear  
What matters, dear, for when  
This doesn't happen again  
We'll have this moment forever  
But never, never, again  
  
Again, this couldn't happen again  
This is that once in a lifetime  
This is the thrill divine  
What's more, this never happened before  
Though I have prayed for a lifetime  
That such as you would suddenly be mine  
Mine to hold as I"m holding you now and yet never so near  
Mine to have when the now and the here disappear  
What matters, dear, for when  
This doesn't happen again  
We'll have this moment forever
