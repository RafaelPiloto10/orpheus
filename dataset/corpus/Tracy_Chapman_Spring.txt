There's a cloud  
There's a cloud  
A blue sky darkening  
That veils the light of the sun  
And foretells the rain  
But there's a bird  
There are birds  
And some are singing  
  
To greet every new day that may come  
Like the first of spring  
  
It is cold  
It is cold  
I've had the feeling  
At the heart and in the core  
The roots of all things  
But there's a bud there's a bulb  
It will be blooming  
  
To greet every new day that may come  
Like the first of spring  
  
It's late  
It's late  
As I watch waiting  
It will go turn away  
The cycle cycling  
There's a face with new eyes  
A baby crying  
  
Who'll greet every new day that may come  
Like the first of spring  
  
Like the first of spring
