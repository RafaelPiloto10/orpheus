Black night is not right,  
I don't feel so bright,  
I don't care to sit tight.  
Maybe I'll find on the way down the line  
that I'm free, free to be me.  
Black night is a long way from home.  
  
I don't need a dark tree,  
I don't want a rough sea,  
I can't feel, I can't see.  
Maybe I'll find on the way down the line  
that I'm free, free to be me.  
Black night is a long way from home.  
  
Black night, black night,  
I don't need black night,  
I can't see dark night.  
Maybe I'll find on the way down the line  
that I'm free, free to be me.  
Black night is a long way from home.
