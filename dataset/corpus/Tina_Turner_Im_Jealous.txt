I tossed and turned all last night  
I thought you weren't treating me right  
I love you much too much  
It's jealousy I guess  
  
I tossed and turned all last night  
I rolled and tumbled all last night  
I dreamed someone was holding you tight  
There ain't no use to lie, I?ll love you till I die  
I tossed and turned all last night  
  
I guess I'm jealous and can't help it  
But I love you much too much  
I asked the Lord to please help me  
So I don't dream of such  
  
I guess you think silly of me  
But I'm living down in misery  
There ain't no use to lie, I'm tore up in my lie  
I tossed and turned all last night  
  
I guess I'm jealous and can't help it  
But I love you much too much  
I ask the Lord to please help me  
So I don't dream of such  
  
But I guess you think silly of me  
But I'm living down in misery  
There ain't no use to lie, I'm tore up in my lie  
I tossed and turned all last night  
  
Oh baby, now you know, you know I'm jealous of you  
So why don't you, why don't you come on and treat me right  
You know I love you daddy, show me that you love me too
