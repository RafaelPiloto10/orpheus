We keep hurting each other when words can't be easily said  
No understanding or reason, just fear and confusion instead  
We need hope for the future, and the young need a chance to survive  
No one knows the pain that's felt by the innocent, they're  
Fighting to stay alive, can no one see the tears in their eyes  
  
[Chorus:]  
Only the children, only the children cry, only the children  
  
Why do those who have plenty ignore those with nothing at all  
Why must the ones just beginning, stand with their backs to the wall  
They keep asking for answers and we keep on telling them lies  
They only want to understand what they feel inside  
The hunger that tears them apart  
It's the one thing they've known from the start
