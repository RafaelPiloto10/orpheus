Where can you find pleasure, search the world for treasure, learn science
technology?  
Where can you begin to make your dreams all come true on the land or on the
sea?  
Where can you learn to fly, play in sports or skindive, study oceanography?  
Sign up for the big band or sit in the grandstand when your team and others
meet.  
  
Chorus  
In the navy, you can sail the seven seas  
In the navy, you can put your mind at ease  
In the navy, come on now people, make a stand  
In the navy, can't you see we need a hand?  
In the navy, come protect the mother land  
In the navy, come on and join your fellow man  
In the navy, come on people make a stand  
Inthe navy, in the navy  
  
They want you! They want you! They want you as a new recruit!  
  
If you like adventure, don't you wait to enter, the recruiting office fast  
Don't you hesitate, there is no need to wait, they're signing up new seamen
fast  
Maybe you are too young to sign up today, but don't you worry 'bout a thing  
For I'm sure there will always be a good navy, protecting the land and sea  
  
Chorus  
  
They want you! They want you! They want you as a new recruit! X2  
  
... But, but I'm afraid of water  
... Hey... Hey look men  
I get seasick even watching it on the tv  
They want you! - oh my goodness  
They want you! - what am I gonna do on a submarine?  
They want you! They want you!  
In the navy  
  
Chorus
