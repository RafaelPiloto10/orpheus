Look at life, take a look around you  
Look at life, doesn't it astound you  
See the colors of the sky  
Watch the colors of a rainbow  
We're so lucky, you and I  
Look at life  
  
It's there for us  
So why don't we use it  
Four seasons of the year  
All you do is choose it  
  
Warm summers bring the sun,  
And with the falling leaves the autumn  
All the new things come with spring  
Look at life  
  
Warm summers bring the sun,  
And with the falling leaves we get the autumn,  
The autumn  
  
You see a young boy pick a flower  
Why does he do it  
He picks it for the one he loves  
That's why he does it  
  
He sees the colors of the sky,  
Watches the colors of a rainbow  
We're so lucky, you and I  
Look at life  
  
Look at life Look at life Look at life  
Look at life Look at life Look at life
