Everyday is like a blank canvas  
You know you can paint it anyway you want it  
You can draw black clouds, you can make the sun shine  
Color in a rainbow, or use black and white  
Open up your eyes and, your imagination  
  
Come on let's write a song, a little poetry  
Take a photograph, let's make some memories  
You can make it anything that you want it to be  
If you follow your heart, life is a work of art  
  
Ooh every night's like looking at a dark screen  
You're never too young or too old to dream  
You can make your fantasy into a reality  
Cause you're creating your own masterpiece  
Close your eyes and dream it, seeing is believing  
  
Come on let's write a song, a little poetry  
Take a photograph, let's make some memories  
You can make it anything that you want it to be  
If you follow your heart, life is a work of art  
  
Let's write a song, a little poetry  
Take a photograph, let's make some memories  
You can make it anything that you want it to be  
If you follow your heart, life is a work of art  
  
Trying to simplify into philosophy  
Turn the star into a galaxy  
Make a little noise into a symphony  
You're creating a masterpiece  
  
Come on let's write a song, a little poetry  
Take a photograph, let's make some memories  
You can make it anything that you want it to be  
If you follow your heart, life is a work of art  
  
Come on let's write a song, a little poetry  
Take a photograph, let's make some memories  
You can make it anything that you want it to be  
If you follow your heart, life is a work of art  
  
Let's write a song, a little poetry  
Take a photograph, let's make some memories  
You can make it anything that you want it to be  
If you follow your heart, life is a work of art  
  
Life is a work of art  
Life is a work of art  
Life is a work of art  
Life is a work of art
