She said that she'd take it off  
Right here  
Take it off  
Right now  
Give him back his ring and stay with me  
She must think that's what I want to hear  
  
Good as it may sound  
I kno myself and that can't be  
And I didn't feel bad about it  
Had to remind her taht we were just pretend  
  
I said baby I want you  
But he needs you  
Stay with the real thing  
I never loved you like him  
See I only want you  
But baby he needs you  
Stay with the real thing  
Stay with the real thing  
Stay witchya man  
  
Here comes a tear  
Here comes a tear  
Baby please don't cry  
Don't cry  
I thought you knew what this was  
Baby neva coulda take the place  
Of ur husband  
But we'll always be friends  
Baby we shouldn't have become lovers  
  
And I didn't feel bad about it  
Had to remind her that we were just pretend  
I said baby I want you  
But he needs you  
Stay with the real thing  
I'll never love you like he does  
See I only want you  
Baby he needs you  
Stay with the real thing  
Stay with the real thing  
Stay witchya man  
  
He's got love for you forever  
Why can't you see here with me wont be better  
Oh cus I only want you  
But he needs you  
  
Stay with the real thing  
I never loved you like him  
See I only want you baby  
But he needs you  
Stay with the real thing  
Stay with the real thing  
Stay witchya man
