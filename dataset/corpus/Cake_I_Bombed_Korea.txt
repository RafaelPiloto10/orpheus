I bombed Korea every night.  
My engine sang into the salty sky.  
I didn't know if I would live or die.  
I bombed Korea every night.  
I bombed Korea every night.  
I bombed Korea every night.  
Red flowers bursting down below us.  
Those people didn't even know us.  
We didn't know if we would live or die.  
We didn't know if it was wrong or right.  
I bombed Korea every night.  
And so I sit here at this bar.  
I'm not a hero.  
I'm not a movie star.  
I've got my beer.  
I've got my stories to tell,  
But they won't tell you what it's like in hell.  
Red flowers bursting down below us.  
Those people didn't even know us.  
We didn't know if we would live or die.  
We didn't know if it was wrong or right.  
We didn't know if we would live or die.  
I bombed Korea every night.
