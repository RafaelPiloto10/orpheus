Sometimes I lie awake, wondering if I'll make it out of here,  
But the wind blows round my heels, so I stay  
I remember lying there, wishing I could be someone else  
Trying to find somehow to get away.  
  
If I asked him nicely d'you think he's show me how to fly,  
Cause the dust has weighed my wings down, and I'm too tired to try.  
  
Sometimes I sit here hearing voices in my head  
I try to understand, to make some sense.  
  
I wonder if I had to, would I lie to save myself?  
A plea of guilty, but self defense.  
  
If I asked him nicely d'you think he'd show me how?  
I'm sure he's out there listening, but he's too tied up right now to try  
  
Try, all of my sins  
Cause I can't stop now,  
Just don't leave me behind.  
  
Sometimes I lie awake, wondering if I'll get out of here,  
But the words stick in my throat and I stay.  
I remember lying there, wishing I could be someone else,  
Trying to find somehow to get away  
  
If I asked him nicely d'you think he's show me how to fly,  
Cause the dust has weighed my wings down, and I'm too tired to try.
