I could forget your name  
I could forget your face forever  
I could forget about the smile you always faked  
The one you thought I thought would never  
I could forget your lies  
I could forget the height for always  
I could forget how desperately you tried  
Flattery would get you nowhere  
I could forget how you would try to get the best of me  
You'll never forget that you never got me!  
  
You never got me!  
Real nice to know that you care  
To leave me soaking wet  
I'm so surprised you would dare  
You make me wanna forget (make me wanna forget)  
  
I could forget your pride  
I could forget your wondering eyes  
I could forget about the way you made me feel  
You talk so condescendingly  
I could forget how you would try to get the best of me  
You'll never forget that you never got me!  
  
You never got me!  
Real nice to know that you care  
To leave me soaking wet  
I'm so surprised you would dare  
You make me wanna forget  
  
Real nice to know that you care  
To leave me soaking wet  
I'm so surprised you would dare  
You make me wanna forget  
  
(Never got me!)  
  
Real nice to know that you care  
To leave me soaking wet  
I'm so surprised you would dare  
You make me wanna forget  
  
Real nice to know that you care  
To leave me soaking wet  
I'm so surprised you would dare  
You make me wanna forget  
  
(You make me, you make me)  
You make me wanna forget.  
(You make me, get!)
