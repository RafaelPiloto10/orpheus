I had a dream that I was speaking  
With a prophet from the land of wise  
In a crowd of people from the land of troubled hearts  
I said "We've come here for answers  
A solution to our world's demise"  
He said the journey would be long  
But here's where you start  
  
[Chorus]  
Love one another  
Love one another  
Work it in to work it out  
There could never be enough  
Love one another  
Love one another  
Cause you know without a doubt  
You can change your world with love  
  
It was a simple conclusion  
But I thought that it was rather profound  
Just a fundamental law that we should all live by  
I took it in to tomorrow  
Yea, I walked the earth but I never found  
Any corner of the world  
Where this did not apply  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And looking out I saw no method to the madness there  
Like in a vision from the Isle of Patmos, I was scared  
It was a revelation  
Love is getting rare  
  
The people of the land united  
And in my dream we all agreed  
That we should start again  
And this would be our creed  
  
[Chorus]
