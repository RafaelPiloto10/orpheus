Baby, seasons change but people don't  
And I'll always be waiting in the back room  
I'm boring but overcompensate with  
Headlines and flash, flash, flash photography  
  
But don't pretend you ever forgot about me  
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me  
Wouldn't you rather be a widow than a divorcee?  
Style your wake for fashion magazines  
Widow or a divorcee?  
Don't pretend it, don't pretend  
  
(We don't fight fair)  
(We don't fight fair)  
  
They say your head could be your prison  
Then these are just conjugal visits  
People will dissect us till this doesn't mean a thing anymore  
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me  
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me  
  
Wouldn't you rather be a widow than a divorcee?  
Style your wake for fashion magazines  
Widow or a divorcee?  
Don't pretend it, don't pretend  
  
We do it in the dark  
With smiles on our faces  
We're dropped and well concealed  
In secret places  
We do it in the dark  
With smiles on our faces  
We're dropped and well concealed  
In secret places  
We don't fight fair  
(We don't fight fair)  
We don't fight fair  
(We don't fight fair)  
We don't fight fair  
  
We do it in the dark  
With smiles on our faces  
We're dropped and well concealed  
In secret places  
We do it in the dark  
With smiles on our faces  
We're dropped and well concealed  
In secret places  
We don't fight fair  
With smiles on our faces  
We're dropped and well concealed  
In secret places  
We don't fight fair  
  
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me  
We don't fight fair  
Don't pretend you ever forgot about me  
We don't fight fair
