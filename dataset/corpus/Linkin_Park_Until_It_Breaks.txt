It goes a one, two, three  
  
With the hunger of a lion, the strength of a sun  
I don't need to sweat it when the competition come  
Original style, like an eight of eight drum  
So I don't run the track, no, I make the track run  
My momma taught me words, my daddy built rockets  
I hold 'em both together now, tell me what I got  
It's a pretty small weapon, I can shoot it, I can drop it  
But learn to respect it 'cause you clearly can't stop it  
  
Like that  
  
It ain't over 'cause the sharks on the left side, the snakes on the right  
And anything you do, they wanna get a little bite  
It really doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right  
'Cause once they get their teeth in nothing really fights  
And razzle me I do it like I got nothing to lose  
And you can run your mouth like you could try to fill my shoes  
But steady little soldier, I ain't standing next to you  
I can lay it on the ground before you're even in my view  
Like that  
  
Give me the strength of the rising sun  
Give me the truth of the words unsung  
And when the last bells ring, the poor men sing  
Bring me to kingdom come  
  
This is something for your people on the block to  
Blackout and rock to, give you what you need  
Like Papa, who shot ya  
Seperate the weak from the obsolete  
You're meek, I creep hard on impostors  
And switch styles on the dime, quick-witted y'all  
Quit tripping, I don't have time for your crying  
I grind tough, sucka, make your mind up  
Are you in the firing squad or are you in the line-up?  
Bang, bang, little monkey man playing  
With the big guns only get you slain  
I ain't playing, I'm just saying  
You ain't got a sliver of a chance  
I get ill or I deliver while you quiver in your parents  
So shake, shake down, money, here's the break down  
You can play the bank, I'ma play the bank take down  
And no mistakes now I'm coming to get you  
I'm just a Banksy, you're a Brainwash, get the picture?  
It's like that  
  
We swim against the rising waves  
That crash against the shore  
The body bends until it breaks  
The early morning sings no more  
  
So rest your head  
It's time to sleep  
And dream of what's in store  
The body bends until it breaks  
And sings again no more  
'Cause time has torn the flesh away  
The early morning sings no more
