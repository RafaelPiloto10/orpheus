Mama take this badge off of me  
I can't use it any more  
Its gettin dark, too dark to see  
I feel like I'm knockin on heavens door  
  
Knock, knock, knockin on heavens door  
Knock, knock, knockin on heavens door  
Knock, knock, knockin on heavens door  
Knock, knock, knockin on heavens door  
  
Mama, wipe the blood from my face  
I'm sick and tired of the war  
[...]  
I feel like I'm knockin on heaves door  
  
Knock, knock, knockin on heavens door  
Knock, knock, knockin on heavens door
