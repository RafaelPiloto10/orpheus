It's not the way you smile  
That touches my heart  
It's not the way you kiss  
That tears me apart  
Many, many nights go by  
I sit alone  
At home I cry  
Over you  
What can I do  
Can't help myself  
'Cause baby it's you  
  
You should hear what they say about you  
They say you've never  
Never, never been true  
Oh! Oh! Oh!  
Doesn't matter what they say  
I'm gonna love you any old way  
What can I do  
When it's true  
Don't want nobody  
'Cause baby it's you  
  
Many, many, many nights go by  
I sit alone  
At home I cry  
Over you  
What can I do  
Can't help myself  
'Cause baby it's you
