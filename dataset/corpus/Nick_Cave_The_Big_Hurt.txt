Nick performed this for the Italian film Mojo, along with Gallon Drunk and it
is available on a cd called Soho.  
  
Now it begins, now that you're gone  
Needles and pins, twilight till dawn  
Watching that clock till you return  
And lighting that torch and watching it burn  
  
Now it begins, day after day  
This is my life ticking away  
Waiting to hear footsteps that say:  
Love will appear and this time will stay  
  
Each time you go  
I try to pretend  
It's over at last  
This time the big hurt will end  
  
Now it begins, now that you're gone  
Needles and pins, twilight till dawn  
So if you don't come back again  
I wonder when, oh when will it end?  
The big hurt (repeat)
