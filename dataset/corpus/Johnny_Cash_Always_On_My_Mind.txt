Maybe I didn't love you  
Quite as often as I could have  
Maybe I didn't treat you  
Quite as good as I should have  
If I made you feel second best  
Girl I'm sorry I was blind  
  
But you were always on my mind  
You were always on my mind  
  
Maybe I didn't hold you  
All those lonely, lonely times  
I guess I never told you  
That I am so happy that you're mine  
If I made you feel second best  
Girl I'm sorry I was blind  
  
But you were always on my mind  
You were always on my mind  
  
Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died  
Give me, give me one more chance  
To keep you satisfied  
I'll keep you satisfied  
  
Little things I should have said and done  
I just never took the time  
But you were always on my mind  
You were always on my mind  
You were always on my mind  
You were always on my mind
