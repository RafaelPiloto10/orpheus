[Chorus]  
Ride when we ride we ride  
It's til the day we die  
When we ride we ride  
It's til the day we die  
  
It's real late  
'Bout a quarter to one  
Thinkin' about everythang  
We become  
And I hate it  
I thought we could make it  
But I'm ready to scratch this  
Just wanna forget about it  
I saw the pictures  
And the letters she sent  
You had me thinkin'  
You were out we your friends  
I'm so foolish  
Treat me like I'm stupid  
'Cause I thought it was just you and I (oh)  
  
Now I look back on the time  
That we spent and  
I see it in my mind  
Playing over and over again  
'Cause boy right now  
You got me breaking down  
And I just can't figure out why  
But this is what you say  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
Visions in my mind  
Of the day that we met  
You showed me thangs  
That'll never forget  
Took me swimming  
In the ocean  
You had my head up in the clouds  
Make me feel like I'm floating (yeah)  
You think I'm playing  
When you now its the truth  
Nobody else can do it  
Quite like I do  
All my kisses  
And my lovin'  
But ain't nobody  
Better than us  
  
Now I look back on the time  
That we spent and  
I see it in my mind  
Playing over and over again  
'Cause boy right now  
You got me breaking down  
And I just can't figure out why  
But this is what you say  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
I guess its over  
And definitely  
But you and I know  
Its not that easy  
To let go  
Of everything (everything) that we planned  
And start all over again  
Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it  
I won't forget how you do it  
Sweet baby  
This is where the game ends now somehow  
Might not believe you and me  
We can figure it out  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You finna make me say boy  
I wish that you come hold me  
When I'm lonely  
When I need someone to talk to  
You would phone me  
Just like everything its on me  
(when we ride we ride it's til the day we die)  
Boy you forgot about the promises  
You made me  
And now we'll let the memories  
Just fade away  
But I remember  
What you used to say  
(when we ride we ride it's til the day we die)  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
We ride
