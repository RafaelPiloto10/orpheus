Way back in '29, 1929, somewhere in Coffeeville  
Was a Honky tonk named Big Mable Murphy  
She had a sweetheart, mean Little Melvin  
And hell would fly between them every Saturday night  
Why? Because Little Melvin, he got wild on bathtub gin  
Well, it made him feel like he was almost twice his size  
So he'd try to take over and sass Big Mable  
But her great big fist would black little Melvin's eyes  
Ya see, Big Mable Murphy, she loved her Little Melvin  
But he never did learn to do just what she said  
'Cause poor Little Melvin, woke up early every morning  
With two black eyes and knuckle bumps on his head  
Late one rainy night, Scarface, muscle and all might  
He came in and started shoving everybody around  
Well, Big Mable Murphy, she was way back in the kitchen  
So just for fun, ol' Scarface shot Little Melvin down  
Early next morning, down by the river  
They say, old Scarface was found real short of breath  
They say, he died, uhh, oh, the man died from a good ol' whipping  
He had two black eyes and knuckle bumps on his head  
Big Mable, Big Mable Murphy  
She gave him two black eyes and knuckle bumps on his head
