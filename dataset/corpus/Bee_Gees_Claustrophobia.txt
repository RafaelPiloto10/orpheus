I'd like to be the one to see your loving mind at the start  
But I get claustrophobia 'cause there's too many boys in your heart  
I'd like to know how far you'd go to use those lips of wine  
But I get claustrophobia 'cause there's too many boys on your mind  
  
Oh, one, two, three and now there's me  
You practice to deceive  
You lead me on, another one  
I've got no room to breathe  
  
So bye bye you who can't be true, I'm leaving you behind  
Cause I get claustrophobia 'cause there's too many boys on your mind  
  
I get claustrophobia 'cause there's too many boys on your mind  
  
Oh, one, two, three and now there's me  
You practice to deceive  
You lead me on , another one  
I've got no room to breathe  
  
So bye bye you who can't be true , I'm leaving you behind  
Cause I get claustrophobia 'cause there's too many boys on your mind  
Too many boys on your mind  
Too many boys on your mind
