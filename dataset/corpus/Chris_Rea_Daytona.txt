Diamond dream when the sun don't shine  
I close my eyes to see  
Twelve wild horses in silver chains  
Calling out to me  
  
Oh Daytona, shine your light on me  
Oh Daytona, shine your light on me  
  
Now she ain't easy so you take good care  
Or she will scream down on your lust  
She can please you like no other  
Or she can leave you eating dust  
  
Oh Daytona, shine your light on me  
  
Burning passion heat my day  
Let me sit inside your wonder  
Cloudless daydream, oh dance of dances  
To have tamed the sound of thunder  
  
Oh Daytona, shine your light on me  
Oh Daytona, shine your light on me
