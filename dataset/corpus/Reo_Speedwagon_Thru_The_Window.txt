Through the window, I slip away  
Into the darkness, time has come  
I must use caution, summer nights are here, I'll race  
For the shadows, I'll make a trail  
No one can follow, and all I feel  
Is the breeze rushin by my face  
  
Runnin free through the night in the street  
Like it best when I feel the heat  
I know my baby's waitin just for me  
  
Creepin', through her neighborhood  
I hope nobody, has seen or heard  
My intentions, are driven by this flame inside  
  
I see her light on, her silhouette's  
In the window, she's waiting for  
My arrival, on this summer night  
  
Runnin' free through the night in the street  
Like it best when I feel the heat  
Runnin' free through the night in the street  
I know my baby's waiting just for me  
Runnin' free through the night in the street  
I like it best when I fell the heat, oh yeah  
  
Through her window, she slips away  
I hear her heartbeat  
High emotion, takes us where we've never been before
