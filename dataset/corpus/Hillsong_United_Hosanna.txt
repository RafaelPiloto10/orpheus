I see the King of glory  
Coming on the clouds of fire  
The whole earth shakes, the whole earth shakes  
I see His love and mercy  
Washing over all our sin  
The people sing, the people sing  
  
[Chorus]  
Hosanna, Hosanna  
Hosanna in the highest  
Hosanna, Hosanna  
Hosanna in the highest  
  
I see a generation  
Rising up to take the place  
With selfless faith, with selfless faith  
I see a near revival  
Staring as we pray and seek  
We're on our knees, we're on our knees  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Heal my heart and make it clean  
Open up my eyes to the things unseen  
Show me how to love like You have loved me  
Break my heart for what breaks Yours  
Everything I am for Your kingdom's cause  
As I walk from earth into eternity  
  
Hosanna in the highest  
In the highest  
In the highest  
Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest  
  
Hosanna in the highest  
In the highest  
In the highest  
Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest
