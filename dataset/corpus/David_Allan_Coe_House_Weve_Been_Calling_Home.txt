Jessie she stares like a cat with a bird  
That has fallen and broke its wing  
Terri she puts on her make-up  
And wonders what promise the new day will bring  
  
Debbie stays home with the baby  
While I work my hands to the bone  
Yeah I make a living they do the giving  
In a house we've been calling home  
  
Just a house we've been trying to live in  
Just a place we've been calling our own  
Me and my wives have been spending our lives  
In a house we've been calling home  
  
Jessie's the youngest she always needs  
Answers to questions that I just don't know  
Terri she can't sit still for a moment  
She's always in some hurry to go  
  
Debbie's been with me the longest  
We spend most of our time on the phone  
Talking in rhymes with no reasons in mind  
For this house we've been calling home  
  
Just a house we've been trying to live in  
Just a place we've been calling our own  
Me and my wives have been spending our lives  
In a house we've been calling home
