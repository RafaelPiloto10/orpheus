Another bride, Another June  
Another sunny honeymoon  
Another season, Another reason  
To make whoopee  
  
A lot of shoes, a lot of rice  
The groom is nervous, uhh, he answers twice  
Its really killin', the boy's so willin'  
To make whoopee, whoopee  
  
Picture a little love nest, yeah  
Down where the roses cling  
Picture that same sweet love nest  
See what a year can bring  
  
I tell you the boy's washin' dishes 'n, baby clothes  
He's so ambitious, ooh, I tell you he sews  
Its really killin', the boy's so willin'  
To make whoopee, whoopee  
  
You see, I don't make much money  
Only five, uh-uh, thousand per  
And some judge who thinks he's funny  
Tells me I got to pay six to her  
  
I said now judge, suppose I fail?  
The judge says, "Ray, son, son, right on into jail.  
Ah, you better keep her. I think it's cheaper."  
  
[spoken] You know what I've been doin', don't you?  
[crowd goes wild]
