Fresh off the hiatus  
(Brooklyn what it look like baby?)  
Hi haters

Street Fiddadidadam

Street Fiddadidadam

[Verse: Fabolous]  
I got a swag like the hustlers from Harlem had  
I'm blowin' on a drag like Marley had  
The bitches that I bag be Barbie bad  
Not to exag  
The brains like a Harvard grad  
You can't rob him  
Unless you got a Carbon Mag  
Its not a problem  
Puttin' you in a garbage bag  
Try to bob him  
Just like you Marvin Hagg  
You can't mob him  
Unless its for a autograph  
I ought to laugh  
Like ha ha ha ha  
I'm in a Jay-Z edition Otto ma ha ha ha  
New Blue Yankee Rich Yung long John  
Red Monkey Jeans this shit from Hong Kong  
I'm long gone  
  
[Fabolous:]  
Clue let a nigga get his breath man  
Yeah  
What it look like Brooklyn?  
I got some bars for ya  
  
I got the finance to crush him  
5 grand to hush him  
Niggas talk the shit its my chance to flush him  
My fans'll brush him  
My mans'll rush him  
Imagine if I would've used my hands to touch him  
Who want it with I  
You run with the guy  
That's like suicide you wanted to die  
Two gun if you lie  
Few done it like I  
Its three to look at the coupe its two hundred to buy  
Yeah I'm big with the bittys  
Do it big in the city  
Without Jigga or Fitty  
Or Biggie or Diddy  
I show niggas no pity  
Just figure they dritty  
Send sac with the forty made me way with the fitty  
They'll be gunnin' and buckin'  
You'll be runnin' and duckin'  
Hopin' none of 'em get ya  
Its like dope when it hit ya  
With the scope I'm a split ya  
Send the pope to be with ya  
Still you'll need doctors to open and stitch ya  
Its ya boy
