Shoulda known it when I met you  
Everybody was trying to tell me  
But you had me blinded  
It's all good though  
Now I understand...  
  
Verse 1:  
What you did was shady, girl  
Thought you were my lady, girl, that's why  
I straight made you girl  
Gave you all the finer things in life  
Homie said to stop the flow  
Told me you were nothing but a ho  
I ignored him though  
And you took me through for sho  
  
Chorus  
I guess this must be why  
Most guys (Don't get personal)  
Just when we decide  
It's all right (We get left alone)  
And even though I try, I can't hide  
(What I'm going through)  
Thought you would be mine, only mine (and I fell hard for you)  
  
Verse 2:  
I guess I shouldn't even trip  
Homie said get over it, I've tried  
But I can't forget  
How you had me open for your lies  
Every other girl I meet  
Can't even trust, because I've seen  
What you've done to me  
Ain't no telling when I'd be ready  
  
Chorus x2  
I remember when, you said I was your only man  
But I'm wiser now, and I'll never hurt again  
Getting over you, if it's the last thing that I do  
No, we can't even be cool  
I don't need a friend like you  
  
Chorus x3 til fade
