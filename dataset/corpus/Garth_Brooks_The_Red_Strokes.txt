Moonlight on canvas, midnight and wine  
Two shadows starting to softly combine  
The picture they're painting  
Is one of the heart  
And to those who have seen it  
It's a true work of art  
  
Oh, the red strokes  
Passions uncaged  
Thundering moments of tenderness rage  
Oh, the red strokes  
Tempered and strong (Fearlessly drawn)  
Burning the night like the dawn  
  
Steam on the window, salt in a kiss  
Two hearts have never pounded like this  
Inspired by a vision  
That they can't command  
Erasing the borders  
With each brush of a hand  
  
Oh, the red strokes  
Passions uncaged  
Thundering moments of tenderness rage  
Oh, the red strokes  
Tempered and strong (Fearlessly drawn)  
Burning the night like the dawn  
  
Oh, the blues will be blue and the jealousies green  
But when love picks its shade it demands to be seen  
  
Oh, the red strokes  
Passions uncaged  
Thundering moments of tenderness rage  
Oh, the red strokes  
Tempered and strong (Fearlessly drawn)  
Burning the night like the dawn  
  
Oh, the red strokes  
Passions uncaged  
Thundering moments of tenderness rage  
Oh, the red strokes  
Tempered and strong (Fearlessly drawn)  
Burning the night like the dawn  
  
Steam on the window, salt in a kiss  
Two hearts have never pounded like this
