Where I lead me I will travel  
Where I need me I will call me  
I'm no fool, I'll be ready  
God knows I will be  
And in the meantime make a little money  
And buy a little mercy  
  
Met this morning, now he loves me  
Say's he loves me  
It must be easy, look around you  
All around you  
But you see the motion, you're not movin'  
You don't know how to hold on  
Just keep it loose  
Don't get excited, it'll pass before long  
  
Now one is goin' one is stayin'  
One is silent one is saying'  
Here's your coat, take care of yourself  
Sorry you're leavin'  
A little sad you're all I had  
Will you be returnin'  
  
The boys upstairs are gettin' hungry  
You can shout in the wind about how it will be  
Or you can clench your fist, shake your head  
And head to the country  
I got no doubt about it my friend  
That's where they'll find me  
That's where they're gonna find me  
  
Ask the boys down in the gutter  
Now they won't lie cause you don't matter  
The street's just fine if you're good and blind  
But it ain't where you belong  
Roll down your sleeves, pick up your money  
And carry yourself home  
Roll down your sleeves, pick up your money  
And carry yourself home
