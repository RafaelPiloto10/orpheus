Happy the man - he lives a simple life  
He doesn?t have much - it doesn?t worry him  
Where you go - where?  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, nowhere  
  
Like a nun with a gun - I?m wonderful fun  
Laughing all through - just watching you  
Seems a very stupid game...  
But I don?t care  
  
Happy the man - he doesn?t buzz around  
Nothing he wants - any more than anything  
Where you go - where?  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, nowhere  
  
Like a fool in the pool - I?m incredibly cool  
With a grin on my chin - I?m certain to win  
Someone says he?s jesus christ - but I don?t care  
  
He is a good man...
