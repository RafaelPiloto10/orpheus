I want her so bad  
Mother Nature has a hold on me  
I want her so bad  
Mother Nature won't you let me be untied?  
'Cause it hurts my pride  
To be tossed off like the morning covers  
And crossed off, like her other lovers  
Casually  
  
I see her walking by my window- mhmmhmmhmmhmm!  
It seems to me I know her well.  
But like the flowers in the spring-time,  
Growing toward the sunshine,  
Her beauty falls upon me in a fragrant spring-time spell  
  
And I want her so ba-aa-aad  
Mother Nature has a HOLD on me  
I want her so bad  
Mother Nature won't you let me be untied?  
'Cause it hurts my pride  
To be tossed off like the morning covers  
And crossed off, like her other lovers  
Casually  
  
Is she an icy winter woman? Mm-hhmm!  
That chills my body when she's near  
Sweet fever in the morning  
I don't know if I'll survive.  
She walks by me as though she didn't  
Know I was alive  
  
And I want her so ba-aa-aad  
Mother Nature has a hold on me  
I want her so bad  
Mother Nature won't you let me be untied?  
'Cause it hurts my pride  
To be tossed off like the morning covers  
And crossed off, like her other lovers  
Tossed off like the morning covers,  
Crossed off, like her other lovers  
Tossed off like the morning covers,  
Crossed off, like her other lovers
