No one to talk with all by myself  
No one to walk with but I'm happy on the shelf  
Ain't misbehavin' [unverified] saving my love for you!  
  
I know for certain, the one I love  
I'm through with flirtin', it's just you I'm thinkin' of  
Ain't misbehavin' [unverified] saving my love for you!  
  
Like Jack Horner, in the corner, don't go nowhere  
But what do I care?  
Your kisses [unverified] are worth waitin' for believe me!  
  
Don't stay out late, don't care to go!  
I'm home about eight, just me an' my radio!  
Ain't misbehavin' [unverified] saving my love for you!  
  
Hmm, I don't stay out late, don't care to go!  
I'm home about eight, just me an' my radio!  
Ain't misbehavin' [unverified] saving my love for you [unverified]  
  
I'm saving my love for you!
