When you were little  
You dreamed you were big  
You must have been something  
A real tiny kid  
  
You wish you were me  
I wish I was you  
Now don't you wake up  
The dream will come true  
  
Every dream has a name  
And names tell your story  
This song is your dream  
You're the dream operator  
  
It's bigger than life  
You know it's all me  
My face is a book  
But it's not what it seems  
  
Three angels above  
The whole human race  
They dream us to life  
They dream me a face  
  
And every dream tells it all  
And this dream is your story  
You dreamed me a heart  
You're the dream operator  
  
Shake-it-up dream  
Hi-di-ho dream  
Fix-it-up dream  
Look at me dream  
I've been waiting so long  
Now I am your dream  
  
Hard to forget  
Hard to go on  
When you fall asleep  
You're out on your own  
  
Let go of your life  
Grab on to my hand  
Here in the clouds  
Where we'll understand  
  
And you dreamed it all  
And this is your story  
Do you know who you are?  
You're the dream operator  
  
And you dreamed it all  
And this is your story  
Do you know who you are?  
You're the dream operator
