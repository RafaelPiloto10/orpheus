I was 21 years when I wrote this song  
I'm 22 now, but I won't be for long  
Time hurries on  
  
[Chorus]  
And the leaves that are green turn to brown  
And they wither with the wind  
And they crumble in your hand  
  
Once my heart was filled with the love of a girl  
I held her close, but she faded in the night  
Like a poem I meant to write  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I throw a pebble in a brook  
And watched the ripples run away  
And they never made a sound  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hello hello hello hello  
Goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye  
That's all there is  
And the leaves that are green turn to brown
