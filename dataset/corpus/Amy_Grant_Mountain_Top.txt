I love to sing and I love to pray  
Worship the Lord most every day  
I go to the temple and I just want to stay  
To hide from the hustle of the world and its ways  
And I'd love to live on a mountain top  
Fellowshipping with the Lord  
I'd love to stand on a mountain top  
'Cause I love to feel my spirit soar  
But I've got to come down from that mountain top  
To the people in the valley below  
Or they'll never know that they can go  
To the mountain of the Lord  
Now praising the Father is a good thing to do  
To worship the trinity in spirit and truth  
But if we worshiped all of the time  
There would be no one to lead the blind  
But I'd love to live on a mountain top  
Fellowshipping with the Lord  
I'd love to stand on a mountain top  
'Cause I love to feel my spirit soar  
But I've got to come down from that mountain top  
To the people in the valley below  
Or they'll never know that they can go  
To the mountain of the Lord  
Now I am not saying that worship is wrong  
But worship is more than just singin' a song  
It's all that you say and everything that you do  
It's letting his spirit live through you  
Still I'd love to live on a mountain top  
Fellowshipping with the Lord  
I'd love to stand on a mountain top  
'Cause I love to feel my spirit soar  
But I've got to come down from that mountain top  
To the people in the valley below  
Or they'll never know that they can go  
To the mountain of the Lord
