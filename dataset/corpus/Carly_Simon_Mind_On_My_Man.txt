I've got my mind on my man  
I've got my man on my mind  
He's everything to me, he's somthin' more special  
Than any amount of lookin's gonna find  
  
I'm not hooked on any her from an idle dream  
But I'm idly dreaming of him  
He's a lotus, that opens and closes  
Notice he won't always let me in  
So my mind is on my man, got my man on my mind  
  
Sometimes he's sleepy  
And I don't think he loves me  
I worry about his lovin'  
Ain't I crazy?  
  
He's a Northern baby and a Southern child  
He's a gentleman lost at the fair  
He's a cowboy gettin' drunk at the Plaza  
He has a place in my heart anywhere  
And my mind is on my man, got my man on my mind
