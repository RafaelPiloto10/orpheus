Blue, blue is the color of skies  
Blue is the color of your eyes  
Your beautiful blue eyes  
Black, black is the color you wore  
Black is the promise you made before you closed  
the door  
And never told me why  
  
I'm black and blue because of you  
I feel like I've been beaten  
You walked away from me  
Leaving me all black and blue  
  
You, you used to sleep by my side  
You swore you had nothing to hide  
And now there's nothing left to lose  
  
Night, night after long endless night  
You swore you had nothing to hide  
And I was so naive to believe your lies  
  
I'm black and blue because of you  
I feel like I've been beaten  
You walked away from me  
Leaving me all black and blue  
  
Down in the depths of your soul  
I hear the echo and the sigh that your secrets  
can not hide  
They never lie to me  
  
Night, night after long endless night  
You swore you had nothing to hide  
And I was so naive to believe your lies  
  
I'm black and blue because of you  
I feel like I've been beaten  
You walked away from me  
Leaving me all black and blue  
  
Broken in two because of you  
I feel like I've been beaten  
You walked away from me  
Leaving me all black and blue  
  
Black and blue because of you  
I feel like I've been beaten  
You walked away having me all black and blue.
