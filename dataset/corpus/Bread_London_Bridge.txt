I know the times the times are hard to bear  
It's hard to find someone to really care  
But before I went down and out  
Here's what I used to think about, think about  
  
London bridge is always fallin' down,  
But there it stood within the heart of town  
Reminding everyone of life behind and life to come  
  
The changes taking place are everywhere  
The centuries past have nothing to compare  
Where they stand, where they trip and fall  
Watch the writing on the wall, on the wall  
  
London bridge is fallin' down at last,  
And so another memory of the past  
Has fell beneath the blade, but soon the dead may be repaid  
  
I know things just can't evolve for all eternity  
The thoughts will leave, will never die, and now so you can see  
  
London bridge is finally fallin' down,  
It packed it up and shipped it outta town  
And though the horror's gone, the memory will linger on  
London bridge is finally fallin' down,  
It used to stand within the heart of town  
Reminding everyone of life behind and life to come  
London bridge is finally fallin' down
