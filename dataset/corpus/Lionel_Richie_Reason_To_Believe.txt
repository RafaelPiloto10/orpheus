Everybody's talking loud  
Tryin' to get me to join the crowd  
But I can't hear what they're talking about  
Cause they ain't sayin' nothin'  
They say come follow me  
What I'm telling you will set you free  
All you gotta do is act like me  
But I can't feel nothin'  
  
I just want somebody  
To laugh out loud  
I just want somebody  
To make me smile  
  
Whoa I'm  
I'm trying to finda reason to believe [Repeat: x2]  
  
(Wait a minute) I just can't tell what's right or wrong  
And I'm not sure where I belong  
And where is that simple song I remember  
They say everything's in black and white  
And the sun shines at twelve at night  
And to praise God you gotta fight  
It's crazy, crazy  
  
I just want somebody  
To laugh out loud  
I just want somebody  
To make me smile  
  
Whoa cause I'm  
I'm trying to find a reason to believe [Repeat: x2]  
  
Don't wanna live  
Don't wanna lie to myself anymore  
Don't wanna try to understand  
The pain I see through my eyes  
  
Let me laugh  
Just let me cry  
Just let me see right from wrong  
Just let me love  
Let me feel  
Cause I want in my life all the things that's real  
Cause I  
I'm trying to find a reason to believe [Repeat: x6]
