What would you say if I said somethin' strange  
That made a difference in how you feel  
What would you do if I did somethin' outta the blue  
That made the world a better place  
Oh, I think I will  
  
[Chorus]  
Gonna change, before I break  
Gonna take your heartache and make it mine  
This time  
Oh, I think I will  
I'm gonna run 'til I find  
Another way to make you mine  
In time  
Oh, I think I will  
  
What would you give, if I gave you everything  
And asked for nothin', how would you feel  
What would you think if I thought about  
Doin'somethin'good, just to make you smile  
Oh, I think I will  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm takin' it slow but the further I go  
The more I know I think I will  
The longer I live the stronger I get  
I'm positive I think I will  
  
I'm takin' it slow but the further I go  
The more I think I will  
The longer I live the stronger I get  
I'm positive I think I will  
  
[Chorus]
