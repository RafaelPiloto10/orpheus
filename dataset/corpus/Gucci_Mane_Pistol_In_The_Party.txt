Brick Squad about to walk in here  
So cold I make bitch say burr!  
Drinkin' on lean like a ice cold beer  
Can't give you none, give you what got you here  
Diamonds so big they hurt my ear  
Sip codeine bitch, not Belvedere  
Ballin' like a nigga on his first day out  
You chain so little that it hurt my eye  
Your watch ain't real, you a goddamn lie  
Got some little bitty niggas, I'm a big ol' playa  
I can take her to you vacation  
Car collection, first placed it  
Off for 10 years and they couldn't take it  
Tore down the whole damn operation  
I'm a man bruh, so I'ma stand for  
Everything I stand for  
And I'm a hound dog, kinda fragile  
Cause I drop down, better pipe down  
EA, GA, AK to the peach state  
And a bitch can't call me cheap skate  
I'm worth 20 mil on Ebay  
Gucci Mane ain't ballin'  
Young bitch that what yo mouth say  
  
Ain't no 1 on 1 nigga  
He swing, I hit you  
I ain't no front for fun nigga  
He ridin' with you, he die with you  
I ain't think of bitin' my tongue nigga  
Everybody know I don't fuck with you  
And I ain't finna to go in no club nigga  
Unless you let me in with this lil' nigga  
  
Pistol in the party, pistol in the party  
They let me in the club, I brought my pistol to the party  
Pistol in the party, pistol in the party  
They let me in the club, I brought my pistol to the party  
  
Bet a million dollars at a month nigga  
Quarter mil for a lunch nigga  
Hundred dollars on a blunt nigga  
Take care hand, don't talk nigga  
200 dollars a blunt nigga  
This ain't what you want nigga  
Got rifles like I'm huntin' niggas  
Hand choppers and pumps nigga  
Lil chump change nigga keep runnin' out the mouth  
Then you gon' be in my trunk nigga  
Got a young nigga, just slump niggas  
But all I do is just point fingers  
Had the niggas fightin' like Jerry Springer  
Finger fuck a ho with my trigger finger  
I know pimp niggas, I know gang bangers  
Same plan, different angle  
Want to tangle with Gucci  
So your life you want to gamble  
Got her waitin' for you at the funeral  
And you Auntie numbers like candles  
Big Guwap, I keep a banger  
Tell the truth I don't like strangers  
Trap game is a deadly game but I told the pussy jet like Jesse James  
  
Ain't no 1 on 1 nigga  
He swing, I hit you  
I ain't no front for fun nigga  
He ridin' with you, he die with you  
I ain't think of bitin' my tongue nigga  
Everybody know I don't fuck with you  
And I ain't finna to go in no club nigga  
Unless you let me in with this lil' nigga  
  
Pistol in the party, pistol in the party  
They let me in the club, I brought my pistol to the party  
Pistol in the party, pistol in the party  
They let me in the club, I brought my pistol to the party
