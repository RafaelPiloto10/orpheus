You have said as much as you can say  
Your heart is just about to overflow  
Must be something more I can do  
Some new plateau  
I'm listening to you  
Dying to know  
Everything that your feeling  
Every change you undergo  
Just don't tell me that you love me  
Because I do' want to know  
  
I do' want to know how much you love me  
I do' want to know how much you care  
I do' want to, I do' want to, I do' want to know  
I do' want to do what I'm supposed to  
I do' want to wear what I'm supposed to wear  
I do' want to, I do' want to, I do' want to know  
  
You are gonna do what you must do  
You are gonna go where you want to go  
You are gonna hear what you hear  
Fear what you fear  
Don't say a word  
Don't let it show  
You will be what you will be  
You will reap everything you sow  
Just don't tell me that you love me  
Because I do' want to know
