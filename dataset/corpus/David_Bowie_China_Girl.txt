I could escape this feeling, with my China Girl  
I feel a wreck without my, little China Girl  
I hear her heart beating, loud as thunder  
Saw the stars crashing  
I'm a mess without my, little China Girl  
Wake up mornings where's my, little China Girl  
I hear hearts beating, loud as thunder  
Saw the stars crashing down  
I feel a-tragic like I'm Marlon Brando  
When I look at my China Girl  
I could pretend nothing really meant too much  
When I look at my China Girl  
I stumble into town just like a sacred cow  
Visions of swastikas in my head  
Plans for everyone  
It's in the way of my eyes  
My little China Girl  
You shouldn't mess with me  
I'll ruin everything you are  
I'll give you television  
I'll give you eyes of blue  
I'll give your man the words to rule the world  
And when I get excited  
My little China Girl says  
Oh baby just you shut your mouth  
She says... sh-sh-shhh
