God, please push me in the right direction  
God, I'm hoping that you'll understand  
God, I'm trying to make amends now  
God, I'm asking for your guiding hand  
  
Everybody's got the wrong opinion  
Everybody says what's on their mind  
Everybody's got the wrong tradition  
Everybody pray to the man  
  
God, I'm reading in your holy books now  
God, I'm singing and I'm not afraid  
God, I'm looking for the only way out now  
God, I'm hoping that I can be saved  
  
Everybody's got the wrong religion  
You won't say what's on your mind  
Some won't hear why others listen  
Everybody pray to the man  
  
Why don't you ever answer questions  
Now my faith is slipping away  
I'm looking in a different direction  
Believing is the only way  
  
Everybody's got their own tradition  
(Everybody's got the wrong religion)  
Everybody's got their own salvation  
(Everybody's got the wrong submission)  
  
Everybody's got their own religion  
(Everybody's got the wrong tradition)  
Everybody pray to the man
