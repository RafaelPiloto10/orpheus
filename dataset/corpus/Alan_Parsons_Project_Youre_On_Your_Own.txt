The mother and son relationship  
  
Lead Vocal: Kiki Dee  
  
Do you know who I am  
Do you know where you are  
Are you where you want to be  
  
Do you see what you like  
Do you like what you see  
Do you think a need in you  
Can fulfill a need in me  
  
You're on your own, you're on your own  
In a no man's land  
In a danger zone  
You're on your own, you're on your own  
And you can't turn back  
And you can't find your way home  
  
Do you know who you are  
Do you know what you want  
Can you see me as I am  
  
Do you think you're a lion  
And I'm a lamb  
That you came in here a boy  
And you're going out a man  
  
You're on your own, you're on your own  
And there's no way out  
Of the Danger zone  
You're on your own, you're on your own  
And your only friend  
Is a heart of stone  
  
And now you are alone my friend  
And I must set you free  
And you must face the world outside  
And find your destiny  
  
You're on your own, you're on your own  
In a no man's land  
In a danger zone  
You're on your own, you're on your own  
And your only friend has a heart of stone  
  
You're on your own, you're on your own  
And there's no way out  
Of the Danger zone  
You're on your own, you're on your own  
Just a lonely child  
And you can't find your way home
