Found myself a matchbook  
Beside some hotel bed  
Opened it up and looked inside  
And this is what it said  
  
Get on back to school  
Domino college, back to school  
Boneyard full of knowledge  
Working vacation in a third world nation  
Back to school  
  
Fly down to Miami  
Get yourself a boat  
Fill it full of suntan oil  
And rent yourself a goat  
  
Ain't no registration  
Ain't no student loan  
You may not learn to read or write  
But you will surely learn to roll them bones  
  
Get on back to school  
Domino college, back to school  
Boneyard full of knowledge  
Working vacation in a third world nation  
Back to school  
  
They don't rap your knuckles  
If you cut the class  
They just track you through the jungle boy  
Then they kick your ass  
  
It's a different kind of domino theory  
They teach you down in Butler town  
If you lose you buy the booze  
And then the student body all falls down  
  
They can't get back to school  
Domino college, back to school  
Fountain of knowledge  
Working vacation in a third world nation  
Back to school  
Get on back  
  
Make your parents hate you  
Be a big disgrace  
Act just like a domino  
And fall on your face  
  
You can't get back to school  
Domino college, back to school  
Fountain of knowledge  
There ain't no graduation from this kind of education  
Back to school  
Working vacation in a third world nation  
Back to school  
  
Oh, Jan
