Hello you, how was the rest,  
You made it through but never the less,  
I got you out on a wire, you be love and ill be a liar.  
Tell it all and fill up the air, but make it loud cause nobodies there  
Nobodies there, nobodies there  
  
Stop, turn, take a look around,  
At all of the lights and sounds,  
Let them bring you in  
Slow, burn, let it all fade out  
And pull the curtain down,  
Wonder where you've been  
  
Make it new but stay in the lines, just let go,  
Keep it inside, smile big for everyone, even when you know what they've done.  
They gave you the end but not where to start, not how to build, how to tare it
apart,  
So Tell it all and fill up the air, but make it loud cause nobodies there,  
Nobodies there, nobodies there  
  
Stop, turn, take a look around,  
At all of the lights and sounds,  
Let them bring you in  
Slow, burn, let it all fade out,  
And pull the curtain down,  
Wonder where you've been  
  
I've got a way to work this out, I got a way and you know how  
I've got a way to work this out, I got a way and you know how  
I've got a way to work this out, I got a way  
I've got a way to work this out, I got a way and you know how  
I've got a way to work this out, I got a way and you know how  
I've got a way to work this out, I got a way  
I've got a way to work this out, I got a way and you know how  
I've got a way to work this out, I got a way and you know how  
I've got a way to work this out, I got a way  
  
Stop, turn, take a look around,  
At all of the lights and sounds,  
Let them bring you in  
Slow, burn, let it all fade out  
And pull the curtain down,  
Wonder where you've been  
  
You've earned everything you've found and painted faces frown,  
I'll say I knew you when
