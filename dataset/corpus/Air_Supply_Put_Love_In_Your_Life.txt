I don't need money and possessions  
I don't need things to weigh me down  
I don't need to be under suspicion  
For all the things that never come around  
All I need is you and your affection  
To be a part of everything you do  
To break through a lost communication  
To let me know that everything is true  
  
CHORUS  
Put love in your life, find it today and hold me tonight  
You know there will always be me  
There will always be you  
Put love in your life, open your heart it won't be denied  
The one you thought could not be  
Is waiting for you  
  
I don't need anxiety to hold me  
In the name of something to embrace  
I don't need society to scald me  
To pin me down and slap me in the face  
All I need is you and your affection  
To be the judge and jury in my life  
Searching for that moment of perfection  
To let me know we surely are alive  
  
CHORUS  
  
The puzzled look the years of doubt  
It all was meant to be  
We can't escape the dreams we make  
This feeling now just cannot wait  
So share it with me
