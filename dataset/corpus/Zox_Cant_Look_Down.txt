So we're a little bit older now.  
We're a little bit tired,  
A little bit scared of looking down.  
We wipe our weary eyes,  
And step into the storm outside.  
  
I'll be waiting,  
I'll be waiting,  
I'll be waiting for you.  
  
I'll be waiting,  
I'll be waiting,  
I'll be waiting for you now.  
I don't know where I'll end up tonight.  
Perfect pictures fade to black  
When you turn out the lights.  
  
And we're a little bit lonely now.  
We climbed a little too high,  
A little too fast,  
And we can't come down.  
And I've got two good eyes,  
But I still feel so blind sometimes.  
  
I'll be waiting,  
I'll be waiting,  
I'll be waiting for you.  
  
I'll be waiting,  
I'll be waiting,  
I'll be waiting for you now.  
I don't know where I'll end up tonight.  
Perfect pictures fade to black  
When you turn out the lights.  
When you turn out the lights...  
  
I'll be waiting,  
I'll be waiting,  
I'll be waiting for you.  
  
I'll be waiting,  
I'll be waiting,  
I'll be waiting for you.  
  
I'll be waiting,  
I'll be waiting,  
I'll be waiting for you.  
  
I'll be waiting,  
I'll be waiting,  
I'll be waiting for you.
