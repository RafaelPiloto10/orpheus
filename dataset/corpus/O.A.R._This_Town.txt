In the morning wake me up  
And tell me everything  
So I can understand your world  
And you can understand my dream  
Yeah I could be anywhere  
And you could be there with me  
But I just want to be a ghost  
And see everything  
  
I don't want it to be the way they want it  
  
[Chorus]  
This town, this night, this crowd  
Come on put them up, let me hear it loud  
This town, this city, this crowd  
Stand up on your feet put your worry down  
  
And everyone of you all around  
Come on yall let's take this town  
Let's take this town  
  
It's better that we keep this close  
Keep you close to me  
Walking under every sky  
Over every sea  
You can be my modern girl  
And I can be the one you found  
If we're taking on the world today  
I know we got to leave this town  
  
I don't want it to be the way they want it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And everyone of you all around  
Come on yall let's take this town  
Let's take this town  
  
Come on yall let's take this town  
Come on yall let's take it down  
On our own let's get away  
Nothing more left here to see  
Come on love make it perfect  
More and more I will believe  
Like a child I must believe  
Come on yall make it worth it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And everyone of you all around  
Come on yall let's take it  
Everyone of you in this crowd  
Come on yall let's take this town  
  
This town, this night, this crowd  
Come on put them up, let's take this town  
This town, this city, this crowd  
We're taking on the world today  
Come on put them up, and every one of you all around  
We can be anyway, take this town  
Come on put them up, we're taking on the world today  
Take this town, we could be anywhere
