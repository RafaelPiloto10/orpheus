When you have no light to guide you  
And no one to walk beside you  
I will come to you  
Oh, I will come to you  
When the night is dark and stormy  
You won't have to reach out for me  
I will come to you  
Oh, I will come to you  
  
Sometimes when all your dreams may have seen better days  
And you don't know how or why, but you've lost your way  
Have no fear when your tears are fallin'  
I will hear your spirit callin'  
And I swear I'll be there come what may  
  
When you have no light to guide you  
And no one to walk beside you  
I will come to you  
Oh, I will come to you  
When the night is dark and stormy  
You won't have to reach out for me  
I will come to you  
Oh, I will come to you  
I will come to you  
  
'Cause even if we can't be together  
We'll be friends now and forever  
And I swear that I'll be there come what may  
When the night is dark and stormy  
You won't have to reach out for me  
I will come to you  
Oh, I will come to you  
  
We all need somebody we can turn to  
Someone who'll always understand  
So if you feel that your soul is dyin'  
And you need the strength to keep tryin'  
I'll reach out and take your hand  
I'll reach out and take your hand  
  
Oh, I will come to you  
When you have no light to guide you  
And no one to walk to walk beside you  
I will come to you  
Oh, I will come to you  
When the night is dark and stormy  
You won't have to reach out for me  
I will come to you  
Oh, I will come to you  
Oh, I will come to you  
Oh, I will come to you  
I will come to you  
Oh, I will come to you
