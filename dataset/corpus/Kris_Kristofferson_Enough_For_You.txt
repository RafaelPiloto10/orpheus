I've lived enough  
To know that love's not everything you need  
God knows I know there are still so many things  
  
You want to be  
I've seen enough to understand the pain  
You're goin' through  
It's just a shame to know  
I'm not enough for you  
It hurts to see the hurt beneath  
Your laughter and your lies  
And try in vain to free the painful secret  
  
Locked behind your eyes  
And I can't even blame you  
For the things you're turning to  
It's just a shame to know  
I'm not enough for you.  
  
I've given you the best  
Of everything I had to give  
Now there's nothin' left for me to leave you  
But my will to live  
I hope someday  
  
Somebody somewhere loves you  
Like I do  
It's just a shame to know  
I'm not enough for you.
