I really can't stay  
Baby it's cold outside  
I've got to go away  
Baby it's cold outside  
This evening has been  
Been hoping that you'd drop in  
So very nice  
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice  
My mother will start to worry  
Beautiful, what's your hurry?  
And my father will be pacing the floor  
Just listen to that fireplace roar  
Now really I'd better scurry  
Sweetheart, what's your hurry?  
Well maybe just a half a drink more  
Why don't you put some records on while I pour  
All the neighbors might think  
But baby, it's bad out there  
Say, what's in this drink?  
No cabs to be had out there  
Oh, I wish I knew how  
Your eyes are like starlight now  
To break this spell  
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell  
I ought to say no, no, no, sir  
Mind if I move in closer  
At least I'm gonna say that I tried  
What's the sense in hurting my pride?  
I really can't stay  
Baby don't hold out  
Oh, but it's cold outside  
I simply must go  
Baby, it's cold outside  
The answer is no  
But baby, it's cold out there  
Oh, this welcome has been  
So lucky that you dropped in  
So nice and warm  
Look out that window at that storm  
My sister will be suspicious  
Gosh, your lips look delicious  
And my brother will be there at the door  
Waves upon a tropical shore  
Oh, my maiden aunt's mind is vicious  
Ooo, baby you're so delicious  
Well maybe just one little kiss more  
Never such a blizzard before  
Oh, I've got to go home  
You'll freeze to the bone out there  
Say, lend me a comb  
It's up to your knees out there  
You've really been grand  
I thrill when you touch my hand  
But don't you see?  
How can you do this thing to me?  
Oh, there's bound to be talk tomorrow  
Making my lifelong sorrow  
Well at least there will be plenty implied  
If you caught pneumonia and died  
But I really can't stay  
Get over that old out  
Baby it's cold outside  
Ooo ooo ooo  
Hey, I gotta get out of here  
Come on, baby  
Come on what?  
Just give me five minutes more  
You sure know how to wear a girl down, don't you?  
Okay, okay, okay, okay
