Have you heard the news  
That is going round  
He should know better  
  
Have you heard the news  
That boy's got dust for brains  
  
After all this time  
After all this time  
Now things, oh, can never be the same  
  
He should know better  
Always straight, always cool  
Endless style, nobody's fool  
And always with the grace and superb manner  
  
How he danced around the snakes  
Left them spinning in his way  
And stepped straight on the yellow skin banana  
  
He should know better  
  
In the early hours of day  
The black night  
He makes his way  
Regretfully into the morning fog  
  
Just one silly small mistake  
Now all his bones their gonna break  
To the curse and laughing smile  
Of the little green frog  
  
He should know better
