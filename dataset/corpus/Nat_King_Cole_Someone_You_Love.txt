Simple melodies become enchanting symphonies  
When you're with someone you love  
Starlit summer nights can hold a thousand new delights  
When you're with someone you love  
Every little flower seems to blossom by the hour  
With some rare perfume  
She can touch your hand and make a palace of a tiny room  
Happy things are gladder even sad things so much sadder  
When there's someone you love  
You can climb the ladder of romance  
And reach the stars above  
And when you've quarreled and vowed you would end it  
How sweet it is when you mend it  
You're just not you without  
Can't do without that someone you love
