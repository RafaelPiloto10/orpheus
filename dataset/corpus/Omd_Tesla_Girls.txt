No no no  
Tesla girls Tesla girls  
Testing out theories  
Electric chairs and dynamos  
Dressed to kill they're killing me  
But heaven knows their recipe  
  
No no no  
  
You wouldn't believe me if I said  
The things I've seen went over my head  
I've been patient heaven knows  
I've learned the rules and how it goes  
I can't sit still or settle down  
And when I walk I don't touch the ground  
See those girls they're heaven blessed  
I guess it's so they know best  
  
Tesla girls Tesla girls  
Writing in their diaries  
Now and then they'll watch tv  
Now and then they'll speak to me  
But heaven knows their recipe  
  
No no no  
  
You wouldn't believe them if they said  
The things they've seen went over their heads  
They've been patient heaven knows  
They seem to care and so it goes  
They can't sit still or settle down  
And when they walk they don't touch the ground  
See those girls they're heaven blessed  
I guess it's so they know best  
  
Tesla girls  
Tesla girls  
Tesla girls  
Tesla girls  
  
Tesla girls Tesla girls  
Testing out theories  
Electric chairs and dynamos  
Dressed to kill they're killing me  
  
Tesla girls Tesla girls  
I'm in love with Tesla girls  
Now and then they'll watch tv  
Now and then they'll speak to me  
But heaven knows their recipe  
  
No no no
