You wake up in the morning  
And you're not feeling quite the same  
You feel a gentle hand upon you  
But you seem to have forgotten her name  
You put on your clothes  
You're heading home  
You're hoping and praying you  
Won't be all alone  
Chorus:  
When you get there  
When you get there  
You haven't had a chance to think  
About explaining where you slept till noon  
You can't say you were working all night  
Cause it's Sunday afternoon  
The truth is too hard  
You'll never come back  
'Cause a one night stand is not  
Worth the attack  
Chorus:  
When you get there  
When you get there  
You're walking up to our front door  
As my face comes into view  
You think you've got a pretty good lie  
You say you slept at Mary Lou's  
You open the door  
You start telling lies  
But then from the hall  
You hear Mary Lou cry  
Chorus:  
When you get there  
When you get there  
When you get there  
When you get there
