I heard your heart, you held it close to me.  
The wild embrace, the silent sea,  
A whisper of imagery for Lovers Supreme.  
But now I'm lost in the crowd,  
No shadow of a doubt  
It's all over now,  
No shadow of a doubt.  
You changed the dream.  
You changed the scenery,  
the tender touch, the urge to breathe,  
There under a lovelit sun  
What's lost could be found.  
But now, no trace of a sound,  
no shadow of a doubt.  
I'm faraway bound.  
No shadow of a doubt.
