If time were not a moving thing  
And I could make it stay  
This love we shared  
Would always be  
There'd be no coming day  
No morning light above  
To make me realize our love  
Is over  
  
And now you walk away from me  
And there's no place to put my hand  
Except to shade my eyes  
Against the sun that comes to warm the land  
I watch you walk away somehow  
I have to let you go now  
It's over  
  
It's too late to tell you how I feel  
Our love was real  
And yet, there are so many times  
That people have to love and then forget  
Though there might have been a way  
I have to force myself to say  
It's over  
  
And so I walk away and turn my collar to the wind  
I walk along in silence trying not to think at all  
I put my feet before me  
Walk the silent street before me  
It's over  
  
If time were not a moving thing  
And I could make it stay  
This love we shared would always be  
There'd be no coming day  
No morning light above  
To make me realize our love  
Is over  
  
It's over  
It's over  
It's over
