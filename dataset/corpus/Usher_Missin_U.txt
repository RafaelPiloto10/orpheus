[Intro]  
I, mean, everybody want somebody that's got confidence  
You know it's in her attitude  
The way she walks, nice legs  
She's gotta be beautiful, nice thin waist  
Fat ass, ooh  
And them soft little lips  
Little lips, little lips, little lips  
  
[Breakdown]  
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips  
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips  
I wonder if your lips are as soft as I imagine them to be  
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips  
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips  
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips  
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips  
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips  
The crazy shit is you're the only girl I love  
Little lips, little lips, little lips  
[Verse 1]  
I reminisce of all of the things that don't exist yet  
Like the breakfast on Sunday mornings after drunk sex  
Or when you're out with your girls and you send me a drunk text  
Saying "Baby are you far, want you to come closer to my heart"  
I miss you girl, whoever you are  
  
[Hook]  
Oh, I miss you, already  
And I just wanna kiss you, already  
So come on, come on, come on  
If you are ready, hurry up to the home  
You don't know I miss you, already  
Girl I miss you, yeah  
  
[Breakdown]  
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips  
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips  
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips  
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips  
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips  
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips  
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips  
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips  
  
[Verse 2]  
Pillow cases covered in traces of your makeup  
And, if I ever cheat, all I'm gonna taste is your flavor, real shit  
I dreamt about you last night, I ain't wanna wake up  
Even though I can't see you so far  
Lookin' just like the the tint of my car  
I miss you girl, whoever you are  
  
[Hook]  
Oh, I miss you, already  
And I just wanna kiss you, already  
So come on, come on, come on  
If you are ready, hurry up to the home  
You don't know I miss you already  
  
[Post-Hook]  
I like the way your frame is  
I wonder if your sex is as good as I assume it's gonna be  
The crazy shit is you already knew what it was  
  
[Outro]  
Take this, take that girl, but don't take time  
To take my heart, baby come claim mine  
Won't wait forever but I wait for you  
Don't take too long girl cause I'm missin' you  
  
[Hook]  
Oh, I miss you, already  
And I wanna kiss you, already  
So come on, come on, come on  
If you are ready, hurry up to the phone  
You don't know I miss you, already  
Girl I miss you, yeah
