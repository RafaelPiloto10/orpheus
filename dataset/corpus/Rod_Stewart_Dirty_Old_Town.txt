Found my love by the gaswork croft  
Dreamed a dream by the old canal  
Kissed my girl by the factory wall  
Dirty old town, dirty old town  
  
I heard a siren from the dock  
Saw a train set the night on fire  
Smelled the spring on the sulfured wind  
Dirty old town, whoa-oh, dirty old town  
  
We're goin' to take a good sharp axe  
Shining steel tempered in the fire  
And we'll chop you down like an old dead tree  
Dirty old town, dirty old town  
Dirty old town, whoa-oh, dirty old town  
  
And oh we'll chop you down  
Oh, dirty, dirty, dirty old town  
Dirty old town, dirty old town  
And oh whoa-oh dirty old town  
Chop you down one of these days
