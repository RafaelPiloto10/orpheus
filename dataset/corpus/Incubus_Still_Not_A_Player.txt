Up in the hot tub, bubbly, spot love, punish me  
Don't stop, watch the Pun get wicked  
When I stick it, even Luke be like, 'Don't stop, get it, get it'

In house beach, French Countess, ten thou piece  
Rent-out lease, with a option to buy  
Coppin' a five-oh Benz for when I'm not, far up in the sky  
Puffin the lye, from my Twinzito  
Up in the Benzito with my kiko from Queens, nicknamed Perico  
We go back like PA's and wearin' PJ's

But you know Big Pun and Brock still down behind  
I love from butter pecan to blackberry molass'

Long as you show class, and pass my test  
Fat, highly intelligent bachlorettes  
That's the best, I won't settle for less  
I wanna get a brunette, with unforgettable sex  
I lay your head on my chest, come feel my heartbeat  
We can park the Jeep, pump Mobb Deep, and just spark the  
It's hard to creep since I found Joe  
Every pretty round brown, wanna go down low  
But this Boogie Down professional, I'ma let you know  
Once I quit the blows, get your clothes, 'cause you got to go  
I could go downstairs, little brown hairs everywhere  
You nasty Brock, I don't care  
Round here they call me Big Pun, if you with the big guns  
Take time, known to make a chick

But it don't stop, watch the Pun get wicked  
When I stick it even Luke be like, 'Don't stop, get it get it'
