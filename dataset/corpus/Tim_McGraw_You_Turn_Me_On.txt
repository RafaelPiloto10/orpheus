Yeah I swore to offer love  
I swore off women  
Devoted my life to huntin' and fishin'  
I'd never be anyone else's lovesick fool  
It ain't cool  
I spend all my spare time  
Fixin' up  
That old rusted up pick up truck  
In no time at all  
I'd have it lookin' like brand new  
Then you...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Flip the switch on my Dumaflachi  
Played my piano like Liberace  
I let down my guard  
And my heart was as good as gone  
So long  
Yeah, ya cranked my tractor  
Ya flick my bic  
Woman you trig my trigger on my thing-a-majig  
Can't explain how ya done it  
But, honey, you turn me on  
  
You done all the takin'  
I done all the gettin'  
I threw up my hands, said  
"The heck with it"  
I shut down my heart  
Locked it up and pulled the fuse  
Before it blew  
All my emotions were disconnected  
No sign of a spark  
The big detector  
I had nobody  
So I had nothing to lose  
Then you...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, ya crank my tractor  
Ya flick my bic  
Woman you trig the trigger on my thing-a-majig  
Can explain how you done it  
But, honey, you turn me on  
  
I can't handle that baby  
You better slow down  
Shhwwwooo!
