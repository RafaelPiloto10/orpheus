'Bang!' goes another kanga  
On the bonnet of the van.  
"See the light ram through the gaps in the land."  
Many an Aborigine's mistaken for a tree  
'Til you near him on the motorway  
And the tree begin to breathe.  
"See the light ram through the gaps in the land."  
  
("Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha")  
  
Coming in with the golden light  
In the morning.  
Coming in with the golden light  
Is the New Man.  
Coming in with the golden light  
Is my dented van.  
  
Woomera.

The civilized keep alive  
The territorial war.  
"See the light ram through the gaps in the land."  
Erase the race that claim the place  
And say we dig for ore,  
Or dangle devils in a bottle  
And push them from the Pull of the Bush.  
"See the light ram through the gaps in the land."  
You find them in the road.  
"See the light bounce off the rocks to the sand."  
In the road.  
  
Coming in with the golden light  
In the morning.  
Coming in with the golden light  
With no warning.  
Coming in with the golden light  
We bring in the rigging.  
Dig, dig, dig, dig away.
