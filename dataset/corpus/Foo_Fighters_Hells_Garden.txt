Blew it all away  
Blew it all away  
Living green and gray  
Blew it all away  
  
Read to past the time  
Sappy open line, turns to yours and mine  
Read to past the time..  
  
You and I in hells garden  
Hells garden the way it used to work  
I'm in hells gard, hells gard, pay to watch em' burn  
I'm in hells gard, hells gard, wait another turn  
I'm in hells gard, hells gard, will be true the world  
  
Blew it all away  
Blew it all away  
Living green and gray  
Blew it all away  
  
You and I in hells garden  
Hells garden the way it used to work  
I'm in hells gard, hells gard, pay to watch em' burn  
I'm in hells gard, hells gard, will be true the world  
I'm in hells gard, hells gard, wait another turn  
I'm in hells gard, hells gard, wait it all the world  
I'm in hells gard, hells gard, will be true the world  
I'm in hells gard, hells gard, wait it all the world
