Danny got of yellow school bus  
Looking so sad today, you see it on his face  
Mommy and Daddy have been fighting again  
Every time they fight, he's caught in the middle of it all  
He has dreams, like every little boy in the world.  
But right now his main dream,  
Is to get out of here.  
Is to see Mommy and Daddy disappear forever.  
He doesn't wanna hear those angry voices anymore  
Danny, be careful what you wish for  
You might just get it.  
Be careful O!! Oh!! Oh!!  
  
Chorus  
You can choose your friend, but you cannot  
Choose, who you related to.  
  
He goes up to his room, he's not feeling good today  
But it's no use, telling, nobody listens here  
No use complaining, nobody cares around here  
Little boys go to sleep and pray  
For toys and candy, he prays for one thing  
God I need a miracle down here  
Will you make, Mommy and Daddy?  
Disappear forever  
Danny, be careful what you wish for  
You might just, get it.  
Be careful Oh!! Oh!! Oh!!  
  
Chorus  
You can choose your friend, but you cannot  
Choose, who you related to.
