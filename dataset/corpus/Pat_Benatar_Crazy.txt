People like to shake you up and put you down  
Run you all around, drive you crazy  
Like to steal the roses right out of your bed  
Get inside your head, drive you crazy  
Never really knew what love could be, yeh  
Never really thought about you and me, yeh  
Crazy - I really want to go crazy  
Feel like I'm gonna go crazy  
Crazy - I really want to go crazy  
Feel like I'm gonna go crazy  
  
Everybody tells you how you ought to be  
What they think they see, they can't teach you, no  
Big world on your shoulder, it don't mean a thing  
If that song they sing, hey - don't reach you  
Never really knew what love could be, yeh  
Only want to think about you and me, yeh  
  
Crazy - I really want to go crazy  
Feel like I'm gonna go crazy  
Crazy - I really want to go crazy  
Feel like I'm gonna go crazy  
Crazy, Crazy  
Hey Baby, Baby, oh, oh, oh  
  
Crazy, Crazy, Crazy  
Crazy - I really want to go crazy  
Feel like I'm gonna go crazy  
Feel like I'm gonna go crazy  
Crazy - feel like I'm gonna go crazy
