Jamaica's alright, if you wanna get in the middle of a knife fight  
Jamaica's alright, if you wanna get aids or dysentery  
Jamaica's alright, if you wanna be mugged or murdered  
Jamaica's alright, if you're a misogynist, or a homophobe  
  
Jamaica's alright, if you like only one kind of music  
Jamaica's alright, if you like small bananas and spiders  
Jamaica's alright, if you wanna buy drugs from your hotel room  
Jamaica's alright, if you want your hand lopped off by a machete
