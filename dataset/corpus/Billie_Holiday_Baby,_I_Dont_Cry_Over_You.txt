Had my lunch all alone  
Waited for you to phone  
Said you call me at two  
So at abpout twenty of three  
I had cocktails with Lee  
Baby, I don't cry over you  
  
Stood me up in the rain  
Tried to hurt me again  
Bet you thought I'd be blue  
I went out to a show  
With a swell guy named Joe  
Baby, I don't cry over you  
  
These foolish games you keep playing  
Might work with somebody else  
But I could have told you  
Right from the start  
No man is man enough  
To break my heart  
  
If you don't come tonight  
Think you'll give me a fright  
Tell you what I will do  
I'll put on my best gown  
And go painting this town  
Baby, I don't cry over you  
  
Listen Jack you're sweet Jill  
Will be out with some Bill  
Maybe I don't cry over you
