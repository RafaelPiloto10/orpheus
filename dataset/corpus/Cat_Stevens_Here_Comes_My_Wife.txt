Well here comes my wife  
And that's the story of my life  
She haunts me though she don't want me  
She follows badly in disguise  
But it's not hard to recognize her 'cause she's cryin'  
She looks like dyin' on me  
  
Her father's rich, I think a millionaire  
But money doesn't make him better  
It just makes him better to be there  
So, you can tell him that it's quite alright with me  
No no, it's quite alright with me  
  
Well here comes my wife  
And that's the story of my life  
She haunts me though she don't want me  
She follows badly in disguise  
But it's not hard to recognize her 'cause she's cryin'  
She looks like dyin' on me  
  
See that shadow dancin' on the floor  
She's coming up behind me  
How I'd love to tell her she's a bore,  
But I tell her that it's quite alright, no no, it's quite alright with me  
  
Well here comes my wife  
And that's the story of my life  
She haunts me though she don't want me  
She follows badly in disguise  
But it's not hard to recognize her 'cause she's cryin'  
She looks like dyin' on me  
Oh oh
