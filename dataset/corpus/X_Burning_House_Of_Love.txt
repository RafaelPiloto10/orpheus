Drive by my house late at night  
You can see from the freeway above  
No silhouette, but a light left on  
Burning there for love  
smoke is rising from the fire  
Coming out my back door  
I'm inside, sound asleep  
Cigarette on the floor  
Burning there for love  
well I can still remember  
A couple of years ago  
When the smoke and flame called my name  
It was a burning house of love  
that rusty nail over our front door  
Is where I hung our tears in the rain  
I threw that horseshoe into the weeds  
To see what luck can bring  
cause you're in your bed, I'm in mine  
On either side of town  
I think I might take a ride  
And burn your love house down  
Like a burning house of love
