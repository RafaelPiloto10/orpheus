They customised their gear and synchronised  
They flame out in the streets with flame in their eyes  
Guerilla operator ain't heard of cool  
Check out any wall... One hundred punks rule  
One hundred punks rule!  
  
A hundred punks run with London town  
Down "Wardour Street" to "Soho Sound"  
Don't sleep all day only when they fall down  
  
A hundred rumble boys and tumble girls  
Protected by steel in a private world  
Tomorrow's famous faces advertise today  
And the studs on their back say  
One hundred punks rule.... One hundred punks rule!  
  
A hundred punks run the loaded gun  
They look so sharp they look like one  
If you ain't got the look you'll never be one  
  
A hundred punks run with total suss  
A hundred good mates you know you can trust  
There's never no bother and there's no fuss  
Check out any wall... One hundred punks rule  
One hundred punks rule!  
  
And Jimmy's number 101 knows one day he'll be one  
Watch him..... Watch him go!  
  
A hundred punks run the leather army  
I know whose by my side not at home with tv  
Even when I'm down I hear them sing for me  
Check out any wall... One hundred punks rule  
One hundred punks rule!  
  
Check out any wall... One hundred punks rule  
One hundred punks rule!  
And check out the walls... One hundred punks rule  
One hundred punks rule!... Ok
