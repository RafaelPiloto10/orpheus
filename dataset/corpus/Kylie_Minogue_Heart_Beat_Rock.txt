Lovers in the back seat  
Boys in the back street  
Girls in their tight wash  
Figure hugging blue jeans  
  
They're looking like they want  
To show out what they got  
Their feet are itching to dance  
Their bodies ready to rock  
  
I've been around the world  
But I'm not those other girls  
I'm feeling special do you like what you see?  
'Cause I got my best dress on  
Can I be your fantasy?  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause I can make your heartbeat rock  
I can make your heartbeat rock  
I can make your heartbeat rock  
I can make your heartbeat rock  
I can make your heartbeat rock ooh, ooh  
Baby show me what you got  
Baby show me what you got  
I can make you so damn hot  
I can make you so damn hot  
'Cause I can make your heart beat  
  
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah  
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah  
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah  
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah  
  
Ladies in the spotlight  
Boys are checking their tights  
Skirts out while their hips sway  
Bumping to the hot track  
People take a step back  
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah  
  
I've been around the world  
But I'm not those other girls  
I'm feeling special do you like what you see?  
'Cause I got my best dress on  
Can I be your fantasy?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah  
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah  
'Cause I can make your heart beat  
  
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah  
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah  
'Cause I can make your heart beat  
  
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah  
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah  
  
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah  
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah  
  
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah  
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
