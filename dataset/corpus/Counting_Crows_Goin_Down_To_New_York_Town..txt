Well I feel just like a freight train baby,  
Running out of steam.  
I wanna go on down to New York town,  
But I'm stuck in between.  
And I could stay on here at home alone  
And have myself to thank,  
But I just made a billion dollars  
And I don't wanna put it in the bank,  
So if you call...  
We could go to town.  
Well dear mom,  
If you could see me now here underneath the lights  
I gotta keep 'em on from dusk to dawn  
And everything's alright.  
I met a girl with autumn in her eyes  
And summer in the way  
She makes me feel  
Like I was only born today or yesterday,  
And if she calls...  
We could go to town.  
But everybody here  
Hates everything I say,  
And girl I just don't know  
If I can last another day.  
So I guess I'm going back,  
Back where I belong,  
I hope you come along  
Before I get back on that train that takes me...  
Home from New York City  
To the things I left behind  
And 'though I ain't got no money girl  
, I'll always have the time.  
But I wish that you would hurry,  
I hope you get here soon  
'cause I just sold the sky to the sun  
So I could buy for you the moon.  
And if you call...  
We could go to town. So if you call...  
Yeah, if you call...  
Girl, if you call...  
We could go to town.
