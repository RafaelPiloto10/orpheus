Mother of us all  
Place of our birth  
How can we stand aside  
And watch the rape of the wold  
  
This the beginning of the end  
This the most heinous of crimes  
This the deadliest of sins  
The greatest violation of all time  
  
Mother of us all  
Place of our birth  
We all are witness  
To the rape of the world  
  
You've seen her stripped mined  
You've heard of bombs exploded underground  
You know the sun shines  
Hotter than ever before  
  
Mother of us all  
Place of our birth  
We all are witness  
To the rape of the world  
  
Some claim to have crowned her  
A queen  
With cities of concrete and steel  
But there is no glory no honor  
In what results  
From the rape of the world  
  
Mother of us all  
Place of our birth  
We all are witness  
To the rape of the world  
  
She has been clear-cut  
She has been dumped on  
She has been poisoned and beaten up  
And we have been witness  
To the rape of the world  
  
Mother of us all  
Place of our birth  
How can we stand aside  
And watch the rape of the world  
  
If you look you'll see it with your own eyes  
If you listen you will hear her cries  
If you care you will stand and testify  
And stop the rape of the world  
  
Stop the rape of the world  
Mother of us all  
Mother of us all  
Mother of us all  
Mother of us all
