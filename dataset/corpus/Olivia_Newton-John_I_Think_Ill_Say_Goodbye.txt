I never tried to change you  
But the hurt is changing me  
I only want to be myself  
And you won't let that be  
I can't play an actor's role  
'Cause I can't live a lie  
Life's too short and night's too long  
To let them pass us by  
So I'll be closing the door in the morning  
And I won't wake you when I rise  
'Cause there's nothing to say before going  
You think that I said it all  
So I think I'll say goodbye  
Believin' came so easy when our love was flowin' free  
But there's a wall of darkness where sunshine used to be  
One more wrong tomorrow  
Is one more wasted day  
And holdin' on to love that's gone  
We'll never find our way  
So I'll be closing the door in the morning  
And I won't wake you when I rise  
'Cause there's nothing to say before going  
You think that I said it all  
So I think I'll say goodbye
