Rebecca Lynn grew up in Carolina  
Half a mile from Tucker Cherry's farm  
A quiet girl with green eyes full of fire  
Her daddy's pride and all her mama's charm  
Rebecca Lynn became my heart's desire  
Long about the start of second grade  
Mrs. Roosenbloom let me sit beside her  
So we'd pass notes and after school we'd play  
  
[Chorus]  
Singing ring around the rosie  
Pocket full of dreams and posies  
Patty cake and baker's man  
Tag your it, kick the can  
  
And I think I hear my mama calling  
Gotta go  
Man I loved her so  
  
High school days with me and Becky learning what it really means to be in love  
Give and take, holding back for Heaven's sake  
And fighting for a week and making up  
I said please Becky won't you marry me  
Prom night in my car out by the curb  
She was so surprised, first she laughed and then she cried  
And somewhere in my heart I'm sure I heard  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mama flashed the porch light for me  
Gotta go  
Man I loved her so  
  
When love is wrong it dies and that's the way it goes  
But when it's right, your love grows  
  
Laura Jean was born in Tennessee  
Now that's a common little miracle I know.  
But for me and Becky Lynn she's the dream that started  
When we fell in love so many years ago  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I think I hear your mama calling  
Gotta go  
Oh man I loved you so
