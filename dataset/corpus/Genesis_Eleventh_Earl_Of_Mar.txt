The sun had been up for a couple of hours,  
Covered the ground with a layer of gold.  
Spirits were high and the raining had stopped,  
The larder was low, But boy that wasn't all.  
Eleventh Earl of Mar  
Couldn't get them very far.  
Daddy! Oh Daddy, You Promised.  
  
Out on the road in the direction of Perth,  
Backwards and forwards in a circle they went.  
Found a city half open and ready to greet,  
The conquering heros, with blisters on their feet.  
Eleventh Earl of Mar  
Somehow got them all this far.  
Daddy! You Promised, You Promised.  
  
See the Stewart are dressed up  
He's got eyes in the back of his head.  
Who came in a cockleshell boat  
That could only just float,  
Couldn't even lift a sword.  
Dressed too fine and smelling of wine.  
  
Daddy you've got to go!  
Here come the bishop all dressed up  
He's gonna bless you if you're ready to pay  
One wave of his funny old stick,  
There's a band of light across your eyes.  
  
Waited a week still they hadn't appeared,  
That glorious timing that everyone feared.  
So they're riding along on the crest of a wave,  
They're headed for London, And that will be their grave  
Eleventh Earl of Mar  
Well he couldn't get them down that far  
Daddy! I'm waiting, I'm waiting  
  
Time to go to bed now  
Never seems too keen  
To be a guest now  
In a house of dreams  
  
Flying from a hillside  
Beckoning the trees  
A sailboat's awning  
Mimicking the breeze  
  
I'm fighting gravity falling  
My Daddy won't let them get me  
A voice screams seems to be calling  
The face turns features are burning.  
  
Daddy, you've got to go!  
See the fifteen going by,  
Tell the Lairds and the Lords  
They're running backwards today,  
And once again you stand alone.  
  
Bury your memories bury your friends,  
Leave it alone for a year or two.  
Till the stories go hazy and the legends come true,  
Then do it again. Some Things never end.  
Eleventh Earl of Mar  
Won't be going very far.  
You Promised, You Promised, You Promised.  
DADDY!
