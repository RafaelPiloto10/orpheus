Love, love, love, love, love  
Say the word so very losely  
Where we come from is love, love, pure love  
And we're on our way back home  
  
And on that way, you never look back  
'Cause there's nothing there to see  
Just look around you  
There's always someone that's in need  
  
Of Maybe just kindness  
As we watch each other bleed  
From wounds we choose  
We never lose  
  
Love, love, love, love, love  
Misunderstood yet so desired  
We pay the cost for love, love, real love  
But we get back so much more, so much more  
  
So many questions  
Beginning to unfold  
I look for the answers  
In the middle of my soul  
  
I know you're out there  
And it's not like I've been told  
So I run to you  
I run to you  
  
To find the path of the right love  
Oh yeah the path of the right love  
We're on the path of the one love  
Oh yeah the path of the right love  
  
Love, love, love, love, love  
All around yet so elusive  
If we don't reach out for love, love, this love  
We're all just wasting time, precious time  
  
When in the long run  
What's meant to be will be  
Those things we ask for  
Become our destiny  
  
But while we're living  
Our souls can not be free  
Eventually, we will come to see  
To find the path of the right love, right love, right love  
  
Oh yeah the path of the right love  
We're on the path of the one love, yeah, yeah  
Oh yeah the path of the right love  
And that love, love, love, true love  
  
Must surely be good, must surely be kind  
And that love sweet love, strong love  
Is meant to be yours, is meant to be mine  
And I do believe if we share this life  
  
We must learn to share all it's pain and strife  
To find the path of the right love  
Oh yeah the path of the right love  
We're on the path of the one love  
  
Oh yeah the path of the right love  
To find the path of the right love  
Oh yeah the path of the right love  
We're on the path of the one love  
  
Oh yeah the path of the right love  
Aspire to your inevitable bliss  
And every grace will be given you
