Brother brother brother,  
No matter who's right and who is wrong  
Just want you to know my love's still strong  
I wrote you a prayer with this song  
  
Brothrt older brother,  
You told me you broke up with your wife  
There's been so much suffering in your life  
Thanks to the grace from above your humbled heart is alive  
  
Oh I pray for you 'cause some day  
All loved ones die  
Yes I pray that we're rejoined in the afterlife  
  
Brother brother brother,  
Your baby boy has he's mothers eyes  
With the love of you both he'll be strong and wise  
Once his muscles are grown you'll be running side by side  
  
Brother younger brother you and your fiancee are one  
I'm sure the fruits of your love will be passed on  
To the beautiful children still to come  
  
Oh I pray for you 'cause someday  
All loved ones die  
Yes I'll pray that we're rejoined in the afterlife  
  
Father father father,  
Oh I love you with all my heart  
You've done an amazing part  
All the angels will come when you're ready to depart  
  
Sisters all my sisters,  
I didn't forget you, don't get me wrong  
I'll express my love for each single one  
In the future to come exclusive song  
  
But in the mean time  
  
Oh I pray,...
