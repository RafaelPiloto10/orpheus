Keep your distance, you'll never know how it feels.  
I've been to places that took my mind away from me.  
Your aiming questions opens the wound that just won't heal.  
I'm just a man that uncle sam gave the dark side of the deal.  
So much for the constitution and the home of the free,  
Fighting for a nation that's brought me to my knees.  
Wherever I go, people wanna know  
Who's that mystery man?  
I stand all alone, my name carved in stone.  
I'm the mystery man.  
Out in the jungle, I didn't know then what I know now.  
Out in the jungle, I faced the danger next to me.  
Deep in the trenches I could have died, it was understood.  
I couldn't cry, too afraid to show the fear.  
Wherever I go, people wanna know  
Who's that mystery man?  
I stand all alone, my name carved in stone.  
I'm the mystery man.  
Wherever I go, people wanna know  
Who's that mystery man?  
I'm living the pain and stuck with that name,  
The mystery man.
