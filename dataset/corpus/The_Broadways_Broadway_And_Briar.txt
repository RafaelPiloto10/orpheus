I wait for my friends to get off work and stand and smoke  
And a crazy man sits next to me  
Looking down at a pile of his broken dreams  
And he won't even look at me I'm still young  
And have so far to go  
And he says to a passerby with a sad sad smile,  
"does anyone know?"  
"who do I have to kill to see a familiar face in this town?  
It seems like all my old friends have moved awa why"  
I feel like I know what he means  
Will 10 years go by and no one remember my name?  
I don't want it to be that way  
But it happened to this guy and I'm exactly the same as him  
But I'm young and have so far to go  
And I've seen what happens to pe ople  
It's just years and years of letting lonliness grow he said -  
..he means youth doesn't last forever and neither do dreams.
