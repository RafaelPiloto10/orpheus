[Spoken]  
I need time (time)  
Love  
Joy (joy)  
I need space  
I need me  
(Action!)  
  
Say hello to the girl that I am!  
You're gonna have to see through my perspective  
I need to make mistakes just to learn who I am  
And I don't want to be so damn protected  
  
There must be another way  
'Cause I believe in taking chances  
But who am I to say  
What a girl is to do  
God, I need some answers  
  
What am I to do with my life  
(You will find out don't worry)  
How Am I supposed to know what's right?  
  
(You just got to do it your way)  
I can't help the way I feel  
But my life has been so overprotected  
  
I tell 'em what I like  
What I want  
And what I don't  
But every time I do I stand corrected  
  
Things that I've been told  
I can't believe what I hear about the world, I realize  
I'm Overprotected  
  
There must be another way  
'Cause I believe in taking chances  
But who am I to say  
What a girl is to do  
God I need some answers  
  
What am I to do with my life  
(You will find out don't worry)  
How Am I supposed to know what's right?  
  
(You just got to do it your way)  
I can't help the way I feel  
But my life has been so overprotected  
  
I need? time (love)  
I need? space  
(This is it, this is it)  
  
I don't need nobody  
Tellin me just what I want to  
What I what what I'm gonna  
(I need)  
  
Do about my destiny  
I Say No, No  
Nobody tell me just what what what I want to do, (do)  
I'm so fed up with people telling me to be  
Someone else but me  
  
(Action!)  
  
What am I to do with my life  
(You will find out don't worry)  
How Am I supposed to know what's right?  
  
(You just got to do it your way)  
I can't help the way I feel  
But my life has been so overprotected  
  
I don't need nobody  
Tellin' me just what I want to  
What I what what I'm gonna  
Do about my destiny  
  
I Say No, No  
Ain't nobody tell me just what I want to do, do  
I'm so fed up with people telling me to be  
Someone else but me  
  
What am I to do with my life  
(You will find out don't worry)  
How Am I supposed to know what's right?  
(You just got to do it your way)  
I can't help the way I feel  
But my life has been so overprotected.
