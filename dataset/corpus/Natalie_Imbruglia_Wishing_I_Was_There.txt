Take your hand  
And place it in my pocket  
Flick your eyes back in their sockets  
Put those thoughts away  
Sometimes they're much to loud  
I'll take a breath  
And cradle your sweet head  
Should've stayed at home in bed  
Put that face away  
I'm melting for you  
I know, I get cold  
'cause I can't leave things well alone  
Understand I'm accident prone  
Me, I get free  
Every night the moon is mine  
But when the morning comes  
Don't say you love me  
Don't say you need me  
I really don't think that's fair  
Boy I'm not so dumb  
But when you leave me  
I'll be wishing I, wishing I, wishing, I was there  
I dreamt about another girl in bed with you  
You just laughed and smiled  
Denied the proof  
We're fine till I think of the problem  
I wish it made sense  
Like a joke that no one gets  
It's a life without regret  
I want it to feel that way, forever and ever  
I know, I get cold  
'cause I can't leave things well alone  
Understand I'm accident prone  
Me, I get free  
Every night the moon is mine  
But when the morning comes  
Don't say you love me  
Don't say you need me  
I really don't think that's fair  
Boy I'm not so dumb  
But when you leave me  
I'll be wishing I, wishing I, wishing I was there  
I'll be wishing I, wishing I, wishing I was there with you  
I'll be wishing I, wishing I, wishing I was there  
I'll be wishing I, wishing I, wishing I was there with you  
Don't say you love me  
Don't say you need me  
I really don't think that's fair  
Boy I'm not so dumb  
But when you leave me  
I'll be wishing I, wishing I, wishing, I was there with you  
I'll be wishing I, wishing I, wishing, I was there  
I'll be wishing I, wishing I, wishing, I was there with you  
I'll be wishing I, wishing I, wishing, I was there  
I'll be wishing I, wishing I, wishing, I was there with you  
I'll be wishing I, wishing I, wishing, I was there  
I'll be wishing I, wishing I, wishing, I was there with you
