I'm gonna paper all my walls with your love letters  
And invite you over some night  
I'm gonna read you every line where you promised to be mine  
And show you all the vows you made in black and white  
But if you think you're fooling me with your love love letters  
Well baby, now it's time you knew the score  
I'm gonna find somebody new to write me love letters  
And paper them all over yours  
  
I'm gonna paper all my walls with your love letters  
And invite you over some night  
I'm gonna read you every line where you promised to be mine  
And show you all the vows you made in black and white  
But if you think you're fooling me with your love love letters  
Well baby, now it's time you knew the score  
I'm gonna find somebody new to write me love letters  
And paper them all over yours  
All over yours
