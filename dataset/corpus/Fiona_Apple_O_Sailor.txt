I'm undecided about you again  
I can be right that you're not here  
It's double sided 'cause I ruined it all  
But also saved myself  
By never believing you dear  
Everything good I deem too good to be true  
Everything else is just a bore  
Everything I have to look forward to  
Has a pretty painful and very imposing before  
Oh sailor why'd you do it  
What'd you do that for  
Saying there's nothing to it  
Then lettin' it go by the boards  
Oh sailor why'd you do it  
What'd you do that for  
Saying there's nothing to it  
Then lettin' it go by the boards  
I have too been playing with fifty-two cards  
Just 'cause I play so far from my vest  
Whatever I've got, I've got no reason to guard  
What could I do but spend my best  
Oh sailor why'd you do it  
What'd you do that for  
Saying there's nothing to it  
Then lettin' it go by the boards  
Oh sailor why'd you do it  
What'd you do that for  
Saying there's nothing to it  
Then lettin' it go by the boards  
And after waiting, fighting patiently on my knees  
All the other stuff tired itself out first, not me  
And in its wake appeared the touch and call of a different breed  
One of the steps is getting wise and got me there and then got me  
And what a thing to know what could be instead  
Oh what a blessed curse to see  
Took the agenda from its place in my bed  
Made a merry paramour of me  
Oh sailor why'd you do it  
What'd you do that for  
Saying there's nothing to it  
Then lettin' it go by the boards  
Oh sailor why'd you do it  
What'd you do that for  
Given the eyes to view it  
As it goes by the boards  
Oh sailor why'd you do it  
What'd you do that for  
Saying there's nothing to it  
Then lettin' it go by the boards  
Oh sailor why'd you do it  
What'd you do that for  
Saying there's nothing to it  
Then lettin' it go by the boards  
Oh sailor why'd you do it  
What'd you do that for  
Given the eyes to view it  
As it goes by the boards  
Oh sailor why'd you do it  
What'd you do that for  
Given the eyes to view it  
As it goes by the boards
