The other side of The Mountain  
Is where I want to be  
It's a far piece over The Mountain  
But I hope you'll go with me  
  
I grew up as a dreamer  
I found that dreams aren't free  
Now I want you here with me  
  
I've lived so long near the mountain  
It's almost part of me  
I want to have it behind me  
It blocks out all I can see  
It looms up dark and ancient  
Its shadow over me  
I want it behind me  
  
All that time, all that precious time  
It's gone from you and me  
We're givin' up this scene  
We're givin' up this scene  
  
Now some will say that we're destined  
Some will call it fate  
Me I call it obsession  
It's just like love and hate  
We're prisoners of our passion  
We all seem to find too late  
I hope it's not too late  
We're givin' up this scene  
Ah babe we're givin' up this scene  
  
We're gettin' out  
We're givin' up this scene  
You and me baby  
Yeah we're givin' up this scene  
You and me baby  
Yeah we're givin' up this scene
