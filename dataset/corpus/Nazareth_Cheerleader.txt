Legs up to her shoulders  
All the way back down  
She's not playin', she knows what she's doin'  
And the word's out on the town  
She want to be a cheerleader  
A cheerleader  
She got the moves  
  
She got the grooves  
All the boys need her  
  
Oh oh that's the way she wants to be  
Cruisin' the touch line at a quarter to three  
See her - she want to be a cheerleader  
  
Now she's gettin' bolder  
Now she gets around  
She's not takin no for an answer  
She's not getting down  
  
She's a no teaser  
A no pleaser  
She got the drive  
She got the jive  
She's a big squeezer  
  
Oh oh that's all she wants to be  
Shake a little tush for the boys to see  
Want to be her - a cheerleader  
But what she wants the most  
To be the perfect host  
She wants to play the field all over  
  
She needs it most of all  
When it's too close to call  
She wants to rock and roll all over  
Yes all over  
  
Legs up to her shoulders  
All the way back down  
She's not playin', she knows what she's doin'  
The word's out on the town  
  
She want to be a cheerleader  
A cheerleader  
She got the moves  
She got the grooves  
All the boys need her  
  
Oh oh that's all she wants to be  
Shake a little tush for the boys to see  
Want to be her - a cheerleader  
  
Oh oh that's all she wants to be  
Cruisin' the touch line at a quarter to three  
See her - she want to be a cheerleader  
  
See, her, want to be a cheerleader
