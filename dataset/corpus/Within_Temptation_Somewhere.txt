Lost in the darkness, hoping for a sign  
Instead there is only silence  
Can't you hear my screams?  
Never stop hoping  
Need to know where you are  
But one thing is for sure  
You're always in my heart  
  
I'll find you somewhere  
I'll keep on trying until my dying day  
I just need to know whatever has happened  
The truth will free my soul  
  
Lost in the darkness, try to find your way home  
I want to embrace you and never let you go  
Almost hope you're in heaven  
so no one can hurt your soul  
Living in agony cause I just do not know  
Where you are  
  
I'll find you somewhere  
I'll keep on trying until my dying day  
I just need to know whatever has happened  
The truth will free my soul  
  
Wherever you are, I won't stop searching  
Whatever it takes, I need to know  
  
I'll find you somewhere  
I'll keep on trying until my dying day  
I just need to know whatever has happened  
The truth will free my soul
