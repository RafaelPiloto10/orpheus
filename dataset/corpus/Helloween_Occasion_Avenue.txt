What sight have you seen  
Where you go already been  
Then again you go through  
Occasion Avenue  
  
Sister, the day you sell your skin  
(The gold of night is the gold of the blind)  
Sister, the day your soul gives in  
(You'll never find what you left behind)  
Oh, oh, no matter what they do  
Oh, oh, you got to go straight through  
Occasion Avenue  
  
Brother, dare not look left or right  
(Coaxing your eyes, poisoning your mind)  
Brother, don't stop or you must fight  
(No indulgence or its death you'll find)  
Oh, oh, you may not leave with doubt  
Oh, oh, you may not take it to  
Occasion Avenue  
  
Follow your heart - Forrow your truth  
Follow the path that shines for you  
On Occasion Avenue  
How far you go - How good you do  
Uncovers the prize or rebears you  
To Occasion Avenue  
  
Domini, domini - Occasion Avenue - Domini Sancti  
Satani, satani - Occasion Avenue - Satani mundi  
  
Will there be tomorrow - Will there be the stars  
Will there be a future - Time beats in our hearts  
Or will there be the fire - Branding us his mark  
  
Pray for all us people  
Trying to solve the riddle  
I don't know where we're going  
I don't know if we're being true  
On Occasion Avenue  
  
Precious is your taking  
For a little bit of faking  
For a tiny slight deception  
For some insincere affection  
(TV: ...committed suicide in his New York Penthouse. He leaves no dependant so
stay tuned for the latest news of "where do all the millions go").  
  
Much be your power  
By the essence of a flower  
By seducement and cold rapture  
By abusing mother nature  
(TV: ...murdered close to old Berlin's Checkpoint Charlie. Police assumes just
one more execution by competing drug cartels).  
  
Great will be your status  
When you know how to lick anus  
When you lie and swindle ruthless  
And your biggest hero's Judas  
(TV: ...sentenced to 16 years for marriage imposture and order of murder to
his current wife whose life assurance's worth one million pounds.)  
  
Will there be tomorrow, Will there be the stars  
Will there be a future, Time beats in our hearts  
Will there still be laughter, Will there be relief  
Will there be religion, Will there be belief  
  
Will you see your people, From your former lifes  
Will you know them this time, Will you win the prize  
Will there be an ending, Will there be a start  
Or will there be fire, Branding you his mark  
  
I pray for all us people, Trying to solve the riddle  
I don't know where we're going  
I don't know if we're being true, On Occasion Avenue  
  
Mother, I dreamt of my last life  
(You'll never find what you left behind)  
Mother, I killed you with my knife  
(No indulgence or its death you find)  
  
Oh, oh, we got to make it through, Occasion Avenue  
  
Follow your heart, Follow your truth  
Follow the path that shines for you  
On Occasion Avenue  
How far you go, How good you do  
Uncovers the prize or rebears for you  
To Occasion Avenue  
  
Domini, domini - Occasion Avenue - Domini Sancti  
Satani, satani - Occasion Avenue - Satani mundi
