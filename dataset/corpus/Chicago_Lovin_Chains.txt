Moved out west just to get away  
Miles of sky and empty space  
Mirrors my soul  
I'm out here on my own  
  
I got a new job and a couple new friends  
There's even someone special,  
I think I could start again  
But every time we touch  
It reminds me of us, and  
  
[Chorus]  
Every time I close my eyes  
To go to sleep at night  
I wake up and I see your face  
Even in my dreams  
I can't get anyplace  
I can't shake off your lovin' chains  
Your lovin' chains  
  
So I moved back east just to face my tears  
To say what needs sayin' before you disappear  
But old friends say you're gone  
Long since moved on, now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I think I'm never gonna climb this mountain  
Of my feelings for you  
I'm gonna have to live here in your shadow  
Until the skies are no longer blue!  
  
[Chorus]
