Where do we go from here?  
Where do we go from here, where do we go from here  
Where do we go from here, where do we go from here  
  
They boarded up the synagogues, Uzis on a street corner  
You can't take a photograph of Uzis on a street corner  
The DJ resigned today they wouldn't let him have his say  
Surface scratched where the needles play, Uzis on a street corner  
Where do we go from here  
Terror in Rue de St. Denis, murder on the periphery  
Someone else in someone else's pocket  
Christ knows I don't know how to stop it  
Poppies at the cenotaph, the cynics can't afford to laugh  
I heard in on the telegraph there's Uzis on a street corner  
  
Where do we go from here, where do we go from here  
  
The more I see, the more I hear, the more I find fewer answers  
I close my mind, I shout it out but you know it's getting harder  
To calm down, to reason out, to come to terms with what it's all about  
I'm uptight, can't sleep at night, I can't pretend everything's all right  
My ideals, my sanity, they seem to be deserting me  
But to stand up and fight I know we have six million reasons  
  
They're burning down the synagogues, Uzis on a street corner  
The heralds of the holocaust, Uzis on a street corner  
The silence never louder than now, how quickly we forgot our vows  
This resurrection we can't allow, Uzis on a street corner  
  
Where do we go from here, where do we go from here  
  
We buy fresh bagels from the corner store  
Where swastikas are spat from aerosols  
I sit in the bar sipping iced White Russian  
Trying to score but nobody's pushing  
And everyone looks at everyone's faces  
Searching for signs and praying for traces of a conscience in residence  
Are we sitting on a barbed wire fence  
Racing the clouds home, racing the clouds home  
  
We place our faith in human rights  
In the paper wars that tie the red tape tight  
I know that I would rather be out of this conspiracy  
In the gulags and internment camps frozen faces in nameless ranks  
I know that they would rather be standing here besides me  
Racing the clouds home, racing the clouds home  
  
You can shut your eyes, you can hide it away it's gonna come back another  
day  
Racing the clouds home, are we racing the clouds home  
Racing the clouds home
