I don't have plans and schemes  
And I don't have hopes and dreams  
I don't have anything  
Since I don't have you  
  
And I don't have fond desires  
And I don't have happy hours  
No I don't have anything  
Since I don't have you  
  
Oh I don't have happiness  
And I guess I never will ever again  
When you walked out on me  
In walked the misery and he's been here since then  
  
And I don't have love to share  
And I don't have one who cares  
I don't have anything  
Since I don't have  
You, you, you, you, you, you  
  
No I don't have love to share  
And I don't have one who cares  
I don't have anything  
Since I don't have you  
  
Since I don't have you
