We, were alone, on the road, driving faster  
So, far from home, we were chasing disaster  
Pour, on the gas, til the car, caught on fire  
We, had to laugh, as the smoke, billowed higher  
  
I wanna feel alive forever after  
And you say, you say you wanna feel alive forever after  
And I, and I, and I say  
Fo-o-ollow the li-i-ine through the dreams and disasters  
Fo-o-ollow the li-i-ine to the edge and the after  
We won't turn around  
We will not slow down  
Fo-o-ollow the li-i-ine through the dreams and disasters  
  
Think, of the sun, and the sound, of it rising  
Still, on the run, with our eyes on the horizon  
  
I wanna feel alive forever after  
And you say, you say you wanna feel alive forever after  
And I, and I, and I say  
Fo-o-ollow the li-i-ine to the dreams and disasters  
Fo-o-ollow the li-i-ine to the edge and the after  
We won't turn around  
We will not slow down  
Fo-o-ollow the li-i-ine to the dreams and disasters  
  
I just wanna feel alive  
  
I just wanna feel alive  
  
I just wanna feel alive  
  
I just wanna feel alive  
  
I just wanna feel alive  
  
Fo-o-ollow the li-i-ine through the dreams and disasters  
Fo-o-ollow the li-i-ine to the edge and the after  
We won't turn around  
We will not slow down  
Fo-o-ollow the li-i-ine through the dreams and disasters  
  
We won't turn around  
We will not slow down  
Fo-o-ollow the li-i-ine through the dreams and disasters
