He sees what I'm lacking and he tells me without attacking my life  
He sees what I'm needing and he gives me love without my pleading  
I see where his worries lie and I help him to decide  
He sees what I'm missing, that sometimes I need to be alone, but sometimes I
need him to listen  
  
Like a hemisphere he surrounds me with a wisdom that astounds me  
Like the horizon, he draws my eye to him and he makes me see just how lonely I
have been  
  
He knows what I'm thinking without a sign, without blinking my eyes  
I know what he's asking, in our love there ain't no masking, no disguise  
I know what he's after, it's the truth and the laughter  
Why can't we see in ourselves, all the beauty we see in everybody else?  
  
Like a hemisphere he surrounds me with a wisdon that astounds me  
Like the horizon, he draws my eye to him and he makes me see  
Like a radio he calls out to me in the middle of the night  
Like a hemisphere he is perfectly clear and he makes me see just how lonely I
have been  
  
I don't want to go through this life just getting by, I want to fly  
I don't want to go through this life not asking why  
I need to know why we are here, we are here together now  
I don't want to go through this life just to die  
Well, you made me see just how lonely I have been  
  
Like a hemisphere he surrounds me with a wisdom that astounds me  
Like the horizon, he draws my eye to him and makes me see  
Like a radio he calls out to me in the middle of the night  
Like a hemisphere he is perfectly clear and he makes me see just how lonely I
have been
