There is a house in New Orleans  
Call it the rising sun  
And it's been the ruin  
Of many a poor girl  
And me, oh lord, I'm one  
  
If I'd listened what my mama said  
Be at home today  
Bein' so young  
And foolish, my Lord  
Let a gambler lead me astray  
  
My mother was a tailor  
Sews new blue jeans  
My sweetheart's is a drunkard, Lord  
Drinks down in New Orleans  
  
Go tell my baby sister  
Never do what I have done  
Shun that house in New Orleans  
They call it the rising sun  
  
Goin' back to New Orleans  
Race is almost run  
Goin' back to spend my life  
Beneath, beneath, beneath, oh Lord  
Beneath, oh now  
Beneath the rising, rising sun  
Now, now  
  
You come on by
