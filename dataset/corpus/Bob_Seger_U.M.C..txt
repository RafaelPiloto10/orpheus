I wanna be a lawyer  
Doctor or professor  
A member of the umc  
I want an air conditioner  
Cottage on the river  
And all the money I can see  
I wanna drive a Lincoln  
Spend my evenings drinking  
The very best burgandy  
I want a yacht for sailing  
Private eye for tailing  
My wife if She's a bit too free  
I've been told ever since a boy  
That's what one aught to be  
A part of the umc  
I want a pool to swim in  
Fancy suits to dress in  
Some stock in gm and ge  
An office in the city  
Secretary pretty  
Who'll take dictation on my knee  
I want a paid vacation  
Don't want to have to ration  
A thing with anyone but me  
And if there's war or famine  
Promise I'll examine  
The details if they're on tv  
I'll pretend to be liberal but I'll still support the gop,  
As part of the umc  
I wanna be a lawyer  
Doctor or professor  
A member of the umc
