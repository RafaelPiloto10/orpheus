Kiss me like you'll never see my face again  
As soft and tender as you can  
Hold me like we'll never make sweet love again  
Please make me feel like a man  
CHORUS:  
So let's send a prayer  
For this love that we share  
'Cause it could change in the blink of an eye  
You just never know  
How tomorrow will go  
So let's make sure we kiss goodbye  
Look at me just like the day we fell in love  
And found the missing pieces to our souls  
You and me have always fit just like a glove  
Wherever you are feels like home  
REPEAT CHORUS
