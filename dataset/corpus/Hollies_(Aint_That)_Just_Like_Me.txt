Mary had a little lamb  
His fleece was white as snow  
And everywhere that Mary went the lamb was sure to go  
Now ain't that just like me  
Well you know crackin' up over you  
You know that I love you (yeah) love you (yeah)  
Won't you come along there too  
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall  
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall  
All the king's horses and all the king's men  
Couldn't put him back again  
Now ain't that just like me  
Well you know crackin' up over you  
You know that I love you (yeah) love you (yeah)  
Won't you come along there too  
Hey diddle-diddle the cat had a fiddle  
The cow jumped over the moon  
The little dog laughed to see such fun  
And the dish ran away with the spoon  
Now ain't that just like me  
Well you know crackin' up over you  
You know that I love you (yeah) love you (yeah)  
Won't you come along there too

Yeah shake it now won't you come along there too
