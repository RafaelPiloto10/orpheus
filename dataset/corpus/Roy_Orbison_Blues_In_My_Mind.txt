I ought to hate you for these blues in my mind  
What makes me love you, am I losing my mind?  
I wonder where I'm gonna wind up  
I just can't make my crazy mind up  
  
Too many kisses brought me too many tears  
Tears that I'll carry with me all through the years  
I'm just the broken hearted kind  
Worrying blues in my mind  
  
I'm going crazy with these blues in my mind  
How can you just keep on confusing my mind?  
You've got a jealous air about you  
Maybe I'm better off without you  
  
Still I can't make my heart believe that it's true  
Trouble with me is having trouble with you  
I'm just the broken hearted kind  
Worrying blues in my mind  
Worrying blues in my mind
