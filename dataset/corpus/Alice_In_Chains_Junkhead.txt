"Junk, fuck"  
A good night, the best in a long time  
A new friend turned me on to an old favorite  
Nothing better than a dealer who's high  
Be high, convince them to buy  
What's my drug of choice?  
Well, what have you got?  
I don't go broke  
And I do it a lot  
Seems so sick to the hypocrite norm  
Running their boring drills  
But we are an elite race of our own  
The stoners, junkies, and freaks  
Are you happy? I am, man.  
Content and fully aware  
Money, status, nothing to me  
'Cause your life is empty and bare  
What's my drug of choice?  
Well, what have you got?  
I don't go broke  
And I do it a lot  
I do it a lot, yeah  
You can't understand a user's mind  
But try, with your books and degrees  
If you let yourself go and opened your mind  
I'll bet you'd be doing like me  
And it ain't so bad  
What's my drug of choice?  
Well, what have you got?  
I don't go broke  
And I do it a lot  
Say, I do it a lot!  
I do it a lot!  
I do it a lot!  
Say, I do it a lot!
