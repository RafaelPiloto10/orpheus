Third-class ticket in his pocket  
Punching out the shadows underneath the sockets  
Tweed coat turned up against the fog  
Slow coaches rolling o'er the moor  
Between the very memory  
And approaches of war  
  
Stale bread curling on a luncheon counter  
Loose change lonely, not the right amount  
Forgotten man of an indifferent nation  
Waiting on a platform at a Lancashire station  
Somebody's calling you again  
The sky is falling  
Jimmie's standing in the rain  
  
Nobody wants to buy a counterfeited prairie lullaby in a colliery town  
The hip flask and fumbled skein of some stage door Josephine is all he'll get
now  
Eyes going in and out of focus  
Mild and bitter from tuberculosis  
  
Forgotten man  
Indifferent nation  
Waiting on a platform at a Lancashire station  
Somebody's calling you again  
The sky is falling  
Jimmie's standing in the rain  
  
Her soft breath was gentle on his neck  
If he could choose the time to die  
Then he would come and go like this  
Underneath a painted sky  
  
She woke up and called him "Charlie" by mistake  
And then in shame began to cry  
Tarnished silver band peels off a phrase  
And then warms their hands around the brazier  
  
Forgotten man  
Indifferent nation  
Waiting on a platform at a Lancashire station  
Somebody's calling you again  
It's finally dawning  
Jimmie's standing in the rain  
  
Brilliantine glistening  
Your soft plaintive whistling  
And your wan wandering smile  
Died down at The Hippodrome  
Now you're walking off to jeers, the lonely sound of jingling spurs,  
The "toodle-oos" and "Oh, my dears" down at "The Argyle"  
  
Vile vaudevillians applaud sobriety  
There's no place for a half-cut cowboy in polite society  
  
Forgotten man  
Indifferent nation  
Waiting on a platform at a Lancashire station  
Somebody's calling you again  
It's finally dawning  
Jimmie's standing in the rain  
Somebody's calling you again  
It's finally dawning  
Jimmie's standing in the rain
