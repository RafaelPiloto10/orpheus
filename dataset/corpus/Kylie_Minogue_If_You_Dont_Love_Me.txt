You can tell me anything  
You can tell me anything  
I'll believe you  
  
You know it too  
Share the truth with lies  
Set aside one flies  
Will you realise  
  
[Chorus]  
If you don't love me  
You don't love me  
I will know  
If you don't love me  
You don't love me  
  
You can ask me anything  
You can ask me anything  
I will do it  
  
You know it too  
Nothing that I'll do  
If you want me to  
And it's all so true  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll know
