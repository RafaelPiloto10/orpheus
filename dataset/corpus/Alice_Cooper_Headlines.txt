Do a show  
Save a child  
Raise a million bucks  
That'll last a while  
Fight at parties  
Buy a horse  
Lose a couple  
Win that big divorce  
  
I want to be in the headlines  
Anything to be in the headlines  
  
Saw my chance  
Made my break  
Took the biggest float  
In the Rose parade  
Got jailed  
No disgrace  
A hundred million people  
Saw my face  
  
Called a conference  
With the press  
Announced my marriage plans  
In a wedding dress  
Climb a building  
At six-below  
On New Year's Eve  
Without a stitch of clothes  
  
I want to be in the headlines  
Anything to be in the headlines  
As long as they spell my name right  
I hope that they catch my best side  
  
Popped out  
From a cake  
At the President's ball  
What a big mistake  
Fifty guns  
Aimed at me  
I was nearly killed  
But what publicity  
Nominated  
Something big  
Stole the hottest scene  
Says the Globe And Trib  
Porno movie  
Comes to light  
But I was starving then  
So that's alright  
  
I want to be in the headlines  
Anything to be in the headlines  
  
As long as the spell my name right  
Hope that they catch my best side  
Keep my sidewalk status star bright  
Feel free to walk on me tonight  
Just don't spit on me  
  
Headlines, headlines  
Headlines, headlines  
Headlines, headlines  
Headlines
