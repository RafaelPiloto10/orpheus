These drills locked in your nails  
Scratch across the sky  
Hunting on, figure out  
Tell the truth from lies  
  
Everywhere listening  
Every word you say  
Thinking from the way around  
Yeah, think I found a way  
Come on! Come on!  
Come on! Come on!  
Come on!  
  
Satellite, I'm watching you  
I'm one step ahead  
Satellite, I'm calling you  
I'm inside your head  
  
Yes we can, yes we did  
'Cause in the him just spread  
Better watch, what you take  
What was that you said?  
Everywhere and everything  
That every word you say  
Think about way around  
I think about a way  
  
Satellite, I'm watching you  
I'm one step ahead  
Satellite, I'm calling you  
I'm inside your head  
  
Satellite, I'm watching you  
I'm one step ahead  
Satellite, I'm calling you  
I'm inside your head  
  
Satellite  
Satellite  
I know you're up there somewhere  
Satellite  
I know you're up there somewhere  
Satellite  
I know you're up there somewhere  
Satellite  
I know you're up there somewhere  
Satellite  
I know you're up there somewhere
