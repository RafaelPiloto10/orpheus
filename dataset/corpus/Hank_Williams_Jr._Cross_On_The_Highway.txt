There's a cross on the highway where the tragic wreck occurred  
And I lost y two friends taken to a better world  
Oh there's stop signs and there's curves  
But the one we got to observe  
Always bow your head and pray anytime, night or day  
Whenever you see a cross on the side of the highway  
  
Now Derrick Thomas was a champion no one can deny that  
He led the Alabama Crimson Tide in all time total sacks  
But his heart was even bigger than all his natural skill  
He always helped kids in the city and you know what  
I think he always will  
Now my buddy Mike Tellis was a good man everyone loved him so  
He took care of his dear father 'til he too was called to go  
How my little girl cried when we all got the dreaded news  
She said but Daddy Derrick and Mike will always be with us  
Don't children always tell the truth  
  
I never paid no attention anytime I passed one by  
Oh but now I say a prayer because now I know why  
There's a cross on the highway where the tragic wreck occurred  
And I lost my two good friends taken to a better world  
Oh there's stop signs and curves but the one we must observe  
Always bow your head and pray anytime night or day  
Whenever you see a cross on the highway  
I saw it in the morning paper we hear it on the evening news  
A mother, a child, a family life sometimes can be mighty cruel  
So God help us through these troubled times  
And please bless us with peace of mind  
There's just a shell there in the grave for the soul has flown away  
  
There's a cross on the highway where the tragic wreck occurred  
And I lost my two good friends taken from this mean old world  
Oh there's warning signs and curves but the one we must observe  
Always bow your head and pray, anytime night or day  
Whenever you see a cross on the highway  
  
Always bow your head and pray, anytime night or day  
Whenever you see a cross on the highway
