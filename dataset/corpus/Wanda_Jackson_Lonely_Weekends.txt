Well I make it alright from Monday morning till Friday night oh those lonely
weekends  
Since you left me I'm as lonely as I can be oh those lonely weekends  
Said you'd be good to me I said our love ain't gonna never ever die  
I said you'd be true to me but baby you didn't even try I make it alright  
From Monday morning till Friday night oh those lonely weekends  
[ guitar ]  
I make it alright...  
Oh those lonely weekends oh those lonely weekends look out those lonely
weekends
