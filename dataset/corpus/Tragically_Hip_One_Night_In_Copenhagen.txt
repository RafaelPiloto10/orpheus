When the drugs hit you  
Tingly begins  
Conviction plus tone equals hope  
Under the threat of separation  
The nadir's fluorescent  
The shriek of a gull  
Suspended in air  
The sound of the sea  
Anywhere, anywhere  
When the drugs quit you  
As loyal as a fruit fly you'll mutter to yourself  
'You talentless fuck, good fucking luck  
Good fucking luck'  
A delicatessen  
The shriek of a horn  
Suspended in air  
The sound of the town  
Anywhere, anywhere  
It quits you in situ, here it begins  
Quits you at a pay phone in the snow  
One night in Copenhagen  
One night in Copenhagen  
You know the nadir's fluorescent  
The shriek of a gull  
Suspended in air  
The sound of the town  
Anywhere, anywhere  
Anywhere
