Visions of home, the streets that I roamed it's been a while  
Raised me like the father I aint never had, I'm still your child  
And though I've grown in ways that you never known  
I ventured into the world, I moved out all on my own  
I'm doing this all for you, I hate to leave you alone  
See shit you wouldn't believe, I write 'em down in these poems  
And put 'em out for the world, I know you listening too  
Heard you saying shit about me, I hope the shit isn't true  
Man look at this shit I came from, this narrow point of view  
How you hating on a nigga that wanted it more than you?  
I ran through them spots with you and f-cked the same bitches too  
And just because I rocked with you I scrapped with them niggas too  
Came back for them niggas too, aint no trappin' nigga it's true  
Yet they play me on repeat cause I rap for them niggas too  
They see I started with nothing but passion and then I blew  
To the Roc, damn the tops a spectacular fucking view  
  
Visions of home, Visions of home  
Visions of home, Visions of home (Yeah)  
Visions of home, this is my zone  
This is my joy, this is my pain, this is my song  
  
This is for my cousin Ricky, damn niggas it's been too long  
Hate that my nigga Smitty slangin' but to each his own  
Gotta feed yo'self, smoke a little weed just to ease yo'self  
Fuck the whole world I don't need your help  
You're the reason why momma had those rocks  
All my niggas never even had no pops  
'Memba that, you remember that?  
If you don't, double back  
Momma found a much better crib on a safe street  
But I'm still where the trouble at  
Where the trouble at?  
That's cause my flows there  
What it look like if I don't go there  
I'm dead wrong, it's been way too long (long)  
My folks there, what it look like if I don't go there?  
I'm dead wrong, it's been way too long  
  
Visions of home, visions of home  
Visions of home nigga, visions of home  
I'm coming home, coming home  
Yeah Cole World  
You know what it is...
