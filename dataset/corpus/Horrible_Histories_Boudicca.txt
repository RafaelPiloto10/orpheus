[Intro]  
Gonna cause a stink  
Won't be the first to blink  
I'm not who you think  
Don't mess with me, I'm Boudicca  
  
[Verse 1]  
My husband Presotagus died  
He was a Celtic king  
I was his queen, so due to me  
Was half of everything  
  
[Verse 2]  
Roman law gave half to me  
So half was what they got  
Till their nasty soldiers came  
And took the blessed lot  
  
[Verse 3]  
Hey mister  
I say you got the wrong end of the stick  
His answer turned this sister  
Into one angry chick!  
  
[Chorus]  
No man, Roman'll  
Push around this woman  
You won't get far, with Boudicca  
Foeman, yeoman,  
Smash the Roman foeman  
All say yah! Yah! Boudicca  
  
[Verse 4]  
I built a massive army  
Headed straight for the city  
Beat 'em all with ease  
And like me, it wasn't pretty  
  
[Verse 5]  
Chopped 'em and hacked but  
What made their red blood curl  
Bad enough being beaten  
But beaten by a girl?  
  
[Verse 6]  
Wacked 'em, smacked 'em  
Boy how we attacked 'em  
Near and far, ha ha ha!  
Flayed 'em, slayed 'em  
Up and down parade 'em  
Boudicca Toughest by far!  
  
[Hook]  
Colchester, London, St. Albans  
Everybody talk about dead Romans!  
  
[Verse 7]  
We marched on up the Roman road  
That's known as Watling Street  
They trapped us in the forest  
Then thrashed us to our defeat  
  
[Verse 8]  
By now you'd guessed I'm not the kind  
Of girl to sit and cry  
Be sold a slave to Romans?  
You know I'd rather die!  
  
[Verse 9]  
They tried to take me prisoner  
So I led the Roman boys on  
Instead of giving in to them  
I swallowed special poison!  
  
[Chorus]  
Martyr, smarter  
Capturer, non-starter  
This was our last hurrah!  
Slaughtered, dismembered  
Our tribe always remember  
Boudicca! Superstar!  
Boudicca! Superstar!
