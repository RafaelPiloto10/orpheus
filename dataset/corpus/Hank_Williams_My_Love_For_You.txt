I'll never forget that sad, sad day  
Darling, that you went away  
You told me that our love was true  
And then you left me lone and blue  
  
Yes, I received your note today  
Saying you'd come back and stay  
Don't come back now, it is too late  
My love for you has turned to hate  
  
Don't come back now on your knees  
Crying, "Take me back, please"  
'Cause you can't mend my broken heart  
Because it died while we were apart  
  
Yes, I received your note today  
Saying you'd come back and stay  
Don't come back now, it is too late  
My love for you has turned to hate
