Been here before (x6)  
  
Been here before, couldn't say I liked it  
Do I start writing all this down?  
Just let me plug you into my world  
Can't you help me be uncrazy?  
  
Name this for me, heat the cold air  
Take the chill off of my life  
And if I could I'd turn my eyes  
To look inside to see what's comin'  
  
It comes alive...  
It comes alive...  
It comes alive  
And I die a little more  
It comes alive...  
It comes alive...  
It comes alive  
Each moment here I die a little more  
  
Then the unnamed feeling  
It comes alive  
Then the unnamed feeling  
Takes me away  
  
Been here before (x6)  
  
I'm frantic in your soothing arms  
I can not sleep in this down filled world  
I've found safety in this loneliness  
But I can not stand it anymore  
  
Cross my heart, hope not to die  
Swallow evil, ride the sky  
Lose myself in a crowded room  
You fool, you fool, it'll be here soon  
  
It comes alive...  
It comes alive...  
It comes alive  
And I die a little more  
It comes alive...  
It comes alive...  
It comes alive  
Each moment here I die a little more  
  
Ooh, I die, I die, I die a little more  
  
Then the unnamed feeling  
It comes alive  
Then the unnamed feeling  
Treats me this way  
And I wait for this train  
Toes over the line  
And then the unnamed feeling  
Takes me away  
...Takes me  
  
Then the unnamed feeling  
It comes alive  
Then the unnamed feeling  
Takes me away  
...Takes me away!  
  
Then the unnamed feeling  
It comes alive  
Then the unnamed feeling  
Treats me this way  
And I wait for this train  
Toes over the line  
And then the unnamed feeling  
Takes me away  
...Takes me away!  
  
Then the unnamed feeling  
It comes alive  
Then the unnamed feeling  
Takes me away  
  
Get the fuck out of here  
I just want to get the fuck away from me  
I rage, I glaze, I hurt, I hate  
I hate it all, Why? Why? Why me?  
  
I cannot sleep with a head like this  
I want to cry, I want to scream  
I rage, I glaze, I hurt, I hate  
I want to hate it all away
