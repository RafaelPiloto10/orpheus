When I would play my song  
You used to sing along  
I always seem to forget  
How fragile are the very strong  
I'm sorry I can't steal you  
I'm sorry I can't stay  
So I'll put band-aids on your knees  
And watch you fly away  
I'm sending you away tonight  
I'll put you on a bird's strong wing  
I'm saving you the best way I know how  
I hope again one day to hear you sing  
You know we're not so far away  
Get on a boat, get on a train  
And if you ever think you're drowning  
I'll try to slow the rain  
In two years or so  
Drop me a line, write me a letter  
I hope to find you're doing better  
Better than today, better everyday  
I'm sending you away tonight  
I'll put you on a bird's strong wing  
I'm saving you the best way I know how  
I hope again one day to hear you sing  
I'm saving you the only way that I know how  
I hope again one day to hear you sing  
I hope again one day to see you  
Bring your smile back around again
