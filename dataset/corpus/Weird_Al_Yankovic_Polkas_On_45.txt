They tell us that we lost our tails  
Evolving up from little snails  
I say it's all just wind and sails  
Are we not men, we are Devo  
Are we not men, D E V O  
  
Smoke on the water  
And fire in the sky  
Smoke on the water  
  
(I'm a man) I'm a boy  
(I'm a man) Well, I'm your mother  
(I'm a man) I'm a one night stand  
(I'm a man) Am I by  
(I'm a man) I'm your slave  
(I'm a man) I'm a little girl when we make love together  
  
Hey, hey, hey  
Jude, don't make it bad  
Take a sad song and make it better  
Remember to let her into your heart  
Then you can start to make it  
Better, better, better, better, better, better, yeah  
  
L.A. woman, you're my woman  
Got my mojo risin', Mr. Mojo risin', hey  
  
In-a-gada-da-vida, honey  
Don't you know that I love you In-a-gada-da-vida, baby  
Don't you know that I'll always be true  
Hey Joe, where you goin' with that gun in your hand  
Hey Joe, where you goin' with that gun in your hand  
Gonna shoot my old lady  
Caught her messin' 'round with another man  
  
Yoddle-ay-ee, yoddle-ay-he-hoo.  
Yoddle-ay-ee, yoddle-ay-he-hoo.  
Yoddle-ay-ee, yoddle-ay-he-hoo.  
Yoddle-ay he-hoo.  
Yoddle-ay-ee, yoddle-ay-he-hoo.  
Yoddle-ay-ee, yoddle-ay-he-hoo.  
Yoddle-ay-ee, yoddle-ay-he-hoo.  
Yoddle-ay he-hoo.  
  
I'm an ordinary guy burnin' down the house  
  
I'm hot blooded, check it and see  
Got a fever of a hundred and three  
Come on, baby, do you do more than dance  
I'm hot blooded, hot blooded  
  
Every breath you take  
Every move you make  
Every bond you break, every step you take  
I'll be watchin' you  
  
Darling, you gotta let me know  
Should I stay or should I go  
If you say that you are mine  
I'll be here 'till the end of time  
But you gotta let me know, whoa, whoa, whoa  
Should I stay or should I go  
  
But it's all right now, in fact it's a gasp  
But it's all right, Jumpin' Jack Flash is a gasp, gasp, gasp  
  
People try to put us down (talkin' 'bout my generation)  
Just because we get around (talkin' 'bout my generation)  
Singley do look awful see-see-cold (talkin' 'bout my generation)  
Hope I die before I get old (talkin' 'bout my generation)  
This is my generation (talkin' 'bout my generation)  
This is my generation, baby (talkin' 'bout my generation)  
(talkin' 'bout my generation)  
My, my, my, my, my, my generation (my generation)  
Well, talkin' 'bout my g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-generation
