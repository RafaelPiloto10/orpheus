In the dismal darkness  
I have sat and gazed, amazed  
At the blazing factories  
Like a lonely man  
Who stands on the seashore  
And I am afraid  
As weary as I be  
I try, I seem  
I see to looks, okay  
Run, well run in your skin  
Look what the wind just blew in  
Many lovely ladies  
I have felt, touched  
And I was not afraid  
I took them out dancing  
Fool out romancing  
And I was not afraid  
Then somewhere from the North  
This gale I knew just flew in  
And I am afraid  
Run, run, well run in your skin  
Look what the wind just blew in  
Run, well run in your skin  
Look what the wind just blew in  
Run, you got to run in your skin  
Look what the wind just blew in  
Look what the wind just blew in  
You got to look what the wind just blew in  
You got to look what the wind just blew in  
You got to look, you got to look what the wind just blew in
