Come now my lovely, won't you  
Take a midnight stroll with me?  
Through the misty air the things  
I keep I shouldn't dare  
  
My garden's so inviting, and its  
Deadly blooms are hiding  
Be careful what you touch  
'Less the grave is what you lust  
  
Draw the blinds, you're getting tired  
Paralyzed, don't close your eyes  
Gripped with fear, your dreams become nightmares  
From the deadly nightshade  
  
Each night at midnight  
Dating back into the fog of time  
Another victim falls  
The things I've done, the voices call  
  
The Hourglass runs out on us  
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust  
The killers must be fed, the soil is red  
Now that you're dead  
  
Draw the blinds, you're getting tired  
Paralyzed, don't close your eyes  
Gripped with fear, your dreams become nightmares  
From the deadly nightshade  
  
Draw the blinds, you're getting tired  
Paralyzed, don't close your eyes  
Gripped with fear, your dreams become nightmares  
From the deadly nightshade  
  
Delirium, your burning throat  
Mania, your heart rate soars  
Hallucination, you're losing your mind  
Suffocation, cannot breathe, you're going blind  
  
Draw the blinds, you're getting tired  
Paralyzed, don't close your eyes  
Gripped with fear, your dreams become nightmares  
From the deadly nightshade  
  
Draw the blinds, you're getting tired  
Paralyzed, don't close your eyes  
Gripped with fear, your dreams become nightmares  
From the deadly nightshade  
  
Deadly nightshade  
Deadly nightshade  
Nightshade, nightshade
