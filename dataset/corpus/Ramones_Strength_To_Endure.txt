Walking through the cross fire heart  
Feeling heavy and hopeless. Wonderin' how I ever  
Will see through this darkness.  
Every drop of blood can be so beautiful,  
And I sure was bleedin' the drops by the bucketful.  
I have the strength to endure and all the love so pure.  
I have the strength to endure because...because...  
I'm not afraid to tell her just how things work.  
Ride a hurricane through the fast lane.  
Always looking over my shoulder.  
She said, "There's something about you,  
And neon lights always glow hot.  
Baby we can see this through, just give me  
All the strength you've got."  
I have the strength to endure and all the love so pure.  
I have the strength to endure because... because...  
I'm not afraid to tell her just how things work.  
Ride a hurricane through the fast lane.  
Always looking over my shoulder.  
She said, "There's something about you,  
And neon lights always glow hot.  
Baby we can see this through, just give me  
All the strength you've got."  
I have the strength to endure and all the love so pure.  
I have the strength to endure because...because...
