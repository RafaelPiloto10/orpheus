The green rolling hills of West Virginia  
Are the nearest thing to heaven that I know  
Though the times are sad and drear  
And I cannot linger here  
They'll keep me and never let me go  
  
My daddy said, don't ever be a miner  
For a miner's grave is all you'll ever own  
'Cause the hard times are everywhere  
I can't find a dime to spare  
These are the worst times I've ever known  
  
So I'll move away into some crowded city  
In some northern factory town you'll find me there  
Though I'll leave the past behind  
I'll never change my mind  
These troubled times are more than I could bear  
  
But someday I'll go back to West Virginia  
To the green rolling hills I love so well  
Yes, someday I'll go home  
And I know I'll right the wrong  
These troubled times will follow me no more  
  
Yes, someday I'll go home  
And I know I'll right the wrong  
These troubled times will follow me no more
