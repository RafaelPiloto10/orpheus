I'm a young one  
Stuck in the box  
Of an old ones head  
When all the others were just stirring awake  
I'm trying to trick myself to fall asleep again  
  
Whoa  
My head's in heaven  
My soles are in hell  
Let's meet in the purgatory of my hips and get well  
  
[Chorus]  
Hurry, hurry  
You put my head in such a flurry, flurry  
What makes you so special?  
What makes you so special?  
I'm gonna leave you  
I'm gonna teach you  
How we're all alone  
(How we're all alone, how we're all alone)  
  
Give me, build me  
It's your club, so let me in (let me in) oh  
Knowing how heartwarming  
It is inside your skin  
  
My head's in heaven  
My soles are in hell  
Let's meet in the purgatory of my hips and get well  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, oh  
(Oh, oh)  
(Oh, oh)  
(Oh, oh)  
(Oh, oh)  
(Oh, oh)  
(Oh, oh)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, oh  
Hmm, hmm,  
  
Baby, if you don't take your medication  
We won't sleep for days  
We won't sleep for days  
  
And Mama, when we pray to the Lord  
Doesn't sit or stay  
Doesn't sit or stay  
  
We waste it all in the back of a long dark car  
And I'm sunshine machine  
  
Uh, I want to get stuck, uh  
I want to get stuck  
And be  
In your memories.  
Hmm, oh
