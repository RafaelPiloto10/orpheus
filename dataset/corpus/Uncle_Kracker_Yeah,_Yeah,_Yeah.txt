I might walk a lil funny but my walk is me  
I might stutter when I talk but I say what I see  
I don't agree with every other li'l thing that's proven  
I do a lot of things that I shouldn't be doin'  
I'll ruin everything you mighta had in mind  
I'm a consistent, belligerent, solidified find  
Rhinestone freak, suburban star  
I ain't got no money and I got no car  
I might make par if it don't take much  
See I don't ride very far 'cause I ride on luck  
I stay pretty stuck in a rut like I should  
And I do it for the love of everything that's still good  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I don't know why I come here  
But I know I'll never leave  
It's the only place I want to be yea, yea, yea  
  
I'm a long way gone but I ain't short lived  
I got deep deep pockets that leak like a civ  
I give 110 throughout the course of a night  
And if I don't go home then I did things right  
I'd like to settle down but I ain't that guy  
'cause everything I ever did I always did on the fly  
I like to ride the wave 'til the tide don't swell  
I don't like cocaine but I like the smell  
I dwell in the place you might see unfit  
But there ain't nothin' you can ever say to make me give a shit  
I stay pretty stuck in a rut like I should  
And do it for the love of everything that's still good  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I'd like to say that I don't do them bars  
But my street called straight don't stretch too far (uh huh)  
I'm on the move goin' nowhere fast  
And you can tell the whole world they can kiss my ass  
I'll take a pass be the last in line  
And if it takes 10 years then I'ma be just fine (ah!)  
I saw the signs in the grass ain't green  
I found love at the bottom of a bottle of Beam  
See comin' clean just seemed so jaded  
And bein' underrated is underrated but I don't hate it  
I stay stuck in a rut like I should  
You know I do it for the love of everything that's still good  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I don't know why I come here,  
But I know I'll never leave,  
I don't know why I come here,  
But I know I'll never leave,  
I don't know why I come here,  
But I know I'll never leave,  
It's the only place I want to be yea, yea, yea,  
It's the only place I want to be yea, yea, yea!
