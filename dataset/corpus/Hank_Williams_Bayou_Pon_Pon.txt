(a) theres a place I know youll want to go,  
(d) if youre ever feeling low,  
For the (a) happiest place beneath the sun,  
Is saturday night on ba - (e7) you pon (a) pon.  
  
Oh the fiddles sing and the guitars ring,  
They have no thought of care or pain,  
Its time to dance their work is done,  
Its saturday night on ba - you pon pon.  
  
Oh sweet marie shell dance with me,  
And such a sight youll never see,  
Te - rese, annette and jole' - blon,  
Will all be there at ba - you pon pon.  
  
Its a jamboree at st. Landree,  
They have a good time, oh yes, oui!, oui!,  
They come from st. Charles, st. James, st. John,  
Its saturday night on ba - you pon pon.
