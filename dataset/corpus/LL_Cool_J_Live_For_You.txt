Anyway and every way I can  
'Cause I'm that kinda man, yes  
I will give you everything, baby  
Give you more than any girl can stand  
I'm gonna love you baby, baby, baby, baby  
  
I'll talk about making love  
In the shower least a hour  
And let you dangle in my arms  
'Cause love is power, can you feel it?  
The sky's the limit once you reveal it  
Your heart was wounded , God sent me to heal it  
I'm on a mission ain't no stress love  
Touch it with precision, just undress, love  
I know the right position, come on, trust me, girl  
Throw this rock up on your hand  
I'll give you the world  
Hey, yo, face, whoa  
(Oh, baby, baby)  
On the real was the honey looking laced

This ring means I'll always be true  
This is how we'll start love anew  
This time's gonna last forever  
  
I will love you all the way baby  
Girl, that means this love will never end  
I'll be your lover and your friend  
I'll take you anywhere baby  
Just say when and girl I'll take you there

We're going from Tahiti to France to Italy in one night  
Drop top Bentley Coupe parked in the spotlight  
And you can drive it laced in all white  
I'm wearing triple black, a Gear's top flight  
Trips to Venice the man a steel when a menace  
A match made in heaven when we blend this  
Lovers everlasting in other words endless  
To love any other man would be senseless in yor face  
On the real was the honey looking laced?  
  
This is for the lover in you  
This ring means I'll always be true  
This is how we'll start love anew  
This time's gonna last forever  
  
Ladies and gentlemen, Howard Hewitt  
I can say I never met a girl, no, no  
Who satisfied my mental and my physical thing  
When I lay me down to sleep  
I rest assured with the thought  
That you are right, right next to me  
  
This is for the lover in you  
This ring means I'll always be true  
This is how we'll start love anew  
This time's gonna last forever  
  
It's for the lover in you, baby  
With this ring I'll show you there ain't no maybe  
It's for the lover in you baby. oh, yeah, yeah  
Oh this time's it's gonna last forever, and ever, baby  
It's for the lover in you, baby, baby, baby  
Oh, oh  
It's for the lover in you, baby  
And this time's it's gonna last forever
