A ROSE FROM A BRIDE'S BOUQUET  
WRITERS CLARK VAN NESS, JIMMY DICKENS  
(It was only a rose from the bride's bouquet.) I went to a wedding one bright
summer day The bride was a beauty and the people were gay Alone in a corner I
stood till the end For the girl was my sweetheart and the boy my best friend.
When the service was over there beside the church door I picked up a rose that
fell on the floor Alone and neglected as I was that day Was my sweet little
rose from the bride's bouquet. It was only a rose from the bride's bouquet
Once filled with loves perfume now faded and grey Like the love that she gave
me it faded away This sweet little rose from the bride's bouquet. Each petal
reminds me of a moment of bliss A sweet little love word and a lingering kiss
I waited in teardrops then hide it away My sweet little rose from the bride's
bouquet...
