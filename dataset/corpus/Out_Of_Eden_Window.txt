God has given me a window  
And I can finally see the light  
And though, I felt like going under  
I know it's gonna be alright, yeah, yeah  
God has given me a window  
And I can finally see the light  
And though, I felt like going under  
I know it's gonna be alright  
You know that I've been there  
When I couldn't find an open door  
That's when He consoled me  
And showed me what I was looking for  
I just wanna take the time to say  
His love will never go away  
And when all is dark, no light to see  
He brings away, oh, my God has  
God has given me a window  
And I can finally see the light  
And though, I felt like going under  
I know it's gonna be alright
