Oh my love what have I done?  
Oh my love what have I done?  
  
I shot an arrow in your heart that  
I can't take back  
When I said, "You were my first love  
But you are not my last"  
  
For far too long I hid my face  
I fed off your forgiving grace  
Well I know your pride it must've  
Took a beating  
When I used your love to rob your freedom  
What have I done?  
  
Oh what have I done?  
What have I done?  
There's a hurt in me I don't understand  
What have I done?  
What have I done?  
I broke the sweetest heart of the only one  
That's ever loved me  
  
I don't know what I've become  
I need to get back to where I'm from  
I'm gonna smash every mirror in this empty house  
'Cause like you I don't wanna see myself  
  
Oh what have I done?  
What have I done?  
There's a hurt in me I don't understand  
What have I done?  
What have I done?  
I broke the sweetest heart of the only one  
That's ever loved me  
  
I hope you find someone new  
Someone who's worthy of you  
Oh when you look back and I know you will  
I hope you find a little good in me still  
'Cause I loved you enough to let you  
I'll always regret  
I hope you know  
What I have done  
  
Oh what have I done?  
What have I done?  
There's a hurt in me I don't understand  
What have I done?  
What have I done?  
I broke the sweetest heart of the only one  
That's ever loved me  
  
Oh my love what have I done?  
Oh my love what have I done?
