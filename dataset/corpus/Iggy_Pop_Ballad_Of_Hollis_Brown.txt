Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town  
Hollis Brown, he lived on the outside of town  
With his wife and five children  
And his cabin broken down  
  
You looked for work and money and you walked a rugged mile  
You looked for work and money and you walked a rugged mile  
Your children are so hungry  
That they don't know how to smile  
  
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're a tuggin' at your sleeve  
Your baby's eyes look crazy, they're a tuggin' at your sleeve  
You walk the floor and wonder why  
With every breath you breathe  
  
The rats have got your flour, bad blood it got your mare  
The rats have got your flour, bad blood it got your mare  
If there's anyone that knows  
Is there anyone that cares?  
  
You prayed to the Lord above oh, please send you a friend  
You prayed to the Lord above oh, please send you a friend  
Your empty pocket tell you  
That you ain't a got no friend  
  
Your babies are crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain  
Your babies are crying louder now, it's pounding on your brain  
Your wife's screams are stabbin' you  
Like the dirty drivin' rain  
  
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well  
Your grass is turning black, there's no water in your well  
Your spent your last lone dollar  
On seven shotgun shells  
  
Way out in the wilderness, a cold coyote calls  
Way out in the wilderness, a cold coyote calls  
Your eyes fix on the shotgun  
That's hangin' on the wall  
  
Your brain is a bleedin' and your legs can't seem to stand  
Your brain is a bleedin' and your legs can't seem to stand  
Your eyes fix on the shotgun  
That you're holdin' in your hand  
  
There's seven breezes a blowin' all around the cabin door  
There's seven breezes a blowin' all around the cabin door  
Seven shots ring out  
Like the ocean's pounding roar  
  
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm  
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm  
Somewhere in the distance  
There's seven new people born
