[chorus:]  
I got a house, but I need new furniture  
Why spend mine when I could spend yours?  
The truth is I will love you the same  
But why complain when you buying gucci, babe?  
  
You might see me in the spot  
Ya boy think I'm hot  
So I came up in here to get what you got  
I'm hot like the block  
Uh huh, you like that  
Know you wanna bite that  
Uh huh, yeah, right there  
They love the young girl  
They wanna give it to me  
Wish I was in a flick  
And I ain't talking movies  
If ya young, if ya hot, girl  
Shake what ya got, girl  
I keep 'em singing...  
  
[Bridge:]  
(Lemme get that, huh)  
(What you got up in them jeans? Put it on me, or get lonely)  
Lemme get that (huh)  
(You know, five-car garages, name on your bank account, all day massages)  
(Lemme hit that, huh)  
(I wanna put it on blast)  
(Lemme get that, huh)  
Better slow down 'for I make you crash, boy  
Got what you want, baby, got what you need  
But we can't proceed  
Unless you got that for me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm a put you on the spot  
Keep the sheet in knots  
I bought me a Benz  
You buy me the yacht  
A girl need a lot  
The girl need some stocks  
Bonds is what I got, bonds is what I got (Ya get it?)  
They love the young girl  
They wanna give it to me  
Wish I was in a flick  
And I ain't talking movies  
If ya young, if ya hot, girl  
Shake what ya got, girl  
I keep 'em singing...  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
Boy, I know you want my love  
Oh, oh, oh  
Nothing is free in this world  
Oh, oh, oh  
Unless my love is your love  
Oh, oh, oh  
I'm not a gold digger  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]
