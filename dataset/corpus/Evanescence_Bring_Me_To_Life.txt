How can you see into my eyes, like open doors  
Leading you down into my core  
Where I've become so numb, without a soul  
My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold  
Until you find it there and lead it back home  
  
Wake me up, wake me up inside I can't wake up,  
Wake me up inside, save me,  
Call my name and save me from the dark, wake me up  
Bid my blood to run, I can't wake up  
Before I come undone, save me  
Save me from the nothing I've become  
  
Now that I know what I'm without  
You can't just leave me  
Breathe into me and make me real, bring me to life  
  
Wake me up, wake me up inside I can't wake up,  
Wake me up inside, save me,  
Call my name and save me from the dark, wake me up  
Bid my blood to run, I can't wake up  
Before I come undone, save me  
Save me from the nothing I've become  
  
Bring me to life, I've been living a lie  
There's nothing inside, bring me to life  
  
Frozen inside without your touch  
Without your love, darling  
Only you are the life among the dead  
  
All this time, I can't believe I couldn't see  
Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me  
  
I've been sleeping a thousand years it seems  
I've got to open my eyes to everything  
  
Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul  
  
Don't let me die here  
There must be something wrong, bring me to life  
  
Wake me up, wake me up inside I can't wake up,  
Wake me up inside, save me,  
Call my name and save me from the dark, wake me up  
Bid my blood to run, I can't wake up  
Before I come undone, save me  
Save me from the nothing I've become  
  
Bring me to life, I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside  
Bring me to life
