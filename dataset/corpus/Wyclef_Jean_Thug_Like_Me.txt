This joint right here  
It goes out for the fellas  
Creepin' in the lady's home when they man ain't home  
Ladies help me say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you ain't treatin' your girlfriend right  
Trust me when I tell you this  
One day you won't be missed  
Someone will replace your kiss  
You want to be hardcore  
Like the rapper Jadakiss  
Or a thug like me will be up in your house  
Cookin' breakfast in the morning  
I know you heard these words before  
But you never heard em quite like this  
You gon' find yourself livin' all by yourself  
Who woulda ever thought wit a stranger she would share her wealth  
Now a stranger like me is lyin' under her sheets  
This is a warning red alert emergency  
If you can't find your girl that means she's here wit me  
She said you had an argument  
So I brought her roses  
You know what comes next when the door closes  
You don't like her smile  
So you treat her foul  
You only give her attention when I'm on the prowl  
And now your guilty conscience got you actin' wild  
And now you want to flip mode like you Busta Rhymes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This is a warning red alert emergency  
If you can't find your girl she's at work wit me  
Yo we eatin' brunch while you havin' lunch  
You don't even call to see what she wants  
You don't like her smile so you treat her foul  
You only give her attention when I'm on the prowl  
And now your guilty conscience got you actin' wild  
And now you want to flip like you Busta Rhymes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This is a warning  
It's a radar warning  
My dogs I'm talking to you right now  
You need to hold her and console her  
Never, never, never be afraid to tell her that you love her  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Get on the phone and call your girlfriend right now  
You shoulda listened to her  
Shoulda listened to her  
You shoulda listened to her  
Shoulda listened to her  
Oh, you should listen to her  
Sometimes you should listen to her  
Take her out for dinner  
Shoulda listened to her  
Take her to the movies  
Shoulda listened to her  
She lookin groovy  
Shoulda listened to her  
That kinda girl ready  
Shoulda listened to her  
Yo you should listen to her  
Shoulda listened to her  
Sometimes just listen to her  
Shoulda listened to her  
Listen to her  
Shoulda listened to her  
Sometimes just listen to her  
Shoulda listened to her
