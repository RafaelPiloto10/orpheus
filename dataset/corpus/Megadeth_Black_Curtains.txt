Hey... look around you  
Everything's helter-skelter  
Listen up... I warn you  
Run for cover, run  
Bang... it happened  
Time's up, Armageddon  
Fire... meltdown  
The sky is crumbling in  
Black curtains... never ending  
Escape... you're joking  
Can't find no place to run  
Hair... is burning  
My flesh is bubbling up  
Blood... is boiling  
Taste copper on my tongue  
Fate... is coming  
Welcome it with a smile  
Black curtains... never ending, fall  
Something's under my skin  
Something's very strange  
Playing with my mind  
Tempting me to do you in  
Am I dreaming? My heart pounds my chest  
Held for ransom in a spider's web  
Suffocating, no one hears my calls  
Never ending, till the black curtain falls  
Snakes... surround me  
Offering their death kiss to me  
Down... I'm drowning  
How long, I hold my breath  
Dogs... are chasing  
My legs are paralyzed  
Pray... don't find me  
My life is fading fast
