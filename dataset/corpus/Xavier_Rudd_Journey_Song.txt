The stone it sinks  
The day is near  
And I watch your feet I feel your breathe  
I'm in your dreams  
Seems such a long long time But I will return  
You are the only spark I use  
In these things I do  
This is the thing I do  
All these people  
And all these times  
And all this road I see for real  
In four twenty time  
There will be fourteen days  
When sadness climbs  
And there will be times when I feel chilled  
With you on my mind  
This is the thing I do  
You miss me now  
Well I miss you too  
You see well chances are given  
Only once  
Now there's clouds in my heart  
Clouds in my mind  
You see well chances are given  
Only once  
Not for free
