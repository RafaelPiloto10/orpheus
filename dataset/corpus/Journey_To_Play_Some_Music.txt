Say everybody  
And everyone  
We've been waitin', so very long  
To play some music  
And have some fun  
  
Bring some happiness to everyone  
Well come with us and try and learn  
What's on your mind  
Open your ears and eyes and let's see what you can find  
You're not so different, I don't mean to be unkind  
Something's unfolding if you really take the time  
  
So let the sun shine  
It's just begun  
You've given all you could to anyone  
Well don't you lose it  
Don't run away  
It's getting stronger, day after day  
  
You're sittin' there, you say you're  
Waiting for the show  
And what you have, and what you  
Hear is what you really want to know  
You've only come here 'cause here's  
Nowhere else to go  
We're only sorry, that we have  
To end the show.  
  
Play some music  
Play some music  
Play some music  
Play some music  
Play some music  
Play some music  
Play some music  
Yeah
