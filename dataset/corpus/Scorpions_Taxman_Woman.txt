I wake up in the morning I'm thinking of you  
In Dollars and Cents in high heel shoes  
  
I start to think and the headache goes boom  
I'm counting the bills that are stacked to the moon  
  
The money I'm giving to you  
I could live on forever (on the sunny side)  
What can I do so my life  
Turns around for the better (God knows that I tried)  
  
Taxman woman I keep running  
Can't you see it's only money  
Taxman woman I keep running  
Can't you see it's so hard honey  
To keep up with you  
  
I work twice as hard what else can I do  
To make up the part that's been taken by you  
  
If it wasn't for you I would be rich  
But instead I'm a poor son of a bitch  
  
The money I'm giving to you  
I could live on forever (on the sunny side)  
What can I do so my life  
Turns around for the better (Got knows that I tried)  
  
Taxman woman I keep running  
Can't you see it's only money  
Taxman woman I keep running  
Can't you see it's so hard honey  
Taxman woman I keep running  
Can't you see that it ain't funny  
Taxman woman I keep running  
Can't you see it's so hard honey  
To keep up with you
