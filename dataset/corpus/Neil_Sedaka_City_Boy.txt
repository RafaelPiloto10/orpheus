Country livin' really gets me down  
So I'm headin' for the lights of town  
Gonna kiss the country life goodbye  
I got myself a brand new high  
  
Funky music where the lights are bright  
Tell the ladies I'll be there tonight  
It's a paradise of push and shove  
I gotta get back to the streets I love  
  
Chorus  
I tried to fake it I couldn't make it  
Down in my soul I'm a city boy, city boy  
I tried to hide it, it's been decided  
Don't you just know I'm a city boy, boy  
Oh I gotta satisfy it  
Take me up town and let me boogie all night long  
Oh I hate the peace and quiet  
I gotta yell, I gotta shout, I gotta dance till I burn myself out  
  
I gotta be me, I gotta be free  
Welcome me home I'm a city boy, city boy  
And now I know it, well don't I show it  
Mama take a look at your city boy, city boy  
  
Music  
  
Bring it on home, bring it on home to me  
Bring it on home, bring it on home to me  
  
It's the only place I've ever been  
Where they never pull the sidewalks in  
Life's a party and you can't go wrong  
Cos Saturday night lasts a whole week long  
  
I tried to fake it I couldn't make it  
Down in my soul I'm a city boy, city boy  
I tried to hide it, it's been decided  
Don't you just know I'm a city boy, boy  
Oh I gotta satisfy it  
Take me up town and let me boogie all night long  
Oh I hate the peace and quiet  
I gotta yell, I gotta shout, I gotta dance till I burn myself out  
  
I gotta be me, I gotta be free  
Welcome me home I'm a city boy, city boy  
And now I know it, well don't I show it  
Mama take a look at your city boy, city boy
