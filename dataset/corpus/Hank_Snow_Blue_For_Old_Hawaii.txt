Tonight I'm blue for old Hawaii my weary sould is lonesome too  
She left me blue and broken hearted I've got them old Hawaii blues  
(Your big blue eyes and darkbrown curls dear made skies of grey turn into blue  
But now you've gone and lost forever I've got them old Hawaii blues)  
You left me down where drowsy waters roll on the shores of paradise  
You've had your way dear and we have parted for you old pal I dream tonight  
Perhaps some day your mind will wander back to the one who loves you true  
And I will still for you be waiting I've got them old Hawaii blues
