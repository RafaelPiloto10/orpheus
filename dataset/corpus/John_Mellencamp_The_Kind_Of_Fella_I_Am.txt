Well I don't like it when I see your eyes dartin'  
Back and forth across the room  
And I don't like it when I see you doin' dances  
Baby that I ain't used to  
  
But that's the kind of fella I am  
That's the kind of fella I am  
I'm a jealous kinda fella  
And I might fall in love with you  
I'm a jealous kinda fella  
And I just might fall in love with you  
Hey  
  
Well I don't like it when you try to impress me  
With your daddy's jewels and his car  
And I don't like it when I hear you talkin'  
'Bout your ex-boyfriend the movie star  
  
What I like is when you walk me home  
And you let me hold you tight  
But I don't like it when I hear that you learned  
All this from some other guy  
  
But that's the kind of fella I am  
That's the kind of fella I am  
I'm a jealous kinda fella  
And I might fall in love with you  
I'm a jealous kinda fella  
And I just might fall in love with you  
Hey  
  
So look out  
  
But that's the kind of fella I am  
That's the kind of fella I am  
I'm a jealous kinda fella  
And I might fall in love with you  
I'm a jealous kinda fella  
And I just might fall in love with you  
Hey
