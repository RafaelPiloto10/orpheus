He had what you might call a trivial occupation  
He cleaned the platforms of the local railway station  
With no romance in his life  
Sometimes he wished he had a wife  
He read the matrimonial advertising pages  
The cries for help from different people, different ages  
But they had nothing to say  
At least not until the day  
When something special he read  
This is what it said  
  
If you dream of the girl for you  
Then call us and get two for the price of one  
We're the answer if you feel blue  
So call us and get two for the price of one  
If you dream of the girl for you  
Then call us and get two for the price of one  
We're the answer if you feel blue  
So call us and get two for the price of one  
  
He called the number and a voice said: "Alice Whiting"  
The voice was husky and it sounded quite exciting  
He was amazed at his luck  
The purest streak of gold he'd struck  
He said: "I read your ad, it sounded rather thrilling  
I think a meeting could be mutually fulfilling  
Why don't we meet for a chat  
The three of us in my flat"  
I can't forget what I read  
This is what it said  
  
If you dream of the girl for you  
Then call us and get two for the price of one  
We're the answer if you feel blue  
So call us and get two for the price of one  
If you dream of the girl for you  
Then call us and get two for the price of one  
We're the answer if you feel blue  
So call us and get two for the price of one  
  
She said: "I'm sure we must be perfect for each other  
And if you doubt it, you'll be certain when you meet my mother"
