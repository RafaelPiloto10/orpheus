My friend's flesh and blood  
She lies overtime  
You'd nail her if you could  
But she says  
Love me for my mind  
In my time  
I'm not that kind  
  
My friend's flesh and blood  
Night size, perfect ten  
So rude, she's no good  
But as she says  
It pays to win  
Play to win  
She plays to win  
  
My friend's flesh and blood  
Street wise for her time  
You'd nail her if you could  
But she says  
Love me for my mind  
In my time
