Singing the blues.  
Well I never felt more like singing the blues  
'cause I never thought that id ever lose  
Your love dear, why'd you do me this way  
  
Well I never felt more like crying all night  
'cause everythings wrong and nothing ain't right  
Without you, you got me singing the blues  
  
The moon and stars no longer shine  
The dream is gone I thought was mine  
There's nothing left for me to do  
But cry-why-why-why over you  
  
Well I never felt more like running away  
But why should I go 'cause I couldn't stay without you  
You got me sing the blues
