I'm the invisible man  
I'm the invisible man  
Incredible how you can  
See right through me  
  
Freddie Mercury  
When you hear a sound  
That you just can't place  
Feel somethin' move  
That you just can't trace  
When something sits  
On the end of your bed  
Don't turn around  
When you hear me tread  
  
I'm the invisible man  
I'm the invisible man  
Incredible how you can  
See right through me  
I'm the invisible man  
I'm the invisible man  
It's criminal how I can  
See right through you  
  
John Deacon  
And I'm in your room  
And I'm in your bed  
And I'm in your life  
And I'm in your head  
Like C.I.A.  
Or the F.B.I.  
You'll never get close  
Never take me alive  
  
I'm the invisible man  
I'm the invisible man  
Incredible how you can  
See right through me  
I'm the invisible man  
I'm the invisible man  
It's criminal how I can  
See right through you  
Hah, hah, hah, hello  
Hah, hah, hah, o.k.  
Hah, hah, hah, hello-hello-hello-hello  
Never had a real good friend - not a boy or girl  
No-one knows what I've been through - let my flag unfurl  
So I make my mark from the edge of the world  
From the edge of the world  
From the edge of the world  
  
Brian May - Brian May  
  
Now I'm on your track  
And I'm in your mind  
And I'm on your back  
But don't look behind  
I'm your meanest thought  
I'm your darkest fear  
But I'll never get caught  
You can't shake me, shake me dear  
  
I'm the invisible man  
I'm the invisible man  
Incredible how you can  
See right through me  
Watch me now  
I'm the invisible man  
I'm the invisible man  
It's criminal how I can  
See right through you  
Look at me, look at me  
R-R-R-R-Roger Taylor  
Shake me, shake me, shake me dear  
Sh-shake  
Shake  
Fun
