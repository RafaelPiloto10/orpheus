I'm the only one down here  
Who's got nothing to say  
About the war  
Or the rice  
That keeps going astray on it's way to bombay.  
And the smog that keeps polluting up our shores  
Is boring me to tears.  
Why don't you call me, miss o'dell?  
I'm the only one down here  
Who's got nothing to fear  
From the waves  
Or the night  
That keeps rolling on right up to my front porch.  
The record player's broken on the floor,  
And ben, he can't restore it.  
Miss o'dell.  
I can tell you  
Nothing new  
Has happened since I last saw you.  
And I'm the only one down here  
Who's got nothing to say  
About the hip  
Or the dope  
Or the cat with most hope to fill the fillmore.  
And your pushing, shoving, ringing on my bell  
Is not for me tonight.  
So, won't you call me, miss o'dell?  
Won't you call me, miss o'dell?
