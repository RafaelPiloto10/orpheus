Hey, girl, it's all over town  
So how come I'm the last to find out  
That you're leaving, with some other guy  
Help me understand why oh why  
  
Tell, me, what he does for you  
Is there something that I didn't do  
All those late nights, I left you alone  
I was working on our happy home  
  
And then I come to find out  
That you're about to walk out  
  
Baby, why do you give me such a hard time  
I know he said he loves you more than I  
That's a lie  
Let me change your mind  
Oh  
Baby, stop before you make a big mistake  
Stop before you turn and walk away  
Give me time  
Let me change your mind  
Oh  
  
I, know, if you ever leave  
Baby someday, you'll look back and see  
That it's right here, that you should've been  
But you can run back to me  
  
And don't make me look for someone new  
When all I wanted is you  
  
Baby, why do you give me such a hard time  
I know he said he loves you more than I  
That's a lie  
Let me change your mind  
Oh  
Baby, stop before you make a big mistake  
Stop before you turn and walk away  
Give me time  
Let me change your mind  
Oh  
  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
  
Don't make me look for someone new  
When all I wanted is you  
  
Baby, why do you give me such a hard time  
I know he said he loves you more than I  
That's a lie  
Let me change your mind  
Oh  
Baby, stop before you make a big mistake  
Stop before you turn and walk away  
Give me time  
Let me change your mind  
Oh  
  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh...  
Oh...
