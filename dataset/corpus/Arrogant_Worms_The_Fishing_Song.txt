It's early in the morning, way before dawn  
I down a cup of coffee put my lucky hat on  
Get down to the water, before all the crowds  
Gonna have more fun than the law allows  
With my hot rod, I go out to prove  
When I'm on the prowl, I never lose  
I fire up my Merc and put the throttle down  
'Cause I've got the fastest fishing boat in town  
I open up my tackle box, it's so big!  
Crank baits, sink baits, beer and jigs  
Got my bobbers on, and my 10 pound test  
Gonna catch me a lunker gonna be the best  
(Gonna go fishing) Gonna have some fun  
(Gonna go fishing) 'Cause it's number one  
(Gonna go fishing) Gonna sit on my butt  
(Gonna catch a fish) And scrape out its guts  
Ahhh, fishing!  
I fish on the lake, by the sunken tree stump  
Between the sewage output, and the chemical dump  
Don't swim in the lake, says a sign on a tree  
It's a good thing that fish can't read  
I got my 10 dollar lure, the one that floats  
And I make a big cast from my 20 grand boat  
With my thousand dollar rod, or maybe it's more  
Gonna catch me a fish that's 5 bucks at the store  
(Gonna go fishing) Gonna have some fun  
(Gonna go fishing) 'Cause it's number one  
(Gonna go fishing) Gonna sit on my butt  
(Gonna catch a fish) And scrape out its guts  
Ahhh, fishing!  
I feel something tugging on the end of my line  
(Tug, tug, tug, tug, tug that line)  
I'm gonna catch a fish, it's gonna be so fine  
(Fish, fish, fish, fish, fish so fine)  
Oh it feels so good to touch fish slime  
(Slime, slime, slime, slime, fishy slime)  
There's nothing else to do with my free time  
(Time, time, time, time, waste of time)  
[Guitar solo]  
Let's catch a fishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfish  
Eat a fishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfish

Out comes the fishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfishfish

(Gonna go fishing) Gonna have some fun  
(Gonna go fishing) 'Cause it's number one  
(Gonna go fishing) Gonna sit on my butt  
(Gonna catch a fish) And scrape out its guts  
Ahhh--  
(Gonna go fishing) Gonna have some fun  
(Gonna go fishing) 'Cause it's number one  
(Gonna go fishing) Gonna sit on my butt  
(Gonna catch a fish) And scrape out its guts  
Ahhh, fish-fish-fishing see-A-N-A-D-A!
