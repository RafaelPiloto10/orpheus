Hold me in your arms  
Regine velasquez  
  
The morning sunlight, moves gently on our bed  
Sounds of distant traffic, float into my head  
Eyes slowly open and words won't be enough  
But what is left unspoken burns softly in your touch  
  
Chorus  
So hold me in your arms  
Hold me in your arms  
So my love, hold me in your arms  
Time moves without us, this room will be untouched  
We're safe beneath the truth now  
Both safe within this love  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
And oh the heart in me  
Feels more than you can see  
I can't get close enough  
Every single day, is ours to feel this way  
I can't get close enough, never close enough ...  
  
Repeat chorus
