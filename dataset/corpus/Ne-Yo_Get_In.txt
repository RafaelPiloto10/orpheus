Energy is always from you  
Uh uh  
Says clear to me what you won't not do mhm mhm  
  
Don't even know my name, baby you're not  
I don't know...  
Is the energy that makes you cool fr us to take  
And ambition away  
  
Chorus:  
Uh get in into each other  
Uh 'cause no one will feel get in  
Uh get into one another  
Uhh 'cause do what we really get in  
  
And the music loud and the lights are low  
Everybody is floating  
How you're looking at me is how I know  
The things are going  
Don't wanna know your name  
No one will tell you mine no no no  
Let the energy say everything you need to say  
  
2 x Chorus:  
Uh get in into each other  
Uh 'cause no one will feel get in  
Uh get into one another  
Uhh 'cause do what we really get in  
  
I'm here on this walk here and now  
We're so safe...
