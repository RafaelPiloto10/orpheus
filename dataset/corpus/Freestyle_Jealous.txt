Jealous  
nina  
  
Jealous of the girl who caught your eye  
one of my darker days  
when you look at her where was I  
should have been in her place  
here I am all alone imagining  
what might have been, could have been  
if had been there  
  
Jealous of the one  
Whose arms are around you  
if she's keeping you satisfied  
jealous of the one who finally found you  
made your sun and your stars collide  
la la la la la  
she's a very, very lucky girl  
  
Jealous of the girl  
who won your heart  
they say it's a perfect match  
She's gonna get to be where you are  
and it don'y get better than that  
she'll say you're fine  
whisper words I wish were mine  
and they might have been  
could have been  
if had been there  
  
And you know I'd fight the good fight  
if I thought I'd changed your mind  
but if she makes you happy  
then i'll leave the dream behind  
man, she better treat you right  
and give you everything  
cause the moment that she doesn't  
I'll be waiting in the wings
