lined you up For a HolIywood movie cast. With ail them big cigars and motor
cars You thought you was a movie star But Abigail Blast you sure are changing
fast. When you-a you-a you were knocking At the agent's door Because because

minks.and dreams In pinks and greens You threw away your old blue jeans But
Abigail Blast they're using you. Come on come on come on now Rocket I'm gonna

Rocket I'm gonna make you soon. I saw you sitting in the soda store Where all
the cast off stardust falls Where they write their names on the floor And hang
their photographs on the walls. Oh but to me you still got sweet sixteen
Written on your old blue jeans I'm getting rid of Abigail Blast. I'll call you
