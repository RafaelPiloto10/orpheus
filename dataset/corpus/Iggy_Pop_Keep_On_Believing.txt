I woke up in the quiet dark  
Fed the cat and hit the park  
Cutest chicest chocolate queen  
Look and smiled right at me  
Keep on believing, keep on believing  
Keep on believing, keep on believing  
  
She said "hi" without no sound  
Made my head go alright and 'round  
She was dressed to kill the pope  
And what she did she gave me hope  
I smiled back without no sound  
I said "hi" and left the ground  
Keep on believing, keep on believing, keep on believing  
  
Life won't leave me alone  
Trouble won't leave me alone  
Strength don't leave me alone  
Truth don't leave me alone  
  
She looked so bright in pixie hair  
She made me know how much I cared  
Her brown eyes gave me butterflies  
Sure towed my soul up to the sky  
Keep on believing, keep on believing  
Keep on believing, keep on believing
