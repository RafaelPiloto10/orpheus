We are going down, Jordan  
We are going down, Jordan  
We are going down, Jordan  
Let's walk the heavenly road  
I was livin' me life as an Anglican  
Let me tell you how I changed to a Baptist man  
I was livin' me life as an Anglican  
Let me tell you how I changed to a Baptist man  
One night I was walking down Fred'rick street  
Poor and hungry, no shoes on me feet  
I passed a door that said "Down with sin"  
It was the smell of food that pull me in  
We are going down, Jordan  
We are going down, Jordan  
We are going down, Jordan  
Let's walk the heavenly road  
Well, the leader walked up and he shook my hand  
Said "I want you to be a holy man"  
Right away I made a big decision  
Me stomach was a growling for this new religion  
I started over to get some food  
When some sisters approached me in a mystic mood  
They dunked me in the water 'bout four, five times  
I couldn't see a thing 'cause I was almost blind  
Singing I've got a sword in my hand  
I'm going to use it well  
I was drenched to me skin and I was feeling cold  
But the sight of the food made me take a hold  
The sisters started to break away  
They said "Kneel, believers, kneel and pray"  
I prayed and I prayed in a new-found style  
In the meantime me taste buds was running wild  
I was about to fall clear out of me seat  
When a man jumped up and said "Before you eat  
You got to mourn, children, mourn  
You got to mourn, children, mourn  
And if you want to go to Heaven when you die,  
You got to mourn, children, mourn  
Well, before I baptized I had plenty pain,  
Now I find myself a free man again  
Well, before I baptized I had plenty pain,  
Now I find myself a free man again  
Don't talk
