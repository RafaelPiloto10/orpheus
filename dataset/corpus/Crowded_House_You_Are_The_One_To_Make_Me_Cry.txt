Who'll face the tide and take their chances  
Will fasten the lights to broken branches?  
Adrift on the ocean in wild winter storms  
I have to imagine things to keep myself warm  
  
The night closing in, but not to worry  
Told everyone I know that I was sorry  
But I heard them all singing for comfort and peace  
And in my confusion here I still believe  
  
You are the one to make me cry  
You were the one to take me home  
Of all the people in my life  
My thoughts keep returning to you  
But consciousness is fading fast  
  
Surrounded by sights that go on living  
Make circles in time, the spider web spinning  
But I have no illusions of where I am now  
I'll let this wave take me and draw me down  
  
You are the one to make me cry  
You were the one to take me home  
Of all the stories in my life  
Only good things return to you  
If I could only say the words  
If you could hear me cry for help  
But I'd lift my head up to the sky  
But the planes that were circling now have gone
