Lazy day, Sunday afternoon,  
Like to get your feet up, watch T.V.  
Sunday roast is something good to eat,  
Must be beef today 'cause lamb was last week.  
  
So full up, bursting at the seams,  
Soon you'll start to nod off, happy dreams.  
Wake up, for tea and buttered scones  
Such a lot of work for you Sunday Moms.  
  
It's such a crying shame  
Week after week the same.  
  
Today's heaven-sent and you're feeling content,  
You worked all week long.  
Still, it's quite sad tomorrow's so bad  
And I don't feel so strong.  
  
Lazy day, Sunday afternoon,  
Like to get your feet up, watch T.V.  
Sunday roast is something good to eat,  
Now it's almost over till week.  
  
That's how your life goes by  
Until the day you die.
