You keep tellin' me don't hang around  
While you play around with the clowns that you found  
It ain't right  
Now and then I get tired of the sound of you putting me down  
While you're playing the town every night  
I'm getting hung up, yes I am, yes I am  
And you don't give a damn  
  
[Chorus]  
No you don't  
Have to treat me like a fool  
No you don't  
Have to be so bloody cool  
No you don't  
Have to make up all the rules  
No you don't  
No, no you don't  
No you don't  
  
You keep playing your reckless games that will bring you fame  
But I'll take the blame for your name  
  
Well you think you've got my life in your hands  
But you don't understand, that I've got my own plans  
My own plans  
I'm going down, yes I am, yes I am  
And you don't give a damn  
  
[Chorus]
