Dream when you're feeling blue  
Dream that's the thing to do  
Just watch the smoke rings rise in the air  
And I know you'll find your child memories there  
So dream when the day is through  
Oh, dream and they might come true  
And things never are as bad as they seem  
So dream, dream, dream  
Dream when you're feeling blue  
And ooh, dream, that's the thing to do  
And just watch the smoke rings rise in the air  
And I know and I know  
You'll find your share of memories there  
So dream when the day is through  
Oh, dream and they might come true  
Ooh, things never are as bad as they seem  
So come on and dream, dream, oh, dream  
Yeah, dream, dream, dream, oh, dream
