Every day I wake up,  
Feeling this way.  
I take it down town  
With all the action going down  
I strike a match,  
Strike a match.  
Work it up!  
  
I'm feeling so sick  
I feel so fucking sick  
On the bathroom floor  
Gotta get out and get right  
Hustling little girls  
Cheating little boys,yeah  
Gotta get out, gotta get out  
Get right  
Gotta get out  
I gotta get out  
No more  
No more  
No more  
  
I'm feelin' so sick  
On the bathroom floor  
I'm feelin' so sick  
No more  
  
Yeah  
  
I'm feelin' so sick  
Sick  
On the bathroom floor  
Sick  
No no more
