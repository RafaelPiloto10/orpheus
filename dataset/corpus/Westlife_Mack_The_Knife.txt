Scarlet billows start to spread  
Fancy gloves, oh, wears old MacHeath, babe

Someone's sneakin' 'round the corner  
Could that someone be Mack the Knife?

Oh, that cement is just, it's there for the weight, dear  
Five'll get ya ten old Macky's back in town  
Now d'ja hear 'bout Louie Miller? He disappeared, babe  
After drawin' out all his hard-earned cash  
And now MacHeath spends just like a sailor  
Could it be our boy's done somethin' rash?
