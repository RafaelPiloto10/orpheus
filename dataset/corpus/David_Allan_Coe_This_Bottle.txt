Dedication: They told me George Jones was full of whiskey and he couldn't sing
anymore. They said he was skinny and sickly looking and he was through. I told
'em he was one of my best friends and whiskey could never make Gorge Jones
quit singing. George was on the wagon when we done this song but he sings like
he wishes he had a drink.  
  
Last week he spent his whole pay check on whiskey  
  
I know friday night he'll do it all again  
  
Oh he'll drink till he falls down  
  
Then he'll order one more round  
  
And then go home with that bottle in his hand  
  
And the only thing I can hold on to  
  
Is this bottle in my hand  
  
I know I'll never have to share it  
  
With any other man  
  
I'm so glad you introduced us  
  
And I'll do the best I can  
  
To be faithful to this bottle in my hand  
  
She told george that changing diapers  
  
Could sure become A drag  
  
And to clean the house and cook for him  
  
Was not her kind of bag  
  
She said she needed someone  
  
Who would love and understand  
  
Then she left him with that bottle in his hand  
  
And the only thing I can hold on to  
  
Is this bottle in my hand  
  
I know I'll never have to share it  
  
With any other man  
  
I'm so glad you introduced us  
  
And I'll do the best I can
