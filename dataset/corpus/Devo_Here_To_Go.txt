If you smell the smoke  
You don't need to be told  
What you got to do  
Yet there's a certain breed  
So very in between  
They'd rather take a vote  
Running short on time  
Still they can't decide  
But we already know  
That we are here to go  
We are here to go  
We are here to go  
We are here to go  
We are here to go  
What is really mine  
Who's at the top of the pile  
Where does he draw the line  
Let them figure it out  
Go on and step across  
Just remind yourself  
That we are here to go  
When it grows too long  
The tail wags the dog  
The hand that bites gets fed  
Troubled multiply  
The crowd begins to cry  
For some common sense  
Let them all dig in  
When the odds are no win  
Head for the nearest door  
'cause we are here to go  
Go!
