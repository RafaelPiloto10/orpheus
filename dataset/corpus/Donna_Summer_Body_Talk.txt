I can tell  
By the way you stare at me  
(Talk):  
It's deep...real deep  
Your mind's messed up  
Words just don't come easily  
(Talk):  
It should be natural  
Your invitation...baby  
Turned my head around  
Quiet conversation  
Language without sound  
Body talk...work your body  
Everybody let your body talk  
Body talk...work your body  
Everybody needs some body talk  
The guy with me  
He's just a friend of mine  
(Talk)  
It's purely platonic  
So if you're tuff enuff  
Baby step across the line  
(Talk)  
Girlfriend don't bite  
My imagination...baby  
Bound to blow my mind  
Body talk...work your body  
Everybody let your body talk  
Body talk...work your body  
Everybody needs some body talk  
Body talk  
I can hear your body talk  
Speak to me baby  
Body talk  
I can hear your body talk  
Speak to me baby  
Body talk  
I can hear your body talk  
Body talk  
I can hear your body, body, body, body  
Talk  
I get the picture...baby  
Come on over here  
Your lips ain't moving  
But I hear you loud and clear  
(Chorus out)
