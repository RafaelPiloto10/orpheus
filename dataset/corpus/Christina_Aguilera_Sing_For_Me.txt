Sometimes when I'm sitting on my bed  
Feeling so so lonely  
Wishing someone hold me  
All I have is three little notes playing in my head  
  
Outside I can cover all the scars  
Inside lie the words just pleading to be heard  
'Cause all I have are three million melodies to kill all the hurt  
Now I'm ready gonna sing 'em all out  
Sing 'em out just for myself  
I don't even care what the world thinks about how I sound  
  
'Cause when I open my mouth  
My whole heart comes out  
Every tear I wanna cry is satisfied  
I'm singing till I'm winning, Imma sing all night  
'Cause when I open my mouth  
There's no place to hide  
Everything that I've been feeling runs wild and free  
I'm singing 'cause, I'm winning Imma sing for me  
  
I stand and believe in who I am  
Take shots at my heart but who am I to give up  
Everybody needs a melody to set their souls free  
My stage is the greatest in the world  
Give back to the ones who struggle with me stay true  
Reminding me to see my only chosen destiny  
And now I'm ready now I'm gonna sing it all out  
Sing it out just for myself  
I don't even care what the world thinks about how I sound  
'Cause when I open my mouth  
My whole heart comes out  
Every tear I wanna cry is satisfied  
I'm singing till I'm winning Imma sing all night  
'Cause when I open my mouth  
There's no place to hide  
Everything that I've been feeling runs wild and free  
I'm singing 'cause I'm winning Imma sing for me  
  
Sing for me (Sing for me)  
Sing for myself  
Sing what I believe  
Make my whole heart come out  
Right where I am let the rain come down  
Sing for me (Sing for me)  
Sing for myself, sing what I believe  
Let my whole heart come out  
Right here right now make my own, my very own sound  
  
'Cause when I open my mouth  
My whole heart comes out  
Every tear I wanna cry is satisfied  
I'm singing till I'm winning Imma sing all night  
'Cause when I open my mouth  
There's no place to hide  
Everything that I've been feeling runs wild and free  
I'm singing 'cause I'm winning Imma sing for me
