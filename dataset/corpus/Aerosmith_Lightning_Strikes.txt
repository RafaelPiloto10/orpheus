Boys, it looks, are ready to rumble  
The word on the street some heads are gonna tumble  
Blades gonna flash when streets gang clash  
In the avenue tonight  
  
When the lightning strikes  
Zip gun Johnny's finger is itchin'  
The lid's gonna blow up in hell's kitchen  
It's an eye for an eye  
And a tooth for a tooth  
It's so ruthless when they fight  
  
When the lightning strikes  
And it's free for all in the parking lot  
And who'll rule the street  
And the night explodes  
When the cops bring down the heat  
  
And the chains they crash like thunder  
While the weak ones all retreat  
Gotta draw first blood  
Or they'll read your funeral rights  
  
When the lightning strikes  
It's dog eat dog when you meet your rival  
And the combat zone it's your means of survival  
Gonna get last licks on a suicide blitz  
With a broken dagger knife  
When the lightning strikes  
  
And it's free for all in the parking lot  
And who'll rule the street  
And the night explodes  
When the cops bring down the heat  
  
And the chains they crash like thunder  
While the weak ones all retreat  
Gotta draw first blood  
Or they'll read your funeral rights  
  
Oh, oh...  
When the lightning strikes  
When the lightning strikes  
When the lightning strikes  
Lightning and thunder  
When the lightning strikes...
