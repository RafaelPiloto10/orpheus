Gonna sit right here and sing myself a tune  
That I wrote one afternoon after everyone had gone  
And I know that this won't mean a lot to you  
You've got better things to do but for me I'll just go on  
Old dog is lying in the middle of the road  
He don't do nothing 'cause he don't want to  
And I think I'm gonna like that hound  
'Cause the more he sits around, the less I want to do too  
Gonna sit right here and watch the world roll by  
Till we both just up and die watching clouds and eating flies  
Don't want to bother no one, don't want nothing here to change  
A dusty road is all we've ever dreamed of  
And I think I'm gonna love this life  
Maybe someday take a wife  
She can join us if she wants to  
Ain't nobody gonna tell what to do  
If a car comes we just move  
And we both move real smooth  
Like old dog is moving must be something in the air  
Some bitch is coming up the road now  
And I think I'm gonna like that hound  
'Cause the more he gets around, the more I want to do too
