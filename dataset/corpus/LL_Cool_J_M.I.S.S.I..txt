Welcome to a brand new day  
Welcome to a brand new day  
Welcome to a brand new day  
Welcome to a brand new day  
  
Word up, this shit gon' be ill  
(Uh-huh, uh-huh..) raw like sushi  
Love paper like Ricky love Lucy  
Pop collars, L got heat  
Fifteen years, I'm thorough on the street  
Flood the rap game with product  
That bullshit video, I don't know why you shot it  
The biggest L of them all, "Hollis to Hollywood"  
and I still play the wall, y'all's get the balls  
motherfucker, Duke fold like singles  
Bass from my joint make your clitoris tingle  
That's my word scrams, stupid ass in the club  
You buy a bitch a drink, now you falling in love  
I gave y'all the love game you thought I was soft  
Now you whining like a bitch over some broad you lost  
Playboy bunny got you feeling all crummy  
Y'all niggas want the honey all we want is the money  
  
[Chorus]  
M.I. crooked letter, crooked letter  
I, nigga want to hump-that I  
M.I. crooked letter, crooked letter  
I, nigga want to hump-that I  
  
I had a bad shooby-doobie for ya  
Down in Georgetown fucking with the Hoyas  
Looking for a dark-skin chocolate chick  
Bowlegged with a perm and the ass was thick  
Blacker the berry - well you know the rest  
She got the most rhythm, she ride the best  
Talking midnight black, nappy hair with peas in the back  
Scratch my pipe up every time I hit that (oow)  
She don't look Hawaiian, she not Puerto Rican  
No disrespect mami, but tonight L creeping  
with the darkest honey I could find  
Can't hit a light-skinned dime all the time  
Get your black ass over here, you out your mind?  
I'll turn Halle Berry down for you anytime  
Black queen, dark and lovely, sippin on my bubbly  
First you got to love yourself, then you can love me  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I still love you light skin, I'll pimp y'all too  
When I cruise through your hood girl, whatcha gon' do?  
I heard only pretty boys get to run wit you  
Topless in my six now, is that really true?  
Baby look at you, your whole yellow crew  
Cute baby face but look at what you bout to do?  
"Si'l vous plais ma cherie, merci beaucoup"  
When my joint up in her mouth, she like, "You speak French too?"  
  
[Chorus: x2]
