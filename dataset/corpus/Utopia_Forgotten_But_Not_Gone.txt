She's been good to me  
She's been as kind as a girl can be  
But I get the feeling  
She thinks that certain something is gone  
It's the little things  
Like the words to the songs she sings  
Are a little different  
And I can tell that I'm not the one  
  
It's just a matter of time  
Forgotten but not gone  
I'm the invisible guy  
Forgotten but not gone  
  
It was my mistake  
'cause I gave less than I could take  
And I never noticed  
She wanted something I didn't have  
And my roving eye  
Drove her off to another guy  
Now she doesn't see that  
To keep from crying I've got to laugh  
  
And it's so hard to believe  
When I call her she turns away  
Like she don't see me at all  
And it's so hard to believe  
All that water under the bridge  
Don't count for nothing at all  
  
It's the same old line  
Out of sight and you're out of mind  
But I never thought that  
I'd see the day when she didn't care  
But the joke's on me  
I came home yesterday to see  
Them in bed together  
And making love like I wasn't there  
  
It was a matter of time  
Forgotten but not gone  
I could have rolled up an died  
Forgotten but not gone  
I'm the invisible guy  
Forgotten but not gone
