I met myself a woman down in Memphis  
She sat down and talked to me  
When I asked her to reply  
She looked in my eye and I said,  
"Woman, I know what you need,  
You need a man,  
One who's long enough to last,  
And he likes to take it slow and easy,  
You need a man,  
One with lovin' on his mind and  
All he wants to do is, baby now, please."  
  
She said, "Whoa, you're just a little bit crazed,  
You don't know what you're talkin' about."  
I said, "Now, listen little girl,  
I'll give a two pound pearl,  
If you only let me help you find out that  
You need a man, one who's long enough to last,  
And likes to take it slow and easy,  
You need a man,  
One with lovin' on his mind  
And all he wants to do is please."  
  
Now, I was sittin' in a little speakeasy,  
When I came across that delta girl,  
She said, "I hope you understand."  
As she opened up the hand,  
Now she said, "Honey, you can keep the pearl,  
'Cause you are the man,  
One who's long enough to last,  
And likes to take it slow and easy,  
You are the man,  
  
One with lovin' on his mind and  
All he wants to do is please."  
  
Everyday seems a little brighter  
Every load feels a little lighter  
When I know I'm coming to you.  
  
When every road seems a little longer  
With every mile I grow a little stronger  
When I know I'm coming to you.  
  
You know I barely got enough money to buy the morning  
news  
I ain't seen a dollar since I last paid my union dues  
But with love you're never without  
and there ain't no reason to doubt  
Oh there ain't no reason...no reason to doubt.  
  
Always get a little lonely when I'm away from you  
I end up feeling sorry for the pain I put you through  
But with love you're never without, and there ain't no  
reason to doubt  
Oh there ain't no reason, no reason to doubt.  
  
Everyday seems a little brighter  
Every load feels a little lighter  
When I know I'm coming to you.  
  
When every road seems a little longer  
With every mile I grow a little stronger  
When I know I'm coming to you.  
When I know I'm coming to you.
