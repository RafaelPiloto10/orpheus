I'm puttin' on my makeup  
It's time to wake up  
The owners of the night are calling me  
I'm ready and I'm willing  
To pull out the happy feeling  
Something special's in the air for me  
  
The night is mine  
I'm gonna keep it just right  
An angel in my pocket, right?  
Feels so right  
This mirror's tellin' no lie  
Gonna let this magic shine  
  
[CHORUS]  
This is my night (tonight)  
I'm gonna do it just right  
I'm gonna let this magic shine  
This is my night (tonight)  
I'm gonna do it just right  
I'm gonna let this magic shine  
  
I feel like winning  
i don't know the reason  
Something telling me to let it ride  
Got me rockin' and reeling  
I don't know what the deal is  
Something special I just can't describe  
  
The night is mine  
I'm gonna keep it just right  
On my way to paradise  
Feels so fine  
Feels just like the first time  
Gonna gonna let this magic shine  
  
[CHORUS]  
This is my night, this is my night, this is my night  
The night is young, let it shine (come out)  
This is, this is my night, this, this is my night!  
This is my my my my my night, my my my...  
  
This feels so right  
This mirror's tellin' no lie  
I'm gonna let this magic shine  
Let it shine, let it shine  
  
This is my night (tonight)  
I'm gonna do it just right  
I'm gonna let this magic shine (let it shine)  
This is my night (my night)  
I'm gonna do it just right  
I'm gonna let this magic shine (let it shine)  
This is my night (tonight)  
I'm gonna do it just right  
I'm gonna let this magic shine (let it shine, oh)  
My night, let it shine This is my night (tonight)  
I'm gonna do it just right  
I'm gonna let this magic shine (let it shine on me, shine on me)
