You bite through the big wall, the big wall bites back  
You sit there and sulk, you sit there and bawl  
You look so pretty, when you're on your knees  
Disinfected, and eager to please  
  
Sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn  
God rest your soul  
When the loving's come but we're already gone  
Just like your dad, you'll never change  
  
Each time it comes, it eats me alive  
I try to behave, but it eats me alive  
So I declare a holiday  
Fall asleep, drift away  
  
Sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn  
God rest your soul  
When the loving's come but we're already gone  
Just like your dad, you'll never change  
  
Sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn  
God rest your soul  
When the loving's come but we're already gone  
Just like your dad, you'll never change
