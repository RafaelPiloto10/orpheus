I'm handcuffed to the only love I knew  
Yet I never committed any crime  
Like a prisoner alone in his cell  
I'm hundcuffed to the love I've thought was mine  
There's no way out and no one to ease my pain  
My memories are haunting me in vain  
You promised to be always at my side  
Forever until the end of time  
Now you're laughing at the tears I cannot hide  
I'm hundcuffed to the love I've thought was mine  
  
I'm handcuffed to the only love I knew  
Like a prisoner a serving a lifetime  
Oh Lord I need your helping hand I'm hundcuffed  
To the love I've thought was mine  
There's no way out and no one to ease my pain  
My memories are haunting me in vain  
I pray you will return to me  
And remain until to end of time  
Please open th pathway to your heart  
I'm hundcuffed to the love I've thought was mine
