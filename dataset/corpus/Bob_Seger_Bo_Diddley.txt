Bo Diddley, Bo Diddley have you heard  
Mama gonna buy you a mockingbird?  
If that mockingbird don't sing  
She gonna buy you a diamond ring  
If that diamond ring don't shine  
Baby gonna take it to a private eye  
If that private eye can't see  
He gonna have to come and talk to me  
  
Said, hey Bo Diddley  
Hey now, Bo Diddley  
Hey Bo Diddley  
  
I walked forty-seven miles of barbed wire  
Use a cobra snake for a necktie  
Got a brand new house on the roadside child  
Made out of rattlesnake hide  
Brand new chimney on top  
Made out of human skulls  
Come and take a little walk with me, Arlene  
Tell me, who do you love?  
Who do you love?  
Who do you love?  
Who do you love?  
  
Arlene took me by my hand  
Said, "Cool it, Robert, you know you're my man."  
Who do you love?  
Who do you love?  
Who do you love?  
  
Night was dark, the sky was blue  
Down the alley we was swingin' through  
  
Lord, I heard just what I seen  
Who do you love?  
Who do you love?  
Who do you love?
