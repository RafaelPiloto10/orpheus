Maybe they'll come back again maybe they're all gone  
One day you'll find me sending their message strong  
Under your feet the city falls down so far the ground is sky  
We're under zenith again,  
It's healthy if not for long  
Leave a little room for us to breathe  
Much more than seven days and you've slipped to deep  
Much stronger than sympathy, let your best friend pull back that leash  
Sitting by a frozen man, someone somewhere has to cry  
Were under zenith again let the cycle run we won't die  
Leave a little room for us to breathe  
I love how you let me fall  
Under but not to far  
I love how you let me fall  
Only now I see where we are  
Hold me
