(Ko ko mo, Ko ko mo, Ko ko mo) [Repeat: x4]  
  
Well talk to me baby, whisper in my ear  
Talk to me baby, whisper in my ear  
Come a little closer, don't have no fear  
  
(Don't you know, I love you so)  
(Don't you know, I love you so)  
When I holler hey-ey, Ko ko mo  
Heard what you told me, heard what you said  
Heard what you told me, heard what you said  
Don't you worry my pretty, don't lose my head  
  
There's dimples on her elbows, dimples on her knees  
There's dimples on her elbows, dimples on her knees  
She thrills and thrills me  
With just a little squeeze  
  
Ko-Ko, Ko ko mo  
Ko-Ko, Ko ko mo  
Ko-Ko, Ko ko mo  
Don't you know, Ko ko mo  
That I love you so  
  
Talk, talk, talk to me baby  
(Talk, talk)  
Whisper in my ear  
(Talk, talk, talk)  
Oh, talk to me baby  
(Talk, talk)  
Whisper in my ear  
(Talk, talk, talk)  
Come a little closer  
Don't you have no fear  
  
Don't you know, I love you so  
Don't you know, I love you so  
When I holler hey,(hey) Ko ko mo  
(Ko ko mo, ko ko mo, ko ko mo)  
Don't you know  
I love you Ko ko mo  
  
(Ko ko mo)
