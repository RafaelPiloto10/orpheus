There's a light that shines on all people  
Sees them through  
It waits and watches them move  
Through their lives like people do  
There's only so much we can be sure of  
We can see  
The rest belongs to time  
And things that are meant to be  
When the clouds surround you  
And you know you've found your rainy day  
Oh, the blues are bound to make you feel  
Just like they're here to stay  
All through your life  
Anything that's meant to be will be  
When tomorrow comes  
Once again, you'll see  
That there's a light that shines on all people  
Sees them through  
It waits and watches them move  
Through their lives like people do  
When the clouds surround you  
And you know you've found your rainy day  
Oh, the blues are bound to make you feel  
Jut like they're here to stay  
Oh, you should know  
There ain't much a broken heart can see  
When tomorrow hides  
The dream beyond this dream  
Oh, there's a light that shines on all people  
Sees them through  
It waits and watches them move  
Through their lives like people do
