The wind is blowing down the quiet river  
A shining road that carries you alone  
Baby boy, my love will last forever  
If you're to live, I must give you up to God  
  
I know our God will guide, protect, and keep you  
Teach you faith and hold you by the heart  
Though your mother's heart is broken by your leaving  
Her Father knows just who he is and who you are  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wish that life wasn't always ending up this way  
With Heaven's love at stake and hell to pay  
But you in God's loving plan might be the missing part  
You must live  
So I give you to his heart  
  
The wind is blowing down the silent river  
A shining road that leaves me all alone  
A life for you's worth losing you forever  
Some day we'll stand in God's fair land, forever home  
  
[Chorus x 2]
