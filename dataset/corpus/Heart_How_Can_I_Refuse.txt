Wake me up with laughter.  
Wrap me in your arms.  
This ain't  
No morning after.  
Never been so warm.  
It didn't take so long  
For us to feel this way.  
  
Can a good thing last longer than day? Where do we take it  
Now, now that we caught fire? Will something greater grow  
Out of this desire? Should I drop my guard at the risk of being  
Used but the way you do those things to me, how can I  
Refuse?  
  
I could get addicted to your energy the way you take me over,  
Pulling on me. Our hearts beat together, out timing is the same.  
  
Can I trust my feelings, save myself the pain? Where do we  
Take it now, now that we caught fire? Will something greater  
Grow out of this desire? Should I drop my guard at the risk of  
Being but the way you do those things to me, how can I  
Refuse?  
  
We could share the mystery, spare ourselves the misery.  
Discover it again everyday. We could take love all the  
Way.  
  
Where do we take it now, now that we caught fire? Will  
Something greater grow out of this desire? Should I drop my  
Guard at the risk of being used? But the way you do those  
Things to me, how can I refuse?
