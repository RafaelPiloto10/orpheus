[Verse 1]  
It doesn't hurt me  
Do you want to feel how it feels?  
Do you want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me?  
Do you want to hear about the deal that I'm making?  
You, it's you and me  
  
[Chorus]  
And if I only could  
I'd make a deal with God  
And I'd get him to swap our places  
Be running up that road  
Be running up that hill  
Be running up that building  
Say, if I only could, oh...  
  
[Verse 2]  
You don't want to hurt me  
But see how deep the bullet lies  
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder  
Ooh, there is thunder in our hearts  
Is there so much hate for the ones we love?  
Tell me, we both matter, don't we?  
You, it's you and me  
It's you and me, won't be unhappy  
  
[Chorus]  
And if I only could  
I'd make a deal with God  
And I'd get him to swap our places  
Be running up that road  
Be running up that hill  
Be running up that building  
Say, if I only could, oh...  
  
[Post-Chorus 1]  
You, it's you and me  
It's you and me, you won't be unhappy  
  
[Bridge]  
Oh come on, baby  
Oh come on, darling  
Let me steal this moment from you now  
Oh come on, angel  
Come on, come on, darling  
Let's exchange the experience, oh  
  
[Chorus 2]  
And if I only could  
I'd make a deal with God  
And I'd get him to swap our places  
I'd be running up that road  
Be running up that hill  
With no problems  
  
[Chorus 3]  
Say, if I only could  
I'd make a deal with God  
And I'd get him to swap our places  
I'd be running up that road  
Be running up that hill  
With no problems  
  
Say, if I only could  
I'd make a deal with God  
And I'd get him to swap our places  
I'd be running up that road  
Be running up that hill  
With no problems  
  
[Post-Chorus 2]  
Say, if I only could  
I'd be running up that hill  
With no problems  
  
[Outro]  
If I only could, be running up that hill  
If I only could, be running up that hill
