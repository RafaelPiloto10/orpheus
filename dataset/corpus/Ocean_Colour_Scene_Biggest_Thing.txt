Up through all the streets you go  
But little girl don't find her name  
And we're all gone down roads to homes  
Where everybody finds their game  
  
Just behind the street she goes  
Where she'll be found behind her wheel  
'Cause it's the only place she knows  
That makes her know just how she feels  
  
'Cause you're the biggest thing  
That I see  
You've got me where you want me  
You hunt me down, you haunt me  
And beg me to believe  
  
All too fast to where she goes  
But who'll be first to find her name  
And holding on in Hollywood  
But holding on don't make the grade  
  
Just about when it's all right  
There's you and I : we'll find our way  
But it's holidays not Hollywood  
And holidays don't suit my game.  
  
'Cause you're the biggest thing  
That I see  
You've got me where you want me  
You hunt me down and haunt me  
And beg me to believe  
  
Hollow days and hollow nights  
But everyone they find their way  
It hightlights you when things ain't right  
And makes you want to find your place  
  
'Cause you're the biggest thing  
That I see  
You've got me where you want me  
You hunt me down, you haunt me  
And beg me to believe  
  
'Cause you're the biggest thing  
That I see  
You've got me where you want me  
You hunt me down,you haunt me  
And beg me to believe
