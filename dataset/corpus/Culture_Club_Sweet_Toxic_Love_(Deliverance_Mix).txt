Oh Lord, gimme strength  
Sweet Lord, gimme love  
Oh Lord, gimme strength  
Sweet Lord, gimme love  
  
I'm not your lover, I wanna be your friend  
But I need something, do you comprehend?  
It took a long time for this heart to mend  
There's something wrong with the love you send  
  
Oh give me strength, oh Lord above  
I need some of that sweet toxic love  
Sweet toxic love pouring through my veins  
To lift me up to make me insane  
  
I'm not your punch bag I'm not your floor  
You can't walk on me until you get bored  
Before you break it, you must be sure  
That you can't use this love no more  
  
Oh give me strength, oh Lord above  
I need some of that sweet toxic love  
Sweet toxic love pouring through my veins  
To lift me up, to make me insane  
  
God would have loved you but he never had the chance  
Love it means nothing till it's slipping through your hands  
And all the people with their problems and their plans  
Though it's nothing new for me and you, I still know who I am  
  
Oh give me strength, oh Lord above  
I need some of that sweet toxic love  
Sweet toxic love pouring through my veins  
To lift me up, to make me insane  
  
Oh Lord, gimme stregth  
Sweet Lord, gimme love  
Oh Lord, gimme strength  
Sweet Lord, gimme love
