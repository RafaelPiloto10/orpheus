What's this fierce new change?  
Has your juggernaut reached my door?  
Am I out of range?  
Think another thought before  
Babies are ground up  
In the last big round-up  
Ease your head play it cool in a patio chair  
Try to design a postcard from your mind  
Piggy bank ooooo-whee  
If it's Heaven-sent then you'll go far  
Listen well to me  
Smoke that 7 cent cigar  
Can that rumble  
And Avogadro's Number  
[Chorus]  
Polaroid galore  
Snap my jelly roll  
Count your change  
For your midnight chore  
Play that "sell-your-soul" exchange  
Menthol filter tips  
Danglin' from your nether lip  
[Chorus]  
If John Doe writes another book  
With words that just won't quit  
Why must I forge through it?  
Let George do it
