You, you remember me  
Like I remember you.  
To spend your life...  
Go back in you life, to the time...  
  
I, I walk the streets Alone.  
I can feel you on my own.  
Everyone can see that...  
I really felt, I Don't Know where you're at.  
But You're With Somebody Else.  
  
Chorus  
Somebody wants you  
Somebody needs you  
Somebody dreams about you every single Night.  
Somebody Can't Breathe  
Without You it's Lonely  
Somebody hopes that someday you will see...  
  
That somebody's me  
That somebody's me.  
  
How, How can we go on.  
It was so good, but now it's gone.  
I pray at night, that I'd pass someone nice  
And, I've Been so Lost.  
You were always right here when I was.  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge --  
You'll Always be in my Life,  
And if I'm not your Life  
You're in my Memory.  
You, You Remember Me  
And Before You Set Me Free.  
Listen Please.  
  
Chorus
