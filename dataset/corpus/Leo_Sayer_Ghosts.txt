Ghosts  
People that I left behind  
Wandering lonely in the night  
All in my memories  
  
Dreams  
Long forgotten flights of time  
Flashbacks flooding through my mind  
Of all the things you said to me  
  
In the shadows where I walk  
In the silence the wind talks of you  
Just like a ghost haunting the night  
So you wander through my life  
  
Ghosts  
People that I don't believe  
Just what they've got to do with me  
Oh, I can't see it, no, no  
  
Ghosts  
Long forgotten in time  
Look at these flashbacks flooding through my mind  
Of all the things you've said to me  
In the shadows where I walk  
In the silence the wind talks of you  
Just like a ghost haunting the night  
You know you wander through my life
