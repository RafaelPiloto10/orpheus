No one to talk with, all by myself  
No one to walk with, but I'm happy on the shelf  
Ain't misbehavin', I'm savin' my love for you  
  
I know for certain the one I love  
I'm through with flirtin', it's just you I'm thinkin' of  
Ain't misbehavin', I'm savin' my love for you  
  
Like Jack Horner in the corner  
I don't go nowhere, what do I care  
Your kisses are worth waitin' for, believe me  
  
I don't stay out late, don't care to go  
I'm home about 8, just me and my radio  
Ain't misbehavin', I'm savin' my love for you
