They've been married  
For seventeen years  
But you can see  
She doesn't trust him at all  
And you can see she doesn't believe that he is not cheating  
You can't blame a poor girl  
He's been a busy man all his life, just like the rest of us  
One day she caught him with another girl  
He said it was his mother  
She caught with another one  
He said it was his sister  
He's in deep water again  
I don't know what he gonna say today but  
I won't be surprise if he gets out of this one like the other ones  
Cause I know he's the Houdini  
Of cheaters, hear him now when he says  
  
[Chorus]  
Cool down baby everything is under control  
It doesn't matter where I get my appetite  
I will always eat at home [Repeat: x2]  
Oh, oh  
  
They've been married for seventeen years  
But you can see  
He doesn't trust her at all  
And you can see he doesn't believe  
She's not cheating  
You can't blame a poor man  
She's been a busy girl  
All her life just like the rest of us  
One day he caught her with another man  
She said it was her father  
He caught her with another one  
She said it was her brother  
I believe that it is true  
Birds of a feather fly together  
She has learned from master  
I wasn't surprise at all  
When I heard her say hey  
  
[Chorus]
