It's hard to be away from the one you love  
And the day seemed slowly drifting by  
But my darling  
I'd be home in your arms were I belong  
So I'm sending you this poem from my heart  
  
Dream of me when you're lonely  
Dream of me when you're sad  
'Cause darling I want you only  
You're the nicest, nicest love I've ever had  
  
Although we are many, many miles apart  
You are always in my aching heart  
But my darling  
I'd be home in your arm were I belong  
So I'm sending you this poem from my heart  
  
Dream of me when you're lonely  
Dream of me when you're sad  
'Cause darling I want you only  
You're the nicest, nicest love I've ever had  
  
Dream of me when you're lonely  
Dream of me when you're sad  
'Cause darling I want you only  
You're the nicest, nicest love I've ever had  
So dream of me when you're lonely  
Dream of me when you're sad  
'Cause darling I want you only  
You're the nicest, nicest love I've ever had  
You're the nicest, nicest love I've ever had  
So dream of me
