She's my baby, She belongs to me  
But yesterday she walked home all alone  
Everybody else, looks at my baby  
Then they wandered over to me  
But baby's feelin' bad today  
She said she's thinking of goin' away  
Oh baby I'm cryin', And my body's flyin'  
But I remember you  
She's my baby, Ain't that something  
But I know she belongs to you  
Yesterday was another day, when I,  
Saw your baby, walkin' home alone,  
I'm feelin' sorry  
I called you but I  
I guess that I forgot your name  
Baby's feelin' bad today  
She said she's thinkin' of goin' away  
But she's just like lightning  
She goes right through you  
Then you know you'll never  
Be the same  
Now everybody looks  
All around the corner  
Just to see your baby  
Walkin' home  
  
She's my baby  
Ain't that something  
But I know that she belongs to you  
She belongs to you
