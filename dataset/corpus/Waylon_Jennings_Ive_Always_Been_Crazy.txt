I've always been crazy and the trouble that it's put me through  
And busted for things that I did, and I didn't do  
I can't say I'm proud of all of the things that I've done  
But I can say I've never intentionally hurt anyone  
  
I've always been different with one foot over the line  
Winding up somewhere one step ahead or behind  
It ain't been so easy but I guess I shouldn't complain  
I've always been crazy but it's kept me from going insane  
  
Beautiful lady are you sure that you understand  
The chances your taking loving a free living man  
Are you really sure you really want what you see  
Be careful of something that's just what you want it to be  
  
I've always been crazy but it's kept me from going insane  
Nobody knows if it's something to bless or to blame  
So, far I ain't found a rhyme or a reason to change  
I've always been crazy but it's kept me from going insane
