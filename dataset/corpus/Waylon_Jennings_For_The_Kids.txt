You work like a slave for the kids and I'd go to my grave for the kids  
But we watched our love fade as we suffered that state  
With this bargain we made for the kids  
Divorce is a curse for the kids but this intention's much worse for the kids  
Yes they're now old enough and they made the strongest stuff  
Still it's gonna be rough for the kids  
These teardrops that fall for the kids you know they're really not all for the
kids  
But I know you don't care and the only love there  
Is the love that'd be shared for the kids  
Find a new love you should for the kids and I hope that he's good for the kids  
And though I'm now out of singht if he don't treat them right  
I'll be right back and I'll fight for the kids  
But I see you don't care the home that we shared  
All our hopes and our prayers for the kids
