Verse 1  
  
Take away the melodies  
Take away the songs I sing  
Take away all the lights  
And all the songs You let me write  
Does the man I am today  
Say the words You need to say  
  
Chorus  
  
Let them see You  
In me  
Let them hear You  
When I speak  
Let them feel You  
When I sing  
Let them see You  
Let them see You  
In me  
  
Verse 2  
  
Who am I without Your grace  
Another smile, another face  
Another breath, a grain of sand  
Passing quickly through Your hand  
I'd give my life, an offering  
Take it all, take everything  
  
Chorus  
  
Let them see You  
In me  
Let them hear You  
When I speak  
Let them feel You  
When I sing  
Let them see You  
Let them see You  
In me  
  
Bridge  
  
With every breath I breathe  
I sing a simple melody  
And I pray they'll hear more than a song  
In me, in me  
  
Chorus  
  
Let them see You  
In me  
Let them hear You  
When I speak  
Let them feel You  
When I sing  
Let them see You  
  
Ending  
  
Oh, let them see You  
In me  
Let them hear You  
When I speak  
Let them feel You  
When I sing  
Let them see You  
Just let them see You in me  
Let them see You
