A funny face kid  
From down the street  
Always very close at hand  
He was just a cowboy  
I was Lady Grand  
But I don't think  
I would have shoot him down  
If I knew then  
What I know now  
  
High school days and puppy love  
Learning what it's all about  
He was kind of awkward  
I was filling out  
I don't think  
I would have played around  
If I knew then  
What I know now  
  
Too many years  
Too many tears  
Too many other things  
Too many men  
Time and again  
I have to test my wing  
No time for love's strings  
Or wedding ring  
  
A pretty young girl from Baltimore  
Got herself a real good man  
Once he was a cowboy  
Who wanted Lady Grand  
And I know that  
I would have made that vow  
If I knew then  
What I know now  
  
Once he was a cowboy  
Who wanted Lady Grand  
And I know that  
I would have made that vow  
If I knew then  
What I know now
