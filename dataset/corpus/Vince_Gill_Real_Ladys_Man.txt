Oh the taste of wine and liquor and a woman's tender kiss  
Sure paints the perfect picture that's so hard to resist  
Though the lure of the old night life has always tempted fools  
It can't compare with what you stand to lose  
  
[Chorus]  
Remember the promise you wear on your left hand  
Cheatin's no companion for a real lady's man  
  
If only I had listened to my own words of advice  
And turned down the invitation in another woman's eyes  
For the softness of a stranger, I threw good love away  
Friend there ain't no higher price to pay  
  
[Chorus]
