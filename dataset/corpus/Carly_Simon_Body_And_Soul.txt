My heart is sad and lonely  
I sigh for you  
For you dear only  
Why haven't you seen it  
I'm all for you body and soul  
I spend my days in longing  
And wonder why  
It's me you're wronging  
I tell you I mean it  
I'm all for you body and soul  
I can't believe it  
It's hard to conceive it  
That you'd turn away romance  
Are you pretending  
It looks like the ending  
Unless you'd give me one more chance  
To prove dear  
My life a wreck you're making  
You know I'm yours just for the taking  
I'd gladly surrender  
Myself to you - Body and Soul
