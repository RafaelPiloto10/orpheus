When I was a little biddy boy  
My grandmother bought me a cute little toy  
Silver bells hanging on a string  
She told me it was my ding-a-ling-a-ling  
  
My Ding-A-Ling My Ding-A-Ling I want you to play with My Ding-A-Ling  
My Ding-A-Ling My Ding-A-Ling I want you to play with My Ding-A-Ling  
  
Then mama took me to Grammar school  
But I stopped off in the vestibule  
Every time that bell would ring  
Catch me playing with my ding-a-ling  
  
Once I was climbing the garden wall,  
I slipped and had a terrible fall  
I fell so hard I heard bells ring,  
But held on to My ding-a-ling  
  
Once I was swimming cross turtle creek  
Man them snappers all around my feet  
Sure was hard swimming cross that thing  
With both hands holding my ding-a-ling  
  
This here song it ain't so sad  
The cutest little song you ever had  
Those of you who will not sing  
You must be playing with your own Ding-a-ling
