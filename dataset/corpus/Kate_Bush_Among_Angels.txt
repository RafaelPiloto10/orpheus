Only you can do something about it.  
There's no-one there, my friend, any better.  
I might know what you mean when you say you fall apart.  
Aren't we all the same? In and out of doubt.  
I can see angels standing around you.  
They shimmer like mirrors in Summer.  
But you don't know it.  
And they will carry you o'er the walls.  
  
If you need us, just call.  
Rest your weary world in their hands.  
Lay your broken laugh at their feet.  
I can see angels around you.  
They shimmer like mirrors in Summer.  
There's someone who's loved you forever but you don't know it.  
You might feel it and just not show it.
