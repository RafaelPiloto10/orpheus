Round and round the Christmas tree  
Presents hanging there for you and me  
Lights all shining merrily  
Christmas a week away  
  
A-ring around the Christmas tree  
Children making up a melody  
Grown-ups laughing happily  
Christmas a day away  
  
Wishing, hoping, boxes to open  
But we agree it's right to wait  
Turkey and dressing, after the blessing  
And there's just a night to wait  
  
Round and round the Christmas tree  
Opening presents with the family  
One for you and two for me  
Oh what a Christmas Day  
  
Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong,  
Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong  
Tra-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la  
  
Round and round the Christmas tree  
Presents hanging there for you and me,  
Lights all shining merrily  
Christmas a week away  
  
Lights all shining merrily  
Christmas a week away  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la  
  
Wishing, hoping, boxes to open  
But we agree it's right to wait  
Turkey and dressing, after the blessing  
And there's just a night to wait  
  
Round and round the Christmas tree  
Opening presents with the family  
One for you and two for me  
Oh what a Christmas Day  
Oh what a Christmas Day  
Oh what a Christmas Day  
Oh what a Christmas Day  
Oh what a Christmas Day
