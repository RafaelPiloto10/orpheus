In the winter time  
When all the leaves are brown  
And the wind blows so chill  
And the birds have all flown for the summer  
I'm callin', hear me callin', hear me callin'  
  
In the winter time  
When all the leaves are brown  
And the wind blows so chill  
And the birds have all flown for the summer  
I'm callin', hear me callin', hear me callin'  
I'm callin', hear me callin', hear me callin'  
In the winter time  
  
In the winter time  
When all the leaves are brown  
And the wind blows so chill  
And the birds have all flown for the summer  
I'm callin', hear me callin, hear me callin'
