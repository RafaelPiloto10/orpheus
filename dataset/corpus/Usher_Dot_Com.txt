Oooh I love the way you dirty type  
I can take you home on escape  
Oooh I need your backspace in my life  
Thank God you don't have a flat screen  
  
[Bridge]  
Please baby, I got to see you  
And I really want to please you  
So get on my laptop so I can download  
  
[Chorus]  
Online, I love the way you log on  
We can do it all night  
I'll make you dot com  
Baby if you sign on  
I'm a make you lights off  
Ooh baby if you log on  
I'll make you dot com  
  
I wanted to link up with you baby, at first sight  
With you I get to use my "F" keys  
I can't wait to give you mega bytes  
I got all the memory you'll need  
Let my fingers do the talking  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ooh baby, you want this I know  
I can't wait to give you my hard drive  
My moonlight  
If it's alright baby  
  
I'm always at your window  
Ready to shift and control you  
If you want me to  
Say yes baby  
Say yes baby  
Say yes baby  
Say yes baby  
Got to say oooh  
  
Say yes baby  
Say yes baby  
You got to say yes  
Yes  
  
Please baby I got to see you  
And I really want to please you  
So get on me baby, get up on me oh  
  
[Chorus]
