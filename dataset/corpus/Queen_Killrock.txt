Killrock  
Time to see God in the future now  
Because everything dies babe  
Get a skull in the back of my car  
KILLROCK!  
  
Ha ha ha ha  
You stay away from me  
Oooohhh  
Oooohh  
  
KILLROCK!  
  
Get back to the pain in the back of my car  
Killrock's a problem but you have died  
Say yourself you're sleeping here  
  
KILLROCK!  
  
Pay me for ours  
Killrock  
Killrock  
Yeah ha ha
