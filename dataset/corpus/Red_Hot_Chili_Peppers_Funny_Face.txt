It must have been your funny face  
It must have been your love  
It must have been your paper chase that  
Wasn't quite enough  
  
It must have been your tiny dance that  
Made me laugh out loud  
Must have been your angel dust that  
Put me on your cloud  
  
You're the reason why...  
You're the reason I...  
  
It must have been your love... oh  
It must have been your love... I said  
It must have been your love... In a little bit...  
It must have been your love  
  
It must have been your poppy eyes  
That made me step outside  
It must have been the sight of tears that  
Let me know I cried  
  
It must have been your bunny shake  
It must have been your love  
A lot of girls won't come around they  
Treat me like a wolf  
  
It must have been your love  
It must have been your love... I said  
It must have been your love... I gotta get that  
It must have been your love  
  
You're my angel baby  
You're my darling  
You're my star  
Lo lo lo lolita  
Let her see me deep in love  
  
You're the reason why...  
You're the reason I...  
  
It must have been your love  
It must have been your love... now  
It must have been your love...  
It must have been your love  
  
You're my angel baby  
You're my darling  
You're my star  
Lo lo lo lolita  
Let her see me deep in love  
  
I've stared at eyes in a crooked frown  
Make more of life, just settle down  
Every single little princess needs a crown  
Make more of life, just settle down
