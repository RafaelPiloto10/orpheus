Going down the road with a friend or two  
Ain't nothing in the world, in the world I can't do  
You thought you'd seen it all, you ain't seen nothing new  
Ain't nothing in the world, in the world I can't do  
  
I can really rock, I'm a rock 'n' roller  
And I can't control myself  
  
Big city, big lights can see it up ahead  
No one can stop me, I'm driving in your head  
Make a name for myself and I'll be number one  
And I'll turn around and turn around and know that I', the one  
  
I can really rock, I'm a rock 'n' roller  
And I can't control myself  
I can really rock, really rock 'n' roll  
And I can't control myself  
  
I'm the man in a rock 'n' roll band  
I'm so crazy for you baby, yes, I'm the man  
I'm the man in a rock 'n' roll band  
I'm so crazy for you baby, yes, I'm the man, yes, I am  
  
I'm the man in a rock 'n' roll band  
I'm so crazy for you baby, yes, I'm the man  
I'm the man in a rock 'n' roll band  
I'm so crazy for you baby, yes, I'm the man, yes, I am  
  
I'm the man in a rock 'n' roll band  
I'm so crazy for you baby, yes, I'm the man  
I'm the man in a rock 'n' roll band  
I'm so crazy for you baby, yes, I'm the man, yes, I am
