We won't dance no more  
We won't shine out on the floor  
We won't sway the band won't play  
We won't dance  
  
I kid you not we were hot  
When the weekend came we'd dance non-stop  
No jitterbug no substitute  
No twist and turn no crash and burn  
Could top us two  
  
We won't dance no more  
We won't shine out on the floor  
We won't sway the band won't play  
We won't dance  
  
As I dipped you down in your yellow dress  
We'd brush the floor in a slow caress  
As minutes turned to a rising sun  
We'd leave the day to rest  
Our dancing done  
  
We won't dance no more  
We won't shine out on the floor  
We won't sway the band won't play  
We won't dance  
  
If I were God and controlled what is  
I'd steal your shoes so you couldn't dance with his  
Well I'm not all that I could be  
But you'll never dance with him  
The way you danced with me  
  
We won't dance no more  
We won't dance no more  
Well I'm not all that I could be  
But you'll never dance with him  
The way you danced with me  
  
We won't dance no more  
We won't shine out on the floor  
We won't sway the band won't play  
We won't dance  
  
We won't dance no more  
We won't shine out on the floor  
We won't sway the band won't play  
We won't dance
