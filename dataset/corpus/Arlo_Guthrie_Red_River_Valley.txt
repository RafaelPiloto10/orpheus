From this valley they say you are going  
We will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile  
For they say you are taking the sunshine  
That has brightened our pathways awhile  
  
[Chorus]  
Come and sit by my side, if you love me  
Do not hasten to bid me adieu  
Just remember the Red River Valley  
And the cowboy who loved you so true  
  
I've been thinking a long time, my darling  
Of the sweet words you never would say  
Now, alas, must my fond hopes all vanish  
For they say you are going away  
  
Do you think of the valley you're leaving  
O how lonely and how dreary it will be  
And do you think of the kind hearts you're breaking  
And the pain you are causing to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They will bury me where you have wandered  
Near the hills where the daffodils grow  
When you're gone from the Red River Valley  
For I can't live without you I know  
  
[Chorus]
