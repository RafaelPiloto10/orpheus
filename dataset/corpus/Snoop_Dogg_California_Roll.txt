[Chorus: Pharrell]  
Baby you could be a movie star, hey (in Los Angeles)  
Get yourself a medical card, yeah (in Los Angeles)  
Cause that's how California rolls  
They do the fingers like Redd Foxx (in Los Angeles)  
You can make it on a light blue box, yeah (in Los Angeles)  
Cause that's how California rolls, yeah  
  
[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]  
Say when I pass you that weed and I ask you can you roll?  
You say roll, don't you know that I'm from round here?  
Well girl I like the way you roll  
Even though you from the ghetto you belong in a home in the mountains  
Not talking 'bout the view  
I'm talking 'bout me and you  
So if you wanna go to Melrose  
Let's hit Adidas, cause girl we got our own shell toes  
And then we'll go to Venice  
You roll so good you might as well let me hit it  
For like 15 minutes  
Girl, you never gon' forget it  
And if you wanna go around town  
I could show you where all the real get it  
And if you wanna go downtown  
You might as well roll with a real nigga  
I'm not talking 'bout them fools  
I'm talking 'bout me and you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]  
And when I hand you that weed and I ask if you can roll?  
You say no, let me show you around here  
Cowgirl wanna roll with a winner  
Rodeo with a winner, Rodeo loud yeah  
Ain't got nothing to lose  
I'm talking 'bout me and you  
And girl I got a home in that valley, in a rolls in that valley  
Just tell 'em what my name is  
You heard about me, you heard all about me  
Mean you heard all the hittas that I'm with gangbanging  
But I ain't talking 'bout the news  
Girl you know that I'm talking 'bout you  
Let me show you all around  
I could show you where all the real get it  
And if you wanna go downtown  
You might as well roll with a real nigga  
I'm not talking bout them fools  
I'm talking 'bout me and you  
  
[Chorus]
