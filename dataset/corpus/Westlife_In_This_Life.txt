For all I've been blessed with in this life  
There was an emptiness in me  
I was imprisoned by the power of gold  
With one honest touch you set me free  
  
[Chorus]  
Let the world stop turning  
Let the sun stop burning  
Let them tell me love's not worth going through  
If it all falls apart  
I will know deep in my heart  
The only dream that mattered had come true  
In this life, I was loved by you  
  
For every mountain I have climbed  
And ever raging river crossed  
You were the treasure that I longed to find Without you love I would be lost  
  
[Chorus]
