My country's bigger than most  
And if asked I boast  
'Cause I'm really proud  
So I shout it loud  
Though our numbers are few  
We will welcome you  
  
Although we don't have history  
Gold medal winning teams  
Heroes or prisoners  
World famous volcanoes  
Still what we've got's glorious  
  
'Cause we've got  
Rocks and trees  
And trees and rocks  
And rocks and trees  
And trees and rocks  
And rocks and trees  
And trees and rocks  
And rocks and trees  
And trees and rocks  
And water  
  
All right, everyone!  
  
We've got  
Rocks and trees  
And trees and rocks  
And rocks and trees  
And trees and rocks  
And rocks and trees  
And trees and rocks  
And rocks and trees  
And trees and rocks  
And water  
  
In Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada  
Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada
