Snowman sittin' in the sun doesn't have time to waste  
He had a little bit too much fun  
Now his head's erased  
Back in the house, family of three  
Two doin' the laundry and one in the nursery  
  
We brought a brand new baby back from Bangladesh  
Thought we'd name her Emily  
She's beautiful. Beautiful  
  
Yes, sir, head's erased, brain's a bowl of jelly  
Hasn't hurt his sense of taste  
Judging from his belly  
But back in the house, family of four now  
Two doin' the laundry and two on he kitchen floor  
  
We brought a brand new baby back from mainland China  
Sailed across the China Sea  
She's beautiful. Beautiful  
  
Go-kart sittin' in the shade  
You don't need a ticket to ride  
It's summertime, summertime  
Slip down a water slide  
Little kid dancin' in the grass  
Legs like rubber band  
It's summertime, summertime  
There's a line at the candy stand  
Keep an eye on them children  
Eye on them children in the pool  
You better keep an eye on them children  
Eye on them children in the pool  
  
We brought a brand new baby back from Kosovo  
That was nearly seven years ago  
He cried all night, could not sleep  
His eyes were bright, dark and deep
