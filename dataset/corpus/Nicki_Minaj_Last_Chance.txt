Yo I coulda' been had fame  
Jump shot with a stupid ass aim  
Cause you couldn't around the last name  
So my crossover wins the last game  
And it's ill right?  
Switched up the flow, but it's still right  
Go back to that, yea I still might  
I'ma just do me, when it feel right uh  
You can bring it any day  
Natural Bad Ass, N.B.A.  
That's my initials  
That's why officials  
Don't blow the whistle  
Bang bang the pistol  
And I'm and I'm bossy  
Can't keep these hoes up off me  
Damn the flow nasty, coffee  
Don't treat me like the Pope and cross me  
  
[Chorus]  
Yea this is my last chance oh, last chance oh  
Yea this is my last chance, then shoot  
I'm ready to shoot  
I'm ready to shoot (ready to shoot)  
I'm ready to shoot (ready to shoot)  
I'm ready, I'm ready to shoot (ready to shoot)  
I'm ready, I'm ready to shoot  
I'm ready to shoot  
  
I get it in though  
No sexual innuendo  
Nobody that I can just depend on  
Until I touchdown in the end zone  
And then they come out like roaches  
P-P-Peck it away like vulchers  
But little did they know  
Distribute the payroll  
Pick up the album, pick up the single  
Sadly, I'm so business savvy  
Similar protocol but the templates vary  
Never been like me and never been like this  
My flows are crisis they scream in high pitch  
Uh gun cock, pause  
And I'm well aware of the gun laws  
Telling 'em that I'm running for the top Forbes  
Headed-to-the-top dot org  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All the days of my life I have been waiting for this time  
Could you believe now it's right before my eyes  
Anybody trying to stop me better not fuck with me this time  
Shoot, I'm ready to shoot into the sky  
  
Yea this is my last chance oh, last chance oh  
Yea this is my last chance, then shoot  
I'm ready to shoot  
I'm ready to shoot (ready to shoot)  
I'm ready to shoot (ready to shoot)  
I'm ready to shoot (ready to shoot)  
I'm ready to shoot  
I'm ready to shoot  
  
Only one chance one bullet in the gun  
This is my life and I only got one yea  
The saftey's off and I put on stars  
Oh stick 'em up, stick 'em up  
Ready to shoot  
Yeah yeah I'm ready to shoot  
This is my life and I only got one yea  
The saftey's off and I put on stars  
Get ready, I'm ready to shoot
