That old Bilbao moon, I won't forget it soon  
That old Bilbao moon, just like a big balloon  
That old Bilbao moon would rise above the dune  
While Tony's Beach Saloon rocked with an old-time tune  
We'd sing a song the whole night long and I can still recall  
Those were the greatest (those were the greatest)  
Those were the greatest (those were the greatest)  
Those were the greatest nights of them all  
No paint was on the door (no paint was on the door)  
The grass grew through the floor (the grass grew through the floor)  
Of Tony's Two By Four (of Tony's Two By Four)  
On the Bilbao shore (on the Bilbao shore)  
But there were friends galore (howdy do, howdy do)  
And there was beer to pour (chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug)  
And moonlight on the shore (and the moon shines above)  
That old Bilbao shore (on the shore, not the floor)  
We'd sing all night with all our might and I can still recall  
Those were the greatest (those were the greatest)  
Those were the greatest (those were the greatest)  
Those were the greatest nights of them all  
That old Bilbao moon, I won't forget it soon  
That old Bilbao moon, just like a big balloon  
That old Bilbao moon would rise above the dune  
While Tony's Beach Saloon rocked with an old-time tune  
We'd sing all night with all our might and I can still recall  
Those were the greatest (those were the greatest)  
Those were the greatest (those were the greatest)  
Those were the greatest nights of them all
