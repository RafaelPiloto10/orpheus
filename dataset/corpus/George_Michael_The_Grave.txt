The grave that they dug him had flowers  
Gathered from the hillsides in bright summer colors  
And the brown earth bleached white at the edge of his gravestone  
He's gone  
When the wars of our nation did beckon  
A man barely twenty did answer the calling  
Proud of the trust that he placed in our nation  
He's gone  
But eternity knows him, and it knows what we've done  
And the rain fell like pearls on the leaves of the flowers  
Leaving brown, muddy clay where the earth had been dry  
And deep in the trench he waited for hours  
As he held to his rifle and prayed not to die  
But the silence of night was shattered by fire  
As guns and grenades blasted sharp through the air  
And one after another his comrades were slaughtered  
In morgue of Marines, alone standing there  
He crouched ever lower, ever lower with fear  
"They can't let me die! The can't let me die here!  
I'll cover myself with the mud and the earth  
I'll cover myself! I know I'm not brave!  
The earth! the earth! the earth is my grave"  
When the wars of our nation did beckon  
A man barely twenty did answer the calling  
Proud of the trust that he placed in our nation  
He's gone
