They'll shine a light in your eyes  
They'll set you up with their lies, sweet lies  
Shane, if you leave me, they'll hurt you believe me  
And something inside you will die-  
  
I know the reason you bleed  
I understand what you need, and you need me  
Babe, I can help you, think of nights that I held you  
And only I can make you sleep  
  
Shane, Shane, no one will hide you  
Like the one that cries your name-  
Shane nobody wants you  
Like the one that haunts your dreams  
  
I know the voices you hear  
I know the secrets you fear  
Dreams that will wake you, faces that shake you  
Remember that I've always been near  
  
Forget the love that I gave you  
Forget the child that I saved  
Only I know your heartbeat, only I know your backstreets  
And only I can take you away
