I've been gone a long long time, waiting for you  
I didn't want to see you go, oh, no, no  
And now it's hurting so much, what can I do?  
I wanted you to be my wife  
  
The days are passing slowly, since you've gone  
Your memories are all I have, yes I have  
I sit here waiting but you'll never show  
Without you I can't carry on, oh my baby  
  
You said you'd always love me, all of my life  
And then you said your last goodbye, yeah, goodbye  
Why the sudden changes, why all the lies?  
I should have seen it in your eyes  
  
The endless hours of heartache, waiting for you  
My summer love has turned to rain, all the pain  
The silent emptiness of one sided love  
My life means nothing now you're gone, ooh my baby
