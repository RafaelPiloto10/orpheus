I fell too hard and much too deep in love with you  
I let you come and go at will it seems  
You're back again this time you say forever  
But I wonder just how long forever means  
How long is forever this time  
How long until one night you don't come home again  
How long is forever this time how long until I'm all alone again  
  
People say I'm foolish when I take you back  
And it could be they're right but who can say  
You'll be welcome here within my arms forever  
Even when forever ends for me today  
How long is forever this time...
