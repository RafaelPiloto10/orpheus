Who said that my party was all over  
Huh huh I'm in pretty good shape  
The best years of my life are like a supernova  
Huh huh perpetual craze I said that  
Everybody drank my wine - you get my drift  
And then we took a holiday on Khashoggi's ship, well  
We really had a good good time they was all so sexy  
We was bad we was blitzed  
All in all it was a pretty good trip  
  
This big bad sucker with a fist as big as your head  
Wanted to get me I said go away  
I said kiss my ass honey  
He pulled out a gun wanted to arrest me  
I said uh uh uh babe  
Now listen no-one stops my party  
No-one stops my party  
No-one no-one no-one stops my party  
Just like I said  
We were phased we was pissed  
Just having a total eclipse  
  
That's good  
  
This one's on me so let us do it just right  
This here one party don't get started 'till midnight  
  
Everybody party to the left - party to the right  
Do it all night alright alright  
Should I lay my hands on you all right  
Left, right  
Left right no-one stops my
