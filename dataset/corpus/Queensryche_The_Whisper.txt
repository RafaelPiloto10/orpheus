Cries from the aisles  
the tolling of the judgement bell  
Eyes watched the violence  
the absence of those who have  
seen, marks the faith of the spell  
  
Cold is the viper  
stalking the night for the heat  
It must find  
Time is the promise  
delivered with stunning consistency  
line after line, time after time  
the innocent victim awaits...  
  
Please take my hand  
Don't be afraid  
I am your master  
You are my slave  
  
Voices are calling me back  
Back to the day  
Footsteps had followed  
Me faster... listen  
  
Screams from a new love  
the passion was burning, it singed in a stare  
Free under the night sun  
The fear of the hunger  
Will always be there in my mind  
Time after time the morning  
Will close a new page  
  
Please take my hand  
Don't be afraid  
I am your master  
You are my slave  
  
Follow the impulse you have  
I'll show you the way  
Forget what you've learned in the past now  
Listen and...
