I'll be alright I'll be alright if I don't have to smile  
If I don't to face the morning sunrise for a while  
I'll get along you know I'll take tomorrow with a grin  
If I never have to think about her love again  
  
And I won't mind if words are spoken  
In empty love songs as long as I don't have to hear  
I'll be alright if I don't have to face the world again  
And if I never love again I'll be alright  
  
Last night she gave the final word, she said her last goodbye  
And disappeared forever in the world outside  
One kiss and then she took her leave to go I know not where  
Into the misty shadows of the midnight air  
  
But I won't mind if words are spoken  
In empty love songs as long as I don't have to hear  
I'll be alright if I don't have to face the world again  
And if I never love again I'll be alright  
And if I never love again I'll be alright
