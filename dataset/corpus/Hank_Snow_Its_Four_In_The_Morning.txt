It's four in the morning and once more the dawning just woke up the wanting in
me  
Wishing I'd never met her knowing if I'd forget her  
How much better off she would be  
The longer I hold on the longer this goes on the harder that it's going to be  
But it's four in the morning and once more the dawning just woke up the
wanting in me  
I've never deserved her God knows when I hurt her  
That's the last thing that I want to do  
She tries but she can't tell how she feels but I know  
Too well what she's going through  
If I love her so much I don't know why I can't do the right thing and just let
her be  
But it's four in the morning and once more the dawning just woke up the
wanting in me  
  
Last night I told her this time it's all over making ten times I told her
goodbye  
Last night we broke up this morning I woke up  
And for the tenth time I'm changing my mind  
I saw more love in her eyes when I left her than most foolish man will ever
see  
But it's four in the morning and once more the dawning just woke up the
wanting in me  
Yes it's four in the morning and once more the dawning just woke up the
wanting in me
