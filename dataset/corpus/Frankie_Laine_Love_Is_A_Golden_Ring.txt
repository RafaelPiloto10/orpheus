Your love and mine, dear, It will shine, dear  
Just like that golden ring on your finger  
Love isn't just for tonight  
Or two arms that hold me so tight  
Love is a song that two must learn to sing  
Love is a golden ring  
Love's not a summer romance  
Or the kiss that follows the dance  
Love is forever a rare and lasting thing  
Love is a golden ring  
A wedding in the church  
The happiness and tears  
The little ring you'll wear  
Will last through all the years  
And in our golden days  
We'll find eternal spring  
With love and the golden ring  
So please won't you wear it for me  
With faith and sweet charity  
For lonely lovers lost  
This message we will bring  
Love is a golden ring  
Love is a golden ring  
Love is a golden ring  
Love
