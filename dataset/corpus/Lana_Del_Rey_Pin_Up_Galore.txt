Baby I have become,  
Baby I have become someone  
A monster, eh-eh-yeah  
A monster, eh-eh-yeah  
  
Vrizes, Wrizes a diamond tiara  
Here's to the girl with the blue mascara  
I have a disco ball mind  
Lights flashing all of the time  
I have ideas go by my mind  
I wanna die, I wanna die  
I wanna die, I wanna die  
Uh yeah  
  
Baby I have become someone  
Baby I become who i-i-i-i,  
Baby I have become someone  
Not of this world, eh-eh-yeah  
Not of this world, uh-uh-yeah
