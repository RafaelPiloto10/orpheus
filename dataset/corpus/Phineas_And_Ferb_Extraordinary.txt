[Verse:]  
I want to be extraordinary  
Not just extra-ordinary  
It seems like everywhere I see  
People far more interesting than me  
I know the changes kinda scary  
But maybe I should try to vary  
  
[Hook:]  
Some minor details  
A small degree  
A slightly different version of me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Well I could learn to cook vegetarian  
Or take fashion workshop  
Meditate, calculate  
Learn to knit a tank top  
  
Yoga, hula  
Clogging, jogging  
Walking on a tight rope  
Take a correspondence course  
And learn to make my own soap  
  
Jumping on a pogo stick  
Standing in a wheat field  
Going on a snipe hunt  
Gonna keeps my eyes peeled  
Take a little time to really decorate my door  
And change my hair to black and then I'll dye it back orange  
  
Underwater taxidermy  
Shopping for a suitcase  
Peeling tangerines while placing second in a sack race  
  
Lion taming, online gaming  
Try'n to win a prize fight  
Appear in a talk show  
Dress-up like a water sprite  
  
Yeah!  
I'm gonna be extraordinary  
I'm gonna stand out from the crowd  
And shout out loud  
You'll see  
That it's a brand new me!!
