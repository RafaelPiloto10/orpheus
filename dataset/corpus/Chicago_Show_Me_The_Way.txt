Flying so high  
Feeling so low  
Fill my empty heart  
Don't say no  
Can I get through this night, with some loving to show  
Won't you show me the way to go, I don't know  
  
Won't you open your eyes  
I know you really care  
You see these games you play  
They're just not fair  
After all the good times and secrets we've shared  
Won't you show me the way to go, I don't know  
  
I want to take my place  
I want to take my place  
I want to take my place with the loved ones  
Well I still can't see how things were meant to be  
Love me even for one day I'll treat you like a lady  
In my heart you'll stay forever you know  
Won't you show me the way to go, I don't know  
  
Marching into your heart  
Marching into your heart
