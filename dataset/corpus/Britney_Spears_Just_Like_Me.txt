[Verse 1]  
Got those heels on that you love  
The ones that drive you crazy  
Exactly what you're dreaming of  
I'll give it to you, baby  
150 miles away  
Singing out my lungs  
Driving fast all through L.A  
Warming up my tongue  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Heart's beating fast  
When I'm turning the key  
I see you on your back  
And I just can't believe  
  
[Chorus]  
She looks just like me, just like me  
No, I just can't believe  
She looks just like me, just like me  
Just like me, ooh  
  
[Verse 2]  
Before I think, I start to run  
But you can't even face me  
Know exactly what you've done  
Know exactly, baby  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Pictures, they flash  
And I can't even sleep  
I see you on your back  
And I just can't believe  
  
[Chorus]  
She looks just like me, just like me  
No, I just can't believe  
She looks just like me, just like me  
Just like me, ooh  
  
[Bridge]  
She can, she can, she can have you  
She can, she can, she can have you  
She can, she can, she can have you  
She can, she can, she can  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Pictures, they flash  
And I can't even sleep  
I see you on your back  
And I just can't believe  
  
[Chorus]  
She looks just like me, just like me  
No, I just can't believe  
She looks just like me, just like me  
Just like me, just like me
