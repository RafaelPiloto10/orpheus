I've got feelings inside me  
I'm not letting you know  
I can't stop the wastin' of the world  
Wastin' all the days and minutes hours slip away  
I can't stop the ways in which you plan  
To leave our past behind  
I know they've changed your mind  
Isn't that the way someone told you  
Isn't that the way someone cared  
Isn't that the way someone told you  
Isn't that the way someone cared  
I can't stop the rest of me  
From not letting you know  
I'm not here to preach to you what I had  
Faking all the feelings that I started letting grow  
I can't stop the ways in which you plan  
To do it all, leave it all behind  
Tomorrow's left my mind  
Isn't that the way someone told you  
Isn't that the way someone cared  
Isn't that the way someone told you  
Isn't that the way someone cared
