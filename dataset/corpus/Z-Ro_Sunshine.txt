[Z-Ro talking]  
Yes sir, Z-Ro, Lil' Keke, Screw to Mo City  
CMG, KMJ, this how it go  
  
[Chorus]  
Sunshine, living in the ghetto daily trying to find  
Sunshine, trying to make a million hustling got to dodge  
One time, I keep my head up even though I feel like giving up  
Sometimes, Keep your head up trying to find sunshine  
  
[Z-Ro]  
Man what happened to the sun on my lawn it's so gloomy and grey  
I got a feeling 5-O gone try to do me today  
Nothing but backstreets for me cause I don't need a vacation  
Looking for front run up that seem the only compensation  
The hood is on fire, other soldiers won't let it down  
They ain't set tripping but out here jacking has been alive  
Misery spinning what they clicking for no reason at all  
Even intentions of stacking paper they pleasing them all  
And outside, smelling like nothing but formaldrahide  
It's an everyday suicide, R.I.P. to the ones that died  
Wake up before you get caught up don't keep on selling your soul  
Until your life fall up, you got to try to find  
  
[Chorus]  
[Lil' Keke]  
We living in a world that's dirty and so shife  
You trying to figure out this the game that's called life  
These days is cold and got me searching for my soul  
Like paper bags and lawn chairs man you unfold  
I'm looking out my window for some, sunshine  
I'm trying to give it up cause I swear it's my time  
I five petreat and start thinking about my sins  
Roll up another square and start thinking about the benz  
Talent and skills is what I'm bringing  
New homes and microphones got the cell phone ringing  
Push play on the deck, to let my mind collect  
And try to mash on the gas with no time to sweat  
This the ghetto, and that's all I know  
Another episode from the young don and Ro  
If the family is tight, then everything's alright  
So quick to catch flight for the sunlight, uh  
  
[Chorus]  
[Z-Ro]  
Seem like I can't stand the rain prosecution and struggle up in my brain  
Got to tell me slow down if you can see all of my veins  
Cause I ain't having none of that riff raff to get back and blood  
Keep my enemy close to me cause your killer be your 'cause  
I wish I was, able to socialize with why'all  
Instead of trading war stories and taking lies from why'all  
It's how it be though, Lil' Keke and Z-Ro we on the grind  
Long as they talking about us, we know we staying on they mind  
Don't hate us congratulate us, why why'all turning up why'all nose  
Cause it's been we be spittng straight be burning up why'all glow  
Want to take it away from pin and pad and pick up a gun  
You better repent my dog it's over, you done better try to find  
  
[Chorus - 2x]
