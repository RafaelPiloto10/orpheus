Oh no no  
oh no no  
  
Verse 1:  
Sometimes I wish I knew your name  
At times I want to say hello  
But you seem so far away  
To let my feelings show  
And though I don't know what to say  
I feel that someday soon one day  
Love will place you by my side  
And it shall be our guide  
  
Chorus:  
And then manana sera se si  
Means our love will always be  
Something special and also true  
Girl I long to be with you  
Oh manana sera se si  
Means our love will always be  
Something special and also true  
Girl I long for you  
  
Verse 2:  
When I have you by my side  
You will always be my pride  
Love so simple yet so sweet  
I do think you're all I need  
So I thought I'd let you know  
That my heart forever grows  
Closer to your warm embrace  
Everytime I see your face  
  
Chorus:  
And then manana sera se si  
Means our love will always be  
Something special and also true  
Girl I long to be with you  
Oh manana sera se si  
Means our love will always be  
Something special and also true  
Girl I long for you  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
And so manana sera se si  
Means our love will always be  
Something special and also true  
Girl I long to be with you  
Oh manana sera se si  
Means our love will always be  
Something special and also true  
Girl I long for you  
  
Bridge:  
Do you know I don't know you  
I want to show you I do love you  
That I do do, do love you  
Oh babe, I think about you  
Even though I don't know you  
I want to show you I do love you  
And that I do do, I think about you  
Oh babe, I do love you  
Even though I don't know you  
I want to show you I do love you  
I think about you  
Oh do do, oh do do, oh do do
