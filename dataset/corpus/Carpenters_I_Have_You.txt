I have always been a dreamer  
Followed visions of my own  
I was born to belong  
To the lines of a song  
And make then my home  
  
I believe in happy endings  
Though I've only known a few  
For as rare as they are  
Like a bright falling star  
I found one in you  
  
Sometimes  
All the world can seem so  
Friendless  
And the road ahead so  
Endless  
And the dream so far away  
Sometimes  
When I'm almost  
To surrender  
Then I stop  
And I remember  
I have you  
To save my day  
  
Often my imagination  
Has me reaching out too far  
When I fell you were there  
With you hand in the air  
You knew from the start  
  
Sometimes  
After all you've done  
To save me  
Thru the love you freedly  
Gave me  
Every step along the way  
Sometimes  
People ask what keeps me  
Going  
And in truth, it comes from  
Knowing  
I have you  
To save my day  
  
Sometimes  
Feelng helpless  
When I held you  
Wishing words would come  
To tell you  
I have you  
To save my day
