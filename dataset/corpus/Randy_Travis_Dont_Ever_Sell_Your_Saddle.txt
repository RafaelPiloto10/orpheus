Daddy shoulda been a preacher man  
'Cause everybody loved to hear him speak  
He didn't always follow his own advice  
But we got a sermon every week  
He'd say trouble always starts as fun  
And broken hearts will always mend  
Tough times don't last, tough people do  
And nothing breaks if it can bend  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't ever sell your saddle  
Never owe another man  
Watch where you spit on a windy day  
Don't use words you don't understand  
Find the Lord before you need him  
And never lose your pride  
Don't ever sell your saddle  
  
'Cause life's a long, long ride  
Daddy never ran from anything  
Always took his share of the blame  
Had a heart big enough to fill a valley up  
But hard enough to stop a train  
He said only fight when you have to  
'Cause there's always a faster gun  
And you'll know a hero from a coward  
When you see which way they run  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Daddy left me his old saddle the day he passed on  
And these words are etched into my mind just like they were in stone  
  
[Chorus:]
