This is the Awards for Industry and Free Enterprise  
So let me sit you down and tell you how I won first prize  
I took on your free enterprise and your pretty little shops  
Walked in with empty bags and walked out with the lot  
  
So I've come for my award, I've come for my award  
I thought I'd come in person that's the least I can afford  
Let hands be shook  
Champagne poured  
Sentence ignored  
Yes. I've come for my award

Anyone want a gold watch in a ladies' size?  
There's a few more round the back  
I stole them from your shop  
We've got no more in silver, that's all that you'd got  
  
So I've come for my award, I've come for my award  
I thought I'd come in person that's the least I can afford  
Let hands be shook  
Champagne poured  
Sentence ignored  
Yes. I've come for my award  
  
I chatted with your guards and winked at roving eye  
A thousand hidden cameras were searching cross the sky  
But they didn't see me pinch them from underneath their eyes  
  
So I've come for my award, I've come for my award  
I thought I'd come in person that's the least I can afford  
Let hands be shook  
Champagne poured  
Sentence ignored  
Yes. I've come for my award  
Jesus was my greatest accomplice  
Jesus was my greatest accomplice  
Jesus was my greatest accomplice  
Yes, I've come for my award  
  
Hairdryer, overcoat, telly, dot-to-dot  
Video, compact disc, there's nothing we forgot  
Whilst I was busy smiling my father got the lot  
I've come for my Award
