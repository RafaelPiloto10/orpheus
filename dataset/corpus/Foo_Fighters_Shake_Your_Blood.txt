Looking for relief in your miserable life  
You need some rock and roll  
And you better get it right  
Got to roll them bones,  
Do everything they say  
If you're cool, you're the fool.  
Make it work everyday.  
  
Rock out, do you quick  
My, my, my, let it rip  
Rock out, feeling good.  
Break your heart. Shake your blood.  
  
Out upon the stage, crowd is going wild,  
Love to see them women, babe  
I ain't in denial.  
Make you crazy too.  
Make you show it out.  
Feeling good, get some wood  
You should, You knew you could  
  
Rock out, do it now  
My, my, my, show me how  
Rock out, make it good.  
Break your heart. Shake your blood  
  
Want to be a winner, want to be the man.  
Want to make yourself insane, join up with the band  
Want to fall in love, want to make your mark  
Want to get out in the storm, want to break a thousand hearts  
  
Rock out, strike it rich  
My, my, my, it's a bitch  
Rock out, I knew you could  
Break your heart. Shake your blood  
  
Rock out, don't you stop  
My, my, my, ride the rock  
Rock out, ain't so good  
Break your heart. Shake your blood
