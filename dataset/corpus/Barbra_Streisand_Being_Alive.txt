Someone to hold you too close  
Someone to hurt you too deep  
Someone to sit in your chair  
And ruin your sleep  
And make you aware of being alive  
  
Someone to need you too much  
Someone to know you too well  
Someone to pull you up short  
And put you through hell  
And give you support for being alive-being alive  
Make me alive, make me confused  
Mock me with praise, let me be used  
Vary my days, but alone is alone, not alive!  
  
Somebody hold me too close  
Somebody force me to care  
Somebody make me come through  
Ill always be there  
As frightened as you of being alive,  
Being alive, being alive!  
  
Someone you have to let in  
Someone whose feelings you spare  
Someone who, like it or not  
Will want you to share a little, a lot of being alive  
Make me alive, make me confused  
Mock me with praise, let me be used  
Vary my days, but alone is alone, not alive!  
  
Somebody crowd me with love  
Somebody force me to care  
Somebody make me come through  
Ill always be there  
As frightened as you to help us survive,  
Being alive, being alive, being alive, being alive
