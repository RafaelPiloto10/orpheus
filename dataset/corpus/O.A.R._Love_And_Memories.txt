Lovely, you're always lovely  
A vision, you were the one  
Now I am stuck inside a memory  
You forgot about our destiny  
You buried me, didn't you?  
  
Didn't you love me faster than the devil  
Run me straight into the ground  
Drownin' deep inside your water  
Drownin' deep inside your sound  
  
You're always floating  
A vapor that I couldn't see  
Here I am stuck inside a yesterday  
Everything has given way  
You fell from me, didn't you?  
  
Didn't you love me faster than the devil  
Run me straight into the ground  
Drownin' deep inside your water  
Drownin' deep inside your sound  
  
Love me faster than the devil  
Run me straight into the ground  
Drownin' deep inside your water  
Drown in love and memories  
  
Maybe I am a crowded mind  
I watch your eyes glaze over  
Stare down at the floor  
You were amazing to me  
I was amazing to you  
But here we go again  
  
Didn't you love me faster than the devil  
Run me straight into the ground  
Drownin' deep inside your water  
Drownin' deep inside your sound  
  
Love me faster than the devil  
Run me straight into the ground  
Drownin' deep inside your water  
Drownin' deep inside your sound  
  
Love me faster than the devil  
Run me straight into the ground  
Drownin' deep inside your water  
Drown in love and memories
