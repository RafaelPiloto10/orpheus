[Verse 1]  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
I don't ever ask you where you've been  
And I don't feel the need to  
Know who you're with  
I can't even think straight but I can tell  
That you were just with her  
And I'll still be a fool  
I'm a fool for you  
  
[Chorus]  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
[Verse 2]  
I don't ever tell you how I really feel  
Cause I can't find the words to say what I mean  
And nothing's ever easy  
That's what they say  
I know I'm not your only  
But I'll still be a fool  
Cause I'm a fool for you  
  
[Chorus]  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for  
Oh, oh, (Just a little bit) oh, oh (Hallelujah)  
  
[Bridge]  
(Just a little bit, oh yeah)  
I know I'm not you're only  
But at least I'm one  
I hear a little love is better than none  
Oh babe  
  
[Chorus]  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for  
  
[Chorus]  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart (Just a little bit baby)  
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want (Is all I want)  
Just a little bit of your heart (Just a little bit)  
Just a little bit of your heart (Just a little bit)  
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
