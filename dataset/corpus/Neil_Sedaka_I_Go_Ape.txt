The moon is bright above  
Oh, what a night for love  
And as I hold you near  
I whisper in your ear  
  
I go ape everytime I see you smile  
I'm a ding-dong gorila and  
I carry on cave man style  
I'm gonna bop you on the head  
And love you all the while  
  
Well, I'm a monkey's uncle  
Who's a cousin to a chimpazee  
Like I was reelin and rockin  
And swingin from a coco-nut tree  
  
Oh, honey can't you see  
You bring out the monkey business in me  
  
Orangotango ring-ting-tong  
I'm related to old King Kong  
Honey won't you say you're mine  
With no hunky dunky monkey shine  
  
When you hold my hand  
I'm a pre-historic man  
I go ape!  
  
Like a barrel of monkeys  
On an aba-da-ba honey moon  
I go squealin and screechin and howlin  
Like a big baboon  
  
Well, baby I'll explode  
If you don't come and kiss me soon  
  
Yeah! Ooh!  
  
Ohh... Honey you know that  
I'm gonna be true to you  
I'll keep you in bananas  
and bring you coco-nuts too  
And we'll settle down  
In the nearest county zoo  
  
Orangotango ring-ting-tong  
I'm related to old King Kong  
Honey won't you say you're mine  
With no hunky dunky monkey shine  
  
When you hold my hand  
I'm a pre-historic man  
I go ape!
