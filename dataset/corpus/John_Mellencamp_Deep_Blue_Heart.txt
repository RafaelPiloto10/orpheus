Daylight is leaving  
And the night is closing in  
In just a few hours  
The sleeplessness begins again  
  
My head feels thick  
And I'm unable to think  
I guess I'll wait 'til tomorrow  
And see what it brings  
  
I have a little hope left  
And I guess that's someplace to start  
But my memory's full  
Of a deep blue heart.  
  
My fun-loving sense of humor  
Is nowhere to be found  
I stare into my own eyes  
With tears flowing down  
  
I'd sing out a song  
But I've forgotten the tune  
And the words now escape me  
But I think it's about you  
  
My vision now is way out in the dark  
With just a little sight left  
Of a deep blue heart  
  
I see us both flying  
In the clear blue sky  
Floating out on the ocean  
With the sun in our eyes  
  
Caught in a moment  
Just me and you  
In complete honesty  
Where everything is true  
  
That's what I wanted to believe  
Right from the start  
Just a little place for myself  
In a deep blue heart  
  
Carve out a place for myself  
In your deep blue heart
