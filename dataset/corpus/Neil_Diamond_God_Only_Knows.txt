I may not always love you  
But as long as there are stars above you  
You'll never need to doubt it  
I'll make you so sure about it  
  
'Cause god only knows what I'd be without you  
  
And if you should ever leave me  
The world would still go on, believe me  
And the world could show nothing to me  
But what good will living do me  
  
God only knows what I'd be without you  
God only knows what I'd be without you  
  
And if you should ever leave me  
Life would still go on, believe me  
And the world could show nothing to me  
So what good will living do me  
  
God only knows what I'd be without you  
God only knows what I'd be without you  
God only knows what I'd be without you  
God only knows what I'd be without you
