Feel the magic in the air  
Christmas is all around  
Something about this special time of year  
A blanket of snow falls down from the sky  
Voices of angels  
Open our hearts so we can open our arms  
  
[Chorus:]  
And we'll all join hands  
To celebrate the goodness  
That shines inside of everyone  
It must have been a part of some great design  
Guess it's Christmas time  
  
Seein' the faces of the little boys and girls  
Singing their First Noel  
A sweet refrain heard all around the world  
A song of forgiveness, comforting peace  
A time to remember what life really means (Life really means)  
The important things (Important things)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Guess it's Christmas time  
Open our hearts so we can open our arms  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Must have been a part of some great design  
Guess it's Christmas time  
Merry Christmas
