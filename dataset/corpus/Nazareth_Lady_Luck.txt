There's a woman in New Orleans  
Said to love me she was born  
But that was Friday payday  
By Sunday she was gone  
So I drove on down to Texas  
Where I did not do to well  
I fell hard for this woman child  
Turn you she came from well  
Lady Luck help me hold on  
Lady Luck help me hold on  
To one that I love  
Well I had no luck with women  
Thought I'd try my hand at cards  
So I headed for Nevada  
Gonna really take them on  
But the way the hands were fallin'  
And the way the money goes  
You could say it's getting colder  
You could say I nearly froze  
Lady Luck help me hold on  
Lady Luck help me hold on  
To one that I love  
So I started playing guitar  
In a southern boogie band  
And the ladies I was meeting  
Make you want to buy the farm  
Gettin' tired of saving souvenirs  
Don't remind me where they're from  
And the nights come on like magic  
In the morning it's all gone  
Lady Luck help me hold on  
Lady Luck help me hold on  
To one that I love  
Lady Luck help me hold on  
To one that I love  
Lady Luck help me hold on  
Lady Luck help me hold on  
To one that I love  
Lady Luck help me hold on  
Lady Luck help me hold on
