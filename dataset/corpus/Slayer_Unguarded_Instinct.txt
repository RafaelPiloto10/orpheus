Use the need, lose control,  
Hidden voice inviting,  
Imposing will, unconscious skill  
Embraced immoral passion.  
Born is still, thirst for thrill,  
Indulgence of illusion.  
Neurotic, psychotic,  
Dead silent screams, come alive.  
  
Killing seed, first degree,  
I shut the world outside.  
Denied and laid to waste,  
The body and soul divide.  
  
A final thrill, a timely kill  
Unbound, unguarded.  
Fantasized, realized,  
Enforced upon the dying.  
Free reign of the asylum,  
Archaic energy thrives,  
Dead cold, I control  
Eternal screams that slowly die.  
  
Killing spree, first degree.  
I shut the world outside.  
Denied and laid to waste,  
The body and soul divide.  
  
Dimentia born of sin,  
A symptom that begins,  
Vengeance so divine.  
  
Lost my grip of what's real.  
Unrestrained self-induced vertigo.  
Manic power chills my spine.  
I can't erase this instinct I embrace.  
  
Two faced moral abandon,  
Races my blood boils my skin.  
Unhinging the doorway to this asylum,  
Releasing unshackled poison dreams.  
Beginning the end of temptation.  
A vengeance so divine.  
The end of temptation,  
A vengeance so divine.  
  
Killing spree, first degree,  
I shut the world outside.  
Denied and laid to waste,  
The body and soul divide.
