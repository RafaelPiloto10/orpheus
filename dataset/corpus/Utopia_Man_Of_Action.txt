You got all the time in the world  
You count the minutes like beads on a string  
Open the floor for a little debate  
While you sit and watch the rug unravelling  
You got a message from the weather man  
You're looking for a thumb when there's a hole to fill  
Who bites the bullet?  
Man of action will  
Call me. have gun. will travel.  
Think about it, ponder on that  
If you can't make that move, man of action will  
Think about it, ponder on this  
With a fist or a kiss  
I'll put your dreams in action  
Pressure's building up and down the line  
You see the difference in the smallest thing  
Put a new tape in your message machine  
Hit the shelters 'til you see what change will bring  
Sometimes justice seems a fragile thing  
You paralyze it with a lack of will  
Trade in your karma  
Man of action will  
Call the avenging angel  
Think about it, ponder on this  
If you can't make that move, man of action will  
Think about it, ponder on that  
Time to cut through the fat  
I am your first reaction  
Someone's got to push it on  
Someone's got to shake it on  
Someone's got to take it on  
Man of action will
