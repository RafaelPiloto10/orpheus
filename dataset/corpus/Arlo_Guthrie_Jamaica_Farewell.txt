Down the way where the nights are gay  
And the sun shines daily on the mountain top  
I took a trip on a sailing ship  
And when I reached Jamaica I made a stop  
  
[CHORUS:]  
But I'm sad to say, I'm on my way  
Won't be back for many a day  
My heart is down, my head is turning around  
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town  
  
Sounds of laughter everywhere  
And the dancing girls swaying to and fro  
I must declare that my heart is there  
Though I've been from Maine to Mexico  
  
[CHORUS]  
Down at the market you can hear  
Ladies cry out while on their head they bear  
Ackie rice and salt fish is nice  
And the rum is good any time of year  
  
[CHORUS]  
[CHORUS]
