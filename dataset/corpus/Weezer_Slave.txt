Love  
Barely alive  
In your arms  
Slave  
  
Dreams  
Taken too far  
Every night  
Slave  
  
Who  
Put on your heart?  
Who  
Put on your heart?  
Who  
Put on your heart?  
'Cause I can't change, no  
  
When  
You're on your own  
You can see  
Things  
  
Clear  
Clear as a bell  
And you're free  
Slave  
  
Who  
Put on your heart?  
Who  
Put on your heart?  
Who  
Put on your heart?  
'cause I can't change, no  
  
And my girl  
We'll say goodbye  
To the things  
We'll never try  
  
Who  
Put on your heart?  
Who  
Put on your heart?  
Who  
Put on your heart?  
'cause I can't change, no  
  
Love  
Barely alive  
Love  
Barely alive  
Love  
Barely alive  
Slave
