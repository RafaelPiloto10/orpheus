Baby, baby, we like your lips  
Baby, baby, we like your pants  
All aboard for funtime  
  
Baby, baby, we want in  
We want some, we want some  
All aboard for funtime  
  
Last night I was down in the lab  
Talking to Dracula and his crew  
All aboard for funtime  
  
Oh, I feel lucky tonight  
I wanna get some and run around  
All aboard for a funtime  
  
Baby, baby, we like your lips  
Baby, baby, we like your pants  
All aboard for funtime  
  
Everybody, we want in  
We want some, we want some  
All aboard for funtime
