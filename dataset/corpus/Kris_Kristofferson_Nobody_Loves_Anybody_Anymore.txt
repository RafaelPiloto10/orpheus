Nobody loves anybody anymore, dear  
Nobody loves anybody anymore  
Life ain't what it used to be  
Or seemed to mean before  
The moon is just the moon  
The stars are only stars  
And if it don't come easy, now  
It ain't worth fighting for  
Nobody loves anybody anymore, dear.  
  
I'm back being me again  
And you're back being you  
Stronger for the loving war  
That we've been through  
We both took a look ahead  
And closed the door  
Nobody loves anybody anymore, dear  
Nobody loves anybody anymore.  
  
Maybe you believed in me  
And I believed in you  
Baby, we've been fooled before  
Everything we ever dreamed  
Ain't never ever coming true  
Nobody loves anybody anymore, dear  
Nobody loves anybody anymore.
