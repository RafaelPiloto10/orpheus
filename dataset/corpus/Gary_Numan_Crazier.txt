The more I take a look inside, the more I'm fried  
The more I understand the ride, the more I slide  
The more you put me back in line, the more I tried  
The more you looked into my eyes, the more you lied  
I come back crazier, but feel much better  
You come back crazier, you'll feel better  
The more I disregard the signs, the more I fly  
The more I walk across the lines, the more I glide  
You come back crazier, but feel much better  
You come back crazier, you'll feel better  
You come back crazier, but feel much better  
You come back crazier, you'll feel better
