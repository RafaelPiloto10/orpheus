All through my wandering years  
I always said I was biding my time  
But alone in the dark I'd face my fears  
That no other heart would come to mine  
  
At first when you found me  
It took me a while 'til I realized  
Why I felt weak when you were around me  
Why I couldn't speak when I looked in your eyes  
  
All this time I've been searching  
Until you, I was lost in my dreams  
And I never knew that love could feel like heaven  
Watching over me  
  
Oh wherever you go  
Invisible hands reach over the miles  
For every wish you make to the stars  
There's one silent kiss I send to the sky  
  
All this time I've been searching  
Until you I was lost in my dreams  
And I never knew that love could feel like heaven  
Watching over me  
  
Everything has changed  
Since you came my way  
Cause you put the color  
In a world of grey  
And you make the love  
That carries me away  
  
All this time I've been searching  
Until you I was lost in my dreams  
And I never knew that love could feel like heaven  
Watching over me  
Feels like heaven  
Watching over me
