Back in '95 when this was new  
I guess I didn't have a clue  
I thought the world would change with the right song  
So we picked it up and moved it out  
And turned the whole thing upside down  
I told myself it wouldn't be too long  
And I believed in everyone  
And everything they told me  
And I believed that anything  
Anything was possible  
  
Shoot the moon  
Shoot the moon  
Shoot the moon  
  
Hit or miss it makes no difference  
Back when everything was looking up  
I thought I'd never get enough  
I didn't let the world obstruct my view  
And we thought that it would never end  
We had our fun in spite of it  
And paved the way for something slightly new
