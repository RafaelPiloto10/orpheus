You get a line and I'll get a pole, Honey,  
You get a line and I'll get a pole, Babe.  
You get a line and I'll get a pole,  
We'll go fishin' in the crawdad hole,  
Honey, Baby mine.  
  
Sittin' on the bank 'til my feet get cold, Honey,  
Sittin' on the bank 'til my feet get cold, Babe,  
Sittin' on the bank 'til my feet get cold,  
Lookin' down that crawdad hole,  
Honey, Baby mine.  
  
Yonder comes a man with a sack on his back, Honey,  
Yonder comes a man with a sack on his back, Babe,  
Yonder comes a man with a sack on his back,  
Packin' all the crawdads he can pack,  
Honey, Baby mine.  
  
The man fell down and he broke that sack, Honey,  
The man fell down and he broke that sack, Babe,  
The man fell down and he broke that sack,  
See those crawdads backing back,  
Honey, Baby mine.  
  
I heard the duck say to the drake, Honey,  
I heard the duck say to the drake, Babe,  
I heard the duck say to the drake,  
There ain't no crawdads in this lake,  
Honey, Baby mine.  
  
What are you gonna do when the pond gets dry, Honey,  
What are you gonna do when the pond gets dry, Babe,  
What are you gonna do when the pond gets dry  
Sit on the bank catch a old horsefly  
Honey, Baby mine.
