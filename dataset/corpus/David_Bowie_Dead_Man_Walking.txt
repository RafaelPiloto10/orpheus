He swivels his head  
Tears his eyes from the screen  
As his past puts him back in Atlantic City  
  
There's not even a demon in Heaven or Hell  
Is it all just human disguise?  
As I walk down the aisle  
  
Gone gone gone spinning slack through the end?  
Deadens? my brain falling up through the years  
Till I swivel back round then I fly fly fly  
Losing breath from the water then I'm gone gone gone  
  
And I'm gone gone gone  
Now I'm older than movies  
Let me dance away  
Now I'm wiser than dreams  
Let me fly fly fly  
While I'm touching tomorrow  
And I know who's there  
When silhouettes fall  
  
And I'm gone  
Like I'm dancing on angels  
And I'm gone through a crack in the past  
  
Like a dead man walking  
Like a dead man walking  
  
Three old men dancing under the lamplight  
Shaking their sex and their bones  
And the boys that we were  
An alien nation in therapy  
Sliding naked and new  
Like a bad tempered child  
On a rain slicked street  
  
Gone gone gone spinning slack through the end?  
Deadens? my brain falling up through the years  
Till I swivel back round then I fly fly fly  
Losing breath from the water then I'm gone gone gone  
  
And I'm gone  
  
And I'm gone, like I'm dancing on angels  
And I'm gone, through the crack in the past  
  
Like a dead man walking  
Like a dead man walking  
Like a dead man  
Like a dead man walking  
  
And I'm gone gone gone  
Let me dance dance dance  
And I'm gone gone gone  
Let me dance dance dance  
  
And I'm gone, like I'm dancing on angels  
And I'm gone, through a crack in the past  
And I'm gone, like I'm dancing on angels  
And I'm gone, through a crack in the past  
  
Like a dead man walking  
Like a dead man walking  
Like a dead man  
Like a dead man walking
