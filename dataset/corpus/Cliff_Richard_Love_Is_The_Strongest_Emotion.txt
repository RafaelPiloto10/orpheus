One day away from you, I'm feeling  
Something new  
The way you look at me says everything  
It's much too late to hide what's building up inside  
Hot blood is rushing through my heart and soul  
  
[Chorus]  
Love is the strongest emotion  
No one can stop what we do  
Love is the strongest emotion  
That you'll ever feel when your love is real  
  
I've been awake all night, my eyes are open wide  
I never dreamed you, you're no fantasy  
Oh, don't make me wait too long  
'Cause you're the only one, girl, you change my  
Wishes to reality  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I want to touch, and I want to feel  
What you do to me  
'Cause nothing on Earth can move me like you  
Come on, baby, show me 'cause I need to give my  
Love to you  
  
I want to touch, and I want to feel  
What you do to me  
'Cause nothing on Earth can move me like you  
Come on, baby, show me 'cause I need to  
Give my love  
  
Love is the strongest emotion  
No one can stop what we do  
Love is the strongest emotion  
That you'll ever feel when you know  
Your love is real
