Now that I've made up my mind you're gone it should be easier now  
Perhaps now my heart will stop hanging on it should be easier now  
The lesson I've learned from you gold can't buy a heart can be broken and
still survive  
Thanks to you now a much wiser man am I and it should be easier now  
  
The worst now is over I've stood the test it should be easier now  
They say everything happens for the best it should be easier now  
The wounds in my heart you've carved deep and wide  
Hollowed and washed by the tears I've cried  
But now there'll be more room for love inside and it should be easier now
