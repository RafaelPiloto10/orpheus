When you're in heaven  
What you gonna do?  
You're gonna sit around a cloud and say  
"Hey, what a lovely view"  
Is there a reason, why you're like you are?  
Is there a reason you'll be leaving?  
Is my love out of season?  
I wouldn't mind but to me that is Treason  
You started laughing  
When I held you in my arms  
You started leaving  
When I told you of my charms  
I was in love with you and then you said, we're through  
And then I said, "Boo hoo"  
Was my tie not on straight?  
Was it something I ate?
