On the field I remember you were incredible  
Hey shut up, hey shut up, yeah  
On the field I remember you were incredible  
Hey shut up, hey shut up, yeah  
  
On the match with the boys, you think you're all alone  
With the pain that you drain from love  
In a car with a girl, promise me she's not your world  
Cause Andy, you're a star  
  
Leave your number on the locker and I'll give you a call  
Hey shut up, hey shut up, yeah  
Leave your legacy in gold on the plaques that line the hall  
Hey shut up, hey shut up, yeah  
  
On the streets, such a sweet face jumping in town  
In the staff when the verdict is in  
In a car with a girl, promise me she's not your world  
Cause Andy, you're a star  
In nobody's eyes but mine  
Andy, you're a star  
In nobody's eyes but mine  
Andy, you're a star  
In nobody's eyes  
In nobody's eyes but mine
