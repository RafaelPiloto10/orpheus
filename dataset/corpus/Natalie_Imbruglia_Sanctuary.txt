Sit down  
Wait a minute  
I thought we were special  
This town and everyone in it  
Moves a little faster than the underground  
  
No time and time is money  
Feeling like a piece of machinery  
Let down when I say you tumble  
Falling over pieces of me  
  
I want to be your sanctuary  
Set you free  
Set you free  
I want to be your sanctuary  
Set you free  
Set you free  
  
Foot down  
Turn it around  
Don't even know where I want to go  
No sound and tunnel vision  
All I need is you on the radio  
  
No time and time is money  
Weaving through the traffic to cross the street  
Blues skies  
Now you're talking  
Gotta get the shoes off my feet  
  
I want to be your sanctuary  
Set you free  
Set you free  
I want to be your sanctuary  
Set you free  
Set you free  
  
I want to lead you and follow you  
I want to hold you and keep it true  
So many things that I want to do with you  
  
Last night under the light  
I thought we were special  
Your smile danced for a while  
I'm here to help you to keep it  
To keep it  
To keep it  
  
Cause I want to be your sanctuary  
Set you free  
Set you free  
I want to be your sanctuary  
Set you free  
Set you free  
  
I want to be your sanctuary  
Set you free  
Set you free  
I want to be your sanctuary  
Set you free  
Set you free  
  
I want to lead you and follow you  
I want to hold you and keep it true  
So many things that I want to do with you  
  
Ooh
