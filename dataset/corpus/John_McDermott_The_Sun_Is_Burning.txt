The sun is burning in the sky,  
Strands of clouds go slowly driftin' by  
In the park, the dreamy bees are droning in the flowers among the trees  
And the sun burns in the sky.  
  
Now the sun is in the west  
Little babies lay down to take their rest  
And the couples in the park are holding hands and waiting for the dark  
And the sun is sinking low.  
  
Now the sun has come to earth  
Shrouded in a mushroom cloud of death.  
Death comes in a blinding flash of hellish heat that leaves a smear of ash  
And the sun has come to earth.  
  
Now the sun has disappeared  
All that's left is darkness, pain and fear.  
Twisted sightless wrecks of men go crawling on their knees and cry in pain  
And the sun has disappeared
