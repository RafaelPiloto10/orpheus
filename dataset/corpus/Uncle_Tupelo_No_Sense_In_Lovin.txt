I don't know what you've been through  
You might think that I don't care  
But I do  
And I've tried to understand  
  
I've tried to understand your abuse  
But you've got no excuse  
And there's no use in lovin'  
Anyone who hates themselves  
  
You keep coming back  
So I hold you for a little while  
But I always go when I can't take your sad smile  
'Cause I can't stand it when you get so intense  
  
And it's all a part of our bad inheritance  
And there's no sense in lovin'  
Anyone  
Won't you come back for a while  
  
You could see exactly what you've always meant to me  
But you don't want to know  
You don't want to know  
And you don't know what I've been through  
  
And if I think that you don't care  
You probably do  
And there's no sense in lovin'  
Anyone who hates themselves
