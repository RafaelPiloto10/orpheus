I remember when, I remember  
I remember when I lost my mind  
There was something so pleasant about that place  
Even your emotions have an echo in so much space  
  
And when you're out there without care  
Yeah, I was out of touch  
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough  
I just knew too much  
  
Does that make me crazy?  
Does that make me crazy?  
Does that make me crazy?  
Possibly  
  
And I hope that you are  
Having the time of your life  
But think twice  
That's my only advice  
  
Come on now, who do you  
Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?  
Ha ha ha, bless your soul  
You really think you're in control?  
  
Well, I think you're crazy  
I think you're crazy  
I think you're crazy  
Just like me  
  
My heroes had the heart  
To lose their lives out on a limb  
And all I remember  
Is thinking, I want to be like them  
  
Ever since I was little  
Ever since I was little  
It looked like fun  
And it's no coincidence I've come  
And I can die when I'm done  
  
But maybe I'm crazy  
Maybe you're crazy  
Maybe we're crazy  
Probably
