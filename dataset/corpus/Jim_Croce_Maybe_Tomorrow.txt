Smoke another cigarette, have another drink or two  
Sit by the telephone 'til morning  
She never tells me where she's goin'  
But I think it's mighty plain  
Maybe tomorrow  
She'll be back home again  
  
She wasn't like this when I met her  
Whatever made her change?  
Now she never even says I love you  
She just comes a-rollin' in  
Never wanting to explain  
Maybe tomorrow she'll be back home again  
  
Wish that I could meet him  
Just to tell him who I am  
I would like to find out what he has  
That I don't have  
  
She never says a thing about him but it's plain as day  
She's going somewhere every evening  
Can't take it too much longer  
I think I'm goin' insane  
Maybe tomorrow she'll be back home again  
  
Wish that I could meet him  
Just to tell him who I am  
I would like to find out what he has  
That I don't have

She's going somewhere every evening  
Can't take it too much longer  
I think I'm goin' insane  
Maybe tomorrow she'll be back home again
