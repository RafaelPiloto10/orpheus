Doom, gloom and misery  
That's what you gave to me  
Cold, tight, late and mean  
Beyond my wildest dreams  
  
Now that it's over  
And the sun came out to shine  
  
Don't look for me  
'Cause I set myself free  
In my own time  
  
New days have come along  
And now I'm at where I belong  
Blue sky shines above  
And I got someone to love  
  
Now I think about it  
Lifts the clouds from my mind  
Goin' out on the sea  
Getting further from me  
  
In my own time  
My own time  
  
Bye, bye, bye, bye  
Is that a tear in your eye  
Too late to cry  
You and your precious disguise  
  
Sometimes I wonder if I ever saw the sign  
But it's too late to care  
'Cause I've done that, been there  
In my own time  
  
So don't look for me  
'Cause I set myself free  
In my own time  
In my own time
