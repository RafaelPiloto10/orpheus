[Verse:]  
You think that you're so slick  
I got something for you  
Hold that thought- you're old news, older than my old shoes  
Since you like to play games, grow up, act your damn age  
Tricks for kids, you're so lame, but you never really loved me the same  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now close that door behind you  
Yeah  
Close that door behind you  
Yeah  
Don't let it hit you on the way out  
Ha, ay  
Ha, ay  
Yeah  
Don't let it hit you on the way out  
Boy, I'm not thinkin 'bout you  
Yeah  
I'mma drink without you 'cause my girls are on the way out  
Ha, ay  
Ha, ay  
Yeah  
'Cause my girls are on the way out  
I'm on to another 'cause you change like the weather  
Say, "Ay, I got my girls"  
We in the party like "Ay, I got my girls"  
We in the party like "Ay, I got my girls"  
We be clubbing like  
Go home to your mother 'cause you're just another sucker  
Say, "Ay, I got my girls'  
We in the party like, "Ay, I got my girls"  
We in the party like, "Ay, I got my girls"  
We be clubbing like  
  
[Verse 2:]  
You dress like a corn fall  
Smiley faces on your drawls  
Immature, you're so wrong  
Don't come back 'till long gone  
Can't you see I'm priceless?  
Don't have sense to notice it  
Thought you had a hold of it, but you never really loved me the same  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now close that door behind you  
Yeah  
Close that door behind you  
Yeah  
Don't let it hit you on the way out  
Ha, ay  
Ha, ay  
Yeah  
Don't let it hit you on the way out  
I'm on to another 'cause you change like the weather  
Say, "Ay, I got my girls"  
We in the party like "Ay, I got my girls"  
We be clubbing like  
Go home to your mother 'cause you're just another sucker  
Say, "Ay, I got my girls"  
We in the party like, "Ay, I got my girls"  
We in the party like "Ay, I got my girls"  
We be clubbing like  
  
[Bridge:]  
My phone's on silent  
I'm so tired  
I don't wanna hear your name no more  
Don't wanna see your face no more  
Shut, shut, shut, shut, shut the front door (x3)  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm on to another 'cause you change like the weather  
Say "Ay, I got my girls"  
We in the party like "Ay, I got my girls"  
We in the party like "Ay, I got my girls"  
We be clubbing like  
Go home to your mother 'cause you're just another sucker  
Say "Ay, I got my girls"  
We in the party like "Ay, I got my girls"  
We in the party like "Ay, I got my girls"  
We be clubbing like (x1)
