An eerie order underneath even chaos, as if the finger of God,,  
In order and disorder, is always there  
I think he has nothing to support this. why-you're so full of it!  
Aliens, protecting society how? Chaos happens.  
There's too many people here  
Gotta learn the way to turn  
Hat over eye  
Feeling dead more than alive  
Give her something to rely on  
One more time.  
No one hears the sound  
Fear is all around  
Turn the music loud  
No more lullaby.  
No way in, no way out  
Empty talk and TV shouts  
Got to find the way around  
No, you ain't no lifer  
In this town.  
No one hears the sound  
Fear is all around  
Turn the music loud  
No more lullaby.  
Stop the beat, hear the sound  
Time has come for you to speak  
Your mind  
Can't you hear the sound?  
Chaos all around  
Turn the music loud  
No more lullaby  
Dee-dee-dee  
Dee-dee-dee  
Learn to fly.
