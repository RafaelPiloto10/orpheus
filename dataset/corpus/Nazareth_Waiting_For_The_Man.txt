Cruisin' on down to my street corner  
Where me and my friends hang out  
I'm pickin' up Billy along the way  
Man he knows what it's all about  
Jed knows some chicks that can be had  
He's got his old mans car  
You know that can't be bad  
Phil just got numbered in a fight  
But we all jumped in now ol' Phil's alright  
  
Hangin' out together on the street  
Lookin' so hot we can't be beat  
Keepin' so cool when we get hassled  
Takin' our time to move along  
And if you're lookin' to start some trouble  
  
Man you don't know what you're takin' on  
Me and Billy all the guys  
Fat Marie with the friendly eyes  
She ain't so pretty but, ooh my my my  
Street corner people waitin' for the man  
Just me and Billy and all the guys  
Fat Marie with the friendly eyes  
She ain't so pretty but, ooh my my my  
Street corner people, we're waitin' for the man  
  
Shootin' our job to the local ladies  
Showin' them such a good time  
Drinkin' our wine and gettin' crazy  
And movin' on down the line  
Just me and Billy, all the guys  
Fat Marie with the friendly eyes  
She ain't so pretty but, ooh my my my  
We're just street corner people waitin' for the man
