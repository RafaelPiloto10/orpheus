Released on the cd-single for "promises"  
  
Never gonna die now  
Crawling from a wrecked jam, I'm laughing out loud  
Angel on my shoulder  
Living at the speed of sound  
Heavenly distraction  
I'm hanging on the edge and spinning out of control  
Choose your medication  
It's a generation overload  
  
I can see it falling from the sky  
Can you feel me  
I can hear you calling when you cry  
Can you see me  
Pain and suffering, your knees are tied  
Will you hear me  
Everchanging as your worlds collide  
  
Running going nowhere  
Take it to the limit then it's payback time  
Nothing but a heartache  
Waiting at the end of the line  
Take a look around, babe  
You're looking down the barrel of a loaded mind  
Generation landslide  
Crawling through the enemy lines  
  
I will be the one your justify  
Will you hear me  
I will kiss you with a last goodbye  
  
I thought I was the one who could survive  
Does anyone get outta here alive  
I gotta find the courage, gotta make a change  
And start all over again  
Taken for a ride against my will  
And taking it is always such a bitter pill  
Shaken for the sake of it, no more  
Gotta get away cause I don't know what I'm doing it for  
  
I can see it falling from the sky  
Can you feel me  
I can hear you calling when you cry  
Can you see me  
I will be there when you close your eyes  
Will you hear me  
Everchanging as your worlds collide
