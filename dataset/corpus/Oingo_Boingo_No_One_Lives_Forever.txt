You worry too much  
You make yourself sad  
You can't change fate  
But don't feel so bad  
Enjoy it while you can  
It's just like the weather  
So quit complaining brother  
No one lives forever  
  
Let's have a party there's a full moon in the sky  
It's the hour of the wolf and I don't want to' die  
  
I'm so happy  
Dancing while the Grim Reaper  
Cuts cuts cuts but he can't catch me  
I'm clever as can be  
And I'm very quick  
But don't forget  
You've only got so many tricks  
No one lives forever  
  
You think you've got it rough  
What about your darling doggie  
Ten short years  
And he's getting old and groggy  
I don't think it's very fair  
Cold Chop Low  
But it's all relative my friend cause  
No one lives forever  
  
Let's have a party there's a full moon in the sky  
It's the hour of the wolf and I don't want to' die  
  
I'm so happy

I'm clever as can be  
And I'm very quick  
But don't forget  
You've only got so many tricks  
No one lives forever  
  
You worry too much

No one lives forever  
  
Let's have a party there's a full moon in the sky  
It's the hour of the wolf and I don't want to' die  
  
No one beats him at his game  
For very long but just the same  
Who cares there's no place safe to hide  
Nowhere to run no time to cry  
So celebrate why you still can  
Cause any second it may end  
And when it's all been said and done  
Better that you had some fun  
Instead of hiding in a shell  
Why make your life a living hell?  
Drink a toast, down the cup  
Drink to bones that turn to dust  
  
Cause  
No one, no one, no one...  
No one lives forever!
