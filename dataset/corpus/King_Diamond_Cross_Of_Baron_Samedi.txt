Tuesday evening  
  
One single hour, is like a working day  
Father Malone is getting tired  
Darkness...has come again  
The Demons seem to be resting  
Sarah is looking just like Hell  
There ain't much left of her to save now  
  
Meanwhile in Salem's quarters  
There's shadow that moves  
Into a room full of secrets of life  
Into a room only few have survived  
  
There is a cross upon the wall  
The cross of Baron Samedi  
The shadow is taking the cross away  
The shadow is Lula, the girl that no one ever sees  
  
I see her shadow with that cross mine  
I see her shadow slipping into the night  
The cross of Baron Samedi will set us free  
The cross of Baron Samedi, just wait and see  
  
The cross of Baron Samedi is full of nails  
The cross of Baron Samedi could split your head  
Take it to Sarah... Take it to Sarah... Sarah  
  
Darkness..she's up again  
Sarah is standing in front of Father Malone  
Sleeping..the Father's on a chair  
Sarah is saying: "Father, I'm about to sin"  
  
Then one to the Father's head  
The cross is coming down so hard  
Screaming, bleeding, Malone goes down  
Again and...again and...his blood is all around  
  
"Stop it Sarah stop"  
I don't know why, but Sarah dropped the cross  
Two hours later everyone was here  
Police and ambulance, wiping up the tears  
  
Samedi... Samedi... Samedi
