Memories we share together, moments no one else can know  
I will keep them close to me, never let them go  
  
Once you filled my hands with roses-then you gave your heart to me  
When a kiss had followed, this Love was meant to be  
  
Time goes by, and the snow is drifting- slowly in the sky cold, cold night  
As you lie beside me, I can hear your heartbeat  
  
You have lost yourself in dreaming, I have lost myself in you.  
Now we lie beneath the sky, stars, and midnight blue.
