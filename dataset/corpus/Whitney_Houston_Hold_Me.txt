I hold you, I touch you  
Make you my woman  
I'll give you my love  
With sweet surrender  
Tonight our hearts will beat as one  
And I'll hold you, I'll touch you  
Make you my woman tonight  
  
There's something in your eyes I see  
A pure and simple honesty  
  
[Chorus]  
Hold me in your arms tonight  
Fill my life with pleasure  
Let's not waste this precious time  
This moment's ours to treasure  
Hold me in your arms tonight  
We'll make it last forever  
When the morning sun appears  
We'll find our way together  
  
I believe you  
When you say that you love me  
Know that I won't take you for granted  
Tonight the magic has begun  
So won't you hold me touch me  
Make me a woman tonight  
  
There's something in your eyes I see  
I won't betray your trust in me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll hold you (Hold)  
And touch you (Touch me baby)  
Make you my woman (Make me a woman)  
Tonight  
  
[Chorus: x2]
