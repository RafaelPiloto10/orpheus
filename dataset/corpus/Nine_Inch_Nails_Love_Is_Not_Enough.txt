The more that we take  
The paler we get  
I can't remember what it is  
We tried to forget  
  
The towel on the floor  
So cold it can sting  
In your eyes is a place  
Worth remembering  
  
Do you wake up and taste this  
And smash it apart  
I've gone all this fucking way  
To wind up back at the start  
  
Hey the closer we think we are  
Well it only got us so far  
Have you got anything left to show  
No no I didn't think so  
  
Hey the sooner we realize  
We cover ourselves with lies  
Well Underneath we're not so tough  
Oh love is not enough  
  
Well it hides in the dark  
Like the weaker and vain  
We didn't give it a mouth  
So it cannot complain  
  
We never really had a chance  
We never really make it through  
And to think I believed  
I believed I could get better with you  
  
Hey the closer we think we are  
Well it only got us so far  
Have you got anything left to show  
No no I didn't think so  
  
Hey the sooner we realize  
We cover ourselves with lies  
Well Underneath we're not so tough  
Oh love is not enough
