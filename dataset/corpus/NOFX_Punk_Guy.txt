Crazier than GG, yet more PC than Ian  
Got colored teeth like Johnny  
Exudes a vicious disposition  
His hair sticks out like Colin' did, he jumps  
  
Similar to Springa, he points his middle finga  
Not just he singer in the band  
Voted biggest asshole and role model of the year  
Got a face like Charles Bronson  
  
Straight outta Green Bay Wisconsin  
Not just a singer in the band  
He'll puke on you, he'll fuck your mom, he'll smoke while huffing gas  
He was the punkest mother fucker I ever did see  
  
Hell he was even more punk than me  
He should've been on the cover  
He should've been on the cover  
He should've been on the cover of Punk and Disorderly Volume II
