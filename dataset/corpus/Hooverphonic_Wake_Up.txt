You're the needle  
In my veins  
Pleasure mostly  
Ends in pain  
  
Temptation is a part of us  
But us is driving me insane  
Now it's time to make decisions  
Yes ain't easy but no's too safe  
  
Wake up  
Don't tell me what do  
Wake up  
Don't tell me what to say  
Wake up  
But there's one thing you can tell  
Wake up  
And that's how I'd feel  
When there's no more you  
When there's no more you  
  
We don't need no competition  
In the end this is no game  
Deliver me your best and I will  
Give you what is left of me  
  
Excuses are the final drop  
Excuses don't relieve the pain  
Solitude ain't so bad  
When there's nothing left for us to gain  
  
Wake up  
Don't tell me what do  
Wake up  
Don't tell me what to say  
Wake up  
But there's one thing you can tell  
Wake up  
And that's how I'd feel  
When there's no more you  
No more you  
You  
No more you  
You  
  
You're the needle  
In my veins  
Pleasure mostly  
Ends in pain  
Nothing left for  
Us to gain  
  
Wake up  
Don't tell me what do  
Wake up  
Don't tell me what to say  
Wake up  
But there's one thing you can tell  
Wake up  
And that's how I'd feel  
When there's no more you  
When there's no more you  
When there's no more you  
When there's no more you  
When there's no more you
