Open up your eyes  
Take the devil from your mind  
He's been holding on to you  
And you're so hard to find  
The wind outside is cold  
Restless feeling in my soul  
Tempting me to get away  
But there's no place a man can go  
God, will you lead me where I roam?  
Help me not to let my feelings show  
No, no you are the one, oh, how could you be  
So blind?  
The devil prays on runaways  
He's never far behind  
The many years I've tried  
Now have been revealed to me  
Closer is the love you'll find  
Waiting so patiently  
God, will you lead me where I roam?  
Help me not to let my feelings show.  
No, no  
Take the devil  
Take the devil  
From your mind
