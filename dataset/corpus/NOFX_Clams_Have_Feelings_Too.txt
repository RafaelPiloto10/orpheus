Birds are dumb, 'cause small bird brains  
But so are kids and old people  
Some birds talk, most others sing  
I don't see you eat a talking bird  
  
Pigs smell bad, they roll in poo  
But so do kids and elderly  
I don't see you chop off an old man's feet  
Put 'em in a mason jar and pickle them  
  
No chowder for you, 'cause clams have feelings too  
Actually they don't have central nervousness  
No manhatten style, clams have the right to smile  
Come to think about it, they don't have a face  
  
They have no face, no place for ears  
There's no clam eyes, to cry clam tears  
No spinal cord, they must get bored  
Might as well just put them out of misery  
  
I don't beleive it's selfish  
To eat defenceless shellfish  
  
No chowder for you, clams have feelings too  
It could happen to you, clams have feelings too  
I don't think they do, clams have feelings too
