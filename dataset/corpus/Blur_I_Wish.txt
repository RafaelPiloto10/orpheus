I wish the music would play by itself  
Shredded fingers - no ideas  
  
I wish this rainy day could be the last  
Could the world end - what a God send  
  
I wish I could stop wishing you were here  
But I don't want to - cos I still want you  
  
I wish I didn't feel so flippin mad  
Don't wanna scare you - just wanna love you  
  
I wish my life could last a thousand years  
Then I'd be clever - and build a heaven  
  
I wish I could bring nick drake back to life  
He'd understand - hold my hat band  
  
I wish a constant stream of happy shit  
Live forever - in world of leather  
  
I wish the rain would just leave me alone  
I can't wear that - stupid rain hat  
  
I wish I was in californ-i-a  
Perno perfurme - in the danube  
  
I wish the thing of love meant just one thing  
Cinderella - salmonella
