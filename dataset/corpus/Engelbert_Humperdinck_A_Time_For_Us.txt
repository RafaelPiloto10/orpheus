A time for us, someday there'll be  
When chains are torn by courage born of a love that's free  
A time when dreams so long denied  
Can flourish  
As we unveil the love we now must hide  
  
A time for us, at last to see  
A life worthwhile for you and me  
  
And with our love through tears and thorns  
We will endure  
As we pass surely through every storm  
A time for us, someday there'll be  
A new world  
A world of shining hope for you and me  
  
And with our love through tears and thorns  
We will endure  
As we pass surely through every storm  
A time for us, someday there'll be  
A new world  
A world of shining hope for you and me  
A world of shining hope for you and me
