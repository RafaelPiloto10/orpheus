New York poor New York  
New York poor New York  
  
Cars choking your child to death  
But you don't want to see  
Cause you only think about yourself  
How blind can you be  
  
New York poor New York  
Sniper on the rooftop New York  
New York poor New York  
Not fit for a dog in New York  
  
Everybody bites on the Big Apple  
Leave the hungry in tears  
But no one gives a damn no one really cares  
How they feel they're just paper people not real  
  
You need a gun to walk into New York  
  
Now you're broke and you're out on a ledge  
Who can help you this time  
Now you're down to your very last cent  
Still you're askin' me who was your friend  
I was your friend  
  
New York poor New York  
Who turned the lights out in New York  
  
New York poor New York  
Just another blackout in New York  
  
Girl dead on the 26th floor  
But no one knew her name  
Found her body behind the door  
Too young for the game  
  
New York poor New York  
Devils in the subway New York  
New York poor New York  
New York poor New York  
Talkin' talkin' talkin', watch out  
Harlem touching midtown New York  
New York poor New York  
  
Talkin' 'bout New York New York  
Money's getting tighter New York  
They're burning the bridges to New York
