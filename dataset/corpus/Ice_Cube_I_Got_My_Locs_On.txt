[Chorus: x2]  
I got my locs on  
I got my locs on  
And you can't see my eyes  
And you can't see my eyes  
I got my locs on  
I got my locs on  
And you can't tell I'm high  
And you can't tell I'm high  
  
[Verse 1: Ice Cube]  
I got my locs on welcome to the terror dome  
I got them carrots on givin' off them pheromones  
Women love it when the see me on that motorcycle  
Niggas hate it cause they know I'm makin' more than Michael  
Been ballin' since the word ballin played out  
They brought it back to describe me in that Maybach  
Me and Jeezy Jeezy rollin' with our locs on  
Smokin' somethin' good fuckin' up the ozone  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]  
Brand new Versace's ran me a buck 50  
(They must have set you back) no baby not really  
Switchin' lanes yes yea the chopper's just silly  
When it's bustin' at your ass we just laughin' at ya really  
I got my locs on dickies on keep the workin' niggas on  
Keep the cashmere vickis on yea she keep them vickis on  
Keep my locs on see you hatin' mother fuckers keep my locs on you know they
match my bag suckers  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I got my locs on cause my eyes are burgundy  
And when I get home I don't want the third degree  
The verdict be urgently these niggas wanna murder me  
They scared of the consequences comin' from my defenses  
It ain't that expensive have your ass hoppin' fences  
Lucky motherfucker missed your ass by some inches  
Next time understand what you fuckin' with its legendary status  
Sittin' behind these glasses nigga  
  
[Chorus: x2]
