Politician come to power take it slow  
People need what you know  
You're a leader so you have to play along  
Show the hand right or wrong  
When you're feelin' that you know the way to turn  
Either way still get burned  
It's the pride that makes you feel that you belong  
It's the pride that keeps you strong  
  
Don't you think it's fascinating?  
Don't you think it's fascinating?  
It's the pride that you feel it's the pride  
(When you finally break it all down it's the pride)  
It's the pride that you feel it's the pride  
(When you finally break it all down it's the pride)  
  
What makes you want to do the best you can?  
What makes you a better man?  
What makes you try again before too long?  
What keeps you standing strong?  
What makes you say the things you want to say,  
To make it a better day?  
It's the pride that makes you feel that you belong  
It's the pride that keeps you strong  
  
Don't you think it's fascinating?  
Don't you think it's fascinating?  
It's the pride that you feel it's the pride  
(When you finally break it all down it's the pride)  
It's the pride that you feel it's the pride  
(When you finally break it all down it's the pride)
