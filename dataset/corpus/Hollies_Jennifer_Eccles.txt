White chalk, written on red brick.  
Our love, told in a heart.  
It's there, drawn in the playground.  
Love, kiss, hate or adore.  
  
I love Jennifer Eccles.  
I know that she loves me.  
I love Jennifer Eccles.  
I know that she loves me.  
  
La la la la la la la  
La la la la la la.  
La la la la la la la  
La la la la la la.  
  
I used to carry her satchels.  
She used to walk by my side.  
But when we got to her doorstep,  
Her dad wouldn't let me inside.  
  
One Monday morning, found out I'd made the grade.  
Started me thinking, had she done the same?

verse 4  
  
I hope Jennifer Eccles  
Is going to follow me there.  
Our love is bound to continue.  
Love, kiss, hate or adore. Singing,  
  
chorus x2
