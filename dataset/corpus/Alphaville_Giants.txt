Be on your guard when you sit in the open places  
because I'm blessed with all the wonders of the sun  
when tigers, palmtrees, rattlesnakes unfold their graces  
that kind of magic you may get a sunburn from  
and there's no better way for us than our old sweet ways  
and angels burn to dust before the human race  
we're giants under a rainbow  
we're stranded east of eden  
Sometimes we're crying in the afterglow  
in a world of broken toys, how can we live without them  
freedom that is what you are always screaming  
it is a scream but more a nightmare than a laugh  
those without faith are liars even when they're dreaming  
I'd put my faith in god if he knew how to dance  
but there's no devil in the darkness, no demon in the skies  
nothing to be afraid of, cross my heart and hope to die  
freedom...  
Freedom...
