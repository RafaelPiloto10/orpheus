That night they were burning for truth  
Down on the corner of 14th and u  
They took your soul and they took you for fools  
Took all the windows from prisons and schools  
Now what's a poor man left to do?  
  
One heart now broken in two  
You start untying the answer of the youth  
New kids hear the sound of the drumming  
Mother nature your summer is coming  
Yesterday and today revolution on it's way  
  
Amen  
It was the feast and the famine  
Amen  
It was the feast and the famine  
It was the feast and the famine  
Feast and the famine  
  
Crossroads with nothing to lose  
Out of the basement and into the news  
Come change now shit getting heavy  
Salvation at the ready  
You look when I walk by  
Still screaming till I die  
  
Can't find peace if you can't find a home  
You can't survive as an island alone  
Black heart with a gaping wound  
Put back together by a troubled groove  
Check yourself wreck your brains  
Where is that BMA  
  
Amen  
It was the feast and the famine  
Amen  
It was the feast and the famine  
It was the feast and the famine  
Feast and the famine  
  
Hey  
Where is the monument  
To the dreams we forget?  
We need a monument  
And a change will come  
Yeah change will come  
Is there anybody there?  
Anybody there?  
  
Amen  
It was the feast and the famine  
Amen  
It was the feast and the famine  
It was the feast and the famine  
Feast and the famine  
  
Amen  
Where is the monument  
To the dreams we forget?  
We need a monument  
And a change will come  
And change will come  
Is there anybody there?  
Anybody there?
