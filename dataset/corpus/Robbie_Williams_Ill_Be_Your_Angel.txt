I know that you decided  
I know you deny it  
But I do believe that you don't have to walk this road alone  
Somewhere there's a fire  
Deep inside a fire  
So why won't you just let me be the light inside your heart?  
  
I'll be your angel  
I'll be your angel  
I'll be your angel  
When you need me  
You can call me, I'll be there  
I'll be your angel  
When you're lonely  
You can feel me, I'll be there  
I'll be your angel  
  
I'll be your angel  
I'll be your, I'll be your  
I'll be your angel  
I'll be your, I'll be your  
I'll be your angel  
I'll be your, I'll be your  
  
No more days of silence  
No more soul devided  
And I do believe  
If we just hold on  
Words don't have to be this cold  
Somewhere there's a fire, deep inside a fire  
So why won't you just let me be the light inside your heart?  
  
I'll be your angel  
I'll be your angel  
I'll be your angel  
When you need me  
You can call me, I'll be there  
I'll be your angel  
When you're lonely  
You can feel me, I'll be there
