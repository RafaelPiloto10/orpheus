A pleasant faced man steps up to greet you  
He smiles and says he's pleased to meet you  
Beneath his hat the strangeness lies  
Take it off, he's got three eyes  
Truth is false and logic lost  
Now the fourth dimension is crossed  
  
You have entered the Twilight Zone  
Beyond this world strange things are known  
Use the key, unlock the door  
See what your fate might have in store  
Come explore your dreams' creation  
Enter this world of imagination  
  
You wake up lost in an empty town  
Wondering why no one else is around  
Look up to see a giant boy  
You've just become his brand new toy  
No escape, no place to hide  
Here where time and space collide
