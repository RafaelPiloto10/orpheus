These are the thoughts of a father  
On the wedding day of his daughter  
As his mind wanders back to the first time he held her  
He looks at her now, the same pride in his eyes  
As onto the dance floor they glide  
This is the dance of the bride and her father  
Dance with me daughter of mine  
On this your wedding day  
Dance with me daughter of mine  
You'll soon be going away  
I loved you since you first began  
Now you've found a new man  
But I love you so, and this you must know  
That my love won't falter  
So dance with me daughter  
Beautiful daughter of mine  
  
We walk down the aisle  
On my face there's a smile  
But deep in my heart there's a tear  
Our friends and relations are here in the church  
With smiles on their faces they stare  
As we walk t'ward the man who has stolen your heart  
And to whom I must give you away  
But I wish you love and happiness too  
On this your wedding day  
  
Chorus  
The dance has begun  
We twirl around the floor  
But I know you're not my little girl anymore  
A lovely young woman has taken her place  
And there's happiness written all over her face  
But always remember although we must part  
You may leave my arms but never my heart  
  
Chorus
