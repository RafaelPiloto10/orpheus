She sits quiet  
In the shadow of the sun  
She looks tired  
Her life that's come undone  
She turns, turns, turns, turns  
  
She likes hockey  
And summers by the lake  
We're not talking  
Because of my mistakes  
I burn, burn, burn, burn  
  
[Chorus]  
If you walk out that door  
I just don't know what I'd do  
I'll never get over you  
In my heart  
I just don't know what I'd do  
I'll never get over you  
  
End the silence  
But it's never been so loud  
I try to fight it  
But the words just don't come out  
I burn, burn, burn, burn  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's no hiding  
From your silence  
There's no hiding  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't you go  
Don't you go  
Don't you go  
Don't you go
