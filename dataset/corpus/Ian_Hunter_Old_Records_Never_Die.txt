Sometimes you realize  
That there is an end to life.  
Yesterday I heard them say  
A hero's blown away.  
And it's so hard to lose  
Someone who's close to you.  
Oh me, I did not see  
The danger every day.  
But music's something in the air,  
So he can play it anywhere.  
Old records never die.  
  
Get you're healing from a song,  
Just when everything goes wrong.  
Play it right  
Through the night  
Till morning brings you light.  
And if some folk laugh at you  
Let 'em all laugh they never knew.  
Oh all those scenes, to me it seems  
Some folk never dream.  
??, I feel a force  
Rebel with some other cause.  
Old records never die.  
  
Old records never die.  
You can watch the waves roll by.  
You can see it in their eyes.  
Old records never die.  
Old records never die.  
You can watch the waves roll by.  
??  
Old records never die.  
I can hear you  
And I know why  
Old records never die.
