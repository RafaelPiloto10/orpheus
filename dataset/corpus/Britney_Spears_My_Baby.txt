Tiny hands  
Yes that's you  
And all you show  
It's simply true  
I smell your breath  
It makes me cry  
I wonder how  
I've lived my life  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause without you  
How did I get through  
All of my days  
Without you  
Now living with you  
See everything true  
My baby it's you  
My baby, my baby, my baby  
  
With no words at all  
So tiny and small  
In love I fall so deep, so deep  
My precious love  
Sent from above  
My baby boo  
Gotta thank you, gotta thank you  
  
[Chorus: x2]
