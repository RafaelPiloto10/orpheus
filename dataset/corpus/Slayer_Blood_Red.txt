Peaceful confrontation meet war machine  
Seizing all civil liberties  
Honest ballotation among banshee  
Spilling blood throughout humanity  
You cannot hide the face of death  
Oppression ruled by bloodshed  
No disguise can deface evil  
The massacre of innocent people  
  
Deviated lies fear blinding in your eyes  
Enforcing their truth through a gun  
Aggressive discipline and barbaric control  
Thousands of people cannot be wrong  
  
You cannot hide the face of death  
Oppression rules by bloodshed  
No disguise can hide the evil  
That stains the primitive sickle  
  
Blood red  
  
Growing opposition with words as ammunition  
Expressions of life's liberties  
Aggressive discipline and barbaric control  
Spilling blood throughout humanity
