In the still water she lies down  
Shaking through the press of sunlight  
We rolled into Lexington  
She shakes off the drop of daylight  
Water beading up her chest  
Bleeding down between her knees  
Rivers in Kentucky flow  
Between the bluegrass wavy seas  
But oh, Margery  
Twists the knife once more inside of me  
Breathless with anticipation  
Baited reelers set their hooks  
Tuck their heads beneath the high grass  
And lie and wait beside the brooks  
We're infants pushing slowly through  
Frustration leading back along  
The alleys of a childhood  
That will not release us willingly  
But oh, Margery ..sticks the knife in while I couldn't see (strait into me
baby)  
Dust me off and shut me down  
And dream of where I haven't been  
Close the door inside my heart  
Stuck in the south Atlantic wind  
I have hollow eyes  
Haunting only to myself  
Even so, I can't stop calling  
These great big hollows in myself  
I took the train from California  
To the far side of the continent  
Woke up in Kentucky  
Where a wedding was about to end  
I looked up at Anna  
She turned back to look at me  
It's best to kill the ones that matter  
Render blind the ones who see  
But oh, Margery  
Takes the blade and walks away from me  
Oh, Margery  
Love like blood is pouring out of me  
Oh, Margery  
My heart won't stop bleeding over me baby  
Oh, I can't shut it in  
It's got far too many doors to block the wind  
Oh, I can't shut it in
