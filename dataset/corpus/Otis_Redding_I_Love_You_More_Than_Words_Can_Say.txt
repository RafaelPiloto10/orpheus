Please, let me sit down beside you.  
I've got something to tell you, you should know.  
I just couldn't wait for not another day.  
I love you, for more than words can ever say.  
Honey living without you is so painful.  
I was tempted to call it a day.  
You've got me in your hand, why can't you understand.  
I love you baby, for more than words can say.  
I just can't sleep, when I lay down in my bed.  
The thoughts of you babe, just linger in my head.  
Living without you is so painful. I was tempted to call it a day.  
You've got me in your hand, why can't you understand.  
I love you honey, for more than words can say.  
I love you honey, for more than words can say.  
Yes, I do.
