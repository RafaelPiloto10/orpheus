Understand girl that my heart is in your hands  
And I'm cautious of fallin' in love again  
Please don't hurt me...  
I'm scared  
Don't desert me  
I'm afraid of being a fool again  
  
Chorus  
Baby I'm yours if you want me  
(If you want my love)  
Baby I'm yours if you need me  
Lovin' you forever if you want me  
(Give me your love)  
Baby I'm yours if you need me  
  
Realize girl that my faith is kind of torn  
So watch your step girl  
Because my heart is weak and worn  
So won't you please be careful I'm fragile  
I can't imagine the damage  
I'll have to handle  
If you hurt me one more time  
Please be mine  
  
Chorus  
  
Hey baby I finally found someone  
That I can depend on  
I just want you to know  
That I'm your sweetheart...  
Hey someone that you can depend on...  
Don't you ever go nowhere, baby  
  
Chorus
