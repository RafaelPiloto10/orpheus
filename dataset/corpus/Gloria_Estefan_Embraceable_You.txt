Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you  
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you  
  
Just one look at you  
My heart grew tipsy in me  
You and you alone  
Bring out the Gypsy in me  
  
I love all the many charms about you  
Above all, I want my arms about you  
  
Don't be a naughty baby  
Come to mama, come to mama do  
My sweet embraceable you  
  
I love all the many charms about you  
Above all, I want my arms about you  
  
Don't be a naughty baby  
Come to mama, come to mama do  
My sweet embraceable you
