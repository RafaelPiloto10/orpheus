I thought I knew you baby  
But it seems I don't know, I don't know you at all  
One thing is for sure is you're so bad  
And then again, when you kiss me baby  
You know it's got the taste  
The taste of an eternal life  
I want you to feel the taste of life  
This moment in time  
I hear the call of a siren  
This lady is quite  
Mysterious  
I want your mind to lock in  
If my life were a glass of water  
Filled by the rain from a velvet sky  
I want you to drink  
Because your lips are dry  
This moment in time  
I follow her blind  
This lady is quite  
Mysterious  
I want your mind to lock in  
This time I thought I got you baby  
But you slipped away  
And I thought I'd die  
This moment in time  
I'm losing my mind  
But she remains quite  
Mysterious  
I'm crossing the line  
I will follow her blind  
This lady is quite  
Mysterious  
I want your mind to lock in  
I'm losing my mind  
I hear the call of a siren  
This lady is quite  
Mysterious  
I want your mind to lock in  
You're so bad  
I thought I knew you baby  
But I don't know you at all  
It's got the taste you know it's got the taste  
Of an eternal life
