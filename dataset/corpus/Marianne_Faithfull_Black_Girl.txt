Black girl, black girl, don't you lie to me  
Tell me where did you sleep last night ?  
In the pines, in the pines  
Where the sun never shines  
And I shivered the whole night long.  
Tell me where did you get that pretty little dress  
And those shoes that you wear so fine ?  
I got my dress from a railroad man  
And my shoes from a driver deep in the mine.  
Black girl, black girl, don't lie to me  
Tell me where did you sleep last night ?  
In the pines, in the pines  
Where the sun never shines  
And I shivered the whole night long.
