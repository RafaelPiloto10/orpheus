From here  
No lines are  
Drawn  
From here  
No lands  
Are owned  
Thirteen thousand and holding  
Swallowed  
In the purring  
Of her engines  
Tracking the beacon  
Here  
"Is there a signal  
There  
On the other side"  
On the other side?  
What do you mean  
Side of what things?  
And you said  
And you did  
And you said  
You could find me here  
And you said  
You would find me  
Even in death  
And you said  
And you said  
You'd find me  
But I can't see new York  
As I'm, circling down  
Through white cloud  
Falling out  
And I know  
His lips are warm  
But I can't seem  
To find my way out  
My way out I can't see.  
Of this hunting ground  
From here crystal meth  
In meters of millions  
In the end all we have,  
Soul blueprint.  
Did we get lost in it  
Do we conduct a search  
For this "from the other side"  
From the other side?  
What do they mean  
Side of what things...  
And you said.  
You again  
It's you again  
I can't see  
I can't see New York  
From the other side  
From the other side  
I hum from the other side  
This is the tie that will bind us
