You, me  
Understand  
Shake my hand  
Last chance, little man  
Ain't it grand  
It's a bargain, it's a steal  
30 pieces of silver  
And a deal's a deal  
  
Sign upon the dotted line  
I'll be yours and you'll be mine  
Nothing's free  
Eventually  
Nothing's free  
  
From the rules and laws of morality  
Free to take your fill  
Free from your own free will  
Nothing's free  
  
My boy, it's getting late  
I'll raise the stakes  
So close  
Control your fate, why hesitate  
Seal the deal, close the sale  
Take my hammer, drive the nail  
  
Sign upon the bloody line  
A drop of yours, a drop of mine  
Nothing's free  
Eternally  
Nothing's free  
  
From your conscience or  
Free from the consequence  
Free to sin and death  
Free till your final breath  
Nothing's free  
Free from the claws and flaws of your family  
Free from obedient life  
You're cut like a double-edged knife  
Nothing's free, nothing's free  
Oh, you pay me  
  
Free to ignore the bore of authority  
Free to spit in the face  
Be the winningest rat in the race till Judgement Day  
Then nothing's free  
Bow to me if you want to be free  
Free from life, come die with me  
And when we're dead it's for eternity  
  
Come on little one and dance in the fire  
The heat's getting close  
and the flame's getting higher  
When the music's over there's a hush in the choir  
Nothing's free  
When the trumpets sound  
and his light is all around  
And the saints all raise from the graves  
in the ground  
We'll be going way downtown  
Way downtown
