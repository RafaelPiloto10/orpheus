The earth is shaking under siege  
And every breath we'll meet is fate  
Still we hunger for a moment of freedom  
Even though the hour is late  
I find hope and it gives me rest  
I find hope in a beating chest  
I find hope in what eyes don't see  
I find hope in your hate for me  
Have no fear when the waters rise  
We can conquer this great divide  
When every eye is one the fortune  
It can only breed contempt  
They say blood is thicker than oceans  
Still we box our brothers in  
I find hope and it gives me rest  
I find hope in a beating chest  
I find hope in what eyes don't see  
I find hope in your hate for me  
Have no fear when the waters rise  
We can conquer this great divide  
Whoa, ooo, ooo, ooo ooo  
Whoa, ooo, ooo, ooo ooo  
Whoa, ooo, ooo, ooo ooo  
And we're gone  
And we're gone  
And we're, holding on  
And we're, holding on  
And we're, holding on  
I find hope and it gives me rest  
I find hope in a beating chest  
I find hope in what eyes don't see  
I find hope in your hate for me  
Have no fear when the waters rise  
We can conquer this great divide  
Whoa, ooo, ooo, ooo ooo  
Whoa, ooo, ooo, ooo ooo  
Whoa, ooo, ooo, ooo ooo
