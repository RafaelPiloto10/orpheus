If you want to walk out the door  
You don't need a key  
If you don't want to come by no more  
I'll set you free  
  
Whatever you want babe  
Whatever you need  
Just as long as you know babe  
What you're doin' to me  
What you're doin' to me  
  
If you want to say it's a day  
I won't disagree  
I would never stand in your way  
That wouldn't be me  
  
Whatever you want babe  
Whatever you need  
Just as long as you know babe  
What it's doin' to me  
What it's doin' to me  
  
I would never tie you down  
You've always been free to leave  
If you want to make it goobye  
That's o.k. with me  
Got so tired of asking you why  
I'll just let it be  
  
Whatever you want babe  
Whatever you need  
Just as long as you know babe  
What it's doin' to me  
  
And if I try to find a reason  
For all the things I do  
Would you try to understand , the way I am  
And how I care for you  
Would you give me your undivided attention  
And the benefit of your doubt?  
Ooh!, ooh!
