Lost in your eyes, can't you find  
My intent to leave  
Taken to me, don't you see  
It's time for me to leave  
  
Distance aside, I realize  
How you make me feel  
Just call my name, we live the day  
To find somewhere to heal  
  
I can see far away  
Feeling me forever  
I can see far away  
Looking back, keeping us apart  
  
There's no one who knows me (There's no one who cares)  
There's no one  
I sit and stare (It follows me)  
Wasting all our fears  
  
I can see far away  
Feeling me forever  
I can see far away  
Looking back, keeping us apart  
  
(guitar solo)  
  
Looking to me will get you nowhere, fast  
I hope you see what you have done to me  
Your pain is near, you run again  
I try to save you all your style  
  
I can see far away  
Feeling me forever  
I can see far away  
Looking back, keeping us  
  
I can see far away (I don't know who you are)  
Feeling me forever  
I can see far away (I don't know who you are, anymore)  
Looking back, keeping us apart  
  
Ahhhhhhhhhh.... (I don't know who you are)  
Ahhhhhhhhhh.... (I don't know who you are)
