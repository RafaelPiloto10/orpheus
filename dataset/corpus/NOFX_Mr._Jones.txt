My name is Mr. Jones  
I get inside your bones  
I know how to make you tweak  
You soon will be my freak  
Because I know what you need  
I control your mind  
I roll up your sleeves  
I make ties that bind, I've got you  
You'll soon be begging on your knees  
You've got the disease  
All your money belongs to me  
You've got the disease  
I can't seem to live without you  
Without you what's the point  
I wasn't born with a silver burnt spoon  
Do I still have any choice?  
(No)  
Because I know what you need  
I control your mind  
I roll up your sleeves  
I make ties that bind
