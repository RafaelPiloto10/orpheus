It's only perfection  
You're only running scared  
You just might get there  
You burn it  
Deserve it  
It's got a rope around your neck  
It wants your last breath  
God save you  
Save you  
Save you  
God save you  
Save you  
You're bleeding  
Receding  
Believing every little lie  
You're so tired  
And it's hurting me  
And it's hurting you  
And it burns through  
Every thing you touch  
I miss you so much  
God save you  
Save you  
Save you  
I'm not blaming you  
Blaming you  
Blaming you  
God save you  
Save you  
She's an innocent freak  
She's an innocent freak  
She's an innocent freak  
And I'm bored  
God save you  
Save you  
Save you  
God save you  
Save you  
I'm not blaming you  
Blaming you  
Blaming you  
God save you  
Save you  
Save you  
God help me  
Help you
