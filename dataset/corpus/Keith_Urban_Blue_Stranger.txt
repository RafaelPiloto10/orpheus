Hello blue stranger, sittin' there all alone  
With your glass of sorrow, you seem so far from home  
Maybe you will let me, buy a round or two  
I'm a blue stranger too  
  
Well, hello blue stranger, I haven't seen your around  
But I know every reason, for leavin' town  
We might know each other, before the night is through  
I'm a blue stranger too  
  
And strangers fall in love, all the time  
All lovers were strangers once  
Just like us, a little unsure, chattin' out hi's  
  
Well, hello blue stranger, will you take a chance  
Well I might be mistaken, but I see meaning in your glance  
Maybe this could be the start of something new  
I'm a blue stranger too  
  
And strangers fall in love, everyday  
All lovers were strangers once  
Just like us, a little unsure of our little ways  
  
Well, hello blue stranger, sittin' there all alone  
With your glass of sorrow, you seem so far from home  
Maybe you will let me, buy you a round or two  
I'm a blue stranger too  
  
Hello blue stranger, Hello blue stranger  
Hello blue stranger.
