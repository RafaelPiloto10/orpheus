This girl is easy meat  
I seen her on the street  
See-through blouse an' a tiny little dress  
Her manner indiscreet...i knew she was  
Easy, easy, easy meat  
Easy, easy, easy meat  
Easy, easy, easy, easy  
Easy meat, easy meat, easy meat, easy meat  
She wanna take me home  
Make me sweat and moan  
Rub my head and beat me off  
With a copy of rollin' stone  
Easy, easy, easy meat  
Easy, easy, easy meat  
Easy, easy, easy, easy  
Easy meat, easy meat, easy meat, easy meat  
...they're just not gonna stand for it...  
I told her I was late  
I had another date  
I can't get off on the rollin' stone  
But the robots think it's great...i knew she was  
Easy, easy, easy meat  
Easy, easy, easy meat  
Easy, easy, easy, easy  
Easy meat, easy meat, easy meat, easy meat  
Easy  
She was so easy  
Easy  
Saw her tiny titties  
Through her see-through blouse  
I just had to take the girl to my house  
Easy  
Meat
