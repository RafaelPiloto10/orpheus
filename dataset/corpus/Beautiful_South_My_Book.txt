This is my life and this is how it reads  
For every chapter, a thousand memories  
A murder, a mystery where everybody bleeds  
A fantasy, a thriller with romance and disease  
  
Diary entry 9th of May '62  
We've had some ugly babies but none were quite like you  
Diary entry '62 end of May  
It looks as if the nose and chin are definitely here to stay  
They're here to stay, they're here to stay  
  
If my lips start smiling and my knees start a-knocking  
I'm a failure  
You are, you are  
And if I seem half-hearted, it's because I'm broken hearted  
And I'm a failure  
You are, you are, you are (I am)  
You are, you are, you are (I am)  
  
This is my life and this is how it reads  
A documentary that nobody believes  
Albert Steptoe in 'Gone with the Breeze'  
Mother played by Peter Beardsley, father by John Cleese  
  
Diary entry '68 end of the year  
A cardboard Apollo Six has given the all clear  
11th December '68 Captain's log  
Proposed trip to Mars is cancelled due to fog  
It's due to fog, it's due to fog  
  
If my lips start smiling and my knees start a-knocking  
I'm a failure  
You are, you are  
And if I seem half-hearted, it's because I'm broken hearted  
And I'm a failure  
You are, you are, you are (I am)  
You are, you are, you are (I am)  
  
This is the play, it was I who wrote the script  
Terry meets June in 'Tales from the Crypt'  
It was going to be a film but the camera person slipped  
They later found him scolding a banana  
  
Diary entry tenth of April '89  
The world is going mad but me I'm doing fine  
I'm doing fine  
  
Back to bed, back to reality  
Just fine.
