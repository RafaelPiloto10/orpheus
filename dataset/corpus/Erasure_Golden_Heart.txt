Like a bubble that's floating  
On high above  
I won't break down  
I won't cry  
But the colors are melting  
I am fragile  
  
I've been acting so coldly  
And hope some day  
That you will forgive me  
  
You are the one  
That knows me for who I really am  
It'll all be gone in the morning  
We are lucky  
Owe it all to fortune  
  
Golden heart  
Tears of love  
Shining  
Will glow  
  
There's a light at  
The end of the tunnel  
I am crawling slowly  
I am small  
  
What's been up with me lately?  
Hardly know me  
Who's that in the mirror?  
  
You are the one  
That knows my moods of joy and anger  
You've been coping and lonely  
We are lucky  
Owe it all to fortune  
  
Golden heart  
Tears of love  
Shining  
Will glow  
  
Golden heart  
Tears of love  
Shining  
Will glow  
  
Golden heart  
Tears of love  
Shining  
Will glow
