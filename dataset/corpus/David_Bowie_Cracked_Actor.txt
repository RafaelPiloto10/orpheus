I've come on a few years from my Hollywood Highs  
The best of the last, the cleanest star they ever had  
  
I'm stiff on my legend,  
The films that I made  
Forget that I'm fifty  
'Cause you just got paid  
  
[CHORUS]  
Crack, baby, crack,  
Show me you're real  
Smack, baby, smack, is that all that you feel  
Suck, baby, suck,  
Give me your head  
Before you start professing  
That you're knocking me dead  
  
You caught yourself a trick down  
On Sunset and Vine  
But since he pinned you baby  
You're a porcupine  
  
You sold me illusions for a sack full of checks  
You've made a bad connection 'cause I just want your sex  
  
[CHORUS]
