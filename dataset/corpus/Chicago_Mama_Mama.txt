I can feel the magic  
Suddenly it's all around  
I can see it clearly  
I can even hear the sound  
  
It's all so new to me  
I'm not the same  
If this is love  
Then you're to blame  
  
Mama mama when you look at me  
I see love in your eyes  
Mama mama softly sweet tender love in your eyes  
  
You are all I live for  
Maybe that's enough to say  
And you're the one I wrote this song for  
Everywhere and everyway  
  
It's all so new to me  
I'm not the same  
It's words I feel  
But can't explain  
  
Mama mama when you look at me  
I see love in your eyes  
Mama mama softly sweet tender love in your eyes  
  
Mama mama, mama mama  
I really love you  
I really need you  
Mama mama, mama mama  
I really need you mama  
I really love you mama
