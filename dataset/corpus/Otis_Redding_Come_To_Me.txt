Come to me for I'm lonely  
Come to me for I'm lonely, darling  
Come to me and be my girl  
For I love, love you so  
  
Come to me forget the past  
Think of life we have ahead, my my my my baby  
Come to me and be my girl  
For I love, love, love you so, oh now  
  
Day are getting so lonely, yeah now  
Life are getting so blue  
Time has come for you and I  
To get together and we'll make two, my my my my babe  
  
Come to me for I'm begging  
Come to me for I'm begging, darling  
Come to me and be my girl  
For I love, love, love you so, yeah  
  
Come on now baby  
Baby I'm down  
Said I'm down my knees, oh  
I need me someone, now  
Said I need some love  
Just to stand right by me, oh  
You know that these arms of mine  
They have been lonely  
Lonely so long  
But I know, but I know, I know what my heart needs  
I know just what my heart needs
