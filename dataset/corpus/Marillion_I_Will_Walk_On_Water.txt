Something is coming out of the rain, magic  
It's happening again, like the last time  
I don't know how it happens, but I know what to do  
Coming up from the ground, I think it's you  
I will walk on the water  
  
You sent me the red sun and the purple sky  
Cirrus clouds and grins  
Atoms of roses  
The power to do anything  
In the chaos of colours  
And the fluttering of wings  
You carry me up  
And I'm free again  
  
Don't let anyone tell you  
This is impossible  
What we have here is bigger than fear  
  
I will walk on water  
Don't let anyone tell you  
This is impossible  
Hold on to me  
Believe what you see  
  
I will walk on water
