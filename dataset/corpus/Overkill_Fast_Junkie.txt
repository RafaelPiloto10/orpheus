Lean in,  
Take it right.  
Down one,  
No kissin' concrete.  
I'm awake! I'm awake! I'm awake!  
Too alive! It's comin'..!  
Let it go  
  
My strip,  
My bank,  
My rubber rut steel, my tank.  
I can kill! Too alive! Let it go!  
  
No time for thinking, a full out fast junkie.  
Puchin' the red, Hey!, full out speed monkey.  
  
Head shake!  
  
With thoughts fixed upon the fix, inside the vein...  
With thoughts fixed, not so easily explained.  
  
Let it out!  
Let it go!  
What you do not what you know!  
One more! Fix clean!  
I'm one, I am a machine!!!  
I am a machine!  
  
...No time for thinking a full out fast junkie,  
...Pushin' the red hey! Full out speed monkey.  
I am!  
Head shake!  
  
Wide Fucking Open
