Hey darkness don't you try  
To steal the moment or close my eyes  
I won't let you in  
  
'Cause this feels too damn good to me  
All I want and all I need  
Is her touch again and again and again  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't want to go to sleep tonight  
I don't want anything to change  
I don't want to wake up and find a different day  
Yeah, she makes me free  
Here between the day and the twilight  
I don't want to go to sleep tonight  
  
Time stop dead in your tracks  
Turn around and don't look back  
And just let us be  
  
I'm gonna take this time and soak it up  
Forever wouldn't be long enough  
If you knew her you'd agree, agree with me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I wish the sun would just forget to come up  
And just leave us wrapped up in this love  
  
[Chorus]
