There are places I remember  
All my life, though some have changed  
Some forever, not for better  
Some are gone and some remain  
  
Oh these places had their moments  
With lovers and friends, I still recall  
Some are dead and some are living  
In my life, I've loved them all.  
  
But of all these friends and lovers  
There is no one, compares with you  
And these memories lose their meaning  
When I think of love, as something new  
  
Though I know I'll never lose affection  
For people and things that went before  
I know I'll often stop and think about them  
In my life,  
I've loved you more
