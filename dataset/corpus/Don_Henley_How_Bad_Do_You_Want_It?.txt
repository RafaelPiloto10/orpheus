You're leavin' tongue marks on the carpet  
And I know what you're lookin' at  
You would walk on your lips through busted glass  
If you could get next to that  
  
You think this is love  
Your education starts today  
So you think this is love?  
So tell me  
How bad do you want it?  
How bad do you want it?  
How bad do you want it?  
Not bad enough  
  
So you put a hold on happiness  
... a day, a week, a year  
You got to bring somethin' to this party, boy  
If you party here  
  
And if you're lookin' for love  
You better look some other way  
If you're lookin' for love  
I have to ask you  
How bad do you want it?  
How bad do you want it?  
How bad do you want it?  
Not bad enough  
  
She gave you love and affection  
Enough to weather any season  
You found an excuse to walk away  
But you didn't find no reason  
  
And you talk about love  
But you don't know what it means  
Yeah, you talk about love  
So tell me  
How bad do you want it?  
How bad do you want it?  
How bad do you want it?  
Not bad enough
