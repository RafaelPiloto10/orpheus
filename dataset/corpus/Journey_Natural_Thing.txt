Winter and moonlight  
It's an old-fashioned song  
Julie's in blue jeans  
Now her love has gone  
  
She's an old-fashioned feelin'  
She's an old-fashioned song  
Julie's in love now, but love has gone  
  
It's a natural thing  
It's a natural thing  
  
I never knew her  
I never tried  
Julie would run by  
Cryin', teary-eyed  
  
She was old-fashioned feelin'  
She was old-fashioned song  
Julie's in blue lace  
And love has gone  
Her love has gone  
  
It's a natural thing  
It's a natural thing  
It's a natural thing  
  
Oh, she was old-fashioned feelin'  
She was old-fashioned song, yes Julie  
Now Julie's in blue lace  
And love has gone  
Well, love has gone  
Well, love has gone  
  
It's a natural thing  
  
Julie, Julie
