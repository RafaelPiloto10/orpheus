How am I going to  
Deliver you a mountain size of love  
How do oceans  
Connected by a straw get something through  
  
I might need some time to remember  
Need some time to remember  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey yeah  
It's automatic when you know it  
Hey yeah  
It's automatic when you feel it  
  
When do I lay down  
And get to see the world inside your eyes  
How can I reach out  
And hold on to the joy you've got inside  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Got some  
I wanna feel it every hour  
Cause I wanna get into you  
  
[Chorus]
