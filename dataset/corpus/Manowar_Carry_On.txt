The north star always guides me  
When winter skies are gray  
And I wait for the sun when all are one  
I shall not betray  
Calling at me  
I'm waiting  
When all are led astray  
  
Carry on my sons forever  
Carry on when I am gone  
Carry on when the day is long  
Forever carry on  
For as long as we're together  
Then forever Carry On  
  
Darkness all around us  
We don't close our eyes  
No one's gonna ground us  
We were born to fly  
Comin'at us  
No stopping  
Born to amplify  
  
Carry on my sons forever  
Carry On when I am gone  
Carry On when the day is long  
Forever Carry On  
For as long as we're together  
Then forever Carry On  
  
Yeah, be my brother  
Fight to stay alive  
All the world can't change us  
With all their burned-out jive  
Come get us now we're waiting  
We won't run and hide  
  
Carry on my sons forever  
Carry on when I am gone  
Carry on when the day is long  
Forever carry on  
For as long as we're together  
Then forever carry on  
  
Now we're all together  
Let's sing a fighting song  
One hundred thousand riders  
We can't all be wrong  
Comin' at us no stopping  
Always Carry On  
  
Carry on my sons forever  
Carry on when I am gone  
Carry on when the day is long  
Forever carry on  
For as long as we're together  
Then forever carry on
