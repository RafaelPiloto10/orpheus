You make me  
Think I'm listenin' to a symphony,  
You make me  
Hear the beauty of your poetry!  
You got a good way with music, baby,  
Got a good way with words,  
You got a good way with music, baby,  
Got a good way with words.  
You make me  
Hear the lyric in the harmony,  
You make me  
Hear the chorus in the melody!  
You got a good way with music, baby,  
Got a good way with words,  
You got a good way with music, baby,  
Got a good way with words.  
I see your face,  
And when you walk my way,  
The violins  
Always start to play,  
And when you talk,  
I don't care what you say,  
It comes out I love you so,  
Anyway, you should know  
You make me  
Think I'm listenin' to a symphony,  
You make me  
Hear the beauty of your poetry!  
You got a good way with music, baby,  
Got a good way with words,  
You got a good way with music, baby,  
Got a good way with words.  
You got a good way with music, baby,  
Got a good way with words,  
You got a good way with music, baby,  
Got a good way with words.
