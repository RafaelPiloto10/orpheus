We're walking in the air  
We're floating in the moonlit sky  
The people far below are sleeping as we fly  
  
I'm holding very tight  
I'm riding in the midnight blue  
I'm finding I can fly so high above with you  
  
Far across the world  
The villages go by like dreams  
The rivers and the hills, the forests and the streams  
  
Children gaze open mouthed  
Taken by surprise  
Nobody down below believes their eyes  
  
We're surfing in the air  
We're swimming in the frozen sky  
We're drifting over icy mountains floating by  
  
Suddenly swooping low  
On an ocean deep  
Rousing up a mighty monster from his sleep  
  
And walking in the air  
We're dancing in the midnight sky  
And everyone who sees us greets us as we fly  
  
We're walking in the air  
We're walking in the air
