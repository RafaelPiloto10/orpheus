There's a new sun  
Risin' up angry in the sky  
And there's a new voice  
Sayin' "we're not afraid to die"  
Let the old world make believe  
It's blind and deaf and dumb  
But nothing can change the shape of things to come  
There are changes  
Lyin' ahead in every road  
And there are new thoughts  
Ready and waiting to explode  
When tomorrow is today  
The bells may toll for some  
But nothing can change the shape of things to come  
The future's comin' in, now  
Sweet and strong  
Ain't no-one gonna hold it back for long  
There are new dreams  
Crowdin' out old realities  
There's revolution  
Sweepin' in like a fresh new breeze  
Let the old world make believe  
It's blind and deaf and dumb  
(But) nothing can change the shape of things  
Nothing can change the shape of things  
Nothing can change the shape of things  
Nothing can change the shape of things  
To come
