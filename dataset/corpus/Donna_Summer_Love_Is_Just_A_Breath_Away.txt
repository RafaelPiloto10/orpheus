Deep in the night, when you're  
Away from me  
I'm reachin' out just to touch you  
In my dreams  
Countin' the hours 'till you'll be  
Here again  
So hard to wait, got to have you  
Close to me  
'cause baby  
  
You, turn my nights to day  
When your love, love is just a  
Breath away  
  
Somethin' inside has taken  
Over me  
So baby, can't you see you  
Captured my heart  
I can't disguise the things you  
Make me feel  
I should have known this was  
Magic right from the start  
  
'Cause baby, you turn my nights to day  
When your love, love is just a breath away  
We, we don't have a word to say  
Our hearts can speak a thousand ways  
When love is just a breath away  
  
Take me, take me into paradise  
Show me  
All the love that's in your eyes  
Light up my life  
  
You, you turn my nights to day  
When your love, love is just a breath away  
We, we don't have a word to say  
Our heart can speak a thousand ways  
When love is just a breath away  
You, you turn my nights to day  
When your love, love is just a breath away
