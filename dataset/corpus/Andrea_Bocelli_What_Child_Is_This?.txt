What Child is this who, laid to rest  
  
On Mary's lap, is sleeping?  
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet  
While shepherds watch are keeping?  
This, this is Christ the King,  
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing,  
Haste, haste, to bring Him laud,  
The Babe, the Son of Mary!  
  
Why lies He in such mean estate  
  
Where ox and ass are feeding?  
Good Christian, fear, for sinners here  
The silent Word is pleading.  
Nails, spear shall pierce him through,  
The Cross be borne for me, for you,  
Hail, hail the Word made flesh,  
The Babe, the Son of Mary!  
  
So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh,  
Come peasant, king to own Him.  
The King of kings salvation brings,  
Let loving hearts enthrone Him.  
Raise, raise, the song on high,  
The virgin sings her lullaby,  
Joy, joy, for Christ is born,  
The Babe, the Son of Mary!
