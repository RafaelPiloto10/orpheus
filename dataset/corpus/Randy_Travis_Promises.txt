Cheap perfume and painted faces  
Fallen angles fill the places  
Where I go when my troubles pull me down  
All the lies I know they'll tell me  
And the time that they will sell me  
For a while I'll be the biggest man in town  
Back at home in bed she's crying  
For her love for me is dying  
But she'll pry I make it safely through the night  
When the mornin' sun starts showing  
To her bedside I'll be going  
And she'll hold me while I face the morning light  
  
And I'll make promises  
Promises to change  
I'll make her promises swear I'll rearrange  
And I'll start giving all the love she needs  
If only she will stay  
Once again she'll reassure me and  
I believe her love will cure me  
And I'll fall asleep with tears on my face  
Lord I know she's just a woman  
And her love can't last forever  
And someday soon I know she'll  
Leave without a trace  
For broken' promises  
Will tear her dreams apart  
Just token promises will someday break her heart  
And for the last time she'll hold me when I cry  
And while I'm sleeping  
She'll quietly say goodbye
