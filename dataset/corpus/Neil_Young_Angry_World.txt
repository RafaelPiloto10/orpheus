Some see life as a broken promise  
Some see life as an endless fight  
They think they live in the age of darkness  
They think they live in the age of light  
  
It's an angry world  
And everything is gonna be all right  
Yeah, it's an angry world  
Yeah, it's an angry world  
  
Some see life as hope eternal  
Some see life as a business plan  
Some wish some will go to hell's inferno  
For screwing with their life in Freedom Land  
  
It's an angry world  
For the business man and the fisherman  
It's an angry world  
And no doubt everything will go as planned  
Yeah, it's an angry world  
Yeah, it's an angry world
