Bittersweet, you're gonna be the death of me  
I don't want you, but I need you,  
I love you and I hate you at the very same time  
  
See what I want so much, should never hurt this bad  
Never did this before, that's what the virgin said  
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says  
God talk to me now this is an emergency  
  
And she claim she only with me for the currency,  
You cut me deep bitch cut me like surgery  
  
And I was to proud to admit that it was hurtin me  
I'd never do that to you at least purposely  
  
We breakin up again we makin up again  
But we don't love no more  
I guess we fuckin then  
  
Have you ever felt like you wanted to kill her  
And you mixed them emotions with tequilla  
  
And you mixed that with a little bad advice  
On one of them bad nights  
You have a bad fight  
  
And you talkin bout her family her aunts and shit  
And she sayin muhfucka yo mama's a bitch  
You know domestic drama and shit  
  
All the attitude  
Ill never hit a girl but I'll shake the shit out of you  
  
But I'm a be the bigger man  
Big pimpin like jigga man  
Oh I figure it's  
  
Bittersweet, you're gonna be the death of me  
I don't want you, but I need you,  
I love you and I hate you at the very same time  
  
See what I want so much, should never hurt this bad  
Never did this before, that's what the virgin said  
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says  
God talk to me now this is an emergency  
  
And my nigga says I shouldn't let her worry me  
I need to focus on the girls we gettin currently  
But I've been thinking and it got me back to sinking it  
This relationship, it even got me back to drinking now  
  
This Hennessey, is gon be the death of me  
  
And I always thought that you havin my child was our destiny  
But I can't even vibe wit you sexually  
Cause every time that I try you will question me  
Say "you fuckin them girls, disrespecting me?  
You don't see how your lies are affecting me?  
You don't see how our life was supposed to be?  
And I never let a nigga get that close to me!  
And you ain't cracked up to what you was supposed to be!  
You always gone! You always be where them hoes would be! "  
And it's the first time she ever spilled her soul to me!  
I fucked up and I know it G  
I guess it's bittersweet poetry
