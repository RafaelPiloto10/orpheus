So it's over  
He's with someone else and you know her  
And you just can get any lower  
You sit in the dark alone  
And won't answer your phone  
Well I'm sorry. I want to attend your pity party  
I rather go have calamari  
And maybe a drink  
And yes I think  
You should come with me  
  
Life is long  
There will be pain but life goes on  
With everyday a brand new song  
But if you rather stay at home  
Let me do you a favor  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll ask the sun to shine away from you today so you can cry  
(If that's what you want)  
I'll ask the clouds to bring the rain for you today so you can cry  
(If that's what you want alright)  
Oh If that's what you want alright  
  
I'ma Lover  
And the pain of a heart from another  
Can be difficult to recover  
Yes this I know  
But difficult isn't impossible  
And you shiver (Shiver)  
He was your warmth  
You Cry Lips Quiver  
Well honey go on cry me a river  
You wanna be down (you wanna be down)  
Fine let me help you out  
How bout  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And your tears won't bring him back  
I know you wish that it did  
But it just don't work like that  
Oh I know that healings takes time  
Hey even your heart has a pace  
Oh but how much time are you gonna take  
Hmm too much will be a mistake  
  
[Chorus]
