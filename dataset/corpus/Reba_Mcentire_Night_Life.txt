When the evenin'  
Sun goes down  
You can find me  
Hangin' around  
Oh the night life  
Ain't no good life  
But it's my life  
  
Many people  
Just like me  
Dreaming of  
Old used to be's  
Oh the night life  
It ain't no good life  
But it's my life  
  
Oh listen to the blues they're playin'  
Oh listen to what the blues are sayin'  
  
Mine is just  
Another scheme  
In a world  
Of broken dreams  
Oh the night life  
It ain't no good life  
But it's my life  
  
(Play me some blues boys)  
Oh listen to the blues they're playin'  
Oh listen to what the blues are sayin'  
  
When the evenin'  
Sun goes down  
You can find me  
Hangin' around  
Oh the night life  
It ain't no good life  
But it's my life  
  
The night life  
Ain't no good life  
But it's my life
