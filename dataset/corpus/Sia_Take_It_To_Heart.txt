"Take It To Heart"  
  
People are talking, well that's nothing new  
And some things will never change  
Stories are turning away from the truth  
But people will stay the same  
  
It's only natural that we go on  
To meet with the days that will come  
It's only natural that we all carried forward  
So step on, go on  
Get rising like the morning sun  
  
There's no need to take it to heart  
There's no need to take it to heart  
Only the truth can tear you apart  
There's no need to take it to heart  
  
People are talking, well that's nothing new  
And some things will never change  
Stories are turning away from the truth  
But people will stay the same  
  
We'll stand tall and make 'em dream  
And don't let it get you down  
Make 'em all feel [?]  
But for you I will stand my ground  
  
There's no need to take it to heart  
There's no need to take it to heart  
Only the truth can tear you apart  
There's no need to take it to heart  
  
There's no need to take it to heart  
There's no need to take it to heart  
Only the truth can tear you apart  
There's no need to take it to heart  
  
People are talking, well that's nothing new  
And some things will never change  
Stories are turning away from the truth  
But people will stay the same
