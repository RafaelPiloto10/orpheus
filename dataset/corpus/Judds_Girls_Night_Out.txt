Friday finally came around  
This girl's ready to paint the town  
Tonight ain't nothin' gonna slow me down  
  
I did my time workin' all week  
Tonight's all mine, tomorrow I'll sleep  
I want to hear a band with a country sound  
  
Well, I've been couped up all week long  
I've been workin' my fingers to the bone  
  
[Chorus]  
Well, it's a girl's night out  
Honey, there ain't no doubt  
I'm gonna dance every dance 'til the boys go home  
Well, it's my night to rock  
No watchin' that ol' clock  
Oh, ain't no doubt, Lordy it's a girl's night out  
  
Two step or the Cotton Eye Joe  
They can play 'em fast or they can play 'em slow  
I can do 'em all just show me the floor  
You can give me a little rock 'n roll  
Or even a waltz with the lights down low  
I'll still be dancin' when they close the door  
  
[Chorus]
