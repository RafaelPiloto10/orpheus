Is the magic still there whenever I hold you?  
Do these lips of mine send chills down your spine  
Like they used to?  
Or is it slipping away? Baby, come out and say  
I'm asking because I care  
I just need to know is the magic still there  
Oh I still recall our first time together  
Oh we kissed and we touched, we couldn't get enough of each other  
And when we said goodnight beneath that old porch light  
It left us wanting more  
But I'm wondering now if time has somehow  
Changed what we felt before  
Is the magic still there whenever I hold you?  
Do these lips of mine send chills down your spine  
Like they used to?  
Or is it slipping away? Baby come out and say  
I'm asking because I care  
I just need to know is the magic still there  
Am I still the one that you daydream of?  
When we turn out the light, is there fire in the night  
When we make love?  
Don't want to take you for granted so baby I'm askin'  
Only because I care  
I just want to know  
Is the magic still there whenever I hold you?  
Do these lips of mine send chills down your spine  
Like they used to?  
Or is it slipping away? Baby come out and say  
I'm asking because I care  
I just need to know is the magic still there  
Is the magic still there, is the magic still there?
