I've been your lover for too many years,  
I'm through with wastin' my time  
You been out runnin' without any fear,  
Tell me why, I wanna know the reason why  
  
[It's easy as it seems] 'Cause it's easy as it seems  
  
I keep on hearin' your road never bends, you ain't committin' no crime  
I hear you're sleepin' with one of my friends, tell me why  
I wanna know the reason why  
  
It's easy as it seems] 'Cause it's easy as it seems  
When you're walkin' out on your dreams, you just walk away  
  
I played your boyfriend for too many years, you know it's drivin' me wild  
I've seen you cryin' without any tears, like a child  
You wonder all the reasons why  
  
[It's easy as it seems] And it's easy as it seems  
When you're walkin' out on your dreams, you just walk away  
  
If it takes forever, I don't mind, if it takes forever, I've got time  
All that I wanna know, can you lay it on the line  
Cause if it takes forever, you know I'm gonna find out  
  
[It's easy as it seems] Yeah it's easy as it seems  
When you're walkin' out on your dreams, you just walk away, walk away  
  
[It's easy as it seems] Oh it's easy [easy], easy as it seems  
Yeah it's easy [easy], oh it's easy as it seems  
Oh it's easy [easy], oh it's easy as it seems  
Yeah it's easy [easy], easy as it seems...  
[It's easy as it seems] Oh it's easy [easy], easy as it seems  
Yeah it's easy [easy], oh it's easy as it seems  
Oh it's easy [easy], oh it's easy as it seems  
Yeah it's easy [easy], easy as it seems...
