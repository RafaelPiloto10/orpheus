I am searching  
I am not alone  
I am searching  
Please give me some  
  
Have we lost direction  
Washed our hands of blood  
I'm in need of sensation  
Is there more to this love  
Saw a mother screaming  
She had lost control  
Of what she once believed in  
And she was not alone  
Oh yeah  
If you could face the pain  
And I could do the same  
It would be clear tomorrow  
But will it start  
But will it start again  
  
I am searching  
I am not alone  
I am searching  
Please show me some
