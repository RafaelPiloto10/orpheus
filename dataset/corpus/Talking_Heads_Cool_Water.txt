Day by day  
Whistle while you work  
Our backs are breaking  
Up from hollow earth  
From end to end  
The noise begins  
In the human battle stations  
And the big one's coming in  
  
Work, work, work, work  
Work till holes are filled  
Work, work, work, work  
Bags of bone and skin  
Lovers hold hands  
Tossing their heads  
Tangled in hair  
Tied to earth  
With skin and glue  
  
But their skin is the same as yours  
Coming in for the world to see  
They can sit at the table, too  
The same blood as you and me  
  
Speak very softly  
Hold my hand  
Someone is sleeping in my bed  
Priests pass by  
Worms crawl in  
One dreams to be  
One dream for all  
His skin is the same as yours  
Is he not made the same as you?  
And some have fallen down  
And blood spilled on the ground  
  
Work, work,work  
Till his life is done  
The old man is at our door  
And he's knocking...knocking  
As his neighbors weep  
Each day repeats  
Are we nothing in your eyes?  
Someone answer, someone answer  
This rusted garden gate  
Can barely even stand  
Their work is over now  
And rest will be at hand  
  
Is their skin not the same as yours?  
Can they sit at the table to drink  
Cool water  
Cool water  
And his lungs are filled with rain...  
And the water's rushing in...
