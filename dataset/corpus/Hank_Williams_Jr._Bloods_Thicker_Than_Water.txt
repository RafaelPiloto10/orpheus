Death bells are ringing in Wichita town  
Two brothers will meet when the sun's going down  
Blood's thicker than water poor mother cry  
Which son will live which son will die  
  
Jimmy Laredo a man with a dream  
Sent his young brother Johnny to old Abilene  
To bring back his true love by name  
Katy Lee the girl he attended his bride to be  
  
The trip was along when they both came to know  
That sometimes from friendship a sweet love would grow  
He's bringing her back in a new weddin' gown  
And there'll be a show down in Wichita town  
  
Jimmy's not worried his six gun's tied down  
And no one outdraws him in Wichita town  
But can he do it can he kill his kin  
Blood's thicker than water his, ma, cries again  
  
The stage made it stop at the Last Chance Saloon  
The crowd all stepped back to give both brothers room  
Young Johnny stepped down there was fear in his eyes  
But for lover pity he'd gladly die  
  
They still tell the story to this very day  
How their, ma, jumped between them when Jim made it play  
She cried out in anguish oh sons are you blind  
If you must take a life oh Lord let it be mine  
  
Death bells are ringing in Wichita town  
They mourn for a mother whose son's shot her down  
And there in the Wichita's street where she lay  
Blood's thicker than water her smile seemed to say
