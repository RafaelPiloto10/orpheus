You've been lyin'  
I've been cryin'  
You've been messin'  
I've been guessin' 'bout you  
You've been cheatin'  
I've been creepin' around  
You've been leavin'  
I'll be grievin', I'm grievin'  
  
But I'm still in love with you  
And no matter what you do  
Cause you know that in the end  
I'll come runnin' back again  
  
I've been drinkin'  
Got me thinkin'  
You've been tellin'  
I've been yellin' at you  
You've been stretchin'  
I've been fetchin' you back  
You've been tastin'  
  
But I'm still in love  
  
You've been sighin'  
And goodbyin'  
Never knowin'  
Where you're been choosin'  
I've been losin' you  
You're my lover  
But I discovered the truth  
  
But I'm still in love  
  
Got me dancin' on a string  
Like I just don't mean a thing  
Cause you know that in the end  
I'll come runnin' back again
