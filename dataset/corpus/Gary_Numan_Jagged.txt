They say I'm unforgiven and I have to pay  
Like I'm the demon resurrection  
They say that I turn innocence to panic  
But I don't care  
  
They say that my obsession is unholy  
That I deviate from reason  
They say I make you suffer for my sins  
I hope you forgive me  
  
Do you want it? [Repeat: x1]  
My desire  
  
I sink to my knees  
Head in my hands  
So now I'm just a shadow on their bleeding hearts  
This is why the righteous never learn  
I'm like a dead man hiding in the dark  
  
What do you need? [Repeat: x1]  
  
What have we become?  
All that we could be?  
Think of this as mercy, a small gift from me  
What does a confession ever do  
But take my guilt away  
  
Do you want it?  
Do you want it?  
My desire  
  
I Feel It Fall  
I Feel It Fall From Me  
I Feel It Fall Down  
I Feel It Fall For You  
  
What do you need?  
What do you need?
