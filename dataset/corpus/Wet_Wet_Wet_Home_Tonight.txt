If this is paradise  
Then I don't recognize  
That subtle look that's in your eyes  
And in the distance now  
I hear your whispers, love  
And see my dreams go fading by, by  
  
Take me away  
From this moment  
  
I wanna shut the door  
I'm not taking anymore  
It's me they want to give away  
  
And I don't want to know  
And I don't want to go  
All I want is home tonight  
All I want is home tonight  
  
A love so precious now,  
Lights me up inside  
My darkest night could never hide  
Elegant and divine  
She wears a diamond smile  
The girl's perfection guaranteed  
  
Don't take away  
This moment from me  
  
I wanna hold her close  
It's her I want the most  
Don't want to let her slip away.  
  
And I don't want to know  
And I don't want to go  
All I want is home tonight  
All I want is home tonight  
All I want is home  
Tonight  
  
And I don't want to know  
And I don't want to go  
And I don't want to know
