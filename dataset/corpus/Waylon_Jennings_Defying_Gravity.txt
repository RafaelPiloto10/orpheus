I live on a big blue ball  
I never do dream I would fall  
But even the day that I do  
I'll jump off and smile back at you  
  
We don't even know where we are  
But they say that we're circling a star  
Well, I'll take their word, I don't know  
But I'm dizzy so maybe that's so.  
  
I'm riding a big blue ball  
And never do dream I would fall  
But even the high may lay low  
So when I do fall I'll be glad to go.
