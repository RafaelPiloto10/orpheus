My dad talks a lot about cowboys  
Like John Wayne and people I don't even know  
I like the cartoons on Saturday morning  
'Cause I'm only four years old.  
  
But my dad just loves cowboy movies  
He even bought me a big cowboy hat  
And when I put it on with my boots and my Levi's  
I can tell that he really likes that.  
  
I love to watch Nickelodeon  
You might say I grew up on Sesame street  
My favorites are Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch  
And I think the muppets are neat.  
  
But my dad just loves cowboy movies  
He's never heard of Ernie and Burt  
I'm just not a cowboy I guess I'm a cowboy  
And I sure hope his feeling's aren't hurt.
