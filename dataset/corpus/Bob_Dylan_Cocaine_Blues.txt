Every time my baby and me we go up town  
Police come and they knock me down  
Cocaine all around my brain  
Hey baby, better come here quick.  
  
This old cocaine is 'bout to make me sick.  
Cocaine all around my brain.  
Yonder comes by baby, she's dressed in red  
She's got a shot-gun, says she's gonna kill me dead.  
  
Cocaine all around my brain  
Hey baby, better come here quick.  
This old cocaine about to make me sick.  
Cocaine all around my brain.  
  
Hey baby, better come here quick  
This old cocaine 'bout to make me sick  
Cocaine all around my brain.  
Early one morning, half past four  
  
Cocaine came knockin' on my door.  
Cocaine all around my brain  
Hey baby, you better come here quick.  
This old cocaine is making me sick.  
  
Cocaine all around my brain.  
Cocaine's for horses and it's not for men  
Doctor said it kill you, but he don't say when.  
Cocaine all around my brain.  
  
Hey baby, you better come here quick.  
This old cocaine about to make me sick.  
Cocaine all around my brain.
