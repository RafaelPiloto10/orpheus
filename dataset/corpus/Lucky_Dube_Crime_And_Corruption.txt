Is it the bodyguards around you  
Is it the high walls where you live  
Or is it the men with the guns around you  
Twenty four hours a day  
That make you ignore the crying of the people  
Farmers get killed everyday  
And you say it is not that bad  
Policemen get killed everyday  
And you say it is not that bad  
Maybe if you see it through the eyes  
Of the victims  
You will join us and fight this  
  
[Chorus:]  
Crime and corruption  
  
Do you ever worry  
About your house being broken into  
Do you ever worry  
About your car being taken away from you  
In broad daylight  
Down highway 54  
Do you ever worry  
About your wife becoming  
The woman in black  
Do you ever worry  
About leaving home and  
Coming back in a coffin  
With a bullet through your head  
So join us and fight this  
  
[Chorus:]  
Crime and corruption
