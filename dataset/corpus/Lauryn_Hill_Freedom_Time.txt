Everybody knows that they guilty  
Everybody knows that they've lied  
Everybody knows that they guilty  
Resting on their conscience eating their inside  
It's freedom, said it's freedom time now  
It's freedom, said it's freedom time now  
Time to get free, or give yourselves up now  
It's freedom, said it's freedom time  
[Rapping]  
Yo, there's a war in the mind, over territory  
For the dominion  
Who will dominate the opinion  
Skisms and isms, keepin' us in forms of religion  
Conformin' our vision  
To the world church of decision  
Trapped in a section  
Submitted to committing election  
Moral infection  
Epidemic lies and deception  
Insurrection  
Of the highest possible order  
Destortin' our tape recorders  
From hearin' like under water  
Beyond the borders  
Find the sin in disorder  
Bound by the strategy  
A systematic deprivaty  
Heavy as gravity  
Head first in the cavity  
Without a bottom  
A fate, worse than Sodom  
What's got 'em, drunk off the spirits  
Truth comes, we can't hear it  
When you've been, programmed to fear it  
I had a vision I was fallin' in indescision  
Apallin', callin' religious  
Some program on television  
How can, dominant wisdom  
Be recognized in the system  
Of Anti-Christ, the majority rules  
Intelligent fools  
PhD's in illusion  
Masters of massconfusion  
Bachelors in past illusion  
Now who you choosin'  
The head, the tail  
The bloodshed of male  
Or confidence in the tale  
Conference is in Yale  
Discussin' doctrines of bail  
Causin' people to fail  
Keepin' the third in jail  
His word is nail  
Everything to the tree  
Severing all of me  
From all that I used to be  
Formless and void  
Totally paranoid  
Enjoy darkness as Lord  
Keepin' me from the sword  
Block for mercy  
Bitter than cerasee  
Hungry and thirsty  
For good meat we would eat  
And still, dined at the table of deceit  
How incomplete  
From confrontation to retreat  
We belong, the true enemies defeat  
Destitute a necessity  
Causin' desperation to get the best of me  
Punishment 'til there was nothing left of me  
Realizin' the inescapable death of me  
No options in the valley of decision  
The only doctrine, supernatural circumcision  
Inwardly, only water can purge the heart  
From words to fiery darts  
Thrown by the workers of the arts  
Iniquity, shapen in  
There's no escapin' when  
Your whole philosophy is paper thin  
In vanity  
The wide road is insanity  
Could it be all of humanity  
Picture that  
Scripture that  
The origin of a man's heart is black  
How can we show up for  
An invisible war  
Preoccupied with a shadow, makin' love with a whore  
Achin' in sores  
Babylon, the great mystery  
Mother of human history  
System of social sorcery  
Our present condition  
Needs serious recognition  
Where there's no repentance there can be no remission  
And that sentence, more serious than Vietnam  
The atom bomb is Saddam and Minister Farakkkhan  
What's goin' on, what's the priority to you  
What authority do we do  
When the majority hasn't a clue  
We majored in curses  
Search the chapters, check the verses  
Recapture the land  
Remove the mark from off of our hands  
So we can stand  
In agreement with his command  
Everything else is damned  
Let them with ears understand  
Everything else is damned, let them with ears understand  
It's freedom, said it's freedom time now  
It's freedom, said it's freedom time now  
It's freedom, I'ma be who I am  
It's freedom time, said it's freedom time  
Everybody knows that they've lied  
Everybody knows that they've perpetrated inside  
Everybody knows that they guilty, yes  
Resting on their conscience eating their insides  
Get free, be who you're suppost to be  
Freedom, said it's freedom time now  
Freedom, said it's freedom time  
Freedom, freedom time now
