Sometimes it's hard to see,  
Sometimes it's hard to get through to me,  
But i want to do all that you ask me to.  
Help me to follow through,  
Make every day a devotion to you,  
Cause it's dust to dust, until we learn how to trust.  
  
Sometimes i wander away,  
And i'm lost in the dark, my faith starts to sway  
I don't know what to do, so i cry out to you.  
And i reach out in the air,  
And i call out your name and you're always there,  
Then you send down your light,  
Then you tell me, walk by faith not by sight,  
And then you come shining down.  
  
I'm putting your armor on,  
Finding myself so suddenly drawn,  
Like a moth a flame, whenever you call my name.  
Help me to follow through,  
Make every day a devotion to you,  
Cause it's dust to dust, until we learn how to trust.

Sometimes it's hard to see,  
You know, sometimes it's hard to get through to me,  
Sometimes it's hard to see,  
You know, sometimes it's hard to get through to me,  
But it's dust to dust until we learn how to trust.  
Until we learn how to trust
