Cut her into little pieces  
Move her round the plate  
Knife and Fork, I'll dream you're all talk  
I'm kissing my disgrace  
Kissing my disgrace  
Older fragments with no meaning  
Cloaked her smiling face  
Today I eat myself a breakfast  
I'm kissing my Disgrace  
Cut her into little pieces  
Move her round the plate  
Knife and Fork, I'll dream you're all talk  
I'm kissing my disgrace  
Kissing my disgrace (repeated)
