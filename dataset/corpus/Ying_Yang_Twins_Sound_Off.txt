Niggas crossed standin all in line  
The club packed every muthafucken time  
Fly hoes looking alike darnit  
Rich thugs takin over V.I.P parkin  
Say you came to hang, well i bet  
4, or 5 crooks are here, we brang sweat  
Smokin till you caint get no higher  
If the twins in your city its gonna be an all nighter  
Lucky women out there lemme hear you say  
Do that there, do that there, where you at  
In the back of the club, in the front of the stage  
Gettin krunk with a nigga, say this song hit a nigga  
I keepin shit simple like a.b.c  
We can muthafucken teach you goddamned birds and bees  
If you's a virgin, you need to stay away from me  
Ill pimp this straight hoe till you straight up leave  
  
(Chorus)  
ONE, TWO, you know what to do  
ONE, TWO, you know what to do

Where my thugs at  
Sippin more yak  
Cumin in the car  
Standin by the bar  
See every time ying yang catch a vibe  
They say we too hype, beg us too be quiet  
Thats all good if we was in a church  
But niggas be throwin bows, and hoes that love to twurk  
One more time, Hoot, Aim, Shoot  
Lemme jump off in  
If i said it i ment it, Im here to represent it  
Love big booty bitches, love feelin on some titties  
If you think this shits explicit  
Dont let your kids hear it  
Bitch pop that pussy, and shake that ass  
Last call for alchohol, save me the last dance  
Got my dick hard doin that freaky shit  
Best belive this the bitch that im leavin with  
  
(Chorus)  
ONE, TWO, you know what to do

Step out in a polo air tight  
Smoke a blunt, cant you hear em, my heads right  
If your cunt creams more let my nuts hang  
Represent in the crib, and the friggin cain  
Niggas say oops shorty what they in for  
Gone drank all day, make the liquor store

Low blow but an O thats a no no  
Ying Yang got ya krunk sit down and ready  
So dont get up on the bitch till i back that ass up
