Lady you can trust my heart, you know  
I know that the love survive  
Love is all what matters girl  
Love is all what matters  
I'll never understand it's hard, I know  
Oh god, why she lost her life  
Love is all what matters girl  
Love is all what matters  
Down on my knees I pray for you, baby, baby  
Oh girl no matters what I do  
  
[Chorus]  
Send me a letter from heaven, send me a letter from heaven  
Do you wait for me my girl, oh oh  
Send me a letter from heaven, a little letter from heaven  
Wait 'til I will leave this world  
Oh now and forever I'll swear your love is all what matters  
Soon we're together, I know girl, love is all what matters  
  
Every night I see your smile, I swear  
Heaven just comes down to me  
Love is all what matters, love is all what matters  
Baby can't you wait a while, please dare  
And we have eternity, love is all what matters girl, love is all what matters  
Oh will you send a message to me, baby, baby  
I know it means eternity
