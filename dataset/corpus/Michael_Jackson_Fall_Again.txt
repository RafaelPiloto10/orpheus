Feels like a fire that burns in my heart  
Every single moment that we spend apart  
I need you around for every day to start  
I haven't left you alone  
  
Something about you, starin' in your eyes  
And everything I'm looking for I seem to find  
All this time away is killing me inside  
I need your love in my life  
  
I wanna spend time till it ends  
I wanna fall with you again  
Like we did when we first met  
I wanna fall with you again  
  
We fought in a battle, nobody won  
now we face A mountain to be overcome  
You can't run away, the past is said and done  
I need us to carry on  
  
I wanna spend time till it ends  
I wanna fall with you again  
Like we did when we first met  
I wanna fall with you again  
  
You'll try everything  
You never thought would work before  
When you live, when you love, and you give them your all  
You can always give up some more  
  
Baby nothing means anything  
Unless you're here to share with me  
I can breathe, I can bleed, I can die in my sleep  
Cause you're always there in my dreams  
  
I wanna spend time till it ends  
I wanna fall with you again  
Like we did when we first met  
I wanna fall with you again  
  
I wanna spend time till it ends  
I wanna fall with you again  
Like we did when we first met  
I wanna fall with you again
