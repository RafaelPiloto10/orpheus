Well this feeling that you're feeling  
Is something I know you've felt before  
When I see you I want to hold you  
'Til the end of time and a little bit more  
  
And I'm not gonna let it go  
You've got to let your feelings show  
  
So smile, give me all your heart and we'll never be apart  
I'll never leave you lonely  
If you'll just smile, tell me that you care  
And I'll always be there  
I'll never leave you hurting if you just smile  
  
Well this feeling I've been feeling  
Well I can feel it right now from my head to the floor  
When I see you I want to love you  
'Til the end of time and a little bit more  
  
And I'm not gonna let it go  
You've got to let your feelings show  
So smile, give me all your heart and we'll never be apart  
I'll never leave you lonely  
If you'll just smile, tell me that you care  
And I'll always be there  
I'll never leave you hurting if you just smile  
  
I got my joy all broken into  
But if anyone can heal me baby it's you  
Won't you come and hold my hand  
This world has taken me as far as it can without your  
  
Smile, give me all your heart and we'll never be apart  
I'll never leave you lonely  
If you'll just smile, tell me that you care  
And I'll always be there  
I'll never leave you hurting if you just smile  
If you'll just smile, if you'll just smile
