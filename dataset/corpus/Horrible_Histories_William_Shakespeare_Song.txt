My name is Shakespeare, William  
I owned a feather quill, I am  
The writer most familiar to you  
  
My way with words amazes me  
Came up with so many phrases me  
That still the number dazes me too  
  
Oh, "You've got the be cruel to be kind"  
"If truth were known", "Love is blind"  
Yet each of these quotes you will find  
It's what I do  
  
"Seen better days" (That's one of his)  
Ah, "Salad days" (He is the biz)  
"All the world's a stage"  
They call me Billy Whizz  
  
May seem kind of scary  
I'm a walking dictionary  
Sturdy with the wordy Shakespeare  
  
"Quality of mercy is not strained"  
"Such stuff as dreams are made"  
"Off with his head"  
My phrases you'll note  
  
"This is the short and long of it"  
"Brevity is the soul of wit"  
"As good luck would have have it"  
You can quote  
  
Oh you suffered "Green-eyed jealousy"  
Please do not "Stand on ceremony"  
I wrote "The Queen's English"  
Queen's English I wrote  
  
"It's Greek to me" (That's a Shakespeare line)  
"Meal and drink to me" (He was the first to combine)  
"Infinite variety"  
Yeah, that was one of mine  
  
Don't call me flakey  
I'm William Shakey  
Not lazy with the phrasey  
Shakespeare  
  
I was the greatest, I was ace  
To find a better writer, that's "A wild goose chase"  
I was truly brilliant which is why I sing  
"You can't have too much of a good thing"  
  
"If music be the food of love, play on"  
  
"Et tu, Brute" (Did you ever know?)  
"Forever and a day" (From a Shakespeare show)  
"Good riddance", "Fair play"  
"Pure as the driven snow"  
  
"High time", "Lie low"  
"Wherefore art thou Romeo"  
The nation's favourite bard  
Shakespeare  
  
Dooby, dooby, dooby  
"To be or not to be"  
Schooby, dooby, dooby  
Shakespeare
