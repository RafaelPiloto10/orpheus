Well, I opened my heart, and I let you in  
I promised I'd never love again  
And still doin' what I'd said I'd do  
Someday I might get over you  
  
I wear my ring on a chain now, still on my hand  
And I deal with your memories the best I can  
I've even been out on a date or two  
Someday I might get over you  
  
Oh, I never thought I'd see it  
But I think I see the light now  
I know that what I have to do  
Is get on with my life, but I can't take another day  
I can't face another night, so I just take another breath  
And let it go  
  
If I could ever feel the way I felt  
I'll take a chance with someone else  
And if my heart takes chances too  
Someday I might get over you  
  
Oh, I never thought I'd see it  
But I think I see the light now  
I know that what I have to do  
Is get on with my life, but I can't take another day  
I can't face another night, so I just take another breath  
And let it go  
  
Well, I opened my heart, and I let you in  
I promised I'd never love again  
Right now it's still somethin' I can't do  
Someday I might get over you  
  
Thought it may not be til my life is through  
Someday I might get over you
