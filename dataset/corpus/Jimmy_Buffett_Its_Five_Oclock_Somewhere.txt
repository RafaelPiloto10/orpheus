[Alan Jackson]  
The sun is hot and that old clock is movin' slow and so am I  
Work day passes like molasses in winter time, but it's July.  
Getting paid by the hour and older by the minute.  
My boss just pushed me over the limit.  
I could call him something, think I'll just call it a day.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Pour me something tall and strong  
Make it a hurricane before I go insane  
It's only half past twelve  
But I don't care it's five o'clock somewhere  
  
[Alan Jackson]  
This lunch break is gonna take all afternoon, half the night  
Tomorrow morning I know there'll be h-e-l-l to pay  
But hey that's all right  
I ain't had a day off now, in over a year  
My Jamaican vacation's gonna start right here  
If the phone's for me you can tell them I just sailed away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Alan Jackson]  
I could pay off my tab, pour myself  
In a cab and be back to work before two.  
At a moment like this, I can't help  
But wonder what would Jimmy Buffett do.  
  
[Jimmy Buffett]  
Funny you should ask Alan, I'd say  
Pour me something tall and strong  
Make it a hurricane before I go insane  
It's only half past twelve but I don't care.  
  
[Chorus - Both Sing]  
  
[Alan]  
But he don't care, I don't care.  
  
[Jimmy]  
It's five o'clock somewhere.  
  
[Dialog]  
Jimmy: What time zone am I on? What country am I in?  
Alan: It doesn't matter, it's five o'clock somewhere.  
Jimmy: It's always on time for Margarita ville. Come to think of it.  
Alan: I heard that.  
Jimmy: You've been there haven't ya?  
Alan: Yes sir!  
Jimmy: I've seen your boat there.  
Alan: I've been to Margarita ville a few times.  
Jimmy: Alright, that's good.  
Alan: Stumbled on my way back.  
Jimmy: Okay, well I just want to make sure you keep it between the
navigational beacons.  
Alan: Ha ha ha! Keep it between the buoys. I got it!  
Jimmy: Alright, well it's five o'clock. Let's go somewhere.  
Alan: I'm ready. Crank it up!  
Jimmy: Let's get out of here.  
Alan: I'm gone!
