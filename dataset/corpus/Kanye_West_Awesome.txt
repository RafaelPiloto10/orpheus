[Verse:]  
You don't need me to ever write  
I read your last message at least 1000 times  
At least 1000, at least 1000 times  
Alright, alright, alright  
Why did you ever listen to  
People trying to hate on you  
At least you know that's nothing new  
Stop everything you're doing now  
Cause baby, you're awesome  
So awesome  
You look too good to be at work  
You feel too good to ever hurt  
I hope you ready for tonight  
I'm gon cook, you'll be dessert  
You can't be still  
You gotta move, you gotta dance  
I gotta live, I gotta love  
I got a hope, I got a chance  
Cause baby, you're awesome  
You don't need to listen to your manager  
You're way too hot for them to handle you  
Baby, not doing nothing? You  
Came for something that I've got it  
Why you fallin' on me  
Cause I'd rather do nothing with you  
Than something with somebody new  
Yeah, I'd rather do nothing with you  
Than something with somebody new  
Stop everything you're doing now  
Cause baby you're awesome  
Don't let nobody bring you down  
You're so awesome  
You're so out the park  
You're so after dark  
You're so sleepless nights, oh you feel so right  
Oh, you nnannanaa  
I know you must be tired  
From running through my mind  
Can I come inside?  
Cause baby you're awesome  
Also, I'm also awesome, also  
I'm also awesome  
Y'all know  
And I'd rather do nothing with you  
Than something with somebody new  
Yeah, I'd rather do nothing with you  
Than something with somebody new  
Stop everything you're doing now  
Cause baby you're awesome  
Don't let nobody bring you down  
You're so awesome  
You're so out the park, you're so after time  
You're so breaking?, oh it feels so right
