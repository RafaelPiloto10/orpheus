If you let me I will be your shelter  
I will be your strngth and shield  
As you battle in the field alone  
There are moments when I sit  
And look into this heart that now  
You've made your home  
Never really understanding  
All that you have done  
To change this heart  
To flesh from stone  
It's at these moments when I feel  
I'd rather go my way  
That I hear your spirit say  
Babe won't you stay right here with me  
I know your burdens  
I know all your needs  
And when you feel you stand alone  
As you battle in the field  
I will forever be your strength  
Forever be your shield  
For the rest of your days  
'Til we meet face to face  
Day by day I seem to fear the fight  
As I do battle with these thoughts in my head  
Thinking of what it would be like for  
Just today to do all that  
I've often felt  
Only one could love somebody  
With a heart so cold  
So lost just like my own  
(But you keep on sayin')  
Babe won't you stay right here with me  
I know your burdens  
I know all your needs  
And when you feel you stand alone  
As you battle in the field  
I will forever be your strength  
Forever be your shield  
For the rest of your days  
'Til we meet face to face  
Sometimes I feel you should just give up on me  
'Coz I keep pushin' you to the limit  
But you never ever let me go  
And with that still small voice  
I hear you say to me  
Come home  
Come home  
Babe won't you stay right here with me  
I know your burdens  
I know all your needs  
And when you feel you stand alone  
As you battle in the field  
I will forever be your strength  
Forever be your shield  
For the rest of your days  
'Til w
