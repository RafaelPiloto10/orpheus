Lust is the fire which warms you in the night.  
Scorching the edge of your soul.  
I am desire, your eyes are filled with light.  
Pleasing the master your goal.  
Like a fly! to a spider, against my web you fight.  
My poison dousing your flame.  
Call on the liar, to fill the hole with light.  
Your feelings went as I came.  
  
Fatal if swallowed, my love's too much to hold.  
A deadly poison, a hot and heavy load.  
Fatal if swallowed, a love you can't resist.  
Another believer, sealed, with a kiss.  
  
Animal attraction, the numbing of your flesh,  
No reason to let this action wait.  
Your physical convulsions, the quiver of your lips,  
Open up, ahh! take the bait.  
You taste it, revolting, wishing you were dead,  
The effect you'll never grow old.  
Oozing slime, foaming at the mouth,  
So dizzy! the poison takes its toll.  
  
No protection. forced injection.  
Feel the bite. feel the sting...  
No detection. slow infection.  
Now you know what good lovin' brings.  
  
Are you a believer, or are you just a corpse,  
A worm eaten mass of disgust.  
Yeah I'm a deceiver, the reaper a letch,  
The reason your driven by lust.  
But your not the first, you won't be the last.  
I lead, others will follow.  
No mercy, forgiveness, no begging for reprieve,  
My venom, fatal if swallowed!  
  
Oh with a kiss.  
Fatal. Kiss this.  
  
Open up wide, I'm comin' inside
