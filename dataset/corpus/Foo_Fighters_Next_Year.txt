I'm in the sky tonight  
There I can keep by your side  
Watching the wide world riot  
And hiding out  
I'll be coming home next year  
  
Into the sun we climb  
Climbing our wings will burn white  
Everyone strapped in tight  
We'll ride it out  
I'll be coming home next year  
  
Come on, get on, get on  
Take it till life runs out  
No-one can find us now  
Living with our heads underground  
  
Into the night we shine  
Lighting the way we glide by  
Catch me if I get too high  
When I come down  
I'll be coming home next year  
  
I'm in the sky tonight  
There I can keep by your side  
Watching the whole world wind  
Around and round  
I'll be coming home next year  
  
Come on, get on, get on  
Take it till I fall down  
No one can find us now  
Living with our heads underground  
  
I'll be coming home next year  
I'll be coming home next year  
Everything's all right up here  
When I come down  
I'll be coming home next year  
  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye  
  
Come on, get on, get on  
Take it till life runs out  
No-one can find us now  
Living with our heads underground  
  
I'll be coming home next year
