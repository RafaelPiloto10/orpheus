I still remember all the back and forth you couldn't stay away  
And I couldn't take it, like a cold wind blows you're calling out my name  
And now it haunts me, softly fading are the memories of your face  
I should have listened when you whispered my name, still you couldn't say  
  
'Cause you couldn't say goodbye  
Now I cannot ask you why  
Although our time is through  
No getting over you  
Things will never be the same  
I can't even say your name  
I know our time is through  
No getting over you  
  
I still remember as we walked the moon to stay out of the way  
Memories burning like a cigarettes, like the ashes call your name  
Lost in a moment when you packed your rags and said you couldn't stay  
Left on a message that I never read, you're calling out my name  
  
'Cause you couldn't say goodbye  
Now I cannot ask you why  
Although our time is through  
No getting over you  
I will never be the same  
I can't even say your name  
I know our time is through  
No getting over you  
  
You know my heart still pumps my blood, all the same  
It's over, there's no starting over, I will live on  
Although your memories lives on, all the same  
It's over, there's no starting over, no starting over  
  
I still remember all the back and forth, you couldn't stay away  
I couldn't take it, like a cold wind blows you're calling out my name  
  
'Cause you couldn't say goodbye  
Now I cannot ask you why  
Although our time is through  
No getting over you  
And I will never be the same  
I can't even say your name  
I know our time is through  
No getting over you  
No getting over you  
Memory lives on  
Getting over you
