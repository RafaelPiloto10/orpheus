We want it all, we want it now  
We want life to be fair, everybody does  
We lose ourselves under the faces  
That we learn to wear, oh we just wanna be loved  
We're so busy tryin' to find wonderland  
We forget just what we've got right here in our hands  
  
All I know is we gotta hold on to  
The beautiful before it's gone  
Life is a sidewalk Mona Lisa  
And it breaks your heart when you see her  
Wash away  
It's all just chalk in the rain  
  
We wanna laugh we wanna live  
We're dyin' for peace in the worst way  
When will we learn to trust each other  
Have a little faith and not be afraid  
Every moment's fleeting like a breath in the wind  
The truth is we may never pass this way again  
  
Let's slow down  
Take a good look around  
At what we got  
Before the sky opens up  
  
It's all just chalk in the rain
