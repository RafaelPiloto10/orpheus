Honey, I'm home and it's late, the day is over  
You've been running through my mind all day long  
And there's somethin' I'm just dying to tell you  
We're not lovin' enough here at home.  
  
And maybe it's a woman's intuition  
For I have those same feelin's too  
We've been living, not loving together  
And I'm so glad to hear it from you.  
  
Turn out the lights, come to bed, let's get to together  
Cause when your touchin' me you mean so much to me in my arms  
You know I said I'll be right there, it'll be heaven  
We'll be closer than ever again.  
  
Closer than ever again
