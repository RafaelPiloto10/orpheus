You make me weep and want to die  
Just when you said we'd try  
Lovin', touchin', squeezin' each other  
When I'm alone by myself  
You're out with someone else  
Lovin', touchin', squeezin' each other  
You're tearin' me apart  
Every day, every day  
You're tearin' me apart  
Oh what can I say?  
You're tearin' me apart  
  
It won't be long, yes, till you're alone  
When your lover, oh, he hasn't come home  
'Cause he's lovin' oo, he's touchin', he's squeezin' another  
  
He's tearin' you apart  
Every day, every day  
He's tearin' you apart  
Oh girl what can you say?  
'Cause he's lovin', touchin', squeezin' another  
Now it's your turn, girl, to cry  
  
Na na na na na na  
Na na na na na  
Na na na na na na  
Na na na na na
