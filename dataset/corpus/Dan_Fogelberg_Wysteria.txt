Wysteria, did you change your face again  
Those of us who loved you when  
Can't even find you.  
Wysteria, did you lose another man  
Did you make him understand  
That he can't touch you.  
  
Wysteria, did he take you to the fair?  
Were the folks that you met there  
The same that we met?  
Wysteria, did he teach you how to dance  
Did he bring you paper fans to hide your secret?  
Was he just like all the rest  
When he got to the sad part  
Did he stay a bit too long  
To save his heart.  
  
Wysteria, are your lips still lily white  
Do they still bloom just  
At night and die at sunrise?
