White sands swollen glands  
Paris Tokyo New New New York M-M-M-Mexico  
Stay plastic woo ooh  
Stay tragic woo ooh  
Proclamation of emancipation  
Oh dear lord, let me into heaven for just an afternoon.  
  
Oh Sam I a,  
I can't go to sleep without Ambien  
Seem so happy call me mister goodbye  
Say catch me if you can, catch me if you can  
  
Let's talk about the scene for a minute  
I know we ain't been seen in a minute  
We left before a minute now we all love in it  
Baby boy if you got the big dreams gonna get it  
Never been the type in tight jeans I won't fit in  
When I see them scene girls that they all gonna get in  
And I'm living clean now while you all walk in it  
Notice me but I don't give a damn if you all don't get it
