When you say the things, you say you gotta mean it  
And when you do the things you do, it's gotta come from the heart  
  
Something's gone, I can't explain  
The heat is missing from the plain  
Can't deny it, there's a link missing from the chain  
There's something wrong with you and me  
When more than one adds up to three  
Don't know the reason, but the fact is plain to see  
It's the touch that you lose, and the words you don't say  
It's our love you abuse, don't you throw it away  
  
When you do what you do that you do to me  
Don't you know that it ain't enough  
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing  
when you do what you do without love, without love  
  
I'm gonna paint a picture of you  
The only colour I need is blue  
You're out of love, baby you know it's true  
Tell me why and I'll try to understand  
  
Cause I can cry when you do what you do to me  
Don't you know that it ain't enough  
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing  
When you do what you do without love  
  
It's the touch that you lose, and the words you don't say  
It's the love you refuse, don't you throw it away  
  
When you do what you do that you do to me  
Don't you know that it ain't enough  
When you do what you do it don't mean a thing  
Then you know it's a crime that you kill me up  
When you do what you do without love, without love  
Don't know what you're doing, what you're doing without love
