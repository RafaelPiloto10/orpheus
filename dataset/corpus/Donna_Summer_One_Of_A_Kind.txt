You're one of a kind  
I gotta have ya  
Well you're one of a kind  
I need to have ya  
Right from the start  
You tore me apart  
You took the best part of my heart  
Body and soul  
You took me out of control  
You stole the best part of my heart  
You're one of a kind  
You've got magic  
I know you're one of a kind  
Baby you're static  
Right from the start  
You tore me apart  
You took the best part of my heart  
Body and soul  
You took me out of control  
You stole the best part of my heart  
Right from the start  
You tore me apart  
You took the best part of my heart  
Body and soul  
You took me out of control  
You stole the best part of my heart
