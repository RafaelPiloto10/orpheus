Your eyes  
Your eyes  
Your eyes search for me  
Your eyes search for me  
Your eyes search for me  
Your eyes search for me  
Your eyes  
Your eyes search for me  
  
For so long I've wanted to come home  
Held back by lies of serpents and tongues of brothers  
Turning a child into an enemy  
Turning open arms into closed fists  
  
I could see the reflection in the tears  
That made their way down Your face  
Onto the ground I kneel upon  
They form a river that overtakes me  
Compassion envelops me  
I forgive and release  
Forgive, release  
Forgiven, released
