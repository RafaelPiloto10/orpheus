Lyrics:bosson, music: bosson  
Going down to the water, some time alone  
Some time for my heart and soul  
When I think of the moment, you shed a tear  
And said I deserve much more  
You must try to put some faith in yourself  
I swear to God you are the best a man can get  
Now and forever  
Chorus:  
I love you, I love you, I love you and I'll show you that it's true  
I'm crazy about you  
I love you, I love you, I love you and you know that it's true  
I'm crazy about you  
Baby I love you  
We can find a solution, I know it's hard  
You have to go back in time  
But when you trust your emotions, then let me in  
I'll give you this heart of mine  
You must try to put some faith in yourself  
I swear to God you are the best a man can get  
Now and forever  
Chorus  
When you wake up in the morning, I love you  
When you come home in the evening, I want you  
When you are angry and shouting, I need you  
When I find you with another, I love you  
Chorus
