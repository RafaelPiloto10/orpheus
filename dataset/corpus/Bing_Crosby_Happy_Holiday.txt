Happy Holiday  
Happy holiday, happy holiday  
While the merry bells keep ringing  
May your ev'ry wish come true  
  
Happy holiday, happy holiday  
May the calendar keep bringing  
Happy holidays to you  
  
Come To Holiday Inn  
If you're burdened down with trouble  
If your nerves are wearing thin  
Park your load down the road  
And come to Holiday Inn  
  
If the traffic noise affects you  
Like a squeaky violin  
Kick your cares down the stairs  
And come to Holiday Inn  
  
If you can't find someone who  
Would set your heart a-whirl  
Take your car and motor to  
The home of boy meets girl  
  
If you're laid-up with a breakdown  
Throw away your vitamin  
Don't get worse, grab your nurse  
And come to Holiday Inn
