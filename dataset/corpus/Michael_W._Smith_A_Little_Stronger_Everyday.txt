I was throwin' away what I needed most  
It was the Father, Son and the Holy Ghost  
A little carnal knowledge is a dangerous thing  
It'll eat a hole in the brain  
I'd be the biggest fool in the whole universe  
To trade a heavenly blessing for a worldly curse  
I was a weaker man 'til I made my stand  
Now I am here to make a change  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm running blind on the wheels of faith  
(I'm) moving to the beat of a heart that prays  
(And) hangin' on every word you said  
I get a little stronger every day  
  
Ain't ganna find any help on the T.V.  
Or written down on the pages of People Magazine  
It takes digging a little deeper into the Good Book now  
For a little sacred advice...oh yah  
  
[Chorus ]  
  
[Bridge:]  
Gettin' strong, a stronger now, every day  
Gettin' strong, a stronger now, every day  
I'm getting stronger  
  
[Chorus]
