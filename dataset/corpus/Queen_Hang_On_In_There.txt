Don't let go  
Don't lose your mystique  
Wait a little longer  
Tomorrow brings another feast  
  
Don't let go  
Don't lose your reputation  
Thank God you're still alive, ha  
You're still in one piece  
  
Hang on in there, don't lose your appetite  
Hang on in there, forget the danger signs  
Pray for that magical moment (just stay there) and it will appear  
(Don't fight for lost emotions)  
Wait for the sunrise,  
And everything will seem so clear  
(Look straight ahead, look straight ahead)  
  
Hang on in there (hang on in there)  
Hang on in there (hang on in there)  
Your wish will be granted  
All your problems will disappear  
  
Don't be a fool  
You haven't reached your peak  
You've got a fast car racing up inside you  
Your life is incomplete  
  
Hang on in there, hang on in there  
Pray for that magical moment and it will appear  
(Wait for the moment)  
Wait for the sunrise - oh  
Just wait and see and it will seem so clear  
Ba dap bap ee bap bap ba ba bap bap de de de da  
Hey  
And let's go, let's go - o.k. now do the change now  
Hang on  
Yeah  
Hang on in there, hang on in there  
Yeah hang on in there, yeah
