One rainy afternoon at Union Station  
As I sat alone and waited on my train  
I overheard a lover's conversation  
Laced with desperation and pain.  
I heard a girl say when is your train leavin'  
The schedule's blurry, something's in my eyes  
I heard a boy say I'll just board it early  
With a voice some lone drown out goodbye.  
I thought there's so little love in the world  
There's so little love in the world  
With all of those millions of lonely boys and girls  
Why is there so little love in the world.  
I saw them walk together thro' the station  
I saw the girl walk back alone her head held down  
Her tremblin' lips the only indication  
Of her losin' struggle not to cry.
