Squirrels. All we really are is squirrels.  
We're cute and harmless - we are squirrels.  
Peace loving herbivores. We're squirrels.  
We like to gather nuts, but people splatter our guts.  
When you're on a country drive it isn't easy to survive.  
Don't kill us squirrels. All we really are is squirrels.  
Peace loving herbivores. We're squirrels.  
Squirrels. We're not delicious  
Squirrels. We are not racoons  
Squirrels. Don't live in Palm trees.  
Squirrels. Or in your bathroom.  
Squirrels. All we really are is squirrels.  
We're cute and harmless - we are Squirrels.  
Peace loving herbivores. We're Squirrels.
