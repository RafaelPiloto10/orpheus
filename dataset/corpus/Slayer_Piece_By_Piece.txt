Modulistic terror  
A vast sadistic feast  
The only way to exit  
Is going piece by piece  
  
You have no choice of life or death  
My face you will not see  
I'll rip your flesh 'till there's no breath  
Dismembered destiny  
  
As soon as life has left your corpse  
I'll make you part of me  
No emotion  
Death is all I see  
  
Modulistic terror  
A vast sadistic feast  
The only way to exit  
Is going piece by piece  
  
Bones and blood lie on the ground  
Rotten limbs lie dead  
Decapitated bodies found  
On my wall, your head!  
  
On your trail I close the gap  
One more life that soon won't be  
No emotion  
Your flesh is all I need  
  
I'll send you to your maker  
Confront the God you seek  
A flash of red upon his [sings "your"] chest  
Safety out of reach  
  
[You have no choice of life or death  
My face you will not see  
I'll rip your flesh 'till there's no breath  
Dismembered destiny]  
  
[Modulistic terror  
A vast sadistic feast  
There's only one way out of here  
Piece by piece]
