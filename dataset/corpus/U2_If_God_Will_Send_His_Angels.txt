Nobody else here baby  
No one here to blame  
No one to point the finger  
It's just you and me and the rain  
It's the blind leading the blond  
It's the stuff, it's the stuff of country songs  
If God will send his angels  
And if God will send a sign  
And if God will send his visions  
Would everything be alright  
God has got his phone off the hook, babe  
Would he even pick up if he could  
It's been a while since we saw that child  
Hanging 'round this neighborhood  
You see his mother dealing in a doorway  
See Father Christmas with a begging bowl  
Jesus sister's eyes are a blister  
The High Street never looked so low  
It's the blind, leading the blond  
It's the cops collecting for the cons  
If God will send his angels  
And if God will send a sign  
And if God will send his visions  
Where do we go  
Where do we go  
Jesus never let me down  
You know Jesus used to show me the score  
Then they put Jesus in show business  
Now it's hard to get in the door  
It's the stuff, it's the stuff of country songs  
But I guess it was something to go on  
So where is the hope and where is the faith  
And the love...what's that you say to me  
Does love...light up your Christmas Tree  
The next minute your blowing a fuse  
And the cartoon network turns into the news  
If God will send his angels  
I sure could use them here right now  
Well if God would send his angels  
Where do we go  
I don't need to lie  
I don't need to know  
And I don't want to promise  
And I don't want to lie  
I just want to feel the song
