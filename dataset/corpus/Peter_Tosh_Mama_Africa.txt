(CHORUS)  
Mama Africa  
How are you doing Mama  
Mama Africa  
Long time me no see you Mama  
They took me away from you Mama  
Long before I was born  
They took me away from you Mama  
Long before I came on in  
CHORUS  
There's so many things about you  
Wondering where you are  
They try their best to hide you Mama  
But I search and I find you  
CHORUS  
In you there's so much beauty  
In you there's so much life  
In you there's so many kingdoms  
To me it's out of sight  
CHORUS  
You're the maker of gold Mama  
You're the maker of diamond  
You're the maker of pearls  
And the maker of all precious goals  
CHORUS  
I've been waiting, yearning, looking  
Searching to find you  
I've been crying, praying hoping  
That I may find you Mama  
CHORUS  
You're my mother Africa  
You're my father Africa  
CHORUS I'm proud of you Mama  
I love you Mama  
I'm proud of you Mama  
I love you heavenly  
CHORUS
