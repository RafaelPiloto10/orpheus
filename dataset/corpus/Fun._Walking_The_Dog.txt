Walking alone 'cause the night is dead  
Crossed my mind when I crossed the bridge  
  
How you lost your mind and your wrist got bruised  
And you wanted better love when it's sleeping in your bedroom  
Hold on, stay on my side, don't go  
  
If you could see me whoever I am, it's not like a movie but it's not all skin
and bones  
So come on love(come on, come on, come all and go)  
  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah I will not let you go  
  
Now I'm walking alone 'cause the night is dead  
My feet don't glide like they did back then  
When I would call you up so we could shoot the moon  
These days I'm left to howl in toon  
  
Hearts do break and I must admit, I've got a better set of chords so I
might've been fakin??? it  
Think I really cried just once so  
  
If you could see me whoever I am, it's not like a movie but it's not all skin
and bones  
So come on love(come on, come on, come all and go)  
  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah I will not let you go  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah I will not let you go  
  
After all the shows, after the boys of summer will go  
Amid all the confusion  
These friends I've been losin???  
I always thought from the start  
I'd be the one moving on  
I guess I'll never know  
Where all the boys of summer will go  
But I'll miss what we made  
All those days were not wasted  
There are some things I may never know  
  
How you lost your mind and your wrist got bruised  
And you wanted better love when it's sleeping in your bedroom  
Hold on, stay on my side, don't go  
  
If you could see me whoever I am, it's not like a movie but it's not all skin
and bones  
So come on love(come on, come on, come all and go)  
  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah I will not let you go  
  
If you could see me whoever I am, it's not like a movie but it's not all skin
and bones  
So come on love(come on, come on, come all and go)  
  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah I will not let you go  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah I will not let you go  
  
(Walking alone 'cause the night is dead)  
If you could see me whoever I am,  
(Crossed my mind when I crossed the bridge)  
It's not like a movie but it's not all skin and bones  
(Walking alone 'cause the night is dead)  
So come on love(come on, come on, come all and go)  
(Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah I will not let you go)
