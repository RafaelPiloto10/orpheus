Got to be there, got to be there in the morning  
When she says hello to the world.  
Got to be there, got to be there,  
Bring her good times and show her that she's my girl.  
Oh, what a feeling there'll be the moment I know she loves me.  
Cause when I look in her eyes.  
I realize I need her sharing the world beside me.  
So I've got to be there, got to be there in the morning,  
And welcome her into my world, and show her that she's my girl.  
When she says hello world!  
Got to be there.  
  
Got to be there, got to be there  
When she needs someone to keep her through the night.  
Got to be there, got to be there, to take her hand and lead her into my life.  
Oh, what a feeling there'll be the moment I know she loves me  
Cause when I look in her eyes,  
I realize I need her sharing the world beside me.  
That's why I've got to be there,  
Got to be there where love begins and that's ev'rywhere she goes,  
I've got to be there so she knows that when she's with me she's home.  
Got to be there, got to be there, got to be there.  
Got to be there, got to be there, got to be there.  
Got to be there, got to be there, got to be there.  
  
Got to be there, got to be there in the morning  
When she says hello to the world.  
Got to be there, got to be there,  
Bring him good times and show him that I'm his girl.  
Oh, what a feeling there'll be the moment I know she loves me.  
'Cause when I look in his eyes.  
I realize I need him sharing the world beside me.  
So I've got to be there, got to be there in the morning,  
And welcome him into my world, and show him that I'm his girl.  
When she says hello world!  
Got to be there.  
  
Got to be there, got to be there  
When she needs someone to keep him through the night.  
Got to be there, got to be there, to take her hand and lead her into my life.  
Oh, what a feeling there'll be the moment I know she loves me  
Cause when I look in her eyes,  
I realize I need him sharing the world beside me.  
That's why I've got to be there,  
Got to be there where love begins and that's ev'rywhere she goes,  
I've got to be there so he knows that when he's with me he's home.  
Got to be there, got to be there, got to be there.  
Got to be there, got to be there, got to be there.
