You can spend all your days in the grind  
Converting your nickles to dimes  
You could stuff all your pockets till they overflow  
Don't chu know don't chu know don't chu know  
  
You can say you're too old to be young  
You think you're too smart to be dumb  
But the well seasoned pro knows how long he can go  
Don't you know don't chu know don't chu know  
  
You can sing every song that's been sung  
Conquer the moon and the sun  
But if you asked me it's all both been said and been done  
  
We're just recycled history machines  
Cavemen in faded blue jeans  
It's the unanswered question in each one of us  
Don't chu know don't chu know don't chu know  
  
Bridge  
The more we learn the less we know  
What you keep is what you can't let go  
Take it fast or take it slow  
Just one way for you to go  
Don't chu know - let's go now  
  
You can sing every song that's been sung  
Conquer the moon and the sun  
But if you asked me it's not in the race that you run  
It's the outcast in each one of us  
  
Who gets the girl who is too glamorous  
There's no one to deceive, it's just all make believe  
Don't chu know don't chu know don't chu know  
Don't chu know don't chu know don't chu know  
Don't chu know don't chu know don't chu know
