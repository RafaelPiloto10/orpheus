The darkness of my world was all cleared away  
The flowers are blooming, it's a beautiful day  
There's a girl with a heart as big as the sky  
She's sunshine and I know why  
  
All for the love of sunshine  
All for the love of sunshine  
The Lord smiled down on this life of mine  
And sent me the love of sunshine  
  
Though sunshine can always make my days seem bright  
Sunshine can warm up a cold, cold night  
I know my sunshine was sent from above  
An angel that's filled with love  
  
All for the love of sunshine  
All for the love of sunshine  
The Lord smiled down on this life of mine  
And sent me the love of sunshine  
  
Through winter, the springtime, the summer and fall  
The moonlight, the starlight, she outshines them all  
In a world filled with fear, with pain and such harm  
My sunshine can't be so warm  
  
Now I live, all for the love of sunshine  
All for the love of sunshine  
The Lord smiled down on this life of mine  
And sent me the love of sunshine  
  
All for the love of sunshine  
All for the love of sunshine  
The Lord smiled down on this life of mine  
And sent me the love of sunshine  
All for the love of sunshine  
All for the love of sunshine
