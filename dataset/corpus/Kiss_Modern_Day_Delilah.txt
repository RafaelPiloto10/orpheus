I still remember when I saw your face across the room  
Told me to take you but the price of love would seal my doom  
  
I know the way you made the others break  
But loving me would be your first mistake  
  
Slave away, slave away  
Modern day Delilah  
Each time you learn to give  
Queen to slave  
Modern day Delilah  
  
Listen  
  
You lived your glory in a liars haze you called the truth  
The same old story of a social plan from wasted youth  
  
You thought that you could bring me to my knees  
But who's the one who's crying baby please  
  
Slave away, slave away  
Modern day Delilah  
Each time you learn to give  
Queen to slave  
Modern day Delilah  
  
Just like the trigger of a loaded gun  
You were the reason for the damage done  
Too many lovers like a hunters prey  
Not today  
  
I know the way you made the others break  
But loving me would be your last mistake  
Each time you learn to give  
  
Slave away  
Modern day Delilah  
Shame, shame, shame on you girl  
Queen to slave, come on now  
Modern day Delilah  
Yeah, yeah, each time you learn to give  
Slave away, slave away  
Not today  
Delilah  
Queen to slave, loves decayed  
Delilah
