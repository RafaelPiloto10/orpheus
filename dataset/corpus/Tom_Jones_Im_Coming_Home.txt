I'm coming home to your loving heart  
Till the one that I was  
True way and broke apart  
  
I want you I need you  
A chance is on I'm asking now  
I must get back to you so now  
So I am coming home to you  
'Cause I am nothing without you  
May be you found somebody new  
'Cause I'm still coming home to you  
  
Please let me stay and forget your pride  
Now my world is falling round  
I got know when behind  
  
I want you I need you  
I know with true I made you cry  
Then like a fool I say goodbye  
Now I am coming home to you  
Yes I am nothing without you  
May be you found somebody new  
But I'm still coming home to you
