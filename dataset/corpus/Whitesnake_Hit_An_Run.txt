I've never had a home sweet home life  
An' I don't want a nine to five,  
So many women I know  
Think they can tie me down,  
But, I will never let them take me alive  
I hit an' run, hit an' run, hit an' run, hit an' run, hit an' run.  
  
Now some women say they don't want nothing,  
But a sweet talkin' bull of a man,  
I've heard it before, I can't hear it no more  
'cause they all take whatever they can,  
  
But, still I want a heartbreaker,  
A love maker, a soul shaker,  
A women who can turn me on,  
For a just little hit an' run, hit an' run  
  
She can be a love stealer,  
A double dealer, a free wheeler  
As long as she can turn me on  
For just a little hit an' run,  
A little bit of hit an' run  
  
You can keep your lock and key  
No ball and chain can harness me.  
Take me home tonight,  
Love and treat me right  
But, in the morning you'll find me gone,  
I hit an' run.  
  
Hit an' run
