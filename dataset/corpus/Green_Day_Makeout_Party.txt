Hey, you got yourself a pretty little blouse  
I think I wanna rub it the wrong way  
Do you wanna spin a bottle, play a game of chicken?  
Well, it's a tongue twister till your lips are bleeding  
  
Oh, anyhow, anywhere  
Kiss me there, oh kiss me there  
Oh, scream and shout, truth or dare  
Kiss me there, oh kiss me there  
  
Oh, you're so precious, you're a fucking delinquent  
Well I got myself jonesin' and I need some fixin'  
It's a makeout party on another dimension  
And it's gonna get crowded with some bad intensions  
  
Oh, anyhow, anywhere  
Kiss me there, oh kiss me there  
Oh, scream and shout, truth or dare  
Kiss me there, oh kiss me there

Kiss me there
