I'm goin' back to New York city  
Times square sure will be shinin' bright  
I know it sure looks pretty  
But I don't go down every night.  
  
I'm gonna take in Memphis  
You know the one down in Tennessee  
And if you want to boogie  
Now that's the place to be.  
  
Sittin' in a bar in Macon  
Drinkin' something called Rebel Yells  
When I thought I heard someone ringing  
I guess she's a southern bell.  
  
We just cut out of El Paso  
It just fries there in that desert sun  
And if you've ever been down there man  
Then you know why we run.  
  
I got jet lag  
And livin' out an overnight bag  
Time changes every day  
They do things a different way  
Back in the U.S.A.  
  
Tryin' hard to make a phone call  
"Long distance over seas"  
"Yes ma'am I did say Scotland"  
"Could you spell that again for me please"  
  
You know that it just blew my mind  
I'd love to go back there next trip  
I sure hope we get some time.  
  
Driving down a Detroit freeway  
Just lookin' at those concrete walls  
Hey but it's a good town to rock 'n roll in  
"What do you mean the police closed the god damned hall?"  
  
Flyin' home tomorrow  
To be there's gonna be just great  
And after some time with my lady  
I'm gonna be back to rock 'n roll in the States.
