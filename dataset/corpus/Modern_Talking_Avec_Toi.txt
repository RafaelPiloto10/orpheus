Avec toi, avec toi be the lady of my heart  
I will cry, I will die if you love me  
  
You're all I want, I told you twice  
You are for me my paradise  
My heart is makes a lonely sound to me  
You had the love right in your eyes  
But maybe you are telling lies  
My heart it makes a lonely sound to me  
  
Avec toi, avec toi be the lady of my heart  
I will smile, I will try, if you love me  
Avec toi, avec toi  
give you all my heart, ce soir  
I will cry, I will die, if you leave me  
  
You are the first, you are my world  
I'll never find a better girl  
My heart it makes a lonely sound to me  
You are my love, you are my life  
Without you girl I can't survive  
My heart it makes a lonely sound to me  
  
Red, white, green and black, why you always make me sad  
ABC and D, all my love for you is free  
1, 2, 3, and 4 all my love you can't ignore  
Tell me, that you mine baby til the end of time  
Tell me, you can't hide, that your love for me is right  
1, 2, 3 and 4 all my love you can't ignore
