In the evening by the moonlight  
When my mother had finished working  
We used to sit around the fire place  
Till the cornbread it was done  
And then we all would eat our supper  
After that we'd clean the kitchen  
It's the only time they ever gave us to spare  
To have a little fun  
Then my daddy used to take his fiddle down  
That hung upon the wall  
While the silvery moon was shining clear and bright  
How the folks would enjoy it  
They would sit all night and listen  
As we used to sing in the evening by the moonlight  
  
In the evening by the moonlight  
You could hear banjos ringing  
You could hear them by the moonlight  
You could hear my folks all singing  
How my mother she would enjoy it  
She would sit all night and listen  
As we sang in the evening by the moolight oh yeah  
  
In the evening by the moonlight  
You could hear folks all singing  
In the evening by the moonlight  
You could hear my folks all singing  
How my mother she would enjoy it  
She would sit all night and listen  
As we sang in the evening by the moolight oh yeah  
  
In the evening by the moonlight  
You could hear banjos ringing  
In the evening by the moonlight  
You could hear my folks all singing  
How my mother she would enjoy it  
She would sit all night and listen  
As we sang in the evening by the moolight oh yeah
