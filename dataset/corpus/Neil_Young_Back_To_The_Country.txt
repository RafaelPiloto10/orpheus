When I was a younger man  
Got lucky with  
A rock 'n' roll band  
Struck gold in Hollywood  
All that time I knew I would  
Get back to the country  
Back where it all began  
Get back to the country  
Back in the barn again.  
  
Now when we hit the road  
Big buses and trucks unload  
After the curtain falls  
Load up and then we all  
Get back to the country  
Back where it all began  
Get back to the country  
Back on the road again.  
  
When I was a younger man  
Got lucky with  
A rock 'n' roll band  
Struck gold in Hollywood  
All that time I knew I would  
Get back to the country  
Back where it all began  
Get back to the country  
Back in the barn again.
