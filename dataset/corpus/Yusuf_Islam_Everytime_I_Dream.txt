Every time I dream I keep seeing,  
Streets and alleyways, places that I've never known,  
Every time I dream I am being,  
Lifted to a height, that I too frightened to go,  
  
Then I wake up and find everything's away, it seems, one night ago,  
Every time I sleep I keep hoping,  
This would be the night of nights that I see you again,  
As I close my eyes like rims and curtains, slowly rising on an empty stage,  
Then I'm back in the stall sitting all alone waiting for the show to begin,  
Oh oh  
  
Every time I dream I would often find myself running,  
From a wild pack of lice,  
'Till I reach a house and hear the gurge upstairs,  
And look for a place to hide,  
But if I saw you there,  
I wouldn't dare dream again of opening my eyes,
