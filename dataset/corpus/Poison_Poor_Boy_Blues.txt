My daddy said  
"Son, don't you come to me cryin'  
Cause money don't make you a happy man"  
He said the grass is always greener  
Any place except where you stand  
  
He said some are born to win  
And some born to lose  
And sing them poor boy blues  
  
Watch out  
  
I've lived uptown, downtown  
Lord I've lived everywhere  
Almost drowned in the puddle of my own sweat I swear  
I believe it's due time I get my mansion in ole Bel Air  
  
[Chorus]  
But I'm still singin' those poor boy blues  
Poor boy blues  
You don't know how I'm feeling baby  
Until you're wearing my shoes  
Sure as I'm standing here  
I got them poor boy blues  
  
Friday night I get tanked up  
And tossed in the local slam  
At least I get three square meals  
Until someone gets me out of this jam  
In the meanwhile all my green  
Is going to Uncle Sam  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Walk this dog  
  
[Chorus]
