Rolled out of bed on the right side  
Looking up at the big blue sky  
Oh yeah-oh yeah  
Who I am is what I am  
A piece in a part of a bigger plan  
Oh yeah-oh yeah  
  
Breathe deep  
Taste the moment  
Few and far between  
  
[Chorus]  
Days like these-they don't get any better  
Let this be for always and forever  
Every minute is so perfectly  
Just the way that it was meant to be  
Days like these-so graceful that I'm falling  
On my knees and thanking God for all the  
Little things that make me wanna say  
How I wish I had a million days like these  
  
Life is running like a dream  
I know I can do anything  
Oh yeah-oh yeah  
Days like this I could believe  
The sun is shining just for me  
Oh yeah-oh yeah  
  
Eyes closed  
Touch the freedom  
Never let it go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's as if I never knew that clouds existed  
If there ever was a day to take a chance I'll risk it
