There's a man in me who's lost his way  
And he searches for his pride  
He's confused by who he's told to be  
Cause he feels the beast inside  
  
He is troubled by the changing times  
And he fears his dreams have died  
There's a man that's waited  
Hoping to be liberated  
  
There's a man in me who  
I want to save  
Revive his dignity  
Free from his cage  
And release the man in me who  
Cries for the day  
He will be let out  
And show us the way  
I believe there's a man in me  
  
I have lived inside my mother's eyes  
I have felt my father's heart  
I am torn between the dark and light  
But I won't be torn apart  
  
Cause there's a man in me who's unafraid  
Who only now can feel his rage  
He's been taught to hide it  
But he can no longer fight it  
  
There's a man in me who  
I want to save  
Revive his dignity  
Free from his cage  
And release the man in me who  
Cries for the day  
He will be let out  
And show us the way  
I believe there's a man in me  
  
Here we are  
I didn't think we'd get this far  
We were overdue  
When it's time  
To understand the man  
Then I can love  
The woman in you  
  
There's a man that's waited  
Hoping to be liberated  
  
There's a man in me who  
I want to save  
Revive his dignity  
Free from his cage  
And release the man in me who  
Cries for the day  
He will be let out  
And show us the way  
I believe there's a man in me
