Oh darling, will our love be like an evergreen tree  
Stay ever green and young as the seasons go  
Your kisses could make love grow like an evergreen tree  
Bloom in the summer's sun and the winter's snow  
  
On every branch will blossom, dreams for me and you  
Our tree of love will stay ever green, if our hearts stay ever true  
  
Oh darling, I love you so, don't you know that I'll be  
True 'til the leaves turn blue on the evergreen tree  
  
On every branch will blossom, dreams for me and you  
Our tree of love will stay ever green, if our hearts stay ever true  
Oh darling, I love you so, don't you know that I'll be  
True 'til the leaves turn blue on the evergreen tree  
  
On the evergreen tree, on the evergreen tree.
