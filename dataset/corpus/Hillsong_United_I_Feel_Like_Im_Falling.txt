Standing tall in this wide space  
Getting lost in Your embrace  
I see a fire burning brighter  
It's calling me to catch the flame  
  
I feel like I'm falling over and over in love with You  
It's not just a feeling, but I know that He is real  
I feel like I'm falling into the arms of a mighty God  
It's not just a feeling, but I know that He is real  
  
You're drawing me closer to Your side  
It's the safest place I know where to hide  
With one glance You captured my heart  
You speak Your words and set me apart  
  
I feel like I'm falling, I feel like I'm falling  
I feel like I'm falling, falling into the arms of love
