If you love somebody enough  
You'll follow wherever they go  
That's how I got to Memphis  
That's how I got to Memphis  
If you love somebody enough  
You'll go where your heart wants to go  
That's how I got to Memphis  
That's how I got to Memphis  
I know if you'd seen her you'd tell me 'cause you are my friend  
I've got to find her and find out the trouble she's in  
If you tell me that she's not here  
I'll follow the trail of her tears  
That's how I got to Memphis  
That's how I got to Memphis  
She would get mad and she used to say  
That she'd come back to Memphis someday  
That's how I got to Memphis  
That's how I got to Memphis  
I haven't eaten a bite  
Or slept for three days and nights  
That's how I got to Memphis  
That's how I got to Memphis  
I've got to find her and tell her that I love her so  
I'll never rest 'til I find out why she had to go  
Thank you for your precious time  
Forgive me if I start to cryin'  
That's how I got to Memphis (x8)
