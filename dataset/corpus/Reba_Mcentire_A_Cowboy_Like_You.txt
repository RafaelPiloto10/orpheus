Well there's a jukebox in my ear  
Playing so loud I can hardly hear  
And it's telling a story  
About a boy like you  
  
And each selection that I make  
Tells me how my heart will break  
Falling in love with a cowboy like you  
  
When it's just an old machine  
Without a heart but oh so mean  
Says I'll probably spend my whole life feeling blue  
So I'll just put in one more dime  
And play that same song one more time  
Cause I want to hear about a cowboy like you  
  
Repeat Verse number three  
I guess that I should go on home  
But I can't stand to be alone  
Cause I'll only dream about  
A cowboy like you  
Yeah I'll only dream about  
A cowboy like you
