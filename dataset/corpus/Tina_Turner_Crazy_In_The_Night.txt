Somewhere out in the galaxy  
A number's up but not for me  
There's a light inside the window  
And the curtain's coming down  
Pig is on the spit, and turning round  
  
Going crazy in the night  
Crazy in the night  
  
Dropped in from Munich with a master plan  
Guess he left his wife and kids at home  
He's got so much money rollin'  
From the crimes he'll commit  
But the Siamese cats are gonna take a little bit  
  
[Chorus]  
Going crazy in the night  
Crazy in the night  
Will I turn and run, or do I stand and face the gun?  
Going crazy in the night  
Everybody seemed to've lost their way  
Crazy in the night  
Seems there's no way outta here  
Do I turn and run?  
No!  
  
Got no hands, but I've got my head  
I've come so far from the temple  
Maybe this is Babylon, or maybe it's a dream  
If it weren't so beautiful, it would be obscene  
Drinking with the panthers, dancing for their life  
God, this place is hungry  
Come and see the players, but don't stay for the show  
The cats are out tonight, hungry for their rites  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Got no hands, but I've got my head  
I've come so far from the temple  
Maybe this is Babylon, or maybe its a dream  
If it weren't so beautiful...
