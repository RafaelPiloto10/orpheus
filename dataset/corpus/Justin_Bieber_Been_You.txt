[Verse 1]  
Feeling the reminisce  
Gone in an instance  
Blink of an eye  
No goodbye  
I had a notion  
Deep as the ocean  
Blue like the sky  
Oh my  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Like a permanent stain  
Wishing I could just wash away, away  
Hate our love was in vein  
But we're the blame  
For all the pain  
For all the pain  
  
[Chorus]  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
It could have been you  
(Woah, woah, woah)  
If I had the chance  
If I had the chance  
I'd make us brand new  
I never wanted to be  
Wanted to be  
Your enemy, no, no  
But if I  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
It could have been you  
Been you  
  
[Verse 2]  
There repercussion  
Of missing your loving  
Haunts me at night  
The ghosts are alive  
All of the memories  
Of serenity  
Dwindle in my mind  
All the time  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Like a permanent stain  
Wishing I could just wash away, away  
Hate our love was in vein  
Who was to blame  
For all the pain  
For all the pain  
  
[Chorus]  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
It could have been you  
If I had a chance  
If I had a chance  
I'd make us brand new  
I never wanted to be  
Wanted to be  
Your enemy, no, no  
But if I  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
It could have been you  
Been you  
  
[Break]  
  
[Chorus]  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
It could have been you  
If I had a chance  
If I had a chance  
I'd make us brand new  
I never wanted to be  
Wanted to be  
Your enemy, no, no  
But if I  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
It could have been you  
Been you
