It was a masquerade at Mardi Gras  
That was the only trip that I recall  
Every time I turned around at all  
There was you  
  
Some days are easier said than done  
Always expecting something's wrong  
I'd rather live alone than drag this on  
  
Take your time, please lay your hands on me  
Don't wanna be alone, oh no  
A mask behind the face and then you're gone  
Oh,yeah- comes a time when you're better off alone  
You're on your own  
  
I've got a kaleidoscope of memories  
Visions of you locked up inside of me  
Can't you see  
  
We once collided like a broken wheel  
So undecided what was real  
Maybe a crash somehow has sex appeal  
Whatever turns you on  
  
Take your time- please lay your hands on me  
Don't wanna be alone, oh no  
A mask behind a face and then you're gone  
Oh yeah- comes a time when you're better off alone  
  
One down, one to go  
Oh no, playin' in a carnival  
Your time is gone  
  
One down- one to go  
Oh no, playin' in a carnival  
You're all alone  
  
One down, one to go  
Oh no, you're on your own
