If you hate me after what I say  
Can't put it off any longer  
I just gotta tell you anyway  
Bye bye baby, baby good-bye  
(Bye baby, baby bye bye)  
Bye bye baby, baby don't make me cry  
(Bye baby, baby bye bye)  
You're the one girl in town I'd marry  
Girl I'd marry you now if I were free  
I wish it could be  
I could love you but why begin it  
Cause there ain't any future in it  
(She's got me and I'm not free so)  
Bye bye baby, baby good-bye  
(Bye baby, baby bye bye)  
Bye bye baby don't make me cry  
(Bye baby, baby bye bye)  
Guess I never will know you better  
Wish I knew you before I met her  
Gee, how good you would be for me  
Should have told you that I can't linger  
There's a wedding ring on my finger  
(She's got me and I'm not free so)  
Bye bye baby, baby good-bye  
(Bye baby, baby bye bye)  
Bye bye baby don't make me cry  
(Bye baby, baby bye bye)  
Ohhhhh, ohhhhhh  
Bye, baby bye  
Ohhhhh, baby try  
Repeat chorus to fade
