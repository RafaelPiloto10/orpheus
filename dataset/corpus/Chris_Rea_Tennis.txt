In the morning madness and the stabbing light  
She pours the coffee and she says  
"What was wrong with you last night?"  
"Dreams, just dreams my love, we're half asleep"  
But the headline's on tennis  
So it seems, everything's all right  
There's a girl from the Midwest, with a pretty face  
Scratched where it itched, they said it was a disgrace  
"I don't want to go to work today  
want to stay at home and watch that girl play"  
Do you like tennis?  
Yes I do  
  
There are people in boats in the middle of the sea  
Crying and dying like Jews  
Do you like tennis?  
Freedom is the man with the red grenade  
She ran out of gas, got beat and raped  
Do you like tennis?  
Well do you like tennis?  
Yes I do
