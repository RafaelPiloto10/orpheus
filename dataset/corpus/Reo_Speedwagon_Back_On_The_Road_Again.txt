Please don't hate me mama for what I'm about to do  
But the good times we've had together are just about now through  
Please don't misunderstand me, I hate to see you cry  
But I think that it might look better if I told you now goodbye  
  
I'm back on the road again, it's time I leave you now  
And maybe I'll see you next time, that I'm around  
Until then I hope your happy baby and good times come your way  
I'm back on the road again, I'm on my way  
  
Well I've loved you since the day I met you and I'll love you till the day I
die  
But we both know the life I'm livin and we both know the reason why  
That I've got to leave ya mama and I've got to leave today  
But you know that I'll see you next time that I come through your town to play  
  
[Chorus]  
Ooh, bye-bye baby  
  
[Chorus]
