An all out panic, thrashing  
Splitting you in half  
Mistook the sobbing for a laugh  
Travel close concealed  
I'll leave the dorr ajar  
So who has taken you this far  
You've been here before  
  
Call if you need  
I'm right over here  
With a finger on the trigger  
And if you need me  
Fall and you'll bleed  
As the demon appear  
It's time to stand, deliver  
And if you know me  
  
[Chorus]  
I am your stand and deliver  
I am your shot (golden gun)  
I am you're voice in the sliver  
(I am, I am, I am the one)  
I am your stand and deliver  
I am your shot (golden gun)  
(I am, I am, I am the one)  
  
Now when you get inside  
Be careful what you say  
Don't be mistaken for the prey  
Low to the ground is best  
Attend to the bizarre  
So who has taken you this far  
I've seen you before  
  
Call if you need  
I'm right over here  
With a finger on the trigger  
And if you need me  
Fall and you'll bleed  
As the demon appear  
It's time to stand, deliver  
  
[Chorus]
