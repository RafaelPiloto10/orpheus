[Z-Ro]  
I'm a Ridgemont soldier, state of Texas stunner  
King of the ghetto, even when I was a new comer  
24 hours a day, I be sending fellas under  
If they people want revenge, I never worry or wonder  
When my motherfucking beef coming  
Nigga this Rap-A-Lot mafia, head-n-chief coming  
Everybody claiming they got guerillas in they click, why they be lying  
When automatics start bucking, they turn them monkeys on the vine  
Trying to get away, from the drama  
But my barrel be spinning, like a set of Yokohama  
I gotta blame it on my messed up childhood, this how I turned out  
Hotter than first degree burns, unable to burn out  
  
[Hook - 2x]  
Z-Ro, I think you fellas know my name mayn  
Z-Ro, making these haters mad that's my thang mayn  
Z-Ro, I'm real and I ain't gon never change mayn  
Z-Ro, me and a piece of platinum that's the same thang  
  
[Z-Ro]  
We ain't riding on no horses, round here  
We get it how we live, that's why it go down round here  
We going through thangs, plenty plenty pain round here  
I cheering a smoke ass, we don't play games round here  
Everybody living wild, nobody tame round here  
On they click em juice, with evil in they brain round here  
Since the turn of the century, it ain't been the same round here  
Must be a soldier or get voted, just to claim round here  
Some people, say we a fashion show  
Don't let the Screw tapes fool you, cause we be blasting hoe  
This is what it sounds like, when we ride on our enemies  
Houston Texas, we pulling negative energy

[Z-Ro]  
Be all up in my face, when I be sanging that song  
But when haters be up in my face, I be swanging that dome  
Because patience is a virtue, that I don't have  
And you a fool, if you thinking that I won't jab  
I hate the world, is the kind of attitude I got  
But I could justify reasons, for any dude I shot  
So I never be watching my back, Jehovah do it for me  
I'm not a criminal, just trying to keep t-bone in my tummy  
I'm as good, as the best of them  
Or as bad, as the worst  
Lil' fella you can find out, don't make me have to pull my iron out  
I do my dirt but I hide it, like a bottle of Zydine
