Don't cry sister cry, it'll be alright in the morning  
Don't cry sister cry, everything'll be just fine  
Don't cry sister cry, it'll be alright, I tell you no lie  
Don't cry sister cry, don't do it, don't do it  
  
When old man trouble knocks on your door  
Don't give him no key, he just wants more  
He'll turn your life to misery  
Kick you down, just like me  
  
Don't cry sister cry, it'll be alright, it'll be alright  
Don't cry sister cry, everything'll be just fine  
  
Woke downhearted and you feel so bad  
Somebody wants something of nothing you had  
Love don't come too easy, you see  
A little bit of you and a little bit of me  
  
Don't cry sister cry, it'll be alright, it'll be alright  
Don't cry sister cry, everything'll be just fine  
Everything'll be just fine  
Everything'll be just fine  
  
Don't cry sister cry, don't do it, don't do it  
Don't cry sister cry, don't do it, don't do it
