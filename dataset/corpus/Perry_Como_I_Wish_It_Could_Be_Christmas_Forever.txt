I wish it could be Christmas forever,  
I wish that glow would never fade away!  
With friends and loved ones near us,  
'Round the Christmas tree so tall,  
We hear the church bells ringing,  
Dear Lord, bless us one and all!  
  
I know I'd be content now and forever,  
If those Christmas lights would sparkle every day,  
There'd be candy canes and mistletoe,  
Children singing carols we know (singing carols we know,)  
If love and peace on earth would always stay,  
I know it could be Christmas every day!
