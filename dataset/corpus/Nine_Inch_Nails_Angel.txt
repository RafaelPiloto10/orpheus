I've tried to take this all just one step at a time,  
I'd love to reason but I'll end this waver signed.  
'Cause it's so lonely I feel like I have died  
I thought angels never learned to say goodbye  
  
Angel  
  
I've felt emotions like I've never felt before  
Felt such devotion that it's spilt upon the floor  
Now I'm so empty there's nothing left to hide  
I thought angels never learned to say goodbye  
  
I've got to find you, and remind you how it is  
My life's been shattered but inside I've found love exists  
Now I'm so frightened, Im so afraid to die  
I thought angels never learned to say goodbye.  
Bye bye,  
Bye bye.  
  
Angel, Angel.  
Now I'm so lonely, I'm so afraid to die.  
'Cause I know that all the angels say goodbye  
Angel  
Angel  
Bye bye, Angel.  
Bye bye.
