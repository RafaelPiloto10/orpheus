[Chorus]  
You could meet somebody, you never know  
From brief encounters habits grow  
Into giant oaks that hide the sun  
Life in the shadows ain't no fun  
  
It's easy getting up there  
Never think of coming down  
Not hard to say 'I want you'  
When you're floating on a cloud  
But you know that lonely feeling  
When nothing's going right  
'Cause it's only the beginning  
Of a cold and sleepless night  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You could meet somebody, you never know  
From brief encounters habits grow  
Into giant oaks that hide the sun  
Your only chance is to turn and run  
  
It's harder getting up there  
And it's painful coming down  
And now you can't see clearly  
Beneath the thunder cloud  
And the loneliness gets longer  
When nothing's going right  
And things ain't getting any better  
With another sleepless night  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You could meet somebody, you never know  
From brief encounters habits grow  
Into giant oaks that hide the sun  
Your only chance is to turn and run
