Baby let's pretend  
We're just kids, seventeen again  
Don't let anyone know  
Hold on tight and let's just let it go  
This ain't just a kiss we're stealing  
Let's take our time and chase this feeling  
  
Nowhere to be and all night to get there  
All night-breathing the same air  
Real close and real slow baby  
Just you and me and love laying right here  
Sunset watching us disappear  
We can do anything I don't care  
We've got nowhere to be and all  
Night to get there  
  
Secret hideaway  
Twilight choir in a serenade  
The whole world's spinning so fast  
Let's jump off and let it roll right past us  
We can stay this way forever  
Getting gone-getting lost together  
  
Nowhere to be and all night to get there  
All night-breathing the same air  
Real close and real slow baby  
Just you and me and love laying right here  
Sunset watching us disappear  
We can do anything-I don't care  
We've got nowhere to be and all  
Night to get there  
  
Nowhere to be and all night to get there  
All night-breathing the same air  
Real close and real slow baby  
Just you and me and love laying right here  
Sunset watching us disappear  
We can do anything-I don't care  
We've got nowhere to be and all  
Night to get there  
  
Nowhere to be and all night to get there
