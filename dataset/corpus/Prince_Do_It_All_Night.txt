Pardon me, I want to talk to you  
I may be kinda shy But I just gotta tell you  
What I'm going to do  
Someone over there says He wants to get to know you  
I don't care 'cause  
I really want to hold you  
And I'm so scared  
(he might do something)  
To you that you like  
Now I've been waiting  
Such a bloody long time  
Just to get this close to you  
Now that you're near me  
I want you to hear me  
I'll tell you what I want to do  
Oh, I want to do it  
Do it all night  
I want to do it  
Do it to you right  
Giving up so easy  
Is something that I never do  
But I'm so easy, so easy  
When it comes to loving you Can't you understand that I want  
To hug and kiss you  
I'll do anything I can just  
To give you happiness  
And I drown, baby, drown, baby  
In your arms, c'mon baby  
Can't you get to this?  
I've been waiting such a bloody long time  
And you're talking to someone else  
Now that I've got your attention  
There's something I want to mention  
  
I want to do it  
Do it all night  
I want to do it, oh yeah  
Do it to you right  
Do it all night  
I,I want to do it, oh yeah  
Do it to you right  
  
I want to do it  
Do it all night  
I want to do it, oh yeah  
Do it to you right  
  
Gotta do it, do it  
Do it all night  
Do it to you right  
  
Do it all night  
Do it to you right
