Born in the night  
She would run like a leopard  
That freaks at the sight  
Of a mind close beside herself  
And the nearer I came  
How the country would change  
She was using the landscape  
To hide herself.  
  
More in the mind  
Than the body this feeling  
A sense at the end  
Of a circular line  
That is drawn at an angle  
I see when I'm with you  
To navigate waters and finally answer to-yes.  
  
If you were there you would want to be near me  
Innocence, you could hold all the materials  
And though nothing would really be living  
It would shock Your fall into landing light  
In the north sky time flies fast to the morning  
The cold of the dawn it meant nothing to us  
You were keeping your best situation  
An answer to-yes  
  
(Yes, Yes) And the moment I see you  
(Yes, Yes) It's so good to be near you  
(Yes, Yes) And the feeling you give me  
(Yes, Yes) Makes me want to be with you  
(Yes, Yes) From the moment you tell me - yes  
  
If you could see all the roads I have travelled  
Towards some unusable last equilibrium  
Run like an athlete and die like a dead beaten speed-freak  
An answer to all of your answers to-yes  
  
In the north sky time flies faster than morning  
The cold of the dawn it meant nothing to us  
You were keeping your best situation  
An answer to Yes  
  
(Yes, Yes) And the moment I see you  
(Yes, Yes) It's so good to be near you  
(Yes, Yes) And the feeling you give me  
(Yes, Yes) Makes me want to be with you  
(Yes, Yes) If we wait for an answer  
(Yes, Yes) Will the silence be broken  
(Yes, Yes) Should we wait for an answer  
(Yes, Yes) Do we leave it unspoken  
  
(Yes Yes Yes Yes . . .)
