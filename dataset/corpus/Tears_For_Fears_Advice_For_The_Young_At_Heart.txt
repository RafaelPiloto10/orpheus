While they play mothers and fathers  
We play little boys and girls

Happy in our make believe  
Soon...  
And with the hounds at bay  
I'll call your bluff  
Cause it would be okay  
To walk on tiptoes everyday  
And when I think of you and all the love that's due  
I'll make a promise, I'll make a stand  
Cause to these big brown eyes, this comes as no surprise  
We've got the whole wide world in our hands
