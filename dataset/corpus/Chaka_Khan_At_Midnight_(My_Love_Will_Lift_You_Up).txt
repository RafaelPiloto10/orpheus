You said you won't  
I bet my neck, I bet you will  
I'm gonna check my love  
You I'm gonna thrill  
Can't imagine what you've missed  
Can't go on  
Meet me at midnight in the light that starts the love  
  
CHORUS:  
Since there's was you  
I changed my mind about it all  
Instead of goin' on  
I'm gonna settle for a fall  
My love, my love will lift you up, up, up  
  
You came into my life and now I realize  
Today we love, we might, but it is for sure at midnight  
  
CHORUS  
  
You came into my life and now I realize  
Today we love, we might, but it is for sure at midnight  
At midnight, at midnight, at midnight
