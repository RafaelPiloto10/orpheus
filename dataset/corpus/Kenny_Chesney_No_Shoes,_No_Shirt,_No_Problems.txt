I've been up to my neck  
Workin' six days a week.  
Wearin' holes in the soles  
Of the shoes on my feet.  
Been dreamin' of gettin' away  
Since I don't know.  
Ain't no better time than now for Mexico  
  
[Chorus]  
No shoes, no shirt, and no problems  
Blues, what blues?  
Hey I forgot 'em.  
The sun and the sand,  
And a drink in my hand with no bottom,  
And no shoes, no shirt, and no problems,  
No problems.  
  
Want a towel on a chair  
In the sand by the sea,  
Want to look through my shades,  
And see you there with me.  
Want to soak up life for a while,  
In laid back mode.  
No boss, no clock, no stress, no dress code  
  
No shoes, no shirt, no problems  
Blues, what blues?  
Hey I forgot 'em.  
The sun and the sand,  
And a drink in my hand with no bottom,  
And no shoes, no shirt, and no problems,  
  
Babe lets get packed  
Tank tops and flip flops,  
If you got 'em.  
And no shoes, and no shirt, and no problems,  
No problems.
