You and me  
We have no faces  
Soon our lives they'll be erased  
Do you think they will remember?  
Or will we just be replaced  
Oh I wish that I could see,  
How I wish that I could fly  
All the things that hang above me  
To a place where I can cry  
So what can it be?  
No one hears me call,  
Echoes back at me  
No ones there.  
  
To all these nameless feelings  
I can't deal with in my life  
To all these greedy people  
Trying to feed on what is mine  
You've got to fill your hunger  
And stop fucking with my mind  
I know its time to leave these places far behind  
You and me  
We have no faces  
They don't see us anymore  
  
Without love as they had promised  
And no faith for what's in store  
Oh I wish that I could see  
How I wish that I could fly  
All the things that hang above me  
To a place where I can cry  
So what can it be?  
No one hears me call,  
Echoes back at me  
No ones there.  
  
To all these nameless feelings  
I can't deal with in my life  
To all these greedy people  
Trying to feed on what is mine  
You've got to fill your hunger  
And stop fucking with my mind  
I know its time to leave these places far behind  
Where are all these feelings hiding?  
  
Dancing in and out my mind  
Burning up all that I long for  
Feeding me till my decline  
Where are you? My soul is bleeding  
I am searching am I blind?  
All alone and bound forever  
Trapped inside me for all time  
To all these nameless feelings  
I can't deal with in my life  
To all these greedy people  
Trying to feed on what is mine  
You've got to fill your hunger  
And stop fucking with my mind  
I know its time to leave these places far behind  
I know its time to leave these places far behind
