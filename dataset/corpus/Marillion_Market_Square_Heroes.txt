I found smog at the end of my rainbow  
I found my thoughts shift slowly into phase  
Declared the constitution of the walkway  
I realise it's time to plan the day, the day  
  
I'm a market square hero gathering the storms to troop  
Cause I'm a market square hero speeding the beat of the streetpulse  
Are you following me, are you following me?  
Well suffer my pretty warriors and follow me  
  
I got a golden handshake that nearly broke my arm  
I left the ranks of shuffling graveyard people  
I got rust upon my hands from the padlocked factory gates  
Silent chimneys provide the silent steeples  
  
Cause I'm a market square hero gathering the storms to troop  
Cause I'm a market square hero speeding the beat of the streetpulse, the
streetpulse  
Are you following me? Are you following me?  
Well suffer my pretty children and follow me, follow me  
  
Change, change, change!  
Change, change, change!  
  
I am your antichrist show me allegiance  
Are you following me  
I am your antichrist pledge to me defiance  
Are you following me  
Suffer my pretty warriors  
Suffer my fallen child  
Are you following me  
The time has come to conquer and I'll provide your end  
Suffer!  
We march!  
  
I give peace signs when I wage war in the disco  
I'm the warrior in the ultra violet haze  
Armed with antisocial insecurity  
I plan the path of destiny from this maze  
  
Cause I'm a market square hero gathering the storms to troop  
Cause I'm a market square hero speeding the beat of the streetpulse, the
streetpulse  
Are you following me? Are you following me?  
Well suffer my fallen angels and follow me  
  
I'm the market square hero  
I'm the market square hero  
We're market square heroes  
We're the market square heroes  
Are you following me?  
  
I'm the market square hero!
