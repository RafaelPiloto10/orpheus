Day after day I keep waking up  
To find that you're slipping away  
Night after night  
I can't fight the emptiness inside  
Nothing I can say  
Now I know you're turning me away  
You're wearing a disguise  
You don't have to hide cause  
The truth is in your eyes tonight  
  
I don't want to live a lie  
But I don't want to say goodbye  
And I can't let you go even though it's over  
I just can't let you go  
Though your love is growing colder  
  
One look in my eyes and you'd realize  
That you got my heart in your hands  
Won't you let me know something more  
Where did we go wrong?  
  
I don't want to fight  
All I want to do is try to understand  
I'm reaching out for you babe  
What can I do  
I've been holding on so long  
I don't want to live a lie  
But I don't want to say goodbye  
I can't let you go  
Even though it's over  
I just can't let you go  
I feel your love is growing colder  
I don't want to live a lie  
But I don't want to say goodbye  
I want you by my side  
And I can't let you go  
Even though it's over  
I just can't let you go  
I feel your love is growing colder  
I can't let you go even though it's over
