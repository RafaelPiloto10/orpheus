Meglio stasera  
Baby go go go  
Or as we natives say  
"Fa subito!"  
If you're ever gonna kiss me  
It had better be tonight  
While the mandolins are playing  
And stars are bright  
If you've anything to tell me  
It had better be tonight  
Or somebody else may tell me  
And whisper the words just right  
Meglio stasera  
Baby go go go  
Or as we natives say  
"Fa subito!"  
If you're ever gonna hold me  
It had better be tonight  
Or somebody else might hold me  
And make me feel just right  
For this poor Americano  
Who knows little of your speech  
Meglio stasera  
Baby go go go  
Or as we natives say  
"Fa subito!"  
Be a nice Italiano  
And start to teach  
Show me how in old Milano  
Lovers hold each other tight  
But I want you sweet paesano  
It had better be tonight  
Meglio stasera  
Baby go go go  
Or as we natives say  
"Fa subito!"
