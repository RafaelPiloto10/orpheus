Well I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry,  
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky.  
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you big river,  
And I'm a gonna sit right here until I die.  
  
I met her accidentally in st. Paul, Minnesota,  
She tore me up everything I heard her drawl, that southern drawl.  
Well I heard my dream went back downstream, cavortin' in davenport,  
And I follow you big river when you called.  
  
Well I followed her down to st. Louie, later on down the river,  
Trader said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she's gone.  
Well I followed her down to Memphis, but she just walked off the bus,  
She raised a few eyebrows and she went on down alone.  
  
Well I've gotten on down to baton rouge, river queen roll on,  
Take that woman down to new Orleans, new Orleans.  
I give up, I've had enough, followed my blues on down to the gulf,  
She loves you big river more than me.
