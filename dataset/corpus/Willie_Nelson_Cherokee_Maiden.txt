One night when the moon was bright on the moonlit bay  
That is where I found my little Cherokee maid  
The memory of the that night of love is lingering yet  
And I know I never will forget  
  
My little Cherokee Maiden, I love her so  
And though we're far apart  
I know I'll never be tradin' my love for her  
For anybody else's heart  
  
Someday I'll make a trip back to that Cherokee Strip  
And I'll carry her away with me  
And straight as an arrow flies, we'll ride to paradise  
My sweet little chickadee, my little Cherokee Maiden and me  
  
My little Cherokee Maiden, I love her so  
And though we're far apart  
I know I'll never be tradin' my love for her  
For anybody else's heart  
  
Someday I'll make a trip back to that Cherokee Strip  
And I'll carry her away with me  
And straight as an arrow flies, we'll ride to paradise  
My sweet little chickadee, my little Cherokee Maiden and me  
  
My little Cherokee Maiden, I love her so  
And though we're far apart  
I know I'll never be tradin' my love for her  
For anybody else's heart  
  
Someday I'll make a trip back to that Cherokee Strip  
And I'll carry her away with me  
And straight as an arrow flies, we'll ride to paradise  
My sweet little chickadee, my little Cherokee Maiden and me
