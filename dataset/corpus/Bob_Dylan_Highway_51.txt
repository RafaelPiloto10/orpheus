Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door  
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door  
If I don't get the girl I'm loving  
Won't go down to Highway 51 no more.  
  
Well, I know that highway like I know my hand  
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand  
Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land.  
  
Well, if I should die before my time should come  
And if I die before my time should come  
Won't you bury my body out on the Highway 51.  
  
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door  
I said, Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door  
If I don't get the girl I'm loving  
Won't go own to Highway 51 no more.
