Some guys-ooh,they're really something  
They're always acting like they're so hot  
And you-you don't seem any different  
I keep a wishin' but I guess you're not  
You wanna what?I don't think so  
I don't waste my time on guys like that  
You might be tough  
But that's not enough to make it last  
You wanna what?  
Those eyes-ooh,I see right through'em  
The way you stare gives you away  
Don't even go there-ooh,you just don't get it  
Real love can't be that way  
You wanna what?I don't think so  
I don't waste my time on guys like that  
You might be tough  
But that's not enough to make it last  
You wanna what?  
Ooh,don't you think you oughta be ashamed  
Ooh,I hate to tell you I don't play that game  
You wanna what?I don't think so  
I don't waste my time on guys like that  
You might be tough  
But that's not enough to make it last  
You wanna what?  
You wanna what?I don't think so  
I don't waste my time on guys like that  
You might be tough  
But that's not enough to make it last  
You wanna what?
