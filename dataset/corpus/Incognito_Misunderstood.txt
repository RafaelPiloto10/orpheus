Rejection tars the roads where I have been  
Still I'm holding on to the same dream  
Came through fire and the pouring rain  
To be told that I'm the one to blame  
  
[Chorus]  
Misunderstood  
(Never thought that I would)  
Didn't know that I could be  
(Misunderstood)  
Misunderstood  
(Never thought that I would)  
Didn't know that I could be  
(Misunderstood)  
  
They're chasing shadows and they'll never know  
The truth about us and their fears will grow  
Only we know what has not been told  
We'll meet in secret in the fields of gold  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So now they come to see me cry  
Too late now, the well's run dry  
I know they think I'm putting chains on you  
Let the fools believe, it's what they want to do  
  
[Chorus]
