I know you told me, long time ago  
That you didn't want me, yeah  
You didn't love me no more  
  
But I know it was something, oh, that made me blue  
But believe me, child, I've been a fool for you  
I've been a big fool for you  
  
I know you told me, yeah  
You didn't want me around  
And don't you have a big old man right there  
In a port, man, away across town  
  
And I know it's something that makes me blue  
Believe me child, I've been a fool for you  
I've been a fool for you  
  
Now did you ever wake up in the morning  
Just about the break of day, yeah, uh  
Reach over an feel your pillow, wow wow wow wow wow

Ever since I was five years old, baby

Way down, deep down in my soul, oh
