I am cow hear me moo  
I weigh twice as much as you  
And I look good on the barbecue  
Yogurt, curd, cream cheese, and butter's  
made from liquid from my udders  
I am cow, I am cow, hear me moo!  
  
I am cow, eating grass  
methane gas comes out my ass  
and out my muzzle when I belch  
o the ozone layer is thinner  
from the outcome of my dinner  
I am cow, I am cow, I've got gas  
  
I am cow, here I stand  
far and wide upon this land  
and I am living everywhere  
from B.C. to Newfoundland  
You can squeeze my teats by hand  
I am cow, I am cow, I am cow  
I am cow, I am cow, I am cow!
