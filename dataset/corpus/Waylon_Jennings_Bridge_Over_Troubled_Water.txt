[ with Jessi Colter ]  
When you're weary feeling small when tears are in your eyes I'll dry them all  
I'm on your side oh when times get rough and friends just can't be found  
Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down  
Like a bridge over troubled waters I will lay me down  
[ guitar ]  
When you're down and out when you're on the street  
When evening falls so hard I will comfort you  
I'll take your part when darkness comes and pain is all around  
Like a bridge over troubled water I will lay me down  
Like a bridge over troubled waters I will lay me down  
[ ac.guitar ]  
Sail on silver girl sail on by your time has come to shine  
All the dreams are on their way  
See how they shine if you need a friend I'm sailing out behind  
Like a bridge over troubled water I will lead your mind  
Like a bridge over troubled water I will lead your mind
