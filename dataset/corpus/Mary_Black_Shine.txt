I can see it in your eyes  
What I know in my heart is true  
That our love it has faded like the summer run through  
So we walk doen the shore line one last time together  
Feel the wind blow our wandering hearts like a feather  
But who knows who's waiting in the wings of time  
Dry your eyes  
We're gonna go where we can shine  
  
Don't be hiding in sorrow or clinging to the past  
With your beauty so precious and the seasons so fast  
No matter how cold the horizon appears or how far the first night when I held
you near  
You've gotta rise from these ashes like a bird of flame  
Take my hand  
We're gonna go where we can shine  
  
For all that we struggle for all we pretend  
It don't come down to nothing except love in the end  
And ours is a road that is strewn with goodbyes  
But as it unfolds as it all unwinds  
Remember your soul is the one thing you just can't compromise  
Step out of the shadows  
  
You gotta go where we can shine  
Oh we're gonna go where we can shine  
Shine
