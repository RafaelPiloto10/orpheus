Disconnected, it's the way that I wanted it to be  
The Cult Electric is my favorite record of the week  
Cause I'm not feeling sweet  
  
But I can't say that when everyone is so judgmental  
And I can't play back all the times when you were gentle  
Cause even you can't be true  
  
It's astounding what love can do to a city  
Laurel Canyon was the best place for you and me to be  
I chose the curtains and I dreamed a dream of domesticity  
What a freak you made of me  
  
Now I'm on Zoloft because you told me I was crazy  
And I won't jump cause now I know you'd never catch me  
And I can't leave you because you swore you'd never let me  
But even you, talk shit too.  
  
It's January when I jumped the fence of your backyard  
Finish the fairy tale that you weren't drunk enough to start  
It's kind of scary when your lover leaves you for a movie star  
But I'm still in the dark  
  
But you have trained to watch my back and drop my standards  
And you have shamed me since the first time you were with her  
And you can't make me love your band or buy your records  
Cause you have tainted my respect for your adventures  
  
And you will never have the chance to trace my features  
And you will never make me feel like such a loser  
And you can have the past 'cause I'm in love with the future  
  
I'm in love with the future  
  
And I have met a boy  
Who makes you look so shallow (I'm in love with the future)  
And there is so much time  
And so much space to travel (I'm in love with the future)  
And I will make the climb and I will kiss the gravel (I'm in love with the  
Future)  
  
(Touch the sky) (It's kinda scary)  
And I will kiss the gravel (I'm in love with the future)  
  
(Touch the sky) (It's kinda scary)  
And I will kiss the gravel  
  
I'll touch the sky  
I'll touch the sky  
Watch me, watch me  
I'll touch the sky  
I'll touch  
The sky, the sky
