I opened my eyes last night  
And saw you in the low light  
Walking down by the bay  
On the shore,  
Staring up at the stars, that aren't there anymore  
I was feeling the night grow old  
And you were looking so cold  
So like an introvert  
I drew my over shirt  
Around my arms and began, to shiver violently before  
You happened to look  
And see the tunnels all around me  
Running into the dark  
Underground  
All the subways around, create a great sound  
To my motion fatigue  
Farewell  
With your ear to a seashell  
You can hear the waves in underwater caves  
As if you actually were inside a saltwater room  
  
Time together isn't never quite enough  
When you and I are alone, I've never felt so at home  
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?  
Only time, only time  
  
Can you believe that the crew has gone  
And wouldn't let me sign on?  
All my islands have sunk  
In the deep,  
And I can hardly relax or even oversleep  
But I feel more with your hand  
In mine  
When we walk on the shore line  
I guess we'll never know, why sparrows love the snow  
We'll turn off all of the lights and set this ballroom aglow  
  
So tell me darling do you wish we'd fall in love?  
(Yeah all the time) all the time  
Time together isn't never quite enough  
When you and I are alone, I've never felt so at home  
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?  
Only time, only time  
When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?  
If this is what I call home, why does it feel so alone?  
So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?  
All the time, all the time  
  
Time together isn't never quite enough  
When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?  
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?  
So tell me darling do you wish we'd fall in love?  
All the time,  
All the time
