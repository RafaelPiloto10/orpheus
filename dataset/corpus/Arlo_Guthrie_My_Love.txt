My love, you're like the wind on the run  
I never know where you are coming from  
I wasn't easily won  
My love I saw you first long ago  
I didn't think then, now I know  
How long it took love to grow  
Oh babe, I long to hold you at night  
We two together are so right  
You make the darkness so bright  
My love, we've had one hell of a time  
And we've got over our crying  
And we've come out of this fine  
Because when two loves grow old  
There can be no denying  
That their love may soon grow colder  
Yet that's when we started trying  
Oh babe, this love we have must be for real  
We've overcome, now it's sealed  
I know if something you feel  
My love, you're like the wind on the run  
I didn't know where you were coming from  
I wasn't easily won
