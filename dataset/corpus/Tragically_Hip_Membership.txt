Whether laying down yourself beside it  
Or slipping into its cool and rushing effects  
Or drifting on it to where it broadens  
Your admiration for, for its more elusive aspects  
  
Being drawn along by it  
Carried under carried away  
By its long-term membership  
  
By the time the ice-huts hit the bottom  
We were already home in bed  
The most worthy men and the fiercest architects  
Couldn't fight the current they couldn't save, They couldn't save the sheds  
  
Being drawn along by it  
Carried under carried away  
By its long-term membership  
  
Bring on the springtime bring on the houseflies  
Bring on the butterscotch river overspilling its banks  
If you got you some withering power to amuse  
You'll find its greatest frustration has its entertaining value  
  
Being drawn along by it  
Carried under carried away  
By its long-term membership  
  
River wide  
River wonder us
