When you're nothing to no one  
And you're less than you can  
And you're looking for someone  
Who won't cling to anything  
So you're stuck in some motel  
With the sound of her sleeping  
Don't you feel kinda old now  
Well ain't that a funny thing  
I used to wake up early  
I used to try to believe  
But life seems neverending  
When you're young  
So you're back on the highway  
And there's wind in her hair  
And you know that it's no time for thinking  
About somebody up there  
'Cause you'll turn her to drinking  
And you'll lead her to hell  
With her bottle beside her  
She surely looks like an angel  
I used to wake up early  
I used to try to believe  
But faith is never easy  
When you're young  
No no no  
I used to wake up early  
Now it's hard, hard enough to sleep  
But life seems neverending  
When you're young  
Oh no no no no
