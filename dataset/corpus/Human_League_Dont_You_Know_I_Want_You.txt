It's a beautiful night  
A cool breeze in the air  
Got the keys to my car  
But I don't want to go nowhere  
  
I'm not at all bored  
But I've plenty of time to spare  
There's only one thing that I know  
Would take me there  
  
I've got one thing to say to you  
I guess you just don't realize  
When you see me look at me  
There's more than friendship in my eyes  
  
Don't you know I want you  
Don't you know I want you  
You can really get a buzz  
Hanging out with the cool and free  
  
You can act like a monarch  
Or a pillar of the bourgeoisie  
Anything you want to do  
I'm never going to disagree  
  
But I've got a point of view  
How about a little sympathy  
I've got one thing to say to you  
I guess you just don't realize  
  
When you see me look at me  
There's more than friendship in my eyes  
  
Don't you know I want you  
Don't you know I want you  
Don't you know I want you  
Don't you know I want you  
Don't you know I want you  
Don't you know I want you
