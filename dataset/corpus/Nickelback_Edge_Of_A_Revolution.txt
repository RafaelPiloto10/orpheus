Head high, protest line  
Freedom scribbled on your sign  
Headline, New York Times  
Standing on the edge of a revolution  
  
Hey, hey, just obey  
Your secret's safe with the nsa  
In God we trust or the cia  
Standing on the edge of a revolution  
  
Yeah, we're standing on the edge of a revolution  
Revolution, revolution, revolution  
  
No we won't give up, we won't go away  
Cause we're not about to live in this mass delusion  
No we don't want to hear another word you say  
Cause we know you're all depending on mass confusion  
No we can't turn back, we can't turn away  
Cause this time we are relying on the lost solution  
No we won't lay down and accept this fate  
Cause we're standing on the edge of a revolution  
  
Wall Street, common thief  
When they get caught they all go free  
A brand new yacht and a finders fee  
Standing on the edge of a revolution  
  
Same shit, different day  
Can't keep fed if I can't get paid  
We'll all be dead if the ship don't change  
Standing on the edge of a revolution  
  
Yeah, we're standing on the edge of a revolution  
Revolution, revolution, revolution  
  
No we won't give up, we won't go away  
Cause we're not about to live in this mass delusion  
No we don't want to hear another word you say  
Cause we know you're all depending on mass confusion  
No we can't turn back, we can't turn away  
Cause this time we are relying on the lost solution  
No we won't lay down and accept this fate  
Cause we're standing on the edge of a revolution
