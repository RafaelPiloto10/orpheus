[Verse 1]  
This time she's really out my life, oh  
I know I gotta get her back  
Just need one night to hit it right  
But I can't get her alone, no  
Know she deserves to up and leave  
If it was me I'd do the same  
I see that girl, know that she hopes  
So I'll be damned to let it go, damned to let it go  
  
[Chorus]  
I discover, discover I love her  
Oh, I gotta get her back, oh  
I discover, discover that I love her  
Ooh, that would get her back  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'm guessing this is where it ends (You don't even pick up for a nigga)  
I know she's calling all her friends (And they don't like me, fuck y'all
bitches)  
They probably tryna take her out (All up in the VIP so they can take a
picture)  
And tryna find her ass a man, shit, make a nigga mad  
Cause she know I'm hurting, she know that I'm hurting  
Yeah she know I care, she know that I care  
I can't understand, know I treat you bad  
But you don't get me back like that, no, no  
Oh, oh, I gotta get my baby, girl don't leave me  
All this crazy shit that you been dealing with it, you probably hate me, hey  
Cause baby if you cheated, I couldn't handle that  
To know that another nigga is making you smile like  
  
[Chorus]  
I discover, discover I love her  
Oh, I gotta get her back, woah yeah  
I discover, discover that I love her  
Ooh, that would get her back  
  
[Bridge]  
I can't breathe, yeah  
Can't breathe, can't breathe, yeah  
Girl let me breathe again, breathe again  
Let me breathe again, oh  
I can't breath, can't sleep  
Can't dream, so weak, girl  
Gotta get you back, gotta get you back  
Can't think, oh gee  
  
[Chorus]  
I discover, discover I love her  
Oh, I gotta get her back, oh  
I discover, discover that I love her  
Ooh, that would get her back  
  
[Outro]  
Get you back oh, get you back oh  
Can't think girl, oh gee oh, gee oh
