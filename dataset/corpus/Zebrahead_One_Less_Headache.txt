Well it's just a simple fact I  
Need to have another drink or two to move on  
And then ya won't matter at all  
Well it's just a simple fact I  
Need to lose you as a ball and chain and move on  
And then ya won't matter at all  
Wanted to believe  
Wanted to believe in something  
Now you're one less headache left at home  
Wanted to believe  
Wanted to believe in something  
Now you're one less headache left at home  
And now all that's left is  
Shattered glass and some broken dreams for all  
It really doesn't matter at all  
Now that it's all said and done I  
Had to have another drink for you and move on  
And now you don't matter at all  
Wanted to believe  
Wanted to believe in something  
Now you're one less headache left at home  
Wanted to believe  
Wanted to believe in something  
Now you're one less headache left at home  
Wanted to believe  
Wanted to believe in something  
Now you're one less headache left at home  
Wanted to believe  
Wanted to believe in something  
Now you're one less headache left at home  
Left at home  
Believe in something  
Now you're one less headache left at home
