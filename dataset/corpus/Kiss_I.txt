I was so frightened  
I almost ran away  
I didn't know that I could do  
Anything I needed to  
  
And then a bolt of lightning  
Hit me on my head  
Then I began to see  
I just needed to believe in me  
  
Now I, I believe in me  
And I, I believe in something more  
Than you can understand  
Yes, I believe in me  
  
They said I didn't stand a chance  
I wouldn't win no way  
But I've got news for you  
There's nothing I can't do  
  
Ain't no pretending  
Ain't no make believe  
But I've got to be the one  
I gotta do what must be done  
  
Now I, I believe in me  
And I, I believe in something more  
Than you can understand  
Yes, I believe in me  
  
I believe in me  
Yes, I believe in me - yeah  
  
I don't need no money  
I don't need no fame...no  
I just need to believe in me  
And I know most definitely  
  
Don't need to get wasted  
It only holds me down  
I just need a will of my own  
And the balls to stand alone  
  
Now I, I believe in me  
And I, I believe in something more  
Than you can understand  
Yes, I believe in me  
Well do you really  
Yes, I believe in me  
Do you do you  
Yes, I believe in me  
I want to rock 'n roll  
Yes, I believe in me!  
  
Morpheus, you have been summoned here to offer your judgment of the boy  
Do you still deem him worthy of the Fellowship?  
I certainly do, my lord.  
As a matter of fact, I, I think you're going like this one. He's got the light
in his eyes and the look of a champion,  
A real champion...
