Hear me now!  
I was born 13th child,  
'neath the 13th moon  
Spit out hungry  
And born anew  
Daddy drag me  
To the river  
Tie me in rocks  
Throw me in where  
It's deep and wide  
I go down, I don't die  
Hole  
In the river bottom,  
I crawl through  
Come back  
Kill six brothers  
And sisters,  
Kill Papa too  
Sway down Mama,  
Sway down low  
They gonna know me  
Wherever I go  
  
Into my bed  
With her kerosene  
My mama creep  
Set my flesh to burning,  
Whilst I sleep  
I burn, burn, burn,  
Till my soul burn black  
Black rains fall,  
I come back, I come back  
Get down Mama, get down low  
They gonna know me  
Wherever I go  
  
16 witches cast 16 spells  
Make me guitar outta skin  
And human skull  
Sing you a song like the wind  
In the sandy loam  
Bring you baby  
Out'cha your happy home  
  
Ram's head, forked tail,  
Clove hoof, love's my trail  
I sup on your body,  
Sip on your blood like wine  
Out world theirs,  
This world mine  
So kiss me baby  
Till it hurts  
God lost in heaven,  
We lost on earth  
Sway down Mama,  
Sway down low  
They gonna know me  
Wherever I go (yeah)  
Wherever I go (yeah),  
Wherever I go  
  
Well  
I got a brand new lover  
I love her, yes I do  
Yeah she's my one and only  
And her name is Baby Blue  
Now baby, baby, baby  
Baby, baby, baby, blue  
That's right  
Whoah, ha!  
Well now baby, baby, baby  
Baby, baby, blue
