You're a little bit shy  
A little too quiet  
You're the mixed up girl  
That everybody leaves behind  
A little bit weird  
A little too bright  
But you just might be  
That little bomb at their side  
They'll pull your hair  
They'll leave you wide-eyed  
But did anybody wonder  
What Annie might have in mind  
Oh, no  
  
There's something in the way she explains to me  
"Please be careful, I exist in someone else's head"  
Oh, no  
There's something in the way that she makes believe  
Please be careful,  
Annie dreams that everyone is dead  
  
You're a little bit dry  
A little uptight  
You're the messed up girl  
That every body tries to hide  
You've had enough  
They're too unkind  
But did anyone consider  
What Annie might have in mind  
Oh, no
