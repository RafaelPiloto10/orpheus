Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
People, always saying you're crazy, well it doesn't faze me.  
I like crazy you know.  
I love your personality, but I don't think I understand it  
You're on another planet.  
Is there room for me?  
And I don't know why,  
You do the things you do?  
But all I know is how,  
I feel when I'm alone with you.  
  
If you wanna keep running round with your head in the clouds  
Well then that's alright with me.  
You don't listen to a thing that I say.  
Just live for today.  
You know that's alright with me..  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
That's alright with me.  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
That's alright with me  
  
See I know, I know, I know they try to tame you.  
They're always trying to change you.  
But I don't wanna change a thing.  
Everybody is telling me  
'Stay away from that troublemaker' I like that kinda behavior.  
So come and make some trouble with me?  
See I don't know why? You do the things you do.  
But all I know, is how I feel when I'm alone with you.  
  
If you wanna come running round with your head in the clouds  
Well then that's alright with me.  
You don't listen to a thing that I say.  
Just live for today.  
You know that's alright with me.  
It feels like starring at the stars, to see the world from where you are.  
Take my hand and take my heart, show me how to light that spark.  
Oohhhhh.  
  
If you wanna keep running round with your head in the clouds  
Well then that's alright with me.  
You don't listen to a thing that I say.  
Just live for today.  
You know that's alright with me..  
That's alright with me.  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Well that's alright with me  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
That's alright with me
