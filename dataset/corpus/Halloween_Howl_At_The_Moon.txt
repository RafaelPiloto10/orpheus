Halloween night,  
Moon shining bright.  
You'll see such an amazing sight.  
All of the wolves gather 'round.  
They make a very sad and lonely sound.  
  
Sadder than the wind through the trees,  
It puts a lot of little goose bumps on me.  
When the wolves sing their song,  
They want you to sing along and...  
  
Howl at the moon.  
Howl at the moon.  
Howl at the moon.  
Howl at the moon.  
  
They come from miles and miles away...  
Howl at the moon.  
Howl at the moon.  
Howl at the moon.  
Howl at the moon.  
They sing all night till the moon sinks low,...  
  
Howl at the moon.  
Howl at the moon.  
Howl at the moon.  
Howl at the moon.
