Well I woke up this morning  
Grey dawn  
With a prayer on my breath  
See I lost something precious  
And God'll save me  
From losing myself  
I said I think I know what's wrong  
I think I know what's wrong  
  
Now I met the queen and I understand why  
Why she closed the door  
I'm not making excuses  
But you know I've been there a few times  
You know I was  
I was knocking on the door  
I said I think I know what's wrong  
I think I know what's wrong  
Wrong wrong  
  
There's a man  
He lived in a house  
Had a family of five  
Well he blew up the windows and the doors  
He said "I just couldn't  
I just couldn't survive"  
We've all been removed  
In one way or another  
We don't know our families  
We don't need our brothers  
We're pushing the needle too far  
Pushing the needle too far  
  
Well if you wake up in the morning  
Grey dawn  
There's a prayer on your breath  
See maybe you lost something precious  
God'll save you  
From losing yourself  
I said I think I know what's wrong  
Let me hear you  
I think I know what's wrong  
  
There's queen who closed the door  
The family that lies  
People who turn  
The cat that has died  
A boy that odds  
A girl with a gun  
The world on its knees  
And a band on the run  
You know you'd help me more  
(The queen who closed the door)  
By not giving in  
(The family that lies)  
You know you'd help me more  
(People who turn)  
By not giving in  
(And the cat that has died)  
You know you'd help me more  
(A boy that odds)  
By not giving in  
(And a girl with a gun)  
I said you'd help me more  
(The world on it's knees)  
Now don't you give in  
(And a band on the run)  
Ah now you'd help me more  
By not giving  
I said don't you dare  
(Not giving in no)  
Don't you dare  
(Not giving in no)  
Don't you dare  
You'd help me more  
By not giving in  
I said you'd help me more  
By not giving in  
I said I  
I think I know what's wrong  
I think I know what's wrong  
We're pushing the needle too far
