From the snow-capped mountains to the coral shores  
You're the only one my heart adores  
You've only got three competitors  
Tacos, enchiladas and beans  
  
From the Mississippi to the Amazon  
There's not much we don't agree upon  
Wish we could get together on  
Tacos, enchiladas and beans  
  
Love 'em, dozens of 'em  
I consume them by the score  
And when I'm through, what do I do  
I stamp and holler for more  
  
You can have the fourth position on my list  
Must admit your kisses would be missed  
But how in the world could I exist  
Without tacos, enchiladas and beans  
  
(Repeat from the top)  
They make me kind of sick  
But I love them
