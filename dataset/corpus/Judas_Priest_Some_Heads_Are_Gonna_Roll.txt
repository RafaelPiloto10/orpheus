You can look to the left and  
Look to the right  
But you will live in danger tonight  
When the enemy comes he will  
Never be heard  
He'll blow your mind and not say a word  
Blinding lights, flashing colors  
Sleepless nights  
If the man with the power  
Can't keep it under control  
  
Some heads are gonna roll  
Some heads are gonna roll  
Some heads are gonna roll  
Some heads are gonna roll  
  
The power-mad freaks who are  
Ruling the earth  
Will show how little they think you're worth  
With animal lust they'll  
Devour your life  
And slice your word to bits like a knife  
One last day burning hell fire  
You're blown away  
If the man with the power  
Can't keep it under control  
  
Some heads are gonna roll  
Some heads are gonna roll  
Some heads are gonna roll  
Some heads are gonna roll  
  
Know what it's like  
When you're taken for granted  
There goes your life  
It's so underhanded  
If the man with the power  
Can't keep it under control  
  
Some heads are gonna roll  
Some heads are gonna roll  
Some heads are gonna roll  
Some heads are gonna roll
