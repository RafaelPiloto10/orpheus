Boy step a little closer  
Cause I don't think you've heard these words before (yeah)  
Lay me left and rock me right, baby lift me up so high  
Take me to another world (ye-yeah)  
  
'Cause no one else will do (woo)  
Don't wanna be by myself  
I wanna be dancing with you  
  
'Cause you're my stereo, stereo, stereo soldier  
Oh oh, oh oh  
My stereo, stereo, stereo soldier  
Oh oh, oh oh  
  
All I need is the beat in my feet, let me lose control  
Get me loud, get me now, take my heart, baby take my soul  
Right, left  
  
Run the beat and blow my speakers  
And make me feel like I'm the only girl (yeah)  
The way we move is so in time  
I'm the rare, got the skills to blow my mind  
They don't make 'em like you no more (ye-yeah)  
  
I'm in heaven now, so in love  
Lay your weapons down, and turn it up  
Up, up, up, up (wooh)  
  
And be my stereo, stereo, stereo soldier  
Oh oh, oh oh  
My stereo, stereo, stereo soldier  
Oh oh, oh oh  
  
All I need is the beat in my feet, let me lose control  
Get me loud, get me now, take my heart, baby take my soul  
Right, left  
  
Can you save me?  
Can you set me free?  
'Cause I need to feel alive  
Oh we have to survive  
  
'Cause you changed me  
And now I believe  
And I need to feel alive  
Oh we have to survive  
  
Stereo, stereo, stereo soldier  
Oh oh, oh oh  
My stereo, stereo, stereo soldier  
Oh oh, oh oh  
  
All I need is the beat in my feet, let me lose control (let me lose control)  
Get me loud, get me now, take my heart, baby take my soul  
Right, left
