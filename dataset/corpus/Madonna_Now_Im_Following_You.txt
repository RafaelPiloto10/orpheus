Lets dance, you can do a little two-step  
Ill go anywhere that you step to, cause I'm following you.  
My feet might be falling out of rhythm,  
Don't know what I'm doing with them, but I know I'm following you.  
  
Unlikely as it is to me, on the floor with two left feet  
Lets boogie woogie till our hearts skip a beat, but whos counting?  
Encore, once again around the dance floor  
Romance is in the picture too, now I'm following you.
