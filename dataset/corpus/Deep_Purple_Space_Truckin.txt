We had a lot of luck on Venus  
We always had a ball on Mars  
Meeting all the groovey people  
We've rocked the Milky Way so far  
We danced around with Borealice  
We're space truckin' round the the stars  
Come on let's go Space Truckin'  
  
Remember when we did the moonshot  
And Pony Trekker led the way  
We'd move to the Canaveral moonstop  
And everynaut would dance and sway  
We got music in our solar system  
We're space truckin' round the stars  
Come on let's go Space Truckin'  
  
The fireball that we rode was moving  
But now we've got a new machine  
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah the freaks said  
Man those cats can really swing  
They got music in their solar system  
They've rocked around the Milky Way  
They dance around the Borealice  
They're Space Truckin' everyday  
Come on
