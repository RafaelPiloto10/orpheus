Must be doin' something wrong baby I don't know  
But the gold fish are floating at the top of the bowl  
And the dog he won't eat he just lays around  
All night long he makes a lonesome sound  
  
I know I had it coming and it's all my fault  
But baby come back  
Before you kill us all  
  
The way the plants are dyin' you'd swear it's fall  
Looks just like autumn up and down the hall  
And I talk to 'em baby like you s'posed to do  
But they're tired of hearing how I'm missin' you  
  
And I know you told me not to call  
But baby come back  
Before you kill us all  
  
Well it's a desperate situation  
I got a strong will to survive  
But if this place is any indication  
I may not make it out on time  
  
Well it's an eerie feeling in the still of the night  
Knowin' that the cats down to three more lives  
You've turned as all into nervous wrecks  
We just sit around and wanderin' who's goin' to be next  
  
And I know I had it coming and it's all my fault  
But baby come back  
Before you kill us all  
  
Baby come back  
Before you kill us all  
  
Baby come back  
Baby come back  
Before you kill us all  
  
Baby come back
