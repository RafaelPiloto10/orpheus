One, two, a-one two three four  
  
I've got every reason on earth to be mad, 'cause I just lost the only girl I
had  
If I could get my way, I'd get myself locked up today, but I can't, so I'll
cry instead  
  
I've got a chp on my shoulder that's bigger that my feet  
I can't talk to people that I feet  
If I could see you now, I'd try to make you sad somehow, but I can't, so I'll
cry instead  
  
Don't want to cry when there's people there, I get shy when they start to
stare  
I'm gonna hide myself away, hey, but I'll be back again someday  
  
And when I do, you'd better hide all the girls  
'Cause I'll be breaking hearts all around the world  
Yes, I'm gonna break them in two and show you what your loving man can do  
Until then, I'll cry instead  
  
Oh I don't want to cry when there's people there, I get shy when they start to
stare  
I'm gonna hide myself away, hey, but I'll be back again someday  
  
And when I do, you'd better hide all the girls  
'Cause I'll be breaking hearts all around the world  
Yes, I'm gonna break them in two and show you what your loving man can do  
Until then, I'll cry instead... Until then, I'll cry instead... Until then,
I'll cry instead...  
  
(Thank you very much. Thank you all.)
