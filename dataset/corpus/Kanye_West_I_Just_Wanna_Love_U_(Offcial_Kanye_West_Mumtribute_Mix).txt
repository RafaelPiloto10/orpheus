[Verse 1: Ash King]  
Will you ever be the one I love  
Can you see me by you're side  
Baby you're the one I dream of  
Girl come join me on this ride  
Girl you ever see the things I see  
Baby girl come fly with me  
I just can't wait to get you on your own  
I got so much love I wanna show  
You know you got it  
And you know I want it  
I can't wait it, take it  
Baby, baby, baby...

I just wanna love you (love you love you love you love you)

Now girl I wanna know  
Can you see me in your life  
To the place where I wanna go  
Is with you in paradise  
Take my hand and I'll take yours  
Girl this love we can explore  
Look into my eyes and understand

You are my life  
I'm begging on my knees be my wife  
I know you that you can make my dreams come true  
Cause I need you and I love you  
And I'm going out of my mind  
I'm thinking of the ways to make you mine  
I will give you everything that you'll ever need  
Baby Please...
