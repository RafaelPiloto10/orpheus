(That baby doll) Oooohh!!  
(Look out for her) Ba-a-a-aby doll  
(Especially) Hmmmmmm!!  
(The amateur)  
  
There's many a guy who'll sing you these blues  
His dream was a lie, his heart's in his shoes  
He wasn't so green, in ways he was smart  
Till she hit the scene and she took him apart  
He'll tell you as plain as day  
"Keep away from ba-a-a-a-a-a-aby doll"  
  
(That baby doll)  
(Look out for her)  
  
You'll see in her eyes the warning you should  
You oughta be ooh-eyed, she'll lose you but good  
As long as she's warm, the livin' is sweet  
Then she'll raise a storm, you're back on the street  
You might as well know, my friend, that's the end  
You're cooked, you're through  
(My friend, you're through)  
(You're cooked, you're through)  
  
She was my baby doll and she'll do the same to you  
  
(That baby doll)  
(Look out for her)
