So I sing you to sleep  
After the lovin'  
With a song I just wrote yesterday  
And I hope you can hear  
What the words and the music have to say.  
  
It's so hard to explain  
Everything that I'm feelin'  
Face to face I just seem to go dry.  
'Cause I love you so much  
That the sound of your voice can get me high.  
  
Thanks for takin' me (Thanks for takin' me)  
On a one way trip to the sun (On a one way trip to the sun)  
And thanks for turnin' me (Turnin' me)  
Into a someone. (Someone)  
  
So I sing you to sleep  
After the lovin'  
I brush back the hair from your eyes.  
And the love on your face  
Is so real that it makes me want to cry.  
  
And I know that my song  
Isn't sayin' anything new.  
Oh, but after the lovin'  
I'm still in love with you.

Yes, after the lovin'  
I'm still in love with you.  
  
Hmmm, after the lovin'  
I'm still in love with you
