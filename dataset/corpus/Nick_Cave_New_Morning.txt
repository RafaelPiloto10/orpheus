One morn I awakened  
A new sun was shining  
The sky was a Kingdom  
All covered in blood  
The moon and the stars  
Where the troops that lay conquered  
Like fruit left to wither  
Poor spiritual food  
  
And the spears of bright sun  
All brave with it conquest  
Did hover unearthly  
In banners of fire  
I kneit in the garden  
Awash with the dawning  
And a voice came so brightly  
I covered my eyes  
  
Thank you for giving  
This bright new morning  
So steeped seemed the evening  
In darkness and blood  
There'll be no sadness  
There'll be no sorrow  
There'll be no road too narrow  
There'll be a new day  
And it's today  
For us
