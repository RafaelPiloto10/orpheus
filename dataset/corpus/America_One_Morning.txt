One morning when the mist came down  
I woke up early and I looked around  
My baby slept, the sky was blue  
I started walkin' thinkin' only of you  
Up the hill and down the road  
Past the people that I barely know  
Round the bend to the run-off wash  
I found a feather that a quail had lost  
Where are you goin' now my friend  
Where are you goin' now  
Are you going to see them on the mountain now  
Goin' to see them trees  
Goin' to watch the circles take a bow  
Goin' to help agree  
To be  
Today  
Some people like to play out loud  
I like them always, they're a laughing crowd  
To catch the wind then come slidin' down  
You reach the bottom fallin' upside down  
Touch a hand and see the world turnin' circles  
Brushin' every curl back again  
To those sunset walks  
That special summer and those all night talks
