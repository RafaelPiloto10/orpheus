And as I go my way alone  
I find it hard for me to carry on  
I need your warmth, I need your tender touch  
I need the love you know that I mess so much  
  
My world is empty without you babe  
My world is empty without you babe  
  
  
From this whole world I try to hide my face  
But from this loneliness there is no hiding place  
Inside this cold and empty house I dwell  
Here in the darkness, that I know so well  
  
  
My world is empty without you babe  
My world is empty without you babe  
  
  
I need your love now more than before  
I can hardly carry on anymore  
  
  
My mind and soul have felt like this  
Since love between us no more exists  
I need your warmth, I need your tender touch  
I need the love ya know I miss so much  
  
  
My world is empty without you babe  
My world is empty without you babe
