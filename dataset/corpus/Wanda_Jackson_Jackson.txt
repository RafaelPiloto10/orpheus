[ duet with Mike Post ]  
Well we got married in a fever a hotter than a pepper sprout  
We've been talkin' bout Jackson ever since the fire went out  
I'm goin' to Jackson I'm gonna mess around  
Yeah I'm goin' to Jackson look out Jackson town  
Well go on down to Jackson go ahead and wreck your health  
Go play your hand you big talkin' man make a big fool of yourself  
Yeah go to Jackson and go comb black hair please  
I'm gonna snowball Jackson ha see if I care  
When I breeze into that city people gonna stoop and bow  
All them women gonna make me teach 'em what they don't know now  
I'm goin' to Jackson you turn loose my coat  
Yeah I'm goin' to Jackson goodbye that's all she wrote  
When they laugh at you in Jackson and I'll be dancin' on the pony keg  
Hey I'll lead you round town like a scalded hound  
With your tail tucked between your legs  
Yeah go to Jackson you big talkin' man  
Cause I'll be waitin' in Jackson behind the Japan fan  
Well we got married in a fever a hotter than a pepper sprout  
We've been talkin' bout Jackson ever since the fire went out  
We're goin' to Jackson and that's a natural fact  
Yeah we're goin' to Jackson ain't never coming back  
Ain't never coming back ain't never coming back
