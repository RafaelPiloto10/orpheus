Talking: (One time only, [gulp] if you don't  
Get it right this time, tough shit, tough shit,  
Everybody ready, tell me when, say when your  
Rolling here, a one, a two, a one, two, three, die)  
  
I press my face to the window  
I ran my fingers through my hair  
I watched my life go around in a circle  
And I realized that no body but me cares  
  
And I saw the hurt of my system  
And I felt the madness of our faults conforming  
And I walked around your house for hours  
And I could feel that you had me in some kinda of stranglehold  
  
And I don't know why you said those bad things about me  
Well it must be the way of protecting some kind of crazy pride  
Yeah you always direct your attention toward others  
And look you know, it's so easy to see that my wounds have been open  
Wide  
  
And you can just kid the kid inside so many times  
You can just kid the kid till he grabs you by the throat  
And is choking your young ass blind  
And you just kid the kid till you're walking on the tightrope in my my  
Mind ??  
Yeah, you can just kid the kid inside so many times  
  
Well it wasn't funny, no, when I was bleeding all over the table  
Yeah, now as I recall, hey it wasn't funny at all  
But you kept on laughing, huh, like it was some kind of party, yea  
Your always looking to belittle someone to make you feel tall  
  
Yea well, it's the same reaction in every situation  
Do you really think it's so necessary to be so mean  
Yeah, and it's hard for me to justify my position  
Yeah, when everything that I'm saying can be said bad about Mr.  
Springsteen, yea  
  
(chorus)  
Yeah you know  
  
Yeah, well I really really am the first to desire you ??  
And I feel so badly for his misery ??  
Well I'll don't throw five dollars, to get into the kitty ??  
And I'll bet my ass that this problem isn't me  
  
Now now don't get me wrong wrong  
Hey now don't you feel sorry, yeah  
'Cause there's no one dead or alive that I'd rather be  
And I've learned to deal with my mortal existence  
And the moral is, now don't you go believe nothing that you can't see,  
Yeah  
  
(chorus)  
Yeah, and you can just kid the kid inside so many times, yea  
  
(Ha ha ha, we'll keep it)
