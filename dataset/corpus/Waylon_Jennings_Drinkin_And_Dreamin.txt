Everybody's looking for someway in  
I'm looking for someway out  
I've been wasting my time, standing in line  
If this is what it's all about  
  
All I've got is a job that I don't like  
And a woman that don't understand  
So tonight in the bar, I'll get in my car  
And take off for the promise land  
  
[Chorus]  
Drinkin' and dreamin', knowing damn well I can't go  
I'll never see Texas, L.A., or ol' Mexico  
But here at this table, I'm able to leave it behind  
Drink till I'm dreaming a thousand miles out of my mind  
  
This suit and this tie is just a disguise  
This ain't really me  
Some people were born to be tied down  
Some people were born to be free  
  
When I look down the road she don't know  
How it gets under my skin  
She's got my body but my heart and soul  
Are out there riding the wind  
  
[Chorus: x2]
