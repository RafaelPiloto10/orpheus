I'm walkin' downtown  
No lookin' around  
'Cause I'm a fool and a half  
Blessed and beaten by love  
  
I walk in the direction  
But then I stop the action  
'Cause when I try to do it  
My heart is gone, I blew it  
  
Do it, do it...  
  
I'm going on and on, just on and on  
Just walkin', talkin', not a winner at all  
I'm boozing, losing, getting out of control  
She dances hip-hop, she's on the top  
I'm still a fool and a half, blessed and beaten by love  
  
Do it, do it...  
  
I'm walkin' back home  
Keep lookin' around  
Still a fool and a half  
Blessed and beaten by love  
  
She walks in my direction  
Why don't she start the action  
I got no guts to do it  
And then she's gone, I blew it  
  
Do it, do it...
