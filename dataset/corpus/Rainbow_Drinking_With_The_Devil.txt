I never left like this before  
I think I'm gonna explode  
Had so much I couldn't take no more  
I'm heading for an overload  
Oh no here I go  
I can see the end  
Looked around and I heard the sound  
Of have one more my friend  
Drinking with the devil  
Gonna raise some hell  
I'm just a rock and roll rebel  
Got my soul to sell  
  
Out all night till the sun comes up  
You know I'm never gonna learn  
Raise my glass and fill my cup  
I'm playing with fire  
And I'm gonna get burned  
Like before he walked through the door  
A glass was in his hand  
Sat me down and poured me one more  
And I was drinking with the devil  
Gonna raise some hell  
I'm just a rock and roll rebel  
Got my soul to sell  
  
Out all night till the sun comes up  
You know I'm never gonna learn  
Raise my glass and fill my cup  
I'm playing with fire  
And I'm gonna get burned  
Like before he walked through the door  
A glass was in his hand  
Sat me down and poured me one more  
And said I'm at your command yes I am  
Drinking with the devil  
Gonna raise some hell  
I'm just a rock and roll rebel  
Got my soul to sell  
  
Drinking with the devil  
You know I had my fill  
Drinking with the devil  
And he sticks me with the bill
