Is there a good way to say goodbye  
When you're leaving all you had 'cause your love has run dry  
Is there a good way to be a bad girl  
When you're taking all that's given from the world  
  
Is there a good way to move ahead  
Without selling out your soul for some water or some bread  
Is there a good way to learn your lesson and stay alive  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've been looking for something all of my life  
Maybe in some other city I'll see the light  
  
Is there a good way to say goodbye  
To this fantasy world, to this lie  
Is there a good way to get out before you're jaded  
  
I need to find a good way to say goodbye  
Is there a good way to say goodbye  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've been looking for something all of my life  
Maybe in some other city I'll be alright  
  
Is there a good way to leave him alone  
When you find his love just hits too close to home  
Is there a good way to deny everything you thought you needed  
  
I need to find a good way to say goodbye  
Is there a good way to say goodbye  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've been looking for something all of my life  
Maybe I'll find somebody who'll make things alright  
I've been looking for something all of my live  
Maybe in some other city I'll be alright  
  
I've been looking for you
