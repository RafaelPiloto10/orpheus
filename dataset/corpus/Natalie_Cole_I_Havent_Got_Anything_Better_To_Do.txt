I never loved him, he never reached me  
He was just someone, someone I knew  
I think about him on alternate Thursdays  
When I haven't got anything better to do  
  
He's got a problem if he thinks I need him  
I couldn't care less now that we're through  
I only sit home and I wait for his phone call  
When I haven't got anything better to do  
  
Wasn't I awfully smart not to fall and break my heart  
He never meant a thing to me, he's gone  
I'm glad, I'm free  
And when he kissed me, no no he never moved me  
Nothing fantastic, thrilling or new  
So if I'm crying, I'm only crying  
Cause I haven't got anything better  
No I haven't got anything better  
I haven't got anything better to do without you  
I never loved him, no he never moved me  
Nothing fantastic
