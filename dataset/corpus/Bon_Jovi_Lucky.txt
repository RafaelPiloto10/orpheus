She counts the days away and waits for valentines  
She says every girl in the past is just a waste of time  
You know, whoa  
She don't believe in miracles and make-believe  
If you were blind you still could see  
That she believes in me, Oh  
Feels like I found a pocket full of gold  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm lucky baby  
So lucky baby  
Lucky to be with you today  
Lucky to be the one to say "I'm lucky baby"  
So lucky baby  
Whenever I see your smiling face  
Lucky to be the one to be lucky  
  
Now all of heaven's angels have to wear their wings  
She likes cheap sunglasses and diamond rings  
You know, oh  
She brings sunshine to a cloudy day  
When we walk on by people stop and say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm lucky baby  
So lucky baby  
Lucky to be with you today  
Lucky to be the one to say "I'm lucky baby"  
I'm lucky baby  
  
I got lucky when you found me  
It only took one kiss to see  
What did I do to get to be so lucky baby?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm lucky baby  
Whenever I see your smiling face  
Lucky to be the one to be lucky
