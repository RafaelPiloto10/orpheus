I Heard my Lisa say  
"I can't believe you could leave me looking this way."  
When ever music plays... I smile and I can't feel anything  
All I want to say..(All I want to say)  
Is everything's all right and I'm ok  
Heard my Lisa today  
"say he wants to paint the same me every single day"  
"what's wrong with him anyway?"  
Cuz sometimes I can't feel anything  
All I want to say..(All I want to say)  
Is everything's all right and I'm ok.. I'm ok  
My body's mapped before me..  
On a flying carpet through the sky  
The same things that destroy me...  
We'll hang there waiting for me upon a wall outside of me yeah.  
Heard my Lisa say  
"god blesses the same things every single day."  
How'd he miss me anyway? 7 days and I can't feel anything.  
My paint is smeared upon his wall..  
Its a portrait we are 4 feet tall.. Just Leanardo passing days  
With a Mona Lisa can't feel anything. All I want to say..(All I want to say)  
Is everything's all right and I'm ok all I want to say....(all I want to say)  
Is everything's all right and I'm ok [7X]
