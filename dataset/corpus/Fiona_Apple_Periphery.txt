Oh, the periphery  
They throw good parties there  
Those peripheral idiots  
Always have a bite to bear  
Bear it if you can  
If you really want to  
  
Go to the periphery  
Have them celebrate your name  
Have them forge you a pedigree and then you'll be  
Left to run the races lame  
Run if you want  
If you think it's worth it  
But not with me  
  
'Cause I don't appreciate  
People who  
Don't appreciate  
All that loving must've been lacking something  
If I got bored trying to figure you out  
You let me down  
I don't even like you anymore at all  
  
Oh, the periphery  
I lost another one there  
He found a prettier girl than me  
With a more even-tempered air  
And if he wants her, he should get her  
'Cause I think he thinks she's worth it  
And maybe they'll move from the periphery  
By themselves, or on a plot of land  
And I'll care in a different capacity, I'll just be  
Hoping he makes a good family man  
And if he finds himself yearning  
For his throne on the silly side  
Nothing wrong as long as he's learning  
Besides, you can take it up with his brethren  
Or with his bride, just not with me  
  
'Cause I don't appreciate  
People who  
Don't appreciate  
All that loving must've been lacking something  
If I got bored trying to figure you out  
You let me down  
I don't even like you anymore at all  
  
All that loving must've been lacking something  
If I got bored trying to figure you out  
You let me down  
I don't even like you anymore at all  
  
Oh, the periphery  
Oh, the periphery  
Oh, the periphery  
Oh, the periphery  
Stay away  
Stay away  
Away, away  
Stay away, away
