You say this, you say that  
Smart but in a way you're sad  
Leave me alone right now  
I used to be in love with this  
Now I'm trying to get rid of all this human interest  
  
Don't you dare to point your finger at me  
Look at yourself  
I'm not the one you want me to be  
Look at yourself  
  
Some say no, some say yes  
Less or more or more or less  
Leave me alone right now  
  
I used to be adored each day  
Now it's time for me to pay  
The dreadful price of success  
  
Don't you dare to point your finger at me  
Look at yourself  
I'm not the one you want me to be  
Look at yourself  
  
Some say no, some say yes  
  
Don't you dare to point your finger at me  
Look at yourself  
I'm not the one you want me to be  
Look at yourself  
  
Don't you dare to point your finger at me  
Look at yourself  
I'm not the one you want me to be  
Look at yourself
