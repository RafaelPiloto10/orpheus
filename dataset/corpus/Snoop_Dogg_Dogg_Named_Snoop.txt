[Snoop Dogg]  
10-20-71, the day I come out  
Two days later, I'm running my mouth  
Mom's put a bottle to my grill  
I look her in the face and I say chill  
So she puts her back up on a pillow, uh huh  
Two minutes later I'm bailin' out the hos-pital  
On my way to the liquor store  
First thing I grab is some skins and a 4-0  
Dropped the O-E cause it's just too cold  
Get myself some gin instead and then I stroll  
But before I get out the door  
The man behind the counter says hey, yo, yo  
He picks me up and sit me on the seat  
And then he get the phone and get to dialin' the police  
I'm on the run but I can't walk yet  
Can't grapple nothin' said, cause I can't talk yet  
First trip in the police car  
Cameras all around me as if I was a star  
Mom's grabbed me, hugged me, and kissed me  
This fool tried to twist me, mom's say she missed me (I missed you)  
Re-group it, swoopin' in the coupe and  
That's what I'ma name you cause boy you be snoopin'  
Soon to be hoopin' hoes I be scoopin'  
First piece of ass before I got my first whoopin'  
Cookin', bookin', hookin' up with G's  
Twenty days later I'm from are-T-see  
Doin' it up, rollin', givin' it up  
Sellin' candy for a white boy outta light blue truck  
And I'm comin' up, that's right, niggas runnin' up  
Havin' fun and stuff  
You niggas don't want none of us  
  
[Snoop Dogg]  
What's up homie (What's up 'cause, where you from)  
My name Snoop Dogg (Where you from though)  
Eastside, rollin' twenty crip (What)  
(Oh) yeah (OK, it's all good cuz) That's what I'm talkin' bout  
(Yeah) Ah, you gonna feel me nigga, sooner or later  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Snoop Dogg]  
Roll with me, S-N-double O-P  
Mel-man where ya been O.G.  
Tell me, the game'll never fail me  
Ask J or my lil' homie Shelby  
Uh, I cut em' up like Marcus Welby  
This is the dopest G, that you will ever see  
There'll never be, another me  
By the grace of God, ya lovin' me  
Pause, do it to em' dogg  
Now drop a rock em' dogg  
Now put a lock em' dogg  
Rollin' down the river spinnin' on a log  
Jog to the liquor store, grab me a thicker ho  
Get me a Michelob, now I want to Snicker though  
Remind me of the old days  
When my mama used to bang the O'Jays  
Family reunion, ha ha, hey 8-track style  
Mel-Man you a fool for this 'cause  
Cause I'm the motherfucking dogg, named Snoop
