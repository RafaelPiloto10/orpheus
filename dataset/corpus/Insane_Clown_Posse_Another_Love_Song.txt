Yeah...  
I mean I hear what you're saying, I mean  
You got carried away in the moment  
And I could forgive you  
I could do that  
I could do anything, if I want to  
(1st Verse- Violent J)  
I could buy you a Lexus truck with a white leather interior  
I could kill off some bears and dogs and shit just to make you a fur coat  
I could love you and treat you with class  
And have babies falling all out your ass  
But thinking about that...  
I feel I'd rather kill you  
['cause I got you in my car, and you ain't going nowhere bitch, you're dead]  
(Chorus x2- Violent J)  
I'd rather cut that neck in half  
I'd rather choke out that bitch-ass  
I'd rather chop and never stop  
Because you fucked my homies  
(2nd Verse- Violent J)  
I could take all the face paint off and get a real job working for Dad  
I would rather take a ten-pound axe and stick it in your daddy's forehead  
I could let you move into my house  
You'd fuck the neighbors every time I'd go out  
And wipe his nut on my pillow [oh]  
But I think I'd rather kill you  
['cause we parked all alone and it's real dark anyway, hey]  
(Chorus)  
(3rd Verse)  
I'm the one that killed your precious cat, and stuffed him in your fucking  
mailbox  
If I only hadn't cut off my hair, I'd choke you with all my dreadlocks  
When I strain at the moon every night [Heh heh!]  
You shouldv'e known something just ain't right  
'cause I'm gonna slap you  
And the I'm going to kill you  
['cause the moon told me to, and it's watching us right now]  
(Chorus)  
(4th Verse)  
I could go back to school instead and try to get my diploma  
I'd much rather bang your head on the wall, until you fall into a coma  
'cause I can't get you out of my head  
I'd cut my head off but the I would be dead  
And I ain't the only motherfucker that's dying!  
So let's just die togetherrrrrraaaaaagghhh!!!  
(Chorus x4)  
Ahhh!! Let's just die together  
Ahhh, yeah!! Let's just die together  
Me and you, I'll kill you but, can you explain?  
Let's just die together  
Wicked clown told you, I'm gonna kill you  
And tonight we'll die together
