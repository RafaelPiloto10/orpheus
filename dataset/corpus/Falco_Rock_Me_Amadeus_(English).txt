He was the first punk ever to set foot on this earth.  
He was a genius from the day of his birth.  
He could play the piano like a ring and a bell  
And ev'rybody screamed:  
Come on, rock me Amadeus.  
  
He was a superstar, he was dynamite and whatever he did (it)  
Seemed to be alright.  
And he drank (and) he cursed and he fooled around  
But when the women would shout:  
Rock me Amadeus,  
Amadeus, Amadeus, Amadeus,  
Amadeus, Amadeus, Amadeus,  
Oh oh oh Amadeus.  
  
With a bottle of wine in one hand and a woman in the other  
'Cause he was a ladies man  
He never stopped to worry what the next day would bring  
Because the girls would sing:  
Rock me Amadeus,  
Amadeus, Amadeus, Amadeus,  
Amadeus, Amadeus, Amadeus,  
Oh oh oh Amadeus.  
  
His mind was on rock and roll and having fun  
Because he lived so fast he had to die so young.  
But he made his mark in history.  
Still ev'rybody says:  
Rock me Amadeus  
Amadeus, Amadeus, Amadeus,  
Amadeus, Amadeus, Amadeus,  
Oh oh oh Amadeus.
