(are. Carnes, S. Drake)  
  
Chorus:  
Gonna love ya till the cows come home  
Gonna love ya baby all night long  
Gonna love ya lordy me oh my  
Gonna love ya till the day I die  
  
Take your time morning is far away  
And the moon's leaning into the night  
So we won't be needing the light  
  
So (repeat chorus)  
  
Now you're mine  
There's no chance to run away  
While the stars are all turning to you  
Tell you what I'm gonna do  
  
Oh(repeat chorus)  
  
Tell me now  
It's love that you're feeling  
Fill my soul like you're filling my arms  
  
Oh(repeat chorus x2)
