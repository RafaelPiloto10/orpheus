I always see the girls walk past me  
But they really don't know what I'm like  
I'm funny, talented and stupid  
I hate boys because they try to take my women  
They get on my nerves so I start pokin  
  
So I keep on saying  
I can't stand guys  
They have ugly eyes  
They smell like cats  
And are fats  
They are so stupid  
They act like cupid  
But they don't know I I am your man  
Ha  
(Your man)  
Lalalala  
(Your man)
