Twenty-seventh of January,  
I think he died a year ago today.  
She's crying on my shoulder and begging me to make the hurting go away.  
Pretty brown eyes, tears full of guilt.  
A heart full of pain and fear.  
I want to tell her it's okay but we both know she's the reason he's not here.  
  
(MMm)  
I keep on crying but it doesn't seem to help at all  
(Seem to help at all)  
With every single tear drop, it's like another rain drop falls.  
And I would if I could but the try would be in vain.  
Said no matter what I do, I can't stop the rain.  
So I cry (Oooh)  
I can't stop the rain, stop the rain (Oooh)  
I can't stop the rain, stop the rain  
If I could, know I would but the try would be in vain.  
So I cry oooh, I can't stop the rain, stop the rain.  
  
Faded picture in a little gold locket.  
But she never takes it off.  
I know it's small but it's heavy,  
Cause it's filled with the guilt of knowing she's why his life is lost.  
I feel bad for her but I'm having mixed emotions.  
Cause he was a friend of mine.  
And somewhere in the deepest, darkest part of my mind.  
I wish it was her that got that knife.  
  
(Mm)  
I keep on crying but it doesn't seem to help at all  
(Seem to help at all)  
With every single tear drop, it's like another rain drop falls.  
And I would if I could but the try would be in vain.  
Said no matter what I do, I can't stop the rain.  
So I cry (Oooh)  
I can't stop the rain, stop the rain (Oooh)  
I can't stop the rain, stop the rain  
If I could, know I would but the try would be in vain.  
So I cry oooh, I can't stop the rain, stop the rain.  
  
One rainy Saturday night, a happy anniversary.  
Celebrating love, champagne all around.  
They had a little too much to drink.  
Got in the car and he can barely stand up.  
So she think if that she drive.  
Staring at him not the road, sudden jerk on the wheel.  
And the car flipped about three times.  
  
(Mm)  
I keep on crying but it doesn't seem to help at all  
(Seem to help at all)  
With every single tear drop, it's like another rain drop falls.  
And I would if I could but the try would be in vain.  
Said no matter what I do, I can't stop the rain.  
So I cry (Oooh)  
I can't stop the rain, stop the rain (Oooh)  
I can't stop the rain, stop the rain  
If I could, know I would but the try would be in vain.  
So I cry oooh, I can't stop the rain, stop the rain.
