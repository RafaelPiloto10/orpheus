I have no need of half of anything  
No half time, no half of a man's attention  
Give me all the earth and sky  
And at the same time add a new dimension  
Half the truth is of no use  
Give it all, give it all to me  
I can stand it  
I am strong that way  
  
Give me all night  
Give me the full moon  
And if I can't take the whole of you  
Give it to me anyway  
Give me all night  
'Till the last star fades  
And if you can't take my heart and soul  
Take it from me anyway  
  
Don't give me fountains, I need waterfalls  
And, when I cry my tears'll fill an ocean  
The pain of love I'll accept it all  
As long as you'll join me in that emotion  
Half of lovin' is no fun  
Give it all, give it all to me  
I can stand it  
I am strong that way  
  
Don't leave me guessing alone  
Don't walk me half the way home  
You can do that tomorrow  
Just give me give me all night.
