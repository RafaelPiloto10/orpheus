Me debunk an American myth?  
And take my life in my hands?  
Where the great plains begin,  
At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian,  
Where the great plains begin  
  
Driving down a corduroy road,  
Weeds standing shoulder high  
Ferris wheel is rusting off in the distance  
At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian  
Where the great plains begin  
  
Left alone to get gigantic  
Hard, huge and haunted  
A generation so much dumber than it's parents came  
Crashing through the window  
A raven strains along the line of the road,  
Carrying a muddy, old skull  
The wires whistle their approval,  
Off down the distance  
At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian  
Where the great plains begin  
  
(At the hundredth meridian) At the hundredth meridian  
(At the hundredth meridian) At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian  
Where the great plains begin  
  
I remember, I remember Buffalo  
And I remember Angelo  
It would seem to me I remember every  
Single fucking thing I know  
  
If I die of vanity, promise me, promise me,  
They bury me some place I don't want to be,  
You'll dig me up and transport me, unceremoniously,  
Away from the swollen city-breeze, garbage bag trees,  
Whispers of disease and the acts of enormity  
And lower me slowly, sadly and properly  
Get Ry Cooder to sing my eulogy,  
At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian  
Where the great plains begin  
  
At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian  
Where the great plains begin
