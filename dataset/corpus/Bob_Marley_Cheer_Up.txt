Cheer up my brothers, cheer up my sisters  
Cheer up my momma too, lord  
Cheer up my father, let me say  
I know it won't be long  
That change has got to come  
That change has got to come  
And I know that it won't be long  
We've been down in captivity [captivity] so long, so long  
If we unite then we will be free [we will be free]  
So strong, so strong, come I want you to  
Cheer up my [brothers] my sisters

Cheer up my my my momma too, lord  
Cheer up my father  
  
Let me say, we've been down in captivity [captivity]  
So long, so long  
We unite we will be free [we will be free]  
So strong, so strong
