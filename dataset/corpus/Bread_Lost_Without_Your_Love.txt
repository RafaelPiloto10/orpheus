Lost and all alone.  
I always thought that I could make it on my own.  
But since you left I hardly make it through the day.  
My tears get in the way and I need you back to stay.  
  
I wander through the night  
And search the world to find the words to make it right.  
All I want is just the way it used to be  
With you here close to me.  
And I've got to make you see,  
That I'm lost without your love.  
Life without you isn't worth the trouble of.  
And I'm as helpless as a ship without a wheel,  
A touch without a feel.  
I can't believe its real.  
And someday soon I'll wake  
And find my heart won't have to break.  
  
Yes, I'm lost without your love.  
Life without you isn't worth the trouble of.  
All I want is the way it used to be  
I need you here with me.  
Oh darling can't you see,  
If we had love before,  
We can have it back once more
