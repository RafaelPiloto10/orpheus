I've been to London been to Paris, Australia and Rome  
There's sexy boys in every city but their not what I want  
Some got money, some got fame, some got cars and the clothes  
But if it just ain't you then I don't wanna know  
  
'Cause baby now I realize that I was wrong  
When I said I didn't need you, so  
Miss you bad, so now I'm coming home  
So you better leave a light on  
Wait for me and just leave the light on  
Ooh  
  
It been like a permanent December  
So much colder then I can remember  
When I get you back, this time I swear that I won't  
Won't ever let you go, won't let you go, go  
Won't let you go, go, go, go,  
Won't let you go, no  
Go, go, go, go, no, no, no, no!  
  
I've been to New York been to L.A and to Baton Rouge  
I met a boy in every city, no one kept me amused  
But don't call me a Lolita cause I don't let them through  
'Cause I'm saving all my loving for someone, and it's you  
  
'Cause baby now I realize that I was wrong  
When I said I didn't need you so  
Miss you bad, so now I'm coming home  
So better leave a light on (a light on)  
Wait for me and just leave the light on  
Ohh  
  
It's been like a permanent December  
So much colder then I can remember  
When I get you back, this time I swear that I won't  
Won't ever let you go, won't let you go, no  
Won't let you go, go, go, go,  
Won't let you go, no  
Go, go, go, go, no, no, no, no  
Won't let you go, go, go, go won't let you go, no  
Go, go, go, go, no, no, no, no  
  
Hey what do you say?  
'Cause I've been all around the world  
And they just ain't the same  
Hey what do you say?  
Without my baby I go crazy and I just gotta scream  
  
Now I realize that I was wrong  
When I said I didn't need you, so  
Miss you bad, so now I'm coming home  
So better leave a light on  
Wait for me and just leave the light on  
Oooh oh  
  
It's been like a permanent December  
So much colder then I can remember  
When I get you back, this time I swear that I won't  
Won't ever let you go, won't let you go, no  
It's been like a permanent December  
So much colder then I can remember  
When I get you back, this time I swear that I won't  
Won't ever let you go, won't let you go, go  
Won't let you go, go, go, go, go won't let you go  
No, go, go, go, go, no no no  
  
Won't let you go, go, go, go  
Won't let you go  
No, go, go, go, go, no, no, no
