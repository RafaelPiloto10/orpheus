I know you like me  
I know you do  
That's why when I come around  
She's all over you  
And I know you want me too  
It's easy to see  
And in the back of your mind  
You know you should be on with me  
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me?  
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me?  
Don't cha?  
Don't cha, baby? Don't cha?  
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me?  
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me?  
Don't cha?  
Don't cha, baby? Don't cha?  
Fight the feeling  
Leave it alone  
'Cause if it ain't love  
It just ain't enough to leave my happy home  
Let's keep it friendly  
You have to play fair  
See I don't care but I know  
She ain't gonna wanna share  
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me?  
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me?  
Don't cha, baby? Don't Cha?  
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me?  
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me?  
Don't cha?  
Don't cha, baby? Don't cha?  
I know she loves you  
I understand  
I'd probably be just as crazy about you  
If you were my own man  
Maybe next lifetime  
Possibly  
Until then old friend  
Let's just see if you can hang with me  
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me?  
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me?  
Don't cha?  
Don't cha, baby? Don't Cha?  
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me?  
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me?  
Don't cha?  
Don't cha, baby? Don't Cha?
