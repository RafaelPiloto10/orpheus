It's been forty days and nights  
Since I heard you  
Girl, I cannot bring myself  
To ask you why  
It's a fact that your not here  
I ain't accusing you  
I only seek the simple answer from the sky  
  
See the circle spinnin' round  
Changing colors without a sound  
Helter, skelter, doomsday plan  
It's just another tale of a man  
  
Lay me down, lay me down  
In your heaven  
I can really see  
Everything quite clear  
I can almost reach your hand  
Enough to touch you  
Girl, I'll have you safe and sound within a year  
  
See the circle spinnin' round  
Changing colors without a sound  
Helter, skelter, doomsday plan  
It's just another tale of a man  
  
It's been forty days and nights  
Since I heard you  
Girl, I cannot bring myself  
To ask you why  
It's a fact that your not here  
I ain't accusing you  
I only seek the simple  
answer from the sky  
  
See the circle spinnin' round  
Changing colors without a sound  
Helter, skelter, doomsday plan  
It's just another tale of a man
