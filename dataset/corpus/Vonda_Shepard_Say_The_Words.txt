Every light shines on you tonight  
Making a fool out of me  
Why won't this love leave me alone  
All of the people in this smoky room  
Crowded with faces I know  
I feel them watching me watch you  
  
Say the words  
Say the words  
Say the words  
Say the words so I can leave, it's over  
  
Your eyes are deeper  
They are worthy of many words  
But none I can conjure up will do for you  
I shouldn't see you  
Cause I know my own motivation  
It's taking too long for this love  
To leave me alone  
  
Say the words  
Say the words  
Say the words  
Say the words so I can leave, it's over  
  
Oh love, you worry me  
When you say you'll wait forever  
I have another life  
We just cannot be together  
  
Say the words  
Say the words  
Say the words  
Say the words, say them for me  
I need to hear you say, it's over  
Say the words  
Say the words  
Say the words so I can leave, it's over
