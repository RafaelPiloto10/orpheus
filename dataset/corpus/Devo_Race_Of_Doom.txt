Race of doom  
Is it on  
Is it off

It's a matter of time  
It's a matter of luck  
It's a factor of chance  
'Til i self-destruct  
You fire at random  
I'm under attack  
Strapped in and freewheeling  
Flying off the track  
  
I want to be your time bomb  
Let me be your time bomb baby  
I want to be your time bomb  
Please let me be your time bomb baby  
Everywhere there is danger  
  
Absolutely for real  
Subliminal feelings  
Too strong to conceal  
Unscramble your program  
My turn to unload  
Unbelievably certain  
Guaranteed to explode
