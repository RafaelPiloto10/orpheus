She goes down slow like a shot of gin  
She's got an angel's face and a devil's grin  
She kinda stared me down as I looked her up  
She said "I'm your poison, now you drink a cup."  
  
In the heat of the night is when she comes alive  
She's gonna push you push you til she's satisfied  
I watch the ice melt fast on her red hot lips  
She whispers "If you want to taste my love  
why don't you swallow this."  
  
[Chorus]  
Love on the rocks  
Love on the rocks  
She's my shot  
Love on the rocks  
Ooooh lick it up  
  
She gets so close you can feel her breathe  
Just the way she moves, so soft and slippery  
She lives just around the corner, right down the street  
All night we play the horizontal bop right between her sheets  
  
[Chorus]
