[AJ:]  
The first night that we met  
I will never forget  
Baby, you were a star  
From that point in time  
It was always you and I shining  
So beautiful  
When we're out with your friends  
You treat me like I'm dead  
It was like I'm invisible  
  
[Nick:]  
(I can't let it go)  
That was unforgettable  
(I can't let it go)  
I just wanna let you know  
(I can't let it go)  
Situations unlivable  
(I can't let it go)  
I can't let it go  
(I can't let it go)  
  
[Chorus:]  
Tell me what you say that you want me  
All you ever do girl is push all my buttons  
You always bring me down in public  
When nobody's around you say that you love me  
Make me say oh no  
I see you all alone  
I'm halfway out the door  
Unless you turn around  
And you treat me right  
  
[Brian:]  
Oh, you got me twisted  
Oh, you got me twisted  
I'm not someone you can just disrespect  
How would you feel if you were in my shoes  
Feelin' used with your heart bruised  
  
[Nick:]  
(I can't let it go)  
The situations critical  
(I can't let it go)  
Relationship is pitiful  
(I can't let it go)  
Everything's falling apart  
(I can't let it go)  
Cause you're so hypocritical  
  
[Repeat Chorus]  
  
[All:]  
You're just no good for me  
You're no good for me  
You're just no good for me  
I know you're no good for me  
  
[Howie:]  
You know  
It's wrong to treat me cold  
I've no one to hold  
One day I'm gonna say goodbye  
What's it gonna be  
Girl I'm gonna leave  
Unless you turn around  
And treat me right  
  
[Repeat Chorus]  
  
[Howie:]  
Just treat me right  
Just treat me right  
  
[Brian:]  
Say that you want me  
  
[Howie:]  
Just treat me right  
Just treat me right  
  
[Repeat Chorus]
