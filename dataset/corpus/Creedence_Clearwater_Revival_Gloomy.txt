Some people laugh in the dark,  
Some people cry alone.  
Some people talk without sayin' a thing,  
And everything turns out gloomy.  
  
Some people count your money,  
Someone is countin' your days.  
And somebody got to keep track of your mind.  
  
When everything turns out gloomy.  
  
Brothers'll make you look sideways,  
Fathers'll make you look back.  
And when you're done talking, you still got to shoot,  
Cause everything turns out gloomy.  
  
Oh! oh!
