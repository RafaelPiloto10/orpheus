You do me wrong and still I'm crazy 'bout you  
Stay away too long and I can live without you  
Every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more  
But each hurt makes my love stronger than before  
  
I know flower grow through rain  
But how can love grow through pain  
  
Ain't that peculiar  
Peculiarity  
Ain't that peculiar  
Peculiar as can be  
  
You tell me lies  
That you'll be honest to me  
But I'm so much in love with baby till I don't want to see  
Cause the things you do and say  
Are designed to make me blue  
It's a doggone shame my love for you  
Makes all your lies seem true  
  
If the truth makes love last longer  
Why do lies make my love stronger  
  
Ain't that peculiar  
Peculiarity  
Ain't that peculiar  
Peculiar as can be  
  
Hm, I act just like a child that's lost his toy  
Can't you see these tears I cry are tears of joy  
A child can cry so much until you do everything they say  
But unlike a child those tear don't help me to get my way  
  
I know love can last through years  
How can love last through tears  
  
Ain't that peculiar  
Peculiarity  
Ain't that peculiar  
Peculiar as can be  
  
Ain't that peculiar (ad lib to end)
