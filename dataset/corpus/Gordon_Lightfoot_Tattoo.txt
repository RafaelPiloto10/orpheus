Whatever you think of me I'm still your friend  
So other than nothin' what's new  
The water's still flowin' through the rose on my skin  
This here tattoo is for you  
The boys at the parlor downtown  
Didn't waste anytime a-puttin' it down  
Time has been wastin' away I can see it  
Go sailin' on by as it slips through my fingers  
The bow and the wave never wait for tomorrow  
They just keep on rollin' as straight as an arrow, good night  
Girl of my dreams you get better each day  
I wish I could see you somehow  
Girls that I love is there no other way  
This here tattoo is for now  
I'd been out drinkin' all day  
I got carried away at the parlor last night  
This summer rose is for you it's no wonder  
I bothered to wander back into the parlor  
It's red and in bloom and it's more than one color  
It lives on forever for just a few dollars, good night  
Whatever you think of me I'm still your friend  
So baby whatever you do  
Now that it's taken its permanent home  
This here tattoo is for you  
The boys at the parlor downtown  
Didn't waste any time a-puttin' it down  
Time has been wastin' away, you know time doesn't  
Wait for nobody to find what they're after  
It just keeps on rolling on down the deep canyons  
And through the green meadows into the broad ocean, good night  
Whatever you think of me I'm still your friend  
So other than nothin' what's new  
The water's still flowing through the rose on my skin  
This here tattoo is for you  
The water's still flowin through the rose on my skin  
This here tattoo is for you
