Night after night  
I keep holding on  
You say you love me  
Then you leave me so lonely  
Baby, I don't believe a word  
You're sayin'  
I think it's all some evil game  
You're playin'  
Still all day long all I do is think  
About ya  
You got me believin' that I can't  
Live without ya  
Well if ya want it, well here is  
My confession  
Baby, I can't help it, you're my obsession  
Protection, that's what I need  
I need protection, baby from your love  
Protection, that's what I need  
I need protection, baby from your love  
I wait at home by my telephone  
When I call your house, baby  
You're not home  
Knock on the door and rush  
Down the stairs  
When I open up, baby you're  
Not there  
When we're together and ya put  
Your arms around me  
Your love sweeps away all the  
Confusion that surrounds me  
You keep my mind  
Forever, ever in doubt  
You want me believin'  
That baby, I can't live without  
Protection that's what I need  
I need protection, baby from your love  
Protection, that's what I need  
I need protection, baby from your love  
We stand alone, at my window  
And stare out, at the shadows  
Down below  
I feel your fingers on my face  
I want to stay, I want to run away  
Protection that's what I need  
I need protection, baby from your love  
Protection, that's what I need  
I need protection, baby from your love  
Protection, that's what I need  
I need protection, baby from your love  
Protection, that's what I need  
I need protection, baby from your love
