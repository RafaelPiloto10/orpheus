Could you be wrong  
Could you be wrong  
To choke on the smoke and the drunkenness  
Drowning in sorrow with each breath  
you're a wino  
A cigarette smoker  
You have a good time  
They call you a joker, don't they  
Wino  
You're a cigarette smoker  
You have a good time  
They call you a joker, don't they  
Don't they  
could you be wrong  
Could you be wrong  
You're happy dying you don't wanna change  
Remove your fix and you feel your pain  
you're a wino  
A cigarette smoker  
You have a good time  
They call you a joker, don't they  
Wino  
You're a cigarette smoker  
You have a good time  
They call you a joker, don't they  
Don't they
