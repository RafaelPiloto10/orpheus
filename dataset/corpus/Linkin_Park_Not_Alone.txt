I break down, fear is sinking in  
The cold comes, racing through my skin  
Searching for a way to get to you  
Through the storm you  
Go, giving up your home  
Go, leaving all you've known  
You are not alone  
  
With arms up, stretched into the sky  
With eyes like, echoes in the night  
Hiding from the hell that you've been through  
Silent one, you  
Go, giving up your home  
Go, leaving all you've known  
You are not alone  
  
Go, giving up your home  
Go, leaving all you've known  
You are not alone  
  
You go, giving up your home  
Go, leaving all you've known  
  
You go, giving up your home  
Go, you are not alone  
You are not alone  
  
You are not alone  
You are not alone
