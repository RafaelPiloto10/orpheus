Now you've been bad, and it goes on and on and on  
'Til you come home babe, 'til you come home  
You taste past the poison, you learned to love is gone  
I'm all alone baby, I'm all alone  
  
I'm waiting for something, always waiting  
Feeling nothing, wondering if it'll ever change  
And then I give a little more, oh babe  
Oh, I give a little more, oh babe  
  
I'm not fallin' in love with ya, I'm not fallin' in love  
And I'm not fallin' in love with ya, I'm not fallin' in love  
'Til I get a little more from you baby  
Oh, get a little more from you babe  
  
You were wrong for turning me on and on and on  
And on and on, yeah  
You make it so hard  
  
I'm waiting for something, always waiting  
Feeling nothing, wondering if it'll ever change (if it'll ever change)  
Then I give a little more, oh babe  
Oh, give a little more, oh babe  
  
I'm not fallin' in love with ya, I'm not fallin' in love  
And I'm not gonna love with ya, I'm not gonna love  
'Til I get a little more from you baby  
I get a little more from you babe  
  
I have no defense  
I know you're gonna get me in the end  
And I cannot pretend  
I never wanna feel this way again  
  
I'm not fallin' in love with ya, I'm not fallin' in love  
And I'm not fallin' in love with ya, I'm not fallin' in love  
'Til I get a little more from you baby  
Oh, get a little more from you babe  
  
I'm not gonna love with ya, I'm not gonna love  
And I'm not gonna love with ya, I'm not fallin' in love  
'Til I get a little more from you baby  
Oh, get a little more from you babe
