Bought With Blood  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
Said the poor man to the rich man  
Sitting in the shade,  
They say that you have money  
They say you have it made  
Did you know that I have riches, too?  
Perhaps you cannot see  
Theres no greater treasure  
Than what He paid for me  
Chorus:  
Bought with Blood, not with gold  
He gave His life to make me whole  
Theres no doubt God is love  
For my soul was bought with Blood  
Said the rich man to the poor man,  
I believe what you have said  
And he brought him to his table  
And then they broke the bread  
He said, Friend, you are my brother  
We are equal in Gods sight  
And they fellowshipped together  
And sang throughout the night  
Chorus  
You can keep the silver  
You can keep the gold  
Give me the treasure  
Buried in my soul  
Chorus (repeat)
