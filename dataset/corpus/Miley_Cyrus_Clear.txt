It's six a.m. and I'm wide awake  
'Cause I can't stop thinking  
About the stuff you'll say  
And me and I, I can't let it slide  
The paper's not here yet the sun's not up  
But I'm not afraid to tell you what I feel inside  
I had one of those dreams that make it all so  
Clear to me now  
I got a whole new perspective  
It's so clear to me now  
You can't treat me that way  
It appears to me  
How long you tried to make me think  
It was me who was being the fake  
So clear  
Why did I smile when I hurt inside?  
Said I was okay when I knew it's a lie  
I wanted to believe in you  
You took your chances and one was me  
So I'll just forgive you and set you free  
I'm on my way  
Yeah I'm stepping out of the haze  
And it's so clear to me now  
I got a whole new perspective  
It's so clear to me now  
You can't treat me that way  
It appears to me  
How long you tried to make me think  
It was me who was being the fake  
So clear  
I wanna put the past behind  
Try and maybe I can find better days  
The first time in a while  
Think I even feel a smile on my face  
I got a whole new perspective  
You can't treat me that way  
It's so clear to me now  
I got a whole new perspective  
It's so clear to me now  
You can't treat me that way  
It appears to me  
How long you tried to make me think  
It was me who was being the fake  
So clear  
Yeah, so clear  
So clear, so clear  
Ooh  
Sun's going down on a Saturday  
And I feel all right, I feel okay
