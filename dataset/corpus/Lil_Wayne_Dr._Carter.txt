Where's my coffee?  
Good morning doctor carter (hey sweetie)  
Looks like its going to be a long day. (another one what we got?)  
Your first patient (yeah)  
Is suffering from a lack of concept (uh-huh)  
Originality (ugh)  
His flow is weak (another one)  
And he has no style (ugh)  
What'cha got for um?  
  
OK, let me put my gloves on and my scrubs on.  
Dr.carter to the rescue.  
Excuse me if I'm late,  
But like a thief it takes time to be this great  
Ha! so just wait, your style is a disgrace,  
Your rhymes are fifth place and I'm just grace.  
One, uno, ace and I'm tryin' to make your heart beat like bass,  
But your sweet like cake and I come to fix  
Whatever you shall break.  
Where is your originality?  
You are so fake so picture me like a gallery.  
Capture what I say.  
All I need is one mic.  
All I need is one take.  
Like hey, brighter then the sun ray got a pistols on the playground.  
Watch the gun-play like.  
No kidding, no kids in the way,  
But the kids do watch.  
Gotta watch what we say.  
Gotta work everyday.  
Gotta not be cliche.  
Gotta stand out like Andre 3k.  
Gotta kick it kick it like the sensei.  
You gotta have faith you gotta gotta wait wait  
Think I think I lost 'em  
  
Good afternoon doctor carter  
Nurse  
I don't know about this one  
His confidence is down  
Vocab and metaphors needs work  
And he lost respect for the game  
Ah let me see  
Think you can save him?  
  
OK.  
Respect is in the heart.  
So that's where I'm a start.  
And a lot of heart patients don't make it.  
Now hey kid  
Plural I graduated  
Cause you could get through anything if magic made it.  
And that was called recycling  
Or re-reciting  
Something cause you just like it  
So you say it just like it.  
Some say its biting  
But I say its enlightening  
Besides, Dr. Kanye West is one of the brightest.  
And Dr. Swizz can stitch your track up the tightest.  
And Dr. Jeezy can fix your back up the nicest.  
Arthritis in my hand from writing.  
But I'm a doctor they don't understand my writing.  
So I stop writing.  
Now I'm like lighting.  
And you ain't Vince Young so don't clash with the titans.  
Fast and exciting.  
My passion is frighting.  
Now let me put some more vocab in your i.v.  
Here take this Vicodin  
Like it and love it  
And confidence has no budget  
So pay me no mind  
I don't walk like I talk it cause I'm running  
I don't do it cause I done it and I'm in the emergency unit  
God damn it I've lost another one  
  
Good evening doctor carter its been a long day  
But this one looks much better then the others  
His respect is back up  
Concepts sound good his style is showing strong signs of improvement  
All he needs now is some swagger  
OK let me take my gloves off then  
  
Swagger tighter then a yeast infection.  
Fly go hard like geese erection.  
Fashion patrol police detection.  
I stay tight like Chinese connection.  
I stay tight like pussy at night.  
Baby don't get me wrong I could do that pussy right.  
But I'm too wrong to write.  
Too fresh to fight.  
Too paid to freestyle.  
Too paid to freestyle.  
I had to say it twice  
Swagger so nice.  
And don't ask me shit unless it concern a price.  
And I don't rap fast I rap slow.  
Cause I mean every letter in the words in the sentence of my quotes.  
Swagger just flow sweeter then honey oats.  
That swagger I got it I wear it like a coat.  
Wait, as I put the light down his throat.  
I can only see flow.  
His blood starting to flow.  
His lungs starting to grow.  
This one starting to show.  
Strong signs of life.  
Wheres the stitches here's the knife.  
Smack his face his eyes open I reply what a night.  
Welcome back hip hop I saved your life.  
  
He looks good  
His vitals are up  
He's looking good  
He's looking good  
I think we got one  
Doctor carter I think we got one  
Yup we got one  
We saved him  
He's good  
He's good  
We got one  
He's good  
He's good  
We got 'em  
He's a go  
He's good
