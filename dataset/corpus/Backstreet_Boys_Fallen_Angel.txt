I wanna know, I wanna know  
I wanna know, I wanna know  
  
I wanna know, I wanna know  
I wanna know, I wanna know  
  
You had me fooled  
You were so good at that  
I'm so unglued  
Too many pieces to put back  
And you were the best by far  
How did we end up like this?  
Don't even know who you are  
I can't believe it's like this  
I wanna know  
  
How does it feel to be a fallen angel?  
Your wings are lying on the ground  
How does it feel to be a fallen angel  
Forever is a long way down  
You were everything that I thought I wanted to be  
But everything has disappeared for me  
So how does it feel?  
How does it feel to be a fallen angel of love?  
  
I wanna know, I wanna know  
I wanna know, I wanna know  
  
I wanna know, I wanna know  
I wanna know, I wanna know  
  
I followed you to the deepest part of love  
And how do you destroy the life we built for us?  
And this is a mystery  
You played the part so well  
Now this is history  
Was I the last to tell?  
I wanna know  
  
How does it feel to be a fallen angel?  
Your wings are lying on the ground  
How does it feel to be a fallen angel  
Forever is a long way down  
You were everything that I thought I wanted to be  
But everything has disappeared for me  
So how does it feel?  
How does it feel to be a fallen angel of love?  
  
The only thing that's worse than emptiness  
Is when your heart's lost  
And the only thing that's worth the pain  
Is the price of what love costs  
Coz when you think it's all in your hands  
That's when it's gone  
And you're thinking you're invincible  
Believe me, you're so wrong  
Tell me how does it feel  
  
How does it feel to be a fallen angel?  
Your wings are lying on the ground  
How does it feel to be a fallen angel  
Forever is a long way down  
You were everything that I thought I wanted to be  
But everything has disappeared for me  
So how does it feel?  
How does it feel to be a fallen angel of love?  
  
Tell me how does it feel  
Tell me how does it feel  
I wanna know how it feels
