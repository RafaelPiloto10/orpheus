With a mind that's satisfied, with a mind that's satisfied  
That big ice cream cone in the sky floats right on by  
The satisfied mind never needs more, it never forgets whatever it's for  
Beyond control of hot and cold with a mind that's satisfied  
Each one goes together alone with a mind that's satisfied  
In the middle of a heat wave, an ice cold drink is a major find  
In the long dead end of winter, frozen lovers dream of fire  
With a mind that's satisfied, with a mind that's satisfied  
Lucky ones learn that love is blind, they don't deny  
The satisfied mind never needs more, never regrets and never keeps score  
Beyond control of hot and cold with a mind that's satisfied  
Each one goes together alone with a mind that's satisfied  
In the middle of a heat wave, an ice cold drink is a major find  
Simple fact you can depend on, bits and pieces of desire  
With a mind that's satisfied, that big ice cream cone floats on by  
With a mind that's satisfied, lucky ones learn that love is blind  
With a mind that's satisfied, the satisfied mind is satisfied  
The satisfied mind is satisfied, the satisfied mind is satisfied
