Why do I do, just as you say  
Why must I just, give you your way  
Why do I sigh, why don't I try, to forget  
  
It must have been, that something lovers call fate  
Kept me saying, "I have to wait"  
I saw them all, just couldn't fall, 'til we met  
  
It had to be you, it had to be you  
I wandered around, and finally found, the somebody who  
Could make me be true, and could make me be blue  
And even be glad, just to be sad, thinking of you  
  
Some others I've seen, might never be mean  
Might never be cross, or try to be boss  
But they wouldn't do  
For nobody else, gave me a thrill,  
With all your faults, I love you still  
It had to be you, wonderful you  
It had to be you
