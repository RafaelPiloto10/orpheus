As performed in the musical "tommy"  
Written by pete townsend  
  
You don't answer my call  
With even a nod or a twitch  
But you gaze at your own reflection!  
You don't seem to see me  
But I think you can see yourself  
How can the mirror affect you?  
  
Can you hear me?  
Or do I surmise  
That you fear me  
Can you feel my temper  
Rise, rise, rise, rise, rise...  
  
Do you hear or fear or do I smash the mirror?  
Do you hear or fear or do I smash the mirror?
