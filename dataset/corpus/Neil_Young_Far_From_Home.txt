When I was a growing boy  
A-rocking on my daddy's knee  
Daddy took an old guitar and sang  
Bury me on the lone prairie  
Uncle Bob sat at the piano  
My girl cousins sang harmony  
Those were the good old family times  
That left a big mark on me  
  
Bury me out on the prairie  
Where the buffalo used to roam  
Where the Canada geese once filled the sky  
And then I won't be far from home  
Bury me out on the prairie  
Where the buffalo used to roam  
You won't have to shed a tear for me  
'Cause then I won't be far from home  
  
Walking down the trans-Canada highway  
I was talking to a firefly  
Trying to make my way to Nashville, Tennessee  
When another car passed me by  
  
Some day I'm gonna make big money  
And buy myself a big old car  
Make my way on down to that promised land  
And then I'm gonna really go far  
  
Bury me out on the prairie  
Where the buffalo used to roam  
Where the Canada geese once filled the sky  
And then I won't be far from home  
Just bury me out on the prairie  
Where the buffalo used to roam  
You won't have to shed a tear for me  
'Cause then I won't be far from home
