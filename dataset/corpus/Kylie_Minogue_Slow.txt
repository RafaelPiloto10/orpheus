Knew you'd be here tonight  
so i put my best dress on  
Boy I was so right  
Our eyes connected  
Now nothin's how it used to be  
No second guesses  
Trackin' on this feelin'  
Pull focus close up you and me  
Nobody's leavin'  
Got me affected spun me 180 degrees  
So electric  
  
Slow down and dance with me, yeah  
Slow  
Skip a beat and move with my body, yeah  
Slow  
Come on and dance with me, yeah  
Slow  
Skip a beat and move with my body, yeah  
Slow  
  
don't want to rush it  
Let the rhythm pull you in  
This will touch it (Oh)  
You know what I'm sayin'  
And I haven't said a thing  
Keep the record playin'  
  
Slow down and dance with me, yeah  
Slow  
Skip a beat and move with my body, yeah  
Slow  
Come on and dance with me, yeah  
Slow  
Skip a beat and move with my body, yeah  
Slow

Take it down, down  
  
Slow down and dance with me, yeah  
Slow  
Skip a beat and move with my body, yeah  
Slow  
Come on and dance with me, yeah  
Slow  
Skip a beat and move with my body, yeah  
Slow  
Skip a beat and move with my body
