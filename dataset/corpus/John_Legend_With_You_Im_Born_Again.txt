(feat. Mariah Carey)  
  
[John Legend]  
Come bring me your softness  
Comfort me through all this madness  
Woman don't you know with you I'm born again  
  
[Mariah Carey]  
Come give me your sweetness  
Now there's you, there is no weakness  
Lying safe within your arms  
I'm born again  
  
[John Legend]  
I was half, not whole  
In step with none  
  
[Mariah Carey]  
Reaching through this world  
And need of one  
  
[Both]  
Come show me your kindness  
In your arms I know I'll find it  
  
[John Legend]  
Woman don't you know with you  
I'm born again  
  
[Mariah Carey]  
Lying safe with you  
I'm born again  
I am born again  
Yes I am  
  
[John Legend]  
Come bring me your softness  
Comfort me through all this madness  
Woman don't you know with you  
I'm born again  
  
[Mariah Carey]  
Come give me your sweetness  
Now there's you, there is no weakness  
Cause lying safe within your arms  
I'm born again  
  
[Both]  
Cause I was half not whole  
In step with none  
Reaching through this world  
In need of one  
Come show me your kindess  
In your arms I know I'll find it  
  
[John Legend]  
Woman don't you know with you  
  
[Both]  
I'm born again  
Lying safe with you I'm born again
