Hannah you're with me in spirit wherever I go  
To the ends of the earth and all points between high and low  
Each night by the stage you appear as you are  
The ever intangible child  
Ageless and timeless as Dorian Grey  
Oh Hannah I know that it's you and you're leading me on  
  
Hannah you're my inspiration my fountain of youth  
And as your surrogate leader I'm bound in your searach for the truth  
And yes how the truth rushes out  
When it's become honestly clear  
I see your anxious and curious eyes  
But Hannah I need you as much as you think you need me  
Come to your window tonight and we'll fly to your dreams  
And we'll  
  
Sing for the day sing for the moment  
Sing for the time of your life  
Come for an hour stay for a moment  
Stay for the rest of your life  
  
Hannah don't fail me I need you like never before  
Father time's at my back on my heels  
Behind every door (and he says)  
Son when the youth has but gone from your face  
Will she let you grow older with grace?  
Or will she give you up for one younger than you?  
Oh Hannah please tell me the things that he says are untrue  
Hannah I'm honestly hoping you'll always be there  
  
Sing for the day sing for the moment  
Sing for the time of your life  
Come for an hour stay for a moment  
Stay for the rest of your life
