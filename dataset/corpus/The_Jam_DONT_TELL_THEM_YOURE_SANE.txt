A boy I know is sick in his head  
At least that's what the doctors say he is  
Shut in his room for hours on end  
Looks like he's forgotten, but is he  
His mind it ticks, more than you know  
One day something in his head will click  
Warders fill him full of lies, he fights he knows  
They'll never convince him that he's mad!  
At breakfast he is strapped in a chair (won't go far)  
Just a word out of place, he's sent to his room  
Don't tell them you're sane  
They'll laugh and put you to sleep  
Don't tell them you're sane, but you are  
Tell me what you did today, was it good  
What was it like and who was it with  
Don't think I'm prying I'd just like to know  
Why it is you do things so slow  
Take him to the doctor, see what he says  
I don't know why he bothers, he's in for good
