I can't give you more than what I've got  
I can't expect to give what I have not  
I-I-I can only give ya lovin' 'till the sun goes down  
And, until the leaves of summer turn to shades of brown  
  
I try and I try  
But baby, you know that I  
Can only give you everything  
  
I can't argue with you to a-understand  
'Cause after all, I am just a man  
A you are on my mind  
When stars appear and shadows fall  
And when every little flower close  
And no birds call  
I try and I try  
But baby, you know that I  
Can only give you everything  
  
I'll do anything you want me to do  
'Cause I don't want to know there's life without you  
Ooh, ooh, ooh,  
Don't ever go and leave me in this world alone  
I-I-I'd be like a little child if I was on my own  
  
I try and I try  
But baby you know that I  
Can only give you everything  
  
Everything, baby  
A little bit of this, a little bit of that  
And everything  
Ooh, ooh, ooh  
  
Ooh, ooh, ooh  
Whoa, ooh, ooh  
Whoa, ooh, ooh  
Yeah, yeah, yeah
