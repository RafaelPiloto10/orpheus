Please,  
Don't put out this turd.  
It's a piece of crap to me  
Can hardly hear the words...  
  
Whatever happened to,  
The rights to Love me Do?  
We made Michael Jackson one rich mother.  
John wouldn't like this much,  
We used him as a crutch  
  
And now we feel so cheap, so...  
  
Please,  
This song's a turd,  
I'm not a Travelling Wilbury.  
This should not be heard  
I'm flipping Paul the Bird  
  
(Turned out like a piece of crap)
