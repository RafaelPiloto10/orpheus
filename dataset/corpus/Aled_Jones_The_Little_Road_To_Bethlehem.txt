As I walked down the road at set of sun  
The lambs were coming homewards one by one  
I heard a sheepbell softly calling them  
Along the little road to Bethlehem  
  
Beside an open door as I drew nigh  
I heard sweet Mary sing a lullaby  
She sang about the lambs at close of day  
And rocked her tiny King among the hay  
  
Across the air the silver sheepbells rang  
"The lambs are coming home," sweet Mary sang  
"Your star of gold, your star of gold is shining in the sky  
So sleep, my little King, go lullaby"  
  
As I walked down the road at set of sun  
The lambs were coming homewards one by one  
I heard a sheepbell softly calling them  
Along the little road to Bethlehem
