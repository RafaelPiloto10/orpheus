Please beware of them that stare  
They'll only smile to see you while  
Your time away  
And once you've seen what they have been  
To win the earth just won't seem worth  
Your night or your day  
Who'll hear what I say.  
Look around you find the ground  
Is not so far from where you are  
But not too wise  
For down below they never grow  
They're always tired and charms are hired  
From out of their eyes  
Never surprise.  
  
Take your time and you'll be fine  
And say a prayer for people there  
Who live on the floor  
And if you see what's meant to be  
Don't name the day or try to say  
It happened before.  
  
Don't be shy you learn to fly  
And see the sun when day is done  
If only you see  
Just what you are beneath a star  
That came to stay one rainy day  
In autumn for free  
Yes, be what you'll be.  
Please beware of them that stare  
They'll only smile to see you while  
Your time away  
And once you've seen what they have been  
To win the earth just won't seem worth  
Your night or your day  
Who'll hear what I say.  
  
Open up the broken cup  
Let goodly sin and sunshine in  
Yes that's today.  
And open wide the hymns you hide  
You find renown while people frown  
At things that you say  
But say what you'll say  
About the farmers and the fun  
And the things behind the sun  
And the people around your head  
Who say everything's been said  
And the movement in your brain  
Sends you out into the rain.
