Everyday I sit beside you  
On the bus to Madison Avenue  
Working the big gray store  
With the revolving door  
You don't even know my name  
I guess that I'm to blame  
Don't know the right things to say  
So I pretend away  
  
That I'm Rudolph Valentino  
Pull up in a limosine  
Oh won't you come in out of the rain  
Things will never be the same  
And then just like Greta Garbo  
You staring like there's no tomorrow  
And you know what I'm thinking of  
Right before your eyes I fall in love with you  
(Do do do do do do do do do do do)  
  
Tody I'm done with games  
Gonna ask you for your name  
Say I've been watching you  
I even know what you do  
Maybe today I'll tell you  
I've found the nerve to sell you  
On a guy like me  
Wishes that he could be  
  
Your Rudolph Valentino  
Pull up in a limosine  
Oh won't you come in out of the rain  
Things will never be the same  
And then just like Greta Garbo  
You're staring like there's no tomorrow  
And you know what I'm thinking of  
Right before your eyes I fall in love with you  
(Do do do...)  
  
(Repeat chorus to end of song)
