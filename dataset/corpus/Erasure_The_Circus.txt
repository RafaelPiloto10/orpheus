Call it new technology  
And they use it to burn  
And they show no concern  
Work for their prosperity  
While the big wheels turn  
Now it's too late to learn  
  
Don't upset the teacher  
Though we know he lied to you  
Don't upset the preacher  
He's gonna close his eyes for you  
  
And it's a shame  
That you're so afraid  
Just a worker waiting  
In the pouring rain  
Putting back the pieces  
Of a broken dream  
Putting back the pieces  
Of a broken dream  
  
Father worked in industry  
Now the work has moved on  
And the factory's gone  
See them sell your history  
Where once you were strong  
And you used to belong  
  
There was once a future  
For a working man  
There was once a lifetime  
For a skillful hand yesterday  
  
And it's a shame  
That you're so afraid  
Just a worker waiting  
In the pouring rain  
Putting back the pieces  
Of a broken dream  
Putting back the pieces  
Of a broken dream  
  
There was once a future  
For a working man  
There was once a lifetime  
For a skillful hand yesterday  
  
And it's a shame  
That you're so afraid  
Just a worker waiting  
In the pouring rain  
Putting back the pieces  
Of a broken dream  
Putting back the pieces  
Of a broken dream  
Putting back the pieces  
Of a broken dream  
Of a broken, of a broken dream
