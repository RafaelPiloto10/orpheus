Ride the wind son  
Through my eyes  
You'll see where you must stand  
  
Remember what your purpose is  
And that you were the brand  
  
Awaken in me if you can  
The deaths by one's own hand  
Remember where you came from  
And that you wear the brand...  
You wear the brand  
  
Blatant, born in fire  
With little more to say  
Than action speaks the loudest  
And yield the only way  
To quench the thirst,  
Desire, swifter than the hand  
In bloody fascination  
His pride to wear the brand  
  
Bend and twist and tear the will  
Show them where you've been  
A tribute to your Overkill  
A multitude of sin  
  
Away-away no time to stay  
The union it still stands  
Willingness, donation  
We all display, the brand
