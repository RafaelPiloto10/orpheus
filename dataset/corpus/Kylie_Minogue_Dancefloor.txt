Good times bad times baby you're in trouble  
You stole my heart and you're given me up  
And we're not even friends so how can we be lovers  
I wanna know the truth  
'cause I've had enough  
I'm sick and tired of pleasing you  
Have I had your love  
Is that the best you can do  
You can dream of changing my mind  
But your wasting your time  
'cause if you think you've got me right just watch me  
  
On the dance floor  
Gonna lose it in the music  
On the dance floor  
Got my body gonna use it  
On the dance floor  
The best that you never had but now you've lost me  
So come on watch me getting over you  
  
Had your chance but baby you blew it  
You never loved me and baby you knew it  
And every time that you messed with my mind  
I still believed in you  
  
'cause I've had enough  
I'm sick and tired of pleasing you  
Have I had your love  
Is that the best you can do  
You can dream of changing my mind  
But you're way out of line  
'cause if you think you've got me  
Boy just watch me  
  
On the dance floor  
Gonna lose it in the music  
On the dance floor  
Got my body gonna use it  
On the dance floor  
The best that you never had but now you've lost me  
So come on watch me getting over you
