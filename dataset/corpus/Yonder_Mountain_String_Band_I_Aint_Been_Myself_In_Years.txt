  
There's a voice blowing over the mountain  
A voice I used to know  
I'll bet you ten it's her again  
That girl from long ago  
  
She wanted California  
Got Oregon I hear  
Seems only fair to warn ya  
I ain't been myself in years  
  
What's left of it all went with her  
Packed up in broken dreams  
I'll tell ya friend I loved her then  
And I always will it seems  
  
Chorus:  
That evening breeze reminds me  
So soft against my ear  
Before she was behind me  
I ain't been myself in years  
  
Sometimes I hear her laughing  
Sometimes I see her face  
Sometimes I think she's coming back  
To fix this broken place  
So easy to see right through me  
Too late to change my ways  
I'll tell ya friend I loved her when  
I wasn't in this haze  
  
[ Chorus ]  
  
I ain't been myself in years
