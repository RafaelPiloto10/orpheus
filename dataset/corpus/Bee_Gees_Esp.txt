Dark is the night, high is the fire,  
Touches the sky, love with no shape or form.  
I am in your mind's eye, just let your dreams run wild.  
  
Somewhere, out across the nation,  
Someone, waiting in the shadows,  
Listen, I don't want to hear  
"return to sender"  
Calling. I can see the future,  
Someday, signal with a single motion  
Show me you believe in someone, somewhere.  
  
Oh baby, you give me,  
You give me the runaround,  
Just another night with you,  
You're on my mind.  
And we got love,  
And love'll take you higher and higher and higher,  
Higher and higher.  
  
E. S. P.  
I communicate with you,  
Tell me what it means to feel,  
What am I supposed to do.  
E. S. P.  
Nothing any words can say,  
Nothing that we know is real,  
But it'll take your breath away,  
Your breath away.  
  
Danger, suddenly an early warning,  
Suddenly the soul is burning,  
But I still believe in someone, somewhere.  
  
Baby, you give me,  
You give me the runaround,  
Just another night with you,  
I'm in your mind.  
And we got love,  
And love'll take you higher and higher and higher,  
Higher and higher.  
  
E. S. P.  
I communicate with you,  
Tell me what it means to feel,  
What am I supposed to do  
E. S. P.  
And love'll take you higher and higher and higher,  
Higher and higher.  
Be prepared to make your sacrifice, tonight,  
Far beyond the point of no return, oh no.  
And we got love,  
And love'll take you higher and higher and higher,  
Higher and higher, higher and higher,  
Higher and higher, higher and higher.  
  
Oh, oh, oh,  
What am I supposed to do,  
Supposed to do.  
Oh, oh, oh,  
But it'll take your breath away,  
Your breath away.  
  
E. S. P.  
I communicate with you,  
Tell me what it means to feel,  
What am I supposed to do,  
Supposed to do.  
E. S. P.  
Nothing any words can say,  
Nothing that we know is real,  
But it'll take your breath away,  
Your breath, your breath away.  
E.S.P.  
Nothing any words can say,  
Nothing that we know is real,  
But it'll take your breath away.
