Oh baby, baby  
How was I supposed to know  
That something wasn't right here  
Oh baby, baby  
I shouldn't have let you go  
And now you're out of sight  
Show me how you want it to be  
Tell me baby 'cause I need to know now,  
Oh because  
  
[Chorus]  
My loneliness is killing me  
(and I)  
I must confess I still believe  
(still believe)  
If I'm not with you I lose my mind  
Give me a sign  
Hit me baby one more time  
  
Oh baby, baby  
The reason I breathe is you  
Girl you got me blinded  
Oh pretty baby  
There's nothing that I wouldn't do  
It's not the way I planned it  
Show me how you want it to be  
Tell me baby 'cause I need to know now,  
Oh because  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh baby, baby  
How was I supposed to know  
Oh pretty baby, I shouldn't have let you go  
I must confess, that my loneliness  
Is killing me now  
Don't you know I still believe  
That you will be here  
And give me a sign  
Hit me baby one more time  
  
[Chorus]
