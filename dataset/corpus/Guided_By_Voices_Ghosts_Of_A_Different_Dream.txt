Friend of mine, what did you find?  
The fog of a nightmare dissipating  
A rolling sign better than mine  
The ghosts of a different dream are waiting  
A different kind of kiss  
The souls of a different mist are rolling  
I've been inside but missed  
The ghosts of an opening fist are calling  
  
The troops are led in tournament red  
In spite of the ogre's trumpet blaring  
A world of hate can't penetrate  
The crest of a different shield you're wearing  
A different kind of fight  
Keep those telephones-a-ringing  
I've been inside alright  
The ghosts of a different dream are singing
