[Chorus - Justin Timberlake] (Uncle Charlie Wilson)  
I'm not sure what I see

She's looking in my eyes, now I see no other guys  
Are you telling me this is a sign? (Ohhh!!!)  
  
[Snoop Dogg]  
Don't think about it, boy leave her alone  
(Ooh wee!!) nigga you ain't no G!  
She likes my tone, my colone and the way I roll, you ain't no G!  
  
[Verse - Snoop Dogg]

You know he's in - tune with the season  
Come here baby, tell me why you leaving?  
Tell me if it's weed that you needing

Where helicopters got cameras, just to get a glimpse of our Chucks  
And our Khakis and our bouncer cars

Mami, mamasita, have you ever - flown on G5s  
From London - to a beat hah? You gotta have cake

You'll see Venus and Serena, in the Wimbledon Arena  
And I can take you (Uncle Charlie, preach!!)  
  
[Bridge - Uncle Charlie Wilson] (Justin Timberlake)  
Nigga don't be young and foolish  
You don't know what you're doing  
You don't know what you've lost until she's gone (gone)  
And her pretty face, drove you wild  
But you ain't have that Snoop Doggy Dogg Style  
  
[Chorus - Justin Timberlake] (Uncle Charlie Wilson)
