Verse 1:  
  
There was this guy,  
A little smaller,  
He was great,  
And I was taller.  
He was the one I needed.  
I asked him out,  
But he said no,  
Just wanna be friends,  
But I'm sorry though.  
So I begged and pleeded.  
  
Chorus:  
  
So I was left heart broken.  
And no more words were spoken.  
The next day he didn't even speak.  
I looked away I felt so week.  
I didn't even get one kiss.  
How the hell can he do this.  
But he thinks it's alright again.  
So now still we are just friends.  
  
Verse 2:  
  
Still love him though,  
Atleast I tried,  
But I think I'd,  
Rather have died,  
But I'm dead over it.  
It took some time,  
To let him go,  
It wasn't easy,  
But I think we know,  
I like him a bit.  
  
Chorus x2  
No more words to be spoken,  
You left me heart broken.
