(One, two, three, four)  
  
Motives changing, day to day  
The fire increases, masks decay  
I look at the river, white foam floats down  
The body's poisoned, gotta sit tight  
  
The wait  
The wait  
The wait  
The wait  
  
After wakening, silence grows  
The screams subside, distortion shows  
Mutant thoughts, of bad mouthed news  
It's just another birth, of distorted views  
  
The wait  
The wait  
The wait  
The wait  
  
The wait  
The wait  
The wait  
The wait
