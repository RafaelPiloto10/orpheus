Look at the lady with the crazy stare in her eyes  
Looks way past 50 though she's barely 35  
Sleeps most days in the city park  
Every night down at Casey's bar  
And if she talks at all you hear her say  
"I was a lovely girl in my younger days"  
She was the prettiest girl this town had ever seen  
But she dressed too gaudy for the likes of the people here  
Out every night living life to the full  
A string of men at her beck and call  
But smalltown people got smalltown ways  
And soon she was stuck with a brandnew name  
Hey Virgin Mary  
Lover of lovers  
How many others  
Your bed is never empty  
It must bring you plenty  
Oh that fateful night there was thunder in the air  
The women were angry and the men felt like a share  
A lynch mob frenzy came over the town  
Grabbed hold of Mary, threw her down to the ground  
The first man there that had Mary laid  
Staggered back with shock on his face  
Hey Virgin Mary  
Be true to your name  
We've put you to shame  
You're not what we thought  
The victim of talk!  
Hey Virgin Mary  
Rumour was your ruin  
Evil talk was your undoing  
Heavy on the conscience  
Jealous talk and nonsense  
You were really like your name  
And we put you to shame  
You're not really what we thought  
Jealous talk and nonsense
