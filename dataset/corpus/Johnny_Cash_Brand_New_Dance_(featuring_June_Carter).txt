Baby you're tired I can see in your eyes, I know how you feel  
We've been together too long to conceal  
What's in our hearts maybe we should part but after so many years  
That would only bring loneliness, sorrow and tears and anyway  
  
I never could, never would, never will ever kill what's between us  
So let's try again, we'll start a brand new dance between old friends  
  
There will always be days when it don't seem to pay  
When it just doesn't rhyme  
Well let's bound to happen some of the time  
Our best days ain't gone, we don't need to move on  
Well maybe we could try  
But I don't think you can make it and neither could I and anyway  
  
I never could, never would, never will ever kill what's between us  
So let's try again, we'll start a brand new dance between old friends  
  
Baby, come here love ain't disappeared, you're just feeling low  
And let me tell you my darling, it's a feeling I know  
It don't mean too much we just got out of touch  
Well that's easy to change  
'Cause loving you ain't too hard to arrange  
And anyway  
  
I never could, never would, never will ever kill what's between us  
So let's try again, we'll start a brand new dance between old friends
