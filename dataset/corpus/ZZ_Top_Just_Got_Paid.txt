I just got paid today,  
Got me a pocket full of change.  
Said, I just got paid today,  
Got me a pocket full of change.  
If you believe like workin' hard all day,  
Just step in my shoes and take my pay.  
  
I was born my papa's son,  
When I hit the ground I was on the run.  
I had one glad hand and the other behind.  
You can have yours, just give me mine.  
When the hound dog barkin' in the black of the night,  
Stick my hand in my pocket, everything's all right.  
  
I just got paid today,  
Got me a pocket full of change.  
Said, black sheep, black, do you got some wool?  
Yes, I do, man, my bag is full.  
It's the root of evil and you know the rest  
But it's way ahead of what's second best.
