"I saw a dead skunk on the highway  
And I was goin' crazy from the smell  
Cause when the wind was blowin' my way  
It smelled just like the halls of old Rydell  
And if you've gotta use the toilet  
And later on you start to scratch like hell  
Take off your underwear and boil it  
Cause you've got memories of old Rydell  
Girls:  
I can't explain Rydell, this pain Rydell  
Is it ptomaine Rydell gave me  
Guys"  
Is it V. D. Rydell  
Could be Rydell  
All:  
You outta see the faculty  
  
If Mister Clean, Rydell  
Had seen Rydell  
He'd just turn green and disappear  
I'm outta luck Rydell  
Dead duck Rydell  
I'm stuck Rydell, right here"
