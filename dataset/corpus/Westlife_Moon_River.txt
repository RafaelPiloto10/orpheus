Moon River wider than a mile  
I'm crossing you in style someday  
Oh, dream maker, you heartbreaker  
Wherever you're going, I'm going your way  
Two drifters off to see the world  
There's such a lot of world to see  
We're after the same rainbows end  
Waiting 'round the bend  
My huckleberry friend, Moon River and me  
(Moon River off to see the world)  
(There's such a lot of world to see)  
We're after the same rainbows end  
Waiting round the bend  
My huckleberry friend, Moon River and me
