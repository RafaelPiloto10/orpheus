Had a bad day, don't talk to me, gonna ride this out.  
My little black heart breaks apart, with your big mouth.  
I'm sick of my sickness. Don't touch me, you'll get this.  
I'm useless, lazy, perverted, and you hate me  
  
You can't save me, you can't change me.  
Well I'm waiting for my wake-up call, and everything, everything's my fault.  
  
Went to the doctor, and I asked her to make this stop.  
Got medication, a new addiction, fuckin' thanks a lot!  
Had to relapse, I'm outta rehab, ruins everything.  
So point your finger, at the singer, he's in the pharmacy.  
  
You can't save me, you can't change me.  
Well I'm waiting for my wake up call, and everything's my fault.  
You can't save me, you can't blame me.  
Well I'm waiting here to take a fall,  
And everything, and everything's my fault.  
  
And I'm a death threat, haven't slept yet,  
Baby why the wake up call?  
I'm a bad boy, tell the tabloids, everything's my fault!  
  
Whoa whoa yeah, write it write it!  
Whoa whoa everything's my fault, everything's my fault.  
  
I went to heaven, but couldn't get in, for what I have done.  
I said 'Please take me!', he said 'You're crazy, you had too much fun.'  
  
You can't save me, you can't change me.  
Well I'm waiting for my wake up call, and everything's my fault.  
You can't save me, you can't blame me.  
Well I'm waiting here to take a fall,  
And everything, and everything's my fault.
