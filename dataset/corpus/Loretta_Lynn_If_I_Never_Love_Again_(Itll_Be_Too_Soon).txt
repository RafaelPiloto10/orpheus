All the heartaches that I've known would fill the sea  
Oh I'm lonesome and you'll be callin' me yeah callin' me  
Oh mem'ries fill my little lonely room  
And if I never love again it'll be too soon  
Can't help turnin' by each love I've ever had  
And your leavin' hurt the worst it hurt so bad it hurt me bad  
For misery cast its shadow on the moon  
And if I never love again it'll be too soon  
I don't wanna see another road than blue  
And if I never love again it'll be too soon  
No I don't wanna ever see another road than blue  
And if I never never love again it'll be too soon
