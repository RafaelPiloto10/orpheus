Lest we forget  
The speed at which the world is turning  
Careering through space and time  
On her fatalistic journey  
  
It scares me half to death  
That we tear ourselves apart  
A war of love or religion  
Close your eyes to the screaming  
  
Now are we pleased?  
How are we free?  
See how this obsession  
Turns the love to anger  
  
East calling west  
Falling onto stony groud  
We are lost in our vision  
We are primitive and fearless  
  
We send our message of confusion  
Across the great divide  
With our eyes full of wonder  
Still the world goes spinning by  
  
Now are we pleased?  
How are we free?  
See how this obsession  
Turns the love to anger  
  
Love is where the dream should lie  
It's not for us to reason why  
Or to ponder over strategy  
  
So come with us and take a ride  
Somewhere in the big blue sky  
Before it's too late, it's too late, it's too late  
  
Hope you find it baby  
What you're lookin' for  
Doesn't really matter  
If you're rich or poor  
'Cause you've had your day  
Yes you had your day  
  
Now are we pleased?  
How are we free?  
See how this obsession?  
Turns the love to anger
