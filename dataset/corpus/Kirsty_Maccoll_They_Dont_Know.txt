(kirsty maccoll)  
You've been around for such a long time now  
Or maybe I could leave you but I don't know how  
And why should I be lonely every night  
When I can be with you, oh yes you make it right  
  
And I don't listen to the guys who say  
That you're bad for me and I should turn you away  
Cause they don't know about us  
And they've never heard of love  
  
I get a feeling when I look at you  
Wherever you go now I want to be there too  
They say we're crazy but I just don't care  
And if they keep on talkin' still they get nowhere  
  
So I don't mind if they don't understand  
When I look at you and you hold my hand  
Cause they don't know about us  
And they've never heard of love  
  
Why should it matter to us if they don't approve  
We should just take our chances while we've got nothing to lose  
  
Baby  
There's no need for living in the past  
Now I found good loving gonna make it last  
I tell the others don't bother me  
Cause when they look at you they don't see what I see  
  
No I don't listen to their wasted lines  
Got my eyes wide open and I see the signs  
But they don't know about us  
And they've never heard of love  
  
No I don't listen to their wasted lines  
Got my eyes wide open and I see the signs  
But they don't know about us  
And they've never heard of love
