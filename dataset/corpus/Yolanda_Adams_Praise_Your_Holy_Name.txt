Tears streaming down, her heart is broken  
Because her life is hurting, so am I  
He wears a frown, his dreams are choking  
And because he stands alone, his dreams will die  
  
So, humbly I come to you and say  
As I sound aloud the warfare of today  
Hear me, I pray  
  
What about the children?  
To ignore is so easy  
So many innocent children  
Would choose the wrong way  
  
So what about the children?  
Remember when we were children?  
And if not for those who loved us  
And who cared enough to show us  
Where would we be today?  
  
Sir, where is your son? Where lies his refuge?  
And if he can't come to you, then where can he run?  
Such a foolish girl, yet still she's your daughter  
And if you will just reminisce your days of young  
  
You see, it's not where you've been  
Nor what you've done because I know a friend  
Who specializes in great outcomes  
See his love overcomes  
  
And what about the children?  
To ignore is so easy  
So many innocent children  
Would choose the wrong way  
  
Yes, what about the children?  
Remember when we were children?  
And if not for those who loved us  
And who cared enough to show us  
Where would we be today?  
  
What about the children?  
Don't just turn and walk away  
What about the children?  
They need our love and our help today  
  
Yes, what about the children?  
Remember when we were children?  
And if not for those who loved us  
And who cared enough to show us  
Where would we be today?  
  
Where would we be today?  
Where would we be today?  
What about the children?
