The very best part of Halloween  
Is getting more candy than you've ever seen.  
I've got my scariest costume on.  
I scare myself when I'm all alone.  
  
Sun goes down, I'm all dressed up,  
I set out to try my luck.  
Walkin' up and down the street,  
I knock on the door and say...  
  
Trick or treat, trick or treat, Give me something good to eat.  
Trick or treat, trick or treat, Give me something good to eat.  
  
The very first house is big and dark,...  
  
Trick or treat, trick or treat, Give me something good to eat.  
Trick or treat, trick or treat, Give me something good to eat.  
  
The very next house is big and white,...  
  
Trick or treat, trick or treat, Give me something good to eat.  
Trick or treat, trick or treat, Give me something good to eat.  
  
If you go out Halloween night,  
I'll give you a tip that'll make it all right.  
Smile at everyone that you meet.  
Knock on the door and say...  
  
Trick or treat, trick or treat, Give me something good to eat.  
Trick or treat, trick or treat, Give me something good to eat.
