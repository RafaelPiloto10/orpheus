Can you see her little eyes?  
Can you see her little hands?  
Don't you think she looks just like me?  
Can you hear her little scream?  
Can you hear her little cry?  
Don't you think she sounds just like me?  
  
[Chorus]  
You have friends and we have reasons  
I can't meet you face-to-face  
There are no corners to hide in my room  
No doors, no windows, no fireplace  
  
My love is only for me  
My love needs nobody else  
Did you know that my love is a liquid?  
I could talk to me for years  
I can't speak to you at all  
Did you know that friends come in boxes?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Save your money buy a tube  
Let your body flow inside  
Watch it grow before your eyes  
Watch it grow before your eyes  
  
[Chorus]
