I couldn't stay around and finish High School  
I had to hit the streets as soon as I could  
Now I'm running, always running  
As I turned out the way they said I would  
  
Daddy told me all about chasing women  
Watched my Momma lose her mind and all her hope  
Now the only thing that's left of my pathetic life  
Is dangling at the end of a rope  
What's done is done  
  
Had me way too much fun  
Now I'm running from a man with a gun  
Looking back over my shoulder, but I won't get much older  
What's done is done  
Lord, what's done is done  
  
Started hanging with the wrong kind of people  
Fooling with the wrong kind of folks  
Made my living doing things, got me locked up in chains  
As I went the way they said I'd go  
  
Ahhh, what's done is done  
Had me way too much fun  
Now I'm running from a man with a gun  
Looking back over my shoulder, but I won't get much older  
  
What's done is done  
Had me way to much fun  
Ohhh, running from a man with a gun  
Looking back over my shoulder, but I won't get much older  
What's done is done  
  
Oh what's done is done  
Hey, ya, done is done  
ohh what's done is done
