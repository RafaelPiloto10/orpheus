Easy lovin' so sexy lookin' I know from the feelin' it comes from the heart  
Easy lovin' everyday's things givin'  
To count on my blessin's I would know where to start  
Everytime I look you over so real to life it seems  
Mhm upon your pretty shoulders there's a pair of angel wings  
Easy lovin' seein's believin' life with you is like livin' in a beautiful
dream  
Everytime I look you over  
Easy lovin'
