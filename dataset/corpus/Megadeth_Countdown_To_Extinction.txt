Endangered species, caged in fright,  
Shot in cold blood, no chance to fight.  
The stage is set, now pay the price.  
And ego boost, don't think twice.  
Technology, the battle's unfair,  
You pull the hammer without a care.  
Squeeze the trigger that makes you Man,  
Pseudo-safari, the hunt is canned...  
The hunt is canned  
All are gone, all but one.  
No contest, nowhere to run.  
No more left, only one.  
This is it, this is the Countdown to Extinction  
Tell the truth, you wouldn't dare.  
The skin and trophy, oh so rare.  
Silence speaks louder than words.  
Ignore the guilt and take your turn.  
'Liars' anagram is "lairs,"  
Man you were never even there.  
Killed a few feet from the cages,  
Point blank, you're so courageous...  
So courageous  
"One hour from now,  
Another species of life form  
Will disappear from the face of the planet  
Forever... And the rate is accelerating."
