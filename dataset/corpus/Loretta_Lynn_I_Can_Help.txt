If you've got a problem I don't care what it is  
If you need a hand I can assure you of this  
I can help I've got two loving arms I can help  
It would sure do me good to do you good I can help  
It's a fact that people get lonely ain't nothing new  
But a man like you baby should never have the blues  
I can help I've got two for me I can help  
It would sure do me good to do you good let me help  
Oh when I go to sleep at night you're always a part of my dreams  
Holdin' me tight and tellin' me everything I wanna hear  
Oh don't forget me baby all you gotta do is call  
You know that I love you you if I can do anything at all  
Let me help if your child needs a mama I can help  
Oh it would sure do me good to do you good let me help  
[ steel ]  
Oh when I go to sleep at night...  
Oh it would sure do me good to do you good let me help
