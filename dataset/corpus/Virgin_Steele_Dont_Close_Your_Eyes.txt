Don't go, don't leave me here alone  
With nothing but a memory to call my own  
We shared each day, and the days to years  
But now the love we share is blinded by tears  
  
Look in my eyes and speak to me  
Can you really forget me?  
Ooh in the light you'll be alright  
But every evening I'll be haunting you  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't close your eyes tonight  
'Cause you know I'll be there in your dreams  
  
Oh babe don't go, don't go  
Don't leave me here alone  
Forget me not whatever you do  
And please remember that  
I still love you  
  
I made it clear I need you here  
Every night I cry for you  
And do you know I can't let go?  
Open up your arms I'm coming home  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I made it clear I need you here  
Every night I cry for you  
And do you know I can't let go?  
Open up your arms I'm coming home  
  
[Chorus]
