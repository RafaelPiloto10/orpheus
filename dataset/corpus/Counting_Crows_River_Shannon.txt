Oh Shannon  
I might be dreaming'  
The stars fell down on the factory  
The cathedrals repeating, the light receding  
Bells on another day  
Have you ever seen my face  
Fast asleep and dreaming'?  
Oh Shannon  
The lightning' fell  
There's an army down by the riverside  
But I might be dreaming'  
I can see that you don't believe me  
And I might be dreaming'  
If I dip into your water  
Fall through my reflection  
I will shadow myself anyway  
Have you ever seen my face  
Fast asleep and dreaming'?  
And it don't seem right  
That I don't get no sleep at night  
What's the river gonna know about leaving'?  
Oh Shannon  
The soldiers are coming'  
The guns are drumming' the night away  
Rain, rain go away  
Come again some other day  
When I got time for believing'  
Have you ever seen my face  
Fast asleep and dreaming'?  
Yeah! What is there left to believe in?!  
Oh Shannon  
I might be dreaming'  
I might be wasting' my life away  
Listening' to you  
Down on under the streetlight  
You shudder and beat  
The edge of the waterway  
And I know if I had time  
I might dive in your water  
Lie right down in the evening rain  
I just want this pain, pain to go away  
Come again some other day  
When I got time for bleeding'  
Have you ever seen my face  
Fast asleep and dreaming'?  
And it don't seem right that I don't get no sleep at night  
What's the river gonna know about leaving'?  
Oh Shannon  
I might be dreaming'
