Big lies  
Surprise  
You've thought of everything  
It builds your character you know  
No way  
Ok  
So what's the price you pay?  
Too late to realize you're broke  
  
Do you think that everything worked out?  
It's good to see you've finally made it  
Can't you see you're lying to yourself?  
  
But this was all your choice  
Do you think it makes a difference now?  
But this was all your choice  
It's good to see it hasn't changed you  
  
You've tried  
Denied  
Can't win at everything  
It's building character you know  
Don't wait  
Too late  
You've got a choice to make  
It's time to do what you've been told  
  
Aren't you glad that everything worked out?  
It's good to see you've finally made it  
Can't you see you're lying to yourself?
