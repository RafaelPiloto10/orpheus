The bittersweet sadness of time passing by  
Trying to hold back the years  
you try to reach out and touch yesterday  
But yesterday just disappears  
  
We've shared a lot of sadness  
We've shared a lot of pain  
Let's make good use of the time that remains  
  
Let's make every moment count  
Let's taste the richness of life to it's fullest amount  
Between me and you and all we've been through  
There are no problems that we can't surmount  
Let's make every moment count  
Let's make every moment count  
  
I still remember the day we first meet  
We both didn't have a care  
The years have flown, but we've both grown  
We're none of the worse for the wear  
  
We're only just beginning  
I'm still your lover and your friend  
And it's never too late to dream again  
  
You say we've seen the best of all our memories  
But if your heart and soul are in it  
We'll make a new one every minute
