This is the moment, we'll remember  
Every day for the rest of out lives  
Time may rush us, hurt or love us  
  
But on this day we have arrived  
  
It's been a long time coming  
We've been in the running for so long  
But now we're on our way  
Let the ride just take us  
Side by side and make us  
See the world through new eyes every day  
  
You're a winner  
I'm a winner  
This is all happening so fast  
You're a winner  
I'm a winner  
Let's enjoy it all while it lasts  
  
I've been a loser, I've paid my dues  
I fought my way up from the ground  
Now at this moment, the crowd acclaim us  
Will you just listen to that song  
  
It's been a long time coming  
We've been in the running for so long  
But now we're on our way  
Let the ride just take us  
Side by side and make us  
See the world through new eyes every day  
  
You're a winner  
I'm a winner  
This is all happening so fast  
You're a winner  
I'm a winner  
Let's enjoy it all while it lasts  
  
It took us so long  
And we worked so hard  
We came so far just to compete  
But don't forget all  
The love and laughter  
Now the world is at our feet  
Looking back on all the times  
We felt downcast  
Didn't think we were going anywhere  
Just living in the past  
But in that desperation  
You get inspiration  
  
You're a winner  
I'm a winner  
This is all happening so fast  
You're a winner  
I'm a winner  
Let's enjoy it all while it lasts  
  
'Cause you're a winner  
Took so long, we worked so hard  
We came so far and just to compete  
But don't forget all  
The love and laughter  
Now the world is at our feet  
  
You're a winner  
I'm a winner  
This is hapWening so fast  
You're a winner  
I'm a winner  
Let's enjoy it all while it lasts  
'Cause you're a winner
