I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you  
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you  
And if you ever say goodbye  
And if you ever even try  
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you  
  
I'm gonna love you more and more every day  
I'm gonna love you more and more every way  
And if you ever say goodbye  
And if you ever even try  
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you  
  
I'm gonna tell your mama  
Tell your papa too  
So they'll know exactly what i'm gonna do  
If you ever say goodbye  
If you ever even try  
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you  
  
Wah-hoo!  
  
I'm gonna tell your mama  
Tell your papa too  
So they'll know exactly what i'm gonna do  
If you ever say goodbye  
If you ever even try  
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you  
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you  
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
