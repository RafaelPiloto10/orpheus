The crowd was getting old  
The disco's back or so I'm told  
But we've got nothing here  
Except a tired set of ears and we say  
  
Hey mama, I'm something  
Check it out, see what it's all about  
Cos this is soap disco, so charming  
See the floor from a cleaner point of view  
  
The children had the time  
To overthrow the slime  
The superchildren said they could see  
  
Bright lights and clean colors  
Check it out, see what it's all about  
Cos this is soap disco, so charming  
See the floor from a cleaner point of view  
  
Bright lights and clean colors  
Check it out, see what it's all about  
Cos this is soap disco, so charming  
See the floor from a cleaner point of view  
  
Hey mama, I'm something  
Check it out, see what it's all about  
Cos this is soap disco, so charming  
See the floor from a cleaner point of view
