Who are you girl?  
Who are you boy?  
Bet I know what you're up to  
Can I come along  
Your home number's on the wall  
I just had to call, had to  
I'm not the only one  
Who will run with a knife  
  
[Chorus]  
Open up your eyes  
Open up your room  
Open up your arms  
  
One six two seven eight  
Two six three seven eight nine  
Where's your daddy now  
I heard he ran away  
Who are you girl?  
  
'Cause I'm so bored with myself  
Anyway  
Any time and any place  
I'll just hang around  
  
[Chorus]  
  
One six two seven eight  
Two six three seven eight nine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Open up your eyes  
Open up your room  
Open up your arms  
Open up your door  
Open up your eyes  
Open up your room
