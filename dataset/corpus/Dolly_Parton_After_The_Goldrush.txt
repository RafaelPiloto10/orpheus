Well I dreamed I saw the knight in armor coming  
Saying something about a king  
There were peasants singing and drummers drumming  
And the archer split the tree  
  
There was a fanfare blowing to the sun  
That was floating on the breeze  
Look at mother nature on the run  
In the twenty-first century  
Look at mother nature on the run  
In the twenty-first century  
  
I was lying in a burned out basement  
With the full moon in my eyes  
I was hoping for replacement  
When the sun burst through the sky  
  
There was a band playing in my head  
And I felt like I could cry  
I was thinking about what a friend had said  
I was hoping it was a lie  
Thinking about what a friend had said  
I was hoping it was a lie  
  
Well I dreamed I saw the silver spaceships flyin'  
In the yellow haze of the sun  
There was laughing, crying and colors flying  
All around the chosen one  
  
All in a dream, all in a dream, the loading had begun  
Flying mother nature's silver seed to a new home in the sun  
They were flying mother nature's silver seed to a new home
