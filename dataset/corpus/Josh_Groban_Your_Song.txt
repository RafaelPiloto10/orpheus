My gift is my song... And this one's for you  
And you can tell everybody that this is your song  
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done  
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind  
That I put down in words...  
How wonderful life is, now you're in the world  
  
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss  
Well some of these verses, well they,  
They've got me quite cross  
But the sun's been kind while I wrote this song  
It's for people like you that keep it turned on  
  
So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do  
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue  
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean  
Yours are the sweetest eyes, I've ever seen  
  
And you can tell everbody that this is your song  
It may be quite simple but now that it's done  
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind  
That I put down in words  
How wonderful life is, now you're in the world  
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind  
That I put down in words  
How wonderful life is, now you're in the world
