Let me sigh, let me cry when I'm blue,  
Let me go away from this lonely town,  
Won't be long till my sun will be blue,  
Cause I know I'm on my last go round.  
All the love I could steal, beg or borrow,  
Wouldn't heal all the pain in my soul.  
  
What is love? Only a prelude to sorrow,  
With a heartbreak ahead for your goal,  
Here I go, now you know why I'm leaving.  
Got the blues. What can I lose? Goodbye!  
  
What is love? Only a prelude to sorrow,
