It's like staring at the sky above  
When I look in your eyes  
Now where in the world did you come from?  
You're so beautiful and I know  
Oh, I can't escape your love  
Escape your love, escape your love  
I can't escape your love  
Escape your love, escape your love  
Every time I turn around you're there  
I get a feeling that won't go away  
Nothing else in this whole world compares  
You're surrounding me and I know  
That I can't escape your love  
Escape your love, escape your love  
I can't escape your love  
Escape your love, escape your love  
And in the righteous crowd  
Your face is all I see  
I hope you know by now  
That I just can't escape, yeah  
Oh, I can't escape your love  
Escape your love, escape your love  
Oh, I can't escape your love  
Escape your love, escape your love  
Oh, I can't escape your love  
Escape your love, escape your love, oh yeah, yeah
