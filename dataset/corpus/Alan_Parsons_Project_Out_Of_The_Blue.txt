Out of the blue  
I come sailing  
Through the years  
Through the years  
What do I do?  
Now that I've seen  
All our hopes  
And all of our fears  
  
And I'm riding a lonely highway  
I'm the man from out of the blue  
Yes I'm riding a lonely highway  
I'm the man from out of the blue  
  
I travel far  
Yet no distance  
I'm still here  
Always here  
So follow the call  
To our senses  
Still there's hope  
Behind the fear  
  
And I'm riding a lonely highway  
'cause I'm the man from out of the blue  
  
And I'm riding a lonely highway  
I'm the man from out of the blue  
  
Yes I'm riding a lonely highway  
I'm the man from out of the blue
