Papa, who's to blame  
Why you never had your fortune and fame  
Papa what did you gain  
To leave the love you had for a two-bit dame  
Papa why did you turn your back  
Why didn't you stay on track  
Why did you leave and make her cry  
Papa you meant to the world to me  
Why did you abandon me  
Now it's a long and sad goodbye  
  
Papa what is this game  
With all that cheating you did you're going to go insane  
Papa I am in pain  
Cause on the day you left you said I'd do the same  
Papa, why did you turn your back  
Why didn't you stay on track  
Why did you leave and make her cry  
Papa you meant that world to me  
Why did you abandon me  
Now it's a long and sad goodbye  
  
Papa  
No  
Oh papa  
Papa  
Oh papa  
No  
Oh papa  
  
Why did you turn your back  
Why didn't you stay on track  
Why did you leave and make her cry  
Papa you meant the world to me  
Why did you abandon me  
Now it's a long and sad goodbye  
  
Papa  
No  
Oh papa  
Oh papa  
Oh papa  
No no no stay
