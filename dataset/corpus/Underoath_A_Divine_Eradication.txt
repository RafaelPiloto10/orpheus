Between motionless and this retched state of digression  
Treading on the line that I drew from my own compliance  
Let me feel it rain down  
I cannot wait any longer  
Let's get something straight I am not who you made me out to be  
  
It's the awakening of my bodies inner consciousness  
A fraction of my sleepless numb existence  
  
Rain down now on me  
  
Pick and pull apart my limbs  
Push me down now from your throne  
Drag me down now to the floor  
Press the point into my skin  
Oh I feel it now  
  
Something will have to collide  
To end the constant spinning of cycles  
Strung together and I'm crawling in the streets  
  
Where is my fix  
  
I stand alone in time  
When they spun away I fell apart
