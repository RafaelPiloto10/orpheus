Words could never say it  
Words could never say it  
I know now you're gone  
And I can't go on  
  
Where could you be tonight  
I'm sayin' my sorry  
Baby I'm sorry  
  
'Cause without your love in my life I'll die  
I was wrong  
I was so wrong  
  
And I'm so scared  
What can I do now  
When I close my eyes  
All I see is you  
  
Now words could never say it  
Words could never say it  
If there's a reason why  
Say it's a lie  
  
Words could never say it  
How I feel now  
Now that you're gone  
Now that you're gone  
  
Now that you're gone  
We made it now  
We made it love  
We made such fools  
Of ourselves  
We made it up now  
You made it up oh yeah  
  
You know you made it hard  
We made it fast  
I always thought  
It would last  
We took a bow  
We did it all oh yeah  
  
Words could never say  
Could never say  
Could only play  
Someone could say  
Would only playing with ourselves  
  
Words could never say  
How I feel now  
Some how  
I've got find a way  
  
Cause when I dream at night alls I see is you  
You're wantin' me  
And me havin' you  
  
Now words could never say it  
Words could never say it  
Every time I try  
I get lost inside
