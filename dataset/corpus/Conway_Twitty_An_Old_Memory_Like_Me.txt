There's a clock on the wall  
At the end of the hall  
That hasn't kept time in years  
There's an old tattered bear  
In the bedroom somewhere  
'Cause you can't hardly sleep 'less it's near  
  
There's an old box of letters  
I know you still save  
'Cause you're too sentimental  
To throw them away  
But is there room in your heart  
For an old memory like me  
  
There's an old satin gown  
Been twice handed down  
You were savin' for your wedding day  
But you married in haste  
What a terrible waste  
And it never got used anyway  
  
There's a bottle of champagne  
It's French 59  
But you might as well drink it  
To happier times  
Is there room in your heart  
For an old memory like me  
  
I used to tease you  
'Cause you couldn't part with  
Things that were no use at all  
Now I'm afraid that you'll  
Toss them away after all  
  
Like the clock on the wall  
At the end of the hall  
That hasn't kept time in years  
Like the old tattered bear  
In the bedroom somewhere  
You can't hardly sleep 'less it's near  
  
There's a bottle of champagne  
It's French 59  
But you might as well drink it  
To happier times  
Is there room in your heart  
For an old memory like me  
  
Is there room in your heart  
For an old memory like me
