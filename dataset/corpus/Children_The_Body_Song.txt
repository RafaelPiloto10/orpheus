I am the eye, I go blink, blink,  
Yes, I am the eye and I can wink,  
I am the eye but I can't think,  
That belongs to my friend the brain.  
  
Fritter fratter frit, fritter fratter frit,  
I'm the brain with electric current patter pit,  
I'm the brain and I fritter learning bit by bit,  
Yes I fritter fratter fritter all the time.  
  
I go lub dub, lub dub I go.  
I am the heart, I pump like so.  
I'm bringing life to all the parts,  
I am consistent, I'm the heart.  
  
Swinging, I'm swinging,  
Swinging on life's merry way.  
I'm the arm, I'm the arm,  
Bringing grace to all.  
  
Hearing, hearing,  
Small ears, hearing,  
We don't, miss much,  
Hearing all the time.  
  
We are the body of Christ,  
We are the body of Christ,  
Together bringing His love to the world.
