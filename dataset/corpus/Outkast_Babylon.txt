I came into this world high as a bird  
From second hand cocaine powder  
I know it sounds absurd  
I never tooted but its in my veins  
While the rest of the country bungees off bridges  
Without no snap back  
And bitches they say they need that  
To shake they fannies in the ass clubs  
They go the other route  
Turn each other out  
Burn each other out  
Where a bonified nigga like me  
Can't even get no back rub these days  
Ain't that bleak on they part  
But let me hold it down  
Cause they shut you down  
When you speak from your heart  
Now that's hard  
While we ranting and raving bout gats  
Nigga they made them gats  
They got some shit that'll blow out our backs  
From where they stay at  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, I fear the battle's just begun  
Oh, though we're here someday we will be gone  
So I'm hoping, wishing, praying  
To keep my faith in you, in you  
  
(yo, yo, yo in background)  
  
I'm fascinated by the way yo  
Nipples peak at me through yo blouse  
Freaky me, freaky you  
Can't help but be aroused  
'scuse me lord less for thinking  
But that's the way we was brought up  
Sneaking to watch playboy at night  
We all must be caught up in worldly ways  
Chemistry between boys and girls  
Is a lot like when we went to the woods  
And laid with the squirrels  
During P.E., we'd be  
Exploring each others privates  
Hunching with all our clothes on  
Until we felt excited then,  
Oh now its on from here on out  
Put yo hands in the atmosphere  
If you know what I'm talking bout  
Now if two hearts done walk on out  
And I see you on the next song  
They call it horny  
Because its devilish  
Now see we dead wrong  
  
[Chorus]  
  
People don't know the stress I'm dealing with day to day  
Speaking about the feeling I'm possessing for Rene  
Moping around and wondering where she stay  
Saw her last that she lay  
Give it another day I say  
But the lord he take'th away  
Now give it back lord  
Cause that's like backboards without the rims  
Me and my auntie was tight like southwest  
Before the pinks moved in  
Like the niggas that owned the liquor store  
Crack cocaine, pimps and whores  
Living up on this earth  
Before a nigga like daddy was born  
But they making a scene  
That my music and crime are a team  
But I'm speaking the truth not dreams  
So what in the fuck they mean  
My lyrics ain't clean  
  
[Chorus]
