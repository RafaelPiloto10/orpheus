Now, there  
There speaks a true friend  
There speaks a friend for life  
  
You told me all the things  
That you think are wrong with me  
I just wish you'd stayed around and helped me put them right  
But nevertheless:  
  
There...mm  
There speaks a true friend  
There speaks a friend for life  
  
You listed all the things  
That people cannot stand about me  
I just wish you'd stayed around and helped me to improve  
Because I've tried, I've tried  
Oh, I've really really tried  
  
You say I don't know how to live  
(And that's true)  
You say I don't deserve to live  
Oh, where would I be without my friends to help me?  
I just can't imagine where I'd be, can you?  
No
