If a plane crashed into my room  
I wouldn't even flinch  
I couldn't try to move  
My mind is on you  
My mind is on you  
  
If the streetlight smashed above me  
I wouldn't move an inch  
Turn the glass into stars  
And your face is the moon  
And the night turns to you  
Cos my mind is on you  
  
You've got me caught in a place  
Panic for a minute  
Got my brain in a daze  
I wish you weren't in it  
There are so many ways  
To lose your attention  
You can break everything  
But so I can take anything  
  
I can take anything  
I can take anything  
  
If electric charges shock me  
I smile and fold my arms  
I feel nothing new  
Because my mind is on you  
  
My mind is on you  
  
And if the floor gives way to my shoes  
I wouldn't try to fly  
I cant explain why I feel  
I always feel you  
  
I always feel, always feel you  
  
You've got my caught in a place  
Panic for a minute  
Got my brain in a daze  
I wish you weren't in it  
There are so many ways  
To lose your attention  
You can break everything  
But so I can take anything  
  
Your the heat in my bones  
But you break me with stones  
  
You're the heat in my bones  
But you break me with your stones  
  
If a plane crashed into my room  
I wouldn't even flinch  
I couldnt try to move  
My mind is always on you  
My mind is always on you  
  
Caught in a place  
Panic for a minute  
Got my brain in a daze  
I wish you weren't in it  
There are so many ways  
To lose your attention  
You can break everything  
But so  
  
Even when I'm caught in a place  
Panic for a minute  
Got my brain in a daze  
I wish you weren't in it  
There are so many ways  
To lose your attention  
You can break everything  
But so I can take anything
