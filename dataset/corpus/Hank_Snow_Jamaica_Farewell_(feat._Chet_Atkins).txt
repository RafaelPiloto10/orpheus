Down the way where the nights are gay and the sun shines daily on the mountain
top  
  
I took a trip on a sailing ship and when I reached Jamaica I made a stop  
  
But I'm sad to say I'm on my way won't be back for many a day  
  
My heart is down my head is turnin' around I had to leave a little girl in
Kingston town  
  
[ ac. Guitar ]  
  
Sounds of laughter everywhere and the dancing girls swayin' to and fro  
  
I must declare my heart is there although I've been from Maine to Mexico  
  
But I'm sad to say...

Down at the market you can hear ladies cry out while on their heads they bear  
  
Ackey rice salt fish are nice and the sun is fine anytime of the year  
  
But I'm sad to say...
