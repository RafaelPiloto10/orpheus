[Intro]  
We're so late nights  
Red eyes, amnesia, on ice  
Late nights, red eyes  
Amnesia, I need ya  
  
[Verse 1]  
Right now I can't see straight  
Intoxicated it's true when I'm with you  
I'm buzzing and I feel laced  
I'm coming from a different phase when I'm with you  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Another way now, like we're supposed to do  
Take you to the back now, I'd take a shot for you  
Wasted every night, gone for every song  
Faded every night, dancing all night long  
  
[Chorus]  
Drunk all Summer, drunk all Summer  
We've been drunk all Summer  
Drinking and flowing and rolling  
We're falling down  
  
[Refrain]  
We're so late nights  
Red eyes, amnesia, I need ya  
  
[Verse 2]  
Right now I'm emotional  
I lose control, when I'm with you  
I hope I haven't said too much  
Guess I always push my luck when I'm with you  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Another way now, like we're supposed to do  
Take you to the back now, I'd take a shot for you  
Wasted every night, gone for every song  
Faded every night, dancing all night long  
  
[Chorus]  
Drunk all Summer, drunk all Summer  
We've been drunk all Summer  
Drinking and flowing and rolling  
We're falling down  
  
[Refrain]  
We're so late nights  
Red eyes, amnesia, on ice  
Late nights, red eyes  
Amnesia, I need ya  
  
[Outro]  
Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk  
Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk  
(You put your drinks up)  
Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk  
Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk  
Drunk all Summer  
Drunk all Summer
