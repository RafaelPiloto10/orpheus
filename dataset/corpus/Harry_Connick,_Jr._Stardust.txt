And now the purple dusk of twilight time  
  
Steals across the meadow of my heart  
  
High up in the sky the little stars climb  
  
Always reminding me that we're apart  
  
You wander down the lane and far away  
  
Leaving me a song that will not die  
  
Love is now a stardust of yesterday  
  
The music of the years gone by  
  
Sometimes I wonder why I spend  
  
The lonely nights dreaming of a song  
  
The melody haunts my reverie  
  
And I am once again with you  
  
When our love was new  
  
And each kiss an inspiration  
  
But that was long ago  
  
Now my consolation  
  
Is in the stardust of a song  
  
Beside the garden wall  
  
When stars are bright  
  
You are in my arms  
  
The nightingale tells his fairy tale  
  
Of paradise where roses bloom  
  
Though I dream in vain  
  
In my heart it will remain  
  
My stardust melody  
  
The memory of love's refrain
