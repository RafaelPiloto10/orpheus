In the fire, the king will come.  
Thunder rolls, piper and drum.  
Evil sons, overrun,  
Count their sins - judgment comes.  
  
The checkerboard of nights and days -  
Man will die, man be saved.  
The sky will fall, the earth will pray,  
When judgment comes to claim its day.  
  
See the word of the prophet  
On a stone in his hand.  
Poison pen revelation,  
Or just a sign in the sand?
