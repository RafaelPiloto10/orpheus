I've always said "I do" too easy,  
And now I'm payin' the price.  
A weakness for beautiful women  
Is my most expensive vice.  
I still believe in matrimony,  
But I can't afford another try.  
Child support and alimony  
Is just about to bleed me dry.  
  
I've got ex's all across the country  
And I owe everybody in town.  
I've got bill collectors callin' me up  
And lawyers tryin' to track me down.  
I'm just one wrong move from the poor house,  
But I don't belong in there.  
I've got so many ex's and owe so much,  
I ought to be on Hollywood Squares,  
Yeah I ought to be on Hollywood Squares.  
  
Lookin' back over my love life,  
I only have myself to blame.  
I guess I should've checked the price tag  
Before I gave 'em my last name.  
Now my credit ratin's in the gutter,  
And the bottom line sure looks bad.  
I'll be payin' the rest of my life  
For the few good times I've had.  
  
I've got ex's all across the country  
And I owe everybody in town.  
I've got bill collectors callin' me up  
And lawyers tryin' to track me down.  
I'm just one wrong move from the poor house,  
But I don't belong in there.  
I've got so many ex's and owe so much,  
I ought to be on Hollywood Squares,  
Yeah they ought to put me on Hollywood Squares.
