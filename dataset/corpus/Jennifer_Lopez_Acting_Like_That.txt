I've been down since day 1 yeah  
I'm the only one that been right here  
Why you acting like you don't care?  
I've been down since day 1  
Don't let the tables turn  
Don't let the bridges burn  
Been down for you  
Don't get it confused, boy  
You could lose your turn  
Don't let the tables turn  
Don't let the bridges burn  
Cause everything could change  
In a matter of days  
Depending if you've learned  
Why you acting like that?  
You gon' miss me when I'm gone  
Why you acting like that?  
(Why you acting like that?)  
Why you acting like that?  
You gon' miss me when I'm gone  
Why you acting like that?  
When I leave I'm taking all  
  
Baddest bitch in the world right here  
You ain't even gotta go nowhere  
Boy you better watch the way you walk  
Cause if you trip, you're gonna fall, oh  
Don't let the tables turn  
Don't let the bridges burn  
Been down for you  
Don't get it confused, boy  
You could lose your turn  
Don't let the tables turn  
Don't let the bridges burn  
Cause everything could change  
In a matter of days  
Depending if you've learned  
Why you acting like that?  
You gon' miss me when I'm gone  
Why you acting like that?  
(Why you acting like that?)  
Why you acting like that?  
You gon' miss me when I'm gone  
Why you acting like that?  
When I leave I'm taking all
