Had another birthday, could've been the worst day  
I ever had  
Got a little drunk, and I fell into a funk  
And I woke up sad  
Looked into the mirror  
There were lines around my eyes  
  
Time flies when you're having fun  
Time flies when you live on the run  
The harder I go, the more I realize  
Time flies  
  
Life is moving fast and I'm running out of gas  
Time ain't on my side  
I'm still in the race and I'm barely keeping pace  
But it's worth the ride  
Waiting round the corner  
There's another sweet surprise  
  
Time flies when you're having fun  
Time flies when you live on the run  
The harder I go, the more I realize  
Time flies  
  
Hey yeah, hey yeah  
Time flies  
Hey yeah, hey yeah  
Time flies  
  
Some sad day, they'll be taking me away  
But I won't be dead  
'Cause even when I'm gone  
This stupid dance song will be in your head  
I'll be looking down with a twinkle in my eyes  
  
Time flies when you're having fun  
Time flies when you live on the run  
The harder I go, the more I realize  
Time flies when you're having fun  
Time flies when you live on the run  
The harder I go, the more I realize  
Time flies
