Last night all alone in a barroom  
Met a girl with a drink in her hand.  
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair  
And eyes that would tempt any man.  
Then she came and sat down at my table,  
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,  
I found myself wanting to kiss her  
For temptation was flowing like wine.  
  
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.  
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.  
Then we danced and she whispered, "I need you!"  
"Take me away from here and be my man."  
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:  
  
The reflection of my wedding band.  
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.  
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.  
  
Last night all alone in a barroom  
Met a guy with a drink in his hand.  
He had bay blue eyes, coal black hair  
And a smile that a girl understands.  
Then he came and sat down at my table,  
And as he placed his hands over mine,  
I found my self wanting to kiss him  
For temptation was flowing like wine.  
  
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.  
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.  
Then we danced and he whispered, "I need you!"  
"Let me take you away and be your man."  
Then I looked into his eyes and I saw it:  
  
The reflection of my wedding band.  
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.  
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.
