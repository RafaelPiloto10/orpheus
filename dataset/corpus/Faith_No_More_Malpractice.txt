The crowd roars  
It's deep and so unhealthy  
The rest you know  
I'll feel the hands that felt me  
  
Cold hands  
Your hands  
Cover my mouth  
While I'm staring into bright lights  
  
Applause  
The crowd roars  
The rest you know  
Ten lovers violating  
  
Cured  
Discharged  
Reach back inside  
Knuckle white  
  
Ruffle white  
The crowd roars  
They ruined and repaired me  
The rest you know  
  
The hands removed the bad thing  
Miracle
