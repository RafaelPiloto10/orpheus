She said trust me and I did, love me I did  
She said hold me as tight as you can  
She said I live just for you, won't you live for me too  
She said I could never love another man.  
  
Oh, those famous last words  
Oh, how they hurt me  
They go down in my memory  
As the saddest I've heard  
Oh, those heart breakin' words  
She whispered so sweetly  
Like I love you, believe me  
Famous last words.  
  
When I come back she asks, it won't be like the past  
She said forgive me for I still love you so  
But I still hear in my mind it's forever this time  
As I stand now watching her go.  
  
Oh, those famous last words  
Oh, how they hurt me  
They go down in my memory  
As the saddest I've heard  
Oh, those heart breakin' words  
She whispered so sweetly  
Like I love you, believe me  
Famous last words
