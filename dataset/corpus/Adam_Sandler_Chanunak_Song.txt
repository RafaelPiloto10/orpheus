"Okay...  
This is a song that uhh..  
There's a lot of Christmas songs out there and uhh..  
Not too many Chanukah songs.  
So uhh..  
I wrote a song for all those nice little Jewish kids who don't get to  
Hear any Chanukah songs.  
Here we go..."  
  
Put on your yarmulke  
Here comes Chanukah  
So much funukah  
To celebrate Chanukah  
Chanukah is the festival of lights  
Instead of one day of presents, we have eight crazy nights  
  
When you feel like the only kid in town without a Christmas tree  
Here's a list of people who are Jewish just like you and me  
David Lee Roth lights the menorah  
So do James Caan, Kirk Douglas, and the late Dinah Shore-ah  
  
Guess who eats together at the Carnegie Deli  
Bowser from Sha Na Na and Arthur Fonzerelli  
Paul Newman's half Jewish, Goldie Hawn's half too  
Put them together, what a fine lookin' Jew  
  
You don't need "Deck The Halls" or "Jingle Bell Rock"  
'Cause you can spin a dreidel with Captain Kirk and Mr.Spock- both  
Jewish  
  
Put on your yarmulke  
It's time for Chanukah  
The owner of the Seattle Supersonicahs  
Celebrates Chanukah  
  
O.J. Simpson, not a Jew  
But guess who is? Hall of famer Rod Carew- he converted  
We got Ann Landers and her sister Dear Abby  
Harrison Ford's a quarter Jewish- not too shabby  
  
Some people think that Ebenezer  
Scrooge is  
Well he's not, but guess who is  
All three Stooges  
So many Jews are in showbiz  
Tom Cruise isn't, but I heard his agent is  
  
Tell your friend Veronica  
It's time to celebrate Chanukah  
I hope I get a harmonicah  
Oh this lovely, lovely Chanukah  
So drink your gin and tonicah  
And smoke your marijuanikah  
If you really, really wannakah  
Have a happy, happy, happy,  
Happy Chanukah  
  
Happy Chanukah
