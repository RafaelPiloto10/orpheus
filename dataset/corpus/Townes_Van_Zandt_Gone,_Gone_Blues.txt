Well, little darling she ain't mean me no harm  
You know, she loved me all night long  
Now she's gone, gone  
  
Well, little darling in a dress so red  
Now she's gone, man  
  
I'm stuck in Chicago, Illinois  
Let me tell you, boys  
She's gone, gone  
  
I do believe she gone a Mobil deal  
I do believe she made a fool of me  
She's gone now  
  
Little darling, won't you stay friend  
I want to do them things again  
Ah, gone, gone  
  
You know, she loved me all night long  
You know, she didn't mean me no wrong  
Now she's gone, gone
