I introduce you to the life  
You need the life, the life needs you  
Everything is nice  
  
Let me welcome you to my world  
Everything's in living color plus the fly girls  
On the way and gotta watch them with a keen eye  
Niggas ain't seen fly till they seen I  
Maybach cause I'm not a limousine guy  
Suit with the bow tie no bean pies  
The Laperle match well with these Feragamis  
Killer shoe game these are just a pair of hamies  
Mommy I get up like QB's  
Na, she ain't stepped in blood, those are Lou B's  
We don't follow, unless you lead us into VIP  
When they know your face, they don't need to see ID  
I can see the bottles coming from a mile away  
Sparklers on the top act like they don't know to stop (stop, stop)  
She fuck with niggas like Fabolous  
Cause to tell the truth, baby life's fabolous  
  
It's the fabulous life, oh I be living that  
Oh I be living that, oh I be living that  
Get your money right, you could be living that  
You could be living that, you could be living that  
It's a fabulous life, oh I be living that  
Oh I be living that, oh I be living that  
How you living, what? How you living, what?  
How you living, oh I be living fabulous  
  
I bow my head and I praise that  
We be there and back before the Rose's flat  
Picture me anywhere a clown stays at  
I don't think so, homey don't play that  
Everything is BOSS, like a Rick ad-lib  
Take it to house like it's Trick Dad Crib  
We hit Miami like a hurricane  
Shorty poolside, one piece Veroaine  
She the baddest bitch in them Jackie O shades  
Flabby beach mat, she don't give me no shade  
Hold the heat down, she don't even know Wade  
Nigga get smoked like cigarette tote  
I like her soft kiss and I dig her wet throat  
I love her booty bounce like cigarette boats  
And it won't quit  
She can't wear skinny jeans cause her ass don't fit  
Real shit  
  
It's the fabulous life, oh I be living that  
Oh I be living that, oh I be living that  
Get your money right, you can be living that  
You can be living that, you can be living that  
It's a fabulous life, oh I be living that  
Oh I be living that, oh I be living that  
How you living, what? How you living, what?  
How you living, oh I be living fabulous  
  
Got a rich bitch on the way  
That for real though, just like Wanda say  
She just wanna rock my world in the Wonder way  
I'm sitting at the airport like Andele  
Fist I saw the Luggy with the Louie monogram  
Then I saw my baby like a sonogram  
On the runway, just me and Bentley  
I open doors, you ain't gotta G the gent me  
I was thinking Knicks game, court side  
She put her hands in my pants, I let that thought slide  
We can get it on, but there's no leg room  
No water bed, just a boat with a bedroom  
Now you tell me who can top this  
Hey, laying on the deck topless  
Got two different dames, it's a Fabolous thing  
One white, one yellow, like Fabolous chain  
  
It's the fabulous life, oh I be living that  
Oh I be living that, oh I be living that  
Get your money right, you could be living that  
You could be living that, you could be living that  
It's a fabulous life, oh I be living that  
Oh I be living that, oh I be living that  
How you living, what? How you living, what?  
How you living, oh I be living Fabolous
