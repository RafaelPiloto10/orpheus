Working hard eight days a week  
Most days we've got no time to speak  
Feels like I'm chasing after my own life  
Girl can't you see you're my only vice  
  
Take the phone off the hook  
Turn the lights down low  
We'll play some old Sam Cooke  
Baby, let yourself go  
  
All I wanna do is you  
All I wanna do is you  
I'll do anything you want me to but  
All I wanna do is you  
  
I don't care what kinda clothes you wear  
It doesn't matter how you do your hair  
I don't need no champagne on ice  
Girl, can't you see that you're my only vice  
  
Turn the whole world off  
Keep your high heels on  
Take it nice and slow  
And make it last 'til dawn  
  
All I wanna do is you  
All I wanna do is you  
I'll do anything you want me to but  
All I wanna do is you  
  
I don't wanna eat, I don't wanna sleep  
Don't wanna sit around and watch TV  
When you're next to me it's where I wanna be  
All I wanna, all I wanna, all I, I wanna do  
  
All I wanna do is you  
All I wanna do is you  
I'll do anything you want me to, but  
All I wanna do is you  
  
All I wanna, all I wanna, all I wanna do  
All I wanna do now, all I wanna do is you  
Baby is you
