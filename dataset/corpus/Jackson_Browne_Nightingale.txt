I'm hanging on to my peace of mind  
I just don't know  
I'm hanging on to those good times, baby  
Just want to let them roll  
I'm gonna make it to the light and joy  
I'll tell you why  
I got a woman who can take me there  
The apple of my eye  
Oh, I just don't know, no no, no, no  
I love her so  
Don't let me see that morning paper  
Cause I don't need those dues  
It's just the same old murder movie  
But they call it the news  
I'll tell you what would be some story  
And what would set me free  
Is if the same thing happened to everybody  
That just happened to me, oh,  
I just don't know, no, no, no, no  
I'll never let her go  
Every time I hear somebody sneakin'  
Up behind whoa, I turn around  
But I still hear that sound  
And just when I'm about to lose my mind  
Here comes my baby  
Singing like a nightingale  
Coming my way down along that devastation  
Trail well tell the Lord above  
She's got a brand of love  
That cannot fail  
I'm hanging on to my peace of mind  
That's no lie  
I'm hanging on to my special friend  
The apple of my eye  
My inspiration, too  
She's got a lead on my heart and  
My soul and she knows just what to do  
Oh, I just don't know, no, no, no, no  
No, I get so low, and my mind's about to go  
But wait a minute, here comes my baby  
Singing like a nightingale  
Coming my way down along that devastation trail  
Well, let the fires burn, let the  
Floods return  
We will prevail  
Hanging on to my peace of mind  
I just don't know
