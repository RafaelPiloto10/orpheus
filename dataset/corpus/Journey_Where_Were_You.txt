Where were you  
When I wanted you to love me through the night?  
Where were you  
When I wanted you to love and hold me tight?  
Where were you, little darlin'  
When you said to pick you up after school?  
I know where, little lady,  
'Cause my mama didn't raise no fool.  
  
Yeah.  
Where were you?  
Where were you?  
Where were you?  
Where were you?  
  
I know where, baby,  
you been runnin' 'round loose on the side.  
I know where, little lady,  
you been runnin' 'round with something to hide.  
I don't mind, darlin', if you're feelin' fancy and free.  
I don't mind, little baby,  
'Cause your sister's lookin' real good to me.  
  
Hey,  
Where were you?  
Where were you?  
Where were you?  
Where were you?  
  
I didn't know what the hell was goin' on,  
Someday you're gonna break.  
So don't try to get yourself straight,  
You're just a little too late.  
  
Where were you?  
Where were you?  
Where were you?  
Where were you?  
  
Where were you?  
Where were you?  
Where were you?  
Where were you?
