Dark and grey, an English film, the Wednesday play  
We always watch the Queen on Christmas Day  
Won't you stay?  
  
Though your eyes see shipwrecked sailors you're still dry  
The outlook's fine though Wales might have some rain  
Saved again.  
  
Let's skip the news boy (I'll go and make some tea)  
Arabs and Jews boy (too much for me)  
They get me confused boy (puts me off to sleep)  
And the thing I hate, oh Lord!  
Is staying up late, to watch some debate, on some nation's fate.  
  
Hypnotized by Batman, Tarzan, still surprised!  
You've won the West in time to be our guest  
Name your prize!  
  
Drop of wine, a glass of beer dear what's the time?  
The grime on the Tyne is mine all mine all mine  
Five past nine.  
  
Blood on the rooftops, Venice in the spring  
The Streets of San Francisco, a word from Peking  
The trouble was started, by a young Errol Flynn  
Better in my day, oh Lord!  
For when we got bored, we'd have a world war, happy but poor  
So let's skip the news boy (I'll go and make some tea)  
Blood on the rooftops (too much for me)  
When old Mother Goose stops, and they're out for twenty three  
Then the rain at Lords stopped play  
Seems Helen of Troy has found a new face again.
