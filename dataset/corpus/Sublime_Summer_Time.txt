Summertime and the livin's easy  
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras-MG  
All the people in the dance will agree that  
We're well qualified to  
Represent  
The LBC  
  
Me and Louie we're gonna run to the party and dance till the rhythm it  
Gets  
Harder  
  
Ba da ba bye bye  
Ba da ba bye bye  
  
Me and my girl we got this relationship  
I love her so bad, but she treats me like shh  
All locked down like a penitentiary  
She spreads her lovin' all over  
And when she gets home  
There's none left for me

So take this veil from off my eyes  
My burning sun will some day rise  
And what am I gonna be doin for a wife  
I said I'm gonna play with myself  
Show them now we've come off the self
