I'm sick to death  
I'm a nervous wreck  
This business is killing me  
You know  
This business is killing me  
You know  
It's really killing me  
Yeah  
  
Oh no oh no oh no  
Oh no oh-no oh no  
Oh no oh-no oh no  
On no ho  
  
This business is killing me  
And so they say  
  
Run around, run around  
Love giving you  
The run around  
It really makes you crazy  
Run around, run around  
Love giving you  
The run around  
  
Oh no oh no oh no  
Oh no oh no oh no  
Oh no oh no oh no  
On no ho  
  
This business is killing me  
And so they say  
Hey, hey  
You work, you work  
You write all night  
Until the early morning light  
  
Can't please all the people  
All the time  
All the people  
All the time  
But then they don't  
Please me  
  
Well I can't take it no more  
No, I can't take it no more  
  
Run around, run around  
Well I can't take it no more  
No, I can't take it
