I like to sit beside the fire  
When the light is going down  
I like to hear the wild wind blow outside my door  
I have so much left to remember  
I have so much left to forget  
And I know I just don't have to search for more  
But you want to change my world  
  
Stay out of my life  
Storm wind, you're just like a wind  
Comin' to drag me away  
Storm wind, what can I say  
I just don't want you to stay  
I like to walk around in dreams at night  
And play with kings and queens 'til the morning light  
I like to wake up in the morning unaware  
Of the fact that you are calling me  
To ask me if I want to be  
Someone who you could love and always care for
