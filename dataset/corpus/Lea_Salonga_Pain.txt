The thoughts I have of you I treasure  
The good times and the bad  
We'll share forever more  
Somehow, you've changed  
We just didn't make it through  
But I believe that one day  
You'll have to know  
That I'm still in love with you  
  
At times we couldn't understand each other  
And though we tried we couldn't keep from fallin'  
Somehow, somewhere our love had lost its way  
And now I feel it's over, it's hard to say  
But I love you just the same  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, it's been so long  
Since I had you by my side  
I don't even know what to say or do  
I tried so hard to get you off my mind  
But I love you still try to understand  
When I'm all alone  
I still can feel the pain you've left behind  
  
The thoughts I have of you I treasure  
The good times and the bad  
We'll share forever more  
Somehow, you've changed  
We just didn't make it through  
But I believe that one day  
You'll have to know  
That I'm still in love with you  
  
At times we couldn't understand each other  
And though we tried we couldn't keep from fallin'  
Somehow, somewhere our love had lost its way  
And now I feel it's over, it's hard to say  
But I love you just the same  
  
Oh, it's been so long  
Since I had you by my side  
I don't even know what to say or do  
I tried so hard to get you off my mind  
But I love you please try to understand  
When I'm all alone  
I still can feel the pain you've left behind  
  
The thoughts I have of you I'll always treasure  
The good times and the bad  
We'll share forever more  
Somehow, somewhere our love will find a way  
And I believe that one day  
I'll hear you'll say that you love me all the way  
  
All the way, oh  
Love me all the way  
Love me, love me all the way  
Love me all the way, baby  
Pap-pap-pap-para-rap-pap-pap  
  
Love me, love me all the way  
Love me, hear you say you love me  
  
All the way  
All the way  
  
I believe that one day  
I will hear you say  
You love me all the way
