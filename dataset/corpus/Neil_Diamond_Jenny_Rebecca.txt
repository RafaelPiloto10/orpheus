Jenny Rebecca, four days old  
How do you like the world so far  
Jenny Rebecca, four days old  
What a lucky, lucky, lucky  
Lucky girl you are  
For you have swings to be swung on  
Trees to be climbed up  
Days to be young on  
Toys you can wind up  
Grass to be lying on  
Sun up above  
Pillows for crying on  
When you're in love  
Ponies for riding on  
Wind in your hair  
Slides to be sliding on  
Leaves in the air  
Dolls to be caring for  
Love to be giving  
Dreams to be daring for  
Long as you're living  
Yes, you have dreams to be daring for  
Long as you're living
