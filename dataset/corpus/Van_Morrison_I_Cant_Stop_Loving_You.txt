I can't stop loving you  
Since I made up my mind  
To live in memories  
Of a lonesome time  
  
I can't stop wanting you  
It's useless to say  
So I just live my life  
In dreams of yesterday  
  
Those happy hours  
Oh, those happy hours  
That we once knew  
Oh, that we once knew  
So long ago  
So long ago, baby  
Still make me blue  
Yeah, still make me blue  
They say the time  
They say that time  
Heals a broken heart  
Heal a broken heart  
But time has stood still  
But time has stood still  
Since we've been apart  
Oh, since we've been apart  
  
I can't stop loving  
Since I made up my mind  
Living in, live, live, live, live, live, live in memories  
Of a lone, lonesome time  
  
I can't stop wanting you  
It's useless to say  
So I just live my life  
In dreams of yesterday  
  
I can't stop loving you  
Since I made up my mind  
Oh, to live in memory, baby  
Of a lonesome time  
  
I can't stop wanting you  
It's useless to say  
So I just live my life  
In dreams of yesterday  
Of yesterday.
