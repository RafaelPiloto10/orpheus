There's a light shining on her window  
There's a great big guess breathing on her door  
Shame it's taken all this time  
All these years to find out  
She's gonna change everything  
  
I spend so much time sitting in shadows  
I feel naked to the bone but I don't care, any more  
Shame it's taken all this time  
All these years to find out  
She's gonna change everything  
  
Oh everybody can't you see  
What that angel's done to me  
I'm hopelessly in bits  
Hanging on to what I think I used to be  
Somebody help me please  
See this fool way down on his knees  
She's gonna change everything you see in me  
She's gonna change everything
