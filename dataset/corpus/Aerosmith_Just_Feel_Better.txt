She said i feel stranded  
And i can't tell anymore  
If i'm coming or i'm going  
It's not how i planned it  
I got a key to the door  
But it just won't open  
  
I know i know i know  
Part of me says let it go  
That life happens for a reason  
I don't i don't i don't  
Becuase it never worked before  
But this time  
This time  
I'm gonna try anything to just feel better  
  
Tell me what to do  
You know i can't see through the haze around me  
And i'd do anything to just feel better  
I can't find my way  
God i need a change  
And i'd do anything to just feel better  
Any little thing to just feel better  
  
She said i need you to hold me  
I'm a little far from the shore  
And i'm afraid of sinking  
You're the only one who knows me  
And who doesn't ignore that my soul i weeping  
  
I know i know i know  
Part of me says let it go  
Everything must have it's season  
'round and 'round it goes  
Every day's the one before  
But this time  
This time  
I'm gonna try anything to just feel better  
  
  
Tell me what to do  
You know i can't see through the haze around me  
And i'd do anything to just feel better  
I can't find my way  
God i need a change  
And i'd do anything to just feel better  
Any little thing to just feel better  
  
I'm tired of holding on  
To all the things i leave behind  
It's really getting old yea  
I think i need a little help this time  
  
I'm gonna try anything to just feel better  
  
Tell me what to do  
You know i can't see through the haze around me  
And i'd do anything to just feel better  
I can't find my way  
God i need a change  
And i'd do anything to just feel better  
Any little thing to just feel better
