I'm a rambler I'm a gambler  
I'm a long way from my home  
If you people don't like me  
I can make out on my own  
  
'Casue it's dark  
And it's rainin'  
And the Moon gives no light  
And my pony can hardly travel  
On this darkened road at night  
  
You know once I had a true love  
Though her age was just sixteen  
She was the flower of Belton  
And the rose of Aberdine  
  
But her parents did not like me  
And now she feels much the same  
If I'm writ on in your Diary  
Well blot out my name  
  
'Cause there's changes in the ocean  
And there's changes in the sea  
And there's changes in my own true love  
But there aint to changin' me
