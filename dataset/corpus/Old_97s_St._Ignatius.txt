Outside St. Ignatius, outside of the law  
You walk by so gracefully, I just stand in awe  
You're a goddess, you're the hottest oddity I've found  
We can go swimmin' in our skin and hope that we don't drown  
I could save the water just by drinking it tonight  
I can't find the words to make it right, to make it right  
I can't find the words to make it right, to make it right  
Tanked up out on Elm Street, looking for a ride  
Stretched out on concrete, running out of pride  
You need help dear, and I'm sincere, let me be the one  
I'm not a big star but I've got a big car, you're too weak to run  
You could save the highway if you'd crash with me tonight  
I can't find the words to make it right, to make it right  
I can't find the words to make it right, to make it right  
I could save the water just by drinking it tonight  
I can't find the words to make it right, to make it right  
I can't find the words to make it right, to make it right  
Someday when we're older, deep in loneliness  
Things we said today won't matter, no one could care less  
We're just shadows, just ask Plato, it was all a dream  
I've had it with Dallas, let's burn down the Palace, I'll bring the kerosene  
I could save this song if I'd just sing real loud tonight  
I can't find the words to make it right, to make it right  
I can't find the words to make it right, to make it right  
I can't find the words to make it right, to make it right
