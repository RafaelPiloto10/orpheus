I got a brand new baby and I feel so good  
She loves even better than I thought she would  
I'm on my way to her house and I'm plumb outta breath  
And when I see her tonight I'm gonna squeeze her to death  
Claudette, pretty little pet, Claudette  
Never make me fret Claudette  
She's the greatest little girl that I've ever met  
I get the best lovin' that I'll ever get from Claudette  
Oh oh, Claudette  
Well, I'm a lucky man my baby treats me right  
She's gonna let me hug and kiss an hold her tight  
And when the date is over and were at her front door  
When I kiss her good night, I'll holler more, more, more  
Claudette, pretty little pet, Claudette  
Never make me fret Claudette  
She's the greatest little girl that I've ever met  
I get the best lovin' that I'll ever get from Claudette  
Oh oh, Claudette, oh oh, Claudette  
When me an my new baby have a date or three  
I'm gonna ask my baby if she'll marry me  
I'm gonna be so happy for the rest of my life  
When my brand new baby is my brand new wife  
Claudette, pretty little pet, Claudette  
Never make me fret Claudette  
She's the greatest little girl that I've ever met  
I get the best lovin' that I'll ever get from Claudette  
Oh oh, Claudette, oh oh Claudette  
She's the greatest little girl that I've ever met  
I get the best lovin' that I'll ever get from Claudette  
Oh oh, Claudette, oh oh, Claudette
