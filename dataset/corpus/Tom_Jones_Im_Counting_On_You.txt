The night is so wild  
And downstairs the child is sleeping, her spirit is free  
For more than an hour I have walked in the rain  
I've been wondering what she will be  
But where are the heroes, where are the dreams that I had  
When I was young?  
Am I hoping in vain, just to think she could change anything?  
Well, I'm counting on you  
I'm counting on you  
To bring that sweet gentleness to your world and all that you do  
My generation is losing its way, we don't know what we're leaving for you  
So may there be millions who feel like you do, oh my love  
There is so much to know, there is so far to go  
But you are not alone  
When this is your world and I'm counting on you  
I'm counting on you  
Come to me, turn to me, give me your eyes  
When you see the mysteries of time  
Here there are those who just live in the past  
They will never let history lie  
And this sad little island is breaking my heart with its dark  
Shades of green  
And as hard as I try I just cannot see why this should be  
There is so much to know, there is so far to go  
But you are not alone  
When this is your world and I'm counting on you  
So may there be millions who feel like you do, oh my love  
There is so much to know, there is so far to go  
But you are not alone  
When this is your world  
There is so much to know, there is so far to go  
But you are not alone  
When this is your world and I'm counting on you  
Yes, I'm counting on you  
And I'm counting on you  
I'm counting on you  
Yes, I'm counting on you
