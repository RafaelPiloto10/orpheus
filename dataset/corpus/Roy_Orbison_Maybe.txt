Crazy heart your baby's gone, don't you know?.  
Empty arms give up, give up, come on let go.  
And maybe I will be alright.  
And maybe I'll get through tonight.  
Then maybe I will see you tomorrow.  
  
Misty eyes don't see that face in every tear.  
Longing lips don't speak that name, there's no one here.  
And maybe I will see the dawn.  
And maybe I'll get by alone.  
Then maybe I will lose my sorrow.  
  
In a hundred years trough a million tears,  
Maybe,maybe.  
Maybe I'll be loving you.  
And maybe when my life is through  
Then maybe I'll get over you.  
Maybe,maybe,maybe.
