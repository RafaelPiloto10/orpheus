You can't stop a man from learning  
I could write the book of love  
Captured moments there  
Between me and you  
Then I had the thought of leavin'  
It was a voice inside my head  
Telling me I got to have the strength  
To see it through  
And I know it's  
Gonna break your heart  
And I know it's  
Gonna break your heart  
I'm living in a different world  
And as I slip away  
I see you fade to black and white  
I'm living in a different world  
With all my hopes and dreams  
I drift off in the night  
I'm alone but I'm not lonely  
I found something that I never had  
Laying back in the easy chair  
Is not the life for me  
You think I'm your one and only  
But you gamble with a restless man  
In the end I've found the way  
That we can both be free  
I'm living in a different world  
And as I slip away  
I see you fade to black and white  
I'm living in a different world  
With all my hopes and dreams  
I disappear into the night  
I'm living in a different world  
And as I slip away  
I see you fade to black and white  
I'm living in a different world  
With all my hopes and dreams  
I'm living in a different world  
And as I slip away  
I'm living in a different world  
With all my hopes and dreams  
I disappear into the night
