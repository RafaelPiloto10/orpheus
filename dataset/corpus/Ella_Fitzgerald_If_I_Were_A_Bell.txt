Ask me how do I feel  
Ask me now that we're cosy and clingin'  
Well, sir, all I can say  
Is if I were a bell, I'd be ringin'  
From the moment we kissed tonight  
That's the way I've just gotta behave  
Boy, if I were a lamp, I'd light  
Or if I were a banner, I'd wave  
  
Ask me how do I feel  
Little me with my quiet upbringing  
Well, sir, all I can say  
Is if I were a gate, I'd be swinging  
And if I were a watch  
I'd start popping my springs  
Or if I were a bell  
I'd go ding dong, ding dong ding  
  
Yes, I knew my morale would crack  
From the wonderful way that you looked  
Boy, if I were a duck, I'd quack  
Or if I were a goose, I'd be cooked  
  
Ask me how do I feel  
Ask me now that we're fondly caressing  
Well, if I were a salad  
I know I'd be splashing my dressing  
Or if I were a season, I'd surely be spring  
Or if I were a gate, I would swing  
Have a fling almost any old thing  
Or if I were a bell  
I'd go ding dong, ding dong  
Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding, ding dong
