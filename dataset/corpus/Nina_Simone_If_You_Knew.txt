If you knew how I missed you  
You would not stay away today  
Don't you know I need you  
Stay here my dear with me  
  
I need you here my darling  
Together for a day a day  
Together never parting  
Just you just me my love  
  
I can't go on without you  
Your love is all I'm living for  
I love all things about you  
Your heart your soul my love  
  
I need you here beside me  
Forever and a day a day  
I know whatever betides me  
I love you I love you I do
