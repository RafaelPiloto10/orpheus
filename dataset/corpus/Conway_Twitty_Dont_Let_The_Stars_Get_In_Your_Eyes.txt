Don't let the stars get in your eyes  
Don't let the moon break your heart  
Love blooms at night, in daylight it dies  
Don't let the stars get in your eyes  
Or keep your heart from me  
For some day I'll return  
And you know you're the only one  
I'll ever love.  
  
Too many miles, too many days  
Too many nights to be alone  
Please keep your heart while we are apart  
Don't linger in the moonlight while I'm gone  
  
Too many miles, too many days  
Too many nights to be alone  
Oh, please keep your heart while we are apart  
Don't stand in the moonlight while I'm gone.  
  
Don't let the stars get in your eyes  
Don't let the moon break your heart  
Love blooms at night, in daylight it dies  
Don't let the stars get in your eyes  
Or keep your heart from me  
For some day I'll return And you know  
You're the only one I'll ever love.  
  
Too many miles, too many days  
Don't let the stars get in your eyes
