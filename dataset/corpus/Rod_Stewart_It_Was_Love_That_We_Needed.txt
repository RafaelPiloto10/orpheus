It was love that we needed (Hmm, hmm)

It was love (it was love)

We needed love, darlin'  
Yeah, yeah-eh (We needed love)  
  
Somewhat impossible  
No idea what was happenin' to me  
All of my life, things were cool 'til now  
Then the feelin', the strangest feelin' came over me  
  
(Ooh, oh, na, na, na, na, na, na, na)  
  
My happiness just came with such surprise  
The water just swelled up in my eyes  
An all I could see was your pretty, pretty face (pretty face)  
Jumpin' up and down  
All around (round) the place  
  
It was love (it was love)  
It was love (that we needed) that we needed  
It was love, it was love, it was love, it was love  
We needed love  
It was love (it was love)  
It was love (that we needed) that we needed, oh, yeah  
Yeah, yeah  
We needed love  
  
Never, never, never did I know till now  
My deep, deep feelings for another  
When just romancin' in the world  
Dancin' with you, girl  
I knew we'd soon discover, soon discover  
  
(Ooh, oh, na, na, na, na, na, na, na)
