Life goes on day after day after day after day.  
Hearts torn in every way,  
So ferry cross the Mersey, 'cause this lands the place I love and here I'll
stay,  
And here I'll stay.  
  
People they rush every where, Each with their own secret care,  
So ferry cross the Mersey, 'cause this lands the place I love and here I'll
stay,  
And here I'll stay  
  
People around every corner, they seem to smile and say, they'll tell you!  
We don't care what you name is boy, We'll never send you away,  
Send you away, Send you away, Send you away  
  
So I'll continue to say here's where I always must stay,  
So ferry cross the Mersey, 'cause this lands the place I love,  
Ferry cross the Mersey, 'cause this lands the place I love and here I'll stay.  
And here I'll Stay, stay, stay,  
  
Ferry cross the Mersey, 'cause this lands the place I love.  
Ferry cross the Mersey, 'cause this lands the place I love.  
Ferry cross the Mersey, 'cause this lands the place I love.
