Carl's got a brand new haircut, must have been the girl's first date  
Baby blue front quarter panel on his old dark green Chevrolet  
Probably never make the pages of People magazine  
But you oughta see them sick kids' faces when he shows up on Christmas Eve  
Dressed like old St. Nick  
That missin' tooth don't matter a bit  
There's a lot like him around in every town  
  
They're just family, friends, and neighbors  
Doing what they've always done  
Lovin' fathers, lovin' daughters, lovin' mothers, lovin' sons  
They gather 'round ole Glory  
'Round the tables and the steeples  
The beautiful people  
The beautiful people  
  
Debbie Jo, down at the diner  
Sunny side up, burned the toast  
Raising up two kids solo  
Can't afford no fitness coach  
She was going to California  
The year her mama got sick  
So she hung around to do what she could  
Had the first one and that was it  
Then her mom passed on  
But she still goes by the old folks home  
Just to sit a while and bring a smile  
  
They're just family, friends, and neighbors  
Doing what they've always done  
Lovin' fathers, lovin' daughters, lovin' mothers, lovin' sons  
They gather 'round ole Glory  
'Round the tables and the steeples  
The beautiful people  
The beautiful people  
  
A wrinkled old man wearing medals  
That he earned on ? Beach  
Saying goodbye to a grandson  
Who was killed outside Tikrit  
They gather 'round ole Glory  
Out behind the steeple  
  
The beautiful people  
The beautiful people  
The beautiful people  
Man, their beautiful people, yea
