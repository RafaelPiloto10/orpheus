What if I were to leave you  
But then you fell back in love with me  
  
How could you ever let me go  
How could you ever ever let me go  
I scream your name across the bar  
I carry pictures of your  
Neil young  
Guitar  
Though I just can't seem to forget you  
Not ever just as long as I left you  
Your my baby, you  
Never made it through to you  
  
If I were the last girl  
And you were the last boy  
Left here on this planet  
If there was an earth quake  
Maybe then you'd love  
Maybe then you'd love me  
Last girl  
And you were the last boy  
Left here on this planet  
If there was an earthquake  
Maybe then you'd love maybe then you'd love me  
If there was an earthquake  
  
How could you ever let me go  
How could you ever ever let me go  
I scream your name across the bar  
I carry pictures of your neil young  
Guitar  
Though I just can't seem to forget you  
Not ever just as long as I left you  
Your my baby, you  
Never made it through to you  
  
If I were the last girl  
And you were the last boy  
Left here on this planet  
If there was an earth quake  
Maybe then you'd love  
Maybe then you'd love me  
Last girl  
And you were the last boy  
Left here on this planet  
If there was an earthquake  
Maybe then you'd love maybe then you'd love me  
If there was an earthquake  
  
What if I were to leave you...  
  
Last girl  
And you were the last boy  
Left here on this planet  
If there was an earthquake  
Maybe then you'd love maybe then you'd love me  
If there was an earthquake
