[Jesse to the Invisible Circus]  
  
Welcome to my world  
To my kingdom of make believe  
I'm your new Messiah  
You'll worship at my feet  
  
Welcome Kingdom Come  
To disciples that I preach  
Will ya, bow down before me and  
Will you remember me?  
  
[Invisible Circus] Dying for you  
[Jesse] Will I lie to thousands  
[Invisible Circus] Our God is you  
[Jesse] Am I deceit?  
[Invisible Circus] Falling for you  
[Jesse] I am the God man  
[Invisible Circus] Our God is you  
[Jesse] You're all at my feet  
  
[Jesse to the Invisible Circus]  
  
Take me  
Change me  
Love me  
A crown of thorns on my heart  
  
Change me  
Save me  
Will you love me?  
Forever nailed to your cross
