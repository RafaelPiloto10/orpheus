Oh, I'll never find  
I'll never find some one like you  
Girl you take my breath away  
And when I'm with someone new  
I'd rather be here with you baby forever  
My heart belongs to you  
'Cause I think about you all the time  
I know my love is true  
When we're together  
I played around girl  
And I made you cry  
When I looked up  
You were saying goodbye  
I'm begging you please  
I need you so bad  
Don't leave me now you're the best that I've had  
Chorus  
I'll never  
I'll never find someone like you  
No I'll never  
That promise is true  
No I'll never  
I'll never find someone like you  
Oh baby  
'Cause I love the way that you are  
And girl I won't no  
I won't let you go  
'Cause no one could ever do  
Love you like I love you  
All I have is just my heart  
And my feelings I give to you  
That's all that I can do, girl  
Baby forever  
Oh, you don't know that you're hurting me  
'Cause it's not just a sexual thing  
I wanna share my dreams  
Baby together, oh  
Girl I'm afraid just to give you that but  
My heart's telling me to hold on to my love  
But when you get close  
I want you to know  
I start to get weak  
And I can't let you go  
Chorus  
Just your smile  
That's all I need  
Tenderness  
Girl I won't let you down  
Girl I will never find no one that compares to you  
Chorus  
'Cause no one could ever do  
And I promise to honour you  
Chorus  
I'll never find someone like you
