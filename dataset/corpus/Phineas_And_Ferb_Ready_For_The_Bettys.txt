You gotta bang your Betty bongos  
And bring your Betty bass guitar yeah yeah  
And with the Betty backbeat  
You'll go Betty, Betty far  
  
So drop your boring baggage  
And come with Missy, Tink, and Crash  
There's a Betty (There's a Betty) bandwagon  
Going to a Betty bash (Going to a Betty bash)!  
  
Get ready for the Bettys, ready for the Bettys  
Get ready for the Bettys, ready for the Bettys  
(Ready for the Bettys)  
Get ready for the Bettys, ready for the Bettys  
It's the best thing you can do!  
Get ready for the Bettys 'cause the Bettys are ready for you!
