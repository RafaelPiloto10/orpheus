I leave the gas on  
Walk the allies in the dark  
Sleep with candles burning  
I leave the door unlocked  
I'm weaving a rope and  
Running all the red lights  
Did I get your attention  
'Cause I'm sending all the signs and  
The clock is ticking  
And I'll be giving my two weeks  
  
Pick your favorite shade of black  
You'd best prepare a speech  
Say something funny  
Say something sweet  
But don't say that you loved me  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause I'm still breathing  
But we've been dead for awhile  
This sickness has no cure  
We're goin' down for sure  
Already lost a grip  
Best abandon ship  
  
Maybe I was too pale  
Maybe I was too fat  
Maybe you wanted better, better luck in the sack  
No formal education  
I swear way too much  
I swear you didn't care  
'Cause we were in love  
  
So as I write this letter and shed my last tear  
No, it's all for the better  
That we end this here  
Let's close this chapter  
Say one last prayer  
But don't say that you loved me  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I'm still breathing  
I'm still breathing
