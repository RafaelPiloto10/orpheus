Here on the edge of the moon  
Running from our future  
As I look back  
Your heart grabs my hand  
Asking me  
To remember a vow you made  
That would always take  
Me to the edge of the moon  
Circling pictures of you  
  
The time you sailed on  
Under the diamond eye  
Or for a dolphin who for a song had  
Crossed night  
To bring back your bride  
  
Under a warm Tuscan sun  
No cliff was too steep for us  
Here at the edge of the moon  
I surf a curve thrown by you  
  
And did you teach me to fly  
Past your marmalade sky  
So that after the waning and waxing of love  
You could find  
Me at the edge  
Here at the edge  
Me at the edge of  
The edge of the moon  
  
Now I'm going back  
Past that marmalade sky  
'Cause you've got my waxing and waning  
As primitive goes  
You can stir the embers of the Lucy  
Inside of my soul  
  
Now I'm going back  
Past that marmalade sky  
'Cause you've got my waxing and waning  
As primitive goes  
You can stir the embers of the Lucy  
Inside of my soul  
  
Now I'm going back  
Past that marmalade sky  
'Cause you've got my waxing and waning  
As primitive goes  
You can stir the embers of the Lucy inside  
The Lucy inside  
Stir the Lucy inside of my soul  
  
Here at the edge  
Me at the edge of  
The edge of the moon
