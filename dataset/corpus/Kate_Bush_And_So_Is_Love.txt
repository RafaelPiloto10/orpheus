And you ah? You do ah?  
  
We let it in, we give it out.  
And in the end, what's it all about?  
It must be love.  
  
I give you my, I give you my  
You give me your, you give me your joy.  
  
We used to say "Ah Hell, we're young"  
But now we see that life is sad. And so is love.  
(Ooh baby live your life for love)  
(Ooh baby live your life for love)  
  
We used to say "Ah Hell, we're young"  
But now we see that life is sad. And so is love.  
(Ooh baby for the sake of love)  
(Ooh baby for the sake of love)  
  
And whatever happens, what really matters?  
It's all we've got, isn't that enough?  
(Life is sad and so is love).  
  
You let it slip, you let it slip.  
(Life is sad and so is love)  
  
I love you more, I love you more for it.  
(Life is sad and so is love)  
  
Oh yeah, oh you too.  
(Life is sad and so is love)  
  
All for love.  
(Life is sad and so is love)  
Just for the sake of love.  
(Life is sad and so is love)  
You set me free, I set you free.  
(Life is sad and so is love)
