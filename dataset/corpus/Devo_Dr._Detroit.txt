Don't you stop  
Don't you wonder why  
Life itself pops in  
And takes you by surprise  
  
Don't you try to run  
It gets you from behind  
Like a common cold  
It takes you for a ride  
  
Now is the time  
To call me doctor  
This is a serious case  
There's not much time  
Now call me doctor  
They love to watch him operate  
It comes and goes  
So call me doctor  
They need a special technique  
It grows and grows  
Now call me doctor  
Calling doctor, doctor Detroit  
  
Call me doctor (Call me doctor)  
No need to look  
He's not in the book  
The doctor's not an M.D.  
What he does this time he does for free  
  
Now is the time  
To call me doctor  
This is a serious case  
There's not much time  
Now call me doctor  
They love to watch him operate  
It comes and goes  
So call me doctor  
They need a special technique  
It grows and grows  
Now call me doctor  
Calling doctor, doctor Detroit
