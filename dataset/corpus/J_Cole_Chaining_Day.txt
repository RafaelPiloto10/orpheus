Look at me, pathetic nigga, this chain that I bought  
You mix greed, pain and fame, this is heinous result  
Let these words be the colors I'm just paintin my heart  
I'm knee-deep in the game and it ain't what I thought  
Copped the range rover my girl got the mercedes  
Iced out crazy I wanna shine like baby  
Compared to that nigga I ain't even got a bib yet  
Truth be told I ain't even bought a crib yet  
This is everything they told a nigga not to do  
Image is everything I see, it got a lot to do  
With the way that people perceive, and what they believe  
Money short so this jewelry is like a weave  
Meant to deceive and hear niggas say I see you  
Now bitches wanna fuck you and niggas wanna be you  
And police wanna stop you, frisk you wonder what he do  
If a hater snatch yo chain, I bet it still won't free you  
Cause I'll be right back grinding 'til I cop another  
I sit and think about all this shit I coulda copped my mother  
My partner said that's just the game my nigga  
Swear I heard my jeweler say, "Here go your chain my nigga"  
  
This is chaining day  
I need you to love me, love me  
Chaining day, my chaining day  
I need you to love me, love me  
My chaining day  
My last piece, I swear, my guilt heavy as this piece I wear  
They even iced out Jesus' hair  
My last piece, I swear, they even iced out Jesus' hair  
  
Ice on this white Jesus seem a little unholy  
The real strange thing about this iced out Rolly  
It's the same shit a broke black nigga get gassed at  
The same shit a rich white mo'fucka laugh at  
Well laugh on white man, I ain't paid as you  
But I bet your rims ain't the same age as you  
And I ain't got no investment portfolio  
But my black and white diamonds shinin' like a Oreo  
I know back home where niggas sit today  
He rock a chain and he always got some shit to say  
Even back when I was broke I knew his shit was fake  
He'd prolly sneeze too hard and his shit could break  
But hey, you know the sayin', "Fake it 'til you make it"  
Me, I did the opposite, made it then I faked it  
And actin' like I gave a fuck, money I was savin' up  
To buy a crib that's gated to that hundred racks  
I gave it up, for what  
  
I need you to love me, love me  
Chaining day, my chaining day  
I need you to love me, love me  
My chaining day  
My last piece, I swear, my guilt heavy as this piece I wear  
They even iced out Jesus' hair  
My last piece, I swear  
  
Lord  
This is the last time  
Told my accountant, It's the last time  
I swear this is the last time  
I know that I said that last time  
But this the last time  
Mama I swear this is the last time  
So don't take my Chains from me  
This is the last time  
'Cause I chose this slavery  
This is the last time  
Don't take my chains from me  
This is the last time  
'Cause I love this slavery  
I need you to love me, love me, love me  
I need you to love me, love me, love me  
I need you to love me, love me, love me  
I need you to love me, love me, love me  
I need you to love me, love me, love me  
I need you to love me, love me, love me  
I need you to love me, love me, love me  
I need you to love me, love me, love me  
  
I said this is my last time
