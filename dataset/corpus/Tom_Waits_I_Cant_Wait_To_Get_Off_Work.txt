I don't mind working, 'cause I used to be jerking off most of my time in bars,  
I've been a cabbie and a stock clerk and a soda-fountain jock-jerk  
And a manic mechanic on cars.  
It's nice work if you can get it, now who the hell said it?  
I got money to spend on my gal,  
But the work never stops, and I'll be busting my chops  
Working for Joe and Sal.  
  
And I can't wait to get off work and see my baby,  
She said she'd leave the porch light on for me.  
I'm disheveled and I'm disdainful and I'm distracted and it's painful,  
But this job sweeping up here is gainfully employing me tonight.  
  
Well Tom, do this and Tom, do that, and Tom, don't do that,  
Count the cash, clean the oven, dump the trash,  
Oh your loving is a rare and a copacetic gift,  
And I'm a moonlight watch manic, it's hard to be romantic  
Sweeping up over by the cigarette machine,  
Sweeping up over by the cigarette machine  
  
I can't wait to get off work and see my baby  
She'll be waiting up with a magazine for me.  
Clean the bathrooms and clean 'em good, oh your loving I wish you would  
Come down here and sweep a-me off my feet, this broom'll have to be my baby,  
If I hurry, I just might get off before the dawn's early light.
