Oh, we are friends and lovers forever  
Oh, yes, we're friends and lovers forever  
  
I had a heart full of love, I had to get to anywhere  
Then you came along way and lovin' right you did to it  
Oh, you love me even though I make you ask for it  
And even when I need you, well, I can't make you ask for it  
  
Because we are friends and lovers forever  
Oh, yes, we're friends and lovers forever  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
We become so familiar with the asking of each other  
Oh, we even grow with the asking and the giving of each other  
Oh, they say love is someone you can't fill yourself with  
So when I'm hung up with you all I want  
I want to be [Incomprehensible]  
  
Baby, baby, take it, take it  
Say that you want more, more  
Baby, baby, take it, take it  
That's what love is for, yeah  
  
Because we are friends and lovers forever  
Oh, yes we're friends and lovers forever  
Oh, friends and lovers forever  
Oh, yes we're friends and lovers forever  
Oh, yes we're friends
