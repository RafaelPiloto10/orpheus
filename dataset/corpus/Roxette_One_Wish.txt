One wish  
  
If you had one wish, what would it be  
If you had one wish, would it be about me  
Just one with, could it be about me  
  
You might make it wish for money or peace  
You'd make it wish for cosmic relieve  
Shade by the trees, green summer leaves  
  
Well I was thinking that  
Hey hey hey hey  
Maybe one day I wish of you and me  
Yeah hey hey hey hey  
Maybe one day I wish of you and me  
  
Please don't tell me what I don't need to know  
Please stop offer what I shouldn't know  
I don't wanna know what doesn't show  
  
If you had one wish, what would it be  
If you had one wish, would it be about me  
Just one with, could it be about me  
  
Cause I was thinking that  
Hey hey hey hey  
Maybe one day I wish of you and me  
Yeah hey hey hey hey  
Maybe one day I wish of you and me  
  
Waited high and down below  
Shine a light down here below  
  
One wish  
  
Hey hey hey hey  
Maybe one day I wish of you and me  
Yeah hey hey hey hey  
Maybe one day I wish of you and me  
  
Yeah hey hey hey hey  
Maybe one day I wish of you and me  
Yeah hey hey hey hey  
Maybe one day I wish of you and me
