Ahh,  
I feel my spirit fly, only after dark  
Ahh, Ahhh  
I, I kiss the world good-bye, only after dark  
Ahh, Ahhh  
Night, with the city lights, only after dark  
Ahh, Ahhh  
Run like a runaway, only after dark  
Ahh, Ahhh  
  
Won't you disappear  
Into midnight again  
  
Why don't you come  
Why won't you come  
Why don't you fly fly fly with me  
Sweet innocent fate will be our company  
  
Ahh, Ahhh, Ahh, Ahhh  
We at the plant remain, only after dark  
Ahh, Ahhh  
Moon, simple as can be, only after dark  
Ahh, Ahhh,  
It's wrong to feel so free, only after dark  
Ahh, Ahhh  
Only you do it to me, only after dark
