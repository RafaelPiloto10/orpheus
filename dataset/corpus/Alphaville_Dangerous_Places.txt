People buzzing around,  
They don't know a thing  
They just a laugh  
And the ones in power are always pulling the strings  
People do what they do,  
How much can they take  
They just get the news  
And the ones in power always get the cake  
But you got ambition,  
You got the face, come on, let's go to a dangerous place  
You got the class, I think you're desperate,  
Let's go to a dangerous place  
Come on, let's go, come on,  
Let's go, come on  
I promise this thing will sell,  
I promise I'll take you to heaven  
I promise this thing will sell, and I just can't wait  
You have your plans, all these plans  
And there are moments,  
Shall I call them a chance  
If I was you I would make them all mine  
And if I ain't got the power I would commit a crime  
But you got ambition  
I promise this thing will sell  
I'm gonna make you a deal,  
You know I'm your friend  
I'm gonna stay with you until the very end  
I know you got the guts,  
I got a lot of time  
I'm gonna make me yours  
Before I make you mine
