May His peace be with you till we meet again  
May His peace be with you till we meet again  
Till we reach that distant shore  
And we'll shed a tear no more  
May He give you strength to endure  
Till we meet again  
May His love be with you till we meet again  
May His love be with you till we meet again  
Till we reach that promised land  
And we'll walk hand in hand  
May He give you strength to stand  
Till we meet again
