[Chorus]  
Hallelujah!  
Go tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
Go tell it on the mountain  
Jesus Christ is born  
  
Down the lonely manger  
The humble Christ was born  
And God sent salvation  
That blessed Christmas morn  
  
[Chorus]  
  
While shepherds kept their watch  
O'er silent flocks by night  
Behold throughout the heavens  
There shown a holy light  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Down the lonely manger  
The humble Christ was born  
And God sent salvation  
That blessed Christmas morn  
  
[Chorus]
