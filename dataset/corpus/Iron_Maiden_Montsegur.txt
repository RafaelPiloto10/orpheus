I stand alone in this desolate space  
In death they are truly alive  
Massacred innocence, evil took place  
The angels were burning inside  
  
Centuries later I wonder why  
What secret they took to their grave  
Still burning heretics under our skies  
Religion's still burning inside  
  
[Chorus]  
At the gates and the walls of Montsegur  
Blood on the stones of the citadel  
At the gates and the walls of Montsegur  
Blood on the stones of the citadel  
At the gates and the walls of Montsegur  
Blood on the stones of the citadel  
At the gates and the walls of Montsegur  
Blood on the stones of the citadel  
  
As we kill them all so God will know his own  
The innocents died for the Pope on his throne  
Catholic greed and its paranoid zeal  
Curse of the grail and the blood of the cross  
  
Templar believers with blood on their hands  
Joined in the chorus to kill on demand  
Burned at the stake for their soul's liberty  
To stand with the catharsis, to die and be free  
  
The book of Old Testament crippled and black  
Satan - his weapon is lust  
Leaving this evil damnation of flesh  
Back to the torture of lies  
  
The perfect ones willingly died at the stake  
And all of their followers slain  
As for the knowledge of God they had claimed  
Religion's still burning inside  
  
[Chorus]  
  
As we kill them all so God will know his own  
The innocents died for the Pope on his throne  
Catholic greed and its paranoid zeal  
Curse of the grail and the blood of the cross  
  
Templar believers with blood on their hands  
Joined in the chorus to kill on command  
Burned at the stake for their soul's liberty  
Still running herretics under our skies  
  
As we kill them all so God know his own  
Laugh at the darkness and in god we trust  
The eye in the triangle smiling with sin  
No passover feast for the cursed within  
  
Facing the sun as they went to their grave  
Burn like a dog or you live like a slave  
Death is the price for your soul's liberty  
To stand with the catharsis and to die and be free  
  
[Chorus]
