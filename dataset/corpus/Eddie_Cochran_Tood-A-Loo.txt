Baby-baby-baby, please don't say goodnight  
Hold me near and have no fear, let me hold you tight  
I'm a fool, who's the lovin' kind  
You qot me flippin' out of my mind  
Tood-a-loo, I'm in love with you  
Tood-a-loo, tood-a-loo, I'll be seem' you  
Tood-a-loo, tood-a-loo, I'll be seem' you  
Kiss me baby, say you love me tood-a-loo, tood-a-loo  
Baby-baby-baby, if your heart would know  
What your kisses do to me, please don't let me go  
Now's the time, like the wise man said  
You better go in while you're still ahead  
Tood-a-loo, I'm in love with you
