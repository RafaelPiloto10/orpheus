I climbed up the tree in the back and got on my roof top  
With my twenty-two it's hot with little pops  
Started bustin' off shots aimin' all at the sky  
I emptied out the gun bustin' all at the sky  
Then I went and stole the bow and arrow from my dad  
To the arrow tips I tied gasoline soaked rags  
Climbed up with the Zippo, lit 'em off in the sky  
A trail of black smoke leading off in the sky  
I bought some Chinese stars from the Kung-Fu surplus  
They had 'em under the glass, I made the purchase  
Climbed up and I whizzed 'em off in the sky  
  
Even stood up on the chimney, whizzed 'em off in the sky  
Then I found a double barrel with shells at Wal-Mart  
I threw it in next to the Faygo in my shopping cart  
I got home, climbed up and blew it off in the sky  
3:20 in the morning, bustin' off at the sky  
I got a blow gun too, a real one at that  
I dip the tips in poison, lay up on my back  
And now they're piercing through the air straight up into the sky  
  
It's like the only thing you hear is into the sky  
I bought a harpoon off the Internet and went up  
And tried to shoot it but the fuckin' rip off, it got stuck  
I said "fuck it" and I threw the spear up into the sky  
As fuckin' hard as I could, I threw it into the sky  
I'm sprayin' mace up there, I throw M-80s up there  
I'm shootin' everything I got, I sit and wait in my chair  
Because I hate the sky above, whether moon or sun  
Whether rain or snow, since the pain begun  
  
I'm tryin' to aim for the Heavens up into the sky  
Tell me why the love of my life had to die?  
How's she gonna leave me and not even say bye?  
I know that she's an angel and they're lettin' her fly  
Every plan I thought we made together was a lie  
She could of hung on, I bet she didn't even try  
She left me dry, and that no one can deny  
And when she fall from the sky, I'm askin' her why  
  
[Chorus: x8]  
Angels are falling!  
Angels are falling!  
Falling angels!  
(Come crashing down to the floor  
Won't stop 'til I get the one that I'm looking for)
