I take one look at you  
It leaves me breathless  
I see your dreams come true  
You're not so restless  
Or light, or bright  
Marianne  
One day I might not care  
What happened to me  
Your lack of sympathy fails to disturb me  
I've got a life of my own  
I remember the day I thought we couldn't lose  
Running round the garden in your mother's shoes  
Playing with your sisters  
I didn't see you were a grown up girl  
And bringing me tea  
But is it life in a grown up world  
On a cold autumn day  
Is it life, someone's wife  
When the car had broken down  
The best of my girls  
I didn't see you were a grown up girl  
Oh how I hate the celebration  
But you give it all away leaving me on my own  
But is it life in a grown up world  
I can't wait for the end of the celebration  
Is it life, someone's wife  
Add it up, all that's left is a space in a life  
That goes on as before  
One day I might not care  
What happens to me  
Your lack of sympathy fails to disturb me  
I've got a life of my own  
Add it up, all that's left is a space in a life  
That goes on as before  
Marianne  
Add it up, all that's left is a space in a life  
That goes on as before  
Marianne  
Add it up, All that's left is a space in a life  
That goes on as before  
Marianne  
Add it up, all that's left is a space in a life  
At the end of the world  
Marianne
