[Chorus]  
After a while, after a while  
This too shall pass  
After a while  
Scars will heal, you'll love again  
It won't hurt you after a while  
It won't hurt after a while  
  
Stuck between if and when  
You pray and tried  
But still no end  
God's purpose soon you'll understand  
It won't hurt you after a while  
It won't hurt you after a while  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So when the pain has come to an end  
And now your heart is whole again  
Help someone who needs to know  
That it won't hurt them after a while  
It won't hurt them after a while  
It won't hurt them after a while
