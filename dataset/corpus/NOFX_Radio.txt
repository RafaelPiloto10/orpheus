Never fell in love  
Until I fell in love with you  
Never know what a good time was until I had a good time with you  
If you want to get the feeling and you want to get it right  
Then the music gotta be loud  
For when the music hit I feel no pain at all  
  
Warm summer night I was drinking with my dad  
He tried to give me the love that I never had  
But he gave more love to his bottle of wine  
So I had to go out and find love of another kind  
  
Here it is  
Here I am  
Turn it up  
Fucking loud  
  
Radio, Radio, Radio  
  
When I got the music  
I got a place to go  
  
Radio clash  
Magnificent 7  
I was a choir boy  
You showed me no heaven  
Two tools surely lost  
No remorse ignoring the cost  
  
Here it is  
Here I am  
Turn it up  
Fucking loud  
  
Radio, Radio, Radio  
  
When I got the music  
I got a place to go
