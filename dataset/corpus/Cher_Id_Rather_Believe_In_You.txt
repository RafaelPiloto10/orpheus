Got another phone call  
Someone wants to help  
It's time I learned the truth, they said  
About all the lies you tell  
Though it's hard to hide the fear  
What I heard is true  
I rather trust the memories  
The years of loving you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Yes (yes), yes (yes)  
I'd rather believe in you  
Yes (yes), yes (yes)  
I'd rather believe in you  
I know we've had our share  
Of troubles long within the past  
Till I know  
I'd rather believe  
I'd rather believe in you  
  
No papers here to bind you  
Only love to make you stay  
Stories never latch  
To either one anyway  
Regardless of the many stories  
I heard of things you do  
Until you show me differently  
Rather believe in you  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
No, no, no  
I don't wanna hear anymore  
Oh don'tcha know  
I heard it all before  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Yes (yes), yes (yes)  
I'd rather believe in you (x5)
