I did my baby wrong  
Left her all alone  
Maybe she'll forgive me  
Now that I've come home  
I stand here knockin' on her front door  
  
Big door open wide  
Won't you let me in  
My love's on the other side  
Oh yes, let me in  
Big door you stand too high between us  
Can't get under, can't get over  
Big door swing open, I still love her  
  
I never should have left her  
Her love was always true  
Maybe she'll forgive me  
Oh, what will I do  
'Cause she won't answer her frontdoor  
  
Big door open wide  
Won't you let me in  
My love's on the other side  
Oh yes, let me in  
Big door you're keepin' us apart  
Can't get under, can't get over  
Big door swing open, I still love her  
Oh, big door swing open, I still love her  
Yes, big door swing open, I still love her
