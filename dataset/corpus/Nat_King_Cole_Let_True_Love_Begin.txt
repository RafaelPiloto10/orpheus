When you're young  
You're afraid of the dark  
Then you grow up  
Unafraid of the dark  
  
So, darling, when I kiss you  
And your heart goes in a spin  
Don't be afraid  
Let true love begin  
  
Oh, when you're alone  
You're afraid that it's true  
Love won't come  
It won't hapoen to you  
  
So to let this chance  
For happiness go by  
Would be a sin  
Don't be afraid  
Let true love begin  
  
I know the feeling  
That you're feeling is new  
And your heart still  
Wants to hide  
  
This feeling that  
Sends you reeling  
I'm feeling too  
It's love, it cannot be denied  
  
So take my hand  
I'll always be at your side  
There's no need  
For you to hide  
  
So listen to your heart that's  
Telling you from deep within  
Don't be afraid  
Let true love begin  
  
Don't be afraid  
Let true love begin  
Don't be afraid  
Let true love begin
