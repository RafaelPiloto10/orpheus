One, two, three, four  
  
Girl, on the edge flippin' off the lamp  
There'll be an end darling to your endless night  
On the other side of the street.  
Yea, the light on your portrait and the light in your face  
And you'll be looking for another pretty place  
Baby, this side of the street.  
  
Well, keep dreaming baby that your desire brings and girl  
I know the sadness that you find in things, it's true  
Well, baby if you can't take the heat, what can I do?  
  
Well, you and your poetry and your boku world  
Behind the face you hide the face of a modern girl  
On the other side of the street.  
Yea, you've got the look as if you owe the world  
Therefore, you go out there and say what you can earn  
On the wrong side of the street.  
  
Well, you tire of every day bringing the same and so you  
Go out looking for some strange new games  
Well, pretty soon you don't know the score anymore.  
  
All right now... (guitar break)  
  
I know the danger that your desire brings  
And I know the strangeness that you'll find  
Wait and it will seem straighter for you and for me.  
Well, turn on the end and baby turn off the lamps  
There'll be an end darling to this endless night  
On the other side of the street.  
  
Yea, and everyday well it just brings the same  
You started looking for some very strange new games  
On the wrong side of the street.  
Well, you and your desires lead to confusion  
Well, walk away as I don't follow your illusions  
And see, open your eyes and see, girl.  
  
All right...
