Well, do you wanna dance and hold my hand  
Squeeze me, baby,  
I'm your man  
Oh baby, do you wanna dance  
Well, do you wanna dance under the moonlight  
Squeeze and hug me all through the night  
Oh baby, do you wanna dance  
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance  
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance  
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance  
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance  
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance  
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance  
Well, do you wanna dance to a rock and roll band  
Come on, baby, give me your hand  
Oh baby, do you wanna dance  
Well, do you wanna dance under the moonlight  
Squeeze and hug me all through the night  
Oh baby, do you wanna dance  
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance  
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance  
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance  
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance  
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance  
Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance
