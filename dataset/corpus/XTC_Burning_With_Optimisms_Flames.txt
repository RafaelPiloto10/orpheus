Never seen her glowing  
All that bright she's throwing  
Like some aurora  
From her head it's growing  
Reaching to the ground and all around  
Like a Navajo blanket  
  
Never heard her singing  
Now she's gently ringing  
Like copper wind chimes  
What on earth is bringing up this stream  
The cat who got the cream is licking her lips  
And smiling like her Cheshire cousin  
She claims she's found a way to make her own light  
All you do is smile, you banish the night  
  
She says she's burning with optimism's flames, away away  
She says she's burning up all her guilts and shames, away away  
She says she's burning with optimism's flames, away away  
She says she's burning up  
  
Now you see I'm smiling  
Back to juvenile'ing  
I learnt her lesson  
In like flint and styling  
All the world is neatly curled around my littlest finger  
  
I can't stop this grinning  
So assume I'm winning  
Threw pessimism  
In the air it's spinning  
Crashing to the floor and nevermore  
Will it lure me away with sweets  
And shiny things just like a magpie  
  
Now every bird and bee just fuel the fire for me  
Now every closing door just fans the flames some more  
  
(Now I'm thinking okay)  
(I'm turning night into day)
