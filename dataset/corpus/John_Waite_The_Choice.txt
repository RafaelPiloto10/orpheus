I will be there for you  
For you are mine  
And I'll take care of you  
Every single time  
I'll be watching over you  
When the world seems bitter cold  
When you're closer to the edge  
And you're feeling so alone  
But do you still recognize  
When you hear love's voice  
I will come through for you  
Every single time  
And I will be there in your winter  
To turn your water into wine  
And I'll be there in your darkness  
In the daylight like your sun  
You see you make my heart beat fast  
My love  
You are my special one  
But do you still recognize  
When you hear love's voice  
But are you so surprised  
That you and I  
We've both got a choice  
Do you hear my name  
On a crowded street  
Ain't it such a shame  
All our hearts are incomplete  
Oh oh oh  
Together together  
Ah ah ah  
I'll be there in your darkness  
In the daylight like your sun  
See you make my heart beat fast my love  
You are my special one  
Do you still recognize  
When you hear love's voice  
Are you surprised  
You and I we've both got a choice  
Can you feel my heart beat  
Like I feel your heart beat  
Lovers of the world  
Never complete  
Can you hear  
Can you hear my voice  
In this dark and lonely place  
You and I will always have a choice  
Can't you hear my voice  
Can't you see this look on my face  
You and I we've still got a choice  
Can't you hear my voice  
Can't you see this look in my eyes  
We've both got a choice  
Can you hear my voice  
Don't you see if you believe in me  
We've both got a choice
