Fopped last night and the night before  
I had to fopp outside and then I went indoors  
Fopped so hard I made the people warm  
They stood back and gave me all the floor  
  
I did the fopp, the fopp  
they wouldn't let me stop  
Yeah I was foppin' and rockin'  
Had the house hoppin'  
  
Foppin', the way it makes you go, everybody was  
Foppin', everywhere you go, do all your  
Shoppin', wiggle to the floor, everybody was Foppin'  
  
Fopp with me and I'll fopp with you  
Foppin' is the brand new thing to do  
Fopped so hard that I lost my shoe  
I fopped so tough they had to make some room  
  
Break your leg, don't you fopp your back  
Do your thing, don't you give no slack  
Shake your hips and then you turn around  
Well first you fopp it up  
And then you fopp it down  
  
Fopp me right, don't you fopp me wrong  
We'll be here foppin' all night long  
I'm too short, baby, and you're too tall  
But when we're foppin' that don't mean a thing at all  
  
Foppin', the way it makes you go, everybody was  
Foppin', everywhere you go, do all your  
Shoppin', wiggle to the floor,, everybody was Foppin'
