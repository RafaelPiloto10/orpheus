I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold I'd rather be his than have riches
untold  
I'd rather have Jesus than houses or land I'd rather be led by his nail
pierced hands  
Than to be the queen of the best domain and beheld in sin's dreads way  
I'd rather have Jesus than anything this world affords today  
  
I'd rather have Jesus than men's applause I'd rather be faithful to his dear
cause  
I'd rather have Jesus then world wide things I'd rather be true to his holy
name  
Than to be the queen
