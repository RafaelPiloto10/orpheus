No I won't surrender  
At any cost  
You're something so sweet and tender  
From my heart  
  
Yes I've done my evil  
I've done my good  
Just believe me honey  
I won't let go off you  
  
You are the one  
And there's no regrets at all  
You are the one  
And there's no regrets at all  
  
We've had our share of misfortune  
We've had our blues  
And God is not on our side  
Yes it's true  
We keep forgetting baby  
The others too  
There is no one who can take that away  
From me and you  
  
You are the one  
And there's no regrets at all  
  
You are the one  
And there's no regrets at all  
.
