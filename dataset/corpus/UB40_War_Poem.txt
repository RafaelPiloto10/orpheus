Silence falls on no-mans land  
To echo on uncertain footsteps  
Sharp of iron quick of hand  
Advancing forward to regrets  
Under foot the and mortars  
Slip away the codes of warnings  
From the top the barking orders  
Light the sky and leave that morning  
  
CHORUS  
Seek asylum from the terror  
Reaching out for what its worth  
Shelter from the raging anger  
Raining down on bitter worlds  
  
Those the people all whose hurting  
Getting lost between the lines  
Its the stuff that keeps returning  
Laughing lound in victors lies  
Up above on winds declaring  
Soon the cold will whistle through  
Push aside the warm sea air  
That fills the sails that carry you  
  
CHORUS X3  
Many miles are put between oh  
What once was and what will be  
Sleep all night and dream sweet dreams  
Step inside to history  
Every whisper sings resistance  
All emotions hide inside  
Refugee looks to the distance  
Out there somewhere lies his pride  
  
CHORUS
