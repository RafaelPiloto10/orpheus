Gaze on the glistening lights below and above  
Oh, what a night of nights for people in love  
No city but this my friend, no city I know  
Gives romance such a chance to grow and grow  
  
Paris loves lovers, for lovers it's heaven above  
Paris tells lovers, love is supreme, wake up your dream and make love  
Only in Paris one discovers the urge to merge with the splurge of the spring  
Paris loves lovers for lovers know that love is everything  
  
Paris loves lovers, for lovers it's heaven above  
(Capitalistic, characteristic, sensualistic, they should be atheistic)  
Paris tells lovers, love is supreme, wake up your dream and make love  
(Imperialistic, I'm pessimistic, that's anti communistic)  
  
Only in Paris one discovers the urge to merge with the splurge of the spring  
(Militaristic, you're optimistic, du jour propaganda)  
Paris loves lovers for lovers know that love is everything  
(Unrealistic, is individualistic and not at all collectivistic but a low  
Totalitarianistic thing)
