Be strong, baby please be strong  
Won't last, baby won't last long  
We were happy in our home  
  
Raise the roof, raise the roof, raise it high  
Raise the roof, raise the roof, raise it high  
Raise the roof, raise the roof, raise it high  
  
Take care, baby please take care  
Somewhere, find yourself a prayer  
We were happy in our home  
  
Raise the roof, raise the roof, raise it high  
Raise the roof, raise the roof, raise it high  
Raise the roof, raise the roof, raise it high  
  
Be strong, baby please be strong  
Won't last, baby won't last long  
We were happy in our home  
  
Raise the roof, raise the roof, raise it high  
Raise the roof, raise the roof, raise it high  
Raise the roof, raise the roof, raise it high
