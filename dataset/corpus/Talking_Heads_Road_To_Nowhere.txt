Well we know where we're goin'  
But we don't know where we've been  
And we know what we're knowin'  
But we can't say what we've seen  
And we're not little children  
And we know what we want  
And the future is certain  
Give us time to work it out  
  
[Chorus:]  
We're on a road to nowhere  
Come on inside  
Takin' that ride to nowhere  
We'll take that ride  
  
I'm feelin' okay this mornin'  
And you know,  
We're on the road to paradise  
Here we go, here we go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Maybe you wonder where you are  
I don't care  
Here is where time is on our side  
Take you there...take you there  
  
We're on a road to nowhere  
We're on a road to nowhere  
We're on a road to nowhere  
  
There's a city in my mind  
Come along and take that ride  
And it's all right, baby, it's all right  
  
And it's very far away  
But it's growing day by day  
And it's all right, baby, it's all right  
  
They can tell you what to do  
But they'll make a fool of you  
And it's all right, baby, it's all right  
  
We're on a road to nowhere
