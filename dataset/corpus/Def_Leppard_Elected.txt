I'm your top prime cut of meat, I'm your choice  
I wanna be elected  
I'm a yankee doodle dandy in a gold Rolls Royce  
I wanna be elected  
The kids need a savior, they don't want a fake  
I wanna be elected  
We're all gonna rock to the rules that I make  
I wanna be elected  
  
Elected  
Elected  
Respected  
I wanna be selected  
  
I never lied to you, I've always been cool  
I wanna be elected  
I have to get the votes, I told you about school  
I wanna be elected  
  
Elected  
Elected  
Hallelujah  
I wanna be selected, come on  
Ooh yeah  
  
We're gonna rock this place, take the country by storm  
I wanna be elected  
You and me together, young and strong  
I wanna be elected  
  
Elected  
Elected  
Respected, selected, call collected  
I wanna be elected, oh, oh, come on  
This time
