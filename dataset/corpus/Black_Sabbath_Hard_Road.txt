Old men crying, young men dying  
World still turns as Father Time looks on  
On and on  
Children playing, dreamers praying  
Laughter turns to tear as love has gone  
Has it gone?  
  
Oh, it's a hard road  
Oh, it's a hard road  
  
Whirlwind churning, lovers learning  
On this path of life we can't back down  
Is it wrong?  
Widows weeping, babies sleeping  
Life becomes the singer and the song  
Sing along  
  
Oh, it's a hard road  
Carry your own load  
  
Why make the hard road?  
Why can't we be friends?  
No need to hurry  
We'll meet in the end  
  
Why make the hard road?  
Why can't we be friends?  
No need to worry  
Let's sing it again  
  
Brother's sharing, mother's caring  
Nightime falling victim to the dawn  
Shadows small  
Days are crawling, time is calling  
To the Earth that not that life has gone  
Love line drawn  
  
Oh, it's a hard road  
Carry your own load  
Oh, it's a hard road  
Oh, it's a hard road  
  
We're living in sorrow, we're living the best  
And look to the future, 'cause life goes together now  
We're living in sorrow, we're living the best  
And look to the future, 'cause life goes together now  
We're living in sorrow, we're living the best  
And look to the future, 'cause life goes together now
