Comin' home from work today I saw our future  
And old man and his wife were holdin' hands  
They were sittin' on a front porch swing  
Like two young lovers  
I waved to them as I went by then I realized  
That life does not grow dimmer with the settin' of the sun  
The best years of our lives still are yet to come.  
In our old age love will just get better  
The longer we're together, we'll grow stronger everyday  
Our bodies may get weaker and our hair will turn gray  
But love will never fade in our age ( love will never fade ).  
One day the kids will all be grown and they'll be leavin'  
And it will be like it was years ago  
We'll be sittin' on the front porch swing like two young lovers  
'cause today I just saw what our future holds
