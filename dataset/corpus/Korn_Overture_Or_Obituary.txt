I'm facing the light  
But fading to black  
I'm offering peace  
As I'm stabed in the back  
  
Yet I'm feeling able  
My house is made up still  
With paper for doors  
  
I've tryed to hate you  
But feel regret  
I'm most uncertain  
I've lost the bet  
I'm waiting to watch it  
I'm waiting to see  
Is this my overture? Or obituary?  
  
I'm holding the torch  
But melting my fists  
I'm first in the line  
Yet last on the list  
  
Yet I'm feeling able  
My house is made up still  
With paper for doors  
  
I've tryed to hate you  
But feel regret  
I'm most uncertain  
I've lost the bet  
I'm waiting to watch it  
I'm waiting to see  
Is this my overture? Or obituary?  
  
Or obituary!  
  
I tryed not to choke you (No!)  
But now you're dead (No!)  
I'm most uncertain (No!)  
Should I feel regret? (No!)  
  
I've tryed to hate you  
But feel regret  
I'm most uncertain  
I've lost the bet  
I'm waiting to watch it  
I'm waiting to see  
Is this my overture? Or obituery?  
  
I tryed not to choke you!  
  
Is this my overture? Or obituery?
