Jesus, the missing years  
  
It was raining. It was cold  
West Bethlehem was no place for a twelve year old  
So he packed his bags and he headed out  
To find out what the world's about  
He went to France. He went to Spain  
He found love. He found pain.  
He found stores so he started to shop  
But he had no money so he got in trouble with a cop  
Kids in trouble with the cops  
From Israel didn't have no home  
So he cut his hair and moved to Rome  
It was there he met his Irish bride  
And they rented a flat on the lower east side of Rome...  
Italy that is  
Music publishers, book binders, Bible belters, Money Changers,  
Spoon Benders and lots of pretty Italian chicks.  
  
[Chorus]  
Charley bought some popcorn  
Billy bought a car  
Someone almost bought the farm  
But they didn't go that far  
Things shut down at midnight  
At least around here they do  
Cause we all reside down the block  
Inside at, 23 Skidoo.  
  
Wine was flowing so were beers  
So Jesus found his missing years  
So He went to a dance and said "This don't move me"  
He hiked up his pants and he went to a movie  
On his thirteenth birthday he saw "Rebel without a Cause"  
He went straight on home and invented Santa Claus  
Who gave him a gift and he responded in kind  
He gave the gift of love and went out of his mind  
You see him and the wife wasn't getting along  
So he took out his guitar and he wrote a song  
Called "The Dove of Love Fell Off the Perch"  
But he couldn't get divorced in the Catholic Church  
At least not back then anyhow  
Jesus was a good guy he didn't need this shit  
So he took a pill with a bag of peanuts and  
A Coca-Cola and he swallowed it.  
He discovered the Beatles  
And he recorded with the Stones  
Once He even opened up a three-way package  
In Southern California for old George Jones  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The years went by like sweet little days  
With babies crying pork chops and beaujolais  
When he woke up he was seventeen  
The world was angry. The world was mean.  
Why the man down the street and the kid on the stoop  
All agreed that life stank. All the world smelled like poop  
Baby poop that is ..the worst kind  
So he grew his hair long and thew away his comb  
And headed back to Jerusalem to find Mom, Dad and home  
But when he got there the cupboard was bare  
Except for an old black man with a fishing rod  
He said "Whatcha gonna be when you grow up?"  
Jesus said "God"  
Oh my God, what have I gotten myself into?  
I'm a human corkscrew and all my wine is blood  
They're gonna kill me Mama. They don't like me Bud.  
So Jesus went to Heaven and he went there awful quick  
All them people killed him and he wasn't even sick  
So come and gather around me my contemporary peers  
And I'll tell you all the story of  
Jesus, the missing years  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We all reside down the block  
Inside at, 23 Skidoo.
