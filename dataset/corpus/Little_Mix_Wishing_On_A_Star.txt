Chorus:  
I'm wishing on a star, to follow where you are  
I'm wishing on a dream, to follow what it means  
I'm wishing on the rainbows, that I've seen  
I'm wishing on the people who, really dream  
I'm wishing on tomorrow pray never comes  
I'm wishing on all of the things, we've never done  
  
I never thought I'd see, the time where you would be  
So far away from home, so far away from me  
Just think of all the moments, that we spent  
I just can't let you go, for me, you were meant  
And I didn't mean to hurt you, but I know  
In the game of love you reap what you sow  
  
I feel it's time we should make up, baby  
I feel it's time for us to get back together  
And make the best of things oh baby when we're together  
Whether or never  
  
Chorus:  
I'm wishing on a star, wishing on a star  
To follow where you are, a-a-a-are  
I'm wishing on a dream, to follow what it means  
And I wish upon the rainbows that I've seen  
I'm wishing on the people who, really dream  
And I'm wishing on tomorrow pray never comes  
I'm wishing on all the things that we, we never to-o-o-old!  
(Woo! Jls, 1D)  
  
Chorus:  
I'm wishing on a star (Oh wishing on a star)  
To follow where you are (Oh anywhere you go)  
I'm wishing on a star (I'm wishing on a star)  
To follow where you are (To where you, where you go)  
I'm wishing on a star.
