If I can see it and that's when I'm like about anything  
If I can see it, I can do it  
I used to think that I could not go on  
And life was nothing but an awful song  
But now I know the meaning of true love  
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms  
If I can see it then I can do it  
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it  
I believe I could fly  
I believe I can touch the sky  
Think about it every night and day  
Spread my wings and fly away  
I believe, I believe I can soar  
I see me running through that open door  
I believe I can fly, I believe I can fly  
I believe I can fly  
See I was on the verge of breaking down  
Sometimes silence, it can seem so loud  
There are miracles in life I must achieve  
But first I know it starts inside of me  
If I can see it, I can do it  
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it  
I believe I could fly  
I believe I can touch the sky  
I think about it every night and day  
Spread my wings and fly away  
I believe I can soar  
I see me running through that open door  
I believe I can fly, I believe I can fly  
I believe I can fly  
'Cause I believe in me  
I believe in me  
If I can see it then I can do it  
If I just, if I just believe it, there's nothing to it  
I believe, I believe I could fly  
I believe I can touch the sky  
Think about it every night and day  
Spread my wings and fly away  
I believe, I believe I can soar  
I see me running through that open door  
I believe I can fly, I believe, I believe  
I believe I can fly and I believe I can fly  
I believe I can fly  
I know, I know I can fly  
I know, I know I can soar  
See me running through that open door  
I, I can fly
