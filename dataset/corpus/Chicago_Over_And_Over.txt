Fireworks,  
Fireflys,  
On the roof watching summer night skies.  
All the boys,  
All the girls,  
All the time making love with our eyes.  
Life just went on for us  
Day after day  
We could fly!- oh!  
Cocky, so confident  
There was no way we could die.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Over, over and over again.  
Life is a circle,  
But it's over and over again.  
Over, over.  
  
Little words,  
Little games,  
The dramas we played, left behind.  
Little friends,  
Little names,  
Puppy lovers we had...(love was blind).  
Life just went on for us d  
Ay after day  
Screaming by!- oh!  
Fast as a shooting star  
Cruising the midnight sky!  
  
[Chorus]
