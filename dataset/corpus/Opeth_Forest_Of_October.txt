The memories that now rests in this forest  
Forever shadowing the sunrise of my heart  
Wings leave their nest at my coming  
Swaying away unto the cold glowing sky  
  
Dreaming away for a while  
My spirit sighs in peace  
Gazing unto the stars  
Please, take me there  
  
I am so alone, so cold  
My heart is to scarred to glow  
I wish the sunrise to come  
Take my soul (away)  
From this cold, lonely shell  
I am free  
  
From the eternal sea I rose  
Veiled in darkness on either shore  
Lost my pride, lost its glow  
For me the sun rose no more  
  
The forest of October  
Sleeps silent when I depart  
The web of time  
Hides my last trace  
  
My blaze travel the last universe  
Like the sights of magic  
Wrapped in eons  
My mind is one with my soul  
I fall alone  
While leaves fall from the weeping trees
