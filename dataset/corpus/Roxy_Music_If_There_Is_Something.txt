Please see note.  
  
If there is something that I might find  
Look around corners  
Try to find peace of mind I say  
Where would you go if you were me  
Try to keep a straight course not easy  
Somebody special looking at me  
A certain reaction we find  
What should it try to be I mean  
If there are many  
  
Meaning the same  
Be specific just a game  
I would do anything for you  
I would climb mountains  
I would swim all the oceans blue  
I would walk a thousand miles  
Reveal my secrets  
More than enough for me to share  
I would put roses round our door  
Sit in the garden  
Growing potatoes by the score  
  
Shake your hair girl with your ponytail  
Takes me right back (when you were young)  
Throw your precious gifts into the air  
Watch them fall down (when you were young)  
Lift up your feet and put them on the ground  
You used to walk upon (when you were young)  
Lift up your feet and put them on the ground  
The hills were higher (when we were young)  
Lift up your feet and put them on the ground  
The trees were taller (when you were young)  
Lift up your feet and put them on the ground  
The grass was greener (when you were young)  
Lift up your feet and put them on the ground  
You used to walk upon (when you were young)
