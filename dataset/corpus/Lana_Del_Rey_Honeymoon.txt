[Verse 1]  
We both know that it's not fashionable to love me  
But you don't go 'cause truly there's nobody for you but me  
We could cruise to the blues - Wilshire Boulevard if we choose  
Or whatever you want to do, we make the rules  
  
[Chorus]  
Our honeymoon  
Our honeymoon  
Our honeymoon  
Say you want me too  
Say you want me too  
Dark blue  
Dark blue  
  
[Verse 2]  
We both know the history of violence that surrounds you  
But I'm not scared, there's nothing to lose now that I've found you  
We could cruise to the news - Pico Poulevard in your used little bullet car if
we choose  
Mr. "Born to Lose"  
  
[Chorus]  
Our honeymoon  
Our honeymoon  
Our honeymoon  
Say you want me too  
Say you want me too  
Dark blue  
Dark blue  
  
[Bridge]  
There are violets in your eyes  
There are guns that blaze around you  
There are roses in between my thighs  
And a fire that surrounds you  
It's no wonder every man in town  
Had neither fought nor found you  
Everything you do is elusive  
To even your honey dew  
  
[Chorus - Variation]  
Our honeymoon  
Our honeymoon  
Our honeymoon  
  
[Interlude]  
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, da, da, da, da  
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, da, da, da  
Doo, doo, doo, doo, da, da, da, da, da, da  
  
[Outro]  
Dreaming away your life  
Dreaming away your life  
Dreaming away your life  
Hmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm  
Dreaming away your life  
Dreaming away your life  
Dreaming away your life  
Hmm, hmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
