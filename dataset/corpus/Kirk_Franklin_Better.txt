If I could I, I'd get away  
Far from all this trouble I see everyday  
Nobody wants to show their face  
This life is like a, like a masquerade  
I know you love me  
I know you care  
But while I'm hurting I just need to know your there  
Watching over me and I feel your telling me  
  
[Chorus]  
Count it all joy and always remember,  
Life will get better it's gonna get better  
No matter the weapon it will not prosper,  
Things will get better it's gonna get better  
  
Persecuted, pushed away, didn't think I'd live to see another day  
Cried some tears and couldn't pray and when I'd try at times  
I couldn't find the words to say, but now  
I'm stronger, because of you without you Jesus I never could've made it
through  
Thank you for watching me loving me and telling me  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Life sometimes may change and nobody wants to feel pain,  
But it came to help you grow and there's one thing you need to know  
God's in love with you and he'll never let you go  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
It's gonna get better  
It's gonna get better  
It's gonna get better  
It's gonna get better  
It's gonna get better  
It's gonna get better  
It's gonna get better
