I met a woman in West Virginia  
She said her name was Alabama  
She from a little town outside Savannah  
Where everybody talk that country grammar  
She said she killed a man down in Atlanta  
He beat her and he drank till he couldn't stand up  
He told her that he loved her but he couldn't stand her  
She caught him in his sleep, hit him with a hammger  
Then she sold her car and she bought a gun  
Johnny Law got her on the run  
Another broken bottle and the damage done  
We've all been blinded by the sun, blinded by the sun  
Her breathe was sweet, her eyes were pretty  
She said her zodiac sign was Cancer  
She was on her way to New York City  
Trying to get a job there as a dancer  
Then she asked if she could ride home with me  
Now I'm still thinking on the answer  
She pulled on love, she won't take pity  
She'll break your heart if you give her the chance to  
This time I've got an Uzi and it weights a ton  
Johnny Law got her on the run  
Another broken bottle and the damage done  
We've all been blinded by the sun, blinded by the sun  
Lord have mercy on me for all the things I've done  
I lost my mind, my eyes were blinded by the sun  
Don't forsake me Lord, I'm not the only one  
I lost my mind, my eyes were blinded by the sun  
Blinded by the sun  
This time I've got an Uzi and it weights a ton  
Johnny Law got her on the run  
Another broken bottle and the damage done  
We've all been blinded by the sun, blinded by the sun
