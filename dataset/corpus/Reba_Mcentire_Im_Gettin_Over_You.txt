I changed my number  
Bought some new clothes  
Got some different records  
And a new ?  
I'm gettin' over you  
I'm gettin' over you  
  
I'm going out dancing  
Learning new jokes  
I'm staying out later  
Than I should I suppose  
But I'm gettin' over you  
I'm gettin' over you  
  
I took our name off the mailbox  
Redecorated our room  
I'm not saying the hurtin's all gone  
But it'll be gone soon  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm gettin over you  
So what if you're not here  
I'm gettin' over you  
And it'll happen one of these years  
  
I ordered make-up  
From Vogue magazine  
I'm taking aerobics two nights a week  
And I'm getting over you  
Oh I'm getting over you  
  
I'm gettin' over you  
I'm gettin' over you  
  
My friends come over  
And they wonder why  
Your picture's back on the wall  
Instead of proving losing you  
Don't bother me at all  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm gettin' over you  
Oh I'm gettin' over you
