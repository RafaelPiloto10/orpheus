They stumbled into their lives  
In a vague way became man and wife  
One got the other they deserved one another  
They settled in a brand new town  
With people from the same background  
They kept themselves busy  
Long hours left them dizzy  
Now when he's in she's out  
  
All you ever do is fade away  
They are not making plans  
Because now they understand  
All you ever do is fade away  
  
He noticed he had visible lines  
She worried about her behind  
Their birth had been the death of them  
It didn't really bother them  
Now when she's in, he's out
