Maybe I'm amazed of the way you love me all the time  
Maybe I'm afraid of the way I love you  
Maybe I'm amazed of the way you move me out of time  
And hung me on a line  
Maybe I'm amazed of the way I really need you  
  
Maybe I'm the one, maybe I'm the only one  
Who's in the middle of something  
That I don't really understand  
Maybe you're the man, maybe you're the only man  
Who could ever help me  
Baby won't you help me understand  
  
Maybe I'm amazed of the way you're with me all the time  
Maybe I'm afraid of the way I leave you  
Maybe I'm amazed of the way you help me sing my song  
You right me when I'm wrong  
Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you  
  
Maybe I'm the one, maybe I'm the only one  
Who's in the middle of something  
That I don't really understand  
Maybe you're the man, maybe you're the only man  
Who could ever help me  
Baby won't you help me understand  
  
Maybe I'm the one, maybe I'm the only one  
Who's in the middle of something  
That I don't really understand  
Maybe you're the man, maybe you're the only man  
Who could ever help me  
Baby won't you help me understand  
  
Maybe I'm amazed of the way you love me all the time  
Maybe I'm afraid of the way I love you  
Maybe I'm amazed of the way you move me out of time  
And hung me on a line  
Maybe I'm amazed of the way I really need you  
  
Maybe I'm amazed...  
Maybe I'm amazed...  
Maybe I'm amazed...  
Maybe I'm amazed...
