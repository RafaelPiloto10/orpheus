Sometimes birds don't have enough to eat  
There's not enough food in the fields or the streets  
There are too many cities where there used to be trees so it's left up to you
and me  
Everybody loves to hear a bird sing (whistle)  
The prettiest music you have ever heard here's how to make friends with the
bird  
First you get some peanut butter out of a jar  
And you can buy a bag of bird seed anywhere  
You mix it all together and you put it on the ground  
And pretty soon the birds come around  
Everybody loves to hear...  
Some people buy spray and they spray it on the land  
They kill all the little bitty bugs that they can  
The birds eat up the bugs and it makes them sick I wish we didn't have to do
that  
Cause everybody loves to hear...  
Right now you're young and you're not very tall  
You're really very busy and you're rally very small  
Someday when you're older and things go wrong you've gotta need a pretty bird
song  
Because everybody loves to hear...
