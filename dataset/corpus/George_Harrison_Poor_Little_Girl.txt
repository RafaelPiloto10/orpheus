Poor little girl  
With her head in the air  
There's a poorly sick world all around you  
  
Poor horny boy  
One thing on his mind  
That poor little girl  
He must find you  
  
[Chorus]  
There's a whole lotta love  
Shaking inside of me  
And I must figure out why it's there  
  
There's a bottomless heart  
That's hooked into all of you  
And it's wondering how much you care  
  
Poor little girl  
With a whole in her heart  
There's a poorly sick world all around you  
  
Poor horny boy  
One thing on his mind  
That poor little girl  
He must find you  
  
There's a whole lotta love  
Shaking inside of me  
And I must figure out why it's there  
  
There's a bottomless heart  
Hooked into all of you  
And it's wondering how much you care  
  
Poor little boy  
Head in a whirl  
There's a phony slick world all around you  
  
That poor little girl  
With her head in the air  
That poor little boy he must find you  
  
There's a whole lotta love  
Shaking inside of me  
And I must figure out why it's there  
  
There's a bottomless heart  
Hooked into all of you  
And it's wondering how much you care  
  
There's a need and desire I have  
To express what's inside of me  
I must figure it out while it's still there  
  
And an endless amout of  
Of a joy that you touch me with  
Thought it's almost too much for me to bear  
  
Poor litte girl
