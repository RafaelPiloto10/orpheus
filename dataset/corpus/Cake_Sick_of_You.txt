I'm so sick of you  
so sick of me  
I don't want to be with you  
  
I'm so sick of you  
so sick of me  
I don't want to be with you  
  
I want to fly away  
I want to fly away  
  
I'm so sick of work  
so sick of play  
I don't need another day  
  
I'm so sick of work  
so sick of play  
I don't need another day  
  
I need to fly away  
I need to fly away  
  
Every shiny toy  
That at first brings you joy  
Will always start to cloy and annoy  
  
Every camera every phone  
All the music that you own  
Won't change the fact you're all alone (All alone!)  
  
Every piece of land  
every city that you plan  
will crumble into tiny grains of sand  
  
Every thing you find that at first gives you shine  
always turns into the same old crime (Same old crime!)  
  
I want to fly away  
I want to fly away  
I need to fly away  
I need to fly away  
  
(I'm so sick of you  
so sick of me  
I don't want to be with you)  
(I'm so sick of you  
so sick of me  
I don't want to be with you)  
  
Every little dance  
Every hidden back romance  
All alone (All alone!)
