Standing in line on the depot floor  
Taking my time getting through the door  
Daddy said "Go!" and mama just cried  
Sister said "Devil's on the other side"  
Hurricane blowing, water gets high  
Can't turn around or I'll drown in lies  
  
When I get back I'm gonna own this town  
Shine that medal and wear that crown  
Fall on my knees and kiss the ground  
Dear old America  
  
Run run rabbit save your rabbit skin  
Jump right back in your hole again  
Bullets they cry whispering drone  
Fire in the sky God's on the phone  
  
When I get home I'm gonna shove my doubts  
Dream my dreams and shut my mouth  
Nobody knows what this is all about  
Dear old America  
  
We don't beg and we don't run  
We don't lose, we don't overcome  
Purple mountain majesty sliding to a broken sea  
Daddy he swear and mama she cry  
"My sweet baby she's bound to die"  
  
When I get back I'm gonna feel just fine  
One more day I'm gonna do my time  
Ain't no hammer gonna ring like mine  
  
When I get home I'm gonna shove my doubts  
Dream my dreams and shut my mouth  
No one knows what this is all about now  
  
When I get home I'm gonna shove my doubts  
Dream my dreams and shut my mouth  
No one knows what this is all about  
  
Dear old America
