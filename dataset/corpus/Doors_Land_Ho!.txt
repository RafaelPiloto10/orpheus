Grandma love a sailor  
who sailed the frozen sea.  
Grandpa was a whaler  
And he took me on his knee.  
  
He said, "Son, I'm going crazy  
From livin' on the land.  
Got to find my shipmates  
And walk on foreign sands."  
  
This old man was graceful  
With silver in his smile.  
He smoked a briar pipe and  
He walked four country miles.  
  
Singing songs of shady sisters  
And old time liberty.  
Songs of love and songs of death  
And songs to set men free.  
  
Yea!  
  
I've got three ships and sixteen men,  
A course for ports unread.  
I'll stand at mast, let north winds blow  
Till half of us are dead.  
  
Land ho!  
  
Well, if I get my hands on a dollar bill,  
Gonna buy a bottle and drink my fill.  
If I get my hands on a number five,  
Gonna skin that little girl alive.  
  
If I get my hand on a number two,  
Come back home and marry you, marry you, marry you.  
Alright!  
  
Land ho!
