My friend came to me  
With sadness in his eyes  
Told me that he wanted help  
Before his country dies  
  
Although I couldn't feel the pain  
I knew I had to try  
Now I'm asking all of you  
Help us save some lives  
  
Bangla Desh, Bangla Desh  
Where so many people are dying fast  
And it sure looks like a mess  
I've never seen such distress  
Now won't you lend your hand  
Try to understand  
Relieve the people of Bangla Desh  
  
Bangla Desh, Bangla Desh  
Such a great disaster  
I don't understand  
But it sure looks like a mess  
I never known such distress  
Please don't turn away  
I want to hear you say  
Relieve the people of Bangla Desh  
  
Relieve the people of Bangla Desh  
  
Bangla Desh, Bangla Desh  
Though it may seem so far  
From where we all are  
It's something we can't reject  
That suffering I can't neglect  
Now won't you give some bread  
Get the starving fed  
We got to relieve Bangla Desh  
  
Relieve the people of Bangla Desh  
We got to relieve Bangla Desh  
  
Now won't you lend your hand  
Try to understand  
Relieve the people of Bangla Desh
