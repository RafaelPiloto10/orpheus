I have but one heart  
This heart I bring you  
I have but one heart  
To share with you  
I have but one dream  
That I can cling to  
You are the one dream  
I pray comes true  
My darling, until I saw you  
I never felt this way  
And nobody else before you  
Ever has heard me say  
You are my one love  
My life, I live for you  
I have but one heart  
To give to you  
You are my one love  
My life, I live for you  
I have but one heart  
To give to you
