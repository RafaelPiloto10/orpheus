I used to plan and plot  
And try to live correct  
Lately I do a lot  
Of things that don't make sense  
Now I must do what I must  
Now why do you think that a man  
Jumps out of the frying pan  
Into the fire when he can  
Find a way not to get burned?  
I must do what I must do  
And I do though I know better  
I must do what I must do  
(Even though he's gonna get it)  
Below the sky above  
Beyond what's good and true  
Some thing as loud as love  
Calls out I can't refuse  
I must do what I must do  
And I do though I know better  
I must do what I must do  
(Even though he might regret it)
