Proud enough for you to call me arrogant  
Greedy enough to be labeled a thief  
Angry enough for me to go and hurt a man  
Cruel enough for me to feel no grief  
  
Never could have just a part of it  
I always need more to get by  
Getting right down to the heart of it  
The root of all evil has been running my whole life  
  
Dirty enough for me to lust  
Leaving nothing left to trust  
Jealous enough to still feel envious  
Lazy enough to sleep all day  
And let my life just waste away  
Selfish enough to make you wait for me  
  
Driven blindly by our sins  
Misled so easily  
Entirely ready to leave it behind  
I'm begging to break free  
  
Take all of me  
The desires that keep burning deep inside  
Cast them all away  
And help to give me strength to face another day  
I am ready  
Help me be what I can be  
  
Self-centered fear has got a hold me  
Clutching my throat  
Self righteous anger running all through me  
Ready to explode  
  
Procrastination paralyzing me  
Wanting me dead  
These obsessions that keep haunting me  
Won't leave my head  
  
Help to do for me what I can't do myself  
Take this fear and pain  
I can't break out of this prison all alone  
Help me break these chains  
  
Humility now my only hope  
Won't you take all of me  
Heal this dying soul  
  
I can feel my body breaking  
I can feel my body breaking  
I'm ready to let it all go  
I can feel my body shaking  
Right down to the foundation  
The root of it all  
  
Take all of me  
And the drive that keep burning deep inside  
Cast it all away  
And help to give me strength to face another day  
I am ready  
Help me be what I can be  
I am ready  
Come to me  
Take me away
