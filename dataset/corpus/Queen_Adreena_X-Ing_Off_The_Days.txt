(C. Gray)  
You walk all over anyone who dares to be a friend,  
Screen and yell because you deem them unenlightened,  
High upon your horse you preach and preach and preach,  
Love thy fellow humans all your filthy little creeps.  
X-ing off the days,  
X-ing off the days  
I nearly broke my back as I was handing back for you,  
Half the time was hell and half a waste of time,  
High upon your horse you preach and preach and preach,  
Love thy fellow humans all your filthy little creeps.  
X-ing off the days,  
X-ing off the days.  
I do not know the answer to the universe I fear,  
So drown me cold and go and find your perfect man my,  
Dear,  
High upon your horse you preach and preach and preach,  
Love thy fellow humans all your filthy little creeps,  
X-ing off the days,  
X-ing off the days.
