Well she was precious, like a flower  
She grew wild, wild but innocent  
A perfect prayer in a desperate hour  
She was everything beautiful and different  
Stupid boy, you can't fence that in  
Stupid boy, it's like holdin' back the wind  
  
She laid her heart and soul right in your hands  
And you stole her every dream, and you crushed her plans  
She never even knew she had a choice  
And that's what happens when the only voice she hears is telling her she can't  
Stupid boy  
Stupid boy  
  
So, what made you think you could take a life  
And just push it, push it around  
I guess to build yourself up so high  
You had to take her and break her down  
Well  
  
She laid her heart and soul right in your hands  
And you stole her every dream, and you crushed her plans  
She never even knew she had a choice  
And that's what happens when the only voice she hears is telling her she can't  
  
You stupid boy  
You always had to be right  
And now you lost the only thing that ever made you feel alive, oh ho  
Yeah, yeah  
  
She laid her heart and soul right in your hands, yeah  
And you stole her every dream and you crushed her plans, yes you did  
She never even knew she had a choice  
And that's what happens when the only voice she hears is telling her she can't  
  
You stupid boy  
Oh, I'm the same old, same old stupid boy  
It took a while for her to figure out she could run  
But when she did, she was long gone, long gone
