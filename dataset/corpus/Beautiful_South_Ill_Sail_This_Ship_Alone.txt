If, if you choose that we will always lose  
Well then I'll sail this ship alone  
And if, if you decide to give him another try  
Well then I'll sail this ship alone  
  
Well they said if I wrote the perfect love song  
You would take me back  
Well I wrote it but I lost it  
And now will you take me back anyway  
  
Now if, if you insist that this is for the best  
Well then I'll sail this ship alone  
And if, if you swear that you no longer care  
Well then I'll sail this ship alone  
  
I'll sail this ship alone  
Between the pain and the pleasure  
I'll sail this ship alone  
Amongst the sharks and the treasure  
If you would rather go your way then go your way  
I'll sail this ship alone  
  
If, if you're afraid that I won't make the grade  
Well then I'll sail this ship alone  
And if, if you agree to him instead of me  
Well then I'll sail this ship alone  
  
Well they said if I wrote the perfect letter  
That I would have a chance  
Well I wrote it, and you burnt it  
And now do I have a chance anyway  
  
If, if you swear that you no longer care  
Well then I'll sail this ship alone  
  
I'll sail this ship alone  
Between the pain and the pleasure  
I'll sail this ship alone  
Amongst the sharks and the treasure  
If you would rather go your way then go your way  
I'll sail this ship alone  
  
Well they said if I burnt myself alive  
That you'd come running back
