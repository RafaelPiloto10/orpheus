You know a dream is like a river  
Ever changin' as it flows  
And a dreamer's just a vessel  
That must follow where it goes  
Trying to learn from what's behind you  
And never knowing what's in store  
Makes each day a constant battle  
Just to stay between the shores  
And I will sail my vessel  
'Til the river runs dry  
Like a bird upon the wind  
These waters are my sky  
I'll never reach my destination  
If I never try  
So I will sail my vessel  
'Til the river runs dry  
Too many times we stand aside  
And let the waters slip away  
'Til what we put off 'til tomorrow  
It has now become today  
So don't you sit upon the shoreline  
And say you're satisfied  
Choose to chance the rapids  
And dare to dance that tide  
And I will sail my vessel  
'Til the river runs dry  
Like a bird upon the wind  
These waters are my sky  
I'll never reach my destination  
If I never try  
So I will sail my vessel  
'Til the river runs dry  
There's bound to be rough waters  
And I know I'll tke soome falls  
With the good Lord as my captain  
I can make it through them all  
And I will sail my vessel  
'Til the river runs dry  
Like a bird upon the wind  
These waters are my sky  
I'll never reach my destination  
If I never try  
So I will sail my vessel  
'Til the river runs dry  
Lord, I will sail my vessel  
'Til the river runs dry  
Yeah
