O I never asked to be your mountain  
I never asked to fly  
Remember when you came to me  
And told me of his lies  
You didn't understand my love  
You don't know why I try  
And the rain was falling on that day  
And damn the reason why  
  
The Flying Pisces sails for time  
And tells me of my child  
Wrapped in bitter tales and heartache  
He begs for just a smile  
O he never asked to be her mountain  
He never asked to fly  
And through his eye he comes his love  
And tells her not to cry  
  
She says, "Your scoundrel father flies  
With a dancer called a queen  
And with her stolen cards he plays  
And laughs, but never wins"  
O the child dreams to be his hands  
In the counting of the rain  
But only barren breasts he feels  
For her milk will never drain  
  
As I die I can't remember  
Where I saw the rain:  
Could it be that her laughter  
Drove me down again?  
Charming dancer will you stop,  
Stop and talk to me?  
Is there someone else you feel  
In your dreams? you will, you see:  
In midnight gazes  
I've found you far from me:  
If you lead me on  
Please leave me down  
  
O Flying Flying Fish  
Please flutter by my door:  
Yes you can drink my lies  
If first you read my eyes:  
Each one is titled  
"I'm drowning back to you":  
I can't swim your waters  
And you can't walk my lands:  
I'm sailing all my sins  
And I'm climbing all my fears  
And soon now I'll fly  
  
O I never asked to be your mountain  
I never asked to fly  
Remember when you came to me  
And told me of his lies  
You didn't understand my love  
You don't know why I try  
And the rain was falling on that day  
And that's the reason why  
  
Sweet lover, will you come back  
And love me for a while?  
Please take my hand  
Leave all your fears behind  
  
I've been gone too long  
Now I'm home to stay  
Please don't leave me  
Again this way  
  
Please come home
