Orange and yellow and purple and green  
The lights of the city at night set the scene  
Stumble through the bars of forget-me-not lane  
Sparkle through the glitter but don't show the pain  
  
In Hollywood  
Underneath a golden palm tree  
Hollywood  
Come to the party the drinks are on me  
For free  
  
Heartbeats echo through a cavern of love  
Come to the tavern I'll meet you up above  
Soaring through the heavens, what a fabulous ride  
But everybody's heading for the same place to hide  
  
In Hollywood  
Underneath a golden palm tree  
Hollywood  
Come to the party the drinks are on me  
For free  
  
The drink's on me  
For free  
The drink's on me  
For free  
The drink's on me [Repeat: x4]
