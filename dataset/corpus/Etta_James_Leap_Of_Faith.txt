After my baby quit me  
I wouldn't even go outside  
When my friends tried to fix me up  
I crawl under my bed and hide  
I knew I was never gonna change my look  
Till I got my [Incomprehensible] up to try  
And when I went ahead and spread my wings  
I found out that I could fly  
Sometime, all it takes is a leap of faith  
(Leap of faith)  
Sometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith  
(Leap of faith)  
I had no way of knowing  
What would come from our first kiss  
It scares me now to think about  
The good love that I might have missed  
I was just tryin' to find some help  
Tryin' to see myself as a survivor  
I had to rise up from the ashes of love  
And jump back into the fire  
Sometime, all it takes is a leap of faith, oh yeah  
(Leap of faith)  
Sometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith  
(Leap of faith)  
Sometimes, you gotto believe  
Before you see the proof  
You can wait a lifetime  
For one moment of truth  
Sometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith  
Yeah, oh yeah  
You gotto believe  
Before you see the proof  
You can wait a lifetime  
For one moment of truth  
Oh yeah, sometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith  
Sometimes, all it takes  
(Leap of faith)  
Sometimes, all it takes  
(Leap of faith)  
Sometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith, oh yes, it does  
(Leap of faith)  
Sometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith  
(Leap of faith)  
Oh, sometimes, all it takes  
(Leap of faith)  
Sometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith, oh yeah  
(Leap of faith)  
Sometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith, oh yes, it does  
Sometimes, all it takes is a leap of faith
