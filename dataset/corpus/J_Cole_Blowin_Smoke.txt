[Verse:]  
Blowing smoke, showing growth, no one's close  
Never mashing brakes on breakbeats or going broke ever  
Never, Rozay rich forever  
Learn how to take a punch can't be a bitch forever  
Cause it's gonna come, if not from a fight  
With that big ass bully nigga you never quite liked  
And just from life, knocking you on your ass  
Turning off all of your lights like Teddy Pendergrass  
Or mama on her last dollar, tryna stretch it  
Gotta pay electric, gotta pay the water  
Why she wanna a daughter when it's hard enough tryna raise two boys  
Back in the days, I would've hated on the new boys  
Just saying, cause the radio was just playing  
And I heard one of their songs and my nigga sang along  
And I'm thinking to myself, damn they came and went  
A couple singles but could never be the main event  
Without substance, something for them to grab on  
Wonder if niggas know they time is short and they won't last long  
I ain't even certain, one day they love you  
Next day they put the niggas you put on above you  
I let you niggas talk, it ain't no need to interrupt you  
Cause my album 'bout to be the biggest fuck you  
And don't worry, we'll let you back on the train  
Riding Jermaine, once you see these niggas not in my lane  
I pray to god end they reign  
I fucked a bitch I used to dream about  
And could've died when I came from disbelief  
Now I don't wish to speak on a name, that shit is weak  
We the new lost boys, shouts to Mr. Cheeks  
Shouts to Queens, getting money regiment with my getting money regime  
I'm a money machine, developing the routine, nah mean?  
  
[Outro:]  
Nah mean, nah mean?  
That was like a Jay Z drink  
Nah mean, Nah mean, nah mean, nah mean?  
You know how I used to say it  
Nah mean?  
B-are-are-ing, warm up
