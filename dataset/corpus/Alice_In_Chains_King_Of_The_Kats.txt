Hot leather and sex  
All the things that I dress in best  
Ain't no way you can beat  
The way I'm flyin fast on my feet  
I'm the king, I'm the king, I'm the king of the kats  
And I'm ready to roll  
I'm the king, I'm the king, I'm the king of the kats  
And baby that's a fact alright  
Quickest gun in the west  
There ain't no question that I'm the best  
Drinking till I die  
You're sick and skinny well so am I  
I'm the king, I'm the king, I'm the king of the kats  
And I'm ready to roll  
I'm the king, I'm the king, I'm the king of the kats  
And baby that's a fact alright  
(Look Out!)  
I'm the king, I'm the king, I'm the king of the kats  
And I'm ready to roll  
I'm the king, I'm the king, I'm the king of the kats  
And baby that's a fact alright  
Ooh, that's alright
