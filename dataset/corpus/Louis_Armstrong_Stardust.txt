Sometimes, I wonder why I spend  
Such lonely nights  
Oh baby, lonely nights  
  
Dreaming of a song  
The melody haunts my reverie  
And I am once again with you  
  
When our love was new, oh baby  
And each kiss an inspiration  
Now that, baby, you know was long ago  
  
Oh, beside a garden wall  
When stars are bright  
You are in my arms  
  
The nightingale tells his fairy tale  
A paradise where roses bloom  
Though I dream in vain  
  
In my heart it will remain, baby  
My stardust melody  
Oh memory, oh memory, oh memory
