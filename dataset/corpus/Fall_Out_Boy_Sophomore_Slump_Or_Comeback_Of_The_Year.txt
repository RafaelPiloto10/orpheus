[Chorus]  
Are we growing up or just going down  
It's just a matter of time until we're all found out  
Take our tears and put them on ice  
'Cause I swear I'd burn this city down to show you the light  
  
We're the therapists pumping through your speakers  
Delivering just what you need  
We're well read and poised  
We're the best boys  
We're the chemists who've found the formula  
To make your heart swell and burst  
No matter what they say, don't believe a word  
  
Cause I'll keep singing this lie if you'll keep believing it  
I'll keep singing this lie  
I'll keep singing this lie  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We're traveled like gypsies  
Only with worse luck and far less gold  
The kids you used to love  
But then we grew old  
We're the lifers here til the bitter end  
Condemned from the start  
Ashamed of the way  
The songs and the words own the beating of our hearts  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's a drug in the thermostat to warm the room up  
And another around to help us bend your trust  
I've got a sunset in my veins  
And I need to take a pill to make this town feel okay  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
The best part of "believe" is the "lie,"  
I hope you sing along and you steal a line  
I need to keep you like this in my mind  
So give in or just give up  
  
Are we growing up or just going down  
  
[Chorus]
