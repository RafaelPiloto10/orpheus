I'd like to say we gave it a try  
I'd like to blame it all on life  
Maybe we just weren't right,  
But that's a lie,  
That's a lie  
  
And we can deny it as much as we want  
But in time our feelings will show  
'Cause sooner or later, we'll wonder why we gave up  
The truth is everyone knows  
  
Almost  
Almost is never enough  
So close to being in love  
If I would have known that you wanted me  
The way I wanted you  
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart  
But right here in each others arms  
  
And we almost  
We almost knew what love was  
But almost is never enough  
  
If I could change the world overnight  
There'd be no such thing as goodbye  
You'll be standing right where you were  
And we'd get the chance we deserve  
  
Try to deny it as much as you want  
But in time our feelings will show  
'Cause sooner or later, we'll wonder why we gave up  
The truth is everyone knows  
  
Almost  
Almost is never enough  
So close to being in love  
If I would have known that you wanted me  
The way I wanted you, oh  
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart  
But right here in each others arms  
  
And we almost  
We almost knew what love was  
But almost is never enough

And we can deny it as much as we want

The truth is everyone knows
