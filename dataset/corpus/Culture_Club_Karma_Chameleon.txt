Desert loving in your eyes all the way.  
If I listen to your lies,  
Would you say I'm a man without conviction,  
I'm a man who doesn't know  
How to sell a contradiction?  
You come and go, you come and go.  
  
Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma, chameleon,  
You come and go, you come and go.  
Loving would be easy if your colours were like my dreams:  
Red, gold, and green, red, gold, and green.  
  
Didn't you hear your wicked words ever'y day.  
And you used to be so sweet.  
I heard you say that my love was an addiction.  
When we cling, our love is strong.  
When you go, you're gone forever.  
You string along, you string along.  
  
Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma, chameleon,  
You come and go, you come and go.  
Loving would be easy if your colours were like my dreams:  
Red, gold, and green, red, gold, and green.  
  
Ev'ry day is like survival.  
You're my lover, not my rival.
