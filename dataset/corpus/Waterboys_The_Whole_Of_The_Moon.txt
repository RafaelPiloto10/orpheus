I pictured a rainbow  
You held it in your hands  
I had flashes  
But you saw the plan  
I wandered out in the world for years  
While you just stayed in your room  
I saw the crescent  
You saw the whole of the moon  
The whole of the moon  
  
You were there in the turnstiles  
With the wind at your heels  
You stretched for the stars  
And you know how it feels  
To reach too high  
Too far  
Too soon  
You saw the whole of the moon  
  
I was grounded  
While you filled the skies  
I was dumbfounded by truth  
You cut through lies  
  
I saw the rain dirty valley  
You saw Brigadoon  
I saw the crescent  
You saw the whole of the moon!  
  
I spoke about wings  
You just flew  
I wondered I guessed and I tried  
You just knew  
I sighed  
... but you swooned!  
I saw the crescent  
You saw the whole of the moon  
The whole of the moon!  
  
With a torch in your pocket  
And the wind at your heels  
You climbed on the ladder  
And you know how it feels  
To get too high  
Too far  
Too soon  
You saw the whole of the moon  
The whole of the moon!  
  
Unicorns and cannonballs  
Palaces and piers  
Trumpets towers and tenements  
Wide oceans full of tears  
Flags rags ferryboats  
Scimitars and scarves  
Every precious dream and vision  
Underneath the stars  
  
Yes you climbed on the ladder  
With the wind in your sails  
You came like a comet  
Blazing your trail  
Too high  
Too far  
Too soon  
You saw the whole of the moon
