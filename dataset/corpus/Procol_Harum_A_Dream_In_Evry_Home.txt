Remember when you felt it first?  
The bitter taste of love  
The hand that reached inside your purse  
The fist inside the glove  
Remember how it felt to be  
The only one who cared  
You peeked behind the open door  
The bride is always bared  
  
You always knew this day would come  
You lie in bed alone  
The TV flickers silently  
A dream in every home (early mixes exist in which Gary sings 'A dream without
a home')  
  
Remember when you felt it first?  
When you played kiss and tell  
The moment that the arrow pierced  
The pearl inside the shell  
Remember how good it felt to be?  
To really come alive  
You peeked behind the open door  
The secrets of the hive
