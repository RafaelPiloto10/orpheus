There you go now baby  
Here am I well you  
Left me here so I could  
Sit and cry  
Golly gee what have you  
Done to me  
Well I guess it doesn't matter anymore  
  
Do you remember baby  
Last September, how you  
Held me tight  
Each and every night  
Ooh how you  
Drove me crazy  
Well I guess it doesn't matter anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
There's no use in me a cryin' and I've  
Done everything and now I'm sick of tryin'  
I've thrown away my nights  
Wasted all my days over you  
  
Now you go your way baby  
And I'll go mine  
Now and forever  
'Til the end of time  
Well I find somebody new baby  
We'll say we're through  
And you won't matter anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now you go your way baby  
And I'll go mine  
Now and forever  
'Til the end of time  
Well I find somebody new baby  
We'll say we're through  
And you won't matter anymore  
  
You won't matter anymore  
You won't matter anymore
