Clouds open dust and waves rise up to  
Obscure God's very blue sky.  
People skating ginger(ly), only endure  
Lines of shopping mothers grabbing the kids  
Pushing upto the front  
Rows of pretty little house and lawns  
I want you to have a beautiful one.  
Moving in circles out on the freeway  
Coming and going to everyday, everyday  
Moving in circles out on the freeway  
Coming and going to everyday, everyday  
Got a brand new car with hideaway lights  
And a blue racing stripe  
Costs a little extra but its worth it to me  
When money burns through the exhaust pipe  
I'd like to take you on a quick spin sometime  
To show you what its got  
I can't believe you chose to work in the line  
I'm so glad that I'm not  
Everyday and everyway  
Everyday and everyway  
Everyday and everyway
