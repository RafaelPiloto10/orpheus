Diamonds and dust  
(home at last) Poor man last, rich man first  
Lamborghini's, caviar  
Dry martinis, Shangri-la  
I got a burning feeling  
Deep inside of me  
It's yearning  
But I'm going to set it free  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm going in to sin city  
I'm gonna win in sin city  
Where the lights are bright  
Do the town tonight  
I'm gonna win in sin city  
  
(I'm gonna rule you baby)  
Ladders and snakes  
Ladders give, snakes take  
Rich man, poor man, beggarman, thief  
Ain't got a hope in hell, that's my belief  
  
Fingers Freddy, Diamond Jim  
They're getting ready, (Better get ready,)  
Look out I'm coming in ('cause I'm coming in)  
So spin that wheel, cut that pack  
And roll those loaded dice  
Bring on the dancing girls  
And put the champagne on ice
