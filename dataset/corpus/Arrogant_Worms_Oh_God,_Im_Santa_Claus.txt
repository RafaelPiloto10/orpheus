Open my eyes, what a beautiful day  
Just the type that makes me want to say hooray  
I'm still a little fuzzy-headed from my sleep  
Into my brain reality seeps  
Look all around me, can't believe what I see  
These little short people are surrounding me  
I've got a white beard, a suit made of red  
My soul becomes filled with a keen sense of dread  
  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
  
Hop out of bed, kick an elf in the chest  
What an awful way to awake from a rest  
"Santa, oh, Santa," the little gnomes cheer  
"You shouldn't be nasty at this time of year!"  
"What do you mean?" I say in a rage  
"And what are you doing with those big burlap bags?"  
The elves they do roar, "Why their full of toys  
For you to deliver to the good girls and boys. "  
  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
  
Resigned to my fate, I load up the sleigh  
Harness the reindeer and get under way  
It's nippy up here in the cool arctic sky  
Good thing I remembered that bottle of rye  
Flying over rooftops, throwing out toys  
Hopefully crushing those good girls and boys  
Like a bad dream, I pray for release  
Please let this hellish existence be ceased!  
  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
  
From this nightmare I finally awake  
My brain is on fire, my hands they do shake  
But wait, they're not hands, they're cute little paws  
I'm the Easter Bunny, I'm not Santa Claus!  
  
Oh God, I'm the Easter Bunny  
Oh God, I 'm Easter Bunny  
Oh God, I'm Easter Bunny  
Oh God, I'm Easter Bunny
