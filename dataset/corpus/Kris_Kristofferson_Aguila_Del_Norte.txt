Did anybody see them ?  
I heard there was a baby  
Somebody heard her crying  
Weaker through the night  
They beat her mama bloody  
And shot her with her daddy  
It was the terror from above  
El aguila del norte  
  
Down in nicaragua  
Running from the shadows  
Striking holy terror  
Deeper in the heart  
You believe in freedom  
And you believe in justice  
But not in nicaragua  
Not in nicaragua  
  
Aguila del norte  
We can see your power  
And the beauty of your freedom  
What is in your heart ?  
You believe in honor  
And you believe in jesus  
But not in nicaragua  
Not in nicaragua
