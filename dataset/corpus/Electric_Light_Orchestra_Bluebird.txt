The streets, the signs are pointing all one way  
But you don't realize just what they say  
You may fight, you may run, you may know what you've done  
It makes me feel so sad to think what I might've had  
I watch the stars, I watch the sun, now I watch for anyone  
But it's only make believe  
  
You work, you work, you work so hard and then  
Someone, someone will come around again  
You may think it's for real, but you know how you feel  
The places that I go don't feel good anymore  
I see it all rainbows in fall I see her face upon my wall  
But it's only make believe  
  
Fly away, bluebird fly away for me  
To a place somewhere far across the sea  
Fly away, far away, don't look back, go today  
The waves that crash upon the sand  
Another place, a far off land  
And every day, I have to stay, but you are free  
You could fly away  
But it's only make believe
