I'm living on an endless road  
Around the world for rock and roll  
Sometimes it feels so tough  
But I still ain't had enough  
I keep saying that it's getting too much  
But I know I'm a liar  
Feeling all right in the noise and the light  
But that's what lights my fire  
Hellraiser, in the thunder and heat  
Hellraiser, rock you back in your seat  
Hellraiser, and I'll make it come true  
Hellraiser, I'll put a spell on you  
Walking out on another stage  
Another town, another place  
Sometimes I don't feel right  
Nerves wound up too damn tight  
People keep telling me it's bad for my health  
But kicking back don't make it  
Out of control, I play the ultimate role  
But that's what lights my fire  
  
I'm living on an endless road  
Around the world for rock and roll  
Sometimes it feels so tough  
But I still ain't had enough  
Feeling all right in the noise and the light  
But that's what lights my fire
