Amor, amor, amor, this word so sweet that I repeat means "I adore you"  
Amor, amor, my love, would you deny this heart that I have placed before you?  
I can't find another word with meaning so clear  
My lips try to whisper sweeter things in your ear  
But somehow or other nothing sounds quite so dear  
As this soft caressing word I know  
Amor, amor, my love, when you're away there is no day and nights are lonely  
Amor, amor, my love, make life divine, say you'll be mine, and love me only  
I can't find another word with meaning so clear

Amor, amor, my love, when you're away there is no day and nights are lonely  
Amor, amor, my love, make life divine, say you'll be mine, and love me only
