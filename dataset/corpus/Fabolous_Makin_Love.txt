Ay man some kids gonna be runnin' around somebody house to this one  
They gon' make babies to this  
I mean it feels good  
Oh yeah the song to (yeah)

I told her I'll be there in a minute,  
She knew I'm a take it down soon as I get it,  
You can leave your hair in a mess, don't even get dressed  
Tonight we makin' love  
I told her lets stay home, she was with it  
She know I'm a take it down soon as I get it,  
You can leave your hair in a mess, don't even get dressed  
Tonight we makin' love makin' love  
  
June twenty second, think I came in twenty second  
I was watching honey peck it while she lay on tummy naked,  
To the pace of the base and this cash money record,  
She just drop, drop, drop, damn you manny fresh  
But I got my thing together, told her she could bring whatever  
Get some green, we could puff get the cream get the cuffs  
Baby even when I'm gentle, it might seem like its ruff  
But if neighbors ain't complaining, you ain't screaming enough  
And yeah they might hear as I'm slappin' to the jewel  
She said baby right there, do it rapid do it smooth  
I said baby right where, kept tappin' to the groove  
She said nigga right there, I'm a slap you if you move  
  
I told her I'll be there in a minute,  
She knew I'm a take it down soon as I get it,  
You can leave your hair in a mess, don't even get dressed  
Tonight we makin' love  
I told her lets stay home, she was with it  
She know I'm a take it down soon as I get it,  
You can leave your hair in a mess, don't even get dressed  
Tonight we makin' love, girl we makin' love  
  
Cant forget the feeling when you starring at the ceiling  
And you cant catch your breath you just laying there chilling  
Like one and then the two,  
Two and then the three, three and then the four  
Damn I want some more  
So I slam her to the floor, set the camera to record  
Throw them legs up in the air, just like Lamborghini doors  
See we might have had some problems with the stamina before  
I'm no amateur I'm sure, I cold ram until your sore  
But I ain't trying to hurt ya  
I'm jus' trying to nurture  
Them nigga just flirt to hit it and to hurt ya  
What I'm throwin' dirt for, I'm trying to alert ya  
But fuck that lay it down, let a nigga work ya  
  
I told her I'll be there in a minute,  
She knew I'm a take it down soon as I get it,  
You can leave your hair in a mess, don't even get dressed  
Tonight we makin' love  
I told her lets stay home, she was with it  
She know I'm a take it down soon as I get it,  
You can leave your hair in a mess, don't even get dressed  
Tonight we makin' love makin' love  
  
Uh huh til you tell me that you had enough  
Uh huh I'm a slow it down and I'm a speed it up (yeah)  
And I will not stop  
Do it to you like a dude that ain't got no job  
I ain't got nowhere to be so I don't gotta leave  
Get the itis in the sheets I'm a eat and go to sleep  
Then we wake up and repeat, everything you do to me  
I'm a turn and do to you,  
And then I'm a black and blue that thing (dance for me)  
I love the way you move that thing (so nasty)  
I look and say oh that thing  
Make me wanna sing a song (anybody every seen a)  
Make 'em wanna sing along  
  
So listen baby I'll be there in a minute,  
She knew I'm a take it down soon as I get it,  
You can leave your hair in a mess, don't even get dressed  
Tonight we makin' love  
I told her lets stay home, she was with it  
She know I'm a take it down soon as I get it,  
You can leave your hair in a mess, don't even get dressed  
Tonight we makin' love makin' love
