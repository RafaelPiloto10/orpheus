Oh baby oh would I lie to you??  
Look into my eyes  
Can't you see they're open wide  
Would I lie to you??  
  
Chorus:  
Look into my eyes  
Can't you see they're open wide  
Would I lie to you baby??  
Would I lie to you??... Oh yeah  
Don't you know it's true  
Girl there's no-one else but you  
Would I lie to you baby??  
Would I lie to you??  
  
Everybody wants to know the truth  
In my arms is the only proof  
I've hidden my heart behind the bedroom door  
Now it's open I can't do no more  
I'm telling you baby...  
You will never find another girl in this heart of mine  
  
Chorus:  
Look into my eyes  
Can't you see they're open wide  
Would I lie to you baby??  
Would I lie to you??... Oh yeah  
Don't you know it's true  
Girl there's no-one else but you  
Would I lie to you baby??  
Would I lie to you??  
  
Everybody's got their history  
On every page - a mystery  
You can read my diary you're in every line  
Jealous mind never satisfied  
I'm telling you baby...  
You will never find another girl in this heart of mine  
  
Look into my eyes  
Can't you see they're open wide  
Would I lie to you baby??  
Would I lie to you??... Oh yeah  
Don't you know it's true  
Girl there's no-one else but you  
Would I lie to you baby??  
Would I lie to you??  
  
When you wanna see me night and day (would I lie??)  
If I tell you that I'm here to stay (would I lie to you??)  
Do you think I give my love away?? (would I lie??)  
That's not the kind of game I play  
I'm telling you baby...  
You will never find another girl in this heart of mine  
  
Chorus:  
Look into my eyes  
Can't you see they're open wide  
Would I lie to you baby??  
Would I lie to you??... Oh yeah  
Don't you know it's true  
Girl there's no-one else but you  
Would I lie to you baby??  
Would I lie to you??  
(X 2)  
  
Trust me baby  
Hey aint no-one else but you child  
Come on, Come on, Come on...  
Trust me baby  
I wouldn't lie to you baby
