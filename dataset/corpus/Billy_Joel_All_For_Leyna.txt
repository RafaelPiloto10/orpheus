She stood on the tracks  
Waving her arms  
Leading me to that third rail SHOCK  
Quick as a wink  
She changed her mind.  
She gave me a night  
That's all it was  
What will it take until I STOP  
Kidding myself, wasting my time, whoa  
There's nothing else I can do  
'Cause I'm doing it all for Leyna  
I don't want anyone new  
'Cause I'm living it all for Leyna  
There?s nothing in it for you  
'Cause I'm giving it all to Leyna  
We laid on the beach  
Watching the tide  
She didn't tell me there were ROCKS  
Under the waves  
Right off the shore.  
Washed up on the sand  
Barely alive  
Wishing the undertow would STOP  
How can a man take anymore, whoa  
There's nothing else I can do  
'Cause I'm doing it all for Leyna.  
I don't want anyone new  
'Cause I'm living it all for Leyna.  
There's nothing in it for you  
'Cause I'm giving it all to Leyna.  
I'm failing in school  
Losing my friends  
Making my family lose their minds  
I don't want to eat  
I don't want to sleep  
I only want Leyna, one more time.  
Now, I'm in my room  
Watching the tube  
Telling myself, she still may DROP  
Over to say, she's changed her mind  
So, I wait in the dark  
Listening for her  
Instead of hearing my old man saying STOP  
Kidding yourself, wasting your time.  
There's nothing else I can do  
'Cause I'm doing it all for Leyna  
I don't want anyone new  
'Cause I'm living it all for Leyna  
There's nothing in it for you  
'Cause I'm giving it all to Leyna  
  
All For Leyna  
All For Leyna  
All For Leyna  
All For Leyna  
All For Leyna  
All For Leyna
