When the truth is found to be lies  
And all the joys within you dies  
Don't you want somebody to love  
Don't you need somebody to love  
Wouldn't you love somebody to love  
You better find somebody to love  
  
When the garden flowers baby are dead yes  
And your mind is full of red  
Don't you want somebody to love  
Don't you need somebody to love  
Wouldn't you love somebody to love  
You better find somebody to love  
  
Your eyes, I say your eyes may look like his  
But in your head baby I'm afraid you don't know where it is  
Don't you want somebody to love  
Don't you need somebody to love  
Wouldn't you love somebody to love  
You better find somebody to love  
  
Tears are running ah running down your breast  
And your friends baby they treat you like a guest  
Don't you want somebody to love  
Don't you need somebody to love  
Wouldn't you love somebody to love  
You better find somebody to love
