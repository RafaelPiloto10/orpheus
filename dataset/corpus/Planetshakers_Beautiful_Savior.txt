Jesus, Beautiful Savior,  
God of all majesty, risen king.  
  
Lamb of God, holy and righteous,  
Blessed redeemer, bright morning star.  
  
All the heavens shout your praise,  
All creation bow to worship you  
  
How wonderful, How beautiful,  
Name above every name, exalted high,  
How wonderful, How beautiful,  
Jesus your name,  
Name above every name,  
Jesus.  
  
I will sing forever,  
Jesus I love you,  
Jesus I love you.
