Ah, never thought it could happen to me,  
But it did, now look at me,  
I'm alone, standing in my cell,  
Staring at the wall, living in hell.  
  
All of my life I never said when,  
I did it again and again,  
Breaking, smashing, and stealing  
I never knew when to quit.  
  
I turned 18, I should've stopped,  
Thought I'd never get caught,  
But I did, I got caught,  
Now I feel pretty stupid  
Fuck!  
  
I'm shitting bricks  
I'm shitting bricks  
I'm shitting bricks  
I'm shitting bricks by the dozen,  
I'm shitting bricks  
I'm shitting bricks  
  
Mom's rules  
Why can't I do what I want  
Why must I do what my parents want?  
  
I gotta live by mom's rules  
I gotta live by mom's rules  
I gotta live by mom's rules  
I gotta live by mom's rules  
I gotta live by mom's rules yeah!
