She takes  
Just like a woman  
Yes she does  
And she makes love  
Just like a woman  
And she aches  
Just like a woman  
But she breaks  
Like a little girl  
  
Nobody feels any pain  
Tonight as I stand inside the rain  
Everybody knows  
That baby's got new clothes  
Lately I see her ribbons and her bows  
And the problems  
From her curls  
  
She takes  
Just like a woman  
Yes she does  
And she makes love  
Just like a woman  
And she aches  
Just like a woman  
And she breaks  
Like a little girl  
  
It was raining from the first  
Everybody knows I was dying of thirst  
So I came here  
Long time's curse  
And what's worse  
Is this pain in here  
I can't stay in here  
Ain't it clear  
Ain't it clear  
  
I must admit  
I believe it's time for us to quit  
And when we meet again  
Bein' introduced as friends  
Please don't let on  
That you knew me when  
I was hungry  
And it was your world  
  
I take  
Just like a woman  
Yes I do  
And I make love  
Just like a woman  
And I ache  
Just like a woman  
But I break  
Just like a little girl...
