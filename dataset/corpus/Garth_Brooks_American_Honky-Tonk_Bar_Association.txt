If your paycheck depends on  
The weather and the clock  
If your conversation calls for  
A little more than a coffee pot  
If you need to pour your heart out  
And try to rectify some situation  
That you're facing  
Contact your American Honky-Tonk Bar Association  
  
When Uncle Sam dips  
In your pocket  
For most things you don't mind  
But when your dollar  
Goes to all of those  
Standing in a welfare line  
Well rejoice you have a voice  
If you're concerned  
About the destination  
Of this great nation  
It's called the American Honky-Tonk Bar Association  
  
It represents the hardhat  
Gunrack, achin'-back  
Over taxed, flag-wavin',  
Fun-lovin' crowd  
Their heart is in the music  
And they love to play it loud  
There's no forms or applications  
There's no red tape administrations  
It's the American Honky-Tonk Bar Association  
  
We're all one big family  
Throughout the cities  
And the towns  
We don't reach for handouts  
We reach for those  
Who are down  
And every local chapter  
Has a seven day a week  
Available consultation  
For your frustration  
It's called the American Honky-Tonk Bar Association  
  
It represents the mud flap  
Six pack, beer crack  
Over-taxed, flag-wavin'  
Fun-lovin' crowd  
Their heart is in the music  
And they love to play it loud  
There's no forms or applications  
There's no red tape administrations  
It's the American Honky-Tonk Bar Association
