Once I built a railroad, made it run  
Made it race against time  
Once I built a railroad, now it's done  
Brother, can you spare a dime  
  
Once I built a tower, to the sun  
Bricks, rivet, and lime  
Once I built a tower, now it's done  
Brother, can you spare a dime  
  
Once in cocky suits  
Gee, we looked swell  
Full of that Yankee Doodle-dom  
Half a million boots, they went  
Slogging through Hell  
And I, I was a kid with a drum  
  
Say, don't you remember  
They called me Al  
It was Al all the time  
Say, don't you remember  
I'm your pal  
Buddy, can you spare a dime
