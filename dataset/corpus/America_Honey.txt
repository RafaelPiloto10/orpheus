Honey, I wish you were here  
To brighten my lonely nights  
How long I've waited  
To hold you in my arms again  
  
Honey, you know I'm so scared  
Scared that you might not come back  
One day without you  
Is one day too long for me  
Wish you could see  
The love in the heart of me  
  
Honey, I really miss you  
Honey, I need to kiss you  
Honey, I want to hold you  
Honey, have I told you  
I really need you now  
I really need you now  
  
Honey, you know you think like me  
Now I pray every day  
I'll do anything  
If there's a chance you'll stay  
  
Your perfume is still in my room  
Your pillow it's left where you lay  
Your picture is standing  
Inside the frame I made  
It seems so sad  
To lose the love we had  
  
Honey, I really miss you  
Honey, I need to kiss you  
Honey, I want to hold you  
Honey, have I told you  
I really need you now  
I really need you now  
  
Honey, I've waited for only one line  
To let me know how you are  
I need to be with you  
I'd run to your side, however near or far  
Girl, I need you  
  
Honey, honey  
Honey, honey  
Honey, I really miss you  
Honey, I need to kiss you  
Honey, don't you know it  
Honey, don't I show it  
I really need you now  
I really need you now  
I really need you now  
I really need you now  
I really need you now  
I really need you now
