Yeah, yeah  
Oh it's a love thing  
  
I been working all day long  
And I'm ready to come on home to you, mm mm  
All the other guys roll their eyes  
And don't realize it's what I want to do  
It's what I want to do  
They say I'm wrapped around your finger  
But they don't understand  
That what we got is more than just a diamond  
On your hand  
  
Baby it's a love thing, whoa  
Baby it's a love thing, yeah  
  
Sure I could hang around and complain about  
The way things ought to be  
Yeah there's trouble in the world  
But you're the girl  
Whose open arms are all I really need  
And that's why I come runnin'  
To be there by your side  
To let 'em call me crazy  
But it can't be denied  
  
Baby it's a love thing, whoa  
Ah baby it's a love thing, yeah  
  
And it's not about the same last name  
It's not a thing that can be explained  
It's how you make me feel inside  
And the way you hold me every night  
  
It's a love thing, whoa  
Oh baby, it's a love thing, yeah  
  
Here we go now  
It's a love thing  
  
They say I'm wrapped around your finger  
But they don't understand  
That what we got is more than just a diamond  
On your hand  
Baby it's a love thing, whoa  
Oh baby it's a love thing, yeah  
Come on it's a love thing, whoa  
Oh baby, It's a love thing, yeah  
Oh, it's a love thing, whoa  
Oh sugar, it's a love thing  
No it ain't about no diamond ring  
It's a love thing, whoa  
Oh baby it's a love thing,  
It's a love, it's a love, it's a love thing
