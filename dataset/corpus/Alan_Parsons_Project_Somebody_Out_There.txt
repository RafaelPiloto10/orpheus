Maybe I'm imagining the things they say about me  
Maybe there is really nothing there at all  
Standing in the middle while the rumours fly around me  
Hiding from a shadow on an empty wall  
  
When my back is turned he's up to something else  
And I must not stop believing in myself  
Am I dreaming will the nightmare just go on  
And never end  
  
Somebody out there, says that he's you  
Somebody out there, talks like you do  
He calls up your number  
And you can't get through somebody out there  
  
Wish that I could run away and leave it all behind me  
Wish I wasn't hurt by all the things they say  
If I didn't need to know the simple truth about me  
Wouldn't it be easier to walk away  
  
And I don't need more confusion in my life  
No more pain and disillusion in my life  
If I'm dreaming will the nightmare just go on  
And never end  
  
Somebody out there, using your name  
Somebody out there, you get the blame  
There's doubt and suspicion  
It's hard to explain somebody out there  
  
And I don't need more confusion in my life  
No more pain and disillusion in my life  
If I'm dreaming will the nightmare just go on  
And never end  
  
Somebody out there, stolen your base  
Somebody out there, parked in your space  
You've no reservation, he's taken your place  
Somebody out there, wasting your time  
Somebody out there, using your dime  
Your friends think you're crazy  
They're way out of line  
Somebody out there, says that he's you  
Somebody out there, thinks like you do  
You stare at the mirror  
You're looking into  
Somebody out there
