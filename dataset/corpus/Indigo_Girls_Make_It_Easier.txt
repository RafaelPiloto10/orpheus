I'm in search of greener pastures  
Don't like my garden's what I said  
Although I'm working harder than last year  
I'm still deep in the red  
I am rowing as hard as I can  
And they're selling me up a stream  
I'm always one more step away  
From the american dream  
  
I got a chip on my shoulder  
About the size of a mental block  
I've got someone on the telephone  
Trying to sell me a future in stock  
Maybe I work too hard to be happy  
And I should practice letting go  
But it's hard not to rock the boat  
When you're sailing against the undertow  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to slide into the black  
And wear the black mask  
I might not get what I lack  
But it doesn't hurt to ask  
If I want to sail  
I need my life to be breezier  
I said please god or someone  
Make it easier  
  
I went to Sunday school every Sunday  
Swallowed the bait and I got the hook  
When I needed something someday  
I would read the good book  
Tell me what does it take to get ahead  
Sometimes I know I'd sell my soul  
When it looks like everybody else is flying  
And I'm crawling in the hole  
  
Well maybe if I open my own business  
Maybe if I buy a lottery ticket  
Someone tell me what is the secret  
To getting out of the thicket  
Give me more than just a sample  
I need a whole lot of glory  
My life become an example  
Of the american success story  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Make it easier  
Make it easier
