Mother nature's been good to me  
That's why I'm sittin' in this cherry tree  
But it's alright, it's alright  
It's not so bad  
I'm just a touch away  
  
The shady lady  
From shady lane  
Is lying in my bed again  
And it's alright  
It feels good  
It's not so bad  
When she's just a touch away  
  
Nothing much  
Is all I ask  
And it's alright, OK yes  
Light as a feather, oh yes  
  
Like a rosebud  
When the sun is high  
She opens up  
Before my eyes  
And the light falls  
On her wet skin  
It's alright  
I'm just a touch away  
  
Nothing much  
Is all I know  
And it's alright, oh yes  
Light as a feather,  
And just a touch away  
  
Put a finger to her lips again  
She cries with pleasure  
Cries with pain  
And it's alright  
It feels good  
It's not so bad  
We're just a touch away  
  
Nothing much  
Is all I know  
Not too fast  
Not too slow  
And it's alright  
Soft as a feather  
And just a touch away
