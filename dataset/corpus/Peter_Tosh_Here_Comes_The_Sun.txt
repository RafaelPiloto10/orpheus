Little darling,  
It's been a long, long lonely winter  
Little darling,  
It seems like years since it's been here  
  
Here comes the sun  
Here comes the sun and I say  
It's all right  
  
Little darling,  
The smiles are returning to their places  
Little darling,  
It seems like years since they've been there  
  
But here comes the sun  
Here comes the sun and I say  
It's all right  
  
Little darling,  
I see the ice is slowly melting  
Little darling,  
It seems like years since they've been there  
  
And here comes the sun  
There goes the snow and I say  
It's all right  
It's all right  
  
I see the ice is slowly melting  
Little darling,  
It seems like years since they've been there  
  
Here comes the sun  
There goes the snow and I say  
It's all right  
It's all right  
  
Little darling,  
The smiles are returning to their places  
Little darling,  
It seems like years since they've been there  
  
Here comes the sun  
I said here comes the sun and I say  
It's all right
