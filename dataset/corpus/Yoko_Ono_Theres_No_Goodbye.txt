Made up my mind to say goodbye,  
Went to the park for the last time.  
But when I saw your eyes,  
I knew for the first time,  
That there's no goodbye between us.  
  
There's no goodbye,  
There's no goodbye,  
There's no goodbye between us.  
  
If one day we slip away,  
And that may be in the cards,  
We will know deep in our hearts  
That there's no goodbye between us.  
  
There's no goodbye,  
There's no goodbye,  
There's no goodbye between us.  
  
There's no goodbye,  
There's no goodbye,  
There's no goodbye between us.
