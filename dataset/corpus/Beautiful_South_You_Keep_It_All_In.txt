You know your problem  
You keep it all in  
You know your problem  
You keep it all in  
  
That's right  
The conversation we had last night  
When all I wanted to do was  
Knife you in the heart  
I kept it all in  
  
You know your problem  
You keep it all in  
You know your problem  
You keep it all in  
  
Midnight, a husband getting ready to fight  
A daughter sleeps alone with the light  
Turned on, she bears but  
Keeps it all in  
  
Just like that murder in '73  
Just like that robbery in '62  
With all there things that have happened to me  
I kept it all in  
Why do you keep on telling me now  
  
You know your problem  
You keep it all in  
You know your problem  
You keep it all in  
  
That's sweet  
That conversation we had last week  
When you gagged and bound me up to my seat  
You're right, I do  
I keep it all in
