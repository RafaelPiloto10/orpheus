I'll send away all my false pride  
And I'll forsake all of my life  
Yes I'll be as true as true can be  
If you'll come and stay with me.  
  
Lovers of the past I'll leave behind  
There'll never be another on my mind  
I'll do all I can so you'll feel free  
If you come and stay with me  
  
The promises I made most faithfully  
I'll keep them still should you decide to leave  
I'll try and see that you have all you need  
If you'll come and stay with me  
  
We'll live a life no one has ever known  
But I know you're thinking that I'm hardly grown  
I'll do all I can so you'll feel free  
If you'll come and stay with me.  
  
But oh thank God at last and finally  
I could see you're gonna stay with me
