Heart breaker soul shaker  
I've been told about you  
Steamroller midnight shoulder  
What they been saying must be true  
  
Red hot mama  
Velvet charmer  
Time's come to pay your dues  
  
[Chorus]  
Now you're messin' with a  
Son of a bitch  
Now your messin' with a  
Son of a bitch  
Now your messin' with a  
Son of a bitch  
Now your messin' with a  
Son of a bitch  
  
Talkin' jivey poison ivy  
You ain't gonna cling to me  
Man taker bone faker  
I ain't so blind I can't see  
  
Red hot mama  
Down light charmer  
Time's come to pay your dues  
  
[Chorus: x4]
