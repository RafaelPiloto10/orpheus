We got bruised wrists, kick flips, sending an invasion  
They say loose flips, sink ships, so might get your probation  
No more teeth, six in the mix, ripping' round rotation  
Chuck E. Cheese chips or kung fu kicks, just a kids sensation  
So turn the radio on, press one for rock  
Got a cuff to get off, what's done is done  
Turn the radio on, it's never enough  
I wanna change it all, I want it all  
But you can't always get what you want  
You can't always get what you want  
Give up, give up, give up, the dream is over  
We lost the moment, now we're running sober  
Give up, give up, give up, don't even bother  
Can't get what we want  
Give up, give up, give up, the dream is over  
We're going slow and dropping on their shoulder  
Give up, give up, give up, don't even bother  
We'll never get what we want  
Hey, hey, hey  
Hey, hey, hey  
Hey, hey, hey  
We want star ships, banana clips and start a hip religion  
And a postscript recensionship to help them find a vision  
But the bad pray for double play and move with pre-precision  
And like arsenic, we're getting sick of all our indecision  
So turn the radio on, press one for rock  
Got a cuff to get off, what's done is done  
Turn the radio on, it's never enough  
I wanna change it all, I want it all  
But you can't always get what you want  
You can't always get what you want  
Give up, give up, give up, the dream is over  
We lost the moment, now we're running sober  
Give up, give up, give up, don't even bother  
Can't get what we want  
Give up, give up, give up, the dream is over  
We're going slow and dropping on their shoulder  
Give up, give up, give up, don't even bother  
We'll never get what we want  
Hey, hey, hey  
It's like working on the pieces when the puzzle doesn't fit  
It's like the feeling that you get right before you get hit  
It's like the ground opened up and swallowed you when you sit  
It's like, be careful what you have 'cause now you got shit  
It's like, you can't always get what you want  
Opened up and swallowed you  
You can't always get what you want  
It's like a time bomb  
You can't always get what you want  
Opened up and swallowed you  
You can't always get what you want  
Give up, give up, give up, the dream is over  
We lost the moment, now we're running sober  
Give up, give up, give up, don't even bother  
Can't get what we want  
Give up, give up, give up, the dream is over  
We're going slow and dropping on their shoulder  
Give up, give up, give up, don't even bother  
We'll never get what we want  
Hey, hey, hey  
Hey, hey, hey  
Hey, hey, hey
