Let me put it this way doll  
And I know it's getting late  
I can tell from the planes of your face  
That you're from out of state  
But here in the willows now here's the deal  
Tomorrow's for squares, tonight's for real  
  
Drop me off in Groovetime  
Do you hear the slang of ages  
Show me how it's done  
  
Now did you say you were from the Netherlands  
Or was that "Netherworld"?  
If you grew up in Amsterdam  
Then I'm the Duke of Earl  
These tabs look iffy, you say they're good  
Let's roll with the homeys - knock on wood  
  
Drop me off in Groovetime  
Soothe me with the Slang of Ages  
Show me where I turn  
  
Are you all part of the Dreaming  
Or the end of my life so far?  
Or something half way in between  
You oughta know  
Hey, where'd she go?  
  
Damn, she skipped dimensions  
Was it something that I said?  
Or something I was thinking  
When she opened up my head?  
Let me make it right baby, never mind how  
There's a crazy little place I know called "Be There Now"  
  
Drop me off in Groovetime  
Do you hear the slang of ages  
Show me how it's done  
Drop me off in Groovetime  
Soothe me with the slang of ages  
This is where I turn
