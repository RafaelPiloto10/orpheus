It wasn't me that saw you standing by the neon-lit door  
It wasn't me that saw you clinging to somebody I deplore  
Baby, don't show your face, don't move in my direction  
Leave me to bleed  
Your love, love can be fatal  
Leave me to bleed  
Your love, love can be fatal  
It wasn't me that heard you whisper a name I'd never heard before  
It wasn't me that heard you steal out to meet behind a secret door  
I've been suspecting, I've done my own detecting  
Leave me to bleed  
Your love, love can be fatal  
Leave me to bleed  
Your love, love can be fatal  
It wasn't me that saw you pick up a letter fallen on the floor  
It wasn't me that heard you say you couldn't love me anymore  
There's no mistaking, I guess I'll just be waiting  
Leave me to bleed  
Your love, love can be fatal  
Leave me to bleed  
Your love, love can be fatal  
Leave me to bleed  
Your love, love can be fatal
