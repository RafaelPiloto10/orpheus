Sex crime, crime  
Can I take this for granted  
With your eyes over me?  
In this place, this wintery home  
I know there's always someone in  
Sex crime, sex crime  
Nineteen eighty four  
Nineteen eighty four  
And so I face the wall  
Turn my back against it all  
How I wish I'd been unborn  
Wish I was unliving here  
Sex crime, sex crime  
Sex crime, sex crime  
Nineteen eighty four  
Nineteen eighty four  
I'll pull the bricks down  
One by one  
Leave a big hole in the wall  
Just where you are looking in  
Sex crime, sex crime  
Nineteen eighty four  
Nineteen eighty four  
Nineteen eighty four  
...
