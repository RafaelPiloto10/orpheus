It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
Everywhere you go  
Take a look in the five and ten  
Glistening once again  
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow  
  
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
(Christmas)  
Toys in every store  
But the prettiest sight to see  
Is the holly that will be  
On your own front door  
  
A pair of hop-along boots and a pistol that shoots  
Is the wish of Barney and Ben  
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk  
Is the hope of Janice and Jen  
And mom and dad can hardly wait  
For school to start again  
  
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
Everywhere you go  
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel  
One in the park as well  
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow  
  
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
Soon the bells will start  
And the thing that will make them ring  
Is the carol that you sing  
Right within your heart  
  
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
Toys in every store  
But the prettiest sight to see  
Is the holly that will be  
On your own front door  
Sure it's Christmas once more
