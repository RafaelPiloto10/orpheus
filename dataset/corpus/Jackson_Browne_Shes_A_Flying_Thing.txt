She's a flying thing that sings  
With her eyes like smoky rings  
The sun can feel her presence in the sky  
And I think I'm gonna stay  
'cause there's nothing in our way  
And she says that she can teach me how to fly  
  
If I could love her more  
Than I have ever loved before  
Then tomorrow I'll be standing at her door  
  
And when I hear her voice  
I have no other choice  
Than to bend back my head and search the sky  
Her hair is spun so fine  
Roses fell like laughing wine  
And she says that she can teach me how to fly  
  
If I could give her all the things  
She's never had before  
Then tomorrow I'll be standing at her door  
  
To see her walking by  
Is to see a windy sky  
And the clouds reflecting in her eyes  
The softness of her skin  
Makes me wonder where I've been  
And she says that she can teach me how to fly  
  
If she could love me more  
Than she has ever loved before  
Then tomorrow I'll be standing at her door  
  
She's a flying thing that sings  
With her eyes like smoky rings  
She says that she can teach me how to fly  
And she says that she can teach me how to fly  
And she says that she can teach me how to fly
