He always found it hard to take her  
She wouldn't listen to advice  
And though he never tried to make her  
She often thought it would be nice  
  
Oh, and now she's headin' out to California  
It's been a long time comin' but she's feeling like a woman tonight  
And she left a little letter said she's gonna make a stop in Nevada  
Goodbye, goodbye.  
  
She tried for years to be a good wife  
It never quite got off the ground  
And all those stories of the good life  
Convinced her not to hang around  
  
Oh, and now she's heading out to California  
And she doesn't know what's comin' but she's sure of what she's leaving behind  
And she left a little letter said she's gonna make a stop in Nevada  
Goodbye, goodbye.  
  
And though she finds it hard to leave him  
She knows it would be worse to stay  
He wouldn't understand the reasons  
That make a woman run away  
  
Oh, and now she's heading out to California  
With some money in her pocket she's a rocket on the fourth of July  
And she left a little letter said she's gonna make a stop in Nevada  
Goodbye, goodbye.
