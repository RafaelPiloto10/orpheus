Gimme good times  
Gimme soul life  
Give me fever  
I'm a believer  
Give me anything  
Gimme space brain Gimme music, gimme love  
I've never seen love  
  
Gimme good times (I want to be with you,  
Let me jump high and all I want is you)  
Gimme easy breathing  
Give me everything, everything, everything  
  
Gimme good times  
Oh, gimme soul life  
Give me fever  
I'm a believer  
Give me anything ? (I want to be with you,  
Gimme space brain and all I want is you)  
Don't leave me ever  
We'll live forever  
(yes we will, I know we will)  
  
Oh, gimme good times  
Gimme soul lifes  
Gimme fever  
I'm a believer  
You know I am  
Give me anything ? (I want to be with you,  
And gimme space brain and all I want is you)  
Gimme music, give me love  
I've never seen love  
Stick it in my brain [Repeat: x3]
