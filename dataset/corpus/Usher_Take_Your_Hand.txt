Hey, I feel like I could just blow on up  
Anytime I could just lose control  
Caught up in your lovin' every time I feel your touch  
Second thoughts small doubts start to beat me up  
You're everything I wanted before I knew just what I wanted  
And hey, hey, you're killing me on the inside  
You're the only one I want I can't deny  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't know what to do, what to say  
I'm not sure what to tell you confused  
Which way, do I take your hand or let go  
Do I take your hand or let it go  
I can't take this feeling much more  
Do I take your hand or let go  
Don't know what to do, what to say  
I'm not sure what to tell you confused  
Which way do I go  
  
Hey, I feel I could blow on up  
Every time I feel your love I get so caught up  
It's your kiss it's your touch it's just everything  
But I'm feeling like I want to just run away  
Can't tell you what I want, but your'e everything I want  
And hey, hey it's killing me on the inside  
Cause you're all I ever wanted so I can't deny  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Somebody tell me  
Oh, is it that I'm so wrong, I can't say  
Or is it my life, so young, careless ways  
And in your eyes so much love you want to give  
But the more I hold you in my arms the pressure starts to build  
Build, build, build, build  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Take your hand or let go  
Take your hand or let it go [Repeat: x5]
