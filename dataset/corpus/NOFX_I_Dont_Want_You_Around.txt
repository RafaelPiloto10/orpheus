Jenny, so many times I tried to get away  
But you kept following me all over town  
I'll display it, there's no way to say it  
I don't just want you,  
  
I just don't want you around,  
I don't want you around,  
You follow me around  
It's really bringing me down  
I don't want you around  
  
When it was time to go I had nothing to say  
Don't you look at me,  
Don't you look at me that way  
"I love you!" Oh, really? Please go away  
  
What gave you the idea?  
Get it out of your head  
You follow us around  
We're not the Grateful Dead  
  
I wanted to be friends but you wanted more  
So, like I told you before  
I don't want you around
