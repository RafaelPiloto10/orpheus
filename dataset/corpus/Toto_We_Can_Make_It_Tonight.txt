I'm counting on you  
Gotta know, the time has come to follow through  
Drive straight through the night  
Just hold on, we can make it home before daylight  
  
There's a voice inside you  
And you know it can't be wrong  
So break away from this pain, girl  
We've held out much too long  
  
[Chorus]  
We can make it tonight  
If you give me the sign  
And I'll be by your side  
I've got the feeling it's right  
We can make it in time  
We can make it tonight  
  
Fear nothing at all  
Ya gotta know that nothing is impossible  
The things I've seen with these eyes  
Precious dreams  
That somehow you don't realize  
  
Well there's a thirst inside you  
I know I can't be wrong  
So let's get out of the storm girl  
We've waited much too long
