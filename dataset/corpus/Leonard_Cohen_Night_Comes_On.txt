I went down to the place  
Where I knew she lay waiting  
Under the marble and the snow  
I said, Mother I'm frightened  
The thunder and the lightning  
I'll never come through this alone  
She said, I'll be with you  
My shawl wrapped around you  
My hand on your head when you go  
And the night came on  
It was very calm  
  
I wanted the night to go on and on  
But she said, Go back to the World  
We were fighting in Egypt  
When they signed this agreement  
That nobody else had to die  
There was this terrible sound  
And my father went down  
With a terrible wound in his side  
He said, Try to go on  
Take my books, take my gun  
Remember, my son, how they lied  
And the night comes on  
It's very calm  
I'd like to pretend that my father was wrong  
But you don't want to lie, not to the young  
  
We were locked in this kitchen  
I took to religion  
And I wondered how long she would stay  
I needed so much  
To have nothing to touch  
I've always been greedy that way  
But my son and my daughter  
Climbed out of the water  
Crying, Papa, you promised to play  
And they lead me away  
To the great surprise  
It's Papa, don't peek, Papa, cover your eyes  
And they hide, they hide in the World  
  
Now I look for her always  
I'm lost in this calling  
I'm tied to the threads of some prayer  
Saying, When will she summon me  
When will she come to me  
What must I do to prepare  
When she bends to my longing  
Like a willow, like a fountain  
She stands in the luminous air  
And the night comes on  
And it's very calm  
I lie in her arms and says, When I'm gone  
I'll be yours, yours for a song  
  
Now the crickets are singing  
The vesper bells ringing  
The cat's curled asleep in his chair  
I'll go down to Bill's Bar  
I can make it that far  
And I'll see if my friends are still there  
Yes, and here's to the few  
Who forgive what you do  
And the fewer who don't even care  
And the night comes on  
It's very calm  
I want to cross over, I want to go home  
But she says, Go back, go back to the World
