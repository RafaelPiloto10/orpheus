My hands are red  
Admittedly, the cross is mine  
The time is come  
Forsake the brine  
Alone with the void for a thousand years  
I am the first of the reptillian rocketeers  
Doom shins it's bitter brink  
Its goblins casting stench to pave the way  
I'm going off to seek the soul  
Who'll teach me of the day  
A boy will be born in the garden  
I'll wait on a patch of green grass  
Somehow he'll know to find me there  
And place a star upon my crust  
We'll trace the crescent's rim  
Pawn's pursuit of deliverance  
My soul a satchel for musical vim  
Then I'll return to save my race
