Miley - There's a photo of me being kissed by a dude,  
And Annie Leibovitz tryin'a get me nude,  
For those of you who think that's very crude...  
I'm sorry that I'm not perfect!  
  
I never stole a necklace or got a dui,  
I never cheated on my wife like that golfer guy,  
So what, you can see a little boob from the side...  
I'm sorry that I'm not perfect!  
  
And sure, I danced on a pole,  
And people called it sinning,  
But at least I didn't date a porn star,  
And tell everyone 'I'm winning'!  
  
(A Guy And A Girl Walk On Stage)  
  
Girl - She never made a dirty tape and passed it along,  
Guy - She didn't text a photo of her dong,  
Miley - Don't both of these things seem worse than a bong... !  
I'm sorry,  
I'm so Sorry,  
I'm really sorry... That I'm not perfect!
