CHORUS:  
Nine nine nine gettin' jiggy  
People did you see that fire in the city?  
It's like we're fresh out of democratic,  
Gotta get yourself a little something  
Semi-automatic yeah....

Rollin' on over for the man....  
  
I believe, I believe what the old man said  
Though I know that there's no lord above  
I believe in me, I believe in you  
And you know I believe in love  
I believe in truth though I lie a lot  
I feel the pain from the push and shove  
No matter what you put me through  
I'll still believe in love  
And I say  
  
Cherie baby, spliff up  
I want to kick back mama  
And watch the world cup with ya baby  
Yeah, that's right!  
We're getting freeky tonight
