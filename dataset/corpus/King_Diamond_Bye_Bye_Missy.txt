Tea time Monday night, I was waiting  
passing time  
Then from the hallway, I saw Mother  
in her nightgown  
Swaying up the stairs, up the stairs, it  
seemed so unreal  
I knew Grandma' had sent "THEM"  
again, the invisible friends  
  
A little later in the middle of tea we  
came close to ecstasy  
"THEY" were telling tales from  
beyond when Grandma' rose  
  
She opened the door, and there was  
Missy  
Seeing Mother in Grandmother's  
chair, she went into tears  
  
Missy was screaming  
"What have You done, what have you  
done to My Ma", crying louder now  
"We better get rid of her, She's too  
young anyway", it was Grandma' who  
spoke  
  
"Bye, bye Missy, be gone forever  
The beautiful fireplace in the kitchen  
will do"  
  
I saw Missy struggling in Grandma'  
wrinkled hands  
"Oh No, let me be, Oh No Please No  
Grandma' Please  
Aagh Grandma' You're hurting me.  
Don't touch me or I'll break it, I've got  
the tea pot, I'll do it anyway"  
I saw liquid spreading, the bloody tea  
all over the floor  
Now I heard "THEIR" voices, some  
kind of demon growls  
DIE - SHE BROKE AMON - AMON - DIE  
  
"THEY" dropped "THEIR" tea cups,  
Grandma' stood still  
forced by invisible hands, Missy went  
down the stairs  
As I waved her goodbye, Missy was  
sobbing away  
  
Will I ever see her again, Bye bye  
Missy, don't be afraid
