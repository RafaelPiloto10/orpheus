Got to have you back I need you  
A jealous lie hurt my foolish pride  
Made me break your heart  
Now our love has died  
I see a closing door - a door never more  
A door of jealousy between your love and me  
Now I face a storm of tears  
You took the sunshine from my face  
Now I'm just another man  
Who walks the undestined way  
Without your guiding hand  
I can hardly tell when I'm the man  
Pride made a fool of me  
Now I'm drowning in misery - misery is drowning me  
  
And I've got to have you back I need you  
Between the night and day oh heaven speed you  
Cos I need you girl  
I've been told - it's a loneliness  
Oh dark is the emptiness  
Since you've been gone in me  
Oh gone is the lover I need  
Pride destroyed the love we knew  
But not my need for you  
Without your love around  
My whole world is falling down - falling down - all around  
And I've got to have you back  
  
Got to have you back  
Got to have you back  
Got to have you back  
Got to have you back  
  
I see a closing door...  
  
Got to have you back - I'm drowning in misery  
Got to have you back - my pride made a fool of me  
Got to have you back - my whole world is falling down  
Got to have you back - without your sweet love around  
  
Got to have you back
