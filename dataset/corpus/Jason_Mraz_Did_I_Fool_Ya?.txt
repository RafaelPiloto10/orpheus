When daddy sings  
Hes an auctioneer, auctioneer.  
And mother clings to anniversaries.  
And his sister, she's got a little bit of mister in her  
And her brothers goin round, round, round his bed  
And I said, and I say  
I say, well believe what I say  
I said, did I, did I, fool ya, fool ya  
Well didn't daddy fool ya?  
He sang once and a goin twice  
Hes gone for 35 or 40  
And he go, once and a goin twice  
Hes gone for 35... Sold to the middle line.  
They go once and a goin twice  
And aint it nice?  
And oh lord they made it up to 65  
They go once and a goin twice  
And aint it nice? Aint it nice oh aint it nice?  
... Said aint it nice for the price?  
I said I got a nice life for the price is right  
Body rock, rody bock  
And they boss, said a come on down, down, down  
Said come on down.  
Youre the next big winner  
So come on down  
Oh oh oh  
But I, but I, I said I  
I give and give and I lay it all down now  
Well look what I've found  
I give and give  
I said I give and give and I lay it all down  
Now look what I've found, ah look what I've found  
Blue skies, they're smiling at me  
And that's my favorite melody.  
But I can't read and I can't read and  
I can't read between the things unseen  
And I don't mind and I don't mind and I don't mind  
If I don't find because I've tried  
I'm absolutely definite  
Absolutley positive  
Absolutely definetly positive.  
I'm absolutely definite  
Absolutley positive  
Absolutely definetly positive  
I'm absolutely definite  
Absolutley positive  
Absolutely definetly positive.  
And I'm absolutely definite  
Absolutley positive  
Absolutely definetly positively represented.  
So I, why why, ohma why the bother with it all?  
Did I, did I fool ya?  
Well d
