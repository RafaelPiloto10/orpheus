Somebody screaming on Jim Jeffries' dreams  
Explode into a black fist and fall to the floor  
He stares up at the sky and he may wish he knew why  
But you can't go back there no more  
The future sounds so crazy, we all heard that song before  
Tomorrow's a name that changed from yesterday to blame  
When a train just don't stop here anymore  
  
I got starry eyed on a coaster ride  
Andy said, "Man, I need a break from the world outside"  
And these days my life just careens through a pinball machine  
I could do so much better but I can't get off the tilt  
There's a photograph on a tv, black and white  
Andy says something to you  
Jack Johnson straddling Reno, Nevada like  
She says I forget myself sometimes, too  
  
But out past the doorways where we are sleeping  
Well, the white queen's creeping, the time cat's beeping  
  
Now I'm not breaking, the train's just shaking  
I never made it here before  
And there's a wide mouth spinning the girls around  
Till they can't take it any more  
I used to dream in the dark, in Palisades Park  
Up over the cliffs and down among the spark  
It's a long life full of long nights  
  
But it's not what I was waiting for  
Everybody's seen the horses driving down the shore  
It's a miracle they don't make them anymore  
  
So make up ladies, oh wake up baby  
You walked into the bar like some Saturday star  
Studs straight on spiked heels and needles and nerves  
And you're a downtown pride, fully amplified Clyde  
Gin-tied and Asian, but well preserved  
Remember Annie outside your bedroom window  
Saying, "Come on, let's drive across to the Palisades"  
Keep going till we hit Reno, Nevada  
I don't see it all that much these days  
  
Still there are pages in back of the action stacks  
Where the white queen's creeping, the time cat's beeping  
  
The train's not breaking, the track's just shaking  
I never made it here before  
And there's a sky rocket turning the world around  
But still I can't take it any more  
And you carry that spark from Palisades Park  
Down over the cliffs and out into the dark  
It's a long life full of long nights  
  
But it's not what I was looking for  
Everyone dreams of horses flying round the shore  
It's a bad dream we're not having anymore  
  
Man, have you seen Andy?  
Hey man, hey man, have you seen him around?  
Hey man, have you seen my my my my my Andy?  
Hey man, have you seen him, have you seen him  
Have you seen him, have you seen him?  
Hey, have you seen Andy around?  
  
Dressed up in a pirate vest, all leathers and feathers and pearls  
Andy said, "Look at me, man, I'm cooking  
These hands are gonna figure out this whole world"  
He said, "Come outside, climb out your bedroom window  
Shimmy down the fire escape and say goodbye  
Come outside, " Andy says, "I'm dressed up just like Edie  
Changing all the time, my leopard spots to polka dots, just say goodbye  
Come outside, where maybe we can move to California  
Just meet me at the subway and say goodbye  
Come outside, the cops all think we're crazy  
If you steal, you'll just get married  
To a girl who'll never know you and then say goodbye"  
  
Hey man, have you seen Andy?  
I lost her in the cirque  
I was high as a kite on a lovely and white  
Man, you can lose anyone  
Hey, hey man, have you seen Andy?  
I don't know where she's gone  
Real love outlives teenage lust  
Oh, we could get wet and it keeps us warm  
Love is like angel dust  
Lovely sometimes changes us  
  
Sometimes we're not  
Have you been aching with trust or just  
Have you been waking yourself with lust?  
Have you been making us up or just taking us home?  
  
It's a long wait and a long life  
Cars frozen in flight  
All the traffic stops to stare  
At a crosswalk in Reno, Nevada  
Where nothing but air and a pair of gray paper wings  
Andy thinks, "Man, I have got nothing to wear"  
We got nothing to wear  
We got nothing to wear  
We got nothing to wear  
We got nothing to wear
