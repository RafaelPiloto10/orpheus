With one thing and another  
Banged my head against the wall  
Always looking over my shoulder  
And it makes no sense at all  
Chorus  
I'm going to dig this well deep  
It's a promise I must keep  
I'm going to dig this well deep  
'cause I want to find water  
I'm going to dig this well deep  
Going to sow before I reap  
I'm going to dig this well deep  
'cause I want to find water  
Cynics try to hold me in the graveyard of their egos  
Put my dreams out with the trashman and they left me on a plateau  
Holding on and keeping strong  
When you are walking on a tightrope  
Holding on and keeping strong  
When you are wilted down to your last last hope  
See it through to a conclusion even if it leads to nowhere  
Sometimes there is no solution but the water tastes as good there
