Let me tell you how it will be  
There's one for you, nineteen for me  
'Cause I'm the taxman, yeah, I'm the taxman  
  
Should five per cent appear too small  
Be thankful I don't take it all  
'Cause I'm the taxman, yeah I'm the taxman  
  
If you drive a car, I'll tax the street,  
If you try to sit, I'll tax your seat.  
If you get too cold I'll tax the heat,  
If you take a walk, I'll tax your feet.  
  
Don't ask me what I want it for  
If you don't want to pay some more  
'Cause I'm the taxman, yeah, I'm the taxman  
  
Now my advice for those who die  
Declare the pennies on your eyes  
'Cause I'm the taxman, yeah, I'm the taxman  
And you're working for no one but me.
