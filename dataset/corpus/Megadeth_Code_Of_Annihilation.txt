Hollow deeds and human death and torture hit men hard  
In a rhetoric of equals  
No such things as hell, not heaven, continues,  
The code of annihilation confronts with social attack  
As the flames of death are filled with brains in flux intact  
No one would ever die too soon  
Before the beginning of the baby boom  
And before the beginning of an era in gubernatorial rhetoric  
The rules of death and brutal attack while most men rise from the sick  
The mortal path of greed and demonic inaction  
Is about to be destroyed by demons attacking each other's adoration  
  
This is the code of annihilation  
Putting an end to devastation and distraction  
  
(Repeat chorus)  
  
And now, let demonic combat reign intact  
Before male human mercenaries are ready to attack evil fallout  
But it is not every male human being's fault  
  
This is the code of annihilation  
Putting an end to devastation and distraction  
  
(Repeat chorus)  
  
And now, let demonic combat reing intact  
Before male human mercenaries are ready to attack evil fallout  
But it is not every male human being's fault  
  
This is the code of annihilation  
Putting an end to devastation and distraction
