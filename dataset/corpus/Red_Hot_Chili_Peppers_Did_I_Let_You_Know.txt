(Come on, come on)  
  
I'm comin' for you 'cause 'cause I adore you and  
I'd like to get inside your mass production  
This indecision has has got me cringin' well  
I can't resist the smell of your seduction  
  
Did I let you know?  
Would you like to go?  
Unwrap the package with a mutt persuasion  
Did I let you know?  
Would you like to go?  
I wanna dance to every day's occasion  
  
This I know, yeah this I know  
(Take me home, well take me home)  
This I know we're not alone  
(Take me home, take me home)  
  
When we envision, lack of division and  
The planet does another revolution  
The day I blew on ya you said I grew on ya  
Turns out that we are all the one solution  
Go!  
  
I'm comin' at you well, you are the cap too and  
I like the sound of your articulations  
Want to arouse her and maybe espouse her well  
She showed me love with out the stipulations  
  
This I know, yeah this I know  
(Take me home, well take me home)  
This I know we're not alone  
(Take me home, take me home)  
  
I wanna lean on you, get Jan and Dean on ya  
It's time to sway a little mass perception  
I like you cheeky well, so Mozambiquey and  
I think the world could use a clear connection  
  
This I know, yeah this I know  
(Take me home, well take me home)  
This I know we're not alone  
(Take me home, take me home)  
  
This I know, hell this I know  
(Take me home, well take me home)  
This I know we're not alone  
(Take me home, take me home)  
  
Did I let you know?  
Would you like to go?  
Did I let you know?  
Would you like to go?  
Did I let you know?  
Would you like to go?
