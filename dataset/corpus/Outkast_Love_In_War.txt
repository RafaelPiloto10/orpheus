[Chorus: x2]  
Let's kiss, not fight  
Try to do what's right tonight  
Make love, not war  
What the hell are we living for?  
  
Tonight we'll make the prettiest song that no one will ever hear  
No one will ever hear  
No one will ever  
These ain't the times to be alone  
  
Cliche the end is near  
Cliche the end is near  
  
Cliche the end is  
Quickly approaching while we carry on  
No one is promised another day  
Why can't the story end like fairy tales often do  
Before I let you leave I've got to say  
  
[Chorus: x2]
