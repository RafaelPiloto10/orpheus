Oh, say can you see my stars  
The night time is almost ours  
To wander through Hayley's and look at the bars  
Night time is almost ours  
  
The headlights from passing cars  
They illuminate my face then they've made the dark  
The voice of Nirvana says, "Come as you are"  
And I will  
The night time is almost ours  
  
A sway of the hips and arms  
We'll cradle you from afar  
They swing till you tire and send it alarms  
Night time is almost ours
