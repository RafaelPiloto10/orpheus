Well I just had a conversation with my heart  
And it said let's stop to sing before it starts  
For he gets one put inside close that door and run and hide  
Thanks ole heart here is my advice to you  
Look out heart here he comes once again look out heart you know you can't win  
Well he said he would be true didn't say true to who  
Look out heart here he comes again  
[ guitar ]  
Well I've been through this a hundred times before  
I don't think I can stand this anymore  
Step aside let him by cause he's not my kind of guy  
Look out heart here he comes again  
Look out heart here he comes once again...  
Look out heart here he comes again
