Duck and Sally inside  
they took her forty down five  
Who's laying in the graveyard  
she's licking up her pig pen  
Oh, you shouldn't do that  
don't you know you'll stain the carpet  
Oh man, don't you know you'll stain the carpet  
ain't that just like Sister Ray said  
I'm searching for my mainline  
Oh babe, I couldn't hit it sideways  
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, I couldn't hit it, hit it sideways  
Then I, woh-oh, not that just like Sister Ray said  
  
Now Rosie's got a new piece  
She cocks and shoots it bang between three and four  
Oh, she aims it at the sailor  
shoots her down dead on the floor  
You shouldn't do that  
now don't you know you'll stain the carpet  
No baby, don't you know you'll stain the carpet  
and by the way you got a dollar  
  
I'm searching for my mainline  
'Cause, baby-baby, hit it, oh, sideways  
Hey baby now, I couldn't hit it sideways  
Now....  
Oh baby, it's like Sister Ray said  
give it to me, babe  
  
Who is that knocking  
Who's knocking on my chamber door  
Could it be the police  
They come and take me for a ride  
I haven't got the time-time  
She's, ah baby, sucking on my ding-dong  
she's sucking on my ding-dong  
Oh, just like Sister Ray said  
  
But I'm searching for my mainline  
I couldn't hit it, oh, side, oh, sideways  
I said I couldn't, I couldn't  
I couldn't hit it sideways  
Just like  
baby, just like that  
Baby, just like now  
'cause just like Sister Ray
