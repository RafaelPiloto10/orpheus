John San what you can  
La la Janette dance in sand  
What's the mystery, my son?  
Gypsy Dan Caravan  
Won Tun Wan with your Chinese fan  
It's part of history my son  
  
Murder and rape with your power  
The 10th revolution in far away days  
It's come to this  
A gypsy's kiss  
All your power's gonna fade in the haze  
  
Ya who' Jumme gae bile ya heed  
The Senorita said  
I'll drag your lungs out through your nose  
Space truckers free and high  
Teamsters get you by and by  
That should keep you on your toes  
  
They got a gun at your head  
But you ain't necessarily playing their game  
They can't resist  
A Gypsy's Kiss  
All that's needed to drive them insane  
  
John Wayne, the Alamo  
Crazy Horse, Geronimo  
I'll smoke a piece with you  
Mind, body heart and soul  
We got rock and roll  
And there's nothing they can do  
  
Hear the small voice of truth  
Above the shouting despair of the crowd  
What do you wish  
A Gypsy's Kiss?  
Gets you strong for crying out loud.
