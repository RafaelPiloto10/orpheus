Let me entertain you  
Let me make you smile  
  
Let me do a few tricks  
Some old and then some new tricks  
I'm very versatile  
  
And if you're real good  
I'll make you feel good  
I want your spirits too fine  
  
So let me entertain you  
And we'll have a real good time, yes sir  
We'll have a real good time  
  
And if you're real good  
I'll make you feel good  
I want your spirits to climb  
  
Let me entertain you  
And we'll have a real good time
