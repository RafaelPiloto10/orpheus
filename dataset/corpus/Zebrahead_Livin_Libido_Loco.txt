Enrique played in a band  
Down at the sand  
He hustled women and worked on his tan  
Drove an IROQ Camero quadraphonic 8 track stereo  
He was a sharp dressin' suave  
Cultured and smooth ladies man  
  
Maria stared in the show  
It's all that she knows  
She loved Enrique and Bilar and snow  
She knew her lover had others,  
But her heart was a desperate young soul  
She sold a night to a stranger  
While searching for her pot of gold  
  
[Chorus]  
We can dance to the rhythm,  
We can dace to the mornin' light  
On a sultury summer night  
The time is right for love  
Livin' libido loco days  
  
Arturo led a small gang  
A downtown thang  
He loved Maria the young bird who sang  
He bought her heart for a night, with some lines at the local disco  
She wore his love on her face, in the back of Arturo's limo  
  
Enrique was quite aware, of Maria's afair  
He vowed 'vengence Arturo I swear  
He brought his blade to the fight,  
But they both suffered their final blow  
Now Maria's in mourning,  
As she's left to live life alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's been twenty years past, since Maria's been last  
To the disco where she lost her soul  
She wipes a tear from her eye,  
And she still fights memories of ago  
As her new limo ride let's her in  
And asks 'how much, let's go  
  
[Chorus]
