Keep - Keep - Keep - Keep Feeling  
Keep Feeling - Keep Feeling - K - K - K - K  
  
If it seems a little time is needed  
Decisions to be made  
The good advice of friends unheeded  
The best of plans mislaid  
Just looking for a new direction  
In an old familiar way  
The forming of a new connection  
To study or to play  
  
Keep Feeling  
Keep Feeling  
K - K  
Keep Feeling  
  
If it seems a little time.........(Record Stops)
