Larry's in vegas..with some chick from La  
The best things are sevens and sex is just ok so please stay  
She said just stay  
Cause there's a show at 11 and the drinks are all free you can do  
Better for yourself but not me ....  
...so please stay and keep me company.  
All the while thinking this is the good luck, stays with her most of the time  
Takes time to make these machines work, people are so unkind  
Gets kinda nervous  
Used to be hard.  
She takes the edges off evenings in bedrooms and back seats in big cars.  
All the while thinking this is the good luck stays with her most of the time  
It takes time to make these machines work people are so unkind.  
People are so unkind  
She looks in the mirror  
To make she's here  
She keeps disappearing and dreaming of movie stars- weddings and nothing is
happening  
He tries not to notice  
She thinks he doesn't care.  
Capture yourself in a jar and you stay there,  
Until you vanish  
Thin air  
All the while thinking this is the good luck stays with her most of the time  
It takes time to make these machines work but he aint got time while  
She's riding in black cars and pokes at the sky to see if he can make stars
and  
People are so unkind  
People are so unkind..  
People are so unkind..  
People are so unkind...  
People are so unkind  
People are so..  
UN  
KIND..
