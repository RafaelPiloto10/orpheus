All of my life I've dreamed a love would come to me  
It's here and now I know it's more that and other love could be  
I never though I'd know someone who loved me so  
To go as for to die that His love for me would show  
I searched all over but I still couldn't find  
Someone to give me love to heal my hurt and ease my mind  
I sought affection tried everything new  
Didn't even know that I was lost without a clue  
Chorus:  
You have opened my eyes to a greater love  
You have opened my eyes to a greater love  
I used to be so blind but now it's clear to me  
How your love was displayed by what you did on Calvary  
I've got to tell the world that they might hurt you  
To find what I've found to really see how  
You have captured my soul, you have made me whole  
You have set me free 'cause I have given you control  
You have mended my heart and I have been redesigned  
Lord with everything you are, you have been blowin' my mind  
(chorus)  
It's an eternal fantasy that will never, ever change  
And you know He's rearranged my life  
It's and eternal fantasy that will never go away  
'Cause it's true are-E-A-L-I-T-why  
(bridge)  
(chorus out)
