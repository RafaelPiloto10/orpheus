There's a clock timing the world as it turns  
There's a man marking the candle as it burns  
Keeping track of every minute that remains  
Still we hope somehow  
It's gonna be alright  
It's gonna turn out fine  
There's a light shining beyond the southern cross  
Burning bright for everyone of us who's lost  
More than faith more than a reason to go on  
Rise on up knowing  
You're gonna win the fight  
It's gonna turn out fine  
You gotta hope it'll be alright  
Come on and hope it'll turn out fine  
Yeah, hope it'll be alright, please  
When the night turns to the deepest shade of black  
At that point there is no reason to turn back  
High above angels are falling from the sky  
Lift your heart knowing  
It's gonna be alright  
It's gonna turn out fine  
You gotta hope it'll be alright  
Come on and hope it'll turn out fine  
Yeah, hope it'll be alright, please  
You gotta hope, ya gonna win the fight  
Come on 'n hope with all your might  
Yeah hope it's gonna be alright, please  
Millions of people alone in the dark  
Awaiting a moment of hope  
Please  
You gotta hope (Whenever times get tough) it'll be alright  
Come on and hope (And when the road is rough) it'll turn out fine  
Yeah, hope (Just when you've had enough) it'll be alright, please  
You gotta hope (Whenever times get tough) you're gonna win the fight  
Come on and hope (And when the road is rough) with all your might  
Yeah, hope (Just when you've had enough) it's gonna be alright, please  
You gotta hope (Whenever times get tough) it'll be alright  
Come on and hope (And when the road is rough) it'll turn out fine  
Yeah, hope (Just when you've had enough) it'll be alright, please  
You gotta hope, you're gonna win the fight
