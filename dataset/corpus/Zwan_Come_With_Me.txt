all you need  
is something i'll believe  
flashlights in the hall  
but no call  
cause when my day is done  
i find where i belong  
waiting on the curb  
for you to come to carry on  
it won't be long  
we'll turn around  
i care enough to wake you up  
to make us mine i'll make you shine  
  
stay the night  
stay all your life  
just come with me  
  
come with me  
won't you come with me  
come with me again  
come with me  
(stay the night)  
won't you come with me  
(stay all your life)  
come with me again  
(just come with me)  
  
fell so high i broke my jaw  
i couldn't talk to you  
went underground to play around it's true  
but i came back  
to get you at that place so i could breathe  
  
it's 3 a.m.  
and i'm up again  
answering the call of all  
the flowers by the bed  
make me wish my head  
was lying and possessed by truth alone a certain home  
a wooden gate, a rabbit hole  
we'll turn around it won't be long  
capture that place, won't it be fun  
  
come with me  
(stay the night)  
won't you come with me  
(stay all your life)  
come with me again  
(just come with me)  
come with me  
(stay the night)  
won't you come with me  
(stay all your life)  
come with me again  
(just come with me)  
  
she means more to me  
than any living thing  
younger than the blush of spring she sings  
  
(stay the night)  
won't you come with me  
(stay all your life)  
come with me again  
(just come with me)
