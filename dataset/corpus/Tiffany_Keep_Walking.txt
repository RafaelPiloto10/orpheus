Am I in or am I out  
Don't pretend that you don't know what I'm talking about  
In your eyes I can see a reflection of someone it's clearly not me and you  
Keep walking like you've got somewhere else to go  
Keep talking like you don't care for me no more  
Make a wish now baby and I'll try to make it come true  
But I feel this time I'll be losing you  
Butterfly, I'm gonna letcha go  
I know I've done the same thing ten times before and you...  
Keep walking like you've got somewhere else to go  
Keep talking like you don't care for me  
Keep walking like you've got somewhere else to go  
Keep talking like you don't care for me no more.  
And you ...  
Keep walking like you've got somewhere else to go  
Keep talking like you don't care for me  
Keep walking like you've got somewhere else to go  
Keep talking like you don't care for me no more.  
Butterfly, I'm gonna letcha go  
I know I've done the same thing ten times before and you
