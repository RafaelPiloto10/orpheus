And I wrote my happiest songs  
Every child may joy to you  
What's wrong?  
Nothing but the real  
It is you that needed something stronger  
  
I need something stronger...  
  
If you have a problem don't hesitate to ask for assistance  
  
What's wrong...  
  
What's wrong?  
Nothing...  
  
What's wrong...?  
  
What's wrong...?  
  
(What's wrong?)  
Wha, wha, wha, wha, wha.....  
  
Can you feel this?  
What is that buzzing?  
Are you now, or have you ever, moved slowly?  
  
I need something stronger  
  
?????  
???????  
  
(What's wrong...?)  
(What's wrong...?)  
  
What's wrong?  
It's just a matter by you looking it, that's all...
