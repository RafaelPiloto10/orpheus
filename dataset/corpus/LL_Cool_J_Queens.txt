Hit that nigga, man, fuck these niggas  
Straight up, all y'all niggas, yo, yo  
Queens got the vets  
(Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens)  
Queens be the best  
(Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens)  
Queens take ya heads  
(Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens)  
Queens be the vets  
(Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens)  
I'm here to crack ya cats' skulls open  
Fuck ya head up more than that bullshit ya smokin'  
Niggas buzz you in the door but I blew it open  
Ya rhymes is trash that verse ain't worth a token  
Try to hop this, monotonous, murderous thoughts  
When I'm plottin' this, overthrow the government  
Burn the whole metropolis, lyrical warfare  
Hip-hop Apocalypse, strap devils to the chairs  
Start shockin' shit, Q you, I chew through  
We could battle in the projects and give or take the clue  
Flex could get one too, the wait, I'm supplyin'  
My crew pop, they iron from HTM to the peaks of Mount Zion  
I'm ready for the showdown  
Mention my name, cowboy, watch it go down  
I blow through your clique like Hurricane Floyd  
Keep rappers paranoid, kept your bodies in the game  
Is something I can't avoid, shit get tricky like Siegfried and Roy  
I seek and destroy  
Queens got the vets  
(Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens)  
Queens be the best  
(Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens)  
Queens take ya heads  
(Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens)  
Queens be the vets  
(Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens)  
I'ma blaze y'all niggas and represent Queens  
Run up in ya cribs, fill ya tubs with gasoline  
Smash ya plaques, tie ya arms back  
What's ya worse nightmare, Black? I'm beyond that  
The mic, how I strike it, got 'em dialin' psychics  
Roll with minds, don't give a fuck if you don't like it  
With niggas that's invited without recited, ignited  
It burn mad slow and that's why I'll easily light it  
Me and the ghettos reunited, all the broads is excited  
Your ass looks stupid, tryna fight it  
You wanna get your ass smacked up  
So you can dig into the stash that I stacked up  
But when my Queens, niggas flashed then you backed up  
Keep my dogs fed, so they can shit when niggas act up  
It's the L, nigga, dot com, dot hot lead red dot on your head be  
And the rappers you idolized that idolized me  
I walk in the spot, niggas part like the Red Sea  
And Todd's Shop of Horrors, we battle to the death tonight  
There's no tomorrow, I'm out for revenge  
Like the rebels in Nicaragua but I can take it farther  
Travel back in time, fill ya baby bottle with lava  
Queens got the vets  
(Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens)  
Queens be the best  
(Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens)  
Queens take ya heads  
(Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens)  
Queens be the vets  
(Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens)  
This is how we put it down, this is Veteran's Day  
We work hard so we can play hard and push them big things  
Persistent, we keep comin' like some nigs  
Droppin' albums, every few years we rich  
We the best, we the vets  
We do this for the love, we thirst for that street shit  
It's P, nigga, check my record, it's flawless  
Do the knowledge to the chorus, yeah you fuckin' right  
While I was raised on my fuckin' life  
I did my time on them corners, now I lead the fuckin' life  
Large dollars, guns and ice  
Is nothin' you know my weight and the price of it  
You know how the Q dogs do cousin  
We don't follow trends, we set those so get up on it  
Queens got the vets  
(Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens)  
Queens be the best  
(Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens)  
Queens take ya heads  
(Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens)  
Queens be the vets  
(Killa Queens, killa, killa Queens)  
Queens got the vets  
Queens be the best  
Queens take ya heads
