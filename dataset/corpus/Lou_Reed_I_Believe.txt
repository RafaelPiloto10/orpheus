Valerie Solanis took the elevator  
got off at the 4th floor  
Valerie Solanis took the elevator  
got off at the 4th floor  
She pointed the gun at Andy saying  
you cannot control me anymore  
  
I believe there's got to be some retribution  
I believe an eye for an eye is elemental  
I believe that something's wrong if she's alive right now  
  
Valerie Solanis took three steps  
pointing at the floor  
Valerie Solanis waved her gun  
pointing at the floor  
From inside her idiot madness spoke and bang  
Andy fell onto the floor  
  
I believe life's serious enough for retribution  
I believe being sick is no excuse and -  
I believe I would've pulled the switch on her myself  
  
When they got him to the hospital  
his pulse was gone they thought that he was dead  
His guts were pouring from his wounds  
onto the floor they thought that he was dead  
Not until years later would  
the hospital do to him what she could not  
what she could not  
  
Where were you, you didn't come to see me  
Andy said, I think I died, why didn't you come to see me  
Andy said, It hurt so much, they took blood from my hand  
  
I believe there's got to be some retribution  
I believe there's got to be some retribution  
I believe we are all the poorer for it now  
  
Visit me, visit me  
Visit me, visit me  
Visit me, why didn't you visit me  
visit me, why didn't you visit me  
Visit me, visit me  
visit me, why didn't you visit me
