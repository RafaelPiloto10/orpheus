Well you look like the kind who's got an eye for a bargain  
A kind of guy who likes to shop around  
Well I got me this old heart  
That I'm putting on the market  
And I'll make you a deal you can't turn down  
  
[Chorus]  
Have I got a deal for you  
A heart that's almost like brand new  
And I'll let it go so cheap  
You'll think you stole it 'fore you're through  
Have I got a deal for you  
  
Well you could search the whole world over  
And never find another like it  
It's got a built in lifetime guarantee  
It's a one time only offer  
And darling once you've tried it  
You're gonna fall in love with it you'll see  
  
[Chorus]
