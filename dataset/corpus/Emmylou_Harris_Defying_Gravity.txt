I live on a big blue ball  
I never do dream I may fall  
But even the day that I do  
I jump off and smile back at you  
I don't even know where we are  
  
But they tell us we're circling a star  
Well I'll take their word I don't know  
But I'm dizzy so maybe that's so  
  
I'm riding a big blue ball  
I never do dream I may fall  
But even the high may lay row  
So when I do fall I'll be glad to go
