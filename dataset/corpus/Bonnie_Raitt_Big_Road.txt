Well I ain't goin' down that big long lonesome road  
Pretty baby don't you hear me talkin'  
No I ain't goin' down that big road by myself  
If I can't carrry you baby  
I'm gonna get me someone else  
Alright boys  
Well the sun is gonna shine in my back door some  
My back door some, my door someday  
You know the sun is gonna shine in  
My back door some day  
That big wind is gonna come up and blow my blues away  
Now if you don't want me baby  
Now why don't you tell me  
Now why don't you tell me, tell me so  
If you don't want me baby why don't you tell me so  
It ain't like I'm a woman who ain't got no place to go  
Play it right now  
Now what good is a bulldog, if he won't fuss or  
He won't fuss or fight pretty baby  
What good is a bulldog, if he won't fuss or fight.  
And what good is a man can't make his wolf stay all night
