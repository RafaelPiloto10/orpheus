When I was a girl, my favorite thing  
In the whole wide world  
Was to see a field and  
Run for no reason  
And off I'd go, no one behind  
Only earth below  
Just a patch of green, green as the season  
Don't ask why, your feet just fly  
Green and sky is all that you're needin'  
  
Why ask why, when all that's true  
The sky is blue, blue for no reason  
Now that things have changed  
Everything's carefully prearranged  
Not a thing gets done  
Except for a reason  
Now I'm overrun, I'm startin' to feel  
Like a hired gun  
Where's the chance, where's the fun  
Where is the pleasin'?  
  
Try and try, you moan and sigh  
You just can't find a thing to believe in  
Why ask why, when all that's true  
The sky is blue, blue for no reason  
Don't ask why, your feet just fly  
Green and sky is all that you're needin'  
Why ask why, when all that's true  
You're just blue, blue for no reason
