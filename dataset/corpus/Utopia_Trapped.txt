Brother John saw visions of God  
So they put him in chains  
For acting too odd  
As the crowd shouted, "Off with his head"  
The priest said, "Have mercy  
Let's burn him instead"  
Trapped  
Trapped in a world that he never made  
I woke up with my head on the floor  
In a windowless cell  
A room full of doors  
I got lost, now I'm so far behind  
Took so much advice  
Forgot my own mind  
Trapped  
Trapped in a world that I never made  
We can't be slowed down by a big bunch of lip  
And nobody cares about your paranoid trip  
You know death and the devil sure got it easy today  
Souls come so cheap some people give theirs away  
You've got to break out, you've got to prove you're alive  
What makes you think that the weak survive  
And if you don't have the stomach  
For all this radical crap  
Then have the guts to stand for something  
Or you're gonna be trapped  
Trapped  
Trapped in a world that you never made
