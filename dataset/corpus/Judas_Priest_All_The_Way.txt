Alright baby. You know how to have a good time don't cha  
It's the way you stand  
You're always attracting attention  
  
Now with your hands on your hips, and a  
Snarl on your lips  
Your eyes wore the look of danger  
There's a lion in your heart,  
  
That's set to quick start,  
  
To a glance from any stranger  
You give as good as you get  
No one's beat you yet  
You take the lead  
You never need  
You know all the moves you've got to make  
  
You take it all, you take it all the way  
  
Ya never do things by half  
You're a man with a reputation  
You never shy when the problems fly  
You can cope with any situation  
You take the wheel and crack the whip  
You never slip  
You rule the roost  
You always boast  
Yeah you're lookin' after number one  
  
You take it all, you take it all the way
