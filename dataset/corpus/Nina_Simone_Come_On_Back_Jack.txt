Now every woman is entitled to one mistake  
The Lord knows I've made one  
But baby forgive me half a chance  
I wanna make it up to you  
  
Come on back Jack hey Jack come on come on back  
Come on back Jack hey Jack come on come on back  
Who's calling me oh who's calling me  
Come on back Jack hey Jack come on come on back  
  
When I told you I was through  
And I told you  
To move on  
I didn't know I'd miss you so  
But baby I was wrong  
Those nights without your love  
They ain't worth thinking of ha ha  
  
Come on back Jack hey Jack come on come on back  
Come on back Jack hey Jack come on come on back  
Oh woman save your breath  
Little woman save your breath  
Come on back Jack hey Jack come on come on back  
  
When you told me you was through  
And you told me to move on  
I found a sweeter love than you  
And it didn't take me long  
  
No now baby please don't you do that to me  
I need your crazy kisses so to rock me tenderly  
Those nights without your love  
They ain't worth thinking of ha ha  
  
Come on back Jack hey Jack come on come on back  
Come on back Jack hey Jack come on come on back  
I'm never coming back ain't never coming back  
Come on back Jack hey Jack come on come on back  
  
Now I'm pleading with you baby  
What you got to say about it  
I ain't coming honey  
  
Now please I'll apologize  
I admit I was wrong  
I'll help you all I can  
But ain't coming remember  
I told you I'd get on my feet again  
  
Now wait a minute Jack I'll help you  
I told you I was sorry  
Baby I done found someone else
