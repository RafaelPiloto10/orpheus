Can you see her standing there  
And well she's trying to find just anywhere  
The flowers in her hands but she doesn't know why, why  
  
And offered is advice to you and all you do was fake it  
  
Mother, and she's only yours tonight, mother,  
Oh she never cries, mother,  
But I know there's hurt inside, mother, Julia  
  
Drowning in her own visions,  
She's begging the past to stay behind  
A black cat in the night,  
And there's a black cat in that sky, sky  
  
But offered is advice to you, you left but I don't blame you Yeah  
  
Mother, and she's only yours tonight, mother,  
Oh she never cries, mother,  
But I know there's hurt inside, mother, Julia  
  
We're digging, we're digging up the past  
To cross it, cross it, to cross that line  
To bury, to bury, to bury it,  
One last time  
  
And offered is advice to you but all you do is fake it  
I know that pain inside the truth but you just got to shake I  
  
Mother, and she's only yours tonight, mother,  
Oh she never cries, mother,  
But I know there's hurt inside, mother, Julia  
  
Mother, and she's only yours tonight, mother,  
Oh she never cries, mother,  
But I know there's pain inside, mother, Julia, sweet, sweet Julia  
  
Sweet, sweet Julia
