You're everything my dreams have seen.  
But, what are dreams?  
I'm walking where my dreams have been.  
But, what are dreams?  
  
Can I believe these spells I feel?  
I'm wary now.  
Can I believe, or is this real?  
I'm wary now.  
  
Just like some new-born creature, I.  
What are dreams?  
A child in need of love and care.  
Tell me what, tell me what, are dreams?  
  
Can I believe these spells I feel?  
I'm wary now.  
Can I believe, or is this real?  
I'm wary now.  
  
Just like some new-born creature, I.  
What are dreams?  
A child in need of love and care.  
Tell me what, tell me what, are dreams?
