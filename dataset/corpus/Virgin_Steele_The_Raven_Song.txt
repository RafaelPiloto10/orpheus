Soaring high above the desert  
far beyond the shifting plains I call your name  
With a love that goes beyond love  
past the prison of all time In the sky you and I  
  
From the Dawn of all Creation  
to the pain of Nevermore  
Can you hear me in your slumber  
As I Haunt the Nightly shore  
  
Chorus:  
Unleash the Raven fly to me  
Unleash the Raven fly to me  
  
In the Palace of the Spirits  
where the streets are still and strange, I stand alone  
13 moons reveal the sadness  
where your mortal body drained  
In the sky ou and I, we can't die  
  
From the Dawn of all Creation  
Calling from the other side  
None can ever tear asunder  
our love is sanctified  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Fly Phantom of Night, Vulture Divine send me Lenore  
  
From the Dawn of all Creation  
Calling from the other side  
None can ever tear asunder  
our love is sanctified  
  
Unleash the Raven fly to me  
Unleash the Raven fly to me  
When the Light of Life is over calling from the other side  
Unleash the Raven fly to me  
Unleash the Raven fly to me
