(Tiffany, T. Feehan, G. Black)  
I got a feeling  
Everything's gonna be alright  
And I still find my way  
And I heard  
It's always darkest before the storm  
So come on let it rain  
Everything was different when I was seventeen  
The world was so much brighter  
Now I finally found the truth  
Of what they hid for me  
That world was so much kinder  
Silence  
Don't hear a sound  
But my own voice  
Silence  
Is what it is  
By my own choice  
I believe  
That we were meant to learn from our mistakes  
And stumble along the way  
Now I know  
That people are gonna grap what they can take  
Then just turn away  
Everybody's searching  
But no one really knows the truth  
The world is upside down  
What it's all about right now  
Will soon turn to gray  
Their promises have faded  
Silence  
Silence  
Silence  
Don't hear a sound  
But my own voice  
Silence  
Don't hear a sound  
But my own voice  
Silence  
Is what it is  
By my own choice  
All my little merry friends  
Have turned their backs on me  
Excuse me if I'm jaded  
I'm so tired of people telling me  
How it should be  
Their promises have faded  
Silence  
Silence  
Silence  
Don't hear a sound  
But my own voice  
Silence  
Don't hear a sound  
But my own voice  
Silence  
Is what it is  
By my own choice  
Silence
