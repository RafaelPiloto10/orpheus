"There's a hole in the sky Because I don't know but don't ask me why There is
a long way to go Where the road is leading me Future will show I will never
die Cause I will fly To the other side For what is right They do what they
want I'm trying to fight But evil spirits pass me by What you feel or what you
say They just don't care I will never die Cause I will fly To the other side
Because I don't know but don't ask me why There's a hole in the sky There is a
long way to go Future will show Where the road is leading me I will never die
Cause I will fly To the other side "
