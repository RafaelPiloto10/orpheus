Lights out  
We live in a world  
Of darkness  
No doubt  
Everything's up for sale  
We sleep  
All of the world is burning  
We pray  
To god for a better deal  
Nothing is sacred  
Back then or now  
Everything's wasted  
Is that all there is?  
Can I go now?  
  
Judas my guide  
Whispers in the night  
Judas my guide  
  
Fight wars  
Die in a blaze of glory  
Come home  
Meat in a plastic sack  
Fall down  
Better pray to your God  
For mercy  
So kneel  
And help the blade cut clean  
Nothing is sacred  
Back then or now  
Everyone's wasted  
Is that all there is?  
Is that it now?  
  
I live in the black  
I have no guiding light  
I'm whispering in your dreams  
  
Judas my guide  
Whispers in the night  
Judas my guide  
  
Judas my guide  
Whispers in the night  
Judas my guide
