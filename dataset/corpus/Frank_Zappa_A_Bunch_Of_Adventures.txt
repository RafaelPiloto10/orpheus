Fz: From the point that Jeff Simmons quit the group we had a bunch of
adventures trying to find somebody to replace him. Non only for the bass parts
in the music, but to play the role that he was supposed to play in the film,
which is a pretty large part. And, uh, our first candidate for the role was
Wilfrid Brambell, who played the grandfather in A Hard Day's Night. So Wilfrid
came over, tried out for the part, everything was set, he rehearsed with us
for about a week, and then one day came to the studio here and, completely
freaked out, and said that he couldn't handle it anymore. So, we went into the
dressing room and sat around with the guys in the band and tried to figure out
what we're gonna do 'bout replacing the replacement, and the first person that
walked through the door was Martin Lickert, who happened to be Ringo's driver,
and, uh, everybody just turned and look at him and we went, "You!"
