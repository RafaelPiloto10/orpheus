Lately, I can't sleep at night  
I can't turn off my mind  
You've got me goin' in circles  
When you're not around me  
I just keep thinking  
  
What my life would be without you  
Isn't it crazy  
Like I'm on a string  
Make me dance and sing  
  
And when you feel like some lovin'  
You turn on my music  
You give me hope and then you're gone  
I feel so helpless  
  
Isn't it crazy  
Totally crazy  
You touch my hand  
And make my temperature rise  
  
You get me goin'  
With that look in your eyes  
Holding on,  
I'm holding on  
  
Your love keeps killing me I go willingly  
Crazy  
And baby I love you  
Like nobody loves you  
  
I only wish that loving you was not so easy  
Isn't it crazy  
Totally crazy  
You touch my hand  
  
And make my temperature rise  
You get me goin'  
With that look in your eyes  
Holding on,  
  
I'm holding on  
Your love is killing me  
I go willingly crazy  
Crazy over you  
  
Look what love can do  
Can make you act like a baby  
Isn't it crazy  
Why do I go on  
  
It's out of control now  
Isn't it crazy
