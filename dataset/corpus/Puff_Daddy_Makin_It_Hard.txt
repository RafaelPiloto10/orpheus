I want her to feel it in her chest  
I want her to feel it in her soul  
I want her to lose control  
Mary, talk to 'em  
  
[Mary]  
I  
Yeah  
I  
You takin' a part of me  
That I cannot set free  
See me lettin' go  
No this ain't the time  
I got too much livin' to do  
And I can't lose it over you  
So give me the flow  
I'll get my swagger goin'  
I'll say this is the year for me  
  
You makin it so damn hard  
For me to love you  
You makin it so damn hard  
For me to love you  
You makin it so damn hard

For me to love you  
  
[Diddy]  
Damm you been up and down the whole way  
I know I make it hard to love me  
But trust me  
I could take you to places  
That you ain't never been  
Put you in purple labels  
And in vera wang  
Get your name engraved  
On a wedding ring on everything  
I'ma love you better  
More than I ever did  
Cause baby girl listen  
Since you been here with me  
Can't even lie  
I see the rider in ya ambition  
Providin' me with the fire  
When you wet and drippin'  
Mommy if you see it different  
Go 'head and get it  
And I ain't sayin' if you leave me  
It'd be better  
But me and you together  
Honey we could do whatever  
Let's do it  
I made it hard  
I admit it it's true  
I need to hear somethin'  
I'm listenin' boo  
  
[Mary J blige]  
So make sure I'm heard and things improve  
I'm prepared to take it there for you  
Your lovin' keeps me lovin'  
Saying no purpose constant chest pain  
It's amazin'  
But it ain't enough  
Friends keep askin'  
I'm staying around  
For what  
Who sheds this many tears  
Remind of where am I as to what it is  
Oh oh oh  
  
[Diddy]  
I know I'm hard to love  
Let's rock  
  
[Mary]  
You makin it so damn hard

[Diddy]  
Lemme talk to you one more time girl  
You always sayin' that I don't want you to hurt  
You always complainin'  
But I was makin' it worse  
Besides all the games that I's kickin' at first  
It's time to explain  
My mind's been in reverse  
But now I think back  
When nobody cared  
And you was there  
Just to roll by your man  
And came back  
Even know what I did  
I realize and I'm aware  
I know what it is  
Put that on everything  
Girl you my everything  
I don't know where I'd breathe  
Cause you the air I be  
If lovin' is wrong  
Who could be right  
I wouldn't know what to do  
Without you in my life  
You're more to me than the world I pray  
The more nights for your heart to ache  
Right in the middle of the dawn of day  
I think of all the pain I caused  
And throw it away and say  
I need you in my life  
Can you feel it in your soul  
  
[Mary]  
You makin it so damn hard  
For me to love you  
You makin it so damn hard  
For me to love you  
You makin it so damn hard  
For me to love you  
You makin it so damn hard  
For me to love you  
  
[Diddy]  
I know it's hard to love me  
That don't mean I don't love you  
Hey rich  
I love the way you got Harlem singin'  
Mary take us home  
  
[Mary]  
You makin it so damn hard  
For me to love you  
You makin it so damn hard  
For me to love you
