Grace  
She takes the blame  
She covers the shame  
Removes the stain  
It could be her name  
  
Grace  
It's a name for a girl  
It's also a thought that  
Changed the world  
  
And when she walks on the street  
You can hear the strings  
Grace finds goodness  
In everything  
  
Grace  
She's got the walk  
Not on a ramp or on chalk  
She's got the time to talk  
  
She travels outside  
Of karma, karma  
She travels outside  
Of karma  
  
When she goes to work  
You can hear the strings  
Grace finds beauty  
In everything  
  
Grace  
She carries a world on her hips  
No champagne flute for her lips  
No twirls or skips  
Between her fingertips  
  
She carries a pearl  
In perfect condition  
What once was hurt  
What once was friction  
What left a mark  
No longer stings  
  
Because grace makes beauty  
Out of ugly things  
  
Grace finds beauty  
In everything  
  
Grace finds goodness  
In everything
