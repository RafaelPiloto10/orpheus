[Chorus]  
Sass 'E' Frass and Joe 'D' Glow  
Headin' out to the picture show  
Sweet innocence not yet 18  
Daddy don't mind what daddy don't see  
  
Heavy Chevy soft top down  
One arm driver, the other arm around  
Switched on hi fi rock'n'roll  
Gunnin' the engine heading for the open road  
  
Given strict instructions  
Not to fall for no seductions  
Daddy don't mind what daddy don't see  
Joe had no such orders  
Gonna try and cross the border  
Daddy don't mind what daddy don't see  
  
Sass makes the move she straightens her seams  
Joe checks in the mirror he thinks he's James Dean  
He pulls on over says he's got a flat  
Sass is no fool she knows where he's at  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She's had love and she's had kissin'  
Knows what she's been missin'  
No turnin' back for little Sass 'E' Frass  
Will they be standin' side by side  
If their love they cannot hide?  
No turnin' back for little Sass 'E' Frass  
  
Sass 'E' Frass and Joe 'D' Glow  
Never made it to the picture show  
Sweet innocence thrown out the door,  
She'll never be the same no more  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, daddy don't mind what daddy don't see [Repeat: x3]
