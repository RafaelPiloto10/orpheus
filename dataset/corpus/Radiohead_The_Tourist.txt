It barks at no one else but me,  
Like it's seen a ghost.  
I guess it's seen the sparks a-flowin,  
No one else would know.  
  
Hey man, slow down, slow down,  
Idiot, slow down, slow down.  
  
Sometimes I get overcharged,  
That's when you see sparks.  
They ask me where the hell I'm going?  
At a 1000 feet per second,  
  
Hey man, slow down, slow down,  
Idiot, slow down, slow down.  
  
Hey man, slow down, slow down,  
Idiot, slow down, slow down.
