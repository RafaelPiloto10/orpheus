I'm running in quicksand  
Something's haunting me  
The guilty past I've buried  
My mind won't let me sleep  
I'll do anything for peace - I keep waking up  
A solemn oath I make  
Cross my heart please let me sleep - I keep waking up  
How much more do I take  
My head is talking to me  
I don't know what it needs  
But the loudest voice  
Is the one I heed  
Insomnia, my swollen bloodshot eyes  
Insomnia, awake till morning light  
Insomnia, stirring deep inside  
Insomnia, somebody turn out the lights  
I can't sleep - Insomnia  
I'm twisting and turning - I keep waking up  
The madness I must tame  
My candle is burning - I keep waking up  
Both ends again today  
The whole house is creaking  
I know they're out there  
The things kept from sight  
I beg to the shadows  
I can't sleep  
Insomnia, footsteps on the walk  
Insomnia, I hear someone knock  
Insomnia, I wish it was a dream  
Insomnia, can you hear me scream
