Well I saw fireworks from the freeway.  
And behind closed eyes I cannot make them go away  
'Cause you were born on the fourth of july freedom ring  
Now something on the surface it stings  
I said something on the surface  
Well it kind of makes me nervous  
Who says that you deserve this?  
And what kind of god would serve this?  
We will cure this dirty old disease  
Well if you've got the poison I've got the remedy  
  
The remedy is the experience.  
This is a dangerous liaison  
I say the comedy is that it's serious.  
This is a strange enough new play on words  
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend  
The rest of your nights with the light on  
So shine the light on all of your friends  
When it all amounts to nothing in the end.  
  
I won't worry my life away.  
I won't worry my life away.  
  
Well I heard two men talking on the radio  
In a cross fire kind of reality show  
Uncovering the ways to plan the next big attack  
They were counting down the ways to stab  
The brother in the be right back after this  
The unavoidable kiss, where the minty fresh  
Death breath is sure to outlast this catastrophy  
Dance with me, because if you've got the poison,  
I've got the remedy  
  
The remedy is the experience.  
This is a dangerous liaison  
I say the comedy is that it's serious.  
This is a strange enough new play on words  
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend  
The rest of your nights with the light on  
So shine the light on all of your friends  
When it all amounts to nothing in the end.  
  
I won't worry my life away.  
I won't worry my life away.  
  
When I fall in love I take my time  
There's no need to hurry when I'm making up my mind  
You can turn off the sun but I'm still gonna shine and I'll tell you why  
  
Because  
  
The remedy is the experience.  
This is a dangerous liaison  
I say the comedy is that it's serious.  
This is a strange enough new play on words  
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend  
The rest of your nights with the light on  
So shine the light on all of your friends  
When it all amounts to nothing in the end.  
  
I won't worry my life away  
I won't worry my life away  
I won't and I won't and I won't
