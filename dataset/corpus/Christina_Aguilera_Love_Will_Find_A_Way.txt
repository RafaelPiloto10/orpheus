No one ever said that  
Love was gonna be easy  
Gotta take the ups and downs  
The in betweens  
If you take this journey  
Gotta give yourself completely  
Never let nobody ever step on a dream  
  
You better stop  
Listen to these words I say  
You better stop  
Don't you throw this good thing away  
no no  
Put your trust in me  
And I'll make you see  
  
[Chorus]  
No the rain won't last forever  
Find a way to make it better  
Long as we can stand together  
Love will find a way  
Gonna make a new tomorrow  
Say good-bye to tears and sorrow  
Better listen when I say  
Love will find a way  
  
Somebody tried to tell me love  
doesn't last forever  
Said it only happens in your wildest dreams  
After all is said and done  
We're still here together  
Never listen to the lies and jealousy  
  
You better stop  
Don't you let them turn you around  
You better stop  
Hang onto this love that we've found  
Nothing ever say  
Can stand in our way  
  
[Chorus]
