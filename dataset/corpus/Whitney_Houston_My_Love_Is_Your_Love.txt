(Clap your hands y'all, it's alright...)  
  
If tomorrow is judgment day (Sing Mommy)  
And I'm standing on the front line  
And the Lord asks me what I did with my life  
I will say I spent it with you  
  
If I wake up in World War III  
I see destruction and poverty  
And I feel like I want to go home  
It's okay if you're coming with me  
  
'Cause your love is my love  
And my love is your love  
It would take an eternity to break us  
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us  
'Cause your love is my love  
And my love is your love  
It would take an eternity to break us  
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us  
  
If I lose my fame and fortune  
And I'm homeless on the street  
And I'm sleeping in Grand Central Station  
It's okay if you're sleeping with me  
  
As the years they pass us by  
We stay young through each other's eyes  
And no matter how old we get  
It's okay as long as I got you baby  
  
'Cause your love is my love  
And my love is your love  
It would take an eternity to break us  
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us  
'Cause your love is my love  
And my love is your love  
It would take an eternity to break us  
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us  
  
If I should die this very day  
Don't cry, 'cause on Earth we weren't meant to stay  
And no matter what the people say  
I'll be waiting for you after the judgment day  
  
'Cause your love is my love  
And my love is your love  
It would take an eternity to break us  
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us  
'Cause your love is my love  
And my love is your love  
It would take an eternity to break us  
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
