You can reach  
But you can't grab it  
You can hold it, control it  
No, you can't bag it  
  
You can push  
But you can't direct it  
Circulate, regulate, oh no  
You cannot connect it  
  
You know you're chewing bubblegum  
You know what that is  
But you still want some  
You just can't get enough  
Of that lovie dovie stuff  
  
You get confused  
But you know it  
Yeah, you hurt for it, work for it, love  
You don't always show it  
  
Let's go  
Let's go  
Let's go  
Discotheque  
  
Let's go  
Let's go  
Discotheque  
  
You're looking for the one  
But you know you're somewhere else instead  
You want to be the song  
Be the song that you hear in your head  
  
Love...Love...  
Love...Love...  
Love...  
  
It's not a trick  
'Cause you can't learn it  
It's the way you don't pay, that's okay  
'Cause you can't earn it  
  
You know you're chewing bubblegum  
You know what that is  
But you still want some  
You just can't get enough  
Of that lovie dovie stuff  
  
Let's go  
Let's go  
Discotheque  
  
Go go  
Go go  
Discotheque  
  
You're looking for the one  
But you know you're somewhere else instead  
You want to be the song  
Be the song that you hear in your head  
  
Love...  
(You want heaven in your heart)  
(Heaven in your heart)  
(The sun, the moon, and the stars)  
  
But you take what you can get  
'Cause it's all that you can find  
But you know there's something more  
Tonight, tonight, tonight  
  
Ha...ha...  
Ha...ha...  
Ha...ha...  
Ha...
