I know that I'm not great  
And some say I imitate  
Anymore I don't know  
I'm just doing the best I can  
  
After all I'm standing in the shadows  
Of a very famous man  
  
As I travel around from town to town  
I have a lot of dad's fans and friends come around  
They say I know Hank would be proud of you  
If he were here today  
  
Now well, we're all so glad  
And we know he would be too  
That you're carryin' on  
His music this way  
  
Yes, they say Hank was the all time great  
And we know you'll be just as good as your dad  
But I just smile and say there'll never be another Hank Williams friends  
That's the part that always makes them sad  
  
Yes, I know that I'm not great  
And some say, I imitate  
Anymore I don't know  
I'm just doing the best I can  
  
It's hard standing in the shadows  
Of a very famous man  
  
So many times when I'm on that stage  
I feel something go through me  
And for a minute I'm in a different world  
And that's when it does something to me  
  
The people are a hollering and clapping real aloud  
While I'm out they're taking my bows  
I look up toward the ceiling and I say to myself  
"Listen dad, just listen to that crowd"  
  
But as the show goes on the people clap and holler more  
I start to singing another of your great songs  
That's the time that I know although you're gone  
Your music will live on and on and on
