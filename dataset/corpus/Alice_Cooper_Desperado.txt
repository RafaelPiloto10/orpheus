I'm a gambler  
And I'm a runner  
But you knew that  
When you lay down  
  
I'm a picture  
Of ugly stories  
I'm a killer  
And I'm a clown  
  
Step into the street by sundown  
Step into your last goodbye  
You're a target just by living  
Twenty dollars will make you die  
  
I wear lace  
And I wear black leather  
My hands are lightning up  
On my gun  
  
My shots are clean  
And my, my shots are final  
My shots are deadly  
And when it's done  
  
You're as stiff as my smoking barrel  
You're as dead as a desert night  
You're a notch  
And I'm a legend  
You're at peace  
And I must hide  
  
Tell where the hell I'm going  
Let my bones fall in the dust  
Can't you hear that ghost that's calling  
As my Colt begins to rust  
In the dust  
  
I'm a killer  
I'm a clown  
I'm a priest  
That's gone to town
