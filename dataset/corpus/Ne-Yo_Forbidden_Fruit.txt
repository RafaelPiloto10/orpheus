Verse 1:  
Stop me before I do something dumb  
Like fall in love with you(ooh)  
You kiss me once and I stand there stunned  
I don't wanna break loose, baby  
Never wanna break loose, baby  
I'd be a fool to think I was the only one  
I know you've got a few  
So I try not to involve my emotions  
It's just no use baby  
Everything that you do makes me  
Just want you more  
  
Chorus:  
Baby, when I look at you  
I just want you more  
When you touch me like you do  
I just want some more  
Baby, baby you're forbidden fruit  
And the fact that I can't have ya  
Just makes me want you more  
  
Verse 2:  
You are temptation in everyway  
You smile at me and (ooh)  
When your around  
I just can't behave  
I don't wanna break loose, baby  
But I know I need to, baby  
  
I'd be a fool to think I was the only one  
I know you've got a few  
So I try not to involve my emotions  
It's just no use baby  
Everything that you do makes me  
Just want you more  
  
Chorus:  
Baby, when I look at you  
I just want you more  
When you touch me like you do  
I just want some more  
Baby, baby you're forbidden fruit  
And the fact that I can't have ya  
Just makes me want you more  
  
And the saddest part of this  
I know that you are no good for me(know you are no good for me)  
But I just can't resist  
Baby what you do  
Baby you're forbidden fruit  
Chorus
