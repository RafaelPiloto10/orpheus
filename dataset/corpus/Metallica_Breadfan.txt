Breadfan  
Open up your mind  
Open up your purse  
Open up your vault  
Never, never gonna lose it  
  
Breadfan  
Take it all away  
Never give an inch  
Gotta make a mint  
Gotta make me a million  
  
Breadfan  
You got it wrong  
Some long time friend's gonna lose it  
In the end who's a fool  
  
Seagull  
Give it all away  
Stay a bird  
Stay a man  
Stay a ghost  
Stay what you wanna be  
  
Loser  
Give it all away  
Never stay with the winner  
With the man  
With all the filthy money  
  
Come on  
Keep it on the side  
With a ride  
On a record on the top  
If you're gonna be a bad boy  
  
Breadfan  
You got it wrong  
Some long time friend's gonna lose it  
In the end who's a fool  
  
Seagull  
Give it all away  
Stay a bird  
Stay a man  
Stay a ghost  
Stay what you wanna be  
  
Breadfan  
Open up your mind  
Open up your purse  
Open up your bones  
Never, never gonna lose it  
  
Breadfan  
Take it all away  
Never give an inch  
Gotta make a mint  
Gotta make me a million  
  
Breadfan  
You got it wrong  
Some long time friend's gonna lose it  
In the end who's a fool  
  
Seagull  
Give it all away  
Stay a bird  
Stay a man  
Stay a ghost  
Stay what you wanna be  
  
Mommy, where's Fluffy?
