There's that star, the one they said we'd never reach  
And just close your eyes  
There's the missing moon, there's the Milky Way  
Heaven's straight ahead, We'll be there today  
Rainbows right and left, sunshine everywhere  
If it couldn't be baby, how did we get here  
  
Some say we'll never get off the ground  
Some say we'll never make it out of town  
That someday we'll end up a world apart  
And some say we're a couple crazy kids  
And some say that's exactly what they did  
And I say you got to go with your heart  
And baby, look where we are  
  
There's that home, the one they said we'd never share  
And just close your eyes  
There's a picket fence, there's our mailbox  
Puppy on the porch and roses up the walk  
Shinny new minivan, kids in every seat  
Someday we'll look back and say it wasn't just a dream  
  
Some say we'll never get off the ground  
Some say we'll never make it out of town  
That someday we'll end up a world apart  
And some say we're a couple crazy kids  
And some say that's exactly what they did  
And I say you got to go with your heart  
And baby, look where we are  
  
Some say we'll never get off the ground  
Some say we'll never make it out of town  
That someday we'll end up a world apart  
And some say we're a couple crazy kids  
And some say that's exactly what they did  
And I say you got to go with your heart  
And baby, look where we are  
  
Some say- oh, oh  
Some say  
Some say, yes they do, some say  
Oooo, Oooo, Oooo, Oooo  
Some say, some say, some say  
Some say, someday, some say
