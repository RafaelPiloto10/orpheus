Heard every word that was said that night  
When the light of the world put the world to right  
  
Well here's to the boys back in 628  
Where an ear to the wall was a twist of fate  
  
I will shine a blinding light  
Through those hearts as black as night  
Sticks and stones may break my bones  
But as least the seeds of love will be sown  
  
Now once in awhile when I feel no shame  
I get down on my knees and I pray for rain  
And though the breeze blows gently while I state my case  
There'll be certain men waiting just to scratch my face  
Hand on my heart I will make a stand  
For the life and the times of the mirror man  
  
In my head there is a mirror  
When I've been bad, I've been wrong  
Food for the saints that are quick to judge me  
Hope for a Badman  
This is the Badman's Song  
  
Guilt in the frame of the looking-glass  
Puts a shine on the mind where reflections pass  
Where the jigsaw pieces of a broken man  
Try and fit themselves together again  
Lies in disguise in the name of trust  
Put your head in the sand it will turn to dust!  
What's your problem? What's your curse?  
Won't it make the matter worse?  
  
In my head...  
  
And they say " Faith can move move mountains  
Fire can cleanse your soul "  
Faith can move mountains  
But mind over matter won't you stop all your chatter, no!  
  
I heard every word that was said that night  
When the light of the world put the world to right  
When I hear soft whispers at the break of day  
  
Sweet talking boys who can do no wrong  
When the stories are tall as the day is long  
With such a thin line drawn between friend and foe  
Lord help me now and bless my soul!  
  
Look at yourself, see how you lie  
Your hands start shaking and you don't know why  
Look at yourself, see how you lie  
Your hands start shaking, they start shaking  
Look at yourself, see how you lie  
Your hands start shaking and you don't, don't, don't don't know why  
Look at yourself, see how you lie  
  
Well there's food for the saints that are quick to judge me  
Hope for a Badman.
