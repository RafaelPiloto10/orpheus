As the waves crash in  
On the western shore  
The wind blows fierce from the east  
Wave tops torn into flying spindrift, spindrift  
  
As the waves crash in  
On the western shore  
It makes me feel uneasy  
The spray that's torn away  
Is an image of the way I feel  
  
What am I supposed to say?  
Where are the words to answer you  
When you talk that way?  
Ooo-ooo, oh  
  
As sun goes down  
On the western shore  
The wind blows hard from the east  
It whips the sand into a flying spindrift, spindrift  
As the sun goes down  
On the western shore  
It makes me feel uneasy  
In the hot dry rasp of the devil winds  
Who cares what a fool believes?  
  
What am I supposed to say?  
Where are the words to answer you  
When you talk that way?  
Words that fly against the wind and waves  
  
A little closer to you  
Where is the wave that will carry me  
A little closer to you?  
Where is the wave that will carry me?  
  
What am I supposed to say?  
Where are the words to answer you  
When you talk that way?  
Ooo-ooo, oh  
  
What am I supposed to do?  
Where are the words that will make you see  
What I believe is true?  
  
Where is the wave that will carry me  
A little closer to you?  
Where is the wave that will carry me  
A little closer to you?  
Where is the wave that will carry me  
A little closer to you?  
Where is the wave that will carry me  
A little closer to you?
