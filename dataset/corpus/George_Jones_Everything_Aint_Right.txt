I'm gonna build a private graveyard  
On the outskirts of town  
And if my baby don't get home tonight  
I'm a-gonna lower her down  
'Cause it ain't right  
Lord, no, everything ain't right  
  
I saw her out just the other night  
She was really on a spree  
She was makin' love to some other guy  
Right there in front of me  
That ain't right  
Uh-huh, no, everything ain't right  
  
But I'm a-gonna buy her pretty things  
And try to change her mind  
'Cause I gotta have her with me tonight  
I need her lovin' all of the time  
My heart ain't right  
Lord, no, everything ain't right  
  
I could build the highest bridges  
Over waters deep and wide  
To have her love back with me again  
It would ease this pain inside  
The world ain't right  
Uh-huh, no, everything ain't right  
  
And I find myself in darkness  
You took away the light  
And I know there's never been a fool  
Like me, before tonight  
That ain't right  
Lord, no, everything ain't right  
  
But I think I'll write my will out  
And sign it before too long  
You ain't a-gonna spend my money, uh-huh  
Not after this poor boy's gone  
That wouldn't be right  
Lord, no, everything ain't right
