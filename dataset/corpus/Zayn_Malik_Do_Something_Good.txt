[Verse 1]  
I smoke two joints before I play video games  
Then I get 10,000 points  
I flew around this planet only yesterday  
Because I am an alien  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I seen this galaxy and Milky Way  
I even watched the sun  
I got a J givin' me my light away  
Because I don't get drunk  
  
[Chorus]  
Let's do something good today, before it's too late  
Let's do something good today, before it's too late, this is our day  
Let's do something good today, before it's too late  
Said let's do something good today, before it's too late, before it's too late  
  
[Verse 2]  
Three more joints and I'm still playing video games  
Can't even count the points  
Play it 'til my fingers bleed  
Who said that tomorrow will be guaranteed?  
  
[Chorus]  
Let's do something good today, before it's too late  
Let's do something good today, before it's too late, this is our day  
Let's do something good today, before it's too late  
Said let's do something good today, before it's too late, before it's too late  
  
[Bridge]  
And then we fly away and we ain't running out of fuel  
I'm running off of you, I'm running off of you  
And then we fly away and then we fly away and we ain't running out of fuel  
I'm running off of you, I'm running off of you and then we fly  
  
[Chorus]  
Let's do something good today, before it's too late  
Let's do something good today, before it's too late, this is our day  
Let's do something good today, before it's too late  
Said let's do something good today, before it's too late, before it's too late
