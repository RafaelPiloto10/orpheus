A vision, a flash of light  
A gift we were given, within each other's dreams  
We lived in the gardens of Avalon  
Together, believed that we could live there forever  
Then it faded away  
Forgetting, we wandered too far from the land we'd known  
  
Of all the lonely people, you're among the lucky few  
If it comes even once in a life  
  
[Chorus]  
Love is a lesson hard to learn  
It's never as easy to return  
But if you're willing to go on  
We'll find a way back to Avalon  
  
Avalon  
  
They had it, it wasn't far away or imagined  
He held her in his arms and planned it all  
The towers of Avalon  
They warned him, he only turned around for a moment  
And everything had changed  
He noticed the sun on her face as she turned away  
  
All the lonely people, you're among the lucky few  
If it comes even once in a life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And when you come to know the miracle, it's mystical  
When someone else's heart is in your hand  
I learned too late, now I must try and find a way back home, ohh  
  
Here is a lesson hard to learn  
It's never as easy to return  
But if you're willing to go on  
We'll find a way back to Avalon  
  
(Avalon)  
We gotta go back, someday we'll get it back  
(Avalon)  
We gotta get it back  
(Avalon)  
Somebody show me a way, somebody tell me the way  
(Avalon)  
  
(Avalon)  
We gotta go back, someday we'll get it back  
(Avalon)  
We gotta get it back  
(Avalon)  
Somebody show me a way, somebody tell me the way  
(Avalon)
