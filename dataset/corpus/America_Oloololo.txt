Lala Salama  
To the Masai Mara  
And asante sana  
Kichwa Tembo  
I'm going Oloololo  
Back to the world where I'm from  
Soon I'll be flying solo  
On a heading that follows the sun  
Oloololo, Oloololo, 'loololo  
'Cause I've been down from Nairobi  
Southeast of Kisumu  
To the waiting savanna  
Like a place that I once knew  
And the river was flowing  
While the crocodile baked in the sun  
With the elephant knowing  
That a change had already begun  
Oloololo, Oloololo, 'loololo  
Oloololo, Oloololo  
(Lala Salama) Oloololo (To the Masai Mara)  
(And asante sana) Oloololo (To Kichwa Tembo)
