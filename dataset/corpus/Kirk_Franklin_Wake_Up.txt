[Lead:]  
Heavenly Father, its me once again. Your humble servant in your presence, with
this fire burning deep down within.  
  
I begin, by recognizing your power and also your grace, and how your children
become one when we come before your glorious face.  
  
When you look down from your throne I wonder what is it exactly that you see
that keeps someone like you so patient with someone like me  
  
I'm free!!, Not because of some self-rightous attempt on my part but, because
of your unconditional love that you gave straight from your heart, Let's
start:  
  
[Chorus:]  
All that I have I give to you, all that I am is because of you, If you were to
leave us what would we do? We need you right now!  
  
Just like the forest needs the rain, just like there's no joy without some
pain
