Fear the hearts of men are failing  
These our latter days we know  
The great depression now is spreading  
God's word declared it would be so  
  
I'm going where there's no depression  
To a better land that's free from care  
I'll leave this world of toil and trouble  
My home's in heaven  
I'm going there  
  
In this dark hour, midnight nearing  
The tribulation time will come  
The storms will hurl the midnight fear  
And sweep lost millions to their doom  
  
I'm going where there's no depression  
To a better land that's free from care  
I'll leave this world of toil and trouble  
My home's in heaven  
I'm going there  
  
I'm going where there's no depression  
To a better land that's free from care  
I'll leave this world of toil and trouble  
My home's in heaven  
I'm going there
