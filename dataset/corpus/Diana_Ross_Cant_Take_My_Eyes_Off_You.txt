You're just too good to be true  
Can't keep my eyes off of you  
You feel like Heaven to touch  
And I wanna hold you so much  
  
At long last love has arrived  
And I thank God I'm alive  
You're just too good to be true  
Can't take my eyes off of you  
  
Pardon the way that I stare  
There's nothing else to compare  
The sight of you leaves me weak  
Oh, and there are no words left to speak  
  
But if you feel like I feel  
Please let me know that it's real  
You're just too good to be true  
I can't take my eyes off of you  
  
I love you, baby  
And if it's quite all right  
I need you, baby  
To warm the lonely nights  
I love you, baby  
Trust in me when I say  
  
Oh, baby, baby  
Don't bring me down, I pray  
Oh, pretty baby  
Now that I found you, stay  
And let me love you, baby  
Let me love you, baby  
Let me love you, baby  
Let me love you
