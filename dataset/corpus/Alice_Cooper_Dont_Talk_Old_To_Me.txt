Don't tell me I should, I better, I can  
Don't talk old to me  
Don't shake that finger in my face no more  
'Cause I might bite it off and spit it on the floor  
Better get secure get my life insured  
Buy a house and car that run  
Better sell my bike, my leather coats  
Those city auto parts and all my guns  
Don't talk old to me  
(Don't talk old to me)  
Don't talk so old to me  
(Don't talk old to me)  
Don't talk old to me tonight, tonight  
(Don't talk old tonight)  
Don't tell me I should, I better, I can

Don't talk so old to me  
(Don't talk old to me)  
Don't talk old to me tonight, tonight

Don't talk old to me

Don't talk old to me tonigh

Don't bark and I won't bite  
Won't bite, don't you bark
