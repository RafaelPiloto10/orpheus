Standing alone in a storm of life  
Without any way to turn  
Tears are falling down like rain  
From the lessons that I have learned  
  
And I wish that I could fly away  
On the wings of a great golden bird  
To a place where there are no unhappy days  
And there are no unhappy words  
  
Yes, I wish that I could fly away  
To a land beyond this pain  
And lay my dreams on a mountain top  
And wash my mind in the rain  
  
Burned by the fire of an untrue love  
My heart is as cold as a stone  
And I know for sure that the road of life  
Is no place to travel alone  
  
And I wish that I could fly away  
To a land beyond this pain  
And lay my dreams on a mountain top  
And wash my mind in the rain  
  
Yes, I wish that I could fly away  
To a land beyond this pain  
And lay my dreams on a mountain top  
And wash my mind in the rain ?
