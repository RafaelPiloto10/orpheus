[Chorus]  
I never promised you a happy ending  
You never said you wouldn't make me cry  
But summer love will keep us warm long after  
Our autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye, autumn goodbye.  
  
Thinking of you  
And the love of our lives  
In the sweet summertime  
so sad but true (so true, so true)  
We must leave it behind in our heart in our mind.  
From April through September  
Bittersweet was the love that we shared don't forget I remember  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
Memories can make (they can make)  
But my heart has a place for the smile on your face  
And maybe someday (someday)  
We can be more than friends love will find us again.  
Red leaves and blue tomorrows  
Time will give back the love that we shared on the time that we borrowed  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
From April through September  
Bittersweet was the love that we shared don't forget I remember  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
We leave behind, the sum my time, our hearts our minds  
They will remind, we won't forget  
The day we met  
The day we cried ooh  
Autumn goodbye  
  
[Chorus]
