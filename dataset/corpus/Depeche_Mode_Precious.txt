Precious and fragile things  
Need special handling  
My God what have we done to You?  
  
We always try to share  
The tenderest of care  
Now look what we have put You through  
  
[Chorus]  
Things get damaged  
Things get broken  
I thought we'd manage  
But words left unspoken  
Left us so brittle  
There was so little left to give  
  
Angels with silver wings  
Shouldn't know suffering  
I wish I could take the pain for you  
  
If God has a master plan  
That only He understands  
I hope it's your eyes He's seeing through  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I pray you learn to trust  
Have faith in both of us  
And keep room in your heart for two  
  
[Chorus]
