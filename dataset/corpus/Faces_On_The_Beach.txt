I don't care who is watching  
Don't mind what the surfing heads might say  
And though I may not be no Charlie Atlas  
Gonna take my shirt off anyway  
Now skin and bones sits easy on the high tide  
And I'm not one for castles in the sand  
I've seen a girl I once knew from the East Side  
I think I spy a bottle in her hand  
I think I spy a bottle in her hand  
I don't need to know your birthday  
'cause what you tell her I don't claim to be  
There's a place I know of called the Tick Tock  
Won't you come and take a walk with me  
Won't you come and take a walk with me  
Didn't take too much hard work to get her  
Melted like a chocolate in my arms  
If you had ever seen it better  
It never did the scenery no harm  
Never did the scenery no harm
