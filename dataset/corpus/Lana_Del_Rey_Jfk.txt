His smile like a million roses bathed in rock 'n' roll  
Ours was the greatest love story ever told  
Throat like an angel with a voice that was made of gold  
That's my baby  
  
He was the king of the town with a crown that would never fall  
A heart that would beat like a base for his baby doll  
One in a million, inimitable song  
That's my baby  
Young or old, summer or cold  
Young or old, summer or cold  
You've got a way like jfk  
When you pull it the way that you move it  
Spins me around like a record, baby  
And you've got a soul like no one I know  
You're so erratic the way you see through that shit  
Breaks my heart and it drives me crazy  
He was the king of the town with a crown that would never fall  
A heart like a base that would beat for his baby doll  
Mind like a diamond, an inimitable song  
That's my baby  
Young or old, summer or cold  
Young or old, summer or cold  
You've got a way like jfk  
When you pull it the way that you move it  
Spins me around like a record, baby  
And you've got a soul like no one I know  
You're so neurotic the way you see through that shit  
Breaks my heart and it drives me crazy  
It drives me crazy  
You've got it and I want it  
Wild summer nights in July, funny  
You know that you can always come home to the one who gave you your name  
'Cause I see a light in your eyes  
It's so bright and the skies, they open wide for you  
So come to me, my baby  
You've got a way like jfk  
When you pull it the way that you move it  
Spins me around like a record, baby  
And you've got a soul like no one I know  
You're so erratic the way you see through play that shit  
Breaks my heart and it drives me crazy  
It drives me crazy  
It drives me crazy  
Crazy
