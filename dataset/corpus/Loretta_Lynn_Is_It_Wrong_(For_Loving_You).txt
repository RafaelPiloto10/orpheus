Is it wrong for loving you is it wrong for being true  
Tell me darling tell me please is it wrong  
Have I waited for so long has your love for me gone  
Is it wrong is it wrong for loving you  
  
Way down deep inside my heart you're the only love sweetheart  
Yes the only true love I ever knew  
But I ask myself inside no need telling myself lies  
Is it wrong is it wrong for loving you  
[ piano - steel ]  
Is it wrong for loving you..
