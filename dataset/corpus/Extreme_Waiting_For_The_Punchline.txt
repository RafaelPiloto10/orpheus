You might say hey, I lost my sense of humor  
I'm quite surprised I didn't lose it sooner  
Why waste your breath on anything less  
Then talk so trivial  
As a man who ran out of material  
  
Chorus:  
Why did the chicken go across the road  
To get to the other side  
I'm still waiting for the punchline  
Whoever said the grass always grows  
Greener on the other lied  
I'm still waiting for the punchline  
  
The good ol' days I was known to wear a smile  
Like all good things they've gone out of style  
I will admit, usually a quick wit  
I found bemusing  
What used to be, no longer are amusing  
  
Chorus:  
  
It's nothing that you said,  
No nothing that you did  
Must have been a bad joke,  
That's gone over my head  
What me worry, another tragedy  
The latter plus time, equals comedy  
  
Why can't I get to the other side
