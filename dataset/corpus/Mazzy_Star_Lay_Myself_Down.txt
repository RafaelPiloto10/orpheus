Just like that, she follows me  
My wings under her tree  
She says one thing and that's just enough  
It doesn't matter how much  
  
Would I forget?  
Lay myself down  
Just to regret  
And that's all  
Would I forget?  
  
I'll go with her  
I'll never know how far, how long  
She keeps a diamond inside her door  
She doesn't have a clue  
  
Would I forget?  
Lay myself down  
Just to regret  
And that's all  
  
Would I forget?  
Lay myself down  
Just to regret  
And that's all  
  
And that's all  
And that's all
