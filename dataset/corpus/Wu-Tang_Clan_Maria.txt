But whoever she gonna do anyway  
But bust it, bust it though baby, bust it  
Who else, who else is gonna  
It's dedicated to all you bitches  
  
Knew this bitch named Traj, she had a hella fine ashcan ass  
Blew my hole in the past  
Niggarette gave me gonorrhea  
Pussy dick to the tippy toe like ballerina  
Boy you shoulda seen her  
She had a Babyface creamer Purina's  
Called up talkin' Tina  
I put my dick in a womb  
She blew my head like a balloon  
I had her walkin' on the moon  
  
Yo, I seen you at the five and dime wastin' your time  
Oh you shine, I'm lookin' at your ass from behind  
You walked by smellin' like watermelon  
You might make me a felon, my eyeballs swellin'  
My nuts start yellin', excuse my prick  
Wanna have a talk with you, I'm sick  
My medicine is can I walk with you, fantasy  
After that we can cheat  
Laid on the bed, handcuffed with hard meat  
Long stroke smack it, smack it then broke  
Nothin' can't stop my continuous poke  
Compound porno flick music  
Daddy came with it when I wrote it  
  
Dirt Dog be bouncin' on bitches like frog  
I pollute the air up like smog, bitch  
I'm up my jacuzzi, peepin' this smoothie  
My bitch is a floozy, Dirt Dog ain't choosy  
Pussy move me, pretty black dick up in the booty  
I like it muddy or swampy  
By now you find your ass up shitty creeky  
Don't got no fuckin' room me and my momma and my TV  
Blackberry squeeze, bitch who a tease  
Titties small, I got used to the squeeze  
Fuck that shit, I'm through with this bitch  
Old hen please can't get a bank of these welfare cheese  
Now to blow fifty G's overseas  
I'm doin' the breeze, in my 850  
  
Suicidal  
She been in more hotels than bibles  
Idle worshippin' bitch wasn't the type to make bridle  
Sprung, on how the bitch maneuvered her tongue  
From the top of his dick, to the bottom of his ass split  
I told the God to jet quick this wicked bitch was a harlot  
But had him trapped up inside the Charlotte Web  
She wasn't choosy fucked for a movie and a loose leaf  
Cigarette, pussy stay wet and juicy like lemons  
Big ass in tight denim  
Had the most faithful niggas sendin' her gifts to women and enjoyed  
To watch relationships get destroyed  
This unemployed welfare bitch was non-void and shameless  
Her attitude was blameless  
Even though she had a hundred dicks on her name list  
Her obsession, caused niggas to get, the ass cheek injection  
The bitched lied, said she had urinary tract infection  
I tried to warn em, and bomb em, but she conned em  
Wanted niggas to fuck her raw dog without no condom  
  
You people are all trying to achieve the impossible  
(That's exactly what we've done)  
But you'll fail, and you'll all die  
(If we die, the next generation will fight them too  
And the one after them, for as long as they must  
And eventually we shall succeed)
