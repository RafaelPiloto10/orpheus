Even tho' I know it's only  
Me and my dreams  
That drive me so let me go please  
Let me go onto tomorrow  
One day at a time  
Now I know the only foe is time  
22,000 days, 22,000 days it's not a lot,  
It's all you got 22,000 days  
22,000 nights, 22,000 nights, it's all you know  
So start the show and this time  
Feel the flow and get it right  
Now the time when I first saw you is over and gone  
Then I knew my life with you would go on  
Knowing you so much longer  
I've change in mind change for you  
You have changed to mine  
22,000 days, 22,000 days it's not a lot,  
It's all you got 22,000 days

So start the show and this time  
Feel the flow and get it right  
Everybody knows, it always shows  
Wasting time's an aggravation  
Got no time for confrontation  
You want to take a lot  
By love by law or stealth  
Time's the only real wealth you have got  
Even tho' I know it's only me and my dreams  
That drive me so let me go please  
Let me go onto tomorrow  
One day at a time  
Now I know the only foe is time  
22,000 days, 22,000 days it's not a lot,  
It's all you got 22,000 days  
22,000 nights, 22,000 nights, it's all you know  
So start the show 22,000 days  
22,000 days, 22,000 days it's not a lot,  
It's all you got 22,000 days  
22,000 nights, 22,000 nights, it's all you know  
So start the show 22,000 ways
