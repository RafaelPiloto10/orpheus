This is the story of our first teacher  
Shetland made her jumpers  
And the devil made her features  
Threw up her bands when my mum said our names  
Embroidered all her stories with slanderous claims  
It's over and done with  
  
This is the story of losing my virginity  
I held my breath and the bed held a trinity  
People I'm making no claims to a mystery  
But sometimes it seems like  
My sex life's all history  
I'm not saying these events didn't  
Touch our lives in any way  
But, ah, they didn't make the impression  
That some people say  
  
This is the story of watching a man dying  
The subjects unpopular  
But I don't feel like lying  
When I think of it now I acted like a sinner  
I just washed my bands  
Then I went for my dinner.
