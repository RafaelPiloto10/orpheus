I took a house by the water  
Took a man on a mountainside  
Pretty house by the water  
Lovely lover by the waterside  
Last time I saw that man  
He hung down his head and cried  
  
Corrina, Corrina  
Do you have to go  
Corrina, Corrina  
Tell me why do you have to go  
Just made me come to love you girl  
Now you pack your things and go  
Leave me this bird that whistles  
Leave me this bird that sings  
  
I got a bird that whistles  
I got a bird that's singin'  
If I don't have you darlin'  
Birds don't mean nothin'
