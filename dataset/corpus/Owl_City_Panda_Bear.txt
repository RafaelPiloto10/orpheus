I'm moving to Tokyo  
'cause I'm tired of San Francisco  
My contracts are finally void  
And I am getting out  
On houses and building tops  
I swallow the beams and sundrops  
If my echos could reach your ears  
Then I could save my calls  
What happens when I'm above  
The east river when you are in love  
We're staring at all these lights  
And I am going blind  
Fill all of the navy yards  
With hard working security guards  
'cause the numbers are wearing off  
My plastic access cards  
How can I begin to say  
I feel better off when we stay  
In Paris on winter nights  
Beneath the snowy veil  
Content like a panda bear  
Still breathing the fresh mountain air  
I'll put on a diving tank  
And sing when I inhale
