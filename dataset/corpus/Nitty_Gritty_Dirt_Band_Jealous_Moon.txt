Saw her there in the fading light  
In full bloom on a summer night  
Nothing but the man in the moon  
Was standing in my way  
  
I was drunk on the warm sweet air  
Tangled up in her raven hair  
I should've known but I didn't care  
She'd be gone by the light of day  
  
Cause her eyes were shining brighter  
Than the light of the jealous moon  
And the stars fell all around her  
Well did I see you smilin'  
When the morning came too soon  
Did I see you smilin'  
Jealous moon, jealous moon  
  
Now the sun dances across my room  
I can smell the wine and her soft perfume  
The only thing that lets me know  
That an angel wasn't here  
  
You know I had this crazy dream  
She flew away on stolen wings  
But all she took was a pair of jeans  
When see saw that the coast was clear  
  
And her eyes were shining brighter  
Than the light of the jealous moon  
And the stars fell all around her  
Well did I see you smilin'  
When the morning came too soon  
Did I see you smilin'  
Jealous moon, jealous moon  
  
And her eyes were shining brighter  
Than the light of the jealous moon  
And the stars they fell all around her  
Well I thought I saw you smilin'  
When the morning came too soon  
Did I see you smilin'  
Jealous moon, jealous moon  
Jealous moon, jealous moon
