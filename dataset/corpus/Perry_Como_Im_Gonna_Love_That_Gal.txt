I'm gonna love that girl  
Like she's never been loved before,  
I'm gonna show that girl  
She's the fella that I adore.  
When she's in my arms again,  
Our dreams will all come true,  
The years between might never have been,  
We'll start our lives anew,  
I'm gonna kiss that girl  
Like she's never been kissed before,  
And tho' I miss that girl,  
She's the fella I'm waitin' for  
We'll never part again,  
She'll hold my heart again  
Forever and ever more  
I'm gonna love that girl  
Like she's never been loved before.
