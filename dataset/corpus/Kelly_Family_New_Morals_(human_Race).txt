Some of our doctors I think are acting odd  
Cause cloning humans I do believe is playing God  
I can't believe what's happening with the animals  
What good is mass production if now we have mad cows disease  
Please, no more, please stop all these wars.  
  
The human race is committing suicide  
Everyone one of us is playing a little part  
There's a real bad disease spreading worldwide  
If it doesn't infect you physically  
It will creep into your heart  
Creep into your heart  
  
How can a state execute a person  
In the name of justice but justice isn't done with murder  
Modern society isn't based on family  
Without foundation we turn into a hopeless generation  
Please, no more, please stop all these wars.  
  
The human race is committing suicide  
Everyone one of us is playing a little part  
There's a real bad disease spreading worldwide  
If it doesn't infect you physically  
It will creep into your heart  
Creep into your heart  
  
Wouldn't it be nice if we would be like children  
Playing soccer all day and building crazy tree houses  
Please no more, I'm begging you to stop all these wars  
  
The human race is committing suicide  
Everyone one of us is playing a little part  
There's a real bad disease spreading worldwide  
If it doesn't infect you physically  
It will creep into your heart  
Creep into your heart  
  
The new morals nowadays  
Yeah, they are pretty crazy  
I hope they will change  
Cause otherwise, otherwise  
I'm out of here
