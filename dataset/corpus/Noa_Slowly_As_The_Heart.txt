Lyrics: Leah Goldberg  
Music: Achinoam Nini  
  
Transliteraion:  
Ulai kan nigmeret darki  
Al hasaf hashalev.  
Notfim kochavim yerukim  
Le'at -- keholem halev.  
  
Beivshat anafim yeveshah,  
Birkat shlomim:  
Haetsim haktanim bachorshah  
Chiku li kol hayamim.  
  
Mah muzar shebikashti otcha  
Bidrachim larov,  
Ad shebati al saf beitcha  
Vehu koh karov.  
  
Translation:  
Perhaps it is here that my road ends  
On the verge of the serene  
Greenish stars drop to my feet  
Slowly as the heart will beat  
  
A pile of brittle autumn leaves  
Bid welcome, as they crack  
The small trees in the field have  
Always known that Id be back  
  
How strange that I have searched for you  
A thousand roads and more  
Until I found you  
And all this time  
You were right next door
