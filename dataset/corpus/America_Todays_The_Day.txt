Hold me close  
You turn nighttime into day  
And you're the most  
Brightest star that lights my way  
  
[Chorus]  
So come home to me now  
Cause it won't matter anyhow  
I've got this feeling that today's the day  
I've got this feeling today's the day  
  
Turn me out  
Turn me out on this fine day  
'Cause all about  
All the people like to play  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've got this feeling that today's the day  
I've got this feeling today's the day  
  
Hold me close  
You turn nighttime into day  
And you're the most  
Brightest star that lights my way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've got this feeling that today's the day  
I've got this feeling today's the day [Repeat: x3]
