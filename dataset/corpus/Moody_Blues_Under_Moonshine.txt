The dawn crept into by room  
And stole my dream  
Now I'll never know  
Just what it means  
Or what could have been  
Yet still I try to lie  
But I'm seen  
  
Under moonshine that's where I've been  
Under moonshine I'm clearly seen  
Under moonshine that's where I've been  
Under moonshine I'm clearly seen  
  
Creator of dreams that melt with the sun  
I'll send you the things this man has done  
He was a saint and a sinner rolled in one  
But I miss now that he's gone  
I sure miss him now that he's gone  
  
Sure I feel the pain  
Deep inside I pour like rain  
Remember when you smile  
Love's in your eyes  
  
The world keeps turning  
The grass still grows green  
The fruit on my tree  
Is the biggest you've ever seen  
Which way up you know when you're down  
They've gotta stand tall  
With your feet on the ground  
You must stand tall  
With your feet on the ground  
  
Or maybe I'm crazy  
Also they say I'm lazy  
But I'll have my days  
When I do as I please  
For you won't see the woods  
While you're a tree  
No you'll never see the woods  
While you're a tree  
  
Yes I'm crazy  
Also they say I'm lazy  
But I'll have my days  
When I do as I please  
You won't see the woods  
While you're a tree  
No you'll never see the woods  
While you're a tree
