Yes  
You know I had to make a weed song for the album, bitch  
This Smoke-A-Lot on mine, ya dig  
I stay puffin lah, ya dig  
What  
What what  
[ VERSE 1: Yukmouth ]  
When I wake up in the morning I'm always puffin, my friend  
Before a nigga finished ???? I'm rollin up one again  
Stuff ???? again cause I love puffin, my friend  
I check the map cause I keep smokin and won't fuck again  
So now I hop in the big body Benz, my friend  
Bend a corner to the weed spot with ends to spend  
Park the Benz, jump out like 'what's up, my friend?'  
He plugged me with the chronic buds that make mi platinum teeth grin  
Let us begin: why, what, when or where and when  
A nigga spend so much cheese on this weed, my friend  
Cause I'm a fiend, my friend, a dopefiend, my friend  
Plus all around the world smokin weed make friends  
From Italy to Japan smokin weed make friends  
They don't know my language but understand my weed, my friend  
From here to Amsterdam smokin weed make friends  
Smoke Afghanistan hashis overseas, my friend  
Come again  
[ CHORUS: Benzalino ]  
Lah lah  
Always seen me smokin lah lah  
I'm always puffin on lah lah  
Always seen me smokin lah lah  
I'm always puffin on lah lah  
[ VERSE 2: Yukmouth ]  
Everywhere a nigga go I'm smokin 'dro, my friend  
Mi like to blow and then mi blow until mi need mo' again  
And so I go again, go and get the endo, my friend  
Hit the liquor store and get the optimols, my friend  
Come again, I take a piss test on parole, my friend  
That's why mi keep ???? golden seals and blunts pre-rolled, my friend  
Cause I can't let the p.o. kknow that I ???? smoke it again  
Mi on mi third strike and mi no want to go to the pen  
I tell em mi don't like the drugs, they like me, my friend  
Ecstacy, mi even roll up shrooms with weed, my friend  
Mi tell em mi don't like the drugs, they like me, my friend  
Plus all around the world smokin weed make friends  
The bodega man he love me cause I spend, spend, spend  
I buy QP's ???? purchase and a twenty-twen-twen  
I say the weed man he love me cause I spend big ends  
He plugged me up with somethin lovely, made mi platinum teeth grin  
Come again  
[ CHORUS: Benzalino ]  
[ VERSE 3: Yukmouth ]  
When mi travel out of town I be on missions, my friend  
I don't discriminate on bammer, let me hit it again  
Then mi go ask him where he get it and cop my own, my friend  
Cause I'm a nigga that smoke zones to the dome, my friend  
Come again, let's take it back when I was young, my friends  
I used to tell em not to smoke, it make you dumb, my friend  
You're gonna flunk ???? smokin blunts, my friend  
Now I'm that nigga rollin dutch after dutch, my friend  
Check it out, that's how it began, on the bench, my friend  
He told me you can hit this, my man, if you just pitch in that 10  
And they some fiends, some dopefiends, my friend  
They do everything from fry to codeines, my friend  
So I'm like, "Whoa, just let me buy some trees, my friend  
So I can be about my business and let you be, my friend"  
The principle caught me chokin smokin trees, my friend  
He told me: "Let me hit that, boy" - smokin weed make friends  
Come again  
[ CHORUS: Benzalino ]
