I work all night  
For one more day that I can say I'm all alone, alone  
I just need time  
And I will say what I believe and I'll come home, home  
And all I know  
  
[Chorus]  
I never thought I would wake up in bed  
Watching the world coming down on my head  
I'd sleep like a dog if you would never had said  
This is the world coming down on your head  
  
As life flies by  
I'm not sure how I'm gonna do this all again, again  
So write my line  
I write this down and I'm just trying to find the end, the end  
And all I know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You gave it to me  
I remember it well  
You got the world coming down on your head  
There's nothing to fight for, it's already dead  
And this is the world coming down on my head  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm not gonna swallow now that I'm fed  
'cause I want the world coming down on my head  
I'm just gonna find out you're already dead  
And that was the world coming down on your head
