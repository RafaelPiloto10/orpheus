Alone at last in a hideaway far away  
From all the worries in the world.  
We share each other  
While the suns going down,  
Not another soul around,  
Alone at last,  
You and I.  
  
Sunshine, plenty of space and time, heady wine  
For thirsty souls like yours and mine.  
We come together  
Like the sea and the sand  
In a very private wonderland,  
Alone at last,  
You and I  
Wave goodbye  
To the crowded nights  
And city lights we left behind.  
We love the dreams we share  
And dare to live the dream.  
  
The sea in her serenity, silently  
Casts a spell on you and me.  
We share each other  
While the suns going down  
Not another soul around  
Alone at last,  
Alone at last,  
You and I.  
  
We share each other  
While the suns going down,  
Not another soul around,  
Alone at last,  
Alone at last,  
You and I.
