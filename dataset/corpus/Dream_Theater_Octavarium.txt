I never wanted to become someone like him so secure  
Content to live each day just like the last  
I was sure I knew that  
This was not for me  
And I wanted so much more  
Far beyond what I could see  
So I swore that I'd  
Never be someone like him  
  
So many years have passed  
Since I proclaimed  
My independence  
My mission  
My aim  
And my vision  
So secure  
Content to live each day like it's my last  
It's wonderful to know  
That I could be  
Something more than what I dreamed  
Far beyond what I could see  
Still I swear that I'm  
Missing out this time  
  
As far as I could tell  
There's nothing more I need  
But still I ask myself  
Could this be everything  
Then all I swore  
That I would never be was now  
So suddenly  
The only thing  
I wanted  
To become  
To be someone just like him  
  
A doctor sitting next to me  
He asks me how I feel  
Not sure I understand his questioning  
He says I've been away a while  
But thinks he has cured me  
From a state of catatonic sleep  
  
For 30 years  
Where have I been?  
Eyes open  
But not getting through to me  
  
Medicate me  
Infiltrate me  
Side effects appear  
As my conscience slips away  
  
Medicate me  
Science failing  
Conscience fading fast  
Can't you stop what's happening  
  
A higher dosage he prescribes  
But there's no guarantee  
I feel it starting to take over me  
I tell them not to be ashamed  
There's no one who's to blame  
A second shot  
A brief awakening  
  
I feel the relapse  
Can't break free  
Eyes open  
But not getting through to me  
  
Medicate me  
Infiltrate me  
Side effects appear  
As my conscience slips away  
  
Medicate me  
Science failing  
Conscience fading fast  
Can't you stop what's happening?  
  
Sailing on the seven seize the day tripper diem's ready  
Jack the ripper owens wilson phillips and my supper's ready  
Lucy in the sky with diamond dave's not here I come to save the  
Day for nightmare cinema show me the way to get back home again  
  
Running forward  
Falling back  
Spinning round and round  
Looking outward  
Reaching in  
Scream without a sound  
  
Leaning over  
Crawling up  
Stumbling all around  
Losing my place  
Only to find I've come full circle  
  
Flying off the handle with careful with  
That axe Eugene gene the dance machine  
Messiah light my fire gabba gabba  
Hey hey my my generation's home again  
  
Running forward  
Falling back  
Spinning round and round  
Looking outward  
Reaching in  
Scream without a sound  
  
Leaning over  
Crawling up  
Stumbling all around  
Losing my place  
Only to find I've come full circle  
  
Our deadly sins feel his mortal wrath  
Remove all obstacles from our path  
  
Asking questions  
Search for clues  
The answer's been right in front of you  
  
Try to break through  
Long to connect  
Fall on deaf ears and failed muted breath  
  
Loyalty, trust, faith and desire  
Carries love through each darkest fire  
  
Tortured Insanity  
A smothering hell  
Try to escape but to no avail  
  
The calls of admirers  
Who claim they adore  
Drain all your lifeblood while begging for more  
  
Innocent victims of merciless crimes  
Fall prey to some madmen's impulsive designs  
  
Step after step  
We try controlling our fate  
When we finally start living it has become to late  
  
Trapped inside this Octavarium [Repeat: x4]  
  
V: RAZOR'S EDGE (19:59-24:00)  
We move in circles  
Balanced all the while  
On a gleaming razor's edge  
  
A perfect sphere  
Colliding with our fate  
This story ends where it began
