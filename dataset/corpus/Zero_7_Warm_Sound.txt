Faith sealer  
I don't feel you  
Don't hear you speak  
  
Maybe  
Someone else will  
Help you to see  
  
Warm sound  
Falling slowly  
Takes the time away from me  
Warm sound  
Feeling no pain  
Taking the time away from me  
  
Fake feeler  
I see through you  
With my eyes closed  
  
Warm sound  
Falling slowly  
Takes the time away from me  
Warm sound  
Feeling no pain  
Taking the time away from me  
  
They can't tell me  
What they can't see  
How it feels here  
Just how it feels here  
Just how it feels here
