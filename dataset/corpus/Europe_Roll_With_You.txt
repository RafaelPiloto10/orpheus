When you feel out of place let me revolve around you  
When your light fades I have the strength to find you  
  
When what you're feeling is too intense  
When the darkness seems to draw you in I roll with you  
When you're so sorry and don't know why  
It came to be a sad time in your life I roll with you we'll get you through  
  
When you shut your eyes I'll show the images you're missing  
When you've heard enough through me you can listen  
  
When what you're feeling is too intense  
And the darkness seems to draw you in I roll with you  
And when you're crawling through all the hurt  
And you can't find a real friend in this world I roll with you  
We'll get you through  
  
When you feel out place  
Let me revolve around you
