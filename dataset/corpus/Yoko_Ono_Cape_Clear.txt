In cape clear  
I saw a little girl crying.  
She said she lost her teddy bear.  
Oh, then, I can get you another one,  
(No) no, (no) no, (no) no,  
(It was) it was (my) teddy bear.  
  
As we were talking  
A cloud passed and cast a pool of light around her.  
I saw that she was not a little girl. (oh)  
(No) no, (no) no, (no) no,  
(But you are) but you are.  
  
All my life I felt like I was in the middle of an ocean,  
Unable to touch the horizon.  
All my life I was floating on my emotion,  
Not knowing life had it's own motion.  
  
In cape clear  
I saw a little girl crying.
