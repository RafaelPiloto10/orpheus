Southern sun  
Ridin' high  
Winter nights  
Warm and dry  
You've earned your space buddy  
You've done your time  
How come you've got no  
Peace of mind  
  
Lots of work  
Everywhere  
Lots of money honey  
Gettin' your share  
The folks back home say  
They'd love to be in your shoes so  
How come you've got those  
Boomtown blues  
  
You can't miss that freezin' rain  
You'd have to be insane  
To head back north  
And go through all that again  
  
No chill in the air  
No morning dew  
No change of seasons  
The sky always seems so blue  
The earth ain't black and  
The wind ain't cold  
All of a sudden now  
You feel so old  
  
Somethin's wrong  
And it's cuttin' deep  
You're feelin' restless and it's  
Hard to sleep  
Look what you win but  
Look what you lose  
Stuck here in Heaven  
With these Boomtown blues
