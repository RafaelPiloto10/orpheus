The first time I saw you  
I knew there would be no other  
That tingle told me  
We were meant for one another  
I'm calling you  
1-2-3  
Buttered beauties of the negroid north  
Spread your glossy tallow on me  
Oiled wonder of the midnight forest  
Toss down your web on me  
She's got me by the tether  
(sticking it out)  
In simultated leather  
(sticking it out)  
I think she broke my tether  
See'mon keep on comin' on now
