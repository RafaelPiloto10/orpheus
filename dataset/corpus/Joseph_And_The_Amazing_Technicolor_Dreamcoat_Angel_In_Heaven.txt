Father we've something to tell you, a story of our time. A tragic but  
inspiring tale, of manhood in its prime. You know you had a dozen sons?  
Well now that's, not quite true. But feel no sorrow, do not grieve, he  
would not want you to.  
  
There's one more Angel in Heaven, there's one more star in the sky.  
Joseph we'll never forget you. It's tough but we're gonna get by.  
  
There's one less place at our table. There's one more tear in my eye.  
But Joseph the things that you stood fer, like truth and light never die.  
When I think of his last great battle, a lump comes to my throat.  
It takes a man who knows no fear to wrestle with a goat.  
His blood-stained coat is tribute to his final sacrifice. His body may  
be past it's peak but his soul's in paradise.  
  
So long little Jo!  
Adios Buckeroo!  
Ten four good buddy...  
  
There's one less place at our table. There's one more tear in my eye.  
But Joseph the things that you stood fer, like truth and light never die!  
Carve his name with pride and courage, let no tear be shead.  
If he had not laid down his life, we all would now be dead.
