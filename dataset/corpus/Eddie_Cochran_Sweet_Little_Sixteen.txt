They're really rockin' on bandstands, Philadelphia, P. A.  
Deep in the heart of Texas, way down to Frisco bay  
All over St. Louis, way down to New orleans  
All the cats wanna dance with sweet little sixteen  
Sweet little sixteen, got the growin' up blues  
Tight dresses and lipstick, sportin' high heel shoes  
Oh, but tomorrow morning, she'll have to change her trend  
Go back to bein' just sixteen and back in class again
