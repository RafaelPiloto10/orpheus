If I want some beer  
I don't want to hear  
How I missed the show  
'Cause I drink to slow  
Pass me the beer bong  
It won't take very long  
For me to put down  
This torpedo to the ground  
Drinking beer is too slow  
Beer bong is the way to go  
To go, to go  
Don't drink too slow  
Beer bong, Beer bong  
Beer bong, Beer bong  
If I want some beer  
I don't want to hear  
How I missed the show  
'Cause I drink to slow  
Pass me the beer bong  
It won't take very long

This torpedo to the ground  
Drinking beer is too slow  
Beer bong is the way to go  
To go, to go  
Don't drink too slow  
Beer bong, beer, beer bong  
Bong, bong, bong
