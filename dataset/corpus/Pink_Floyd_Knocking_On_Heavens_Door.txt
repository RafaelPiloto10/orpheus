Momma, take this badge off me  
I can't use it anymore  
It's getting dark, too dark to see  
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door  
  
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door  
  
Momma, put my guns in the ground  
I can't shoot them anymore  
That long black cloud is coming down  
I Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door  
  
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah
