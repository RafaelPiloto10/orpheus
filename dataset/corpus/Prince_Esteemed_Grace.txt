Verse  
Who am that you care for me Lord  
Who am I that you are mindful of me Lord  
Oh who am I that you should give your life for me on d cross  
Oh grace, who am I that you should choose  
Living in my filthy state  
You found me out  
Set my feet on a rock to stay  
Took my yoke of sin  
And Nailed it to the cross  
By your finished works I recieve authority  
By your death and your rising  
I Proclaim my Victory  
Esteemed Grace.
