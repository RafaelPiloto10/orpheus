Look at the lady she's the one with the broken heart  
Even so she musn't know that I've loved her from the start  
She needs a friend now more than a new romance  
I'd love to take her in my arms but I can't take the chance  
  
Chorus  
Ooh it's such a sad sad story but there'll be a happy ending  
Just you wait and see what I can do, ooooh  
When you see a lady cryin' can you blame a guy for tryin'  
To move on in and make his dreams come true  
  
I gotta secret but I'm keeping it to myself  
I'm bored to tears when my heart hears that she loves someone else  
I tell her I'm sorry but it's really just a lie  
Cos every time he hurts her I'm so happy I could die  
  
Ooh it's such a sad sad story but there'll be a happy ending  
Just you wait and see what I can do, ooooh  
When you see a lady cryin' can you blame a guy for tryin'  
To move on in and make his dreams come true  
  
I love the lady and I want to make her smile  
I know she's lonely but it only hurts for a little while  
Soon as it's over you know the sun is gonna shine  
And when she's ready for someone new, guess who's first in line  
  
Ooh it's such a sad sad story but there'll be a happy ending  
Just you wait and see what I can do, ooooh  
When you see a lady cryin' can you blame a guy for tryin'  
To move on in and make his dreams come true  
  
Ooh it's such a sad sad story but there'll be a happy ending  
Just you wait and see what I can do, ooooh  
When you see a lady cryin' can you blame a guy for tryin'  
To move on in and make his dreams come true
