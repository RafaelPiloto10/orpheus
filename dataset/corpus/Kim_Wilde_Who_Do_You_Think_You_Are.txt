A long time ago, you promised yourself  
They're all gonna know me someday  
Well, you got what you wanted but look at you now  
You lost something good on the way  
So where did it go? Tell me, where did it go?  
But you wouldn't know  
Snap your fingers and somebody runs  
You don't care how they feel just as long as they come  
Got your head in the stars, now you've come this far  
Just who do you think you are?  
Now everything seems to be going your way  
And everyone loves what they see  
But you ruin it all with the things that you say  
So tell me, how does it feel?  
When you're all alone, how does it feel?  
You're alone, nothing is real  
Snap your fingers and somebody runs  
You don't care how they feel just as long as they come  
Got your head in the stars, now you've come this far  
Just who do you think you are?  
You believe a ridiculous lie  
You can't see you've become all the things you despise  
But I know who you are and you've gone too far  
Just who do you think you are?  
You can keep all your dreams  
But you don't have to lose yourself  
'Cause one day, you're gonna break  
When the face in the mirror looking back at you  
Is a stranger that you can't place, oh, oh  
Just who do you think you are?  
Snap your fingers and somebody runs  
You don't care how they feel just as long as they come  
Got your head in the stars, now you've come this far  
Just who do you think you are?  
You believe a ridiculous lie  
You can't see you've become all the things you despise  
But I know who you are and you've gone too far  
Just who do you think you are?  
Oh, oh, oh, just who do you think you are?
