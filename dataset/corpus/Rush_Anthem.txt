Know your place in life is where you want to be  
Don't let them tell you that you owe it all to me  
Keep on looking forward, no use in looking 'round  
Hold your head above the ground and they won't bring you down  
  
Anthem of the heart and anthem of the mind  
A funeral dirge for eyes gone blind  
We marvel after those who sought  
New wonders in the world, wonders in the world,  
Wonders in the world they wrought  
  
Live for yourself, there's no one else  
More worth living for  
Begging hands and bleeding hearts will  
Only cry out for more  
  
Well, I know they've always told you  
Selfishness was wrong  
Yet it was for me, not you, I  
Came to write this song
