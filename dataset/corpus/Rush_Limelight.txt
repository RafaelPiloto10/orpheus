Living on a lighted stage  
Approaches the unreal  
For those who think and feel  
In touch with some reality  
Beyond the gilded cage  
  
Cast in this unlikely role,  
Ill-equipped to act  
With insufficient tact  
One must put up barriers  
To keep oneself intact  
  
Living in the limelight  
The universal dream  
For those who wish to seem  
  
Those who wish to be  
Must put aside the alienation  
Get on with the fascination  
The real relation  
The underlying theme  
  
Living in a fish eye lens  
Caught in the camera eye  
I have no heart to lie  
I can't pretend a stranger  
Is a long-awaited friend  
  
All the world's indeed a stage  
And we are merely players  
Performers and portrayer  
Each another's audience  
Outside the gilded cage  
  
Living in the limelight  
The universal dream  
For those who wish to seem  
  
Those who wish to be  
Must put aside the alienation  
Get on with the fascination  
The real relation  
The underlying theme
