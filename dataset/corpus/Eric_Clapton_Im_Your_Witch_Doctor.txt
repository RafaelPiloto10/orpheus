I'm your witchdoctor, got the evil eye,  
Got the power of the devil, I'm the conjurer guy.  
Gonna teach you love at the midnight hour,  
Gonna feel you burning like a passion flower.  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey hey, hey hey hey, hey.  
Hey hey, hey hey hey, hey.  
Your witchdoctor, your witchdoctor, got my eyes on you.  
  
I was born in the country and I lived in the trees.  
I got my voodoo from the birds and the bees.  
Gonna teach you love at the midnight hour,  
Gonna feel you burning, little passion flower.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm your witchdoctor, got the evil eye,  
Got the power of the devil, I'm the conjurer guy.  
Gonna teach you love at the midnight hour,  
Gonna feel you burning like a passion flower.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've got my mean old spell on you,  
I've got my mean old spell on you,  
Your witchdoctor, your witchdoctor, got my eyes on you.
