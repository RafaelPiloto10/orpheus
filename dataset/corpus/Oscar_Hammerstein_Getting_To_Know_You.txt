[Spoken] It's a very ancient saying,  
But a true and honest thought,  
That if you become a teacher,  
By your pupils you'll be taught.  
  
[Singing] As a teacher I've been learning --  
You'll forgive me if I boast --  
And I've now become an expert,  
On the subject I like most.  
  
[Spoken] Getting to know you.  
  
[Singing] Getting to know you,  
Getting to know all about you.  
Getting to like you,  
Getting to hope you'll like me.  
  
Getting to know you,  
Putting it my way,  
But nicely,  
You are precisely,  
My cup of tea.  
  
[Anna and the mothers]  
  
Getting to know you,  
Getting to know all about you.  
Getting to like you,  
Getting to hope you'll like me.  
  
Getting to know you,  
Putting it my way,  
But nicely,  
You are precisely,  
  
[Anna]  
  
My cup of tea.  
  
[All]  
  
Getting to know you,  
Getting to feel free and easy  
When I am with you,  
Getting to know what to say  
  
Haven't you noticed  
Suddenly I'm bright and breezy?  
Because of all the beauty and new  
Things I'm learning about you  
Day by day.  
  
Getting to know you,  
Getting to feel free and easy  
When I am with you,  
Getting to know what to say  
  
Haven't you noticed  
Suddenly I'm bright and breezy?  
Because of all the beautiful and new  
Things I'm learning about you  
Day... By... Day.
