Swimming on a skin as she moves to my direction  
Stop, begin, I was way beyond protection  
Go in a glance I was frozen when she found me  
Lost in a trance, as she wrapped her silk around me  
  
And as her body melted on mine  
She burned the memory of it on my mind  
  
Shame on me, I forgot to remember to forget  
Should have left her in my history  
And I feel like I'd be better off dead  
I forgot to remember  
  
Ice in the sky, on a... She whispered to me  
Rose colored lights hit me right where she knew me  
She took me half the way to paradise  
Then left me stranded as she waved goodbye  
  
Shame on me, I forgot to remember to forget  
Should have left her in my history  
And I feel like I'd be better off dead  
I forgot to remember  
  
Oh, didn't know until the moment's gone and the sentence fading  
Where she knows I'll always be  
Oh shame on me, I forgot to remember  
Left her in my history  
I feel like I'd be better off dead  
I forgot to remember  
I forgot to remember to forget  
I should have left her in my history  
I feel like I'd be better off dead  
I forgot to remember
