Heaven is a shadow of your live  
I'm a lonesome alcoholic for your kiss  
Should I sit around  
And wait  
Well I had a chance  
I hesitate  
To ask you for the pleasure of your company  
What would you say  
Would you think about it  
Would you think about it  
Right now  
  
I've been put upon  
I've been passed round  
For ever and I'm waiting for  
The thirteenth of never  
Should I swear to be true  
Should you give a damn  
What I say or do  
Well, I'm asking for the pleasure of your company  
What would you say  
Would you think about it  
Would you think about it  
Right now  
  
Love a cheat  
I've got everything you need  
And I'm asking for the pleasure of your company  
What do you say  
Baby oh  
Cause it's been a long time  
Baby  
Think about it
