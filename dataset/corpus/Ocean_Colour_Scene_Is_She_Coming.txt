Is she coming home, I'll leave the light on  
But through times and space she'll go  
If she's coming home she won't tell me  
And I wonder if I should know  
  
Wonder if I should feel something  
Wonder if I should know  
But it's dark in here  
  
Tip-toe softly do not wake her  
As she sleeps so very slow  
Dim the light on her day-dream  
But her dreams you'll never know  
  
See her fading dress and frame its colours  
For a memory you'll long to know  
Drape the covers in her bedroom  
But life freezes with melting snow  
  
Ah... Is she coming home...
