Shout praises to the holy One  
God makes us strong, we'll see His will be done  
From the highest place, He came to save us  
We stand in the power of His name  
Salvation's work in our lives proclaim  
Living from the kingdom of hope within us  
Shine Your light, be that city of light  
We're gonna shout out loud, it's time to let it out  
It's your life in me for all to see  
'Cause our God reigns always till the end of days  
We're gonna stand strong, stand tall  
'Cause Jesus Christ is Lord of all  
God colors, flowing through my life  
I'm not the same now my heart desires  
To see the whole world come to know You  
I'll shine my light, be that city of light  
We're gonna shout out loud, it's time to let it out  
It's your life in me for all to see  
'Cause our God reigns always till the end of days  
We're gonna stand strong, stand tall  
'Cause Jesus Christ is Lord of all  
Shout, shout, we're gonna let it out  
Shout, shout, we're gonna let it out  
Shout, shout, we're gonna shout, Jesus is Lord
