As stories go,  
This one's been told  
Another heart broken,  
Left out in the cold  
With one variation,  
The difference this time,  
This one is mine,  
Since you've been gone  
You've stolen my heart  
As for the rest of me  
I've fallen apart  
In my desperation  
My only prayer  
Handle with care  
'cause I don't know  
What to do  
Wasting my time,  
Wandering through  
Wondering why  
What's it all worth  
My last hour on earth  
My last hour  
So in the end  
You were the one  
Something so right  
Could never be wrong  
Without hesitation  
I'll tell you the truth  
I'm still waiting for you  
'cause I don't know  
What to do  
Wasting my time,  
Wandering through  
Wondering why  
What's it all worth  
My last hour on earth  
My last hour  
'cause I don't know  
What to do  
Wasting my time,  
Wandering through  
Wondering why  
What's it all worth  
It's worth everything  
Yeah my everything is you  
It's worth everything  
Yeah my everything is you  
It's worth everything  
Yeah my everything
