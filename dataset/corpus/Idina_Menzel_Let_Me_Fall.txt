It's October again  
Leaves are falling down like rain  
One more year's come and gone  
But nothing's changed  
Wasn't I supposed to be someone  
Who could face the things that I've been running from?  
  
Let me feel  
I don't care if I break down  
Let me fall  
Even if I hit the ground  
If I cry a little  
And die a little  
At least I know I lived  
Just a little  
Let me feel  
Let me fall  
  
I become much too good at being invincible  
I'm an expert at 'play it safe' and 'keep it cool'  
But I swear this is not who I'm meant to be  
I refuse to let my life fall over me  
  
Let me feel (let me feel)  
I don't care if I break down  
Let me fall (let me fall)  
Even if I hit the ground  
If I cry a little (cry)  
And die a little (die)  
At least I know I lived  
Just a little  
Let me feel  
Let me fall  
  
Yes, I'm gonna be someone (gonna be)  
If I take it as it comes  
If I face the things that I've been running from  
I've been running from  
  
Let me feel (let me feel)  
I don't care if I break down  
Let me fall (let me fall)  
Even if I hit the ground  
If I cry a little (cry)  
And die a little (die)  
At least I know I lived  
Just a little  
Let me feel  
Let me fall  
  
It's October again  
The leaves are falling down like rain  
Oh...
