When you gave your love to me, I never gave you chains.  
If you need to prove you're free.  
My love for you remains (you know my love stays)  
Love is not a prison cell.  
True love can never die  
There's nothing that you shouldn't tell  
You never have to lie (to me you shouldn't)  
  
But if you have to keep something inside you.  
You know I'll never want to steal it away  
  
I respect your territory.  
Hope there's room in world for me.  
Is there room in your mind to see.  
a doorway ? if you say  
  
Blood is pumping through my heart.  
And flowing through my veins.  
All it keeps me living for.  
The love that is sustains (You now I never).  
Time stopped when I saw your face.  
And if it start I'll cry  
The universe is in your smile.  
Is heaven in your eye ?  
  
But if you have to keep something inside you.  
You know I'll never want to steal it away  
  
I respect your territory.  
Hope there's room in your world for me.  
Is there room in your mind to see.  
a doorway ? if you say  
I respect your territory (you need your territory.)  
Hope there's room in your world for me (find a place in your world for me).  
Is there room in your mind to see (I want a doorway).  
A doorway ? if you say.  
  
I respect your territory (you need your territory.)  
Hope there's room in your world for me (keep a place in your mind for me ?).  
Is there room in your mind to see (I want a doorway).  
A doorway ? if you say.  
  
I know you need your territory (you need your territory.)  
Is there room in your world for me (Can't you see what it means to me ?).  
Hope there's room in your mind to see (I need a doorway).  
A doorway ? One fine day (I want a).  
  
I respect your territory (you need your territory.)  
Hope there's room in your world for me (Can't you find a place for me ?).  
Is there room in your mind to see.  
A doorway ? if you say (I want a doorway).  
  
I respect your territory (I need a territory.)  
Hope there's room in your world for me (Can't you find a place for me ?).  
Is there room in your mind to see (I want a doorway).  
A doorway ? (I want a, I want a, I want a doorway).  
If you say.
