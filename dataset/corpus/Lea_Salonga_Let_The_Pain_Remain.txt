Love comes, love goes  
But a certain feeling never lets me be  
Somehow I know  
Quite a part of me's unchanged since you've been gone  
Like a sturdy tree that's seen a thousand seasons  
I still shed my leaves in winter  
To grow them back in spring  
To welcome life again  
To welcome you  
So goes my life  
Still believing dreams of having you around  
Too bad, memories  
Feed the mind and not the heart where I want you to be  
So I ask myself what you have left behind for me  
To go on each day to live as if  
I had you once again  
What else is there that's real  
But all the pain that I feel?  
So let the pain remain forever in my heart  
For every throb it brings is  
One more moment spent with you  
I'll let the pain bring on the rain  
If that's the only way  
If there's no other way to be with you again  
So goes my life  
Still believing dreams of having you around  
Too bad, memories  
Feed the mind and not the heart where I want you to be  
So I ask myself what you have left behind for me  
To go on each day to live as if  
I had you once again  
What else is there that's real  
But all the pain that I feel?  
So let the pain remain forever in my heart  
For every throb it brings is  
One more moment spent with you  
I'll let the pain bring on the rain  
If that's the only way  
If there's no other way to be with you again  
Oooh...so let the pain remain forever in my heart  
For every throb it brings is  
One more moment spent with you  
I'll let the pain bring on the rain  
If that's the only way (if that's the only way)  
If there's no other way to be with you again
