It's time to end my holiday and bid the country a hasty farewell.  
So on this gray and melancholy day, I'll move to a Manhattan hotel.  
I'll dispose of my rose-colored chattels and prepare for my share of
adventures and battles,  
Here on the twenty-seventh floor looking down on the city I hate and adore!  
Autumn in New York, why does it seem so inviting?  
  
Autumn in New York, it spells the thrill of first-nighting.  
Glittering crowds and shimmering clouds in canyons of steel, they're making me
feel I'm home.  
It's autumn in New York that brings the promise of new love.  
  
Autumn in New  
York is often mingled with pain.  
Dreamers with empty hands may sigh for exotic lands,  
It's autumn in New York,  
It's good to live again.
