These lines in my face, caused from worry,  
Grow deeper as you walk out of sight.  
Mine is the face of a fighter,  
But my heart has just lost the fight.  
  
Round one: you told me you loved me,  
An' I felt my heart falling there an' then.  
The last round: you walked tall an' left me,  
An' I guess my heart's losing again.  
  
Mine is the face of a fighter:  
I fought for your love with all my might.  
Mine is the face of fighter,  
But my heart has just lost the fight.  
  
Yes, mine is the face of a fighter:  
I fought for your love with all my might.  
Mine is the face of fighter,  
But my heart has just lost the fight.
