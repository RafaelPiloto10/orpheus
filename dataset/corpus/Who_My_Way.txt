Some way, some day, I'll find a way  
To make you see my way  
Even if you don't think like I do  
You know that it's true  
It's your mind that I seek  
Tried so hard to make me think my point of view was bad  
Although at times when you kept on I thought that I was mad  
I'm glad it's goodbye  
You don't have to ask why  
Come back another day  
Come back when you see my way  
You see my way  
Tried so hard to make me think my point of view was bad  
Although at times when you kept on I thought that I was mad  
Some way, some day, I'll find a way  
To make you see my way  
I'm glad it's goodbye  
You don't have to ask why  
Come back another day  
Come back when you see my way  
You see my way  
You see my way
