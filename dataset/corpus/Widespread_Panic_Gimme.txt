Gimme a hand there, Michael.

Throw myself at the ground.  
Look away before I hit.  
  
Give me a lift here, Larry.  
I'll give you a lift here, too.  
Give me a lift here, Larry.  
I'd give you my horse if I could.  
  
Throw myself at the ground.  
Look away before I hit.  
  
Gimme a kiss there, Tuesday.  
I'll give you a kiss there, too.  
I'll give you a kiss there, Tuesday.  
I'd give you my heart,  
I'd give you my heart if I could!  
  
Throw myself at the ground.  
Look away before I hit.
