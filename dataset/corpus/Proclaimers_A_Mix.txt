A mix of pain and happiness  
Surrounds us even now.  
A mix of pain and happiness  
I don't know why or how.  
It's still here,  
It's outlasted every year.  
We're still here  
Just like you say.  
  
A mix of pain and happiness  
Between a woman and a man.  
A mix of pain and happiness  
Replaced every plan.  
Love is true,  
Or it is between me and you.  
Love is all  
I have to say.  
  
I saw your face, I heard your voice.  
I was a prisoner, I had no choice.  
  
I saw your face, I heard your voice.  
I was a prisoner, I had no choice.  
  
A mix of pain and happiness  
Tumbles us downhill.  
A mix of pain and happiness  
Takes us where it will.  
It can't last,  
It's over much too fast.  
Let it last  
Another day.
