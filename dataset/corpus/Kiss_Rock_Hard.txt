Hot lover, turn up the heat  
I want your sugar, girl your love tastes so sweet  
I feel a fire burnin' under me  
I've got a hunger that you love's gotta feed  
You make me sweat, you turn me 'round  
You get me up, you never let me down  
  
You make me rock hard, baby all night  
Love's like a glove and it fits just rights  
You make me rock hard, so baby hold tight  
Come on baby, let's rock hard, baby all night  
  
I'm under a physical spell  
I'm a prisoner and your love is my cell  
Once I get started I can't stop  
I can't cool down 'cause this love is so hot  
You make me sweat, you turn me 'round  
You get me up, you never let me down  
  
You make me rock hard, baby all night  
Love's like a glove and it fits just right  
You make me rock hard, so baby hold tight  
Come on baby, let's rock hard, baby all night  
  
You make me sweat, you turn me 'round  
You get me up, you never let me down  
  
You make me rock hard, baby all night  
Love's like a glove and it fits just right  
You make me rock hard, so baby hold tight  
Come on baby, let's rock hard, baby let's  
Rock hard, baby all night  
Love's like a glove and it fits just right  
You make me rock hard, so baby hold tight  
Come on baby, let's rock hard, baby all night  
All night, all night, yeah, all night, hey  
You make me rock hard, baby all night  
Love's like a glove and it fits just right  
You make me rock hard, so baby hold tight  
Come on baby, let's rock hard, baby let's  
Rock hard, baby all night
