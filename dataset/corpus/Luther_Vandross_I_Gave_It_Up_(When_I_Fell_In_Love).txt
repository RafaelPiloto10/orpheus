My friends told me all about it  
They said I had to see for myself  
But I never really cared  
Much about love  
I thought I could live without it  
Until I met this one girl  
And she was so fine  
I knew she was the one who could change my mind  
  
See, I used to be such a bad, bad boy  
And good times were my toy for joy  
That was all I was thinking of  
But I gave it up when I fell in love  
I used to know the party people around the world  
I gave it up when I found that girl  
And she's the one treats me good enough  
So I gave it up when I fell in love  
  
I thought I was justified  
To only see the world through my eyes  
And that it was a waste of time  
Talkin' 'bout love  
But it only took a little time  
To make me change my mind  
'Cause when she said goodbye  
See, I really thought I'd never stop crying  
  
Now, every night I dream about you and our new love  
All of my friends say oh I'm such a different guy  
And they wonder  
Oh, how they wonder  
  
I gave it up  
Sho 'nuff gave it up  
That was all I was thinking of  
But I gave it up when I fell in love
