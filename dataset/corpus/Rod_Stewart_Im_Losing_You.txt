Your love is fading, I can feel your love fading  
Woman it's fading away from me  
'Cause your personal touch has grown cold  
As if someone else controls your very soul  
I fooled myself as long as I can  
Can feel the presence of another man  
It's there when you speak my name, it's just not the same  
Oh, honey I'm losing you  
I can feel it in the air, it's there everywhere  
Oh, I'm losing you  
I can feel it in my bones, any day you'll be up and gone  
Oh, I'm losing you  
It's all over your face, someone's takin' my place  
Could it be that I'm losing you?  
When I look into your eyes a reflection of a face I see  
Oh Lord I'm losing you  
I'm hurt, downhearted and worried, girl  
'Cause that face doesn't belong to me  
Your love is fadin', can feel it fadin'  
Oh, away from me  
Can feel it in the air, it's there everywhere  
Ooo, I'm losing you  
I don't wanna lose you  
But I know I'm gonna groove you  
Oh Lord I'm losing you  
Get out, woo  
Ooo yeah, get down there  
Get down there  
I don't wanna lose you  
But I know I gotta groove you  
Oh Lord I'm losing you  
And I'm losin' you  
Oh yeah  
Oh yeah  
Oh yeah  
Your love is fadin', I can feel it fadin'  
Oh Lord I'm losing you
