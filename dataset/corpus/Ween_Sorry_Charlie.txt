Things didn't work out the way you had planned it  
Things fell apart at the seams  
What's yours is what you took with you  
And what you have has shattered their dreams  
  
And now you're cold and sleepy  
Christ, how did it come to this  
Hold on to those you thought were your loved ones  
They'll be the ones you miss  
  
And now you're standing at the station  
Tryin' to take what I ain't got to give  
Oh and I'm so sorry Charlie  
I've got my own life to live  
Just call your friends at college  
Wonder why you didn't stay  
And my boss is coming down soon Chuck  
He's drunk so you can't stay  
No, you can't stay  
  
You did nothing to deserve this  
God didn't treat you square  
Oh it all slipped through your fingers  
And it all seems so unfair  
  
And your girlfriend, she's in high school  
She says she loves you a lot  
Lord knows she can't support you  
So you better sell more pot  
  
And now you're standing at the station  
Tryin' to take what I ain't got to give  
Oh and I'm so sorry Charlie  
I've got my own life to live  
So you just call your friends at college  
Wonder why you didn't stay  
And my boss is coming down soon Chuck  
He's drunk and you can't stay  
No, you can't stay  
  
Sorry Charlie  
Sorry Charlie  
Oww!
