Hootie Hoo  
Follow the funk from the skunk  
And the dank that is crunk in the Dungeon  
It goes on and on and on, like that  
Going out to the Jeeps and hoes in the 'llac  
Ah Suki, Suki  
All day and day, any day, every damn day  
I be thinking about the good ol' days when I was a whippersnapper  
Used to try to get a kiss, but now it be them draws I'm after  
I'm just a Southernplayalistic pimp  
I used to sling a fat rock, but now I'm serving hemp  
I never even smoked a gram of crack, but yo I'm dope  
Mo' doper than a junkie or a Pooky cause it's on  
So each one, teach one, I be claiming true  
To East Point and College Park and the things I used to do  
Around ATL, home of the pimps and the money makers  
Club niggas, Magic City and them Southern players  
I never said I was a gangsta but I will do ya  
So Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
One for the players at the crib, drinking drinks  
And two is for the sound, Hootie Hoo that I make  
  
[Chorus]  
Hootie Hoo  
Tight like hallways, smoked out always(Hootie Hoo)  
Yeah, Hootie Hoo  
Big Boi on the left, Andre's on my right  
Tight like hallways, smoked out always (Hootie Hoo)  
  
Now playing these bitches is my favorite sport  
But ain't no game when they be calling your name in the court  
Oh, it's Saturday night, I guess that makes it alright  
Got an obese twenty sack, fully packed, it's so tight  
That it's busting out the seams, yes sir, I'm set  
Oh, but let me tuck the 380 before I jet  
Hops off in the Lac with Big Gipp, you got a light (Hootie Hoo)  
Communication device dun went off twice  
Should I answer the call, yes, I'm macking 'em all  
We met 'em up in the mall, recall Player's Ball  
Well, it's Player's Ball 2, so I guess I'll call you  
Later on, and then your whole crew can fall through  
Now later on done got here  
I takes a peek, now let me see, what do we got here?  
Draws, falling down like niggas in a drive-by  
I got up in them draws and I told her bye bye  
About two weeks later, she called me with some bullshit  
Talking 'bout her period late, guess what I did  
Click  
No, it couldn't be me. Not me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Uh, well you know we getting blizzard cause we got that chicken gizzard  
In the dungeon and scope but some of you niggas can't cope with it  
So, Opie, hip hop, to the front, to the back and it don't stop  
From the streets of ATL to the slums of College Park  
So god almighty no, it's Outkast for the 94 era  
You heard the player's call, we taking it to another level  
So 'lujah, Halle, let me get a swallow of that Martel  
And you may go to hell  
  
Set sail with a nigga from ATL, Southwest that is  
It's that Southern ses in your chest that is  
One mo' gen for my friend who don't take  
No bullshit from no bitch who is stank  
I ain't the sugar daddy nigga who will make you  
Silly of you to think that I would, but I will lay you  
Down like some bo-los, you can throw those  
Head, til I'm dead, yes, it's now your broke hoes  
Don't get me wrong to disrespect is not my shit  
But if you fall in this category, then you'se a bitch
