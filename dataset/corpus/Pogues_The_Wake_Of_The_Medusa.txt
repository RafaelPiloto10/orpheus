The guests are stood in silence  
They stare and drink their wine  
On the wall the canvas hangs  
Frozen there in time  
They marvel at the beauty  
The horror and despair  
At the wake of the Medusa  
No one shed a tear  
  
Sit my friends and listen  
Put your glasses down  
Sit my friends and listen  
To the voices of the drowned  
  
In the moonlight's ghostly glow  
I waken in a dream  
Once more upon that raft I stand  
Upon a raging sea  
In my ears the moans and screams  
Of the dying ring  
Somewhere in the darkness  
The siren softly sings  
  
Out there in the waves she stands  
And smiling there she calls  
As the lightning cracks the sky  
The wind begins to howl  
  
The architects of our doom  
Around their tables sit  
And in their thrones of power  
Condemn those they've cast adrift  
Echoes down the city street  
Their harpies laughter rings  
Waiting for the curtain call  
Oblivious in the wings  
  
The casket is empty  
Abandon ye all hope  
They ran off with the money  
And left us with the rope
