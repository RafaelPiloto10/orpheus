Give me a ticket on a jet airplane  
I'm a-gonna take it  
I live my life in the fast lane, the only way to make it  
And I keep on going all night long  
Cause that's the way I like it  
And with what you got in the heat of the night  
I know we got to try it  
  
Until the flame burns out  
Until the flame burns out  
  
So turn it up, your radio,  
Everybody shake it  
I'm a hundred degrees, with wild fantasies  
And I need someone to make it  
Show me a place where love is sweet  
I ain't gonna fake it  
And hey little girl if you want my love  
Then now's the time to take it  
  
Before the flame burns out [Repeat: x4]  
  
Turn up the flame your hips are fire  
You're so hot I got to try ya  
Show me the spot and I'll hit the mark  
Baby I got the gasoline and you got the sparks  
  
Before the flame burns out  
Before the flame burns out  
Until the flame burns out  
Until the flame burns out
