Girl, the only thing that matters in my life  
Is that I'm there for you and treat you right  
You got no right to treat me cold as ice  
  
[Bridge]  
Oh, Oh, Oh, girl  
As long as I been givin' my love to you  
You should be givin' me your love too, Oh  
But you just keep on acting just like a fool  
You know it ain't cool  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't be cruel  
'Cause I would never be that cruel to you.  
Ah no, oh, oh-oh  
Ah don't be cruel  
'Cause girl you need to change your attitude  
Ah, no, oh, oh-oh  
Don't be cruel.  
  
Man we used to hang out tough  
Just hanging around  
Just a true love affair that could never be found  
I gave you my heart and I gave you my mind  
  
But a true love affair we could never find  
I tell all the time that I want you Jackie  
I want you more than human eyes could see  
Now you know my name  
Now you know the game  
  
You want to be with me you gotta be the same  
Way that another girl would be  
And if you want to be with me.  
Girl I work so hard for you from nine to five  
  
So that can buy you all the finer things in life  
You got no right to treat me cold as ice.
