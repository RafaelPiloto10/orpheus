Maybe it's been so long  
Our house looks kind of different  
But the empty rooms still mean the same to me  
And as I wander through the darkness  
I'll keep crying one last tear  
Now your lips are gone  
I'll kiss your memory  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll kiss your memory  
As though you were here  
I'll hold your memories till you reappear  
And as I wander through the darkness  
I'll keep crying one last tear  
Now your lips are gone  
I'll kiss your memory  
  
I'll kiss the thoughts of leaves that fell when summer was over  
And I'll cherish all the thoughts you gave to me  
And I will wander through the darkness  
I'll keep crying one last tear  
Now your lips are gone  
I'll kiss your memory  
  
[Chorus]
