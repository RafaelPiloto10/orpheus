Though the night be dark as dungeon, not a star to be seen above  
I will be guided without a stumble, into the arms of me only love.  
I went up to her bedroom window, kneeling gently upon a stone  
I rapped on her bedroom window "My darling dear, do you lie alone"?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm a rover , seldom sober  
I'm a rover of high degree  
Ans when I'm drinking, I'm always thinking  
How to gain my love's company.  
  
She raised her head up from her feather pillow, raised her arms up around her
breast,  
Saying "Who's at me bedroom window, disturbing me at me long night's rest?  
"It's only me, your own true lover, open the door and please let me in.  
For I have come on a long night's journey. I am near drenched to the skin".  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She opened the door with the greatest pleasure, opened the door and she let me
in  
We both shook hands and embraced each other. 'Til the morning we lay as one.  
"Well now me love, I must go and leave you, though the mountains be high above  
Well, I will climb them with greater pleasure that I have been with me only
love".
