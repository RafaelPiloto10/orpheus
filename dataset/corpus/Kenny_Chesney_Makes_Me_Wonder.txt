Stepped off the airplane, I saw your face  
It's been forever, but it don't feel that way  
Your hand took my hand like it knew what to do  
Girl it's so easy to be with you  
  
[Chorus]  
Makes me wonder  
Makes me wonder  
Makes me wonder  
Why we're not in love  
  
Caught up over coffee, then walked around town  
Some sidewalk singer was laying it down  
You started dancin' right there on the curb,  
Thought to myself man there's somethin' 'bout her  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I been thinkin' 'bout her  
Still can't tell ya why  
All I know is that it's hard to say goodbye  
  
I got on that airplane, you got in your car  
Looked out on that city wondering where you are  
And if you're feeling like me just a little bit sad  
I already miss you, now what's up with that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Makes me wonder  
Makes me wonder  
Makes me wonder  
Makes me wonder  
Makes me wonder  
Why we're not in love
