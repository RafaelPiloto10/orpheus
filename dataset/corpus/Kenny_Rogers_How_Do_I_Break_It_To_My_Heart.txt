There's your picture by the bed  
I'm gonna leave it where it is  
'cause if I tear it out tonight  
My heart would know  
But something ain't right  
Between me and you.  
I'm gonna lie here in the dark  
And pretend you're in my arms  
And if I can't keep on crying out your name  
My heart would think you're here beside me  
And things are still the same.  
My mind knows it's over  
But how do I break it to my heart  
If I let it down easy  
It'd still be torn apart  
And if I tell it the truth  
Then the pain is gonna start  
My mind knows it's over  
But how do I break it to my heart.  
When I saw him by your side  
I guess it opened up my eyes  
And my ears can finally hear your soft goodbye  
But my heart still says I'm loving you tonight  
And for the rest of its life.
