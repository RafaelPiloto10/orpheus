I hate to see that evening sun go down  
I hate to see that evening sun go down  
'Cause the woman I'm loving, she has left this town  
  
If I'm feeling tomorrow just like I feel today  
If I'm feeling tomorrow just like I feel today  
I'm gonna pack my bags and make a getaway  
  
St. Louis woman without your diamond ring  
If you didn't have good looks, you wouldn't mean a thing  
If it was not for powder and your super hair  
Without the man who loves you, you wouldn't get nowhere nowhere  
  
I got the St. Louis blues, blue as I can be  
I got the St. Louis blues, blue as I can be  
You know I love you, but you don't care for me  
  
I got the St. Louis blues, blue as I can be  
I got the St. Louis blues, blue as I can be  
You know I love you, but you don't care for me  
I got the St. Louis blues, blue as I can be
