From where I stand I see  
Pain suffering and misery  
The more I see the more I see  
The less the less I believe  
  
From where I stand I see  
Hate violence and war  
  
The more I see the more I see  
The less the less I believe  
  
The more I see the more I see  
The less the less I believe  
(I believe)  
  
(From where I stand I see  
Pain, suffer, and misery)  
  
The more I see (the more I see)  
The less the less I believe  
The more I see  
The more I see  
The more I see, yeah  
The more I see, yeah  
The more I see, yeah  
The less, the less I believe  
  
Thank You
