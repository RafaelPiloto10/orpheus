From Coney Island to The Sunset Strip  
Somebody's gonna make a happy trip  
Tonight, while the moon is bright  
He's gonna have a bag of crazy toys  
To give the gonest of the boys and girls  
So dig, Santa comes on big  
  
He'll come a callin' when the snow's the most  
When all you cats are sleepin' warm as toast  
And you gonna flip when Old Saint Nick  
Takes a lick on the peppernint stick  
  
He'll come a flyin' from a higher place  
And fill the stocking by the fire place  
So you'll, have a yule that's cool  
  
Yeah, from Coney Island to The Sunset Strip  
Somebody's gonna make a happy trip  
Tonight, while the moon is bright  
  
Behind a reindeer with a blinkin' nose  
he's lookin' groovy in his same ol' clothes  
He's red...in his suped-up sled!  
  
He's on a mission and he will not shirk  
Down the chimney, yeah, he gets to work.  
That "Mr. C" is H-O-T  
Santa won't ya light my Christmas tree!  
  
He'll come a flyin' from a higher place  
And fill the stocking by the fire place  
So you'll, have a yule that's cool  
  
Have a yule that's cool  
Yeah, cool yule
