One shot  
Oh lord  
You know, it's gonna be a lot of negative things surrounding you  
Trying to pull you down  
But what you have to remember is  
It's up to you, it's your choice  
You only get one shot in life  
And you only get one shot at love  
  
Did you ever notice, every time you fall in love  
And it seems like you finally met the perfect match  
Everything is perfect, it seems divine  
But for some strange reason, there's always a catch  
It's a one-way relationship, it hurts inside  
One person smirks while the other one cries  
Butterflies in the stomach of the one whose in love  
It cuts like a knife, the truth mixed with lies  
  
One shot (one shot at love)  
One shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)  
One shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)  
One shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)  
That's all you get  
  
Physical and mental, those are two different loves  
Physical's a moment, mental is forever  
If the physical fades and gets weak, all of a sudden  
Remember, it's the mental love that keeps you together  
You gotta be strong and endure the hard times  
Cause af-ter hard times, good times, always follow  
And when you're kissin' and huggin' and makin' love  
Treat that person like there's no tomorrow  
  
One shot (one shot at love)  
One shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)  
That's all you get baby, one shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)  
One shot at love, one, shot (one shot at love)  
That's all you get  
  
Jealousy, don't let it interfere  
Don't let it come in between  
The love you two share, cause jealousy's a hateful God  
So merciless and mean  
And it's only job in life, is to ruin relationships  
And pit two people against, one another  
And because of this God, the one you love so much  
Will no longer be your lover  
  
One shot (one shot at love)  
Aw baby, one shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)  
That's all we get, one shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)  
I mean this baby, one shot at love, one shot (one shot at love)  
That's all  
  
I hope you understand what I just said  
All I'm saying is that you only get one shot at love in life  
And you have to hold on to that shot, take advantage of it  
Cause when you lose it, it's gonna hurt real bad  
Take it from me  
You only get one shot, and I mean that  
One shot  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
You only get you only get you only get one  
You only get you only get you only get one  
One shot at love
