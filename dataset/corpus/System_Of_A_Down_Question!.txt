Sweet berries ready for two,  
Ghosts are no different than you,  
Ghosts are now waiting for you,  
Are you,  
Sweet berries ready for two,  
Ghosts are no different than you,  
Ghosts are now waiting for you,  
Are you, dreaming,  
Dreaming tonight,  
Dreaming alright  
  
Do we, do we know,  
When we fly?  
When we, when we go,  
Do we die?
