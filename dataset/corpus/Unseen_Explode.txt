Theirs something I should get off my chest  
I'm losing my mind and my life's a mess.  
Well everyone says do this and do that  
Maybe they're right  
I feel like I'm gonna  
Explode I'm gonna explode  
It is so big yet I feel so small  
It's even in your shopping mall  
Is my life wasting away  
Don't throw it away that's what they say  
I don't want to go out and fail  
Yet I fail at home every day  
I wonder someday if I'll look back  
With regrets on how I lived  
Each way I turn I turn my back  
Each time I turn I always look back  
I'm trying to please everyone I don't know how  
I feel like I'm gonna  
Explode I'm gonna explode  
What should I do I really don't know  
Should I stay home or should I go  
Well I'm struggling with my sanity  
Is my life crumbling in front of me.  
Oh.  
Do you know how it feels?  
To feel like your gonna explode  
Do you ever feel  
Like your gonna explode.  
Explode.
