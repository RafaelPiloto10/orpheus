Well I'm sittin at the crowded bar  
To get a little glimpse of your face  
Your profile and your hip style  
Your definition  
Somethin I don't know all about  
So confident in your own space  
  
As you move to look at me  
I lose, cause I look away  
Cause you could never, ever  
Be just plain old lookin at me  
So I turn to confirm  
That your smile is the same  
  
I can't believe you're lookin at me  
I don't dare  
To turn around to see  
I just have to imagine the you're  
Only lookin through me  
And suddenly you're  
Right here with me  
  
Cause you are this moment yeah  
One minute of one hour of one night  
You might be the center  
Fresh face for my fantasy  
  
You play the perfect part of  
Someone who's a part of me  
You'd help repeating  
The haunting of heart  
So perfectly  
  
I can't believe  
You're lookin at me, lookin at me  
I don't dare to turn around to see  
I have to imagine that you're  
Only lookin through me  
Then suddenly  
You're right here with me  
  
Said you're right on  
Said you're right on  
Said you're right on  
Oh i'll go home and cry  
Oh I saw heaven  
Oh I've seen so many tragedies  
Oh lord I'm feeling  
Oh lord I said it's real and  
Oh I say I'm feelin alright  
  
(scatting)
