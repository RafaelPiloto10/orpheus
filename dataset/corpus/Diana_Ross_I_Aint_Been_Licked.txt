Roll down the gangway  
So they'll see that it's me  
I know they'll wonder about my recovery  
Yes, I lost a love that promised happiness  
What my heart wouldn't accept  
Put me to the test  
They keep a holding me down  
But I rise, yes, it can be done  
They keep a holding me down  
But I rise, they can't make me run  
Keep a holding me down  
But I rise, got my second wind  
Keep a holding me down  
But I rise, tell 'em I'm back again  
Just say, I ain't been licked  
I ain't been licked  
I ain't been licked  
Tell 'em for me, I ain't been licked  
Like outta nowhere  
My whole world fell apart  
Till this day no one knows  
What I felt in my heart  
All those precious things  
Inside me tried to still  
Hands I thought would help  
Pushed me over the hill  
Keep a holding me down  
But I rise, yes, it can be done  
Keep a holding me down  
But I rise, they can't make me run  
Keep a holding me down  
But I rise, got my second wind  
Keep a holding me down  
But I rise, tell 'em I'm back again  
Just say, I ain't been licked  
I ain't been licked  
I ain't been licked  
Tell 'em for me, I ain't been licked  
Keep a holding me down  
But I rise just to start again  
Rise, show 'em that I can  
Rise, found a brand new dream  
Rise just to prove one thing  
Just say, I ain't been licked  
I ain't been licked  
I ain't been licked  
Tell 'em for me, I ain't been licked  
I want the world to see  
I ain't been licked  
Although my love is gone  
I ain't been licked  
Somehow I carry one  
I ain't been licked  
I'll find the strength somehow  
I ain't been licked  
I think I'm ready now  
I ain't been licked  
I ain't been licked  
I ain't been licked  
I ain't been licked
