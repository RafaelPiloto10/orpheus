I think, I understand  
The reason you won't stay with me  
You think a ring upon your hand  
Will solve your insecurity  
  
So go ahead and play your games  
If that's what you must do  
Nothing here remains the same  
But the way I feel for you  
  
I can watch you walk away  
And I know that I'll get by  
And I know just what to say  
But honey, I can't tell a lie  
  
Figure out what you must do  
Because you think you're so damn clever  
You can marry anytime you want  
But a lover is forever  
  
I can watch you walk away  
And I know that I'll get by  
And I know just what to say  
But honey, I can't tell a lie  
  
Figure out what you must do  
Because you think you're so damn clever  
You can marry anytime you want  
But a lover is forever  
You can marry anytime you want  
But a lover is forever
