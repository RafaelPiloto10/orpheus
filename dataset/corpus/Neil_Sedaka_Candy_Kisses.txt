My old lady she's so sweet and fine  
I can't help it wanting her kisses all the time  
I run to meet her like kid with a dollar to the corner candy store  
It's what I'm living for, but I want more than your candy kisses  
  
She starts moving I say honey please  
I ain't foolin' you know it isn't right to tease  
I tell her sugar you're a true fine lover, you're sweet as cherry pie  
But no matter how I try, I can't get by, on your candy kisses  
  
I don't want our love to stop  
If it should stop my heart would break  
If the sun should get too hot  
It's gonna melt the icing on our cake  
  
Candy kisses knock me off my feet  
Fill me up but leave me feeling incomplete  
Fancy wrappin' and well made trappins will lead me to your door  
But what I'm hungry for, is so much more  
Than your candy kisses
