At Last......  
  
My love has come along  
My lonely days are over  
And life is like a song  
  
Oh ya ya  
  
At Last......  
  
The sky's above are blue  
My heart was wrapped up in clovers  
The night I I looked at you  
I found a dream  
That I could speak to  
A dream that I I I I could call my own  
I found a thrill  
To press my cheek to  
A thrill that I've never known  
  
Oh ya ya  
  
And you smiled  
And you smiled  
  
Oh and then the spell was cast  
And here we are in heaven  
For you are mine......  
  
At last
