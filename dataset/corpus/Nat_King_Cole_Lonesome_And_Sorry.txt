Dear Lonely Hearts  
I'm a writing to you  
You said you could help  
People looking for love  
  
I've been so lonely  
I don't know what to do  
And that is why  
I'm writing this letter to you  
  
(It's no use livin')  
When you're alone  
Please help me find  
A love of my own  
  
If you know someone  
Please tell me who  
Dear Lonely Hearts  
I'd be so grateful to you  
  
(So grateful to you)  
(She don't have to have money)  
She don't have to have money  
(She don't have to be a queen)  
  
She don't have to be a queen  
(As long as she loves me)  
As long as she loves me  
(That's the important thing)  
That's the important thing  
  
'Cause I'm gonna love her  
(I'm gonna love her)  
I'll always be true  
(I'll always be true)  
  
Dear Lonely Hearts  
Oh, please  
See what you can do  
(See what you can do)  
  
I guess that's all  
(I guess that's all)  
I'm gonna close for now  
(I'm gonna close for now)  
  
But try to find  
(Please try to find)  
Somebody, somehow  
(Somebody, somehow)  
  
If you know someone  
Please tell me who  
Dear Lonely Hearts  
I'd be so grateful to you  
(Grateful to you)
