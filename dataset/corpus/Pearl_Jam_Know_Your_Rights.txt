This is a public service announcement  
With guitar  
Know your rights  
Number one  
You got a right not to kill  
Murder is a crime  
Unless it is done  
Unless it is done by a policeman  
Or an aristocrat  
Oh, know your rights  
Number two  
You have the right to food money  
Provided at cost,  
You don't mind a little investigation, humiliation  
And if you cross your fingers  
Perhaps retaliation  
Know you rights  
These are your rights  
Know your  
Know these rights  
Number three  
You have the right to free speech  
As long as you're not dumb enough to actually try it  
Know your rights  
These are your rights  
Know your rights  
These are your rights  
For freedom  
Ha!  
Maybe it's been suggested in some quarters,  
That this is not enough  
So get up, get up and scream, oh!  
Get up and scream, ah oh!
