Covered in sinners and dripping  
With gilt  
Making you money from slime  
And from filth  
Parading your bellies in ivory towers  
Investing our lives in your schemes  
And your powers  
  
You got to watch them  
Be quick  
Or be dead  
Snake eyes in heaven  
The thief  
In your head  
You've got to watch them  
Be quick  
Or be dead  
Snake eyes in heaven  
The thief  
In your head  
Be quick!  
Or be dead!  
Be quick!  
Or be dead  
  
See, what's ruling all our lives  
See, who's pulling the strings,  
I bet you won't fall on your face,  
Your belly will hold you in place  
  
The serpent is crawling inside of  
Your ear  
He says you must vote for what you  
Want to hear  
Don't matter what's wrong as long as you're  
Alright  
So pull yourself stupid and rob  
Yourself blind
