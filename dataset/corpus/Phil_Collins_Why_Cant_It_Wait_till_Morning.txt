Why can't it wait 'til morning?  
We can talk about it then  
'Cause I've had a drink too many  
And my troubles, well I ain't got any  
  
Why can't it wait 'til daylight?  
Things will seem much clearer then  
I'm tired and my eyes are weary  
And I just want you lying here with me  
  
So close your eyes  
I'll make it oh, so nice  
  
Well I don't wanna think about what we've said  
And I don't wanna know why we hurt ourselves  
'Cause I just wanna hold you so close to me  
It'll take care of itself and I wanna sleep  
  
So why can't it wait 'til next time?  
'Cause that time may never come  
Stay here with your arms around me  
You're going nowhere without me  
  
So close your eyes  
I'll make it oh, so nice for you
