It's night time, we're driving  
Lights go by makes stars in my eyes  
It's cold out, and its warm in  
When I had you by my side  
  
And I love this its special  
When the breeze is on my face  
For now and for always I'll dream about this time and place  
  
This is the feeling I want for always  
This is the feeling I want for always  
  
Free  
So Free  
  
It's special, the feeling  
It's really nice, nice and new  
Something to believe in  
We'll do whatever we choose  
  
And I love this, it's magic  
On the road to God know's where  
For now and forever  
I'll dream about this time we share  
  
This is the feeling I want for always  
This is the feeling I want for always  
  
Free  
So free  
Free  
So Free  
  
Ah-ah-ah  
  
This is the feeling I want for always  
This is the feeling I want for always  
  
This is the feeling I want for always  
This is the feeling I want for always  
  
Free  
So free  
Free (this is the feeling)  
So free (this is the feeling)  
Free (this is the feeling)  
So free (this is the feeling)  
  
Ah-ah-ah
