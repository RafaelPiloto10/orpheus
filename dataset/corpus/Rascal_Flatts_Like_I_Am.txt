Lying here with you  
I watch you while you sleep  
The dawn is closing in  
With every breath you breathe  
  
I can feel the change  
The change you've made in me  
But will I ever see  
All the things you see in me  
  
When you say that I'm one of a kind  
Baby, I don't see it but you believe  
That I'm so strong and true, I promise you  
I'll try to be that kind of man  
Because you love me like I am  
  
When it comes to love  
I may not know the rules  
But there's one thing I know  
My heart belongs to you, just you  
  
When you say that I'm one of a kind  
Baby, I don't see it but you believe  
That I'm so strong and true, I promise you  
I'll try to be that kind of man  
Because you love me like I am  
  
You show me you love me  
With a fire that burns deep inside  
  
When you say that I'm one of a kind  
Baby, I don't see it but you believe  
That I'm so strong and true, I promise you  
I'll try to be that kind of man  
Because you love me like I am  
  
When you say that I'm one of a kind  
Baby, I don't see it but you believe  
That I'm so strong and true, I promise you  
I'll try to be that kind of man  
Because you love me like I am  
  
I am  
I'll never understand  
I don't think I'll ever understand  
Why you love me  
Why you love me just like I am
