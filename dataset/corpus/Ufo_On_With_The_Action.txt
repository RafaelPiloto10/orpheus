Something going on at the corner of the block  
Its the kids down there  
They were starting to rock  
High black fever running everyplace  
When the Greek kid pulled a knife  
And pushed it in his face  
Some girl makes it with a lover in the door,  
As the ambulance pulls away,  
She cries out more  
  
[Chorus]  
And it's all night long, all night long  
On with the action  
You need the fastest legs alive  
On with the action  
If you can't run you ain't survive  
On with the action  
Mamas boy and teachers pet,  
On with the action  
Its down our street, is it in yours yet  
  
All the kids stand laughing  
They never had such fun  
Then someone cuts a blind man who just can't make a run  
And the queen who's been standing behind the toilet door  
His parents don't like boyfriends, call him a whore  
But the ministers staring  
With his Bible in his hand  
Was this gods children, he didn't understand  
  
[Chorus: x2]
