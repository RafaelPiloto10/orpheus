From a jack to a king  
From loneliness to a wedding ring  
I played an Ace  
And I won a Queen  
And walked away with your heart  
  
From a jack to a king  
With no regrets  
I stacked the cards last night  
And Lady Luck  
Played her hand just right  
To make me king of your heart  
  
For just a little while I thought  
That I might lose the game  
Then just in time I saw  
The twinkle in your eye  
  
From a jack to a king  
From loneliness to a wedding ring  
I played an Ace  
And I won a Queen  
You made me king of your heart  
For just a little while
