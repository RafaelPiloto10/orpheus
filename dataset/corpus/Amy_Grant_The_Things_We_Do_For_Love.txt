Too many broken hearts have fallen in the river  
Too many lonely souls have drifted out to sea  
You lay your bets and then you pay the price  
The things we do for love, the things we do for love.  
  
Communication is the problem to the answer  
You've got her number and your hand is on the phone  
The weather's turned and all the lines are down  
The things we do for love, the things we do for love.  
  
Like walking in the rain and the snow  
When there's nowhere to go  
And you're feelin' like a part of you is dying  
And you're looking for the answer in his eyes.  
You think you're gonna break up  
Then he says he wants to make up.  
  
Ooh you made me love you  
Ooh you've got a way  
Ooh you had me crawling on the floor.  
  
Like walking in the rain and the snow  
When there's nowhere to go  
And you're feelin' like a part of you is dying  
And you're looking for the answer in his eyes.  
You think you're gonna break up  
Then he says he wants to make up.  
  
Ooh you made me love you  
Ooh you've got a way  
Ooh you had me crawling on the floor.  
  
A compromise would surely help the situation  
Agree to disagree but disagree the part  
When after all it's just a compromise of  
The things we do for love, the things we do for love
