Clouds above you start to pour  
And all of your doubts  
Rain like a storm  
And you don't know who you are anymore  
Let me help you find what you've been searching for  
  
Somewhere  
Somewhere there's a field and a river  
Somewhere  
You can let your soul run free  
Someday  
Someday let me be the giver  
Let me bring you peace  
  
Somewhere  
Somewhere there's a break in the weather  
Somewhere  
Where your heart and spirit go free  
Someday  
Someday it'll be for the better  
Let this bring you peace  
  
Girl, I know you, think no one sees  
The weight on your shoulders  
But you can't fool me  
And aren't you tired of standing so tall  
Let me be the one to catch you when you fall  
  
Let me bring you joy (bring you joy)  
Let me bring you peace (bring you peace)  
Take these tears that you cry and trust them to me  
Let me give you heart (give you heart)  
And let me give you hope (give you hope)  
Be the one constant love that you've never known  
  
Somewhere,  
Someday  
Let me be the one  
Let me be the one to catch you when you fall  
Somewhere (repeat)  
Let me bring you peace  
Somewhere
