A nocturnal concerto  
Candlelight whispers me where to go  
Hymn of gathering stars as my guide  
Whilst I wander on this path of the night  
  
Embroidery of the stars  
Undress my feelings for this earth  
Send me your saliva to heal my scars  
And let this nakedness be my birth  
  
Macrocosm poured its powers on me  
And the hopes of this world I now must leave  
The night wish I sent you centuries ago  
Has been heard by those who dwelled in a woe  
  
The distance of our bridal bed  
Await for me to be dead  
Dust of the galaxies take my hand  
Lead me to my beloved's land  
  
Departed by the guillotine of death  
I received a letter from the depth  
The dream of my lover it carried inside  
  
Caressed by the sharpest knife  
I asked you to be my wife  
Rays of the setting sun  
Were my tears wept upon promises undone  
  
Come to me  
Make me believe  
To you and your love again  
  
Above the universe  
Beneath the great eye  
I shall desire you forevermore
