She walked out with empty arms  
Machine gun in her hand  
She is good and she is bad  
No one understands  
  
She walked in in silence  
Never spoke a word  
She's got a rich daddy  
She's her daddy's girl  
  
She loves naked sin  
He loves evil sex  
She has lost control  
They are growing old  
  
She will hide in silence  
Then her day will come  
She was virgin vixen  
She is on the run  
She is on the run  
She is on the run
