There's an empty street in an empty town  
There's an old boutique selling ageing gowns  
Some words on the walls that were written  
By the light of the moon so bright  
  
Can you hear me, can you her me tonight  
Take me out of this darkness and in to the morning light  
  
The rain that falls doesn't make me cry  
And the wind that blows cannot hurt my eyes  
But the things that I see when I turn on TV  
Make me want to lie down and die  
  
Can you hear me, can you her me tonight  
Take me out of this darkness and in to the morning light  
Can you hear me  
Take me out of this darkness and in to the morning light
