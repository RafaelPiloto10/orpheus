I think I'm the only one who really knows  
But the emptiness inside of you will show us  
We are only tiny babies living right here  
Go the way of someone else by gone  
Cave, can you feel me cry?  
And now to end  
I saw what can  
I see you  
And the lights still go where we are going  
When the fallout comes we knew we shall must go  
Please just give to me your handsome hands  
And I really won't care where my daddy lives  
  
Cave, can you feel me cry?  
And now to end  
I saw what can  
I see you  
  
Can you, can you feel me cry?  
And now to end  
I saw what I can  
I see you
