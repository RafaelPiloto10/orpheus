I'm your suicidal doomsday machine  
Bestowing my grace on everything  
My ill will shall never leave  
Embracing until you cannot breathe  
Superterrorizer  
Superterrorizer  
Crashing, burning, in you I confide  
I'll drink and spew all your bloodstained pride  
You're just a pinball inside my machine  
Until you reach the falls, my closing stream  
Superterrorizer  
Superterrorizer  
Superterrorizer  
Superterrorizer
