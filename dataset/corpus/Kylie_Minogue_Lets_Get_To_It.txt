Let's get to it  
Make it happen  
Need your touch oh so much  
Don't you see  
Let's get to it right away  
  
Let's get the sun in our day  
Let's turn a spark to a flame  
Let's get this thing on the move  
My heart is longing to prove  
  
That maybe without you  
The world will grow colder  
Come on let's do it  
Before we're much older  
  
[Chorus]  
Let's get to it right now  
Make it happen somehow  
Need your touch oh so much  
Don't you see what I'm trying to say  
Let's get to it right away  
  
Let's get the show on the road  
Our love would be solid gold  
Let's put the key to the door  
Don't put it off anymore  
  
'Til now it's only been dreams  
I have lived for  
Come one, let's do it  
'cause I want to give more  
  
[Chorus]  
  
'Til now it's only been dreams  
I have lived for  
Come one, let's do it  
'cause I want to give more  
  
[Chorus: x2]
