live in fear  
live in fear  
live in fear  
  
dead end generation you should live in fear  
mass destruction, corruption and no one cares  
white is the color of thos ein power  
red is the color of the millions slaughtered  
blue is the color of the flesh that rots  
,urderers go free while some are never caught  
it's been said before it's time to listen  
tune into the news you don't know what you're missing  
  
lies! decite, injustice!  
this is how our culture lives!  
  
six year olds with fucking guns  
run away youth on the fucking run  
parents who abuse their kids  
yet we're told be proud where we fucking live  
proud for crime, proud for death  
proud for the fucking poor who tried their best  
told to vote, cast your ballot  
but the vote only counts if you're the few in power.  
  
lies! decite, injustice!  
this is how our culture lives!  
  
this is how our culture lives!
