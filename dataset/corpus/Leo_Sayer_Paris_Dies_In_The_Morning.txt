I feel so lost and lonely  
Standing by the river Seine  
I don't know how I got here or why I came  
But everywhere I see her smiling face  
I remember  
We met somewhere in the back streets  
In this city of another age  
And talking broken English 'til the darkness came  
And in my room she called me by my name  
And she whispered  
Paris dies in the morning  
That's something that they never say  
They never tell you  
Paris dies in the morning light  
You'd never think it late at night, no, no  
It disappears in the sunshine  
It's something that they never say  
They never tell you  
Paris dies in the morning light  
It's always gonna be that way  
When we made love in that hotel  
Like I never made before  
Thought I could die  
When she whispered slow  
Marai toujours  
She was wild and enchanting  
The night was like a dream  
We danced and sang the  
Sweetest harmony  
The words come back so clear  
I remember when we sang  
Paris dies in the morning  
That's something that they never say  
They never tell you  
Paris dies in the morning light  
You'd never think it late at night, no, no  
[Solo]  
When I awoke in the morning  
She was nowhere to be found  
That's why I'm standing  
Waiting a t this river's edge  
I know we'll never meet again  
It was true when she said  
Paris dies in the morning  
(It ends this way)  
The moment when it steals your heart  
And then it loves you  
Paris dies I the morning light  
You'd never think it late at night, no no  
She disappeared in the morning light  
She said that it would end this way  
Did not believe her  
Paris dies in the morning light  
I know we'll never meet again  
[Solo]  
I know we'll never meet again  
She's gone  
Paris dies in the morning
