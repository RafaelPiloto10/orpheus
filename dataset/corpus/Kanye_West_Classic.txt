Is y?all ready for Twenty-0-7, it?s now another drought  
Everyone?s a killer, wow we buggin out  
Since 86 showin the crowd what I?m about  
And they still want to know when the album comin? out  
Ask the teenagers, O?Gs and Ask the kids  
What they definition of Classic is  
Timeless, cause age don?t count in the booth  
And your flow stays submerged in the fountain of youth  
And no doubt the truth I?m off the meters  
Everybody co-signing even non-believers  
I came in the door, became one of y?alls leaders  
In the fresh pair of Air Force One sneakers  
Uptown we call ?em uppies when they on divas  
Prolly worn when KRS One teaches  
Nas, made you look, before the haters  
I bet you Kan had ?em on when he walked with Jesus  
This is classic  
classic, better than I'v ever been  
Talent,  
If it?s classic it?s gonna last forever than I?m everywhere you never been and
better than I ever been  
Classic  
Better than I'v ever been  
[Kanye West:]  
Can?t buy this, superflyness, like a shyness, your highness  
It?s performin?, look how long the line is  
That?s what happens when you make shit that?s timeless  
That?s what happens these rappers is the pioneers  
What do it take to be a legend like Nas is?  
That?s so novice, I?m so polished, I got a right to be a little bit snobbish  
I did a little bit of college, semesters it took 2 like Rob Base  
To let me figure out this wasn?t my place, the beat slowed til? you listened
to my pace  
'cause I be killin? shit, but that?s evident, and y?all feelin? it, but I
expected it  
If it?s classic it?s gonna last forever than I?m everywhere you never been and
better than I ever been  
classic, better than I'v ever been  
Talent,  
If it?s classic it?s gonna last forever than I?m everywhere you never been and
better than I ever been  
Classic  
Better than I'v ever been  
[Nas:]  
Perseverance, see the fake hustler rapper to them it hurts to hear this  
O you went platinum ? yeah that?s nice, now let me see you do the same thing
twice  
New times, 4 times, then been a couple of more times, please your amateur
night is show time  
It?s one life to live so live it the best you can, the world could use one
less man  
Not enough air, not enough car factories to manufacture new vehicles sedans
and vans  
When they do make the whip you like ya chips ain?t right, by the time you
could afford it the car ain?t important  
In the streets silent, it?s just I and - cops keep firin? in my environment  
Leavin? your slum when they drive home far from the hood brothers they eager
to jump on  
I like to be the wall that they post up on, I like to see them fall, guilty
for doing wrong  
I?m classic like the Air Ones, the Hustler shoe, that?s what I?m accustomed to  
classic, better than I'v ever been  
Talent,  
If it?s classic it?s gonna last forever than I?m everywhere you never been and
better than I ever been  
Classic  
Better than I'v ever been  
[KRS One:]  
How many y?all got criminal minded you you you y?all don?t be blinded  
Me I got no jewels on my neck, why ? I don?t need ?em I got your respect  
KRS 1 20 years I rock I do it for JMJ and Scott LaRock ? this hip hop  
And we?s a nation, don?t you want to hear more KRS on your radio station?  
Instead of broadcasting how we smokin? trees, on the radio we need to hear
more local MC?s  
Where you at? Come on where you at? This is the difference between MC?ing and
rap  
Rappers spit rhymes that are mostly illegal, MC?s spit rhymes to uplift they
people  
Peace, love, unity, and Havin? fun, these are the lyrics of KRS One
