I tell you every street's a boulevard in old New York  
Every street's a highway of your dreams  
It's a thrill to shop on 34th street  
Or down in Union Square  
We like the people you meet  
On Mulberry street, have you ever been there  
  
Every street's a boulevard in old New York  
So keep smiling and you'll never wear a frown  
Just remember there's an East Side and the West Side  
And Uptown and Down  
That's why we're proud to be a part of New York town  
  
34th street, Union Square, Mulberry Street  
Have you ever been there  
  
Every street's a boulevard in old New York  
Streets are paved with happiness in old New York  
We're proud you're a part of it  
We're happy that you came  
Each sidewalk is a concrete path to fame  
Just remember there's an East Side and the West Side  
And Uptown and Down  
In this great big metropolis known as New York town
