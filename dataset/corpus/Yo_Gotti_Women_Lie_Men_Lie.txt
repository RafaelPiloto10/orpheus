[Chorus: x6]  
Women lie, men lie  
Women lie, men lie  
Women lie, men lie  
Numbers don't lie!  
  
Ay, step up in the party and them bad bitches be on me  
I be sippin' on Patron when I'm jumpin' out Ferrari's  
I be rockin' Gucci sometime Louie, I'm retarded  
And dem rims by Asanti But the shades by Bulgari  
Hand on my scrap I got my mind on my money  
I got my mind on dine and he ain't takin' nothing from me  
Hand is on this choppa tek  
Hand is on this choppa tek  
Hand is on a hundred round cause thats how much the choppa shoot  
Ballin' is my hobby got a hundred goons shoppin'  
Gotta 5 star with me and i met her in the lobby  
Took her to the room, she hit me wit' that line  
Said she ain't that type of girl so I told her stop lyin'  
  
[Chorus: x6]  
  
Young money!  
yeah!  
OK, I ain't gotta lie, cross my heart hope to die,  
If numbers don't lie, G-5 over sky,  
I fucked her pussy good, make her cry if I tried,  
I'm tired of being sick and I'm sick of being tired,  
Tired of these niggas and tired of these bitches,  
Shit let 'em lie as long as they ain't snitching,  
And men lie about women,  
And shit women lie about plenty, huh  
They ain't lying on me I'm in the bed with 2 fine bitches lying on me,  
So that would make 3 and numbers don't lie,  
And money don't lie,  
And neither do I,  
Bitch!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(the numbers don't lie, the the numbers don't lie)  
  
I'm tryin' to count to a billion, my bitch Brazilian  
Hop in that Lamb, push the button, lose the ceiling  
Sun out no rain drops, postin' the same spot  
Right here in North, North Memphis  
Where I came from  
Hundred on the neck, I ain't never had shit  
The streets gave me family, Barry White cut the check  
Ain't no secret in the streets, niggas know I got next  
Got the swagger through the roof, I was born just to flex  
Zip code on my wrist, phone number in the bank  
In my ten til six with my 3-0-5 paint  
I got my 3-5-7 and my 5-0-1's  
In a Lear 55 wit' my Air Force One's (no lie)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ay it's yo boy yo gotti  
(Say what you want but the numbers don't lie)
