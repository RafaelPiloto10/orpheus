Words and music by bob seger  
  
Here comes old rosie she's looking mighty fine  
Here comes hot nancy she's steppin' right on time  
There go the street lights bringin on the night  
Here come the men faces hidden from the light  
All through the shadows they come and they go  
With only one thing in common  
They got the fire down below  
  
Here comes the rich man in his big long limousine  
Here comes the poor man all you got to have is green  
Here comes the banker and the lawyer and the cop  
One thing for certain it ain't never gonna stop  
When it all gets too heavy  
That's when they come and go  
With only one thing in common  
They got the fire down below  
  
It happens out in vegas happens in moline  
On the blue blood streets of boston  
Up in berkeley and out in queens  
And it went on yesterday and it's going on tonight  
Somewhere there's somebody ain't treatin' somebody right  
  
And he's looking out for rosie and she's looking mighty fine  
And he's walking the streets for nancy  
And he'll find her everytime  
When the street light flicker bringing on the night  
Well they'll be slipping into darkness slipping out of sight  
All through the midnight  
Watch 'em come and watch 'em go  
With only one thing in common  
They got the fire down below
