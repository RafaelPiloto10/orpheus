Hear what's written on the wind.  
We come to kill and kill again.  
Our arrows fall like hail  
Trample on the dead. - Ride through the  
Gate of clouds - stand on the open step.  
  
Run beserk - spreading fear and pain.  
Black shield and weapons, black our chain.  
None can harm us - not their fire -  
Iron or steel - for we have the  
Will to power - with power we will  
Kill.  
  
Kill with power - die die  
Kill with power - die die  
  
To the war god Odin you will pray.  
And the curse of weapons shall  
Remain. On the blood of all our  
Fathers - on their weapons we now  
Swear to avenge - not lament.  
Give the False ones death.  
  
Kill with power - die die  
Kill with power - die die
