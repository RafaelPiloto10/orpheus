I will be there said my friend of a distant life  
Covered in greens of a golden age, set in stone  
Follow me, "he sounded of dreams supreme" follow me  
Drifting within the glow and the after-glow of the eve  
  
And if that firelight, I could match the inner flame  
  
Sacred ships do sail the seventh age  
  
Cast off your garments of fear, replace them with love  
Most of all play with the game of the age  
Highest of places remain all as one with you  
Giving us light and the freedom of the day  
  
And if that firelight, I could match the inner flame  
  
Sacred ships do sail the seventh age  
And have always been here  
  
Celestial travellers have always been here with us  
Set in the homes of the universe we have yet to go  
Countless expansions will arrive and flow inside of us  
My friend, he of fantasy, dancing with the spirit of the age
