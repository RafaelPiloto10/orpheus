I don't know why I feel this way  
I don't know if it's right or wrong to laugh at misfortune  
Darkness can never last too long  
  
Every time I think I'm falling  
And there's nobody around to hold me up  
And it seems like the world has come to an end  
I look for miles but not a face is friendly  
Then suddenly a hole opens up in the ground  
The bottom of the hole is a raging fire  
I try to jump over but there's no way  
The next thing I know, I'm going down  
  
[Chorus:]  
Does it hurt?  
Oh, it really doesn't matter  
Does it burn?  
Oh, I don't feel a thing  
Does it sting?  
Oh, yeah, it really doesn't matter  
Does it hurt?  
Oh, I don't give a damn  
When I find myself falling and I hit the bottom  
It only makes me laugh  
It only makes me laugh  
When I go down the hole and I hit the bottom  
  
The last time that I fell in love  
The love was milk and honey but the milk turned sour  
The woman became a monster  
And everyone I knew had become a stranger  
And the room went black and my luck was spent  
The floor opened up, down I went  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
It only makes me laugh  
It only makes me laugh  
It only makes me laugh  
Coming right back  
Coming right back  
'Cause you can't keep me down  
Can't keep me down  
Oh, in the ground  
  
Does it hurt?  
Oh, it really doesn't matter  
Does it burn?  
Oh, I don't feel a thing  
I don't mind just a little pain  
Ooh, oh yeah  
Whoa...  
  
Remembering when I was a young man  
How everything seemed to turn against me  
I didn't know a soul, it was an alien place  
The sun was covered by a dark cloud  
And though I tried, I couldn't find a way to escape  
The only way to go was straight down  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
It only makes me laugh  
It only makes me laugh  
It only makes me laugh  
It only makes me laugh  
  
I don't know why I feel this way  
I don't know if it's right or wrong to laugh at misfortune  
Darkness can never last too long...  
When you laugh in it's face  
When you laugh in it's face  
I don't know why I feel this way...
