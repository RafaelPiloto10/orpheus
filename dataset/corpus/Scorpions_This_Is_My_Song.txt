I can't believe what the people say  
There's only hate everywhere  
So many people go different ways  
So many things don't you care  
  
They see nobody, they see themselves  
But a stage like in a show  
They see the hell, and they need your help  
They need your help, they need love, love  
  
This is my song  
I tell you about the story of love  
This is my song  
I tell you about the story of love  
  
This is my song  
I tell you about the story of love  
This is my song  
I tell you about the story of love  
  
I think I need you, you need me too  
The place where we live is here  
The world is griping what can I do  
For you and you everywhere  
  
I sing this song 'bout the world of love  
And hope you hear what I say  
Forever freedom, forever love  
Forever love everyday
