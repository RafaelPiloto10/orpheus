Yeeeaaahhh...  
  
Yeeeaaahhh...  
  
When the world slips you a Geoffrey  
Stroke the furry wall  
Stroke the furry wall  
  
Furry walls don't bring me down  
Furry walls please stay around  
Furry walls  
Furry walls  
  
Furry walls kiss me to sleep  
Furry walls please help me weep  
Furry walls  
Furry walls  
  
Furry walls can take you on a magic carpet ride  
Furry walls surround you till you got no place to hide  
Let your furry fingers be your guide  
  
Furry walls turn out the light  
Furry walls please stay the night  
Furry walls  
Furry walls  
  
Furry walls says have a taste  
Furry walls sit on my face  
Furry walls  
Furry walls  
  
Maybe I'm in heaven with the furry skies above  
All around the furry clouds, look, here's a furry dove  
Let me stroke your furry walls of love  
  
Furry walls  
Furry walls  
  
Furry walls I am amazed  
Furry walls we're in a daze  
Furry walls  
Furry walls  
  
Don't be in a hurry, things are not the way they were  
Shaggy walls of loveliness, it's all a furry blur  
Maybe I'm in heaven with the furry skies above  
All around the furry clouds, look, here's a furry dove  
Let the walls caress you in a showering of love  
  
Furry walls  
Furry walls  
  
Furry walls I'm gonna cry  
Furry walls please let me hide  
  
Furry walls  
Furry walls  
  
Furry walls  
Furry wa-alls  
Furry walls
