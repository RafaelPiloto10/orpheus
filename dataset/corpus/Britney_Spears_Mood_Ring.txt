[Verse 1]  
Look in the mirror  
Who do I see?  
Who do I wanna be today?  
If you came for a show  
Which role should I take?  
Fading to grey  
So did we make a big mistake?  
True colors'll show  
Baby, just put me on display  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Think I've been here before  
I've turned some hearts into stone  
And I can't hide it no more  
[Chorus]  
My love is a mood ring  
Up and down emotions  
All these mood swings  
You know how to read the touch of my skin  
Nothing on my body, but this mood ring  
You change me, ah  
Mood...  
  
[Verse 2]  
I have no secrets  
Cause there's a version of me  
That I don't know how to hide  
When you're making me glow  
With your fingers against my thighs  
(Glow)  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Think I've been here before  
I've turned some hearts into stone  
And I can't hide it no more  
  
[Chorus]  
My love is a mood ring  
Up and down emotions  
All these mood swings  
You know how to read the touch of my skin  
Nothing on my body, but this mood ring  
You change me, ah  
Mood...  
(Nothing on my body, but this mood ring, this mood ring)  
  
[Bridge]  
I'm in the palm of your hand  
My temperature is at your command  
By my demand, and now I'm falling for you  
I turn to golden from blue  
And you do too, ah  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Think I've been here before  
I've turned some hearts into stone  
And I can't hide it no more  
  
[Chorus]  
My love is a mood ring (My love is a mood ring)  
Up and down emotions (Up and down emotions)  
All these mood swings (All these mood swings)  
You know how to read the touch of my skin (My skin)  
Nothing on my body, but this mood ring  
You change me, ah (Yeah)  
Mood...  
(Hey, hey)
