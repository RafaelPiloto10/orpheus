And now I'm denial  
And it don't take no x-ray to see right through my smile  
I know, I'd be on the go  
It ain't no drink out there that could numb my soul no, no  
All we want to do is take these chains off  
All we want to do is break the chains off  
All we want to do is be free  
All we want to do is be free  
All we want to do is take these chains off  
All we want to do is break the chains off  
All we want to do is be free  
All we want to do is be free  
  
Can you tell me why every time I step outside  
I see my niggas down,  
Ooh, I'm letting you know  
That it ain't no gun they can make that could kill my soul  
Oh, no  
  
So now it was like the officer is pulling him inside the car and he's trying
to pull away. At no time di the officer said that he was going to do anything
until he pulled out his weapon was drawn and he said, "I'll shoot you" or,
"I'm going to shoot" and in the same moment, the first shot went off. We
looked down and he was shot and there was blood coming from him. Then we took
off running.

Are we all alone fighting on our own  
Please give me a chance  
I don't wanna dance  
Something's got me down  
I was there my ground,  
Don't just stand around  
Don't just stand around  
  
As we took off running I ducked and hid for my life, because I was fearing for
my life. I hid behind the first car I saw. My friend,he kept running, he
feared for me too. So as the officer was trying to get out the car he pursued
my friend but his weapon was drawn. Now he didn't see any weapon drawn at him
or anything like that, us going for no weapon. His weapon was already drawn.
He shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his
hands in the air, and started to get down, but the officer still approached
with his weapon drawn and he fired seven more shots and my friend died.
