I am a lineman for the county  
And I drive the main road  
Searchin' in the sun for another overload  
I hear you singin' in the wire,  
I can hear you through the whine  
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line  
  
I know I need a small vacation  
But it don't look like rain  
And if it snows that stretch down south won't ever stand the strain  
And I need you more than want you,  
And I want you for all time  
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line  
  
And I need you more than want you,  
And I want you for all time  
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line
