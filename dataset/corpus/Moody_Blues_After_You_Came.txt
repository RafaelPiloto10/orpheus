Since it began I got one dream and it's really my only blessing  
If I can come through than so can you  
And you will find there's no regretting  
Things you want from your life's font  
Will never let your spirit roam  
Come back to Earth for what it's worth  
For you've been dreaming of a ceiling not a home  
  
[Chorus]  
I've been doing my best  
What else can I do?  
Is there something I've missed  
That will help you through  
  
I have reached the top of the wall  
And all I've found is another way to fall  
  
For some short time  
For a while you and I were joined to eternity  
Then we split in two back tome and you  
Like the rain rising from the sea  
Rising from the sea  
We all can see what we shall be  
But knowing's not really controlling  
With time perhaps I will pass the traps and find some peace and understanding  
After you'd come and while you're gone  
You leave me guessing, it's depressing  
Never to know the way to go to find some time along a little less pressing  
So you just have to laugh  
When it hurts so much  
You're so far away and so hard to touch  
  
I have reached the top of the wall  
And all I've found is another way to fall  
  
Since it began I got one dream and it's really my only blessing  
If I can come through than so can you  
And you will find there's no regretting  
Things you want from your life's font  
Will never let your spirit roam  
Come back to Earth for what it's worth  
For you've been dreaming of a ceiling not a home  
  
[Chorus]
