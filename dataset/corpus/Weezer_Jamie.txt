Jamie, what you doin' now  
What you doin' now girl?  
Please, please tell me  
'Cause I need to know, I need to know now  
  
When I was down, you came to me  
And promised you'd always be  
By my side, now you're gone  
And I'm waiting patiently  
Jamie, I want you to know  
Jamie, Jamie, I'm so glad you're mine  
We'll be together a long time  
  
Jamie, what ya doing now?  
Who's dialin' your car phone?  
Please, please be true  
You know that I trust you, do that which you must do  
  
Chorus  
You've got the Beach Boys, and your firm's got the Stones  
But I know you won't leave me alone  
Sometimes it seems you're not with me  
It hurts me so much, It hurts me so much  
Sometimes it seems you're not with me  
It hurts me so much, It hurts me so much  
You are the most, you're so rad, you're so fresh  
And I'm so glad I am yours, you are mine  
Show me where and I will sign  
  
Chorus  
Jaime, believe me, I won't let you down  
'cause you are the best lawyer in town  
Sometimes it seems you're not with me  
It hurts me so much, It hurts me so much  
Sometimes it seems you're not with me  
It hurts me so much, It hurts me so much  
I love you so much, I love you so much
