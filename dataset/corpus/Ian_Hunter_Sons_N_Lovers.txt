I was your baby-you were my girl  
When I asked you to marry me- the tears fell  
  
Sons n' lovers, sons n' lovers, waving  
My childhood goodbye-it seems so sad  
Well how long have you been my best friend  
This won't be the end of  
Sons n' lovers-sons n' lovers--she won't wanna talk anymore about it  
  
You were my lady- I was your number one  
When I said I was leaving- tears run  
  
Sons n' lovers-sons n' lovers, breakin'  
Tryin' not to hurt each others hearts  
Well how long can we exist- I know  
We can't go on like this  
Sons n' lovers-son's and lovers--i don't wanna lie anymore  
  
Was that you I saw--walkin' out along the shore  
Was that you I saw-talkin' to him  
Was that you I saw-puttin' his hands in yours  
That's alright ma- you can still love him  
That's alright ma- you can still love  
And through the years-you know- we will remember  
Time will never take old times away  
How long for you to discover that- there still some strings attached to  
Sons n' lovers-sons and lovers  
But I don't wanna play anymore  
Sons n' lovers
