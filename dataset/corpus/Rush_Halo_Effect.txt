What did I see?  
Fool that I was  
A goddess, with wings on her heels  
All my illusions  
Projected on her  
The ideal, that I wanted to see  
  
What did I know?  
Fool that I was  
Little by little, I learned  
My friends were dismayed  
To see my betrayed  
But they knew they could never tell me  
  
What did I care?  
Fool that I was  
Little by little, I burned  
Maybe sometimes  
There might be a flaw  
But how pretty the picture was back then  
  
What did I do?  
Fool that I was  
To profit from youthful mistakes?  
It's shameful to tell  
How often I fell  
In love with illusions again  
  
What did I do?  
Fool that I was  
To profit from youthful mistakes?  
So shameful to tell  
Just how often I fell  
In love with illusions again  
  
A goddess with wings on her heels
