Now Pluto girls are neat but you know they'll  
Eat you up alive  
Although they're nice to know when it's a thousand below  
It isn't easy to survive  
And Neptune girls are great for dancing  
With a dozen arms and legs  
They really hold you tight and they can boogie all night  
But it's so hard to kiss three heads  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wish they all could be California girls  
I wish they all could be California girls  
  
Now Martian girls are really pretty  
With complexions bright and green  
But nothing can surpass an andromeda lass  
I think their pointed heads are keen  
And Saturn girls are really funny they can  
Make you laugh to death  
With methane clouds alas combined with hydrogen gas  
Why it's a chore to take a breath  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wish they all could be California girls  
I wish they all could be California girls  
  
[guitar solo]  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wish they all could be California girls  
I wish they all could be California girls (etc. Etc.)  
  
[Chours ii] - girls- girls- girls- girls -I need  
Girls -girls- girls- girls - I need... (etc. Etc.)  
  
[Chorus iii]- Calif--ornia Calif--ornia Calif-- ornia  
Calif--ornia Calif--ornia Calif-- ornia
