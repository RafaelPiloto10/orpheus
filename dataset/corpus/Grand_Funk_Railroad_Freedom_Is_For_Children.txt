I wrote the words of freedom,  
I've even sung the song.  
But freedom is for children,  
'cause they don't understand what's wrong.  
  
The children are so very lucky,  
'cause they're not old enough to know.  
Not old enough to realize,  
But they'll find out as they grow.  
  
The children are so very lucky,  
But, on the other hand, who's gonna' save the land?  
The children are so very lucky,  
But man's invention is gonna' be the prevention of their life.  
  
This song is nearly over,  
And so's the world and the day.  
There's something missin',  
But who will listen enough to do what it will take?  
  
Freedom is for children. why can't it be for me?  
Freedom is for children. why can't it be for me?  
  
Freedom is for children. why can't it be for me?  
Freedom is for children. why can't it be for me?  
Freedom is for children. why can't it be for me?
