This is my place  
And I want to share it with you  
  
I got myself a place to dream  
I touch the wind  
Caress the sea  
And I want you there  
To hold me  
To love me there is to know me  
  
Where the silver bird of tomorrow  
Will fly away with the sorrow  
And time won't pass for you and I  
We'll be standing still  
As the world goes by  
  
This is my place  
And I want to share it with you  
  
I've got the sky to shelter me  
And like the tide I'm moving free  
I've waited here for you only  
We will walk along  
Never lonely  
  
This is my retreat, we're together  
And my place is now even better  
My life's reflected on the sand  
And it shows my love  
When I touch your hand  
  
This is my place  
And I want to share it with you  
I want to share, I want to share it with you  
This is my place  
  
And you know wherever your place is  
Loving only makes it better  
And I want you there to hold me  
To love me there is to know me  
  
Where the silver bird of tomorrow  
Will fly away with the sorrow  
And time won't pass for you and I  
We'll be standing still  
As the world goes round  
  
This is my place  
This is my place  
This is my place
