Chorus  
Why do why do I do  
Could it wait  
For me to realize that  
I can't make it in there  
'Cause I'm a traitor  
To believe it  
Pull back your hair  
And stop the show  
  
I got my clock  
It's twenty after  
My mind is numb  
Awaiting stimulant  
And if I break my head  
Don't shake my hand unless  
You'll charge it to  
Your spiritual credit card  
And I will take a step away  
So I can't be that happy  
  
Chorus  
  
I let my breath  
Go slow like longitude  
I'll let my eyes  
Go slow to follow you  
And if I break my head  
Don't shake my hand unless  
You have your pride  
In a drawer in my front desk, so  
Don't take a step away  
It doesn't make me feel good  
  
Chorus  
  
Before that  
Right  
In my head  
Break  
And then instead  
Forty-two hours away  
Where?  
It's in my head  
Break  
And then instead  
When you whisper  
Far away  
Another gone to yesterday  
And I will break my head  
I'm already here  
I'm already here  
I'm already here  
  
I don't need anything from you  
You needed nothing from me  
I don't have anything  
That you could give to me  
  
I don't have anything for you  
You needed nothing from me  
There's nothing that you can give  
To make me feel complete  
  
I don't need anything from you  
You needed nothing from me
