CHORUS  
TOMMOROW IS A BETTER DAY  
TOMMOROW YOU WILL SEE THE WAY  
WHEN GOD IS BY YOUR SIDE TO STAY  
JUST KEEP ON MOVIN DONT YOU DARE GIVE UP  
  
THERE ARE TIMES, IN OUR LIVES,WHEN WE ALL FEEL INSIDE  
SOMTHINGS WRONG THERES GOTTA BE SOMTHING BETTER FOR ME  
SO WE TRY ON OUR OWN TO CHANGE OUR PATHS  
BUT WE DONT EVEN REALIZE THAT JOY COMES AFTER THE RAIN  
LIFE BEGINS AGAIN  
  
THERE ARE TIMES, TIMES WE CAN BE SWAYED SO EASILY  
DOUBT CAN COME IN MY IND AND IM READY TO GIVE UP THIS TIME  
BUT I GOTTA KEEP GOIN ON GOTTA KEEP ON MOVIN  
GOTTA KEEP ON PRESSIN IT THROUGH  
CAUSE I KNOW MY GOD IS ABLE OHH HE'S MORE THAN ABLE  
ITS NO THING TO TAKE CARE OF YOU I SAY  
  
BRIDGE  
HE KNOWS OF EVERYTHING YOU GOING THROUGH  
HAS ENOUGH LOVE TO TAKE CARE OF YOU  
YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED TO DO  
SO JUST KEEP ON MOVIN'  
  
SPECIAL NOTE: PRAY FOR OUR NATION AND TROOPS  
GOD BLESS  
SHAKBATINA
