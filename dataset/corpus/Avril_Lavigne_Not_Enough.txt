I'm sorry if this hurts you,  
But I tried to keep what we had once,  
I was wrong it wasn't keeping me awake,  
  
You didn't listen, you didn't listen  
You didn't hear me, you didn't hear me  
When I said I want more, I got no more  
You weren't stealing me away  
  
Oh it's not enough,  
It's not enough to give me what it is I want  
It's not enough,  
It's not enough to get me, everything I need  
And I, I wish it was  
I think it's time to give this up  
  
All, all, all, all  
All, all, all, all, all  
All the memories that we're losing  
All the time that I spent with you everyday  
I think is running down the drain  
  
I'm feeling (feelin') that we're fading  
Don't make this as hard as you think it would be  
It's a lot easier than it seems yeah  
  
It's not enough,  
It's not enough to give me what it is I want  
It's not enough,  
It's not enough to get me, everything I need  
And I, I wish it was  
I think it's time to give this up  
  
And I can feel we're falling down slowly, slowly  
I can see us starting to drown, can't stop it now  
I can see we're burning out  
So show me, show me  
How you gonna turn it around?  
Because  
  
It's not enough  
Its not enough to give me what it is I want  
It's not enough  
Its not enough to get me everything I need  
It's not enough  
Its not enough to give me what it is I want  
It's not enough  
Its not enough to get me everything I need  
And I wish it was  
I think its time to give this up  
  
It's not enough  
It's not enough to give me what it is I want  
It's not enough  
It's not enough to get me everything I need  
It's not enough  
It's not enough to give me what it is I want  
It's not enough  
It's not enough to get me
