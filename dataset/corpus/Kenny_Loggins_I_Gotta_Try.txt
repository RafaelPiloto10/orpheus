Maybe it's true what they say about it  
Maybe we can't make the ends meet  
Maybe we'll all have to do without it  
Maybe this world's just incomplete  
Still we all look for truth in our lives  
Searching from different sides  
If it's so hard living in a desperate world  
But we all do the best that we can  
Some people dream a change  
Some will remain the same  
All of us live their lives  
Under the gun  
Some see the road as clear  
Some say the end is here  
They say it's a hopeless fight  
But I say, I gotta try  
Maybe there's too much to think about  
Maybe there just ain't nothing left to say  
But if our time's really running out  
Then this is no time to run away  
'Cause we're destined to look for truth in this life  
Blinded by tearful eyes  
If it's no use trying in a desperate world  
Then tell me, why was I born?  
Some people see a change  
Some will remain the same  
All of us live their lives  
Under the gun  
Some see the road as clear  
Some say the end is here  
They say it's a hopeless fight  
But I say, I gotta try  
Lonely, living so lonely  
Is it too late  
To turn it all around?  
Some people dream a change  
Some will remain the same  
All of us live their lives  
Under the gun  
Some see the road as clear  
Some say the end is here  
They say it's a hopeless fight  
But I say, I gotta try  
I gotta change  
The world just remains the same  
All of us live our lives  
Under the gun  
Someone's sleeping  
Someone's giving up  
Someone's trying  
Someone's crying out  
Still we live under the gun
