The way you treat me baby  
Cheat and tell me lies  
I guess I shouldn't care at all  
But still I sympathize  
  
'Cause you've got heart trouble, comin' on  
Yeah you got heart trouble comin' on  
Well you think that you don't need me baby  
But you're gonna miss me when I'm gone  
  
You say that love can't touch you  
You feel no pain at all  
You think that you're above it baby  
But I believe you'll fall  
  
'Cause you've got heart trouble, comin' on  
Yeah you got heart trouble comin' on  
Well, you'll get down on your knees baby  
Beggin' me to come back home  
  
You tell me, you'll find someone else  
But on one's gonna care  
'Cause you have left a trail  
Of broken hearts everywhere  
  
Now, you'll got heart trouble comin' on  
Yeah, you'll got heart trouble comin' on  
Well you'll know just how it feels baby  
When you're left here all alone
