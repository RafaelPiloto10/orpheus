Any old time  
You got your tuned in  
Baby by your side  
And your pretty little cool ride  
It feels so good  
You got the top pulled in  
Wind in your hair  
Destination you don't care  
  
Now move it on up  
You know it's steerin' all rite  
Foot's to the floor  
But you think that you can domore  
Wind shield clean  
And the nite is so brite  
Baby so near  
And She's givin' you a green lite  
  
Great sound on the radio  
She feels something  
Now you know there's no place that you'd rather be  
  
Great sounds..  
  
Any old time  
You got your tuned in  
Baby by your side  
And your pretty little cool ride
