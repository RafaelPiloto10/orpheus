From the City of Constellations  
To the wanderer  
And a Place of Rains  
He journeys on  
The City of hesitation and doubt  
The Island if the house the color of the sea  
The Plain of Mementoes  
He journeys on to find his love  
Th Valley of lost time  
The City of End and Endlessness  
The Isle of Revenents  
He journeys on  
The City of Solitudes  
The City of distance from you  
The City of Words of blue  
And yellow and red and green  
He journeys on to find his love  
  
Where the road takes him through  
The City of Sleep  
The thinking that does not end in within him  
Then he dreams  
The road takes him  
This man who is searching  
It brings him  
In silence through the night  
Where the Cities that do not Exist, exist  
It brings him  
In silence through the night  
Close to the City of Realizations  
It is here one finds the way  
Mount Orison  
The City of Days  
The Tree of the lost  
He journeys on  
North of his love  
A road through a valley of darkness  
The islands that are not of this world  
He journeys on to find his love  
  
It is a long way through darkness  
To the way of the eremite  
To the eremite sings of the world and of  
The journey of love, which is not lost in eternity  
The Valley where the moon is caught in trees  
Water shows the hidden heart  
Endlong into midnight  
He journeys on  
The parable of day  
The Room of Books  
Where the winds come to him and say
