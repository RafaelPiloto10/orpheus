Baby, I'm Lying all alone,  
The pillow is all I have to hold,  
I can't feel you, God it isn't fair,  
With out you, I so wanna take you there  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't hang up, its just gettin serious now  
Ur making me delerious  
Don't hang up  
Till I've finished with you  
I'm not alone  
  
I'm not alone, I am not alone  
I can still feel you  
Even when I'm lonely, and now I'm coming to  
X2  
  
Tell me, tell me what you see  
Feel me, feel me on my knee  
Slowly we began to breathe  
Hold on, holdon to your beliefs  
  
Chorus  
  
Your far away, well we'll find a way  
O baby, now lets make it right  
Close your eyes  
  
Chorus  
  
Don't hang up  
  
Do you feel it too?  
Close your eyes
