In the day I can smile though I want to die  
I hold on, hold on  
I can keep it together for a little while  
And be strong, so strong  
But when the sun goes down and I'm all alone  
I haven't the strength to fight  
That's when my tears give into the night  
Tell me how, How much loneliness can one heart take  
Without the chance that it will break in two  
And why I'm holding on to a love that has gone  
Tell me how to carry on  
  
I believed that meeting you would be my destiny  
Your love would come to set me free  
So why am I left standing here alone  
Won't you please come and take me home  
  
Tears give into the night  
In the day I can smile though I want to die  
Tears give into the night  
I can keep it together for a little while  
In the day I can smile though I want to die  
Tears give into the night
