Smiling in their faces  
While filling up the hole  
So many dirty little places  
In your filthy little worn out  
Broken down see through soul  
  
Baby's got a problem  
Tries so hard to hide  
Got to keep it on the surface  
Because everything else is dead on the other side  
  
Teeth in the necks of everyone you know  
You can keep on sucking until the blood won't flow  
When it starts to hurt it only helps it grow  
Taking all you need  
(but not this time)  
No, you don't  
  
And just for the record  
Just so you know  
I did not believe  
That you could sink so low  
  
You think that you can beat them  
I know that you won't  
You think you have everything  
But no, you don't  
  
No, you don't  
No, you don't  
No, you don't  
No, you don't
