Every time it rains, it rains pennies from heaven  
Don'tcha know each cloud contains pennies from heaven?  
(You'll find your fortune fallin' all over town)  
(Be sure that your umbrella)  
Is upside down  
  
Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers  
If you want the things you love, you must have showers  
(So when you hear it thunder) Don't run under a tree  
There'll be pennies from heaven for you and me
