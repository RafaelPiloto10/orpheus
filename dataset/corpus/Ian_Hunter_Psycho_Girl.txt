(honest john plain)  
If I'd known then what I know now  
I'd do it all again 'cause I'm crazy and how  
About my mixed-up, messed-up pretty little psycho girl  
I should've given her a swift body swerve  
I didn't so I got what I deserve  
A freaked-out, spaced-out crazy little psycho girl  
Psycho girl - look what you're doing  
How come you have to be this way?  
Psycho girl - you'll be my ruin  
With the softy things you do - the silly things you say  
Oh oh psycho girl  
She's my cross to bear, my ball and chain  
A monkey on my back, she gets into my brain  
But I love my washed out, freaked out psycho girl  
Yeah, if I'd known then what I know now  
I wouldn't change a thing, no way no how  
'cause I love my blown out, zonked out psycho girl  
So what if she's mixed up, messed up, freaked out  
Washed up, fucked up, spaced out  
I'm no doubt - I'm crazy about my psycho girl  
Psycho - psycho girl
