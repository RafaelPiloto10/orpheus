Verse:  
(Drake)  
  
I'm Tryin To Do It All Tonight, I Got Plans  
I Got A Certain Lust For Life, And As It Stands  
Everything Is Goin' As Right, As It Can  
They Tryna Shoot Down My Flight,  
Before It Lands... Before It Lands  
  
But You Can Miss Me With All That,  
Diss Me Then Crawl Back,  
I Really Wish Ya'll Would Fall Back,  
But Gettin' Rich Suppose To Solve That,  
And These Days Women Make Offers,  
And Who The Hell Am I To Say (No, No, No),  
My Ex Send Late Night Text,  
Cause She Don't Know How To Let (Go, Go, Go),  
She In Love,  
And As For Them Pretty Light Skinned Models Standin' In The Cold,  
Aw Yah They With Us,  
Let Them Girls In For A Drink,  
And I'm All, In They Ear,  
Saying She Should Be The One I See,  
Everytime, That I'm Here,  
But When Am I Really Even Here,  
Black Surburban With The Tint On It,  
Fresher Than A Pillow With A Mint On It,  
The Game Got These Old Hand Prints On It,  
But Imma Be The One To Pour Cement On It,  
Uh, And Start Over,  
And Show Up In A Mars Yellow Tux,  
I Don't Really Give A fuck And We Only Gettin' Older,  
So What I Tend To Do, Is To Think Of Today As The Past,  
It's Funny When You're Coming In First,  
But You Hope That You Last (You Just Hope That It Lasts)  
  
Throw Your One's Up In The Air  
Throw Your One's Up In The Air For Her  
Throw Your One's Up In The Air  
Throw Your One's Up
