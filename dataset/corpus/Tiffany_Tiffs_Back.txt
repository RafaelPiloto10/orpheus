Tiff's back  
Tiff's back  
Didn't mean to stay away this long  
But now I'm back and I'm groovin' strong  
It's time to move, can't wait no more  
I really got to do it, so get to it  
Didn't want to move too fast  
Now I got to make it last, oh yeah  
Tiff's back  
Tiff's back (na na na na)  
Yes, I am now  
My dancin' feet, my dancin' shoes  
We're ready to go, you'll never lose  
Don't be so shy, just get on track  
Let me tell you now tiff's back  
Didn't want to move too slow  
I had to keep on the go  
Tiff's back  
Tiff's back (na na na na)  
Yes, I am now  
Tiff's back  
Tiff's back (na na na na)  
Tiff's back (na na na na)  
Hey tiff you're all the way live  
Get it girl, get it girl  
Do that jive  
And the next time when you're  
On the mic receiver  
Think about me  
The girl you'd make a co-believer  
Tiff's back  
Tiff's back  
Tiff's back  
Tiff's back  
I'm back and I'm groovin' real strong  
I hope you come along  
I'm back and I'm coming to your town  
I hope you'll be around
