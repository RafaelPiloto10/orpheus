He gets you in your dreams, thats somtin' you dont under stand  
So sit back Jack I'm gonna bust a rythm

And if you dont know yet, your gonna find out why  
  
D-Dont fall asleep, asleep  
  
(Chorus)  
Three A.M. Freddy's here, on M T.V. gonna bust a rythm  
when you see him coming down better lock the door  
Watch out for Freddy and busta rythms  
  
Even if the dream worrios fails and Mr. big time Fredy Kruger prvails  
It'l be on Prime time, but you'll never frget, what he did to the girl with
the tv set  
but you cant stop Freddy because he's cold as ice  
he'll come back at ya to slash and slice like a gistu blade

And if you feel like your tired, and ready for bed  
Dont fall asleep, of you'll wake up dead
