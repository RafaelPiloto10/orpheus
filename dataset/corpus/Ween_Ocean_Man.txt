Ocean man, take me by the hand, lead me to the land that you understand  
Ocean man, the voyage to the corner of the globe is a real trip  
Ocean man, the crust of a tan man imbibed by the sand  
Soaking up the thirst of the land  
  
Ocean man, can you see through the wonder of amazement at the oberman  
Ocean man, the crust is elusive when it casts forth to the childlike man  
Ocean man, the sequence of a life form braised in the sand,  
Soaking up the thirst of the land  
  
Ocean man, ocean man  
Ocean man  
  
Ocean man, take me by the hand, lead me to the land that you understand  
Ocean man, the voyage to the corner of the globe is a real trip  
Ocean man, the crust of a tan man imbibed by the sand  
Soaking up the thirst of the land  
  
Ocean man, can you see through the wonder of amazement at the oberman  
Ocean man, the crust is elusive when it casts forth to the childlike man  
Ocean man, the sequence of a life form braised in the sand,  
Soaking up the thirst of the land  
  
Ocean man
