She's been around a couple years  
Tasted 31 flavors there's only one  
She really hates that would be vanilla  
The blandest one don't make her scream  
And that's what she likes to hear the most  
  
Liza's been around the block  
She's currently a femme bitch top  
A giant step from old Louise  
Now she's the one who's on the prey  
  
She used to wear her hair short long  
Determining her preference  
She didn't like that dynamic  
Trading in her flannel shirts  
For six inch heels, latex skirts  
She even bought herself some bras  
  
Miss terrence, sellers akin  
She's got more power feminine  
She knows the power incites fear  
And it's that fear  
Which makes her wet  
She's going to the Tribe 8 show  
Plenty of boychicks to choose from  
It's at the Calyx of Isis  
She'll find a bottom young butch  
She'll tell her  
"I won't hurt you much  
Unless of course  
You want me to"
