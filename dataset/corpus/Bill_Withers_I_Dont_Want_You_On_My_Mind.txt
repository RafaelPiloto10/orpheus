I don't want you on my mind all the time  
I believe that it shows a sign of weakness  
I don't want no lonely nights that gets me cryin'  
I found out I don't get nowhere with weakness  
Every dream about you  
I just wake up knowing that I've got to do without you  
  
I don't want all the time doin' up my mind  
I don't want you on my mind all the time  
  
I don't want you on my mind all the time  
I believe that it shows a sign of weakness  
I don't want no lonely nights that gets me cryin'  
I found out I don't get nowhere with weakness  
Every dream about you  
I just wake up knowing that I got to do without you  
  
I don't want all the time doin' up my mind  
I don't want you on my mind all the time
