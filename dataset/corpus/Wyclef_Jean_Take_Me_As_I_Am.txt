You make the whole  
Me cry you make the sould in  
Me die whats the problem  
First of all you say true love  
Is hard to find  
  
I'm true and I have  
Love I'll be good to you  
Seems to me I'm  
Not what you need  
  
Just take me as I'am  
Don't leave me here alone  
Just take me as I'am  
I cant be a better person but  
I can be a better man  
Take me as I 'am  
  
All though physical things change  
And a friendship through reality can  
Change at the same time trying  
To maintain why this shit is the same  
  
Just take me as I'am  
Don't leave me here alone  
Just take me as I'am  
I cant be a better person but  
I can be a better man  
Take me as I 'am  
Just take me as I'am  
Don't leave me here alone  
Just take me as I'am  
I cant be a better person but  
I can be a better man  
Take me as I 'am
