Dying on my feet  
Sure beats living on my knees  
These hands around my neck  
They get tighter as you squeeze  
I'd crawl across the water, baby  
Just to get away from you  
Take my life but make it shorter  
Seems the least that you could do  
  
Reach out  
Someone reach out to me  
Cause I've lost my way  
Sometimes we  
Give into things, when we lie and cheat,  
Say things  
My life's crumbling down  
Time for me to pray  
Hold me in  
Deep inside, cause I'm dying on my feet  
  
Life is hard  
But I think, "Compared to what?"  
Can't see the things you get to  
But deserve just what you got  
Will you still forgive me baby  
If I don't come back for more  
Everything that ever mattered baby  
Is locked behind your door  
  
Can't judge  
Things I don't understand  
Since you walked away  
Easy to  
Feel this way,  
Cause I'm back on the street, well  
Life is  
A game you can't win  
You can only play  
Here I am  
I'm just dying,  
I'm just dying,  
I'm just dying!  
  
Reach out  
Someone reach out to me  
Cause I've lost my way  
Sometimes we  
Give into things, when we lie and cheat,  
Say things  
My life's crumbling down  
Time for me to pray  
Hold me in  
Deep inside, cause I'm dying,  
I'm just dying, I'm just dying
