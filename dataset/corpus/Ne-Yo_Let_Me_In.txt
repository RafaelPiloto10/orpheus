First off let me start by saying  
I ain't trying to get in your jeans  
First I'd rather learn your ups and downs  
And everything in between  
  
I wanna know you, your insecurities  
Secrets and your needs  
I want your mental and your physical too  
And once I've got it I won't stop  
Until you know you're beautiful  
  
I just wanna make ya feel beautiful  
Wanna make ya feel beautiful, girl, that's all I wanna do  
Girl, just let me make ya feel beautiful  
Let me make ya feel beautiful 'cause you are beautiful  
  
I just wanna make ya feel beautiful  
Wanna make ya feel beautiful, girl, that's all I wanna do  
Girl, just let me make ya feel beautiful  
Let me make ya feel beautiful 'cause you are beautiful  
  
Beautiful as Sunday in the Spring  
Saturday in the Fall  
Beautiful as poetry oh, when you look at me  
Saying nothing at all  
  
I want you to know this  
Girl, I want you to see that it's real  
I want you to feel that you're my focus  
And girl that's what you'll be  
Until I make you see that you are beautiful  
  
I just wanna make ya feel beautiful  
Wanna make ya feel beautiful, girl, that's all I wanna do  
Girl, just let me make ya feel beautiful  
Let me make ya feel beautiful 'cause you are beautiful  
  
I just wanna make ya feel beautiful  
Wanna make ya feel beautiful, girl, that's all I wanna do  
Girl, just let me make ya feel beautiful  
Let me make ya feel beautiful 'cause you are beautiful  
  
There's so much for ya, girl, I know that you're beautiful  
Right from your head to your toe you are so beautiful  
There's so much for ya, girl, I know that you're beautiful  
Baby from your head to your toe you are so beautiful  
  
I just wanna make ya feel beautiful  
Wanna make ya feel beautiful, girl, that's all I wanna do  
Girl, just let me make ya feel beautiful  
Let me make ya feel beautiful 'cause you are beautiful  
  
I just wanna make ya feel beautiful  
Wanna make ya feel beautiful, girl, that's all I wanna do  
Girl, just let me make ya feel beautiful  
Let me make ya feel beautiful 'cause you are beautiful
