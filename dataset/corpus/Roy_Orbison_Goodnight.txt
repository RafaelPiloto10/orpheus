My Lovely woman child  
I found you out running wild with someone new  
You've been untrue, And everybody knows we're through  
  
But I can't say goodbye to you, No matter what you do  
My heart won't let you go, Although I know you go  
With someone new, I think of you  
  
I think of how you kiss, Your tenderness  
With all of this, I miss the way you say goodnight  
  
Bittersweet, your kisses, When my heart still misses  
The way that things used to be, But I know you're strong for  
Other arms you long for, And you can never come back to me  
  
Not just for yesterday, tonight or tomorrow  
Ah, but forever  
I'll hear you say goodnight, goodnight  
Goodnight turned out to be a lie  
And I can't help it if I cry  
Goodnight my love, Sleep tight my love  
Goodnight
