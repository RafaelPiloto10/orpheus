By the light of the moon  
I sing to you  
By the light of the moon  
I raise my voice  
I raise my voice  
By the light of the stars  
In a big black void  
And straight into your heart.  
  
By the light of the moon  
I sing to you  
By the light of the moon  
I raise my voice  
I raise my voice  
By the light of the stars  
In a big black void  
And straight into your heart.  
  
I don't have too many words  
I am not sophisticated  
Listen to the crying birds  
They call you in my name  
Let me be your desert wind  
Rattle you when you're sedated  
For a soul so far elated  
Cannot experience shame  
  
By the light of the moon  
I sing to you  
By the light of the moon  
I raise my voice  
I raise my voice  
By the light of the stars  
In a big black void  
And straight into your heart.  
  
I don't have too many words  
I am not sophisticated  
Listen to the crying birds  
They call you in my name  
Let me be your desert wind  
Rattle you when you're sedated  
For a soul so far elated  
Cannot experience shame  
  
By the light of the sun  
I'm happy and gay  
All pristine and squeaky-clean  
The good and proper way  
  
By the light of the sun  
I'm an innocent lamb  
But the light of the moon  
Reveals the wild horse that I am...  
Reveals the wild horse that I am...  
  
I don't have too many words  
I am not sophisticated  
Listen to the crying birds  
They call you in my name  
Let me be your desert wind  
Rattle you when you're sedated  
For a soul so far elated  
Cannot experience shame  
It's all annihilated by her flame  
It's all annihilated by her flame  
It's all annihilated by her flame!  
  
By the light of the moon  
I sing to you  
By the light of the moon  
I raise my voice  
I raise my voice  
By the light of the stars  
In a big black void  
And it's going straight into you heart.  
  
By the light of the moon  
I sing to you  
By the light of the stars  
Straight into you heart
