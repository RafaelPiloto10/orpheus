Round your finger  
Token of the love we give one another  
Music of the future that we'll discover  
Promises to keep more than any other  
Symbolising all that we share  
  
The ring is magic  
The ring is power  
Like a candle in the dark for everyone to see  
The ring is madness  
The ring is fire  
And it burns with all the brightness of the sun  
  
In a circle  
Living in a world of perpetual motion  
Turning with the tide of a restless ocean  
Spinning on the wheel of your own emotion  
Ridin on a wild carrousel  
You'll be turning round and round  
Round and round we go  
  
Promises, promises, promises, promises  
  
Round your finger  
After all the years we've been together  
Walking in the sun and stormy weather  
Sharing in a moment to last forever  
Memories and dreams without end  
  
The ring is magic  
The ring is power  
And it finds you in the darkness of the night  
The ring is madness  
The ring is fire  
And it guides you when you're blinded by the light  
  
The ring is magic  
The ring is power  
Like a candle in the dark for all to see  
The ring is madness  
The ring is fire  
And it burns with all the brightness of the sun  
  
The ring is magic, magic, fire, fire  
The ring is mine
