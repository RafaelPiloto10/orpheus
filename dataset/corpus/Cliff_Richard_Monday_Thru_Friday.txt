Five days a week I'm just abiding my time  
Fill in the hours till the weekend's mine  
All day long I've got my radio on  
Keeps me going till my work is done  
Monday through to Friday  
Nothing goes my way  
Just working staying alive  
Monday through to Sunday  
There's only one day  
Saturday is rock 'n' roll time  
Work for the man just to get my pay  
Too many hours in the working day  
Dead on my feet but I need the cash  
Roll on Saturday make it fast  
Monday through to Friday  
Nothing goes my way  
Just working staying alive  
Monday through to Sunday  
There's only one day  
Saturday is rock 'n' roll time  
I pay my dues to the union man  
Don't get too heavy, that's the way I am  
I live for rock 'n' roll and Saturday night  
I hear the music and I feel alright, feel alright  
Monday through to Friday  
Nothing goes my way  
Just working staying alive  
Monday through to Sunday  
There's only one day  
Saturday is rock 'n' roll time
