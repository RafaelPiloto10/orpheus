East of the sun and west of the moon  
We'll build a dream house of love, dear  
Near to the sun in the day, near to the moon at night  
We'll live in a lovely way, dear, living our love in pale moonlight  
  
Just you and I  
Forever and a day  
Love will not die  
We'll keep it that way  
  
Up among the stars we'll find  
A harmony of life to a lovely tune  
East of the sun and west of the moon, yes  
East of the sun and west of the moon
