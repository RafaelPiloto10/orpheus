I can see you come to gossip and they tell me so and so  
But there's not a thing about him I don't already know  
I guess you think I'm crazy but it keeps him here with me  
And I only see the things I wanna see  
I only see the things I wanna see where he's concerned  
It wouldn't do my heart no good believe in what I've learned  
I can't face the truth about the man he'll never be  
So I only see the things I wanna see  
[ piano ]  
I only see the things I wanna see where he's concerned  
It wouldn't do my heart much good believe in what I've learned  
But it's worth all my heartaches when I have him here with me  
So I only see the things I wanna see yes I only see the things I wanna see
