You can roll that stone  
To the top of the hill  
Drag your ball and chain  
Behind you  
  
You can carry that weight  
With an iron will  
Or let the pain remain  
Behind you  
  
Chip away the stone  
(Sisyphus)  
Chip away the stone  
Make the burden lighter  
If you must roll that rock alone  
  
You can drive those wheels  
To the end of the road  
You will still find the past right  
Behind you  
  
The weight of the load  
Try to put the sins of the past night  
Behind you  
  
Carve away the stone  
(Sisyhpus)  
Carve away the stone  
Make a graven image  
With some features of your own  
  
You call roll the stone  
To the top of the hill  
You can carry that weight  
With an iron will  
You can drive those wheels  
To the end of the road  
You can try to deny  
The weight of the load  
  
Roll away the stone  
(Sisyhpus)  
Roll away the stone  
If you could just move yours  
I could get working on my own
