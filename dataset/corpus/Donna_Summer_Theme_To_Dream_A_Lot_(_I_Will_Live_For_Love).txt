Theme to Dream a Lot (I will live for love) By, Donna Summers  
  
There's got to be a way that I can dream  
Simply close my eyes and see  
The worlds I've never known  
What places that my soul has been  
  
Sometimes I need to run away and hide  
I sail along so high  
Till nothing's in my sky  
Except the stars that fill my eyes  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm searching for the one who holds the key  
To all this crazy life I lead  
Through galaxies in time  
A solitary star that joins  
  
Sometimes I need to close my eyes and breathe  
Inhale what life has given me  
A bastion to ignite  
A flaming heart in flight  
I close my eyes  
I breathe  
I'm free  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I've always must have known  
A lover of his own  
'Cause that is when he wrote  
Everything I felt for love  
  
And I will fight for love in life and in love  
And I will hold the things above  
I'm strong enough to slay the dragon that's there  
I will live for love  
  
I've thought about this life  
This dream will never die  
So only know that I  
I will live for love  
  
Always must have known a lover of his own  
That is when he wrote everything I felt for love  
I will ever fight  
I will live for life  
I will live for love
