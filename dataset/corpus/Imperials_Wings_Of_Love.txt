Deep in a land made of man's toil and trouble, where I fight for my life,  
I've found an island of refuge to run to, to escape from the strife,  
When tempters arise to destroy me,  
When life is much more than one heart can take,  
There is someone who protects me.  
  
Living under your wings of love,  
Safe in the arms of the mighty God,  
Living under your wings of love,  
Safe in the arms of the mighty God.  
  
Oh,  
Oh, ooh.  
  
Captive, by choice, of the strength that surrounds me - I just can't walk
away,  
I hear your voice say how much you love me, how you want me to stay,  
Warmed by the breath of your Spirit, I rest my head on your pillow,  
Covered where nothing can harm me.  
  
Living under your wings of love, (living under)  
Safe in the arms of the mighty God,  
Living under your wings of love, (living under)  
Safe in the arms of the mighty God,  
Oh, living under your wings of love.  
  
No more living alone,  
No more fear of the night,  
Forever I will make my home...
