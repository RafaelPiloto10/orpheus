When the sun goes down and it's getting late  
You say it's time for bed  
She just takes her time  
Acting like she never heard a word you said  
Little baby want to hold you tight  
She don't ever want to say good night  
She's a lover, she want to be Daddy's Girl  
When the morning comes  
And it's time to go start another day  
She won't let you leave, and she does her best  
To try to make you stay  
Pretty baby gonna start to cry  
She don't ever want to say good bye  
She's a lover, she want to be Daddy's Girl  
  
She don't ever want to be without you  
Never have to worry she won't doubt you  
Then she puts her head upon your shoulder  
Says she marry you when she get older  
  
When the time has come, and she's old enough  
To be on her own  
She won't understand why you're feelin' sad  
'Cause she's leaving you all alone  
Little woman gonna make you cry  
You don't ever want to say good bye  
She's a lady, she'll always be Daddy's Girl  
  
Little woman gonna break your heart  
Gonna miss her when you're both apart  
She's a lady, but she'll always be Daddy's Girl  
  
She'll always be Daddy's Girl  
She'll always be Daddy's Girl  
She'll always be Daddy's Girl  
She'll always be Daddy's Girl  
She'll always be Daddy's Girl  
She'll always be Daddy's Girl
