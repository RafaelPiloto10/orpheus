[Verse]  
Lost in the mirror  
I knew your face once, but now it's unclear  
And I can't feel my body now  
I'm separate from here and now  
A drug and a drink  
We lost connection, oh come back to me  
So I can feel alive again  
Soul and body try to mend  
  
[Chorus]  
It's pulling me apart, this time  
Everything is never ending  
Slipped into a peril that I'll never understand  
This feeling always gets away  
Wishing I could hold on longer  
It doesn't have to feel so strange  
To be in love again  
To be in love again  
To be in love again  
  
[Verse]  
Lost in the mirror  
I knew your face once, but now it's unclear  
And I can't feel my body now  
I'm separate from here and now  
  
[Chorus]  
It's pulling me apart, this time  
Everything is never ending  
Slipped into a peril that I'll never understand  
This feeling always gets away  
Wishing I could hold on longer  
It doesn't have to feel so strange  
To be in love again  
To be in love again  
To be in love again
