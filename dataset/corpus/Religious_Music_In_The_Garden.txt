[Verse 1:]  
I come to the garden alone,  
While the dew is still on the roses,  
And the voice I hear, falling on my ear,  
The Son of God discloses.  
  
[Chorus:]  
And He walks with me, and He talks with me,  
And He tells me I am His own,  
And the joy we share as we tarry there,  
None other has ever known.  
  
[Verse 2:]  
He speaks, and the sound of His voice,  
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing,  
And the melody that He gave to me,  
Within my heart is ringing.  
  
[Chorus:]  
And He walks with me, and He talks with me,  
And He tells me I am His own,  
And the joy we share as we tarry there,  
None other has ever known.  
  
[Verse 3:]  
I'd stay in the garden with Him,  
Tho' the night around me be falling,  
But He bids me go, thro' the voice of woe,  
His voice to me is calling.  
  
[Chorus:]  
And He walks with me, and He talks with me,  
And He tells me I am His own,  
And the joy we share as we tarry there,  
None other has ever known.
