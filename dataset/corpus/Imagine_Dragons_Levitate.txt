[Verse 1]  
There's so much on my mind  
I don't know where to start  
There's that light in your eye filling up the dark  
Though, I lost myself  
I know it's not the end  
You're my shooting star  
You make my heart ascend  
  
[Chorus]  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
Just levitate, just levitate  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
Just levitate, just levitate  
  
[Verse 2]  
I know that we're far from where we need to be  
But the world wasn't made in just one day  
Though our journey's long, I know our love is strong  
You're my shooting star  
We're flying high above  
  
[Chorus]  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
Just levitate, just levitate  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
Just levitate, just levitate  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
Just levitate, just levitate  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
Just levitate, just levitate  
  
[Bridge]  
When I'm stuck in the middle of hell and faith  
And I don't know where to turn  
To bend my mind as the silver gate  
You lead me on my way  
  
(Oooooo)  
(Oooooo)  
(Oooooo)  
(Oooooo)  
  
[Chorus]  
(Oooooo)  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
Just levitate, just levitate  
(Oooooooo)  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
Just levitate, just levitate  
(Ooooooo)  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
Just levitate, just levitate  
(Ooooooo)  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
Just levitate, just levitate  
(Ooooooo)  
(Ooooooo)  
(Ooooooo)  
  
[Outro]  
Just levitate, just levitate  
(Ooooooo)  
Just levitate, just levitate
