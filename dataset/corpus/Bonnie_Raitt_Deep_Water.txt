There are angels singing low inside my head  
Cool tango blue and samba red  
I want to scratch your name upon my wall  
Cause I'm drowning here beneath love's waterfall  
  
Deep water  
Deep water  
  
Baby you're love's got a hold on me  
You row my boat right out to the sea  
See the woman inside the girl  
Dancing on the roof of the invisible world  
  
We are walking like the waves beside the sea  
There are oceans in my eyes that you can't see  
And my arms reach out for you into the dark  
I feel your skin where my nails left their mark  
  
Deep water  
Deep water  
  
Baby you're love's got a hold on me  
You row my boat right out to the sea  
See the woman inside the girl  
Dancing on the roof of the invisible world  
  
Souls alike  
Hands alike  
  
Baby you're love's got a hold on me  
You row my boat right out to the sea  
See the woman inside the girl  
Dancing on the roof of the invisible world  
  
Baby you're love's got a hold on me  
You row my boat right out to the sea  
See the woman inside the girl  
Dancing on the roof of the invisible world  
  
Souls alike  
Hands alike
