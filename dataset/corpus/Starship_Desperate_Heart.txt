One night, one empty room, one man gettin' over you  
One star, one lonely moon, I make a wish, I know will never come true  
You call my name, and you beg me to hold you again  
But the truth remains, I'm only a fool who can't help but pretend  
  
It's all over but I'm holding on, I can't let go until the love is gone  
It's all over but I keep holding on with a desperate heart  
With my desperate heart  
  
Some nights, I try in my mind, I see myself learning someone new  
Still I know, I'm wasting my time, no one can take the place of you  
So I close my eyes, I swear I feel you here by my side  
But it's all only a lie, I need to believe for my heart to survive  
  
It's all over but I'm holding on, I can't let go until the love is gone  
It's all over but I keep holding on with a desperate heart  
With my desperate heart, I keep holding on  
  
All this time I've been drowning in hopeless illusions I'm keeping inside  
That someday you'll walk out of the shadows and back into my life  
  
It's all over but I'm holding on, I can't believe your love for me is gone  
It's all over but I keep holding on (With a desperate heart)  
Yeah with my desperate heart, I can't let go until the love is gone  
(All over but I'm holding on) I keep holding on  
(All over but I'm holding on) I can't believe your love for me is gone  
(All over but I keep holding on)  
(All over but I'm holding on)  
(All over but I keep holding on)
