A hot and windy August afternoon  
Has the trees in constant motion  
With a flash of silver leaves  
As they're rocking in the breeze  
  
The boy lies in the grass with one blade  
Stuck between his teeth  
A vague sensation quickens  
In his young and restless heart  
And a bright and nameless vision  
Has him longing to depart  
  
You move me  
You move me  
With your buildings and your eyes  
Autumn woods and winter skies  
You move me  
You move me  
Open sea and city lights  
Busy streets and dizzy heights  
You call me  
You call me  
  
The fawn-eyed girl with sun-browned legs  
Dances on the edge of his dream  
And her voice rings in his ears  
Like the music of the spheres  
  
The boy lies in the grass, unmoving  
Staring at the sky  
His mother starts to call him  
As a hawk goes soaring by  
The boy pulls down his baseball cap  
And covers up his eyes  
  
Too many hands on my time  
Too many feelings  
Too many things on my mind  
When I leave I don't know  
What I'm hoping to find  
When I leave I don't know  
What I'm leaving behind...
