Well, it's up in the mornin'  
Everybody off and runnin'  
Everybody got some place to be  
Some people never go walkin'  
Some people just stop talkin'  
And I was slippin' away  
You came and pulled me through  
I want to stay in the land of the living with you  
  
I want to stay in the land of the living  
I want to stay here with you  
I want to stay in the land of the living  
I want to stay here with you  
  
We work and we worry  
This old world's in such a hurry  
So many things we just don't see  
Some people always cryin'  
Some people just stop tryin'  
And I was slippin' away  
You came and pulled me though  
I want to stay in the land of the living with you  
  
We got to do what we can about all this pain and sorrow  
But try to live just a little  
We could all be gone tomorrow  
When I look at you girl, my heart rejoices  
You taught me somethin':  
Considering the choices  
  
I want to stay in the land of the living  
I want to stay here with you  
I want to stay in the land of the living  
I want to stay here with you
