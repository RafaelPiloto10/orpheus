Some girls do some girls don't  
Don't mean type don't mean smoke  
Lay me down can't seem to sleep  
My mind's been thinkin' real deep  
(bridge 1)  
All my thoughts are runnin wild out of control-outta my mind  
[Chorus:]  
'cause good girls go to heaven bad girls go everywhere  
If I had my choice of women  
I'd pick the ones that'd go anywhere  
All good girls they go to heaven  
All bad girls go everywhere they like  
Late at night when she comes out  
The lady moves prowls the town  
A perfect match of looks and charm  
Where she goes it's light and dark  
She's so hot I burn my tongue when I kiss her lips she turns me on  
Good girls go to heaven  
Bad girls go everywhere  
If I had my choice of women  
I'd pick the ones that'd go anywhere  
All good girls they go to heaven  
All bad girls go everywhere they like  
(solo)  
Made my choice made it well had my pick of heaven or  
Good girls go to heaven bad girls go everywhere  
If I had my choice of women I'd pick the ones that'd go anywhere  
All good girls they go to heaven all bad girls go everywhere they like  
Good girls they've got manners bad girls got what matters  
Good girls leave at home bad girls come with the singer  
Good girls go to heaven bad girls go everywhere that they like
