I was alone and fancy free  
Enjoying all my liberty  
  
I met you, baby  
Then things changed  
I started acting  
Oh, so strange  
  
Do I like it, do I like it  
Yes, I do  
  
Well, every day I had a ball  
I didn't have a care at all  
And everything was just okay  
Until you made me change my way  
  
Do I like it, do I like it  
Yes, I do  
  
Like a schoolboy  
Loves his cherry pie  
You really move me  
My, oh, my  
  
You caught me, baby  
I'm really hooked  
No doubt about it  
My goose is cooked  
  
It won't be long before I hear  
Her whisper softly in my ear  
I love you, baby, yes, I do  
And from now on  
It's me and you  
  
Do I like it, do I like it  
Yes, I do  
  
Like a schoolboy  
Loves his cherry pie  
You really move me  
My, oh, my  
  
You caught me, baby  
I'm really hooked  
No doubt about it  
My goose is cooked  
  
It won't be long before I hear  
Her whisper softly in my ear  
I love you, baby, yes, I do  
And from now on  
It's me and you  
  
Do I like it, do I like it  
Yes, I do
