There are men high up there fishing,  
Haven't seen quite enough of the world,  
I ain't seen a sign of my heroes,  
And I'm still diving down for pearls.  
  
Let me flow into the ocean,  
Let me get back to the sea.  
Let me be stormy and let me be calm,  
Let the tide in, and set me free.  
  
I'm flowing under bridges,  
Then flying through the sky,  
I'm travelling down cold metal  
Just a tear in baby's eye.  
  
Let me flow into the ocean  
Let me get back to the sea  
Let me be stormy and let me be calm  
Let the tide in, come set me free.  
  
I am not the actor  
This can't be the scene  
But I am in the water,  
As far as I can see  
  
I'm remembering distant memories  
Recalling other names.  
Rippling over canyons,  
And boiling in the train.  
  
Let me  
  
I wanna drown  
In cold water
