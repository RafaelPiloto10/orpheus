I heard, that you're settled down  
That you found a girl and you're, married now  
  
I heard, that your dreams came true  
I guess she gave you things  
I didn't give to you  
  
Old friend, why are you so shy  
Ain't like you to hold back  
Or hide from the light  
  
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I  
Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it  
I had hoped you'd see my face  
And that you be reminded that for me it isn't over  
  
Never mind I'll find someone like you  
I wish nothing but the best  
For you too, don't forget me  
I beg, I'll remember you say  
Sometimes it lasts in love  
But sometimes it hurts instead  
Sometimes it lasts in love  
But sometimes it hurts instead yeah  
  
You know how the time flies  
Only yesterday it was the time of our lives  
We were born and raised  
In a summer haze bound by the surprise  
Of our glory days  
  
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I  
Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it  
I hoped you'd see my face  
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over  
  
Never mind I'll find someone like you  
I wish nothing but the best for you too  
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you say  
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead  
  
Nothing compares no worries or cares  
Regrets and mistakes their memories made  
Who would have known how bittersweet  
This would taste  
  
Never mind I'll find someone like you  
I wish nothing but the best for you  
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you say  
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead  
  
Never mind I'll find someone like you  
I wish nothing but the best for you too  
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you say  
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead  
  
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead
