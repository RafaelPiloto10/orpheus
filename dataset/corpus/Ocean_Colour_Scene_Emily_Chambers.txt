Emily Chambers would make it pay  
Everyone knew she'd turn out that way  
She turned her back and she'll be okay  
But she's not okay at all  
  
Every night with the radio on  
Emily fears that the day won't come  
The moon is there to do her harm  
She's not all right at all  
  
Don't get arrested  
Don't buy a machine gun  
You're not on the run  
And you're not on the scene  
You're not so cool  
And you're not a jerk  
You may be a villain  
But no Patty Hearst  
You're Emily Chambers  
And what's worse  
Is a whipping wind  
And a box in a hearse  
And a trigger in your head  
And a pen in your hand  
And the pain in the verse  
And the flat drying land  
And the thin of the air  
And a pain that hurts  
You're Emily Chambers in the universe  
  
Emily Chambers would make it pay  
Everyone knew she'd turn out that way  
She turned her back and she'll be okay  
But she's not okay at all  
  
Every night with the lamplight on  
Emily fears that the day has gone  
The moon is there to do her harm  
She's not all right at all  
  
Don't get arrested  
Don't buy a machine gun  
You're not on the run  
And you're not on the scene  
You're not so cool  
And you're not a jerk  
You may be a villain  
But no Patty Hearst  
You're Emily Chambers  
And what's worse  
Is a whipping wind  
And a box in a hearse  
And a trigger in your head  
And a pen in your hand  
And the pain in the verse  
And the flat drying land  
And the thin of the air  
And a pain that hurts  
You're Emily Chambers in the universe  
  
Emily Chambers would make it pay  
Everyone knew she'd turn out that way  
  
Emily Chambers would make it pay  
Everyone knew she'd turn out that way
