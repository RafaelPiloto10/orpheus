I know that you're with him just now as I write  
I know you need someone to hold you at night  
But I'm begging you, baby  
Please don't fall in love  
I knew it might happen when I was away  
And now that it's happened, I just want to say  
That I'm begging you, baby  
Please don't fall in love  
I'm usually strong but I'm feeling so weak  
It wells up inside me, I cry when I speak  
But the more I call you on the phone  
The more I feel alone  
And the less we have to say  
I know that you're with him just now as I write  
I know you need someone to hold you at night  
But I'm begging you, baby  
Please don't fall in love  
I knew it might happen when I was away  
And now that it's happened, I just want to say  
That I'm begging you, baby  
Please don't fall in love  
We kissed at the airport, we said we could wait  
I believe it is we who determine our fate  
And I love you more than I can say  
Don't throw it all away  
Don't let it go by  
I know that you're with him just now as I write  
I know you need someone to hold you at night  
But I'm begging you, baby  
Please don't fall in love  
I know you don't tell me, to spare me the pain  
Don't want you to tell me, I don't need his name  
That I'm begging you, baby  
Please don't fall in love
