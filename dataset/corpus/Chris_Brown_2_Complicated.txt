Shared glasses and cigarettes  
There's a lock... up inside of me  
And I have so many regrets  
This isn't how things used to be  
And... neevr satisfied  
Guess what I stop fucking tryin  
Guess up and guess you didn't know your...  
  
But it's always you  
I'm always wrong anything like you  
And I always got awar with you  
And I lose yeah yeah  
I'm a sell it dude gotta keep coming back to you  
'Cause it's feeling like deja-vu  
My head spinnin around and got me sayin  
  
Chorus:  
I I I  
Your way 2 complicated  
I I I I I can't no longer take it  
I I I I we're no good let 's just base it  
I I I I 'cause your way 2 complicated  
  
Here such a snobby girl  
  
Used to think you were a queen  
Damn shawty did rain on my parade  
Same old silly games you play  
This is such a waste of time  
I'm starting to think that you're insane
