Tempted and tried we're oft made to wonder why it should be thus all the day
long  
While there are others living about us never molested though in the wrong  
Farther along we'll know all about it farther along we'll understand why  
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine we'll understand it all by and by  
  
When we see Jesus coming in glory when he comes from his home in the sky  
Then we shall meet him in that bright mansion we'll understand it all by and
by  
Farther along
