I've seen it all, I have seen the trees,  
I've seen the willow leaves dancing in the breeze  
I've seen a friend killed by a friend,  
And lives that were over before they were spent.  
I've seen what I was - I know what I'll be  
I've seen it all - there is no more to see!  
You haven't seen elephants, kings or Peru!  
I'm happy to say I had better to do  
What about China? Have you seen the Great Wall?  
All walls are great, if the roof doesn't fall!  
  
And the man you will marry?  
The home you will share?  
To be honest, I really don't care...  
  
You've never been to Niagara Falls?  
I have seen water, its water, that's all...  
The Eiffel Tower, the Empire State?  
My pulse was as high on my very first date!  
Your grandson's hand as he plays with your hair?  
To be honest, I really don't care...  
  
I've seen it all, I've seen the dark  
I've seen the brightness in one little spark.  
I've seen what I chose and I've seen what I need,  
And that is enough, to want more would be greed.  
I've seen what I was and I know what I'll be  
I've seen it all - there is no more to see!  
  
You've seen it all and all you have seen  
You can always review on your own little screen  
The light and the dark, the big and the small  
Just keep in mind - you need no more at all  
You've seen what you were and know what you'll be  
You've seen it all - there is no more to see!
