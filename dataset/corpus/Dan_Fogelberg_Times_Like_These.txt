Tell me a secret  
Tell me a lie  
Tell me the truth if you have to  
Say what you see fit  
But don't ask me why  
Love never seems to last you  
  
In times like these  
It's hard to keep a man off his knees  
In times like these  
It's hard to keep a man off his knees  
  
Over a barrel  
Under a spell  
Money's the demon that drives you  
Limping through heaven  
Or running through hell  
Happiness smiles but denies you  
  
In times like these  
It's hard to keep a man off his knees  
In times like these  
It's hard to keep a man off his knees  
  
Nothing before you  
Nothing behind  
Thoughtlessly chasing the thunder  
Travelling lightly  
Travelling blind  
Never detouring to wonder why  
  
Tell me a secret  
Tell me a lie  
Tell me the truth if you have to  
Say what you see fit  
But don't ask me why  
Love never seems to last you  
  
In times like these  
It's hard to keep a man off his knees  
In times like these  
It's hard to keep a man off his knees  
  
Nothing before you  
Nothing behind  
Thoughtlessly chasing the thunder  
Travelling lightly  
Travelling blind  
Never detouring to wonder why
