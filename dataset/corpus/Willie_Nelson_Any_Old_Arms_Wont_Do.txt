I'd like to rush into somebody's arms  
And lose myself inside  
But just any arms won't do  
They must belong to you  
I'd like to know the soothing comfort  
Of a love that never dies  
But just any old love won't do  
That love must come from you  
I've tried so hard to find someone to love  
Since I lost you,  
But they only make me realize  
How much that I need you  
I'd like to know when I grow older  
Someone's heart will still be true  
But just any old heart won't do  
It must belong to you
