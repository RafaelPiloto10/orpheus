This is the time of year, that we learn to give  
And the greatest gift is learning to forgive.  
We will have the best time we ever knew  
If you forgive me and I forgive you  
  
(chorus)  
I don't want to light a fire  
Unless it will warm your heart  
I'm playin no holiday songs  
I need you to sing your part  
And baby if I could have just one wish come true  
I don't want to spend one more Christmas without you  
  
It's so hard to believe  
We're staring at the end  
When all we think about is  
Starting up again  
Whatever we lost, when we were apart  
We'll find it all alone in the dark  
  
(chorus)  
I don't want to light a fire  
Unless it will warm your heart  
I'm playin no holiday songs  
I need you to sing your part  
And baby if I could have just one wish come true  
I don't want to spend one more Christmas without you  
  
There nothing more than I want from you  
Then to lie here together  
And stay here forever with you  
There's no one I ever knew  
That I wanted to spend Christmas with, more than you......  
  
(chorus)  
I don't want to light a fire  
Unless it will warm your heart  
I'm playin no holiday songs  
I need you to sing your part  
And baby if I could have just one wish come true  
I don't want to spend one more Christmas without you  
  
(chorus)  
I don't want to light a fire  
Unless it will warm your heart  
I'm playin no holiday songs  
I need you to sing your part  
And baby if I could have just one wish come true  
I don't want to spend one more Christmas  
I don't want to spend one more Christmas  
I don't want to spend one more Christmas without you
