I was standing in the moonlight  
With my heart in my hands  
Life had taken me full circle  
And I was meant to love again  
Playing all or nothing  
I'd given up on love, yeah  
Just when I thought  
I'd never fall in love again  
The bough of my heart opened  
And you walked in  
With those......  
Chorus:  
Forever eyes, looking right at me  
Now I find myself believing  
Love will always be  
In your forever eyes  
Never say good-bye  
'cause I only want to lose myself  
In your forever eyes  
  
There were times you'd see right through me  
I'm a child in your hands  
But the moment that you touch me  
You set fire to this man  
Burning inspiration  
That's what I feel right now  
Waves of emotion carry me along  
Your love is like a river  
Going on and on  
In your....  
  
Chorus:  
  
Forever eyes  
  
Chorus:
