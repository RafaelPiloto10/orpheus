Suburbia, where the suburbs met Utopia  
(Where the suburbs met Utopia)  
  
Lost in the high street, where the dogs run  
Roaming suburban boys  
Mother's got a hairdo to be done  
She says they're too old for toys  
Stood by the bus stop with a felt pen  
In this suburban hell  
And in the distance a police car  
To break the suburban spell  
  
Let's take a ride, and run with the dogs tonight  
In Suburbia  
You can't hide, run with the dogs tonight  
In Suburbia  
  
Break a window by the town hall  
Listen, the siren screams  
There in the distance, like a roll call  
Of all the suburban dreams  
  
Let's take a ride, and run with the dogs tonight  
In Suburbia  
You can't hide, run with the dogs tonight  
In Suburbia  
  
I only wanted something else to do but hang around  
I only wanted something else to do but hang around  
(Hang around, hang around)  
  
It's on the front page of the papers  
This is their hour of need  
Where's a policeman when you need one  
To blame the colour TV?  
  
Let's take a ride, and run with the dogs tonight  
In Suburbia  
You can't hide, run with the dogs tonight  
In Suburbia  
In Suburbia  
In Suburbia  
  
Run with the dogs tonight  
You can't hide  
Run with the dogs tonight  
You can't hide  
(You can't hide, you can't hide)  
In Suburbia  
  
(Suburbia, where the suburbs met Utopia)  
(What kind of dream was this, so easy to destroy?)  
(A world together, the cities of the past)  
(Mews, slums of the future)
