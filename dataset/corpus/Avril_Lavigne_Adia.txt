Adia I do believe I failed you  
Adia I know I let you down  
Don't you know I tried so hard  
To love you in my way  
It's easy let it go...  
Adia I'm empty since you left me  
Trying to find a way to carry on  
I search myself and everyone  
To see where we went wrong  
'cause there's no one left to finger  
There's no one here to blame  
There's no one left to talk to, honey  
And there ain't no one to buy our innocence  
'cause we are born innocent  
Believe me adia, we are still innocent  
It's easy, we all falter  
Does it matter?  
Adia I thought that we could make it  
But I know I can't change the way you feel  
I leave you with your misery  
A friend who won't betray  
I pull you from your tower  
I take away your pain  
And show you all the beauty you possess  
If you'd only let yourself believe that  
We are born innocent  
Believe me adia, we are still innocent  
It's easy, we all falter, does it matter?  
Believe me adia, we are still innocent  
'cause we are born innocent  
Adia we are still innocent  
It's easy, we all falter... But does it matter?
