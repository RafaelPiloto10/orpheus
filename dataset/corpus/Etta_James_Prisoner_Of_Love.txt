Someone that I belong to  
Doesn't belong to me  
Someone who can't be faithful  
Knows that I have to be  
Wonder if I am wrong to give her my loyalty  
  
Why should I be a lone soul  
Why can't I be my own soul  
Alone from night to night you'll find me  
Too weak to break the chains that bind me  
I need no shackles to remind me  
I'm just a prisner of love  
For one comand I stand and wait now  
  
From one who's master of my Fate now  
I can't escape for it's too late now  
I'm just a prisoner of love  
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing  
Those arms with me  
Although she has another  
I can't have another  
For I'm not free  
She's in my dreams awake or sleeping  
Up on my knees to her I'm creeping  
My very life is in her keeping  
I'm just a prisoner of love.  
Love.
