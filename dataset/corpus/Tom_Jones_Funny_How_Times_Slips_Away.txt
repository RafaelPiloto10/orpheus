Well hello there  
My it's been a long long time  
How am I doin'  
Well I guess I'm doin' fine  
It's been so long now and it seems that  
It was only yesterday  
Yeah, ain't it funny how time slips away  
How's your new love  
I hope that he's doin' fine  
I heard you told him  
That you'd love him till the end of time  
Well you know, that's the same thing  
That you told me  
Seems like just the other day  
Yeah, ain't it funny how time slips away  
I gotta go now  
Guess I?ll see you hanging 'round  
Don't know when though  
Never know when I?ll be back in town  
But I remember what I told you  
That in time, it's going to be okay  
Yeah, ain't it funny how time slips away  
Yeah, ain't it funny' how time slips right on, slips right on  
Away, away, away
