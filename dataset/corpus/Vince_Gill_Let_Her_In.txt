I didn't know how love would come around  
Walked right up to me and knocked me down  
I dropped straight down on my knees  
Asked my little girl, honey won't you help me please  
  
[Chorus:]  
Let her in  
Let my heart feel love again  
Let her in  
Don't you know how long it's been  
Let her in  
Let come and be my friend  
Baby please won't you let her in  
  
I know it's hard for you since your mama's been gone  
It must be strange to see me carry on  
Honey just try to understand  
It takes to the love of a woman to complete the heart of a man  
  
[Chorus x3]  
Let her in  
Let my heart feel love again  
Let her in  
Don't you know how long it's been  
Let her in  
Let come and be my friend  
Baby please won't you let her in
