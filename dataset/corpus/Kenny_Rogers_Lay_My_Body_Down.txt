Woman you're the closest thing  
I know, to peace on earth  
You warm to what feels cold in me  
And healing to what hurts.  
  
Woman can you tell me why  
I'm driven as I am  
Is there something that I have  
That makes you give a damn.  
  
Be my comfort when the world  
Waves me to the ground  
Take me when I've lost my way  
Let me know I'm found.  
  
Be a blanket to my soul  
Wrap it all around  
Be a feather babe to me  
And lay my body down.  
  
Touch me with your finger tips  
Give my burdens rest  
Tell me not to worry so  
I know that you know best.  
  
Lady take my candle stance  
And hold them in your arm  
Lie against me in the dark  
And show me I've come home.  
  
Be my comfort?.
