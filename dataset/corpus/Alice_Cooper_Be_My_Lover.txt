She struts into the room  
Well I don't know her  
But with a magnifying glance  
I just sorta look her over  
  
We have a drink or two, well maybe three  
And then suddenly, she starts telling me her life story  
  
She says  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby, if you want to, be my lover  
You better take me home  
Cause it's a long long way to paradise  
And I'm still on my own.  
  
Told her that I came from Detroit City  
And I played guitar in a long haired rock and roll band  
She asked me why the singer's name was Alice  
I said 'listen baby, you really wouldn't understand'  
  
And I said  
  
[Chorus]  
  
On my own,  
  
Oh, baby, if you want to, be my lover  
You better take me home,  
Cause it's a long, long way, to paradise,  
And I'm still on my own, own
