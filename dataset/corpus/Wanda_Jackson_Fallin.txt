I got the feelin' I'm fallin' like a star up in the blue  
Like I was fallin' off Niagra in a paddle boat canoe  
I got the feelin' I'm a fallin' and it's all because of you  
Like I was walkin' on a tight rope ooh swingin' in the breeze  
And though I tried to keep my balance when I just weaken in the knees  
I got to feelin' I'm a fallin' oh lover help me please  
Like a leaf falls from the branch like a rock slide avalanche  
Like the rain on a stormy day I never thought I'd fall this way  
I thought that love could never touch me yeah I was ridin' high  
But then my ivory tower toppled and it tumbled from the sky  
I got to feelin' I'm fallin' lover you're the reason why  
  
Like Goliath when he met his foe like the walls of Jericho  
Like Delilah's home in town when samson tore it down  
I thought that love could never touch me yeah I was ridin' high  
But then my ivory tower toppled and it tumbled from the sky  
I got to feelin' I'm fallin' lover you're the reason why  
Oooh you're the reason why
