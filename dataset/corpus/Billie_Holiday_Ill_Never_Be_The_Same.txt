I'll never be the same  
Guys have lost their meaning for me  
I'll never be the same  
Nothing's what it once used to be  
And when the song birds that sing  
Tell me it's spring, I can't believe their song  
Once love was king but kings can be wrong  
I'll never be the same  
There is such an ache in my heart  
I'll never be the same since we're apart  
But there's a lot that a smile can hide  
And I know deep down inside  
I'll never be the same, never be the same again
