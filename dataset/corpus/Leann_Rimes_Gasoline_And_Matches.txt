Baby, baby, baby, baby, listen what I say  
Baby, baby, baby, baby, let me have my way  
I'm gonna keep on knockin' till the door unlatches  
You and me are gasoline and matches  
  
Baby, baby, baby, baby, when it's cold and dark  
Baby, baby, baby, baby, you make me feel a spark  
Well I feel a spark and the fire catches  
You and me are gasoline and matches  
  
You pull my pin and you trip my wire  
Yeah well you come in and set my heart on fire  
You knock me out, you rock me off my axis  
You and me are gasoline and matches  
  
Baby, baby, baby, baby, when you make your move  
Baby, baby, baby, baby, I can feel your groove  
The resistance of a strong willed man's in ashes  
You and me are gasoline and matches  
  
Oh you pull my pin and you trip my wire  
Yeah well you come in and set my heart on fire  
You knock me out, you rock me off my axis  
You and me You and me  
  
Baby I'm incarcerated and I don't want out  
Baby we should get related  
'cause there ain't no doubt  
Yeah but when your heart and my heart attaches  
You and me are Gasoline and Matches  
You and me are Gasoline and Matches  
You and me, yeah  
  
Well you pull my pin and then you trip my wire  
You come on in you come on in  
And set my heart on fire  
You knock me out, knock me out  
Knock me off of my axis  
You and me, you and me we're  
Gasoline and matches  
Gonna knock knock knock knock  
Until the door unlatches  
You and me are gasoline and matches
