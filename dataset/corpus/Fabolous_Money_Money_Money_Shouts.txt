[Red Cafe]Hey hey, everydayday I hustle everyday I'm getting money  
If her p-ssy good everyday I'm spending money  
Throw it in the bag, throw it in the bag

And I murder everybody okay everyday say it

[Diddy]  
Wake up in the morning  
Take a money shower  
Now I'm smelling like money got the money and the power  
Bad boy money, Martin and Will  
My face good money the should put me on the bill  
I pioneered the jets and the yachts and the shoppers  
Crushing model chicks, throwing minks on the toddlers  
Nasdaq money, Dow Jones homes  
Money money money muthaf-cker daddy's home  
Cash money young money bad boy money  
Shorty said I boss never throw toy money  
So blah blah make that thing bounce with these hundred dollar bills  
Now I'm getting money I ball  
I remember I had no money at all  
Now I'm so shallow name brand apparel  
I'm in that new new everyday wanna battle  
  
Blaacka blaacka blaacka  
Money money money  
Any given day I'm pouring honey on your honey  
And I murder everybody okay everyday say it  
Money money money  
If you broke I'm sorry  
  
[Chorus:]  
[Fabolous]Clap for that money like the booty on shorty then  
Ya'll just keep clapping studio audience  
Told her stretch it out like she do it in the  
And bust it bust it bust it like she snuck a glock 40 in  
Daddy gon show you how a store feel  
I got millions of ways young  
Married to the money  
Faithful to the millions  
Got my money up  
Safe as up in ceilings  
[End]
