One day break, one heart ache, every once upon a time  
That black dress, happiness, bubble baths and quarter lines  
They mean so much to everyone,  
But you count them up one by one  
  
Clear midnights, and this firelight, once thinking that your dad was ten feet
tall  
A blue bonnet with rain on it, quiet winters and leaves that always fall  
Your black boots, my red flower ring  
Live for the little things  
  
Oil paintings and making every detail turn out right  
One last dance, new romance, living for that love at first sight  
It means so much to everyone  
But you count them up one by one  
  
Clear midnights, and this firelight, once thinking that your dad was ten feet
tall  
A blue bonnet with rain on it, quiet winters and leaves that always fall  
Your black boots, my red flower ring  
Live for the little things  
  
No fighting, black writing, wish upon a star and give the moon a smile  
Pretending, defending, take a risk and go along for the ride  
Strawberries and fairies with wings  
Live for the little things,  
Na na na, na na na, na na na na, uh yeah  
Na na na, na na na, na na na na, oh yeah.
