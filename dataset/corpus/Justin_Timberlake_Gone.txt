There's a thousand words that  
I could say, to make you come home, yeah  
Seems so long ago you walked away  
Left me alone  
And I remeber what you said to me,  
You were acting so strange  
And maybe I was too blind to see  
That you needed a change  
  
Was it something I said to make you turn away  
To make you walk out and leave me cold  
If I could just find a way  
To make it so that you were right here, right now  
  
I've been sitting here  
Can't get you off my mind  
I'm trying my best to be a man and be strong  
I drove myself insane, wishing I could touch your face  
But the truth remains, you're Gone  
  
Now I don't wanna make excuses, baby  
Won't change the fact that you're gone  
But if there's something that I could do, won't you please let me know  
Time is passing so slowly now, guess that's my life without you  
And maybe I could change my everyday, but baby I don't want to  
  
So I'll just hang around and find some things to do  
To take my mind off missing you  
And I know in my heart, you can't say that you don't love me too  
Please say you do, yeah  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
What will I do if I can't be with you  
Tell me where will I turn to, baby who will I be  
Now that we are apart, am I still in your heart?  
Baby why don't you see that I need you here with me?  
  
[Chorus:]
