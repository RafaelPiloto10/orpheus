Heading for the classroom yesterday  
The kids file through the metal machine  
It finds what they may hide  
No it just ain't right  
A sign of the times  
  
Another church is burning to the ground  
Looking for the vandals and they're nowhere to be found  
But the hate's alive  
A sign of the times, Sign of the times  
A sign of the times, Sign of the times  
  
Would someone please let me know how we have spun out of control?  
Has the captain let go of the wheel?  
Or could we please try to find a way to be a bit more kind?  
I see the road to tomorrow in the haze!  
  
On the Senate floor they congregate  
Many pockets lined with green,  
From those behind the scenes, yeah they take the bribe (it's on the side)  
A sign of the times, Sign of the times  
A sign of the times, Sign of the times
