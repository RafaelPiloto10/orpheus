What can you tell me, of the perfect man.  
What can you tell me, now I don't quite understand.  
We lose our grip, we glide and stall.  
Some things come easy, some don't come at all.  
We chip away at the perfect man.  
What can you show me, now I don't quite understand.  
Eye to eye nothing left to say  
But will you really throw it all away.  
We trip, we stumble, and we all fall down.  
Things go wrong, though are strong.  
We slip, we fumble, and we all fall down  
Round and round, we all fall down.  
Sometime....  
No matter how we try to keep things straight.  
It makes no difference, while we cause our fate.  
We burn our candle unaware.  
While on our knees we cry in prayer.  
We trip, we stumble, and we all fall down.  
Pain won't last, this too shall pass.  
We slip, we fumble, and we all fall down  
Round and round, time and time, again.  
But ahhhh,  
If it's so simple then explain to me.  
How pain is so close to ecstasy.  
How change can make you feel so free.  
Ahhhh,  
If we were meant to be such perfect fools.  
Then why do we always break the rules,  
Crashing through life's scenery.  
We trip, we stumble, and we all fall down.  
Angry cries and desperate lies.  
We slip, we fumble, and we all fall down  
Hearts to mend, sun comes up again.
