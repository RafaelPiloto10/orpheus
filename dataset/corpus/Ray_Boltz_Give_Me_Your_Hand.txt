Give Me Your Hand  
Words and music by Ray Boltz  
I was climbing up a mountain  
Headed for the top  
My feet started sliding  
And I almost fell off  
I landed on a rocky ledge  
Suspended in the air  
And I cried out in despair  
I said, Is anybody out there?  
Anybody there at all?  
Then I saw Him reaching down  
And I heard Him call,  
chorus:  
Give me your hand, I'll lift you up  
Don't be afraid  
You just have to trust  
I have been there in the place you stand  
There's no need to fear  
That's why I'm here  
Give me your hand  
How can I repay you?  
You truly saved my life  
The Savior smiled  
And He said, That's alright  
Tomorrow when you're climbing  
Look around you on the way  
There are many others to be saved...  
Crying, Is anybody out there?  
Anybody there at all?  
Reach out to them, remember me, and call,  
chorus (repeat)  
There's no need to fear  
That's why I'm here  
Give me your hand  
There's no need to fear  
That's why I'm here  
Give me your hand
