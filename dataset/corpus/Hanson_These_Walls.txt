These walls, too hard to climb  
And that ladder is too hard to find  
I don't want to be here anymore  
  
These roads, too hard to walk  
With the things you've been saying  
I don't even want to talk  
I don't want to wind up on the floor  
I don't want to be here anymore  
  
Fair amount of disbelief  
These walls are killing me  
I don't want to be here anymore  
  
Speak your mind or speak your peace  
I swear we're sinking deep  
I don't want to wind up on the floor  
I don't want to be here anymore  
  
The sky is falling all over again  
Just another dis-conclusion  
Another disillusion  
The sky is falling all over again  
Am I losing my composure?  
Way too much exposure to compromise  
I can't take on these walls  
  
You've been yelling up into the red  
But you haven't heard a word I've said  
I don't want to be here anymore  
  
"Give it all I've got" can be bittersweet  
You think everyone's beneath your feet  
I don't want to wind up on the floor  
I don't want to be here anymore  
  
The sky is falling all over again  
Just another dis-conclusion  
Another disillusion  
The sky is falling all over again  
Am I losing my composure?  
Way too much exposure to compromise  
I can't take on these walls  
  
They're too hard to climb  
These walls  
I can't take on these walls  
I can't take on these walls
