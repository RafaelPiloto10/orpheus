If I were to die this mornin'  
Would you tell me things that you wouldn't have?  
Would you be my navigator?  
Would you take me to a place we could hide?  
  
As I'm fallin' out  
I wonder what I lost  
Must be movin' on  
Know I'll be waitin' here alone  
  
I want to ask you to forgive me  
I haven't been the best with all that I had  
Wish I'd only laid beside you  
I think I spread myself a little too thin  
  
As I'm fadin' out  
I don't feel anything at all  
Think I'm movin' on  
Know you'll be safe but not alone  
  
You're the everything  
That led me to believe,  
"Hold on, hold on"  
You're the wonder in everything  
That's wonderful
