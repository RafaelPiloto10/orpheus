I'm a million miles from anywhere, where can I be  
Somewhere out on the ocean  
Just take a look out on the horizon, what can you see  
There's nothing there for me  
  
I feel shipwrecked, I might as well be shipwrecked  
I'm helpless and alone drifting out to sea  
I can't believe what you said to me  
  
Even standing on the corner of a busy city street  
I still feel so lonely  
Why do you say you want to be with me  
But the next day say you don't  
  
I'm shipwrecked, I might as well be shipwrecked  
I'm helpless and alone drifting out to sea  
I can't believe what you said to me  
Without you I feel shipwrecked  
But I can't let it show  
A million miles away from anywhere, ooh, ooh, ohh  
  
Is it my imagination  
Or is it getting darker, are the waves getting higher  
I'm a million miles from anywhere  
A million miles from anything I know  
  
You know that's why I'm shipwrecked  
I might as well be shipwrecked  
I'm helpless and alone drifting out to sea  
I can't believe what you said to me  
You know that's why I'm shipwrecked, shipwrecked  
Losing my direction  
Please come and rescue me (shipwrecked)  
Shipwrecked  
Shipwrecked  
Shipwrecked  
Shipwrecked
