Break a man, break a promise  
Break a heart, break a home  
Take a long hard look at a heaven  
Gone to hell under the gun  
See the child, young and hungry  
Growing wild, on the run  
And he'll die reaching for freedom  
He was born under the gun  
Swollen men, blind with power  
Break the rules, one by one  
With their lies raising the danger  
Of their games under the gun.  
No more time, no more chances  
No more wars will be won  
In the end only the losers  
Hold the land under the gun  
Hold the truth like a candle  
Let it shine like the sun  
On the love that's left to believe in  
In a world under the gun.
