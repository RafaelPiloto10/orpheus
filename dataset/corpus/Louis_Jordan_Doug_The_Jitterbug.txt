Doug the jitterbug,  
Just a silly lug,  
Young and wild with lots of style,  
That's Doug the jitterbug!  
  
Just a crazy mug,  
Drinks liquor by the jug,  
He's alive with lots of jive,  
Doug the jitterbug!  
  
They threw him out of school  
'Cause all he learned was Tiger Rag,  
He never knew the golden rule,  
But boy, how he can shag!  
  
Doug the jitterbug,  
Cuts a wicked rug,  
It ain't no shame, he's not to blame,  
He's Doug the jitterbug!  
  
He studied to be a lawyer,  
But he never got a case,  
Every time they'd look for that cat in court  
He'd be doing the pantywaist!  
  
Let's talk about Doug the jitterbug,  
Cuts a wicked rug,  
It ain't no shame, he's not to blame,  
He's Doug the jitterbug!
