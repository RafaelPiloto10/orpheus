After you've gone and left me crying  
After you've gone, there's no denying  
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad  
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had  
  
There'll come a time, now don't forget it  
There'll come a time, when you'll regret it  
Some day when you'll grow lonely  
Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only  
After you've gone, after you've gone away  
  
After I'm gone, after we break up  
After I'm gone, you're gonna wake up  
You will find you were blind  
To let somebody come and change your mind  
  
After the years we've been together  
Thought joy and tears, all kinds of weather  
Someday blue and downhearted  
You'll long to be with me right back where you started  
After I'm gone, after I'm gone away  
  
You will find you were blind  
To let somebody come and change your mind  
  
Someday blue and downhearted  
You'll long to be with me right back where you started  
After I'm gone, after I'm gone away  
  
You'll feel blue and you'll feel sad  
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had  
  
Someday when you'll grown lonely  
Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only  
After you've gone, after you've gone away  
  
You made and blue  
But now I'm through with you  
And there's nothing more you can say  
So jack be on your way, miss Ella?s okay
