You think you're on top of the world  
But you know it's really over  
Runnin' 'round with diamond rings  
And coke spoons that are overflowin'  
(Rock 'n' roll is dead)  
  
But all the money in the world  
Can't buy you from the place you're going to  
  
Rock 'n' roll is dead  
Rock 'n' roll is dead  
Rock 'n' roll is dead  
  
You can't even sing or play an instrument  
So you just scream instead  
You're living for an image  
So you got five hundred women in your bed  
(Rock 'n' roll is dead)  
  
But it's real hard to be yourself  
When you're living with those demons in your head  
  
Rock 'n' roll is dead  
Rock 'n' roll is dead  
Rock 'n' roll is dead  
  
Rock 'n' roll is dead  
Rock 'n' roll is dead  
Rock 'n' roll is dead  
Rock 'n' roll is dead  
  
Rock 'n' roll is dead  
Rock 'n' roll is dead  
Rock 'n' roll is dead
