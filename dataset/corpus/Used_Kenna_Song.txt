Kenna song  
Shine a light on what we think  
Kenna song  
Move the people to their feet  
Kenna song  
Leave us brave enough to fight  
Kenna song  
Give us strength to do what's right  
  
We have the right to let our voices be heard  
  
Hear us now, hear us screaming out  
Feel it breaking down, bet you can hear us now  
No more secrets, no more fear  
Can you hear us now? Bet you can hear us now  
  
Sing a song  
Change a world that doesn't care  
Sing a song  
Stop the only ones who dare  
Sing a song  
See the ones who need it more  
Sing a song  
Bring the soldiers back from war  
We have the right to let our voices be heard  
  
Hear us now, hear us screaming out  
Feel it breaking down, bet you can hear us now  
No more secrets, no more fear  
Can you hear us now? Bet you can hear us now  
  
We stand together set in stone, hearts open wide  
And leave them no place left to hide  
It's not a bridge, it's their ideas we must burn  
You had your chance now it's our turn  
  
Hear us now, hear us screaming out  
Feel it breaking down, bet you can hear us now  
No more secrets, no more fear  
Can you hear us now? Bet you can hear us now  
  
Hear us now, hear us screaming out  
Feel it breaking down, bet you can hear us now  
No more secrets, no more fear  
Can you hear us now? Bet you can hear us now
