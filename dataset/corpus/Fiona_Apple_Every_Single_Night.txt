Every single night  
I endure the flight  
Of little wings of white flame  
Butterflies in my brain  
These ideas of mine  
Percolate the mind  
Trickle down my spine  
Swarm the belly, swelling to a blaze  
That's where the pain comes in  
Like a second skeleton  
Trying to fit beneath the skin  
I can't fit the feelings in, no  
Every single night's alright with my brain  
  
What'd I say to her  
Why'd I say it to her  
What does she think of me  
That I'm not what I ought to be  
That I'm what I try not to be  
It's got to be somebody else's fault  
I can't get caught  
If what I am is what I am, 'cause I does what I does  
Then brother, get back, 'cause my breast's gonna bust open  
The rib is the shell and the heart is the yolk and  
I just made a meal for us both to choke on  
Every single night's a fight with my brain  
  
I just want to feel everything  
I just want to feel everything  
I just want to feel everything  
  
So I'm gonna try to be still now  
Gonna renounce the mill a little while and  
If we had a double king-sized bed  
We could move in it and I'd soon forget  
That what I am is what I am 'cause I does what I does  
And maybe I'd relax, let my breast just bust open  
My heart's made of parts of all that surround me  
And that's why the devil just can't get around me  
Every single night's alright, every single night's a fight  
And every single fight's alright with my brain  
  
I just want to feel everything  
I just want to feel everything  
I just want to feel everything  
I just want to feel everything
