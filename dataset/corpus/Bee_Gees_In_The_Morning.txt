In the morning when the moon is at it's rest,  
You will see me at the time I love the best  
Watching rainbows play on sunlight,  
Pools of water iced from cold night,in the morning.  
'tis the morning of my life.  
  
In the daytime I will meet you as before.  
You will find me waiting by the ocean floor,  
Building castles in the shifting sands  
In a world that no one understands,  
In the morning.  
  
'tis the morning of my life,  
In the morning of my life the  
Minutes take so long to drift away  
Please be patient with your life  
It's only morning and you're still to live your day  
In the evening I will fly you to the moon  
To the top right hand corner of  
The ceiling in my room  
  
Where I'll stay until the sun shines  
Another day to swing on clothes lines  
May I be yawning  
  
It is the morning of my life  
It is the morning of my life  
In the morning  
In the morning  
In the morning
