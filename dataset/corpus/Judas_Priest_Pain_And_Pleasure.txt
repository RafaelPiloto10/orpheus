I wanna tell ya, hey I think you oughta know  
The way you're treating me, I feel I'll have ta go  
I've heard the rumors and it seems they're comin' true  
You do what suits ya, but then that's nothin' new  
  
Do what you wanna do  
Oh what you put me through  
How I suffer for your love  
Say what you wanna say  
You know that you're gonna pay  
For all the times that I've cried  
  
You give me pain, but you bring me pleasure  
Get out of my life  
You bring me pain, but you give me pleasure  
Don't know what I like  
  
You've got me tied up, dog upon a leash  
Instead of messin' round, practice what you preach  
Your days are numbered, my day's arrived  
The way I see it, we're dead or we're alive  
  
You give me pain, but you bring me pleasure  
Get out of my life  
You bring me pain, but you give me pleasure  
Don't know what I like
