I hope that gleam that you have in your eye  
Is reflection from the buttons on your blouse  
If it's not then we're in trouble, I can tell you why  
I'm old enough to want to and fool enough to try  
  
They don't make women like you anymore  
And since there's not enough to go around  
If you think what I think you're thinking, this is what I think  
I'd be a crazy fool to turn you down  
  
I hope that smile that you have on your lips  
Is just a smile that you wear all the time  
If it's something special then start making up your line  
I'm old enough to want to and fool enough to try  
  
I'm old enough to want to and fool enough to try
