Here we are at last, suddenly the pieces fit  
All at once, I make sense of this crazy world  
Loved you for so long, now your hand is holdin' mine  
It's like we're standing still in time  
This is our moment, this is our night  
A new beginning of the rest of our lives  
With every heartbeat, with every kiss  
Let's always remember that love is a gift  
With each passing year, we will keep our love alive  
I will be here by your side forever  
Looking in your eyes, I believe in destiny  
I believe in you and me  
This is our moment, this is our night  
A new beginning of the rest of our lives  
With every heartbeat, with every kiss  
Let's always remember that love is a gift  
The rarest thing we have on earth  
Is so special there's no measuring it's worth  
This is our moment, this is our night  
A new beginning of the rest of our lives  
With every heartbeat, with every kiss  
Let's always remember forever and ever  
Let's always remember that love is a gift  
It's a gift
