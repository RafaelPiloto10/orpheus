Someone took my emotions,  
Don't forgive me,  
I didn't ask  
Someone took my emotions,  
I feel good,  
'cause I don't feel bad  
  
You said that you gon' take my heart babe  
But I don't believe in fairytale  
It's the same old thing, not a damn thing changed  
You're playing games,  
Playing games  
Now I'm taking names,  
Taking names now  
And I don't play no more, baby, this is game over  
  
Broke your heart for you could feel  
Deep we're gonna think we're real,  
We're through, me and you  
(This is)  
Tears fall down, feels like it's raining  
'Cause I don't want to feel the pain, me and you  
We're through  
  
Someone took my emotions,  
Don't forgive me, I didn't ask  
Someone took my emotions,  
I feel good, 'cause I don't feel bad
