I've been with you boy, for 'years' is quite a while  
But getting to sensual is really not my style.  
You know I love you and I like it just like this.  
Sometimes I feel like giving you more than just a kiss.  
  
But baby it's wrong  
Baby it's not my kind of game  
If I give it to you now, our love will never be the same  
It won't be long. We gotta play our love just right  
I know you know the time will come  
But baby for tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
Let's take it slow, so slow  
Anywhere you want to go  
Baby for you I'll lay it on the line  
You oughtta know (oughtta know), boy I ain't got no where to go I'll give it
to you, only to you  
We gotta take it real slow  
  
We got together you know I feel the fire.  
Burns up inside me, all the natural desire.  
I know that you feel it too. I know you want to flow.  
Dreaming about it and the fire starts to grow.  
  
But baby it's wrong  
Baby it's not my kind of game  
If I give it to you now, our love will never be the same  
It won't be long. We gotta play our love just right  
I know you know the time will come  
but baby for tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And know tomorrow it will still be you and me savin it all for you especially  
Trusting it baby when I say this to you if we wait a little longer our love
will be forever true.  
  
[Chorus]
