Count backwards 5 4 3 2 1  
Before you get too heated and turned on  
(This guy)  
You should have learned your lesson all them times before  
You've been bruised,you've been broken  
Then there's my mind saying think before you go  
Through that door,it could lead you nowhere  
(This guy)  
Has got you all romantic,crazy in your head  
Do you think I'd listen,no I don't care  
  
[Bridge:]  
'cause I can't focus ,I can't stop  
You got me spinning ,round,round,round,round  
(Like a record)  
I can't focus,it's too hot  
(Inside)  
You'll never get to Heaven if you're scared of getting high...  
  
[Chorus(x2):]  
Boy,boy let me keep freaking around  
I want to get down  
I'm a red blooded woman  
What's the point in hanging round  
Don't want to keep turning it down  
When this girl wants to rock with you  
  
My conscience saying,get down off this dream  
It's too dangerous and deadly  
(This guy)  
Has got you talking round in circles can't you see  
All for the sake of sexy  
(You're loving it)  
Then there's my sense saying stop before you fall  
I don't want to pick you up again  
(This guy)  
Has got you all romantic,crazier each day  
Do you think I'd listen,there's no way...  
  
[Bridge:]  
'cause I can't focus ,I can't stop  
You got me spinning ,round,round,round,round  
(Like a record)  
I can't focus,it's too hot  
(Inside)  
You'll never get to Heaven if you're scared of getting high...  
  
[Chorus(x2):]  
Boy,boy let me keep freaking around  
I want to get down  
I'm a red blooded woman  
What's the point in hanging round  
Don't want to keep turning it down  
When this girl wants to rock with you  
  
Let me keep freaking around  
(Freaking around,freaking around)  
Red blooded woman  
It's too hot inside  
You'll never get to Heaven if you're scared of getting high  
  
Lalalalalalalala  
Freaking around  
Lalalalalalalala  
Freaking around  
Lalalalalalalala  
Freaking around  
Lalalalalalalala  
Freaking around  
  
[Chorus(x2):]  
Boy,boy let me keep freaking around  
I want to get down  
I'm a red blooded woman  
What's the point in hanging round  
Don't want to keep turning it down  
When this girl wants to rock with you  
  
(Rock with you)
