I never thought that a love could be so strong  
It could ever make me, think about leaving home  
I can't help myself your lovin' bout to drive me mad  
One more night like last night, I might have to pack my bags  
  
Bout to make me leave home boy  
  
Got my mind so  
Gettin together with this love, boy it just ain't right  
I ain't got the strength to turn a good lovin loose  
But I never met a man in my life who could whoop it to me like you do  
  
Bout to make me leave home boy  
Got a taste of forbidden fruit  
And I can't turn it loose  
What is this good thing you carry around with you  
That makes a girl want to act a fool  
  
Got that love technique that really really cracks me up  
Seeing you once or twice a week, boy it just ain't enough.
