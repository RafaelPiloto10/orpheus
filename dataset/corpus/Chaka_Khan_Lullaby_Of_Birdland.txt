Ooh, Lullaby of Birdland  
That is what I always hear, when you sigh  
Never in my Wordland  
Could there be ways to reveal in a phrase how I feel?  
  
Have you ever heard two turtledoves  
Bill and Coo, when they're in love?  
That's the kind of magic music  
We'll make with our lips when we kiss  
  
And there's that weepy old willow  
He really knows how to cry  
That's how I'd cry on my pillow  
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye  
  
Lullaby of Birdland, whisper low  
Kiss me sweet and we'll go  
Flying high in Birdland, high in the sky up above  
All because we're in love

Ooh, Lullaby of Birdland, yeah  
Lullaby of Birdland  
Lullaby
