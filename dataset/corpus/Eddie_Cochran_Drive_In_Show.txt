Come on, baby, to a drive-in show  
I know just the very place to go  
I'll be over, pick you up at 8  
This will be our very first date  
  
When we're parkin' in the drive-in show  
We'll be sittin' in the moonlight row  
I'll bet my peanuts to a candy bar  
You'll be cuter than a movie star  
  
When it's over and we're headin' back  
We'll stop in for just a little snack  
Six hot dogs oughtta be just right  
After such a wonderful night
