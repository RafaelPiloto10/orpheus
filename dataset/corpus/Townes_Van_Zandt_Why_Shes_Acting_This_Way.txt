Like silent she stands  
like laughter she falls  
from a castle of sand  
like a memory she crawls  
and the mockingbirds grieve  
'Cause they can't make her cry  
they'll soon start to believe  
that the lady has died  
what it all goes to show  
it ain't my job to say  
for who am I to know  
why she's actin' this way  
  
Once again turn away  
if you're sure that it's done  
tell your prophets to pray  
tell your bandits to run  
take your eyelids of stone  
they won't do you no harm  
take your cross made of bones  
take your your fly-paper arms  
and when everything's placed  
in your coffin and go  
through a scarf 'round your face  
'Cause the subway gets cold  
pack up your sunflower smile  
and your bandana blues  
take your worthless denials  
they're all you've got left to lose  
take your Tinkerbell lies  
and your weary desires  
take the tears in your eyes  
take your cup full of fire  
give your lover a call  
if your legs start to fail  
and he'll come break your fall  
with a bed full of nails  
  
No need to glance back again  
there ain't nothin' to see  
just this drunken old man  
and this woman and me  
and you've made it quite plain  
that we're just wastin' time  
and you say that it seems strange  
that I'm staying behind  
but you don't worry 'bout me  
I can make it alone  
'Cause I got no place to be  
and I ain't far from home
