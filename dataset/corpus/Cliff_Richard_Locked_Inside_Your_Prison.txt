Your love is like a prison wall  
And it's getting higher  
I get so far and then I fall  
I can't get through the wire  
  
Oh oh oh I'm locked inside your prison  
Oh oh oh I'm locked inside your prison  
  
It's as though I'm doing time  
And you won't free me  
Let the punishment befit the crime  
And say you need me  
  
Oh oh oh I'm locked inside your prison  
Oh oh oh I'm locked inside your prison  
  
Save me save me can't you see I'm innocent  
Turn the key that will set me free  
Please let it end oh let it end  
  
Oh oh oh I'm locked inside your prison  
Oh oh oh I'm locked inside your prison  
  
Save me save me can't you see I'm innocent  
Turn the key that will set me free  
Please let it end won't you let it end  
  
I'll dig a tunnel to your heart  
Let me remind you  
Even gonna tear the walls apart  
Until I find you  
  
Oh oh oh I'm locked inside your prison  
Oh oh oh I'm locked inside your prison
