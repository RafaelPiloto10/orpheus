Pulling myself out of a dead sleep  
With the impression of the dream still fresh in my mind  
Before I'm even awake, the words, the music were complete  
  
I woke up that mornin'  
Feelin' so rested and new  
My mind was clear of all the problems  
That been hasslin' my head  
I couldn't quite understand why  
I felt so fine  
I felt so free  
So beyond it all  
As I turned towards the bed  
I understood as it all came clear  
  
As I turned towards the bed  
I understood as it all came clear  
  
I saw myself lyin' there  
Didn't have a care  
Piece of mind was finally mine  
Now free to fly  
Into the blue sky  
Oh great spirit  
Fly away  
Oh great spirit  
Just fly  
Fly  
Oh fly away
