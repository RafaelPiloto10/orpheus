Don't talk of dust and roses  
Or should we powder our noses?  
Don't live for last year's capers  
Give me steel, give me steel, give me pulses unreal  
  
He'll build a glass asylum  
With just a hint of mayhem  
He'll build a better whirlpool  
We'll be living from sin, then we can really begin  
  
Please savior, savior, show us  
Hear me, I'm graphically yours  
  
Someone to claim us, someone to follow  
Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo  
Someone to fool us, someone like you  
  
We want you Big Brother, Big Brother  
  
I know you think you're awful square  
But you made everyone and you've been every where  
Lord, I think you'd overdose if you knew what's going down  
  
Someone to claim us, someone to follow  
Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo  
Someone to fool us, someone like you  
Someone to claim us, someone to follow  
Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo  
Someone to fool, someone like you  
Someone to claim us, someone to follow  
Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo  
Someone to fool, someone like you  
  
We want you Big Brother
