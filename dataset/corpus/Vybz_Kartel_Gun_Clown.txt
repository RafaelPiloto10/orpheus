[Chorus]  
How me fi tunn gun clown? Me nah do that  
Man have gun bag round town, me nah do that  
Have it and nuh know how it sound, me nah do that  
Hype and yuh neva lick ah bank, me sey cou that  
Tek yuh last gi man fi buy gun, me nah do that  
Police hold yuh, yuh say ah my gun, me nah do that  
Real thugs buss it dem nah come ask you that  
Man ah Kartel man ah nuh Carbon yuh get that  
  
Nuff bwoy ah nuh real gun man, a gun puppet dem  
Real thugs want ah gun lock and run guh get dem  
Di mount ah money dem bowy spend every weekend  
Di shot dem him buy dem, load di gun and hide dem  
Aright then, nah buss dem him ongle duss dem  
Tek him time rub off di rust then di bwoy ah cruff then  
Tell me bout him know Dudus dem sey Zeeks ah buss dem  
As soon as him spoken some west man mek him head open

Nuff man wey sey dat a dem ah di big man, dem really nuh mean it  
Me neva see them with no gun yet, rachette me see him with  
Warlord, dig di pit and fling him in it  
Kartel is di champion inna di shouting contest, me move strategic  
This army friend man gi yuh fi keep it, hear it and squeeze it  
Mac 90 rifle Boston beat it, yuh flesh ah guh beat it  
Marrow fly go Egypt, man kick yuh head like dem ah tek free kick

It's like di bwoy nuh like fi see how di scheme ah run  
Diss real thugs and get cut up like ah Easter bun  
When dem check him ah come back fi war, him and police ah come  
Thugs nuh run, cyaaa dem buss dem own gun ah nuh fi Peter gun  
Hundred and fifty inna di clip, gi him di maximum  
Sen fi taxi but him pronounce before di taxi come  
Blood ah run like when voice champs ah keep ah stadium  
Tru mo wild di bredda got him uncle license gun  
Bwoy ah look trouble and ah run when him see trouble ah come  
Nozzle inna yuh mouth blow copper like bubble gum  
Juss like fan same suh him gal ah blow pan me
