Alright  
The feet in my boots  
Are shaking their roots  
For a reason  
I'm looking at you  
And you're too much to chew  
For a reason  
And the problems you got  
Are the problems you got  
For a reason  
And what you are not  
Is what you are not  
For a reason  
  
There's a decadent home  
Where there should be control  
I can't live anymore  
  
There's a festering truth  
Where there should be the truh  
I can't live anymore  
  
You wanna blame me  
But you got misery  
For a reason  
And the way that you lose  
Is the way that you chose  
For a reason  
And if this is a slam  
I don't give a damn  
For a reason  
'cause the point of this song  
Is I'm moving along  
For a reason  
  
There's a bottomless pit  
And you've got me in it  
I can't live anymore  
You're a tower of a cruel  
And I feel a fool  
I can't take it anymore  
  
You're a loser [Repeat: x5]  
For a reason  
  
You're a loser  
  
The feet in my boots  
Are shaking their roots  
For a reason [Repeat: x4]
