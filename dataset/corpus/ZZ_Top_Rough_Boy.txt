What in the world's come all over me?  
I ain't got a chance of one in three.  
Ain't got no rap, ain't got no line  
But if you'll give me just a minute I'll be feelin' fine.  
  
I am the one who can fade the heat,  
The one they all zzay just can't be beat.  
I'll shoot it to you straight and look you in the eye.  
So gimme just a minute and I'll tell you why  
I'm a rough boy, I'm a rough boy.  
  
I don't care how you look at me  
Because I'm the one and you will see  
We can make it work, we can make it by.  
So give me one more minute and I'll tell you why  
I'm a rough boy, I'm a rough boy.
