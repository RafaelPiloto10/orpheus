I close my eyes, I bend in pray  
I train my mind, to just not care  
And to my god, I give my soul  
I train my mind to cruise control  
  
[Chorus]  
Daylight shines upon the hour, of my faith  
I step into the sun I shield my eyes from the glory of the moment  
Going to blow it all to kingdom come  
  
I hear my god, he calls my name  
I most of have told, all men can change  
And for my god, I ring the bell  
I will condemn the infidel  
  
[Chorus]  
Daylight shines upon the hour of my soul  
I step into the sun I shield my eyes from the glory of the moment  
Going to blow it all to kingdom come  
  
For when I was a boy you came to me  
I made up my mind  
Surrender or die  
And space to you  
I'm Going to blow it all to kingdom come  
  
[Chorus]  
Daylight shines upon the hour, of my faith  
I step into the sun I shield my eyes from the glory of the moment  
Going to blow it all to kingdom come  
  
Going to blow it all to kingdom come
