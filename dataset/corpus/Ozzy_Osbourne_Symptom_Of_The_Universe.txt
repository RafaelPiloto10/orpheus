Take me through the centuries to supersonic years  
Electrifying enemy is drowning in his tears  
All I have to give you is a love that never dies  
The symptom of the universe is written in your eyes  
  
Yeah  
  
Mother mooch is calling me back to her silver womb  
Father of creation takes me from my stolen tomb  
Seventh night the unicorn is waiting in the skies  
A symptom of the universe, a love that never dies  
  
Yeah  
  
Take my hand, my child of love come step inside my tears  
Swim the magic ocean I've been crying all these years  
When our love will ride away into eternal skies  
A symptom of the universe, a love that never dies  
  
Yeah  
  
Oh my child of love's creation, come and step inside my dreams  
In your eyes I see no sadness, you are all that loving means  
Take my hand and we'll go riding through the sunshine from above  
We'll find happiness together in the summer skies of love
