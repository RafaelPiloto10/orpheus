Every day we're gonna rock and roll  
Rock and roll, rock and roll  
Every day we're gonna rock and roll, gonna  
Rock out a little bit of soul  
  
Every day we're gonna go, go, go  
Gonna kick off the shoes and dance on the floor  
Every day we're gonna go, go, go, gonna  
Go, go, a little bit of soul  
  
Every day we're gonna twist and shout  
Hold back, baby, come on, work out  
Every day we're gonna twist and shout, gonna  
Twist and shout a little soul  
  
Every day we're gonna shake, shake, shake  
Come on, Grandpa, you ain't got no back ache  
Every day we're gonna shake, shake, shake, gonna  
Shake a little bit of soul  
  
Every day we're gonna turn it on  
Gonna turn it on, gonna turn it on  
Every day we're gonna turn it on, gonna  
Turn on a little bit of soul  
  
Every day we're gonna rock and roll  
'Round the clock, rock and roll  
Every day we're gonna rock and roll, gonna  
Rock out a little bit of soul
