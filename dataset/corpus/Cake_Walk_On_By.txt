The house where you still live  
Walk on by  
The place where we would kiss  
And the room where I held you tight  
Tonight I must walk on by  
  
Walk on by  
The room where you still sleep  
Walk on by  
The company that you keep  
And the room where I held you tight  
Tonight I must walk on by  
  
Somehow I know whoa  
I won't forget you no no no no no, I won't  
You won't forget me no no no no no, you won't  
I'll keep on walking away from here  
I'll forget you when I reach the other side  
  
Walk on by  
The house where you still live  
Walk on by  
The place where we would kiss  
And the room where I held you tight  
Tonight I must walk on by  
  
And the room where I held you tight  
Tonight I must walk on by
