Get it up, keep it up,  
As good as you can,  
The change is good as the rest is,  
To be or not to be when shit hits the fan,  
This is the ultimate test  
  
One up the b-side(x2)  
  
Sing it out or shout it out,  
The bent overture,  
Let me hear it at my request,  
You may think it's funny but I don't know why,  
It gets it all off your chest  
  
One up the b-side(x2)  
(after solo)  
One up the b-side(x2)  
  
I gotta do it  
Just another time or else i'll lose my mind,  
The answer's simple and straight to the point,  
You can see it coming from behind  
  
One up the b-side(x3)
