Hush now watch the stars fall  
Into a fire wall  
I am waiting here  
Waiting for you to come home  
  
Sinking embers glow  
Melting icy snow  
I am waiting here,  
Waiting for you to come home  
Hm, hm  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
And I watch them burn  
When will I ever learn  
If I wait it doesn't mean  
You will return  
  
Now all the stars have gone  
Faded into cracks of dawn  
And I'm still waiting here  
Waiting for you to come home, hm, hm  
  
I'm waiting here  
Waiting for you to come home, hm, hm
