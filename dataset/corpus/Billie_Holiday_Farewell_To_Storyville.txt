All, you old-time queens, from New Orleans, who lived in Storyville  
You sang the blues, try to amuse, here's how they pay the bill  
The law step-in and call it sin to have a little fun  
The police car has made a stop and Storyville is done  
  
Pick out your steamboat, pick yourself a train  
A slo-ow train  
Pick out your steamboat, pick yourself a train  
A slo-ow train  
They made you close-up they'll never let you back  
Won't let you back  
Go buy your ticket or else you walk the track  
  
No use complaining, blue sky's folow rain  
The cold-old rain  
No use complaining, blue sky's folow rain  
The cold-old rain  
Just say farewell now and get your one last thrill  
Your one last thrill  
Just say farewell now, farewell to Storyville  
  
No use complaining, blue sky's folow rain  
The cold-old rain  
Just say farewell now, farewell to Storyville  
  
Just say farewell now and get your one last thrill  
Your one last thrill  
Just say farewell now, farewell to Storyville
