If I had known of what would come  
I might have walked outta here a lot less harmed  
But I'm no lady of the glass  
And I can't foretell what will pass  
  
And I went with my defenses down  
As your love sent me spinning spinning 'round  
Oh you took me to the very top  
And then I took a bad (and) long long drop  
  
Oh promises are made to be broken  
That's all I ever learned from loving you  
And oh when you opened up your love to me  
You opened up pandora's box  
  
Oh promises are made to bend and stretch oh  
And end up being really worthless  
And oh when I opened up the door to you  
I opened up pandora's box  
  
Just one look and I knew you knew  
I was all hung up hung up on loving you  
I just put all my trust in love  
And I placed a big old bet on lady love  
I was sentenced to loving you  
And I'm serving time in solitude  
Yeah I gave ya everything that I got  
And you took it all and walked right off  
  
Oh promises are made to be broken  
That's all I ever learned from loving you  
And oh when you opened up your love to me  
You opened up pandora's box  
  
Oh promises are made to bend and stretch oh  
And end up being really worthless  
And oh when I opened up the door to you  
I opened up pandora's box  
  
Just one look and I knew you knew  
I was all hung up hung up on loving you  
I just put all my trust in love  
And I placed a big old bet on lady love  
  
Oh promises are made to be broken  
That's all I ever learned from loving you  
And oh when you opened up your love to me  
You opened up pandora's box  
  
Oh promises are made to bend and stretch oh  
And end up being really worthless  
And oh when I opened up the door to you  
I opened up pandora's box  
  
Oh promises are made to be broken  
That's all I ever learned from loving you  
And oh when you opened up your love to me  
You opened up pandora's box  
  
Oh promises are made to bend and stretch oh  
And en up being really worthless
