I should have learned this lesson long ago  
That friends and lovers always come and go  
And now you claim  
that everything's "O.K.", but I've got just one thing to say...  
  
Why don't you...  
Find another (find another)  
Find another fool to love you  
Find another (find another)  
Find another fool to love you  
Find another...find another...find another fool...to love you  
To love you...find another.....  
  
I don't believe that I deserve this ride  
Youtook me for my very heart and pride  
You let me down...and now your hand is out  
Well, here's some...spare change...you can count  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
You pulled this once...you pulled it twice  
It's time you listened to my advice....oh, baby  
  
I'd never take advantage of our love  
I can't imagine what you're thinkin' of  
You're over due...you think this storm is through..  
Well, baby, I've got news for you  
  
Repeat Chorus
