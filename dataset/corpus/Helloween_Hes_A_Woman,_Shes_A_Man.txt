I saw it walkin' lonely down the street  
Cool like the cat, like crazy dream  
I looked twice again, I can't believe  
It turned around right then  
And looked at me  
I said oh no, it really couldn't be  
It was a man, it was a woman, too  
  
He's a woman, she's a man  
He's a woman, she's a (woman)  
  
I think it really came from far away  
I'm feeling head uptight so I have to stay  
It takes my hand and says come on, let's go  
We're goin' home, she asked me to stay  
He starts to move, she starts to play  
I need a body, why not you  
  
He's a woman, she's a man  
He's a woman, she's a (woman)
