The thought of you keeps haunting me  
And it's your face I always see  
Wherever I go, I always remember  
Soon it's Christmas, yes, it's Christmas  
But you're not here anymore  
  
The last time it was us together  
But we just can't make it last forever  
What can I do each time I remember  
Soon it's Christmas, ooh, it's Christmas again  
  
Chorus  
Though the stars shine so bright  
I just can't feel so right  
If I can't find a way to be with you again on Christmas day  
Yeah yeah  
  
[Repeat 2nd stanza]  
[Repeat chorus except last line]  
[Repeat chorus]  
  
Soon it's Christmas, ahh  
Soon it's Christmas, yeah ahh  
Soon it's Christmas  
[Fading]
