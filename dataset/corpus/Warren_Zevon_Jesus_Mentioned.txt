I'm going down to Memphis  
Memphis, Tennessee  
I'm going down to Graceland  
Thinking about the King  
Remembering him sing  
About those heavenly mansions  
Jesus mentioned  
Can't you just imagine  
Digging up the King  
Begging him to sing  
About those heavenly mansions  
Jesus mentioned  
He went walking on the water  
He went walking on the water  
He went walking on the water  
With his pills  
Can't you just imagine  
Digging up the King  
Begging him to sing  
About those heavenly mansions  
Jesus mentioned
