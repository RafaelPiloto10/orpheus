Yea, yea, yea, Dear Mrs. Bill Collector  
I know ya just doing your job, don't mean to disrespect ya  
But we've been going through this thang since way back  
I told ya when I get the dough I would pay back  
But I got problems babayy... yea, if you only knew  
I got bigger problems babbayyy  
So why ya talkin about the money that I owe, like as if I didn't know man,  
It don't mean nothing to me  
Cause right now I got my lil boy crying, and my grandmother dying, could  
You please stop fuckin with me?  
Listen here, I aint lookin for no tears, but my brother got a year, and my  
Momma keep smoking that shit  
On top of that, I'm broke, please put that in your notes for the next one  
To call me up talking that shit  
  
[Kevin Cossom - Hook]  
I just can't take this shit anymore  
I just might lose control  
I feel like letting it go  
Please just leave me alone  
I need to be left alone  
And if I'm wrong  
Than let me be wrong  
Just leave me alone  
  
[Verse 2]  
Hey, Dear Mr. Policeman  
Hey am I wrong, aint you suppose to keep the peace man?  
I coulda swore I was driving pretty peaceful  
So why the hell is you pullin over me fo'?  
Is it this black Mercedes? (Oh now I get it, I get it, I get it)  
Or cause I'm black? Hmmm, maybe  
Hey, tell me why my hands start sweatin and I hold my breath everytime that  
You get behind me  
I turn my music down, so you won't hear a sound, man I'm nervous like I got  
A couple pounds on me  
You pulled me over, you frown on me  
With your flashlight, tell me what do you see  
Thug n-ggas, drug dealers, it's a trip, every n-gga in this whip got a  
Mothafuckin college degree

Please just leave me alone

[Verse 3]  
Yea, my middle finger to the law, bustin off, tryna touch the sky  
My teacher said, "Impossible", but I'mma fuckin try  
Plus how he gon' tell me, he don't make the rules  
There's niggas dying everyday, but we don't make the news  
Instead they talkin bout some thunderstorm, cyclones  
Timmy got his bike stole, top story, Tiger Woods "be f-ckin all these white  
Hoes"  
Anchorman stop snitchin  
Cut the commercial, he be texting all the side bitches, hey my goodness  
How ironic, on trial for possession of some chronic

My lawyer came to court, man he was higher than the comet  
Hey your honor, is you kidding? How you sit above me?  
Are you perfect mothaf-cker, how you finna judge me?  
When you home you don't cuss, drink and puff like us  
These cops is bad boys, baby just like Puff  
They hate they jobs and they days be f-cked up like us  
At the end of the day, you n-ggas just like us

I feel like letting it go  
Please just leave me alone  
I need to be left alone  
And if I'm wrong  
Than let me be wrong  
Just leave me alone
