They say the neon lights are bright on Broadway  
They say there's always magic in the air  
But when you're walkin' down that street  
And you ain't had enough to eat  
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere  
  
They say the girls are something else on Broadway  
But lookin' at them just gives me the blues  
'Cause how ya gonna make some time  
When all you got is one thin dime?  
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes  
  
They say that I won't last too long on Broadway  
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home, they all say  
Oh, they're dead wrong, I know they are  
'Cause I can play this here guitar  
And I won't quit till I'm a star on Broadway  
  
They say the neon lights are bright on Broadway

Look at the neon lights  
Look at the neon lights  
Look at the neon lights  
  
(Look at the neon lights)  
Up and down Broadway  
(Look at the neon lights)  
  
Look at the neon lights  
So bright, so bright  
Look at the neon lights  
Up and down Broadway  
  
Look at the neon lights  
Gonna be a star  
Look at the neon
