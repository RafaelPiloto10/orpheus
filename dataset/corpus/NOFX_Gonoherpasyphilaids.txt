Sitting in a room waiting for some news  
Sitting in a room with white knuckles  
Not feeling so good  
I didn't do the things I should  
  
I said "Doc, tell me what's wrong with me"  
He had this expression he didn't know what to say  
"It seems that you've contracted a new strain."  
  
How could this happen to me?  
Another victim another casualty  
From fucking casually, another casualty  
  
All the times I should have worn a jimmy hat  
All the times I said "What the fuck,  
I won't look back, that's not for me"  
I wouldn't listen to reason  
Now look at me
