Streetlight  
Yellow in the room  
Lifting out our futures from the gloom  
Same song  
In the street below  
Football song that everybody knows  
  
[Chorus]  
That's when he told her  
That he loved her  
And he'd love her all his life  
And he'd love her all his life  
  
Bright lights  
Five years down the lane  
Point to where  
The just born babies cry  
He knows now  
They are joined for good  
Life could never break them  
Nothing could  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Thirty years pass  
Like a sonic boom  
Sunlight floods  
Into a different room  
They both know they're saying  
Goodbye too soon  
But there's no more time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
That's when he told her  
That he meant it  
When he said he loved her  
And he'd love her all his life
