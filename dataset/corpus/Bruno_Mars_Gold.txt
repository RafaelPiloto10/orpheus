Chorus:  
There's no light in this room,  
It's so bright, we got you,  
You shine like, oh, oh, oh, oh,  
You are bright, cause I see,  
All the guys...  
You shine like gold oh, oh, oh, oh,  
  
And every time you come around,  
Cupid ain't got shit on me.  
I got your...  
See Cupid ain't got shit on me.  
See all these niggers, we're popping at bullshit,  
But I begin it like a preacher in a...  
It ain't the fuck cause I...  
But every time they fail, she run right back to mister...  
  
Chorus:  
There's no light in this room,  
It's so bright, we got you for shining, oh, oh, oh, oh,  
You are bright, cause I see,  
All the guys...  
You shine like gold oh, oh, oh, oh
