Now you say you're lonely  
You cry the whole night through  
  
Well you can cry me a river  
Cry me a river, I cried a river over you  
  
And now you say you're sorry  
For bein' so untrue  
  
Well you can cry me a river  
Cry me a river, 'cause I cried a river over you  
  
You drove me nearly out of my head  
While you never shed a tear babe  
  
Remember, I remember all that you said  
You told me love was too plebeian  
You told me you were through with me  
  
And now you say you love me  
Well just to prove that you do  
  
Why don't you cry me a river  
Cry me a river, 'cause I cried a river over you, over you  
  
You say you loved me, but you lied  
  
Now you say you love me  
Well just to prove that you do  
  
Come on and cry me a river  
Oh cry me a river  
I cried a river over you  
  
I cried a river over you, I cried a river  
Now you can too, cry me a river  
  
Cry me a river
