Easy, easy  
Pull out your heart  
To make the being alone  
Easy, easy  
Pull out your heart  
To make the being alone  
Easy, easy  
  
Easy, easy  
You break the bridle to make  
Losing control  
Easy, easy  
Crushed what you're holding  
So you can say letting go is  
Easy, easy  
  
Oh, easy, easy  
Burn all your things  
To make the fight to forget  
Easy, oh, easy  
Burn all your things  
To make the fight to forget  
Easy  
  
Easy, easy  
Pull out your heart  
To make the being alone  
Easy, easy  
Pull out your heart  
To make the being alone  
Easy
