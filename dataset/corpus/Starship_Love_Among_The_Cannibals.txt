Love among the cannibals, love among the cannibals  
Love among the cannibals  
  
I heard you sing about love, but that was a long time ago  
I was one of the ones who believed your lies, now your true colors show  
So we stand upon the grave of the promises you made  
With nowhere left to hide and no more alibis  
  
Dark teeth, bite deep, better not turn your back  
No show, move slow, remember to cover your tracks, get back!  
  
Love among the cannibals (Eat my heart out), two-faced animals  
Love among the cannibals (I want to stand and shout) two-faced animals  
  
I move alone in the dark, feelin' too weak to fight  
Cause I know the dream is about to die, in the dim and dusty light  
Where the river used to roll a caravan of souls  
Move naked and alone, shining like a bone  
  
Night falls, skin crawls, darkness everywhere  
Too much bad blood, nobody seems to care, beware!  
  
Love among the cannibals (Eat my heart out), two-faced animals  
Love (Oh) among the cannibals  
Love among the cannibals (Love), two-faced animals  
Love (Love) among the cannibals, two-faced animals.
