Go down my road running just as fast as I can  
Nobody knows which is the better way  
But when that man in the sky points his finger at you  
Don't you ever think no-one's better than you  
  
God's great banana skin  
Don't you laugh at nobody  
You'll let the bad luck in  
God's great banana skin  
It's the way that it gets you  
With every day good luck comes in the strangest of ways  
Just keep your head down don't listen what your ego will say  
'cause when that man in the sky points his finger at you  
Don't you ever think no-one's better than you  
  
God's great banana skin  
Don't you laugh at nobody  
You'll let the bad luck in  
God's great banana skin  
It's the way that it gets you  
  
God's great banana skin  
God's great banana skin  
  
When that man in the sky points his finger at you  
Don't you ever think no-one's better than you  
Don't you ever think no-one's better than you  
  
God's great banana skin  
Gonna get you  
God's great banana skin
