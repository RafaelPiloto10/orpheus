CHORUS:  
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere,  
I'll never forget what we shared.  
Comes a day there's a knock on my door,  
I hope that you'll be standing there.  
I'll wonder what you'll say if we meet  
On the street one day years from now.  
Maybe you'll need time to recall,  
Oh, but I won't need anytime at all.  
Now I guess we've come from circle  
Cause we're parting as friends.  
CHORUS  
Love can make the tears in the rain,  
And the brightest flame can fade away.  
When you look into the eyes of a friend,  
There's a feeling in your heart that will never end.  
After all the songs I sang you,  
There's no doubt in my mind.  
CHORUS  
Another road's ahead of me, the night moves on.  
This heart never lies, these tears in my eyes say carry on.  
CHORUS  
Any day, any week, any month any year,  
I'll never forget what we shared.  
Comes a day there's a knock on my door,  
I hope that you'll be standing there.
