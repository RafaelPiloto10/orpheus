People laughin'  
They got time to relax  
They all say hello  
  
They don't worry  
They don't mind  
They're ok  
Happy kind of loco  
  
They don't worry  
They don't mind  
They're ok  
Happy kind of loco  
  
Too much work and  
Too much of everything  
Can make it for a man  
That's all alone  
Let things go  
You'll find out  
What crazy means of madness  
Of life is everywhere you go

Everybody needs a chance  
Life is here  
Learn to let things go  
  
What's your hurry  
Who's to blame  
Right is bright  
When you're playing loco  
  
What's your hurry  
Who's to blame  
Right is bright  
When you're playing loco  
  
So you're down  
You end up a lonely man  
You're looking for a friend  
But they're all gone  
Let things go  
You'll find out  
What crazy means of madness  
Of life is everywhere you go
