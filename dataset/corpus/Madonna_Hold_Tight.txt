A million miles later  
We walk through the valley of the darkest night  
We made it through the fire  
Scarred and bruised but our hearts will guide us  
Together I know noone else is gonna last forever  
You're gonna be alright tonight  
No matter what the world throws at us  
We'll get back up again, again  
  
Hold tight, as long as you're by my side  
Hold tight, everything's gonna be alright  
I know we'll find our way  
Push to the limit with no end in sight  
I know we'll find our way  
So tonight, hold tight  
  
We live with no limits  
Dance in the middle of the freezing rain  
With you and I in it  
We'll survive the eye of the hurricane  
  
  
Us together, we're gonna make this better  
We're gonna be alright tonight  
No matter what the world throws at us  
We'll get back up again, again  
  
Hold tight, as long as you're by my side  
Hold tight, everything's gonna be alright  
I know we'll find our way  
Push to the limit with no end in sight  
I know we'll find our way  
So tonight, hold tight  
  
Hold tight, hold tight  
  
I don't wanna breathe if you're not breathing  
I don't wanna hear if your heart's not beating  
If you're hurt then I wanna be the one that's bleeding  
It's alright so, so hold on tight  
  
Hold tight, as long as you're by my side  
Hold tight, everything's gonna be alright  
I know we'll find our way  
Push to the limit with no end in sight  
I know we'll find our way  
So tonight, hold tight  
  
Hold tight, as long as you're by my side  
Hold tight, everything's gonna be alright  
I know we'll find our way  
Push to the limit with no end in sight  
I know we'll find our way  
So tonight, hold tight
