Once you get a chance  
You come to baby  
Right back, you call me down  
Used to think you wanted nothing to do  
Was to say nothing at all  
You went like the one time  
A two time  
You're back, and me  
Drop off the back seat  
Of a bad car  
Where finders  
Came alone  
"F"  
Wishing her out of my life  
Wishing her...  
What am I to do  
Came a talk to street  
And a time that you listen  
Don't you beg the time on me  
They said you oughta call her back  
I want to, but afraid to say  
I won't hang up on you baby, child  
Nothing feels like this before  
Here in in my life  
Yeah in heaven and hell  
Baby you're heaven and hell  
Heaven and hell  
"F"  
Oh, heaven and hell  
All the time...  
Want a chance to hold you  
Want a chance to kill  
I want a chance to keep you awake at night  
When the sunlight burns through your love  
But you can't always get  
Everything you want  
You take cards from all under the table  
You're heaven, heaven and hell  
Baby you're heaven...heaven and hell  
Yeah, you're heaven...heaven and hell  
Cover me  
"E!"  
"Okay organ. Just organ."  
Darkness  
You light up my darkness  
You light up my darkness  
And open up  
"F"  
"Organ."  
"This time when we come in, come in a little bit quietly. Not the drums, but
everyone else."  
Heaven
