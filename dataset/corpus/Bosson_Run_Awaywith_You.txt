I wake up in the morning while you're still asleep  
I wipe away another tear from your cheek  
This is not the first time you've been crying in your sleep  
I know that you're affected by what people say  
But I can promise you there will come a day  
As long as we're together our love will find a way  
  
[Chorus:]  
I would love to run away with you  
I wish that I could run away with you  
Without a trace, a secret place  
Where nothing stands in our way  
I would love to run away with you  
I wish that I could run away with you  
To someplace far, shinning star  
The two of us all alone  
  
We were born and raised in two different worlds  
Separated by our faith and belief  
Our love was not accepted but we were meant to be  
And even if they tried to tear our love apart  
You and I will always share the same heart  
There's nothing they can do cause this is our destiny  
I'll give up my life just to be with you  
I'll take you where ever you want me to  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
You, and I love belongs to you,  
You and I, love belongs to us,  
I'll give up my life if you want me to  
I'll take you where ever you want to go,  
Where you want to go  
  
[Chorus x 2]
