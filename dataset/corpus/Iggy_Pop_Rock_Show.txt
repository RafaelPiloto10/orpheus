Rock show  
You came to see a rock show  
A big gigantic cock show  
You came to see it all  
Rock show  
You came to hear it  
You came to sear it  
You came to do it all  
If you think you want to get it for credit  
Forget it, don't bet it  
Call in the medic, he's pathetic  
You've got to let it go  
Let's go  
Rock show  
Come on  
Rock show  
You came to see a rock show  
This ain't a fuckin' talk show  
You came to see it all  
Rock show  
You came to fear it  
You came to sear it  
You came to do it all  
It's me you want to get it for credit  
Forget it, don't bet it  
Call in the medic, he's pathetic  
You've got to let it go  
You think you want to get it for credit  
Forget it, don't bet it  
Call in the medic, it's pathetic  
You've got to let it go  
Let's go  
Rock show  
Come on  
Rock show  
Let's go  
Rock show  
Let's go  
Rock show  
Let's go  
Rock show  
Come on
