It could rain for a thousand days  
Or something I don't know  
Look to the sun and we're having fun  
Beside the river flow  
You're doing this and you're doing that  
Workin' all the time  
Tonight you'll call me on the phone  
You've got a worried mind  
  
And when you leave  
You'll go away  
Gone to stay  
Don't feel so bad  
It was nice what we had  
You'll be glad  
  
I'll miss you  
There's a moon and it's bright tonight  
The sun has gone away  
Stop the sweat and I'll feel alright  
You know I like it this way  
You're packin' stuff for your big, big move  
In just a couple of days  
You'll be off on you're big, big cruise  
Across the USA  
  
And when you leave  
You'll go away  
Gone to stay  
Don't feel so bad  
It was nice what we had  
You'll be glad  
  
I'll miss you  
I'll miss you  
I'll miss you
