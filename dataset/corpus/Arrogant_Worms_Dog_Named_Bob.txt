I once had a dog named Bob  
And Bob's a funny name for a dog  
If you're gonna get a dog, don't name him Bob  
My neighbour's name is also Bob  
And every time I call my dog  
My neighbour Bob shows up without my dog  
  
Hey, Bob, not you, Bob  
I'm looking for my dog  
Have you seen my dog named Bob?  
My dog named Bob  
  
Bob the dog drank antifreeze  
I got a new dog named Jeez  
So I could yell "Oh Jeez!" just when I please  
And when Jehovah's Witnesses  
  
Come to my house in Saturdays  
I ask them if they'd like to witness Jeez  
Holy Jeez, they fell on their knees  
They beg me, "Please, can we meet Jeez, pretty please?"  
Oh Holy Jeez  
  
Well those Jehovah's Witnesses  
Called the Humane Society  
They took my Jeez away from me  
And then the Catholic diosces  
Made a big deal out of Jeez  
And now I have to pay to go see Jeez  
  
Hey, Jeez, remember me?  
Remember the beach and playing Frisbee with me?  
For the love of Jeez
