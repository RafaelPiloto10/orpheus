Sail along, silvery moon,  
Trail along lover's lane,  
Sail along, silvery moon,  
To my love again.  
  
In the glow of your light,  
Let me see her tonight,  
Once again, hold her tight,  
Back in lover's lane.  
  
And then the whole world wll seem brighter,  
As we stroll hand in hand,  
Two blue hearts will be lighhter,  
You understand,  
  
Sail along silvery moon,  
Trail along lover's lane,  
Sail along, silvery moon,  
To my love again.
