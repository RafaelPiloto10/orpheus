Voices slide down off the mountain, sunlight turning red  
Falls on the earth and it spreads  
Even the families lower their heads as they ride  
  
Age old faces of the mountains looming naturally  
I wonder if they're looking at me, their monumental eyes I can feel  
  
In the glow of the twilight the thought of home  
Reminds me now I'm reaching out to you  
Anything I can do to be safe and warm in your arms  
  
All I have from the heart of you  
I'd meet you anywhere in the country or anywhere on the sea  
All over the world it could be I would follow you with the heart of me  
  
Remembering you hold me tight in tomorrow morning's light I will fine you  
When I awoke the stars were out and shining, shining for you and me  
All I ever want to be is save and warm in your arms  
All I have, from the heart of me
