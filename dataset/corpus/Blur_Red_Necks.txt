O.K. I want y'all to sit real comfy...with yer real comfy ten gallons on the

I'm a truckin' redneck and I just refuse to die  
(He won't die)  
I was built big and strong on the state's best apple pie  
I'm better than them limey pin-heads in Europe-why  
12 gauge in their back, hell would stop their mopin'  
I'm a truckin' red stop and I...just refuse to die  
  
Graham, you will never die  
That's what I call chemistry  
  
You're American...you're never gonna die!  
You play billiards and wet that mound, you ain't never gonna die!  
The good Lord above will take care of that  
  
I get free coffee fill-ups at my favourite Denny's place  
Find a couple of tea bags and I kick them in the face  
Sure is damn good thumpage in that waitress' ass  
When I go on tour gonna get me a pass  
Hell, don't want no fuckin' limey gettin'...on my goddamn case  
  
Woo!  
That's in the east of the wood...you gotta go to the wood and go east  
It's in the east of the wood  
  
Go west brother!  
We showed them in Jim Sum  
  
Any of my, uh, the boys here want to say something to audience at home ?  
  
Well, you know, you've grown up and I obviously haven't  
  
Woo! Hope you go on happy with your Miller's Coors Light  
  
I've got every Beatles record
