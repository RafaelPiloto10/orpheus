Church On Fire  
Words and music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
Out on the streets of Jerusalem  
Something was going down  
People were shouting and praising God  
A crowd was gathered around  
Peter started preaching  
His words were clear and true  
The power was strong and before too long  
Everybody knew  
chorus:  
This church is on fire  
Burning with the power of God almighty  
Serving Him and praising His name  
Is our only desire  
Go and tell your neighbor  
All that God has done for you  
Jesus said you are the light  
And this Church is on fire  
The fire that started long ago  
Is burning bright today  
It's spreading all around the world  
Wherever people pray  
The Church of God is moving  
As long as there's a soul to tell  
That Jesus is the Son of God  
And Jesus is alive and well  
chorus  
I said this  
I said this church  
This church is  
This church is on fire
