U R The One  
Verse 1  
It was like 6 of us  
3 in the Benz, 3 in the truck  
On... 85 headed to the Plush  
Ten minutes later when we pulled up  
I parked the Benz, hit the alarm, glanced down at my rims  
Tucked my pant leg in the tongue of my Tims  
Hand in my shirt to reveal my gems  
Proceeded to walk in  
Just then I saw this  
Magnificent misses, sippin' on a glass of Cris  
With a couple of her friends gigglin' I knew  
  
[Chorus]  
U R the one  
I don't give a damn  
Even if ya got a man take my hand, girl  
U R the one  
Girl I know you'll understand  
If u just give me a dance, take a chance, girl  
  
Verse 2  
Said, I know u got a few with u  
Don't even trip I got my crew here too  
Keep it real what u wanna do  
I really wanna chill with u  
Tell ya friends they can hop in the truck, we'll take the Benz  
But if we split up maybe we can hook up again  
U never know I guess that all depends  
If I can get u from the floor to the door of my 6-0-0  
2.0 momo's on low Pro's  
So finish that Mo', get your coat  
Tell ya girls c'mon let's go, 'cause  
  
[Chorus]  
  
U-S-H-E-R, say it  
U-S-H-E-R, 1-2-3, say it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
U-S-H-E-R, say it  
U-S-H-E-R, 1-2-3, say it
