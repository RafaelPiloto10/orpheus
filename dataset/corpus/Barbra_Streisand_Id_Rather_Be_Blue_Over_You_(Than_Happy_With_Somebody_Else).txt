I'd rather be blue, thinking of you  
I'd rather be blue over you  
Than be happy with somebody else  
  
I'm crazy about ya, without ya  
For you, I'm strong  
I can't do without ya  
Oucha-ma-goucha, don't stay too long  
  
I need a little ah, little ooh, little oh  
And I'm knocking on wood  
Honey, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up  
It's so hard to be good  
  
I'd rather be blue, thinking of you  
I'd rather be blue over you  
Than be happy with somebody else  
  
Will I be good? Will I be bad?  
Don't be a fool, you fool  
My little flat, I'm turning that  
Into a Sunday school  
  
While you're away, I'm here to say  
There'll be no ice man there  
Singing the blues I'm gonna use  
Nothing but Frigidaire  
  
I'd rather be blue, thinking of you  
I'd rather be blue over you  
Than be happy with somebody else  
  
Blue over you  
I'd rather be blue over you  
Than be Hap-hap-hap-happy  
With somebody else
