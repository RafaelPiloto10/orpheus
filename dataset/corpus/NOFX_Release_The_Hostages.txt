Stop have a beer it's on me  
Anyone ever told you that you  
Look like a Hollywood star  
Oh you've heard it said many times  
Before right here at this bar  
  
I'm lame  
So I drink cause it makes me  
Happier than being alone my  
good friend Mr. Johnie Walker Red  
Keeps my insides warm like a cunt  
Seems like everybody's got  
  
Something I have not, a reason  
Not to die so I say death to  
Mr right cause that will never  
Be me yeah yeah yeah yeah
