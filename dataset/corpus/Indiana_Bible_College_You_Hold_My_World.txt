[Intro:]  
Whoa Ooh  
  
[Verse:]  
Take my heart  
Lord will You take my heart  
As I surrender to Your will  
I confess, You are my righteousness  
And until You move me I'll be still  
And know that You are God  
  
[Chorus:]  
You hold my world in Your hand  
You hold my world in Your hand and  
I am amazed at Your love  
I am amazed that You love me  
You hold my world in Your hand  
You hold my world in Your hand and  
I'm not afraid, my world is safe in Your hand  
Oh  
In Your Hand  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Take my life  
Lord will You take my life  
You are the reason that I live  
I believe You have forgiven me  
And by Your grace I will forgive  
And know that You are God  
And know that You are God  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Tag]  
You won't let go of me  
You won't let go, never let go  
  
You will take care of me  
You will take care, always take care  
  
Won't let go [3x]  
  
You hold my world in Your hands  
You hold my world  
And You won't let go
