Someone is waiting, lurking in the trees  
The spirit of her is walking back to me  
Ah look at me now feeling emotion  
Ah look at me now  
  
The king of the castle brought her to her knees  
Gave the salvation army girl a squeeze  
Ah look at me now feeling emotion  
Ah look at me now  
Look at me now  
  
Now she's a sallow face  
Scattering her lace - on dewy ground  
Ah, I keep searching my head  
Now it's spinning around  
  
Lifting her head, her countenance redeemed  
Re-acted the murder by the silver stream  
Ah look at me now displaying emotion  
Ah look at me now  
  
Look at me now so cold and yet so brave  
Weave me some wings to take me to her grave  
Ah look at me now feeling emotion  
Ah look at me now  
Look at me now
