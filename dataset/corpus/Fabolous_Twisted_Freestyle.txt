[Fabolous:]  
Ya boy is back man  
Ghetto Fab nigga  
Street Fam  
Guess who  
Whats hood?  
Ya'll niggas think I'm twisted huh?  
But act up and come see how drunk I am  
  
[Verse 1: Fabolous]  
Nah I ain't slip one bit  
But now a days you got to watch who you sip one with  
You get the clip one hit  
And don't see what they put in the blunt  
The newspapers'll have ya face put on the front  
Like "He was just in the club gettin' tipsy"  
"Then they found him dead and patipsy"  
Won't be me tryin' to get me a free fill  
While a bitch drop a E Pill  
In my refill  
I'm supposed to have the toast with me  
I can't let 'em get closer than they supposed to be  
Nigga fall back  
Before you wake up with a body cast on  
Face look like you got a hockey mask on  
Teflon Don Gotti passed on  
You don't want to be who the shottys blast on  
Hey kid walk straight pass then say hi  
Before your mom be lookin' for a casket to buy  
I'm sippin' champagne and swingin' Coronies  
I got them bitches them niggas is lonely  
These niggas is phonies  
I shoot up the club like when Frank Lopez hit them niggas for Tony  
Yeah  
  
[Fabolous:]  
Ya'll niggas think I'm twisted huh?  
But act up and come see how drunk I am  
Ya'll niggas think I'm twisted huh?  
Ya'll niggas don't wanna fuck with the Fam  
Get rid of that lame  
Get rid of that  
We about to girl  
We about to girl  
Come fuck with this girl
