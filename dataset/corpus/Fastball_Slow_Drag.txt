Slow drag of a cigarette  
Slow drag and I'm lying in my bed  
All the world is sleeping like a baby tonight  
I wanna lay you down in the ground alright  
Slow drag and I can't get up now  
Slow drag, you've been messing with my mind  
  
And all the world is sleeping like a baby tonight  
I wanna see you dead in the muddy ground  
You're nothing to me  
You're nothing to me  
You're nothing to me no more  
You're nothing to me  
Nothing to me  
Nothing to me no more  
  
And all the world is sleeping like a baby tonight  
I wanna see you dead in the muddy ground  
You're nothing to me  
You're nothing to me  
You're nothing to me no more  
You're nothing to me  
Nothing to me  
Nothing to me no more  
  
Ain't nothing to me  
You're nothing to me  
Nothing to me no more  
No more, oh  
No more, no
