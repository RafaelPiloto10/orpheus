Blown away like the wind, restless again  
My only friend has gone away  
Washed like the tide but I'm still alive  
I'm gonna drive all night long  
  
This is crazy now, I'll fill the space somehow  
  
If there were someway to get through  
This is crazy now, I'll fill the space somehow  
I can't walk away from you  
  
Shaken like a leave, sharpened like a reef  
All of my senses need relief  
Looking out to sea, I still believe  
That you and I were meant to be  
  
This is crazy now, I'll fill the space somehow  
If there were someway to get through  
This is crazy now (like a finger paint)  
Fill the space somehow (smearing in the rain)  
I can't walk away from you (wash it all away)  
  
This is crazy now (shaken like a leave)  
I'll fill the space somehow (Sharpened like a reef)  
I can't walk away from you  
  
This is crazy now  
(Shaken' like a leaf)  
Fill the space somehow  
(Sharpened like a reef)  
I can't walk away from you
