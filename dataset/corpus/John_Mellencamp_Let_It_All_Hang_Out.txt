No parking by the sewer sign  
Hot dog my razor broke  
Water dripping up the spout  
But hey I don't care - let it all hang out  
  
Hanging from a pine tree by my knees  
Sunshine through the shade  
Nobody knows what it's all about  
It's too much man - let it all hang out  
  
Saw a man walking upside down  
My TV's on the blink  
Make Galileo look like a boy scout  
Sorry about that - let it all hang out  
  
Sleep all day, drive all night  
Brain my numb can't stop now  
For sure ain't no doubt  
Keep an open mind - let it all hang out  
  
It's raining inside a big brown moon  
How does that mess your baby up leg  
Eating a Reuben sandwich with sauerkraut  
Don't stop now honey woman - let it all hang out  
  
Man in the straw house  
Sure don't know what he's talkin' about  
Don't leave me standing  
On the front porch baby  
Makes me feel like I'm selling something  
Ask me in - let it all hang out
