Black is for the nighttime  
Preys upon the day  
Red is for the blood that flows like rivers in our veins  
Gray is for betrayal  
What you did to me  
White is for the blinding light  
That I know I'll never see, know I'll never see  
  
Found you in the gutter  
You needed tenderness  
I gave you everything I had  
I gave you all my trust  
Handed out so neatly  
Caught me in your trap  
When I needed you the most  
You stab me in the back, stab me in the back  
  
Better luck, better luck, better luck next time  
If you do it once there'll never be a second time  
Better luck, better luck, better luck next time  
Find somebody else, you're never gonna be mine  
How do you find the nerve  
To lie right to me face  
How do you find the nerve  
  
Black is for the nighttime  
Preys upon the day  
Red is for the blood that flows like rivers in our veins  
I try and find excuses  
For what you did to me  
Can't forget that burning rage  
When I wake up thinking of your face  
For the blinding swiftness of revenge  
That I know I'll never see, know I'll never see  
  
Better luck, better luck, better luck next time  
If you do it once there'll never be a second time  
Better luck, better luck, better luck next time  
Find somebody else, you're never gonna be mine  
Better luck, better luck, better luck next time (better luck, better luck)  
Better luck, better luck, better luck next time (better luck, better luck)  
How do you find the nerve  
To lie right to me face  
How did you find the nerve  
Better luck, better luck, better luck next time (better luck, better luck)  
Better luck, better luck, better luck next time (better luck, better luck)  
Better luck, better luck, better luck next time (better luck, better luck)
