As the sun goes down, I move around  
Keeping to the shadows  
Life, hangs by a thread  
And I've heard it said, that I'll not see tomorrow  
  
If that's my destiny, it'll have to be  
So I'll face the future  
Running out of time  
I'm on the line  
But I'll go down fighting  
  
Felt the hand of justice  
Telling wrong from right  
Threw me out upon the street in the middle of the night  
  
Cybernetic heartbeat  
Digital precise  
Pneumatic fingers nearly had me in their vice  
  
Not begging you  
I'm telling you  
  
You won't break me  
You won't make me  
You won't take me  
Under blood red skies  
  
You won't break me  
You won't take me  
I'll fight you under  
Blood red skies  
  
Through a shattered city, watched by laser eyes  
Overhead the night squad glides  
The decaying paradise  
  
Automatic sniper  
With computer sights  
Scans the bleak horizon for its victim of the night  
  
They're closing in  
They'll never win  
  
You won't break me  
You won't make me  
You won't take me  
Under blood red skies  
  
You won't break me  
You won't take me  
I'll fight you under  
Blood red skies  
  
As the end is drawing near  
Standing proud, I won't give in to fear  
As I die a legend will be born  
I will stand. I will fight  
You'll never take me alive  
  
I'll stand my ground  
I won't go down  
  
You won't break me  
You won't make me  
You won't take me,  
Under blood red skies  
  
You won't break me  
You won't take me  
I'll fight you under  
Blood red skies  
  
You'll never take me alive  
I'm telling you  
Hands of justice  
I will stand, I will fight  
As the sun goes down  
I won't give in to fear
