Sweet words  
That you once whispered into my ear,  
Promised you'll always be by my side  
Now you say that we're thru,  
'Cause you found someone new  
And to me it don't seem right  
  
And when I ask if there is a chance that we  
Somehow could love again like before  
You just say "It's the end"  
You just want to be friends  
And to me it don't seem right.  
  
Well, I'm beggin' you say it's not the end  
I don't know what I've done,  
But I won't do it again  
I still remember all the good times we had  
Good time that went to make a romance  
So it hurts to be told  
I'm out in the cold  
And to me it don't seem right.
