Just an ordinary day, all around it seems O.K.  
With a normal view  
  
Then you open up your eyes, suddenly you realize  
Everyone's confused  
  
Caught in the middle, of life and fantasy  
Caught in the middle, is where you seem to be  
  
Everyone around is sad, but, they analyze you mad  
Sayin' you've lost your mind  
  
Seems their lives have been abused  
With a risk of being used, no happiness to find  
  
Caught in the middle, of life and fantasy  
Caught in the middle, is where you seem to be  
  
Seems the whole society in the world's insanity  
Sayin' you've lost your mind  
  
Seems their lives have been abused  
With a risk of being used, no happiness to find  
  
Caught in the middle, of life and fantasy  
Caught in the middle, is where you seem to be
