Oooh  
The machine of a dream, such a clean machine  
With the pistons a pumpin', and the hubcaps all gleam  
When I'm holding your wheel  
All I hear is your gear  
With my hand on your grease gun  
Mmm, it's like a disease, son  
I'm in love with my car, gotta feel for my automobile  
Get a grip on my boy racer roll bar  
Such a thrill when your radials squeal  
  
Told my girl I'll have to forget her  
Rather buy me a new carburetor  
So she made tracks saying this is the end, now  
Cars don't talk back they're just four wheeled friends now  
  
When I'm holding your wheel  
All I hear is your gear  
When I'm cruisin' in overdrive  
Don't have to listen to no run of the mill talk jive  
  
I'm in love with my car (love with my car), gotta feel for my automobile  
I'm in love with my car (love with my car), string back gloves in my
automolove
