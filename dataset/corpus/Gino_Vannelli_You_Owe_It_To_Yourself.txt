The coolness of your kiss  
The lingering of your sigh  
Your sweet yet unconvincing smile  
Tell me no lie  
Is it a wish for second youth  
The age of lost romance  
Or does a half-forgotten dream need one more chance  
It's your life, what can I say  
Right or wrong, either way  
You owe it to yourslf to have your day  
Well I must admit I'm crushed  
Bewildered and betrayed  
Still I won't hold you to the promises we made  
Ah, love is such a mess  
It's a painful work of art  
Seems it's every man for himself to find his heart  
So say goodbye and say no more  
See what lies outside that door  
You owe it to yourself to know for sure  
No tears, no lies, no long goodbyes don't be cruel, baby  
Just let me wish you well  
Go seek and find, while I'm still inclined to play the fool, baby  
You owe it to yourself  
So say goodbye and say no more  
See what lies outside that door  
You owe it to yourself to know for sure  
Know for sure  
For sure
