Friends say it's fine  
Friends say it's good  
Everybody says it's just like Robin Hood  
I walk like a rat  
Crawl like a cat  
Sting like a bee  
Babe I'm gonna be your man  
  
And it's plain to see  
You were meant for me  
Yeah, I'm your toy  
Your 20th Century boy  
  
Friends say it's fine  
Friends say it's good  
Everybody says it's just like Robin Hood  
Fly like a plane  
Drive like a car  
Ball like a hound  
Babe I'm gonna be your man  
  
And it's plain to see  
You were meant for me  
Yeah, I'm your toy  
Your 20th Century boy  
20th Century boy, I wanna be your toy [4x]
