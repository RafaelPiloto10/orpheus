I guess this is the rushed goodbye  
That I thought would never come  
The woman who lit the light  
For a family in the dark  
Starring at the mirror  
I see your smile through my own  
Your spark embedded deep inside  
Will give me strength  
Will give us hope  
  
And I'll never lose your touch  
No I'll never lose touch  
  
This will take me a while  
Because I miss your smile  
I guess I new your time would come  
But for now I miss your smile  
It's gonna take me a while  
  
Thank you for your loyal stance  
Green spandex and crazy style  
Thank you for the happiness  
That you gave to our lives  
Although now our hearts are cracked  
And our tears are slow to dry  
We must count ourselves  
The lucky ones  
For we were with you in your prime  
  
And I'll never lose your touch  
No I'll never lose touch  
  
Please stay in touch  
Because I need you in my heart  
Please stay in touch  
I need your touch
