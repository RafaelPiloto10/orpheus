Lookin' at us you'd think that we just met  
And only been in love a night or two  
They see a beautiful woman in the shadows with a man  
And all they see is a weekend rendezvous  
Guess we look like cheaters  
Lovers lyin' low  
We must be deceivers  
'Cause baby they don't know  
I've been fallin' for you for years  
Can't get over the feel of you  
Something in the way you make your moves  
I've been fallin' for you for years  
Runnin' deep, runnin' strong  
It's been goin' on and on and on and on for years  
You make it easy to be a one woman man  
Just look at you sitting there  
Your eyes are talkin' in that soft and sexy way  
Sayin' let's slip away, slip away somewhere  
It don't take a rainy night  
Or music in the dark  
But baby when your body sends  
A message to my heart  
I've been fallin' for you for years  
Can't get over the feel of you  
Something in the way you make your moves  
I've been fallin' for you for years  
Runnin' deep, runnin' strong  
It's been goin' on and on and on and on  
I've been fallin' for you for years  
Can't get over the feel of you  
Something in the way you make your moves  
I've been fallin' for you for years  
Runnin' deep, runnin' strong  
It's been goin' on and on and on and on and on and on  
(Fallin' for you for years)
