Now woman, scent of a woman  
  
A man don't add up to much, next to a woman  
A man can't ever forget the taste of a woman  
A man is half the test, a man is half the best  
A man can't understand the reasons why  
  
A man's just a day in the life of a woman  
Just a few minutes a night to a woman  
See what a woman can do  
To the man inside of you  
It's more than the sum of the sun and the moon  
  
Well a man is a man is a hell of a man  
A man ain't a man in a one night stand  
A man just don't stack up next to a woman  
A man can't see what a woman can do  
A man is no man hiding next to you  
A man don't add up to much next to a woman  
Oh, the scent of a woman  
  
The world would never be, except for a woman  
It's hard for a man to see what makes a woman  
Even harder to impress, cause she expects the best  
She never makes it easy to pass the test  
  
Well a man is a man is a hell of a man  
A man ain't a man in a one night stand  
A man just won't stack up next to a woman  
A man can't do what a woman can do  
A man is not a man lying next to you  
And man will just give up next to a woman  
Oh yeah, here she comes now  
(here she comes now, she comes now, here she comes now)  
Here she comes now  
(here she comes now, she comes now, here she comes now)  
  
Well a man is a man is a hell of a man  
A man ain't a man in a one night stand  
A man just won't stack up next to a woman  
A man can't do what a woman can do  
A man is a man if he can get to you  
All a man wants to do is get to a woman, yeah  
  
[Repeat: x16]  
Yeah yeah  
  
Yeah, the scent of a woman
