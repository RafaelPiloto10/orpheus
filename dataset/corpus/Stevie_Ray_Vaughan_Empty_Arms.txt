You're gonna miss me little darlin' the day that I'm gone  
You're gonna miss me little baby the day that I'm gone  
Cause I'm leavin' in the mornin', won't be back at all  
  
You have run me ragged baby, your own fault you're on your own  
You have run me ragged baby, your own fault you're on your own  
You didn't want me, no way baby, till that other man was gone  
  
You can try to get me back baby, with all your tricks and charms  
You can try to get me back baby, with all your tricks and charms  
But when all your games are over, you'll be left with empty arms
