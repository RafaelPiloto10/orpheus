I was out in the cold of a North London street  
A cog in the hurrying world  
Above the walls and the gate police  
I caught a glimpse of a Holloway girl  
  
She was reachin' out of a window  
From a space just a few inches wide  
'Till the hand of justice pulled her back inside  
  
One day, freedom will unlock your door  
So hold on, believe on  
Be who you were before  
One day, freedom will unlock your door  
  
I know how hard it can be to wait  
For proof you were right all along  
Self-destruction is easy for you  
We know what you're capable of  
  
But like a needle in a haystack  
The truth gets so disguised  
In a kingdom built on madness and on lies  
  
One day, freedom will unlock your door  
So hold on, believe on  
Be who you were before  
In deepest darkness, the faintest light looks bright  
So hold on, hold on  
It's gonna be all right  
  
You're lookin' up at a mountain  
Between you and the outside  
But there isn't a mountain in this whole world  
Hasn't been climbed  
  
One day, freedom will unlock your door  
So hold on, believe on  
Be who you were before  
In deepest darkness, the faintest light looks bright  
So hold on, hold on  
It's gonna be all right  
  
One day, freedom  
One day, freedom will unlock your door
