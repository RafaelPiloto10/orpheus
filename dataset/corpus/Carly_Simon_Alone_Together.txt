Alone together, beyond the crowd  
Above the world, we're not too proud  
To cling together, we're strong  
As long as we're together  
  
Alone together, the blinding rain  
The starless night, were not in vain  
For we're together and what is there  
To fear together  
  
Our love is as deep as the sea  
Our love is as great as a love can be  
And we can weather, the great unknown  
If we're alone together  
  
Our love is as deep as the sea  
Our love is as great as a love can be  
And we can weather, the great unknown  
If we're alone together, together  
  
As long as your close to me  
Our love is as deep as a love can be  
As long as your close to me  
Our love is as great as a love can be  
  
As long as your close to me  
(Alone together)  
Our love is as deep as a love can be  
(Alone together)
