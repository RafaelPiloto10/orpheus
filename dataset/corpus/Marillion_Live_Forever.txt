Well I gave up cocaine and I gave up smack  
I gave up drinking alcohol and smoking crack  
I gave up living on the never never  
But I can't give up believing that I'm going to live forever  
  
Well I gave up computer games, I gave up meat  
I gave up watching TV in my favorite seat  
I gave up wearing fur and I gave up wearing leather  
But I can't give up believing that I'm going to live forever  
  
Give it up, give it up  
Don't you know you've got to lose?  
The desires you were born with  
And your talent to abuse  
Give it up, give it up  
There's a better life to live  
Give it up, give it up  
Give it all you've got to give  
  
Well I gave up sugar and I gave up spice  
I gave up everything that feels alright  
'Cause I feel that these addictions are a chain you have to sever  
I'm addicted to believing that I'm going to live forever
