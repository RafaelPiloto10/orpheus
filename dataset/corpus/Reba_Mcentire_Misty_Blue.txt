Oh it's been such a long long time  
Looks like I kept you off my mind  
But I can't  
Just the thought of you  
Turns my whole world a misty blue  
  
Just the mention of your name  
Turns a flicker to a flame  
I think of things we used to do  
Then my whole world turns misty blue  
  
I should forget you  
Heaven knows I've tried  
But when I say I'm glad we're through  
My heart knows that I've lied  
  
Oh it's been such a long long time  
Looks like I kept you off my mind  
But I can't  
Just the thought of you  
Turns my whole world a misty blue  
  
I should forget you  
Heaven knows I've tried  
But when I say I'm glad we're through  
My heart knows that I've lied  
  
Oh it's been such a long long time  
Looks like I kept you off my mind  
But I can't  
Just the thought of you  
Turns my whole world a misty blue  
  
Oh but I can't  
Just the thought of you  
Turns my whole world a misty blue
