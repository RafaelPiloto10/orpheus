I scandalized my brother  
While admitting that he sang some pretty songs  
I'd heard that he'd been scandalizing me  
And Lord, I knew that that was wrong.  
  
Now I'm looking at it over somethin' cool  
And feeling fool enough to see  
What I had called my brother on  
Now he had every right to call on me.  
  
Don't ever cuss that fiddle boy  
Unless you want that fiddle out of tune  
That picker there's in trouble boy  
Ain't nothin' but another side of you.  
  
If we ever get to heaven boys  
It ain't because we ain't done nothin' wrong  
We're in this gig together  
So let's settle down and steal each other's song.  
  
I found a wounded brother  
Drinkin' bitterly away the afternoon  
And soon enough he turned on me  
Like he'd done every face in that saloon.  
  
Well, we cussed him to the ground  
And said he couldn't even steal a decent song  
But soon as it was spoken  
We was sad enough to wish that we were wrong.  
  
Don't ever cuss that fiddle boy  
Unless you want that fiddle out of tune  
That picker there's in trouble boy  
Ain't nothin' but another side of you.  
  
I know that it sounds silly  
But I think that I just stole somebody's song  
She's a good timin' woman  
In love with a good two timin' man.  
And she loves him in spite of the way  
That she don't understand.
