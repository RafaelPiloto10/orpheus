I know you want your money, girl  
'Cause you do this every day, okay  
The way you doubt your feelings  
And look the other way  
Well, it's something I relate to  
Your gift of nonchalance  
Nobody's ever made me fall in love  
With this amount of touch  
  
Well, I'm not a fool  
I just love that you're dead inside (That you're dead inside)  
I'm not a fool, I'm just lifeless too  
  
But you to taught me how to feel  
When nobody ever would (Nobody ever would)  
And you taught me how to love  
What nobody ever could  
  
Ooh girl, I know I should leave you  
And learn to mistreat you  
'Cause you belong to the world  
And ooh girl, I want to embrace you  
Domesticate you  
But you belong to the world, you belong to the world  
  
And I know that I'm saying too much  
Even though I'd rather hold my tongue, yeah  
And I'll pull you closer holding on to  
Every moment till my time is done, yeah  
And this ain't right, you've been the only one to make me smile  
In such long, I've succumbed to what I've become, baby  
  
I'm not a fool  
I just love that you're dead inside (that you're dead inside)  
I'm not a fool, I'm just lifeless too (I'm just lifeless too)  
  
But you to taught me how to feel (You taught me how to feel)  
When nobody ever would (Nobody ever would)  
And you taught me how to love (You taught me how to love)  
What nobody ever could  
  
Ooh girl, I should leave you (I know I should leave you)  
And learn to mistreat you (And learn to mistreat you)  
Because you belong to the world oh yeah  
And ooh girl, I wanna embrace you (I wanna embrace you)  
Domesticate you (Domesticate you)  
But, you belong to the world  
You belong to the world  
You belong to the world  
  
You belong to the loneliness of filling every need  
You belong to the world, you belong to the world  
You belong to the temporary moments of a dream  
  
Ooh girl, I know I should leave you  
And learn to mistreat you  
'Cause you belong to the world  
And ooh girl, I want to embrace you  
Domesticate you  
But you belong to the world, you belong to the world  
You belong to the world, you belong to the world  
You belong to the world
