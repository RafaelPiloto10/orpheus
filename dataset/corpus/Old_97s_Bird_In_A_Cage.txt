I left you last night on the left coast  
I'm writin' you a letter right now  
The things that you do are rendering you  
Something I can't live without  
Maybe maybe I've got a pulse now  
Maybe my heart's on fire  
A bird in the hand is worth a bird in a cage  
Is worth a bird on a telephone wire  
Left you last night on the left side  
The land of the free to be burned  
Well the heat of your touch is makin' it such  
That I've forgotten everything I've learned  
Maybe maybe I've got a problem  
Maybe my heart's a liar  
A bird in the hand is worth a bird in a cage  
Is worth a bird on a telephone wire  
Yeah a bird in the hand is worth a bird in a cage  
Is worth a bird on a telephone wire  
And I may be a bird in a cage  
But it least it's your cage  
And I may be a bird in a cage  
But it least it's your cage  
Left you last night on the left half  
Of the bed, the half that used to be mine  
The way that you sleep is the image I'll keep  
Always on the edge of my mind  
Maybe maybe I've got a reason  
For livin' even though I'm so tired  
A bird in the hand is worth a bird in a cage  
Is worth a bird on a telephone wire  
Yeah a bird in the hand is worth a bird in a cage  
Is worth a bird on a telephone wire  
And I may be a bird in a cage  
But it least it's your cage  
And I may be a bird in a cage  
But it least it's your cage  
Maybe maybe you are the only  
One my heart's desired  
A bird in the hand is worth a bird in a cage  
Is worth a bird on a telephone wire  
A bird in the hand is worth a bird in a cage  
Is worth a bird on a telephone wire  
A bird in the hand is worth a bird in a cage  
Is worth a bird on a telephone wire
