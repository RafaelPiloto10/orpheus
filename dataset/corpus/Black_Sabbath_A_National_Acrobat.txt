I am the world that hides the universal  
Secret of all time  
Destruction of the empty spaces is my  
One and only crime  
  
I've lived a thousand times  
I found out what it means to be believed  
The thoughts and images  
The unborn child who never was conceived  
  
When little worlds collide  
I'm trapped inside my embryonic cell  
And flashing memories  
Are cast into the never ending well  
  
The name that scorns the face  
The child that never sees the cause of man  
The deathly darkness that  
Belies the face of those who never ran  
  
You gotta believe me  
I'm talking to you  
  
Well I know it's hard for you to know the reason why  
And I know you'll understand when it's time to die  
Don't believe the life you have will be the only one  
You have to let your body sleep to let your soul live on  
  
I want you to listen  
I'm trying to get through  
  
Love has given life to you and now it's your concern  
Unseen eye of inner life will make your soul return  
Still I look but not to touch  
The seeds of life are sown  
Curtain of the future falls  
The secret stays unknown  
  
Just remember love is life  
And hate is living death  
Treat your life for what it's worth  
And live for every breath  
Looking back I've lived and learned  
But now I'm wondering  
Here I wait and only guess  
What this next life will bring
