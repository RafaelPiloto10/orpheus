I read the colors this mornin'  
I read the colors today  
About a man who left from nowhere to be someone  
And every day he has to pay in every way  
  
I met a man from new york city  
He spoke of things I've yet to find  
A good man driven from his homeland  
Tryin' to find some piece of mind  
  
It's a fast train  
It's a fast train  
It's a fast train  
It's a fast train  
  
It's a fast train  
It's a fast train  
It's a fast train  
It's a fast train  
It's a fast train  
It's a fast train  
It's a fast train  
It's a fast train  
It's a fast train
