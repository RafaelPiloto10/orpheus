Boo yah  
There's a place in the way outta sphere  
Do ya  
Want to burn the midnight oil  
Does it fool ya  
When you think there's no way out of here  
Let it pull ya  
From the outside to within  
  
[Chorus:]  
The light inside is burning bright  
The light makes everything all right  
The light inside is burning bright  
The light inside oh yeah alright  
  
May I  
Introduce you to my point of view  
Me, I  
Want to get under your skin  
I want to thank you  
For the pleasure that I get from you  
I want to drag you  
From the outside to within'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The light inside is burning  
The light inside is burning  
The light inside is burning bright  
The light inside oh yeah alright  
  
[Chorus]
