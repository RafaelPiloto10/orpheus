Every man has a black star  
A black star over his shoulder  
And when a man sees his black star  
He knows his time, his time has come  
  
Black star don't shine on me, black star  
Black star keep behind me, black star  
There's a lot of livin' I gotta do  
Give me time to make a few dreams come true  
Black star  
  
When I ride I feel that black star  
That black star over my shoulder  
So I ride in front of that black star  
Never lookin' around, never lookin' around  
  
Black star don't shine on me, black star  
Black star keep behind me, black star  
There's a lot of livin' I gotta do  
Give me time to make a few dreams come true  
Black star  
  
One fine day I'll see that black star  
That black star over my shoulder  
And when I see that old black star  
I'll know my time, my time has come  
  
Black star don't shine on me, black star  
Black star keep behind me, black star  
There's a lot of livin' I gotta do  
Give me time to make a few dreams come true  
Black star
