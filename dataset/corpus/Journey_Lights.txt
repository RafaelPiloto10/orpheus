When the lights go down in the city  
And the sun shines on the bay  
I want to be there yeah, in my city  
Ooh, ooh  
  
So you think you're lonely  
Well my friend I'm lonely too  
I want to go back to my city by the bay  
Ooh, ooh  
  
It's sad, oh there's been mornings  
Out on the road without you  
Without your charms,  
Ooh, my, my, my, my, my, my  
  
When the lights go down in the city  
And the sun shines on the bay  
I want to be there yeah, in my city  
Ooh, ooh  
  
When the lights go down in the city  
And the sun shines on the bay  
I want to be there yeah, in my city  
Ooh, ooh, ooh
