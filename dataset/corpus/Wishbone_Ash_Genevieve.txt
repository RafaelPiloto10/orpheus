Genevieve, Genevieve,  
I went down to some backroom joint  
Where I spent the night before,  
Looking for the girl I love,  
She left and wrote her name on my door.  
She's got a guilty conscience of her own,  
I've got to find out why she keeps running on,  
Why she keeps running on.  
Nobody gonna steal that woman, nobody for sure.  
Genevieve, I got to find you, woman, tonight.  
  
Deep in shadows of a neon-lit street  
You know she gave me the slip.  
I would love her every day,  
But she's quicksilver in my grip.  
Little darlin', you move too fast,  
You're here one minute, and you're gone in a flash,  
Gone in a flash.  
Nobody gonna steal that woman, nobody for sure.  
I got to find you,  
Genevieve, I'm gonna find you tonight.  
  
Genevieve, why did you leave?  
Genevieve, why did you leave?  
  
Don't you feel guilty, loving two men?  
Well, I'm the one to stand by your side.  
Oh, baby, yes I love you so,  
But do you listen to his lies?  
Make up your mind, who's your loving for?  
You're in the middle of a battle with the man at war,  
Man at war.  
Nobody gonna steal that woman, nobody for sure.  
  
Genevieve, I got to find you, woman, tonight.  
Genevieve, I'm gonna find you tonight. (repeat)  
  
Genevieve.
