Come on weather man give us a forecast snoowy white  
Can't you hear the prayers of every childlike heart tonight  
Rockies are callin', Denver snow fallin'  
Somebody said it's four feet deep, but it doesn't matter  
Give me the laughter, I'm gonna choose to keep  
  
Another tender Tennessee Christmas, the only Chirstmas for me  
Where the love circles arounf us like th gifts around our tree  
Well I know there's more snow up in Colorado than my roof will ever see  
But a tender Tennessee Christmas is the only Christmas for me  
  
Every now and then I get a wanderin' urge to see  
Maybe California, maybe Tinsel TOwn's for me  
There's a parade there, we'd have it made there  
Bring home a tan for New Year's Eve  
Sure sounds exciting, awfully inviting, still I think I'm gonna keep  
  
Another tender Tennessee Christmas, the only CHristmas for me  
Where the love circles around us like the gifts around our tree  
Well they say in L.A. it's a warm holiday, it's th only place to be  
A tender Tennessee Christmas, is the only Christmas for me  
  
Well I know there's more snow up in Colorado than my roof will ever see  
But a tender Tennessee Christmas is the only Christmas for me  
A tender Tennessee CHristmas is the only Christmas for me
