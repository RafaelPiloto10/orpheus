I always seem to look so sad  
But that's not me, I'm just bad  
Why do you keep on following me  
Is this what I'm going to be?  
Just tell me what you got  
I don't know if I like you or not  
If you wanna know that'll always keep on trying  
Not to let you crying,  
Baby, can't you see what I want to be?  
  
Chorus:  
Just let me know  
When do you let me go  
I want to be free  
Can't you see  
Just let me go  
I've got things to show  
But not this time  
Let me go  
  
I don't want you here to stay  
I just want you here away  
It's not my fault  
It's something I can't solve  
Let me be free  
There's something I wanna be  
I can't beseen with you  
It's the things you do  
Let me go, let me flow  
Through your mind  
Through your soul  
I got to have you low  
  
Chorus  
  
When I always keep on trying...  
You are my friend that's crying  
Don't you wanna know  
What's got in to me  
I really want to be free  
Can't, ohh, can't you see...  
Boy, you'll have to let me go...  
  
Chorus x3
