Don't put your head on my shoulder  
Sink me in a river of tears  
This could be the best place yet  
But you must overcome your fears  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, in time  
It could have been so much more  
The time is precious I know  
In time  
It could have been so much more  
The time has nothing to show  
  
Because  
Time won't give me time  
And time makes lovers feel  
Like they've got something real  
But you and me  
We know we've got  
Nothin' but time  
And time won't give me time  
Won't give me time  
(Time, time, time)  
  
Don't make me feel any colder  
Time is like a clock in my heart  
Touch we, touch was the  
Heat too much  
I felt I  
Lost you from the start  
  
[Chorus: x2]
