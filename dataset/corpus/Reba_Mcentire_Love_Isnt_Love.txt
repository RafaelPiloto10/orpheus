(timmy tappan, don roth)  
  
Smile's not a smile until it wrinkles your face  
Bell's not a bell without ringing  
A home's not a home when there's nobody there  
A song's not a song without singing  
  
Chorus:  
Love isn't love till you give it away  
Love isn't love till it's free  
The love in your heart  
Wasn't put there to stay  
Oh love isn't love till you give it away  
  
You might think love is a treasure to keep  
Feeling to cherish and hold  
But love is a treasure for people to share  
You keep it by letting it go  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Cause love can't survive  
When it's hidden inside  
And love was meant to be shared  
  
Repeat chorus
