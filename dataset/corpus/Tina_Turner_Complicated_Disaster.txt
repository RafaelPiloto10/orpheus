She knows about me  
I heard about your secret life  
She thinks that you're a family man  
You got two babies and a wife  
  
I never thought you'd sink this love  
Two many lovers in this wrong  
I'm suffocating  
  
And now you're standing in front of me  
Begging me not to leave  
Complicated disaster  
And as I struggle to understand  
What became of the man who  
Promised me ever after  
  
I turn away but I can't run  
You're all that I remember  
  
It's been three hours  
Since she shared her story in this room  
She seems like such a gentle girl  
You came and left her much too soon  
  
She said it lasted just six months  
  
The fear of being completely wrong  
Has taken over  
  
And now you're standing in front of me  
Begging me not to leave  
Complicated disaster  
And as I struggle to understand  
What became of the man who  
Promised me ever after  
  
I turn away but I can't run  
You're all that I remember  
  
All the plans we were making  
Just got washed away with the tears  
I'm drowning  
But you can't save me  
This time  
  
Complicated disaster  
  
And now you're standing in front of me  
Begging me not to leave  
Complicated disaster  
And as I struggle to understand  
What became of the man who  
Promised me ever after
