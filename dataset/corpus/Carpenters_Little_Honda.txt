I'm gonna wake you up early  
Cause I'm gonna take a ride wih you  
We're going down to the Honda shop  
I'll tell you what we're gonna do  
Put on a ragged sweat shirt  
I'll take you anywhere you want me to  
  
First gear it's all right  
Second gear real riot  
Third gear hang it tight  
Faster (it's all right)  
  
He climbs hills like the magic  
Cause my Honda felt really light  
When I go into the turn  
Stick with me and hang on tight  
I better turn on the lights  
So I can ride my Honda tonight  
  
First gear it's all right  
Second gear real riot  
Third gear hang it tight  
Faster (it's all right)
