All alone at the end of the evening  
And the bright lights have faded to blue  
I was thinking bout a woman who might have  
Loved me and I never knew  
You know I've always been a dreamer  
(spent my life running round)  
And it's so hard to change  
(can't seem to settle down)  
But the dreams I've seen lately  
Keep on turning out and burning out  
And turning out the same  
  
So put me on a highway  
And show me a sign  
And take it to the limit one more time  
  
You can spend all your time making money  
You can spend all your love making time  
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow  
Would you still be mine?  
  
And when you're looking for freedom  
(nobody seems to care)  
And you can find the door  
(can't find it anywhere)  
When there's nothing to believe in  
Still you're coming back, you're running back for more  
  
So put me on a highway  
And show me a sign  
And take it to the limit one more time  
  
Take it to the limit  
Take it to the limit  
Take it to the limit one more time
