I'm a singer of love songs  
Songs that are happy and gay  
But how can I sing my love songs  
My lover's gone away  
  
I got the words  
I got the tune  
I've been rehearsing under the moon  
But I got nobody to hear my song  
  
So I'm hummin' to myself  
I've got the place  
I've got the time  
I've got a lot of love words that rhyme  
  
But I got nobody to hear my song  
So I'm hummin' to myself  
Mmm mmm  
I guess it just had to be  
Mmm mmm  
  
Won't someone listen to me  
I got the words and I got the tune  
I'd like to croon it under the moon  
But I got nobody to hear my song  
  
So I'm hummin' to myself  
Well I got the words and I got the tune  
And I'd like to croon it under the moon  
But I got nobody to hear my song  
  
So I'm hummin' to myself  
Mmm, hummin' to myself  
Well I'm hummin' to myself  
I'm hummin' to myself
