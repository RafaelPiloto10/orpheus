Well there's a pain in my side  
But I keep traveling on  
Bring peace to this troubled land  
It's dark out here  
I can't read those signs  
Bring peace to the troubled land  
Hurricane on the horizon  
Judgment getting closer all the time  
I can't find tomorrow  
Bring peace to this troubled land  
  
Well there's two men a walking  
Down the same dirty road  
Bring peace to this troubled land  
They stand shoulder to shoulder  
Carrying the same heavy load  
Bring peace to this troubled land  
One man's eyes are full of sorrow  
The other man's belly full of unbearable pain  
They keep getting closer  
Bring peace to this troubled land  
  
I've got many screaming children  
Ten million rows to hoe  
Bring peace to this troubled land  
Deader than an hammer  
But I can't let go  
Bring peace to this troubled land  
The eyes of heaven are upon you  
But so is the soul from down below  
They'll cut off your fingers  
To bring peace to this troubled land  
  
Well you can stand up and holler  
You can lay down and die  
Bring peace to this troubled land  
We can turn up our collars  
And never even try  
To bring peace to this troubled land  
Beware of those who want to harm you  
And drag you down to a lower game  
Just know the truth is coming  
To bring peace to this troubled land  
  
I got a pain in my side  
But I keep traveling on
