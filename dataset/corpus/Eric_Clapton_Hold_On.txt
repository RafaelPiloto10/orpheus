Deep down in the dead of night I call out your name.  
It seems now that nothing is right, there's nothing but pain.  
If only I'd told you I love you, now all I can do is  
  
[Chorus:]  
Hold on, hold on to the feeling.  
You've got to hold on, hold on to the feeling.  
I don't feel right on this sad night.  
Lord, I've got thistles growing in my pillow.  
  
If you could believe in me, then I could be strong,  
And then we could set our love free and right all these wrongs.  
You'll know when I touch you how much you still mean to me, baby.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hold on, hold on.  
  
Just give me one more chance.  
Please give me one more chance.  
Don't tell me our romance is through.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hold on, hold on to the feeling.  
Hold on, hold on to the feeling.  
You've got to hold on, hold on to the feeling.  
Hold on, hold on to the feeling.
