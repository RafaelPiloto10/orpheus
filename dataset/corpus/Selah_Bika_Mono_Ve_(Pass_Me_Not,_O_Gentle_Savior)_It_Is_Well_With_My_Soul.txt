Pass me not, o gentle Savior  
Hear my humble cry.  
While on others thou art calling  
Do not pass me by.  
Savior, Savior, hear my humble cry  
While on others thou art calling do not pass me by.

It Is Well With My Soul  
Words and Music by Horatio Spafford  
  
When peace like a river attendeth my way  
When sorrows like sea billows roll  
Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say  
  
It is well, It is well with my soul.  
It is well with my soul  
  
It is well, It is well with my soul.  
My sin, oh the bliss of this glorious thought  
My sin, not in part, but the whole  
Has been nailed to the cross  
So I bear it no more  
Praise The Lord, praise The Lord, oh my soul.  
  
And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight  
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll  
The trump shall resound and The Lord shall descend  
Even so, it is well with my soul.
