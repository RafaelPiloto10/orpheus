Take a walk down memory lane with me  
Past a watermelon stand on the way  
Thinking I had everything we'd need  
On Martha's foolish ginger  
You were late  
How could I forget what you said-  
The part about that  
"Love taking over your life"  
Was not your plan  
  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
  
Through the cliffs  
Out of the bay I went  
From the starboard side  
I could black my visions and my passions-  
They keep me awake  
  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
  
A familiar voice  
"Hi. Surprise.  
I've been searching trying to find you"  
I couldn't speak  
My hands reached for Martha's foolish ginger  
We talked until the moon came up  
About how life without love  
Isn't worth very much  
Then I played this song  
  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
If those harbor lights had just been a half a mile inland  
Who knows what I would have done  
What I would have done  
What I would have done  
  
"Memories that we have yet" you said  
"To make like our Burning Bed..."  
Love, don't mistake that it wasn't safe  
On Martha's foolish ginger.
