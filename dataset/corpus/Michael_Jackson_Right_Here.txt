Swv:  
Loves gonna be  
Loves gonna be  
  
Dj:  
S, The Double, The you, The V  
  
Swv:  
Maybe the seems to be  
Some exiculity [?]  
Of all the ways I feel  
And where I wanna be.  
Well you know its really you.  
Noone can do the things you do to me.  
  
Michael:  
Get me out  
Into the nightime  
Four walls won't hold me tonight  
Of this town is just an apple  
Then let me take a bite  
(I will be right here)  
  
[Chrus]  
If they say why why  
(be Right here)  
Tell them that its human nature  
Why Why does he do me that way  
(Right here)  
If they say Why why  
Tell em that its human nature  
(Have no fear)  
Why Why does he do me that way?  
  
Swv:  
Some of us don't beleave in  
Last to what I'm giving [?]  
I'm gonna keep it stong  
Out of holdin' on to you.  
Noone can do me like you do.  
Its true.  
  
Michael:  
Reaching out  
Touch a stranger  
Eletric eyes of everywhere  
See that girl  
She knows I'm watching  
She likes the way I stare  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Swv:  
Won't let go  
You should know  
This thing is real  
Don't rush now  
Just listen to your heart  
And love will be right here  
  
Be right here  
  
Right here  
Loves gonna be right here, yea  
Loves gonna be  
Loves gonna be  
  
[chorus to fade]
