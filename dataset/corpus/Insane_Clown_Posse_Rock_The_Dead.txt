Wake up  
move to the sky  
Play the wicked shit  
and the dead will arrive  
  
Space and beyond,  
mind of an idiot  
I stole your head stone  
from your grave rock  
Consience and confused  
See tomorrows  
dreems on tonights news  
Fallin through a hole in the  
sky will I die?  
And over time of the sight love and lie  
Slippin in the darkness  
walkin through my consience  
Like an android I remain heartless  
Underground the mental know me well  
Bring it through the bright  
lights in the depths of hell  
Walkin through the time flux hand in hand with clear mind  
Thoughts are harmonious like the rhythm of wind  
chimes Peel back the rind and examine the fruit  
Rotten to the core burried in they best suits  
Maggots crawlin out they face eyes sunk in they head  
Throw your fuckin arms off and rock the dead!  
  
Wake up  
move to the sky  
Play the wicked shit and the dead will arrive (2x)  
  
Grab me a mic and rank me one to ten  
And all we want to do is ROCK THE DEAD  
So many thoughts runnin all through my head  
But the only one that's clear is ROCK THE DEAD  
  
It's like AH I can't even take it no mo'  
Release the stress from my jacket and let me go  
Ill medicate, got my whole body shakin  
Thinkin of escapin but they gonna keep on chasin  
I'm facin off in the world in the planet Nigga hoe,  
burried alive like bill god damnit  
It ain't a livin thing it's a no fuck givin thang  
Bring the pain,  
and I'ma bleed with tha rain  
Insane when I leave this bitch  
I got the whole world screamin out  
YOU AIN'T SHIT  
It could be the wrong ones you can bet  
I know you can't hide your face 'cause I'm commin for your neck  
Get hot, under plot, what you got  
Shoulda cut your head off, on the spot  
A whole pile of dead bodies, I'm on top  
Me and my man rockin the dead like, UH, none stop  
  
Wake up  
move to the sky  
Play the wicked shit and the dead will arrive (2x)  
  
Grab me a mic and rank me one to ten  
And all we want to do is ROCK THE DEAD  
So many thoughts runnin all through my head  
But the only one that's clear is ROCK THE DEAD (2x)  
  
Think about it one hundred years ago  
it was all different people livin on the planet  
Now they dead, two hundred years ago  
it was a whole nother posse  
Now they dead,  
the dead probably out number the living ten thousand to one  
One hundred years from now,  
we'll be dead SO FUCK THAT,  
I will run with tha motha fuckin dead  
  
Got my vision on you point blank range  
Strange and I'm commin 'cause I'm in all black  
and I'll be rockin with the axe  
It'll be daylight, then I'm livin cemetery watchin,  
grave diggin  
Sacrafise another victem  
You can hear me screamin through the trees in the woods  
Hang myself on a higher branch if I could  
Gotta get me out,  
gotta get these pieces of gump outta my head  
So I did, ROCKIN THE DEAD  
Some of my best friends are dead  
If you include  
Monoxide, Violent J, Shaggy, and Evil Ed  
Serial killaz from the west and the east  
And all the dead motha fuckas from here to grave street  
Fuck it if your missin some limbs and some patches of hair  
Nod your bald headed throw your nubs in the air  
I want to see zombies jump and screem aloud  
And kill every live motha fucka in tha crowd  
  
Wake up  
move to the sky  
Play the wicked shit and the dead will arrive (2x)  
  
Grab me a mic and rank me one to ten  
And all we want to do is ROCK THE DEAD  
So many thoughts runnin all through my head  
But the only one that's clear is ROCK THE DEAD (2x)(keep repeating)
