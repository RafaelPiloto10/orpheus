The woman's name was trouble,  
She put the blame on me  
I asked her what her game was,  
She said "Misery"  
I didn't ask no questions,  
I did not even pray  
When the angel on my shoulder  
Said I should walk away  
  
You promised me heaven,  
But, you gave me hell,  
Cut me down to the bone  
With your kiss and tell  
Nobody listens to a word I say,  
Still I'm gonna curse you, woman,  
'Til my dying day  
  
I should have known better  
With a girl like you  
You shame the devil  
With the things you do  
I was blind, now I see  
A lying woman be the death of me  
  
I got woman trouble blues,  
Woman trouble blues  
  
You told me it was meant to be,  
But, all you did was put the hurt on me  
You made my life a living hell,  
And drowned my dreams in the wishing well  
  
I've got woman trouble blues,  
Woman trouble blues  
  
There ain't no doubt I'm going down  
  
The woman's name was trouble,  
She put the blame on me,  
I gave her what she wanted  
And I got misery  
Now I don't take much persuading,  
At times I'm easily led,  
I'm gonna find myself in a prison cell  
Thro' the lying things she said  
  
I'll stand accused on judgment day,  
And pray the lord hears what I say  
All my life I never learned,  
I played with fire and I got burned  
  
Woman trouble blues,  
I got woman trouble blues  
Woman trouble blues,  
Mean ol' woman trouble blues
