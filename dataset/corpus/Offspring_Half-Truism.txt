One is for envy and one just for spite  
The cuts in my heart, they show me your eyes  
Don't make it better by twisting knife,  
Turns all by itself, on to someone else  
  
Your self-liberation, we'll leave this behind,  
Beyond slings and arrows that rain on our minds  
You'll make it better shaking it off  
It never mattered anyway  
  
[Chorus]  
If we don't make it alive, it's a hell of a good day to die  
All our light that shines strong only lasts for so long  
And it's ashes to ashes again, should we even try to pretend?  
All our light that shines strong only lasts for so long  
  
The banner you're waving is burning and red  
It's blocking the sun light that shines overhead  
You against the world, diamonds and pearls,  
Voices inside you churn, watch the city burn  
  
Your own liberation will leave them behind  
All the slings and arrows that rain on your mind,  
Don't make it better break it 'cause  
It never mattered anyway  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I won't calm down  
  
The banner you're waving is burning and red,  
You against the world, diamonds and pearls  
It never mattered, mattered,  
Mattered anyway!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All our light that shines strong only lasts for so long!
