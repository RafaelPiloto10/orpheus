You're not like anybody I ever knew  
But that don't mean that I don't know where we are  
And though I find myself attracted to you  
This time I'm trying not to go too far, cause  
  
No matter how it starts it ends the same  
Someone's always doing someone more  
Trading in the passion for that taste of pain  
It's only gonna happen again  
  
[Chorus]  
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high  
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry  
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high  
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry  
All night, all night  
  
And though I'm trying not to look in your eyes  
Each time I do they kind of burn right through me  
Don't want to lay down in a bed full of lies  
And yet my heart is saying come and do me  
  
[Bridge]  
Now we're just a web of mystery  
A possibility of more to come  
I'd rather leave the fantasy of what might be  
But here I go falling again  
  
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high  
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry  
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high  
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry  
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high  
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry  
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high  
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry  
Over you, over you (all night)  
  
[Chorus]
