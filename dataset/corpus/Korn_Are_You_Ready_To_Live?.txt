I know what you're thinking,  
I know what you're feeling,  
I know everything in this world surrounds me,  
I feel you're breathing,  
I feel you're screaming,  
I feel I can't go no where in this world without leaving.  
  
My mind plays tricks on me,  
I can't control it you see,  
I feel it beating down, the fake around me.  
My mind plays tricks on me,  
It's unbelievable you see,  
I'm always testing the shit around me.  
  
Let me tell you something.  
This shit is beaming,  
It won't leave me alone.  
My disease, unseen,  
You think ya feel me?  
You think ya know me?  
Cause I'm the hell in your head  
  
My mind plays tricks on me,  
I can't control it you see,  
I feel it beating down, the fake around me.  
My mind plays tricks on me,  
It's unbelievable to see,  
I'm always testing the shit around me.  
  
Are you ready to live?  
Are you ready to die?  
All I do is give,  
Am I wasting my time?
