I see the light  
Of a thousand lamps  
Burning in your eyes  
Still I have to turn away  
For you to stay alive  
  
'Cause I was born to run  
I was born to run  
I was born to run  
I was born to run run run  
  
Security had a hold on me  
I had a thousand friends  
But reality wasn't told to me  
And I found out in the end  
  
'Cause I was born to run  
I was born to run  
I was born to run  
I was born to run run run
