(scat intro)  
  
My love to you I bring  
On account of you can sing  
Bli-Blip, Bobby, Flam, Flam, Flam, Hit the yaddle oddle bayou  
  
My love for you is true  
On account of you can do  
Bli-Blip, Bobby, Flam, Flam, Flam, Hit the yaddle oddle bayou  
  
My poor heart, gives a start  
Like a jitterbug, just won't stop  
Mix your crooning, with my spooning  
And let me blow my top, mop!  
  
Your love to me I've sworn  
On account of mine is y'orn  
Bli-Blip, Bobby, Flam, Flam, Flam, Hit the yaddle oddle bayou  
  
(scat interlude)  
  
My poor heart, gives a start  
Like a jitterbug, just won't stop  
So mix your crooning, with my spooning  
And let me blow my top, mop!  
  
Your love to me I've sworn  
On account of mine is y'orn  
Bli-Blip, Bobby, Flam, Flam, Flam, Hit the yaddle oddle bayou
