I don't know what's wrong with me  
I've been foolish as a fool can be  
Baby, I can't sleep at night  
And I lost my appetite  
Went to the doctor but he don't know  
It's getting to where it ain't funny no more  
Tell me baby what I might gonna do  
I believe I'm in love with you  
I believe I'm in love with you  
Tell me baby that you love me, too  
I can't fight, baby I decided  
I'm in love with you  
I guess this time I realize  
For you baby I got eyes  
Come on baby and give me a chance  
All I need is your romance  
You know what I'm tryin' to fight  
I'm telling you baby I'll be true  
I believe I'm in love with you  
I believe I'm in love with you  
Tell me baby that you love me, too  
I can't fight, baby I decided  
I'm in love with you
