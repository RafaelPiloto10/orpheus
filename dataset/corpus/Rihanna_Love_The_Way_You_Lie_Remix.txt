Feat. Badboyz  
  
Chorus:  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you Lie  
  
Boy:  
  
I'm going crazy, just another lie baby  
I don't know what to do with this hate and  
Every time I look in your eyes they're telling me lies and I don't know what
to do  
Only want the truth, but I  
Know that I will never get, the love that I had if knew what you were doing
wrong  
Cause this love never felt so strong, but at the same time it feels so weak oh  
  
You know that you're hurting me, baby can't you see  
That your love is all I need, that your love is all I feel  
But I wonder is it still that real  
And every time that I put a smile on my face  
It's because I don't wanna loose you,  
It's because I know it will kill you  
I look into the mirror and say  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you Lie  
  
J-Me:  
  
So I, open up my eyes, open up this healing, that I've been feeling  
Don't know where it's taking me, don't know if it's you or me oho  
So I, just cried a river of emotions deeper then the ocean  
Baby cause I know that I never wanna go  
Never wanna leave your side  
  
I love the way you lie when you do it,  
Makes me wanna puke and get sick of the things that you're making up  
And I'm so caught up in this love song,  
Do you really know what I long for  
I'm addicted to you, yes it is true  
Baby cause I want you to stay  
I hurt myself every day  
I look into the mirror and say  
  
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn  
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts  
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry  
But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you Lie
