Lets go all night hangin' from the ceiling, tied up,  
Pants down, just another weekend  
Won't remember tonight, wake up feeling like, what the hell happened?  
What the hell happened last night?  
  
Grab a beer, throw it back, take a hit,  
Talkin' smack party yeah-rock the party  
Pull some strange, take a shot, rally back back yeah-rock the party  
  
So I say  
Lets make some bad decisions  
Do things we won't remember  
So call your friends tonight  
  
Lets see through double vision  
The best night we won't remember  
So lets get fucked all right  
Yeah call your friends tonight  
  
Lets go all night  
Footprints on the ceiling  
Lights on, pants off, just another weekend  
Won't remember tonight, wake up feeling like, what the hell happened?  
What the hell happened last night?  
  
Grab a beer, throw it back, take a hit,  
Talkin' smack party yeah-rock the party  
Pull some strange, take a shot,  
Rally back back yeah-rock the party  
  
Lets make some bad decisions  
Do things we won't remember  
So call your friends tonight  
  
Lets see through double vision  
The best night we won't remember  
So lets get fucked all right  
Yeah call your friends tonight  
  
Lets go all night
