Good, Good, Good, that's you, that's you  
Nice, nice, nice, that's you, that's you  
Fine, fine, fine, that's you, that's you  
Good, Good, Good, that's you, that's you  
  
Your tasty lips are sweeter than a lollipop  
And every time I kiss you oh I hate to stop  
Keep talkin'  
I wrack my brain to find the proper adjective  
A sentimental compliment to give you.  
  
Good, Good, Good, that's you, that's you  
Nice, nice, nice, that's you, that's you  
Fine, fine, fine, that's you, that's you  
Good, Good, Good, that's you, that's you  
  
Good, Good, Good, that's you, that's you  
Nice, nice, nice, that's you, that's you.  
Yum, yum, yum, that's you, that's you  
Good, Good, Good, that's you, that's you  
  
Good, Good, Good, that's you, that's you  
Sweet, sweet, sweet, that's you, that's you  
Yum, yum, yum, that's you, that's you.  
Good, Good, Good, that's you, that's you  
  
I never went to Eaton University  
Therefore I have a limited vocabulary  
  
And so I use the language that I have on hand  
While making love to you on your veranda  
  
Good, Good, Good, that's you, that's you  
Nice, nice, nice, that's you, that's you.  
Fine, fine, fine, that's you, that's you  
  
Good, Good, Good,  
Serweet.  
Fine, fine, fine  
Yum, yum, yum  
Good, Good, Good, that's you, that's you!
