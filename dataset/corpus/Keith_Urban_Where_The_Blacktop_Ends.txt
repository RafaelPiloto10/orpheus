Gonna kick off my shoes  
And run in bare feet  
Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet  
Goin' back to the well gonna visit old friends  
And feed my soul where the blacktop ends  
  
I'm lookin' down the barrel of Friday night  
Ridin' on a river of freeway lights  
Goodbye city I'm country bound  
'Til Monday rolls around  
  
Gonna kick off my shoes  
And run in bare feet  
Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet  
Goin' back to the well gonna visit old friends  
And feed my soul where the blacktop ends  
  
Workin' in the grind is an uphill road  
Punchin' that clock and carryin' that load  
I bust it all week and then I'm free  
The weekend belongs to me  
  
Gonna kick off my shoes  
And run in bare feet  
Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet  
Goin' back to the well gonna visit old friends  
And feed my soul where the blacktop ends  
  
Give me some fresh air give me that farm  
Give me some time with you in my arms  
Far away from the hustle and the pressure and the noise  
  
Gonna kick off my shoes  
And run in bare feet  
Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet  
Goin' back to the well gonna visit old friends  
And feed my soul, you betcha  
  
Gonna kick off my shoes  
And run in bare feet  
Where the grass and the dirt and the gravel all meet  
Goin' back to the well gonna visit old friends  
And feed my soul where the blacktop ends  
  
Where the blacktop ends [Repeat: x3]
