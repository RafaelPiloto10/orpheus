Yes, I'm lonely- hope you didn't catch it  
Don't want to be down where I last behaved  
I broke his heart now I can't patch it  
This time it's grave.  
I kept track of all the love that I gave him  
And on paper, well, it looked pretty good  
He left a note that said he couldn't stay here  
As if I could...  
I guess my love's got no business, no business calling his name  
I guess my love's got no business, nobody to blame.  
One of these days I thought we'd get it together  
After all that boy was made for me  
But all he left me was a mouth full of feathers  
Little bird got free.  
He always said my love was one sided  
I tried to keep up with supply and demand  
But there was one way that pie was divided  
It was a big piece plan.  
I guess my love's got no business, no business calling his name  
I guess my love's got no business, nobody to blame.  
Well, now I'm getting desperate, baby, getting illeagal  
I got the law doggies on my trail  
The hawk's out and I could use an eagle  
To go my bail.  
You say you're itching baby, so go ahead and scratch it  
But if it jumps off, don't look at me  
You swore to God that I couldn't catch it  
But your dog's got fleas.  
I guess my love's got no business, no business calling his name  
I guess my love's got no business, nobody to blame.
