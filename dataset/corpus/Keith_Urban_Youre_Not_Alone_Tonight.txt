We all drink to forget  
Some of us more than most  
When reality gets too real  
And the fires of hell to close  
But I'm here to let you know that  
That you can make it through  
If you believe that someone is watchin' over you  
  
[Chorus]  
And call it an angel  
Call it a muse  
And call it karma that you've got comin' to you  
What's the difference  
What's in name  
What matters most is never ever losin' faith  
'Cause it's gonna be alright  
You're not alone tonight  
  
We all have our days  
When nothing goes as planned  
Not a soul in the world  
Seems to understand  
And for someone to talk to  
You'd give anything  
Well go on and cry out loud  
'Cause someone's listenin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Keep your faith alive  
You're not the only one  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh you can cry if you want to, go on
