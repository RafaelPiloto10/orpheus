When I was small, and Christmas trees were tall,  
We used to love while others used to play.  
Don't ask me why, but time has passed us by,  
Some one else moved in from far away.  
  
[Chorus]  
Now we are tall, and Christmas trees are small,  
And you don't ask the time of day.  
But you and I, our love will never die,  
But guess we'll cry come first of May.  
  
The apple tree that grew for you and me,  
I watched the apples falling one by one.  
And I recall the moment of them all,  
The day I kissed your cheek and you were mine.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When I was small, and Christmas trees were tall,  
Do do do do do do do do do,  
Don't ask me why, but time has passed us by,  
Some one else moved in from far away.
