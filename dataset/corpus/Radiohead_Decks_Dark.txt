[Chorus]  
And in your life, there comes a darkness  
There's a spacecraft blocking out the sky  
And there's nowhere to hide  
You run to the back and you cover your ears  
But it's the loudest sound you've ever heard  
Are we trapped? Rag doll cloth people  
We are helpless to resist  
In your darkest hour  
  
[Verse]  
But it was just a laugh, just a lie  
Just a laugh, just a laugh  
Even at this angle  
And so we crumble  
A 10-ton head, made of wet sand  
Oh this dread circumference  
You gotta be kidding me  
The grass grows over me  
Your face in the glass, in the glass  
It was just a laugh, just a laugh  
It's whatever you say it is  
Split infinities  
  
[Chorus]  
Then into your life, there comes a darkness  
And a spacecraft blocking out the sky  
And there's nowhere to hide  
You run to the back and you cover your ears  
It's the loudest sound you've ever heard  
In your darkest hour  
  
[Outro]  
Have you had enough of me?  
Have you had enough of me?  
Sweet time  
Have you had enough of me?  
Have you had enough of me?  
Sweet time  
Sweet time  
Sweet time  
Sweet time
