Since the day I was led to temptation  
And in weakness did let your love down  
I have prayed that with time and compassion  
You'd come around  
  
[Chorus]  
I keep waiting for you to forgive me  
And you keep saying you can't even start  
And I feel like a stone you have picked up and thrown  
To the hard rock bottom of your heart  
To the hard rock bottom of your heart  
  
Now this home we have built is still standing  
Its foundation is on solid ground  
Do we roll up our sleeves and repair it  
Or burn it down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We can't just block it out we've got to talk it out  
Until our hearts get back in touch  
I need your love I miss it I can't go on like this is  
Hurts too much
