I watch, as it stops for a girl  
A moment, elaborate and weak  
I am easy in her midst  
Why elaborate, when there's no need to?  
But I do, all night  
My words ring like money off a bar  
She's here, asleep now  
One can only go alone so far  
One can only go alone so far  
I dream of a deep dark grave  
Seven feet below Saint Augustine  
And she's so easy in her breathing  
Why fall in love, when there's no need to?  
But we do all night  
Sleep like spoons and forget whom we are  
She's here and she's wound down now  
One can only go alone so far  
One can only go alone so far  
But we do all night  
Sleep like spoons and forget whom we are  
She's here and she's wound down now  
One can only go alone so far  
One can only go alone so far  
One can only go alone so far
