There is no understanding in this hostile age  
Sometimes I feel just like a rat locked in a cage  
It's hard to live beyond the walls  
It ain't no life at all  
But don't you tear it down  
  
[Chorus]  
Take your chances, I'll take mine  
Chasing thunder is only wasted time  
Got no reason to walk that line  
Heaven's waiting if I can make it home tonight  
  
And with the years I've found a faith that gets me by  
It shows me the truth in a hurricane of lies  
My baby's left a light for me  
That's really all I need  
They won't bring me down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Aimlessly rushing leaves you with nothing  
You need some loving to make you feel alive  
In less than a moment, life can be stolen  
I know where I'm going, gotta get me there tonight  
  
I'm holding on to what I can  
Like any other lucky man  
Love won't strike me, love won't sell me out  
  
[Chorus]
