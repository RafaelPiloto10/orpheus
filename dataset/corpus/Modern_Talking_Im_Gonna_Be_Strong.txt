Oh I can't give you more  
Than my lonely heart  
Oh take me as I am  
But don't break apart  
I want to hold you baby  
I won't let you go  
And everyday and every night  
Oh I miss you so  
  
Oh when the night comes falling  
Falling from the sky  
I hear my heart is calling  
For another try  
I want to hold you baby, I won't let you go  
And everyday and every night, oh i miss you so  
  
[Chorus: ]  
I'm gonna be strong  
I know my baby, we can't go wrong  
I'm qonna be strong my baby  
I'm gonna be strong for you baby  
I'm qonna hold on to you darling  
I'm gonna be strong for you baby  
I'm gonna hold on to my love  
  
This night is gone forever  
Till the end of time  
Why can't we stay together  
You're always on my mind  
I want to stay with you love, I can't let you go  
And anytime and anywhere, oh I miss you so  
  
[Chorus: ]
