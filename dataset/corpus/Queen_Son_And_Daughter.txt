I want you woman  
Tried to be a son and daughter rolled into one  
You said you'd equal any man for having your fun  
Ooh, now didn't you feel surprised to find  
The cap just didn't fit ?  
The world expects a man  
To buckle down and shovel shit  
What'll you do for loving  
When it's only just begun ?  
I want you to be a woman  
  
Tried to be a teacher and a fisher of men  
An equal people preacher  
Will you lead us all the same ?  
Ooh, well I travelled around the world  
And found a brand new word for day  
Ooh, watching the time mustn't linger behind  
Pardon me I have to get away  
What'll you think of heaven  
If it's back from where you came  
I want you to be a woman  
I want you to be a woman  
Yeah  
Gotta save the world  
Ooh, I've just begun  
Alright
