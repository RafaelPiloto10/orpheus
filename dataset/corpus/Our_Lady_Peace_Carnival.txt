You know you're not a strong man  
And you're just about to cry  
Hang on it's all right  
You worry about the future  
The sign said "yoga class for cats"  
It's okay  
The dynamite is waiting  
They bankrupted the sky  
You're frustrated by the cracks in  
The pavement  
And every mother's back  
Once again  
The carnival closed down  
But if this world ever turns around  
You'll be there  
When everyone is sane you'll be there
