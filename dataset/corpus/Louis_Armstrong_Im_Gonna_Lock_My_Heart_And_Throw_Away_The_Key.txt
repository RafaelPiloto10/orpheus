She got the keys, she's got the keys  
She got the keys, what's she gonna do with the keys?  
  
I'm gonna lock my heart and throw away the key  
I'm wise to all those tricks you played on me  
I'm gonna turn my back on love, gonna snub the moon above  
Seal all my windows up with tin so the love bug can't get in  
  
I'm gonna park my romance right alone the curb  
Hang a sign upon my heart, ''Please don't disturb''  
And if I never fall in love again that's soon enough for me  
I'm gonna lock my heart and throw the key  
  
She's gonna lock her heart and throw away the key  
(Gonna lock my heart)  
I'm wise to all those tricks you've played on me  
She's gonna turn her back on love, gonna snub the moon above  
Seal all my windows up with tin so the love bug can't get in  
  
I'm gonna park my romance right alone the curb  
Hang a sign upon my heart, "Please don't disturb"  
And if I never fall in love again that's soon enough for me  
(Don't make it too soon)  
I'm gonna lock my heart  
(She's gonna lock her heart)  
And throw away the key  
(She's gonna lock her heart and throw away the key)
