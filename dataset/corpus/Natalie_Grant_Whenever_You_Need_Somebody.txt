Heey, ooh, ooh  
I know that life seems hard, cruel and unkind  
A lonesome journey with questions in your mind  
I'll hold your weary hand as you walk down the road  
Remember you're never alone, no  
  
[Chorus:]  
Whenever you need somebody  
Whenever you want someone  
To reach out and touch you  
With a love that is strong  
Whenever you need somebody  
Whenever you want a friend  
To chase away the clouds and help the sun shine again  
I will be that friend  
  
If I could have one wish this I would pray  
A heavenly miracle, your pain to drift away  
So I'll keep on prayin' until that day comes  
Remember that I'll be the one, the one  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I'll give you strength in times you're feeling weak  
I'll give you hope and help you to believe  
Yeah  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I'm gonna be a friend  
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah  
I'm gonna be that friend  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Right by your side  
I'm gonna be that friend  
Ooh, oooh
