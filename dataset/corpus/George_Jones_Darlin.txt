Darlin' dearest darlin'  
Put your arms around me baby please  
Darlin' dearest darlin'  
Kiss me one more time before you leave  
  
If you must go be on your way before I start  
And beggin' you to stay with me  
I'm getting weak from being strong  
And first thing that you know I'll be down on my knees  
  
Darlin' dearest darlin'  
Always in my heart and in my thoughts  
Darlin' dearest darlin'  
Having love you once I'll never stop
