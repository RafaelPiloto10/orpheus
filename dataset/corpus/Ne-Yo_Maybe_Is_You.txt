Ohh, ohh  
  
Pull up at the valet  
We can't help but be seen, girl  
Come take a picture with me baby  
Let's make the cover of somebody magazine  
Cause everybody's looking at her  
Something 'bout the way we meet the door  
We catch eyes as we walk by  
We demand attention  
And there's something about the way we take the floor  
Effortless flight  
That's when I lean in close to mention girl  
  
Maybe it's you  
Maybe it's me  
And for whatever reason
