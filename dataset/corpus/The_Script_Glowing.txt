You knocked me sideways  
When you said that you were leaving.  
You knocked me over  
When you cried and told the truth.  
And you left me speechless  
The secrets you've been keeping  
You're running now, but someone's chasing you  
And you bought a ticket  
But you don't know where you're going  
And you won't tell me  
For fear I'll follow soon  
And you're tryin' to save me  
From your past of bad decisions  
But my decision's always gonna be  
To follow you (To follow you)  
  
Never gonna stop 'til the clock stops tickin'  
Never gonna quit 'til my leg starts kickin'  
I will follow you and we'll both go missin' (Yeah)  
No I'm never givin' up 'til my heart stops beatin'  
Never lettin' go 'til my arm stops breathing  
I will follow you and we'll both go missin' (Yeah)  
No I, And we don't even know where were going  
But I'm fleeing with you and I'm glowing (Ooh)  
  
I woke up this morning  
To a kiss just like a whisper  
And it takes to kiss  
When I knew that you were gone  
And you left the motel  
When you're headin' off on nowhere  
But the lady on the door said  
You haven't left that long, long, no  
  
No I, And we don't even know where were going  
But I'm fleeing with you and I'm glowing (Ooh)  
  
I still watch as she's runnin' away  
So she was born to live this way  
Bad man's gonna take her away,take her away, yeah  
I still watch as she's runnin' away  
So she was born to live this way  
I'll never let a bad man take you away,take you away  
So I'll  
  
And we don't even know where were going  
But I'm fleeing with you and I'm glowing (Ooh)  
And we don't own now with all we got  
We have everything we own in a cardboard box  
And we don't own now with all we got  
We got everything we own in a cardboard box  
And we don't own now with all we got  
We have everything we own in a cardboard box
