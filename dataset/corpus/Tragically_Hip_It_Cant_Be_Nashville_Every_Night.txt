He said, 'Fuck this' and 'Fuck that'  
And this guy's the diplomat  
Stares into the blur of the tuner lights  
It can't be Nashville every night  
  
He said, 'We are what we lack'  
And this guy's the autodidact  
Stares into the glare of the TV lights  
It can't be Nashville every night  
  
With its la la oh oh ohs,  
Whoa-ohs and  
Yeahs  
  
He sang, 'I'll die before I quit'  
And this guy's the limit  
Stares into the queer of the firefight  
It can't be Nashville every night  
  
With its la la oh oh ohs,  
Whoa-ohs and yeahs  
La las  
Whoa-ohs and  
Yeahs
