Girl, we've got work to do  
Pass me the paint and glue  
Perfect isn't easy but it's me  
When one knows the world is watching  
One does what one must  
Some minor adjustments darling  
Not for my vanity but for humanity  
Each little step a pose  
See, how the breeding shows  
Sometimes, it's too much for even me  
When all of the world says yes  
Then, who am I to say no?  
Don't ask a mutt to strut like a showgirl  
No, girl, you need a pro  
Not a flea or a flaw, take a peek at that paw  
La, da-da, dee, dee, da  
Perfection becomes me, n'est ce pas?  
Unrivaled, unruffled I'm beauty unleashed  
(Yeah)  
Jaws drop, hearts stop, so classic and classy  
We're not talkin' Lassie  
La, ah, ooh, aroo  
Ruff, ruff ruff ruff ruff  
Ruff-ruff-ruff-ruff-ruff-ruff-ruff-arow  
Though many covet my bone and bowl  
They're barkin' up the wrong tree  
You pretty pups all over the city  
I have your hearts and you have my pity  
Pretty is nice, but still, it's just pretty  
Perfect, my dear, is me
