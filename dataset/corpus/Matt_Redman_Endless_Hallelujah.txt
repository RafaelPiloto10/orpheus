When I stand before Your throne  
Dressed in glory not my own  
What a joy I'll sing of on that day  
No more tears or broken dreams  
Forgotten is the minor key  
Everything as it was meant to be  
  
[Chorus]  
And we will worship, worship  
Forever in Your presence we will sing  
We will worship, worship You  
An endless hallelujah to the King  
  
I will see You as You are  
Love You with unsinning heart  
And see how much You paid to bring me home  
Not till then, Lord, shall I know  
Not till then, how much I owe  
Everything I am before Your throne  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No more tears, no more shame  
No more sin or sorrow ever known again  
No more fears, no more pain  
We will see You face to face  
See You face to face  
  
[Chorus x2]  
An endless hallelujah to the King  
We'll sing an endless hallelujah to the King  
To the King  
Sing an endless hallelujah  
To You, to you  
Forever and ever  
And Ever and ever  
Saints and angels  
Living creatures  
All the hosts of heaven  
Hallelujah hallelujah  
To You  
An endless hallelujah  
  
[Chorus]
