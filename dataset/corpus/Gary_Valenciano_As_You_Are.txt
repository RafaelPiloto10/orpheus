In a world  
When nothing seems to matter no more  
When everybody is out  
To get a little more and more  
There you are  
Shining like a star  
Every minute of the day  
(Showing us the way)  
And all that one has got to do  
Is call your name and know  
That what you were before  
You are today will be tomorrow  
Coz you have a soul desire  
(To) Share this love with everyone  
So when you're down and out and lonely  
If you need some lovin'  
He's got a lot to show  
No he'll never leave  
You just got to believe  
Don't you go believin' the devil  
He takes pleasure in his lies  
Jesus is the giver of life  
And He'll just take you as you are  
No need to be a hero or a superstar  
All your needs are known  
He'll make you know (it)  
That He is provider  
And He'll just take you as you are  
Don't you know that He can mend your broken heart  
No matter where where you've gone  
Or what you've done  
No, it doesn't matter  
('Coz He'll just take you as you are)  
You walk around  
You show the world that all is alright  
Yet not a word is heard about the truth (You're losing the fight)  
Day by day  
Taking come what may  
Give it in to just 'bout anything and everything and everything  
Suddenly things zip from bad to worst  
And now you find  
You need direction  
You need a hand, the loving kind  
(But) He's got a soul desire  
(To) Share this love with everyone  
So when you gotta get it goin'  
He will hear you calling  
Eager to make you know  
That He'll never leave  
You just got to believe  
To the soul of every believer  
He takes pleasure in your life  
Jesus is the way, the truth and life-a
