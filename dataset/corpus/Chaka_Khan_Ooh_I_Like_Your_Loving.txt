I refuse to be amused  
That's sumthin' that ain't right  
I declare I'm well aware  
I felt the angel's vibes  
  
I can hear ya callin'  
No I'm not stallin'  
I'm justa doin' sumthin' else  
When I'm with you  
(I'm really with you)  
But right now I'm by myself  
And I...  
  
Chorus  
  
I can feel this fire  
Such a strange desire  
As strong as life itself  
I, I can feel this fire  
Such a strange desire  
And I don't want nothin' else  
But ooh I like your lovin'  
  
Talk so much I'm in a flux  
Ya just can't make up your mind  
Executin' dreams ain't easy  
Justa wastin' precious time  
Talk is cheap your words are weak  
I don't want you wastin' mine  
  
I hear ya callin'  
No I'm not stallin'  
I'm justa doin' sumthin' else  
When we're together  
(sho 'nuff together)  
Right now I'm by myself  
And I...  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Ad lib to fade
