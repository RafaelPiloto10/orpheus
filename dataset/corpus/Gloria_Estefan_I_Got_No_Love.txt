I got no love in me  
Guess who's to blame  
It's a crying shame  
Well it's all because of you  
Don't live a lie, it's true, oh oh  
I got no love in me  
It's a mystery  
How I just couldn't see  
You dogged me long enough  
Left me dry but I'm tough  
I got no love in me  
You ask me who to blame  
Well it's only you  
You ask me who I trust  
Well it's me that's who  
Baby it's true  
You hurt me so much  
You're all I ever knew  
I knew it when I looked  
Into your eyes  
I should have known then  
I should have realized  
All of your lies  
Baby did not amount to love  
Just remember one thing  
What goes around comes around  
And what you did to me  
One day I'll make you see baby  
I got no love in me  
Guess who's to blame  
It's a crying shame  
Well it's all because of you  
Don't live a lie, it's true, oh, oh  
I got no love in me  
It's a mystery  
How I just couldn't see  
You dogged me long enough  
Left me dry but I'm tough  
I got no love in me  
Bet you couldn't tell, bet you didn't know  
You're the only man I really loved  
Every single kiss, every time we touched  
Imagined what you missed  
Imagine now baby how's it gonna be  
What you gonna do when you didn't have me  
Whatcha gonna do when it's not real  
And how's it gonna feel  
Deep inside of me  
I hope you find what makes you happy  
Baby now that you're free  
This is all that's left of me, baby  
I got no love in me  
Guess who's to blame  
It's a crying shame  
Well it's all because of you  
Don't live a lie, it's true, oh oh  
I got no love in me  
It's a mystery  
How I just couldn't see  
You dogged me long enough  
Left me dry but I'm tough  
I got no love in me  
I got no love  
I got no love  
Got no love  
I got no love in me  
I got no love  
I got no love  
I got no love in me  
I got no love in me  
Guess who's to blame  
It's a crying shame  
Well it's all because of you  
Don't live a lie, it's true, oh oh  
I got no love in me  
It's a mystery  
How I just couldn't see  
You dogged me long enough  
Left me dry but I'm tough  
I got no love in me  
I got no love in me, oh oh  
I got no love in me  
Got no love in me  
I got no love in me  
Guess who's to blame  
It's a crying shame  
Well it's all because of you  
Don't live a lie, it's true, oh oh  
I got no love in me  
It's a mystery  
How I just couldn't see
