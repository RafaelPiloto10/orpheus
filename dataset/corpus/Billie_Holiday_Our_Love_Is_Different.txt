Our love is different dear  
It's like a mighty symphony  
I can feel its silver harmony  
Oh so tenderly, day by day  
  
Our love is different dear  
To me it's almost heavenly  
Let us guard it ever preciously  
Even jealously  
While we may  
A love like ours dear heart  
The angels send  
And as I know dear heart  
That it won't ever end  
For as the years roll by  
You'll learn my love for you is true  
And I'm sure I'll learn the same from you  
For our love is different dear  
  
A love like ours dear heart  
The angels send  
And as I know dear heart  
That is won't ever end  
For as the years roll by  
You'll learn my love for you is true  
And I'm sure I'll learn the same from you  
For our love is different dear
