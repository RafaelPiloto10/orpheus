Spiders in the night  
Creeping round the walls  
Now you'll feel him  
Crawling over you  
  
Creepy crawly things  
Filling up your bed  
Soon you'll feel him  
Crawling through your brains  
  
You think he's there  
Beware his bite  
But when you look  
The spider's not in sight  
  
Spiders reappear  
Taking peoples names  
Everything is taken down insane  
  
There's no way out  
And there's no key  
But here's a clue  
The spider's really me  
  
You're written in his book  
The spider won't forget  
You won't forget  
The spiders in the night  
  
The end is going night  
Itsy bitsy friends  
The spiders disappearing from the night  
  
You think he's gone  
You think he's dead  
There's no escape  
The spiders in your head  
  
All the spiders in the night [Repeat x 3]
