Don't you like to see the hero take his licks like a man  
Stand up and be tested and be true ?  
Would you like to be a hero in your life ? well you can  
Did you know it's up to you ?  
Would you trade your place with jesus on the cross if you could  
Shining through eternity ?  
Would it bother you to know that you can be just as good  
As you really want to be ?  
And if you're bound to do your duty then it's time that you do  
Look your future in the face  
For the most important person in the world, which is you,  
Or the whole damn human race  
Chorus:  
There's a holy band of angels flying high through the night  
Where no mortal ever trod  
Singing holy, holy, holy, holy, oh, jesus christ  
Is the lord almighty god  
  
You see, the good thing is you don't have to be as good as jesus to  
Start out with  
All you gotta do ask yourself, how would gary cooper have done it  
Or john kennedy  
Or martin luther king  
Or malcom x ?  
Chorus:  
There's a holy band of angels flying high through the night  
Where no mortal ever trod  
Singing holy, holy, holy, holy, oh, jesus christ  
Is the lord almighty god
