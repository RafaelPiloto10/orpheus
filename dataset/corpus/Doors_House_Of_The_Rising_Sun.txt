There is a house in New Orleans  
They call the Rising Sun  
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy  
And God, I know I'm one.  
  
My mother was a tailor  
She sewed my new blue jeans  
My father was a gambling man  
Down in New Orleans.  
  
Now, the only thing a gambler needs  
Is a suitcase and a trunk  
And the only time that he's satisfied  
Is when he's out on a drunk.  
  
Oh, Mother, tell your children  
Not to do what I have done.  
Spend your lives in sin and misery  
In the House of the Rising Sun.  
  
Well, I've got one foot on the platform,  
The other foot on the train  
I'm going back to New Orleans  
To wear that ball and chain.  
  
Well, there is a house in New Orleans  
They call the Rising Sun  
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy  
And God, I know I'm one.
