I'm singin' in the rain, just singin' in the rain  
What a glorious feeling I'm happy again  
I'm laughing at clouds so dark above  
The sun's in my heart and I'm ready for love  
Let the stormy clouds chase everyone from the place  
Come on with the rain, I've a smile on my face  
I'll walk down the lane with a happy refrain  
And singin' just singin' in the rain  
  
Why am I smilin' and why do I sing?  
Why does December seem sunny as Spring?  
Why do I get up each morning to start happy  
And get up with joy in my heart?  
Why is each new task a trifle to do?  
Because I am living a life full of you  
  
I'm singin' in the rain, just singin' in the rain  
What a glorious feeling I'm happy again  
I'm laughing at clouds so dark above  
The sun's in my heart and I'm ready for love  
Let the stormy clouds chase everyone from the place  
Come on with the rain, I've a smile on my face  
I'll walk down the lane with a happy refrain  
And singin' just singin' in the rain
