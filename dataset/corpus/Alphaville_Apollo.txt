Show me a place that ain't hell  
If there's space, give me room to breathe  
That's all that I need for this body can't fail  
And if music be the food of love  
Play on, give me excess of it  
Let it all out, please let me out of here  
And I shall rise from the ashes  
  
Grow like a rose from the ruins  
There must be light in the darkness  
Hope at the end of the night  
Yes, I've been tryin' all my  
Life to get to heaven  
But awoke in the eye of the storm  
But I shall rise from the ashes  
Grow from the ruins and return back home  
  
This is a call from the goals coming up  
To the prisoners of pleasure  
Drunk on the blood of the next generations  
And I've been through many strange confusions  
Splitting myself into to many faces  
Now the mirror is broken  
I can see the worms behind  
You may well have your ways of triumph  
You may well have your ways of truth  
  
Just gimme some room to breathe  
That's all that I need  
Me and my strange friends  
We all belong to the grand astral body  
Take my hand and I take you out of here  
And there's you behind those legendary curtains  
Take my hand before you wither in the crowd  
  
And I take you out of here  
This is the end of the show I don't know  
Was I wrong was I right  
Oh love, I don't know, I wasn't perfect for sure  
But now I feel like a new born baby  
Lying in the dew of the morning  
Laughing at the sky like a brave new Apollo
