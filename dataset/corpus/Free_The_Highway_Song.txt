So we started in the cornfield  
And I know we did not slack  
We got everything in order  
But we forgot to bring the bucket back  
The foreman he went crazy  
And ran around the field  
Said we must be lazy  
Had to be seen to be believed  
Seen to be believed.  
  
But it was a long way  
From this highroad  
It was a far away from here.  
  
The farmer had a daughter  
And she worked at the wishing well  
Put one leg in the water  
'Til she found the mission bell  
The old man went crazy  
And ran to get his gun  
We had a bad time explaining  
We were just having drunken fun  
Just having drunken fun.  
  
But it was a long way  
From this high road, Oh!  
It was a long way from here  
So we walked along this road  
Just tellin' stories as we go  
We just walk along.  
  
Well the farmer had a daughter  
And she did not speak a word  
We used to kiss her in the orchard  
Till one morning we were overheard  
The old man he went crazy  
Running around the field  
Said we must be crazy  
Had to be seen to be believed  
Seen to be believed
