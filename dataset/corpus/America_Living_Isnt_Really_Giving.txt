Oh, I wish that I could find the reason why  
Living isn't really giving  
Oh, I wish that I could find the reason why  
Living isn't really giving  
  
But I don't care how long it takes  
For the days to get nice  
'Cause me and my friends, you know we're ready  
And willing to pay the price  
  
Oh, la la la ....  
  
Way deep down inside  
I know I'm on a free ride  
But when the green light turns to red  
Who is living, who is dead  
  
They've taken out the river  
And they've put in a cement road  
It's made the going a whole lot lighter  
But made a much heavier load  
  
I don't know how long I can go on like this  
Don't know how long I can go on like this  
Don't know how long I can go on like this  
  
I see the light switch on the wall  
With no legs I'm still tall  
We might not make it at all  
I can see the river and the little place where I would swim  
Where did it all begin  
I wish I knew  
  
Oh, I wish that I could find the reason why  
Living isn't really giving  
Isn't really giving  
Isn't really giving
