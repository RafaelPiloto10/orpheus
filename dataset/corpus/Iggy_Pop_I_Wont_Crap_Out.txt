I'm standin' in a shadow, hating the world  
I keep a wall around me, block out the herd  
It's a nerve-wreck placeto be, it kills real  
Quick  
You gotta scrape the concrete off your dick  
But we're gonna live so happily  
In a faraway place, just you and me  
If I don't crap out  
The sun will shine and give us a hug  
The world will sing like a happy bug  
If I don't crap out  
No and I won't crap out  
I won't crap out  
  
I'm glad I am crazy, it keeps me trying  
I despise the trendies, I know  
They're lying  
  
If you want to stir up real mud  
You had better pay with real blood  
But the birds will sing a sweet melody  
In a couple of green indifferent trees  
If I don't crap out  
  
And you're gonna know how fine you are  
Gonna write your name on a violet star  
If I don't crap out  
  
We'll have a window and we'll have a door  
And a reason to be living for  
If I don't crap out  
  
And the material singers will fade into dust  
Like forgotten merchants of disgust  
If I don't crap out  
No I won't crap out  
No I'll never crap out  
Oh I won't crap out  
I won't crap out
