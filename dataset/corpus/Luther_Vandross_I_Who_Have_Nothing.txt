I, I who have nothing  
I, I who have no one  
Adore you, and want you so  
I'm just a no one  
With nothing to give you  
But Ooh, I love you  
  
She, she buys you diamonds  
Say they're bright, they are bright sparkling diamonds  
But believe me, boy, Ooo boy, hear what I say  
She could give you the world  
But she'll never love you the way  
That I love you, baby  
  
You can go any place you want  
To fancy clubs and restaurants  
But I can only watch you with her  
My nose pressed up against the window pane  
The window pane  
Oh Yeah, yeah  
  
I  
Who have nothing  
Nothing  
I  
Who have no one  
Must watch you  
I will watch you, baby  
Go passing by  
But you don't see me  
Wrapped in the arms of  
Wrapped in the arms of somebody else  
When darling it's I  
Who  
Really loves you, baby  
Really loves you, baby  
I'm the one  
I'm the one, I'm the one  
  
I want to be the one that you just can't live without  
I want to be the one that you never feel no doubt  
I want to be the one that you let give you the lovin'  
But, I have nothing  
Nothing  
  
I want to be the one that you always want to be near  
I want to say the words that your body and soul need to hear  
I want to be the one that you let give you all the lovin'  
But I have nothing
