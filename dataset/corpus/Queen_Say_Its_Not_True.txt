The harder we play  
The faster we fall  
When we think that we know it all  
We know nothing at all  
  
The letter arrives  
Like a bolt from the blue  
So what's left of your lives  
All your dreams lost to you  
  
Say it's not true  
Say it today  
When I open my eyes  
Will it all go away  
  
Say it's not true  
Say it for real  
Can't be happening to you  
Can't be happening to me  
  
It's hard not to cry  
It's hard to believe  
So much heartache and pain  
So much reason to grieve  
  
With the wonders of science  
All the knowledge we've stored  
Magic cocktails for lives  
People just can't afford  
  
Say it's not true  
You can say it's not right  
It's hard to believe  
The size of the crime  
  
Say it's not true  
You can say it's not real  
Could be happening to you  
Could be happening to me
