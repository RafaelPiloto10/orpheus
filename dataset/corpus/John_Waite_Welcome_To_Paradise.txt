Sour milk in the saucer  
And the cat won't come home  
And sometimes New York City  
Feels like burnin' Rome  
I'm lost and I'm crazy  
Too much time on my own  
I'd give anything to find a heart  
That can't be sold  
Welcome to paradise  
Here is my brave new world  
And in my paradise  
I'm waiting for a certain girl  
Dead flowers in the darkness  
Red rose wrapped in lace  
Ice-cold vodka tears  
Stainin' my face  
My heart's growin' colder  
And the things I have seen  
Won't someone come and get me  
Wake me from this dream  
Welcome to paradise  
Here is my brave new world  
And in my paradise  
I'm waiting for a special girl  
Here in my paradise  
I'm waitin' for something new  
And here in my brave new world  
I'm waitin' for something new  
I can hear church bells ringing  
White rice hits blue skies  
And the blind still lead the blind  
As they look for paradise  
Oh yeah  
Paradise  
Welcome to paradise  
Here is my brave new world  
And here in my paradise  
I'm waiting for a special girl  
I'm still looking for paradise  
In your eyes you seem so far away  
And to find paradise  
There's no price that I won't pay  
(We all find paradise)  
I'm still looking for paradise tonight  
(We all find paradise)  
And I won't find paradise  
I'll make it all right  
(We all find paradise)  
With you and I  
Comes into sight  
(We all find paradise)  
For you and I  
For you and I  
Paradise could be right  
(We all find paradise)  
I'm still looking for paradise tonight  
(We all find paradise)  
And I won't find paradise  
I'll make it all right  
(We all find paradise)
