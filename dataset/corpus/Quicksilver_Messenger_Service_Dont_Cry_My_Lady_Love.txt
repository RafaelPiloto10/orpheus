Don't Cry My Lady Love by Quicksilver Messenger Service  
Don't cry, my sweet love  
You know how I can't stand you crying  
All right, my lady love  
I know you have heart, begin tryin'  
  
Some day in the morning  
When the sunshine won't shine in your window  
You may remember  
That I was the sun in your window  
  
But these things happen all the time  
They're always the same  
One's always crying  
And one's always easing the pain  
  
You say goodbye, my lady love  
I don't want the memories to haunt you  
Just look in my eyes, babe  
You can change my mind if you want to  
  
But some day that someone  
That you never cared for, will start again  
You may remember  
The one boy you won't share your heart with  
  
But these things happen  
And they're never right on time  
One's always leavin'  
And one's always changin' his mind  
  
Another time, another place  
You'll know that I'd really love you  
Dry your eyes, my funny face  
Another place, another world about you  
  
Don't you remember  
The way that you once tried to leave me  
And maybe some day  
You may know you really didn't need me  
  
But these things happen all the time  
They're always the same  
One's always crin'  
And one's always takin' the blame  
One's always crin'  
And one's always takin' the blame
