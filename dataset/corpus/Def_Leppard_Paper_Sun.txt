Does it hurt to remember  
Does it help to forget  
Do you know what you started  
When you lit the fuse of regret  
  
There's not a reason why you've come undone  
There's nothing left to justify, this can't go on  
There's nothing left inside as I walk this broken land  
  
Cause you're living on a paper sun  
Blind to all the damage done  
Living on a paper sun  
Waiting for the tide to turn  
Living on a paper sun  
You can't hide and you can't run  
All your dreams have come and gone  
Living on a paper sun  
  
Do you still hear 'em screamin'  
And does the fear make you run  
Is the anger inside of you  
A gift from father to son  
  
I don't believe in you, you've come undone  
I don't believe in what you do, this can't go on  
I don't believe in you as I walk this broken land  
  
Cause you're living on a paper sun  
Blind to all the damage done  
Living on a paper sun  
Waiting for the tide to turn  
Living on a paper sun  
You can't hide and you can't run  
All your dreams have come and gone  
Living on a paper  
  
You will discover the way to suffer  
And like no other you feed the fire  
  
There's not a reason why you've come undone  
There's nothing left to justify, this can't go on  
There's nothing left inside as I walk this broken land  
  
Cause you're living on a paper sun  
Blind to all the damage done  
Living on a paper sun  
Waiting for the tide to turn  
Living on a paper sun  
Waiting for the night  
All your dreams have come and gone
