Remix  
Uhuh uhuh (Rihanna)  
(Chris Brown)  
Uhuh uhuh (Good girl gone bad)  
Uhuh uhuh (Take three Action)  
Uhuh uhuh  
No clouds in my storms  
Let it rain, I hydroplane into fame (Eh eh)  
Come'n down with the Dow Jones  
When the clouds come we gone  
We Rokafella (Eh eh)  
We fly high to weather  
And she rocks it better  
You know me  
An anticipation for precipitation, stack chips for the rainy day (Eh eh)  
Jay, rain man is back with lil Ms. Sunshine  
Rihanna where you at?  
  
[Verse:]  
You have my heart, and we'll never be a world apart  
Maybe in magazines, but you'll still be my star  
Baby cause in the Dark, You can't see a shiny Car  
And that's when you need me there  
With you I'll always share  
Because  
  
[Chorus:]  
When the sun shines  
We'll shine together  
Told you I'll be here forever  
Said I'll always be your friend  
Took an oath Imma stick it out 'till the end  
Now that it's raining more than ever  
Know that we'll still have each other  
You can stand under my Umbrella  
You can stand under my Umbrella  
Ella ella eh eh eh  
Under my umbrella  
Ella ella eh eh eh  
Under my umbrella  
Ella ella eh eh eh  
Under my umbrella  
Ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh  
  
[Chris]  
You become another dream to me  
A fairytale fantasy  
Nothing can ever compare  
An image to my memory  
And girl I'm asking could you be my queen?  
A vision on a magazine  
That's when I'll be there  
It's something we both share  
Because  
When the sun shine well shine together  
You know I'll be here forever  
Although it's a not a rain outside  
Girl it's gettin late and you can stay the night  
But you can dip out anytime whenever  
I can call a car I aint tryna stress ya  
I'm looking for the one with the glass slippa'  
  
Baby girl you can be my Cinderella (ella ella eh eh eh)  
You can be my Cinderella (ella ella eh eh eh)  
You can be my Cinderella (ella ella eh eh eh)  
You can be my cinderella (ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh)  
  
You can run into my arms
