Could I have been  
A parking lot attendant  
Could I have been  
A millionaire in Bel Air  
Could I have been lost somewhere in Paris  
Could I have been  
Your little brother  
Could I have been  
Anyone other than me  
Could I have been  
Anyone other than me  
Could I have been  
Anyone other than me  
Could I have been  
Anyone  
  
He stands touch his hair his shoes untied  
Tongue gaping stare  
Could I have been a magnet for money?  
Could I have been anyone other than me?  
  
Twenty three and so tired of life  
Such a shame to throw it all away  
The images grow darker still  
Could I have been anyone other than me? Then I  
  
Look up at the sky  
My mouth is open wide, lick and taste  
What's the use in worrying, what's the use in hurrying  
Turn, turn we almost become dizzy  
  
I am who I am who I am who am I  
Requesting some enlightenment  
Could I have been anyone other than me?  
  
Sing and dance I'll play for you tonight  
And thrill at it all  
Dark clouds may hang on me sometimes  
But I'll work it out then I  
  
Look up at the sky  
My mouth is open wide, lick and taste  
What's the use in worrying, what's the use in hurrying  
Turn, turn we almost become dizzy  
  
Falling out of a world of lies  
Could I have been dancing Nancy  
Could I have been anyone other than me?
