Arriverderci, Roma  
Goodbye, goodbye to Rome  
  
City of a million moonlit faces  
City of a million warm embraces  
Where I found the one of all the faces  
Far from home  
  
Arriverderci, Roma  
It's time for us to part  
  
Save the wedding bells for my returnin'  
Keep my lover's arms outstretched and yearnin'  
Please be sure the flame of love keeps burnin'  
In her heart
