You're not sure what you want to do  
with your life  
but you sure don't want me in it  
Yeah you're sure the life you're  
living with me  
can't go on one single minute  
And there's a new one waiting  
outside this door  
and now's the time to begin it  
  
You found a new world and  
you want to taste it  
But that world can turn cold and  
you better face it  
  
Who will you run to when it all falls down  
Who's gonna pick you world up off the ground  
Who's gonna take away the tears you cry  
Who's gonna love you baby as good as I  
  
You won't know what it's like to live  
on your own  
You've always had me there beside you  
You think it's easy finding  
someone out there  
who's gonna care as much as I do  
What's gonna happen baby  
when you find out  
that there's no one there to cry to  
  
You can tell the whole world how you're  
gonna make it  
You can follow you heart but what ya do  
when someone breaks it  
  
Who will you run to when it all falls down  
Who's gonna pick you world up off the ground  
Who's gonna take away the tears you cry  
Who's gonna love you baby as good as I  
  
You found a new world and  
you want to taste it  
But that world can turn cold and  
you better face it  
  
Who will you run to when it all falls down  
Who's gonna pick you world up off the ground  
Who's gonna take away the tears you cry  
Who's gonna love you baby as good as I  
  
Who will you run to when it all falls down  
Who's gonna pick your world up off the ground  
Who's gonna take away the tears you cry  
Who's gonna love you baby as good as I
