[Verse:]:  
I don't care what they say about me  
It's alright, alright  
I don't care they think about me  
It's alright, they'll get it one day  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
I love you, I'll follow you  
You are my, my life  
I will read my bible and pray  
I will follow you all day  
  
[Verse 2:]:  
I don't care what it costs anymore  
Cos' you gave it all and I'm following you  
I don't care what it takes anymore  
No matter what happens I'm going your way  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
  
[Chorus:]:  
All Day  
All Day now  
All Day  
  
[Verse:]  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Bridge:]:  
Anyone around can see  
Just how good you've been to me  
For all my friends that don't know you  
I pray that you would save them too  
  
[Chorus:]
