3 Rings  
"Is this on?"  
"Gather round my wealthy friends  
And endure the horrifying sights  
Only your worst nightmares can produce  
Actual human beings of a deformed nature  
Come at once  
And come and enduldge yourself  
In our own twisted amusement of  
Another's misfortune  
Yes, ladies and gentlemen  
Enter our three ring show of freaks"  
[Violent J]  
Ring one, a dung a dung dung  
My name's Violent J and I staple my tongue  
To the desk in school then I run down the hall  
Scaring the shit out of all y'all bitches  
Which is why you don't invite mine to your parties  
Just cause I don't look like everybody  
I guess they're bunch of richboys, bitchboys  
Scary, bula!  
And what's the big deal about my neck  
Just because now and then I like to let it stretch  
Up a couple feet to get a better sight  
Is that any reason to scream and run in fright  
No, so, now how ya gonna act?  
So what if I got another arm growing out of my back  
I guess I'm just another freak show thing  
And now they got me in the three ri-ii-ii-ing  
[Chorus (2x)]  
Three ring a ding a ding ding  
People love to point and stare  
Three ring a ding a ding ding  
It's the same as everywhere  
[Shaggy 2 Dope]  
Ring two, how do you do?  
I'm Shaggy 2 Dope, chicken-faced bitch, who?  
You don't try to front ho  
Try to play me out just cause I'm running with the sideshow  
Or maybe it's the leg growing out my neck  
But don't jet baby, heh, not yet  
I'm popping in like a pound of lead  
Black n blue, his next roll and drop me on my head  
Oh shit, I knew I had to fuck up my circuits  
'cause when I was two my momma left me at the circus  
Abandoned at the carnival with the freak shows  
Like bad boys, hermaphrodites and old man crow  
But then I escaped to the ghetto zone  
Started a crew of my own, motherfucker, I'm not alone  
So don't be stickin your finger in my face stank  
Or your stomach might receive a shank from the...  
[Chorus (2x)]  
"I certainly hope your enjoy yourselves  
Here at our three ring exhibit  
But to be honest I really don't see  
What's so fucking funny about it  
These fucking people are real!"  
[Violent J]  
Ring three, the ICP  
Look if you want but I wouldn't lay a hand on me  
That's how you get fucked up  
We'll squeeze your windpipe shut  
Yo, I'm a nerd word, I drink from the bird  
Have Snake woman kick my love to the curb  
She busted into my tent, now I'm fucked  
Had the fat bearded lady in the buck, uh  
Fuck that, bitch, suck that  
I was born with a wang but I never had a nut sac  
Just two balls hanging with no protection so  
I move real careful and slow  
You can call me a weirdo, call me a freak  
Call me Don Knots 'cause I'm getting on it every week, uh  
So come see the carnival and threw me your change, bitch  
I chill with the three rings  
[Chorus(2x)]  
"Well, that's it  
I hope you're satisfied  
I hope you had a good time  
You fucking heartless bastards  
You saw what you wanted  
So grab your fucking kids  
And that fat flop of shit wife of yours  
And get the fuck out of our circus tent  
You cold-hearted sons of bitches  
You think they look fucked up  
Just wait till I kick your  
Fucking lips in a couple times  
You'll be sittin up here like a bitch  
And we'll laughing at your folded ass  
They'll call you lumpy  
After I done put knots  
All over your fuckin forehead  
Yeah, hey, hey little boy, come here  
How'd you like it if I tied your neck in a knot  
You fucking little bitch  
Come here, I'll shove that  
Fucking corn dog up your ass  
Get the fuck out of here  
Show's fucking over  
Get the fuck out of here  
You fucking heartless bastards"
