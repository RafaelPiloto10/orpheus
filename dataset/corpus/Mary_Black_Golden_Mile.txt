Walkin' along golden mile with a soldier's twirl  
I must be the luckiest soul in the whole wide world  
Oh foolish thing, here I go again  
  
There's no faith more innocent than blind faith, and that's all I've got  
So I'm scaling the walls of my dreams, ready or not  
Oh foolish thing, here I go again  
  
Don't be afraid, darling,  
No need to be afraid, darling  
You don't have to be afraid from now on  
It's just the way, darling,  
We get delayed, darling  
But we won't be delayed from now on  
  
I know no power on earth nor up above  
That would alter the way things are, you are my love  
Yes, you're my pride and joy on the golden mile  
  
If only it could be captured  
how I feel for you  
And if I could just freeze it, I feel I'd never be untrue  
Oh foolish thing, here I go  
Here I go again  
  
Don't be afraid, darling,  
No need to be afraid, darling  
You don't have to be afraid from now on  
It's just the way, darling,  
We get delayed, darling  
But we won't be delayed from now on  
  
I know no power on earth nor up above  
That would alter the way things are, you are my love  
You're my pride and joy, my pride and joy  
Yes, you're my pride and joy on the golden mile  
  
Walkin' along golden mile with a soldier's twirl
