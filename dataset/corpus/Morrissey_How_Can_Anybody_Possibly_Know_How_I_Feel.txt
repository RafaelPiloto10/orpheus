She told me she loved me  
Which means  
She must be insane  
I've had my face dragged in  
Fifteen miles of shit  
And I do not and I do not  
And I do not like it  
So how can anybody say  
They know how I feel?  
The only one around here who is me  
Is me  
  
They said they respect me  
Which means  
Their judgment is crazy  
I've had my face dragged in  
Fifteen miles of shit  
And I do not and I do not  
And I do not like it  
So how can anybody say  
They know how I feel?  
When they are they  
And only I am I  
  
He said he wants to befriend me  
Which means  
He can't possibly know me  
The voices of the real  
And the imagined cry:  
"The future is passing you by  
The future is passing you by"  
So how can anybody possibly think they  
Know how I feel?  
Everybody look and see pain and walk away  
And as for you in your uniform (we told you)  
Your smelly uniform (we told you)  
And so you think you can be rude to me  
Because you wear a uniform (we told you)  
A smelly uniform (we told you)  
And so you think you can be rude to me  
But even I as sick as I am  
I would never be you  
Even I as sick as I am  
I would never be you  
Even I sick and depraved  
A traveler to the grave  
I would never be you  
I would never be you
