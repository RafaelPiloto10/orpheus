Come wit it now!  
Come wit it now!  
  
The microphone explodes, shattering the molds  
Either drop tha hits like de la O or get tha fuck off tha commode  
Wit tha sure shot, sure ta make tha bodies drop  
Drop an don't copy yo, don't call this a co-op  
Terror rains drenchin', quenchin' tha thirst of tha power dons  
That five sided fist-a-gon  
Tha rotten sore on tha face of mother earth gets bigger  
Tha triggers cold empty ya purse  
  
Rally round tha family! With a pocket full of shells  
They rally round tha family! With a pocket full of shells  
They rally round tha family! With a pocket full of shells  
They rally round tha family! With a pocket full of shells  
  
Weapons not food, not homes, not shoes  
Not need, just feed the war cannibal animal  
I walk tha corner to tha rubble that used to be a library  
Line up to tha mind cemetery now  
What we don't know keeps tha contracts alive an movin'  
They don't gotta burn tha books they just remove 'em  
While arms warehouses fill as quick as tha cells  
Rally round tha family, pockets full of shells  
  
Rally round tha family! With a pocket full of shells  
They rally round tha family! With a pocket full of shells  
They rally round tha family! With a pocket full of shells  
They rally round tha family! With a pocket full of shells  
  
Bulls on parade  
  
Come wit it now!  
Come wit it now!  
Bulls on parade!  
Bulls on parade!  
Bulls on parade!  
Bulls on parade!  
Bulls on parade!
