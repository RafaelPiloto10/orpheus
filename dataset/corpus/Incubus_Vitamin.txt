I'm born  
I'm alive  
I breathe  
In a moment or two I realize,  
That the sphere upon which I reside,  
Is asleep on its feet.  
Should I go back to sleep?  
We orbit the sun  
I grow up  
My open eyes see  
  
A zombified, somnambulist society.  
Leaving us as vitamins  
For the hibernating human animal.  
Do you see what I mean?  
You stare at me like a vitamin  
On the surface you hate,  
But you know you need me.  
  
I'll come dressed as any pill you deem fit.  
Whatever helps you swallow truth  
All the more easily.  
  
And I wonder, will you digest me?  
Into the sleep machine I won't plug in,  
In fact I'd rather die before I will comply.  
To you, my friend,  
I write the reason I still live,  
'cause in my mind it's set the vitamin is ripe to give  
Coming closer to another 2000 years  
You and I will pry  
The closed eye of the sleep machine
