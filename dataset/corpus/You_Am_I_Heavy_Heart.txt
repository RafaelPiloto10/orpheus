Been watching so much TV  
I'm thinner than I should be  
I'm like a waterlogged ball  
That no-one wants to kick around anymore  
An all day morning hair-do  
That no comb can get through  
It's all granola and beer  
A calling card and a silk cut souvenir  
I miss you like sleep  
And there's nothing romantic about the hours I keep  
The morning's when it starts  
I don't look so sharp  
Now I got a heavy heart  
  
I talk a lot about football  
And girls I kissed in grade four  
I piss off my friends  
I'm digging a hole just staring at the floor  
Now every t-shirt's got a wine stain  
I'm loving cigarettes again  
I know every tune about guys and girls  
And hurts and hearts and moans  
  
I miss you like sleep  
And there's nothing romantic about the hours I keep  
The morning's when it starts  
I don't look so good  
Now I've got a heavy heart  
  
It's just a low rent paying, palpitating pulp inside my shirt  
But there's a weight that's sitting  
So hard oh God it hurts  
Oh God it hurts  
  
Been watching so much TV  
I'm thinner than I should be  
I'm like a waterlogged ball  
That no-one wants to kick around anymore  
  
I miss you like sleep  
And there's nothing romantic about the hours I keep  
The morning when it starts  
Oh my heavy heart
