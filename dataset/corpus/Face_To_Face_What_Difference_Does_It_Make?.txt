All men have secrets and here is mine  
So let it be known  
We have been through hell and high tide, I can surely rely on you?  
And yet you start to recoil, heavy words are so lightly thrown  
But still I'd leap in front of a flying bullet for you  
  
So, what difference does it make?  
So, what difference does it make?  
  
It makes none but you have gone  
And you must be looking very old tonight  
The devil will find work for idle hands to do  
I stole and I lied, and why? because you asked me to!  
But now you make feel so ashamed because I've only got two hands well,  
I'm still fond of you  
  
So, what difference does it make?  
It makes none but you have gone and your prejudice won't keep you warm tonight  
The devil will find work for idle hands to do  
I stole and I lied, and why? just because you asked me to!  
But you know the truth about me you won't see me anymore,  
I'm still fond of you  
  
So, no more apologies no more apologies I'm too tired  
I'm too sick and tired and I'm feeling very sick and ill today  
But I'm still fond of you
