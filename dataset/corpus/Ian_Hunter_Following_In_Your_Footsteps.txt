Some folk leave you courage  
Some folk leave you hope  
Why am I out here hangin'  
Like a fool on the end of my rope?  
Some folk leave you wisdom  
Some folk throw you signs  
You can never be sure what went on before  
Life is just a matter of time  
Pictures of you, clouding my view  
I'm following in your footsteps  
Tryin' to make some sense of it all  
Maybe it's a sign of weakness  
But that's where my footsteps fall  
I'm following in your footsteps  
Tryin' to hold on to your dreams  
You never got what you wanted  
So I never got what I need  
I'm following in your footsteps  
'cause that's where your footsteps lead  
Someone must have left me anger  
Someone must have given me hate  
Or why would I stand here shakin'  
When there's so many chances to take?  
Pictures of you, climb into view  
I'm following in your footsteps  
Tryin' to make some sense of it all  
Well, maybe it's a sign of weakness  
But that's where my footsteps fall  
I'm following in your footsteps  
Watchin' my children grow  
They'll be following in my footsteps  
Takin' it down the road  
We're following in your footsteps  
'cause that's where your footsteps go  
We're following in your footsteps  
Takin' it down the road  
We're following in your footsteps, yeah  
'cause that's where your footsteps go
