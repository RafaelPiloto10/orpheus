Well I'm fallin' just about as far as I'm gonna fall  
Well I've never been this slow before that I recall  
And I'm gettin' tired of people picking on me  
And I ain't a goin' down from here wait and see  
There's gonna be a new dawn and a new day  
From this moment on things are gonna break my way  
I'm gonna wear a new smile and a new face  
And then I'm goin' out and get back in the race  
  
Well the people been a walkin' on me way too long  
And the way I gotta figure I've been doin' it wrong  
So from now on I'm a gonna look out from me  
I'm gonna do what I want to be what I want to be  
There's gonna be a new dawn
