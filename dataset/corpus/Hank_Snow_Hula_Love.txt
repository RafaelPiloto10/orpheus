On the isle of Filla Lilla out Hawaii way  
A hula maiden gay strolled by on moonlit bay  
There came to court her over the water from a savage Zinga Zululand  
A bolo chief-tain grand sang her this lay  
And he sang hula Hawaii hula smile on your zing gang a zula  
Moonshine above on our sweet jungle love  
For you my bolo is swinging for you my love song I'm singing  
Come be my hula hula love  
[ steel ]  
But the chief-tain from the peaceful Filla Lilla land  
Would not give him her hand her love took his stand  
Through the rattle of the battle as she heard his sweet voice calm and true  
They fled in his canoe o'er waters blue  
And he sang hula...  
And he sang hula...  
Hula love hula love hula love
