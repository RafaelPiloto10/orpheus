The night turns to dawn  
You're there by my side  
You showed your love  
Baby, that's all  
Baby, that's all  
You're all that I want  
For my love you were made  
Please say to me  
"Baby, you're all, all that I want"  
Say you love me come on home now  
Tell me that you're mine  
Keep me for your own now  
And I will love you all the time  
Ahh-ah-ah-ahh  
  
Baby, that's all  
Baby, that's all  
Say you love me come on home now  
Tell me that you're mine  
Keep me for your own now  
And I will love you all the time  
Ahh-ah-ah-ahh  
The night turns to dawn  
You're there by my side  
You showed your love  
Baby, that's all
