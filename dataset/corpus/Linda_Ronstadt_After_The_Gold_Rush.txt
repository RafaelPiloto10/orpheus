Well I dreamed I saw the knights in armor coming  
Sayin' something about a queen  
There were peasants singing and drummers drumming  
And the archer split the tree  
  
There was a fanfare blowing to the sun  
There was floating on the breeze  
  
Look at Mother Nature on the run  
In the twentieth century  
Look at Mother Nature on the run  
In the twentieth century  
  
I was lying in a burned out basement  
With the full moon in my eyes  
I was hoping for replacement  
When the sun burst through the sky  
  
There was a band playing in my head  
And I felt like I could cry  
  
I was thinking about what a friend had said  
I was hoping it was a lie  
Thinking about what a friend had said  
I was hoping it was a lie  
  
I dreamed I saw the silver spaceships flying  
In the yellow haze of the sun  
There were children crying and colors flying  
All around the chosen ones  
  
All in a dream, all in a dream  
The loading had begun  
  
Flying Mother Nature's silver seed  
To a new home in the sun  
Flying Mother Nature's silver seed  
To a new home
