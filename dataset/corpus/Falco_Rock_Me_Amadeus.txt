Ooh rock me Amadeus  
Rock me Amadeus  
Rock rock rock rock me Amadeus  
Rock me all the time to the top  
  
He was a punker  
And he lived in the big city  
It was Vienna, was Vienna  
Where he did everything  
He had debts, for he drank  
But all the women loved him  
And each one shouted:  
Come on and rock me Amadeus  
  
[Chorus:]  
Amadeus Amadeus, Amadeus  
Amadeus Amadeus, Amadeus  
Amadeus Amadeus, oh oh oh Amadeus  
  
He was a superstar  
He was popular  
He was so exalted  
Because he had flair  
He was a virtuoso  
Was a rock idol  
And everyone shouted:  
Come on and rock me Amadeus  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Come on and rock me Amadeus  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It was around 1780  
And it was in Vienna  
No plastic money anymore  
The banks against him  
From which his debts came  
It was common knowledge  
He was a woman's man  
Women loved his punk  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Come and rock me Amadeus  
  
Baby baby do it to me rock me  
Baby baby do it to me rock me  
Baby baby do it to me rock me  
Yes yes yes  
Baby baby do it to me rock me  
Baby baby do it to me rock me  
Baby baby do it to me rock me  
  
[Chorus]
