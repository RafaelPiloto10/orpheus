It's been a long, long time since I lost myself.  
Put my pride down on the table, put my fear on the shelf.  
So I bought myself a throne to reside and let myself go.  
But I've traveled much too far, where I've gone, I'll never know.  
  
What a long, long time...  
Long, long time.  
It's been a little old while since I felt so fine.  
Wanderin' in the rain...  
  
Losing my mind.  
What a long, long time.  
What a long, long time.  
My days I've spet relaxin' turned to nights relaxin' too  
  
A thousand eyes upon me, but my sights are missing you.  
So this time I swear I will loosen my grip.  
On past times and bad lines and meaningless trips.  
What a long, long time.  
  
Long, long time.  
It's been a little old while since I felt so fine.  
Wanderin' in the rain,  
Losing my mind.  
  
What a long, long time.  
What a long, long time.  
So, over and over mile signs pass by my side  
The more you try to find yourself, the more you tend to hide  
  
Behind these - forest trees - and greens that blind your eyes  
To lounge upon that throne I bought,  
Confer there with the wise.  
What a long, long time.  
  
Long, long time.  
It's been a little old while since I felt so fine.  
Wanderin' in the rain,  
Losing my mind.  
  
What a long, long time,  
Long time...yeah.  
So here we appear, the rest lost themselves in a pit of fear.  
For who? What can I do? But let them all come through the wall  
  
And though some oppose, many of these things I know,  
I'll stay here alone, and lose myself on the riverways of days.  
I'm coming home.  
What a long, long time.  
  
Long, long time.  
It's been a little old while since I felt so fine.  
Wanderin' in the rain,  
Losing my mind  
  
What a long, long time.  
What a long, long time.
