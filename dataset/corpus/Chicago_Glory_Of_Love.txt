Tonight it's very clear  
As we're both lying here  
There's so many things I wanna say  
I will always love you  
I would never leave you alone  
Sometimes I just forget  
Say things I might regret  
It breaks my heart to see you cryin'  
I don't wanna lose you  
I could never make you be alone  
I am the man who would fight for your honor  
I'll be the hero you're dreamin' of  
We'll live forever  
Knowing together that we  
Did it all for the glory of love  
You keep me standing tall  
You helped me through it all  
I'm always strong when you're beside me  
I have always needed you  
I could never make you be alone  
I am the man who will fight for your honor  
I'll be the hero you been dreamin' of  
We'll live forever  
Knowing together that we  
Did it all for the glory of love  
Like a knight in shining armor  
From a long time ago  
Just the time I'd save the day  
Take you to my castle far away  
I am the man who would fight for your honor  
I'll be the hero that you're dreamin' of  
Gonna live forever  
Knowing together that we  
Did it all for the Glory of Love  
We'll live forever  
Knowing together that we  
Did it all for the Glory of Love  
We did it all for love
