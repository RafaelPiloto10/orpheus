Ah, okay!  
The hills are alive  
And it's pretty frightening  
The sun goes down  
  
The moon comes out  
The people gather 'round and we all begin to shout  
Ech... mud!  
You better not cry  
  
You better not shout  
You better not pout  
I'm telling you why  
Santa claus is dead  
  
There's a song I must sing,  
It's a well known song,  
But the tune is bitter  
And it doesn't take long to learn, I can learn!  
That pretty little world that beams so bright  
That pretty little world that seems delightful cambered  
Let me learn...let me learn...  
  
For I can see it, shining somewhere  
Bright lights somewhere invite me to compare and learn  
And I'm ready, I can hear it silent singing  
Inside my ear, I hear them all singing of love!  
  
Who knows maybe all the visions that I see  
May be waiting just for me to say  
Take me there and make me see it, make me feel it  
I know it so, I know that it really may be...  
Let me learn!
