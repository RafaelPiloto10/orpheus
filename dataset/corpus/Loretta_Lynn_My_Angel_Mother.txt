I'm writing this song about a girl that I know  
She's just as pure as the powdery snow.  
I might search this world over, but I'd never find  
No one to take the place of this mother of mine.  
  
Mother. That's the sweetest name of them all.  
You're an angel on earth and to me you are worth  
More than anything else in the world.  
  
I love you more day by day - and I could never repay  
All the things that you've done for me.  
Your heart is filled with joyous times  
And your eyes - how they shine.  
That's the story of this mother of mine.  
  
Mother, you will never, not ever grow old.  
You're an angel on earth and to me you are worth  
More than mountains of silver and gold.  
  
Mother...
