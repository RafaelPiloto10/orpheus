From the first hello you gave to me I've done nothing else but smile  
And I know you're in a hurry, but it's gonna take a while  
So forgive me if we go slow, but there's something I think you should know  
  
I'm going fast as I can, please don't make me rush  
This feeling's coming on way too fast  
I'll tell you all of the things that you'll never forget  
But I'm not ready say, "I love you" yet  
I'm not ready to say "I love you" yet  
  
Don't push me in too deep, I've always been the fool who rushes in  
You've got to take the pieces one by one before you've got everything  
So forgive me if we go slow but there's something I think you should know  
  
There'll be times when I'm mistaken, there'll be times when we're gonna fight  
But you needn't doubt we can work it out and in time we'll get it right  
So forgive me if we go slow but there's something I think you should know  
  
From the first hello
