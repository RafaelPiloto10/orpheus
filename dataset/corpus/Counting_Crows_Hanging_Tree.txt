She brings her friends so we wont have to be alone  
Fear I might lose my composure without warning  
I am a child of fire I am a lion I have desires  
And I was born inside the sun this morning  
  
[Chorus]  
This dizzy life of mine keeps hanging me up all the time  
This dizzy life is just a hanging tree  
This dizzy life of mine keeps hanging me up all the time  
This dizzy life is just a hanging tree  
  
They say good evening when they don't know what to say  
They say good morning when they wish you would go home  
  
You open windows and you wait for someone warm to come inside and then freeze
to death alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She calls a waitress when its time for her to go  
And I know everyone is eventually leaving  
I got a pair of wings for my birthday baby and I will fall down through the
sun to see you mine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
For me, for me, for me [Repeated]  
  
This dizzy life is just a hanging tree  
This dizzy life is just a hanging tree for me  
  
This dizzy life is just a hanging tree for me  
For me, for me, for me [Repeated]  
  
This dizzy life is just a hanging tree for me
