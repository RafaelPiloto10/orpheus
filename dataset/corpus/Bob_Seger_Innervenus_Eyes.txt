Innervenus eye, the fool performs the sky  
Innervenus eye, cause every little heartache whines  
Lord, she looked, she looked, she looked so good  
She looked, she looked, she looked so good  
  
Innervenus blue, the fools are not so few  
Innervenus blue, corporations ran first too  
She looked, she looked at me,  
She looked at me so good  
  
Looked so good, looked so good to me yeah  
Cause you see, I'm free  
Well I'm swimmin' in a sea, Ohhh  
  
She makes her story short for double standard listeners  
Deep inside of me, she knows  
The mirror of her heart is sort of like her sister  
And aviating rhyme and role  
  
Innervenus chain  
Pills won't ease the pain  
Innervenus brain  
Cause the universe is sane  
  
Oh but she looked so good, looked so good to me  
She's all alone, she's on her own  
The wind has blown the heart has grown
