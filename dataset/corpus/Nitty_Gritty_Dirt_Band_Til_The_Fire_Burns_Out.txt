There's a home fire in your eyes that's burns me gently  
There's a warmth that I've never known before  
In your arms I hear a whisper of forever  
This is all I ask and nothing more  
  
When the nights are turning cold  
If the fire is burning low  
Say that you won't go  
Til the fire's burned out  
Don't let the fire burn out  
  
Baby hold me now like there's no tomorrow  
The fire's lit, the flame is burning true  
I know we could swim the sea of sorrow  
As long as there's one spark to see us through  
  
So when the nights are turning cold  
If the fire is burning low  
Say that you won't go  
Til the fire's burned out  
Don't let the fire burn out  
Don't let the fire burn out  
  
So many empty nights  
So many broken dreams  
Too many lovers lost  
In the lonely crowd  
  
So when the nights are turning cold  
If the fire is burning low  
Say that you won't go  
Promise you won't go  
Say that you won't go  
Til the fire's burned out  
Don't let the fire burn out  
Don't let the fire burn out  
Don't let the fire burn out  
Oh let it burn  
Let it burn, let it burn  
Don't let the fire burn out  
Oh let it burn  
Don't let the fire burn out  
Let it burn, let it burn  
Don't let the fire burn out
