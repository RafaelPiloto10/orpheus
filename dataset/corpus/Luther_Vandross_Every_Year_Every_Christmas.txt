I don't know how love could do this to me  
I've waited and waited for someone I never see  
But I'm so sentimental, and I'm so hopeful you'll be there  
So, here I am every year, every Christmas  
  
I've wished for you in my heart and in my head  
And I got my answer that first moment that we met  
And, oh yes, I believed you as you told me, as you said  
You'd be here every year, every Christmas  
  
There must be a lesson for me to learn  
If you don't trust in love, you'll get nothing in return  
Why should I be lonely, don't tell me it's right  
I have my pride, but I'd rather be with you tonight  
  
So much emotion, it's driving me mad  
But I'll take my chances with these feelings that I have  
And I'll come back to this same corner where we met  
And I'll be here every year, every Christmas  
  
Mere words can't explain the pain and the fear  
'Cause oh, I wonder, yes, I wonder are you gonna leave me standing here  
Today's almost over, but I don't want to leave  
Has my heart made a fool out of me?  
  
My friends gather round me with holiday cheer  
They say to forget you, to let you go 'cause you're not here  
Well, I can't keep explaining what they'll never understand  
And why I'm here every year, every Christmas  
I return every year, every Christmas  
I come here every year, every Christmas
