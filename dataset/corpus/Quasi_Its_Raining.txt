It's raining, It's raining.  
  
There is nothing you can do  
It doesn't only rain on you  
But you're acting all upset like you're the only one who is wet.  
  
It's raining, It's raining.  
  
There is nothing we can do  
Its raining on me too  
You moan and you cry  
But it won't effect the sky.  
  
You're not a saint  
You're not a savior  
Or a devil  
Its agreed  
Oh lucky you oh lucky me  
We have more of those than we need.  
  
And when you give me gifts and money  
I'm a swine before the pearl  
It only serves to remind me that we are all alone in this world.  
  
It's raining, It's raining,  
  
And I can't tell you when the storm is gonna end  
So go ahead and cry but that won't keep you dry.
