People talk about the way I dance, dance, dance  
They think it's funny when I lift my hands, hands, hands  
All the things I've been going through  
I'm telling you if you only knew  
  
This joy is real something you can feel  
All my heartbreaks and my heartaches  
Though I couldn't take, You were there  
Holding me and molding me reminding me that You care  
  
You're on time, never coming at the wrong time  
Always there that's a long time  
I'm not ashamed can't help  
But wanna praise Your name  
  
No matter what the people may say  
You can praise Him anyway  
You may have to cry sometimes  
But I promise you'll be alright  
  
My brotha if you just hold on  
All this pain it'll soon be gone  
Can't nobody, nobody  
Nobody do me like You do me, nobody, nobody  
  
Tia doro Jese  
(I worship You Jesus)  
  
Can't nobody love me like You  
(Like You)  
Give me joy like the way You do  
(You do)  
  
When I'm alone and my faith's gone  
I heard be strong, I knew it was You  
A spiritual love affair  
Knows how much I can bear  
Can't nobody, nobody, nobody  
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody  
  
No matter what the people may say  
You can praise Him anyway  
You may have to cry sometimes  
But I promise you'll be alright  
  
My brotha if you just hold on  
All this pain it'll soon be gone  
Can't nobody, nobody  
Nobody do me like You do me, nobody, nobody  
  
No matter what the people may say  
You can praise Him anyway  
You may have to cry sometimes  
But I promise you'll be alright  
  
My brotha if you just hold on  
All this pain it'll soon be gone  
Can't nobody, nobody  
Nobody do me like You do me, nobody, nobody  
  
Pienso en ti  
When I think of You Father  
Why mi corazon se llena de elegria  
My heart is filled with joy  
No se pueden medir tus bendiciones  
You have blessed me beyond measure  
  
Nobody no, nobody no, nobody no, no  
Nobody no, nobody no, nobody no, no  
Nobody no, nobody no, nobody no, no  
  
Rap, what the deal now  
Holy spirit you can feel now  
Cats want to keep it real now  
But love is spiritual  
  
I'm giving you knowledge  
Because it's critical and lyrical  
You know I'm on your heels now  
I won't stop I can't stop  
  
'Cause you know His grace and mercy  
It'll never drop who flop? Not me  
To Metropolis ain't no stoppin' this  
Ain't no poppin' this  
And all my ghetto children who be rockin' this
