I just can't get it through my head you love another now instead  
Can't make myself believe we're really through  
I'm walkin' up and down the hall talkin' to the silent wall  
I'll lose my mind before I'm over you  
I think I've almost lost my mind I think about you all the time  
I'm goin' crazy yes I know and I don't have far to go  
The way you treat me is a shame but I'll keep lovin' you the same  
I'll lose my mind before I'm over you  
[ guitar - piano ]  
I keep your letters I should burn I wear your ring I should return  
But there's a million foolish things I do  
It makes me cry but you would laugh to know I kiss your photograph  
I'll lose my mind before I'm over you  
I think I've almost lost my mind...
