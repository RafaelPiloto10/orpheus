We burn out in the dark  
We are invisible stars  
We are a question mark  
Be careful what you ask for  
  
We are broken bet  
We never had a chance  
We want what we don't have  
Be careful what you ask for  
  
We will never die  
Put your hope in the sky  
To burn a perfect light,  
Be careful what you ask for  
  
I'm sorry we are living in the car  
This isn't what you wanted  
When you gave me your heart  
I'm sorry I got lazy in need  
This isn't what you wanted  
When you married me  
  
Life looks better when you waste the day away  
Life looks better when you make it all again  
Life looks better when you drink away the pain  
Life looks better when you look away  
  
We burn out in the dark  
We are invisible stars  
We are a question mark  
Be careful what you ask for  
  
We are broken bet  
We never had a chance  
We want what we don't have  
Be careful what you ask for  
  
I know you get mad at me  
When your card gets denied  
At the market down the street  
I know that you wanna leave  
Yeah this isn't what you wanted  
When you married me  
  
Life looks better when you waste the day away  
Life looks better when you make it all again  
Life looks better when you drink away the pain  
Life looks better when you look away  
  
We burn out in the dark  
We are invisible stars  
We are a question mark  
Be careful what you ask for  
  
We are broken bet  
We never had a chance  
We want what we don't have  
Be careful what you ask for  
  
You wanna believe  
The world can be perfect  
That anyone can be redeemed  
The getter's always better than bad  
That's where it all goes bad  
Just when you think  
That everything is gonna be alright  
That's where it all goes bad  
Just when you think  
That everything is gonna be alright  
That's where it all goes bad  
  
We burn out in the dark  
We are invisible stars  
We are a question mark  
Be careful what you ask for  
No guess who's around  
Be careful what you ask for  
This isn't what I asked for  
Be careful what you ask for  
This isn't what I wanted to see  
Be careful what you ask for  
This isn't what I asked for  
Be careful what you ask for  
  
Life looks better  
When you look the other way  
Baby look away  
Baby, do yourself a favor  
Look the other way
