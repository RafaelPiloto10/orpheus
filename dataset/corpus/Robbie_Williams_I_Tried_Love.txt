Is the Richard Gere Gerbil story true  
Who came third in World War 2  
Did Sooty sleep with Sue,  
These things I think about,  
When I'm with out with you...  
What are the holes in biro's for  
Which one's which in the Corrs  
Did Geff Hurst really score,  
Coz frankly your a bore,  
And I'm not...  
And if it's leavin' season your second on the bill  
If you wont leave me baby i'll find someone who will,  
I tried love, I'm sorry  
I tried love...  
Does God ever get it wrong  
Where has Gary Barlow gone  
Why is Christmas Day so long  
It just goes on and on... And on,  
Like you,  
And if it's leavin' season your the second on the bill  
If you wont leave me baby i'll find someone who will,  
I tried love, I'm sorry  
I tried love...  
Do duh duh duh duh duh duh,  
Duh duh, duh duh...  
Do duh duh duh duh duh duh,  
Duh duh, duh duh,  
I tried love, I'm sorry  
I tried love...  
Why is there ketchup on my sleeve  
Do you think Adam fancied Eve  
What if Eve could not conceve  
And he had to breed with Steve,  
We'd all be gay....  
(Laughs......)
