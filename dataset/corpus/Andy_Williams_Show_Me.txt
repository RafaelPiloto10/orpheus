Don't talk of stars burning above  
If you're in love show me  
Tell me no dreams filled with desire  
If you're on fire show me  
Here we are together in the middle of the night  
Don't talk of spring, just hold me tight  
Anyone whose ever been in love will tell you that  
This is no time for a chat  
  
Haven't your lips longed for my touch  
  
Don't say how much, show me, show me  
Don't talk of love lasting through time  
Make me no undying vow  
Show me show me  
  
Haven't your lips longed for my touch  
Don't say how much, show me, show me  
Don't talk of love lasting through time  
Make me no undying vow  
Show me show me now
