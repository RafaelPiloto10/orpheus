[Repeat: x10]  
Your messiah was never mine  
  
Hypocrites!  
Weeping rows of Jeremiah  
Drops of blood drip off your medals  
Representing all our tears  
in a ring of burning metal  
  
How you wanna be, what you gonna say  
it doesn't bother me, who ya gonna pay  
  
?  
To define the what and why  
People travel across this earth  
Over water, land, and sky  
  
How you wanna be, what you gonna say  
it doesn't bother me, who ya gonna pay  
  
Pay the ferryman, pay the fucking driver  
Pay the preachers and pay the fucking liars  
?  
I'm not gonna pay it's already mine  
Hypocrites  
I'm gonna do it blind  
Hypocrites  
I'm gonna do it blind  
Hypocrites  
I'm gonna do it blind  
Hypocrites  
Your messiah was never mine  
Weeping rows of Jeremiah  
Purity unlike no other  
Offers help to those who need it  
Don't forget care to the brother  
  
How you wanna be, what you gonna say it  
Doesn't bother me, who ya gonna pay  
Little lady at home  
Writing out a check to send  
It's all the money that she owns  
She believes the world might end  
  
How you wanna be, what you gonna say it  
Doesn't bother me, who ya gonna pay  
  
Pay the ferryman, pay the fucking driver  
Pay the preachers and pay the fucking liars  
?  
I'm not gonna pay it's already mine  
  
Hypocrites  
I'm gonna do it blind  
Hypocrites  
I'm gonna do it blind  
Hypocrites  
I'm gonna do it blind  
Hypocrites  
Your messiah was never mine  
  
Hypocrites!  
  
Pay the ferryman, pay the fucking driver  
Pay the preachers and pay the fucking liars  
?  
I'm not gonna pay it's already mine  
  
Hypocrites!  
Hypocrites!  
Hypocrites!  
Hypocrites!
