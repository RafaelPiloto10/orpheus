Well, music, sweet music  
Lord, is gonna be played, mm-hmm  
And the sound of Billy's banjo  
Is like honey on your day  
When they promenade down through the square  
They'll hear you say  
I'm comin' your way  
And I'm only just a growin'  
A little each day  
The sun of the delta  
Beams across your face, oh yeah  
And good old Grand-dad's stories  
Seem to set your pace  
All the men you've known in this town  
Don't seem to have it  
And they bring you down  
Well, remember you're just growin'  
A little each day  
  
So throw out your arms and take in the sky  
Take down your hair and watch the birds fly  
Don't be afraid to show how you feel  
Don't sit and hide, don't you know that you're real  
You can have it if you want it  
Change yourself and play  
Cause you're only, only just growin'  
A little each day  
  
So woman, sweet woman  
Why you feel that way  
don't you know you're only growin'  
Just a little each day  
When the good Lord placed you on this earth  
His good words to heed  
It's all that you need  
And you're only just growin'  
A little each day  
  
Oh, you're only just growin'  
A little each day  
Oh, sweet woman, you're only just growin'  
A little each day
