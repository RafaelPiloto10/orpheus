[Verse 1]  
It would take all day to tell you how I need you it was hard but now I'm
learning how to trust you and to know you more than just my friend cuz
friendships sometimes end  
  
[Verse 2]  
It would take all day to show you how I miss you when my own desires they
still my heart from you and hurt you but still you say there's room that you
want me close to you it's amazing  
  
[Bridge]  
So incredible to me how you look past where I am and see where I will be
though millions call your name you still make time for me that's incredible to
me (x2)  
  
[Verse 3]  
It would take all day to tell you how I thank you for all those times in my
life you've come through I appreciate you no goodness of my own how you forget
my wrong it's amazing  
  
[Chorus]  
So incredible to me how to look past where I am and see where I will be though
millions call your name you still make time for me that's incredible to me  
So incredible to me how birds that fly will testify you will supply my needs
although my life will change your promises you keep that's incredible to me
(me) to me (me) to me (me) to me (me)  
  
[Verse 4]  
If it takes all day to tell you I love you this heart that beats each fragile
piece I give you it's for you before I knew my name our love was prearranged
It's amazing  
  
[Chorus]  
So incredible to me how to look past where I am and see where I will be
thought millions call your name you still make time for me that's incredible
to me  
So incredible to me how birds that fly will testify you will supply my needs
although my life will change your promises you keep that's incredible to me
(x3)
