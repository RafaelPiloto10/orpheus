Buckets of rain  
Buckets of tears  
Got all them buckets comin' out of my ears.  
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,  
I got all the love, honey baby,  
You can stand.  
  
I been meek  
And hard like an oak  
I seen pretty people disappear like smoke.  
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear,  
If you want me, honey baby,  
I'll be here.  
  
Like your smile  
And your fingertips  
Like the way that you move your lips.  
I like the cool way you look at me,  
Everything about you is bringing me  
Misery.  
  
Little red wagon  
Little red bike  
I ain't no monkey but I know what I like.  
I like the way you love me strong and slow,  
I'm takin' you with me, honey baby,  
When I go.  
  
Life is sad  
Life is a bust  
All ya can do is do what you must.  
You do what you must do and ya do it well,  
I'll do it for you, honey baby,  
Can't you tell?
