Isn't it like me  
To want to say  
Things I can't explain ...  
In simple ways?  
  
Why should I be sane?  
Why can't I be crazy?  
  
Sometimes I'm up,  
Sometimes I'm down,  
I choke on words,  
And make no sound.  
Sometimes  
  
Sometimes I'm weak  
Sometimes I'm strong  
Living with the fear I don't belong  
Sometimes  
  
Why is it so hard  
To know myself?  
Underneath this skin you'll find  
Someone else.  
  
Don't be so surprised  
When you look inside me  
Inside me  
  
Sometimes It's black  
Sometimes It's white  
You hide behind electric light  
Sometimes  
  
Sometimes I swear  
Sometimes I pray  
Suddenly the guilty disobey  
Sometimes  
  
Sometimes I'm weak  
Sometimes I'm strong  
Living with the fear I don't belong  
Sometimes  
  
Sometimes I stand  
Sometimes I fall  
I throw myself against the wall  
Sometimes  
  
Sometimes I sink  
Sometimes I swim  
Tell me why my world is caving in  
Sometimes  
  
Sometimes it's sweet  
Sometimes it's raw  
Trying to get so high like I did before  
Sometimes  
  
Sometimes in love  
Sometimes in hate  
Sometimes it's all a big mistake
