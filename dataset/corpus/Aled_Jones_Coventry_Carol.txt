Lully, lulla, thou little tiny child  
By by, lully lullay  
  
O sisters too  
How may we do  
For to preserve this day?  
This poor youngling  
For whom we sing  
By by, lully lullay!  
  
Herod, the king  
In his raging  
Charged he hath this day  
  
His men of might  
In his own sight  
All young children to slay  
  
That woe is me  
  
Poor child for thee!  
And ever morn and day  
For thy parting  
Neither say nor sing  
By by, lully lullay!
