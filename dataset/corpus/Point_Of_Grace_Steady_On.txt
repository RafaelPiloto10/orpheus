Kicking up the dust, heaven or bust  
We're headed for the promised land  
Since the moment we believed, we've been eager to leave  
Like a child tugging daddy's hand  
May we never forget that patience is a virtue  
Calm our anxious feet so faithful hands can serve you lord  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
We run up ahead, we lag behind you  
It's hard to wait when heaven's on our mind  
Teach our restless feet to walk beside you  
'Cause in our hearts we're already gone  
Will you walk with us  
Steady on  
  
We want to walk awhile  
We know that every mile is bringing us closer home  
We want to tell the story  
Of sinner bound for glory and turn to find we're not alone  
When we walk in your light the lost will see you better  
As the narrow road gets crowded lord won't you lead us...  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Steady me when the road of faith gets rocky  
Oh ready me, for fears I cannot see  
Lord won't you let me be a witness to your promise  
Won't you steady me  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
We run on up ahead, we lag behind you  
It's hard to wait when heaven's on our minds  
Teach our restless feet to walk beside you  
'Cause in our hearts we're already gone  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Will you walk with us  
Steady on...
