Well everythin' I do is wrong everythin' I say is wrong  
My baby tellin' me so long what am I gonna do  
Cause there's just no more dreams to dream no more tears to cry  
Nothin' left to say but a baby a baby bye bye  
Oh I once was your sweetheart now you found a new sweetheart  
I hate to see you break my heart what am I gonna do  
Cause there's just no more dreams...  
[ guitar ]  
Yeah oh I have got to get by ah it'll be hard but I'll try  
I'm a gonna love you till I die here I am walkin' alone  
Cause there's just no more dreams...  
Oh baby a baby bye bye yeah oh baby a baby bye bye oh baby a baby bye bye
