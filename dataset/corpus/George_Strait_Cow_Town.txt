C'mon along and we'll go down  
To a place in Texas called Cow Town  
You'll never meet a stranger there  
Everybody knows if you're in town  
  
They'll meet you with a smile and a  
'Howdy, how you all?' and just a little while  
You'll get that Texas drawl  
The hats are wide, and the boots are brown  
You'll just love this place called Cow Town  
  
No matter where I may wonder  
No matter where I may roam  
There's a place way down yonder  
I'm goin' there and make it my home  
  
C'mon along and we'll go down  
To a place in Texas called Cow Town  
You'll never meet a stranger there  
Everybody knows if you're in town  
  
They'll meet you with a smile and a  
'Howdy, how you all?' and just a little while  
You'll get that Texas drawl  
The hats are wide, and the boots are brown  
You'll just love this place called Cow Town  
  
You'll just love this place called Cow Town
