Sometimes you can be like a stranger  
In moments when you're so far away  
In the night when i reach out to hold you  
You just turn away, why do you turn away  
  
Oh, i love you so when you're smilin'  
But your smile has faded overnight  
Will we stay like this for a lifetime  
Gettin' nothin' right, gettin' nothin' right  
  
Why do we always have stormy weather  
Why do we have it so rough  
Is it so hard just to stay close together  
Why can't we ever have love  
  
Oh, i knew from the first time i saw you  
I just had to make you mine  
Felt so sad when you told me  
About your troubled life, all about your troubled life  
  
So here we are just a few years further  
Still tryin' to make it work  
I've a feelin' what we really need right now, girl  
Is just a little love, oh baby, just a little love  
  
Why should we always have stormy weather  
Why should we have it so rough  
It's not so hard just to stay close together  
Why can't we only have love
