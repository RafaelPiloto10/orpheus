The phone don't ring  
And the sun refused to shine  
Never thought I'd have to pay so dearly  
For what was already mine  
For such a long, long time  
  
We made mad love  
Shadow love  
Random love  
And abandoned love  
Accidentally like a martyr  
The hurt gets worse and the heart gets harder  
  
The days slide by  
Should have done, should have done, we all sigh  
Never thought I'd ever be so lonely  
After such a long, long time  
Time out of mind  
  
We made mad love  
Shadow love  
Random love  
And abandoned love  
Accidentally like a martyr  
The hurt gets worse and the heart gets harder
