You left me here alone  
I guess I'll never see the light  
You turned another's thumb  
And he makes your wrongs  
Seem right  
Out on some different wavelength  
Somehow he brings you more  
But sweetheart tonight  
I know for sure  
I'll see those tears  
The damage they do  
You're breaking my heart with those tears  
I'll cry over you  
Can we make a new start  
Of all the girls I've had at my knees  
You're the only one  
That could bring me to these tears  
A master of the beat  
You've got my number in your hands  
A killer on the streets  
You've got your actions planned  
But somewhere in your heart  
There must be a place for me  
Cause sweetheart tonight  
I know for sure  
I'll see those tears  
The damage they do  
You're breaking my heart with those tears  
I'll cry over you  
Can we make a new start  
Of all the girls I've had at my knees  
You're the only one  
That could bring me to these tears  
Oh yeah  
Oh yeah  
I'm looking at you  
You're looking at me  
You won't let me go  
But you won't set me free  
Of those tears  
The damage they do  
You're breaking my heart with those tears  
Cry over you  
Cry for you tonight  
Cry you a river  
I'm gonna cry for you tonight  
I'm gonna cry you a river  
Cry you a river tonight  
(Cry for you)  
I'm gonna cry for you tonight  
(Cry for you)  
I'm gonna cry you a river  
(Cry for you)  
I'll cry for you tonight
