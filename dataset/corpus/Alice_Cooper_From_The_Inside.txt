I got lost on the road somewhere was it texas or was it Canda Dinking whiskey
in the morning light I work the stage all night long at first we laughed about
it my long haired drunken friends  
Proposed a toast to Jimmy's ghost  
I never Dreamed that I would wind up on the losing end I'm stuck here on the
inside looking out I'm just another case Where's my make up where's my face on
the inside All got you kicks from what you saw up there Eight bucks even buys
a folding chair I was downing seagrams on another flight and I worked that
stage all night long You were screaming for the villain up there and i was
much obliged the old road sure screwed me good this time It's hard to see
where the vicious circle ends I'm stuck here on the inside looking out that's
no big discrace where's my makeup where's' my face on the inside
