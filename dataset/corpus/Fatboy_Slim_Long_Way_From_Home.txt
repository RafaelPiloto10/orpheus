To tired to walk it was a long way from home,  
The moon froze the night  
To tired to walk it was a long way from home,  
The moon froze the night  
  
Switch the channel on my T-V,  
And the cameras are fixed on me again,  
I'm running and I'm running and I can't seem to hide,  
The skies so red that I'm loosing my mind  
I can't get my head to stop this feeling inside  
The four walls are coming and I can't get outside  
  
The fours walls have come taking all that's mind  
There steeling my toys leave no memories behind  
Everything's changing nothing seems the same,  
They ? my thoughts not cars or trains  
The thoughts were bought but kept me sane  
Everything's changing nothing seems the same,  
  
To tired to walk it was a long way from home,  
The moon froze the night  
To tired to walk it was a long way from home,  
The moon froze the night  
  
Stare out my window, I'm yearning for more  
Bust for my borrowers and settle the score  
I want my toys but the man out there's to hard  
Running around, feet on the ground  
Can't seem to understand this game there playing  
And no one seem to wanna sit with me.  
  
To tired to walk it was a long way from home,  
The moon froze the night  
To tired to walk it was a long way from home,  
The moon froze the night  
  
To tired to walk it was a long way from home,  
The moon froze the night  
To tired to walk it was a long way from home,  
The moon froze the night  
  
To tired to walk it was a long way from home,  
The moon froze the night  
To tired to walk it was a long way from home,  
The moon froze the night
