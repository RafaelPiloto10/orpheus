Pretty women wonder  
Where my secret lies  
I'm not cute or built to suit  
A fashion model's size  
But when I start to tell them  
They think I'm telling lies.  
  
I say  
It's in the reach of my arms  
The span of my hips  
The stride of my steps  
The curl of my lips.  
  
I'm a woman  
Phenomenal woman  
(Yes indeed)  
'Cause I'm a woman  
Phenomenal woman  
Baby that's me.  
  
I walk into a room  
Just as cool as you please  
And to a man  
The fellows stand or  
Fall down on their knees  
Then they swarm around me  
Like a hive of honey bees.  
  
I say  
It's the fire in my eyes  
And the flash of my teeth  
The swing of my waist  
The joy in my feet.  
  
I'm a woman  
Phenomenal woman  
(Yes indeed)  
'Cause I'm a woman  
Phenomenal woman  
Baby that's me.  
  
It's in the arch of my back  
The sun of my smile  
The ride of my breasts  
The grace of my style.  
  
Now you understand  
Just why my head's not bowed  
I don't shout  
Or jump about  
Or have to talk real loud  
When you see me passing  
It ought to make you proud.  
  
I say  
It's in the click of my heels  
The bend of my hair  
The palm of my hand  
The need for my care.  
  
I'm a woman  
Phenomenal woman  
(Yes indeed)  
'Cause I'm a woman  
Phenomenal woman  
Baby that's me.  
Baby that's me yeah
