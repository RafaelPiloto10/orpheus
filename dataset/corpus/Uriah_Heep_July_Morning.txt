There I was on a July morning  
Looking for love  
With the strength  
Of a new day dawning  
And the beautiful sun  
  
At the sound  
Of the first bird singing  
I was leaving for home  
With the storm  
And the night behind me  
And a road of my own  
  
With the day came the resolution  
I'll be looking for you  
La la la la  
  
I was looking for love  
In the strangest places  
Wasn't a stone  
That I left unturned  
Must have tried more  
Than a thousand faces  
But not one was aware  
Of the fire that burned  
  
In my heart, in my mind, in my soul  
La la la la  
  
There I was on a July morning  
I was looking for love  
With the strength  
Of a new day dawning  
And the beautiful sun  
  
And at the sound  
Of the first bird singing  
I was leaving for home  
With the storm  
And the night behind me  
Yeah, and a road of my own
