The more you see the less you know  
The less you find out as you grow  
I knew much more then than I do now  
  
Neon heart, day-glow eyes  
The city lit by fireflies  
They're advertising in the skies  
And people like us  
  
And I miss you when you're not around  
I'm getting ready to leave the ground  
  
Oh you look so beautiful tonight...in the city of blinding lights  
  
Don't think before you laugh  
Look ugly in a photograph  
Flash bulbs, purple irises the camera can't see  
  
I've seen you walk unafraid  
I've seen you in the clothes you've made  
Can you see the beauty inside of me?  
What happened to the beauty I had inside of me?  
  
And I miss you when you're not around  
I'm getting ready to leave the ground  
  
Oh you look so beautiful tonight...tonight  
In the city of blinding lights  
  
Time...time....time...won't leave me as I am  
But time won't take the boy out of this man  
Oh you look so beautiful tonight  
Oh you look so beautiful tonight  
Oh you look so beautiful tonight  
  
The more you know, the less you feel  
Some pray for , others steal  
Blessings not just for the ones who kneel...luckily.
