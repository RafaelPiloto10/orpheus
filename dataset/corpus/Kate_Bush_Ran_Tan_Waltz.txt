Where is she  
When the little thing cries?  
She lies in a bed  
With a friend of mine.  
But some nights  
She'll run back in fright  
If she picks on a dick  
That's too big for her pride.  
  
Oh! Oh!  
Why did I ever go marry her?  
I was a child!  
I'm holding the baby,  
She's ran-tanning constantly.  
She saw me coming for miles.  
She saw me open wide.  
  
Four o'clock  
And the key's in the lock.  
And she's been on the wing  
And she's stinking of drink.  
Wakes the kid,  
So I put him to sleep,  
And she's in there all night,  
Doubled over the sink.  
  
Oh! Oh!  
Why did I ever go marry her?  
I was a child!  
I'm holding the baby,  
She's ran-tanning constantly.  
She saw me coming for miles.  
She saw me open wide.  
Open wide.  
Open wide.
