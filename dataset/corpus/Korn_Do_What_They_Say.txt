Walk away when you're angry  
Brace yourself, there's nothing to gain  
Old enough to know the outcome  
More blood, it's always the same  
  
[Chorus]  
Aren't we cool and aren't we calm?  
For facing death, we run it on  
Aren't we cool and aren't we calm?  
The God reserved a false alarm  
Aren't we cool and arent we calm?  
For facing death, we run it on  
  
Do what they say  
Or they take it away  
I'd rather be dead than  
Carry on  
  
Wait  
But you live, dont be cursing  
You mustn't take gods name in vain  
Wait  
Put your knife forward the curtain  
Impulsives, you must refrain  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Do what they say  
Or they take it away  
I'd rather be dead than  
Carry on  
  
So we carry on  
With this burden  
I can't remember anything  
I can't be certain  
  
Aren't we cool and aren't we calm?  
For facing death, we run it on  
Do what they say  
Or they take it away  
I'd rather be dead than  
Carry on
