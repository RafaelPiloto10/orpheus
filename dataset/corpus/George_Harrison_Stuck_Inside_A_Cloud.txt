Never slept so little  
Never smoked so much  
Lost my concentration I could even lose my touch  
Talking to myself  
Crying out loud  
Only I can hear me  
I'm stuck inside a cloud  
  
I made some exhibition  
I lost my will to eat  
The only thing that matters to me is to touch your lotus feet  
Talking to myself  
Crying out loud  
  
Only I can hear me  
I'm stuck inside a cloud  
Talking to myself  
Crying out loud  
Only I can hear me  
And I'm stuck inside a cloud  
  
Talking to myself  
Crying out loud  
Only I can hear me  
I'm stuck inside a cloud  
  
Never been so crazy  
But I've never felt so sure  
I wish I had the answer to give  
Don't even have the cure  
  
Just talking to myself crying as we part  
Knowing as you leave me  
I also lose my heart  
Talking to myself crying as we part  
Knowing as you leave me  
I also lose my heart
