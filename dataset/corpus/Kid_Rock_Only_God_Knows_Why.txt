I've been sittin' here trying to find myself  
I get behind myself I need to rewind myself  
Looking for the payback listening for the playback  
They say that every man bleeds just like me  
  
And I feel like number one yet I'm last in line  
I watch my younger son and it helps to pass the time  
I take too many pills that helps to ease the pain  
I made a couple of dollar bills still I feel the same  
  
Everybody knows my name they say it way out loud  
A lot of folks fuck with me it's hard to hang out in a crowd  
I guess that's the price you pay to be some big shot like I am  
Out stretched hands and one night stands  
  
Still I can't find love and when the walls are tumbling down  
I will always be around  
Yeah...  
  
And when the walls are tumbling down I will always be around  
People don't know about the things I say and do  
They don't understand about the shit I've been through  
It's been so long since I've been home  
  
I've been gone, I've been gone way too long  
Maybe I've forgotten all the things I miss  
Oh, somehow I know there is more to life than this  
I've said it too many times and I still stand firm  
  
You get what you put in and people get what the deserve  
Still I ain't seen mine, no I ain't seen mine  
I've been given but just ain't gettin' I've been walkin that thin line  
So I think I'll keep a walking with my head held high  
  
I'll keep moving on and only God knows why  
Only God, Only God, Only God knows why  
Only God knows why, why, why, why  
Only God knows why  
  
Take it to the river, hey  
Take it to the river, hey
