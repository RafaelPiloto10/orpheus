You're the reason I don't sleep at night  
I just lay here at night, toss and I turn  
Lovin' you so, how my heart yearns  
You're the reason I don't sleep at night  
Walkin' the floor, feelin' so blue  
Smoke cigarettes and drink coffee too  
You're the reason I don't sleep at night  
I'm bettin' you're not losin' sleep over me  
But if I'm wrong, don't fail to call  
Come over and keep me company  
Sometimes I go for walk, take a look at the moon  
Strum my guitar and sing out a tune  
Honey, you're the reason I don't sleep at night
