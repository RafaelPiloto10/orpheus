I don't know if I can yell any louder  
How many times have I kicked you outta here?  
Or said something insulting?  
I can be so mean when I wanna be  
I am capable of really anything  
I can cut you into pieces when my heart is broken  
  
Please don't leave me, please don't leave me  
I always say how I don't need you  
But it's always gonna come right back to this  
Please don't leave me  
  
How did I become so obnoxious?  
What is it with you that makes me act like this?  
I've never been this nasty  
Can't you tell that this is all just a contest?  
The one that wins will be the one that hits the hardest  
But baby, I don't mean it, I mean it, I promise  
  
Please don't leave me, please don't leave me, don't leave me  
I always say how I don't need you  
But it's always gonna come right back to this  
Please don't leave me  
  
I forgot to say out loud  
How beautiful you really are to me  
I can't be without  
You're my perfect little punching bag  
And I need you, I'm sorry  
  
Please, please don't leave me, baby, please don't leave me  
No, don't leave me, please don't leave me  
I always say I don't need you  
But it's always gonna come right back to this  
  
Please don't leave me, please don't leave me  
I always say how I don't need you  
But it's always gonna come right back to this  
Please don't leave me, baby, please, please don't leave me
