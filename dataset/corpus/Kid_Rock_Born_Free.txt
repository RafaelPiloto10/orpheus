Fast, on a rough road riding  
High, through the mountains climbing  
Twisting, turning further from my home.  
Young, like a new moon rising  
Fierce, through the rain and lightning  
Wandering out into this great unknown.  
  
And I don't want no one to cry, but tell em'  
If I don't survive  
  
[Chorus]  
I was born free  
I was born free  
I was born free  
Born Free  
  
Free, like a river raging  
Strong, if the wind I'm facing.  
Chasing dreams and racing father time.  
Deep like the grandest canyon,  
Wild like an untamed stallion.  
If you can't see my heart you must be blind.  
  
You can knock me down and watch me bleed  
But you can't keep no chains on me.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I'm not good at long goodbyes but look down  
Deep into my eyes.  
  
I was born free!  
  
Hey yaya yayaya  
Oh hoo  
  
Calm facing danger  
Lost, like an unknown stranger  
Grateful for my time with no regrets.  
  
Close to my destination  
Tired, frail and aching  
Waitin' patiently for the sun to set  
  
And when its done believe that  
I will yell it from that mountain high  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I will vow to the shining seas  
And celebrate God's Grace on me.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, oh oh oh wah hoo
