Deaf, dumb and blind boy  
He's in a quiet vibration land.  
Strange as it seems, his musical dreams  
Ain't quite so bad.  
  
Ten years old with thoughts as bold as thoughts can be.  
Loving life and becoming wise  
In simplicity.  
  
Sickness will surely take the mind  
Where minds can't usually go.  
Come on the amazing journey  
And learn all you should know.  
  
A vague haze of delirium  
Creeps up on me.  
All at once a tall stranger I suddenly see.  
He's dressed in a silver sparkled  
Glittering gown  
And his golden beard flows  
Nearly down to the ground.  
  
Nothing to say and nothing to hear  
And nothing to see.  
Each sensation makes a note  
In my symphony.  
  
Sickness will surely take the mind  
Where minds can't usually go.  
Come on the amazing journey  
And learn all you should know.  
  
His eyes are the eyes that  
Transmit all they know.  
Sparkle warm crystalline glances to show  
That he is your leader  
And he is your guide  
On the amazing journey  
Together you'll ride.
