I walked in  
She was standing there  
By the bar in a red dress  
I couldn't catch my breath  
Her eyes like fire  
Reached into my heart  
But my soul was the target  
I didn't know it yet  
I couldn't fight it  
I felt my knees go weak  
She barely had to speak  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't really want to dance with the devil  
I admit it: she's a little too hot for me  
I don't really want to walk through the fire  
The flame's getting higher  
She's killing me  
She said  
Dance with me  
Dance with me  
Oh, baby  
Dance with me  
Dance with me  
Dance with me  
Oh, baby  
Dance with me  
Dance with me  
Dance with me  
Oh, baby  
Dance with me  
Dance with me  
Dance with me  
Oh, baby  
  
She took my hand  
Led me down the stairs  
To the floor where the music was  
Worshiped by strangers  
Her body moved in ways I've never seen  
Has the face of an angel  
So filled with danger  
I couldn't fight it  
I couldn't take the heat  
She barely had to speak  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't really want to fall tonight  
But it feels so right  
When I know it's so wrong  
I don't really want to walk away  
But she's beggin' me to stay  
And she's much too strong  
  
[Chorus]
