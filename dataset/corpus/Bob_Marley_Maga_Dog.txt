Sorry fe maga dog, maga dog, turn 'round bite you  
Sorry fe maga dog, maga dog, turn 'round bite you  
And if you jump out a frying pan, ya bound, to drop in a fire  
You jump out a frying pan, ya bound, to drop in a fire  
When I was with you, you was big and fat  
Now you look like wet daddy's rat  
Gal, I beg you let go my heart  
Can't go on and find a good man  
Sorry fe maga dog, maga dog, turn round bite you  
Sorry fe maga dog, maga dog, turn round bite you  
Sorry fe maga dog, maga dog, turn 'round bite you  
  
And if you jump in maga dog, maga dog, turn 'round bite you  
And if you jump out a frying pan, you're bound to drop in a fire  
And if you jump out a frying pan, you're bound to drop in a fire  
When I was with you, you was big and fat  
Now you look like wet daddy's rat  
Gal, I beg you let go my heart  
Can't go on and find a good man, he say  
Sorry fe maga dog, maga dog, turn round bite you  
Sorry fe maga dog, maga dog, turn round bite you
