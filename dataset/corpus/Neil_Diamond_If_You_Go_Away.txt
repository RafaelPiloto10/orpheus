If you go away on this summer day  
Then you might as well take the sun away  
All the birds that flew in a summer sky  
When our love was new and our hearts were high  
When the day was young and the night was lo-ong  
And the moon stood still for the night birds song  
If you go away, If you go away, If you go away  
  
But if you stay I'll make you a day  
Like no day has been or will be again  
We'll sail on the sun, we'll ride on the rain  
We'll talk to the trees and worship the wind  
Then if you go-o I'll understand  
Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand  
If you go away, If you go away, If you go away  
  
If you go away as I know you must  
There'll be nothin' left in the world to trust  
Just an empty room full of empty space  
Like the empty look I see on your face  
Can I tell you now as you turn to go  
I'll be dying slowly till your next hello  
If you go away, If you go away, If you go away  
  
But if you stay, I'll make you a night  
Like no night has been or will be again  
I'll sail on your smile, I'll ride on your touch  
I'll talk to your eyes that I-I love so much  
But if you go, I won't cry  
For the good's gone from goodbye  
If you go away, If you go away, If you go away
