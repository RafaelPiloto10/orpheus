My state of mind  
Has finally got the best of me  
I need you next to me  
I'll try to find a way that I can  
Get to you  
Just wanna to get to you  
  
The world I see is perfect now  
You're all around  
With you I can breath  
  
Until You're Mine  
I have to find a way  
To fill this hole inside  
I can't survive without you  
Here by my side  
Until You're Mine  
Not gonna be even  
Close to complete  
I won't rest until you're mine (mine)  
  
Alone inside, I can  
Only hear your voice  
Ringing through the noise  
Can't find my mind  
Keeps on coming back to you  
Always back to you  
  
Wanted something out of reach  
It's killing me  
You're all I see, yeah  
  
Until You're Mine  
I have to find a way  
To fill this hole inside  
I can't survive without you  
Here by my side  
Until You're Mine  
Not gonna be  
Even close to complete  
I won't rest until you're mine (mine)  
  
Just stop wondering  
If we were meant to be  
Forget about fate and just hold me  
Ready to begin  
The waiting has to end  
Right now, today  
I've gotta find a way  
Mine!  
Until You're Mine  
  
Until you're mine  
I have to find a way  
To fill this hole inside  
I can't survive without you  
Here by my side  
Until you're mine  
Not gonna be even close to complete  
I won't rest until you're mine  
  
My state of mind  
Has finally got the best of me  
I need you next to me
