Have you ever felt that somehow  
You were not yourself  
That your body was the same  
But everything around you wasn't right  
And images so strange and foreign  
Flooded in like raging water  
  
Have you ever been in love  
With someone you hardly knew  
Whereas every time you closed your eyes,  
You saw this person come alive  
It kept you wide awake at night  
You felt like you were burning up  
In pain, you want to scream  
Then you passed out in a dream  
  
Chorus  
Just once or twice is good for your soul  
Just once or twice is good for your soul  
If you don't stop, you'll lose control  
Just once or twice is good for your soul  
  
Every lay there half asleep all hours of the night  
With some nagging demon tugging at that tiny bell  
Inside your mind  
When suddenly that strange idea  
Bursts into an inspiration  
You grab for it and then  
The whole thing slips right through your fingers  
  
Chorus  
  
Just once or twice is good for your soul  
Just once or twice is good for your soul  
Just once or twice is good for your soul  
Just once or twice is good for your soul  
It's good for your soul  
It's good for your soul  
It's good for your soul  
It's good for your soul
