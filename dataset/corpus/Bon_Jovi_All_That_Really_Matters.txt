Are. Sambora  
  
When I look at you  
Youre beautiful  
There comes a time in someones life  
When you find things that matter  
And every time we touch  
The love runs deep  
We realize it's our to keep  
And that's all that really matters.  
Youll always be my sweet addiction  
In this life my saving grace  
Youre all that really matters  
You know it's true  
Aint no me without you.  
When you're in the dark  
Baby don't despair  
I'm just a spark away  
I will be there  
And that's all that matters.  
Youll always be my sweet addiction  
In this life my saving grace  
Youre all that really matters  
You know it's true  
Aint no me without you.  
Well share our lives together  
Yes our flame burns on forever  
And at the final curtain call  
We can say we did it all.  
Solo  
Youll always be my sweet addiction  
In this life my saving grace  
Youre all that really matters  
You know it's true  
Aint no me without you.  
And when we turns to dust  
And we fly away  
Therell be a light stil burning bright  
And that's all that really matters.
