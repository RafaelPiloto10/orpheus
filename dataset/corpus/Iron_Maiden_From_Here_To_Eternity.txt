She fell in love with his greasy machine  
She leaned over wiped his head  
Kick start clean  
She'd never seen the beast before  
But she left there wanting  
More more more  
But when she was walking on  
Down the road  
She heard a sound that made  
Her heart explode  
He whispered to her to get on the back  
"I'll take you on a ride  
From here to eternity"  
  
Hell ain't a bad place  
Hell is from here to eternity  
Hell ain't a bad place  
Hell is from here to eternity  
  
She must be having one of her  
Crazy dreams  
She'd never sat on a piece so mean  
It made her feel like she's on cloud nine  
She even thought she heard the  
Engine sigh  
  
But like all dreams that come to an end  
They took a tumble at the devil's bend  
The beast and Charlotte they were  
Two of a kind  
They'd always take the line  
From here to eternity  
  
Hell ain't a bad place  
Hell is from here to eternity  
Hell ain't a bad place  
Hell is from here to eternity
