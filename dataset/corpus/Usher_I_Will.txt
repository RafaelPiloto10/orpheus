There's something that I've gotta make clear  
You may have had other lovers in your life  
That can't compare to what's going down here  
I promise I'll be gentle  
I'm gonna give you all that I've got  
Don't say no, let your body go  
I'll do my thing nice and slow if you tell me your thoughts

Like your body was a 9 to 5  
And just when you think I'm getting tired baby  
I'll be putting in overtime  
I only wanna please you, to tease you is not my style  
Just let me know when you're ready for love
