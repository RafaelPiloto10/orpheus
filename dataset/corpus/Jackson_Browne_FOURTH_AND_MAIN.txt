I'm here at Fourth and Main  
Been standing in the rain  
I feel no joy, I feel no pain  
I got nothing to lose, nothing to gain  
I'm at Fourth and Main  
Been down at City Hall  
Been writing on the wall  
The grass is wet and the trees are tall  
I listen to the pigeons, to the raindrops fall  
I'm at City Hall  
Been down at Pershing Square  
I can't seem to care  
If the people stop or the people stare  
I don't care if I'm leaving, I'm going somewhere  
I'm at Pershing Square
