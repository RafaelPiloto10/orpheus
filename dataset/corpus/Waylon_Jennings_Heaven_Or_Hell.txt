Well sometimes it's heaven  
And sometimes it's hell  
Sometimes I don't even know  
Sometimes I take it as far as I can  
And sometimes I don't even go  
My front tracks're found for a cold water  
And my back tracks're covered with snow  
Sometimes it's heaven  
Sometimes it's hell  
Sometimes I don't even know  
  
Heaven ain't walkin'  
On a street paved with gold  
And hell ain't a mountain of fire  
Heaven is layin'  
In my sweet baby's arms  
Hell is when baby ain't there  
Well my front tracks're found for a cold water  
And my back tracks're covered with snow  
Well sometimes it's heaven  
And sometimes it's hell  
Sometimes I don't even know
