I got something for you,  
And I think you're sexy,  
And if you want me let me know.  
You ain't gotta spend no money,  
Just a little time with me honey,  
That will let me know you love me so.  
  
There are so many things,  
That I want to talk to you about.  
Like do you want me, do you love me,  
'Cause I have my doubts.  
  
I have a funny feeling,  
That you want me around for just one thing,  
To push your little ego,  
With the knowledge that I bring.  
  
I got something for you,  
And I think you're sexy,  
And if you want me let me know.  
You ain't gotta spend no money,  
Just a little time with me honey,  
That will let me know you love me so.  
  
You know that I want you,  
And I made it very clear.  
I would never ever hurt you,  
I'd never let you shed a tear.  
  
The only thing I want to know,  
Do you feel the love for me.  
I'm not gonna keep on waiting,  
That's not how it's gonna be,  
You got to...  
  
Let me know,  
I never knew that love could ever have me slipping.  
Let me know,  
I sit in my room thinking of you at night trippin'.  
Let me know,  
I never knew I would ever get caught caking.  
Let me know,  
And no man would ever have me shaky.  
  
I got something for you,  
And I think you're sexy,  
And if you want me let me know.  
You ain't gotta spend no money,  
Just a little time with me honey,  
That will let me know you love me so.
