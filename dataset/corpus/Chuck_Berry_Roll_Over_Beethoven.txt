I'm gonna write a little letter,  
Gonna mail it to my local DJ  
It's a rockin' rhythm record  
I want my jockey to play  
Roll Over Beethoven, I gotta hear it again today  
  
You know, my temperature's risin'  
And the jukebox blows a fuse  
My heart's beatin' rhythm  
And my soul keeps on singin' the blues  
Roll Over Beethoven and tell Tchaikovsky the news  
  
I got the rockin' pneumonia,  
I need a shot of rhythm and blues  
I think I'm rollin' arthritis  
Sittin' down by the rhythm review  
Roll Over Beethoven rockin' in two by two  
  
Well, if you feel you like it  
Go get your lover, then reel and rock it  
Roll it over and move on up just  
A trifle further and reel and rock it,  
Roll it over,  
Roll Over Beethoven rockin' in two by two  
  
Well, early in the mornin' I'm a-givin' you a warnin'  
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes  
Hey diddle diddle, I am playin' my fiddle,  
Ain't got nothin' to lose  
Roll Over Beethoven and tell Tschaikowsky the news  
  
You know she wiggles like a glow worm,  
Dance like a spinnin' top  
She got a crazy partner,  
Oughta see 'em reel and rock  
Long as she got a dime the music will never stop  
  
Roll Over Beethoven,  
Roll Over Beethoven,  
Roll Over Beethoven,  
Roll Over Beethoven,  
Roll Over Beethoven and dig these rhythm and blues
