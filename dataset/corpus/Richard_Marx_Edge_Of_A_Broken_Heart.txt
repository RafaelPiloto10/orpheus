I can't believe I couldve been so blind,  
But love is strange.  
I thought about it for a long, long time,  
But the truth remains.  
I don't need another lonely night to dry my tears.  
The answers plain as black and white,  
And I can see the picture very clear.  
  
I've been livin on the edge of a broken heart.  
I don't wanna fall, I don't wanna crawl.  
I've been livin on the edge of a broken heart.  
Don't you wonder why I gotta say goodbye?  
  
It isn't like you never had the chance  
To change your tune.  
Did you think that I'm a dime a dance?  
Well the dance is through.  
I've been doin things your way too long,  
But baby that's over.  
It wont be easy, but I've gotta be strong,  
And if I wanna cry I don't need your shoulder.  
  
I've been livin on the edge of a broken heart.  
I don't wanna fall, I don't wanna crawl.  
I've been livin on the edge of a broken heart.  
Don't you wonder why I gotta say goodbye?  
  
Ill find someone else whos nothing like you.  
Two can play the game as well,  
And you're gonna be sorry, baby,  
When it's over!  
  
[guitar interlude]  
  
I've been doin things your way too long,  
But baby that's over.  
It wont be easy but I've gotta be strong,  
And if I wanna cry I don't need your shoulder.
