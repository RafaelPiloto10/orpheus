When you're down and they're counting  
When your secrets all found out  
When your troubles take to mounting  
When the map you have leads you to doubt  
When there's no information  
And the compass turns, yeah to nowhere you know well  
  
Just let your soul be your pilot  
Let your soul guide you  
He'll guide you well  
  
When the doctor failed to heal you  
When no medicine chest can make you well  
When no counsel leads to comfort (leads to comfort)  
When there are no more lies they can tell  
No more useless information and the compass spins  
The compass spins between heaven and hell  
  
Just let your soul be your pilot  
Let your soul guide you  
He'll guide you well  
  
And your eyes turn towards the window pane  
To the lights upon the hill  
The distance seems so strange to you now  
And the dark room seems so still  
  
Let your pain be my sorrow  
Let your tears be my tears too  
Let your courage be my model  
That the north you find will still be true  
Oh, when there's no more information  
And the compass turns, the compass turns  
To nowhere that you know well  
  
Let your soul be your pilot  
Let your soul guide you  
Let your soul guide you  
Let your soul guide you upon your way  
  
(Let your soul guide you)  
Let your soul  
When your down, let it come to you  
Let your soul guide you  
Let your soul guide you  
Be your guidance, yeah  
When your secret all found out  
Let your soul guide you  
Let your soul  
When there's no  
Affirmation, let your soul, let your soul
