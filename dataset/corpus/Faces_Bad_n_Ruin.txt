Mother, don't you recognize your son?  
Coming home 'cause I failed you, mother  
I'll be there in the morning  
If you'll have me back  
The rent up here is much too high  
For a room without a tap  
I'll be early in the morning  
And I'll find my way back home  
Back home, bad 'n' ruin  
With my tail between my legs  
Tail between my legs  
And I'll be so tired  
  
I'll be early tomorrow morning  
And I'll fall down off my plane  
Don't be embarrassed, mother  
By your ugly worn-out son  
Your ugly worn-out son  
  
Mother, you won't recognize me now  
Mother, you won't recognize me now  
Mother, you won't recognize me now  
  
And I'll be down on Cannon street  
Passport in my hand  
Should you not recognize me  
I've heavily made-up my eyes  
Mama, you won't recognize me now  
Brother, you won't recognize me now  
Sister, you won't recognize me now  
Mother, you won't recognize me now  
  
So, mother, when you've seen me  
Don't forget I'm your boy too  
I know my brother has done you proud  
He's one foot in the grave  
Mother, don't you recognize me now?  
  
I'm a burglar in the first degree  
But it don't seem to worry me  
I'll be so tired, so tired  
I'll be so tired, so tired  
  
So tired
