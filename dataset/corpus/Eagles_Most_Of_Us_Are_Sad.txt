Most of us are sad  
No one lets it show  
I've been shadows of myself  
How was i to know?  
  
Tell me scarlet sun  
What will time allow?  
We have brought our children  
Here who can save them now?  
  
Oh, weeping woman try to smile  
Like the coming dawn  
Most of us are sad it's true  
Still we must go on  
  
Love was here today  
Oh the sun was bright  
I will sing you faraway  
Love is here tonight  
  
Most of us are sad  
No one lets it show  
I've been shadows of myself  
How was i to know?
