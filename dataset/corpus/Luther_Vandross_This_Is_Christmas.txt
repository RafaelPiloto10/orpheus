Don't be discouraged, don't be dismayed  
There's hope for all in this world  
'Cause this is Christmas day  
Say a little prayer for the world  
God teach us love  
Though you think that He doesn't hear  
I know he does  
  
This is Christmas, let the world sing  
Let us all begin to heal  
Hallelujah, this is Christmas  
And with love we can begin today  
  
Christmas bells ring, people's hearts sing  
And I forget about all the troubles I seem to have,  
Aand I tell myself to feel how my brother feels  
Try to love him and maybe then I'll understand him  
Make a little room in our hearts  
No heart's too small  
Can't we love each other today?  
'Cause after all  
  
This is Christmas, let the world sing  
Let us all begin to heal  
Hallelujah, this is Christmas  
And with love we can begin today  
  
Come, come, come see the little one  
Come, come, come see the little one  
Come see the baby  
Come see the baby  
  
This is Christmas, let the world sing  
Let us all begin to heal  
Hallelujah, this is Christmas  
And with love we can begin today  
  
This is Christmas, let the world sing  
Let us all begin to heal  
Hallelujah, this is Christmas  
And with love we can begin  
  
This is Christmas, let the world sing  
Let us all begin to heal  
Hallelujah, this is Christmas  
And with love we can begin  
  
This is Christmas
