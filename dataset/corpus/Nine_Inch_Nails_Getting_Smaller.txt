Getting a little erratic here  
And I don't know who to trust  
I guess they got a way of reading my mind  
I guess I gotta adjust  
Got my arms they flip flop flip flop flip  
Got my head on a spring  
Well I thought I got you on my side  
I haven't got fucking anything  
  
I'm just a face in the crowd  
Nothing to worry about  
Not even tryin' to stand out  
  
I'm getting smaller  
And smaller and smaller  
And I have nothing to say  
Its only taken away  
I just behave and obey  
I'm afraid that I'm starting to fade away  
  
I cannot see through the cracks  
When I'm pressed up on the wall  
I'm not looking to stand up real high  
I'd be happy to crawl  
I think I'm losing my grip  
But I can still make a fist  
You know I still got my one good arm  
That I can beat  
Oh that I can beat myself with up with  
  
I'm just a face in the crowd  
Nothing to worry about  
Not even tryin' to stand out  
  
I'm getting smaller  
And smaller and smaller  
And I have nothing to say  
It's only taken away  
I just behave and obey  
I'm afraid I am starting to fade away  
  
And for what it is worth  
I really used to believe  
Maybe theirs some great thing  
That we could achieve  
And now I can't tell the difference  
Don't know what to feel  
Between what I've been trying to hard to see  
And what appears to be real  
  
Fading away  
Fading away  
Fading away  
Fading away  
  
My world is getting smaller everyday-yea-yea-yea  
My world is getting smaller everyday-yea-yea-yea  
(and that's ok)  
  
My world is getting smaller everyday-yea-yea-yea  
My world is getting smaller everyday-yea-yea-yea  
(and that's ok)
