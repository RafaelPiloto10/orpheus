I love to love you baby  
I love to love you baby  
I love to love you baby  
I love to love you baby  
I love to love you baby  
  
When you're laying so close to me  
There's no place I'd rather you be than with me  
  
I love to love you baby  
I love to love you baby  
I love to love you baby  
  
Do it to me again and again  
You put me in such a awful spin, in a spin  
  
I love to love you baby  
I love to love you baby  
I love to love you baby  
  
Lay your head down real close to me  
Soothe my mind and set me free, set me free  
  
Uh, love to love you baby  
Uh, love to love you baby  
Uh, love to love you baby  
Uh, love to love you baby  
Uh, love to love you baby  
Uh, love to love you baby  
  
When you're laying so close to me  
There's no place I'd rather you be than with me  
  
I love to love you baby  
I love to love you baby  
I love to love you baby  
  
Do it to me again and again  
You put me in such a awful spin, in a spin  
  
I love to love you baby  
I love to love you baby  
I love to love you baby  
I love to love you baby  
I love to love you baby  
I love to love you baby  
I love to love you baby
