Woman you can change my world  
Woman you can change my world  
  
I'm chained to the fears  
Inside these walls  
The silence talks loud  
'Bout the things I recall  
  
Through the bricks in the window  
I scream at the world  
But when no one is listening  
It's hard to be heard  
  
Woman you can change my world  
Woman there'll be no return  
  
I see shadows  
Coming through the walls  
I hear voices  
But no one's talking at all  
  
I can feel the madness  
Crawling up my spine  
Reachin' out  
To grab your mind  
  
Woman come and change my world  
  
(Do you remember all those fears?)  
They won't leave me alone  
(Do you remember all those tears?)  
I pretend to be strong  
  
(Do you remember all the pain?)  
I'm getting tired of the game  
I cannot live I cannot die  
I want to know who the hell am I  
  
You've never seen me  
But I know you so well  
And before it kills me  
I gotta break the spell  
  
The deeper we touch  
The higher we'll go  
The time has come  
To heal my soul  
  
Woman you can change my world  
  
(Do you remember all those fears?)  
They won't leave me alone  
(Do you remember all those tears?)  
I pretend to be strong  
  
(Do you remember all the pain?)  
I'm getting tired of the game  
I cannot live I cannot die  
I want to know who the hell am I  
  
Woman I'm gonna change your world
