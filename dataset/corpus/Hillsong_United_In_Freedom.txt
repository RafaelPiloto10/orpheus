In freedom  
Words and Music by: Aran Puddle  
  
A rising generation  
Set apart for liberty  
A royal loving people  
Chosen to be mighty  
Mighty in the land  
  
A people who are hungry  
Hungry for the bread of life  
A people who are thirsty  
Thirsty for the river  
The river of joy  
  
All across the nation  
A cry is ringing out  
The church of the king's breaking out  
  
In freedom  
In power  
In healing  
Salvation to the end of the earth
