Love's dreaming  
Love's sleeping  
And when it wakes again who knows  
The company it's keeping  
I am dreaming  
I am falling  
And just before I hit the ground I hear you calling  
  
There's an angel  
Floating round my house  
Floating round my house  
There's an angel  
Floating round this house  
  
Still dreaming  
I am flying  
And far above my room  
I thought I heard you crying  
I am calling  
Come with me  
Come on in and take me by the hand  
Come give me what I understand  
  
There's an angel  
Floating round my house  
Floating round my house  
There's an angel  
Floating round this house  
  
Love's dreaming  
Love's sleeping  
And when it wakes again who knows  
The company it's keeping  
I am dreaming  
I am falling  
And just before I hit the ground  
I hear you calling  
  
There's an angel  
Floating round my house  
Floating round my house  
There's an angel  
Floating round this house  
There's an angel  
Floating round my house  
Floating round my heart  
There's an angel  
Floating round this house  
Floating round this heart  
Round this head
