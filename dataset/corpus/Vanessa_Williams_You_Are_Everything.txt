You are, you are, everything, everything, oh  
You are, you are, everything, everything, oh  
You are, you are, everything, everything, everything is you  
  
Today I saw somebody  
Who looked just like you  
He walked like you do  
I thought it was you  
As he turned the corner  
I called out your name  
I felt so ashamed  
When it wasn't you  
Wasn't you  
  
You are everything  
And everything is you  
You are everything  
And everything is you  
Oh you are everything  
And everything is you  
Everything is you  
  
How can I forget  
When each face that I see  
Brings back memories  
Of being with you  
I just can't go on  
Living life as I do  
Comparing each man with you  
Knowing they just won't do  
They're not you  
  
Oh you are everything  
And everything is you  
Oh, you are everything  
And everything is you  
Oh, you are everything  
And everything is you  
Everything is you  
  
You are, you are, everything, everything, oh  
You are, you are, everything, everything, oh  
You are, you are, everything, everything, everything is you  
  
You are everything  
And everything is you  
Oh, you are everything  
And everything is you  
Oh you are everything  
And everything is you  
Everything is you  
  
You are, you are, everything, everything, oh  
You are, you are, everything, everything, oh  
You are, you are, everything, everything, everything is you
