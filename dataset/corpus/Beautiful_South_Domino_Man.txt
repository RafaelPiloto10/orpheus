Through ugly pints and Sunday breath  
Sit men whose stare is cold as death  
Through wide lapels and glued up eyes  
Through made up kids and made up wives  
Sitting in the heart of them  
Is a man who's not like other men  
Don't you know just who I am  
A nod, a wink, I am the domino man.  
  
And if you pull a double one  
I'll pack my bags and I'll be gone  
If you pull a three and four  
I'm flying off to Singapore  
Where women dance and tigers roar  
I'm lying on a distant shore  
I'm living life just as as I can  
A nod, a wink, another drink I am the domino man.  
  
Through a twenty deep screen of humorists  
Through slavering jaws and angry fists  
Through tales of mishap and the clickety-clack  
Is fully paid member of the brother of the tap  
  
Through heavy smoke and idle bets  
Through heaving lungs and heavy debts  
Sits a man who knows he can  
A nod, a wink, I am the domino man  
  
And if you pull a two and a six  
I'll pack my bags and take that risk  
And if you pull a four and five  
They'll never take this man alive  
I'll go far east and I'll survive  
The market streets I'll duck and dive  
I'm living life as fast as I can  
A nod, a wink, another drink I am the domino man  
  
And when he's off to sail the seven seas  
He just stay indoors or hides up trees  
He's been to places that you've never seen  
But his mind is blank and his passport's clean  
  
But if you pull a two and a six  
I'll pack my bags and take that risk  
And if you pull a four and five  
They'll never take this man alive  
I'll go far east and I'll survive  
The market street I'll duck and dive  
I'm living life just as fast as I can  
A nod, a wink, another drink, I am the domino man
