I've always loved you because you've been so true  
You've always been so kind you've never made me blue  
You're the girl of my dreams and I think it's time you see  
That I can't live without you I wouldn't change a thing  
About you but your name  
Don't answer too quick please think it over dear  
I swear I'd love you forever and the year  
You're the only love I've known I know we'd have a happy home  
No I can't live without you I wouldn't change a thing  
About you but your name  
  
I wouldn't change a thing about you but your name  
And I can't wait until they're both the same  
For your heart's so good and true to your pretty eyes of blue  
No I can't live without you I wouldn't change a thing  
About you but your name
