Nothing's ever changed, you still turn away  
You've washed your hands, you've made that all too clear  
You just keep on living this lie  
  
You refuse to see, you're denying me  
The cross I bear but you don't seem to care  
Even Judas knew he had lied  
  
I keep wondering why  
I'm still calling your name through my tears  
  
Why have you waited to embrace me my dear?  
Cold is your silence, denying what is real  
I'm still wondering why  
I'm still calling your name my dear  
  
I'm sorry if you can't stand the naked truth  
All you see is how you want it to be  
So you keep on living your life  
  
Release me from this cross after all these years  
Oh call my name and help me with this weight  
Even though it comes far too late  
  
I keep wondering why  
I'm still calling your name through my tears  
  
Why have you waited to embrace me my dear  
Cold is your silence, denying what is real  
I'm still wondering why I'm still calling your name  
And I wonder, oh I wonder ...  
  
In my heart I still hope you will open the door  
You can purify it all, answer my call  
  
Why? Why?  
  
Why have you waited to embrace me my dear?  
Cold is your silence, denying what is real  
I'm still wondering why I'm still calling your name  
And I wonder, oh I wonder ...  
  
In my heart I still hope you will open the door  
You can purify it all, answer my call
