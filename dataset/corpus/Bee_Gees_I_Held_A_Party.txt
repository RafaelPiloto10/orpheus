I held a party and nobody came  
Strangely I was upset  
Poured out a drink and then Birkworth approached saying  
"Have no regrets. Maybe your gentle friends had some delay.  
Don't try to take on the world"  
  
Made up my bed and decided to sleep  
Dreaming I was awake  
Maybe I drank an excess of my drink  
Nice clan, cordial crowd  
Birkworth suggested we sleep through the night  
I never knew him so well
