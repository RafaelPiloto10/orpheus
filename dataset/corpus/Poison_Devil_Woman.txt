Mr. Rockett, give me some drums!  
  
She'll slide you in, you taste the sin  
She slowly gets inside your head  
You feel her take control and she'll steal your soul  
She's the devil lying in your bed  
She's the lord of your thighs and it's no surprise  
You're playing with loaded gun  
She's a killer queen and she'll lick you clean  
Then she'll spit you out when she's done  
  
[Chorus]  
Devil woman, evil woman  
She'll make you believe  
L.A. woman, she's my woman  
Brings out the devil in me  
  
She got blood red lips and head trips  
Leave a poor boy beggin' for more  
When you get that itch ain't love a bitch  
Now you need her just a little more  
She's a soul taker, a ball breaker  
And boy she's gonna break you  
She's gonna steal your heart, steal your money  
Laugh at you when she's through  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Well the way she'll do you  
Things you ain't never seen  
She can tear right through you  
You can never leave  
  
[Chorus: x2]
