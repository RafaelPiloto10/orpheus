Hi I'm Robby's sister, I guess that's plain to see  
When we watch cartoon cartoons, I'm happy as can be  
I think samurai Jack is cool, And Dexter's laboratory  
I miss watching power puff, I miss watching T. V.  
  
Well livin' the tour bus ain't that bad  
But I feel like I lost all that, I have  
  
On Cartoon Network, I miss you so  
On Cartoon Network, where did you go  
Grim and evil, how I love that little brain  
Johnny Bravo, can I smack you once again?  
  
I hope you've learned a lesson here  
Treasure what you have, don't make the mistake I made  
The rockstar life is sad  
  
Well, livin' on the tour bus is, pretty bad  
And now I'm sure I know, the meanin' in my life  
The love within my soul  
The reason I wake up each day, and it's:  
  
Cartoon Network, I miss you so  
My Cartoon Network, where did you go  
My Cartoon Network
