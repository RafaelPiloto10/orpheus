If you know you're right  
When the others are wrong  
It's hard to sit and take it  
They treat you like you've lost your senses  
Call you troublemaker  
  
I'm not trying to cause you trouble  
I don't want to fight  
Someone's got to stand up sometime  
And do what's right  
  
Just have the courage of  
The courage of your convictions  
  
People tell you do what's right  
And set and good example  
Sometimes right means who to hate  
Listen to the people  
I'm not trying to mess your mind up  
But it's plain to see  
People pulling from both sides  
It's agitating me  
  
So have the courage of  
The courage of your convictions  
  
People teaming up on sides  
Hating one another  
Know your heart before you join  
A team to hurt your brother  
  
If there's a way to lead us from this  
Like in troubled times  
It won't be found through blood and hate  
But through courageous minds
