Here we go again  
She's back in town again  
I'll take her back again one more time  
Here we go again  
The phone will ring again  
I'll be her fool again one more time  
  
I've been there before  
And I'll try it again  
But any fool knows  
That theres no way to win  
  
Here we go again  
She'll brake my heart again  
But any fool knows  
That theres no way to win  
  
Here we go again  
She'll brake my heart again  
I'll play the part again one more time  
  
I'll take her back again  
Just one more time
