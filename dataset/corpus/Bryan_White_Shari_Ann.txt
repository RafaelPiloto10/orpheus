You got the power, you got the mind  
You got the skills, Baby, I ain't lyin'  
They way you walk, the way you flirt  
Your baby talk could get a grown man hurt  
I might be wastin' my time  
But I know I'm losing my mind  
  
Shari Ann  
You don't have to try to make me blue  
"Cause you know you can, it comes so natural to you  
Shari Ann you don't have to play so hard to get  
I'm just a man, but honey I'm the match you never met  
  
Do you understand what I'm goin' through  
I'm in love with you  
I'll be your rock, I'll be your rock 'n' roll  
I'll be the serenade for your soul  
You're non-stop strong, comin' on  
You can carry me  
Shari Ann
