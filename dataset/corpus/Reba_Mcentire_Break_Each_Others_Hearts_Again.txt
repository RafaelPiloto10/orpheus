Do you still drink whiskey?  
Can I buy you a round?  
If nobody's sitting here, do you mind if I sit down?  
I was nervous when I saw you  
I almost walked away  
And now I can't believe what I'm about to say  
  
[Chorus:]  
These arms want to hold you  
These lips want to kiss you  
These eyes are glad to see you  
Well baby I miss you  
Let's drive each other crazy  
Like we did back then  
Why don't we get together  
And break each other's hearts again  
  
Maybe I've had one too many  
I don't want to say too much  
We both know the reasons  
Why we didn't keep in touch  
We're no good for each other  
Still its hard to let it go  
I'm trying to be strong, but babe you've got to know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Loving you should be the last thing on my mind  
It feels so good to let you hurt me one more time  
  
[Chorus]
