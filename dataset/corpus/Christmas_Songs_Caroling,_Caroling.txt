Caroling, caroling, now we go  
Christmas bells are ringing  
Caroling, caroling thru the snow  
Christmas bells are ringing  
  
Joyous voices sweet and clear  
Sing the sad of heart to cheer  
Ding dong, ding dong  
Christmas bells are ringing  
  
Caroling, caroling thru the town  
Christmas bells are ringing  
Caroling, caroling up and down  
Christmas bells are ringing  
Mark ye well the song we sing  
Gladsome tidings now we bring  
Ding dong, ding dong  
Christmas bells are ringing!  
  
Caroling, caroling, near and far  
Christmas bells are ringing  
Following, following yonder star  
Christmas bells are ringing  
Sing we all this happy morn  
"Lo, the King of heav'n is born!"  
Ding dong, ding dong  
Christmas bells are ringing
