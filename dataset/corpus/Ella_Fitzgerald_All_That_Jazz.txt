I'm in love with you  
And all that jazz  
You're my dream come true  
And all that jazz  
Baby, you're too much  
You've got the skin I love to touch  
The skin I love to touch too much, mmm  
And all that jazz  
You have got the lips that suit my taste  
And your fingertips can't be replaced  
Oh, baby, what you've got, nobody has  
And I've got you  
And all that jazz  
(Improvisation)  
  
I said I'm in love with you  
And all that jazz  
You're my dream come true  
And all that jazz  
Baby, you're too much  
You've got the skin I love to touch  
The skin I love to touch too much, mmm  
And all that jazz  
You have got the lips that suit my taste  
And your fingertips can't be replaced  
Oh, baby, what you've got, nobody has  
And I've got you  
And all that jazz
