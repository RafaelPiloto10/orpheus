I said that I felt jailed up  
As if our doors were nailed up  
I said I needed separate places,  
Parties, room to move around in.  
I said I needed my fling  
Had to get out and do some other thing.  
It took me months to calculate  
That I had nothing left without you-  
  
[Chorus]  
Dan, my fling is all flung out  
Now I've got to fall back on dreams  
  
I thought I'd try and write you  
I thought I'd try and phone you  
I thought I'd try to tell you  
That I smell your hair still on my pillow  
But you'd just mile to please me  
You'd shake your head, you'd tease me -  
Remind me it was I who first claimed  
That we both required freedom  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'd dream up schemes to meet you,  
I'd nonchalantly greet you,  
I'd ask you up for coffee  
Anytime you had an hour open.  
You say you like my hair long,  
You ask me if I've written any new songs,  
You'd laugh, you'd turn and cross the street  
And leave me dizzy with your laughter -  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I hear you're leaving this town,  
You and some girl gonna travel around,  
You bought a car with foldback seats,  
you'll camp out by the lakes and forests.  
I lie alone in our old bed,  
Your laughter it's echoin' inside my head.  
I close my eyes, I smell your hair  
It's like I haven't slept in years -  
  
[Chorus]
