Blue skies  
Smiling at me  
Nothing but blue skies  
Do I see  
  
Bluebirds  
Singing a song  
Nothing but bluebirds  
All day long  
  
Never saw the sun shining so bright  
Never saw things going so right  
Noticing the days hurrying by  
When you're in love, my how they fly  
  
Blue days  
All of them gone  
Nothing but blue skies  
From now on  
  
Nothing but blue skies  
Do I see  
  
Bluebirds  
Singing a song  
Nothing but bluebirds  
All day long  
  
Never saw the sun shining so bright  
Never saw things going so right  
Noticing the days hurrying by  
When you're in love, my how they fly  
  
Blue days  
All of them gone  
Nothing but blue skies  
From now on
