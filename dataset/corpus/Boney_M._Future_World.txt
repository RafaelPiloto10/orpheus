I know a place we all can go  
Don't wanna live here anymore  
I see a planet slowly die  
And I get tired of wondering why  
Come and join the right future world  
Don't you wanna be free and alive  
Come and join the right future world  
To a world where we all can survive  
Get on board and fly with me  
To the future world (future world)  
To let our children grow up there in peace  
We can live in harmony  
In another world (another world)  
10.000 light years away  
10.000 light years away  
Get on board and fly with me  
To the future world (future world)  
We can build a better world up there  
Love is not just make-believe  
In another world (another world)  
10.000 light years away  
10.000 light years away  
10.000 light years away  
10.000 light years away  
Don't waste the precious life away  
The spaceship's taking off today  
Leave your belongings all behind  
Everything you need is in your mind  
Get on board and fly with me  
To the future world (future world)  
We can build a better world up there  
Love is not just make-believe  
In another world (another world)  
10.000 light years away  
10.000 light years away  
10.000 light years away  
10.000 light years away  
10.000 light years away...
