And it happens every time  
Give my love, she leaves me behind  
Yes, it happens every time  
The sorrow makes me lose my mind  
If she'd only be as true as I am  
And listen to my love that's sayin'  
Oh baby, won't you stay mine  
Your lovin' makes me feel so fine  
And someday baby you'll find  
My love was gentle and kind  
Someday you'll know that leaving me was wrong  
But don't bother all that time is gone  
And it happens every time  
Now I know it's not worth the tryin'  
So baby, don't turn around  
Let my tears fall to the ground  
If she'd only be as true as I am  
And listen to my love that's sayin'
