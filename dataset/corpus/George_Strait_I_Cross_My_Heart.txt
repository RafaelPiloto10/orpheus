Our love is unconditional  
We knew it from the start  
I can see it in your eyes  
You can feel it from my heart  
  
From here on after  
Let's stay the way we are right now  
And share all the love and laughter  
That a lifetime will allow.  
  
[Chorus]  
I cross my heart  
And promise to  
Give all I've got to give  
To make all your dreams come true  
In all the world  
You'll never find  
A love as true as mine  
  
You will always be the miracle  
That makes my life complete  
And as long as there's a breath in me  
I'll make yours just as sweet  
  
As we look into the future  
It's as far as we can see  
So let's make each tomorrow  
Be the best that it can be  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And if along the way we find a day  
It starts to storm  
You've got the promise of my love  
To keep you warm  
  
In all the world  
You'll never find  
A love as true as mine  
A love as true as mine
