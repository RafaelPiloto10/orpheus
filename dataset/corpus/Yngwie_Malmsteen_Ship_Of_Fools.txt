When the rats are bailing out  
And you are just signing on  
Then you turned and walked away  
There is no love lost here, my friend  
But you have made a great mistake  
You ate the hook, the sink and bait  
Now you can't get out  
It's much too late  
The ship of fools keep sailing on  
The ship of fools keep sailing on  
And on and on and on  
But I can be merciless for sure  
And you'll sail for many moons  
I can't believe you lost your mind  
I'll watch you falling down, again  
You have been living in a dream  
And I can hear the same old theme  
But nothing's ever what it seems  
The ship of fools keep sailing on  
The ship of fools keep sailing on  
The ship of fools keep sailing on  
And on and on and on  
The truth is always hard to face  
Especially when you are in that place,  
Like the ship of fools  
The ship of fools keep sailing on  
The ship of fools keep sailing on  
The ship of fools keep sailing on  
And on and on and on  
The ship of fools keep sailing on  
The ship of fools keep sailing on  
The ship of fools keep sailing on  
And on and on and on
