It's just the sun that's shinin' in your eyes.  
It's just the moon that is the sun's disguise.  
Just the sky, with clouds a blowin' by.  
The sun and the moon and the sky, and you and I.  
  
It's just the rain that's rollin' down my cheek.  
It's just the wind that makes me hear you speak.  
It's just the song that anyone can sing.  
The rain and the wind and the song and the love you bring.  
  
It's just the world that gonna break your heart.  
It's just the past that's tearin' us apart.  
It's just the time we have so little of.  
The world and the past and the time that we fell in love.  
  
It's just the sun that's shinin' in your eyes  
It's just the moon that is the sun's disguise  
It's just the sky, with clouds a blowin' by  
The sun and the moon and the sky, and you and I.
