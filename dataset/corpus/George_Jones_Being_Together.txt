Being together as two friends  
This all our love has ever been  
Now even our friendship has gone  
When we're together we're all alone.  
  
Being together to forget  
The ones we loved before we met  
But now their mem'ries linger on  
When we're together we're all alone.  
  
Being together all this time  
With someone else on our mind  
For them our love grew stronger as time went by  
When we're together we're all alone...
