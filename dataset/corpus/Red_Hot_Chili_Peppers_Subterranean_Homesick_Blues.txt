Johnny's in the basement mixing up the medicine  
I'm on the pavement thinking about the government  
The man in the trench coat, badge out, laid off,  
Says he's got a bad cough: wants to get it paid off  
God knows when but you're doin' it again!  
You better duck down the alleyway lookin'for a new friend  
The man in the coonskin cap by the big pen  
Wants eleven dollar bills: you only got ten  
Look out, kid  
Look out, kid, it's somethin' that you did  
Look out, kid, 'cause they keep all hid  
Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot  
Talkin' at the heat put plants in the bed but  
The phone's tapped anyway, Maggie says that many say  
They must bust in early may  
Orders from the D.A.  
Walk on your tip toes, don't try "no doz"  
Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose  
Keep a clean nose, watch the plain clothes  
You don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows  
Look out, kid  
Look out, kid, it's somethin' that you did  
Look out, kid, 'cause they keep all hid  
Looks to me like you did  
A little to much hittin' kid  
You should've took it to the bridge  
Before you started to skid  
Look out, kid  
The good god willin', we'll bebop to Bob Dylan  
Chillin' 'em, thrillin' 'em, and red hot killin' 'em  
Killin' 'em  
Get sick, get well, hand around a ink well  
Ring bell, hard to tell if anything is goin' to sell  
Try hard, get barred, get back, write braille  
Get jailed, jump bail, join the army, if you fail  
But users, cheaters, six time losers  
Hand around the theaters  
Girl by the whirlpool lookin' for a new fool  
Don't follow leaders, watch the parkin' meters  
Look out, kid  
Look out, kid, it's somethin' that you did  
Look out, kid, 'cause they keep all hid
