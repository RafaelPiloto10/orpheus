Do I want to be with you  
As the years come and go?  
Only forever  
If you care to know.  
Would I grant all your wishes  
And be proud of the task  
Only forever  
If someone should ask.  
How long would it take me  
To be near if you beckon?  
Off hand I would figure  
Less than a second.  
Do you think I'll remember  
How you looked when you smile?  
Only forever  
That's puttin' it mild.
