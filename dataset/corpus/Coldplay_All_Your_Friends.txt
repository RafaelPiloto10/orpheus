On and on  
You're told which side you're on  
You're forced, you're thrown  
To become the sythe to cut the corn  
  
And all Your friends  
They ride into the suset  
Fly into the sunset  
And away they blow  
  
All your friends  
They ride into the sunset  
Fly into the sunset  
And away they're thrown  
Into the fire  
  
Ten below  
The call comes on the radio  
Over you go  
And in the red now all the rivers flow  
The poppies grow  
  
All your friends  
They ride into the sunset  
Fly into the sunset  
And away they blow  
  
All your friends  
They ride into the sunset  
Ride into the sunset  
And they're taken home  
  
Open fire  
Open fire  
  
Open fire  
Open fire  
And fire  
As they ride fire
