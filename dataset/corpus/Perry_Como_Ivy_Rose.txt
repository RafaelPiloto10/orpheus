Ivy Rose, Ivy Rose, I'm in love with you  
Cling to me, cling to me like a vine  
I'll be yours when tonight is a memory  
I'll be yours and you'll always be mine.  
  
As the years disappear in the twilight of time  
With a sigh we will fondly recall  
All the plans that we made, how we kissed unafraid  
In the shade of the old ivy wall  
  
Ivy Rose, Ivy Rose, I'm in love with you  
Cling to me, cling to me like a vine  
I'll be yours when tonight is a memory  
I'll be yours and you'll always be mine.  
  
Hand in hand as we stand 'neath the old campus moon  
Make believe that tomorrow is here  
Picture me close to you in a dream house for two  
Where the ivy grows greener each year  
  
Ivy Rose, Ivy Rose, I'm in love with you  
Cling to me, cling to me like a vine  
I'll be yours when tonight is a memory  
I'll be yours and you'll always be mine.
