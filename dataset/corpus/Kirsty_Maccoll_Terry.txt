Why'd you never listen to me?  
I could be invisible to you  
Anyway it doesn't matter now  
'cause I have met somebody new  
Sorry if your heart is broken  
Why's your mouth just hanging open?  
Don't look so surprised  
I found another guy  
Terry wants my photograph  
Terry says our love will last forever  
And he should know  
That boy terry's not the kind  
To mess around and change his mind  
Terry is as tough as marlon brando  
Now he's waiting for me  
I just had to break the news to you  
You'd better hide your face a while  
If he gets mad there's no telling what he'll do  
You can see the door is open  
So if you don't want your nose broken  
You had better go away  
'cause terry's coming round today  
Terry wants my photograph  
Terry says our love will last forever  
And he should know  
(terry said he'll never let me go)  
That boy terry's not the kind  
To mess around and change his mind  
Terry is as tough as marlon brando  
He's been making eyes at me  
It started long ago  
So when he said he loved me  
I just had to say "I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I
know, I know, I know"  
You thought you were such a smartie  
But terry knows about karate  
There's other things he's good at too  
Terry's not a bit like you  
And terry wants my photograph  
Terry says our love will last forever  
And he should know  
(terry said he'll never let me go)  
That boy terry's not the kind  
To mess around and change his mind  
Terry is as tough as marlon brando
