Haven't you heard it could be coming tonight  
Just leave all your things and come and celebrate life  
This time is for love, not for heartache and strife  
There's no time for games and there's no time to fight  
  
Just feel all the love that is in the air,  
The feeling so good and it's everywhere,  
So come on along if you heart's feeling right,  
Just open your wings it's a natural flight  
  
You can do what you want, you can say I'm a fool,  
And I'll see you in another life  
See you in another life  
  
He walked on this earth so we can party tonight,  
He taught us of faith 'cause it's not about sight  
He taught us of peace and unconditional love  
He led us from wrong and forave us there of  
  
He did all the things 'cause he wanted you  
He died on that cross so you wouldn't have to,  
And now all the worlds such a beautiful light,  
Just open your eyes it's a beautiful sight  
  
You can do what you want, you can say I'm a fool,  
And I'll see you in another life  
Another life, come on !  
  
You can do what you want, you can say I'm a fool,  
And I'll see you in another life  
See you in another life, oh yeah  
Another life  
  
See you in another life, another life  
See you in another life, oh yeah,  
Another life, see you in another life  
Take me higher higher, Oh yeah yeah  
  
Higher higher, higher yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah !  
Higher higher, Come on -(living? you sinners?) yeah  
Higher higher, higher yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
