Verse 1  
The earth can shake  
The sky come down  
The mountains all fall to the ground  
But I will fear none of these  
Shelter me Lord  
Underneath your wings  
Dark waters rise  
And thunders pound  
The wheels of war are going 'round  
And all the walls are crumbling  
Shelter me Lord  
Underneath your wings  
  
Chorus  
Shelter me Lord  
I need deep inside of your heart  
Shelter me Lord  
I need deep inside of your ways  
Shelter me Lord  
In you refuge cover me  
The world can shake but Lord I'm making you my hiding place  
  
[Verse 2:]  
The wind can blow  
The rain can pour  
The deluge breaks  
The tempest roars  
But in this storm  
My spirit sings  
Shelter me Lord  
Underneath your wings  
Shelter me Lord  
  
Verse 3  
On the day  
He'll call for me  
Someday when time  
No more shall be  
I'll say oh death  
Where is your sting  
When you shelter me Lord  
Shelter me Lord
