You never listen when I say  
Only need another day  
You never listen when I tell you what I tell you  
I'm thinking what I'm thinkin'  
Need a little time to keep the motor tickin' over now  
  
Only need another day  
Gotta find another way  
We got a problem 'cause I don't know what you're thinkin'  
You don't care what I'm feelin'  
We better work it out or else there's gonna be a showdown now  
  
Why do you do what you do to me?  
You got no clue what you do to me  
Try to say but you couldn't see  
What do come don't come easily  
Only need another day  
  
But it comes and it goes and everybody knows  
That I don't like it, no I don't like it  
And when it flows and when it starts to go  
Then I like it, I sure do like it  
I hope the day never comes you throw it all away  
I only need another day  
  
You never listen when I  
You never listen when I say  
I only need another day  
You never listen when I tell you what I tell you  
I'm thinking what I'm thinkin'  
I need a little time to keep the motor tickin' over now  
  
I don't believe that we can't agree  
But I ain't letting that bother me  
I tried to say but you couldn't see  
What do come should come easily  
I only need another day  
  
But it comes and it goes and everybody knows  
That I don't like it, no I don't like it  
And when it flows and when it starts to go  
Then I like it, I sure do like it  
I hope the day never comes you throw it all away  
  
Another day, I need another day  
Another day, I need another day  
Another day, I need another day
