[Rick Ross]Hello Good morning tell me what the lip read  
Pretty face, thin waist with the sick weave  
First time fish tailing in the 6 speed  
Real bad boy tell em come and get me  
I'm at the fight, been kinda like Bellmen  
Only took the trip to the truck twice  
Unpacked the Mac 11 and air max's  
Stuff six figures in my damn air mattress  
Uh, I'm in love with large bills  
A dime with a fat ass, thin waist and tall heels  
Yeah, it's the teflon Don,  
Hundred carrots in the charm tryna give it back to Sean.  
  
[Diddy]Hello, Good morning  
Lets go, lets ride,  
Hello, Good morning  
Hello, Good morning

'Cause I seen you watching  
So lets go  
Lets get it popping  
  
[Dirty money]Cause I've been leaning on the bar  
Looking cleaner than the star  
All these broads wont give me my props  
25 on the bank I be stunting on there ass  
And they mad cause the bitch won't stop  
  
[Diddy - Dirty Money- Chorus]Got your boyfriend feeling like a groupie  
(You know, you know, we know, we on that)  
Stuntin like you looking like a movie  
(You know, you know, we know, we on that)  
And everybody know who the truth be  
(You know, you know, we know, we on that)

(You know, you know, we know, we on that)  
Hello  
  
[Nicki Minaj]I came up in it a little bit self centered  
But did I kill a Queen  
Alexander Mcqueen's got a wrist on glow  
The bottles is on po'  
Got that shibby shibby yeah shibby yeah ayou!  
What the fuck I look like bitch I run this town  
I aint coming out for less than a 100 thou  
Man, the last time I checked I was bubbling out  
Got to turn down shows, out in Dublin now  
  
Wait wait hold on, maybe they didn't get that here  
Like 11 hundred horses when I switch that gear  
Swerve on them sorta like I missed that dear  
Press that little button on the sit back chair  
B-tch I do it cause I get it  
I got billion dollar credit  
If you got a million dollars you could put it up in debit  
I just be like hello hello but I never could salute them  
Young money I do it for the yout dem!  
  
[Diddy]Hello, Good morning  
Lets go, lets ride,  
Hello, Good morning  
Hello, Good evening  
You blow, you feindin'  
'Cause you know that your really needed  
And I'm the one that you wanna be with  
But right now baby you dreaming  
Wake up and turn the lights off  
  
[Chorus:]  
[Diddy]Hello, Good morning  
Lets go, lets work,  
Hello, Good morning  
Lets go, lets work,

Your baby momma cry for me like Jodeci  
So how you not notice me  
Pull up to the club in the coldest V  
Ugh. Literally though little did he know how that nigga Diddy flow  
How that nigga Diddy go so hard like a crowbar still getting dough  
Woah, woah, woah

[Chorus][End]
