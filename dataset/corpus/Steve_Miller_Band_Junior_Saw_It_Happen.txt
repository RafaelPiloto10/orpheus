My sweet child was seen across town  
With some stranger man  
She had a smile on her face, looked out of place  
Suitcase was in her hand  
Junior saw it happen  
Why didn't I listen to you? Hey  
Whoa, ohh, whoa  
Could've had her back  
Whoa, ohh, whoa  
Now she's down the tracks with him  
I remember on the day she left me  
That's one thing I'll never forget  
In the apartment we owned, all she left was a phone  
And a broken down TV set  
Junior saw it happen  
Why didn't I listen to you? Hey  
Whoa, ohh, whoa  
Could've had her back  
Whoa, na na na na na, whoa  
Now she's down the tracks with him  
Didn't believe it when I first got word  
But boy, I sure do now  
I couldn't face it, my mind wouldn't take it  
It didn't make sense somehow  
Because I thought you was happy with the way we lived  
And the things that we used to do  
Whoa, no no no, whoa  
Had her back  
Whoa, no no no no no no no, whoa  
Now she's down the tracks with him
