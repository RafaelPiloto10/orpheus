If your love for me is just temporary  
I'd rather not know  
Just let me make believe a while  
  
And if I'm not in your plans for a lifetime  
I'd rather not know  
Just let me make believe a while  
  
Just like a child at play  
I'll make believe you'll stay  
And if you go away  
I'll always miss my best playmate  
  
So if your sweet kiss is just for the moment  
I'd rather not know  
Just let me make believe a while  
Just let me make believe a while
