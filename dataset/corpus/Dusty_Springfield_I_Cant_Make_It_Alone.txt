Now you know me  
You know how proud I am  
And what I'm gonna tell you now  
Won't be easy to say  
  
Before I left your side  
Ooh, I was so happy then  
But I've been so lonely  
Since I've been away  
Oh, baby  
  
I've tried and I know I can't make it alone  
It's such a hard way to go  
I just can't make it alone  
There's something in my soul  
That will always  
Lead me back to you  
  
What can I say now?  
Sorry is just not good enough  
I couldn't blame you if you hurt me now  
The way I hurt you then  
  
But who else can I turn to?  
Oh, baby, I'm begging you  
Won't you reach out for my dying soul?  
And make me live again  
Oh, baby, it's so hard  
  
I've tried and I know I can't make it alone  
It's such a hard way to go  
I just can't make it alone  
There's something in my soul  
That will always  
Lead me back to you  
  
Baby, help me  
I've tried and I know I can't make it alone  
It's such a hard way to go  
And I can't make it alone  
There's something in my soul  
That will always  
Lead me back to you  
  
Oh, help me  
(Please help me)  
You know I need you  
(I need you)  
I'm saying that I need you  
I just can't make it by myself  
(I just can't make it by myself)  
I just can't make it all alone  
(I just can't make it all alone)  
I just can't make it by myself  
(I just can't make it by myself)  
Come on baby
