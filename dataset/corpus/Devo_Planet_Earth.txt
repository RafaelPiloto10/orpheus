I heard a girl in a dress  
Say her face was a mess  
I heard there's no reason why  
I heard that now's the time to buy  
  
On planet earth  
I'll probably stay  
On planet earth  
It's a place to live your life  
  
Where pleasure follows pain  
People go insane  
Fly around in planes  
Pray that it won't rain  
Drive around in cars  
Get drunk in local bars  
Dream of being stars  
Well I lived all my life on planet earth  
  
I saw a girl lose all control  
When she lost her new mink stole  
I saw her try to catch a man  
Things I couldn't understand  
  
On planet earth  
I'll probably stay  
On planet earth  
It's a place to live your life  
  
Where pleasure follows pain  
People go insane  
Fly around in planes  
Pray that it won't rain  
Drive around in cars  
Get drunk in local bars  
Dream of being stars  
Well I lived all my life on planet earth  
  
I saw a man on a stage  
Scream put me back in my cage  
I saw him hang by his tie  
I saw enough to make me cry  
On planet earth  
On planet earth  
  
I lived all my life on planet earth  
I lived all my life on planet earth  
On planet earth  
(repeat)
