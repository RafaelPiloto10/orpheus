Yellow canary, tennis bracelet necklace, knahmsayin?  
Three quarter black mink, shades, canaries in both ears  
Knahmsayin? Black Phantom, triple black, with the oak wood  
Gucci shoes, that's how I play  
  
Hold up, I don't gamble, I don't play no craps  
I was taught early on don't jeopardize the stacks  
Before I open my mouth, I get all the facts  
I could never fall off, it's too many hot tracks  
I'm affiliated with too many hot cats  
To end up, crawlin' out of a hole in Iraq  
Try to topple my regime  
You end up in need of a scalpel to your spleen  
Is there a medic on the scene?  
Easy children, Queens is in the buildin'  
That blank look on your grill'll get filled in  
Slow down baby, you actin' like a clown homes  
You get your fronts remodeled like a brownstone  
You hear my heat rock comin' through your sheetrock  
It means you're OD'n homeboy, here come the detox  
I get my swagger on, proud as a peacock  
Bars is hot, beats is pumpin' like a ? box  
  
[Chorus]  
Shake it baby shake it  
If you a real O.G. put your hands in the air with me, c'mon  
Shake it baby shake it  
Young ladies in the spot, if you came up in the place to rock, c'mon  
Shake it baby shake it  
Divided we fall, stay together and forever we ball, c'mon  
Shake it baby shake it  
You do it for the gangsters  
I do it for the ladies, but it's all money baby  
  
They pay me so much it's hard for them to swallow  
When you got 'em by the balls, their hearts and minds follow  
Pay yourself first, that's one of my main mottos  
Picture Bill Gates on the block dodgin' hollows  
I can't see it player that's beneath my vision  
I'm beyond focused, every decision is made with precision  
It seems like greed's the world religion  
But L want cake, save the crumbs for the pidgeons  
Black man, get the flies outcha eyes  
You can't 'cause where you born but you affect where you die  
Until that day, health and welfare, cheers  
And after my wake, the hood'll talk, man listen here  
He kept a mink and canaries in his ears  
Like the Enterprise rollin' over stars for years  
Spit bars for years, kept hot cars for years  
The dice was loaded but he beat the odds for years, uh-huh!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To be or not to be the man, that's the question  
Got a vision in my mind, I can see that I'm destined  
To lean up in the backseat, givin' directions  
Sweep the block clean as November elections  
On the Blackberry readin' cash flow quadrant  
Brim to the side, my gorillas is bonded  
CLS Vision, four Humers behind it  
You forgot I'm from Queens? You can get reminded  
I'm a man's man, when you chumps gon' learn  
If you play with fire you get poured in a urn  
You must have been puffin on blunts of sherm  
All my albums is platinum, it's been confirmed  
I'm more than a symbol of sex, I get respect  
For livin' in the hills but still keepin' it mad real  
Stay on course, the boss crush obstacles  
You burnin' me, two words: I'm-possible  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Like I said  
Yellow canary tennis on the neck  
Three quarter black mink  
Gucci hat to the side, shades  
Gucci shoes, baggy jeans  
Black Phantom, oak wood  
That's how I play  
Yeah  
(Shake it baby shake it)  
You do it for the gangsters  
I do it for the ladies, but it's all money baby
