I don't have to tell you  
What this is all about  
'Cause baby half the fun  
Is in us figuring it all out  
  
So why you gotta ask me  
What I'm doing now  
'Cause I don't like to question  
What I still haven't found  
  
So don't turn off the lights  
I don't want to be  
In the dark tonight  
'Cause I can't read your mind  
I need to know if  
What I'm doing is right  
So Don't turn off the lights  
So Don't turn off the lights  
  
So tell me how  
We're gonna get there  
It's hard to even try  
But if we move together  
We'll end up on the same side  
  
So don't turn off the lights  
I don't want to be  
In the dark tonight  
'Cause I can't read your mind  
I need to know if  
What I'm doing is right  
So Don't turn off the lights  
So Don't turn off the lights  
  
If you could know  
What I'm feeling  
Would you run and  
Where would you go  
If you want to know  
What I'm thinking  
Then just turn on the lights  
And you'll know  
  
So don't turn off the lights  
I don't want to be  
In the dark tonight  
'Cause I can't read your mind  
I need to know if  
What I'm doing is right  
So Don't turn off the lights  
  
So don't turn off the lights  
I don't want to be  
In the dark tonight  
'Cause I can't read your mind  
I need to know if  
What I'm doing is right  
So Don't turn off the lights  
So Don't turn off the lights  
So Don't turn off the lights  
So Don't turn off the lights  
  
(Don't turn off the lights)
