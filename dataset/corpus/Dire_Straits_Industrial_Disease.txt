The watchdog's got rabies the foreman's got fleas  
And everyone's concerned about Industrial Disease  
There's panic on the switchboard tongues are in knots  
Some come out in sympathy some come out in spots  
Some blame the management some the employees  
Everybody knows it's the Industrial Disease

They want to have a war to keep their factories  
They want to have a war to keep us on our knees

They want to have a war to stop Industrial Disease  
They're pointing out the enemy to keep you deaf and blind  
They want to sap your energy, incarcerate your mind

Meanwhile the first Jesus says 'I'd cure it soon  
Abolish Monday mornings and Friday afternoons'  
The other one's out on hunger strike he's dying by degrees  
How come Jesus gets Industrial Disease?
