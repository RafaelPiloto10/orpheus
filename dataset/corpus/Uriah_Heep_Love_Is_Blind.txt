I tried to give you love  
That was ever flowing  
I tried to give a love  
That could be so true  
But you wanted less  
Than I had to offer  
What was I to do  
I tried to bare a soul  
That would swear devotion ?  
I tried to promise dreams  
I would make come true  
But you said that love was  
A game for children  
Here I stand, a fool  
  
Love is blind  
Blinded by love  
You're all I can see in my eyes  
My mind says, stop  
But my heart says, go  
And oh, how it hurts to find  
It's true when they say that  
Love is blind  
Love is blind  
  
I told myself if there  
Was a chance to show you  
Just how good a love affair could be  
But love was something that  
You had never given  
I just couldn't see  
I closed my eyes to all that  
You never gave me  
? my heart didn't wanna see  
How you played around  
And how well you showed me  
How wounded love can be  
  
Love is blind  
Blinded by love  
You're all I can see in my eyes  
My mind says, stop  
But my heart says, go  
Oh, how it hurts to find  
It's true when they say that  
Love is blind  
Love is blind  
So blind
