He love your sexy body, he loves your dirty mind  
He loves when you hold him when you grab him from behind  
Oh baby, youre such a pretty thing  
I cant wait to introduce you to the other members of my gang  
  
You dont need no wax job, youre smooth enough for me  
If you need you oil changed Ill do it for you free  
Oh baby, the pleasure would be all mine  
If you let me drive your pickup truck and park it where the  
Sun dont shine  
  
Every time he touches you his hair stands up on end  
His legs begin to quiver and his mind begins to bend  
Oh baby, youre such a tasty treat  
But Im under doctors orders, Im afraid to overeat  
  
He love your sense of humor, your disposition too  
Theres absolutely nothing that he dont love about you  
Oh baby, Im on my hands and knees  
Life would be so simple if I only had you to please  
  
Oh baby, turn around and say goodbye  
You go to the airport now and Im going home to cry  
  
He loves your...
