Lazy lightnin' sleepy fire in your eyes it's like desire in disguise  
I keep on tryin' but I, I can't get through  
Lazy lightnin' I'd like to find the proper potion  
That's gonna capture your emotion  
You're right beside me but I, I can't get through  
You're a loop of lazy lightnin', just a loop of lazy lightnin'  
Must admit you're kinda frightnin' but you really get me high  
So exciting, when I hear your velvet thunder  
You seem so near I start to wonder  
Would you come closer if, if I asked you to?  
So inviting, the way you're messing with my reason  
It's an exception but it's pleasing  
Tell me a lie and I will swear, I'll swear it's true  
You're a loop of lazy lightnin'  
(Lazy lightnin')  
Just a loop of lazy lightnin'  
(Lazy lightnin')  
Must admit you're kinda frightening  
Just a loop of lazy lightnin'  
Put the fire in my eyes  
(Lightnin')  
Put the fire every time  
(Lightnin')  
Put the fire in my heart  
(Lightnin')  
Well come on lazy lightnin'  
Just a loop of lazy lightnin'  
Misty lightning, well you always electrify me  
Someday I know you'll satisfy me  
And all that lightnin' will be my lightnin' too  
My lightnin' too  
(My lightnin' too)  
Just a loop of lazy lightnin'  
(My lightnin' too)  
My lightnin' too  
(My lightnin' too)  
Just a loop of lazy lightnin'  
(My lightnin' too)  
My lightnin' too  
(My lightnin' too)  
Oh come on lazy lightnin'  
(My lightnin' too)
