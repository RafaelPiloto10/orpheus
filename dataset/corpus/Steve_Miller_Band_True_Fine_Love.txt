I ain't complainin'  
But I'd sure like to find me  
A true, fine love  
Someone another  
That's as sweet as your mother  
A true, fine love  
  
Cause the time is right  
For walking in the moonlight  
I have suddenly found I'm ready to settle down  
So come on get your rocks off  
I'm gonna knock your socks off  
  
You'll see, oh yeah  
So come on pretty baby  
We're going to raise a family  
  
There'll be no hesitatin'  
Cause I'm so tired of waitin'  
For a true, fine love  
Someone another  
Like a sister or brother  
A true, fine love  
  
Cause the time is right  
For walking in the moonlight  
I have suddenly found I'm ready to settle down  
So come on get your rocks off  
I'm gonna knock your socks off  
  
You'll see, oh yeah  
So come on pretty baby  
We gonna raise a family  
  
Well I ain't complainin'  
But I'd sure like to find me  
A true, fine love  
Someone another  
That's as sweet as your mother  
A true, fine love  
  
Cause the time is right  
For walking in the moonlight  
I have suddenly found I'm ready to settle down  
We'll have a boy for you, we'll have a girl for me  
Come on baby raise a family  
  
So come on get your socks off  
I'm gonna knock your rocks off  
You see  
Ooh yea
