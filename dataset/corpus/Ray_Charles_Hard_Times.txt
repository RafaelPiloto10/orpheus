My mother told me, before she passed away  
Said son when I'm gone don't forget to pray  
'Cause there'll be hard times, hard times, oh yeah  
Who knows better than I?  
  
Well, I soon found out, just what she meant  
When I had to pawn my clothes, just to pay my rent  
Talkin' 'bout hard times, hard times, oh yeah  
Who knows [Incomprehensible] better than I?  
  
I had a woman, Lord, who was always around  
But when I lost my money, then she put me down  
Talkin' 'bout hard times, you know those hard  
Yeah Lord, who knows better than I?  
  
Yeah Lord, yeah, one of these days  
There'll be no more sorrow, when I pass away  
And no more hard times, I said no more hard  
Yeah Lord, who knows, yeah Lord, better than I?
