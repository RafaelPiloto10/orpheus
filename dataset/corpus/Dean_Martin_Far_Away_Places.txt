Far away places with strange sounding names  
  
Far away over the sea  
  
Those far away places with strange sounding names  
  
Are calling, calling me  
  
Going to China or maybe Siam  
  
I want to see for myself  
  
Those far away places I've been reading about  
  
In a book that I took from the shelf  
  
I start getting restless whenever I hear  
  
The whistles of a train  
  
I pray for the day I can get under way  
  
And look for those castles in Spain  
  
Oh they call me a dreamer  
  
Well maybe I am  
  
But I know that I'm burning to see  
  
Those far away places with strange sounding names  
  
Calling, calling me
