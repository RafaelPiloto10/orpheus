No one can tell me just why it is  
That it always has to come to this  
Fix it up  
Throw it away  
I don't get it  
The price you pay  
there's no sense no matter what you say  
What sticks inside ain't gonna fade away  
Fix it up  
Throw it away  
I don't care  
It's the price you pay  
I'm fallin away  
I'm fallin away  
I'm fallin away  
I'm fallin away  
(can't make out this next part, but I think it's:  
You say don't pay  
You say don't pay)  
Too high  
Too low  
I'm fallin away  
I'm fallin away  
I'm fallin away  
I'm fallin away  
(Again, can't quite tell, but this time it sounds a lot more like:  
You say don't pay  
You say don't pay  
You say don't pay  
You say don't pay)  
(fading out)  
Fallin away  
Fallin away  
Fallin away  
Fallin away  
Fallin away  
Fallin away  
Fallin away  
Fallin away
