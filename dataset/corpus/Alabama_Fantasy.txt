Fantasy, midnight and you and me.  
Ecstasy, spirits running wild and free.  
Take me away, away.  
  
Outside on a blanket in the moonlight, it feels right with my arns around you
tight.  
Laying under heaven watching the stars okay while me and you and mother  
Nature drift away.  
  
Fantasy, midnight and you and me.  
Ecstasy, spirits running wild and free.  
Take me away, away.  
  
Fantasy, midnight and you and me.  
Ecstasy, spirits running wild and free.  
Fantasy, midnight and you and me.  
Ecstasy, spirits running wild and free.  
Take me away, away.  
Take me away, away.
