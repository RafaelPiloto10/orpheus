I've got the key to the highway  
I am bound to go  
I'm gonna roam this highway  
Till my dying day  
When the moon peeks over the mountain  
Honey, I'll be on my way  
I'm gonna roam this highway  
Till my dying day  
Give me one more, one more kiss, mama  
Just before I go  
'Cause when I leave here, baby  
I won't be back, no, I won't be back anymore  
To the highway  
Oh, Lord, I'm out and bound to go  
I'm gonna leave here running  
'Cause walking's much too slow
