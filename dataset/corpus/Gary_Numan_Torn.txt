Silently I wait alone for you  
I've got to put my fear back in its box  
Silently I feel you breathe on me  
And I hear mercy sigh and leave the room  
You could hurt me  
Take my breath away.  
Would you like that?  
You could rip me  
Leave me torn and cold.  
Would you like that?  
One More Sin. Make me unforgiven  
Silently, I turn and play begins  
I watch you smile  
Just like a dead things smiles  
Silently I lose and darkness comes  
I hear you laugh as God abandons me  
You could cut me  
Let me die for you.  
Would you like that?  
All I feel. Makes me unforgiven
