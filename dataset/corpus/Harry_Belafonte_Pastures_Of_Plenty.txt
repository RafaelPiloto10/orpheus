It's a mighty hard row that my poor hands have hoed  
My poor feet have traveled a hot dusty road  
Out of your dust bowl and westward we rolled  
Blue deserts so hot and your mountains so cold  
I wandered all over this green growing land  
Where ever your crops are I lend you my hands  
At the edge of your cities, you'll see me and then  
I come with the dust and I'm gone with the wind  
California, arizona, I worked on your crops  
North up to oregon to gather your hops  
I got beets from your ground  
I cut grapes from your vines  
To sat on our table's that light that sparkling wine  
  
Green pastures of plenty from dry desert ground  
From the grand coulee dam where the water runs down  
Every state of this union us migrants have been  
Oh we come with the dust and we're gone, gone,gone with  
The wind  
It's always we rambled that river and I  
All along your green valley's I'd work till I die  
I traveled this road until death lets me be  
Cause pastures of plenty must always be free  
I's a mighty hard row that my poor hands have hoed  
My poor feet have traveled a hot dusty road  
Edge of your cities you see me and then  
I come with the dust and I'm gone, gone, gone with the  
Wind
