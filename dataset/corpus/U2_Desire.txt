Yeah, lover I'm off the streets  
Gonna go where the bright lights  
And the big city meet  
With a red guitar, on fire  
Desire  
  
She's the candle  
Burning in my room  
I'm like the needle  
Needle and spoon  
Over the counter  
With a shotgun  
Pretty soon, everybody got one  
And the fever when I'm beside her  
Desire, Desire  
  
(Burning, Burning)  
  
She's the dollars  
She's my protection  
She's the promise  
In the year of election  
Sister, I can't let you go  
I'm like a preacher  
Stealing hearts at a traveling show  
For the love or money, money...?  
Desire...
