So you say  
I'm too quiet  
Holding things  
Up in my head  
  
I say so much  
But you don't buy it  
I don't want to wake up  
Alone in my head  
  
Oh say that you'll never go now  
Don't go  
Don't go  
  
[Chorus]  
I need a lot of you  
I want a lot of you  
I need a lot of you  
All of you  
  
I tend to think  
I'm getting nowhere  
I drag it out  
Whenever I can  
  
Someday  
I'll get back there  
And find the world  
You dropped from your hand  
  
Oh but some things you'll never show now  
I know  
I know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Watch you coming up  
Out on top now  
Watch you coming up  
  
[Chorus]
