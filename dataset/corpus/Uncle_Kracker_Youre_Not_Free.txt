I remember you like it was yesterday  
Remember the time you said you'd find me  
I remember the songs that you used to play  
I hear them still and it reminds me  
My runaway you know you've gone wrong for so long  
So glamorous at the outset  
Now you're almost done  
  
You're not free  
You're only lost  
Time to get home  
And count up the calls  
Livin' on dreams  
That never were real  
Get down to the touch  
Because you can't feel  
You're not free  
You're only lost  
  
Prayin' to God  
You've broken the chains  
One day you'll look back  
And think of my name  
All of your friends  
Pretend you're the best  
They run you around  
But they could care less  
They'll never see  
How good it could be  
No man like me  
They'll never know  
Just where it could go  
You think you're free  
  
You're not free  
You're only lost  
Time to get home  
And count up the calls  
Livin' on dreams  
That never were real  
Get down to the touch  
Because you can't feel  
You stumbled  
And you still don't see it  
The losers always think they can win  
You're never gonna wanna believe it  
You think you're gone  
But I see ya yeah  
  
You're not free  
You're only lost  
Time to get home  
And count up the calls  
Livin' on dreams  
That never were real  
Get down to the touch  
Because you can't feel  
  
You're not free  
You're only lost  
Time to get home  
And count up the calls  
Livin' on dreams  
That never were real  
Get down to the touch  
Because you can't feel  
  
You're not free  
You're only lost  
You're not free  
You're not free  
You're not free
