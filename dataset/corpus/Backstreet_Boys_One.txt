I'll be the one...  
  
I guess you were lost when I met you  
Still there were tears in your eyes  
So out of trust and I knew  
No more than mysteries and lies  
  
There you were, wild and free  
Reachin' out like you needed me  
A helping hand to make it right  
I am holding you all through the night  
  
Chorus  
I'll be the one  
Who will make all your sorrows undone  
I'll be the light  
When you feel like there's nowhere to run  
I'll be the one...  
  
To hold you and make sure that you'll be alright  
'Cause my faith is gone  
And I want to take you from darkness to light  
  
There you were, wild and free  
Reachin' out like you needed me  
A helping hand to make it right  
I am holding you all through the night  
  
Chorus - repea  
  
You need me like I need you  
We can share our dreams comin' true  
I can show you what true love means  
Just take my hand, baby please  
  
I'll be the one  
I'll be the light  
Where you can run  
To make it alright  
I'll be the one  
I'll be the light  
Where you can run  
  
Chorus - repeat  
  
I'll be the one  
I'll be the light  
Where you can run  
To make it alright  
I'll be the one  
I'll be the light  
Where you can run  
To make it all right  
I'll be the one  
To hold you  
And make sure that you'll be alright  
I'll be the one
