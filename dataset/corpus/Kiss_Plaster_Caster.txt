Baby's getting anxious, the hour's getting late  
The night is almost over, she can't wait  
  
Oh, things are complicating, my love is in her hands  
And there's no more waiting, she understands  
  
The plaster's gettin' harder and my love is perfection  
A token of my love for her collection, her collection  
  
Plaster caster, grab a hold of me faster  
And if you wanna see my love, just ask her  
And my love is the plaster  
And yeah, she's the collector  
She wants me all the time to inject her  
  
The plaster's gettin' harder and my love is perfection  
A token of my love for her collection  
  
Plaster caster, plaster caster  
Grab a hold of me faster, plaster, faster  
And if you wanna see my love, just ask her, ask her  
Go on, ask her  
  
The plaster's gettin' harder and my love is perfection  
A token of my love for her collection, her collection  
  
Plaster caster, plaster caster  
Grab a hold of me faster, plaster, faster  
If you wanna see my love, just ask her, ask her  
  
Plaster caster, plaster caster  
She wants my love to last her, last her, last her  
And she calls me by the name of master, master  
  
Plaster caster, plaster caster  
Grab a hold of me faster, plaster, faster  
If you wanna see my love, just ask her, ask her  
  
Plaster caster, plaster caster  
Grab a hold of me faster, plaster, faster  
And if you wanna see my love, just ask her, ask her  
Plaster caster, plaster caster
