The judge found me guilty of wrong doing  
And sentaced me to hang in mid-July  
He said to me "Your lifes a ruin"  
"If I was you I'd breake right down a cry"  
Well, Nobody seems to care I ain't guilty  
I never did the things they said I've done  
But I guess they have to hang somebody  
And It's looking like I'm gonna be the one  
So send my body home on a freight trian  
Don't worry none if I don't go 1st class  
Send my body home of a fright train  
So everyone can see me when I pass  
Don't worry none about no fancy funeral  
Cause it don't matter how they lay me down  
Just see they bury me out by Mama's Apple Tree  
And send my body back to my home town  
My Mama was a damm ahrd working woman  
And she tried to raise he kids without a fault  
The last thing sh said, she was on her dying bed was "Son, on't get in trouble
with the law"  
When the time comes to meet my maker  
I'm gonna try my very best  
To take it like a man  
When they ask if I have one request  
I'll just say "send my body home on a freight trian  
Don't worry none if I don't go 1st class  
Send my body home of a fright train  
So everyone can see me when I pass"  
"Don't worry none about no fancy funeral  
Cause it don't matter how they lay me down  
Just see they bury me out by Mama's Apple Tree  
And send my body back to my home town"
