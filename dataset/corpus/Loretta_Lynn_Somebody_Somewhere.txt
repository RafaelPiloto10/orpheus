Somebody, somewhere  
Don't know what he's missin' tonight.  
It must have all started with that darn'd old Late Show.  
It made me so lonely and sad.  
And to make it all better, I kept getting bluer,  
With each little drink that I had.  
So I tuned in a dj,  
Who played every sad song he owned.  
Lord, I need someone so, but everyone I know,  
Is away, bein' needed at home.  
Somebody, somewhere  
Don't know what he's missin' tonight.  
Lord, here sits a woman,  
Just lonesome enough to be right.  
For love 'em or leave 'em,  
How I need someone to hold tight.  
Somebody, somewhere  
Don't know what he's missin' tonight...
