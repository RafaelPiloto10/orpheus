Wish that I was on old Rocky Top  
Down in the Tennessee hills  
Ain't no smoggy smoke on Rocky Top  
Ain't no telephone bills  
  
Once I had a girl on Rocky Top  
Half bear, the other half cat  
Wild as a mink, but sweet as soda-pop  
I still dream about that.  
  
Rocky Top, you'll always be  
Home sweet home to me  
Good old Rocky Top  
Rocky Top, Tennessee  
Rocky Top, Tennessee  
  
Once two strangers climbed old Rocky Top  
Lookin' for a moonshine still  
Strangers ain't come down from Rocky Top  
Reckon they never will  
  
Corn won't grow at all on Rocky Top  
Dirt's too rocky by far  
That's why all the folks on Rocky Top  
Get their corn from jar  
  
Rocky Top, you'll always be  
Home sweet home to me  
Good old Rocky Top  
Rocky Top, Tennessee  
Rocky Top, Tennessee  
  
I've had years of cooped up city life  
Trapped like a dog in a pen  
All I know is it's a pity life  
Can't be simple again  
  
Rocky Top, you'll always be  
Home sweet home to me  
Good old Rocky Top  
Rocky Top, Tennessee  
Rocky Top, Tennessee  
Rocky Top, Tennessee
