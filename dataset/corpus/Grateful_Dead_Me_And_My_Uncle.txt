Me and my uncle went ridin' down  
To South Colorado, west Texas bound  
We stopped over in Santa Fe,  
that day on the pony, just about half way  
And you know it was the hottest part of the day  
  
I took the horses up to the stall  
Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all  
Three days in the saddle, You know my body hurt  
It being summer, I took off my shirt  
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt  
  
West Texas cowboys, they was all around,  
Wheat liquor and money, they loaded down,  
So soon after payday, no one seemed ashamed,  
You know my uncle, he starts playin' the game,  
Hey! A hollow jack and the winner take the hand.  
  
My uncle starts winning, the cowboys got sore,  
One of them called him, and then two more,  
Accused him of cheatin', oh no it couldn't be,  
I know my uncle he's as honest as me,  
And I'm as honest as a Denver man can be.  
  
One of them cowboys he starsts to draw,  
And I shot him down Lord, He never saw,  
Shot me another, Right then he hit the floor,  
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold,  
And we hightailed it down to Mexico.  
  
Now I love thoe cowboys, I love their gold,  
Love my uncle, God rest his soul,  
Taught me good Lord, Taught me all I know,  
Taught me so well, that I grabbed that gold, and  
I left his dead ass there by the side of the road
