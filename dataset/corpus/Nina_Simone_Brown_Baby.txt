Brown baby brown baby  
As you grow up I want you to drink from the plenty cup  
I want you to stand up tall and proud  
And I want you to speak up clear and loud  
Brown baby brown baby brown baby  
  
As years go by I want you to go with your head up high  
I want you to live by the justice code  
And I want you to walk down freedom's road  
You little brown baby  
  
So lie away lie away sleeping lie away singing  
Lie away sleeping lie away safe in my arms  
Till your daddy and you mama protect you  
And keep you safe from harm  
Brown baby  
  
It makes me glad you gonna have things that I never had  
When out of men's heart all hate is hurled  
Sweetie you gonna live in a better world  
Brown baby brown baby brown baby
