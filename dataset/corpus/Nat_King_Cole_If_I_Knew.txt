If I knew what the  
Nightingale sings in her song  
If I knew why the meadow  
Is sweet all day long  
If I knew how the  
Mockingbird trills to his dove  
His sad sweet secret of love  
Then I'd know how the  
Mountaintop reaches so high  
Then I'd know how the  
Moonlight softens a sigh  
Then I'd know how the  
Ramblers bloom as they do  
And at last, I'd know  
The secret of you  
Then I'd know how the  
Ramblers bloom as they do  
And at last, I'd know  
The secret of you
