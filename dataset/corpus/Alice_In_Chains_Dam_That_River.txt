I broke you in the canyon  
I drowned you in the lake  
You a snake that I would trample  
Only thing I'd not embrace  
Oh, you couldn't dam that river  
And maybe I don't give a damn anyway  
So you couldn't dam that river  
And it washed me so far away  
I pushed and then you stumbled  
I kicked you in the face  
You stare at me so hollow  
Got to keep that killin' pace  
Oh, you couldn't dam that river  
  
And maybe I don't give a damn anyway  
So you couldn't dam that river  
And it washed me so far away  
I burned the place around you  
I hit you with a rake  
You piss upon my candle  
So proving you're a fake  
Oh, you couldn't dam that river  
And maybe I don't give a damn anyway  
So you couldn't dam that river  
And it washed me so far away
