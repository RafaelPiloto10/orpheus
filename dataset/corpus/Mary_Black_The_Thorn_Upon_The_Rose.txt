It's taste was sweet like summer wine,  
the heart that beats in double time.  
So he waltzed right in, he bowled you over,  
and you're still reeling from the feeling when he's gone.  
The door is closed, the lock is turned,  
and all the memories and letters have been burned.  
  
So when you pick the handsome flower  
don't forget the thorn upon the rose  
It's cut is deep and it's scar lasts forever,  
it follows love wherever love goes.  
  
Just how we fall it's hard to know  
when what we feel we seldom show.  
So we show the parts we feel are best,  
we squirm around the edges trying to cover up the rest.  
You think you know him and he thinks the same,  
when underneath it all it's just a crazy guessing game  
  
So when you pick the handsome flower  
don't forget the thorn upon the rose!  
It's cut is deep and it's scar lasts forever  
it follows love wherever love goes.  
  
Win or lose it's just the same  
tears of joy tears of pain  
They're hand in hand, they come as one  
you'll never see the moon without the promise of the sun  
For all the bruises for all the blows  
I'd rather feel the thorn than to never see the rose  
  
So when you pick the handsome flower  
don't forget the thorn upon the rose  
It's cut is deep and it's scar lasts forever  
it follows love wherever love goes.  
  
It follows love wherever love goes.
