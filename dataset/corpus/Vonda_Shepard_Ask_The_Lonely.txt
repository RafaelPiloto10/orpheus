Just ask the lonely  
  
When you feel that need  
To make it all alone,  
Remember no one is thinking of,  
Going alone  
  
Just ask the lonely  
They know the hurt and pain,  
Of losing a love, you can never regain  
  
Just ask the lonely  
Just ask the lonely  
  
The young and foolish laugh at love (Woo hoo)  
So they run away (Woo hoo hoo hoo)  
Confident and sure that fate (Woo hoo)  
Will bring another love their way  
  
(Ah) But ask the lonely  
(Ah) How vainly a heart can yearn,  
(Ah) For losing a love that will never return  
  
Just ask the lonely  
Just ask the lonely  
They'll tell you  
  
Ooh, Woo hoo hoo hoo ooh  
  
(Ah) They'll tell you a story of sadness,  
(Ah) A story too hard to believe  
Ah, they'll tell you the loneliest one is me  
  
Just ask the lonely  
Just ask the lonely  
  
Ask me  
I'm the loneliest one you'll see  
  
Just ask the lonely
