Well, me and my buddies are goin' to a party tonight  
And we don't care if we ain't got no invite  
We don't care if our face don't fit  
Gonna grab a little whiskey, grab a little  
  
Gatecrash, gatecrash  
Get yourself ready for a real bash  
Hide your ladies,'cause we'll be talkin' trash  
Snort your cocaine, smoke your grass  
So get yourself ready for our gatecrash  
  
You don't really want to know but we're still going to appear  
We've got Elvis snarls and arrive in biker gear  
We don't care if you call the fuzz  
By the time they get there we'll be gone with a buzz  
  
Gatecrash, gatecrash  
Get yourself ready for a real bash  
Hide your ladies, we're gonna cause a smash  
Snort your cocaine, smoke your grass  
So get yourself ready for our gatecrash  
  
Gatecrash, gatecrash  
Get yourself ready for a real bash  
Hide your ladies, we're gonna move in fast  
Snort your cocaine, smoke your grass  
So get yourself ready for our gatecrash  
  
Well, me and my buddies are going to your party tonight  
We don't care if we got no invite  
We don't care if we cause a splash  
Gonna drink a lot of whiskey, grab a little  
  
Gatecrash, gatecrash  
Get yourself ready for a real bash  
Hide your ladies,'cause we'll be talkin' trash  
Snort your cocaine, smoke your grass  
So get yourself ready for our gatecrash
