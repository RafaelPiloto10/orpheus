I never knew  
How much I loved you  
I never knew  
How much I cared  
So I played  
  
Vicious Games, Vicious Games  
With different names, different names  
Vicious Games, Vicious Games  
With different names, different names  
  
I was afraid  
To go under  
Afraid to see  
When I closed my eyes  
  
Vicious Games, Vicious Games  
With different names, different names  
Vicious Games, Vicious Games  
With different names, different names  
  
I never knew  
How much I loved you  
I never knew  
How much I care  
I just played  
  
Vicious Games, Vicious Games  
With different names, different names  
Vicious Games, Vicious Games  
With different names, different names  
  
Now that you're gone  
And you have left me  
I had to learn  
I had to learn how much it hurts  
To play those Vicious Games  
  
Vicious Games, Vicious Games  
Different names, different names  
Vicious Games, Vicious Games  
Different names, different names  
  
Vicious Games, Vicious Games  
Different names, different names  
Vicious Games, Vicious Games  
Different names, different names
