When will you carry me home like the wounded star in the movie  
When will you carry me home take it back to the start when you knew me  
'Cause when you talk to me that way, I'll be a million miles away  
I guess it's just another day in love  
  
We're battleships, driftin' in our wee river  
Takin' hits, sinking it's now or never  
Overboard, drownin' in a sea of love and hate but it's too late  
Battleship down  
  
When will you figure it out that you aren't always right little darlin'  
When will you figure it out that it's not worth the fight little darlin'  
'Cause when you can't think what to say, you go and throw it all away  
I guess it's just another day in love  
  
We're battleships, driftin' in our wee river  
Takin' hits, sinking it's now or never  
Overboard, drownin' in a sea of love and hate but it's too late  
Battleship down  
  
But you're too smart and I'm too dumb  
With no heart in the middle  
  
We're battleships, driftin' in our wee river  
Takin' hits, sinking it's now or never  
Overboard, falling into the ocean  
Ship to shore, drownin' in a sea of love and hate but it's too late  
Battleship down
