Down deep inside  
There's a place in me I'm yearning to explore  
Look in my eyes  
And remember wine, the music and amour  
The days grow stronger and longer  
With every glance  
It's what a stare and the dance were  
To find romance  
While dancers dance so close  
Deep inside to our dream of dreams  
Our theme of themes  
Romance  
Yes I'm falling watch me falling  
Something warm is turning inside of me  
Something warm is burning inside of me
