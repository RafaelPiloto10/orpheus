Sent them a sign, sent them a sign, sent them a sign, but they closed their
eyes.  
  
Sent them a sign, sent them a sign, sent them a sign, but they closed their
eyes.  
  
But they closed their eyes...  
  
Nowhere to hide, nowhere to run  
He prophesied this day would come  
You can close your eyes when he sends you the sign  
You can just pretend that you have plenty of time  
But when you're caught in the eye of the storm  
  
Nowhere to turn as the thunder crashes  
So many time you were warned  
Now you're caught in the eye of the storm  
Apocalypse stands at the door  
You're caught in the eye of the storm  
  
Ages ago, voices so cruel  
"Noah" they cried, "You're such a fool"  
And still today, skeptics abound  
Until the water will cover the ground  
And they are caught in the eye of the storm  
  
Nowhere to turn as the thunder crashes  
So many time you were warned  
Now you're caught in the eye of the storm  
Apocalypse stands at the door  
You're caught in the eye of the storm  
  
You could give him your heart  
While you still have the time  
You can give him your soul  
You can give him your mind  
You can fall on your knees  
You could cry out "Save me"  
  
One day when the lightning crashes  
One day when the thunder rolls  
One day when apocalypse is standing knockin' at your door  
You'll be safe in the arms of Jesus  
You'll be safe forever more  
You'll be praising him forever  
What a glorious reward  
You'll be safe with the Lord  
Not caught in the eye of the storm  
  
Caught in the eye of the storm  
  
Nowhere to turn as the thunder crashes  
So many time you were warned  
Now you're caught in the eye of the storm  
Apocalypse stands at the door  
You're caught in the eye of the storm
