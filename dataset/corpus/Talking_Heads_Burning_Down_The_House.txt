Watch out you might get what you're after  
Cool baby strange but not a stranger  
I'm an ordinary guy  
Burning down the house  
  
Hold tight wait till the party's over  
Hold tight we're in for nasty weather  
There has got to be a way  
Burning down the house  
  
Here's your ticket pack your bag: time for jumpin' overboard  
Transportation is here  
Close enough but not too far,  
Maybe you know where you are  
Fightin' fire with fire  
  
All wet hey you might need a raincoat  
Shakedown dreams walking in broad daylight  
Three hun-dred six-ty five de-grees  
Burning down the house  
  
It was once upon a place sometimes I listen to myself  
Gonna come in first place  
People on their way to work baby what did you expect  
Gonna burst into flame  
Burning down the house  
  
My house's out of the ordinary  
That's might don't want to hurt nobody  
Some things sure can sweep me off my feet  
Burning down the house  
  
No visible means of support and you have not seen nuthin' yet  
Everything's stuck together  
I don't know what you expect staring into the TV set  
Fighting fire with fire
