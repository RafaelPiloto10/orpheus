Once I had a friend that I could count on  
So I thought  
Well so it seemed  
But times of need are not enough  
To prove your friendship to me now  
Once I saw a face that I believed in  
But a mask was all there was  
So who wears the masks and who wears the faces  
Well I guess I'll never know  
  
But as I stand here alone in a room full of people  
With nothing to say  
Beer on their minds, and smoke in the air  
Call them feiends but they just don't care  
  
Friend for life  
Such shallow words for broken minds  
Show me a friend for life  
Cause I'll be waiting for that day to arrive  
When I'll feel alive  
I'll be waiting for that day  
  
Once I found a love I had to know  
Now we might know each other just too well  
Cause when we're together we just can't get enough  
Or is it we just can't get what we want  
Once I saw a dream, I had to chase it  
Dreams quickly turn to reality  
Who's at fault in this game of yours and mine  
Well I guess I'll never know  
  
But as I sit here alone  
Think of the girl who came softly inside me  
The look in her eyes, the smell of her hair  
Call her my own but is she really there?  
  
Love for life  
Such noble words for noble minds  
Show me a love for life  
Cause I'll be waiting for that day to arrive  
When I'll feel alive  
I'll be waiting for that day  
  
Once I had a friend that I could count  
Times of need are not enough  
Once I found a love I had to know  
Now we might know each other just too well  
Once I saw a dream I had to chase  
Dreams quickly turn to reality  
Now let me close my eyes  
Because I don't want to see anything anymore
