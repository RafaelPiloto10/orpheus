Evil it's been here all along  
Good things they just seem to have come and gone  
In my life I have seen so much go wrong  
And there's only one way left for us to get along  
You got to bend a little one way or the other  
You got to leave your mind open to discover  
Seems I've been fightin' it all along  
You got to bend a little no matter which side you're on  
Or soon you'll be gone  
  
Papers they print it every day  
Housewife wraps the garbage then throws it away  
I don't guess she thinks they have that much to say  
But when the time is right she'll be the lady with so much to pay  
You got to bend a little one way or the other  
You got to leave your mind open to discover  
Seems I've been fightin' it all along  
You got to bend a little no matter which side you're on  
Or soon you'll be gone  
  
History it teaches much too well  
Nations had to rise up before they fell  
And my eyes see the story they're tryin' to tell  
And tonight I think I heard the final toll of the bell  
We better  
  
Bend a little one way or the other  
You got to leave your mind open to discover  
Seems I've been fightin' it all along  
You got to bend a little no matter which side you're on  
Or soon you'll be gone
