You the it girl, hey hey, my inspiration  
My compass spinnin', baby, it's the right destination, oh  
Oh come on, come on, give me what I came for  
I got treasure to hide, so let's keep it from the strangers, hey  
  
Your waves, they wash all over me  
Your tides, they pull me back to sea  
When you bite on my lip  
And hold my hand, and moan again, I'ma hold that ass  
When you kiss on my lips  
And hold my hand, and moan again, I'ma hold that ass  
  
You don't know, I've been missin' you  
Baby when you, go  
Only way you could do that girl to me
