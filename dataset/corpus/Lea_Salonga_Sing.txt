Sing, sing a song  
Sing out loud, sing out strong  
Sing of good things, not bad  
Sing out happy, not sad  
  
Sing, sing a song  
Make it simple  
To last your whole life long  
Don't worry if it's not good enough  
For anyone else to hear  
Just sing, sing a song  
  
La la la la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la  
  
[Chorus]  
Sing, sing a song  
Let the world sing along  
Sing of love there could be  
Sing for you and for me  
  
Sing, sing a song  
Make it simple  
To last your whole life long  
Don't worry if it's not good enough  
For anyone else to hear  
Just sing, sing a song  
(Just sing, sing a song)  
Just sing, sing a song  
  
La la la la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la [Repeat until fade]
