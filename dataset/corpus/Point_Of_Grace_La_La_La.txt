Words and music by brent wilson  
  
If a picture's worth a thousand words  
What are they?  
And since you're spirit intercedes for me  
What do you hear when I pray?  
'cause I'm finding it hard to find the word  
To let you know how my heart can hurt  
So I'll sing the tune  
And let you fill in the words  
  
(chorus)  
La la la  
La la la  
La la la...  
  
It's comforting to know  
My words aren't all you hear  
I can talk to you with laughter  
And I can talk to you in tears  
And I don't have to know just what to say  
For you to hear me when I pray  
So I'll sing a part and let you read my heart  
  
(repeat chorus)
