Across the ocean she's been waiting to hear  
If love's a secret to all the things she fears  
Was it tiptoe around my pillow talk  
They'll come the only boy she had with any thought  
  
The heart pretends I'm not so far away  
She said tomorrow and I'm here today  
  
I miss her now and I say it's only true  
I feel like I'm on the wrong side of the moon  
(Wrong side of the moon)  
  
I'm forgettin' to remember to forget  
All the memories locked in my head  
I'll be home then you'll hear what I say  
It seems forever started only yesterday  
My heart keeps time which passes very slow  
When you're lonely without a place to go  
I've got the lonesome ocean blues  
I feel like I'm on the wrong side of the moon  
(Wrong side of the moon)  
  
Across the ocean there's a heart that beats for me  
Beat, beating, waiting patiently  
Pulls us together when we're apart  
Keeps the devil from playing with your heart  
But I'll pretend we're not so far away  
I'm home tomorrow or maybe it's today  
Across the ocean there's nothing else to do  
It feels like you're on the wrong side of the moon  
(Wrong side of the moon) Wrong side of the moon  
(Wrong side of the moon)Wrong side of the moon  
(Wrong side of the moon)  
(Wrong side of the moon)  
(Wrong side of the moon)  
(Wrong side of the moon)
