I love you more than the first sunset  
The first star I saw I would surely bet  
So how could you ever, could you ever forget?  
  
You're here but you're gone  
It's in your eyes  
Somethings gone wrong  
You've stifled your cries  
You can't expect that I'll ever forget  
  
All the details of your mind you would tell me through the night  
After we'd made love and the way was so open  
Now you turn your back to me  
As if we'd never spoken  
  
But I still love you more than the first sunset  
I swear I caught a shooting star the first time we met  
So how could you ever  
I know that I'll never  
How could you ever, ever forget?
