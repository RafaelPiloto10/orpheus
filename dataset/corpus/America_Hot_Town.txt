Down in this hot town  
At some old cafe tonight  
You hear the dogs bay  
At the green neon light  
It's one hundred degrees  
But the heat is free  
In this hot town  
This hot town tonight  
And that there candle  
Only adds to the heat  
As you sit in your t-shirt  
Trying to eat  
You watch the waitress, you watch the clock on the wall  
And the flies in the window climb up just to fall  
In this hot town (hot town, hot town)  
This hot town tonight (hot town, hot, hot)  
Down in this hot town  
Don't know no person to call  
And this here cafe  
Don't serve no beer at all  
Out on the sidewalk  
It's cooling down for your feet (cooling down, cooling down for your feet)  
But the women are still sweaty and sweet (still sweaty, sweaty and sweet)  
So you watch the waitress, you watch the clock on the wall  
And the flies in the window climb up just to fall  
In this hot town (hot town, hot town)  
This hot town tonight (hot town, hot, hot)  
It's one hundred degrees  
But the heat is free  
In this hot town (hot town, hot town)  
This hot town tonight (hot town, hot, hot)  
It's one hundred degrees (oh yeah)  
In this hot town (hot town, hot town)  
This hot town tonight (hot town, hot, hot)  
(Hot town, hot town)  
(Hot town, hot, hot)... (fade)
