Waking in the dead of night  
Hold onto this life  
Running to what's wrong or right  
Seems to be a thin line  
Fighting for a wasted love  
Fighting to survive  
Oh won't you please forget  
Won't you please forget  
  
These are the dog days  
These are the dog days  
They'll never go away  
These are the dog days  
These are the dog days  
They'll never go away  
  
1, 2, 3, 4  
What are you waiting for?  
1, 2, 3, 4  
What are you waiting for?  
These are the dog days  
These are the dog days  
  
Waking in the dead of night  
Hold onto this life  
Running to what's wrong or right  
Seems to be a thin line  
Fighting for a wasted love  
Fighting to survive  
Oh won't you please forget  
Won't you please forget  
  
These are the dog days  
These are the dog days  
They'll never go away  
These are the dog days  
These are the dog days  
They'll never go away  
  
1, 2, 3, 4  
What are you waiting for?  
1, 2, 3, 4  
What are you waiting for?  
These are the dog days  
These are the dog days  
  
Embracing the heart  
To find the loss  
Running down a path that  
I think i need to know  
When you've think you've won  
You're still losing after all  
These are the dog days  
These are the dog days  
  
These are the dog days  
These are the dog days  
They'll never go away  
These are the dog days  
These are the dog days  
They'll never go away  
  
1, 2, 3, 4  
What are you waiting for?  
1, 2, 3, 4  
What are you waiting for?  
These are the dog days  
These are the dog days
