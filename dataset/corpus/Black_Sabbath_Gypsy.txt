Watching the universe at the end of another day  
Fatalistic ships froma distant shore  
In the back of my mind I could see she was standing there  
Like the feeling you have  
When you've been there before  
  
She was a gypsy woman  
She was as cold as the day, yeah  
She said I'd got it coming  
And then she took me away, yeah  
  
She took me through the shadows of her sunken dream  
I thought it's over me, she wasn't all she seemed  
  
She took my hand and then she started to speak  
She told me she'd had the call  
With eyes of fire that were burning my soul  
She looked into her crystal ball  
She read my fortune then she read my mind  
She didn't like my thoughts at all  
  
She showed me shadows, a spectre of life  
My soul just wanted to scream  
She stared so deeply into my eyes  
That's when I fell into a dream  
When I awoke in bed she lay beside me  
And she read me with her eyes, she said  
  
So you want to be a gypsy, come on now  
So you want to be a gypsy, come on now, now, now  
  
Gypsy woman you're the devil in drag  
You are the queen of all hell  
You took my body,now you're wasting my soul  
You've got me under your spell  
And as the sun shines on another day  
You're gonna take my mind as well,it's over  
  
So you want to be a gypsy, come on now  
So you want to be a gypsy, come on now  
So you want to be a gypsy, come on now  
So you want to be a gypsy
