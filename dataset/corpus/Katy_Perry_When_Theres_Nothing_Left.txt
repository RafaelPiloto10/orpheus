When there's nothing  
Left to give  
I will give you more  
Than I ever gave before  
When there's nothing  
Left left to say  
I'll say it all again,  
But until then...  
  
And I'll give you my heart,  
Say I love you  
Say I love you  
And I'll give you my heart,  
Say I love you  
Oh, cause I do, Jesus  
  
No music to play  
So I sing you my own song  
Come on and sing along  
When there's nothing that remains  
You still stay the same  
You're looking so strong  
  
CHORUS  
  
When there's nothing left to give  
I will give you more  
Than I ever gave before
