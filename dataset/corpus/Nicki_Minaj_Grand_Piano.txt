[Verse 1]  
Am I just a fool?  
Blind and stupid for loving you  
Am I just a silly girl?  
So young and naive to think you were the one who came to take claim of this
heart  
Cold-hearted, shame you'll remain just afraid in the dark  
  
[Chorus]  
And now the people are talking, the people are saying that you have been
playing my heart like a grand piano  
The people are talking, the people are saying that you have been playing my
heart like a grand piano  
So play on, play on, play on  
Play on, play on, play on  
Play on, play on, play on  
Play on, play on  
  
[Verse 2]  
Am I being a fool?  
Wrapped up in lies and foolish truths  
What do I see in you?  
Maybe I'm addicted to all the things you do  
Cause I keep thinking you were the one who came to take claim of this heart  
Cold-hearted, shame you'll remain just afraid in the dark  
  
[Chorus]
