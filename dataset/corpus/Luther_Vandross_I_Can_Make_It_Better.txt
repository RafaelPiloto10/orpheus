Well, once again my love  
It's time for you to go  
No need to explain anything  
I know, I know, I know  
  
This is the end of the road  
It's the parting of the ways  
And there's not much left for us to say  
  
You keep telling me he's no good for you  
You said you were gonna change your lock  
You told me if he bothers you again, baby  
He'll be dancing to the Jailhouse Rock  
Put him away, baby  
Make him understand  
Tell him his game is over  
And then when you cry, I'll be your shoulder  
  
Whatever you're going through  
I can make it better  
No one should be making you feel like you do  
I can make it better  
Oh baby, baby  
Don't be a link in his chain  
Tell him you want to be free, you want to love me  
Don't let him get in the way  
  
For every one time that he gives you pleasure  
Ten times he makes you wanna cry  
You spend every night with the toss and the turn, baby  
And wonder why in the world, oh why  
How in the world can you get any sleep  
Every one knows the way that he creeps  
It's time for the question baby  
What has he done for you lately, no  
  
Whenever you want me to  
I can make it better  
I just need this one chance to prove it to you  
I can make it better  
Ooo baby, baby  
Don't be a pawn in his game  
Go 'head and tell him it's over, tell him to go  
Or darling, it's just a shame  
  
Better for you is better for me  
Let's fall in love, I'll make you see  
Better for you is better for me, baby  
Let's fall in love, I'll make you, I'll make you see  
  
Never again will you hear a lie  
Never again will you wanna cry  
never, oh no, will there be a tear drop in your eye  
Stop all this madness in the name of love  
Tell him to leave ?cuz enough is enough  
Let him go baby, save your love for me  
Tell him you've found somebody  
Who'll give you the love that you just won't believe
