She  
She screams in silence.  
A sulley roit penetrating through her mind.  
Waiting for a sign to smash the silence with the brick of self control.  
  
Are you locked up in a world that's been planned out for you?  
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use?  
Scream at me until my ears bleed.  
I'm taking heed in just for you.  
  
She  
She's figured out all her doubts were someone else's point of view.  
Waking up this time to smash the silence with the brick of self control.  
  
Are you locked up in a world that's been planned out for you?  
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use?  
Scream at me until my ears bleed.  
I'm taking heed in just for you.
