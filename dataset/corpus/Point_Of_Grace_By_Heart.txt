Oh, I know that You'll be watching over me  
Your shining light has changed my life  
It's like I've found my way home  
I know You're near, hear You loud and clear  
I could live on this feeling alone  
Everywhere I go You are right there beside me  
Anytime of night or day  
Your name is on my lips, Your love I can't resist  
Got to be with You wherever You are  
I want You memorized so when I close my eyes  
All I have to do is keep loving You by heart  
I don't have to see, see You to believe  
That Your not going away  
I know You'll be watching over me  
You're the shelter that's keeping me safe  
I know Your arms they can reach out to hold me  
Even when I'm feeling alone  
Your name is on my lips, Your love I can't resist  
Got to be with You wherever You are  
I want You memorized so when I close my eyes  
All I have to do is keep loving You by heart  
Comes naturally like every breath I breathe  
Don't have to think it's second nature to me  
I close my eyes and You are there with me  
You know me, You see me, You hear me, You heal me  
Your name is on my lips, Your love I can't resist  
Got to be with You wherever You are  
I want You memorized so when I close my eyes  
All I have to do is keep loving You  
Your name is on my lips, Your love I can't resist  
Got to be with You wherever You are  
I want You memorized so when I close my eyes  
All I have to do is keep loving You by heart  
I'm gonna be wherever You are  
I love You with my heart and soul  
I close my eyes, all I have to do  
Is keep on loving you by heart  
I'm gonna be wherever You are  
I love You with my heart and soul  
I close my eyes, all I have to do  
Is keep on loving you by heart
