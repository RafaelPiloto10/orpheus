Tread careful  
Because you're treading on my dreams.  
Tread careful  
Because I've just one heart  
Tread careful  
Let me down slowly  
Or I'll forget how to dream.  
Chorus:  
I won't forget anything  
(I love you)  
I won't forgive anyone  
(Do you love me?)  
Tread careful  
You hear the sound of my breathing  
Tread careful  
Because I feel this sound  
Tread careful  
I'm falling in a glasshouse  
I'm trying hard to begin  
Because I want it to get harder  
Tread careful  
Before I change my mind  
Tread careful  
I could surprise you  
I know something you want to do.  
(repeat chorus)  
Tread careful  
I'm sure you don't care but  
Tread careful  
I could change your mind  
Tread careful  
I've been waiting for you  
There is no comfort in here.  
(repeat chorus)
