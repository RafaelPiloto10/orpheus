Will you pass me down the wine  
It's getting near that time  
What you got tomorrow?  
Only pain and sorrow  
  
Will you dance for me tonight  
I promise I won't bite  
Let's go see the sun burst  
Wait til I go numb first  
  
And in the morning come to us  
And if the evening showers us  
Sing to us  
  
Will you break it down for me  
'cause what will be will be  
I can hear the thunder  
Gonna stop the hunger  
  
And in the morning come to us  
And if the evening showers us  
Sing to us  
  
To all my sisters yeah you're looking pretty fine  
And to all my brothers I bet you're feeling kinda high  
And to all the mothers well come on now, don't be shy  
And to all the fathers who are sick and fucking tired
