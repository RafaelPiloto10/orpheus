Before I had a baby  
I didn't care anyway  
I thought about the back door  
I didn't know what to say, yeah, yeah  
But once I got a baby  
I, I tried every way  
She didn't want to do it  
But she did anyway, yeah, yeah  
But baby please don't refuse  
You know you got nothin' to lose  
(You got nothin' to lose)  
You got, got nothin' to lose (well nothin')  
You got, got nothin' to lose (yeah baby)  
You got, got nothin' to lose (wohoo)  
You got, got nothin' to lose (you g-g-g-g-got nothin')  
You got, got nothin' to lose (well come on mama)  
You got, got nothin' to lose (yeah shake your huh)  
You got, got  
You got, you got, you got nothin' to lose  
So now I've got a baby  
And we've tried every way  
You know she wants to do it  
And she does anyway  
But baby please don't refuse  
You know you got nothin' to lose
