Baby I just want you to understand  
Just exactly how you make me feel  
  
Oooh yeah  
  
I wanna feel you next to me  
  
Ooooh... Time after time, when I'm feelin low  
Somethin inside of me let's me know it's alright  
Loves on my side  
When the world... Seems a lonely place  
I've got a dream that won't leave a trace of the blues  
I just think of you baby I know  
  
I've got a real thing here by my side  
Someone who needs me holding me tight  
And these special feelings won't ever fade  
Cause I knew from the start you put a move on my heart  
  
Baby our loves like a melody playing for us  
In the sweetest key you could find the music of life  
And when we touch there's the warmest glow  
Heat in the passion that heaven knows it's a dream  
Just for you, you and me... And baby I know  
  
I've got a real thing the love of my life  
Someone who needs me and he feels me with pride  
Baby now, now and forever, we'll never part  
Cause you're the world to me you put a move on my heart  
  
I got a real love yes I do, and you're someone baby  
You're someone baby, someone that needs true love  
And these, these special feelings, time can embrace  
Baby, believe me this ain't a dream and suger  
I knew, I knew from the start, you put a move on me  
Oooh you got through to my heart
