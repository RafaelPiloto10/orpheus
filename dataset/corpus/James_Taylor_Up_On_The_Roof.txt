When this old world starts a getting me down  
And people are just too much for me to face  
I'll climb way up to the top of the stairs  
And all my cares just drift right into space  
On the roof, it's peaceful as can be  
And there the world below don't bother me, no, no  
So when I come home feeling tired and beat  
I'll go up where the air is fresh and sweet  
I'll get far away from the hustling crowd  
And all that rat-race noise down in the street  
On the roof, that's the only place I know  
Look at the city, baby  
Where you just have to wish to make it so  
Let's go up on the roof  
And at night the stars they put on a show for free  
And, darling, you can share it all with me  
That's what I said, keep on telling you  
That right smack dab in the middle of town  
I found a paradise that's trouble proof  
And if this old world starts a getting you down  
There's room enough for two, up on the roof  
Up on the roof, up on a roof  
Everything is alright, everything is alright  
Come on  
Drop what you're doin' tonight and  
Climb up the stairs and see with me, babe  
We got the stars above and the city lights below  
Up on the roof, now
