Oh Mama I'm in fear for my life  
From the long arm of the law  
Lawman has put an end to my running  
And I'm so far from my home  
Oh mama I can hear you a crying  
You're so scared and all alone  
Hangman is coming down from the gallows  
And I don't have very long  
  
(YEAH!)  
The jig is up the news is out  
They've finally found me  
The renegade who had it made  
Retrieved for a bounty  
Never more to go astray  
This will be the end today of the wanted man  
  
Whoa mama I've been years on the lam  
And had a high price on my head  
Lawman said get him dead or alive  
Now it's for sure he'll see me dead  
  
Dear mama I can hear you a crying  
You're so scared and all alone  
Hangman is coming down from the gallows  
And I don't have very long  
  
The jig is up the news is out  
They've finally found me  
The renegade who had it made  
Retrieved for a bounty  
Never more to go astray  
The judge will have revenge today  
On the wanted man
