It lay buried here. It lay deep inside me.  
It's so deep I don't think that I can speak about it.  
It could take me all of my life,  
But it would only take a moment to  
  
Tell you what I'm feeling,  
But I don't know if I'm ready yet.  
You come walking into this room  
Like you're walking into my arms.  
What would I do without you?  
  
Take away the love and the anger,  
And a little piece of hope holding us together.  
Looking for a moment that'll never happen,  
Living in the gap between past and future.  
Take away the stone and the timber,  
And a little piece of rope won't hold it together.  
  
If you can't tell your sister,  
If you can't tell a priest,  
'Cause it's so deep you don't think that you can speak about it  
To anyone,  
Can you tell it to your heart?  
Can you find it in your heart  
  
To let go of these feelings  
Like a bell to a Southerly wind?  
We could be like two strings beating,  
Speaking in sympathy...  
What would we do without you?  
Two strings speak in sympathy.  
  
Take away the love and the anger,  
And a little piece of hope holding us together.  
Looking for a moment that'll never happen,  
Living in the gap between past and future.  
Take away the stone and the timber,  
And a little piece of rope won't hold it together.  
  
We're building a house of the future together.  
(What would we do without you?)  
  
Well, if it's so deep you don't think that you can speak about it,  
Just remember to reach out and touch the past and the future.  
Well, if it's so deep you don't think you can speak about it,  
Don't ever think that you can't change the past and the future.  
You might not, not think so now,  
But just you wait and see--someone will come to help you.
