Now I been gone, for sometime baby  
But I been thinkin' of you, the whole time through  
The thought of your love got me excited  
And now that all the waitin' is done  
It's time to have some fun my baby  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby I love you so  
I wanna love you head to toe  
I can't wait, no I can't wait no longer  
Come on baby, let's do this  
You were my lover and my friend  
I wanna love you 'til the end  
To the very end, girl  
I can't wait, no I can't wait no longer  
So come on baby, let's do this, yeah  
  
Now you know I'm - I'm not complicated  
I only need you my sweet baby and your love to drive me crazy  
Now that I'm back you better get ready  
'Cause I saved it all for you  
I'm gonna love you through and through my baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I waited so long to get to this  
Come on baby, let's do this, yeah  
  
Ha, ha wait a minute Mr. Vandross  
You say you been gone so long you need a dose  
But, oh no that coming and going, it's got to go  
Check my flow  
  
You say you want this,  
Well baby this you besta know  
Spinderella ain't ain't new to this  
I need my man to be true tho this,  
  
So work it out, lace this if you can  
And stay around - you the man  
And I need you to be down  
  
[Chorus]
