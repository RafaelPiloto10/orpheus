That's my cigar  
You'll steal another  
Hey bumma's we got work to do  
Since when did you become me mada  
Ahh stop your ballin  
Hey who asked you?  
  
Try bottle alley or the harbor  
Try central park its garenteed  
Try any banker, bum or barba  
They almost all knows howda read  
  
I smell money  
You smell foul  
Met this girl last night  
Hey move you elbow  
Pass the towel  
For a buck I might  
  
Chorus:  
And its a fine life carrying the banner through it all  
A mighty fine life carrying the banner tough and tall  
Every morning we goes where we wishes  
Wes as free as finshes  
Sure beets washin dishes  
What a fine life carrying the banner through it all  
  
Its takes a smile as sweet as butta  
The kind the ladies can't resist  
It takes an orphane with a studda  
Who aint afraid to use his fist  
  
Summa stinks and winters wating  
Welcome to new york  
Boy aint nature fasinating  
When yous gotta walk  
  
Chorus  
  
Aint it a fine life carrying th banner through it all!
