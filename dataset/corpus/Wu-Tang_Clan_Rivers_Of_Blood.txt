The Chinese have a saying: "Dangerous men will meet in our streets."  
And so it was. We were raised between the clans,  
And that meant pressure on me to make more weapons.  
And as word of the gold shipment spread,  
Strangers suddenly appeared in jungle village  
  
Ay yo, ay yo, Machete still stainless  
The archbishop run from the Knox  
A Chris biscuit plus play the heart, wrists glisten  
Goon captain, catch me in Africa black down with 4 5 Somalians  
Black Tims, rubber suit Wonder Woman, bangers a blue coupe  
I'm usually upon the roof countin' mad loot  
Root beer reefer, teeth frame, doin' my 1, 2  
Smokin' with a plain Jane trooper  
Excellent with rifles, out in Japan  
In a flight goons switchblade poke out the night boots ?  
Thrusted on a bullet train with chains on, gettin' my train on  
Thunder money, make bread, brainstorm  
All this is made for the Forbes list  
Broads get pissed, say "Yo he fucked me out his drawers he dissed me"  
All this is calculated, the Batman with a black hand  
Mafia money, killas who rock tans(?)  
  
Bone crushing, smooth kicks, blades choppin', move ? bricks  
Masters of the weaponry, sells to both cliques  
Blacksmith, with the iron fist  
  
Bone crushing, smooth kicks, blades choppin', move ? bricks  
Masters of the weaponry, sells to both cliques

Rigamortus, I watch the body rot to the bone structure  
Scrape out your brain, watch your eyeballs rupture  
Black magic, leave your fuckin' skull in a soup pot  
Makaveli, Vamoose like 2pac  
Suicidal tendencies, down to white Hennessy  
Look in the book, I'm the definition of menace b  
Chokin' niggas out for no reason, it's duck season  
I'm cold as ice, 6 degrees below freezing  
Stay dipped, rock a striped shirt like Freddy Kreuger  
You'se a baby piranha surrounded by barracudas  
Seven thirty, I'm more like 6 o' clock  
Straight up and down beatin' up niggas till there's blood in they socks  
Ox em, duff em', stuff 'em in black bags  
Without gettin' no blood on my fresh rags  
Ruthless, heart of a stone, grown with no emotions  
I piss out brewhas, poisonous potion  
  
Bone crushing, smooth kicks, blades choppin', move ? bricks  
Masters of the weaponry, sells to both cliques  
Blacksmith, with the iron fist  
  
Yeah, it's the three deadly venoms with weapons in the denims  
Shit that'll shake windows and break lay tenants  
Left field, aim crooked and straight blaze in em  
Have you niggas with straight-legs with a fake leg in em  
Wolf in sheep's clothing, eyes scoping a tender lamb  
Spin you bitches like a ballroom dinner dance  
G-Mode dress code got suspender clamps  
Russian roulette, money bet, go and spend your chance  
You little fleas get killa bees and army ants  
EMS cut up your jeans like zombie pants  
Hollow chrome to your collarbone  
Ping against your dome piece and sound like the first key on a xylophone  
Grown men discussing death and the malice tone  
See how quick the smiley faces turn solid stone  
Ghostface, Rae and G be the wildest known  
We straight street, we keep seats in the palace throne  
  
Bone crushing, smooth kicks, blades choppin', move ? bricks  
Masters of the weaponry, sells to both cliques  
Blacksmith, with the iron fist
