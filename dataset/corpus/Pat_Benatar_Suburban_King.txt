The alarm clock rings but you don't move  
But the wife gets up and puts on her uniform  
You hear her in the bathroom  
Cause she's got that nagging cough  
You put your head under the pillow  
To forget you've been laid off  
Suburban King  
Suburban King  
You had it printed on your van  
Cause it had a pretty ring  
Suburban King  
  
The union man said you'd be recalled  
But the company up and moved to Taiwan  
You counted on the pension plan  
But you were out of luck  
The union says you only qualify  
For twenty-five bucks  
  
Suburban King  
Suburban King  
You had it printed on your van  
Cause it had a pretty ring  
Suburban King  
Suburban King  
  
Your American dream didn't mean a thing  
Suburban King
