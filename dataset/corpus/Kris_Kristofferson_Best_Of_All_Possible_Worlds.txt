I was runnin' through the summer rain, try'n' to catch that evenin' train  
And kill the old familiar pain weavin' through my tangled brain  
When I tipped my bottle back and smacked into a cop I didn't see  
That police man said, "Mister Cool, if you ain't drunk, then you're a  
fool."  
I said, "If that's against the law, then tell me why I never saw  
A man locked in that jail of yours who wasn't neither black or poor as  
me?"  
Well, that was when someone turned out the lights  
And I wound up in jail to spend the night  
And dream of all the wine and lonely girls  
In this best of all possible worlds.  
Well, I woke up next mornin' feelin' like my head was gone  
And like my thick old tongue was lickin' something sick and wrong  
And I told that man I'd sell my soul for something wet and cold as that  
old cell.  
That kindly jailer grinned at me, all eaten up with sympathy  
Then poured himself another beer and came and whispered in my ear,  
"If booze was just a dime a bottle boy, you couldn't even buy the smell"  
I said, "I knew there was something I liked about this town."  
But it takes more than that to bring me down, down, down.  
'Cause there's still a lot of wine and lonely girls  
In this best of all possible worlds  
Well, they finally came and told me they was a gonna set me free  
And I'd be leavin' town if I knew what was good for me  
I said, "It's nice to learn that ev'rybody's so concerned about my  
health."  
(They were obsessed with it)  
I said, "I won't be leavin' no more quicker than I can  
'Cause I've enjoyed about as much of this as I can stand  
And I don't need this town of yours more than I never needed nothin'  
else."  
'Cause there's still a lot of drinks that I ain't drunk  
And lots of pretty thoughts that I ain't thunk  
And lord there's still so many lonely girls  
In this best of all possible worlds.
