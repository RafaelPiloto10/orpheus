Yesterday, I was alone and blue  
My heart was heavy and then came you  
Oh, I can see! That you were meant for me  
Now, I have found you, I'll never let you go  
You know that I love you, I need you  
You know that I'm caring, sharing everything I've got  
Don't you know that I want you? I need you too  
I will be happy with you for the rest of my life  
Many lovers they come and go  
But your sweet loving lingers on and on  
Oh, I can feel! That this time it's for real  
So, hold me closer and never let me go  
You know that I love you, I need you  
You know that I'm caring, sharing everything I've got  
Don't you know that I want you? I need you too  
I will be happy with you for the rest of my life  
I will be happy with you for the rest of my life  
Well your sweet love is all I need  
Without you I just can't go on  
You know that I love you, I need you too  
You know that I'm caring, sharing everything I've got  
Don't you know that I want you? I need you too  
I will be happy with you for the rest of my life  
I'll be happy with you for the rest of my life  
I will be happy with you for the rest of my life
