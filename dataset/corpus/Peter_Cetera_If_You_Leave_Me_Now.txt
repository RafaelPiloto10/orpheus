(Don't go, please don't go)  
If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, no, baby please don't go  
And if you leave me now, you'll take away the very heart of me  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, no, baby please don't go  
A love like ours is love that's hard to find  
How could we let it slip away?  
  
We've come to far to leave it all behind  
How could we end it all this way?  
When tomorrow comes and we'll both regret things we said today
