You say you wanna see the city lights  
'Cause they shine so bright  
And they are calling you  
Before you go  
I need to know I won't stand in your way  
But I want you to stay  
  
I remember those summer nights  
When I held you tight  
And it felt so rite  
I thought what we had would never end  
And now your leavin  
  
Chorus:  
Baby, think it over, think it over  
Before you walk away  
Baby think it over, think it over  
Before you turn the page  
I want you to stay  
  
You say you're going to be star  
But to me you are  
And I never would ask you to change  
I really want you to chase your dreams  
But the pain in me is just so hard on me  
  
I remember those summer nights  
When I held you tight  
And it felt so right  
I thought what we had would never end  
And now your leavin  
  
chorus  
  
Stay 'till the morning comes  
I hope a change of mind  
One last chance for you to see  
But you leave me behind  
  
I remember those summer nights  
When I held you tight  
And it felt so right  
I thought what we had would never end  
And now you're leavin  
  
chorus 2x
