You're always saying that there's something wrong.  
I'm starting to believe it's you're playing along.  
Death came around, forced to hear it's song  
And know tomorrow can't be depended on  
  
Seen the home inside your head.  
Unlocked doors and unmade beds  
  
Open sores unattended  
Let me say just once that  
  
I have faced it, a life wasted.  
I'm never going back again.  
I escaped it,a life wasted.  
I'm never going back again.  
Having tasted, a life wasted.  
I'm never going back again.  
  
The world awaits just up the stairs  
Leave the pain for someone else  
Nothing back there for you to find  
Or was it you you left behind  
  
You're always saying you're too weak to be Strong.  
You're harder on yourself than just about Anyone  
  
Why swim the channel just to get this far?  
Halfway there, why would you turn around?  
  
Darkness comes in waves...tell me,  
Why invite it to stay?  
  
You're one with negativity  
Yes, comfort is an energy  
But why let the sad song play?  
  
I have faced it, a life wasted  
I'm never going back again  
  
Oh I escaped it, a life wasted  
I'm never going back again  
  
Having tasted, a life wasted  
I'm never going back again  
  
Oh I erased it, a life wasted  
I'm never going back again
