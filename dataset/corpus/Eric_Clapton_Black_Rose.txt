The dogs are howling at the midnight moon.  
I'm on my way to where the black rose blooms.  
The mountain's high, the night is cold.  
I feel the sunshine a black rose grows.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Together again, we're as common as sin, they say,  
We just walk around the stones they throw.  
Night after night, we steal away to where  
Love don't see no colors in the shadows,  
Love don't see no colors in the shadows.  
  
Wind in the willows, wild and warm,  
Just like the woman lying here in my arms.  
The water's deep, cold and still.  
I love the feeling that black rose gives.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Love don't see no colors in the shadows.
