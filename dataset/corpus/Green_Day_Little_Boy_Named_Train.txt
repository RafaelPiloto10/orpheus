Where did you come from?  
Where have you been?  
Looks like you fell into the trash bin  
I'm catching train, I'm crashing a car  
Back in for daylight shooting for the stars  
  
Like a lifelong daisy chain  
Of my imagination  
A rat inside a maze  
I got no destination  
  
'Cause I'm a little boy named Train  
Ask me again, I'll tell you the same  
Little boy named Train  
Don't know where I come from  
But I know where I have been  
  
Serious people are funny to me  
Funny people seem so serious  
  
I'm always lost and nothing will change  
Give me directions and I'll get lost again  
  
Like a lifelong daisy chain  
Of my imagination  
A rat inside a maze  
I got no destination  
  
'Cause I'm a little boy named Train  
Ask me again, I'll tell you the same  
Little boy named Train  
  
Don't know where I come from  
But I know where I have been  
  
Like a lifelong daisy chain  
Of my imagination  
A rat inside a maze  
I got no destination  
  
'Cause I'm a little boy named Train  
Ask me again, I'll tell you the same  
Little boy named Train  
  
I don't know where I come from  
But I know where I have been  
I said I don't know where I come from  
But I know where I have been
