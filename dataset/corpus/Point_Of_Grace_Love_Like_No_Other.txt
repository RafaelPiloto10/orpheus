Who would've known  
This heart would stumble on someone  
As great as you  
Out of the blue  
  
Who would've guessed  
That I would fall so deep  
In a hope as true  
As the one I found in You  
  
Heaven's hands  
Lead me to faith's open door  
I'm surrounded by a grace  
This soul just can't ignore  
  
[Chorus]  
Lord, I'm Living in a love like not other  
Lost in mercy like I've never known  
Lord, I'm trusting in a love like no other  
To lead me on  
  
Who would've cared  
Enough to reach beyond my thin disguise  
To heal my life  
Who would've dared  
  
To wear the shame I carried deep inside  
To be my sacrifice  
Saving me  
From myself in the nick of time  
  
Forgiveness found  
It's way into this heart of mine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Unconditionally  
You embrace all that I am  
It's beyond all reason  
It's a love I'll never understand  
  
[Chorus]
