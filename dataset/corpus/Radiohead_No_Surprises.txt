A heart that's full up like a landfill  
A job that slowly kills you  
Bruises that won't heal  
You look so tired-unhappy  
Bring down the government  
They don't, they don't speak for us  
I'll take a quiet life  
A handshake of carbon monoxide  
  
With no alarms and no surprises  
No alarms and no surprises  
No alarms and no surprises  
Silent, silent  
  
This is my final fit  
My final bellyache  
  
With no alarms and no surprises  
No alarms and no surprises  
No alarms and no surprises please  
  
Such a pretty house  
And such a pretty garden  
  
No alarms and no surprises  
No alarms and no surprises  
No alarms and no surprises please
