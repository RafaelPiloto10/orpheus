I'm sentimental  
So I walk in the rain  
I've got some habits  
Even I can't explain  
Go to the corner  
I end up in Spain  
Why try to change me now  
  
I sit and daydream  
I've got daydreams galore  
Cigarette ashes  
There they go on the floor  
Go away weekends  
Leave my keys in the door  
Why try to change me now  
  
Why can't I be more conventional  
People talk  
People stare  
So I try  
But can't be  
'Cause I can't see  
My strange little world  
Just go passing me by  
  
So let people wonder  
Let 'em laugh  
Let 'em frown  
You know I'll love you  
Till the moon's upside down  
Don't you remember  
I was always your clown  
Why try to change me now  
  
Don't you remember  
I was always your clown  
Why try to change me  
Why try to change me now
