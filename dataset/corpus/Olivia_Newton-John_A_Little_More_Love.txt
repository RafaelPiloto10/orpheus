Night is draggin' her feet  
I wait alone in the heat  
I know know that you have your way  
'Til you have to go home.  
"No" 's a word I can't say.  
  
But it gets me nowhere to tell you "no"  
It gets me nowhere to make you go  
Will a little more love make you  
Star depending  
Will a little more love  
Bring a happy ending  
Will a little more love make it right  
Will a little more love make it right.  
  
Where did my innocence go  
How, how was a young girl to know  
I'm trapped, trapped in the spell of your eyes  
In the warmth of your arms  
In the web of your lies.  
  
But it gets me nowhere to tell you "no"
