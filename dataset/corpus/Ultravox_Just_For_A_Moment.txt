Talking in the window as the light fades  
I heard my voice break just for a moment  
Talking by the window as the light fades  
I felt the floor change into an ocean  
We'll never leave here, never  
Let's stay in here forever  
And when the streets are quiet  
We'll walk out in the silence  
  
Listening to the movement that the night makes  
I let the room fade just for a moment  
Sitting in the shadows that the leaves make  
I felt the floor change into an ocean  
We'll never leave here, never  
Let's stay in here forever  
And when the streets are quiet  
We'll walk out in the silence  
  
Listening to the music the machines make  
I let my heart break just for a moment  
Listening to the music the machines make  
I felt the floor change into an ocean  
We'll never leave here never  
Let's stay in here for ever  
And when the streets are quiet  
We'll walk out in the silence
