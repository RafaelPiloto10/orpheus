It's funny how things, they change, the clouds they part, rearrange for me  
Faces of strangers and I have no familiars to help me see  
Where is home?  
I want you to know  
  
That I wish you were here  
I wish you were here  
  
Sometimes I wonder if God hides out in cities to set us free  
Cuz yeah this room is crowded but I am so alone in it, help me please  
Where is home?  
I want you to know  
  
That I wish you were here  
I wish you were here  
I wish you were here  
  
And I will be strong  
I won't give in  
I won't deny you  
I know where we've been  
  
I am so much more  
Than all of my fears  
Than all of these tears  
My tears, yeah  
  
I wish you were here  
I wish you were here  
  
Where is home?  
I want you to know  
  
That I wish you were here  
I wish you were here
