They may say that we're the best thing that could be  
They say it to you and they say it to me  
But to each other they're insistin'  
Something must be missin'  
Things can't really be the way they seem to be  
  
They don't know love the way we do  
They've never loved someone like you  
  
Lady, lady, I never let them talk about you  
Lady, lady, 'cause you're mine  
Lady, lady, I jump up when they talk about you  
But so what I'm gonna be your guy  
  
You can never win  
Once that stuff begins  
'Cause when it starts, it just never ends  
People start rumors about you  
But I won't ever doubt you  
You're my best friend  
  
Let them be how they wanna be  
They can't stop you from loving me  
  
So you see, I don't care what they say,  
I don't care what they do  
I'm the one who loves you,  
I'm the one you need, I'm the one...  
  
A symphony plays when you are near  
And I love the music that I hear
