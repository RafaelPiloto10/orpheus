I've got the hair  
I've got the teeth  
I've got the eyes  
Well Peggy, take a look outside the window  
  
I've got the car  
I'm the lead singer  
I'm the man  
She, she come to me and set me free  
  
That makes me feel good  
She, she's New York grown I'm all alone  
She makes me feel good  
Never going down a suckerpath baby  
  
She, she makes me real and sex appeal  
That makes me feel good  
She, she fills my soul, it makes me whole  
That makes me feel good  
  
Never going down a suckerpath baby  
Now all day as you're calling me lazy  
Never going down the suckerpath baby  
Never go down never go down  
  
She treats me like a foolish child  
And laughing all the while  
Makes me want to be alive  
She sees me in a different light  
  
And knows I'll be alright  
Makes me want to be alive  
All the things I could have said  
Some days now I wish I'm dead  
  
A foolish child an awesome dream  
I think you know just what I mean  
Never going down a suckerpath baby  
Come on come on  
  
You don't want to ride me I don't even care  
You don't even move my style now  
I don't even care now
