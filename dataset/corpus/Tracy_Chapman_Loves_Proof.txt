I want you  
Try to forget her  
In your heart  
You know that she'll never  
Love you love you love you  
  
I want you  
Try to forget her  
She won't call  
Or write you a letter  
Of love love love's proof  
  
I want you  
Try to forget her  
Give her time  
And you'll wait forever  
For love love love's proof  
  
It's not in the stars  
It's all in the proof  
The chances the odds  
The one you love will love  
And fall for you  
And fall for you  
  
I want you  
Try to forget her  
You think she's good  
I'll be better  
And love you love you love you
