I'll keep my freedom  
I'll keep my guns  
Try to keep my money  
And my religion too  
Try to keep on workin'  
Try to keep on smilin'  
I will keep my Christian name  
And y'all can keep the change  
  
I'll keep my heroes  
Pictures on the wall  
I'll keep my family safe  
You bluff when I call  
I'm gonna keep my big V8  
Keep my friends the same  
Keep the government outta my business  
And y'all can keep the change  
  
This country's sure as hell been goin' down the drain  
We know what we need  
We know who to blame  
United Socialist States of America  
How do you like that name?  
I'll keep the USA and y'all can keep the change  
  
So FOX and friends  
Wanna put me down  
Ask for my opinion  
Then twist it all around  
Supposed to be talkin' about my father's new CD  
Well two can play that "Gotcha Game" just wait and see  
Don't tread on me  
  
This country's sure as hell been goin' down the drain  
We know what we need  
We know who to blame  
United Socialist States of America  
Don't ya just love that name?  
I'll keep the USA and y'all can keep the change  
  
I'll keep the USA and y'all can keep the change  
  
Yeah, you can keep FOX and friends and ESPN outta your homes too  
'Cause Bocephus and all his rowdy friends and his song is outta there!  
Yes sir!
