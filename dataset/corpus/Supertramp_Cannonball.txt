You're tellin' lies, so don't you criticize  
Yeah I got used, all messed up and abused  
You let me down, with all your runnin' round  
Still you pretend and try to call me friend  
  
Don't say a word, I know just what I heard  
Yeah you've been loose, you just got no excuse  
Just feel my rage, why can't you come of age?  
I felt it all, just like a cannonball  
  
Then you got mad, you said that I'm all bad  
So what's the use, you lied and that's the truth  
You took the key and drove right out on me  
I never knew put all my trust in you  
  
OK that's it, I'm leaving now, I quit  
I was unwise, so don't apologize  
I paid the price, for taking your advice  
I felt it all, just like a cannonball  
  
You can say what you want all day  
But I've never been so outraged  
I'm washing my hands of you  
How could you be so untrue  
You know I can't stand no more  
You know I can't stand no more
