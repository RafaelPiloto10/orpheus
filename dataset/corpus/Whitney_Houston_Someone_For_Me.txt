I'm here alone on a Friday night  
Waiting here beside the phone  
The TV, radio and me  
Really ain't been getting along  
  
I wish that I could fly away  
And party till the break of day  
And there I'd be sure to meet  
The guy that would be special to me  
  
Then mama comes and asks me  
Why am I dreaming sitting alone?  
Why not go out and have some fun  
It's the only way I'll ever find  
Someone for me  
While I am young and seventeen  
  
[Chorus]  
Someone for me  
Someone for me  
I've got to go find someone, someone  
Someone for me  
I've got to find someone, yeah!  
  
Now here's a party down at Angie's house  
With people packed against the wall  
I'm sitting in the corner here  
Trying to make some sense of it all  
  
And when I least expect it  
Meeting the guy I see in my dreams  
Here he is walking up to me and asking  
If I'd like to come and dance with him  
I think I've found someone for me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And so I'm finding out that dreams you believe in  
Can come to be  
And now I'm looking up to find the joy and happiness  
Can come to you and me  
At last I've found someone for me  
  
[Chorus]
