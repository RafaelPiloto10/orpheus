Don't care too much for  
Your backstabbin' and side steppin'  
You're all sweet talk, you're all lust  
You're the kind yeah, I don't trust  
I gotta get out, step aside  
Before you damage my pride  
Let me through don't spoil my view  
I gotta get away, away from you  
  
Oh no no never thought I'd feel so low  
You got me runnin', you got me runnin'  
But I ain't gonna hide  
And yesterday everything seemed okay  
Yeah you better run and hide away  
Oh you better hide  
  
You're out, out on the street  
But I'm back on my feet  
I might lose it, so get wise  
Stop your usin' and your lies  
Oh my friend don't stick around  
Your time is up, the chips are down  
Let me through don't spoil my view  
I gotta get away, away from you  
  
Oh no no never thought I'd feel so low  
You got me runnin', you got me runnin'  
But I ain't gonna hide  
And yesterday everything seemed okay  
Yeah you better run and hide away  
Oh you better hide  
  
You got me runnin', you got me runnin'  
You got me runnin', you got me runnin'  
You got me runnin', you got me runnin'  
You got me runnin', runnin', runnin'  
  
Runnin' away  
Watch me run  
Runnin', runnin', runnin'  
  
Oh no no never thought I'd feel so low  
You got me runnin', you got me runnin'  
But I ain't gonna hide  
And yesterday everything seemed okay  
Yeah you better run and hide away  
Oh you better hide  
  
You got me runnin', you got me runnin'  
You got me runnin', you got me runnin'  
You got me runnin', you got me runnin'  
You got me runnin', you got me runnin'  
I'm gettin' out, you got me runnin'  
You can't say no no more, you got me runnin'  
Get out the door, you got me runnin'  
You got me runnin'
