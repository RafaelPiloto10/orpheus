Don't want my mammy  
I don't need a friend  
My heart is broken  
It won't ever mend  
I ain't much carin'  
Just where I will end  
I must have that man  
  
I'm like an oven  
That's cryin' for heat  
He treats me awful  
Each time that we meet  
It's just unlawful  
How that boy can cheat  
But I must have that man  
  
He's hot as Hades  
A lady's not safe in his arms  
When she's kissed  
But I'm afraid that he's cooled off  
And maybe I'm ruled off his list  
I'll never be missed  
  
I need that person much worse'n just bad  
I'm falf alive and it's drivin' me mad  
He's only human if he's to be had  
I must have that man  
Don't want my mammy  
I don't need a friend  
My heart is broken  
It won't ever mend  
I ain't much carin'  
Just where I will end  
I must have that man  
  
I'm like an oven  
That's cryin' for heat  
He treats me awful  
Each time that we meet  
It's just unlawful  
How that boy can cheat  
But I must have that man  
  
He's hot as Hades  
A lady's not safe in his arms  
When she's kissed  
But I'm afraid that he's cooled off  
And maybe I'm ruled off his list  
I'll never be missed  
  
I need that person much worse'n just bad  
I'm half alive and it's drivin' me mad  
He's only human if he's to be had  
I must have that man
