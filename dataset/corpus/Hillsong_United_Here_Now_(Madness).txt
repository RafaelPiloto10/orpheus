Skies spin their dance within Your breath  
Time runs its race within Your hand  
And my mind runs wild to comprehend  
What no mind on earth could understand  
  
Your ways are higher  
Your thoughts are wilder  
Love came like madness  
Poured out in blood-washed romance  
It makes no sense but this is grace  
And I know You're with me in this place  
  
[Refrain]  
Here now  
All I know is I know that You are here now  
Still my heart  
Let Your voice be all I hear now  
Spirit breathe like the wind  
Come have Your way  
Cause I know You're in this place  
  
Faith makes a fool of what makes sense  
But grace found my heart when logic ends  
When justice called for all my debts  
The Friend of sinners came instead  
  
Your ways are higher  
Your thoughts are wilder  
Love came like madness  
Poured out in blood-washed romance  
It makes no sense but this is grace  
And I know You're with me in this place  
  
[Refrain 2]  
Here now  
All I know is I know that You are here now  
Still my heart  
Let Your voice be all I hear now  
Spirit breathe like the wind  
Come have Your way  
  
Cause I know that You are here now  
Heart and soul  
God I know that You are here now  
Fix my eyes on the things that I can't see now  
And all I see is the glory of Your name  
  
Cause I know that You are here now  
Still my heart  
Let Your voice be all I hear now  
Fix my eyes on the things that I can't see now  
Spirit breathe like the wind  
Come have Your way  
  
Cause I know that You are here now  
Still my heart  
Let Your voice be all I hear now  
Fix my eyes on the things that I can't see now  
Spirit breathe like the wind  
Come have Your way  
Cause I know that You are here now  
Still my heart  
Let Your voice be all I hear now  
Fix my eyes on the things that I can't see now  
Spirit breathe like the wind  
Come have Your way
