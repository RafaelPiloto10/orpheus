The hours grow shorter as the days go by  
You never get to stop and open your eyes  
One day you're waiting for the sky to fall  
The next you're dazzled by the beauty of it all  
When you're lovers in a dangerous time  
Lovers in a dangerous time  
These fragile bodies of touch and taste  
This vibrant skin, this hair like lace  
Spirits open to the thrust of grace  
Never a breath you can afford to waste  
When you're lovers in a dangerous time  
Lovers in a dangerous time  
Lovers in a dangerous time  
Lovers in a dangerous time  
When you're lovers in a dangerous time  
Sometimes you're made to feel as if your love's a crime  
But nothing worth having comes without some kind of fight  
You got to kick at the darkness 'til it bleeds daylight  
When you're lovers in a dangerous time  
Lovers in a dangerous time  
Lovers in a dangerous time  
Lovers in a dangerous time
