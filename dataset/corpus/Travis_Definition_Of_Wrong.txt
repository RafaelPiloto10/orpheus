Nothing's wrong, nothing's right  
There's no obvious solution to this plight  
Keep it locked, out of sight  
Even then it's just a matter of time, uh oh  
  
Nothing's right, nothing's reign  
I'm gonna get a tumor in the brain  
Now you're here, now you're gone  
  
Oh what's the definition of wrong  
Oh what's the definition of wrong  
What's the definition of wrong  
Hangin' out down the street  
  
Me and my homies and a couple of ho's we meet  
Acting shy, talking sweet  
Show me the money, honey  
Give it to me talk is cheap  
  
Shaken up, also ran  
You'd rather stick your head into the sand  
Now you're lame, too far gone  
Now what's the definition of wrong  
  
What's the definition of wrong  
What's the definition of wrong
