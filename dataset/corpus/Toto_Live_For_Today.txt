Baby, I'm a liar when I tell you that I just don't care  
Babe, I've got to have you but you're never ever, ever there  
Hey, the game is over, give it up right now  
You're teasin' me, baby, how do you expect me to be without you  
  
[Chorus]  
You let your hair down low  
You didn't want to know about lovin' me, babe  
Let's live for today, tomorrow may never come  
Let's live for today, tomorrow may never come  
But you just can't tell anymore  
  
Baby, you're a teaser but you just don't dare  
Baby, keep your secrets, this whole thing just ain't fair  
Tonight is almost over, tomorrow you'll be gone away  
So please baby, won't you stay  
  
[Chorus: x2]
