Deep down Louisiana close to New Orleans  
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens  
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood  
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode  
Who never ever learned to read or write so well  
But he could play the guitar just like a ringing a bell  
  
Go go  
Go Johnny go  
Go  
Go Johnny go  
Go  
Go Johnny go  
Go  
Go Johnny go  
Go  
Johnny B. Goode  
  
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack  
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track  
Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade  
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made  
People passing by they would stop and say  
Oh my that little country boy could play  
  
Go go  
Go Johnny go  
Go  
Go Johnny go  
Go  
Go Johnny go  
Go  
Go Johnny go  
Go  
Johnny B. Goode  
  
His mother told him "Someday you will be a man,  
And you will be the leader of a big old band.  
Many people coming from miles around  
To hear you play your music when the sun go down  
Maybe someday your name will be in lights  
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight."  
  
Go go  
Go Johnny go  
Go go go Johnny go  
Go go go Johnny go  
Go go go Johnny go  
Go  
Johnny B. Goode
