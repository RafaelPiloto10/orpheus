Somedays, we forget to look around us,  
Somedays, we can't see the joy that surrounds us,  
So caught up inside ourselves,  
We take when we should give,  
So for tonight we pray for,  
What we know can be,  
And on this day we hope for,  
What we still can't see,  
It's up to us, to be the change,  
And even though we all can still do more,  
There's so much to be thankful for,  
Look beyond ourselves,  
There's so much sorrow,  
It's way to late to say, I'll cry tomorrow  
Each of us must find our truth,  
It's so long overdue,  
So for tonight we pray for,  
  
What we know can be,  
And everyday, we hope for,  
What we still can't see,  
It's up to us, to be the change,  
And even though we all can still do more,  
There's so much to be thankful for,  
Even with our differences,  
There is a place we're all connected,  
Each of us can find each others light,  
So for tonight, we pray for  
What we know can be,  
And on this day, we hope for,  
What we still can't see,  
It's up to us, to be the change,  
And even though this world needs so much more  
There's so much to be thankful for.
