Smooth bore, scattergun, you are the only one  
To cover me when I sleep, cover me in my dreams  
Carry a smooth bore  
Scattergun, steal from me there'll be no time to run  
I got the bead on you, she fires true  
Take what you want and I'll do what I have to do  
Smooth bore, scattergun, scattergun, scattergun  
  
Triple-O bucks the only shot for me  
Cut any man right off at the knees  
Don't need to bother the police,  
I've got my Mossberg 590  
  
Smooth bore, scattergun, you are the only one  
To cover me when I sleep,  
Cover me in my dreams carry a smooth bore  
Scattergun, steal from me there'll be no time to run  
I got the bead on you, she fires true  
Take what you want and I'll do what I have to do  
Smooth bore, scattergun, scattergun, scattergun  
  
Smooth bore, scattergun, you are the only one  
To cover me when I sleep,  
Cover me in my dreams carry a smooth bore  
Scattergun, scattergun, scattergun
