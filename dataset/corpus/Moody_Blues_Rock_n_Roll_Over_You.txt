Like a rock I'm gonna roll over you.  
Like a rock I'm gonna roll over you.  
Not gonna lose my nerve,  
Not gonna fall apart,  
Not gonna turn the tide,  
Not gonna start from the top,  
Not gonna lose control,  
Not gonna turn around,  
Not gonna break my step,  
Not gonna till I take you to the top  
'cause there's something baby  
That I want you to know:  
What price love  
If there's nothing to show?  
  
Like a rock I'm gonna roll over you.  
Like a rock I'm gonna roll over you.  
  
No need to close the door,  
No need to lose your way,  
No need to stand alone.  
Just try to understand what I'm saying  
'cause I'm gonna hold on,  
Not gonna turn you loose,  
Not gonna bring you down,  
Not gonna let you go,  
I only want to take you to the top  
'cause, if I don't have you,  
Then I want you to know:  
What price love  
If we've nothing to show?  
  
Like a rock I'm gonna roll over you.  
Like a rock I'm gonna roll over you.
