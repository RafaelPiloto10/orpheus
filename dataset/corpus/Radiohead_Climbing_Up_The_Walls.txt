I am the key to the lock in your house  
That keeps your toys in the basement  
And if you get too far inside  
You'll only see my reflection  
  
It's always best when the light is off  
I am the pick in the ice  
Do not cry out or hit the alarm  
You know we're friends till we die  
  
And either way you turn  
I'll be there  
Open up your skull  
I'll be there  
Climbing up the walls  
  
It's always best when the light is off  
It's always better on the outside  
Fifteen blows to the back of your head  
Fifteen blows to your mind  
  
So lock the kids up safe tonight  
Shut the eyes in the cupboard  
I've got the smell of a local man  
Who's got the loneliest feeling  
  
That either way he turns  
I'll be there  
Open up your skull  
I'll be there  
  
Climbing up the walls  
Climbing up the walls  
Climbing up the walls
