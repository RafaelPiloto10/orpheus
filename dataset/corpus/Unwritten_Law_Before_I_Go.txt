Life hurts so bad  
Don't want you sad  
Just look back to  
Good times we had  
I'd give my soul for you I know  
Want to hold you before I go  
Before I go  
  
I need you to know  
I'm still alive in you  
It's my time to go  
Don't stay up late  
I'm not afraid  
  
And I don't want your heart to break  
I know I've seen what's been unseen  
Live fast, die young  
It's part of me  
(It's my time now)  
Before I go  
  
(It's my time now)  
My soul is on it's way  
(It's my time now)  
I need you to know  
Before I go
