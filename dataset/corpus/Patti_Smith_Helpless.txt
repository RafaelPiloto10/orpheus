[Originally by Neil Young]  
  
There is a town in north Ontario,  
With dream comfort memory to spare,  
And in my mind  
I still need a place to go,  
All my changes were there.  
  
Blue, blue windows behind the stars,  
Yellow moon on the rise,  
Big birds flying across the sky,  
Throwing shadows on our eyes.  
Leave us  
  
Helpless, helpless, helpless  
Baby can you hear me now?  
The chains are locked  
And tied across the door,  
Baby, sing with me somehow.  
  
Blue, blue windows behind the stars,  
Yellow moon on the rise,  
Big birds flying across the sky,  
Throwing shadows on our eyes.  
Leave us  
  
Helpless, helpless, helpless.
