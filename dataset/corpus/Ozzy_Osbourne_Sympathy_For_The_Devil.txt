Please allow me to introduce myself  
I'm a man of wealth and taste  
I've been around for a long, long time  
Stole many a man's soul and faith  
I was around when Jesus Christ  
Had his moment of doubt and pain  
Made damn sure that Pilate  
Washed his hands and sealed his fate  
Pleased to meet you  
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah  
But what's puzzling you  
Is the nature of my game  
I stuck around St. Petersburg  
When I saw it was a time for a change  
Killed the Czar and his ministers  
Anastasia screamed in vain  
I rode a tank  
Held a general's rank  
When the blitzkrieg raged  
And the bodies stank  
Oh, pleased to meet you  
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah  
But what's puzzling you  
Is the nature of my game  
I watched with glee while your kings and queens  
Fought for ten decades for the gods they made  
I shouted who killed the Kennedy?  
After all it was you and me  
Let me please introduce myself  
I'm a man of wealth and taste  
I laid traps for the troubadours  
Who get killed before they reached Bombay  
Pleased to meet you  
Hope you guessed my name  
But what's puzzling you  
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah  
Every cop is a criminal  
And all the sinners are saints  
Heads is tails just call me Lucifer  
I'm in need of some restraint  
So if you meet me have some courtesy  
Have some sympathy, and taste  
Use all your well-learned politesse  
Or I'll lay your soul to waste  
Pleased to meet you  
Hope you guessed my name  
But what's puzzling you  
Is the nature of my game  
What's my name?  
What's my name?  
What's my name?  
I am Lucifer  
Alright you motherfuckers  
What's my name?  
What's my name?  
Come on baby, come on baby, come on baby, come on baby  
Pleased to meet you  
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah  
But what's puzzling you  
Is the nature of my game
