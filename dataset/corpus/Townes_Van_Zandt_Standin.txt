I'm standin' with my bowed head down now  
That ain't right that ain't wrong  
It's just a feelin' but I can't shake it  
I keep on tryin but it's been so long  
  
If I hurt you I did not mean to  
I beg you pardon I did not want to  
When I leave you don't you think about me  
I won't be back babe I'll be long gone  
  
When the time comes and I'm not ready  
Seems it's over before I'm started  
The time comes and I don't feel it  
I don't know nothin' but my own  
  
Kingdoms into the sky go  
And the highway like a river does flow  
And my way sometimes it hurts so  
And your way just don't go home
