Bobby's driving through the city tonight  
Through the lights  
In a hot new rent-a-car.  
He joins the lovers in his heavy machine  
It's a scene down on Sunset Boulevard.  
  
[Chorus]  
Say goodbye to Hollywood  
Say goodbye my baby.  
Say goodbye to Hollywood,  
Say goodbye my baby.  
  
Johnny's taking care of things for a while  
And his style is so right for troubadours.  
They got him sitting with his back to the door  
Now he won't be my fast gun anymore.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Moving on is a chance that you take every time you try to stay together.  
Say a word out of line and you find that the friends you had are gone  
Forever, forever.  
So many faces in and out of my life,  
Some will last, some will just be now and then.  
Life is a series of hellos and goodbyes  
I'm afraid it's time for goodbye again.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Moving on is a chance that you take every time you try to stay together.  
Say a word out of line and you find that the friends you had are gone  
Forever, forever.  
So many faces in and out of my life,  
Some will last, some will just be now and then.  
Life is a series of hellos and goodbyes  
I'm afraid it's time for goodbye again.
