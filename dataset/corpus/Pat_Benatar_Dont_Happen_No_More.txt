Well there used to be a time when a man was a king  
To work for a man was a woman's only dream  
Everything he did was perfectly alright  
He didn't have to worry about fussin' and fightin'  
It don't happen no more  
That was a long time ago  
It's a pitiful shame  
How the world has changed  
  
There used to be a time when a woman couldn't smoke  
There used to be a time when a woman couldn't vote  
She used to stay at home while the man went out to play  
She was satisfied with life any old way  
  
It don't happen no more  
That was a long time ago  
It's a pitiful shame  
How the world has changed  
Well, well  
  
There used to be a time when a woman couldn't cook  
There used to be a time she didn't worry about her looks  
She used to sip on sassafrass, she didn't even drink  
She didn't try to tell her man how to think  
  
It don't happen no more  
That was a long time ago  
It's a pitiful shame  
How the world has changed  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
It don't happen no more  
That was a long time ago  
It's a pitiful shame  
How the world has changed  
  
It don't happen no more  
That was a long time ago  
It's a pitiful shame  
How the world has changed
