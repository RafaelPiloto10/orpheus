Being here together  
Is like dreaming wide awake  
Once you've found perfection  
You know it's no mistake  
Too many times  
I've tried too hard  
To make love become real  
You showed me how  
My life can change  
When love is meant to be  
  
It's undeniable  
Your love is undeniable  
It's undeniable  
True love is undeniable  
It's undeniable  
  
You can change direction  
You can change your mind  
Cold sky and close your eyes  
But the sun's still gonna shine  
'Cause when the magic comes your way  
And you say it isn't real  
Yeah!  
There's no use to try to lie  
About the way you make me feel  
  
It's undeniable  
Your love is undeniable  
It's undeniable  
True love is undeniable  
It's undeniable  
  
I can't turn it down  
(I can't turn it down)  
No one else can turn it around  
It's the truest thing I've ever found  
  
It's undeniable  
Your love is undeniable  
It's undeniable  
True love is undeniable  
It's undeniable
