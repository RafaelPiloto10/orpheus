(Riders On The Storm - Doors)  
  
Burgers on the grill  
Burgers on the grill  
I've really had my fill  
Of burgers on the grill  
When the relatives go home  
I'm stuck with chicken bones  
And burgers on the grill  
  
There's a steak tip on the coals  
It fell down through the holes  
And now it's caught on fire  
Smells like a funeral pyre  
I was tryin' to get it back  
But it's turnin' pretty black  
Steak tip on the coals  
  
Yeah!  
  
Wiener on the foil  
The skin begins to boil  
I dropped it in the soil  
I thought that it was spoiled  
So I washed it with a hose  
And fed it to Aunt Rose  
Wiener on the foil  
  
Burgers on the grill  
Burgers on the grill
