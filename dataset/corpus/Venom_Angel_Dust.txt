Living  
Running,  
Out on the streets at night,  
Searching,  
Hoping,  
For the right connection, coz',  
Need it, want it,  
You know I've got to have it,  
Takes me higher than anything I know.  
  
Angel dust,  
Need a shot to see me through the day,  
Angel dust,  
Want a lot I've got to get away.  
  
I live my life,  
Like there's no tomorrow,  
Take no chances  
I'm drowning all my sorrows coz' I,  
Need it, want it,  
You know I've got to have it,  
Takes me higher than anything I know.  
  
Laughing,  
Crying,  
Every night and day,  
I know,  
You know,  
That I'm a different man because I,  
Need it, want it,  
You know I've got to have it,  
Takes me higher than anything I know.
