This is not the first time you tried to get away,  
This is not a party where people know your name,  
This is not a classroom with teacher at the board,  
This is not a game show with prizes at the door.  
  
Go, don't you go,  
Won't you stay with me one more day?  
If we get through one more night,  
If we get through one more night,  
  
This is not a horse race where winners beat the time,  
This is not a funeral with mourners in a line,  
This is not a sitcom where everything's alright,  
This is not a prison with terror through the night.  
  
Go... don't you go,  
Won't you stay with me one more day?  
If we get through one more night,  
If we get through one more night,  
  
This is not the first time you tried to get away,  
This is not a party where people know your name,  
This is not a classroom with teacher at the board,  
This is not a game show with prizes at the door.  
  
Go... don't you go,  
Won't you stay with me one more day?  
If we get through one more night,  
If we get through one more night,  
  
[repeat chorus]  
  
This is not the first time you tried to get away,  
This is not a party where people know your name,  
  
Oh... where people know your name,
