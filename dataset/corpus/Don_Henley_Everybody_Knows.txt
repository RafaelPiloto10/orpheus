Everybody knows that the dice are loaded  
Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed  
Everybody knows the war is over  
Everybody knows the good guys lost  
Everybody knows the fight was fixed  
The poor stay poor, and the rich get rich  
That's how it goes  
And everybody knows  
  
Everybody knows the boat is leaking  
Everybody knows the captain lied  
Everybody got this broken feeling  
Like their father or their dog just died  
Everybody talkin' into their pockets  
Everybody wants a box of chocolates  
And a long stemmed rose  
Everybody knows  
  
Everybody knows  
Everybody knows  
That's how it goes  
Everybody knows  
  
Everybody knows that you love me baby  
Everybody knows that you really do  
Everybody knows that you've been faithful  
Give or take a night or two  
Everybody knows you've been discrete  
There were so many people you just had to meet  
Without your clothes  
But everybody knows  
  
Everybody knows that it's now or never  
Everybody knows that it's me or you  
Everybody knows that you live forever  
When you've done a line or two  
Everybody knows the deal is rotten  
Oh, by Joe still pickin' cotton  
For your ribbons and bows  
Everybody knows  
  
Everybody knows  
Everybody knows  
That's how it goes  
Everybody knows  
  
Everybody knows  
Everybody knows  
That's how it goes  
Everybody knows  
  
Everybody knows that the plague is coming  
Everybody knows it moving fast  
Everybody knows that's the naked man and woman  
Just a shining artifact of the past  
And everybody knows that the scene is dead  
But there's gonna be a meter on your bed  
That will disclose  
What everybody knows  
  
Everybody knows that you're in trouble  
Everybody knows what you've been through  
From the bloody cross on  
To the beach at Malibu  
Everybody knows it's coming apart  
Take one last look at this sacred heart  
Before it blows  
And everybody knows  
  
Everybody knows  
Everybody knows  
That's how it goes  
Everybody knows  
  
Everybody knows  
Everybody knows  
That's how it goes  
Everybody knows  
  
Everybody knows  
Everybody knows  
That's how it goes  
Everybody knows  
  
Everybody knows  
Everybody knows  
That's how it goes  
Everybody knows
