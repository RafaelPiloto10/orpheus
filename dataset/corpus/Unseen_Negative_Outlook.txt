I think so fucking hard my heads gonna explode.  
The hate replaces blood and its al that I know.  
Your words mean total nothing our existence is corruption  
That's how I see it why don't you give it a try.  
Sadness becomes anger and I don't know why.  
I've seen so much truth theirs no more tears to cry.  
It ran out years ago the wells gone dry  
I no longer care and now I realize I have a  
  
Negative outlook  
That's why I have a  
Negative outlook  
And it won't change  
  
Do I really care sometimes I wish I could  
Then I think what I despise and it feels really good.  
I won't worship false power as you destroy earth.  
I don't give a dam what you say its worth.  
What makes me feel this way. what have I become.  
The seasons still change but the damage is done.  
Its just another culture forced to die.  
No cares no conscience I'm desensitized with a  
  
Negative outlook  
That's why I have a  
Negative outlook  
And it won't change  
  
And that is how I realized I am negative
