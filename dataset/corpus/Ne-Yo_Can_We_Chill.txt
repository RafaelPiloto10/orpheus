Baby, don't you be so mean  
I try to keep my conversation clean  
But you the flyest thing I've seen, yeah  
Since I came up in here, you're a superstar, my dear  
I don't wanna waste your time  
With no corny player lines (corny player lines)  
But, girl, if you don't mind  
I would love to occupy the space right by your side  
  
[Chorus:]  
Girl, can we chill?  
Talk about leavin' together, sure, we will  
But, just for now, don't let my champagne spill on you  
As you make your move to the floor, floor, floor, floor  
Girl, can we chill?  
Talk about leavin' together, sure, we will (sure, we will)  
Later I'll do everything you want me to  
Makin' love to you  
Beg for more, more, more, more  
  
Shawty speakin' honestly (speakin' honestly)  
I can picture you and me (picture you and me)  
Bein' ever so discreet (ever so discreet)  
Disappearin' to the back of this club, imagine that, baby  
(Don't get mad at me  
No, baby girl, I was just playin')  
Hey, unless you really wanna go  
You're in control, just let me know  
But right now my song is playin'  
Let's take it to the floor  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge:]  
(Ooo, don't wanna rush  
Let's take it slow)  
Enjoy the night, babe  
Then you decide if you want to  
(Get to know me on a physical side)  
(Baby, tonight) Oh, baby, tonight  
(Let's get right) Let's get it right  
  
[Chorus]
