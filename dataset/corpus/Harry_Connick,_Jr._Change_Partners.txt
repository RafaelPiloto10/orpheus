Must you dance every dance  
With the same fortunate man  
You have danced with him since the music began  
Why don't you change partners and dance with me  
  
Must you stand quite so close  
With your lips touching his face  
Can't you see I'm longing to be in his place  
Why don't you change partners and dance with me  
  
Ask him to sit this one out  
And while you're alone  
I'll tell the waiter to tell him  
He's wanted on the telephone  
  
You've been locked in his arms  
Ever since heaven knows when  
Why don't you change partners and then  
You may never want to change partners again
