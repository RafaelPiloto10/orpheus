Turnaround, every now and then I get a  
Little bit lonely and you're never coming around  
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a  
Little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears  
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a  
Little bit nervous that the best of all the years have gone by  
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a  
Little bit terrified and then I see the look in your eyes  
Turnaround bright eyes, Every now and  
Then I fall apart  
Turnaround bright eyes, Every now and  
Then I fall apart  
  
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a  
Little bit restless and I dream of something wild  
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a  
Little bit helpless and I'm lying like a child in your arms  
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a  
Little bit angry and I know I've got to get out and cry  
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a  
Little bit terrified but then I see the look in your eyes  
Turnaround bright eyes, Every now and  
Then I fall apart  
Turnaround bright eyes, Every now and  
Then I fall apart  
  
And I need you now tonight  
And I need you more than ever  
And if you'll only hold me tight  
We'll be holding on forever  
And we'll only be making it right  
Cause we'll never be wrong together  
We can take it to the end of the line  
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time  
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark  
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks  
I really need you tonight  
Forever's gonna start tonight  
Forever's gonna start tonight  
  
Once upon a time I was falling in love  
But now I'm only falling apart  
There's nothing I can do  
A total eclipse of the heart  
Once upon a time there was light in my life  
But now there's only love in the dark  
Nothing I can say  
A total eclipse of the heart  
  
Turnaround bright eyes, Every now and
