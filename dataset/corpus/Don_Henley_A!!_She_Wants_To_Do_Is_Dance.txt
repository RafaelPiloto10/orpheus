They're picking up the prisoners  
And putting them in a pen  
And all she wants to do is dance, dance  
Rebels been rebels since I don't know when  
And all she wants to do is dance  
Molotov cocktail, the local drink  
And all she wants to do is dance, dance  
They mix them up right in the kitchen sink  
And all she wants to do is dance  
Crazy people walking around with blood in their eyes  
And all she wants to do is dance, dance  
Wild-eyed pistol wavers who ain't afraid to die  
And all she wants to do is  
All she wants to do is dance  
And make romance  
She can't feel the heat comming off the street  
She wants to party  
She wants to get down  
All she wants to do  
All she wants to is dance  
  
Well the goverment, bugged the men's room  
In the local disco lounge  
All she wants to do is dance, dance  
To keep the boys from selling  
All the weapons they can scrounge  
All she wants to do is dance  
But that don't keep the boys  
From making a buck or two  
And all she wants to do is dance, dance  
They still can sell the army  
All the drugs that they can do  
And all she wants to do is  
All she wants to do is dance  
And make romance  
  
Well, we barely made the airport  
For the last plane out  
As we taxied down the runway  
I could hear the people shout, they said:  
"Don't come back here, Yankee."  
But if I ever do, I'll bring more money  
Cause all she wants to do is dance  
And make romance  
  
Nevermind the heat  
Coming off the street  
She wants to party  
She wants to get down  
All she wants to do is  
All she wants to do is dance  
All she wants to do is dance  
And make romance  
Dance, Dance, Dance  
All she wants to do is dance
