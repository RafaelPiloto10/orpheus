Well I'm ready.  
As ready as anybody can be.  
Well I'm ready.  
As ready as anybody can be.  
Well I'm ready for you.  
I hope you're ready for me.  
  
I got an out of town pistol with the graveyard frame.  
It shoots tombstone bullets with a ball and chain.  
I'm drinkin' TNT and smokin' dynomite.  
I hope some schoolboy pick a fight.  
Cause I'm ready.  
As ready as anybody can be.  
Well, I'm ready for you.  
I hope you're ready for me.  
  
Now listen  
  
All you pretty little chicks with your curly hair,  
I know you feel like I ain't nowhere.  
But stop what you're doing honey, come over here.  
I'll prove it to you baby that I ain't no square.  
Cause I'm ready.  
As ready as anybody can be.  
Well, I'm ready for you.  
I hope you're ready for me.  
  
Well I'm drinkin' gin like never before.  
I'm feelin' so good honey that's for sure.  
One more drink honey I wish you would.  
It takes a whole lotta lovin' to make me feel good.  
Cause I'm ready.  
As ready as anybody can be.  
Well I'm ready for you.  
I hope you're ready for, a ready for, a ready for  
Well, I'm ready for  
Oh baby, you know I'm ready for you.
