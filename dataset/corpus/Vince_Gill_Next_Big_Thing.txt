Things have changed in the modern world  
It makes it kinda crazy for a boy and girl  
All a lot of noise on the radio  
It really don't rock  
It really don't roll  
  
Well, a kid come along make the young girls swoon  
They all put his picture in their pink bedrooms  
They all hail the brand new king  
Everybody's waiting for the next big thing  
  
[Chorus]  
Big cigars, diamond rings  
Ridin' all around in a limousine  
When you finally hit the top  
Man you know what that means  
Everybody's ready for the next big thing  
  
For a little while  
You can do no wrong  
Live it up son  
Cause it don't last long  
  
There's always somebody  
Waitin' in the wings  
Thinking they're going to be the next big thing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll get a cowboy hat  
Some real tight jeans  
Lose a little weight and  
Get a bellybutton ring  
  
You can stand back I'm a lean machine  
Maybe I'm gonna be the next big thing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everybody's ready for the next big thing
