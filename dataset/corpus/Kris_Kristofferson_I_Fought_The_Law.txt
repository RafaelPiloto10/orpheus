A breakin' rocks in the hot sun I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
I needed money cause I had none I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
I left my baby and I feel so bad I guess the race is run  
Cause he's the best man I ever had I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
[ guitar ]  
A robbin' people with a sixgun I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
I miss my baby and the good fun I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
I left my baby and I feel so bad...
