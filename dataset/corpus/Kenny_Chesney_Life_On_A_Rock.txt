Some say we're the land of misfit toys  
An insane mix of girls and boys  
Nothing really changes, like a stretch of sand time forgot  
  
That's just livin', that's just livin'  
That's just livin' life on a rock, yea  
  
Well you don't lose your lover, you just lose your turn  
Drivin' on the left side gotta be learned  
Happy hour's from 3 to 6 but it never really stops  
  
That's just livin', that's just livin'  
That's just livin' life on a rock, yea  
  
We got Rasta religions, and parrots and pigeons  
Mango and salt on a stick  
Life is a lime and from time to time  
I gotta go get my fix, yea  
  
We roll with the flow, friends come and go  
Usually by the edge of the dock  
  
That's just livin', that's just livin'  
That's just livin' life on a rock, yea  
Oh, I love livin', I love livin'  
I love livin' life on a rock, yea  
  
Life on a rock  
Yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah  
I love livin'  
Life on a rock
