Who wants to be right as rain  
It's better when something is wrong  
You get excitement in your bones  
And everything you do's a game  
When night comes and you're on your own  
You can say I chose to be alone  
Who wants to be right as rain  
It's harder when you're on top  
  
'Cause when hard work don't pay off  
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed  
As far as I'm concerned  
So wipe that dirty smile off  
We won't be making up  
I've cried my heart out  
And now I've had enough of love  
  
Who wants to be riding high  
When you'll just crumble back on down  
You give up everything you are  
And even then you don't get far  
They make believe that everything  
Is exactly what it seems  
But at least when you're at your worst  
You know how to feel things  
  
'Cause when hard work don't pay off  
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed  
As far as I'm concerned  
So wipe that dirty smile off  
We won't be making up  
I've cried my heart out  
And now I've had enough of love  
  
Go ahead and still my heart  
To make me cry again  
'Cause it will never hurt  
As much as it did then  
We were both right  
And no one had blame  
But now I give up  
On this endless game  
  
'Cause who wants to be right as rain  
It's better when something is wrong  
I get excitement in my bones  
Even though everything's a strain  
When night comes and I'm on my own  
You should know I chose to be alone  
Who wants to be right as rain  
It's harder when you're on top  
  
'Cause when hard work don't pay off  
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed  
As far as I'm concerned  
So wipe that dirty smile off  
We won't be making up  
I've cried my heart out  
And now I've had enough of love  
  
No room in my bed  
As far as I'm concerned  
So wipe that dirty smile off  
We won't be making up  
I've cried my heart out  
And now I've had enough of love
