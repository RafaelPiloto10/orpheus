We come to you through a storm of lightning  
To drive this place totally insane  
Another show that really keeps us fighting  
For what it takes to blow your mind away  
Hey you, are you ready for tonight  
Can you hear me now  
Let me hear you too  
  
We come to you through a wall of thunder  
Electrified by the sound of the guitars  
Hey you, are you ready for tonight  
Can you see me now  
I want to see you out there  
  
We let it rock to free your energy  
You let it roll, come on get on your feet  
We let it rock to feed your hungry dreams  
You let it roll, up to the ecstasy  
  
We come to you through a burst of fire  
Energized by the feedback of the crowd  
Hey you, are you ready for tonight  
Can you feel me now  
Can you feel the groove  
  
We let it rock to free your energy  
You let it roll, come on get on your feet  
We let it rock to feed your hungry dreams  
You let it roll, up to the ecstasy
