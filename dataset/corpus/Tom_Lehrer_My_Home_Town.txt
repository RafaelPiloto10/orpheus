Next we have the dear-hearts-and-gentle-people's school of songwriting, in
which the singer tells you that, no matter how much sin and vice and crime go
on where he comes from, it's still the be  
Ace in the world because it's home, you know. sort of gets you. this example
is called my home town.  
I really have a yen  
To go back once again,  
Back to the place where no one wears a frown,  
To see once more those super-special just plain folks  
In my home town.  
No fellow could ignore  
The little girl next door,  
She sure looked sweet in her first evening gown.  
Now there's a charge for what she used to give for free  
In my home town.  
I remember dan, the druggist on the corner, 'e  
Was never mean or ornery,  
He was swell.  
He killed his mother-in-law and ground her up real well,  
And sprinkled just a bit  
Over each banana split.  
The guy that taught us math,  
Who never took a bath,  
Acquired a certain measure of renown,  
And after school he sold the most amazing pictures  
In my home town.  
That fellow was no fool  
Who taught our Sunday school,  
And neither was our kindly parson brown.  
We're recording tonight so I have to leave this line out.  
In my home town.  
I remember sam, he was the village idiot.  
And though it seems a pity, it  
Was so.  
He loved to burn down houses just to watch the glow,  
And nothing could be done,  
Because he was the mayor's son.  
The guy that took a knife  
And monogrammed his wife,  
Then dropped her in the pond and watched her drown.  
Oh, yes indeed, the people there are just plain folks  
In my home town.
