Swing your partner dosy-doe  
Move to the rhythm of the DJ flow  
Go round and around until your feet get hot  
Do it to the groove show me what you got  
In my mind, what you go about fine  
In the mean time it's all the way live  
You can't stop moving cause you hear the trance  
Give it up, give it up, come on now dance  
We're feeling OK  
We'll show you the way  
Tonight we'll dance the night away  
We're feeling OK  
We'll show you the way  
Tonight we'll dance the night away  
No we won't, no we won't, no we won't, no we won't go away  
Until we've seen the light of the day  
No we won't, no we won't, no we won't go away  
Everything you believe stay true  
Trouble made, find a way through  
To a wonderful land, no living man has gone  
But in the end that's the own  
With peace and love that will shine on from above  
Come to a land where you will resist  
The magical world you can't miss...
