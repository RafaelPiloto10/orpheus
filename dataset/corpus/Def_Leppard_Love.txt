Love, love look what you've done to my heart  
Oh I should've known from the start  
That, you'd go and tear it apart  
Oh and now you've deserted me  
  
You never lose, you never fail  
You always live to tell the tale  
You take me up, you bring me down  
Without a touch, without a sound  
  
[Chorus]  
Love, love why do I keep searching high and low?  
You take me in your arms and let me go  
  
Oh how long must it be until you, come run back to me can't you see  
I got no release from the pain just to see you again  
  
You never lose, you never fail  
You always live to tell the tale  
You take me up, you bring me down  
Without a touch, without a sound  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love, love, let me go  
  
When will love set me free?  
When will you come back to me?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh love
