Jump in my love car  
Don't have to go very far  
Just far enough to show you a thing or two  
  
I can really swing  
The best of everything  
And I want to have a thing with you  
  
High roller  
What I buy is mine  
And I always get the things that I choose  
My, my, my, such a high roller  
I know he's gone away and left you  
I'll take real good care of you  
  
I'm in the mood for love  
You're all I'm thinking of  
I'll make you feel alright when we're alone  
  
I can really swing  
The best of everything  
And I want to have a thing with you  
  
High roller  
What I buy is mine  
And I always get the things that I choose  
My, my, my, such a high roller, is that you?  
I knew you'd be here tonight  
And I'll make it alright  
I'll take real good care of you  
I'll tuck you in tonight  
And I'll make it alright  
I know he's gone away and left you  
I'll take real good care of you
