Everybody fall in love and then falls down  
And I'm feeling so high, I'm feeling so high  
For you  
Everybody fall in love and then falls down  
And I'm feeling so high, I'm feeling for you  
Boy I'm feeling for you  
  
Don't let the music die  
Don't have to feel alone  
You have to learn to say  
Will be OK tomorrow  
  
Don't let the music die  
Don't have to feel alone  
I got love and many reasons to love  
Reasons to love  
  
Every step that I take brings you closer  
In my dream, in my dream, in my dream  
Every step that I take brings you closer  
In my dream, in my dream, in my dream ? x2  
  
Don't let the music die  
Don't have to feel alone  
You have to learn to say  
Will be OK tomorrow
