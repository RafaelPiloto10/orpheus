I love to see you in your sweater girl  
I love you in your high tall boots  
I love to see you in your sweater girl  
Love to see you walking that cute, you know it  
I love to see you in your leather skin  
Love your lipstick on my sheets  
And I love to see you in your alligator shoes  
Reciting to me my poetry, I really do but  
I hate to see you baby doing that stuff  
I hate to see you doing that stuff  
I hate to see you baby doing that stuff  
Really hate to see you doing that stuff  
I love you baby when you bite my ear  
I don't worry about your uptown geek  
And I love you baby don't you bite your lip  
'Cause it's me you talk to in your sleep and  
I hate to see you baby doing that stuff  
I hate to see you doing that stuff  
I hate to see you baby doing that stuff  
Really hate to see you doing that stuff  
I love to see you in your sweater girl  
Love your alligator chic  
Et je sais te vois dans ton christian la croix  
But I hate to see you walking my street, but  
I hate to see you baby doing that stuff  
I hate to see you doing that stuff  
I hate to see you baby doing that stuff  
Really hate to see you doing that stuff, ha ha
