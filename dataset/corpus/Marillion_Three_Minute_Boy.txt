Here today  
Gone this afternoon  
Another tune we almost remember  
What's the story  
Sex and drugs again  
Business as usual  
The clock's already ticking  
La la la la  
  
When he was young  
Staring at the TV  
He watched the fun happenin' to other people  
Now they scream  
As they run after him  
Like a dream  
Like Elvis and the Beatles  
  
A three minute song is all he wrote  
He only did it for a joke  
They played him on the radio  
From Tokyo to Timbuktu  
A three minute boy, ain't that somethin'  
They named their children after him  
The good times rolled beneath his feet  
He skipped along the one-way street  
  
She's a pretty girl  
She don't know how it started  
She made a movie  
He almost remembered  
She measured up  
They moved into a basement  
"We're so in love!"  
They giggled to the nation  
La la la la  
  
Three minute millionaire they said  
The numbers rattled round his head  
They spun him three times round the globe  
She waited patiently at home  
And all the pretty girls wanted him  
In places that he'd never been  
Too much love will do you in  
Forgive Forgive Forgive Forgive  
Yeah Yeah Ooo  
  
Three minute kid is here again  
Surrounded by three minute friends  
He found someone to understand  
To shock the world and hold his hand  
No religion, no restraint  
No direction, no complaints  
No future and no way out  
No time now to think about it  
All the money's gone  
He don't know what he spent it on  
  
Girlfriends gone off with the Jag  
Gone back to her mum and dad  
He's curled up on the studio floor  
He just can't do it anymore  
The flashgun went off without warning  
He'll read about it tomorrow morning  
  
She's goin' out with someone new  
In this week at number two  
Three minute boy ain't that somethin'
