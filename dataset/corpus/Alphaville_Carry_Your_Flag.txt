We must have played  
For more than ten years  
We must have thought  
That we're immortal  
Shame, shame on us,  
Ah little hussy,  
What did you think I was  
I look at us  
We have grown older  
A lot too much  
For me to take  
I thought  
We were immortal  
I'm so sorry  
I couldn't keep my promise  
To carry on your flag for you  
Some superhero-being  
  
It seems to me  
That we are changing  
There ain't no limit to imagination  
The world just turns around  
Without a care  
Sometimes I feel like crying  
And every time  
I need to touch you  
How can I ever  
Break the distance  
That's why my love  
Became so strong and pure  
That's why I keep on  
Trying forever  
To carry on your flag for you  
Some superhero-being  
For you  
Some superhero-being  
Waiting  
Under the light of the moon  
For you  
I'm coming soon.
