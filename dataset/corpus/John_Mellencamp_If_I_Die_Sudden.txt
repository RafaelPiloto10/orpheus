If I die sudden  
Please don't tell anyone  
There ain't nobody that needs to know  
That I'm gone  
Just put me in a pine box  
Six feet underground  
Don't be calling no minister  
I don't need one around  
  
Well my grandma she told me  
She'd be waiting at the gate  
She said that the fix was in  
And that she's already prayed  
And the rest of my family  
Will be waiting there for me too  
They'd already taken care of my sins  
And there's was nothing for me to do  
  
[Chorus]  
So If I die sudden  
Please don't tell anyone  
There ain't nobody that needs to know  
That I'm gone  
Just put me in a pine box  
Six feet underground  
Don't be calling no minister  
I don't need one around  
I don't need no preacher around  
  
I got a little bit of money  
Some papers you might want to see  
I got a house down in Georgia  
But let's keep this brief  
I'm not afraid of dying  
This life's been right to me  
I got a whole bunch more than I deserve  
And now I will be free  
Yeah now I will be free  
  
[Chorus]
