I'm preserving myself with make-up  
Lookin' in the mirror  
I'm preserving my life, I can take it  
Shinin' in the spotlight  
  
Preservation, lookin' in the mirror  
Preservation, but they don't know that I'm scrapin' it all off  
Every night  
  
I'm reserving my rights, reputation  
Livin' in a movie, it's keepin' me lookin' right  
When the secret is out to the public  
Seein' is believin', they still want to be me at night  
When the parts get shorter, the parties get harder  
But that's alright  
  
Preservation, lookin' in the mirror  
Preservation, but they don't know that I'm scrapin' it off  
Every night  
  
They're linin' up to make their entrance  
When the word's out I'm in town, they're not nice girls  
But that's alright  
They're lookin' so much better when the lights go down  
But nice girls is just a frame of mind  
  
Preservation, lookin' in the mirror  
Preservation, but they don't know that I'm scrapin' it off  
Every night
