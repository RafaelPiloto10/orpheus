You Don't Know What I Feel For You Song Lyrics  
  
My heart is beatin' when I look in your eyes  
I got the feeling it's like far you and I  
When I touch your body I'm out of control  
And I believe I can fly yeah  
  
I know I'm totally addicted to you  
That's why I wrote this special song for you  
I need you love just you by my side  
And I pray every day  
  
I'm waitin' for you it's not and day  
Cos there so much I didn't say  
And I do give me not give to your heart  
To the door (to the door) of the love  
  
You don't know what I feel for you  
I will do anything for you  
I need you baby  
I'm waitin' here for you  
You don't know what I feel for you  
I will do anything for you  
  
Come on get my life  
I want you by my side  
You are the only one I dreamin' of  
My mum tell me what truth of your lies  
My feel strong than the sun and the sky  
I am shine so I cry yeah  
  
I'm waitin' for you it's not and day  
Cos there so much I didn't say  
And I do give me not give to your heart  
To the door (to the door) of the love  
  
Come on girl you that is true  
I do anything  
Come on girl you that is true  
I'm waitin' here for you  
Come on girl you know that is true  
I do anything and I know yes I know  
I will love you 'till the end of time  
  
I'm waitin' for you it's not and day  
Cos there so much I didn't say  
And I do give me not give to your heart  
To the door (to the door) of the love  
  
You don't know what I feel for you  
I will do anything for you  
I need you baby  
I'm waitin' here for you  
You don't know what I feel for you  
I will do anything for you
