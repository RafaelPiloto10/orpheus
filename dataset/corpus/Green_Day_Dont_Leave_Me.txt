I'll go for miles  
Till I find you  
You say you want to leave me  
But you can't choose  
I've gone through pain  
Every day and night  
I feel my mind is going insane  
Something I can't fight  
  
Don't leave me  
Don't leave me  
  
A blank expression  
Covering your face  
I'm looking for directions  
For out of this place  
I start to wonder  
If you'll come back  
I feel the rain storming after thunder  
I can't hold back  
  
Don't leave me  
  
I'll go for miles  
Till I find you  
You say you want to leave me  
But you can't choose  
I've gone through pain  
Every day and night  
I feel my mind is going insane  
Something I can't fight  
  
Don't leave me
