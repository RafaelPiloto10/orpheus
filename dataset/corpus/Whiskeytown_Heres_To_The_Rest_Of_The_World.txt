I know the world is a mess  
I like the patterns on your dress  
Would you have a drink with me please  
Have a couple or three  
I see you walk by  
I don't speak but try  
Have a drink with me please  
Don't say anything  
I look like a mess  
The patterns of your dress...  
They blind me  
  
Here's to the rest of the world  
I guess that you deserve something  
You work so hard at  
Trying to be just like everyone else  
Except people like me  
  
Well, the lights shining down onto the street  
The city lingers as it overheats  
I'm on idle right now  
Don't feel so proud  
Wait for the others to join the crowd  
  
And they come  
Ones  
Threes  
Here's to the rest of the world  
Oh, I don't know  
Here's something that you deserve...  
A drink or two  
Come on and sit down with me  
And we'll pretend everything  
We'll pretend everything  
It's easy.
