Only last night when your arms held me tight  
you told me you thought our love could last forever, forever  
I was the one that gave you all the love when I thought  
that our love could last forever, forever  
  
I lay down and die  
The whole world joins in  
And everyone cries as teardrops begin  
I lay down and die  
And when darkness falls  
can't seem right there at all  
I lay down and die  
The whole world joins in  
  
I lay down and die.  
The teardrops begin.  
I lay down and die.  
And die.  
And die.  
I lay down and die.  
  
The whole world joins in  
I lay down and die and the teardrops begin  
I lay down and die and I lay down and die
