[Verse 1]  
I'm hurting baby, I'm broken down  
I need your loving, loving I need it now  
When I'm without you, I'm something weak  
You got me begging, begging I'm on my knees  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I don't wanna be needing your love  
I just wanna be deep in your love  
And it's killing me when you're away  
Oh baby  
Cause I really don't care where you are  
I just wanna be there where you are  
And I gotta get one little taste  
  
[Chorus]  
Sugar, yes please  
Would you come and put it down on me?  
I'm right here, cause I need  
Little love, a little sympathy  
Yeah you show me good loving, make it alright  
Need a little sweetness in my life  
Your sugar, yes please  
Would you come and put it down on me?  
  
[Verse 2]  
Babe, my broken pieces, you pick them up  
Don't leave me hanging, hanging come give me some  
When I'm without you, I'm so insecure  
You are the one thing, one thing I'm living for  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I don't wanna be needing your love  
I just wanna be deep in your love  
And it's killing me when you're away  
Oh baby  
Cause I really don't care where you are  
I just wanna be there where you are  
And I gotta get one little taste  
  
[Chorus]  
Sugar, yes please  
Would you come and put it down on me?  
I'm right here, cause I need  
Little love, a little sympathy  
Yeah you show me good loving, make it alright  
Need a little sweetness in my life  
Your sugar, yes please  
Would you come and put it down on me?  
  
[Bridge]  
I want that red velvet  
I want that sugar sweet  
Don't let nobody touch it unless that somebody's me  
I gotta be a man, there ain't no other way  
Cause girl you're hotter than the Southern California Bay  
And I wanna play no games, and you don't gotta be be afraid  
Don't give me all that shy shit  
No make-up on, that's my sugar  
  
[Chorus]  
Sugar, yes please  
Would you come and put it down on me?  
I'm right here, cause I need  
Little love, a little sympathy  
Yeah you show me good loving, make it alright  
Need a little sweetness in my life  
Your sugar, yes please  
Would you come and put it down on me?  
  
[Chorus]  
Sugar, yes please  
Would you come and put it down on me?  
I'm right here, cause I need  
Little love, a little sympathy  
Yeah you show me good loving, make it alright  
Need a little sweetness in my life  
Your sugar, yes please  
Would you come and put it down on me?
