You take the train from Yuma,  
Down to Mexicali,  
And by the crack of midnight  
You've got that border town fever,  
  
Well down in Madam Woo's cafe  
In back of She Cat Alley  
Madam Woos mix some Mexicali voodoo  
  
Mexicali Bella  
Bella voodoo  
Americano don't you know what he do  
  
Three days later  
In an elevator  
Three days later Mexicali Bella  
Bella voodoo  
Americano don't know what he do
