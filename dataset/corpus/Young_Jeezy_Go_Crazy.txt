Guess who's bizzack  
Still smell the blow on my clothes  
Like crispy cream I was cooking them o's  
Like horseshoes I was tossin them o's  
Time to re-up gotta recycle the flow  
I'm emotional  
I hug the block  
I'm so emotional  
I love my glock  
Cash rules everything around me  
So what's realer  
Bout the scriller so call me a ghost face killa  
Its kinda hard to be drug free  
When georgia power won't give a nigga lights free  
Switched hustles been killin' 'em ever since  
Been paid to tell the truth it only make sense  
  
[Chorus]  
When they play that new jeezy watch the dope boys go crazy  
And watch the dope boys go crazy  
I pop my collar then I swing my chain  
If you catch me in the club pimpin' doing my thing  
When they play that new jeezy watch the dope boys go crazy  
And watch the dope boys go crazy  
They pop my collar then they swing they chain  
All the gangstas in the street that be doin' they thing  
  
By 18 the hard way  
Now have a humble nigga thinkin' 'bout gun play  
Now who the fuck want to play with guns  
A lotta hoes a lotta blood dog  
That shit ain't fun  
So I suggest that you don't play with my chain  
Or I'll send these hollow's at you  
Let them play with ya brain  
The streets is watchin'  
The name is warm  
The products white  
A star is born  
Pimpin' I'm so fly  
I take this parachute off  
I might fall and die  
Wrap the work with spandex with the latex  
Then we ship it outta town  
Call it safe sex  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Uh, more than a hustla I'm the definition of it  
Master chef, lord of the kitchen cupboard  
More than a street legend, homey it's hova  
More than a relief pitcher, I'm the closer  
The Mariano of the Marriott, ah  
If money talks, the whole world's bout to hear me out  
See I'm a hustler's hope, I'm not his pipe dreams  
So when they speak of success, I'm what they might mean  
Attract money my worst color is light green  
My favorite hue is Jay-Z blue  
Don't follow me young'n, follow my moves, I'm not a role model  
A bad influence got the world drinkin gold bottles  
When puff was in that tub spillin mo'  
I was at my video, cris' on the speedboat  
In my lifetime nigga, go through your research  
St. Thomas my nigga, that was me first  
Chrome shoe'd the gs, I came feet first  
In the game like a baby boo on the breach birth  
I got the keys if you need work  
I can kingpin you a line, the diamond of time (uhh)  
My niggaz love it when I talk like this  
My corporate people start buggin cause I talk like this  
The corporate thugs is like, "Nah hov, talk that shit"  
The dope boys go crazy when they hear that boy jay-z  
See I'ma '80s baby, master  
School of hard knocks, everyday is college  
You ain't did nothin I ain't did, nigga pay homage  
Or pay the doctor, I sprayed lami's  
Still, the time'll reveal, you know I'm bein honest  
Ya ain't put my coat yet and I keep my shit in coat check  
They say the truth shall come to the light  
So everybody grab your chains cause your boy that bright  
  
[Chorus]
