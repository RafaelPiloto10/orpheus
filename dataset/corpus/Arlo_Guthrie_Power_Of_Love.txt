by T-Bone Burnett  
The power of love can make a blind man see  
Can bring a man to his knees  
  
The power of love can make a sultan grieve  
Can make a skeptic believe  
  
[CHORUS:  
The power of love is south of south  
And scorches out all the doubt  
  
The power of love is the name of names  
And burns away all the pain  
  
The power of love can make a gangster cry  
Can make a loser try  
  
The power of love can make a strong man weak  
Can make a bigot meek  
  
[CHORUS]  
The power of love can make a coward brave  
Can make a hero afraid  
  
The power of love can make a miser give  
Can make a dead man live  
  
[CHORUS]  
[CHORUS]
