When I stand before you shining  
In the early morning sun  
When I feel the engines roar  
And I thing of what we've done  
  
Oh, the bittersweet reflection as  
We kiss the earth goodbye  
As the waves and echos of the  
Towns became the ghost of time  
  
Over borders that divide the  
Earthbound tribes  
No greed and no religion  
Just a hungred winged souls  
  
We will ride this thunderbird  
Silver shadows on the earth  
A thousand leagues away  
Our land of birth  
  
To albions land  
Coming home  
When I see the runway lights  
In the misty dawn  
The night is fading fast  
  
Coming home, far away  
As the vapor trails aline  
Where I've been tonight  
You know I will not stay  
  
Carving on the edge of daylight  
Till it slips into the void  
Waited in the long night dreaming  
Till the sun is born again  
  
Stretch the fingers of my hand  
Cover countries with my span  
Just a lonely satellite  
Speck of dust and cosmic sand  
  
Over borders that divide the  
Earthbound tribes  
Through the dark atlantic  
Over mariners stormy waves  
  
We will ride this thunderbird  
Silver shadows on the earth  
A thousand leagues away  
Our land of birth  
  
To albions land  
Coming home  
When I see the runway lights  
In the misty dawn  
The night is fading fast  
  
Coming home, far away  
As the vapor trails aline  
Where I've been tonight  
You know I will not stay  
  
To albions land  
Coming home  
When I see the runway lights  
In the misty dawn  
The night is fading fast  
  
Coming home, far away  
As the vapor trails aline  
Where I've been tonight  
You know I will not stay  
  
Coming home, far away  
When I see the runway lights  
In the misty dawn  
The night is fading fast  
  
Coming home, far away  
As the vapor trails aline  
Where I've been tonight  
You know I will not stay
