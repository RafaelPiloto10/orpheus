Bye bye love  
Bye bye happiness  
Hello loneliness  
I think I'm gonna cry  
  
Bye bye love  
Bye bye sweet caress  
Hello emptiness  
I know I'm gonna die  
Goodbye my love bye bye  
  
There goes our lady  
With a "you know who"  
I hope she's happy  
And "old 'Clapper' too"  
We had good rhythm  
(and a little slide)  
Then she stepped in  
Did me a favour  
I threw them both out.  
  
(Hmm) goodbye happiness  
Hello loneliness  
I think I'm gonna cry  
Bye bye my love bye bye  
(Hmm) bye bye love (Hmm)  
It's gonna be a raining out of doors  
(Hmm) hello happiness (Hmm)  
Goodbye my love goodbye  
  
Now I'm into romance  
I shy away from love  
Got tired of ladies (ooh ooh)  
That plot and shove me  
And that's the reason  
We all can (see) so clearly  
They see that our lady  
Is out on a 'spree'  
  
Bye bye love  
Bye bye happiness  
Hello loneliness  
Think I'm gonna cry  
  
Bye bye love  
Bye bye happiness  
Hello emptiness
