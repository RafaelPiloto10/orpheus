You might believe in heaven  
I would not care to say  
For every star in heaven  
There's a sad soul here today  
Wake up in the morning with a good face  
Stare at the moon all day  
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase  
Does anyone care anyway  
For all the prayers in heaven  
So much of life's this way  
  
Did we leave our way behind us  
Such a long long way behind us  
Who knows when now who knows where  
Where the light of day will find us  
Look for the day  
  
Take heart my friend we love you  
Though it seems like you're alone  
A million light's above you  
Smile down upon your home  
Hurry put your troubles in a suitcase  
Come let the new child play  
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase  
I'm leaving here,I'm long away  
For all the stars in heaven  
I would not live I could not live this way  
  
Did we leave our way behind us  
Such a long long way behind us  
Leave it for some hopeless lane  
Such a long long way such a long long way  
Such a long long way I'm looking for  
Still looking for that day
