Turn loose the lightning metal hawgs  
And set me free  
Turn loose my crying metal hearts'  
1200 C.C.  
Cold steel forever I'm gonna ride  
And burn the flame  
That breaths the fire - breaths the fire  
And can't be tamed  
  
Thunder rolling down the highway  
These wheels of fire eat you alive - them  
Outlaw riders going my way  
A Harley child until I die  
  
Maneater - born free I ride  
Maneater - wings of freedom  
Born the line for metal minds  
  
Run to the scorching desert sun  
V-twins will scream  
Into the blackness of the night, at twisting speed  
High on the hawg I'm riding on  
Engines explode  
It feels like thunder it's breathing fire  
It rules the road  
Milwaukee metal on the highway  
These wheels of fire eat you alive - them  
Outlaw riders going my way  
Only the strong here will survive  
  
Maneater - born free I ride  
Maneater - wings of freedom  
Born the line for metal minds  
  
Them bad boys riding on forever  
When they die they ride in Harley heaven  
  
Maneater - born free I ride  
Maneater - wings of freedom  
Born the line for metal minds  
  
Maneater - born free I ride  
Maneater - wings of freedom  
Born the line for metal minds
