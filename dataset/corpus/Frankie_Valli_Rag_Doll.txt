(Rag doll, ooh) (Hand me down)  
When she was just a kid  
Her clothes were hand-me-downs  
  
(Hand-me-down)  
They always laughed at her when she came into town  
Called her rag doll  
Little rag doll  
  
Such a pretty face should be dressed in lace  
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
(Shag rag doll)  
  
I'd change her sad rags into glad rags  
If I could (if I could)  
My folks won't let me  
'Cause they say that she's no good  
She's a rag doll, such a rag doll  
Though I love her so  
I can't let her know  
  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh oh  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oh  
Aah aah aah aah aah  
I love you just they way you are
