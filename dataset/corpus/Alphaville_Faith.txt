Woke up in the morning still I heard this song  
Must be somewhere from my dreams, I don't know  
Made me feel so good, sun was shining bright  
God, I love you that you brought  
This little song to give me  
Faith  
In the morning  
I need that faith  
To go on, yeah  
Give me some faith  
Can't get enough of that sweet feeling, give me faith  
Oh yeah, I keep the faith  
  
Sweet little girl, lying next to me  
Sunlight's playing on your face with soft shadows  
You're so beautiful, dream on, dream on, baby  
I'm gonna wake you up when the time is right  
I'll give you  
Faith  
One day I shall be released by my creator  
Going home to where I came from long ago  
And the big wheel keeps on turning round and round  
Into eternity with me to cosmic meadows  
I will be there with all my friends  
In the morning  
I need that faith
