The stars must be aligned tonight  
I believe this has to happen baby  
Lightening had to strike to tonight  
'Cause the two of us are finally meeting  
  
In this place at this time  
I feel sane when I look in your eyes  
Feel like I know you from another life  
It makes me wish I wasn't so pressed for time  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't catch my breath 'cause you take it away  
The best writer in town, could not find words to stay  
Now there's so many things I want to get to know  
I wish that I could stay but I got to go  
So I'm gonna call you tonight  
I will baby, just as soon as I get time alone  
I'm gonna call you tonight, I will baby  
Just as soon as I get home  
  
That's the way it goes in life  
You get busy when you just don't want to  
There's never enough time in your life  
You have to make it baby, so I'm goin'  
  
Make a way to connect  
'Cause your face is what I can't forget  
I feel like I know you from another life  
And it makes me wish I wasn't so pressed for time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Destiny, I believe in it  
Meant to be, don't you see it's possible  
That for this kind of magic you think I'm having  
And if you want to know... then stay by the phone  
  
You stay by the phone  
  
[Chorus]
