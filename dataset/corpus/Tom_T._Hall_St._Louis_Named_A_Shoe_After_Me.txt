You know what I've been doin' honey since you said goodbye  
I've been gettin' close to walkin' my one millionth mile  
I walked the floor so much just thinkin' where could you be  
St Louis named a shoe after me  
  
St Louis is famous for its shoes don't you know  
Loafers and sneakers and they're makin' them all with soul  
Honey I walked so doggone much since you set me free  
St Louis named a shoe after me  
  
When I was walkin' all night long and steppin' on my tears  
It never dawned on me that someone out there really cared  
I walked the floor so well I'm gonna do it on TV St Louis named a shoe after
me  
St Louis is famous...  
  
[Trumpet]  
  
Well don't think that I'm braggin' I don't care about that shoe  
Come on home before they name a river for me too  
They're just feeling sorry for me that's plain to see St Louis named a shoe
after me  
St Louis is famous...  
  
St Louis named a shoe after me  
Well you know they didn't name it after Jerry Lee St Louis named a shoe after
me
