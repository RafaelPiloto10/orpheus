Can't take the way you been treatin me  
And its crazy but oh baby  
It don't matta whatever don't faze me  
  
(Ll Cool J) I don't believe you wanna leave like this  
I don't believe I just had my last real kiss  
I do believe we'll laugh and reminice  
Wait a minute don't bounce baby  
Lets talk about this  
  
(J. Lo)well I'm bouncing and I'm out son  
I gotta leave you alone  
  
'Cause I'm good  
Holding down my spot  
And I'm good  
Reppin the girls on the block  
And I'm good  
I got this thing on lock!  
So without me you'll be fine, right?  
  
J. Lo: My pride is all I have  
Ll Cool J: Pride is what you had, baby girl I'm what you have  
J. Lo: You'll be needing me but too bad  
Ll Cool J: Be easy, don't make decisions when you're mad  
J. Lo: The path you chose to run along  
Ll Cool J: I kno your independent you can make it on ur own  
J. Lo: Here with me you have a home  
Ll Cool J: Time is of the essence, why spend it alone?  
  
(J. Lo)The nights I've waited up for you  
Promises you made about coming through  
So much time you wasted,  
That's why I had to replace you  
  
(Ll Cool J)It makes a chap nervous the thought of settling down  
Especially when he's creeping all over town  
I thought my tender touch could lock ya down  
I knew I had you as cocky as that sounds  
The way you used to giggle right before I put it down  
It's better when you're angry come here I'll prove it now (come here)  
  
(J. Lo)Stop playing, you gaming, I got to leave you alone  
  
'Cause I'm good  
Holding down my spot  
And I'm good  
Reppin the girls on the block  
And I'm good  
I got this thing on lock  
So without me you'll be fine, right?  
  
J. Lo: My pride is all I have  
Ll Cool J: Pride is what you had, baby girl I'm what you have  
J. Lo: You'll be needing me but too bad  
Ll Cool J: Be easy, don't make decisions when you're mad  
J. Lo: The path you chose to run along  
Ll Cool J: I kno your independent you can make it on ur own  
J. Lo: Here with me you have a home  
Ll Cool J: Time is of the essence, why spend it alone?  
  
(Ll Cool J)People make mistakes, to make up, to break up  
To wake up cold and lonely  
And chill baby you kno me, you love me, I'm like your homie  
Insteada beefing come hold me, I promise I'm not a phony  
Don't bounce baby, console me, come here  
  
(J. Lo)Ain't Nothin' you can say to me that can change my mind  
I gotta let you go now, Nothin will ever be the same  
So just be on your way, go ahead and do your thing now  
And theres no more to explain to me ya kno  
I know ya game I'm not feelin' what you do(and I'm good)  
So I'm bouncing and I'm out son (I'm good)  
I gotta leave you alone yeah yeah  
  
J. Lo: My pride is all I have  
Ll Cool J: Pride is what you had, baby girl I'm what you have  
J. Lo: You'll be needing me but too bad
