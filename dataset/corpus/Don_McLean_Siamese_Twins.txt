I find you in my arms, this is how it begins  
and we are so close, like Siamese twins.  
Though you're separate from me, and we're often apart  
Still nobody can see, that we're joined at the heart.  
Joined at the heart.  
Joined at the heart.  
Joined at the heart.  
  
You don't look like me it's true and I don't look like you  
as we lead separate lives our secret still survives  
  
Only we know our special affection,  
only we know our secret connection.  
  
Now you're back in my arms, at the end of the day  
and like Siamese twins, with each other we'll stay.  
Though you're separate from me, and we're often apart  
Still nobody can see, that we're joined at the heart.  
Joined at the heart.  
Joined at the heart.  
Still nobody can see, that we're joined at the heart.
