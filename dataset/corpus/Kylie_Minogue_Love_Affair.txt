Here in the moment I belong  
In a waking dream  
The night is young  
But isn't long  
If you know what I mean  
Oh it's beautiful  
The thought of what might be  
Close your eyes so you can see  
  
I am only here for a little while  
Would you like to take me out to night  
Maybe we could talk for a little while, baby  
  
Now we've only just begun  
We're running out of time  
I don't want to think about the sun  
No not to night  
Oh it's wonderful you being here with me  
Close your eyes so you can see  
  
I am only here for a little while  
Would you like to take me out to night  
Maybe we could talk for a little while, baby  
Don't hold back it's time for a love affair  
Take my hand lead me to anywhere  
Maybe there's something in the air, baby  
  
Together here, together now  
In the moment that we met  
Remember here remember now  
It's to E-Z to for get  
  
Oh it's wonderful you being here with me  
Close your eyes so you can see  
  
I am only here for a little while  
Would you like to take me out to night  
Maybe we could talk for a little while, baby  
Don't hold back it's time for a love affair  
Take my hand lead me to anywhere  
Maybe there's something in the air, baby
