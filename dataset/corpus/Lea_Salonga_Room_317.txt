Kim: Lea Salonga  
Ellen: Claire Moore  
  
(A hotel room)  
  
Kim  
Good evening, maam  
  
Ellen  
Don't turn the bed yet  
  
Kim  
I'm not the maid  
  
Ellen  
What do you want then?  
  
Kim  
They must have written the room number wrong  
I am looking for someone named Christopher Scott  
Three-seventeen, oh I'm sorry... Unless  
Well, you must be, of course, you're John's wife, are you not?  
  
Ellen  
Oh God, I see  
It had to happen  
You must be Kim  
Chris went to find you  
Please come inside  
No one will hurt you  
I'm Chris's wife  
My name is Ellen  
  
(Kim doesn't move)  
  
Ellen  
In a way, I am glad I am meeting you first  
Understand, you were only a name till tonight  
I don't know how I'd feel if our roles were reversed  
Please won't you sit down  
  
Kim  
Tell me you are lying  
  
Ellen  
We've been married a year, I am sorry, it's true  
  
Kim  
He said he'd come to get me  
  
Ellen  
He says he tried to reach you, but what could he do?  
  
Kim  
Please tell me you're not married  
You don't know, you can't know what I've done to be here  
  
Ellen  
You don't know how he needed a new start  
  
Kim  
I feel walls in my heart  
Closing in  
I can't breathe  
I can't win  
  
Ellen  
As for the child  
You say it's Chris's  
  
Kim  
Oh yes, Madame  
My son is Chris's  
I had a dream for my son to belong  
And not live his life in the streets like a rat  
  
Ellen  
We aren't rich, but we'll shoulder our load  
Chris and I are totally together on that  
  
Kim  
Then you must take Tam with you  
  
Ellen  
Take a child from his mother, impossible Kim  
  
Kim  
You will take Tam with you  
Then he'll get what I wanted for him  
  
Ellen  
But Kim, your child needs you  
Chris is married to me, we want kids of our own  
  
Kim  
Tam's chance lies with you now, not with me  
  
Both  
No!  
Can't you see  
It won't work  
It can't be  
  
Kim  
If you're saying that because you've made him change his mind  
Chris must go away and leave me and his son behind  
If you're saying that because my husband has another wife  
My child has no future, like the dust of life  
He must come tonight to my place  
Tell me so to my face  
  
(Kim exits)  
  
Ellen  
I don't want this  
I didn't come here  
To meet a girl  
Who loves my husband  
I came here to help, but what do I do?  
Now, after this, what do I. ..
