Makin' plans for your escape  
Get between all the ricochets  
Assume positions in the sky  
Fly away with the butterflies  
Rest your head in Pacific grove  
Lose yourself down in Mexico  
Wanna taste of the monkey brains  
Take a bite man, don't be shy  
  
[Chorus]  
They're comin' after you!  
They're comin' after you!  
It's all you can do  
They're comin' after you!  
  
Got your file and your DNA  
Membership in the NRA  
On the list with the FBI  
Yearbook pics from the junior high  
Camouflage in your orange and black  
Soar above all the ground attacks  
Safe and sound on this coastal plane  
Celebrate with the cheap champagne  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Generations trying to find a home  
A thousand miles away from what they know  
It's time to go  
  
Generations trying to find a home  
A thousand miles away from what they know  
It's time to go  
  
[Chorus]
