I know that I'm not the first one  
You have love in your path before me  
But when your lips touched my lips  
It felt like I was kissing destiny  
  
Angel eyes with your angel eyes  
Will you always be there to hold me  
Angel eyes I'm satisfied  
I don't want to hear your story  
  
'Cause I can see the things  
I really want to see  
I'm in love  
I believe in what I'm feeling  
  
I'd give everything up just for you  
Love is devoted to those who see  
That the last dance, you dance with the truth  
Angel eyes with your angel eyes  
  
Will you always be there to hold me  
Angel eyes I'm satisfied  
I don't want to hear your story  
'Cause I can see the things  
  
I really want to see  
In your eyes  
Angel eyes just want you here to hold me  
Angel eyes
