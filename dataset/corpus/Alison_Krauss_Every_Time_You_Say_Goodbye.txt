Look at the sky, baby  
What do you see?  
Looks like the tears that I cry  
Fallin' down like rain on the ground  
Every time you say goodbye  
  
Take a look around now  
Why don't you feel  
The way that cold wind stings and bites  
And your words just are like arrows through my heart  
Every time you say goodbye  
  
There's a restless feeling knocking at my door today  
There's a shadow hanging 'round my garden gate  
I read between the lines of words you can't disguise  
Love has gone away, and put these tears in my eyes  
  
Look at the sky, baby, see how it cries?  
Ain't it just like my tears  
Fallin' down like rain on the ground  
Every time you say goodbye  
  
There's a restless feeling knocking at my door today  
There's a shadow hanging 'round my garden gate  
I read between the lines of words you can't disguise  
Love has gone away, and put these tears in my eyes  
  
There's a restless feeling knocking at my door today  
There's a shadow hanging 'round my garden gate  
I read between the lines of words you can't disguise  
Love has gone away, and put these tears in my eyes
