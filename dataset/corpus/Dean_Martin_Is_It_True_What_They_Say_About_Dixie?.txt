Is it true what they say about Dixie  
Does the sun really shine all the time  
Do the sweet magnolias blossom at everybody's door  
Do the folks keep eating possum til they can't eat no more  
  
Is it true what they say about Swanny  
Is a dream by the stream so sublime  
Do they laugh do they love like they say in every song  
If it's true that's where I belong  
  
Is it true what they say about Dixie  
Does the sun really shine all the time  
Well do the sweet magnolias blossom at everybody's door  
Do the folks keep eating that possum til they can't eat no more  
  
Is it true what they say about Swanny  
Is a dream by the stream so sublime  
Do they laugh love like they say in every song  
If it's true that's where I belong
