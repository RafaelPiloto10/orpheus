All aboard, watch your step, people  
Last call for the Nightmare Express  
  
I found myself slippin' away  
Just this side of dead  
I woke up in a boxcar  
I wasn't in my bed  
  
I found my leg chained to a spike  
That ran down through the floor  
Attached to thirteen angry men  
All rotten to the core  
  
"But I'm innocent," I cried right out  
"I'm in someone else's dream"  
They looked around and laughed out loud,  
Said, "Brother, so are we  
Yeah, brother, so are we"  
"But I'm a big celebrity  
Known all 'round the land"  
"Well buddy, you ain't no one here  
Man, you ain't in demand"  
  
Speedin' towards a flamin' wall  
Like a screamin' sonic boom  
I really gotta wake up now  
Or I may meet my doom, oh Lord  
I may meet my doom  
  
So all that I remember  
Is how much my body hurt  
Now I'm sleepin' in the graveyard  
On the wrong side of the dirt  
Now, on the wrong side of the dirt  
Wrong side of the dirt, don't you know,  
I'm on the wrong side of the dirt
