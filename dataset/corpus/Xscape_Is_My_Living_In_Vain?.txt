Is my living in vain?  
Is my giving in vain?  
Is my singing in vain?  
Is my praying in vain?  
  
No, of course not.  
  
It's not all in vain,  
Because up the road is eternal gain.  
  
Am I wasting my time?  
Can the clock be rewind?  
Have I let my light shine?  
Have I made ninety nine?  
  
No, of course not.  
No, of course not.  
No, of course not.  
No, of course not.  
  
It's not all in vain,  
Because up the road is eternal gain.  
  
No, of course not.  
No, of course not.  
No, of course not.  
No, of course not.  
  
It's not all in vain,  
Because up the road is eternal gain.
