Sun is shinin' in the sky  
There ain't a cloud in sight  
It's stopped rainin' everybody's in a play  
And don't you know  
It's a beautiful new day hey  
  
Runnin' down the avenue  
See how the sun shines bright in the city  
On the streets where once was pity  
Mister blue sky is living here today hey  
  
Mister blue sky please tell us why  
You had to hide away for so long, so long  
Where did we go wrong?
