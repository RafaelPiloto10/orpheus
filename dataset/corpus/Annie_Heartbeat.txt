There was a time  
Everybody was around and I was dancing with you  
We all went down to the party Friday night  
And had a drink there or two  
Oh what a heat  
I feel love and heart beat  
It's electricity  
Majestic sound, round and round and round, got you next to me  
  
Feel my heartbeat drumming to the beat  
Like a symphony  
Feel my heartbeat drumming to the beat  
Like a melody, come see  
  
Feel my heartbeat drumming to the beat  
Like a symphony  
Feel my heartbeat drumming to the beat  
Like a melody, come see  
  
Time after time everybody came around  
And I was dancing with you  
Don't know your name,  
Making me ashamed  
To feel the way that I do  
The lights went out  
Couldn't leave without you, this is the place to be  
I won't forget  
The greatest times I've had when I was dancing with you  
  
Feel my heartbeat drumming to the beat  
Like a woman in love  
Feel my heartbeat drumming to the beat  
Like a woman in love so high  
  
Feel my heartbeat drumming to the beat  
Like a symphony  
Feel my heartbeat drumming to the beat  
Like a melody, come see  
  
Feel my heartbeat  
Feel my heartbeat  
Feel my heartbeat  
  
There was a time when everybody was around and I was dancing with you  
Don't know your name,  
Making me ashamed  
To feel the way that I do  
The lights went out  
Couldn't leave without you, this is the place to be  
I won't forget  
The greatest times I've had when I was dancing with you
