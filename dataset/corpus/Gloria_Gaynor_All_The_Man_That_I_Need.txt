Precious darling, you know you're my man  
All you got to do is wave your hand  
Yes, I cherish all you got to give  
I don't need nothing' else to live  
  
All I need is your sweet lovin'  
All I want is to feel it comin'  
All I need is your sweet lovin'  
All I want is your love  
  
Taste that honey flowin' from your lips  
I start shakin' from your fingertips  
[Unverified] steady, movin' right on time  
Feel so warm in these arms of mine  
  
All I need is your sweet lovin'  
All I want is to feel it comin'  
All I need is your sweet lovin'  
All I want is your love  
  
Now darlin', when I'm with you  
Say, it feels so good inside  
It's just makin' love to you  
I'm so satisfied  
  
All I need is your sweet lovin'  
All I want is to feel it comin'  
All I need is your sweet lovin'  
All I want is your love  
Yeah, baby
