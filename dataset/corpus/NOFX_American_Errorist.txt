It's okay  
Allow yourself a little hate  
Hatred is not so bad  
When directed at injustice  
You can turn the other cheek  
Just don't turn the other way  
  
Enemy of the planet  
We finally have a common hate  
A reason to forget about our differences  
And stand as a united front  
It's up to us, we must expose, humiliate  
American Errorists  
We'll start with one  
  
((The... War... Has... Just begun))  
((The... War... Has... Just begun))
