Baby baby baby, yeah  
Western Union man  
Send me a telegraph  
  
My love has taken a tumble  
Oh, but I'm still standing  
You're such a natural, sing,  
It's that what you are  
  
Say I wouldn't steer you wrong now baby  
I wouldn't steer you wrong  
  
It's just that sweet little mystery  
That makes me try, try, try, try  
It makes me try sweet little mystery  
That makes me try, try, try, try  
  
Shake a bitty  
  
Didn't I come insisting a sight of wonder  
Didn't I come resisting a higher decision  
Didn't I come insisting a sight of wonder  
To your life  
  
Say I wouldn't steer you wrong now baby  
I wouldn't steer you wrong  
  
It's just that sweet little mystery  
That makes me try, try, try, try  
It's just that sweet little mystery  
That makes me try, try, try, try  
Sweet little mystery  
That makes me try, try, try, try  
It makes me try, sweet little mystery  
That makes me try,  
It makes me try, try, try, try  
  
And oh, just think of the magic ooh-ooh  
Don't think it is tragic, hey hey hey  
Just think of the magic  
  
Come on listen  
  
My love has taken a tumble, woh woh  
My love has taken a tumble  
C'mon its, my love has taken a tumble  
But I'm still standing  
  
And if only, only, only, only, only  
Only love me like you used to do  
  
Just that sweet little mystery  
That makes me try try try try  
  
Come on listen, hey  
Try, try, try, try, try, try, try, try, try  
Try, try, try, try, try, try,  
  
C'mon, c'mon  
My love has taken a tumble  
My love has taken a tumble  
My love has taken a tumble  
Say I'm still standing
