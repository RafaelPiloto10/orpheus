Well you can't be my lovin' baby, you ain't got the style  
I'm gonna get some real gone love  
That'll drive a cool cat wild  
I'm gonna move, rollin' right on down  
  
Gonna get me a gal that'll go out on the town  
Well you move on down the line  
I'm gonna get me a gal that'll make some time  
She can't be square, she can't be slow  
  
'Cause when we start struttin', gotta go-go-go  
Well I'm gonna show you ain't so hot  
I'm gonna get what you ain't got  
She'll be sweet, won't do me wrong  
  
She'll be cool and twice as gone  
You gotta roll, move it right on down  
Gonna get me a gal that'll go out on the town  
Well you move on down the line  
  
I'm gonna get me a gal that'll make some time  
She can't be square, she can't be slow  
'Cause when we start struttin', gotta go-go-go
