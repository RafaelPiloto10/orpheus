[Sister Sadie to Jesse]  
  
Strip off your things  
And bow to your queen  
And cleanse the sins of your life  
Get on your knees  
Gonna beg and bleed  
No one hears you - you belong to me  
Reaper of your sorrow's seed  
Black habits tonight  
Your only sin  
Was coming into Sadie's life  
  
[Jesse to Sister Sadie]  
  
Sister of No Mercy please  
I'm praying to die  
Can I cleanse my orphan sins  
And save my soul tonight - when  
  
I don't believe  
I don't believe  
In a God of love  
I won't deceive  
I don't conceive at all  
  
I don't believe  
I don't believe  
In a God above  
I don't believe  
I won't receive no more  
  
[Sister Sadie to Jesse]  
  
What I do to thee  
Is what was done to me  
Sins of the fathers lives  
And do you feel  
There's a God for real  
Ooh your only God is me  
  
[Jesse to Sister Sadie]  
  
Reaper of my sorrow's seed  
And my screams in the night  
My only sin was coming into Sadie's life  
Sister of No Mercy please  
I'm praying to die  
Can I cleanse my orphan sins  
And save my soul tonight - when  
  
I'm fucked for life  
Blind and tied nobody sees  
I'm fucked for life  
I'm the child no mother needs  
I'm fucked for life  
The cries of night for all Sadie's needs  
I'm fucked for life  
I'm the child nobody sees  
  
[Sister Sadie to Jesse]  
  
Oh you, I'll make you think you're dying  
This room cleansing time again  
I'll take you to this House of Sorrows  
I'll break your Neon Heart of sin  
  
[Jesse to Sister Sadie]  
  
Oh are you mad  
I'm going fast  
Habits in black  
No coming back  
No Mercy me  
This Hell is real  
Why me ya see  
She's here killing me
