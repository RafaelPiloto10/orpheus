I know a thing or two about her  
I know she'll only make you cry  
She'll let you walk the street beside her  
But when she wants she'll pass you by  
  
Everybody says she's lookin' good  
And the lady knows it's understood  
Strutter  
  
She wears her satins like a lady  
She gets her way just like a child  
You take her home and she saysm "Maybe, baby"  
She takes you down and drives you wild  
  
Everybody says she's lookin' good  
And the lady knows it's understood  
Strutter

Strutter
