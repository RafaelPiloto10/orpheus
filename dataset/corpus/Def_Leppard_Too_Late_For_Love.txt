Somewhere in the distance I hear the bells ring  
Darkness settles on the town as the children start to sing  
And the lady 'cross the street she shuts out the night  
There's a cast of thousands waiting  
As she turns out the light  
  
But it's too late, too late, too late  
Too late for love  
Yes it's too late, too late, too late  
Too late for love  
  
London boys are gazing as the girls go hand in hand  
With a pocket full of innocence, their entrance is grand  
And the queen of the dream stands before them all  
She stretches out her hand as the curtains start to fall  
  
But it's too late, too late, too late  
Too late for love  
Yes it's too late, too late, it's too late  
Too late for love  
With a pocket full of innocence, their entrance is grand  
And the queen of the dream stands before them all  
She stretches out her hand as the curtain starts to fall  
  
But it's too late, too late, too late  
Too late for love  
Yes it's too late, too late, it's too late  
Too late for love  
  
Standing by the trapdoor aware of me and you  
Are the actor and the clown they're waiting for their cue  
And there's a lady over there she's acting pretty cool  
But when it comes to playing life  
She always plays the fool  
  
But it's too late, too late, it's too late  
Too late for love  
It's too late, it's too late, too late  
Too late for love  
  
Is it all too late  
Much too late  
Can't you see it's all too late  
It's too late  
  
But it's too late, too late, it's too late  
Too late for love  
It's too late, it's too late, too late  
Too late for love
