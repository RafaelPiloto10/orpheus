[Chorus]  
Song, song of the south  
Sweet potato pie and I shut my mouth  
Gone, gone with the wind  
There ain't nobody looking back again  
  
Cotton on the roadside, cotton in the ditch  
We all picked the cotton but we never got rich  
Daddy was a veteran, a southern democrat  
They oughta get a rich man to vote like that  
  
Sing it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well somebody told us Wall Street fell  
But we were so poor that we couldn't tell  
Cotton was short and the weeds were tall  
But Mr. Roosevelt's a gonna save us all  
  
Well momma got sick and daddy got down  
The county got the farm and they moved to town  
Pappa got a job with the TVA  
He bought a washing machine and then a Chevrolet  
  
Sing it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Play it  
  
Sing it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Song, song of the south  
  
Gone, gone with the wind  
  
Song, song of the south.  
Sweet potato pie and I shut my mouth.  
Song, song of the south.  
Sweet potato pie and I shut my mouth.  
  
Sing it  
  
[Chorus: x2]
