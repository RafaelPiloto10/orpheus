She's got a ballpark figure  
He's got a ballpoint pen  
Travel around for weeks at a time  
Writin' down descriptions of the places they been  
She plays guitar but nothing fancy  
With no intention of becoming a star  
Only thing that's bothering him these days  
Is where he's gonna find a good ten cent cigar  
  
Cliches, good ways  
Say what you mean, mean what you say  
She never did make her debut  
He never made it to class  
She's 86'd from the Chart Room  
He's 29 and pushin' 30 real fast  
They're funny when they get to rockin'  
Goin' out for the night on the town  
Takin' Polaroid pictures that are never in focus  
Just to look at when they finally slow down  
Full moon, so soon  
Wishin' every month of the year could be June  
  
He's always tuned into Star Trek  
She's always tuned into him  
Hidin' his cookies when he gets the munchies  
Tryin' hard just to keep the boy slim  
Tonight they're gonna go star gazing  
And try to figure out which one they're near  
Try as they might I don't think they'll reach the height  
She know you can't get there from here  
  
Full moon, so soon  
Wishin' every month of the year could be June  
Cliches, good ways  
Say what you mean, mean what you say  
Just say what you mean, mean what you say
