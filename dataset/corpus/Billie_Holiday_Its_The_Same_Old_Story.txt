The same old story  
It's as old as the stars above  
The same old story  
Of a boy and a girl in love  
The scenes say more moonlight  
The times say more June light  
Romance's the thing  
Two hearts away deep in a dream  
  
The same old story  
It's been told much too much before  
The same old story  
But it's worth telling just once more  
It's all fun and laughter  
They lived ever after in ecstasy  
The same old story but it's new to me
