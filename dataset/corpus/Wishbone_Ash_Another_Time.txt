You never told me you'd be waiting,  
You never told me you'd be there.  
Nothing was said, but it was understood.  
I never doubted that you'd care.  
Another time, another memory,  
Like the light from a burning star.  
Another time you will come back to me  
Like a messenger from afar.  
Now the storm breaks without a warning,  
With no time for us to prepare.  
Now more than ever how I need you.  
I never doubted you'd be there.  
Oh, the prophecy  
Of what it's gonna be  
For you and me,  
Oh, forgive me if I wander  
From the path that we were on.  
You never told me you'd be waiting,  
You never told me you'd be there.  
Now more than ever how I need you.  
I never doubted you'd be there.
