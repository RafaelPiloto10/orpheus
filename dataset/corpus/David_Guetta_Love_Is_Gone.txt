Now that the love is gone!  
  
What are we supposed to do  
After all that we've been through  
When everything that felt so right is wrong  
Now that the love is gone?  
  
Love is gone  
  
What are we supposed to do  
After all that we've been through  
When everything that felt so right is wrong  
Now that the love is gone?  
There is nothing left to prove  
No use to deny this simple truth  
Can't find the reason to keep holding on  
Now that the love is gone, love is gone  
  
Now that the love is gone, what felt so right's so wrong  
Now that the love is gone  
  
I feel so hurt inside, feel so hurt inside, got to find the reason  
  
What are we supposed to do  
After all that we've been through  
When everything that felt so right is wrong  
Now that the love is gone?  
There is nothing left to prove  
No use to deny this simple truth  
Can't find the reason to keep holding on  
Now that the love is gone, love is gone  
  
Got to find a reason, got to find a reason,  
Got to find a reason to hold!  
  
Love, there's nothing left for us to say, yeah!  
Love, why can't we turn and walk away?  
  
What are we supposed to do  
After all that we've been through  
When everything that felt so right is wrong  
Now that the love is gone?  
There is nothing left to prove  
No use to deny this simple truth  
Can't find the reason to keep holding on  
Now that the love is gone, love is gone  
  
Love is gone!
