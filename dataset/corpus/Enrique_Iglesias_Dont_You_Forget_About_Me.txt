They say love is just a game  
They say time can heal the pain  
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose  
And I guess I'm just a fool  
I keep holding on to you  
  
I told you once you were the one  
You know that I die for you  
Oh, though it hurts to see you go  
Oh, this time you should know  
I won't try to stop you  
  
Don't you forget about me baby  
Don't you forget about me now  
Some day you'll turn around and ask me, why did I let you go  
  
So you try to fake a smile  
You don't wanna break my heart  
I can see that you're afraid  
But baby it's to late  
'Cause I'm already dying  
  
Don't you forget about me baby  
Don't you forget about me now  
Some day you'll turn around and ask me, why did I let you go  
  
Don't you forget about me baby  
Don't you forget about me now  
Some day you'll turn around and ask me, why did I let you go  
  
Why did I let you  
  
Don't you forget about me baby  
Don't you forget about me now  
Some day you'll turn around and ask me, why did I let you go  
  
Why did I let you go  
  
Wherever I go  
I won't forget about you  
Oh no, no, no  
Wherever you go  
Don't you forget about me
