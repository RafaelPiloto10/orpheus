Mama said, "Don't go near that river  
Don't be hanging around Old Catfish John  
Come in the morning, I'd always be there  
Walking in his footsteps in the Sweet Delta Dawn"  
  
Take me back to another morning  
To a time so long ago  
When the sweet Magnolia blossomed  
Cotton fields as white as snow  
  
Catfish John was a river hobo  
Who lived and died by the river's bed  
Looking back, I still remember  
I was proud to be his friend  
  
Mama said, "Don't go near that river  
Don't be hanging around Old Catfish John  
Come in the morning, I'd always be there  
Walking in his footsteps in the Sweet Delta Dawn"  
  
Born a slave in the town of Vicksburg  
Traded for a chestnut mare  
Lord, her never spoke in anger  
Though his load was hard to bear  
  
Mama said, "Don't go near that river  
Come in the morning, I'd always be there  
Walking in his footsteps in the Sweet Delta Dawn  
Walking in his footsteps in the Sweet Delta Dawn"
