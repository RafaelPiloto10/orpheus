The time has come to watch you go watch you go  
We weathered rough storms together  
Couldn't conceive of the end  
When I heard of your leavin'  
It came as a shock and surprise  
Like the deepest kinds of love  
Lost on the inside  
Locked right on the inside  
  
What is the greatest expression of love,  
To let go and wish well  
But all these finer feelings  
have left me with tears to tell  
  
I couldn't be the one to hold you stop you go  
It is like stripping the soul  
Letting all the finest pieces go  
You know these feelings between us  
Could not be expressed  
You will never know my old secrets  
They are so deeply felt they are so deeply felt  
  
What is the greatest expression of love  
To let go and wish well  
But all these finer feelings have left me  
What is the greatest expression of love,  
To let go and wish well  
But all these finer feelings  
have left me with tears to tell  
  
Leaving me with my anecdoted and private jokes  
The memory of a friend  
You don't seem to know my old secrets  
They are so deeply felt they are so deeply felt  
  
What is the greatest expression of love  
To let go and wish well  
But all these finer feelings have left me  
What is the greatest expression of love  
To let go and wish well  
But all these finer feelings  
have left me with tears to tell  
But all these finer feelings  
have left me with tears to tell
