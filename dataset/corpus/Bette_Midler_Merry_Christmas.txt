Merry Christmas  
Have a very, very Merry Christmas  
Dream about your heart's desire  
Christmas Eve when you retire  
  
Santa Claus will stop  
And I know he'll drop  
Exactly what you wanted  
From your chimney top  
  
So be jolly, have a holiday as gay as holly  
May the ones you love be near you  
With the laugh of friends to cheer you  
  
When the church bells ring  
Like the angels sing  
And you hear the joyful hymn they chime  
  
Hang a wish from me on your Christmas tree  
For a very Merry Christmas time
