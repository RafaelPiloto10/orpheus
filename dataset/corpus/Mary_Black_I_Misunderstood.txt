He said darling I'm in love with you mind  
The way you care for me it's so kind  
Love to see you again wish I had more time  
He was laughing as he brushed my cheek  
Why don't you call me baby maybe next week  
Promise now cross your heart and hope to die  
  
Chorus  
  
But I misunderstood  
But I misunderstood  
But I misunderstood  
I thought he was saying good luck  
He was saying goodbye  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Things I tried to put shine in his eyes  
Wire wheels and shimmering things  
Wild nights when the whole world seemed to fly  
He said the thing that's so unique  
When we're together we don't have to speak  
We'll always be such good friends you and I  
  
Chorus  
  
But I misunderstood  
But I misunderstood  
But I misunderstood  
I thought he was saying good luck  
He was saying goodbye  
  
Repeart Chorus
