Did I ever ever love you?  
Did I ever really care?  
All the times that I cried for you  
Did I really want you there?  
Wiser man then I have wondered  
About love and never knew  
Did I ever love you?  
I guess I still do  
  
All the nights that I spent cryin'  
All those lonely loss of times  
Was it my imagination?  
Was it only in my mind?  
Wiser man then I have wondered  
About love and never knew  
Did I ever love you?  
I guess I still do
