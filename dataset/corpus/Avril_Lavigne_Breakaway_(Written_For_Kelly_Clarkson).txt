Grew up in a small town,  
And when the rain would fall down,  
I'd just stare out my window.  
  
Dreaming of what could be,  
And if I'd end up happy.  
I would pray.  
  
Trying not to reach out  
But when I try to speakout  
Felt like no one could hear me  
  
Wanted to belong here  
But something felt so wrong here  
So I pray I could breakaway  
  
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly.  
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky.  
Make a wish, take a chance,  
Make a change, and break away.  
Out of the darkness and into the sun.  
But I won't forget all the ones that I love.  
I'll take a risk, take a chance,  
Make a change, and break away.  
  
Wanna feel the warm breeze.  
Sleep under a palm tree.  
Feel the rush of the ocean.  
Get onboard a fast train.  
Travel on a jetplane.  
Far away,  
And break away.  
  
I'm spreadin' my wings and I'll learn how to fly.  
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky.  
Make a wish, take a chance,  
Make a change, and break away.  
Out of the darkness and into the sun.  
But I won't forget all the ones that I love.  
I'll take a risk, take a chance,  
Make a change, and break away.  
  
Buildings with a hundred floors.  
Swinging with revolving doors.  
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me.  
Gotta keep movin on movin on.  
Fly away,  
Break away.  
  
I'm spreadin' my wings and I'll learn how to fly.  
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye,  
Take a risk, take a chance,  
Make a change, and break away.  
Out of the darkness and into the sun.  
But I won't forget the place I come from,  
I gotta take a risk, take a chance,  
Make a change, and break away.  
I should Breakaway.  
Break away.
