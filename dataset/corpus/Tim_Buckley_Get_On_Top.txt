Well that girl walks in a stormy bitching whine  
Well she moves that cobra waltz all across the floor  
Tell your mama to sing out, like a slow burn  
Slow burn your motel walls, over me.  
  
Get on top of me woman  
Get on top, let me breath  
Get on top of me woman  
Let me see what you learned tonight  
Then I talk in tongues, mama  
  
Oh when I love you  
Yes I talk in tongues  
  
Get on top of me woman,  
Get on top, let me breath  
Get on top of me, woman  
I just wanna see what you learned  
  
Well like a bitch dog in heat, mama  
We had those bed springs squeakin' all night long  
And didn't you hear those walls a talkin' voodoo  
I feel you right feel you right with me  
  
Get on top of me woman,  
Get on top let me breath  
Get on top of me woman  
Let me see what you learned tonight  
I talk in tongues, mama  
Oh when I love you  
I talk in tongues,honey
