Everything's cool, yeah  
It's all gonna be okay, yeah  
And I know,  
Maybe I'll even  
Laugh about it someday  
  
But not today, no  
Cause I don't feel so good  
I'm tangled up inside  
My heart is on my sleeve  
Tomorrow is a mystery to me  
  
[Chorus]  
And it might be wonderful  
It might be magical  
It might be everything I've waited for,  
A miracle  
Oh, and even if I fall in love again  
With someone new  
It could never be the way I loved you  
  
Letting you go is  
Making me feel so cold, yeah  
And I've been trying to make  
Believe it doesn't hurt  
  
But that makes it worse, yeah  
See, I'm a wreck inside  
My tongue is tied and my  
Whole body feels so weak  
The future may be all I really need  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Like a first love,  
The one and only true love  
Wasn't it written all over my face, yeah  
I loved you like you loved me (oh)  
Like something pure and holy  
Like something that can never be replaced  
  
And it was be wonderful,  
It was magical,  
It was everything I've waited for,  
A miracle  
And if I should ever fall in love again  
With someone new  
Oh, It could never be the way  
No, It will never be the way  
I loved you
