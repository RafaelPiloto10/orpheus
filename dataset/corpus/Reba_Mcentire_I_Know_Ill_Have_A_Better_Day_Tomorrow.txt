Well I can't make it through this world by myself  
I need heaven's help to make through the day  
And if I go to bed tonight  
And remember to say my prayers  
I know I'll have a better day tomorrow  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause you've done what you said you'd do  
And you've given me lots of love  
And I've never known such peace  
Since I met you  
I'm so proud to be your child  
And I'm doing the best I can  
And I know I'll have a better day tomorrow  
  
Well  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know I'll have a better day tomorrow
