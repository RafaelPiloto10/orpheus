She floats like a swan  
Grace on the water  
Lips like sugar  
Lips like sugar  
  
Just when you think you've caught her  
She glides across the water  
She calls for you tonight  
To share this moonlight  
  
She'll flow down your river  
And ask him and she'll give you  
  
Lips like sugar  
Sugar kisses  
Lips like sugar  
Sugar kisses  
  
She knows what she knows  
I know what she's thinking  
Sugar kisses  
Sugar kisses  
  
Just when you think she's yours  
She's flown to other shores  
To laugh at how you break  
To melt into this lake  
  
She'll flow down your river  
And ask him and she'll give you  
  
Lips like sugar  
Sugar kisses  
Lips like sugar  
Sugar kisses  
  
She'll be my mirror  
Reflect what I am  
A loser and a winner  
The King of Siam  
And my Siamese twin  
She knows what I'm thinking  
???  
  
She'll flow down your river  
And ask him and she'll give you  
  
Lips like sugar  
Sugar kisses  
Lips like sugar  
Sugar kisses
