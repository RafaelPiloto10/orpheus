When you're ready for love  
And you've conquered your fear  
And you wanna fall baby  
Fall here  
  
When you've had enough hurt  
And you're tired of the tears  
If you wanna fall baby  
Fall here  
  
You're broken and jaded  
Say love's overrated  
But I say girl ain't that a shame?  
With all that he put you through  
I can't really blame you  
But don't let some fool give us all a bad name  
  
When you're ready for love  
And you've conquered your fear  
If you wanna fall baby  
Fall here  
  
When you've had enough hurt  
And you're tired of the tears  
If you wanna fall baby  
Fall here  
  
Fall here  
Right into my world (right into my world)  
Let me catch you, girl  
Let me be the one  
Let me be the one  
  
When you're ready for love  
When you're ready for love  
If you wanna fall I won't let you down girl  
Oh baby let go  
  
When you're ready for love  
And you've conquered your fear  
And you're tired of the tears  
Baby fall, baby fall here  
Yeah, baby fall here  
Oh, baby fall here
