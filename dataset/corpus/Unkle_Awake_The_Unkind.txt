I think you're standing  
In the wake of my only  
Big mistake  
And all I do is think  
We look inside me  
To find another take  
Well it's make  
Or break  
Got one chance to take  
And you look  
And you find  
And you wake  
The unkind  
Guess the stake  
In my mind  
Is driven by your kind  
I know you're stranded  
For the sake of [you for me]  
You take  
And all you do is sink  
Into the picture  
Of another scandalous creature  
And all you do is sink  
'Cause you look  
And you find  
And you wake  
The unkind  
Guess the stake  
In my mind  
Is driven by your kind  
When you look  
You will find  
That the stake  
Is entwined  
In your fake  
Calloused mind  
Nothing but delight
