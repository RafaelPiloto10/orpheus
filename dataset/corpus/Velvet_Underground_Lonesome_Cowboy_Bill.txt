Lonesome Cowboy Bill  
Rides the rodeo.  
Lonesome Cowboy Bill,  
You got to see him yodel "Ay-hee-ho!"  
  
Lonesome Cowboy Bill  
Rides the rodeo.  
Ever since he was a little lad,  
Loves the rodeo.  
Bucking broncs, yeah, sipping wine,  
You got to see him go,  
And all the ten-gallon girls  
Love to hear him yodel "Ay-hee-ho!"  
  
Because  
Lonesome Cowboy Bill  
Rides the rodeo.  
Lonesome Cowboy Bill,  
You got to see him yodel "Ay-hee-ho!"  
  
Oh, Lonesome Cowboy Bill,  
You still ride the rodeo.  
Up 'round the Colorado shore,  
Down by the Ohio.  
Sometimes even New Orleans,  
Down by the Mardi Gras,  
And all the ten-gallon girls  
Love to hear him yodel "Ay-hee-ho!"  
  
He's Lonesome Cowboy Bill,  
He rides the rodeo.  
Just a Lonesome Cowboy Bill,  
You got to see him yodel "Ay-hee-ho!"  
  
You got to see him in the rodeo  
When he's ridin', goin' too darn fast.  
You got to hear the people  
Scream and shout  
  
They call him,  
Lonesome Cowboy Bill  
He's a  
Lonesome Cowboy Bill  
  
He goes...  
Lonesome Cowboy Bill  
Rides the rodeo.  
Lonesome Cowboy Bill,  
You got to see him yodel "Ay-hee-ho!"  
  
I said,  
You got to see him yodel "Ay-hee-ho!"  
Oh he's a Lonesome Cowboy Bill,  
Lonesome Cowboy Bill
