I wake up in a different daylight  
Guess I haven't been around  
See me follow the shadow haunting your body  
Naked like water - shining like honey  
Move me - You turn me on - The thrill of it all  
You turn me on - The thrill of it all  
You turn me on - The thrill of it all  
  
I read in the paper how everything's changed  
But it's all the same - it's out of the game  
I reach out and touch an endless temptation Live in a dream - the strangest
sensation  
Move me - You turn me on...  
  
The lines I have written are the lines on your face  
They merge out of nowhere - and leave with no trace  
And I've had the feeling we're turnin' to one  
When everything's said - when everything's done  
Move me - You turn me on...  
  
You move me - Oh, baby, turn me on
