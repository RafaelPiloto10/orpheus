I'm sittin' on a mountain  
Searchin' for an answer  
Hopin' there's a chance  
That she'll be comin' back to me  
Midnight dream  
I'm waitin' on the mountain  
Thinkin' I can find her  
Maybe if I find her,  
Here is where she'll want to be  
Midnight dream  
I made my way down to Mexico  
I spend a year travelin' 'cross the ocean  
Without goin' anywhere  
A hundred miles to the nearest phone  
A thousand miles from a place called home  
And all alone in my despair  
I'd call you there  
My midnight dream  
So I'm sittin' on a mountain  
Lookin' 'cross a river  
Needin' to be with her  
More than I believed I'd be  
Midnight dream  
I'm sittin' all alone now  
Knowin' what I know now  
Thought I'd be a teacher  
But she would end up teachin' me  
Midnight dream  
I know that I lost my way one night  
But if you ask me  
It don't seem right  
To spend my life without you there  
And so I climbed to the highest peak  
Just hopin' somehow that I what I seek  
Will somehow speak and you'll appear  
My midnight dream  
Where are you, don't let go  
So I'm sittin' on a mountain  
How can I explain it  
I'm livin' with the pain of thinkin' how it  
Still could be  
Midnight dream  
Love is what I'm thinkin'  
No two ways about it  
Go too long without it,  
Nothing really means a thing  
Midnight dream  
But if you haven't decided yet  
Might be the only chance we get  
Let's don't forget 'bout you and me  
I finally ended where I began  
You see before you  
The sorry soul, the lonely man  
I've come to be  
Please come to me  
My midnight dream  
Oh come to me  
My midnight dream
