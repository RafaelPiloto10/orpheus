Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-ing  
Ring ting tingle-ing too  
Come on, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you  
  
Outside the snow is falling  
And friends are calling "you hoo"  
Come on, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you  
  
Giddy-yap giddy-yap giddy-yap let's go  
Let's look at the snow  
We're riding in a wonderland of snow  
Giddy-yap giddy-yap giddy-yap it's grand  
Just holding your hand  
We're gliding along with the song of a wintry fairy land  
  
Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we  
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be  
Let's take the road before us and sing a chorus or two  
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
  
There's a birthday party at the home of farmer gray  
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day  
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop  
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop  
Pop! Pop! Pop!  
  
There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy  
When they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie  
It'll nearly be like a picture print by currier and ives  
These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives
