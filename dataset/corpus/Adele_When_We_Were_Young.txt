[Verse 1]  
Everybody loves the things you do  
From the way you talk  
To the way you move  
Everybody here is watching you  
Cause you feel like home  
You're like a dream come true  
But if by chance you're here alone  
Can I have a moment  
Before I go?  
Cause I've been by myself all night long  
Hoping you're someone I used to know  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
It looks like a movie  
It sounds like a song  
My God, this reminds me  
Of when we were young  
  
[Chorus]  
Let me photograph you in this light  
In case it is the last time that we might  
Be exactly like we were before we realised  
We were sad of getting old it made us restless  
It was just like a movie  
It was just like a song  
  
[Verse 2]  
I was so scared to face my fears  
Nobody told me that you'd be here  
And I swore you moved overseas  
That's what you said when you left me  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
You still look like a movie  
You still sound like a song  
My God, this reminds me  
Of when we were young  
  
[Chorus]  
Let me photograph you in this light  
In case it is the last time that we might  
Be exactly like we were before we realised  
We were sad of getting old it made us restless  
It was just like a movie  
It was just like a song  
  
[Bridge]  
My God, this reminds me  
Of when we were young  
  
[Verse 3]  
It's hard to admit that  
Everything just takes me back  
To when you were there  
To when you were there  
And a part of me keeps holding on  
Just in case it hasn't gone  
I guess I still care  
Do you still care?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
It was just like a movie  
It was just like a song  
My God, this reminds me  
Of when we were young  
  
[Bridge]  
My God, this reminds me  
Of when we were young  
  
[Chorus]  
Let me photograph you in this light  
In case it is the last time that we might  
Be exactly like we were before we realised  
We were sad of getting old it made us restless  
I'm so mad I'm getting old  
It makes me reckless  
It was just like a movie  
It was just like a song  
When we were young
