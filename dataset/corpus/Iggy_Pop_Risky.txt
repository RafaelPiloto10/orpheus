Born in a corporate dungeon  
Where people are cheated of life  
I knew I could never stay home, No  
  
As you lie in the dark  
With your pink dress on  
You look risky, Lovely, Risky, Lovely  
  
Child of the whispering skies  
  
Risky, That's your name  
Risky, Unashamed  
Risky, Show your style  
Risky, Love's on trial  
  
You make me feel, that this heart is real  
When you hold me, love me, hold me, love me  
  
Girl with the scream in her eyes  
  
Risky, That's your name  
Risky, Unashamed  
Risky, Show your style  
Risky, Love's on trial  
  
People fall apart all the time  
I've been hit enough to know why  
Climb to this point, move on  
Climb to this point, move on  
Career, career, acquire, acquire  
But what is life without a heart  
There's standing room only  
Somebody better tell the truth  
Proceed at your own risk  
  
Risky, That's your name  
Risky, Unashamed  
Risky, Show your style  
Risky, Love's on trial  
  
Why feel so sad  
Let your heart be glad  
Love is risky, lovely, risky, lovely  
  
Child of the whispering skies  
  
Born in a corporate dungeon  
Where people are cheated of life  
I knew I could never stay home  
  
Risky love, Risky love, Risky love, Sweet love  
Risky love, Risky love, Give me love, Sweet love, Risky love, Risky love
