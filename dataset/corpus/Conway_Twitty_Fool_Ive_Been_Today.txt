God forgive me for the fool I've been today  
I just throw that girl you sent to me away  
Lord I'll bet you shook your head at those awful things I said  
When I let my foolish pride get in the way.  
  
And God forgive me for the man I fail to be  
To one who's only sin was loving me  
If I've got a right to pray after treating her this way  
God forgive me for the fool I've been today.  
  
Lord, I thought I'd die when that tear came in her eye  
And that look of disbelief came on her face  
What a shame she had to see the ugly side of me  
Just when my lonely heart had found it's place.  
  
God forgive me for the fool I've been today  
How much love can one man throw away  
I hadn't planned on growing old without that sweet and gentle soul  
God forgive me for the fool I've been today...
