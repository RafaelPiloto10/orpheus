Words and music by Jimmy Rodgers  
Cattle prowl and the coyotes howl  
Out on the Great Divide  
Never done no wrong, just singin' a song  
As down the trail I ride  
Rattle snakes rattle at the prairie dogs  
You can hear that mournful tune  
'Cause it's round-up time, a-way out west  
When the cactus is in bloom  
Yodel...  
CHORUS  
Daylight comes and the cowhands yell  
They call out every man  
Throw my saddle on my old cow horse  
I drink my coffee from a can  
The sun goes down on the cattle trail  
And I'm gazin' at the moon  
'Cause it's round-up time, a-way out west  
When the cactus is in bloom  
Yodel . . .  
Now we don't have cold weather  
It never snows or rains  
This is where the sun shines best  
Out on the western plains  
Some of the boys are gone away  
But they will be back soon  
'Cause it's round-up time, a-way out west  
When the cactus is in bloom  
Yodel...  
CHORUS
