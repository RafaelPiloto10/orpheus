This is our last dance together  
Some will never forget  
You gave me the love of a lifetime  
Not a moment with you I regret  
  
But I'm so afraid of tomorrow  
'Cause I got to face it alone  
I'm losing my reason for living  
I'll be just a man on my own  
  
Oh baby, I'm dancing with tears in my eyes  
I hear the music but after it died  
I know we'll never share it again  
This song we're singing will come to an end  
  
Oh darling, I wish we could dance forever  
And spend my life in your arms  
Deep down I knew we had no future  
What rainy day you would go  
  
I guess I just find you too late girl  
And you can't better hurting, I know  
Nothing and no one can change you  
Until yourself, you're true  
  
But God knows, I always remember  
The light in my life, that was you
