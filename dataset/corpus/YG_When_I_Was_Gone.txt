When I was gone  
I heard you was fuckin' on whoever  
Love you again? I can never  
When I was gone  
You tried to take a advantage of a nigga  
Had me pull a hammer on a nigga (On a nigga)  
Thass' why you don't love these hoes  
Thass' why you don't love these hoes  
Thass' why you don't love these hoes  
Thass' why you don't love these hoes  
  
I was, in jail wit' all niggas  
You was waiting to exhale fucking wit all niggas  
My momma said I should accept yo apology  
But fuck that, that's just reverse psychology  
I dont love you no more, and I think you a ho  
You let a nigga go too long, without no sto  
For all my niggas doing time, I know how it get  
Yo homies disappear, and yo bitch turn into a flip  
  
Once upon a time, I thought I found love but then she played me  
I was gone, came back now my baby, having a baby  
I know you was cheatin', I was outta town eatin'  
But real players we don't get mad, we get even  
But this is why I lost feelings, cause if these hoes ain't fully flippin',  
Then they cartwheeling

Tell a bitch, hurry up its in that green dot  
Left a nigga in the dirt, now she like 7-Eleven giving free slurps  
I bought a celly from my cellmate, she dont even text a nigga no kind of sex-
play  
Fuck that bitch, I'mma have the lil home girls rush that bitch  
  
I say my bail too high, my hopes too low  
My case too slow, violation from my P.O  
I just got out I shoulda just stayed on the couch, 3-way now my ho tryna cuss

And my lawyer say the witness coming to trial,  
On top of that I heard my main bitch fuckin' around  
Im bangin' and shit, my lady prolly sellin' her clit, no money on my books  
A nigga taking L'S wit this bitch!

Shoulda known you wasn't shit from that fake louie purse  
You broke, dumb and goofy
