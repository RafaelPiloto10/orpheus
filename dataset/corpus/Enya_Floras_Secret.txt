Lovers in the long grass  
Look above them  
Only they can see  
Where the clouds are going  
Only to discover  
Dust and sunlight  
Ever make the sky so blue  
  
Afternoon is hazy  
River flowing  
All around the sounds  
Moving closer to them  
Telling them the story  
Told by Flora  
Dreams they never knew  
  
Silver willows  
Tears from Persia  
Those who come  
From a far-off island  
Winter Chanterelle lies  
Under cover  
Glory-of-the-sun in blue  
  
Some they know as passion  
Some as freedom  
Some they know as love  
And the way it leaves them  
Summer snowflake  
For a season  
When the sky above is blue  
When the sky above is blue  
  
Lying in the long grass  
Close beside her  
Giving her the name  
Of the one the moon loves  
This will be the day she  
Will remember  
When she knew his heart  
Was  
Loving in the long grass  
Close beside her  
Whispering of love  
And the way it leaves them  
Lying in the long grass  
In the sunlight  
They believe it's true love  
And from all around them  
Flora's secret  
Telling them of love  
And the way it breathes  
And  
Looking up from eyes of  
Amaranthine  
They can see the sky  
Is blue  
Knowing that their love  
Is true  
Dreams they never knew  
And the sky above is blue
