I walked today where Jesus walked,  
In days of long ago.  
I wandered down each path He knew,  
With reverent step and slow.  
  
Those little lanes, they have not changed,  
A sweet peace fills the air.  
I walked today where Jesus walked,  
And felt His presence there.  
  
My pathway led through Bethlehem,  
Ah memorys ever sweet.  
The little hills of Galilee,  
That knew His childish feet.  
  
The Mount of Olives, hallowed scenes,  
That Jesus knew before  
I saw the mighty Jordan roll,  
As in the days of yore.  
  
I knelt today where Jesus knelt,  
Where all alone he prayed.  
The Garden of Gethsemane,  
My heart felt unafraid.  
  
I picked my heavy burden up,  
And with Him at my side,  
I climbed the Hill of Calvary,  
I climbed the Hill of Calvary,  
I climbed the Hill of Calvary,  
Where on the Cross He died!  
  
I walked today where Jesus walked,  
And felt Him close to me.
