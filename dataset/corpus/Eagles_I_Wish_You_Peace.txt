I wish you peace when the cold winds blow  
Warmed by the fire's glow  
I wish you comfort in the, the lonely time  
And arms to hold you when you ache inside  
  
I wish you hope when things are going bad  
Kind words when times are sad  
I wish you shelter from the, the raging wind  
Cooling waters at the fever's end  
  
I wish you peace when times are hard  
The light to guide you through the dark  
And when storms are high and your, your dreams are low  
  
I wish you the strength to let love grow on  
I wish you the strength to let love flow  
  
I wish you peace when times are hard  
A light to guide you through the dark  
And when storms are high and your, you dreams are low  
I wish you the strength to let let grown on  
I wish you the strength to let love flow on  
I wish you the strength to let love glow on  
I wish you the strength to let love go
