[Verse 1: All]  
It's wonderful  
Everywhere, so white  
  
[Verse 2: Kate Bush, Chorus]  
The river has frozen over  
Not a soul on the ice  
Only me  
Skating fast  
  
[Verse 3: Chorus]  
I'm speeding past trees  
Leaving little lines in the ice  
Cutting out  
Little lines  
In the ice  
  
[Verse 4: Chorus]  
Splitting, splitting sound  
Silver heels  
Spitting, spitting snow  
  
[Verse 5: Kate Bush, Chorus]  
There's something moving under  
Under the ice  
Moving under ice  
Through water  
Trying to ("It's me") get out of the cold water  
("It's me.")  
Something ("It's me!")  
Someone - help them!  
  
[Outro: Kate Bush]  
Oh..!  
No..!
