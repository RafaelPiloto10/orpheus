Girl, don't wait you-up tonight  
Don't leave on the light  
'Cause you'll be sleepin' alone again  
I know my intentions were the best  
I had it all worked out, you see  
But you deserve a whole lot better than me  
  
[Chorus:]  
You need a man  
Whose heart is only one place in the night  
Who'll stay right here and just be satisfied  
You need a man  
Who won't disappoint you every time  
Who'll call and say our plans have changed  
So don't wait up tonight  
  
Stop me now  
I've gone and talked too much again  
You know I do that now and then  
So pay no attention to me  
If I-I say your name  
A thousand times again and again  
Just don't listen to me  
  
[Chorus]
