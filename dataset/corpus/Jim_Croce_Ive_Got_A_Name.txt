Like the pine trees lining the winding road  
I've got a name  
I've got a name  
Like the singing bird and the croaking toad  
I've got a name  
I've got a name  
And I carry it with me like my daddy did  
But I'm living the dream that he kept hid  
Moving me down the highway  
Rolling me down the highway  
Moving ahead so life won't pass me by  
Like the North wind whistling down the sky  
I've got a song  
I've got a song  
Like the whip-poor-will and the baby's cry  
I've got a song  
I've got a song  
And I carry it with me and I sing it loud  
If it gets me nowhere, I'll go there proud  
Moving me down the highway  
Rolling me down the highway  
Moving ahead so life won't pass me by  
And I'm gonna go there free  
Like the fool I am and I'll always be  
I've got a dream  
I've got a dream  
They can change their minds but they can't change me  
I've got a dream  
I've got a dream  
I know I could share it if you want me to  
If your going my way I'll go with you  
Moving me down the highway  
Rolling me down the highway  
Moving ahead so life won't pass me by  
Moving me down the highway  
Rolling me down the highway  
Moving ahead so life won't pass me by
