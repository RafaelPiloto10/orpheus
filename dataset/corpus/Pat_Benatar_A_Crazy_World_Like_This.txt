Baby I forgot somethin', that's why I came home  
It's somethin' I really need, I know you thought I was gone  
No, it's not my gloves honey, it's not that cold today  
It's nothin' I left behind, it's somethin' I got to say  
I forgot to say I love you  
And something else that I missed, to say how much I need you  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
In a Crazy, Crazy World Like This  
It's easy to feel all alone  
You give me the strength I need to exist  
Just hold me and don't let me go  
In a Crazy, Crazy World Like This  
  
Sometimes I don't know lately, what will ease the pain?  
On every corner of the street, sometimes it's all too insane  
Baby you just got somethin', that's why I came home  
It's somethin' I really need, an' now we can be alone  
  
I just had to say I love you, and something else that I missed  
To say how much I need you  
  
(Chorus)  
  
It's easy to fear the unknown  
I always know when fate gives a twist  
You'll be there to soften the blow  
  
In a Crazy, Crazy World Like This - Ooh, Ooh  
You give me the strength I need to exist  
Just hold me and don't let me go  
  
In a Crazy, Crazy World Like This  
It's easy to feel all alone  
I always know when fate gives a twist  
You'll be there to soften the blow  
  
In a Crazy, Crazy World Like This - Ooh, Ooh  
You give me the strength I need to exist  
Just hold me and don't let me go  
  
In a Crazy, Crazy World Like This  
When all my defenses are low  
I always know when fate gives a twist  
You'll be there to soften the blow  
In a Crazy, Crazy World Like This.....
