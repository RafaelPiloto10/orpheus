Once my lover, now my friend.  
What a cruel thing to pretend.  
What a cunning way to condescend.  
Once my lover, and now my friend.  
  
Oh, you creep up like the clouds.  
And you set my soul at ease.  
Then you let your love abound,  
And you bring me to my knees.  
  
Oh, it's evil, babe, the way you let your grace enrapture me.  
When well you know, I'd be insane  
To ever let that dirty game recapture me.  
You made me a Shadowboxer, baby.  
  
I want to be ready for what you do.  
I've been swinging all around me  
"'Cause I don't know when you're gonna make your move.  
Oh, your gaze is dangerous.  
  
And you fill your space so sweet.  
If I let you get to close,  
You'll set your spell on me.  
So darlin', I just want to say  
  
Just in case I don't come through,  
I was on to every play  
I just wanted you.  
Oh, it's so evil, my love.  
  
The way you've no reverence to my concern.  
So I'll be sure to stay wary of you, love.  
To save the pain  
Of once my flame, and twice my burn.
