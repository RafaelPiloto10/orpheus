Can you feel it when  
your throat dries?  
Can you see it in the night sky?  
Just a mumble round at tea time  
Smile  
When I'm watching you  
When I was a child  
We were living in fear  
Living in fear  
When I was a child  
Just a light year from here  
Living in fear  
Worlds may shatter  
Years don't matter  
Words came back to haunt you  
Worlds may shatter  
Years don't matter  
Words came back to haunt you  
Friends past missing  
Reminiscing  
Words came back to haunt you  
Tolerating propaganda  
And your girlfriend, Alexandra  
With her secret memorandum  
Signs  
For an interview  
Searching for the light  
In the world of the blahs  
Masquerading as stars  
How can this be right?  
You've been going too far  
Leaving conscience ajar  
Worlds may shatter  
Years don't matter  
Words came back to haunt you  
Friends past missing  
Reminiscing  
Words came back to haunt you  
When I was a child  
We were living in fear  
Living in fear  
Worlds may shatter  
Years don't matter  
Words came back to haunt you  
Worlds may shatter  
Years don't matter  
Words came back to haunt you  
Friends past missing  
Reminiscing  
Words came back to haunt you  
Worlds may shatter  
Years don't matter  
Words came back to haunt you  
Friends past missing  
Reminiscing  
Words came back to haunt you
