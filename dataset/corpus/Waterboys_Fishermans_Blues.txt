I wish I was a fisherman  
Tumblin' on the seas  
Far away from dry land  
And it's bitter memories  
  
Castin' out my sweet line  
With abandonment and love  
No ceiling bearin' down on me  
Except the starry sky above  
  
With light in my head  
With you in my arms...  
I wish I was the brakeman  
On a hurtlin fevered train  
  
Crashin head long into the heartland  
Like a cannon in the rain  
With the feelin of the sleepers  
And the burnin of the coal  
  
Countin the towns flashin by  
And a night that's full of soul  
With light in my head  
With you in my arms...  
  
And I know I will be loosened  
From the bonds that hold me fast  
And the chains all around me  
Will fall away at last  
  
And on that grand and fateful day  
I will take thee in my hand  
I will ride on a train  
I will be the fisherman  
  
With light in my head  
You in my arms...  
Light in my head  
You in my arms...  
  
Light in my head  
You...  
With light in my head  
You in my arms...
