Look at my face. I know the years are showin'.  
Look at my life. Still don't know where it's goin'.  
I don't know much, but I know I love you,  
And that may be all I need to know.  
  
Look at these eyes. Oh, they never see what matters.  
And look at these dreams, so beaten and so battered.  
I don't know much, but I know I love you,  
And that may be all I need to know.  
  
So many questions and still no answers.  
I climb and climb but never get the view.  
But when I hold you near me sometimes I feel so clearly  
The only truth I'll ever know is me and you.  
  
In my heart I long for inspiration.  
And in my soul I know someday I'll find salvation.  
I don't know much, but I know I love you,  
And that may be all I need to know.  
  
In my heart you're my inspiration.  
And in my soul I know love is our salvation.  
I don't kow much, but if I know you love me,  
That will be all I need to know.  
I don't know much, but if you say you love me,  
That will be all I need to know.
