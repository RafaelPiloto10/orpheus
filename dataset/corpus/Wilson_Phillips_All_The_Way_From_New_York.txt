I'm gonna ask you for something, and it may sound like a lot.  
I've never really asked you for anything, no.  
We've always lived so far apart  
  
[Chorus]  
Would you fly all the way from New York to see me?  
Could you fly all the way to stand here next to me?  
I didn't think so  
But here you are with me.  
  
I was hanging on to nothing as a child.  
And my brother, he used to slam into walls  
Everyone called him wild  
Yes it's been a while since I've had a day,  
Where I don't wish away all the fear, all the fear  
That's why it's so hard to ask  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Thank you for coming.  
You'll never know what it means (ah..ah)  
'Cause no one ever cared enough about you  
How were you supposed to know what I need  
You'll never know what it means  
But thank you for coming.  
  
[Chorus]
