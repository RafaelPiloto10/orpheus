  
She's walking round in emptiness  
She's missing out  
All the goods she left in her prom dress  
She can't take back all her regrets  
Her only hope is what she did  
She'll soon forget  
  
The sky's a blur  
My drug, my friend  
Sometimes you can't avoid the lonesome bitter end  
She's breathing in some nicotine  
And when she's down,  
She'll drown this town in kerosene  
  
This must be the end of the line  
This must be the end of the line  
This must be the end of the line  
  
The ganja boys  
They like it there  
Maybe the truth is just  
Enough for you too bear  
You can't avoid a compromise  
Maybe this is a state of reflection  
Of what's on your mind  
  
This must be the end of the line  
This must be the end of the line  
  
Even all this time we're still making it fine  
Even all this time we're still making it fine  
Even all this time we're still making it fine  
  
This must be the end of the line  
This must be the end of the line  
This must be the end of the line  
  
You can't avoid a compromise  
This must be the end of the line  
You can't avoid what's on your mind  
This must be the end of the line  
You can't avoid a compromise  
This must be the end of the line  
This must be the end of the line  
  
She's walking round in emptiness  
She's looking for the goods  
She left in her prom dress
