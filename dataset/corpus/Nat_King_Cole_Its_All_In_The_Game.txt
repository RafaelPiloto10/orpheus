Many a tear has to fall but it's all in the game  
All in the wonderful game that we know as love  
You had words with him and your future's looking dim  
But these things your heart can't rise above.  
  
Once in a while we won't call but it's all in the game  
Soon he'll be there at your side with a sweet bouquet  
And he'll kiss your lips and caress your waiting fingertips  
And your heart will fly away.  
  
And he'll kiss your lips and caress your waiting fingertips  
And your heart will fly away
