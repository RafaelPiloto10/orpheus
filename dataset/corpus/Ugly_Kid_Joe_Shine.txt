Just a grain of sand on a thousand beaches  
Just like dust in the wind  
Try to understand why I go to pieces  
Don't know where to begin  
  
Got a smokin' hand, nobody knows plan  
But I can feel it, it's gonna overload  
It's a greed machine, it means everything  
I'm gonna have to get it out of my head  
  
Got a screaming hand, shadows are all my friends  
Cause they conceal me when I overload  
It's a greed machine, it means everything to me  
I can't conceal it when it overloads  
  
I still shine  
Got a smokin' hand, no one can understand  
But I can feel it's gonna overload  
It's a greed machine, it means everything to me  
I can't conceal it when it overloads
