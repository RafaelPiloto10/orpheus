Well, I just want to clear the air,  
I already know, and darlin' I still care,  
But we're crippled every time I close my eyes.  
I know it's hard when you're all alone,  
And you always come back home  
Looks like we're hurtin from your lovin' on the side  
  
I think I've prob'ly seen her, believe I know her name,  
Darlin' does it make you satisfied?  
She's the one who's feeling happy, I'm the one who wants to die  
I think you've gone just a little too far this time.  
  
So I just want to clear the air  
I already know, and darlin' I still care,  
But we're hurtin' from your lovin' on the side  
  
I'm not saying that I approve, or that I can stand it,  
But I know I've got to give us one more try.  
I keep prayin' you still love me, but soon my prayer will die,  
If every time we talk, you hide your eyes.  
  
So I just want to clear the air  
I already know, and darlin' I still care  
But we're crippled every time you close your eyes  
I know it's hare when you're all alone,  
And if you really want to come back home,  
Stop this hurtin', stop your lovin' on the side  
Stop this hurtin', stop your lovin' on the side.
