And when I work hard all day long  
I tell you what, it don't bother me nohow,  
'Cause how could anything ever go wrong  
When I got my baby, Lord, yes,  
When I got my baby, oh Lord!  
  
And when they tell me love is pain  
I said it might be true for you, honey,  
But not for Janis no more, no no no no.  
All I've ever got to do is call my daddy's name  
Yeah and I got m-my baby, Lord, yeah,  
Yes I got my baby, good good God,  
Honey, I wanna tell you something that I do.  
  
Deep down, h-honey, in the dark of the night,  
When I lay my head down, I wanna go to sleep,  
And I know everything is gonna be alright,  
Yeah I got my baby, Lord yeah,  
'Cause I got m-my baby, oh yeah.  
  
And when I wanna call the names  
Or the things to be that wanna be to you.  
And when I wanna reach out my hand  
It always seems you hold me, dear,  
Love, don't you know how long I looked for you  
Daddy, daddy, daddy.  
Love, don't you know how hard I tried,  
But now I got my baby, Lord, yeah,  
Now I got my baby, yeah.
