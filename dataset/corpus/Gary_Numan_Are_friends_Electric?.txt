It's cold outside  
And the paint's peeling off of my walls  
There's a man outside  
In a long coat, grey hat, smoking a cigarette  
  
Now the light fades out  
And I'm wondering what I'm doing in a room like this  
There's a knock on the door  
And just for a second I thought I remembered you  
  
So now I'm alone  
Now I can think for myself  
About little deals  
And issues  
And things that I just don't understand  
A white lie that night  
Or a sly touch at times  
I don't think it meant anything to you  
  
So I open the door  
It's the 'friend' that I'd left in the hallway  
Please sit down  
A candlelit shadow on a wall near the bed  
  
You know I hate to ask  
But, are 'friends' electric?  
Only mine's broke down  
And now I've no one to love  
  
So I find out your reasons  
For the phone calls and smiles  
And it hurts  
And I'm lonely  
And I should never have tried  
And I missed you tonight  
It must be time to leave  
You see it meant everything to me
