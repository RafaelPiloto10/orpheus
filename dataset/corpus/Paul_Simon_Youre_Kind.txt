You're kind, you're so kind  
You rescued me when I was blind  
And you put me on your pillow  
When I was on the wall  
You're kind, so kind, so kind  
And you're good, you're so good  
You introduced me to your neighborhood  
Seem like I ain't never had so many friends before  
That's because you're good, you're so good  
Why you don't treat me like the other humans do  
Is just a mystery to me  
It gets me agitated when I think that  
You're gonna love me now indefinitely  
So goodbye, goodbye  
I'm gonna leave you now  
And here's the reason why  
I like to sleep with the window open  
And you keep the window closed  
So goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
