Delilah, Delilah, oh my, oh my, oh my - you're irresistible - ooh ooh ooh  
You make me smile when I'm just about to cry  
You bring me hope, you make me laugh - and I like it  
You get away with murder, so innocent  
But when you throw a moody you're all claws and you bite  
That's alright!  
Delilah, Delilah, oh my, oh my, oh my - you're unpredictable - ooh ooh ooh ooh  
You make me so very happy  
When you cuddle up and go to sleep beside me  
And then you make me slightly mad  
When you pee all over my Chippendale suite  
Ooh ooh Delilah  
Ooh ooh Delilah  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
You take over my house and home  
You even try to answer my telephone  
Delilah, you're the apple of my eyes  
Meow, meow, meow,  
Delilah - I love you, Delilah oh  
Ooh you make me so very happy - you give me kisses  
And I go out of my mind - ooh ooh  
Meow, meow, meow, meow,  
You're irresistible - I love you Delilah  
Delilah - I love you, ha ha  
You make me very happy - oooh oh yeah  
I love your kisses  
I love your kisses  
I love your kisses  
I love your kisses  
I love your your your kisses  
I love your kisses
