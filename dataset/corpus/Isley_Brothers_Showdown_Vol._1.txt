who's to blame  
what's his name?  
where's he from?  
Is that my range he's drivin'  
Tell me what's he got that i ain't got a lot of  
Besides who is he to lay in the covers of my home  
Oooooh, my home  
Now lets not forget her misses  
she's nothing like my mother  
God rest her soul oooooooh  
Took her of these streets gave her everything  
I was the one that believed in all of her dreams and she did me wrong  
So prepare yourself  
  
[chorus]  
Its about to be a showdown  
Its goin' down  
Somebody's been foolin' around in my home,wearin' my clothes, drivin' my car  
God help me  
Its a showdown  
Its goin' down  
Somebody's been foolin' around in my home,wearin my clothes, drivin' my car  
Its on  
Now first things first  
where's this cat from
