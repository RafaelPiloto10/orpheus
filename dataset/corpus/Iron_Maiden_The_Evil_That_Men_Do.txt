Love is a razor and I walked the line on that silver blade  
Slept in the dust with his daughter,  
Her eyes red with the slaughter of innocence  
And I will pray for her, I will call her name out loud  
And I will bleed for her, if I could only see her now  
Living on a razor's edge, balancing on a ledge  
Living on a razor's edge, balancing on a ledge  
Balancing on a ledge, living on a razor's edge  
Balancing on a ledge, you know, you know  
  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
  
Circle of fire my baptism of joy at an end it seems  
The seventh lamb slain, the book of life opens before me  
And I will pray for you, someday I may return  
Don't you cry for me, beyond is where I learn  
  
Living on a razor's edge, balancing on a ledge  
Living on a razor's edge, you know, you know  
  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
  
Living on a razor's edge, balancing on a ledge  
Living on a razor's edge, you know, you know  
  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil, the evil, the evil that men do  
The evil, the evil, the evil that men do
