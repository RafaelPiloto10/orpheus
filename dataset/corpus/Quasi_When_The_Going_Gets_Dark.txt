When you told me if you can't beat 'em, join 'em  
I was thinking death before dishonor  
As you lord over your front porch  
Getting drunk with your neighbor  
Well I might wander all day  
Across the Milky Way  
But I'll be Joan of Arc when the going gets dark  
  
Why buy a trip across the ocean  
When you could already be the sea?  
  
And they'll tell you sign up with the winning team  
Or get out of the way, get with the program  
Welcome to the real world!  
Is that what is real  
Or is it just that the standard deal?  
You can have all of that  
That ain't where it's at  
  
Why buy a trip across the ocean  
When you could already be the sea?
