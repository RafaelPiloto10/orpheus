Twelve noon  
Watch her sleeping in your room  
Why can't that still be me  
Two o'clock and I'm still driving round your block  
Feeling a little  
Crazy  
  
You'd change your number and move to the suburbs  
You run but you can't hide  
You thought I'd forget all of your passwords  
But I like showing up at your place  
So surprising is that look on your face  
  
I am underneath your street light  
Blowing kissing every night  
Psycho love forever  
I'm right outside your window  
Throwing rocks and starting fights  
Psycho love forever  
  
So weeks pass and I found myself another guy  
Someone who loves me equally, yeah  
The tables turn and you're not happy  
When you learn he's moving in with me  
He bought me a big ring we moved to the city  
Now you won't stop calling  
'Cause you always thought that you'd have your plan B  
Now your showing  
Up at my place  
Not surprising  
We both play this game  
  
You're underneath my street light  
Blowing kisses every night  
  
Psycho love forever  
You're right outside my window  
Throwing rocks and starting fights  
Psycho love forever  
  
La la la la  
La la la la  
Forever  
La la la la  
La la la la  
  
You'd change your number and move to the suburbs  
You run but you can't hide  
You thought I'd forget all of your passwords  
But I like showing up at your place  
So surprising that look on your face  
  
I am underneath your street light  
Blowing kissing every night  
Psycho love forever  
I'm right outside your window  
Throwing rocks and starting fights  
Psycho love forever  
  
I am underneath your street light  
Blowing kissing every night  
Psycho love forever  
I'm right outside your window  
Throwing rocks and starting fights  
Psycho love
