The journey begins with curiosity  
And evolves into soul-felt questions  
On the stones that we walk  
And choose to make our path  
Sometimes never knowing  
Other times knowing too much  
  
Filtering out the bad that holds us back  
Take hold of what is true to your hunger  
A hunger that will not go away  
Plans for tomorrow, they will remain  
  
Won't you join me on the perennial quest  
Reaching into the dark, retrieving light  
Search for answers on the perennial quest  
Where dreams are followed, and time is a test  
  
No time for mental crutches  
The maker has moved on  
I will take it raw and be on my way  
  
Those that stood beside me  
I'm glad you understand  
Behind these written words  
I share the simple plan  
To hang on to the way that we feel  
  
From rivers of sorrow  
To oceans deep with hope  
I have travelled them  
Now, there is no turning back  
The limit, the sky  
I ask my questions Why? What today?  
When tomorrow?  
  
Filtering out the bad that holds us back  
Take hold of what is true to your hunger  
A hunger that will not go away  
Plans for tomorrow, they will remain  
Won't you join me on the perennial quest  
Reaching into the dark, retrieving light  
Search for answers on the perennial quest  
Where dreams are followed, and time is a test
