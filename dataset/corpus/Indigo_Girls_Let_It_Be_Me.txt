Sticks and stones  
Battle zones  
A single light bulb  
On a single thread for the black  
Sirens wail  
History fails  
Rose-colored glass  
Begins to age and crack  
While the politicians shadowbox  
The power ring  
In an endless split decision  
Never solve anything  
From a neighbor's distant land  
I heard the strain of the common man  
  
[Chorus]  
Let it be me  
(this is not a fighting song)  
Let it be me  
(not a wrong for a wrong)  
Let it be me  
If the world is night  
Shine my life like a light  
  
Well the world seems spent  
And the president  
Has no good idea  
Of who the masses are  
Well I'm one of them  
And I'm among friends  
We're trying to see beyond  
The fences in our own backyards  
I've seen the kingdoms blow  
Like ashes in the winds of change  
But the power of truth  
Is the fuel for the flame  
So the darker the ages get  
There's a stronger beacon yet  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In the kind word you speak  
In the turn of the cheek  
When your vision stays clear  
In the face of your fear  
Then you see turning out a light switch  
Is their only power  
When we stand like spotlights  
In a mighty tower  
All for one and one for all  
Then we sing the common call  
  
[Chorus]
