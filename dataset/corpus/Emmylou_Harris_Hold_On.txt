What happened to your mother's love  
What happened to your daddy's pride  
Although you always said enough  
Though they were right by your side  
What happened to that ball of fire  
It got out on that empty road  
  
Nothing but our own desires  
Lighten up this heavy load  
Hold on, hold on, hold on  
  
I know you didn't plan for this  
But that's the way it always starts  
He's looking for a little kiss  
Instead you bought a broken heart  
Now you had to build a bridge  
Only you can walk across  
Wear the tooth until it fits  
Pay the price and bear the loss  
  
Hold on, hold on, hold on  
  
Once you were a little kid  
Working on a great big plan  
They threw away the simple joys  
And now you have to take a stand  
  
Battles rage in your head  
You wish you didn't have to fight  
Just hold on to my hand instead  
Another day goes by tonight  
  
What happened to your mother's love  
What happened to your daddy's pride  
Way down deep in your inside your blood  
Help you through this lonely ride  
  
Hold on, hold on, hold on  
Hold on, hold on, hold on  
Hold on, hold on, hold on  
Hold on
