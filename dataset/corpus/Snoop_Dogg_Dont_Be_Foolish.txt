[snoop dogg]  
Yo dogg, niggas always asking me  
"is the muthafuckin dpgc still together? "  
Niggas gon ask me  
"dogg y'all still together, I heard y'all broke up like the fat boys."  
Nigga what, nigga this dogg pound for life nigga  
We ain't going nowhere nigga  
In matter of fact, you actin foolish right now with all that shit you kick  
Nigga everywhere I go niggas be actin foolish  
And uh, I'm a deal with that shit dpg style  
[kurupt]  
I'm a rider, the first local stock pilot  
Now what the fuck made you think the dp divided  
Moving on up to the top of the map  
Because gangsta will be here till the curl comeback  
I'm moving down to block d, me and my homies  
The dogg pound would rock overseas, immense degrees  
No bitch niggas in the circle  
Beat a nigga in his face till his fuckin eyes turn purple  
[daz dillinger]  
I told myself watch out for my family and health  
I got my shit together, got the gauge up shelf  
Knowing the rules have chose to hang out with the dummies and fools  
Old school poda dada that I knew from way back to school  
Attitude shitty, kept it raw and gritty  
Uncut, me and my dawgs fuckin it up  
What up  
[snoop dogg]  
Fuckin it up, fuckin it up for life nigga, dogg pound, ya heard  
If I hear another nigga talking about what he gon do, to who  
To me and my crew, nigga the grey and the blue  
You through, you knew you shouldn't have done that  
Now how the fuck you figure that we wasn't gon comeback  
The d, the p, the g to see  
Westcoast's finest and I'm a put that on me  
See niggas been rappin but they ain't sayin shit  
Nigga shut the fuck up, get off my dick  
Chorus  
Don't be foolish x2  
[daz]  
Hook  
You see you don't wanna fuck with us  
Knowing how we throw it out, the sucka niggas want to imitate us  
Cause all we wanna do is put the g right back in you  
Yeah worry about your muthafuckin punk ass crew  
And we keeps it gangsta fool, that's gangsta, keep it gangsta fool  
[snoop dogg]  
Trip, we got more dough than rock up, more niggas to lock up  
You niggas need to strap up or pack up  
See because this world we live in is crazy, and the people they so sick  
See why I keeps it gangsta and I ride with the sickest clique  
And when it comes to gun play, hell yeah we the quickest biach  
[daz dillinger]  
And oh my momma and my daddy, grandpapa and my granny  
Homeboy you can't fuck with this  
[kurupt]  
Smooth when we come through  
The dp when we come through the gangstas is in the house  
And all you muthafuckin niggas and you muthafuckin bitches  
Get a muthafuckin dick in your mouth  
I'm a gangsta I thought you knew, g'd up, grey and blue  
Dippin through on the coop, made you blue  
Kurupt and snoop, daz in the muthafuckin bomb ass clique  
We gangstas nigga, laid back thinkin I tell you how it is in the hood  
Where all my homies at, straps in cadillacs  
Hittin switches like e'yday, livin like the g way like e'yday, dpg-see

Chorus x4  
Just bullshittin man this dude done told me the dogg pound broke up  
Wait till I catch that nigga, I'm a beat him down  
Wait till I, wait till I catch em
