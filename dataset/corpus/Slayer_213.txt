Driving compulsion morbid thoughts come to mind  
Sexual release buried deep inside  
Complete control of a prized possession  
To touch and fondle with no objection  
Lonely souls an emptiness fulfilled  
Physical pleasures an addictive thrill  
An object of perverted reality  
An obsession beyond your wildest dreams  
  
The Death loves final embrace  
Your cool tenderness  
Memories keep love alive  
Memories will never die  
  
The excitement of dissection is sweet  
My skin crawls with orgasmic speed  
A lifeless object for my subjection  
An obsession beyond your imagination  
Primitive instinct a passion for flesh  
Primal feeding on the multitudes of death  
Sadistic acts a love so true  
Absorbingly masticating a part of you  
  
Death loves final embrace  
Your cool tenderness  
Memories keep love alive  
Memories will never die  
  
I need a friend  
Please be my companion  
I don't want to be  
Alone with my sanity  
  
Erotic sensations tingle my spine  
A dead body lying next to mine  
Smooth blue black lips  
I start salivating as we kiss  
Mine forever this sweet death  
I cannot forget all your breaths  
Panting excitedly with my hands around  
Your neck  
  
Shades are drawn  
No one out can see  
What I've done  
What's become of me  
Here I stand  
Above all that's been true  
How I love  
How I love to kill you
