Some folks built like this  
Some folks built like that  
Way you move you ain't talkin' back  
I'm built for comfort, ain't built for speed  
Got everything all you good girls need  
Don't need no diamond, don't need no gold  
Got a lot of love and got a whole lot of soul  
I'm built for comfort, ain't built for speed  
But I got everything all you good girls need  
I don't need no diamond, don't need no gold  
Got a lot of love and got a whole lot of soul  
I'm built for comfort, I ain't built for speed  
But I got everything all you good girls need
