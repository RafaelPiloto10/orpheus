Oh baby, I've got all this love, it's more than enough  
Oh baby, I'm filled with desire, I'm caught in your fire  
Oh baby, you've got the power to turn me on  
  
You knew it, you looked in my eyes, you read in my mind  
You move me, spinning me 'round, around and around  
Oh you have the power to rule my mind and soul  
  
Take me, I'll be your woman  
Use me, make me your own  
Take me, make me your woman  
Love me now, and don't leave me alone  
  
Oh baby, there's something inside, that's I just can't hide  
Oh baby, well I want you so, just take me real slow  
Oh baby, you've got the power to turn me on  
  
I want you, I know what I want, I want what I see  
I need you, I need you right now, and you know just how  
Well I need you to cool the fire that's burning so  
  
Take me, I'll be your woman  
Use me, make me your own  
Take me, make me your woman  
Love me now, and don't leave me alone  
  
Baby, baby, baby, oh baby,  
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby  
Take me, I'll be your woman  
Use me, make me your own  
  
Take me, make me your woman  
Love me now, and don't leave me alone  
Love me now, and don't leave me alone  
Love me now, and don't leave me alone
