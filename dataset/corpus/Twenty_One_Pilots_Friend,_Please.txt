I feel for you but when did you  
Believe you were alone?  
You say that spiders crawled inside  
And made themselves a home  
Where light once was.  
  
Petrified of who you are and  
Who you have become.  
You will hide from everyone,  
Denying you need someone  
To exterminate your bones.  
  
[Chorus]  
Friend, please remove your hands from  
Over your eyes for me.  
I know you want to leave but  
Friend, please don't take your life away from me.  
[End Chorus]  
  
Living like a ghost you walk  
By everyone you know.  
You say that you're fine but  
You have lost your sway a glow.  
So I stopped by to let you know.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Would you let me know your plans tonight?  
'Cause I just won't let go till we both see the light.  
And I have nothing else left to say.  
But I will listen to you all day.  
Yes I will.  
  
Friend, please remove your hands from  
Over your eyes for me.  
I know you want to leave but  
Friend, please don't take your life away from me.
