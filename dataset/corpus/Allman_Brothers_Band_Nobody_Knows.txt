Nobody knows about what's going on,  
With the world and the steel,  
The flesh and the bone.  
River keeps flowing and the grass still grows,  
And the spirit keeps going, nobody knows.  
Poets they come and the poets they go,  
Politicians and preachers they all claim to know.  
The words that are written and the melody's played,  
As the years turn their pages, they all start to fade.  
The oceans still move with the moon and the sky,  
The grass still grows on the hillside.  
Got to believe in believing,  
Got to believe in a dream,  
Freedom is ever deceiving,  
Never turning out to be what it seems.  
It's amazing how fast our lives go by,  
Like the flash of the lightning or the blink of an eye.  
We all fall in love, and we fall into life,  
We look for the truth on the edge of a knife.  
Heavens turn around the river still flows,  
Spirit keeps going, nobody knows.  
Words that are written and melody's played,  
As the years turn their pages, it all start to fade.  
Oceans still move with the moon and the sky,  
The grass still grows on the hillside.  
Got to believe in believing,  
Got to believe in a dream,  
Freedom is ever deceiving,  
Never turning out to be what it seems.
