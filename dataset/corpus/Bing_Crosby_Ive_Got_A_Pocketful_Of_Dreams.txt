Happiness comes with success  
And that I guess is true  
But success is more or less  
A point of view  
  
I'm no millionaire  
But I'm not the type to care  
Cause I've got a pocketful of dreams  
It's my universe  
Even with an empty purse  
Cause I've got a pocketful of dreams  
  
I wouldn't take the wealth of Wall Street  
For a road where nature trods  
And I calculate that I'm worth my weight  
In goldenrods  
  
Lucky, lucky me  
I can live in luxury  
Cause I've got a pocketful of dreams
