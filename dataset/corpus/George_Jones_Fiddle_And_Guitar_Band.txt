Hey, I've got a guitar, I've got a fiddle  
I'll sing the low part, I'll sing the middle  
Rosin up the bow and let's pick a little  
Got a fiddle and guitar band.  
  
I like old songs, I like the new  
I like the glad songs, I like the blues  
Well, we'll play them and another note too  
With the fiddle and guitar band.  
  
Standing on the sidewalk singin' up a storm  
You ain't seen ? till the day you were born ?  
Pickin' and a-grinnin' and a-carryin' on  
We're goin' to put you on a show.  
  
He plays a music with a cajun beat  
We play it hot and you played it sweet  
First thing you know you'll be tappin' your feet  
To a little bit of do se do oh oh.  
  
If you really want to make it shine  
Throw up a dollar or a quarter or a dime  
Everybody's gonna have a real good time  
With the fiddle and guitar band.
