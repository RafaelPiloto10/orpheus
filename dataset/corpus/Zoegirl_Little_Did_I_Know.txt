I had an angel that sat on my shoulder,  
Seems like everybody's got one,  
I had the devil waiting on standby,  
For when I wanted to have some fun  
Thought that I was living forever,  
I thought that my smile would get me in,  
Never felt the wind that was coming,  
Never thought the party would end  
No, no, no, no...  
[Chorus]  
Little did I know  
That you were all I needed  
Little did I see  
Until you opened up my eyes  
Little did I know  
That one prayer could reach you  
Little did I know  
That you even cared  
I had my daddy wrapped 'round my finger  
I never made my momma cry  
Nothin but smiles on the outside  
But all the while living a lie  
If you ask me am I going to heaven,  
I said you know I've been a good good girl  
I'm gonna spend all my money on makeup  
And a find a boy who will buy me the world  
[chorus]  
little did I know  
That you loved me before I even met you  
I didn't see beyond myself  
But I couldn't fight forever  
Because you are so easy to trust  
And now we play together  
My life has just begun  
[chorus x2]
