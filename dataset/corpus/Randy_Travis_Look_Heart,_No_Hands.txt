I remember how it used to feel  
Riding down old two mile hill  
Tennis shoes up on the handle bars  
Paying no mind to the passing cars  
No doubts, no fears, just like when you are here  
  
[Chorus]  
No chains, no strings, no fences, no wall  
No net, just you to catch me when I fall  
Look heart, no hands.  
  
It took a little time to get up to speed  
To find the confidence and strength I need  
To just let go and reach for the sky  
You Know sometimes it felt I could fly.  
No doubts, no fears, just like when you are here.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It doesn't take much, just a smile or a touch  
And I'm a kid again, I can almost feel that wind  
  
On one hand I count the reasons I could stay with you  
And hold you close to me, all night long.  
So many lover's games I could play with you  
And on that hand I see no reason why it's wrong  
  
[Chorus]  
  
But on the other hand, there's a golden band  
To remind of someone who would not understand  
On one hand I could stay and be your loving man  
But the reason I must go is on the other hand  
  
In your arms I feel the passion, I thought had died  
When I looked into your eyes I found myself  
When I first kissed your lips I felt so alive  
I've got to hand it to you girl, you're something else  
  
[Chorus]
