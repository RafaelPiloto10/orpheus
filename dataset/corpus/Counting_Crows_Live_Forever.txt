(Original by Oasis)  
Sung as an intro to A Long December  
  
Maybe I don't really want to know  
How your garden grows  
'cause I just want to fly  
Lately did you ever feel the pain  
In the morning rain  
As it soaks you to the bone  
Maybe I just want to fly  
I want to live I don't want to die  
Maybe I just want to breathe  
Maybe I just don't believe  
Maybe you're the same as me  
We see things they'll never see  
You and I are gonna live forever  
I said  
Maybe I don't really want to know  
How your garden grows  
'cause I just want to fly  
Lately did you ever feel the pain  
In the morning rain  
As it soaks you to the bone  
Maybe I will never be  
All the things that I want to be  
Now is not the time to cry  
Now's the time to find out why  
I think you're the same as me  
We see things they'll never see  
You and I are gonna live forever  
Maybe I don't really want to know  
How your garden grows  
'cause I just want to fly  
Lately did you ever feel the pain  
In the morning rain  
As it soaks you to the bone  
Maybe I just want to fly  
I want to live I don't want to die  
Maybe I just want to breathe  
Maybe I just don't believe  
Maybe you're the same as me  
We see things they'll never see  
You and I are gonna live forever  
Gonna live forever  
Gonna live forever  
Gonna live forever  
Gonna live forever  
Gonna live forever  
Gonna live forever
