Black cat, don't you look back at me  
Good luck, don't hang around me  
I been down so long I can't see  
Need something that's gonna set me free  
  
[Chorus]  
I need some good love  
I need some good, good love  
  
New love, just passes me by  
So bad, I don't even try  
Shot down and I ask myself why  
Needin' someone who's gonna save my hide  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Black cat, don't you look back at me  
New love, don't wander 'round me  
Well I try but I just ain't no use  
I need someone who's gonna turn me loose  
  
[Chorus]
