I know what makes me comfortable  
And I know what makes me tick  
And I when I need to get my way  
I know how to pour it on thick  
  
Cream and sugar in my coffee  
Right away when I wake  
I face a day, and pray to God  
I won't make the same mistakes  
  
[Chorus]  
All the rest is out of my hands  
I will learn to let go what I cannot change  
I will learn to forgive what I cannot change  
I will learn to love what I cannot change  
But I will change, yeah I will change  
Whatever I, whatever I can  
  
Yeah I don't know my father  
Or my mother well enough  
It seems like every time we talk  
We can't get passed the little stuff  
The pain is self-inflicted  
I know it's not good for me health  
Yeah but it's easier to please the world  
Then it is to please myself  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I know I can't care about how everyone else really feels  
I have enough hurt of my own to heal  
  
I will learn to let go what I cannot change  
I will learn to forgive what I cannot change  
I will learn to let go what I cannot change  
I will learn to forgive what I cannot change  
I will learn to love what I cannot change  
But I will change, yeah I will change  
Whatever I, whatever I can
