Recently I've been  
All of content and dreaming I have been  
Cause I've been lately seeing  
Quite a bit of this woman live on my street  
  
People stare and we just ignore everything  
People stare and we just ignore them  
And they go away, go away  
  
She comes to me  
I watch her drink  
I watch her comb her hair  
Both say that we never before have  
Felt as recently  
  
People stare and we just ignore  
What's the use in hiding out  
She says all the time  
Let their eyes do the worrying about  
  
She and me go to place quiet  
Where we are quite alone  
Kiss and we hold together  
We will be until we're done  
  
People stare and we just ignore  
What's the use in hiding out  
She says all the time  
Let their eyes do the worrying about  
  
Walk and talk, we both do quite well  
And kissing all the time, kissing all the time  
And I'm looking forward to much more  
  
Both say that we never before  
Never before have we felt so recently  
People stare and we just ignore everything  
People stare and we just ignore them  
And they go away, go away
