The christmas season here at last  
I wish you peace and joy  
I'll sing this song of times long gone  
And pray you will enjoy  
For the fondest memories I recall  
Were on a christmas morn'  
When my dear father sang his songs  
And christ the king was born  
The songs he sang so loudly rang  
Throughout our happy house  
But when mother took her turn,  
He sat as quietly as a mouse  
The fondest memories I recall  
Were on a christmas morn'  
How mother sang the sweetest songs  
And christ the king was born.  
I am my father's son you know  
And I sing on christmas day  
I sing a song to days long gone  
And those who've passed away  
I have four children proud and strong  
And they have children too  
And on christmas morn they sing along  
Just like we use to do  
The fondest memories we shall have  
Take place on christmas morn'  
My children's children sing their songs  
And christ the king is born.
