Lost in the city  
Deserted and cold  
Watching the cars passing by  
There all going places  
That we used to go  
And it's driving me out of my mind  
  
[Chorus]  
And it's making me blue  
Indelibly blue  
I can't erase the memories of me and you  
Indelibly blue  
  
They say when one love is ended  
Another is born  
That's no consolation to me  
Just show me some sunlight  
A rose without thorns  
And maybe I'll start to believe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Well just color me blue)  
  
Oh all my life  
I've waited for one love to make it alright  
But now I feel heartaches and tears  
Of a sad souvenirs that you left me  
Since you left me  
I'll just go on a day at a time  
Trying in vain to forget you  
But time and again you enter my mind  
Someday I swear I won't let you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Cause baby I'm blue)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(So just color me blue)
