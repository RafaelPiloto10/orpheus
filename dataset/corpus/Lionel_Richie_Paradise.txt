Let me tell you this  
Your love I can't resist  
I just start to fantasize  
Every time I look into your eyes  
  
I want to laugh and talk  
And say the words you long to hear  
I want to fill you up with so much love  
The real world will just disappear  
  
Chorus: let me take you to a place I call paradise  
Hold you in my arms every day and night  
Tell you all the things that I really feel  
Show you that my love is for real  
Let me take you to paradise  
Take you to paradise  
  
Let me be your guide  
On a magic carpet ride  
To a place where love is pure  
And our passions can endure  
I want you to close your eyes and realize  
A world for two  
I want you to hear me whisper in your ear  
I want to make love to you  
  
Let me take you to a place I call paradise  
Hold you in my arms every day and night  
Tell you all the things that I really feel  
Show you that my love is for real  
Let me take you to paradise  
Take you to paradise  
  
Do you want to go?  
Don't' you want to know?  
About a real love  
Give me just some time  
You'll like what you find  
I know  
It's so plain to me  
We were meant to be  
I want to show you baby  
We'll unlock all of life's Mysteries  
And realize how great our love can really be  
Let me take you to paradise
