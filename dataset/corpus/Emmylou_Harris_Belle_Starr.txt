(feat. Mark Knopfler)  
  
My mamma and my daddy  
Told me that love is a two-way street  
But lately baby, you've been finding  
New ways of dragging yout feet  
So come on, make your best shot  
You don't have to take the blame  
I'll be your belle star  
You can be my Jesse James  
  
There's lonely people everywhere  
From Abilene to Arkansas  
The way they run for cover  
You'd think love was against the law  
Well i don't need a pistol , baby  
You won't have to rob a train  
You can be my belle star  
And i can be your Jesse James  
  
I know you've done some hard time  
Baby, and you've got your doubts  
When you feel surrounded  
And it's looking there's no way out  
I'll come riding to rescue  
All you gotta do is call my name  
I'll be your belle star  
You can be my Jesse James  
  
It don't take a genius, baby  
There aint no big mystery  
You can't play it safe  
And still go down in history  
So saddle up the horses  
'Cos we're headed for the hall of fame  
I'll be your belle star  
You can be my Jesse James  
I'll be your belle star  
You can be my Jesse James
