Silver and gold  
Silver and gold  
I'd rather have Jesus  
Than silver and gold  
No fame or fortune  
Nor riches untold  
I'd rather have Jesus  
Than silver and gold  
  
Don't give me a mansion  
On top of the hill  
Don't give the world  
With a shallow thrill  
But just give me a savior  
My life, he can hold  
I'd rather have Jesus  
Than silver and gold  
  
I woke up this morning  
Feeling kind of down  
I called on my best friend  
She could not be found  
But I called on Jesus  
My life, he can hold  
I'd rather have Jesus  
Than silver and gold  
  
For unto us a child is born  
A son is given  
I'd rather have Jesus  
What profits a man  
To gain the whole world  
And lose his soul  
I'd rather have Jesus  
For there's no other name  
Given under heaven  
Whereby we must be saved  
I'd rather have Jesus  
He's the only one that can save you  
I'd rather have Jesus than silver and gold
