This time girl i've had enough  
You're too hot to handle with kid gloves  
It's too late i hear a knock on the door  
The game's over baby i can't take it no more  
  
[Chorus]  
Breakout, breakout  
Take these chains from me  
You held my heart for ransom  
Baby, set it free  
Breakout, breakout  
Your lies can't hide what i see  
I'm better off on my own  
  
Promises made me in the heat of the night (whoa-oh-oh)  
Those words were broken under bedroom lights (whoa-oh)  
Your lips they burn your body calls my name (whoa-oh)  
I can feel the fire but it's all in vain (whoa-oh)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You say we'll meet around midnight  
You're gonna make me feel oh so right  
I'm saying oh no not tonight  
You gotta let me go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You say we'll meet around midnight  
You're gonna make me feel oh so right  
I'm saying oh no not tonight  
You gotta let me go
