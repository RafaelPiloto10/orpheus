[Chorus]  
Why don't we make believe we're in love again  
Who said the crimson moon doesn't shine  
Where do people go when they're lookin' for that one of a kind  
  
Why don't we make believe that we're sorry  
Why must we hold it all inside  
Where do lovers go when they're runnin' and there's no place to hide  
  
Always remember, the day we met in the foreign rain  
You were content and, we went our separate ways  
No matter which way the wind blows now, hang on to it anyhow  
Don't ever say it could never be the same  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Always remember, holding hands on a summer day  
You were content ob das stimmt?? and you took it all away  
I didn't come here to change your mind, lead you on and waste your time  
All alone in the evening, gettin' blue  
  
Why don't we make believe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Why don't we make believe, why don't we make believe
