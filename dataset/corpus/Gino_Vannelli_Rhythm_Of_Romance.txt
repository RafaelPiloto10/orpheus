Coke machines on the ho chi minh trail  
Russian spies shopping at bloomingdales  
Killer bees swarming up the rio grande  
Hey baby where'd you get that tan  
Rome burns as we dance cheek to cheek  
Titanic's sinking but oooh do we look chic  
New york city's got the hong kong flu  
And I can't take my eyes off you  
Mx gi joe  
Rsvp ufo  
Abcia  
I still want to know who shot jfk  
Let's dance  
To the rhythm of romance  
Let's swing  
'neath the stars above  
C'mon let's dance  
To the rhythm of romance  
Let's kiss  
Let's fall in love  
Johnny woke up from his american dream  
Rich man poor man and a desert in between  
Crystal chandeliers hangin' by a thread  
We're in the pink baby just two trillon in the red  
And I hear gabriel blowing his saxophone  
Through a great big hole in the ozone  
Who cares it the sun don't rise  
When I look in to your ultraviolet eyes  
That's life, this is war  
I took it on faith, can't take it anymore  
Old, young, yin and yang  
We'll all go together in the next big bang  
Boom shug a lug a lug a boom  
Let's dance  
To the rhythm of romance  
Let's swing  
'neath the stars above  
C'mon let's dance  
To the rhythm of romance  
Let's kiss  
Let's fall in love
