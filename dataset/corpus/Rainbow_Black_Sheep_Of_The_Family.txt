I've got nothing in my head  
Got a floor for a bed  
My future's at the bottom of a tea cup  
  
I got a half a pair of shoes  
And no time to lose  
I'm wondering when I'm going to wise up  
  
So, fortune shine your light on me and my nose  
'Cause we need some security  
You get a little bad luck  
And it grows and it grows  
I'm the black sheep of the family  
  
I've got half a pound of rice  
A beard full of lice  
A condition called retrogression  
  
I've got pocket full of dust  
And eating is a must  
If you want to make a good impression  
  
So, fortune shine your light on me and my dog  
'Cause we need some security  
While all the folks are living high on high on the hog  
I'm the black sheep of the family  
  
Don't talk to me about society  
You got to play the rules  
Or pay the penalty  
  
Because there's nothing to choose  
Between a handful of blues  
Double indemnity  
  
The hour was wrong  
And my shadow's getting long  
My real life's a song, don't need much  
I've got an ache in my head  
I want to go to bed  
Tomorrow I don't have to wake up, no  
  
So wisdom shine your light on me and my knees  
'Cause it's true what they say about familiarity  
There's nothing good this way  
And it's true they say  
I'm the black sheep of the family  
  
Oh, my wisdom shine your light on me and my knees  
It's true what they say about familiarity  
There's nothing good this way  
And it's true they say  
I'm the black sheep of the family  
Yeah, yeah  
  
I'm the black sheep of the family  
Just me and my dog, yeah, yeah  
I'm the black sheep of the family  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
I'm the black sheep of the family  
You've got me on my knees  
I'm the black sheep of the family  
Yeah, yeah, yeah
