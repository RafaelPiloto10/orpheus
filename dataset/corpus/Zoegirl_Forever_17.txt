Never thought it would be me  
Living in a shattered dream  
How could this be the end for me?  
What I wouldn't give to have  
  
A life to live  
A day to plan  
Instead I'll be Forever 17  
Could've lived out every dream  
Could've been most anything  
  
[Chorus]  
Can someone wake me up?  
I haven't lived yet, I'm only 17.  
God did you forget  
I'm just a baby and I don't want to be  
Forever 17  
  
I'll never have a bed to make  
A test to take  
A summer day  
I'll always be Forever 17  
  
Could've had a family  
If things had worked differently  
Instead I'll be Forever 17  
Could I have just one more day?  
A chance to learn from my mistakes?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In a matter of a moment  
Life fell before my eyes  
Now I'm looking at the meaning of the miracle of life  
Where were we going without even knowing the answer deep inside?  
  
Forever 17  
  
So don't give up  
You haven't lived yet  
You're only 17  
  
And God did not forget  
You're just a baby...
