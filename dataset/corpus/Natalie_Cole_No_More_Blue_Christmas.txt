Ooh, no wonder that I thought that they were going out of style  
I just had to meet you to make Christmas seem worthwhile  
  
Last year when I had to send my Christmas cards  
I had to sign my name alone  
But now your name is next to mine  
And there's more love in every line  
I'm wishing a Merry Christmas to everyone I've known  
  
No more blue Christmases they'll all be bright  
No more just pretending to be happy when I'm sad  
Going through the motions while others feel glad  
  
No more blue Christmases now that I've found you  
Oh, no wonder that I thought that they were going out of style  
I just had to meet you to make Christmas seem worthwhile  
  
Last year when I had to buy my Christmas gifts  
I had to do it on my own  
Ooh, champagne parties everywhere but without you I just didn't care  
Now there's more than just a Christmas tree to decorate my home  
  
No more blue Christmases now that I've found you  
Oh, no wonder that I thought that they were going out of style  
I just had to meet you to make Christmas seem worthwhile  
  
No more blue Christmases now that I've found you  
Ooh, no wonder that I thought that they were going out of style  
I just had to meet you to make Christmas seem worthwhile, oh  
I just had to meet you to make Christmas seem worthwhile  
  
Merry Christmas everyone
