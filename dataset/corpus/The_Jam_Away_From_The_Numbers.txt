Things are getting just too cozy for me  
And I see people as they see me  
Gonna break away and gain control  
You free your mind  
You free your soul  
I was the type who knocked at old men  
(history's easy)  
Who together at tables sit and drink beer  
(somewhere is really)  
Then I saw that I was really the same  
So this link's breaking away from the chain  
  
Away from the numbers  
Away from the numbers  
Is where I'm gonna be  
Away from the numbers  
Away from the numbers  
Is where I am free  
  
I was sick and tired of my little niche  
Well gonna break away and find where life is  
  
And all those fools I thought were my friends  
(coaching is easy)  
They now stare at me and don't see a thing  
(reality's so hard)  
Till their life is over and they start to moan  
How they never had the chance to make good  
  
Away from the numbers  
Away from the numbers  
Is where I'm gonna be  
Away from the numbers  
(away from the numbers)  
Away from the numbers  
Is where I am free  
Is where I am free  
Is where I'm gonna be  
Is reality  
  
Reality's so hard, reality's so hard
