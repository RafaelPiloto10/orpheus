This goes out to all the children  
All over the world  
This one's for the children  
Children of the world  
Come a little closer now  
So you can see the children's eyes  
There's no use in trying  
When you're dealing with the dying  
  
So let me have a talk with you  
And hope that you believe it too  
There's so many ways to help  
Laughter you can bring  
  
Come closer now  
See the children's eyes  
See the children's eyes  
You just have to give them a helping hand  
With a little bit of love  
And a little bit of time  
You can help the children of the world  
Just a little bit of love  
And a little bit of hope  
There're a lot of things to do  
To help the children of the world  
R'n'g is about to take control  
The only thing you got to do is set yourself free  
We got to help each other that's how it has to be  
  
2-4 Fam. Here to lend a helping hand  
Come a little closer now  
See it in their eyes  
We've got to keep on trying  
To stop the children crying  
  
Come closer now  
See the children's eyes  
See the children's eyes  
You just have to give them a helping hand  
Chorus  
We just have to understand  
They all need a helping hand  
With a little bit of love  
A little bit of love  
Lots of things to do  
Hope you know it, too  
We just want to give them a little hope  
  
[Chorus (until fade)]  
  
Help the children of the world
