Goodbye  
I hope we meet again  
Goodbye  
Is this how it's got to end  
But we've come to the end of our road together  
Made a stand that's gonna last forever  
Brother tell me what you're gonna do  
  
Will you take the high road  
Will you take the low road  
Will you take the fast train out of town  
To get back home  
  
Will you take the high road  
Will you take the low road  
Oh brother  
You're out on your own  
  
Goodbye  
Is this how it's got to be  
Call by we can rap over tea  
We've come to the end of our road together  
Made a stand that's gonna last forever  
Brother won't you tell me what you're gonna do  
  
Will you take the high road  
Will you take the low road  
Will you take the fast train out of town  
To get back home  
  
Will you take the high road  
Will you take the low road  
Oh brother, now that you're out on your own  
  
We learned a lot from each other  
That's how we came to be brothers  
Brother won't you tell me what your problem is  
Oh and  
Don't waste your time on hate  
Can be used in better ways  
Remember the time and better days  
  
Goodbye  
I hope we meet again  
But the good times  
Will always remain  
But we've come to the end  
Of our road together  
We made a stand that's gonna last forever  
Brother tell me what you're gonna do  
  
Will you take the high road  
Will you take the low road  
Will you take the fast train out of town  
To get back home  
Will you take the high road  
Will you take the low road  
Oh you're out on your own  
  
Now will you take the high road  
Or will you take the low road  
The fast train out of town  
To get back home  
  
Will you take the high road  
Will you take the low road  
Oh brother you're out on your own  
Out on your own  
Out on your own  
Out on your own
