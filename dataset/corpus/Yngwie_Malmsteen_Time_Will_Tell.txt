I've never killed another man  
I've never lived the master plan  
I can only pray that we'll survive  
  
With every sin and whitened line,  
I see the future slipping by  
The time is nearing, what have we done  
  
Is there a reason? Someone explain?  
And in the end will we pay?  
  
Time will Tell  
I will  
  
The hands of time we can't turn back  
Have we all slipped through the cracks  
Lord have mercy, forgive us all  
  
Is there a reason? Someone explain?  
And in the end will we pay?  
  
Time will Tell  
I will  
  
There's no use looking back  
Everything's turning black  
Time's running out for us all
