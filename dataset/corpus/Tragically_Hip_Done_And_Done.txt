Done and done  
I never get my way  
You always get your way  
I never get my way  
  
Done and done  
Talk about me  
I'll listen for hours  
'Cause I don't know how it ends  
  
We're through, through  
Through and through  
Yeah, through, through  
Through and through  
  
Done and done  
You always get your way  
I never get my way  
You always get your way  
  
Done and done  
Days accomplished  
If I had a wish  
It'd be for more of this  
  
This through, through  
Through and through  
Yeah, through, through  
Through and through  
  
Done and done  
Night accomplished  
If I had a wish  
I'd wish for more of this  
  
This through, through  
This through and through  
We're through, through  
Yeah, through and through
