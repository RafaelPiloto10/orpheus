I have often dreamed of a far-off place  
Where a great warm welcome will be waiting for me.  
Where the crowds will cheer when they see my face,  
And a voice keeps saying this is where I'm meant to be.  
  
I will find my way.  
I can go the distance.  
I'll be there some day  
If I can be strong.  
I know ev'ry mile  
Will be worth my while.  
I would go most anywhere  
To feel like I belong.  
  
I am on my way.  
I can go the distance.  
I don't care how far,  
Somehow I'll be strong.  
I know ev'ry mile  
Will be worth my while.  
I would go most anywhere  
To find where I belong.  
  
I will beat the odds.  
I can go the distance.  
I will face the world,  
Fearless, proud and strong.  
I will please the gods.  
I can go the distance.  
Till I find my hero's welcome  
Right where I belong.
