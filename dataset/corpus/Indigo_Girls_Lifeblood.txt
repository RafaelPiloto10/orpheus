Another night in a succession  
Thinly glued with beer and wine  
Its a precarious profession  
Every day at work sees your heart on the line  
Maybe I should have gone to business school  
Or gained myself a respectable trade  
Or stayed in childhood where the shade keeps you cool  
Making my living selling lemonade  
But running through my veins  
Are the words and the refrains  
As if they were my lifeblood itself  
And you know I can't stay alive on the food of 9 to 5  
My dreams are just old picture on the shelf  
Oh yeah  
  
I remember the folks said give it a try  
Or you'll never know who you might have been  
And just remember nothing is the end of the world  
Until the world comes to an end  
Still there's a point to this philosophy  
(when you take a look inside)  
Of taking a look at who you are  
Still sometimes all I have to help me see  
Are all the mirrors behind the bar  
But running through my veins  
Are the words and the refrains  
As if they were my lifeblood itself  
And you know I can't stay alive on the food of 9 to 5  
My dreams are just old picture on the shelf  
Oh yeah  
  
But running through my veins  
Are the words and the refrains  
As if they were my lifeblood itself  
And you know I can't stay alive on the food of 9 to 5  
My dreams are just old picture on the shelf  
Oh yeah
