You infiltrate my every hour  
You bug me like a flea  
I only wish I had the power  
To cut you free of me  
Like some crustacean on my hull  
You stick with me and make life dull  
How can I make you see  
I'm in love with you  
You typify the things to me  
That I no longer do  
So get a grip and let me be  
And my life will improve  
Leave me alone, get off my case  
You're always there right in my face  
But that is nothing new  
I'm so in love with you  
  
It's funny how I loved you like  
The bottle at my lips  
And when I fell off of my bike  
My life had been eclipsed  
By all the grief and disbelief there at your finger  
At your fingertips  
  
You hoover up the very words  
I choose to throw away  
I know some people never learn  
So how can I complain  
You hiss at me and make me shake  
Like some old grumpy rattlesnake  
Let's think this through again  
I'm so in love with you
