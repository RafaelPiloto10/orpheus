Large fingers pushin' paint...  
You're God and you got big hands...  
The colors blend...  
The challenges you give man...  
Seek my part...devote myself...  
My small self...like a book amongst the many on a shelf...  
Sometimes I know sometimes I rise  
Sometimes I fall sometimes I don't  
Sometimes I cringe sometimes I live  
Sometimes I walk sometimes I kneel  
Sometimes I speak of nothing at all...  
Sometimes I reach to myself, dear God...
