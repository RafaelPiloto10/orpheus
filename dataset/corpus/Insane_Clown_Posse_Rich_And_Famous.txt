This is the rags to riches story  
Of the insane clown posse  
  
  
Mancow made us rich and famous  
Whole world hate us, mancow played us  
Now look at us, platinum status  
We owe it all to mancow  
  
  
I've violent j and i'm rich like rush limbaugh is fat imagine that  
First, mancow put us on the air  
And everybody jumped on our wagons right there  
Mancow's been down with the clown  
Since kurt cobain's head was still around  
I won't forget how i made my bread  
Cause i remember we was like john denver, hehe...dead  
Back then i thought i was the bomb  
I couldn't even sell a tape to my own mom  
I was broke, dinner was grain and rye  
Now i sit with chilled faygo in a phat ride  
And at shows i sold out nightly  
On top of that i think erma likes me  
Mickey mouse we ain't goin no place  
So bitch get used to my ugly face, c'mon  
Shaggs 2 dope and i'm a high school drop out  
Convicted felon, i don't mind tellin  
You hear my lyrics and you hate my guts  
But i got a million bucks and you don't  
I don't even make sense when i rap  
Bllll skkkee skkkaaa how you like that?  
Soon as mancow hit the switch  
Next thing you know we got rich, uhh  
  
  
Mancow made us rich and famous  
Whole world hate us, mancow played us  
Now look at us, platinum status  
We owe it all to mancow
