We want Billy  
Where is Billy  
Give us Billy  
We want Billy  
B-I double L-Y  
We're all his  
He's our kind of a guy  
And ooh what luck  
Cuz here he is  
  
(bandmaster speaking)  
Ladies and Gentlemen  
Presenting the silver tongued prince of the courtroom  
The one the only  
Billy Flynn!!!!  
  
(Billy Flynn)  
I don't care about expensive things  
Cashmere coats, diamond rings  
Don't mean a thing  
All I care about is love  
That's what I'm here for(that's what he's here for)  
  
I don't care for wearing silk crevats  
Ruby Studs, Satin Spats  
Don't mean a thing  
All I care about is(all he cares about is love) love  
Give me two eyes of blue  
Softly saying "I need You"  
Let me see her standing there and  
Honest mister I'm a millionaire  
  
I don't care for any fine attire  
Vanderbilt might admire  
No no not me  
All I care about is(all he cares about is love) love  
(whistling)  
That's what he's here for  
(whistling continues)  
All he cares about is love  
  
Show me long raven hair  
Flowing down bout to there  
When I see her runnin' free  
Keep your money  
That's enough for me  
  
I don't care for driving packard cars  
Or smoking long buck cigars  
No no not me(woooo)  
All I care about is doing the guy in  
Who's picking on you  
Twisting the wrist that's turning the screw  
  
All I (he) care (cares) about is love!!!!!!!!!
