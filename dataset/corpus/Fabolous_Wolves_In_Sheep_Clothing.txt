[Intro]  
Yeah, yeah, yeh  
Them n-ggas is talking baby  
Don't listen to that sh-t  
Don't mind them, they just talking baby  
They know they can't f-ck with me baby  
(That mean they can't f-ck with you)  
You tell them like that bitch told Scarface  
(What she say?)  
"I don't fuck with the help"  
  
[Verse]  
They say they out for dead presidents, never respected  
First of all, Ben Franklin was never elected  
That means him and Big Bills have never connected  
They just say it cause they think it sounds clever on records  
Secondly, God's first should never be second  
And if you living wrong, money can never correct it  
I'mma say it once, then it's whoever direct it  
You never get off on me, I'm never the exit  
All black everything in my black V  
It ain't a game and if it was, it'd be a black Wii  
I'm on my "A" game, never on that "B" shit  
You on that B-shit, never gonna be shit  
That's how I "C" shit, cause I am "D" shit  
True story, like that Hollywood "E" shit  
I say "F" n-ggas cause I'm on some "G" shit  
Yeah, that red-and-green stripe double G shit  
That was for my homie, just know I'm thinking of you  
I told him "stay on top so they can't get above you"  
He told me "I dig that like a f-ckin shovel"  
Why it take a n-gga go to jail to say he love you?  
We be killing them, boy we be killing them!  
Damn, we used to dream to have a million  
Now the family get money like Will and them  
Accounts rise like we filling them with helium  
My baby girl got ass, it's no secret that it  
Make you look away and still be peeking at it  
She said they come with painted faces trying to clown on you  
How they under you but try to talk down on you  
You see, a rat is gonna be that and go for any cheddar  
Tell my bitch that I'm no good, as if they any better!  
But her loyalty keep her from them other boys  
Let em holla, she just gonna exist above the noise
