I could cry some chin-chin tears  
Where have I been all these years  
A little while come on tell me now  
How long has this been going on  
What a kick and how I buzz  
My son you click like nobody does  
Listen sweet I repeat  
How long has this been going on  
  
[Chorus]  
I feel like I could melt right into heaven  
I've heard  
And now I know how Columbus felt  
Finding another world  
Kiss me once and then again once more  
God what a dunce I was before  
What a break for heaven sake  
How long has this been going on  
  
[Chorus]
