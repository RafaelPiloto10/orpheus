Love breathes when your out of breath  
Love sits by the bedside when you're near to death  
Love still fells you when the feeling's gone  
Love lives on and on  
  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Love is the right place  
Took me awhile, took me awhile to get it straight  
Now I want to stay  
And everyday of my life I realize love is the right place  
Love is the right place  
  
Love it moves in mysterious ways  
Like the mist on the river at the break of day  
So pull open your shutters, sing a morning song  
Love moves on and on  
  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Love is the right place  
Took me awhile, took me awhile to get it straight  
Now I want to stay  
And everyday of my life I realize love is the right place  
Love is the right place  
  
Hey, hey  
  
Where you are, near or far  
Sun and moon, moon and stars  
I know, I know  
  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
Love is the right place  
Took me awhile, took me awhile to get it straight  
Now I want to stay  
And everyday of my life I realize love is the right place  
Love is the right place  
  
Love is the right place  
Love is the right place  
Love is the right place  
  
Hey yeah
