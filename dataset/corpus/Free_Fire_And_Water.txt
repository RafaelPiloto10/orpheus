Every single day, I got a heartache comin' my way  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
Baby but look at the tears in my eye  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
Mama but look at the way you made me cry  
Every way that's nice  
You show you've got a heart that's made of ice  
  
And I know  
  
Fire and water must have made you their daughter  
You've got what it takes, to make a poor man's heart break  
A poor mans heart break  
  
Baby you turn me on  
But as quick as a flash your love is gone  
Baby I'm gonna leave you now  
But I'm gonna try to make you grieve somehow  
  
Fire and water must have made you their daughter  
You've got what it takes to make a poor man's heart break  
A poor man's heart break  
And my heart is breakin' too  
  
(ahh yeah)  
  
(alright)  
  
I don't wanna say goodbye baby  
But look at the tears you made me cry  
Every way that's nice  
You show you've got a heart that's made of ice  
And I know  
  
Fire and water must have made you their daughter  
You've got what it takes to make a poor mans heart break  
  
Fire, fire and water must have made you their daughter  
Baby you've got what it takes to make a poor man's heart break  
Heart break  
  
Baby and my heart is breakin'  
Ohh my heart is breakin'  
Ohh listen
