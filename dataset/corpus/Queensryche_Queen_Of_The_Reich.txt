In the dead of night  
She'll come and take you away  
Searing beams of light and thunder  
Over blackened plains  
She will find her way  
  
Flying high through the night  
She will hide your fate  
As she takes your soul from under  
And the blinding light of the castle fades  
  
There is no escape  
It's the ending of your precious life  
  
Your soul slipped away  
It belongs to the Queen of the Reich  
The Queen of the Reich  
Yeah she's coming for you  
  
You're fading away  
Your life cast astray  
A victim the beast shall obtain  
  
The light will not shine  
For you'll die tonight at her shrine  
And black is the last thing you'll see  
  
Over and over  
Dreams of dying fill your head  
It's the sign of the cross  
That you'll find ahead  
  
No one will answer  
The light is fading away  
Captive souls are screaming out in pain  
  
There is no escape  
It's the ending of your precious life  
  
Your soul slipped away  
It belongs to the Queen of the Reich  
You're fading away, No, No, No  
The Queen of the Reich  
You're slipping away, yeah  
The Queen of the Reich
