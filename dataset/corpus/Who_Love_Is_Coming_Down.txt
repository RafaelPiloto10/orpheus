Surrounded by people  
A real heavy crowd  
But inside I still feel lonely now  
  
Should I get away  
From the high heels so proud  
Is there something different life can show me now  
  
First chance - I blew it, I better start it all again  
Second chance - Ooh, I knew it wouldn't be as easy as they said  
Third chance - I'm cut up, life's like a razor's edge  
Fourth chance - Ooh, I'm all shut up and I'm standing on the ledge  
  
And I'm goin' down (I'm goin' down)  
Goin' down (I'm goin' down)  
Goin' down (I'm goin' down)  
Ooh, down  
  
I'm not a loser  
But did I really win?  
Can I afford to go through it all again?  
  
I hope I don't sound  
As immature as I feel  
But when I get wise, I'll give you a call, my friend  
  
First chance - I blew it, I better start it all again  
Second chance - Ooh, I knew it wouldn't be as easy as they said  
Third chance - I'm cut up, life's like a razor's edge  
Fourth chance - I'm all shut up and I'm standing on the ledge  
  
Now I'm goin' down (I'm goin' down)  
Goin' down (I'm goin' down)  
Goin' down (I'm goin' down)  
Ooh, down (down)  
  
Love is coming down on me, ooh yeah  
Love is burning, teaching, turning out in me  
Love is coming down, down  
Down, down  
Down, down  
  
I'm not a loser  
But did I really win?  
I'm lookin' forward to doin' it all again
