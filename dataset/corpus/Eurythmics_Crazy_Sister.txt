Driving me home in your car watching you drive  
Through obstacles and icicles, keeping my mind on it's lead  
Keeping it warm, with chemicals and therapy  
Turn it on take me over crazy sister  
Digging a hole in your heart  
Watching you breathe, punishment and oxygen  
Letting my mind off it's lead  
I watched it disappear, to somewhere dark and reassuring  
Turn it on (can you believe it)  
Take me over (it's psychomazingly true)  
Turn it on crazy sister  
And when I feel it (it's psychomazing it's you)  
Staying at home. Plugging it in  
Kissing the screen, being a god  
Staying at home, screwing it in  
Fucking the screen, being a god  
Turn it on (can you feel it)  
Crazy sister  
Turn it on (can you believe it)  
Crazy sister  
Turn it on, take me over  
Crazy sister  
Crazy sister
