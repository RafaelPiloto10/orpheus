The man finds himself alone for the first time in his life  
He's always got a problem, he's got to work it out wrong or right  
He's got to work it out, he's so lonely in the night  
He's got to work it all alone  
  
Now who in the world would believe that he's got another trick up his sleeve  
And who in the world wants to know which way should he go  
Which way should he turn? which way should he learn?  
Which day should he stop? which way to the top?  
  
I remember him when we were friends, when we were young, way back then  
I still can recall when we were small how he tried his best to warn us all  
  
This living on his own has turned his heart to stone and it's all pain  
He sits out on his own and eats his heart out alone in the pouring rain  
Now who in the world would have know  
That just a few years ago his love could have grown and grown  
  
Through the rain, the sleet and snow  
But the rain, the sleet and snow chills the heart and kills the soul  
So the let the cold winds blow  
What he doesn't see he doesn't know  
  
I remember him when we were friends, when we were young, way back then  
I recall it all when we were small how he tried his best to warn us all  
  
I remember it still, I always will when we were friends way back then  
I recall it all when we were small how he tried his best to warn us all  
He said, watch out for the danger  
He said, watch out  
  
The man is a winner for the first time in his life  
He looks a little thinner but he says hey that doesn't matter  
But if you look closely  
You'll see a cold smug self-satisfactory smile behind  
  
And now that he has won it doesn't matter how or which way it was done  
Now that he's in control, revenge is in his heart and soul  
The power is at his fingertips, vengeance is on his lips  
But the power he fought to control now has got him in it's grips  
  
I remember him when we were friends, when we were young, way back then  
I recall it all when we were small how he tried his best to warn us all  
  
I remember it still, I always will when we were friends way back then  
I recall it all when we were small how he tried his best to warn us all  
  
I remember him when we were friends, when we were young, way back then  
But now we're all grown up and we're strangers  
You see, bit by bit, part by part, we slipped and slipped  
Till we'd grown apart and now we're strangers
