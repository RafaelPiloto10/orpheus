Well, I dreamed I saw the knights  
In armor coming,  
Saying something about a queen.  
There were peasants singing and  
Drummers drumming  
And the archer split the tree.  
There was a fanfare blowing  
To the sun  
That was floating on the breeze.  
Look at Mother Nature on the run  
In the nineteen seventies.  
Look at Mother Nature on the run  
In the nineteen seventies.  
  
I was lying in a burned out basement  
With the full moon in my eyes.  
I was hoping for replacement  
When the sun burst thru the sky.  
There was a band playing in my head  
And I felt like getting high.  
I was thinking about what a  
Friend had said  
I was hoping it was a lie.  
Thinking about what a  
Friend had said  
I was hoping it was a lie.  
  
Well, I dreamed I saw the silver  
Space ships flying  
In the yellow haze of the sun,  
There were children crying  
And colors flying  
All around the chosen ones.  
All in a dream, all in a dream  
The loading had begun.  
They were flying Mother Nature's  
Silver seed to a new home in the sun.  
Flying Mother Nature's  
Silver seed to a new home.
