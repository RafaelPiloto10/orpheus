Tight-slacked clad girls on the graveyard shift  
Neath the cement stroll  
Catch the midnight drift  
Cigar chewing Charlie  
In the newspaperness  
Grifting hot-horse tips  
On who's running the best  
  
[Chorus]  
And I'm blinded by the neon  
Don't try and change my tune  
Cause I thought I heard a saxophone  
I'm drunk on the moon  
  
And the moon's a silver slipper  
It's pouring champagne stars  
Broadway's like a serpent  
Pulling shiny top-down cars  
Laramer is teeming  
With that undulating beat  
And some Bonneville is screaming  
It's way wilder down the street  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hearts flutter and race  
The moon's on the wane  
Tarts mutter their dream hopes  
The night will ordain  
Come schemers and dancers  
Cherry delight  
As a Cleveland-bound Greyhound  
And it cuts through the night  
  
And I've hawked all my yesterdays  
Don't try and change my tune  
'Cause I thought I heard a saxophone  
I'm drunk on the moon
