Autumn in New York  
Why does it seem so inviting  
Autumn in New York  
It spells the thrill of first-nighting  
  
Glittering crowds and shimmering clouds  
In canyons of steel  
They're making me feel, I'm home  
  
It's autumn in New York  
That brings the promise of new love  
Autumn in New York  
Is often mingled with pain  
  
Dreamers with empty hands  
They sigh for exotic lands  
It's autumn in New York  
It's good to live it again  
  
Autumn in New York  
The gleaming rooftops at sundown  
Oh, autumn in New York  
It lifts you up when you run down  
  
Yes, Jaded Rogues and gay Divorces  
Who lunch at the Ritz  
Will tell you that it's divine  
  
This autumn in New York  
Transforms the slums into Mayfair  
Oh, autumn in New York  
You'll need no castles in Spain  
  
Yes, lovers that bless the dark  
On the benches in Central Park  
Greet autumn in New York  
It's good to live it again  
  
Autumn in New York  
That brings the promise of new love  
Autumn in New York  
Is often mingled with pain  
  
Dreamers with empty hands  
They sigh for exotic lands  
It's autumn in New York  
It's good to live it again
