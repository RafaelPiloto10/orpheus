Send me I will go  
Send me I will  
To this city, to this nation  
And to the nations of the world  
  
Send me I will go  
Send me I will go  
I will proclaim the truth  
That Jesus Christ is Lord  
  
I stand before you pleading from my heart  
That by your Spirit you would set me apart  
To bring good news and liberty  
To see this nation on its knees  
  
I cry out for every family  
You'd open blind eyes and set people free  
That as a nation we would turn back to you  
And see revival sweep this land  
  
As we humble ourselves  
And seek Your face  
Fall on our knees  
Turn from our ways  
  
You will hear our cry  
Wipe our sins away  
Come and heal our land we pray
