There is nothing new  
Put in front of you  
Nothing you don't understand  
Don't try to rationalize  
No one hears your lies  
Only you can comprehend  
  
You don't want to see  
You don't want to hear  
You don't want to feel at all  
Tell me that you've tries  
Mind is open wide  
But you're not listening at all  
  
Please don't question me I don't have the time  
If there's a problem that it's easier to set aside  
There is nothing that will make you want to change your mind  
You can't take it  
You can't make it  
You can't make it so why try?
