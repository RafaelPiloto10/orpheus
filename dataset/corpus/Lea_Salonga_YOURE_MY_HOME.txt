I close my eyes  
And I can feel that you're a part of me  
You are my home  
Though I'm afar I'm in your company  
I'm in you  
  
I play my song  
And I can hear you're in my melody  
My life, my home  
No matter what with you I'll always be  
  
Refrain:  
You're my home  
And together we share this love for us  
To be happy and free  
You're my home  
And together we'll strive to make this world  
A better place to be  
  
Come take my hand  
Come fill your heart with all the love you see  
Let every child  
Be what they are, be what they want to be  
  
You're my home  
And together we share this love for us  
To be happy and free  
You're my home  
And together we'll strive to make this world  
A better place to be  
  
For you and me...
