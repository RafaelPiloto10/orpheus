Now the cry of the toucan for your man is history  
Welcome to Heaven, the land of the rich and the free  
The water's so clean you can fill your canteen with it cold  
Please hand me your locket and I promise you pockets of gold  
No soldiers to knock on your door  
Now what can a man ask for more  
  
[Chorus:]  
Persona non grata!  
Just lay your money down  
Persona non grata!  
On your knees and kiss the ground  
  
I know all the right people we will make you legal in a flash  
I won't take no for an answer no credit no checks just cash  
Well it may seem like a lot but I'm really not in it for greed  
As god as my witness I have a family and mistress to feed  
What price can you put on a dream  
Your fortune lies across the stream  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Persona non grata!  
Persona non grata!  
No soldiers to knock on your door  
Now what can a man ask for man  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Persona non grata! [Repeat]  
Lay your money down [Repeat]  
Persona non grata! [Repeat]
