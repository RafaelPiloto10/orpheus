Oh, life is so hard  
And you have to choose  
The call of the wind  
On the highway of fools  
Why does a man never cry when he's feeling  
You murder all his feelings  
Will you still be there  
Only love knows why  
Between the fire  
When white doves cry?  
Why does a man never show what he's meaning  
To murder all his feelings  
And you cry in the night  
When there's no one besides  
Your tears  
  
Don't worry baby  
I'll be by your side  
Don't let it ever get you down with you tonight  
Don't worry baby  
Where he has gone?  
My heart is out of my control  
I'm falling strong  
  
Don't worry pretty baby  
Come and get you down tonight  
Come and get  
Come and get  
Come and get you down  
Your heart of pride  
Don't worry pretty baby  
Come and get you down tonight  
Come and get  
Come and get  
Come and get you down  
Your heart of pride  
Heart and pride  
  
I live for love  
And you've got to try  
Oh, don't let this chance, baby pass you by  
Why does a girl never cry when her feelings  
Are murdered by bad dealings  
It started in heaven  
There's a place for you  
Give me the chance for a rendez-vous  
Why does a girl never shows what she's meaning  
You murder all her feelings  
And you cry in the night  
When there's no one beside  
Your tears
