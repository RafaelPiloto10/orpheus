In the beginning God made the land  
Then He made the water and creatures, then He made man  
He was born with a passion, love and hate  
A restless spirit with a need for a mate  
But there was something that was missing, something lost  
So he came with the answer, here's what it cost  
One part love, one part wild  
One part lady, one part child  
  
I give you  
Women, women, lots of pretty women  
Men, men, they can't live without them  
Women, women, lots of pretty women  
Men, men, they can't live without them  
  
And in the garden, lust began  
The animal instinct, the wanton man  
She fed him with a hunger, an appetite  
And fillin' with emotion he took a bite  
It was one part love, one part child  
One part lover, one part wild  
  
I give you  
Women, women, lots of pretty women  
Men, men, they can't live without them  
Women, women, lots of pretty women  
Men, men, they can't live without them  
  
Skin on skin, let the love begin  
Women  
  
It was one part love, one part wild  
One part lover, one part child  
A whole lotta fire, a little bit of ice  
A whole lotta something you can't sacrifice  
  
I give you  
Hair, eyes, skin on skin  
Legs, thighs  
What's that spell  
  
Women, women, oh, oh  
Women, women, callin' every girl  
Women, women, all around the world  
Women, women, oh we can't live without them  
Women, women
