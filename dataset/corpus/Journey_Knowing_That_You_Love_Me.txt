I still see the look in your eyes  
The night you walked into my life  
And how we danced  
And the way that we touched  
Let me know you'd be mine  
And how your love has set me free  
An angel watching over me  
  
You lift me up if I should fall  
Showing me love  
When I was blind to it all  
I face the fire and I stand tall  
Knowing that you love me  
  
Shared my dreams, gave me wings to soar  
My guiding light through the raging storm  
I find my strength to carry on  
Knowing that you love me  
  
If I could, I'd go back in time  
To be there the day you were born  
To hold you close  
Or to see your smile  
And rock you away in my arms  
To stand beside you through the tears  
Letting go of all the fears  
  
You lift me up if I should fall  
Showing me love when I was blind to it all  
I face the fire and I stand tall  
Knowing that you love me  
  
Ooh, someone to care  
And someone to share  
The little things that bring joy  
To my life ooh, it scares me  
We're so close but in my heart  
It's got to know  
I can't imagine me in a world without you  
(You lift me up)  
  
You lift me up if I should fall  
Showing me love when I was blind to it all  
I face the fire and I stand tall  
Knowing that you love me  
  
Shared my dreams, gave me wings to soar  
My guiding light  
Through the raging storm  
Ooh, I find my strength to carry on  
Knowing that you love me  
  
That's all I'll ever need  
Is knowing that you love me
