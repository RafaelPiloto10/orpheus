Mothers crying in the street  
Children dying at their feet, tell me why  
People starving everywhere  
There's too much food but none to spare, tell me why  
  
Can you see that shaft of sunlight  
Can you see it in my eyes  
I can feel the fire that's burning  
Anger and hope so deep  
So deep within my heart  
Before my eyes  
For some it's too late  
It seems there's no-one listening  
  
People sleeping in the streets  
No roof above, no food to eat, tell me why  
See the questions in their eyes  
Listen to their children's cries, tell me why  
  
If there's a God  
Is he watching  
Can he give a ray of hope  
So much pain and so much sorrow  
Tell me what does he see  
When he looks at you  
When he looks at me  
What would he say  
It seems there's no-one listening  
  
Who would think it still could happen  
Even in this time and place  
Politicians, they may save themselves  
But they won't save their face  
Just hope against hope  
It's not too late  
  
You say there's nothing you can do  
Is there one rule for them and one for you  
Tell me why  
  
Listen can you see that shaft of sunlight  
Can you see it in my eyes  
I can feel the fire that's burning  
Anger and hope so deep  
So deep within my heart  
Before my eyes  
For some it's too late  
It seems there's no-one listening  
  
Hurry for me, hurry for me, they cry
