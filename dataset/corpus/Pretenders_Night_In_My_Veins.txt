I see him standing silhouetted  
In the lamp-light  
I cross the street  
And I quicken my pace  
He cups his hands and he  
Lights a cigarette  
I find myself in the bones of his face  
  
It's just the night in my veins  
Oh  
Making me crawl in the dust again  
It's just the night  
Under my skin  
Slipping it in  
  
He's got his hands in my hair  
And his lips everywhere  
Oh yeah  
It feels good  
It's alright  
Even if it's just  
The night in my veins  
  
He's got me up against the back of a  
Pick-up truck  
Out of sight of the neon and glare  
We might as well be on a beach  
Under the moonlight  
Love's language reads the same  
Anywhere yeah  
  
It's just the night in my veins  
Oh  
Making me crawl in the dust again  
It's just the night  
Under my skin  
Slipping it in  
  
He's got his chest on my back  
Across a new Cadillac  
Oh yeah  
It feels good  
It's alright  
Even if it's just  
The night in my veins  
Even if it's just the night in my veins  
  
I've got my head on the  
Kerb and I can't produce  
A word  
Oh year  
It feels good  
It's alright  
Even if it's just  
The night in my veins  
  
It feels good  
It's alright  
Even if it's just  
The night in my veins  
  
Even if it's just  
The night in my veins  
It feels good  
It's alright
