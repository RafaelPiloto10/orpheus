Motor  
  
Still can't believe it, can't stand to leave it  
But I know the rules  
We were doomed babe, too much too soon babe  
Acting like fools  
  
Tried to fly and climbed too high  
We saw it all, we had to fall  
But I swear it's true, was all for you  
I swear it's true, was all for you  
  
Making love all the time,  
Never let the day go by, or a night  
Sweet music in the dark  
You always found the spark to light my light  
  
[Chorus:]
