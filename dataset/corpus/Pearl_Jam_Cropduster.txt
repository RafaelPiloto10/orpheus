Light green to green, dark green, brown  
Every life is falling down  
Brown to black, it's coming back  
Dies to be part of the ground  
Seed to seedling, root to stem  
  
Eyes, no eyes, there's no difference,  
Every life is looking in  
Swallowing seeds on the deathbed,  
Dig a hole in, the garden.  
  
Everyone is practicing,  
But this world's an accident.  
I was the fool because I thought  
  
I thought the world  
Turns out the world thought me  
It's all the other way round  
We're upside down  
  
Daddy's gone up flames,  
But this ain't no movie  
This ain't no book you can close  
When the big lie hits your eye.  
  
Everybody's practicing,  
Our world's an accident  
I was the fool because I thought  
  
Let the fluency set it down.  
There's an upside of down.  
  
The moon is rolling around.
