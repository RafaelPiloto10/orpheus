Whenever you're near me  
I give you everything I have  
Someone to believe in  
When things are good and when they're bad  
You know how to please me  
Ooh, like nobody can  
Someone to believe in  
Be my love and be my friend  
  
When every race is run and the day is closing in  
I feel the need to hold you  
Let the night begin  
Come softly to me  
Show me why  
  
Whenever you're near me  
I give you everything I have  
Someone to believe in  
When things are good and when they're bad  
You know how to please me  
Ooh, like nobody can  
Someone to believe in  
Be my love and be my friend  
  
I cannot wait to feel  
The beating of your heart  
The days are long  
They're just keeping us apart  
Come softly to me  
Show me why  
  
Whenever you're near me  
I give you everything I have  
Someone to believe in  
When things are good and when they're bad  
You know how to please me  
Ooh, like nobody can  
Someone to believe in  
Be my love and be my friend  
  
Whenever you're near me  
  
Love is the reason  
We can feel this way inside  
Oh oh  
Turning the world around and making us wild  
Love is the music  
Beating in our hearts tonight  
Oh oh, lighting the way  
To take us deeper inside  
  
Whenever you're, whenever you're near me  
I give you everything I have  
Someone to believe in  
When things are good and when they're bad  
You know how to please me  
Ooh, like nobody can  
Someone to believe in  
Be my love and be my friend  
  
Whenever you're near me  
Someone to believe in  
When things are good and when they're bad  
You know how to please me  
Someone to believe in  
Be my love and be my friend  
  
Whenever you're near me
