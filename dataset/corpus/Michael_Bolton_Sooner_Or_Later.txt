So you love the way he holds you in the night  
And you believe him when he tells you  
Everything's alright  
But I wonder if you know  
The nature of his game  
And all the others he's been lovin' just the same  
Yeah  
  
CHORUS  
Sooner or later, somebody's gotta let you know  
Sooner or later, somebody's gotta let you know  
It might as well be me  
It might as well be me  
Yeah  
  
  
Promises and plans inside your head  
As you sit alone and think of things he said  
But of all the love you tell me  
You know you've been tastin'  
It's much more than all your time  
I know you've been wastin' babe, yeah  
  
  
CHORUS  
  
  
I hate to be the one to bring you down  
But everybody's talking, it's all over town  
The same old story  
They tell me that's the way it goes  
I'm the first to tell you, now  
And, baby you're the last to know, yeah  
  
  
CHORUS  
Sooner or later, somebody's gotta let you know  
Sooner or later, somebody's gotta let you know
