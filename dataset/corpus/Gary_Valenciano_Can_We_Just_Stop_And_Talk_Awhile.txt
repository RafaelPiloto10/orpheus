Fancy meeting you alone in the crowd  
Couldn't help but notice your smile  
While everybody else around us is going about  
Can we just stop and talk awhile?  
  
I've been often told our world's growing old  
And that friends are harder to find  
Do tell me more about yourself  
We could share a thought or two  
Now who would mind?  
  
Maybe then we could go for a ride  
Drive down to the countryside  
Get away from the gray  
And frenzied hurly-burly of the city life  
  
Early yet to say what lies ahead  
It's the first day of the rest of our lives  
Can we just stop and talk awhile  
Get to know each other  
Who are we to know?  
Love could be waiting at the end  
'Round that bend and so  
Let's stop and talk awhile  
  
Can we just stop and talk awhile  
Get to know each other  
Who are we to know?  
Love could be waiting at the end  
'Round that bend and so  
Let's stop and talk awhile  
Let's stop and talk awhile  
Let's stop and talk awhile  
Let's stop and talk awhile
