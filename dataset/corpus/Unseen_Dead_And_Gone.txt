You were a violent drunk but now your dead and gone  
You were ruining my life the damage had been caused  
On the day of your funeral my life was reborn  
  
The first time I saw you I could sense bad luck  
It was eleven a.m. as you were drinking on my couch  
And then you moved in like a terrential rain storm  
You had nowhere to go but I knew where you were goin'  
  
You smiled when I was home but you abused when I was gone  
You hit my younger brothers and then you'd taunt me  
And when I would confront you you'd say it was a lie  
Well I was at your funeral happy that you died  
  
Dead and gone  
That night in the kitchen I trashed my house  
There was a fist fight and I threw you out  
And you were loaded with no place to go  
So you passed out and blacked out in the snow  
We got a phone call saying that you were dead  
All the shit you put me through raced through my head  
You died on a dirty motel floor  
Now you can't make me suffer anymore  
  
Do you see what I see  
You were a violent drunk  
You were ruining my life  
The damage you have caused  
On the day of your funeral  
My life was reborn
