Runnin' from the rate race  
Just as fast as I can  
Take off my tie so I can breathe  
Me, I'm going where the fresh air's blowin'  
Take a little walk in the country with me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Walk in the country with me  
Watch the sun sinkin' down on the trees  
It's gonna do us some good  
To get down in the woods  
Take a little walk in the country with me  
  
I'm so sick of all them tv shows  
I need some dirt road under my feet  
C'mon let's point our toes where the red fern grows  
Take a little walk in the country with me  
Come on now  
  
[Repeat Chorus]  
  
Walkin' the country  
Oh bless my soul  
Just gimme that country road  
Come on now  
  
[Repeat Chorus]  
  
Take a little walk in the country with me  
Come on now baby  
Take a little walk in the country with me
