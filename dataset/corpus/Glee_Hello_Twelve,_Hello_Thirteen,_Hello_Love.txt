Hello twelve, hello thirteen, hello love.  
Changes, oooh  
Down below up above.  
Time to doubt  
  
To break out, it's a mess,  
It's a mess.  
Time to grow, time to go  
Hello, hello  
  
Too young to take over,  
Too old to ignore,  
Gee, I'm almost ready,  
But... What... For?  
  
There's a lot I am not certain of.  
Hello twelve, hello thirteen, hello love  
(Lalalala)  
  
Goodbye twelve, goodbye thirteen.  
Hello love  
Robert Goulet, Robert Goulet, My God, Robert Goulet!  
Oh! Down below, up above...  
Playing doctor with Evelyn.  
La la la  
I'll show you mine,  
La la  
You show me yours  
La la  
Seeing Daddy's naked  
Time to grow.  
Time to go...  
La la la  
Mom and Dad were doing it.  
There's a lot, I am not certain of  
Hello twelve, hello thirteen, hello love  
Hello twelve, hello thirteen, hello love
