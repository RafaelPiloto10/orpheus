Got a soul poem, and it goes like this  
  
Somewhere the time was right  
Could have been gone in ten  
This world is hard to fight  
Hitting you once  
  
Hit it again  
To know the way it feels  
Everyone gets knocked down  
When you get up it's real  
  
By taking it back  
Turn it around  
  
[Chorus]  
Get on it, up on it  
Get on it - wouldn't want to be you  
Get on it, out on it  
Get on it - no one's gonna free you  
You know, when you're keeping it slow  
No matter where you want to go - wouldn't want to be you  
Get on it, up on it  
It's on - we're living in chaos  
  
Somewhere along the line  
Things get chipped away  
This place keeps going down  
Gets a little worse every day  
I see hate and greed  
This world's a messed up town  
Embrace the pain and see  
By taking it back  
You turn it around  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Fall-ing... falling [Repeat: x 2]  
(Ya, ya, ya) [Repeat: x 4]  
  
Got a soul poem and it goes like this  
  
repeat 1st verse  
  
Fall-ing...falling [Repeat: x 2]  
  
(ya, ya, ya)  
Get on it, up on it  
Get on it - (ya, ya, ya)  
Get on it, up on it  
Get on it - no one's gonna free you  
Get on it, up on it  
Get on it - (ya, ya, ya)
