It feels better now I got time out of the way  
It feels better now you said it would someday  
Like miles behind a runner I watch the passing summers  
Take the hurt away oh it's good to say it feels better now  
It feels better now my friends forgot your name  
It feels better now they think I've done the same  
Circumstance protects us from things that will not let us  
Get a goodnight sleep I seldom weep it feels better now  
It feels better now I learned to smile again  
It feels better now I've got some super friends  
The ticks and tocks of passing time that were like hammers in my mind  
Have built a wall that hides it all it feels better now
