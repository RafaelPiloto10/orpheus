I've known bad women  
I've had bad wine  
I've had nights filled with bad dreams  
Tasted bad food and bad water  
And I've read about bad rain  
  
Yeah, I only know of one thing  
With an ironclad guarantee  
'Cause I ain't never seen no bad love  
Never heard about no bad love  
I've never really seen no bad love  
Well, no bad love well, no bad love  
  
You know how I love music  
As long as it ain't square  
To be bad music is don't move  
Too smooth, no groove happening there  
  
I've known a few bad ladies  
All of them got me hurt  
Some of them women that seemed sweet  
Complete, they treat you like dirt  
  
[Chorus:]  
But I ain't never seen no bad love  
Never heard about no bad love  
I never really seen no bad love  
No bad love, no bad love  
  
I've seen a lot of bad movies  
I saw one just last night  
Ain't got no action, and it ain't got no plot  
That's not what I like  
  
You can even get a bad education  
But that won't get you nowhere  
But somebody's gonna say  
That school ain't cool  
What fool wants to go there  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
I've had bad days and had bad nights  
But I never had me no bad love  
And a Cadillac Fleetwood with a bad ride  
But I never had me no bad love  
I've had bad things happen to me all my life  
But I never had me no bad love  
  
Whew, whew, whew, whew, whew, whew, hoo  
But I never had me no bad love  
Had a Cadillac car
