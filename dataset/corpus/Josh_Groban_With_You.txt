Sometimes I remember reasons I let you go  
Inside them I see your face and all I really know  
I was scared to share the love I have inside of me  
Through all the heartache I know that I was meant to be...  
With you  
I have everything I've ever wanted  
Simple and true  
With you  
Crying eyes so beautiful  
It's you who always thought our love would see us through  
If I could follow my heart again it would be yours  
With every breath I would find a way to love you more  
I can't imagine life without your silent bravery  
And I'm grateful for every moment that I get to be...  
With you  
I have everything I've ever wanted  
Simple and true  
With you  
Loving eyes so beautiful  
It's you who always finds a way  
And if the stars should disappear  
In the dark I'll still be here  
Forever in your arms where I belong  
With you  
I have everything I've ever wanted  
Simple and true  
With you  
Loving eyes so beautiful  
It's you who always knew our love would see us through  
With you
