Don't you know I got to find me a home  
Right now in your heart  
  
I'll travel over miles and down the highways, babe  
Through the valleys every byway  
Just to find me a home right now in your heart  
  
I'll bring you to the music, refueling  
Everything you want to  
Everything you need babe  
Just to have me a home right now in your heart  
  
Baby I'll travel for you over miles and  
Through the valley babe  
Down all the highways  
Through the valleys honey  
Just to find me a home right now in your heart  
  
I gotta, gotta, gotta have it baby  
Gotta find me a home  
I've got to have a big beautiful home  
Somewhere in your heart
