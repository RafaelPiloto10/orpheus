Come and listen to my story if you will I'm gonna tell  
About a gang of fellers from down at Nashville

We can't forget Hank Williams with them good old "Lovesick Blues"  
It's time for Roy Acuff to go to Memphis on his train  
With Minnie Pearl and Rod Brasfield and Lazy Jim Day  
Turn on all your radios I know that you will wait  
Hear Little Jimmy Dickens sing "Take An Old Cold Tater And Wait"  
There'll be guitars and fiddles, Earl Scruggs and his banjo too  
Bill Monroe singing out them ole Kentucky Blues  
Ernest Tubb's number "Two wrongs won't make a right"  
At the Grand Ole Opry ev'ry Saturday night  
There was Uncle Dave Macon his gold tooth and plug-hat

You can talk about your singers in all kinds of way  
But none could sing the old songs like Bradley Kincaid  
With his old hound dog "Guitar" and the famous "Blue Tail Fly"

There'll be guitars and fiddles, Earl Scruggs and his banjo too
