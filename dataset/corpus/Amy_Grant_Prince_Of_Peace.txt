Sometimes my life just don't make sense at all  
And the mountains look so big, and my faith just seems so small  
So hold me, Jesus, I'm shakin' like a leaf  
You have been king of my glory, won't you be my prince of peace?  
  
And I wake up in the night, and feel the dark  
It's so hot inside my soul, there must be blisters on my heart  
So hold me, Jesus, I'm shakin' like a leaf  
You have been king of my glory, won't you be my prince of peace?  
  
Surrender don't come natural to me  
I'd rather fight you for somethin' I don't really want than take what you've  
Given me  
And I've beat my head against so many walls, I'm fallin' down, I'm fallin' on  
My knees  
  
And the Salvation Army band is playing this hymn  
And your grace rings out so deep, it makes my resistence seem so thin  
Oh, hold me, Jesus, I'm shakin' like a leaf  
You have been king of my glory, won't you be my prince of peace?  
  
Oh, hold me, Jesus, I'm shakin' like a leaf  
You have been king of my glory, won't you be my prince of peace?
