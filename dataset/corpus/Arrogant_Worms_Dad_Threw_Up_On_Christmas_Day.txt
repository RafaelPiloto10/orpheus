Dad threw up on Christmas Day  
He puked on the serving tray  
The stuffing's come right out of Daddy dear  
Now everybody's Christmas vacation  
Will be filled with a viral infection  
Maybe we'll all be better by next year  
We felt more than a breeze  
When Daddy had to sneeze  
It didn't sound a lot like Ah-Choo  
Mom was saying grace  
When Daddy barked on her face  
So Mom asked God to bless the vomit too  
Dad threw up on Christmas Day  
He got some chunks on Uncle Ray  
Who kept on talking about his pancreas  
We'll all remember Christmas Eve  
As the last time we were free of disease  
And able to digest some solid food
