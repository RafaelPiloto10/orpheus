FLOWERS FOR MAMA  
WRITERS EDDIE NOACK, CINDY WALKER, AL RUMLEY  
Papa brought flowers for mama today  
And all the grown children, but it's not mother's day  
I don't have no money, not even a dime  
But I brought mama flowers like I have all the time.  
Everyday I pick flowers from this pretty hill  
A small box of Daisies and a few Daffodils  
I bring them to mama at the end of the day  
And say flowers for mama, here's mama's bouquet.  
They brighten her face and she holds me close  
She'd say they are more precious than a beautiful rose  
And she wore a smile sweeter than millions of flowers  
A smile that I'll carry through life's darkest hours.  
Spoken:  
Now mama was lying there, yes, they tell me she passed away  
And she was surrounded by flowers that out-shined my bouquet  
I know mine aren't fancy but still all the while  
They were placed in her hand and I know I saw mama smile.  
Sang:  
Flowers for mama I picked them today  
Not very much, just a simple bouquet  
Mom wasn't so fancy but up there above  
She's the prettiest flower in God's garden of love.
