Oh oh oh oh ooh  
I saw a red Camaro today  
It turned my head around it made me think  
About back when my life was a game  
And we played it all night long just like  
Our favorite song. Summers just around the bend  
Summers just around the bend.  
  
Turn up the music loud  
Take the T top down  
And let the chrome shine  
Cruise along the river side  
Feel the wind blow  
Through your hair through your toes  
Got your bare feet hanging out the window  
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh  
  
I saw a red Camaro today  
And I did a double take  
I thought I saw her face  
We were so reckless and young  
And it all comes back to me  
In storm wash memories  
Summers just around the bend  
Summers just around the bend  
  
Turn up the music loud  
Take the T top down  
And let the chrome shine  
Cruise along the river side  
Feel the wind blow  
Through your hair through your toes  
Got your bare feet hanging out the window  
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh  
  
Looking back looking back  
Sweet wine and sunshine  
Looking back looking back  
Man those were some good times  
Oh oh oh oh  
Everybody sing  
Oh oh oh  
1, 2, 3, 4  
  
Turn up the music loud  
Take the T top down  
And let the chrome shine  
Cruise along the river side  
Feel the wind blow  
Through your hair through your toes  
Got your bare feet hanging out the window  
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh  
  
Turn up the music loud  
Turn up the music loud
