[Intro]  
Oh no, no, no, no, no  
No, whoa  
I still love you baby  
You know, you know  
  
[Chorus]  
You didn't see me  
But I saw you  
You didn't see me  
But I saw you  
  
I can remember those nights and days again  
Sometimes I cry for what might have been, babe  
You say you love me but how do you know  
If I didn't leave you then where did you go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Whatever's going on inside your mind  
Think about us, think about us and give us some more time  
And there's so much more I'm leaving unsaid, babe  
'Cause there's that little voice inside of your head  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're all about yourself  
You can't see nobody else  
You're all about yourself  
You can't see nobody else  
You're all about yourself  
You can't see nobody else  
You're all about yourself  
You can't see nobody else  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
You're so into yourself babe, oh yes  
Ah can't see nobody, nobody else  
But I saw you baby  
'Cause it's all about you girl, oh yeah
