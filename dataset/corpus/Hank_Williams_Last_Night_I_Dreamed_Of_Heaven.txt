Last night I dreamed of Heaven and I saw my mother there  
Standing with all the angels on a golden stair  
I thought I heard her whisper welcome home my boy  
Last night I dreamed of Heaven and it filled my heart with joy  
I heard the angels singing songs of peace and rest  
And then there was a silence, each eye looked toward the west  
There sat my Saviour on His golden throne  
Last night I dreamed of Heaven, my eternal home sweet home  
Last night I dreamed of Heaven that land so pure and sweet  
And the joy within me made my glad heart weep  
I was there with my Saviour free from grief and strife  
Last night I dreamed of Heaven, the land of eternal life
