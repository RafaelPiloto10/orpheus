Over here i'll damage them  
Before they damage me.  
Over here commit them all  
They'll never be believed.  
  
No right for justice  
No right for peace.  
No right for justice  
No right for peace.  
  
Over here, we're standing clear  
My voice gives me away.  
Over here, we're running wild  
Whatever games we play.  
  
No time for justice  
No time for peace.  
No time for justice  
No time for peace.  
  
Get a message out for me  
I'll tell them all they want to know.  
If i can just be free.  
I'll leave this place, go far away,  
They'll never hear from me again.  
I'll cause no trouble, feel no pain.  
  
Over here it's hide and seek  
Get on the midnight train.  
Over here they'll lock you up  
And call you filthy names.  
  
No right for justice  
No right for peace.  
No right for justice  
No right for peace.  
  
No time for justice  
No time for peace.  
No time for justice  
No time for peace.  
  
Over here  
  
Over here  
No time for justice  
Over here  
No time for peace  
  
Over here  
No time for justice  
Over here  
No time for peace  
  
Over here  
No time for justice  
Over here  
No time for peace  
  
Over here  
No time for justice  
Over here  
No time for peace  
  
Over here  
No time for justice  
Over here  
No time for peace  
  
Over here  
No time for justice  
Over here  
No time for peace  
  
Over here.
