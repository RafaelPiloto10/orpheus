I'm not insane, I'm not bummed out  
I got no one to blame, nothing to change  
I got no evil to fight  
  
One thing's for sure, I'm all outta angst  
Society don't bother me  
And there's something wrong with that  
  
So I'm off to Pakistan, learn the laws of Islam  
Fundamentalism, forget that rock-n-roll  
No cigarette, no drink, in fact  
It's difficult to think about getting laid  
When you don't even get to see her face  
I'm not insane  
  
I'm not insane, I'm not liquored  
I got nothin' to do, nothin' to lose  
I got no place to call home  
One thing's for sure, I'm all outta angst  
Society don't bother me, there's something wrong with that  
  
Next stop Mongolia  
Don't get to golf or fuck or bowl with 'ya  
Throw out that handicap  
No stepping out, till spring, in fact it's  
Difficult to sing when it's 20 below  
And that's during the day  
I'm not insane
