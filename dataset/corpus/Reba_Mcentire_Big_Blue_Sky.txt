  
Come On baby, take a look outside, it's a big blue sky  
  
We didn't listen when they tried to tell us we were to young to know  
They tried to slow us down but, we always found another way to go.  
Before you know it we were waving goodbye, driving away  
off into the big blue sky  
We went out lookin for the best jobs kids like us could get  
We got hired and fired, and worn out tired but we never quit.  
To dumb to worry or wonder why  
we were chasing our lives off into the big blue sky.  
  
Chorus  
I guess we were just  
nothin but a big blue sky  
  
We've had earthquakes, twisters, hurricanes, tidlewaves and hail down n our
heads  
We've been knocke down, sucked in  
spun round, shaken up, thrown away  
and left for dead  
but somehow we always made it out alive  
on the other side of the Big Blue Sky  
  
Chorus  
Maybe we were just crazy enough  
to try and out run the rain  
The storms we've been through just proved that we can make it through
anything.  
you'll never see how good it can be  
until you spread your wings and fly  
baby take look at our lives it's nothing but a  
Big Blue Sky  
  
It's nothin but a big blue sky  
  
Baby lookin back  
everthing they said  
Like how we wouldn't last how far we'd never get,  
It's a great big lie  
ain't nothin over head  
nothin but a big blue sky  
  
Chorus  
Maybe we were just crazy enough  
to try and out run the rain  
The storms we've been through just proved that we can make it through
anything.  
you'll never see how good it can be  
until you spread your wings and fly  
baby look at our lives  
Take a look at our lives  
Yeah look at our lives  
It's nothin but a Big blue Sky  
  
Nothin but a big blue sky  
  
It's a big blue sky
