You're my little saviour  
You're the one I sleep with at night  
You take me in and promise me I'll be alright  
You're my little angel down from the heaven above  
I can't ask for much anymore,  
But you still smile and give me your love  
So if you fall asleep tomorrow,  
Then I know we can make it through this night  
But if you fall asleep as I hold you tight,  
You'll have moved on,  
Your love will be gone  
  
You're my little saviour,  
Hold me close and stare up into the stars  
Let me know if you think that there's someone up there  
Who still believes in us  
After I've lost all their trust,  
Just need someone to believe us  
So please just fall asleep tomorrow,  
'Cause sugar I know we can make it through the night  
Cause if you fall asleep as I hold you tight  
You'll have moved on, your love will be gone  
You were my little saviour,  
I was supposed to hold you through the night  
But I guess I let you down inside...  
You're my little saviour  
I loved you
