I know why you're lonely  
And I know why you're blue  
You're lonesome to see him  
And you long to see her too  
We're not in love with each other  
We're in love with our best friends  
So let's invite them over again  
We've talked it over and over  
And we know it's not right  
We should stay away forever  
But we're lonesome each night  
Yes we stay away for a while  
But we know in the end  
We'll invite them over again  
We've talked it over and over  
And we know it's not right  
We should stay away forever  
But we're lonesome each night  
Yes we stay away for a while  
But we know in the end  
We'll invite them over again  
Let's invite them over again
