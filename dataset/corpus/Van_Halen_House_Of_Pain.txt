Say you're gonna leave me cause I only tie you up.  
Always love you tender but you only like it rough.  
(???) why you're leaving me again.  
Gonna pack your bags and leave this house of pain.  
Heartaches all around me, how many times we cried.  
Said she tried to leave me but her hands were always tied.  
If I had it all to do I'd do it just the same.  
Gonna fix it so you never leave this house of pain
