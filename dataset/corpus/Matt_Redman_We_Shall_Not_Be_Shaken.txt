When everything is breaking  
You are left unshaken  
When everything is tumbling down  
You are the solid ground  
  
The nations could be quaking  
The economy is failing  
But fear is found all around  
You are the solid ground  
  
Oh God you are,  
All that you say you are  
You never change, you never failed, you'll never fail  
Oh God you are  
Faithful in all your ways  
Forever You stand, forever You reign, forever remain  
We shall not be shaken  
  
We shall, We shall not be shaken  
We shall, We shall not be shaken  
When all around is sinking sand  
  
For you are, you are never changing  
You are, you are never changing  
You stand, the Great I am  
  
The Great I am
