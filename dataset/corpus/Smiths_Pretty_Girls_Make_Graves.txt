Upon the sand, upon the bay  
"There is a quick and easy way" you say  
Before you illustrate  
I'd rather state :  
"I'm not the man you think I am  
I'm not the man you think I am"  
  
And sorrow's native son  
He will not smile for anyone  
  
And pretty girls make graves  
Oh...  
  
End of the pier, end of the bay  
You tug my arm, and say : "give in to lust,  
Give up to lust, oh heaven knows we'll  
Soon be dust... "  
  
Oh, I'm not the man you think I am  
I'm not the man you think I am  
  
And sorrow's native son  
He will not rise for anyone  
  
And pretty girls make graves  
Oh really ?  
Oh...  
  
I could have been wild and I could have  
Been free  
But nature played this trick on me  
  
She wants it now  
And she will not wait  
But she's too rough  
And I'm too delicate  
  
Then, on the sand  
Another man, he takes her hand  
A smile lights up her stupid face  
(and well, it would)  
  
I lost my faith in womanhood  
I lost my faith in womanhood  
I lost my faith...  
Oh...  
  
Hand in glove...  
The sun shines out of our behinds...  
Oh...
