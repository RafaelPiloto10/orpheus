Liquor market  
Lots of flats  
Another 24-hour chemist  
Self-Serve gas  
I said all these things  
Serve me well  
I said all these things  
Serve me well, yeah  
  
It's hypnotizing  
It sends me to sleep  
No one talks to anyone else  
It's frightening  
Everybody's minds are blank  
Oh - oh hypnotizing  
  
I'm always using you  
When I'm out of cash  
I stare through this window  
On a bus, moving fast  
I said all these things  
Serve me well  
I said all these things  
Serve me well - yeah
