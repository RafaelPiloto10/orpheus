I just dropped in, cause I could use a friend  
And a little bit of consolation  
I'm hanging by a thread from the southern end of my rope  
If you really want to know I'll do my best to explain my situation  
Maybe I can find the words  
If the tears don't get me first  
  
[Chorus]  
It's kinda like fallin' from the sky  
When you're up a mile high  
And your parachute won't open  
Kinda like clingin' to the bottom of the bottom  
When the bottom drops out  
The only way I know to say how bad her leaving hurts  
It's kinda like a heartache, only worse  
  
It wasn't my first brush with love  
But this one was the deepest  
Yeah, I've been blue but this time it's closer to black  
Swore I'd never get hurt again  
But here I am in pieces  
When this was broke my heart that was just the start  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's kinda like being cut open  
Kinda like being burned at the stake  
Kinda like drownin' in the ocean knowin'  
Knowin' there's no help on the way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Only worse
