A distant night bird mocks the sun.  
I wake as I have always done,  
To freshly scented sycamore  
And cold bare feet on hardwood floor.  
My steaming coffee warms my face  
I'm disappointed in the taste.  
But there's a peace the early brings  
The morning world of growing things.  
  
I feel the moments hurry on  
It was today, it's died away,  
And now it is forever gone.  
And I will drink my coffee slow  
And I will watch my shadow grow  
And disappear in firelight  
And sleep alone again tonight.
