Maitre charcot he can send you where the winds blow  
Look in his eye and your mind goes into limbo  
They say, he's mad as a hatter  
He's no medicine man  
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go  
  
Maitre charcot he can teach you what you don't know  
Look in his eye and the clock runs out of tempo  
He knows, it's mind over matter  
You'll fit in the palm of his hand  
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go  
  
It doesn't need too much explaining  
It doesn't seem to be so hard  
You just count to ten and then back again  
And before long you won't know where you are  
  
Maitre charcot he will catch you if you let go  
Look in his eyes and your thoughts go into slow motion  
You glide, like birds of a feather  
He flies higher than you  
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go  
  
For any doubt you have remaining  
Let me remind you once again  
You just close you eyes as the eagle flies  
And before you know it you won't feel any pain, any pain  
  
I'd like to stay here forever, who needs the hullabaloo?  
Let yourself go, let yourself go, let yourself go
