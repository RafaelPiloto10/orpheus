I've had my share  
Of life's ups and downs  
But you've been good to me  
The downs have been few  
I guess some would say  
That I've been lucky  
Oh but I've got to say  
That it's all because of you  
  
[CHORUS:]  
If anyone should ever write  
My life's story  
For whatever reason there might be  
You'd be there  
Between each line of pain and glory  
'Cause you're the best thing  
That ever happened to me  
  
There have been times  
When times were hard  
But always somehow  
I made it through  
'Cause for every moment  
I spent hurting  
There was a moment  
I spent just loving you  
  
[CHORUS:]
