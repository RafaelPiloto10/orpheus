You said goodbye  
And broke this heart inside of me  
Teardrops fell  
Like hours to eternity  
The room was silent  
As some forgotten melody  
Your words of steel  
Still echo in my memory  
  
Promises made, promises broken  
Promises made, promises broken  
  
I thought we had a chance  
To really make it last  
Now the future looks to me  
Like some unwelcome guest  
I'll be alright  
As soon as I get over you  
But this time it won't be  
Such an easy thing to do  
  
Promises made are  
Promises broken  
  
Caught up in the sorrow  
Tangled in dreams  
In the lonely hours  
Of silent screams  
In the heart of the darkness  
I break down  
I feel the spirit of you  
All around  
  
Promises made are  
Promises broken  
Promises made are  
Promises broken
