Well, I'm gonna get up in the morning  
Hit the highway 49  
I'm gonna get up in the morning

I've been looking for my woman  
Lord, don't think she can't be found  
Melvina my woman  
She out on the highway 49  
  
Melvina my woman  
She out on the highway 49

Roll on down the line  
  
I believe, I believe, I believe I'll dust my bed  
I believe, I believe, I believe I'll dust my bed  
  
Out on the highway 49  
I have walked till I am dead  
I got the blues this morning  
Rollin' into Jackson town  
  
I got the blues this morning

Long tall momma, She don't pay me no mind  
Yeah, long tall momma, She don't pay me no mind  
All she wanna do  
Walk the highway 49
