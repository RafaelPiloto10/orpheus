Don't they know we're so afraid,  
Isolation.  
We're afraid to be alone  
Everbody's got to have a home  
Isolation.  
  
Just a boy and a little girl  
Trying to change the whole wide world,  
Isolation.  
The world is just a little town  
Everybody trying to put us down,  
Isolation.  
  
I don't expect you to understand  
After you caused so much pain  
But then again you're not to blame  
You're just a human, a victim of the insane.  
  
We're afraid of everyone  
Afraid of the sun,  
Isolation.  
The sun will never disappear  
But the world may not have many years,  
Isolation
