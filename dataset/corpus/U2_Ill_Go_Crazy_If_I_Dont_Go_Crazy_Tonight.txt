She's a rainbow and she loves the peaceful life  
Knows I'll go crazy if I don't go crazy tonight  
  
There's a part of me in chaos that's quiet  
And there's a part of you that wants me to riot  
Everybody needs to cry or needs to spit  
Every sweet-tooth needs just a little hit  
Every beauty needs to go out with an idiot  
How can you stand next to the truth and not see it?  
Change of heart comes slow  
  
It's not a hill it's a mountain  
As you start out the climb  
Do you believe me or are you doubting?  
We're gonna make it all the way to the light  
But I know I'll go crazy if I don't go crazy tonight  
  
Every generation gets a chance to change the world  
Pity the nation that won't listen to your boys and girls  
Is the sweetest melody the one we haven't heard?  
Is it true that perfect love drives out all fear?  
The right to be ridiculous is something I hold dear  
But change of heart comes slow  
  
It's not a hill it's a mountain  
As you start out the climb  
You see for me I've been shouting  
But we're gonna make it all the way to the light  
But I know I'll go crazy if I don't go crazy tonight  
  
Baby, baby, baby, I know I'm not alone  
Baby, baby, baby, I know I'm not alone  
Ha, ha, ha  
  
It's not a hill it's a mountain  
You see for me I've been shouting  
Let's shout until the darkness, squeeze out sparks of light  
You know we'll go crazy  
You know we'll go crazy  
You know we'll go crazy, if we don't go crazy tonight
