Damn this traffic jam,  
How I hate to be late,  
It hurts my motor to go so slow.  
Damn this traffic jam,  
Time I get home my supper'll be cold,  
Damn this traffic jam.  
  
Well I left my job  
About five o'clock,  
It took fifteen minutes  
To go three blocks,  
Just in time  
To stand in line  
With a freeway looking  
Like a parking lot.  
Damn this traffic jam,  
How I hate to be late,  
It hurts my motor to go so slow.  
Damn this traffic jam,  
Time I get home my supper'll be cold,  
Damn this traffic jam.  
  
Now I almost had  
A heart attack,  
Looking in my rear view mirror,  
I saw myself  
The next car back,  
Looking in the rear view mirror,  
About to have  
A heart attack, I said,  
Damn this traffic jam,  
How I hate to be late,  
It hurts my motor to go so slow.  
Damn this traffic jam,  
Time I get home my supper'll be cold,  
Damn this traffic jam.  
  
Now when I die  
I don't want no coffin,  
I thought about it  
All too often.  
Just strap me in  
Behind the wheel  
And bury me with  
My automobile.  
Damn this traffic jam,  
How I hate to be late,  
It hurts my motor to go so slow.  
Damn this traffic jam,  
Time I get home my supper'll be cold,  
Damn this traffic jam.  
Damn.  
  
Now I used to think  
That I was cool  
Running around  
On fossil fuel,  
Until I saw  
What I was doing  
Was driving down  
The road to ruin.
