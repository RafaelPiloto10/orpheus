Your pentagram is down below our floor.  
Your naked body shimmers in the night.  
Dancing and chanting in a sacrificial rite.  
Your feet are dry with the ashes from dead babies  
Who have passed the test just like all the rest  
But never really understood the reasons why  
They took it in the first place.  
Ah in the first place.  
Your feisty eyes won't make me fall apart.  
Your turquoise and silver won't weaken this old heart.  
Yeah, dancing and chanting in a sacrificial rite.  
I fell to the ground on a windy, windy night.  
Well I have passed the test just like all the rest,  
But never really understood the reasons why  
I took it in the first place.  
Ah, in the first place.  
Well I have passed the test just like all the rest,  
But never really understood the reasons why  
I took it in the first place.  
Ah, in the first place.
