As I look him deep in the eyes  
I see only darkness  
I must have knocked him out good  
I kind of like that  
I must go  
  
Up Up Up from the grave  
Up Up Up from the grave  
Up Up Up from the grave  
Up Up Up from the grave  
  
Here we go again my friend,  
deep into my twisted brain  
I think I'm losing it again  
  
La-La-La  
I'm digging for Lucy dear  
La-La-La  
I've had it up to here  
  
Lucy Lucy I am here, Lucy Lucy don't you fear  
I will get you out of there, so you can breathe again  
You can't sleep forever dear  
Come to daddy  
  
Up Up Up from the grave  
Up Up Up from the grave  
Up Up Up from the grave  
Up Up Up from the grave  
  
Here we go again my friend,  
deep into my twisted brain  
I think I'm losing it again  
  
La-La-La  
Tell me what you see  
La-La-La  
Tell me how it makes you feel  
  
When I sing so nicely to you Lu-you-cy
