Baby when i think about you  
I think about love  
Darlin' don't live without you  
And you love  
  
If i had these golden dreams  
Of my yesterdays  
I would wrap you in heaven  
'Till I'm dying on the way  
  
Feel like makin love  
Feel like makin love to you  
Baby if i think about you  
I think about love  
  
Darlin if i live without you  
I live without love  
  
If i had the sun and the moon  
I would give you both night and day  
Of satisfyin  
  
Feel like makin  
Feel like makin love  
Feel like making love to you  
  
And if i had those golden dreams  
Of my yesterdays  
I would wrap you in heaven  
Till I'm dyin on the way  
  
Feel like makin love  
Feel like makin love  
Feel like makin love to you
