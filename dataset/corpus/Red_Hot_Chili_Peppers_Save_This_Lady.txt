I got more love than anything else  
But a Jezebel spirit gonna steal my health  
Struck by the notion that it just might be  
A method to the madness that I cannot see  
Something for the freedom of a roughed-up soul  
For the two Years Young is a little bit old  
Born named sue sing a Tennessee tune  
Got buffalo love living on the moon  
Save this lady for me (x4)  
Call me Alabama I'm a Seminole prize  
Got time square hair and a bedroom eyes  
Keystone cops and the billy bob chops  
Gonna scare my kids gonna share my crops  
Vampire blood and a baseball glove  
Justa a little bit of what the girl is made of  
National crash into the big lampoon  
With a creature coming up from the black lagoon  
Save this lady for me (x4)  
Losing ground true sounds of liberty  
The forest of the north might hold the key  
Rocking to the rhythm of a ragtime band  
Black flag wave on on my truck my man  
Blasting for jones and the great unknowns  
Got cheap cologne seventy-six trombones  
Looking for the lady that won't be afraid  
When heaven needs a hammer gotta get things made  
I got more love than anything else  
But a Jezebel spirit gonna steal my health  
Save this lady for me (x8)
