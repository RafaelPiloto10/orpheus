Intro after 8  
  
I was born, long ago  
I am the chosen, I'm the one  
I have come, to save the day  
And I won't leave until I'm done  
  
So that's why, you've got to try  
You got to breath and have some fun  
Though I'm not paid, I play this game  
And I won't stop until I'm done  
  
But what I really want to know is  
Are you gonna go my way?  
And I got to got to know  
  
I don't know why, we always cry  
This we must leave and get undone  
We must engage, and rearrange  
And turn this planet back to one  
  
So tell me why, we got to die  
And kill each other one by one  
We've got to love, and rub-a-dub  
We've got to dance and be in love  
  
But what I really want to know is  
Are you gonna go my way?  
And I got to got to know  
  
Solo after solo on after nine with pause then  
  
Are you gonna go my way?  
'Cause baby I got to know "talk"  
Yeah
