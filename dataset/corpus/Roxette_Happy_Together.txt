When she walked up  
He walked down  
Just like the seasons went round and round  
She was in love  
He wasn't sure  
She wrote some letters he tried to ignore  
  
They could have been  
So happy together  
They could have been  
So lucky in love  
Sing la dee da  
So happy together  
  
They could have run the earth, the sky, the sun  
She carried his ring  
Since she left school  
He knew she was precious  
The prettiest jewel  
She wanted a baby  
But he wasn't sure  
He couldn't make up his mind anymore  
  
They could have been  
So happy together  
They could have been  
So lucky in love  
Sing la dee da  
So happy together  
  
They could have run the earth, the stars, the sun  
I couldn't ever hurt no one  
If you feel shattered  
I'm sorry for what I've done  
We could have been  
So happy together  
  
We could have been  
So lucky in love  
Sing la dee da  
So happy together  
We could have run the earth, the sky , the sun  
Yeah we could have been  
So happy together  
  
We could have been  
So lucky in love  
So happy together  
We could have run the universe  
Could have run the universe  
Could have run the universe  
For fun  
So happy together  
So happy together  
So happy together
