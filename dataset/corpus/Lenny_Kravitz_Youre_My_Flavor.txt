The way you love me  
Is like a needle in my vein  
When you're not around me  
You know it just don't feel the same  
  
And I've waited a long time  
Just to feel the way I do  
Just give me the reason  
And I will be all over you  
  
'Cause you're my flavor of love  
You're my flavor I'm dreaming of  
You're my flavor of love  
You're my flavor I'm dreaming of  
  
The way you touch me  
Somehow it takes away the pain  
And now I'm a junkie  
I'm running around without a brain  
  
I got the jones deep inside me  
And you are what I want to do  
You give me this feeling  
You always make me feel brand new  
  
'Cause you're my flavor of love  
You're my flavor I'm dreaming of  
You're my flavor of love  
You're my flavor I'm dreaming of  
  
Flavor... Ouh come on  
'Cause you're my flavor I'm dreaming of  
You're my flavor of love  
You're my flavor I'm dreaming of  
  
'Cause you're my flavor  
You're my flavor I'm dreaming of  
Yeah yeah yeah
