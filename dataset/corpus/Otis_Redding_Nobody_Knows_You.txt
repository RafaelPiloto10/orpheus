( Cox )  
  
Once i lived the life of millionaire  
People spending my money, honey  
Lord, and i just didn't care, now lord  
Takin' my friend out  
Tryin' to have a good time  
They drank that strong bootleg liquor  
And that good old champagne and wine  
  
Well, just as soon as my money got so low  
I couldn't find my friends, lord  
And i just didn't have no place to go  
Now, no no  
But if i ever, and if i ever get my hands  
On them green dollars again, yeah  
I'm gonna hold on  
Till that big eagle grin, lord now  
  
I'm trying to tell y'all  
That nobody wants you  
People, nobody wants you, no  
When you're down and out, now now lord  
Because in your pocket, no  
There is not one penny  
And all of them so-called friends  
I'm trying to tell, y'all  
That you haven't got any  
  
But, yeah, and just as soon  
As you get back on your feet again  
People, i'm tryin' to tell you  
That here they come  
Tellin' you all  
They're your long lost friend  
Oh but i'm tryin' to tell everybody  
Lord, without a doubt  
That nobody wants you  
Nobody wants you, no no  
Nobody wants you, no  
Nobody needs tou, nobody wants you  
When you're down and out, lord  
And nobody says a good thing about you  
And nobody can tell you when to turn  
And when to go...
