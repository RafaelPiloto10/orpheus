If there are any words  
That we haven't said  
Let us say them  
I know all too well  
How people's lies  
Betray them  
  
More than ever  
I'll wait for you there  
More than ever  
I will need you to care  
And I'll never need  
More than a prayer  
To be near you  
To be near you  
  
Time is a baby child  
Found in the rain born of fever  
She'll bring you pretty songs  
Laced through with lies  
But don't you believe her  
  
More than ever  
I'll wait for you there  
More than ever  
I will need you to care  
And I'll never need  
More than a prayer  
To be near you  
To be near you  
To be near you
