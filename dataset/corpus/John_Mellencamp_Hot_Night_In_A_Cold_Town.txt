Written by Geoffrey Cushing-Murray and Richard Littlefield  
  
Sonny's out strolling, ambling slowly  
Washed in amber street lights  
A Mexican wind blows in  
Takin' ahold of Angelina's hair and her halo  
Motors runnin' muffling the sound  
Of street talk, a big deal's goin' down  
  
Chorus:  
It's another hot night  
In a cold town  
Got yourself a hot night  
In a cold town  
  
Johnny's got spare change in his pocket  
And a ring and a watch to hock for a sweet ride  
A one way ticket hidden in his shoe  
These last few hours  
He says he'll spend with you  
He's leavin' home without a trace  
No forwarding address he'll never have to face another...  
  
Chorus  
  
Well the losers and the groovers  
And the corner boys are hangin' 'round  
Runnin' in and out of doorways  
Up and down the stairs  
Stray dogs headed for the pound  
  
Chorus
