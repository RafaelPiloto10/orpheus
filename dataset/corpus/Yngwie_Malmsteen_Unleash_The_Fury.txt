Once upon a time.  
So many centuries ago.  
The blind would lead the blind.  
To sell their souls.  
To be worshiping the dark.  
And to burn for eternity.  
With sacrifice of blood.  
The fools will bleed.  
Unleash the fury.  
Free the beast.  
You must heed the story.  
Told by the priests.  
Ring the doomsday bells.  
Raising hell.  
For this world I sing.  
Oh so sad a requiem.  
Now there is nothing that can bring.  
Bring it back again.  
Unleash the fury.  
Free the beast.  
You must heed the story.  
Told by the priests.  
Ring the doomsday bells.  
Raising hell.  
[guitar solo]  
Unleash the fury.  
Free the beast.  
You must heed the story.  
Told by the priests.  
Ring the doomsday bells.  
Raising hell.  
[guitar solo]
