Strikes me as an animal  
And now gone kissing  
But soon be missing home  
And waving at waterfalls  
Too strong not to mention  
With tempting extensions unknown  
  
Oh, this time I really mean that  
A cracking coat where I dig that  
Oh, this time I want to keep it alone  
Oh, this time I really trust you  
But it can't belong to anyone  
And I'd be so sad if I lost it  
  
And the courage seekers  
Of the aborted logos  
Of declaration "no-go" are gone  
But I'll keep a light for 'em  
Hold down the fort for 'em  
And wear my maroon blazer all the time
