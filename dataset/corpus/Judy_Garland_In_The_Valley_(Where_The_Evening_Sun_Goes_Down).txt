When white clouds go sailin'  
To make my wedding gown,  
Then we'll go trailin'  
To the valley where the evening sun goes down.  
  
And hidden away in the gloamin'  
When leaves are turning brown,  
We'll end our roaming  
In the valley where the evening sun goes down.  
  
We'll build a home in our valley there,  
And watch it grow into a town  
And you can sit in your rockin' chair  
And watch the evening sun go down,  
The evening sun go down.
