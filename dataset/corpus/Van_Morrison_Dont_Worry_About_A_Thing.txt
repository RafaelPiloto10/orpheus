If this life is driving you to drink  
Sitting round what's the use what to think  
Well I've got some consolation  
Give it to you if I might  
You know I don't worry about a thing because  
Nothing's gonna turn out right  
  
Well this world's just one big troubled spot  
Some have plenty, some have not  
I've used to be troubled but  
I finally saw the light  
Now I don't worry about a thing because I know  
Nothing's gonna be alright  
  
You spend your time trying to be the big winner  
The minute you'll get fat somebody else will get thinner  
There's always somebody messing with dynamite  
You know I don't worry about a thing because I know  
Nothing's gonna turn out right
