Am I the only one that feels alone?  
Though all is home  
Emotions flow  
  
Am I the only one that hears the tears  
Run down my face?  
Would anybody recognize at all?  
  
'cause I know  
I'm so slow  
But I'm trying  
And I'm still dying to know  
Say you won't leave for the rest of my  
  
Life's the only thing that deals the pain  
Like pouring rain now  
Breeding hate  
  
And I don't want to do no wrong  
My God, it's been so long  
Please comfort me before I go insane  
  
'cause I know  
I'm so slow  
But I'm trying  
And I'm still dying to know  
Say you won't leave for the rest of my life  
  
I know  
I'm so slow  
But I'm trying  
And I'm still dying to know  
Say you won't leave for the rest of my life  
  
The rest of my life  
Na na na na na na  
  
She said  
  
I'm slow  
But I'm trying  
And I'm still dying to know  
Say you won't leave for the rest of my  
I can't have you leave for the rest of my  
Say you won't leave for the rest of my life
