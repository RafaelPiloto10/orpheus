One more promise soaked in rye whiskey  
One more word that bites the dust on some bar room floor  
I'm the man who travels 'round doing  
Hey, we don't talk about that  
I'll get the favor done for you  
No one will ever know  
  
Then I'll run to Mexico  
  
Cold as stone my eyes fall on another  
Just another name that's runnin' through my mind  
At your request I'll do whatever you require  
You give me the light, I supply the fire  
  
Then I'll burn for Mexico  
  
Pretty senorita, she lies to me  
Smiles sweetly in the morning when I wake up cold sweating  
'Cause some day I'll be in the sights  
  
One more call when someone finds a target  
Only guarded whispers never mentions names  
Money on the line will be just fine  
You'll never be involved  
And even if a clue shows you'll never know  
  
'Cause I'll be in Mexico
