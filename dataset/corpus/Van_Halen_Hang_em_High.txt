Somewhere, he lost it in a turn  
Now trouble seems to fit him like a glove  
First come, first served, he's serving it back  
He travels light, without a pack, without love  
He comes from nowhere and he turns on his own  
Late for the hanging, yes he's headed for the moon  
And hang 'em high  
  
Leather cross his thighs  
Blasting out the night, his cap hides his eyes  
One eye on the road, price upon his head  
One ear to the ground, he's listening to the dead  
  
He comes from nowhere and he turns on his own  
Late for the hanging, yes he's headed for the moon  
And hang 'em high  
  
Blind to himself, and he's laughing up his scheme  
Looking back in anger, the city is relieved  
Vision of light, child of the night passing by  
  
Blind to himself, he's laughing up his scheme  
Looking back in anger, the city is relieved  
A vision of light, child of the night passing by  
  
Leather cross his thigh  
Blasting out the night, his cap hides his eyes  
One eye on the road, price upon his head  
One ear to the ground, he's listening to the dead  
  
He comes from nowhere, and he turns on his own  
Late for the hanging, yes he's headed for the moon  
And hang 'em high
