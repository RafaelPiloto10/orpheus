Show me a promised land and I will go anywhere  
And if you ask me to take my time I'll wait for years  
I'll hold on though the whole world tells me I'm wrong  
Someday, someday  
But it seems so long  
  
Ask me to prove my love and I will do anything  
So if they turn off the light of the sun why should I care  
I'll hold on thought the whole world tells me I'm wrong  
Then in the morning as you leave me  
You touch my hand to show how much you care  
But just when I need you  
You won't be there  
  
I'll hold on but I need a shoulder to lean on  
Why if you love me must you leave me  
Why are you going anywhere  
Why must our love be something in the air  
Cause just when I need you  
You won't be there  
You won't be there
