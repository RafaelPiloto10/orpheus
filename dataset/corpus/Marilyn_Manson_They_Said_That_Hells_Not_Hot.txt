I kill myself in small amounts  
In each relationship it's not about love  
Just another funeral  
And just another girl left in tears  
  
And I'm waiting  
With the sound turned off, I'm waiting  
Like a glass balloon, I'm fading  
Into the void and then I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone  
  
They said that hell's not hot  
They said that hell's not hot  
  
I gave my soul to someone else  
She must have known that it was already sold  
But it was never about her  
It was about the hurt  
  
So, I'm waiting  
With the sound turned off, I'm waiting  
Like a glass balloon, I'm fading  
Into the void and then I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone  
  
I kill myself in small amounts  
In each relationship it's not about love  
Just another funeral  
And just another girl left in tears  
  
Waiting  
With the sound turned off, I'm waiting  
Like a glass balloon, I'm fading  
Into the void and then I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone  
  
Waiting  
Waiting  
I'm fading  
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone  
  
They said that hell's not hot  
They said that hell's not hot  
They said that hell's not hot  
They said that hell's not hot
