For even the most trusting soul  
This world can be a scary place  
So much that we can't control  
In every moment that we face  
When a thousand what ifs  
Whisper in our ears  
We remember who's we are  
And watch them disappear  
I wanna live with a fearless heart  
Courage that's coming from trust in God  
It's constantly guiding me though the road may seem dark  
I wanna live, wanna live with a fearless heart  
There are worries chasing everyone  
It's evident in times like these  
But I have found the confidence that comes  
From time I spend on my knees  
There's a truth I'm holding onto  
As these days unfold  
Greater is He, God is in you  
And hear it in the world  
I wanna live with a fearless heart  
Courage that's coming from trust in God  
It's constantly guiding me though the road may seem dark  
I wanna live, wanna live with a fearless heart  
He's my strength, He's my shelter  
He is with me all the way  
He's my light and my salvation  
Of whom shall I be afraid, of whom shall I be afraid?  
I wanna live with a fearless heart  
Courage that's coming from trust in God  
It's constantly guiding me though the road may seem dark, yeah  
I wanna live with a fearless heart  
Courage that's coming from trust in God  
It's constantly guiding me though the road is dark  
I wanna live, wanna live with a fearless heart  
With a fearless heart, with a fearless heart  
With a fearless heart
