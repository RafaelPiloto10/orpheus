The gates have opened  
Now I'm a free man  
My time is over  
I need a new plan  
But I've had no loving  
For a year and a day  
My lady's waiting  
Got a taste for her wine  
She's wearing money  
But none of it's mine  
She's been surviving  
While I've been wasting away  
  
[Chorus]  
Back in my room  
It ain't quite the same  
You can't hide it  
I'm onto your game  
  
Rough justice, there's no disguise  
And I can tell by  
The look in your eyes  
Rough justice, I've had my share  
I've done my time  
But I'm still running scared  
Rough justice  
Coming down on me  
Long arm of the law  
Never setting me free  
Rough justice, I bide my time  
  
Back in action, I'm riding the crest  
And putting all that  
I've learned to the test  
No complications  
Taking it day by day  
Freedom of movement  
Freedom of choice  
Free to be right back here  
With the boys  
Ready to listen  
But you've got nothing to say  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Rough justice
