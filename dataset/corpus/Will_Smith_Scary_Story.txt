Willow  
Daddy can you tell me a story?  
Will  
Oh you want to hear a story? What kind of story you want to hear baby?  
Willow  
A scary story  
[VERSE 1]  
Oh, ok  
Once upon a time there was a kid who wanted nothin' more than to rhyme  
Almost like he was born in the rhyme  
He thought of his rhymes almost all of the time  
And he fought with his mom  
His school getting caught with his rhyme book  
And he knew he shouldn't of took it there in the first place  
At least he shouldn't of been sittin lookin there in her face with it  
Teacher told him get it out of her class  
Wicked witch, trick told him that's probably why you won't pass  
Now if you shy you won't last but you're new  
So underneath his breath before he left he said I'm a be richer then you  
What you say? She said.  
What you mean? He said.  
Boy don't you play, she said.  
What you mean? He said. Damnit.  
Ten minutes later standin up in the principles office  
Getting handed the phone clammed up cause his father was talking  
And he was pissed he wasn't listening to his son.  
You testing me? You messin up again  
You done boy.  
[CHORUS]  
This is just a story about a young man comin up in the rap game  
A real scary story  
Went from rags to riches it has goblins in it haters and witches. Uh.  
  
[REPEAT CHORUS]  
  
[VERSE 2]  
First thing he did was find somebody to give him some money.  
He wasn't stupid but wasn't using his senses honey.  
The guy's he meant was a little shady, a little funny.  
But they gave him the money so they played the record company.  
It sounds silly but when he grew up in Philly rhymin wasn't what it is today  
Deals wasn't a dime a dozen  
Today every sister, uncle, or mom or cousin gotta record deal  
But for real it wasn't like that then.  
As you could imagine when he started risin to fame and fortune he was  
havin Started antagonizing the guy's he was with  
At the same time he started realizing  
The deal he got from them guys in his eyes didn't fly with size of his hits  
He called a meeting to find a solution.  
He said I'm gettin beat out of my loot  
And I'm not recording no more until we find a solution  
The dude's said we found a solution its this .44  
He ran for the door a little shaken  
But the next day he found a lawyer, told him the situation  
He said I'm breakin this contract for ya  
He said how much the lawyer said I'm a charge you a quarter cause I like you  
Just do me a favor  
get your life in order
