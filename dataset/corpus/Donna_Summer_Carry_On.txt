La, la, la, la, la, la  
  
Carry on  
Carry on my love  
Just don't look back again  
Follow the dream that's in you  
Say so long  
Say so long my love  
Just get it right this time  
You know it's all up to you  
You've wandered down this road so long  
But faith keeps telling you to go on, go on  
  
Carry on, carry on  
Carry on, carry on  
  
Carry on  
Carry on my love  
Just don't look back again  
Look for the strength that's in you  
Say so long  
Say so long my love  
Trust in your heart again  
You know it's all up to you  
You've wandered down that road so long  
But faith keeps telling you to go on, go on  
  
Carry on, carry on  
Carry on, carry on  
  
Carry on  
Carry on my love  
Just don't look back again  
Look for the strength that's in you  
Say so long  
Say so long my love  
  
Baby, baby don't be afraid  
Baby you can make it baby  
Baby, baby, baby, baby carry on  
You can make it  
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby  
Baby, baby, baby carry on
