You say that I'll survive  
That I'll get over you  
But if you walk away that door  
Then what am I gonna 'do  
They say you don't appreciate love  
Until it's gone  
Well I guess I'll love you more  
Since I've known what was goin' on  
It's so easy to say  
That I'll miss you when you're gone  
But if this is the end  
Then the damage has been done  
Where did I go wrong  
  
How could I believe that we are history, my love  
Even though you give yourself to someone else.  
I will give you all the time you need to work things out  
When all of the excitement gone  
And you're wondering where you went wrong  
Please remember me.  
  
I guess I've got to learn to give you room to breathe  
When all I really want to do is love you close to me  
They say that I have got to be tough  
That God will see me through  
And though I know you love me  
I'm confused, 'cos he wants me to be with you  
I have never felt so very much alone  
But if this is the end oh then I guess I'll carry on  
No matter what you've done.  
  
How could I believe that we are history, my love  
Even though you give yourself to someone else.  
I will give you all the time you need to work things out  
When all of the excitement gone  
And you're wondering where you went wrong  
Please remember me.  
  
I will give you all the time you need to work things out  
When all of the excitement gone  
And you're wondering where you went wrong  
Please, remember me.  
Please, won't you remember me  
  
I'll be waiting here, got nowhere to go  
I'll be waiting.  
Remember me,  
Remember, remember,  
Please remember me,  
Remember, remember, remember me,  
Remember, remember, remember me,  
Remember, remember, remember me,  
I'll be waiting.
