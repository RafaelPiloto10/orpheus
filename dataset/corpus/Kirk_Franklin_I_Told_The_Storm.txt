Even though your winds blow I want you to know  
You cause me no alarm cause I'm safe in His arms  
Even though your rain falls I can still make this call  
Let there be peace now I can say go away  
I command you to move today  
Because of faith I have a brand new day  
The sun will shine and I will be okay  
That's what I told the storm  
(the storm, the storm)  
  
Chorus  
I told the storm (oh yes I did)  
To pass (ohhhhh..)  
Storm you can't last (go away)  
Go away (I command..)  
I command you to move today  
(oh storm)Storm (when God speaks) when God speaks  
Storm (you don't have a choice in the matter, you have to cease)  
You have to cease (yes that's....)  
That's what I told the storm (what I told the storm)  
(repeat once more)  
  
Hook  
I told the storm  
(No weapons formed against me shall prosper I don't have to worry about a
thing)  
I told the storm  
(I'm more than a conqueror through Jesus Christ, and he's gonna bring me out
alright)  
I told the storm  
(It's amazing grace that's brought me safe thus far, and grace is gonna lead
me home)  
I told the storm  
(I stood on solid ground and told my storm and you need to tell your storm
today)  
  
Vamp 1  
(Oh wind) Wind stop blowing  
(Flood stop flowing) Flood stop flowing  
(Lightening stop flashing) Lightening stop flashing  
(Breakers stop dashing) Breakers stop dashing  
(Darkness go away) Darkness go away  
(Clouds move away) Clouds move away  
(That's what I told...) That's what I told the storm  
  
Vamp 2  
(Oh death) Death can't take me  
(Job can't make me) Job can't make me  
(No matter how the fares of this world...) Bills can't break me (may seem to
way me down)  
Disease can't shake me  
You won't drown me  
My God surrounds me  
That's what I told the storm  
(repeat vamp 2 one more time)  
  
That's what I told the storm (repeat until end and fade)
