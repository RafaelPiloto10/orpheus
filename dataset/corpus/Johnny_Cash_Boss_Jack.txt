Pick a lot o'cotton drag a long sack comin' across the field well I see Boss
Jack  
He's a ridin' straddle of a single foot roan  
When you know that horse you'll leave him alone  
The ole roan's got green in his eyes mean as the devil and twice as wise  
  
A fire in his nose and a bow in his back can't nobody ride him but Boss Jack  
Come on children bend your back work a little faster fill your sack  
Then you hitch up the wagon take it to the gin finish pickin' before the
winter sets in  
  
Now here while back when the crop was laid by  
Remember who took us on a big fish fry  
Caught a heap of catfish goggle eye and carp  
Dashed and sang to the guitar and the harp  
  
Well someday old Boss Jack is gonna set us all free  
Gabriel gonna blow for you and me  
Angels gonna bring that chariot from above floppin' there wings like a turtle
dove  
Come on children...
