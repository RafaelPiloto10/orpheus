You're setting me up, you're turning me down  
You're turning me over and spinning me round  
You think you run the show and so you'd better get ready  
I'm gonna read you the score, I'm gonna teach you to love me  
  
I'm checking you out, I'm checking you in  
I'm checking you over before I begin  
I'm gonna show you how and baby you're gonna make it  
Because I told you before, I'm gonna teach you to love me  
  
You played around, you took me for a ride  
I'm the one that always had to try  
Now there's no more changing me, and baby can't you see  
That all I want is no more changing you  
  
I'm picking you up, I'm putting you down  
I'm turning you over and spinning you round  
Because I'm running the show, I'm gonna teach you to love me  
I'm gonna even the score, I'm gonna teach you to love me  
  
I'm picking you up and putting you down  
I'm turning you over and spinning you round  
Because I'm running the show, I'm gonna teach you to love me  
I'm gonna even the score, I'm gonna teach you to love me  
Because I told you before, I'm gonna teach you to love me  
You know I told you before, I'm gonna teach you to love me
