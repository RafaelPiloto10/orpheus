Don't look for me in Heaven  
Don't look for me in Hell  
Heaven taken me alive  
I've got no soul to sell  
  
Don't look for me in prison  
Don't try to save my soul  
I'm a man without a country  
And I've got no place to go  
  
You can say I'm just a gringo  
You can say I'm just a man  
I live outside the law  
Doing anything I can  
  
I keep the laws I make  
And I break the laws you keep  
I'm living on the edge  
Living on the street  
  
Don't look for me in Heaven  
Don't look for me in Hell  
Heaven taken me alive  
I've got no soul to sell  
  
Don't look for me in prison  
Don't try to save my soul  
I'm a man without a country  
And I've got no place to go  
  
Each day I fight to live  
I fight to stay alive  
Don't get in my way  
Unless you want to die  
  
One who stands tall  
Never stands alone  
  
[Solo]  
  
Don't look for me in Heaven  
Don't look for me in Hell  
Never taking me alive  
I've got no soul to sell  
  
Don't look for me in prison  
Don't try to save my soul  
I'm a man without a country  
And I've got no place to go  
  
You can say I'm just a gringo  
You can say I'm just a man  
I live outside the law  
Doing anything I can  
  
I keep the laws I make  
And I break the laws you keep  
I'm living on the edge  
Living on the street  
  
Don't look for me in Heaven  
Don't look for me in Hell  
Heaven taken me alive  
I've got no soul to sell  
  
Don't look for me in prison  
Don't try to save my soul  
I'm a man without a country  
And I've got no place to go
