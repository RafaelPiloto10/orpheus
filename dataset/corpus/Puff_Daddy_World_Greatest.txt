I am a mountain, I am a tall tree, oh  
I am a swift wind sweepin' the country  
I am a river down in the valley, oh  
I am a vision and I can see clearly  
  
If anybody asks you who I am  
Just stand up tall  
Look em' in the face and say  
  
Chorus:  
I'm that star up in the sky  
I'm that mountain peak up high  
Hey, I made it mm..  
I'm the world's greatest  
And I'm that little bit of hope  
When my back's against the ropes  
I can feel it mm..  
I'm the worlds greatest  
  
I am a giant, I am an eagle, oh  
I am a lion, down in the jungle  
I am a marchin' band, I am the people, oh  
I am a helpin' hand, I am a hero  
  
If anybody asks you who I am  
Just stand up tall  
Look em' in the face and say  
  
Chorus  
  
In the ring of life I'll reign love  
(I will reign)  
And the world will notice a king  
(Oh yeah..)  
When all is darkest, I'll shine a light  
(Shine a light)  
And use the success you find in me  
(Me..)  
  
Chorus 3x  
  
1-It's the greatest  
Can you feel it repeat 10x  
  
While Repeating of 1-  
I saw the light  
At the end of a tunnel  
Believe in the pot of gold  
At the end of the rainbow  
And faith was right there  
To pull me through, yeah  
Used to be locked doors  
Now I can just walk on through  
Hey, uh, hey, hey, hey  
It's the greatest  
I'm that star up in the sky  
  
Chorus
