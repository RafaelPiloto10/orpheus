Hey hey I am the stow-a-way  
Hey hey I am the stow-a-way  
  
  
My girl turned blue as an iceberg do  
And me I'm totally shipwrecked over her  
Baby baby don't blow away  
Hey hey I am the stow-a-way  
I am the stow-a-way  
  
  
This is your captain talking to ya  
This is your captain talking to ya  
This is your captain talking to ya  
This is your captain talking to ya  
  
  
Heartache
