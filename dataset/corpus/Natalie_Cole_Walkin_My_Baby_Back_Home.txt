(Natalie)  
Gee, It's great after being out late,  
Walking my baby back home,  
Arm in arm over meadow and farm,  
Walking my baby back home.  
  
(Nat)  
We go along harmonizing a song,  
Or I'm reciting a poem,  
Owls go by and they give me the eye,  
Walking my baby back home  
  
(Natalie)  
We stop for awhile, he gives me a smile,  
I snuggle my head to his chest  
We started to pet and that's when I get  
My powder all over his vest!  
  
(Nat)  
After I kinda straighten my tie,  
She has to borrow my comb,  
One kiss then we continue again,  
Walking my baby back home.  
  
(Nat)  
She's 'fraid of the dark, so I have to park  
Outside of her door till it's light  
  
(Natalie)  
Now I say if he tries to kiss me I'll cry  
  
(Nat)  
I'd try her tears all through the night  
  
(Both)  
Hand in hand to a barbque stand,  
  
(Nat)  
Right from her doorway we roam  
Eats and then it's a pleasure again  
  
(Both)  
Walking my baby,  
Talking my baby,  
Loving my baby,  
I don't mean maybe,  
Walking my baby back home  
  
(Natalie)  
Nighty-night!
