With every step I take I get one step in step with you  
With every move you make I can't wait to make my move  
Got your voice buzzing in my head and a rollercoaster down my spine  
Well don't you know that boys will be boys  
And I could never live my life without you  
Sometimes you make me feel like I got a heartful of toys  
Oh baby boys will be boys.  
  
Tell me what can I do 'cause I can't change the things I said  
I can't help the way I feel or what goes on inside my head  
Bad news and broken dreams in time will fade away  
Well don't you know that boys will be boys  
But baby I'm a man since the day I found you.  
Sometimes you make me feel like I got a heartful of toys  
Oh baby boys will be boys.  
  
And don't you know that girls will be girls  
And I just wanna live any way that I want to  
From either side of the fence vive la difference  
So help me boys will be boys  
Got your voice buzzing in my head and a rollercoaster down my spine  
Well don't you know that boys will be boys...  
Boys will... Boys will be... Boys will be boys...
