Are those your eyes?  
Is that your smile?  
I been looking at you for ever,  
Yet I never saw you before.  
Are these your hands? Holding mine?  
Now I wonder how I could have been so blind.  
And for the first time, I am looking in your eyes.  
For the first time, I'm seeing who you are.  
I can't believe how much I see,  
When you're looking back at me.  
Now I understand what love is,  
Love is  
For the first time  
  
Can this be real?  
Can this be true?  
Am I the person I was this morning?  
And are you the same you?  
It's all so strange.  
How can it be?  
All along this love was right in front of me!  
And for the first time, I am looking in your eyes.  
For the first time, I am seeing who you are.  
I can't believe how much I see,  
When you're looking back at me.  
Now I understand what love is  
Love is  
For the first time.  
  
Such a long time ago,  
I had given up on finding this emotion,  
Ever again.  
But you're here with me now,  
Yes I found you somehow,  
And I've never been so sure.  
For the first time, I am looking in your eyes,  
For the first time, I'm seeing who you are,  
Can't believe how much I see,  
When you're looking back at me.  
Now I understand what love is  
Love is  
For the first time.  
For the first time.
