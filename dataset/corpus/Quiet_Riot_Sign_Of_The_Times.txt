Well I have street sense radar  
Ooh, is supposed be news  
You better lock up your daughters  
You never know when we're due  
  
Good news, bad news  
It's all the same  
Addicts on main streets  
They give us the blame  
  
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!  
We're a sign of the times  
Having fun ain't no crime  
We're a sign of the times  
Having fun all the time, yeah  
  
Great impersonators  
We broke all the rules  
We laugh with our masks on  
The joke is on you  
  
You're getting furry  
It does you no good  
It's the same old story  
It's a human zoo

Addicts on main streets  
Please, please give us a break
