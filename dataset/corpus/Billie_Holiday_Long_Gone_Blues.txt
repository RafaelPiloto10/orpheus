Talk to me baby  
Tell me what's the matter now  
Tell me, baby what's the matter now?  
Are you tryin' to quit me, baby  
But you don't know how  
  
I've been your slave  
Ever since I've been your babe  
I've been your slave  
Ever since I've been your babe  
  
But before I see you go  
I see you in your grave  
  
I'm a good gal  
But my love is all wrong  
  
I'm a good gal  
But my love is all wrong  
  
I'm a real good gal  
But my love is gone
