With a face (with a face)  
With a face (with a face)  
Only this morning  
The thought I've been wanting  
The tropical storm was passing through  
And so were you  
How come you're always crashing  
Saw your eyes flashing  
The tropical storm was passing through  
And so were you  
With a face like that  
How couldn't I want you  
With a face like that  
Why wouldn't I fall in love with you  
With a face like that  
With a face like that, you could win a fortune  
With a face like that, you could have the moon  
With a face like that, you could look as your master  
With a face like that  
In a place like this  
Why wouldn't I fall in love  
With a face like that  
Why wouldn't I fall in love  
  
With a face like that  
Follow a lighting  
Touch your heels heightening  
With it or hate it much more real  
And a permission I bare  
Standing so near me  
You put the fear of God in me  
Felt like the town was falling down  
And there you are  
With a face like that  
How couldn't I want you  
With a face like that  
Why wouldn't I fall in love with you  
With a face like that  
With a face like that, you should be a law suit  
With a face like that, can I bow down and point  
With a face like that, all the girls want too  
With a face like that  
In a place like this  
Why wouldn't I fall in love  
With a face like that  
Why wouldn't I fall in love  
With a face like that
