I've been chasing after josie since the day i could run  
Even though i didn't know it at the time  
And i followed her from texas 'til she found me undone  
Just a jump ahead of what i left behind.  
  
She was proud of her young body as a body could be  
On her way to be a woman of the world  
And I still can see her smiling as she gave it to me  
Lookin' like a lonesome little girl.  
  
Josie, is it true that you've grown harder than your years  
Sellin' them your sadness on the street  
How much did you lose between the laughter and the tears  
Gettin' back the bitter for the sweet  
  
Well, she loved me back to livin' at a time i was lost  
With the closest thing to love i've ever known  
And she led me through some bridges i was burnin' to cross  
Then she went and burned some bridges of her own.  
  
Now the road's a little colder every time that i leave  
For another empty place i've never been  
And i don't suppose it's likely that she's lookin' for me  
But someday i may just chase her down again.  
  
Josie, is it true that you've grown harder than your years  
Sellin' them your sadness on the street  
How much did you lose between the laughter and the tears  
Gettin' back the bitter for the sweet
