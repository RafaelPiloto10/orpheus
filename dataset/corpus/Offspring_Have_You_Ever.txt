Falling, I'm falling  
  
Have you ever walked through a room  
But it was more like the room passed around you  
Like there was a leash around your neck that pulled you through  
  
Have you ever been at someplace  
Recognizing everybody's face  
Until you realized that there was no one there you knew  
Well I know  
  
Some days, my soul's confined and out of mind  
Sleep forever  
Some days, I'm so outshined and out of time  
Have you ever  
  
Falling, I'm falling  
  
Have you ever buried your face in your hands  
'Cause no one around you understands  
Or has the slightest idea what it is that makes you be  
  
Have you ever felt like there was more  
Like someone else was keeping score  
And what could make you whole was simply out of reach  
Well I know  
  
Someday I'll try again and not pretend  
This time forever  
Someday I'll get it straight but not today  
Have you ever  
  
Falling, I'm falling  
  
Some days, my soul's confined and out of mind  
Sleep forever  
Some days, my darkest friend is me again  
Have you ever  
Someday I'll try again and not pretend  
This time forever  
Someday I'll get it straight but not today  
Have you ever  
  
When the truth walks away  
Everybody stays  
'Cause the truth about the world is that crime does pay  
  
So if you walk away  
Who is gonna stay  
'Cause I'd like to think the world is a better place  
  
When the truth walks away  
Everybody stays  
'Cause the truth about the world is that crime does pay  
  
So if you walk away  
Who is gonna stay  
'Cause I'd like to make the world be a better place  
  
When the truth walks away  
Everybody stays  
'Cause the truth about the world is that crime does pay  
  
So if you walk away  
Who is gonna stay  
'Cause I'd like to think the world is a better place  
I'd like to leave the world as a better place  
I'd like to think the world
