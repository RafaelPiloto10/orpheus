I've had nothing but sorrow  
Since you said we were through  
There's no hope for tomorrow  
How's the World Treating You  
  
Every sweet thing that mattered  
Has been broken in two  
All my dreams have been shattered  
How's the World Treating You  
  
Got no plans for next Sunday  
Got no plans for today  
Everyday is blue Monday  
Everyday You're away  
  
Though our pathways have parted  
To your memory I'm true  
Guess I'll stay broken hearted  
How's the World Treating You  
  
Do you wonder about me  
Like I'm hoping you do  
Are you lonesome without me  
Have you found someone new  
  
Are you burning and yearning  
Do you ever get blue  
Do you think of returning  
How's the World Treating You  
  
Do you think of returning  
How's the World Treating You
