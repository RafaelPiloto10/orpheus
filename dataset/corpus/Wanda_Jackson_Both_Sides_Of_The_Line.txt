You just gotta walk on both sides of the line  
You've thrilled at the thought of each stranger's arms you find  
Everything that's yours to hold just can't satisfy your mind  
'Cause you just gotta walk on both sides of the line  
If you had me in a mansion filled with gold  
If I lay at your feet my heart and my soul  
You'd still crave the grapes on your next door neighbor's vine  
'Cause you just gotta walk on both sides of the line  
  
You just gotta walk...  
'Cause you just gotta walk on both sides of the line
