I know that you're leavin'  
As soon as the sun  
Comes through the window  
There's no talking this over  
The damage is done  
There's just too much hurt  
Too much to forgive  
Oh, but we both know  
We weren't always like this  
  
[Chorus:]  
Help me remember  
The way that we used to be  
When nothin' else mattered  
"cause you were lovin' me  
Just for the night, one last time  
One more good memory  
When I look back  
That's what I wanna see  
  
Oh, help me remember  
  
Those days that were so good  
Those nights that we held  
Held on forever  
When we weren't pretenders  
We were as real as we felt  
Oh, I don't want to fight anymore  
Don't want the last thing I hear tonight  
To be a slammin' door  
Baby, let it be like before  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This could be the last time  
I look in your eyes  
  
Help me remember  
The way that it used to be  
When nothin' else mattered  
'Cause you were lovin' me  
Oh, help me remember  
Oh, help me, help me  
Oh, oh, oh, oh-
