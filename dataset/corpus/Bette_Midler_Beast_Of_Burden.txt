Now write this down  
  
I'll never be your beast of burden  
My back is broad but it's a hurting  
All I want is for you to make love to me  
  
I'll never be your beast of burden  
I've walked for miles my feet are hurting  
All I want is you to make love to me  
  
Ain't I hard enough  
Ain't I rough enough  
Ain't I rich enough  
I'm not too blind to see  
  
I'll never be your beast of burden  
So let's go home and draw the curtains  
Put some music on the radio  
Come on baby make sweet love to me (Oh what's a matter with me?)  
  
Ain't I hard enough  
Ain't I rough enough  
Ain't I rich enough  
I'm not too blind to see  
  
Oh oh my little sister  
Is a pretty, pretty, girl  
My little sister is a pretty, pretty, girl  
She love to ride, and she loves to crawl  
They love to take her out, behind the wall  
  
And when their done, they just throw her away  
And she don't have an awful lot to say  
It hurts her so bad to come to the end  
I re, I remember all the times she spent sayin', "Please!"  
  
Ain't I hot enough?  
Ain't I rough enough?  
Ain't I rich enough?  
I'm not too blind to see, oh oh  
Oh, oh  
  
I'll never be your beast of burden.  
My back is broad, baby, but it's a' hurtin'.  
And all I want is you to make love to me.  
  
What's the matter, what's the matter with me?  
Ain't I hot enough?  
Ooh, yeah, ain't I rough enough?  
Ooh, yeah, ain't I rich enough, rich enough, rich enough,  
Too blind to see? Too blind, too blind, oh!  
  
I'll never be your beast of burden.  
I walk for miles, honey, my feet are hurtin'.  
And all I want
