I was brought up to believe  
The universe has a plan  
We are only human  
It's not ours to understand  
  
The universe has a plan  
All is for the best  
Some will be rewarded  
And the devil will take the rest  
  
All is for the best  
Believe in what we're told  
Blind man in the market  
Buying what we're sold  
Believe in what we're told  
Until our final breath  
While our loving Watchmaker  
Loves us all to death  
  
In a world of cut and thrust  
I was always taught to trust  
In a world where all must fail  
Heaven's justice will prevail  
  
The joy and pain that we receive  
Each comes with its own cost  
The price of what we're winning  
Is the same as what we've lost  
  
Until our final breath  
The joy and pain that we receive  
Must be what we deserve  
I was brought up to believe
