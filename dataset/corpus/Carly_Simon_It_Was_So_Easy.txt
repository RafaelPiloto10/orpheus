I remember a time, rompin' through the woods  
Sun against our skin instead of clothes  
When we felt hungry we would eat, whn we felt glad we would dance  
And whenever we felt drowsy we would doze  
  
It was so easy then never takin' any stands  
It was so easy then, holdin' hands  
  
I remember a time when our fears could be named  
And courage meant not refusing dares  
I remember when we took such cares to step never on the cracks,  
No only on the squares  
Or else we'd be abducted by the bears  
  
It was so easy then never makin' any plans  
It was so easy then, holdin' hands  
It was so easy then never makin' any plans  
It was so easy then, holdin' hands  
  
And now we are grown, with debts and regrets  
And broken hearts and sentimental schemes  
Now every tender failure seems to overthrow old dreams  
Love can lead a normal woman to extremes  
  
It was so easy once, holdin' hands without a plan  
It was so easy once holdin' hands  
Just holdin' hands
