'Cause I lie like a bandit, punks can't stand it,  
I can arm wrestle and roll and joint left handed  
  
Later to the hater, brown Darth Vader,  
Kick a Tre Flip, Make money like a skater  
  
Double down aces, melt your faces,  
I'm out of this world just like outer space is  
  
Always been a quitter, tweet it on twitter,  
My breath stinks 'cause I'm a bullshitter  
  
They say I live my life too fast, they call me an outcast  
Borrowed time and they say that it won't last  
Misunderstood, there goes the neighbourhood  
Couldn't win even if I should  
  
Cause I've got a bad reputation  
Born to lose in a dying generation  
Whoa-Oh I'm lost in translation  
I can't win cause I was born to lose  
Born to lose  
  
Got my train of thought rapid, some say vapid,  
Pole position you then come round, lap it  
  
Burnin' ya laser, shock ya like a tazer,  
Stab ya in the back-a dirt bag trailblazer  
  
A no good liar, high like a flyer  
I'm a Les Paul, callin' you a Squire  
  
Acting like I'm better, take go-getter,  
Start the slow clap as I take a fuckin' header  
  
They say I am a reject, they call me a defect  
Wasted time, I'm the cause and the effect  
Misunderstood, there goes the neighbourhood  
Couldn't win even if I should  
  
Cause I've got a bad reputation  
Born to lose in a dying generation  
Whoa-Oh I'm lost in translation  
I can't win cause I was born to lose  
Born to lose  
  
Cause I've got a bad reputation  
Born to lose in a dying generation  
Whoa-Oh I'm lost in translation  
I can't win cause I was born to lose  
Born to lose  
  
Cause I've got a bad reputation  
Born to lose in a dying generation  
Whoa-Oh I'm lost in translation  
I can't win cause I was born to lose  
Born to lose  
  
It doesn't matter what I do  
It doesn't matter what I do  
I can't win cause I was born to lose  
Yeah, Born to lose  
Born to lose  
Born to lose
