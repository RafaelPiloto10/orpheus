The sun's shining beautiful and everything is going my way  
I've got a love that's wonderful he's always there with loving words to say  
Well I hold him close and let him know that to me he is my everything  
Without a word the world is mine just one look from him and I'm a queen  
A girl's gotta sing when she's got everything so now I'm singin' my song  
Now I've gotta sing cause he's my everything  
Don't you know I'm happy won't you sing along  
I'm singing la la la la la la la...  
I'm singing la la la la la la la...  
I can thank my lucky stars for the never ending love he gives to me  
When I'm by his side flame of love burns bright for all the world to see  
When he calls my name out low I can hear the bells begin to ring  
And happiness is all around that's the reason why I've gotta sing  
A girl's gotta sing...
