See she all on my dick cause I make  
A lot of money, but I dunno why cause  
Gets nothing, bring it back...  
All on my dick cause I make a lot of money,  
But I dunno why cause she gets none from me she only get dick way down in her
tummy,  
And she tell all of her friends now her friends wanna, bring it back...  
Only get dick way  
Down in her tummy,  
And she tell all of her friends now her friends wanna fuck me  
I'm lookin' in the mirror and I see a dollar sign  
I had a cat scan and I had money on my mind  
I tell a bitch go and get my name on ya spin  
So I can fell good when I'm hitting it from behind  
I'm crack rock fresh baby I'm that boy  
Yea put me in a pot and watch I come back hard  
Yea put me on that block and watch I come back rich  
Now she done put me in that pussy she ain't come back since  
  
[Chorus]  
Ask dem hoes, yea ask dem hoes, ask  
Dem hoes about me, ask dem hoes,  
Uh huh yea ask dem hoes, ask dem

Hat to the side rims on the ride  
It cant fit in my pocket and I don't have, hold up...  
Hat to the side rims on the ride  
It cant fit in my pocket and I don't have to cock it  
Scarface bitch cocaine by the pie  
Got them hoes snifin' like dem hoes about to hold up...  
Scarface bitch cocaine by the pie  
Got them hoes snifin' like dem hoes about to cry  
Ms. myspace don't blow my high  
I download hard dick to your hard drive  
Den she got on her knees and soon we locked eyes  
She caught it like it was a routine pop fly  
I'm dope boy fresh new jeans new everything dem  
Bitches want me like a wedding ring  
I told her dat I'm married to the money  
Committed to the cash all I see is pussy, titties, and the ass  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Call me Wezzy F. bitch I'm straight from the street  
Dope game is sour and the dope is sweet  
I live in the tower got a scope on the heat  
Hit you from 100 feet we don't even have to meet  
Ya bitch love me we don't even have to meet  
But if I run into her believe me I will hold on...  
Ya bitch love me we don't even have to meet  
But if I run into her believe me I will do her  
And if that bitch bitch is crazy believe I will sue her  
Got some hungry ass lawyers that would eat her up and chew her  
I don't know why you love her I wish I never knew her  
She only give me brain she was just another tutor  
She blow my whole band I was just another tuba  
Now get off my dick and get lost in Aruba  
Its money over bitches cash money over bitches young money over bitches  
Get money from them bitches  
I Do!
