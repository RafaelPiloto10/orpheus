Take your time, to unwind  
You will find it's love you are living  
Clear the space, find a place  
You will see it's love you are giving.  
  
Take you time to make things last  
Love for the future, not the past  
I can't change the way I am  
This is all I got, this Cheap Love Song  
  
Take your time, make it rhyme  
You will see it's all believing  
One fine day, we'll find a way  
You will reach your own destination.  
  
Seven clowns with different faces  
Love we've lost, but we're still chasing  
One day we'll leave this town,  
It's all we've got, this Cheap Love Song.  
  
Take your time, feel fine  
You will see, it's all believing.  
One fine day, we'll find a way  
You will reach your own destination.  
  
Come on, carry on now  
  
Better make a try now  
Hold your head up high now  
Win love.  
It's nothing superficial,  
Been wrote to break the dish, oh  
I'm making it 'ficial  
In love.  
  
Carry on now
