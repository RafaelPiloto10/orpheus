The waiting game is over, no need for pretending  
We were meant to be  
It's only getting stronger, the love I feel for you  
It's no mystery  
  
I've got to find some way to tell you, though our world seems far apart  
It just don't have to be  
The time has come to testify, all the feelings I've been holding back  
It's time to set them free  
  
[Chorus:]  
I've been watching you from the other side  
I've been wanting to hold you through the night  
I've got to find my way to the other side  
I want to hold you tonight and forever  
  
The moment that I saw you  
I knew inside my heart, all my dreams would come true  
I know it took some time to realize  
A love we can't deny, I've got to see it through  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I want to be the one who loves you, now and forever  
I want to take my place beside you  
I want to be the one to hold you, now and forever  
I will meet you there on the other side  
  
[Chorus] [x 2]  
  
From the other side, from the other side  
I want to hold you tonight and forever
