Not Long Ago  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Steve Millikan and Ray Boltz  
Not long ago you were happy  
There was a light in your eyes  
Not long ago how you loved Him so  
Remember when you  
Gave Him your life?  
Can you tell me what happened?  
Did your heart slowly grow cold?  
Did you give in to temptation  
And now you feel so alone?  
Chorus:  
When not long ago  
Seems so far away  
The journey begins  
The moment you pray  
Like a prodigal son  
It's time to come home  
To the One that you loved  
Not long ago  
Not long ago God gave us  
The gift of His own precious Son  
Not long ago, how He suffered so  
For all of the wrongs we have done  
If He suffered to save us  
If He would pay such a cost  
He'll put His arms around you  
And give you back what you've lost  
Chorus
