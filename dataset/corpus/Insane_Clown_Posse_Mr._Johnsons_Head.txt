[Violent J]  
Sitting in the class with my head on the desk  
Teacher's trying to talk but I could give a fuck less  
I'm staring at the freak that I know I'm in love with  
But she don't even know my name it's always been the same  
I just lay my head down and drown in my spit  
Nobody even notices I'm here 'cause I ain't shit  
I hear voices but I don't know what they saying  
Sweat is on my forehead 'cause my brain's inside decaying  
And this bitch that I love probably don't have no idea  
She's talking to her friends I'm in the corner and I see her  
Something's happening but it isn't very clear  
Sounds like a bell, sounds like an electric chair  
Next thing I know walking in the crowded hall  
So many different faces that I throw up on the wall  
Some are yelling "sick" and the others stop and stare  
But I don't care, I'm in a hurry going nowhere  
See, my head is spinning 'cause I'm lonely and I'm twisted  
But I have a secret everybody missed it  
Just a nobody and I think it's a drag  
But I got Mr. Johnson's head in my bookbag  
[Chorus (2x)]  
I couldn't stand the pressure, not another day  
I didn't like the fucker Mr. Johnson anyway  
I sat up in his class, he hung a rebel flag  
I cut the bigots head off and I stuffed it in my bag  
[Violent J]  
I wish somebody knew me 'cause then they could say I'm wrong  
But since nobody knows me I got it going on  
I'm staring at the clock, I listen for the tock  
I gotta couple food stamps folded in my sock  
I guess I'm just a ghost 'cause everybody walks through me  
If I died in class they would probably say they knew me  
Or they wouldn't care, they wouldn't even move  
A dead body rotting in the back of the room  
For weeks and months, stinking up the class  
Until somebody noticed then they throw me in the trash  
I can hear the teacher man talking about Columbus  
He nothing but an old dead fuck with a compass  
Ran up on a beach and threw everybody off  
And then he claimed discovery and now we all applaud  
I don't give a fuck to learn your uncle went to hell  
I'm trapped in mind and my brain is my cell  
But I have a key, it's called insanity  
I stick in my brain to unlock eternity  
Just a nobody and I think it's a drag  
But I got Mr. Johnson's head in my bookbag  
[Chorus (2x)]  
"Okay, today we're gonna learn about A Great Freedom. If you'll turn  
Your textbooks to Chapter Four we'll get started. America's the  
Land of the free, all racists live together in harmony, and we are all  
Treated equal, we all live togerther in the same wealthy community  
And we are alternate equals. Yes?"  
"Man, Mr. Johnson already taught us this. Ain't he ever coming back?"  
"Uh, uh, he's, uh, very ill right now."  
[Violent J]  
No, they can sit and front about it all day  
But I left his fucking body in the hallway  
And in the morning they opened up the door  
And seen his motherfucking carcass laying on the floor  
But they would never suspect me I'm just a nerd  
I try to speak my word, it always goes unheard  
I could chop my arms off and run around the class  
I doubt they'd even notice, but I'd be dying fast  
'cause they'd rather learn about redneck chicker  
Who owned a couple slaves but I guess it doesn't matter  
Fuck Washington, Benjamin, fuck em all ah  
They can suck my nuts till they wood teeth fall out  
And the class wanna know who could it be  
But I'm like Dewey Boodie, you ain't never heard of me  
I'm just a nobody and I think it's a drag  
But I got his motherfucking melon chilling in my bookbag  
[Chorus (9x)]
