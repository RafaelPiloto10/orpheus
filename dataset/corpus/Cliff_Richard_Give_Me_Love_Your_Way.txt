Got every reason to feel like I do  
From the top of my head to the bottom of my shoes  
'Cause last night my baby took the weight off my mind  
Told me everything was gonna be fine  
She said she loved me  
I'm never gonna be without the love she promised to give me  
'Cause she says every night, hold me tight, forever is right  
Love is bright, moon delight, she's outta sight  
Give me, give me, give me love your way  
She could have resisted my efforts to pry  
But she knows how I feel and she's not exactly shy  
Though right now I'm lonely I know it won't be long  
I can hear the train comin' bringin' lovin' along  
She said she loved me  
I'm never gonna be without the love she promised to give me  
'Cause she says every night, hold me tight, forever is right  
Love is bright, moon delight, she's outta sight  
Give me, give me, give me love your way  
Oh I used to be so lost and confused  
I stumbled through knowing that each door I tried  
Was closed before me and knowing that I cried  
But still I didn't rest I had to know  
What was behind it all I'd come so far  
And then I saw her note I couldn't believe she wrote  
I couldn't resist it being beside her  
Could have held that moment forever in my heart  
The moment I saw her was the moment I knew  
That her love is my life and her light's shining through  
She said she loved me  
I'm never gonna be without the love she promised to give me  
'Cause she says every night, hold me tight, forever is right  
Love is bright, moon delight, she's outta sight  
Give me, give me, give me love your way  
Oh I used to be so lost and confused  
I stumbled through knowing that each door I tried  
Was closed before me and knowing that I cried  
But still I didn't rest I had to know  
What was behind it all I'd come so far  
And then I saw her note I couldn't believe she wrote
