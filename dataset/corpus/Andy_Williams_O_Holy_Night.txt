O holy night!  
The stars are brightly shining,  
It is the night  
Of the dear Savior's birth  
  
Long lay the world  
In sin and error pining  
Till He appeared  
And the Soul felt its worth  
  
A thrill of hope  
The weary soul rejoices,  
For yonder breaks  
A new and glorious morn  
  
Fall on your knees!  
Oh, hear the angel voices!  
O night divine,  
O night when Christ was born  
O night, O holy night,  
O night divine!  
  
O night divine,  
O night when Christ was born  
O night,  
O holy night,  
O night divine!  
O night when Christ was born
