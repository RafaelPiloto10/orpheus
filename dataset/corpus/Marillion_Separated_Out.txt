Can you feel my skin  
Can you feel my bones  
Can you put my spine in plaster and take me home  
  
So unpleasant inside and out  
So unpleasant inside and out  
If you like I'll tell you about it  
You wouldn't want to know  
  
My heads full of water  
Tears I never cried  
Could you hold me under the shower  
In the cold outside  
  
So unsteady inside and out  
So unsteady inside and out  
If you like I'll tell you about it  
You wouldn't want to be  
  
Separated out  
Separated out  
Separated out  
  
I need medical attention  
Where's my memory gone  
Everything I told you - including this,  
I already forgot  
  
Separated out  
From the living stream  
The thing that couldn't lie straight  
Straight in the machine  
  
So unstable inside and out  
Don't know how much longer I'll take it  
If you like I'll sell you a ticket  
Or you can get in for free  
  
Am I enough of a freak  
To be worth paying to see  
Am I enough of a freak  
To be worth paying to see  
  
Can you feel my skin  
Can you feel my bones  
Can you put my spine in plaster and take me home  
Can you kiss my face  
Let me know it's there  
Can you give it shape  
Can you kinda care  
  
Am I enough of a freak  
To be worth paying to see  
Enough of a freak  
To be worth paying to see  
  
Enough  
Enough  
  
They're pointing and laughing  
They're pointing and laughing at me
