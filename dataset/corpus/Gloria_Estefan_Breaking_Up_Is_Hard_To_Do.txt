You tell me that you're leaving  
Can't believe it's true  
Boy there's no living without you  
Don't take your love away from me  
Don't you leave my heart in misery  
'Cause if you go then I'll be blue  
  
Breaking up is hard to do  
  
Remember when you held me tight,  
And you kissed me all through the night  
Think of all that we been through,  
And breaking up is hard to do  
  
They say that breakin' up is hard to do  
Now I know, I know that it's true  
Don't say that this is the end  
Instead of breakin' up  
I wish that we were making up again  
I beg of you  
Don't say goodbye  
Can't we give our love  
Just one more try  
Come on baby  
Let's start anew  
Breakin' up is hard to do  
Breakin' up is oh so hard to do
