Yes, the roof leaks and the bed she squeak  
And the rent is due in just two more weeks  
Now I just want to go back to sleep  
Tomorrow is another day  
  
Oh, the palm trees sway to and fro  
I think I'll just sit and watch the coconuts grow  
It's hard to get high when your feeling so low  
And tomorrow is another day  
  
Well, the mainsail broke on my fishing boat  
And it's almost time for my rum and Coke  
I'll fix it as soon as I have a smoke  
Tomorrow is another day, yeah  
  
So you go at night with your lantern bright  
And you sit on the bridge and you get half tight  
Ah, tonight you can't get the fish to bite  
But tomorrow's another day, yeah, yeah  
  
Tomorrow is another day  
You know what I mean, son?  
I want to go fishing and swimming  
Looking at the pretty girls on the beaches, son  
I don't want to do no work
