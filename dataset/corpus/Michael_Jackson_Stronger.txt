Be Strong  
In The Front Of The Sorrow  
There's No Time To Cry Soldier  
Weep Your Tears And We're 'Bout To Go  
What Is Done Is Done Forever, Boy Scout  
  
Be Strong (Be Strong Soldier!)  
(That's An Order!)  
  
Be Strong  
This Is What You've Been Made For  
By Sweat And By Pain  
The Super Soldier Number Twenty-Six  
Who Doesn't Care Where He Shoots At  
'Til He Has Proved That  
He's Worth Of The Gun In His Hands To Walk With
