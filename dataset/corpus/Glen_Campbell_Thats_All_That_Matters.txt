I know I'm not your first love  
They're just a past memory  
I'm the one who's got you now  
And that's all that matters to me  
I know other arms have held you  
But I'm not jealous of these  
Mine are the arms that hold you now  
And that's all that matters to me  
I came alive when you came along  
Yes you've brought life back to me  
And I don't care what's in your past  
You're as far as I can see  
I know other lips have kissed you  
And I know you've been thrilled and pleased  
Mine are the lips that kiss you now  
And that's all that matters to me  
Yes mine are the arms that hold you now  
And that's all that matters to me
