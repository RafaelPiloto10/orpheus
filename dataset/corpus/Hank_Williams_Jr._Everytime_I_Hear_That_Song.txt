I heard cowboys should never cry,  
But there are some things that bring tears to my eyes.  
Some old movies they've shown,  
Some old people all alone,  
And everytime I hear that song.  
  
Everytime I hear that song,  
I think of someone who is gone,  
And the hurtin' starts comin' on real strong,  
Everytime I hear that song.  
  
What makes big old boys like me,  
Get down on bended knee?  
And today's girl who's moving ahead,  
Stay at home all night crying in bed.  
It's those old loves that linger on,  
Just like some of those good old songs.  
  
Everytime I hear that song,  
I think of someone who is gone,  
And the hurtin' starts comin' on real strong,  
Everytime I hear that song.
