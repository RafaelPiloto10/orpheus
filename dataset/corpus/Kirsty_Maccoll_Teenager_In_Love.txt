He's my boyfriend but he treats me so mean and so cruel  
He's always fighting the kids in my class after school  
Mama told my papa i can't see him no more  
They won't let us talk on the phone  
So now i spend all of my time in my room  
And i drink my tequila alone  
  
I'm just a lonely alcoholic teenager in love  
I'm just a lonely alcoholic teenager in love  
  
It's a secret and they'd kill me if they ever knew  
So i keep it in a spot that's well hidden from view  
My boyfriend isn't bothered when he shouts at my pa  
And everything comes back to me  
And he's always drinking and i'm stuck here thinking  
That this isn't how it should be  
  
I'm just a lonely alcoholic teenager in love  
I'm just a lonely alcoholic teenager in love  
  
No-one around me seems to realise  
That it's mean to keep us apart  
I don't even like the taste of the stuff  
But it's eating away at my heart  
  
I'm just a lonely alcoholic teenager in love  
I'm just a lonely alcoholic teenager in love  
I'm just a lonely alcoholic teenager in love  
I'm just a lonely alcoholic teenager in love
