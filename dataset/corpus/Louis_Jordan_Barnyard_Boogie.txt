Oink oink!  
Moo moo!  
Oink oink moo!  
Oink oink moo moo!  
Q-q-quack! Q-q-quack!  
Peep peep! Peep peep!  
"Peep peep" said the chick in the barnyard pen  
"Quack quack" said the duck "won't you let me in?"  
"Cluck cluck cluck" said the little red hen  
"Let's boogie in the barnyard."  
"Baa baa" said the sheep from another bowl  
"Moo moo" said the cow "let the butter roll"  
"Cluck cluck cluck" said the little red hen  
"Let's boogie in the barnyard."  
Yes, the barnyard was jumpin'  
Everybody havin' their fling  
Even Old MacDonald  
Had to do a little kind o' swing  
"Bow wow" said the dog in the circus top  
"Miaow" said the cat "now, please don't stop"  
"Cluck cluck cluck" said the little red hen  
"Let's boogie in the barnyard."  
Yes, even Uncle Ezra  
Got caught with a dozen eggs  
I saw Aunt Suzey  
Kill the chicken with the bandy leg  
Bow wow, bow wow,  
Miaow, miaow  
"Cluck cluck cluck cluck" said the little red hen  
"Let's boogie in the barnyard."  
Peep peep, quack quack,  
Cluck cluck, moo moo,  
Bow wow, Miaow
