Tempted and tried we're oft made to wonder why it should be thus all the day
long  
While there are others living about us never molested though in the wrong  
When death has come and taken our loved ones it leaves our home so lonely and
drear  
Then do we wonder why others prosper living so wicked year after year  
Farther along we'll know all about it farther along we'll understand why  
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine we'll understand it all by and by  
[ piano ]  
Faithful till death said our loving Master a few more days to labor and wait  
Toils of the road will then seem as nothing as we sweep through the beautiful
gates  
Farther along we'll know all about it...  
Yes we'll understand it all by and by
