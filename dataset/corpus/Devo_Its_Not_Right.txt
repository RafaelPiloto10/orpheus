Baby, baby, baby hurt me bad  
Baby, baby  
Baby, baby made me cry  
Baby, I want to die  
  
Somebody tell me where she's hiding out  
I gotta find that cheatin' gal  
Can't go, can't go, can't go sleep at night  
Can't sleep, can't sleep  
It's not right  
  
Sunlight, sunlight in my eyes  
Sunlight, makes me rise  
I can't sleep until my baby says it's over  
I gotta hear it face to face  
I love you darlin', it's a cryin' shame  
The way you run around like you're in a big game  
I'm so unhappy I could cry every time I think about you  
Boo hoo  
  
Baby, baby, baby please come back  
Baby, baby  
Sunlight, sunlight in my eyes  
Sunlight, makes me rise  
I can't sleep until my baby says it's over  
I gotta hear it face to face  
I love you darlin', it's a cryin' shame  
The way you run around like you're in a big game  
I shoot around in a trance all day and think about you  
All the time  
  
I love you darlin', it's a cryin' shame  
The way you run around like you're in a big game  
It's so unfair that you're so happy when I'm hurtin' inside  
  
I love you darlin', it's a cryin' shame  
The way you run around like you're in a big game  
I'm so unhappy I could cry every time I think about you  
Boo hoo
