They say there's wreckage washing up all along the coast  
No one seems know too much, or got hit the most  
Nothing has been spoken, there's not alot to see  
But something has been broken, that's how feels to me  
  
We had a harmony, I never meant to small boats  
Lying out in the water, like a slick of oil  
Tide is running out to sea, under a darkening sky  
The night is falling down on me, and I'm a thinking that I should head on  
  
Head on home (been gone to long)  
Gone too long, leave my roam  
Beachcomb  
  
Little wild kitten out hunting, see what he can get  
You're in a big city, that won't stop growing yet  
The sun is goin' down smokin', a flaming testiment  
Something has been broken, and it feels permenant.  
  
The little seabird flying, he knows were he wants to go  
Quess I ought to pack my stuff, and do the thing I know  
Turn around and head on back, along the old sea walls  
I felt somthing give and crack, and now I'm sorry that's all head on  
  
Head on home (been gone to long)  
Gone too long, leave my roam  
Beachcomb
