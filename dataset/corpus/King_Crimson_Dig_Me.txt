it's here I sit and rust amid this ruin and rancor like tire irons  
toothy grills and car parts before me...the acid rain floods my  
floorboard, burns my pores, and rots my upholstry.. once I was  
worshipped, polished magnificently, now I lay in decay by the dirty  
angry bay...  
  
I'm ready to leave  
I want to get out of here  
I'm ready to ride away  
I don't want to die in here  
I'm ready to ride  
  
mmy skin is metallic now, no longer an elegant powder blue... my body  
unhinged and sleeping in the jungle of motor block manifolds and metal  
relics... what was deluxe becomes debris, I never questioned loyalty,  
but this dead end demolishes the dream of an open highway...  
  
dig me...but don't...bury me
