You're up state, up late, and city fed  
I'm a california label  
From the top of my head,  
Forever, ah  
See a lot of open sky  
When the sun goes down  
There's a hot, lot of loving when you come  
Around, to free me, ah  
  
In a boat to sail, boat to sail, away, ah  
All those letters mailed from a  
Boat to sail, away ah  
We are riding in a boat to sail  
  
Bare foot, coconut and supermild  
Jamaica take a look  
At your own child  
Forget not  
Brian wilson songs are never left behind  
Don't you worry baby, you're a friend of mine  
For so long  
  
From a boat to sail, boat to sail, away ah  
All those letters mailed, from a  
Boat to sail, away ah  
We are riding in a boat to sail  
We are riding in a boat to sail
