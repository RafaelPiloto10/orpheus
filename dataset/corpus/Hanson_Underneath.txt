Waking up this morning  
Thinking this can't be real  
They say there is nothing love can't heal  
Why don't you come on down  
So you can feel what I feel?  
  
Sitting all alone in this place  
Even though we're here face to face  
There is nothing gone  
But there's something wrong  
  
Can't you see  
That I'm stuck here underneath  
And you make it hard to breathe?  
Take a look around and tell me what you see  
You'll find me underneath  
  
I know what to say  
But don't know where to begin  
I fear I'm losing you beneath my skin  
Is there resolution for this pain that I'm in?  
  
Sitting all alone in this place  
Even though we're here face to face  
There is nothing gone  
But there's something wrong  
  
Can't you see  
That I'm stuck here underneath  
And you make it hard to breathe?  
Take a look around and tell me what you see  
You'll find me underneath  
'Cause you'll find me, whoa, underneath  
  
If only you could feel what I dream  
Maybe you could hear what I mean  
There is nothing gone  
  
But there's something missing  
Can't you see  
That I'm stuck here underneath  
And you make it hard to breathe?  
Take a look around and tell me what you see  
  
You'll find me underneath  
You'll find me underneath  
Underneath, underneath
