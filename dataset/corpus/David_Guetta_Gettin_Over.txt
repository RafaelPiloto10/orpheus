All the things I know right now  
If I only knew back then, there's no gettin' over  
There's no gettin' over, there's just no gettin' over you  
  
Wish I could spin my world into reverse  
Just to have you back again, there's no gettin' over  
There's no gettin' over, there's just no gettin' over you  
  
All the things I know right now  
If I only knew back then, there's no gettin' over  
There's no gettin' over, there's just no gettin' over you  
  
Wish I could spin my world into reverse  
Just to have you back again, there's no gettin' over  
There's no gettin' over, there's just no gettin' over you, no, no  
  
Just no gettin' over you  
Just no gettin' over you

Just to have you back again, there's no gettin' over  
There's no gettin' over, just no gettin' over you  
  
Just no gettin' over you  
Just no gettin' over you  
Just no gettin' over you  
Just no gettin' over you
