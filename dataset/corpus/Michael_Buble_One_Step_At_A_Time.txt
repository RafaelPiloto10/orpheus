One step at a time  
That's how it's gotta be from now on  
And the reason or rhyme  
For packing up or carrying on  
  
Inch by inch is a cinch  
Yard by yard is much harder  
Life without you baby is  
Harder  
Life without you baby is hard  
  
Is the moon going to shine?  
The moon's a piece of cake this time  
One step out of line  
Across my fingers it's a lucky sign  
  
Inch by inch is a cinch  
Yard by yard is much harder  
Life without you baby is  
Harder  
Life without you baby is hard  
  
  
You know the whole affair can be  
Simply  
Settled right from the start  
If we both see  
There's no chance if we dance in the dark  
Lose our way and we can't find a spark  
Take one step any time  
It's easy  
Ready get set off your mark  
  
One step at a time  
Ain't committing a crime  
Or parking where I don't belong.  
  
Inch by inch is a cinch  
And yard by yard is much harder  
Life without you baby is  
Harder  
Life without you baby is hard  
  
Inch by inch is a cinch  
And yard by yard is much harder  
Life without you baby is  
Harder  
Life without you baby is hard  
  
You know the whole affair could be  
Simply  
Settled right from the start  
If we both see  
There's no chance if we dance in the dark  
Lose our way and we can't find a spark  
Take one step any time  
It's easy  
Ready get set off your mark  
  
  
One step at a time  
That's how it's gotta be from now on  
Ain't committing a crime  
Or parking where I don't belong.  
  
Inch by inch is a cinch  
Yard by yard is much harder  
Life without you baby is  
Harder  
Life without you baby is harder  
Life without you baby is hard
