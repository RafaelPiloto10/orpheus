Got the world on a string  
I'm sitting on a rainbow  
Got fat string tied around my finger  
What a world, what a life, I'm in love  
  
Got a song that I sing  
I can make the rain go  
Any time I move my finger  
Lucky me, can't you see I'm in love?  
  
Life's a beautiful thing  
Long as I hold the string  
I'd be a silly so and so  
If I should ever let go  
  
Got the world on a string  
I'm sitting on a rainbow  
Got fat silly string tied around my finger  
What a world, what a life, I'm in love  
  
Got the world on a string  
I'm sitting on a rainbow  
Got fat silly string tied around my finger  
What a world, what a life, I'm in love
