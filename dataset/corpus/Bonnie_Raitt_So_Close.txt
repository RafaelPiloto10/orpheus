So far  
There was not a second thought  
No heart  
Ever got close enough  
You are  
Watching as I am caught  
In a moment off-guard  
  
So close  
I can nearly taste it  
Suppose  
This is that one promised love  
God knows  
All that I've wasted now  
Never letting it start  
  
Now all my resistance  
I feel it slip away  
Now all of the distance  
Ever less with every day by day  
  
So far  
There was no connection  
No spark  
Out of which a fire grows  
I start  
In your direction I'm  
Ever so close  
  
Now all my resistance  
I feel it slip away  
Now all of the distance  
Ever less with every day by day  
  
So far, I have never been  
So close
