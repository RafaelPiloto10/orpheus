We are the pain  
We are the shame  
We've gone insane  
Inside where no ones around  
  
I am to blame, for everything  
I like this game, that you all  
make me play  
  
I'm done being there for others  
They have their pain and so do I  
Don't need to feel it all over  
I try to hold on and you bring me down  
  
We are estranged  
We are deranged  
I can't explain  
How you all break me apart  
  
I am to blame, for everything  
I like this game, that you all  
make me play  
  
I'm done being there for others  
They have their pain and so do I  
Don't need to feel it all over  
I try to hold on and you bring me down  
  
We wait, we hate  
We try to get away  
Mistake my pain  
It has been lead astray  
I'm Looking around, I drop to the ground  
Why does it have to end this way  
  
Feeling numb, so long  
Oh God it's just everything  
It's everything  
Now I pray for all of them to go away!  
  
I'm done being there for others  
They have their pain and so do I  
Don't need to feel it all over  
I try to hold on and you bring me down
