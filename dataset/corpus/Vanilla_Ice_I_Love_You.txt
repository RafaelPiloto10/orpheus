[Verse 1]  
Girl, I keep thinkin' of how I feel  
When I'm in your arms gives me a chill  
Just knowin' that you want me by your side  
Mellows my mind and enhances my pride  
Girl, I need you more and more each day  
Believe me when I tell you I'm here to stay  
I'm captured by your love and your pretty smile  
You devastating beauty and your sweet profile  
[Chorus]  
I love you, cause I love you  
I love you, cause I love you  
[Verse 2]  
You're so fine, let's wine and dine  
I'm so happy that you are mine  
Thinking of you I melt with desire  
Take you in my arms, let love take us higher  
To hear you talk, sounds so sweet  
When you're close to me I feel your heat  
Girl, I want you and you want me  
And it'll last until eternity  
You're like the snow fallin' from the sky  
So clean, like the look in your eye  
You're my queen, i'll buy you everything  
Yes, girl, even diamond rings  
Cause you're my lady, and this love is true  
Every sunset makes me think of you  
And i'll never forget what you mean to me  
Comin' straight from the heart of vanilla i-see-e  
Chorus  
[Outro]  
Hello girl, when I first saw you. it was love at first sight  
We've been goin' out now for about two years and I still feel the same  
I know I haven't said it much before...well...it's because  
See, I get all choked up inside. it just doesn't want to  
Come out. I don't know. maybe this'll help all the bad  
Things i've done. so, no matter what goes on, no matter  
What happens, always remember...I love you!
