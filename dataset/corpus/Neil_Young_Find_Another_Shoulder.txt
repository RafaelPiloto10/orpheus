I told you babe once before  
Don't want you hangin'  
Around my door  
You better find another shoulder  
Find another shoulder  
Find another shoulder  
'Cause honey,  
I don't love you anymore.  
  
I told you babe, you're no good,  
Don't want you  
Messin' up my neighborhood.  
You better find another shoulder  
Find another shoulder, babe  
Find another shoulder  
'Cause honey,  
I don't love you anymore.  
  
Ah, here's your  
Ticket for the coast,  
Start light,  
Leave here baby,  
Stay out of sight.  
You better find another shoulder  
Find another shoulder  
Find another shoulder  
'Cause honey,  
I don't love you anymore.  
  
Find another shoulder  
Find another shoulder  
You better find another shoulder  
'Cause honey,  
I don't love you anymore.  
  
I told you baby, once before  
Don't want you messin'  
Outside my door  
You better find another shoulder  
Find another shoulder  
Find another shoulder  
'Cause honey,  
I don't love you anymore.
