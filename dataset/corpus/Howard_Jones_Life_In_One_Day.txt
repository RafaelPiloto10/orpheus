The old man said to me  
Said don't always take life so seriously  
Play the flute  
And dance and sing your song  
  
Try and enjoy the here and now  
The future will take care of itself somehow  
The grass is never greener over there  
Time will wear away the stone  
Gets the hereditary bone  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't try to live your life in one day  
Don't go speed your time away  
Don't try to live your life in one day  
Don't go speed your time away  
  
The old man said to me  
Said you can't change the world single handedly  
Raise a glass enjoy the scenery  
Pretend the water is champagne  
And fill my glass again and again  
While the wolves are gathering round your door  
Time will wear away the stone  
Gets the hereditary bone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The old man said to me  
Said don't always take life so seriously  
Play the flute  
And dance and sing your song  
  
Try and enjoy the here and now  
The future will take care of itself somehow  
The grass is never greener over there  
Time will wear away the stone  
Gets the hereditary bone  
  
I tried to live my life in one day  
Don't go speed your time away  
  
I bit off more than I can chew  
Only so much you can do  
  
Wolves are gathering round my door  
Ask them in and invite some more  
  
I tried to live my life in one day  
Don't go speed your time away  
  
Don't try to live your life in one day
