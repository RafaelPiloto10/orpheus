There's a star for everyone  
Brightly shining in the sky  
It seems to be a part of our destiny  
Every night I eagerly,  
  
Watch them all go twinkling by  
But I can't seem to find the one the heavens  
Assigned to me...  
Friendly star, where could you be hiding  
  
Smile for me from out of the lonely night  
Friendly star, my fate needs deciding  
How I need the glow of your guiding light  
I know that you are near, for I am strangely dreamy  
  
And so if you can see me from afar  
Won't you kindly, light my way  
Lead me to my lover, Just point him out, And whisper,  
"There you are, there you are"  
  
Then my love, you will be  
Standing here, close to me  
In your eyes, I will see my friendly star.
