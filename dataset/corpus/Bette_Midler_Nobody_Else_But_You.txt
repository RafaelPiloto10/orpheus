Who loves me even though I'm crazy  
And nothing that I say is true?  
Who won my heart and soul forever?  
It's nobody else but  
Nobody else but...  
  
Each time I feel I'm out to pasture  
Who always makes me feel brand new?  
I'm pledging my allegiance baby  
To nobody else but  
Nobody else but...  
  
Look at me, laughing out lou  
Trying to remember all the jokes that you taught me  
When you see the light in my eyes  
It's only a reflection of the joy that you brought me  
  
How did I get to be so happy?  
I've wondered that my whole life through, yeah  
I thank my lucky stars for sending me  
Nobody else but, nobody else but  
Nobody else but you  
  
La, la, la, la, you, yeah  
La, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la  
  
Look at me, laughing out loud  
Trying to remember all the jokes that you taught me  
When you see the love in my eyes  
It's only a reflection of the joy that you brought me  
  
I always knew I had an angel  
A voice that told me what to do, yeah  
But now that angel's on my shoulder  
It's nobody else but, nobody else but  
Nobody else but you  
  
La, la, la, la, you, yeah  
La, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, woah  
La, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la...
