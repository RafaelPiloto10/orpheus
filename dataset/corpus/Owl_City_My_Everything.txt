When my hope is lost  
And my strength is gone  
I run to you, and you alone  
When I can't get up and I can't go on  
I run to you, and you alone  
'Cause you're my light in the dark  
And I sing with all of my heart  
  
Hallelujah  
My almighty God divine  
Hallelujah  
I am yours and you are mine  
This is all I know I will say  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
You're my everything  
  
When I'm plagued with pain  
And filled with fear  
I run to you, and you alone  
When my days are few  
And death is near  
I run to you, and you alone  
'Cause you're my light in the dark  
And I sing with all of my heart  
  
Hallelujah  
My almighty God divine  
Hallelujah  
I am yours and you are mine  
This is all I know I will say  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
  
When trouble comes and goes  
And when the cold wind blows  
I lift my hands up, I lift my hands up  
When sorrow knocks me down  
And you pick me off the ground  
I lift my hands up, I lift my hands up  
  
And I sing, Hallelujah  
My almighty God divine  
Hallelujah  
I am yours, and you are mine  
This is all I know I will say  
  
Hallelujah  
By the grace of God above  
Hallelujah  
Our shining light to shine above  
This is all I know I will say  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
This is all I know I will say  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
You're my everything  
  
Ohh ohh, you're my everything
