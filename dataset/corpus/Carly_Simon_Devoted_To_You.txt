Darlin' you can count on me  
Till the sun dries up the sea  
Until then I'll always be devoted to you  
  
I'll be yours through endless time  
I'll adore your charms sublime  
Guess by now you know that I'm devoted to you  
  
I'll never hurt you, I'll never lie  
I'll never be untrue  
I'll never give you reason to cry  
I'd be unhappy if you were blue  
  
Through the years my love will grow  
Like a river it will flow  
It can't die because I'm so devoted to you  
  
I'll never hurt you, I'll never lie  
I'll never be untrue  
I'll never give you reason to cry  
I'd be unhappy if you were blue  
  
Through the years my love will grow  
Like a river it will flow  
It can't die because I'm so devoted to you
