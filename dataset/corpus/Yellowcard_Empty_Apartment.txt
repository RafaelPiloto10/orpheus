Call me out  
You stayed inside  
One you love  
Is where you hide  
Shot me down  
As I flew by  
Crash and burn  
I think sometimes  
You forget where the heart is  
Answer no  
To these questions  
Let her go  
Learn a lesson  
It's not me  
You're not listening now  
Can't you see  
Something's missing  
You forget where the heart is  
  
Take you away  
From that empty apartment  
You stay  
And forget where the heart is  
Someday  
If ever you loved me  
You'd say  
It's okay  
  
Waking up  
From this nightmare  
How's you're life  
What's it like there  
Is it all  
That you want it to be  
Does it hurt  
When you think about me  
And how broken my heart is  
  
Take you away  
From that empty apartment  
You stay  
And forget where the heart is  
Someday  
If ever you loved me  
You'd say it's okay  
  
It's okay to be angry and never let go  
It only gets harder the more that you know  
When you get lonely if no one's around,  
You know that I'll catch you when you're falling down  
We came together but you left alone  
And I know how it feels to walk out on your own  
Maybe someday I will see you again  
And you'll look me in my eyes and call me your friend  
  
Take you away from  
That empty apartment  
You stay and forget where the heart is  
Someday  
If ever you loved me  
You'd say it's okay  
It's okay it's okay
