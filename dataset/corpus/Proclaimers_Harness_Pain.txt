You need to harness pain  
To raise yourself up again  
You need to harness pain  
And tell the truth about love  
  
You need to break your heart  
Before you can really start  
You need to break your heart  
And tell the truth about love  
  
Then you need to set a goal  
That you can't reach  
Then you have to attack  
Defenses you can't breach  
  
Then you need to lose  
And lose and lose again  
If you want to hold the flame  
You harness pain, you harness pain  
  
You need to take your doubts  
And spread them all about  
You need to face your doubts  
To tell the truth about love  
  
You know the cliches wrong  
Hatred is just as strong  
You know it's just as strong  
Just as strong as love  
  
So you need to take your hate  
And doubt and fear  
Distill them through your word  
'Til they run clear  
  
'Til they run right through your heart  
Like Highland rain  
If you want to hold the flame  
You harness pain, you harness pain  
  
Do you want to be the best  
Or be well known?  
Do you want to repeat lines  
Or write your own?  
  
Do you want to follow paths  
Or blaze a trail?  
When you try to succeed  
You mostly fail  
  
And you're gonna lose  
And lose and lose again  
If you want to hold the flame  
You harness pain, you harness pain
