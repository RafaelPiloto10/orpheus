I feel world is cheatin'  
My heart is barely beatin'  
Like alone wolf in the pack  
  
No one to believe in  
Tryin' to fight these demons  
Where I'm going's where I'm at  
  
Like high plains drifters  
And midnight misters  
Dancin' with the devil's rock n roll  
Dirt poor playboys  
And drug store cowboys  
Hey, rebel soul  
  
I've been a man of reason  
Only to end up even  
I've paid the price of givin' back  
  
Low down and double dealing  
Up on the mountain kneeling  
I fell your love is just a trap  
  
Like high plains drifters  
And midnight misters  
Siftin' though the devil's pot o' gold  
Dirt poor playboys  
And drug store cowboys  
Hey, rebel soul  
Rebel soul  
  
I feel just like I'm trapped by nighttime  
I sleep with one eye open in the day  
I've walked the wrong way but I've walked a long way  
  
Hey, rebel soul  
  
Touched by the hand of treason  
I'm through with not believin'  
I'm leavin' town my bags are packed  
  
And if you feel the need when  
You finally find your feelings  
You'll know just where to find me at  
  
With high plains drifters  
And midnight misters  
Dancin' with the devil's rock n roll  
Dirt poor playboys  
And drug store cowboys  
Hey, rebel soul  
Rebel soul  
Rebel soul  
Oh, rebel soul  
Rebel soul  
Rebel soul  
Rebel soul  
Oh, rebel soul
