[Verse 1:]  
Lately I've been thinkin'  
Thinking 'bout you  
And all the things  
I've seen you go through  
Your mother the kids and  
The problems at home  
Sorry I wish I could fix what's wrong  
I hurt when you hurt and  
I cry when you cry  
Even the deep ones  
Sometimes wonder why am I going through  
I'm waiting but still no use  
  
[Chorus:]  
He's still in control  
He's sovereign and He knows  
Just how it feels to be afraid  
Have folk you love walk away  
Be still and know He's still in control  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Lately depression  
Your job and your life  
Weighs on your mind  
All day and all night  
You know every scripture  
And what prayer to pray  
Only a fool would think  
It'll all go away  
But there is a use  
For you there's a plan  
A High Priest who knows  
And who understands what you cannot say  
Just a little longer can you wait  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Bridge:]  
Don't know what tomorrow will bring  
Or if this sickness will ever leave  
You can paint a perfect picture  
But will it ever look like it used to be  
See, one thing I know for sure  
This season made you stronger and more mature  
Can't you see how far you've come  
And when you look back  
It's gonna be worth it, oooh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He's still in control  
He's still in control  
He's still in control  
[repeat and fade out]
