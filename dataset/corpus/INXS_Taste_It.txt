Yes it's me  
I am the one  
To make you see  
Where we belong  
I was shaking  
Like a leaf  
All wrapped up  
In my dirty sheets  
If I agree to what comes next  
I would be faking  
With the best of them  
It seems a crime  
I would commit  
Without the difference  
Of all the world's gifts  
  
Sweet sweet sweet  
Could you taste it  
  
Never never never  
Never never never (taste it)  
To dream  
All the time  
Without a scream  
In the dead of night  
All those faces  
Come back to me  
I'll be begging  
To swim that sea  
Yea I made  
A picture story  
Make you cry  
In all your glory  
A need to quench  
The thirst of many  
To justify  
And make ready  
  
Sweet sweet sweet  
Could you taste it  
  
Never never never (taste it)  
Never never never (taste it)  
Never never never (taste it)  
Never never never (taste it)  
  
This realization  
Owes us strength to show  
If you're uncertain  
You're invited to believe  
These are the words I speak  
These are the words I speak  
  
A dislocation  
From where we once came from  
Give sons and daughters  
Because we want to go on  
  
These are the words she speaks  
These are the words she speaks  
  
Sweet sweet sweet  
Could you taste it  
  
Never never never (taste it)  
Never never never (taste it)  
Never never never (taste it)  
Never never never (taste it)  
  
Never never never  
Never never never
