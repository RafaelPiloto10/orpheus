I met him on a Monday and my heart stood still  
Da doo ron ron ron  
Da doo ron ron  
Somebody told me that his name was Bill  
Da doo ron ron ron

Yeah, my heart stood still  
Yeah, his name was Bill  
And when he walked me home  
Da doo ron ron ron  
Da doo ron ron  
  
Yeah, he looked so fine  
Yeah, I'll make him mine  
And when he walked me home  
Da doo ron ron ron  
Da doo ron ron  
  
Yeah da doo ron ron  
Da doo ron ron ron
