I'm an outdoor kinda man and I really love the land  
From the mountains of Montana to the Alabama sand  
I don't care much about tv 'cause there's country yet to see  
I'd rather be on the lake with a fishin' friend  
I'm an outdoor kinda man  
  
Give me a cane pole and a shotgun  
And I can have a whole lotta fun  
A soft ole pair of hikin' boots  
A pocket knife and a campfire too  
You go out in the woods alone wonder where the big buck's roam  
What's that noise and your heart beats fast  
Then you smile when a squirrel runs past  
I don't have to get a bear just want to breathe that country air  
I'm goin' out every time I can  
I'm an outdoor lovin' man  
  
I'm an outdoor lovin' man I really love the land  
From the rugged Maine coastline to the Florida Keys sand  
I don't care much about tv 'cause there's country I ain't seen  
I'd rather be on the lake with a fishin' friend  
I'm an outdoor lovin' man  
  
I want a mountaintop and a wheat field  
A cool clear lake, a rod and a reel  
A four-wheeler, a ride on a bike  
A horseback trip, a snowshoe hike  
  
The concrete jungle I don't want, I'd rather be out in the swamp  
My job's got me tied up so I dream of where the red fern grow  
This weekend I'll find where the river bends and the fish jump high  
I'll be there every time I can  
I'm an outdoor kinda man  
  
I'm an outdoor lovin' man and I really love the land  
From the rugged Maine coastline to the Alabama sand  
All the talk shows on tv they don't do a whole lot for me  
I'd rather be in a deer stand I'm an outdoor lovin' man  
  
I'd rather be on the lake with a fishin' friend  
I'm an outdoor kinda man
