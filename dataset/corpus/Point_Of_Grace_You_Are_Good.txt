When the sun starts to rise and I open my eyes  
You are good, so good  
In the heat of the day with each stone that I lay  
You are good, so good  
  
With every breath I take in  
I'll tell You I am grateful again  
When the moon rises high before each kiss goodnight  
You are good  
  
When the road starts to turn around each bend I've learned  
You are good, so good  
And when somebody's hand holds me up, helps me stand  
You are so good  
  
With every breath I take in  
I'll tell You I'm grateful again  
Cause it's more than enough just to know I am loved  
And You are good  
  
So how can I thank You and what can I bring?  
What can a poor man lay at the feet of a King?  
So I'll sing You a love song it's all that I have  
To tell You I'm grateful for holding my life in Your hands  
  
When it's dark and it's cold and I can't feel my soul  
You are still good  
When the world is gone gray and the rain's here to stay  
You are still good  
  
With every breath I take in  
I'll tell You I am grateful again  
And the storm may swell even then it is well  
And You are good  
  
So how can I thank You, what can I bring?  
What can a poor man lay at the feet of a King?  
I'll sing You this love song, it's all that I have  
To tell You I'm grateful for holding my life in Your hands  
  
So I'll sing You a love song it's all that I have  
To tell You I'm grateful for holding my life in Your hands  
You are holding my life in Your hands
