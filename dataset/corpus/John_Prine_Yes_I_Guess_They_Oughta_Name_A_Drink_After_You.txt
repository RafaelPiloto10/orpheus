Oh I get drunk most every night, seems like all we do is fight  
The more I drink, the less I feel blue  
Sometimes I feel like an awful fool  
Spendin' my life on an old bar stool  
And yes I guess they oughta name a drink after you  
[Incomprehensible]  
If this date were to be our last, I'd never sit down this glass  
It'd take all the booze in the world to forget you  
You've left my heart a vacant lot, I'll fill it with another shot  
And yes I guess they oughta name a drink after you  
[Incomprehensible]  
Looks like I had my fill, guess I better pay my bill  
When I started out I only meant to have a few  
Someone just said that you left town, I better get a double round  
And yes I guess they oughta name a drink after you  
Yes I guess they oughta name a drink after you
