I don't know when it got this way  
I don't know how long she's gonna stay  
Every week it's the same in her room  
That's why I came  
  
Here I go, I go again  
Our rendezvous never seem to end  
I know where I'll be, I'll make this confession  
Back in her bed for another goddamn session  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll never learn  
God knows I try  
Keep coming back for session  
And I don't know why  
I'll never learn, I'll never see  
Just tell me why these sessions got a hold on me  
  
Some might say it's a fling  
For all I know it don't mean a thing  
Either way I can't complain  
Ain't no strings  
Guess I got it made  
  
Here I go, I go again  
Our rendezvous' never seem to end  
I know where I'll be  
I'll make this confession  
Back in her bed for another goddamn session  
  
[Chorus]
