So you think you'll take another piece of me  
To satisfy your intellectual need  
Do you want, do you want...Action?  
Gonna bring you down cause you're pushin' me  
You gotta recognize my superiority  
Liar, liar  
You know you believed it  
Liar, liar  
'Cause I'm the main man  
And that's why  
Everybody wants a piece of the action  
Everybody needs a main attraction  
I got what everybody needs  
Satisfaction guaranteed  
Everybody wants a piece of the action  
I was suicidal cause she was my idol  
Baby baby baby bring it to your knees  
Well there was a time I would have walked the line  
Don't you bring me down with your insatiable greed  
Liar, liar  
You know you believe me  
Liar, liar  
Cause I'm the main man  
And that's why  
Everybody wants a piece of the action  
Everybody needs a main attraction  
I got what everybody needs  
Satisfaction guaranteed  
Everybody wants a piece of the action  
Do you want  
Action! Action!  
Everybody wants, everybody needs  
Everybody wants, everybody needs  
Repeat Bridge and Chorus
