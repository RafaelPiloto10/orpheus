Many's the time I looked in the water  
And had no reflection to show  
Oh and many's the time I stood at the crossroads  
Not knowing which way to go  
  
Many's the time someone laid close beside me  
But I don't remember her name mmm mmm  
They'll say that I'm just a smile in the moment  
But that was before you came  
  
You're the one in a million you're the one you're the one  
You're the one in a million I see  
You're the one in a million you're the one you're the one  
You're the one in a million for me  
  
Now of all of the others were places to go to  
When I had nowhere to sleep mmm mmm  
I never made any promises to them  
None they'd expect me to keep  
  
You're the one in a million you're the one you're the one  
You're the one in a million I see  
You're the one in a million you're the one you're the one  
You're the one in a million for me  
  
You're the one when the day is done  
You're my morning sun Yes you're the one
