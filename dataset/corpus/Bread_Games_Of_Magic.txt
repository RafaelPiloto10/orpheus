First time it's rained since I came to the city  
Seemed like a good time to write  
And even now as I look out my window  
Rain clouds are chasing the light  
  
The play games of magic in the night  
  
Lately I've stayed with the lady from Denver  
She said to come by for awhile  
Took me on down to her place by the river  
Carried me off on her smile  
  
We play games of magic all the while  
  
I hope this letter finds you well  
I wrote to tell you 'bout my change of plans  
I won't be home tomorrow night  
I'll be alright I hope you'll understand  
  
All of my life I've been looking for somethin'  
But I guess you know me by now  
Searching for secrets and being the eternal child  
Playing games of magic all the while.
