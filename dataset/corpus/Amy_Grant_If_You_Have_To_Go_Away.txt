When I was a younger  
I used to dream a lot  
Staring into my coffee  
About how you'd love me  
And write me poetry  
And want to be with me, yeah  
Well, momma done told me  
You might wander far, yeah  
But nobody warned me  
The road would own your heart  
  
And so I'm saying  
If you have to go away  
I will be waiting by the phone  
And if you have to go away  
I'll put your records on  
Pretend you're still at home  
  
Now that I'm older  
I sit at home a lot  
With the kid we've got, yeah  
The radio's playing  
He really loves his wife  
I hear the D.J. saying  
Well momma done told me  
You might wander far, oh  
As long as you hold me  
More than you hold that guitar  
  
I'll keep on saying  
If you have to go away  
I'll leave your shoes beside the bed  
And if you have to go away  
I'll want to be with you  
I'll be with me instead  
If you have to go away  
I won't be sleeping very well  
But if you have to go away  
I'll be loving you  
Till it's cold in hell  
  
Maybe you'll write me this time  
Maybe you'll call on a static line  
Saying don't you ever worry your pretty mind  
Cause you and me are gonna be fine  
  
And so I'm saying  
If you have to go away  
I will be waiting by the phone  
And if you have to go away  
I'll put your records on  
Pretend you're still at home  
  
If you have to go away  
I'll leave your shoes beside the bed  
And if you have to go away  
I'll want to be with you  
I'll be with me instead  
If you have to go away  
I won't be sleeping very well  
But if you have to go away  
I'll be loving you  
I'll be loving you  
If you have to go away
