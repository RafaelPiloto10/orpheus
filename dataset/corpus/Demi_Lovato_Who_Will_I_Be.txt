Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!  
  
How to choose?  
Who to be?  
Well, let's see  
There are so many choices now.  
Play guitar, be a movie star.  
In my head, a voice says  
Why not, try everything?  
Why stop, reach for any dream?  
I can rock, cause it's my life.  
And now's the time  
  
[Chorus]  
Who will I be?  
It's up to me  
All the never ending possibilities  
That I can see  
There's nothing that I can't do  
Who will I be?  
Yes, I believe  
I get to make the future what I want to  
If I can become anyone and know the choice is up to me  
Who will I be?  
  
Yeah yeah  
  
If I decide,  
I'm the girl to change the world  
I can do it any time.  
Opportunity right in front of me  
And the choice is all mine  
  
Why not, try everything?  
Why stop, reach for any dream?  
I can rock, cause it's my life.  
And now's the time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I wanna find the who I am inside.  
Who will I be?  
I wanna show the, the way that I can shine  
Yeah, Oh yeah, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Who will I be?  
Who will I be!
