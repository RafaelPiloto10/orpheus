[Verse 1]  
In Britain's Georgian times  
There were so many crimes  
No time to hang each crook guilty of a felony  
Cos there's no room to jail you  
They'd send you to Australia  
To live in our new-fangled penal colony  
Think that sounds like heaven?  
In 1787, it wasn't that kind of once in a lifetime trip  
First fleet took the journey  
Months at sea so churny  
Over 40 died while they were on the ship  
  
[Chorus]  
Those that lived were plucky  
Plucky, plucky, plucky  
Crammed on board with rats and vermin, cockroaches in bed  
Stench inside was sicky  
Yucky, yucky, icky  
Lice not very nice, can't get them out of my head  
  
[Verse 2]  
Landed Bay of Botany  
Convicts' life was rotteny  
Needed food and shelter but everything failed  
Threes too strong for felling  
Stagnant water smelling  
A real step back in time in New South Wales  
Soil too poor for budding  
Huts washed up by flooding  
Plans for building houses came to sticky ends  
The best of all their labours  
Attacked by local neighbours  
And that is when your neighbours don't become good friends  
  
[Chorus]  
Situation tricky  
Tricky, tricky, tricky  
Then a second fleet of ships was due aground  
Some thought this was lucky  
But illness had strucky  
Half were dead or I'll  
Fever was spinning around  
  
[Verse 3]  
After seven years  
Convict record clears  
Just one catch  
You got to pay your own way back  
No wages meant no money  
No choice, but what's funny  
Many stayed, became farmers and made a stack  
Original arrivers  
Proved hardy survivors  
Sydney turned into a place you'd choose to go  
Think that they'd be fairer  
To convicts who were sent there?  
No way they built prisons even more remote  
  
[Verse 4]  
Port Arthur was one of the jails  
Where every escape attempt fails  
Was one man who nearly got through  
Billy Hunt dressed as a kangaroo  
  
[Chorus]  
Inmate's life still sucky  
Sucky, sucky, sucky  
Life behind bars was not very nice  
Hideous and messy  
Who would ever guessy  
This hellhole would become a  
Holiday paradise?
