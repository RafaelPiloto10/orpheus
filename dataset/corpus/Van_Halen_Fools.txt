Well, I ain't about to go to school.  
And I'm sick and tired of golden rules.  
They say I'm crazy, from the wrong side of the tracks.  
I never see them, but they're always on my back.  
Well, I'm sick and tired of cleaning room.  
And it's the final bell for pushing broom.  
Damned if I do, and then I'm damned if I don't.  
Won't someone tell me what it is they all want?  
It makes me blue!  
Ooh, I live with fools!  
Ooh, it makes me blue!  
Ooh, I live with fools!  
I just can't take it!  
My teachers all gave up on me.  
No matter what they say, I disagree.  
And when I need something to soothe my soul,  
I listen to too much rock 'n' roll.  
Don't want no class reunion.  
This circus just left town.  
Why behave in public if you're  
Livin' on a playground?  
It makes me blue!  
Ooh, I live with fools!  
Ooh, it makes me blue!  
Ooh, I live with fools!
