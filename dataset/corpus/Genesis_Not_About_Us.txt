A little piece of something  
Falling gently down down down  
No one understands you like I do  
  
I'd rather be beside you  
Everything we know so well  
Tell me what you feel now  
Show me what you think of it  
  
It's not about us anymore  
It's all about the reasons  
That we think we're fighting for  
It's not about hate  
It's not about pain we always feel  
I know we have our problems  
But we're not the only ones  
It's not about you it's not about me  
It's not about anger  
It's more about the loneliness we feel  
  
How can I begin to  
Ask for some forgiveness  
For all that we have taken  
There's nothing left now  
  
Just a little piece of something  
Falling gently down down down  
No one understands you no no  
Like I do  
There's nothing left now  
  
It's not about us anymore  
It's all about the reasons  
That we think we're fighting for  
It's not about hate  
It's not about pain we always feel  
I know we have our problems  
But we're not the only ones  
It's not about you it's not about me  
It's not about anger  
It's more about the loneliness we feel  
  
It's not about us  
It's not about hate  
It's more about the loneliness we feel, can you feel it  
It's not about anger  
It's not about wanting  
I know we have our problems  
But we're not the only ones, we're not the only ones  
It's not about you, it's not about me
