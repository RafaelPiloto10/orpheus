Well there's a bridge and there's a river that I still must cross  
As I'm going on my journey  
Oh, I might be lost  
  
And there's a road I have to follow, a place I have to go  
Well no-one told me just how to get there  
But when I get there I'll know  
'Cause I'm taking it  
  
[Chorus]  
Step by step, bit by bit,  
Stone by stone (yeah), brick by brick (oh, yeah)  
Step by step, day by day, mile by mile (ooh, ooh, ooh)  
  
And this old road is rough and ruined  
So many dangers along the way  
So many burdens might fall upon me  
So many troubles that I have to face  
  
Oh, but I won't let my spirit fail me  
Oh, I won't let my spirit go  
Until I get to my destination  
I'm gonna take it slowly 'cause I'm making it mine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Say it, baby, don't give up  
You got to hold on to what you got,  
Oh, baby, don't give up,  
You got to keep on moving on don't stop (yeah yeah).  
I know you're hurting, and I know you're blue,  
I know you're hurting but don't let the bad things get to you.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(C'mon baby got to keep moving),  
I'm taking it step by step), bit by bit,  
Stone by stone (yeah, stone by stone), brick by brick  
C'mon baby,  
Step by step keep on moving, day by day (day by day-ee),  
Mile by mile by mile by mile,go your own way,  
C'mon baby got to keep moving, bit by bit (bit by bit, bit by bit)
