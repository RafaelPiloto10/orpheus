I'll be on the next train.  
See you at dawn.  
A picture of us in the rain  
Look and it's gone  
  
Do you want my love or do want something I can't give you?  
How can I be sure that what you said before had been true?  
  
Auh hah hah. Will we ever. Be the same?  
Auh hah hah Will we ever?  
  
Burning with these mixed emotions thinking of you  
Are you out there somewhere?  
Burning with these mixed emotions thinking of you  
Are you out there somewhere?  
  
Looking at the red, red sky thinking it through  
Twenty-Seven days and nights since I saw you  
Am I just a fool for wanting all of your attention?  
So tell me if I'm right or heading in the wrong direction?  
  
Auh hah hah. Will we ever. Be the same?  
Auh hah hah. Will we ever?  
  
Burning with these mixed emotions thinking of you  
Are you out there somewhere?  
Burning with these mixed emotions thinking of you  
Are you out there somewhere?  
  
Don't leave me with these mixed emotions and dreaming of you  
Are you out there somewhere?  
Burning with these mixed emotions thinking of you  
Hope you are out there somewhere  
  
Is our love, Is our love an illusion. Will it fly away?  
Is our love, Is our love an illusion. Watch it fly away  
It's all of, it's all of an illusion. (4x)  
  
Auh hah hah. (2x)  
Burning with these mixed emotions thinking of you  
Are you out there somewhere?  
Burning with these mixed emotions thinking of you  
Are you out there somewhere?  
Don't leave me with these mixed emotions and dreaming of you  
Are you out there somewhere?  
Don't leave me with these mixed emotions and dreaming of you  
Are you out there somewhere?  
Burning with these mixed emotions thinking of you  
Are you out there somewhere?  
Auh hah hah
