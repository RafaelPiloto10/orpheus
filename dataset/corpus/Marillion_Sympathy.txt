Now when you climb into your bed tonight  
And when you lock and bolt the door  
Just think of those out in the cold and dark  
'Cause there's not enough love to go 'round  
No there's not enough love to go 'round  
  
And sympathy is what we need my friends  
And sympathy is what we need  
And sympathy is what we need my friends  
'Cause there's not enough love to go 'round  
No there's not enough love to go 'round  
  
Now half the world hates the other half  
And half the world has all the food  
And half the world lies down and quietly starves  
'Cause there's not enough love to go 'round  
No there's not enough love to go 'round  
  
And sympathy is what we need my friends  
And sympathy is what we need  
And sympathy is what we need my friends  
'Cause there's not enough love to go 'round  
No there's not enough love  
No there's not enough love to go 'round
