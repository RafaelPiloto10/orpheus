Day after day I must face a world of strangers  
Where I don't belong, I'm not that strong  
It's nice to know that there's someone I can turn to  
Who will always care, you're always there  
When there's no getting over that rainbow  
When my smallest of dreams won't come true  
I can take all the madness the world has to give  
But I won't last a day without you  
So, many times when the city seems to be without  
A friendly face, a lonely place  
It's nice to know that you'll be there if I need you  
And you'll always smile, it's all worthwhile  
When there's no getting over that rainbow  
When my smallest of dreams won't come true  
I can take all the madness the world has to give  
But I won't last a day without you  
Touch me and I end up singing  
Troubles seem to up and disappear  
You touch me with the love you're bringing  
I can't really lose when you're near, when you're near  
And love, if all my friends have forgotten half their promises  
They're not unkind, just hard to find  
One look at you and I know that I could learn to live  
Without the rest, I found the best  
When there's no getting over that rainbow  
When my smallest of dreams won't come true  
I can take all the madness the world has to give  
But I won't last a day without you  
No, I won't last a day without you  
Can't last a day without you
