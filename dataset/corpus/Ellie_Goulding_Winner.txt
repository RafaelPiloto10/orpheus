[Verse 1]  
Let's call it a day, babe  
I think I know what you're trying to say  
Honey, it's fair play  
Why try to win when I know I've lost?  
We don't have to spell it  
I think I know what you're trying to say  
Just because I think this could break me  
It doesn't mean that it will at all  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Love to the lovers  
Hate to the haters  
Love to you, babe  
Do what you have to  
  
[Chorus]  
What a shame  
What a loss  
The winner takes  
She takes it all  
What a shame  
What a loss  
But I can see why  
Because she's beautiful  
What a defeat  
To say the least  
But thank God  
The love is free  
And maybe it's good for you  
It's good for me  
  
[Verse 2]  
Let's call it a day, babe  
I think I know what you're trying to say  
And honey you're so right  
There's so much to lose, but so much to learn  
Let's call it a maybe  
But we both know you're already gone  
And just because it feels like I'm breaking  
It doesn't mean I will fall apart  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Love to the lovers  
Hate to the haters  
Love to you, babe  
Do what you have to  
  
[Chorus]  
What a shame  
What a loss  
The winner takes  
She takes it all  
What a shame  
What a loss  
But I can see why  
Because she's beautiful  
What a defeat  
To say the least  
But thank God  
The love is free  
And maybe it's good for you  
It's good for me  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Love to you, babe  
Love to the lovers  
Hate to the haters  
Love to you, babe  
Do what you have to  
  
[Chorus]  
What a shame  
What a loss  
The winner takes  
She takes it all  
What a shame  
What a loss  
But I can see why  
Because she's beautiful  
What a defeat  
To say the least  
But thank God  
The love is free  
And maybe it's good for you  
It's good for me
