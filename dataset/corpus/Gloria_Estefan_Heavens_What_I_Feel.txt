ooooUooooHoooo...Mmmm...Mmm  
Love sometimes  
Can be like Destiny....  
There's no way to say forever  
May not realize your dreams  
And love sometimes  
Is like the blowin' wind  
It can take us to wherever  
Sending us on silent wings  
But I have broken  
All the rules of love...  
I never dreamed that  
I could come this far....  
And now I'm lost in my emotions  
You're becoming my devotion  
There's nothing I can do  
To stop this love for you...  
I was not supposed to  
Fall in love with you  
I have someone else....  
Someone else is loving you  
And I was not supposed to  
Let this love get through  
(let love get through)  
So let me say for real....  
Heaven's what I feel  
When I'm with you...  
(this feeling is forever)  
It is forever...  
(you make me feel like heaven)  
I feel like heaven  
(my love is true when I'm with you...ooh...oooh...you...ooo)  
How could I have  
Known that in your eyes  
(in your eyes)  
I would find the deepest answer  
To the questions of my heart  
And how could I have known  
That by your side  
(by your side)  
Was the light to fill the darkness  
And the shadows of my life  
But I have broken  
All the rules of love  
I never dreamed that I  
Could come this far  
And now I'm lost in my emotion  
You're becoming my devotion  
There's nothing I can do  
To stop this love for you...  
I was not supposed to  
Fall in love with you  
I have someone else....  
Someone else is loving you  
And I was not supposed to  
Let this love get through  
(let love get through)  
So let me say for real....  
Heaven's what I feel....  
When I'm with you....  
(this feeling is forever)  
..oooU..oooU...oooo  
(you make me feel like heaven, my love is true, when I'm with  
you..ooo...ooo..Hoo..Hoo)  
(Heaven....Heaven...)  
Is what I feel  
When Were together  
(Heaven....Heaven...)  
Just look in my eyes and  
You'll see it's the truth.....  
I was not supposed to  
Fall in love with you  
I have someone else....  
And Someone else is loving you  
And I was not supposed to  
Let this love get through  
(let love get through)  
So let me say for real....  
Heaven's what I feel  
When I'm with you......ooUoUoUooo
