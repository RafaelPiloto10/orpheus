Kiss The Future Lyrics:Forgiveness and mercy. in short supply. so lonely, so  
Faithful. no reason why. in my mind at this time. just clear  
Blue sky. your story just starting. now learn to fly.  
It takes a miracle to make you see. my consciousness  
Exploded.  
Your past life. don't suit you. take my hand. kiss the future.  
Let fortune. uproot you. take my hand. kiss the future.  
No time now for sorrow. meet life full-blast. let?s take on  
Tomorrow. forget the past.  
It takes a miracle to make you see. my consciousness  
Exploded.  
Your past life. don't suit you. take my hand. kiss the future.  
Let fortune. uproot you. take my hand. kiss the future.  
It takes a miracle to make you see. my consciousness  
Exploded.  
Your past life. don't suit you. take my hand. kiss the future.  
Let fortune. uproot you. take my hand. kiss the future.  
This is what you came here for. stop the engine slam the  
Door. leave that lonesome corridor.  
Take the plunge and wipe the slate. smile your smile -  
you're feeling great. soon you're going to celebrate.  
Time has gone to hesitate. nothing now can make you  
Wait. take control of your own fate.  
Take tomorrow in your hand. make the others understand.  
One break you must demand.  
Your past life. don't suit you. take my hand. kiss the future.  
Let fortune. uproot you. take my hand. kiss the future.
