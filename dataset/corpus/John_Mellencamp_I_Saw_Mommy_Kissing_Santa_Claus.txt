I saw momma kissin' ol'  
Santa Claus  
Underneath the mistletoe last night  
And she did not hear me creep  
Down the stairs to have a peek  
Why she thought that I was tucked up  
In my bedroom fast asleep  
  
Well let me tell you that  
  
I saw momma tickle ol' Santa Claus  
Underneath his beard so snowy white  
And what a laugh it would have been  
If my daddy would have walked right in  
  
I saw momma kissin' Santa Claus last night  
  
I saw momma Kissin Santa Claus  
Underneath the mistletoe last night  
And she did not see me creep  
Down the stairs to take a peek  
Sure she thought that I was tucked up  
In my bedroom fast asleep  
  
Well let me tell you that  
  
I saw momma tickle ol' Santa Claus  
Underneath his beard so snowy white  
And what a laugh it would have been  
If ol' daddy have just walked in  
  
I saw momma kissin' Santa Claus last night
