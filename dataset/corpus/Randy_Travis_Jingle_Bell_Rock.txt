Bells on bobtails ring, making spirits bright.  
Oh what fun it is to ride and sing a sleigh song tonight.  
  
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock  
Jingle bell swing and jingle bells ring  
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun  
Now the jingle hop has begun  
  
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock  
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time  
Dancing and prancing in jingle bell square  
In the frosty air  
  
What a bright time, it's the right time  
To rock the night away  
Jingle bell time is a swell time  
To go riding in a one-horse sleigh  
  
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet  
Jingle around the clock  
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling beat  
That's the jingle bell rock  
  
Come on  
  
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun  
Now the jingle hop has begun  
Play it again  
  
Dancing and prancing in jingle bell square  
In the frosty air.  
  
What a bright time, it's the right time  
To rock the night away  
Jingle bell time is a swell time  
To go riding riding in a one-horse sleigh  
  
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet  
Jingle around the clock  
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling beat  
That's the jingle bell,  
That's the jingle bell,  
That's the jingle bell rock.  
  
(hey, that was great.)  
(can we do it one more time guys?)"here we go were rolling"  
  
What a bright time, its the right time  
To rock the night away  
Jingle bell time its a swell time  
To go riding on a one-horse sleigh  
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet  
Jingle around the clock  
Mix and mingle in the jinglin' beat  
That's the jungle bell,  
That's the jingle bell,  
That's the jingle bell rock  
  
Jingle, jingle, jingle bell rock  
What a bright time  
Jingle, jingle, jingle bell rock  
Its the right time  
Jingle, jingle, jingle bell rock  
Sing it again now  
Jingle, jingle, jingle bell rock  
Come one now  
Jingle, jingle, jingle bell rock  
Jingle, bell time  
Jingle, jingle, jingle bell rock  
Its swell time
