My name is Drizzy  
And I ain't perfect  
But I work hard  
So I deserve it  
And I belong right where you see me  
I ain't on the fence about it  
I ain't Mr. Feeny  
Naw, I got a decent set of manners  
And a job that fills up any empty schedule or planner  
And I fall in love with girls caught up in superficial glamour  
Who dress like Sarah Jessica and  
Live like Princess Diana  
So often they have addictions and  
I'm no one that'll feed it  
But truly you're bad enough  
That you don't even really need it  
You can show up at the party on dirty public transit  
And I guarantee the camera man will still be snappin  
Candids of you and yo posse partying  
Drinking watch you get handed  
With your virgin island tans  
All lookin like you just landed  
I don't really understand it  
I'm not sure I'm comprehending it  
But these girls are having fun with  
Whoevers money they spending screaming  
  
[Chorus 2x]  
  
I got to be unstoppable  
I got to be unstoppable  
Ey, ey, ey, ey  
You don't lie  
Ey, ey, ey, ey  
You don't lie  
  
[Verse 2:] Weezy F. Baby  
  
My name is Weezy  
I'm almost perfect  
And I work harder than hardworking bizarre circus  
That's when my bars surface  
Therefore, I act a clown  
Even when I'm laying on my back,  
I'm never backing down  
So overstand me  
I gotta condo in Miami and  
My doormat is always sandy  
And I run Louisiana  
But I've never pull a hammy  
And I gotta condo in Atlanta  
And I always wear a bandana  
And when it comes down to stuntin you boys  
Is just buntin  
I'm swinging from the fence  
Yo girl hanging from my dick  
Yo girl singing to my shit  
Like a la, la, lollipop  
She say I get that pussy wetter than a dasani shop  
She say I get that pussy better  
Better than her gynecologist  
Hoe just text me  
Everybody want some mo dick mo dick  
Old bitch  
Young bitch  
But I'll be like damnnnn  
All I got is one dick  
  
[Chorus 2x]  
  
[Bridge:] Santogold  
  
I got the talk  
The beats and bass  
Give me one I'll take it  
Make you lose your place,  
Tell me I-I-I can play  
So I speed up the pace  
I break it break it you can't stop me  
In this ra-race  
  
[Chorus 2x]
