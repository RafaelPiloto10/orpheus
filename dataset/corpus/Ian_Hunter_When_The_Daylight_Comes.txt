Oo-Oo-Oo, Oo-Oo-Oo, Ooooo  
Oo-Oo-Oo, Oo-Oo-Oo, Ooooo  
  
Sweet woman what's your name?  
You smell as fresh as the rain  
Instead of leaving you came  
Let me feel your hair  
  
A light shines in your eyes  
The hungry years are so nice  
Shadows shake in the lamplight  
No writer could explain  
  
But when the daylight comes  
But when the daylight comes  
But when the daylight comes  
I'll be on my way  
  
Oo-Oo-Oo, Oo-Oo-Oo, Ooooo  
Oo-Oo-Oo, Oo-Oo-Oo, Ooooo  
Oo-Oo-Oo, Oo-Oo-Oo, Ooooo, yeah!  
  
Please share my bed and I swear  
That I won't touch you nowhere  
Just need your warmth and your care  
Don't want to mess around  
  
And when the daylight comes  
Yeah when the daylight comes  
Oh when the daylight comes  
I'll be on my way  
  
Yeah when the daylight comes  
Yeah when the daylight comes  
Yeah when the daylight comes  
I'll be on my way  
  
But there's a song in the air  
And it knows that you're there  
'Cause it's making me share  
You with my life  
I know I know I know that  
I want to weave you in words  
Want to paint you in verse  
Want to leave you in someone else's dreams  
It seems the only way, Hey!  
I can thank you, thank you baby  
  
Some people say that we're sinners  
Some people say that we're winners  
We make good gossip at dinners  
They try to pin us down  
  
But when the daylight comes  
Yeah when the daylight comes  
Oh when the daylight comes  
I'll be on my way  
  
Yeah when the daylight comes  
Yeah when the daylight comes  
Oh when the daylight comes  
We'll be on my way  
[Repeat]
