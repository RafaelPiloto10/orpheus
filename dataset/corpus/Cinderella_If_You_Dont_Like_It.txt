I don't need anyone  
To tell me how to run my life  
Got along alright so far  
I don't really think I need to hear your advice  
I've got my mind made up know what I want to do  
I'll do it anyway I choose  
So just sit back shut up for a minute let me show you what I'm gonna do  
  
I ain't got no time to waste on you  
You ain't got no time to give  
Too hung up on all you did  
  
If you don't like it  
If you don't like it I don't care  
If you don't like it  
Hit the road cause I just don't care  
If you don't like it  
If you don't like it I don't care  
If you don't like it  
Hit the road cause I just-just-just don't care  
  
I've seen em come and go  
The kind that do it all for the show  
They got their walkin' talkin' built in jive  
I don't really think they're workin' nine to five  
Take it to your heart gonna tell ya from the start  
Gonna send a word or two your way  
So just sit back take a ride on your pony  
It'll all come back to you one day  
  
I ain't got no time to waste on you  
You ain't got no time to give  
Too hung up on all you did  
  
If you don't like it  
If you don't like it I don't care  
If you don't like it  
Hit the road cause I just don't care  
If you don't like it  
If you don't like it I don't care  
If you don't like it  
Hit the road cause I just-just-just don't care  
  
If you don't like it  
If you don't like it I don't care  
If you don't like it  
Hit the road cause I just don't care  
If you don't like it  
If you don't like it I don't care  
If you don't like it  
Hit the road cause I just don't care  
  
If you don't like it  
If you don't like it I don't care  
If you don't like it  
Hit the road cause I just-just-just don't care  
If you don't like it  
If you don't like it I don't care  
If you don't like it  
Hit the road cause I just don't care
