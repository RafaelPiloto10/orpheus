They can play "let's pretend"  
Make 'em like them my best friend  
Telling their lies  
And they can scheme behind my back  
Make fiction not a fact  
Try to re-write my life  
  
But they ain't got a clue  
If I were in their shoes  
I'd shut right up  
  
Take me as I am  
Or not at all  
I ain't ever gonna change myself for no one  
No compromise  
'Cause it's my life  
It's all or nothing.  
  
They can laugh all they like  
Got no need to justify  
I am who I am  
And they can do their worst if they dare  
If it makes them happy we don't care  
It's out of their hands  
  
'Cause they ain't got a clue  
If we were in their shoes  
We'd shut right up  
  
Take us as we are  
Or not at all  
We ain't ever gonna change ourselves for no one  
No compromise 'cause it's our life  
It's all or nothing.  
  
Take me as I am  
Or not at all  
I ain't ever gonna change myself for no one  
No compromise 'cause it's my life  
It's all or nothing.
