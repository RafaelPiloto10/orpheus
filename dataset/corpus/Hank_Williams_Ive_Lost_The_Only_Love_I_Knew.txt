(d) you ask me why my (d7) hearts so (g) sad,  
And (d) why the teardrops fill my (a7) eyes,  
A (d) heart cant sing thats (d7) filled with (g) pain,  
How (d) can it (a7) laugh when it (d) cries. (d7)  
  
First chorus  
  
I (g) saw my dreams all fade and (d) die,  
Like castles in the (a7) blue,  
Each (d) dawn will bring more (d7) tears and (g) pain,  
Ive (d) lost the (a7) only lovei (d) knew.  
  
Oh, life for me is use- less now,  
It seems so empty and blue,  
Theres no more use to try a - gain,  
I fail in everything I do.  
  
Second chorus  
  
Its hard to know youll never have,  
The one you love so true,  
While the worlds asleep, Ill lay and cry,  
Ive lost the only love I knew.
