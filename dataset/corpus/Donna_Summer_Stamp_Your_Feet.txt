S-T-A-M-P Stampin' on the ground  
S-T-A-M-P Stampin' on the ground  
S-T-A-M-P Stampin' on the ground  
S-T-A-M-P Stampin' on the ground  
  
Woah, yeah  
  
I've been round so many times before  
Broke my back, been split open so oft  
Tried to make it to the finish line  
Been knocked down, get up every single time  
They're up in your face, they don't think you belong  
Man, you got it, you got it goin' on  
What breaks the weak just makes you strong  
You got game, baby bring it on, bring it on  
  
[Chorus:]  
(And) I said Stamp your feet on the ground  
Make it really loud, make the biggest sound  
You ain't goin',  
Stamp your feet on the ground  
Make it really loud  
You ain't going, you ain't goin' down  
Stamp your feet on the ground  
Make it really loud, make the biggest sound  
You ain't goin',  
Stamp your feet on the ground  
Make it really loud  
You ain't goin', you ain't goin' down  
  
Rain comes in every player's life  
Gotta stay in the game, not on the sidelines  
Gotta throw down, you gotta stand and fight  
Keep your eye on the prize, don't get caught up in strife  
Go, go for the shot boy, make that play just right  
Braggin' about your swag won't get you through the night  
  
[Chorus]  
  
S-T-A-M-P You got game  
S-T-A-M-P You got fame  
S-T-A-M-P You got name  
S-T-A-M-P Do that thang  
We ain't going down, oh no!  
Make me proud! Stand up and fight!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Stamp your feet, stamp your feet  
Stamp your feet, stamp your feet  
  
S-T-A-M-P! No, no, no, we ain't goin' down  
S-T-A-M-P! No, no, no, we ain't goin' down  
Right till the ending, we'll make it through life  
Better stamp your feet on the,  
Stamp your feet on the ground
