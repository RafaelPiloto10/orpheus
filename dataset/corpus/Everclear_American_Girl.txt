Well she was an American girl  
Raised on promises  
She couldn't help thinkin' that there  
Was a little more to life  
Somewhere else  
After all it was a great big world  
With lots of places to run to  
Yeah, and if she had to die  
Tryin' she had one little promise  
She was gonna keep  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh yeah, all right  
Take it easy baby  
Make it last all night  
She was an American girl  
  
It was kind of cold that night  
She stood alone on her balcony  
She could the cars roll by  
Out on 441  
Like waves crashin' in the beach  
  
And for one desperate moment there  
He crept back in her memory  
God it's so painful  
Something that's so close  
And still so far out of reach  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh yeah, all right  
Take it easy baby  
Make it last all god damn night  
She was an American girl  
  
American girl  
American girl  
American girl  
American girl  
American girl
