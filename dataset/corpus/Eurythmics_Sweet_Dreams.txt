Sweet dreams are made of this who am I to disagree  
I travel the world and the seven seas  
Everybody's looking for something  
  
Some of them want to use you  
Some of them want to get used by you  
Some of them want to abuse you  
Some of them want to be abused  
  
Ooh...hey...ooh...aha, oh...  
Ooh...hey...ooh...aha, oh...  
  
Ooh...hey...oh...  
Hold your head up, keep your head up, movin' on  
Hold your head up, movin' on  
Keep your head up, movin' on  
Hold your head up, movin' on...
