Well the train I ride  
Is leaving the station  
And the train I ride  
To my destination  
  
I was walking  
Now I'm travelin' in style  
I was walking  
Now I've got me a ride  
  
Well I got no need  
For no company  
Got my blues guitar  
That's all I need  
  
I ain't walking  
Now I'm travelin' in style  
I ain't walking  
Now I've got me a ride  
  
Think I've come to  
The end of my song  
If you feel you want to  
Why don't you sing along  
  
I ain't walking  
Now I'm travelin' in style  
I ain't walking  
Now I've got me a ride  
  
I ain't walking  
Now I'm travelin' in style  
I ain't walking  
Now I've got me a ride  
  
I ain't walking  
Now I'm travelin' in style  
I ain't walking  
Now I've got me a ride.
