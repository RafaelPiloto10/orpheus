They're gonna lay me low (Lay me low)  
They're gonna sink me in the snow  
They're gonna throw back their heads and crow  
When I go  
They're gonna jump and shout (Lay me low)  
They're gonna wave their arms about  
All the stories will come out  
When I go  
All the stars will glow bright (Lay me low)  
And my friends will give up the fight  
They'll see my work in a different light  
When I go  
They'll try telephoning my mother (Lay me low)  
But they'll end up getting my brother  
Who'll spill the story on some long-gone lover  
That I hardly know  
Hats off to the man  
On top of the world  
Come crawl up here, baby  
And I'll show you how it works  
If you wanna be my friend  
And you wanna repent  
And you want it all to end  
And you wanna know when  
Well do it now don't care how  
Take your final bow  
Make a stand Take my hand  
And blow it all to hell  
They gonna inform the police chief (Lay me low)  
Who'll breathe a sigh of relief  
He'll say I was a malanderer, a badlander, and a thief  
When I go  
They will interview my teachers (Lay me low)  
Who'll say I was one of God's sorrier creatures  
There'll print informative six-page features  
When I go  
They'll bang a big old gong (Lay me low)  
The motorcade will be ten miles long  
The world will join together for a farewell song  
When they put me down below  
They'll sound a fluegelhorn (Lay me low)  
And the sea will rage, and the sky will storm  
All man and beast will mourn  
When I go  
Hats off to the man  
On top of the world  
Come crawl up here, baby  
And we can watch this damn thing turn  
If you wanna be my friend  
And you wanna repent  
And you want it all to end  
And you wanna know when  
Well do it now Do it now  
Take a long last bow  
Take my hand Make a stand  
And blow it all to hell  
Lay me low...  
When I go...
