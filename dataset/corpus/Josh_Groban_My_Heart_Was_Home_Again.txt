So it goes, history shows  
Deserts must expand  
And camels sail like wooden ships  
Like women on the strand  
  
There's sand on Second Avenue  
And the wind blows like a train  
Taxis light up like a string of pearls  
Around the block again  
  
And I remembered everything  
And every windowpane  
Every word came back to me  
The way it used to be  
  
Then I saw your face across the street  
And my heart was home again  
  
There's a bus that leaves at eight fifteen  
And another one at ten  
Should I climb aboard, risk everything  
And ride it to the end  
  
Watch the hills like roller coasters  
Up against the sky  
And wish that you were here by me  
So close that I could die  
  
You said love wrecks everything  
And none of us survive  
So I got over you last night  
And I am still alive  
  
Then I saw your face across the street  
And my heart was home again  
  
And I remembered everything  
And every windowpane  
Every word came back to me  
The way it used to be  
  
Then I saw your face across the street  
And my heart was home again.
