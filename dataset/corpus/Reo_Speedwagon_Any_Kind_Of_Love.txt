Well if you're ever in a tight spot,  
And all the things around you are gettin' hot,  
Come to me and I can cool you off.  
And if you ever get yourself in a jam,  
And if you ever feel you need to find a man  
Call my number and, darling, you found one  
  
But I know now, it can never work out  
The way I really wished that it would.  
But a second-hand love is better than no love at all  
  
And the walls get a little closer,  
And my throat gets a little tighter when  
I say to you that a second-hand love from you is better than no love at all  
Any kind of love from you is better than no love at all  
  
If you got the feeling it ain't right tonight  
And if the fire at home ain't as hot as you like  
I've got a fire that's burning for you.  
And if you ever feel you need to get away  
To get away from the rest of your life,  
I'll come a-runnin' and show you the world.
