I'm ridin' in your car  
Ya turn on the radio  
You're pullin' me close  
I just say no  
I say I don't like it  
Butcha know I'm a liar  
'Cuz when we kiss  
Oooooh  
Fire  
Mmm, fire  
  
Late at night  
Ooooh, you're takin' me home  
You say you wanna stay (I wanna stay)  
I say I wanna be alone  
I say I don't love you  
Butcha know I'm a liar  
'Cuz when we kiss  
Oooooh  
Fire  
Fire  
  
You had a hold on me right from the start  
A grip so tight I couldn't tear it apart  
My nerves all jumpin', actin' like a fool  
Your kisses they burn  
But my heart stays cool  
  
Well, Romeo and Juliet  
Samson and Delilah  
Oh baby you can bet  
A love they couldn't deny  
My words they say split (Yeah)  
But my words they lie (They lie)  
'Cuz when we kiss  
Oooooh  
Fire  
Uh oh, Fire  
  
You had a hold on me right from the start  
A grip so tight I couldn't tear it apart  
My nerves all jumpin', actin' like a fool  
Your kisses they burn  
But my heart stays cool  
Fire  
  
Our kisses like fire  
Woah oh oh, fire  
Love whatcha doin' now  
Fire  
Touchin' me with fire  
Touchin' me, burnin' me  
Take me home  
Fire  
Woah oh oh, fire
