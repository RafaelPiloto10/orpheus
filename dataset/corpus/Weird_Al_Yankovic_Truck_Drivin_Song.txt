I'm drivin' a truck  
Drivin' a big ol' truck  
Pedal to the metal, hope I don't run out of luck  
Rollin' down the highway until the break of dawn  
Drivin' a truck with my high heels on  
  
My diesel rig is northward bound  
It's time to put that hammer down  
Just watchin' as the miles go flyin' by  
I'm ridin' twenty tons of steel  
But it's sure hard to hold the wheel  
While I'm still waiting for my nails to dry  
  
Oh, I always gotta check my lipstick in that rear view mirror  
And my pink angora sweater fits so tight  
I'm jammin' gears and haulin' freight  
Well, I sure hope my seams are straight  
Lord, don't let my mascara run tonight  
  
Because I'm drivin' a truck  
Drivin' a big ol' truck  
Smokey's on my tail and my accelerator's stuck  
Got these eighteen wheels a-rollin until the break of dawn  
Drivin' a truck with my high heels on  
  
Oh, I don't mind when my crotchless panties creep right up on me  
And my nipple rings don't bother me too much  
But when I hit those big speed bumps  
My darling little rhinestone pumps  
Keep slippin' off the mother-lovin' clutch  
  
But still I'm drivin' a truck  
Drivin' a big ol' truck  
Headin' down the interstate, just tryin' to make buck  
Wearin' feather boas with sequins and chiffon  
While I'm drivin' a truck with my high heels on  
  
I'm drivin' a truck  
Drivin' a truck  
Got a load to carry and some eyebrows left to pluck  
And I'm late for my appointment down at the hair salon  
So I'll be drivin' a truck with my high heels on
