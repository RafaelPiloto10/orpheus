In the waking spring,  
Softly you would bring,  
Your eager dreams to my bed,  
All through the joys of summer,  
Love became the harvest,  
We would share...  
  
Beyond tomorrow,  
Like golden sunrise,  
Our love is the dawn of forever...  
  
Beyond tomorrow,  
The gift of lovers,  
Waits bright and free,  
For you and me,  
My love...  
  
When the birds have flown,  
And we stood alone,  
Against the chill of the sky,  
Slowly, the birth of courage,  
Brought us love we knew  
Would never die!
