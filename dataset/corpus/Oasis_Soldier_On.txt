Hold a light,  
Friend of mine,  
Sing a song,  
Soldier on.  
  
Shine a light,  
For me tonight,  
Don't be long,  
Soldier on.  
  
Whose to say,  
That you were right,  
And I was wrong,  
Soldier on.  
  
Come the day,  
Come the night,  
I'll be gone,  
Soldier on.  
  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on  
Soldier on
