Lately I've been winning battles left and right  
But even winners can get wounded in the fight  
People say that I'm amazing  
I'm strong beyond my years  
But they don't see inside of me  
I'm hiding all the tears  
Chorus:  
They don't know that I come running home when I fall down  
They don't know who picks me up when no one is around  
I drop my sword and cry for just a while  
(Look up for His smile)  
'Coz deep inside this armor  
The warrior is a child  
(Aahhh)  
Unafraid because His arrow is the best  
But even soldiers need a quiet place to rest  
People say that I'm amazing  
I never face retreat, oh no  
But they don't see the enemies  
That lay me at His feet  
Chorus:  
They don't know that I come running home when I fall down  
They don't know who picks me up when no one is around  
I drop my sword and cry for just a while  
(Look up for His smile)  
'Coz deep inside this armor  
The warrior is a child  
(Aahhh)  
They don't know that I come running home when I fall down  
They don't know who picks me up when no one is around  
I drop my sword and cry for just a while  
(Look up for His smile)  
'Coz deep inside this armor  
The warrior is a child  
(Aahhh)
