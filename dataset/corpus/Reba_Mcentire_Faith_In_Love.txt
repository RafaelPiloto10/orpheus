We felt this coming on  
We've seen it for a while  
But there are no regrets between us  
We can leave here with a smile  
We have to talk about it  
What we've always known  
The hardest part about today  
Is tonight we'll be alone  
Alone  
  
[Chorus:]  
We were just two hearts  
Bound for different roads  
Oh why they didn't lead us to forever  
We may never know  
Oh I will carry you with me  
I will hold on to our memories  
Don't let the dreams we didn't find  
Make you feel like giving up  
Keep holding on and  
Don't lose your faith in love  
  
Life's gonna move on  
And the pages start to turn  
We'll be stronger people now  
From the lessons that we've learned  
This one's gonna hurt  
It's a little deeper break  
But just know I'm praying for you  
As I watch you walk away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It can hold you, it can save you  
From anything or anyone  
Heaven knows who's waiting for you  
When two hearts come undone  
  
Oh I will carry you with me  
I will hold on to our memories  
Don't let the dreams we didn't find  
Make you feel like giving up  
Keep holding on and  
Don't lose your faith  
Oh never ever lose your faith  
  
In love  
  
Don't ever lose your faith
