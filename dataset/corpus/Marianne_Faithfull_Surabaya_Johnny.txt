I had just turned sixteen that season  
When you came up from Burma to stay.  
And you told me I ought to travel with you,  
You were sure it would be OK.  
When I asked how you earned your living,  
I can still hear what you said to me:  
You had some kind of job on the railway  
And had nothing to do with the sea.  
  
You said a lot, Johnny,  
All one big lie, Johnny.  
You cheated me blind, Johnny,  
From the minute we met.  
I hate you so, Johnny,  
When you stand there grinning, Johnny.  
Take that damn pipe out of your mouth, you rat.  
  
Surabaya Johnny,  
No one's meaner than you.  
Surabaya Johnny,  
My God and I still love you so.  
Surabaya Johnny,  
Why am I feeling so blue ?  
You have no heart, Johnny,  
And I still love you so.  
  
At the start, every day was Sunday,  
Till we went on our way one fine night.  
And before two more weeks were over,  
You thought nothing I did was right.  
So we trekked up and down through the Punjab,  
From the source of the river to the sea.  
When I look at my face in the mirror,  
There's an old woman staring back at me.  
  
You didn't want love, Johnny,  
You wanted cash, Johnny.  
But I sewed your lips, Johnny,  
And that was that.  
You wanted it all, Johnny,  
I gave you more, Johnny.  
Take that damn pipe out of your mouth, you rat.  
  
Surabaya Johnny.  
No one's meaner than you.  
Surabaya Johnny.  
My God and I still love you so.  
Surabaya Johnny,  
Why am I feeling so blue ?  
You have no heart, Johnny.  
And I still love you so.  
  
I would never have thought of asking  
How you'd got that peculiar name,  
But from one end of the coast to the other  
You were known everywhere we came.  
And one day I
