Hey you guys, I just wanted to thank you for listening to the record and I
hope you had as much fun as I did and here's one last little diddy just for
you.  
I used to ride my big wheel, and sell lemonade,  
Eat popcorn with grandpa while we watched the parade  
But now I'm only happy when I'm drinking J.D.  
What the hell happened to me?  
  
I used to have fun throwing snowballs with my best friend Billy  
And Mom would make us cocoa if we got too chilly  
But now I only get excited when I see a girl pee  
What the hell happened to me?  
  
I used to be the nicest kid in the neighborhood  
I only did the things that Momma said I should  
But now I just do whatever I want  
I even whipped it out in a restaurant  
  
I used to help clean the park in the middle of town  
And then played kickball til the sun went down  
But now all I do is get VD,  
What the hell happened to me?  
  
It makes no sense  
I can't believe I ended on me  
I'm out of my gourd  
Won't somebody please, help me?  
  
A do-do-do-do doo a do-do waa do-do-we-oh  
  
I'm kind of a wierdo
