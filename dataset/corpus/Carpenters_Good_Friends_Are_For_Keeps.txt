Hey now don't let your empty room ever get you down  
You can fill the silence with a smile  
And don't let the crowds on the street  
Make you feel like you are just a stranger in town  
If you feel happy,  
Or if you wanna weep,  
Or you wanna warm word before you sleep  
  
Remember,  
Good friends are forever  
Good friends are forever  
Good friends are for keeps  
  
Good friends are forever  
Good friends are forever  
Good friends are for keeps
