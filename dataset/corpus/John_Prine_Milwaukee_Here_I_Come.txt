I'm gonna get on that old turnpike and I'm gonna ride  
I'm gonna leave this town 'til you decide  
Which one you want the most them opry stars or me  
Milwaukee here I come from nashville, tennessee  
  
Milwaukee is where we were before we came here  
Working in a brewery making the finest beer  
You came to me on a payday night said let's go to tennessee  
So we drove to nashville to the grand ole opry  
  
I'm gonna get on that old turpike and I'm gonna ride  
I'm gonna leave this town 'til you decide  
Which one you want the most those opry stars or me  
Milwaukee here I come from nashville, tennessee  
  
We were watching tv ernest tubb was singing loud  
I said that's the man for me I love him, there's no doubt  
I'm leaving you and going now to find out where he's at  
If I can't get him I'll settle for that bluegrass lester flatt.  
  
I'm gonna get on that old turnpike and I'm gonna ride  
I'm gonna leave this town 'til you decide  
Which one you want the most  
Me or jerry lee  
Milwaukee here I come from nashville, tennessee  
Milwaukee here I come from nashville, tennessee
