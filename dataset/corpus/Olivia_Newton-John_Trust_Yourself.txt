(Olivia Newton-John)  
I need to tell the truth  
I can't lie anymore  
I need to do what's right  
I know that's what my life is for  
I can't be quiet anymore  
About what I'm suppose to do  
I need to tell the truth  
And do what's right by you  
I need to speak my mind  
And let my heart run free  
Your pain will heal with time  
And one day you'll thank me  
And as I follow my dream  
And there is no room for you  
Just know there was no scheme  
It's just what I had to do  
Trust yourself--you know all the answers  
Trust yourself--you know what is right  
Trust yourself--they're all there inside you  
They've been there forever--just show them some light  
Sometimes the truth brings pain  
But broken dreams regrow  
Not in the same old way  
But change is life you know  
And as I move on  
To start my song anew  
Please understand my need  
To do what I have to do  
Trust yourself--you know all the answers  
Trust yourself--you know what is right  
Trust yourself--they're all there inside you  
They've been there forever--just show them some light  
And as life goes on  
Can we still be friends?  
Don't let this circumstance  
Cause our friendship to end  
Trust yourself--you know all the answers  
Trust yourself--you know what is right  
Trust yourself--they're all there inside you  
They've been there forever--just show them some light  
I need to tell you the truth  
I need to speak my mind  
Sometimes the truth brings pain  
Your pain will heal in time
