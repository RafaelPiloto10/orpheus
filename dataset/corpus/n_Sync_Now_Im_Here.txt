Now we're here  
J-you-S-T-I-N(what what)  
We are here for you  
What's that you say  
Baby its okay  
Cuz you know we're ugly  
  
Chorus  
Bsb kicks our ass  
Because they always do  
Baby I know we're lucky  
But look on the bright side  
We are loaded  
And can buy you things  
  
So ignore our strange looks  
And when you kiss us  
You can picture B-rok if you want  
But please baby  
Hold my hand  
Cuz britney wont touch me
