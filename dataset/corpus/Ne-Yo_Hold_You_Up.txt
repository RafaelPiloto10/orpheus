Ne-Yo: Ne-Yo, Six John, for the mix tape  
Ne-Yo: Yo six  
Six: Wassup  
Ne-Yo: Look at these niggas  
Six: I know, wait, do you see his watch nigga?  
Ne-Yo: What... What's that, a Rolex?  
Six: That's a Breitling or a Jacob or...  
Ne-Yo: shit it don't matter  
Six: Yeah it don't matter  
Ne-Yo: whatever it is, it's ours now  
  
[6 John]  
  
Scoping your watch for a while,  
The bezel, the face, the crown  
Don't matter the place, I'm down  
The magnum will chase em down  
You better not make a sound  
Or I'll make this fire crack  
Crick clack, get back nigga  
  
(Let me hold you Up)  
  
[Ne-Yo]  
  
Watching you playa I see ya high side  
Boss up to chickens two miles an hour in your ride  
Walking around reckless with your nice necklace  
Told my nigga six like yo we gotta get this nigga  
  
[6 John]  
  
Yes I agree homie  
Only these deep streets know me  
When cronie see that cromie at his domie  
He won't be lonely  
He just gon be wanting for me and Ne-Yo to lax  
Put your items in this bag and just  
  
(Let me hold hold you up)  
  
[Ne-Yo]  
  
Cuz you know in the plan in the focus  
Get this silly nigga for everything he holding  
Rock his jewels like they're mine, don't care if they're stolen  
Crept up real close and this is what I told him  
  
[Chorus: Ne-Yo]  
  
On your arm on your neck on your wrist I want it  
Yeah that's right, all your ice and your cash, I want it  
Hold you up and nigga I ain't trynna front with you  
Please don't make me kill ya  
Just let me hold you up  
And that nigga you close to  
I'm jacking both you  
The nine that I'm holdin will stop you from livin  
Don't try to play me, just give me it all and let me hold you up  
  
[Ne-Yo]  
  
Gimmie this, gimmie that too  
The other nigga, don't make me smack you  
Better yet, pull out that smack  
Please don't let the gat sneeze at you  
Get a, atchoo, sneeze  
Whatever get on your knees  
On the ground and come out them shoes  
(Let me hold you up)  
Now that we've got your pockets like rabbit ears  
Get up with what little you've got and get out of here  
Before you gone flip, the keys to the whip  
What you thought I'd let that slip  
Shit  
  
(Let me hold you up)  
  
[6 John]  
  
Cuz I don't give a damn nigga damn you  
I don't care about the sentimental value  
Passed on generation to generation  
Grandma's old box of wild jewels  
I got a grandma too  
Her diamonds blue  
But yours is so blue  
Here lets make yours hers and  
(Let me hold you up)  
Like you at attention  
And give me gat attention  
And if there's anything you failed to mention I've got bad intentions  
You don't want to end up missing with a stint  
You'd rather hand your riches  
That's the smart thing to do  
  
(Let me hold you up)  
  
[Chorus: Ne-Yo]  
  
On your arm on your neck on your wrist I want it  
Yeah that's right, all your ice and your cash, I want it  
Hold you up and nigga I ain't trynna front with you  
Please don't make me kill ya  
Just let me hold you up  
And that nigga you close to  
I'm jacking both you  
The nine that I'm holdin will stop you from livin  
Don't try to play me, just give me it all and let me hold you up  
  
[6 John]  
  
Down, down, lay down  
Before I pull that four pound  
Nigga you should know  
What I'm trynna do  
Down, down, lay down  
Before I pull that four pound  
Nigga you should know  
Just let me hold you  
Down, down, lay down  
Before I pull that four pound  
Nigga you should know  
What I'm trynna do  
Down, down, lay down  
Before I pull that four pound  
Nigga you should know!  
Let me hold you up
