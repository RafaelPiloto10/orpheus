Through the burning sun  
And the driving rain  
Over the sea  
Across the plain  
I'll ask you once  
I'll ask you again  
Won't you be my love  
Won't you be my friend  
  
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
The lights are low  
The hour is late  
Don't you want me baby  
Through your garden gate  
Don't you feel it coming  
And it feels so strong  
I will never ever  
Ever do you wrong  
  
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Now the mountain is high  
The river is deep  
We always knew  
We hold the key  
Roses red  
Violets blue  
Love you baby  
Till I'm dead  
  
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
