Lazybones, sleepin' in the sun....how you spect to get your day's work done?  
You can't get your day's work done......sleepin' in the noon day sun  
Lazybones, layin' in the shade....how you gonna get your cornmeal made?  
  
You can't get no cornmeal made....sleepin' in that evening shade  
When taters need sprayin', I bet you keep prayin'  
The bugs'll fall off of the vine  
  
And when you go fishin' I bet you keep wishin'  
Them fish don't grab your line  
Lazybones, loafin' all the day.....how you spect to make a dime that way?  
You won't make no dime that way.....loafin' in the shade all day
