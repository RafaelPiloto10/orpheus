So you want me to take it off  
Just to see what's  
Underneath my cloth  
I'll show you I'm every  
Inch a man  
Measure all that you  
Think you can  
  
I'm more than what  
Meets the eye  
Flesh 'n' blood is  
Often a white lie  
By the cover you misjudge  
The book  
Open your mind and take  
Another look  
  
[Chorus]  
Naked, and I'm unashamed  
Naked, with no one to blame  
Naked, ya you want the truth  
Naked, here's my birthday suit  
Naked, naked, naked, naked  
  
I pretend to be not anyone  
Except me and my imperfections  
There is nothing I  
Expect of you  
That you wouldn't  
Expect of me, too  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Will you excuse me for my ignorance  
'Cause I can see only one  
Difference  
Those of you who seek to find  
While all the others choose  
To walk 'n' talk blind
