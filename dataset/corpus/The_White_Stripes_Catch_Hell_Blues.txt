(If you go looking for hot water, don't act shocked when you get burned a
little bit.)  
  
If you really want some hot water, I can help you find it.  
  
Oh  
Oh  
Ah yeah  
  
Well, if they catch me around, you're playing rock the boat  
I'm gonna catch Hell  
And if you're throwing your voice in bed singing a note  
I'm gonna catch Hell  
I know it  
  
That's right  
Try and catch me  
  
Oh yeah  
  
Tricky, tricky  
Yeah  
  
Oh  
Oh  
  
If you're getting tricky, lying to yourself  
You're gonna catch Hell  
And if you're testing God, lying to his face  
You're gonna catch Hell  
C'mon  
  
Hey  
That's it  
They're gonna catch you  
They're gonna catch you
