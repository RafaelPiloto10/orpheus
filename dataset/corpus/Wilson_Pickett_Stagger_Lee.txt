The night was clear and the moon was yellow  
And the leaves came tumbling down  
  
I was standing on the corner when I heard my bulldog bark  
He was barkin' at the two men who were gamblin' in the dark  
It was Stagger Lee and Billy, two men who gambled late  
Stagger Lee threw seven, Billy swore that he threw eight  
  
Stagger Lee told Billy, "I can't let you go with that"  
"You have won all my money and my brand new stetson hat"  
Stagger Lee started off goin' down that railroad track  
He said "I can't get you Billy but don't be here when I come back"  
  
Stagger Lee went home and he got his forty-four  
Said "I'm goin' to the barroom just to pay that debt I owe"  
Stagger Lee went to the barroom and he stood across the barroom door  
He said "Nobody move" and he pulled his forty-four  
  
Stagger Lee shot Billy, oh he shot that poor boy so bad  
Till the bullet came through Billy and it broke the bartender's glass
