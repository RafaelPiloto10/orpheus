In the night I will be waitin'  
Ready to go, soon as the daylight is fadin'  
In the night my heart is beating  
Out of control, can't stop the way that I'm feeling  
I want to know how far to go, takin' my life in my hands  
Out on my own, fighting alone, call me the desperate man  
  
Danger, danger, give me danger, danger  
Give me measures of pleasure and pain, boiling the blood in my veins  
Danger, danger, give me danger, danger  
Give me nothing to stand in my way, I'll make the best of my days  
  
In the night, oh, I can feel it  
Time slips away, if I can't pay I will steal it  
In the night I will be screamin'  
Hour by hour livin' the life that I'm dreamin'  
Under the gun, I'll be the one, walking the edge of the knife  
Taking the best, leaving the rest, I'm gonna run for my life  
  
Danger, danger, give me danger, danger  
Give me measures of pleasure and pain, boiling the blood in my veins  
Danger, danger, give me danger, danger  
Give me nothing to stand in my way, I'll make the best of my days  
I want to know how far to go, takin' my life in my hands  
Out on my own, fighting alone, call me the desperate man  
  
Danger, danger, give me danger, danger  
Give me fires that endlessly burn, I've passed the point of return  
Danger, danger, danger, danger, danger, danger
