Don't want to fall in love  
Don't want to fall in love again  
And you don't know where I've been  
Don't want to fall in love again  
  
I will not fall,  
Is it a matter of love, or a matter of pride?  
Can't stop a broken heart from bleeding  
Don't make it harder than it has to be  
Nothing worth love is ever easy  
Love is never easy  
  
So if you want my love tell me now  
And if you need my love I'll show you how  
Just open up your heart and let me love you  
Learn to love again, learn to love again  
  
Better to love and lose than never ever love at all?  
So tell me something new, tell me why do fools fall?  
Tell me why, yeah why do they fall?  
Ain't a matter of love, it's a matter of pride  
  
Can't stop a broken heart from bleeding  
Don't make it harder than it has to be  
Nothing worth love is ever easy  
Love is never easy  
  
So if you want my love tell me now  
And if you need my love I'll show you how  
Just open up your heart and let me love you  
Learn to love again, learn to love again  
  
I should have known it all along  
I should have know that I...  
  
Can't stop a broken heart from bleeding  
Don't make it harder than it has to be  
Nothing worth love is ever easy  
Love is never easy  
  
So if you want my love tell me now  
And if you need my love I'll show you how  
Just open up your heart and let me love you  
Learn to love again, learn to love again  
  
So if you want my love no need to ask  
And if you need my love forget the past  
Just open up your heart and let me love you  
Learn to love again, learn how to love again
