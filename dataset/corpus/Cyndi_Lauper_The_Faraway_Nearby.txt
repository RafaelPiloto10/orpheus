Out in the faraway nearby  
Can your hear my call  
Out in the faraway nearby  
I'm breaking down the walls  
Till you're here to stay  
Out from the faraway  
  
Hot looks, cold words,  
Don't know what it is you heard  
But I didn't mean it,  
If I said something wrong  
Short nights, long dreams  
Something happens in between  
Then a weird feeling,  
Like you're here but still you're gone  
...Oo, heart beats  
Like a knock on the door  
But it sounds so faraway  
  
In the faraway nearby  
Can your hear me call  
Out in the faraway nearby  
I'm breaking down the walls  
Till you're here to stay  
Out from the faraway  
  
Big whisper, small scream  
But it's not like what it seems  
Locked up in the open  
Don't know which way to go  
Deserts, oceans  
Leaving footprints in the sand  
Hoping that you'll see them  
And wishing you'd follow  
...And walk with me hand in hand, ya-ha  
And talk with me you got a plan, ah-ha  
And hold me, and hold me  
Don't stop...in the faraway nearby  
Can you here me call
