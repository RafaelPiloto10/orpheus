When you spend your whole life  
Building stone castles  
When the walls start to crumble  
Exposed to the world  
When the wind burns my face  
And the smoke burns my eyes  
I can't ever cry  
I can't ever cry  
CHORUS  
You gotta help . . .  
To make me somebody  
You gotta help . . .  
To open my eyes  
The temperature's rising  
How a cool drink would help  
I've been thirsty for years  
I've been thirsty for years  
I'm hungry for something . . .  
Just the touch of your flesh  
To sooth and refresh . . .  
To sooth and refresh.  
CHORUS
