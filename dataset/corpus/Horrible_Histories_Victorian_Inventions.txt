[Intro]  
Twas the age of queen Victoria  
A period notorious  
So many brand new goods we did create.  
  
[Verse 1]  
Our list is long and glorious,  
Though I don't intend to borious  
Was a time of great invention  
  
Was it really? What did we invent then?  
  
[Verse 2]  
Well I'm just about to mention,  
Drum roll please lets raise the tension  
We invented this. Music hall.  
  
Is that all?  
  
[Verse 3]  
Well...  
A chap called Henry Bessemer invented molten steel  
Which led to other chaps creating the automobile  
Which let to petrol, tires and bikes so all that was required  
Was roads so concrete came and tarmac thought up to  
  
[Verse 4]  
Your hired!  
  
[Chorus]  
Ooooh. Concrete, tarmac, steel.  
The automobile  
Seal of rubber wheel  
Such inventive zeal  
Still there's plenty to reveal.  
  
[Verse 5]  
Victorian brains worked over time to come up with ideas.  
We invented lights bulbs.  
Nice one!  
Cheers!  
  
[Verse 6]  
Type writers and radios, now news was fast conveyed. Hello?  
A telephone was no good till a second phone was made. Hello!  
  
[Verse 7]  
Our inventors did not snooze,  
Always had another rouse.  
The latest flushing loo  
Films that did amuse.  
Flashbulb cameras to use.  
  
[Hook]  
What a picture! What a picture!  
  
[Chorus]  
Vacuum cleaners, toilet paper, postboxes and stamps  
Toilets, aspirin, anesthetics, locks, electric lamps.  
Sewing machines, X-rays, comics, ice cream in a pot.  
Easter eggs and rockets, we invented the whole lot.  
  
Ooo... !  
  
Hang on there's more  
  
[Chorus]  
Trains and lines and bridges and the underground as well.  
Paddle steamers prams and disinfectant for their smell  
Sterile doctors instruments, one last unmentioned brand.  
Victorians invented the worlds first conveyor band.  
  
[Bridge]  
Cuddly toy?  
Invented 1902. The year after Victoria died.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oooohhh, barometers were new  
Iron ships a coo  
What genius!  
Thank you.  
Seems we're almost through  
  
[Outro]  
Just one little oversight...  
[Boom]  
We... Invented... Dynamite.
