Every second counts  
That's what he says  
Every second counts  
Every single day  
All through the night time  
All through the day time  
Can't let your world pass through and into my way  
  
Every second counts  
He can't slow down  
Every second counts  
See him spin around  
He's chasing his shadow  
He's racing the wind  
He tells us to follow  
Where the ice is so thin  
  
I hope you're holding on  
I hope you're holding on  
'cause every second counts
