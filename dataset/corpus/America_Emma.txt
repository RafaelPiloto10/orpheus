I was falling for some time  
Passing others, as they'd climb  
In a moment very clear  
You seemed to beckon, come here dear  
  
Emma, sure as the sun's shining on you  
I can tell I'm in your spell  
Emma you're the one, oh  
  
If they ever change your mind  
Try to leave it all behind  
If there ever comes a time  
You go your way, and I'll go mine  
  
Emma, sure as the moon circles over  
Heaven knows, that's how it goes  
Emma you're the one, oh  
  
I can tell I'm in your spell  
Emma, you're the one, oh  
Emma, Emma, Emma...
