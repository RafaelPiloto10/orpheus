An easy operator on the side of the road  
A million dollar man in a lower-class home  
Chopping trees for needs of a spiritual kind  
Forever getting low while he tried to be high  
He was an early morning eagle flying through from the fire  
Barely getting over forget getting by  
But it's all the same to Billy Kincade  
If he had to do it over he would do it the same  
  
He was living in the end  
He was living in the end  
  
Polly and her pity wasn't pretty at all  
She concentrated fully on the shine of the star  
But your pennies, just a pension  
She never let go  
They always dominated everything that she owned  
She couldn't stop to see, she didn't have the time  
How could she afford to pay attention to life?  
Oh it's all the same for Polly the Vain  
If she had to do it over she would do it the same  
  
She was living in the end  
She was living in the end  
  
Are you all right darling, all right now?  
You'll never be, never be the same.  
Are you all right darling, all right now?  
Don't you ever wanna, ever wanna see some change?  
  
You didn't see it coming  
That's the tale of his life  
Easy operator laid to rest in the night  
He had to take the hit it's always the same  
That's the waste you see in killing Billy Kincade  
That's the waste you see in killing Billy Kincade  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
Are you all right darling, all right now?  
Don't you ever wanna, ever wanna see some change?  
  
They was living in the end  
Thats just living in the end
