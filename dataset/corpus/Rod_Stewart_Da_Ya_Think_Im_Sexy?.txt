Sugar, sugar  
  
She sits alone waiting for suggestions  
Hes so nervous avoiding all the questions  
His lips are dry, her heart is gently pounding  
Don't you just know exactly what they're thinking  
  
If you want my body and you think Im sexy  
Come on sugar let me know.  
If you really need me just reach out and touch me  
Come on honey tell me so  
Tell me so baby  
  
Hes acting shy looking for an answer  
Come on honey lets spend the night together  
Now hold on a minute before we go much further  
Give me a dime so I can phone my mother  
They catch a cab to his high rise apartment  
At last he can tell her exactly what his heart meant  
  
If you want my body and you think Im sexy  
Come on honey tell me so  
If you really need me just reach out and touch me  
Come on sugar let me know  
  
His hearts beating like a drum  
Cos at last he's got this girl home  
Relax baby now we are alone  
  
They wake at dawn cos all the birds are singing  
Two total strangers but that aint what they're thinking  
Outside it's cold, misty and it's raining  
They got each other neither ones complaining  
He says I sorry but Im out of milk and coffee  
Never mind sugar we can watch the early movie  
  
If you want my body and you think Im sexy  
Come on sugar let me know  
If you really need me just reach out and touch me  
Come on honey tell me so  
  
If you really need me just reach out and touch me  
Come on sugar let me know  
If you really, really, really, really need me  
Just let me know  
Just reach out and touch me  
If you really want me  
Just reach out and touch me  
Come on sugar let me know  
If you really need me just reach out and touch me  
Come on sugar let me know  
If you, if you, if you really need me  
Just come on and tell me so
