A woman came and said to me  
She'd seen a lady sell her baby  
For ten or twenty dollars maybe  
And everybody thinks she's crazy  
They're too blind to see  
She never failed to call attention  
To the things we never ment  
Real horror, daily, courtesy of your T-V  
C'est La Vie  
  
A woman came and said to me  
Now listen very carefully  
There's brother killing brother  
People living on their knees  
Biting sugar coated bullets  
For the pain of this disease  
C'est La Vie  
  
A woman came and said to me  
She had a husband on an island  
Found his body on a wasteland  
Soldiers came and took him  
Just to torture her you see  
C'est la vie  
All alone she mourned her lover  
Crossed the sea to find a brother  
Maybe he could help her get her baby back for free  
More stuff
