You're far away from me  
And we don't talk enough  
Here at home everything's the same  
Just empty, and its tough  
  
You're far away from me  
And missing in our room  
Here at home time stands in his corner  
Silent as a tomb  
  
The world's an open window  
The wold is big and you're so small  
What awaits you, what do you see  
When you're far away from me?  
  
You don't stop for a minute  
You're always running fast  
No time to talk to me right now,  
'cause its a quarter past!  
  
You're far away from me  
Our room is not the same  
By chance I heard the radio today  
Mention your name  
  
The world's an open window  
The wold is big and you're so small  
What awaits you, what do you see  
When you're far away from me?  
  
You never calm down,  
Can the horizon promise you be free?  
What awaits you when you're far away from me?
