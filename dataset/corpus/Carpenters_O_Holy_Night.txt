O holy night! The stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of the dear Saviors birth  
  
Long lay the world in sin and error pining  
Till He appeared and the soul felt it's worth  
  
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn  
  
Fall on your knees! Oh hear the angel voices  
O night divine, O night, when Christ was born  
O night divine, O night, when Christ was born  
  
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming  
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand  
  
So, led by light of a star sweetly gleaming  
Here came the wise men from the Orient land  
  
The King of Kings lay thus in lowly manger  
In all our trials born to be our friend  
  
He knows our need, to our weakness no stranger  
Behold your King, before Him lowly bend  
Behold your King, your King, before Him lowly bend  
  
Truly He taught us to love one another  
His law is love and His Gospel is Peace  
  
Chains shall He break for the slave Is our brother  
And in his name all oppression shall cease  
  
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we.  
Let all within us praise His holy Name  
  
Christ is the Lord, then ever, ever praise we  
His power and glory evermore proclaim  
His power and glory evermore proclaim
