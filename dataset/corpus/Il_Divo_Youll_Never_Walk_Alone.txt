When you walk through a storm, hold your head up high and don't be afraid of
the dark.  
  
At the end of the storm, there's a golden sky, and the sweet silver song of
the lark.  
  
Walk on through the wind, Walk on through the rain.  
Though your dreams be tossed and blown.  
  
Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart, and you'll never walk, you'll never
walk, you'll never walk alone.  
  
Walk on through the wind, Walk on through the rain.  
Though your dreams be tossed and blown.  
  
Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart, and you'll never walk, you'll never  
You'll never walk alone, you'll never, you'll never walk alone.
