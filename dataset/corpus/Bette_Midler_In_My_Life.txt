There are places I remember  
All my life, though some have changed.  
Some forever, not for better.  
And some have gone, and some remain.  
  
All these places have their moments  
With lovers and friends I still can't recall.  
Some are dead and some are living.  
In my life I love them all.  
  
But of all these friends and lovers,  
There is no one compares with you.  
And these memories lose their meaning  
When I think of love as something new.  
  
Though I know I'll never ever lose affection  
For people and things that went before,  
I know I'll often stop and think about them.  
In my life I love you more.  
  
Though I know I'll never ever lose affection  
For people and things that went before,  
I know I'll often stop and think of them.  
But in my life I loved you more.  
I love you more.  
I love you more.
