I'll steal your life and cut, out your heart.  
Rip the core of your, world apart.  
Then I'll, take your sight.  
Leave ya blind.  
Laughing hard as you, loose your mind.  
Smash in your skull!!!  
Kick out your brains!!!  
Dance all over!  
What remains!!!  
  
Life! The living danger,  
Death! The welcome stranger,  
In sin! You deny the cross.  
  
Deny the cross!  
  
I'm an angel I'm, virgin white.  
This only happens, every night.  
Restitution, for my sin,  
Imprisoned virtue, time begins.  
Killer instincts!!!  
Escape my find!  
Path of destruction!  
Left behind.  
  
Life, it walks away  
It walks today  
It fades away  
Death, is here to stay  
Is here today  
To deny the cross!  
  
Draw and quarter, slice the meat.  
Now there's something, more to eat.  
Nothing left there is, just a frame.  
This poor soul, has no name.  
Back to dirt!  
Six feet deep!  
I take a breath!  
Long and deep!!!  
  
Deny the cross!!!
