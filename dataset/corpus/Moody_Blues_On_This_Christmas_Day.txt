I saw your picture in the paper  
I didn't know your name  
But the pain was there for all to see  
As the snow turned to rain  
I saw your picture didn't know what to do  
A lonely face in the crowd  
In that moment when the world stood still  
And tears lay on the ground  
Wherever I go, I will think of you  
Whatever I do, whatever I say on this Christmas Day  
A silent a prayer on the street  
Is it Heaven that has the final word?  
With the world at your feet  
Wherever I go, I will think of you  
Whatever I do, whatever I say on this Christmas Day  
On this Christmas day  
Wherever I go, I will think of you  
Whatever I do, whatever I say on this Christmas Day  
Wherever I go, I will think of you, I will be with you  
On this Christmas Day  
On this Christmas Day
