When I ask those questions, baby  
It's just to get them out of my head  
Cause they turn around inside it  
Then they spill off to our bed  
Do I really want to know?  
Do I really want to know your life?  
Would I have to let you go?  
Could I listen to my heart if my head stops to think twice?  
  
When I've been a good boy  
When I've been a bad boy  
I have too much fun  
But baby so did everyone  
I've never been an angel  
But things are gonna change, change, change  
So do you really want to know?  
Do you really want to know my life?  
Would you have to let me go?  
Could you listen to your heart if your head stopped to think twice?  
  
If you knew every woman  
And I knew every man  
We never would have made it past holding hands  
I guess the saying is no longer true  
That what you don't know can hurt you  
I guess there is just no question, baby  
You know what you're doing in bed  
If I want your touch  
Should I know too much  
Some things are better left unsaid  
So do I really want to know?  
Do I really want to know your life?  
Would I have to let you go?  
Could I listen to my heart if my head starts to think twice?  
  
(Tell me baby, Cause one thing to guess is one thing to know,  
And don't you think that maybe baby I've got secrets of my own?)  
  
If I knew every woman  
And you knew every man  
We never would have made it past holding hands  
I used to say it but it's no longer true  
Cause what you don't know can really hurt you (Can kill you baby)  
  
And even as we speak  
The world is full of lovers  
Night after night, week after week  
Trusting to luck and a pocket full of rubbers
