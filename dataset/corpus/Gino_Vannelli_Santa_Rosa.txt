Hack jaws and hellions don't you step on my z's  
I'm gettin' rather ornery 'bout my natural means  
I'll I want is a small piece of the pie  
A place in the sun to comfort my eyes  
North of l.a. just south of monterey  
To santa rosa  
I'm gonna break away  
Blue grass and the sycamores and the sweet eucalyptas in the air  
Mad dogs and wolf hounds running everywhere  
You can go with the flow you can bend in the breeze  
Just step to one side and then play the black keys  
North of l.a. just south of santa jose  
To santa rosa  
I'm gonna do what is right to make a better life  
Before it's over  
I'm gonna break away  
Angels and lucifer don't you step on my ground  
I've got a good god-fearing woman who might just shoot you down  
I love her and she loves me  
Together we'll raise such a sweet family  
North of l.a. just south of monterey  
To santa rosa  
I'm gonna do what I can to get the sea and sand  
Back on my shoulder  
I'm gonna sail away
