Come inside my walls of  
Ecstasy, with me  
Close the door and throw away  
The key  
That's the way you can start by  
Moving in nice and slow  
Taking your time to move  
Down low  
'cause everything you do is  
Everything I need  
Lights are low, so here we go,  
Let's get busy  
  
[Chorus]  
Hands on the clock  
Time to make my body rock  
Move with me, you get me  
So hot that I can't stop  
Tic Toc  
You got the spot  
Here I come ready or not  
So hot that I can't stop  
Tic Toc, Tic Toc baby  
Tic Toc, Tic Toc baby  
  
You opened up my world to  
Paradise, so nice  
Feels so good my body  
Liquefies  
When you touch me I lose  
Control and start to shake  
Your love is so good I ain't  
Gotta fake  
'cause everything you do is  
Everything I like  
The plot thickens, time's tick'n,  
You're my toy tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tic Toc the clock keeps  
On tick'n  
Hurry up before it gets too late  
Tic Toc the clock keeps on  
Tick'n  
Hurry up before it gets too late  
  
A little to the left  
A little to the right  
A little bit longer  
All the way tonight  
I close my eyes, my body  
Tenes  
Boy your touch hits all my  
Senses  
Don't stop  
Come on  
I'm almost there  
In the middle of the night  
Reality stops  
And I'm suspended  
In your arms  
As I melt from your touch  
  
[Chorus: x2]
