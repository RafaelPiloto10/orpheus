[Verse]  
This whiskey got me feelin' pretty  
So pardon if I'm impolite  
I just really need your ass with me  
I'm sorry 'bout the other night  
And I know I could be more creative  
And come up with poetic lines  
But I'm turnt up off sizz' and "I love you"  
Is the only thing that's in my mind  
  
[Chorus]  
You take me higher, higher than I've ever been, babe  
Just come over, let's pour a drink, babe  
I hope I ain't calling you too late, too late  
You light my fire  
Let's stay up late and smoke a J  
I wanna go back to the old ways  
But I'm drunk and still with a full ash tray  
With a little bit too much to say
