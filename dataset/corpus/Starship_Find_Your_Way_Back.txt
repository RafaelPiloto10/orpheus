You know it's been a long long road  
Since I packed up and left on my own  
And I can carry a heavy load  
Just try 'n' get back to her heart  
  
I sure ain't got no home  
I seem to find love where I ramble  
And when it's time to go  
I hear that voice again, say 'n'  
  
[Chorus]  
Find your way back  
Find your way back to her heart  
Find your way back  
Find your way back to her heart  
  
Leave a message with the rain  
You can find me where the wind blows  
The snow across the pain  
And the frost upon the heart  
  
You got no place to be  
Still you wonder where you're goin'  
And why I had to leave  
I hear a voice and it says to me  
  
Find your way back  
Find your way back to her heart  
Find your way back  
Find your way back to her heart  
To her heart, c'mon  
  
I know it's too late now  
But I wish I could go back in time  
And start all over somehow  
And get it right from the start  
  
Find your way back  
Find your way back to her heart  
Find your way back  
Find your way back to her heart  
  
Find your way back (Find your way back) Find your way back  
Find your way back (Find your way back) Find your way back  
Find your way back (Find your way back) Find your way back  
Find your way back (Find your way back) Find your way back
