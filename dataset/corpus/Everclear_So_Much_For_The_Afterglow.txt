This is a song about Susan  
This is a song about the girl next door  
This is a song about the everyday occurrences that make you feel like letting
go  
Yes I think we've got a problem  
  
So much for the afterglow  
This is a song about Susan  
This is a song about the way things are  
This is a song about the scary things you see from the corner of your eyes  
Don't you wonder why?  
  
We never talk about the future  
We never talk about the past anymore  
We never ask ourselves the questions to the answers that nobody even wants to
know  
I guess the honeymoon is over  
  
So much for the afterglow  
I remember we could talk about anything  
I remember when we used to want to hang out  
We never talk about the future  
We never talk about the past anymore  
We never ask ourselves the questions to the answers that nobody even wants to
know  
  
Oh well oh well oh well  
So much for the afterglow  
Oh well oh well oh well  
Yes I guess we need the drama  
So much for the afterglow
