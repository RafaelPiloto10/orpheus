Alright  
  
She's got hurricane eyes  
And know what she sees  
She's got lovin' thighs  
And she gets it for free  
  
She makes a cigarette shake  
And don't need no advice  
She won't put on the breaks  
And you feed her device, yeah  
  
She's gonna tease you up and down now  
Gonna play for keeps  
  
I said  
  
Put up  
Or shut it up now  
Put up  
Or shut it up  
  
Yeah  
Ha!  
  
She's got hounds on her trail  
And they follow her scent  
She's the kind of female  
That don't need no good sense  
(She's wild)  
  
She's got a license to thrill  
And she shoots from the hip  
Takes her power up well  
And your passion is sure to drip  
  
And all so packaged move for speed now  
When the feeling climbs  
  
I said  
  
Put up  
Or shut it up now  
(You gotta, gotta)  
Put up  
Or shut it up  
  
Yeah  
  
Listen  
  
You want a piece of the action  
And I don't want to be cheated, no  
Gotta feel the connection  
She's turning on her feet, yeah!  
  
Oh, here we go  
Comin' to getcha babe  
Oh yeah  
  
She's got hurricane eyes  
And you know what she sees  
She's got love in her thighs  
And she gives it away for free  
  
She's gonna tease you up and down now  
Gonna play for keeps  
  
You gotta  
  
Put up  
Or shut it up now  
I said
