I remember when my teacher said,  
"How you want to make your life?"  
I said, "I can play guitar  
And it will be alright listen!"  
  
When I came out of school  
They said, "Which way you want to go?"  
But there was no way strong enough  
Compared with rock 'n roll  
To get the same thrill  
  
Anyhow I've found a job  
They tried to break me with their rules  
But they had no chance at all  
'Cause I knew what to do  
To get the same thrill like rock 'n roll  
  
I had a feeling they couldn't buy  
Still got that feeling they still can't buy,  
They still can't buy,  
They still can't buy  
  
Tell me the alternative  
To what I'm doing, but I guess  
There's no other way of life  
Which is strong like this  
To get the same thrill like rock 'n roll
