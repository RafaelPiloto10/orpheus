(Elo)  
  
Sailin' away on the crest of a wave  
It's like magic  
Rollin' and ridin' and slippin' and slidin'  
It's magic  
  
Chorus  
And you, and your sweet desire,  
You took me, ooh, woah, higher and higher, baby  
It's a livin' thing,  
It's a terrible thing to lose,  
It's a given thing  
What a terrible thing to lose  
  
Making believe this is what you conceived  
From your worst day, (I'm thinking of dying)  
Moving in line then you look back in time  
To the first day (I'm thinking, I'm thinking)  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Takin' a dive cause you can't halt the slide  
Floating downstream, (I'm thinking of dying)  
So let her go don't start spoiling the show  
It's a bad dream (I'm thinking, I'm thinking)  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
It's a livin' thing,  
It's a terrible thing to lose,  
It's a terrible thing to lose  
What a terrible thing to lose
