What the fuck am I doing  
Wake up in the morning who the fuck am I screwing  
My partner on brown and you know I'm on white  
You know its going down, I can do this all night  
Gotta get to the paper one time for the haters  
Money over bitches two times for the fakers  
'Cause even in the dark, baby I'mma shine bright  
I'm way too gone, the best night of my life  
  
Look, yeah, I said g-g-go DJ  
See you got the Jizzle on replay  
Just keep that Jizzle on repeat  
It's about the time everybody screams "Free Meech!"  
Let's take your bitch ass back to o five,  
Close your eyes, take a rough nigga look, Atlanta lights  
Club vision, PJ in my hand, I'm on the couch  
Man this nigga Meech just blew a quarter mil, he bought a house  
Man you niggas gonna lace up your sneaks? It's time to ball  
Presidential at the Swiss Hotel, makin' come alls  
Posted up, all black in the back, a hundred deep  
A hundred coupes posted up in the front, two-hundred seats  
Man somebody call the IRS, too many lambos  
I'm talking bottles and blunts, all you can handle  
Them other niggas fakin and flaugin'  
Man them real niggas do real things, let's drink to that!  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm way too gone, what the fuck am I doing  
Wake up in the morning, who the fuck am I screwing  
My partner on brown and you know I'm on white  
You know its going down, I can do this all night  
Gotta get to the paper one time for the haters  
Money over bitches two times for the fakers  
'Cause even in the dark, baby I'mma shine bright  
I'm way too gone, the best night of my life  
  
I said I'm gone! I'm going going gone!  
Way this night going, man I won't make it home  
I'mma wake up in the room, wake up with a hangover  
What I spent last night I could've bought a Range Rover  
Got my Ray-bans on, yeah I see you haters  
Keep doing what you doing, cause I need you haters  
Say whats up to long stick, you can call it strong  
If I had to name my money baby, I would call it long  
Said I'm way too gone, I don't see nobody  
I ain't even on the bill, I'm acting like it's my party  
Smell like I'm on fire, oh I'm just that hot  
If I smoke another blunt, yeah I swear I'm gonna die  
You can call the weed man, tell him bring another six  
Yeah I know he just left, he gotta make another trip  
So hot in here, feel like I'm gon' faint  
Even though I'm past my limit, still think I'm gonna drink  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I woke up early this morning  
With three white girls wanna keep bonin'  
I'm blowing money fast, so caught up in the moment  
One time for the marks, two times for my homies  
I'm a rock star every night, I'm a astronaut outta sight  
Put Codeine in my Sprite, my wrist is full of ice  
Don't even know her name, just so caught in the hype  
It's OK baby, 'cause I'm a millionaire for life  
I got bitches on my payroll, they come like Vanna White  
On my Ethopia, we in Vegas so icy  
Got a girl at home, I know I'm wrong it feels so right  
On the first road, young i hope I roll on the second  
We in the club with thugs, this must be heaven  
  
[Chorus]
