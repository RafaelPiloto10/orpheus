The harder I try seems the further I fall  
The deeper my love seems to be  
And I know that I never doubted at all  
That someone was waiting for me  
Then out of the blue, it was over  
And how did you think I would survive  
'Cause it's cold outside  
Yes, it's cold outside of your heart  
Yes, it's cold outside  
Yes, it's cold outside of your heart  
I never thought it could happen to me  
Like the one that gets you  
That you just don't see  
And now I don't want to be free  
I thought it was always to be  
That someone was waiting for me  
The longer the shadows become in my life  
The colder the breeze seems to be  
The days roll on by, still I can't quite believe  
That someone's not waiting for me  
The flame of desire is still burning  
The warmth of your body close to mine  
'Cause it's cold outside  
Yes, it's cold outside of your heart  
Yes, it's cold outside  
Yes, it's cold outside of your heart  
It's a big world to face all alone  
And I'm begging you now  
Just to come on home  
'Cause I, I don't want to be free  
I thought it was always to be  
That someone was waiting for me  
You know that it's you that I need  
You see, I refuse to believe  
That someone's not waiting for me
