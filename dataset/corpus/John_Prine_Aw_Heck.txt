I could be as happy as a sardine in a can  
Long as I got my woman  
I could run stark naked and live in and old oak tree  
Just as long as she's with me  
My woman.  
The cannibals can catch me and fry me in a pan  
Long as I got my woman  
I could get the electric chair for a phony rap  
Long as she's sittin' in my lap  
My woman.  
I'd run a mile, just to see her smile  
And put her lovin arms, around my neck  
Aw heck  
My spine starts a tingling, and bells start a ringling  
When she's with me, can't you see.  
They could torture me and stretch me like a rubber band  
Long as I got my woman  
I could jump off a cliff and never have no fear  
Just as long as she is near  
My woman.
