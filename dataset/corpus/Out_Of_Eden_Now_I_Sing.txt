Can you just give me a second please?  
I would like to give my testimony  
How the Lord has met my every need  
How he saved me, made me holy  
If you want to know the reason why  
I gave it all, this life's no longer mine  
How He made a way kept me alive  
Well, listen close as I testify  
You don't know like I know  
You can't tell it like I can tell it  
Everything the Lord has done for me so  
That you understand, I'm just gonna say it  
(What matter of love is this)  
(That the Father gives to us)  
How he saved my soul  
I want the world to know  
So know I sing  
Just want to sing His praise  
Loving kindness everyday  
Faithfulness that come my way  
I'm gonna clap my hands  
Please excuse me if I start to dance  
'Cause His love is true, His mercies new  
He's been so good to me  
He didn't have to do it but I'm glad He did  
Saved me from my sin  
That old life is gone and new life lives within  
(Of all the things that I could, I write a song)  
I knew I couldn't go wrong  
If I sang of His goodness all day long  
You don't know like I know  
You can't tell like I can tell it  
Everything the Lord has done for me so  
That you understand I'm just gone say it  
(I cannot live my life without Him)  
I made no excuse, if I get a little crazy  
In Him I live and more  
So know I sing  
Just want to sing His praise  
Loving kindness everyday  
Faithfulness that come my way  
I'm gonna clap my hands  
Please excuse me if I start to dance  
'Cause His love is true, His mercies new  
He's been so good to me  
So clap your hands this evening  
Come on y'all said it's alright  
Move a little this evening  
Come on y'all I said it's alright  
Who the Son sets free  
You know is free indeed, you're free  
You've got the need to be praisin'
