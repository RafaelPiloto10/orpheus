(Original by Ryan Adams)  
  
When they call your name  
Will you walk right up  
With a smile on your face?  
Or will you cower in fear  
In your favorite sweater  
With an old love letter?  
I wish you would  
I wish you would  
Come pick me up  
Take me out  
fuck me up  
Steal my records  
screw all my friends  
They're all full of shit  
With a smile on your face  
And then do it again  
I wish you would  
When you're walking downtown  
Do you wish I was there?  
Do you wish it was me?  
With the windows clear and the mannequins eyes  
Do they all look like mine?  
You know you could  
I wish you would  
Come pick me up  
Take me out  
fuck me up  
Steal my records  
screw all my friends behind my back  
With a smile on your face  
And then do it again  
I wish you would  
I wish you'd make up my bed  
So I could make up my mind  
Try it for sleeping instead  
Maybe you'll rest sometime  
I wish I could
