Why don't you sing 'I need you baby'?  
'Cause it rhymes with crazy and it rhymes with maybe  
It rhymes with lady and much much more  
And it doesn't rhyme with the 'f' word  
  
Well Simon le Bon stayed round my house before  
And he was sick on the plants and he was sick on the floor  
And he wouldn't go home until he'd sung his song  
With a backing harmony from Paul Young  
  
Shell we dance again?  
In our special way  
With our trousers round  
our knees  
  
Why don't your video have dancing girls?  
With hips that curve and lips that curl  
Legs are where the heartbeat starts  
It's low in neckline and high in charts  
  
But it's the partially clothed for the partially sighted  
Behind over matter keeps the crowds delighted  
We want Rambo in a ra-ra skirt  
Nastassia Kinski in a Brazilian shirt
