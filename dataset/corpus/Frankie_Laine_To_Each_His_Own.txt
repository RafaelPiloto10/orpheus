A rose must remain with the sun and the rain  
Or it's lovely promise won't come true.  
To each his own, to each his own,  
And my own is you  
  
What good is a song if the words just don't belong?  
And a dream must be a dream for two.  
No good alone, to each his own,  
For me there's you.  
  
If a flame is to grow there must be a glow,  
To open each door there's a key.  
And I need you, I know, I can't let you go,  
Your touch means too much to me.  
  
Two lips must insist on two more to be kissed  
Or they'll never know what love can do.  
To each his own, I've found my own,  
One and only you.
