Girls, they are so lovely  
Oh girls, girls, oh, please love me  
Girls run around in your head  
'Til you wish you had boys instead  
Girls, they are such fragile stuff  
That you just can't get enough  
Oh girls, girls  
They are impossible  
Girls, girls, girls, girls, girls  
Do I have girls?  
Let me tell you about some girls  
I have three girls  
Rhonda, Tracee and Chudney  
I have girls in my bathroom  
Girls in my closet  
Girls wearing my shoes  
My lipstick, my perfume  
Sleeping with my husband  
What was that?  
They say your life changes  
When you have kids  
Bring it way down, Gill  
You know your life doesn't change, it ends
