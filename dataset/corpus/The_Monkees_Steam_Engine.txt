Mr. Engineer, slow the engine down some more.  
You're movin' just a little too fast,  
I've got my foot down clear to the floor.  
  
Steam engine, Engine 99  
Steam drivers, rollin' right on by.  
  
Mr. Engineer, you see I've got a little problem here.  
My baby, she's aboard your train,  
She says she's never comin' back again.  
  
Steam engine, Engine 99  
Steam drivers, rollin' right on by.  
  
She told me good bye, she said I'm leavin' you behind.  
I think I'm gonna die, if I hear that whistle whine.
