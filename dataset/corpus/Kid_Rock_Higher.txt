[Kid Rock]  
And if you feel it  
Then let me know it  
Show it, here's your chance  
Don't blow it  
I got game too player  
Now watch me throw it  
I feel we owe it  
To the people on the real side  
To collide styles because it seems  
Real music died  
We got pride in our city, Detroit  
Kid Rock and Bradley baby, mmm,  
Now that's the real joint  
And when it hits it's like a fist  
From Joe Louis  
Try to get higher than us  
You'll just blow through us...  
  
[Robert Bradley]  
I saw lightening  
I heard thunder  
As the river bout to flow  
I saw faces  
So many places  
Wonderin where I got to go  
Feel like I got to find  
Some kind of peace of mind  
Where I can rest my aching soul  
  
Take me higher  
A little higher  
Save my soul  
Come higher  
Take me up  
Higher  
A little higher  
  
I heard stories  
I got older  
Wonder if I truly believe  
But I'll take what  
You give me brother  
Wonder if I really need  
But I know that  
Come tomorrow  
I'm gonna reach a higher spot  
Smoke and fire  
Take me higher  
Somehow I got to breathe  
  
Take me higher  
A little higher  
Save my soul  
Come higher  
Take me up  
Higher  
A little higher  
Higher  
  
A little higher  
Higher  
Take me up  
  
[Kid Rock]  
And if you feel it in your toes  
And you won't stop  
And if it's deep in your soul  
Then you can't stop  
And if you know what I know  
Then you won't stop  
We're goin way up, way up  
Way up, way up, way up  
  
[Robert Bradley]  
Take me up  
Take me up  
Save my soul  
Come higher  
Take me up  
A little higher  
A little higher  
Higher...
