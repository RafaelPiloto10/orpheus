You may think I'm dumb  
Or you may think you're sly  
But I know what you're cravin'  
I've been watchin' your eyes  
There's a girl 'cross the room  
She's been glancin' this way  
both of you wonderin'  
when you'll have your day  
  
Black honeymoon  
I'll be leavin' you soon  
Next time maybe I'll be the girl  
Across the room  
black honeymoon  
  
She's tossin' her hair  
She won't meet my stare  
I turn to accuse you  
You pretend she's not there  
The pains not so bad  
cause I've played through this game  
The players are different  
But the moves they're the same  
Now she's gone  
And you're smilin' back  
but my blood's turned to ice, ice, ice, ice  
Now I don't feel undone  
And I don't feel afraid  
there's nothing quite so cold  
As the heart you've betrayed
