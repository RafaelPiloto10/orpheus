What planet is this hmm?  
Let there be rock 'n' roll!  
  
It's a Saturday night and I'm home alone  
With the music on quiet I'm flying solo  
Then my feet start moving to the sound of the beat  
Put the music up loud hear it in the street  
Then the neighbors start banging on my front door  
Throw the door wide open saying what's your point  
Come on in let's rock this joint  
  
We got the whole house rocking [Repeat: x5]  
To the mighty power of rock 'n' roll  
  
We dance out of the door, dance into the street  
And all the people are swaying to the musical beat  
We rock down the road and down to the town  
And all the people stare and smile and they get down  
Then the police man says "stop this noise"  
But the beat takes over now he's one of the boys  
The beat's taken over now he's one of the boys  
  
Come on down let's rock this town  
  
We got the whole town rocking [Repeat: x5]  
To the mighty power of rock 'n' roll  
  
Let's go  
Let it roll  
Are you ready?  
Said are you ready?  
The cosmos rocks  
Across seven seas through the Panama,  
Now they're rockin' on beaches  
And they're rockin' in bars  
Don't ask me how and don't ask me why  
From Miami Beach down to old Bondi  
There's a rock 'n' roll fever  
In every place  
Next thing you know  
They'll be rockin' out in space  
  
Come on down let's rock this place  
Come on down and  
Sock it to me  
  
We got the whole world rocking [Repeat: x5]  
To the mighty mighty mighty power  
  
We got the cosmos rocking  
We got the cosmos rocking  
We got the universe rocking  
We got the cosmos rocking  
We got the cosmos rocking  
To the might power of rock 'n' roll
