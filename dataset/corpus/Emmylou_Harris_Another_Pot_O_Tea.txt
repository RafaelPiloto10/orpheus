Put on another pot o' tea  
'Cause I'm in love with the Irish accent to your story  
And I need someone to help me  
  
Well they say that now you don't talk straight  
And that of late it's been my lot to be afraid  
To remember you by anything  
But memories I already keep  
  
So put another pot o' tea  
'Cause I'm love with the Irish accent to your story  
And now I need some sympathy  
  
It's harder when it takes so long to leave  
The table where we all learned to laugh and learned to grieve  
Over the pain that came so close to you  
It comes so close to me today  
  
So put another pot o' tea  
'Cause I'm in love with the Irish accent to your story  
And I need someone to help me
