Don't start to fumble it up  
Just do it  
Go, go  
Don't wanna know about vacations in this cheap motel  
Don't wanna know about your sea green curtains  
'cause all I want and all I need is just some time with you  
Don't complicate it, just do it once again  
Just go for it  
Just go for the second time  
Just go for it, just go, just go  
Don't wanna hear about the time and how it's gettin' late  
How can you stop when I could go for hours  
You need some magic, come on let me lean on you  
Don't look around, you're not goin' anywhere  
Just go for it  
Just go for the second time  
Just go for it, just go, just go for it  
All I need and all I need  
'cause all I want and all I need  
I'm never letting go, baby don't expect me to  
How can you stop when my whole world's exploding  
Look in the mirrors and see the heat of something new  
Why don't we do it, just do it once again  
Just go for it  
Just go for the second time  
Just go for it, just go for it  
Don't be so nervous  
Don't get so hot  
Don't start to fumble it up  
'cause all I want and all I need  
There's such an urgency in everything I need from you  
Stop giving up, you know you can't refuse me  
I've every reason to believe there's still a man in you  
You done it once, so come on go again  
Just go for it  
Just go for the second time  
Just go for it, just go  
Just go for it, just go  
Just go for it, just go  
Just go for it
