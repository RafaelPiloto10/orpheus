What gives you this crazy thought  
That you can talk to my woman  
What's your claim to fame  
What gives you half a mind  
To even think her name  
What's your claim to fame?  
What's your name?  
  
Gonna give you just one more chance  
To make amends to my woman  
You got yourself to blame  
Only thing that's left to do  
Is to think real hard about what you're gonna do  
About your crazy game  
What's your name?  
  
What's your name?  
Who the hell do you think you are?  
What's your game?  
Are you some 'Top of the Pops' star?  
  
What gives you this crazy thought  
That you think you can talk to my woman  
What's your claim to fame?  
What gives you half a mind  
To even think her name  
What's your claim to fame?  
What's your name?
