  
Said I, many times, love is illusion,  
A feeling result of confusion.  
With knowing smile, and blazing sigh,  
A cynical so-and-so was i.  
I felt so sure, so positive,  
So utterly, unchangingly certain.  
But I never was aware of love and you,  
And suddenly I realized  
There was love and you,  
And I, and i.  
In this world of ordinary people  
Extraordinary people  
I'm glad there is you  
In this world of over-rated pleasures  
Of under-rated treasures  
I'm so glad there is you  
I live to love, I love to live with you beside me  
This role so new, I'll muddle through with you to guide me  
In this world where many, many play at love  
And hardly any stay in love  
I'm glad there is you  
  
In this world where many, many play at love  
And hardly any stay in love  
I'm glad there is you  
More than ever, I'm glad there is you
