Fuzzy was an outlaw swamp rat born and raised  
Bought a motorcycle in his younger days  
Rode into Kentucky to join the outlaw band  
Fuzzy taught me how to make a livin' off the land  
Fuzzy ran a tractor in the early mornin' dew  
Taught me how to plant the crops, and showed me what to do  
Stitch and Stew sat on the porch while Debbie fixed a meal  
Turpentine my old brown horse was grazin' in the field  
  
Fuzzy was an outlaw swamp rat born and raised  
  
Fuzzy's hair was longer than the outlaws that I knew  
Dirty blond and curly wearing pants of faded blue  
A barefoot bearded swamp rat  
But a man above all others  
Never was the kind to turn his back upon his brothers  
  
Fuzzy was an outlaw swamp rat born and raised
