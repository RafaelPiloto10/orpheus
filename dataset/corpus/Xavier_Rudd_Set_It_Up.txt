Turn around to the jungle  
Turn around outside  
It's out there in the jungle  
There is truth among lies  
And I've been to cold dark places  
And I've had a broken shoulder  
The code of the cold dark places  
Have some bright one feel so warm  
And if you want her up be sure to help you down  
And if you burn it up you take the ashes to the ground  
And if you grow it keep the truth deep, deep down  
And if you set it up be sure to set it down  
See you laugh with those voices  
See you laugh with their heads  
And thoughts that I felt to be pulling  
It send new shades of gray  
And I've been to cold dark places  
And I've had leave old mind  
The code of the cold dark places  
Seem to help the sun to shine  
And if you want her up be sure to help you down  
And if you burn it up you take the ashes to the ground  
And if you grow it up keep the truth deep, deep down  
And if you set it up be sure to set it down  
Searching, searching for close  
Closest to the people that I love the most  
Start to feel you and everything you do  
As everything you do comes back to you  
Spirits, of evil and grace intrusion of the mind  
And intrusion of the space  
And I'm sorry 'cause everything I do  
And everything you do comes back to you  
I feel you and everything I do  
As everything you do comes back to you  
I feel you and everything I do  
'Cause everything I do comes back to you
