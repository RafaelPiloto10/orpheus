Take along some of your favorite things  
'Cause you're gonna need 'em  
Wait right here  
Wait 'til I come back around  
You and I will go  
We'll just sit and watch it all go down  
Down Down  
  
I was fakin'  
While you waited for change to come  
I lied when I said I couldn't stay here anymore  
When you and I just can't seem to get along  
You and I both know  
We'll just wait until it all calms down  
Down Down  
Down Down  
Down Down  
  
Careful of the things you want to say  
'Cause you're gonna mean 'em  
Break my pride  
My backbone is feelin' strong  
You and I both know  
What we hold would never pull it down  
Down Down  
Down Down  
Down Down  
  
Take along some of your favorite things  
'Cause you're gonna need 'em
