Dan:  
Can you tell me  
What it is you're afraid of?  
And can you tell me  
Why I'm afraid it's me?  
  
Can I touch you?  
We've been fine for so long now,  
How can something go wrong  
That I can't see?  
  
'Cause I'm holding on,  
And I won't let go.  
I just thought you should know...  
  
I am the one who knows you,  
I am the one who cares,  
I am the one who's always been there.  
I am the one who's helped you,  
And if you think that  
I just don't give a damn,  
Then you just don't know who I am.  
  
Dan:  
Could you leave me?  
  
Gabe:  
Hey dad, it's me.  
  
Dan:  
Could you let me go under?  
  
Gabe:  
Why can't you see?  
  
Dan:  
Will you watch as I drown,  
  
Both:  
And wonder why?  
  
Dan:  
Are you bleeding?  
  
Gabe:  
Are you waiting, are you wishing  
Are you wanting all that she can't give?  
  
Dan:  
Are you bruised? Are you broken?  
  
Gabe:  
Are you hurting, are you healing  
Are you hoping for a life to live?  
  
Dan:  
Does it help you to know  
  
Both:  
Well, so am I.  
  
Dan:  
Tell me what to do  
  
Gabe:  
Look at me.  
  
Dan:  
Tell me who to be  
  
Gabe:  
Look at me.  
  
Dan:  
So I can see  
  
Both:  
What you see.  
  
Dan:  
I am the one who'll hold you,  
  
Gabe:  
I am...  
  
Dan:  
I am the one who'll stay,  
  
Gabe:  
I am...  
  
Dan:  
I am the one  
  
Both:  
I won't walk away.  
  
Dan:  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
I am the one who'll heal you  
  
Gabe:  
I am...  
  
Dan:  
And now you tell me that  
I won't give a damn  
  
Gabe  
You don't give a damn.  
  
Dan:  
But I know you know  
  
Both:  
Who I am.  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Dan:  
That's who  
  
Both:  
I am.  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Dan:  
That's who  
  
Both:  
I am.  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Dan:  
That's who I am.  
'Cause I'm holding on...  
  
Diana:  
You say you hurt like me...  
  
Gabe:  
And I won't let go...  
  
Diana:  
You say that you know...  
  
Dan and Gabe:  
Yeah I thought you should know.  
  
Diana:  
Oh... You don't know  
  
Dan and Gabe:  
I am the one who knows you,  
  
Diana:  
I know you don't know.  
  
Dan and Gabe:  
I am the one who cares,  
  
Diana  
You say that you're hurting,  
  
Dan and Gabe:  
I am the one  
  
Diana:  
I know it ain't so.  
  
Dan and Gabe:  
Who's always been there.  
  
Diana:  
You don't know.  
  
Dan and Gabe:  
Yeah yeah yeah  
I am the one who needs you,  
  
Diana:  
Why don't you just go?  
  
Dan and Gabe:  
And if you think that  
  
Diana:  
'Cause it lays me low  
  
Dan and Gabe:  
I just don't give a damn  
  
Diana:  
When you say  
  
Dan:  
Then you just don't know  
Who I am...  
  
Diana:  
You don't know...  
  
Dan:  
Who I am...  
  
Diana:  
You don't know...  
  
Dan:  
Who I am...  
  
Gabe:  
You just don't know who I am.
