Sometimes we make each other cry  
Sometimes we're locked inside the prisons of our pride  
And sometimes we break each others heart with the words we say  
Let anger get in the way too many times  
But always after all, all  
Love is all that matters  
After everything, one thing remains the same  
One thing we cannot change  
We all have one heart  
And one heart needs another  
Love, love is all that matters  
Love is all that matters, it matters after all  
Sometimes we search this world for gold  
When all we really need is just a hand to hold  
Sometimes we let the greatest treasure just slip away  
With words we forget to say too many times  
But always after all, all  
Love is all that matters  
After everything, one thing remains the same  
One thing we cannot change  
We, we all have one heart  
And one heart needs another  
Love, love is all that matters  
Love is all that matters, it matters after all  
After all that we've been through  
It comes down to one simple truth  
You need me, I need you  
'Cause love is all that matters  
Love is all that matters  
It matters after all  
Love is all that matters  
It's the only thing that matters  
It matters after all  
Love is all that matters
