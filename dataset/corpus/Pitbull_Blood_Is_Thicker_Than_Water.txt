I know y'all listen to my music (red eyes)  
But what I'm a do know is try and describe my life to y'all  
  
Sometimes I fell like I'm loosing it  
My life is upside down  
A gift and a curse that's my life now  
There is no looking or turning back  
I used to watch coke turn to crack that's what made me turn to rap  
I fell like Keanu Reeves in the movie Devils Advocate  
Confused but blessed with extravagance  
I thank god for all the opportunities  
Given the opportunity dem boys would put two in me (bla bla bla)  
We live in the land of the free, hustlers and thieves  
I made money now I got uncle Sam hustling  
Me for a quarter of what I make  
Hand a quarter sentence to a fake and watch them turn state (that's right)  
Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is)  
Until the fed's step in (that's just the way it is)  
Most of these fools are characters  
Men with no character welcome to America  
Where we fight for freedom  
If ain't about oil than we don't need them  
Ain't that the truth?  
Pitbull I'm just tell y'all the way I fell  
Thank god that god made me to keep it real  
  
[Chorus]  
Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is)  
Until the fed's step in (that just the way it is)  
Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is)  
Till that fame step in (that's just the way it is)  
Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is)  
Till dem bitches step in (that's just the way it is)  
Blood is thicker than water (at least they say it is)  
Till that money step in (that's just the way it is)  
  
Huh hun yo  
After the turf war the smoke clears  
All these years around these busta I'm convinced there ain't no hope here  
In the past four years of my lifetime  
I witness leaders sacrifice freedom just to get this pipeline  
Guess I'm chosen at the right time mama stress  
Facing the table and she's snorting up white line  
Blood is thicker than water  
In a few cases your daughter can have touched for the money that in dem suit
case  
Tighten my shoelaces the fugitive running  
In fear of a criminal past 'cause dem folks is coming  
I've been wrongfully judged being from this environment  
The city gangs planning retirement  
I'm a a Dade nigga  
Voicing my set 'cause a spray quick  
Took some of the same steps through little Haiti  
As these main nigga (like who) hit man, big dog, and she hound  
Y'all predict it back then shit I see it know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I escape poverty (poverty)  
I don't own jewelry motherfucker I own property  
You can send dem tsunamis that hit Indonesia (but but but)  
Ain't no motherfucking thing stopping me  
Like good coke I'm a good swimmer  
God knows I done lost but god dam I'm a good winner  
It feels great to make something out of nothing  
Yea I'm humble but I tell y'all to push a chicos buttons  
And watch how them thing get to dumping  
Real estate New York game now you saying something  
I only talk about what I know about  
Illegal turn legal this year that's what I'm all about  
I'm from the south and I ain't gonna lie  
At fist time I preach ye till god struck me with pride  
I was confused now I'm like let's ride  
Three o five till I die  
Three o five till I die  
  
[Chorus]
