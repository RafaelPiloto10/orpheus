You're the air that I breathe, you're the sun when it breaks through the
clouds  
You're all that I need, but I know that you're having some doubts  
I'm down on my knees, I'm praying you'll stake this out  
I'm begging you please girl, I'm sorry I let you down  
I'm broken like a promise, I'm shattered like a dream  
I'm broken with all my pieces scattered round for you to see  
I'm broken like a record, I sing the same old song  
I'm broken like the heart of a man that's run away from love too long  
Girl what about you, what about you girl  
It's so hard to speak, I can barely look you in the eye  
It's so hard to breathe, but I know I ain't afraid to die  
Your breath is so sweet, your kisses could get me high  
My heart is so weak, but your loving could get me by  
I'm broken like a promise, I'm shattered like a dream  
I'm broken with all my pieces scattered round for you to see  
I'm broken like a record, I sing the same old song  
I'm broken like the heart of a man that's run away from love too long  
Girl what about you, what about you girl  
I'm broken like a promise, I'm shattered like a dream  
I'm broken with all my pieces scattered round for you to see  
I'm broken like a record, I sing the same old song  
I'm broken like the heart of a man that's run away from love too long  
Girl what about you, what about you girl  
Girl what about you, what about you girl, girl what about you
