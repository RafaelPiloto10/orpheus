Well you're magic he said  
But don't let it all go to your head  
Well I bet if you all had it all figured out  
Then you'd never get out of bed  
No doubt  
All the thing's that I've read what he wrote me  
Is now sounding like the man I was hoping  
To be  
Keep on keeping it real  
Cause it keeps getting easier indeed  
He's the reason that I'm laughing  
Even if there's no one else  
He said, you've got to love yourself  
  
You say, you shouldn't mumble when you speak  
But keep your tongue up in your cheek  
And if you stumble on to  
You better remember that it's humble that you seek  
You got all the skill you need,  
Individuality  
You got something  
Call it gumption  
Call it anything you want  
Because when you play the fool now  
You're only fooling everyone else  
You're learning to love yourself  
  
There's no price to pay  
When you give and what you take,  
That's why it's easy to thank you  
You  
  
Let's say take a break from the day  
And get back to the old garage  
Because life's too short anyway  
But at least it's better then average  
As long as you got me  
And I got you  
You know we'll got a lot to go around  
I'll be your friend  
Your other brother  
Another love to come and comfort you  
And I'll keep reminding  
If it's the only thing I ever do  
I will always love  
I will always love you  
Yes you  
I will always, always, always, always love  
I will always, always love  
I will always, always love, love
