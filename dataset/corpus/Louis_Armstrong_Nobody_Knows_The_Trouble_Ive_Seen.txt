Nobody knows the trouble I've seen  
Nobody knows but Jesus  
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen  
Glory, Hallelujah  
  
Sometimes I'm up  
And sometimes I'm down  
Yes, Lord, you know sometimes I'm almost to the ground  
Oh, yes, Lord, still  
  
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen  
Nobody knows but Jesus  
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen  
Glory, Hallelujah  
  
If you get there before I do  
Oh, yes, Lord, don't forget to  
Tell all my friends I'm coming too  
Oh, yes, Lord, still  
  
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen  
Nobody knows but Jesus  
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen  
Glory, Hallelujah  
  
Although you see me  
Goin' on so, oh, yes  
I have my trials here below  
Oh, yes, Lord
