There is something special  
About this time of year  
The Christmas feeling's everywhere  
I just got home  
To join You  
I've been away too long  
But now I'm back to share my love  
Friends are reunited  
One big family  
Filled with love to last  
Throughout the year  
  
[Chorus]  
Christmas time  
Time to share our love  
Come and joy  
The tidings to the world  
Christmas time  
The best time of the year  
Yes, it's Christmas time  
  
You and me together  
A sleigh ride in the park  
A loving kiss straight from my heart  
Straight from the heart  
Snowflakes are falling gently  
The smell of chestnuts in the air  
And Christmas lights they gleam  
Across the sky  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Do you remember?  
Everything felt so right  
When I held you close to me  
Do you remember?  
Those cold Christmas nights  
When we sewed the world in harmony  
  
Christmas time  
Time to share our love  
Come and joy  
The tidings to the world  
Christmas time  
Always the best time
