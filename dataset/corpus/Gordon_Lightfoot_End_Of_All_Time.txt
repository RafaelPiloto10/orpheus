Oft times, I recall how it was in days gone by  
No tears at all, now you better not make me cry  
Because you know darn well  
I may ring your bell  
Is there anybody home?  
Is there anyone in there?  
Who can tell me where I am?  
Oft times, I recall when there wasn't no need to lie  
So much was said but we never did say goodbye  
Oh, how I long to hear you whisper in my ear  
Is there anybody home, don't you know I'm all alone?  
Can you tell me where I am?  
All I can do is love you 'til the end of all time  
One day, time will tell when you're living in yesterday  
Thinking of things to do, thinking of things to say  
Thinking of things divine, find a bottom line  
Is there anybody home?  
Is there anyone in there?  
Who can tell me where I am  
Oft times I recall, I was thinking of ways to win  
Ready to risk it, all until it wore thin  
Oh, how I long to hear you whisper in my ear  
Is there anybody home, don't you know, I'm all alone  
Can you tell me where I am?  
All I can do, is love you 'til the end of all time  
All I can do is love you 'til the end of all time
