The plane is waiting, you must to go  
'Goodbye I'm gonna miss you'  
And all the things you say at a leaving  
Ah just turn your head and walk away  
  
Goodbye little Columbus  
Goodbye, I'll see you one day  
Goodbye little Columbus  
Travelling, just travelling  
  
That certain moment, the final call  
And that desperate search for 'C'est la vie'  
Oh what you'd give to hear of a slight delay  
Ah just turn your head and walk away  
Walk away, just walk away  
  
Goodbye little Columbus  
Goodbye, I'll see you one day  
Goodbye little Columbus  
Travelling, just travelling  
You've made up your mind  
And you've got to go
