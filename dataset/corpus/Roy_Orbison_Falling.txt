I'm falling, I'm falling  
Falling in love with you  
  
Baby, come closer closer to me, and listen listen so carefully  
Remember all the nights that I told you that I loved you  
It wasn't true,I used you,and you were just someone new  
  
To thrill this lonely heart of mine  
I was lying all the time  
Pretending to be falling in love with you  
But it's different now, I've kissed you now  
So forgive me forgive me somehow  
  
Hold me tight for tonight, then tell me truth  
If you still love me, say that you love me  
Don't leave me now  
  
Now that I'm falling for you  
I'm falling, I'm falling  
Falling in love, falling in love with you
