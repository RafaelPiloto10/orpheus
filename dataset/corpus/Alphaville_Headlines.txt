We call ourselves the crown of creation  
I wonder what does it mean  
We're not the owners of the moon and the earth  
It's like a roundabout  
And it goes round and round for free  
We've made some gruesome inventions  
Yet we're mastered by those systems  
We're endangered danger, we're running out of fashion  
If we don't care for responsibility, hey-hey  
We're endangered danger, we're endangered danger  
We're the headlines today but all that we say is  
We're endangered danger  
Eric says that we're a lonely species  
That's why we're playing the fools  
But once we'll enter the aquarian age  
I sometimes catch him floating in his swimming-pool  
He says  
If we'd tune in to our brighter sides  
We'd feel like Jesus on the waters  
Cause we're sailors not soldiers  
So much more for this show  
Than a guest-appearance in the universe, here we go  
We're endangered danger, we're endangered danger  
We're the headlines today but all that we say is  
We're endangered danger
