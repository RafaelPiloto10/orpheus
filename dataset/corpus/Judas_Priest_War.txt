We come in all the glory now  
No prayers suffice such evil foe  
Black wings, the storm is gathering  
And time will say  
We know the power of heresy  
Is on it's way  
  
[Chorus]  
Gods of war  
Heed their warning  
Gods of war  
They are coming now  
  
No man can quell the suffering  
The hell and all the grief it brings  
Our life is almost over now  
there's nothing more  
We feel the pain is everywhere  
It comes and roars  
  
[Chorus]  
Gods of war  
Judge and jury  
Gods of war  
Pain and fury now  
  
We must hold this threat  
From such panic yet  
There will come a time  
When we'll be saved  
Our resilient heart  
To confound defeat yeah!  
  
Out of purgatory  
Unto victory  
We shall overcome  
The war they staged  
Through unyielding power  
In the darkest hour  
They will retreat  
  
[Chorus]  
Gods of war  
Devastation  
Gods of war  
End creation now!
