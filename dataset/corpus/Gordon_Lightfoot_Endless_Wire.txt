I ain't got nothin' to hide  
My mind is an endless wire  
I got both feet on the ground  
I ain't got no one for hire  
I ain't got a thing to show  
My lines have all expired  
So don't go foolin' around  
And set my wheels afire  
Down in the dark of a burnt out soul  
There's a few good second hand dreams  
Deep in the dark of a heavenly night with you  
Down in the black of a bottomless hole  
There's a few good second hand scenes  
Deep in the dark of the heavenly blue  
Where the sea runs green  
I ain't got nothin' to give  
My life is an endless climb  
My love's a paperback dream  
I don't have nothin' but time  
I ain't got a thing to show  
I don't know my own name  
So don't go foolin' around  
And set my wheels afire  
Down in the dark of a burnt out soul  
There's a few good second hand dreams  
Deep in the dark of a heavenly night with you  
Down in the black of a bottomless hole  
There's a few good second hand scenes  
Deep in the dark of the heavenly blue  
Where the sea runs green  
I ain't got nothin' to hide  
My mind is an endless wire  
I got both feet on the ground  
I don't have no one for hire  
I ain't got a thing to show  
My life is an endless dream  
My love's a paperback dream  
I ain't got nothin' but time
