The drunk mortician lurches  
Past the broken windowed churches  
He starts to laugh and cry  
At the same time  
What really makes him drink  
Is the time he has to think  
And he knows that there is  
Nowhere he can hide  
He's got people making speeches  
Hang around like leeches  
To drink that heady drug  
Of untold power  
Their arguments are quoted  
And the winner then is voted but  
The loser always has  
The finest hour...  
So what are we going to do now  
On heaven and earth  
What are we going to do now  
Tell me what is worth to you...  
Doctors try to save them  
Priests don't know how to tell them  
There's nothing you can do but repent  
You might think that he's a hero  
But like Nixon Mao or Nero  
All you know is that they came... Then they went  
So what are we going to do now  
On heaven and earth  
What are we going to do now  
Tell me what is worth  
So what are we going to do now  
On heaven and earth  
What are we going to do now  
Tell me what is worth to you
