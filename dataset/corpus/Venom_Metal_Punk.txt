Metal Punk is rising wild  
Antenae scouts the way  
Ready for the danger  
In the game he has to play  
Nowhere to hide  
Nowhere to live  
Nowhere to run  
Metal Punk  
No time to die  
Metal Punk - Feel it  
Metal Punk - c'mon  
Metal Punk  
Metal Punk - Take it  
Metal Punk dilates the cries  
A message all is well  
The changes take their place  
Amongst the sentinel  
Nowhere to run  
Metal Punk  
Nowhere to hide  
Nowhere to live  
No time to die  
Metal Punk - Feel it  
Metal Punk  
Metal Punk - c'mon  
Metal Punk - Take it  
Metal Punk animalize  
Metal Punk  
Metal Punk watch his eyes  
Metal make a punk of me  
For satanic majesty  
Savage mind  
Damage child  
Metal PunkBoiling high
