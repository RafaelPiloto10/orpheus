When the blue shirts run out in Argentina  
Our hearts will be beating like a drum  
And your nerves are so shattered you can't take it  
Automatically you reach out for the run  
But there really isn't any cause for panic  
Ally's army had it all under control  
It's not merely speculations  
It's not just imagination  
To bring the World Cup home is Scotland's goal  
  
Ole ola, Ole ola  
We're gonna bring that World Cup back from over there  
Ole ola, Ole ola  
We're gonna bring that World Cup back from over there  
  
We got Dalglish, Buchan and Macari  
We got Archie Gemmill, Johnstone and McQueen  
We got Big Joe Jordan waiting at the middle and the best support  
This world has ever seen  
We got Donachie, Rioch and Don Masson  
We got Andy Gray and Asa Hartford too  
And with this lethal combination it's a fair estimation  
That the World Cup will be ours the end of June  
  
Ole ola, Ole ola  
We're gonna bring that World Cup back from over there  
Ole ola, Ole ola  
We're gonna bring that World Cup back from over there  
  
Oh, Brazil, this time I don't think so  
Holland without Cruyff just ain't the same  
Germany will, we feel, be a challenge  
The Italians can still play the game  
But there's really only one team in it  
We'll be singing as we'll get off of the plane  
We are bound for Buenos Aires, we don't care just what they tell us  
Only wish we had Danny McGrain  
  
Ole ola, Ole ola  
We're gonna bring that World Cup back from over there  
Willie Johnstone, then it goes to Dalglish. Lou Macari supporting. There's on
opener, defended by Buchan, there's Kenny Dalglish in there. Oh, what a goal!
Oh, yes! That does it!  
They'll be singing up there in Aberdeen and Dundee  
Glasgow will be reaching fever pitch  
'Cause with a nation of five million we're gonna really turn the heat on  
'Cause we invented football anyway  
  
Ole ola, Ole ola  
We're gonna bring that World Cup back from over there Yes, we are  
Ole ola, Ole ola  
We're gonna bring that World Cup back from over there  
Ole ola, Ole ola  
We're gonna bring that World Cup back from over there All together now:  
Ole ola, Ole ola  
We're gonna bring that World Cup back from over there. One more  
Ole ola, Ole ola  
We're gonna bring that World Cup back from over there Yes, we are  
Ole ola, Ole ola  
We're gonna bring that World Cup back from over there. I know, I know  
Ole ola, Ole ola  
We're gonna bring that World Cup back from over there  
Ole ola, Ole ola  
We're gonna bring that World Cup back from over there
