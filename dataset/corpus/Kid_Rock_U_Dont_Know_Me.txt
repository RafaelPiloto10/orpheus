Here here we go from Japan to Romeo  
My flow is slow and it's ya know my first time on radio  
Now some say I'm foul, some say I'm wild  
And that all might be true  
  
But it did not happen overnight  
So let me tell my tale to you  
It started out when I was six just tellin' dirty jokes  
My mother overheard and washed my mouth out with soap  
  
Now as I grew I always knew what it was for me to do  
Never front just be blunt and always tell the truth  
Never fake, I never act like something that I'm not  
Remember me I'm that foul mouthed kid that lived around your block  
  
You thought that I was crazy like a dog chasin it's tail  
And by the time I turned of legal age I'd probably be in jail  
In school my teachers thought I was just a foul mouthed freak  
Now their yearly salary is what I make in just one week  
  
So to thepeople who used to say you think you know it all  
Maybe I do and maybe I don't but right now I'm standin tall...  
And you don't know me  
It's funny how one kid can cause so much confusion  
  
Parents should be happy I'm the dop their kids are using  
Now some people think this business is all fame and glory  
But there's a flip side to that truth so let me kick my story  
It took me oh so long to reach the point I'm at  
  
Every time I take one stip forward they push me two steps back  
I give an inch they take a mile some try to cramp my style  
They try to diss they shoot they miss  
I walk off with a smile  
  
But time will pass and I'll out last anyone who doubts me  
And the booty naked truth is you don't know shit about me  
So when I'm in your town to nearst mic please kindly show me  
So you can see what's really me and find out you don't know me  
  
'cause you don't know me  
Now you might want to party man so here's your party jam  
Hey girly in that skirt I want you just like Uncle Sam  
Let's knock boots, let's knock boots right down to the nitty gritty  
  
With every drind 'n every blink you seem to get more pretty  
So out the bar straight to my car now what's left to do  
She was sayin I love you so I said yeah I love you to  
(Ha!)  
  
Next day I awoke I almost choked  
Who's bringin me inside,  
My head was ringin' heard people singin' "here comes the bride"  
Thinkin just what was I drinkin as I looked around to see  
  
The girl I met last night was at the alter waitin on me  
Next thing I know I'm face to face with holy matrimony  
Looked at that bitch and I quick screamiN'  
You don't know me...She didn't know me  
  
Girls around this country think I'm nasty think I'm sexist  
But they bought my first L.P.  
You know-Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast  
Sayin ooh your this and oooh your that uh uh uh hold up cutie  
  
What's your favorite song off that L.P.  
"Ah, Wax that Booty"  
A lesson taught, I know you thought my dirty raps were kinda funny  
But close minded people thought I was only out to make money  
  
But check on back 'cause it's a fact obscenity is no new thing  
Remember Chuck Berry and when he sang My Ding A Ling  
But for me I feel what I see and I say just what I feel  
And in this world everything I see you know is all too real  
  
Even though I don't look the same 'cause I cut off my flat top  
I'll always say just what I feel 'cause that's the real Kid Rock...  
And you don't know me.
