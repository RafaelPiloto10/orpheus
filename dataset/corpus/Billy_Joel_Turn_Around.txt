Oh, sweet lady, runnin' like a stream  
You don't look back because you know your hands are clean  
You make believe the past was just a dream  
You make believe the past was just a dream  
Turn around, turn around  
And I will sing for you a song  
I don't know where you been  
But you've been gone too long  
Oh, Elisa, you must begin again  
And all the roads that you have walked are comin' to an end  
I was your lover but I thought I was your friend  
I loved you but I thought I was your friend  
Turn around, turn around  
And I will sing for you a song  
I don't know where you been  
But you've been gone too long  
Oh, sweet lady, stand beside the sea  
Maybe you will find a little time to think of me  
Won't you please remember what I tried so hard to be  
Yeah, remember what I tried so hard to be  
So turn around, turn around  
And I will sing for you a song  
And I don't know where you been  
But you've been gone too long
