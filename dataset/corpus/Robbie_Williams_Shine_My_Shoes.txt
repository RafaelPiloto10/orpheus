Another dawn, another day, another dollar to be made.  
I got a pocket in my soul, where a little rock a little roll assimilate  
And I don't care what you think you know  
'Bout who I am and how it goes  
I made it easy to be me so yeah, It's easy to be me  
And it's why I say  
(Chorus)  
I know you can't stand me cause I make you so angry more and more each day  
Hey hey hey  
The way you don't love me kind of makes you look ugly and the words you say  
Hey hey hey  
Come up and see me, I kind of like the abuse  
Hey hey hey  
There's no room in my bed  
But while you're here just bow your head and you can shine my shoes  
Shine my shoes  
Get outta my lane boy, you're not in my league  
Some are born to thrive and some to underachieve  
Here's something that'll make you sick  
I'm as happy as a pig in Sh--  
I've been amused, I've been about, I've been amazed, I've been betrayed  
That's why I say  
(Chorus)  
I know you can't stand me cause I make you so angry more and more each day  
Hey hey hey  
The way you don't love me kind of makes you look ugly and the words you say  
Hey hey hey  
Come up and see me, oh oh oh, if you can take the abuse  
Hey hey hey  
There's no room in my bed  
But while you're here just lend a hand and you can shine my shoes  
Shine my shoes  
Kneel down boy  
(Chorus)  
It's why you can't stand me, you make me so angry more and more each day  
Hey hey hey  
The way you don't love me kind of makes you look ugly every the words you say  
Hey hey hey  
Come up and see me, oh oh oh, I kind of like the abuse  
Hey hey hey  
There's no room in my bed  
But while you're here then bow your head and you can shine my shoes  
Shine my shoes  
Shine my shoes  
Until I see my face
