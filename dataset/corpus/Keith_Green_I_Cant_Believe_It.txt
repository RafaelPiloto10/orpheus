There is nothing new  
I could give to you  
Just a life that's torn  
waiting to be born  
  
Rivers overflow  
friends may come and go  
But you've been by my side  
with every tear I've cried  
  
Oh, I can't believe that You'd give everything for me  
I can't believe it no, I can't believe it no, no  
I know You never lied and so it's just my foolish pride  
That I just won't receive it yeah  
It's so hard to receive it in my heart and make the start with you  
  
Help me, help me now  
I just don't know how  
You know, I've been so alone  
please melt this heart of stone  
  
La, la, la, la  
  
Oh, I can't believe that You'd give everything for me  
I can't believe it no, I can't believe it no, no  
I know You never lied and so I'm giving up my pride  
So I can receive it yeah  
I just want to receive it in my heart and make the start with you  
  
La, la, la
