VERSE  
When the mountains fall  
And the tempest roars You are with me  
When creation folds  
Still my soul will soar on Your mercy  
  
PRE-CHORUS  
I'll walk through the fire  
With my head lifted high  
And my spirit revived in Your story  
And I'll look to the cross  
As my failure is lost  
In the light of Your glorious grace  
  
CHORUS  
Let the ruins come to life  
In the beauty of Your Name  
Rising up from the ashes  
God forever You reign  
  
And my soul will find refuge  
In the shadow of Your wings  
I will love You forever  
And forever I'll sing  
  
VERSE  
When the world caves in  
Still my hope will cling to Your promise  
Where my courage ends  
Let my heart find strength in Your presence
