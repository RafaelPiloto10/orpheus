Come to my loveland, wander along  
Beautiful gardens full of flowers and songs  
Come to the sunshine, beaches and sand  
Here's the two bluebirds, won't you come to my land  
  
The grass is mellow and the sky is blue  
My paradise is waiting here for you  
  
Oh, it's a tropical loveland  
Oh, I want to share it with you  
Life can be funny  
Happy and sunny  
Oh, in my tropical loveland  
  
Come to my loveland, wander with me  
Lie with me darling in the shade of a tree  
Over the rainbow, under the moon  
That's where my land is, won't you come to me soon?  
  
Just take my hand, I'll show you everything  
The secrets that my paradise can bring  
  
Oh, it's a tropical loveland  
Oh, I want to share it with you  
Life can be funny  
Happy and sunny  
Oh, in my tropical loveland  
  
Oh, it's a tropical loveland  
Oh, I want to share it with you  
(I want to share it with you)  
Oh, it's a tropical loveland  
(It's a tropical loveland)  
Oh, I want to share it with you  
Oh, it's a tropical loveland  
Oh, I want to share it with you
