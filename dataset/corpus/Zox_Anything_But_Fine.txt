If I could write you a song  
With all the right words,  
When would these black clouds begin to burn up  
The moment you heard?  
  
If I could make you a map,  
Would you find your way home?  
You know you can't keep me alive  
Leave me alone.  
  
Tell me I'm yours.  
Tell me you're mine.  
Tell me I'm anything but fine.  
Tell me a story.  
Tell me the time.  
Tell me a lie.  
  
If I could make you a tape  
With all the right noise,  
Would you smile when you listen and sigh  
Boys will be boys?  
  
If I could paint you a picture,  
I'd turn black into white.  
By now I'm not lookin' for love,  
Just lookin' for tonight.  
  
So tell me I'm yours.  
Tell me you're mine.  
Tell me I'm anything but fine.  
Tell me a story.  
Tell me the time.  
Tell me a lie.  
  
And tell me I'm yours.  
Tell me you're mine.  
Tell me I'm anything but fine.  
Tell me a story.  
Tell me the time.  
Tell me a lie.  
  
Tell me what I want to hear  
Tomorrow I will disappear,  
You won't ever have to see me again.  
  
And tell me I'm yours.  
Tell me you're mine.  
Tell me I'm anything but fine.  
Tell me a story.  
Tell me the time.  
Tell me a lie.  
  
You said that words can only get you so far,  
But I've got sentences that cover up all my scars.  
In the end I might forget where they are,  
Talk to me tonight.  
  
And if we started all over today,  
I think we know that we'd end up in the same place.  
Maybe you're right and we've got nothing to say,  
I want to hear it anyway.  
I want to hear it anyway.
