I walk the wire every night  
I can't decide between wrong and right  
I've lost control over the things I do  
'Cause I'm hopelessly falling in love with you  
  
Now the one who never took a chance  
Becomes a victim of circumstance  
I've lost my way now I'm so confused  
'Cause I'm hopelessly falling in love with you  
  
All my dreams are far behind me  
They don't matter any more  
I don't care about the things I could lose  
'Cause I'm hopelessly falling in love with you  
  
Now the one who always played it safe  
Becomes another who's lost his way  
I can't believe it though I know it's true  
'Cause I'm hopelessly falling in love with you  
  
All my dreams begin to blind me  
And I was so confused  
And I don't care about the things I could lose  
'Cause I'm hopelessly falling in love with you  
  
I'm not gonna fight it I'm gonna choose  
To hopelessly fall oh yeah  
You know I'll hopelessly fall in love with you
