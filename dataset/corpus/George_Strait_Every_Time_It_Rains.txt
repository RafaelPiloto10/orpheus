Every time my ship comes in  
A hurricane blows it out again  
Stormy weather seems to hang around my door  
My sweet bird of paradise  
Flew the coop on me last night  
Oh, and every time it rains, lord don't it pour  
  
I got a letter from the I. Are. S  
They said, son, you're in a hell of a mess  
Our computer shows you owe ten-thousand more  
That machine's made a bad mistake  
'cause that's more than this poor boy makes  
Oh, and every time it rains, lord don't it pour  
  
Every time it rains I just wash my car  
The whole neighbourhood goes  
Swimmin' in my front yard  
Well, my mother-in-law says she's  
Stayin' three weeks more  
Oh, and every time it rains, lord don't it pour  
  
Just got my car out of the shop  
Two blocks down the street it stopped  
I went to use the telephone at the grocery store  
I walked back to my chevrolet  
But they towed that sucker away  
Oh, and every time it rains, lord don't it pour  
  
Every time it rains I just wash my car  
The whole neighbourhood goes  
Swimmin' in my front yard  
Well, my mother-in-law says she's  
Stayin' three weeks more  
Oh, and every time it rains, lord don't it pour  
Well, every time it rains, lord don't it pour
