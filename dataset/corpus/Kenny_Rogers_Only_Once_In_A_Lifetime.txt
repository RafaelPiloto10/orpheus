You ask me if someday  
You'll hear me say goodbye  
I couldnt walk away  
If I tried.  
  
Oh I know  
My feelings go  
Unspoken sometimes  
  
Chorus  
You can put all your tears away  
This time forever's here to stay  
I know a love like yours and mine  
Happens only once in a lifetime.  
  
I hold you close to me  
And our love comes alive  
I never dreamed I could be  
So satisfied  
  
If fate is kind  
Just once we find  
Such heaven in this life  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Bridge  
I might see lightening strike  
Twice in the same place  
But I know I'd never see  
Love like you've given me.
