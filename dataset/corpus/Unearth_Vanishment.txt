Take my hand and come with me.  
Take a plate full of everything here.  
That's more than what you need.  
  
All my life.  
I've given back.  
Build an army to set us back on track.  
You'll see when nothing is here.  
Then who will you blame?  
  
A sickening growl from our forgotten planet.  
It's bare and scarred from all we've taken from it.  
Then who will you blame?  
Now everything must change!  
All must change!  
  
We're all damned.  
Raped unfed world.  
  
Gone.  
Change.  
  
Save enough for them.  
There will be nothing left, but waste.  
Save enough for them.  
There will be nothing left
