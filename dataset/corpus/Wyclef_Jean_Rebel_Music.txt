The preacher's son with the rebel music  
Rebel music, put the peace sign up now  
Rebel music, all my gangs put the peace sign up now  
Rebel music, everywhere put the peace sign up now  
Rebel music, hold on, listen  
  
Tell the DJ turn the music up  
Gangsters in the club, everybody thugs  
Me I play the walk, sipping on the Guinness  
Cause in reality we are the same and it's  
Just society they want to see me  
Flesh on the concrete, sold a perfect story  
The mystery is waking up in misery  
The music industry brainwash celebrities  
Girls sleep sexy, they wake up with a monster  
Have no idea that their face was a piranha  
Word from the wise I can see through the fog  
Reason why they rob cause they got no job  
  
But I woke up in the morning, sexy, yawning  
Feel like it's gonna be a good day  
No war on the street, no way, today  
Everybody kick back like a holiday, aight  
You shine, I shine and  
The whole world looking like a gold mine  
You get yours and I'll get mine  
And we'll help each other make it through the bad times  
  
When they see me they ask me  
Will there ever be another Fugees  
I say I don't know but hope the trio  
Don't do like ? ? then ? on Sadaam though  
But on CNN they saw the same  
Little kids getting shot at close range  
To Babylon, we don't want no war  
I'm a send a message in a bottle to the White House, Lord  
These are the words from the master  
So don't you wait till the day after  
Until then you can catch me in the sixes  
Just pumping Bob Marley rebel music now  
  
But I woke up in the morning, sexy, yawning  
Feel like it's gonna be a good day  
No war on the street, no way, today  
Everybody kick back like a holiday, aight  
You shine, I shine and  
The whole world looking like a gold mine  
You get yours and I'll get mine  
And we'll help each other make it through the bad times  
  
Children, imagine a world with no racism  
No, no homeless in Grand Central Station  
Boys and girls going to schools with no tools  
Life is so beautiful but until then it will be  
Rebel music, rebel music  
Rebel music, put the peace sign up now  
Rebel music, all my gangs put the peace sign up now  
  
Uh, can these devils fool us son, not now ? done  
We're a generation of thugs, you can't play with us  
We've been lied to, enslaved and beaten up  
We're immune to what you call pain, it's nothing  
We're not scared of dying or afraid of guns  
Born in the USA, nah, can't blame us  
Our DNA's foreign to them  
We kings of the planet Earth, Gods if you will  
Yo, cash be my ?, it's about to get stupid  
These niggaz trying to stop our plans, peace to it  
I never meant to cause him pain and he knew it  
But he was trying to kill me and he blew it  
  
But I woke up in the morning, sexy, yawning  
Feel like it's gonna be a good day  
No war on the street, no way, today  
Everybody kick back like a holiday, aight  
You shine, I shine and  
The whole world looking like a gold mine  
You get yours and I'll get mine  
And we'll help each other make it through the bad times
