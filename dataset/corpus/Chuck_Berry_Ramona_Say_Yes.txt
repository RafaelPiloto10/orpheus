Ramona, Ramona, Ramona, where'd you get that dress ?  
The neckline's down south, the hemline's way out west  
All in favour of Ramona's style, say yes  
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes  
Oh, Ramona, dancing in her brand new dress  
Ramona, you know, Ramona, you can do the monkey best  
All in favour of Ramona's monkey, say yes  
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes  
Ramona started shaking in her brand new short tight dress  
The band keep blasting, but Ramona, she never rest  
All in favour of Ramona, keep hollering yes  
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes  
Ramona looking good in her brand new short tight dress  
Wow, Ramona, Ramona, how'd you learn that mess ?  
All in favour of Ramona, just say yes  
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
