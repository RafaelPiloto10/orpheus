What goes up, must come down  
What must rise, must fall  
And what goes on in your life  
Is writing on the wall  
  
If all things must fall  
Why build a miracle at all  
If all things must pass  
Even a miracle won't last  
  
What goes up, must come down  
What must stand alone?  
And what goes on, in your mind  
Is turning into stone  
  
If all things must fall  
Why build a miracle at all  
If all things must pass  
Even a pyramid won't last  
  
How can you be so sure?  
How do you know what the earth will endure?  
How can you be so sure?  
That the wonders you've made in you life  
  
Will be seen  
By the millions who'll follow to visit the site  
Of your dream?  
  
What goes up, must come down  
What goes round, must come round  
What's been lost, must be found
