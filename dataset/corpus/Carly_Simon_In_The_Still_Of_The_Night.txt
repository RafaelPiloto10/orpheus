In the still of the night  
As I gaze from my window  
At the moon in the sky  
My thoughts fly straight to you  
  
In the still of the night  
While the world is in slumber  
Oh, the times without number  
Darling, when I say to you  
  
Do you love me as I love you?  
Are you my life to be, my dream come true?  
Or will this dream of mine fade out of sight  
Like the moon growing dim on the rim of the hill  
In the chill, still of the night?  
  
In the still of the night  
As I gaze from my window  
  
In the still of the night  
While the world is in slumber  
Oh, the times without number  
Darling, when I say to you  
  
Do you love me as I love you?  
Are you my life to be, my dream come true?  
Or will this dream of mine fade out of sight  
Like the moon growing dim on the rim of the hill  
In the chill, still of the night?  
  
In the still of the night  
In the still of the night  
In the still of the night
