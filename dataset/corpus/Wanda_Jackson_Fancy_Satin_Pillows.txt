Fancy satin pillows that you bought  
For me to place beneath my head  
I must admit they're very nice  
But I would rather have your arms instead  
To have you here beside me just feel your warmth  
So very close is what I need  
More than all the fancy satin pillows  
You could ever buy for me  
Still I thank you for the fancy satin pillows  
I don't mean to be unkind  
But I can't use 'em both and I thought  
Sharing them was what you had in mind  
In the stillness of the night to have your arms  
Reach out and pull me close so tenderly  
Means more than all the fancy satin pillows  
You could ever buy for me  
Still I thank you for the fancy satin pillows  
I don't mean to be unkind  
But I can't use 'em both and I thought  
Sharing them was what you had in mind  
In the stillness of the night to have your arms  
Reach out and pull me close so tenderly  
Means more than all the fancy satin pillows  
You could ever buy for me  
Means more than all the fancy satin pillows  
You could ever buy for me
