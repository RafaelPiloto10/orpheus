Now everybody in this neighborhood  
All you women better listen good  
I know it's just a matter of time  
Till one of you steps out of line  
All I got is this to say  
Simple message to relay  
Get out of here and just keep away  
'cause this man is mine  
This man is mine  
This man, this man is mine  
  
I know the women round here  
Recognize something good  
Even try to take it if they could  
So I'm using every little trick I know  
Making sure that he won't go  
I put up all my resistance  
All you girls you better keep your distance  
We don't need no more of your assistance  
  
This man is mine  
This man is mine  
This man, this man is mine  
  
He got passion burning in his eyes  
Steaming up the night  
Always makes me realize  
What I done was right  
  
This man is mine  
This man is mine  
This man, this man is mine  
(Gonna love him  
Gonna teach him  
Gonna tell him  
Gonna reach him)
