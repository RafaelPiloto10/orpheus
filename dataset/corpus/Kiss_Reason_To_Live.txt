Out of love, there's nobody around, all I hear is the sound of a broken heart  
Out of time, no more waitin' for you  
Now the hurtin's through, and a new day starts  
And I feel a change in my life, I sailed into dark and endless nights  
And made it alive  
  
Everybody's got a reason to live, baby  
Everybody's got a dream and a hunger inside  
Everybody's got a reason to live, but it can't be your love  
  
Out of touch, with myself for so long, now a feelin' so strong comin' over me  
Down the line, there's a lesson I've learned  
You can love and get burned, if it has to be  
And I see a change in my life, and I'm not alone when I'm strong inside  
And I realize  
  
Everybody's got a reason to live, baby  
Everybody's got a dream and a hunger inside  
Everybody's got a reason to live, but it can't be your love  
  
And I feel a change in my life  
And I'm not alone when I'm strong inside and I realize  
  
Everybody's got a reason to live, baby  
Everybody's got a dream and a hunger inside  
Everybody's got a reason to live, but it can't be your love  
  
Everybody's got a reason to live, baby  
Everybody's got a dream and a hunger inside  
Everybody's got a reason to live, but it can't be your love  
  
No it can't be your love, no it can't be your love  
No it can't be your love
