I can hardly bear the sight of lipstick on the cigarettes there in the ashtray  
Lyin' cold the way you left 'em, but at least your lips caressed them while  
You packed  
Or the lip-print on a half-filled cup of coffee that you poured and didn't
drink  
But at least you thought you wanted it, that's so much more than I can say  
For me  
  
What a good year for the roses  
Many blooms still linger there  
The lawn could stand another mowin'  
Funny I don't even care  
As you turn to walk away  
As the door behind you closes  
The only thing I have to say  
It's been a good year for the roses  
  
After three full years of marriage, it's the first time that you haven't  
Made the bed  
I guess the reason we're not talkin', there's so little left to say we  
Haven't said  
While a million thoughts go racin' through my mind, I find I haven't said a
word  
From the bedroom the familiar sound of a baby's cryin' goes unheard  
  
What a good year for the roses  
Many blooms still linger there  
The lawn could stand another mowin'  
Funny I don't even care  
As you turn to walk away  
As the door behind you closes  
The only thing I have to say  
It's been a good year for the roses
