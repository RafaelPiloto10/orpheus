Irish blood English heart,  
This I'm made off,  
There is no one on earth I'm afraid of,  
And no regime can buy or sell me  
  
I've been dreaming of a time when,  
To be English is not to be baneful,  
To be standing by the flag, not feeling shameful,  
Racist or racial  
  
Irish blood English heart,  
This I'm made of,  
There is no one on earth I'm afraid of,  
And I will die with both of my hands untied  
  
I've been dreaming of a time when,  
The English are sick to death of Labor, and Tories,  
And spit upon the name Oliver Cromwell,  
And denounce this royal line that still salute him,  
And will salute him  
Forever...
