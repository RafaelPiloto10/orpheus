Say That You Love Me  
By: Regine Velasquez  
  
My morning starts to shine  
With teardrops in my eyes  
And here I am alone starting to realize  
That my days would be brighter  
If I could learn to hide  
The feeling that I have for you  
Keeps hurting me inside  
  
Then my days begin  
With simple thoughts of you  
Hoping that tomorrow will be me and you  
Sharing dreams with each other  
And making them come true  
Holding one another, saying all "I need is you"  
  
But will you say that you love me  
And show me that you care  
Say when I need you  
You will always be there  
But if you go and leave me  
This I swear is true  
My love will always be with you  
  
Now my nights would end  
With just one wish, that's you  
To hold me in the dark  
And help me make it through  
'Cause the pain that's inside me  
Would simply melt away  
If I had you here with me  
And promise me you'd stay  
  
But will you say that you love me  
And show me that you care  
Say when I need you  
You will always be there  
But if you go and leave me  
This I swear is true  
My love will always be with you  
Ooh, ooh, ooo  
  
Instrumental  
  
But will you  
But will you say that you love me  
And show me that you care  
Say when I need you  
You will always be there  
But if you go and leave me  
This I swear is true  
My love will always  
My love will always  
My love will always be with you  
  
My love will always be with you
