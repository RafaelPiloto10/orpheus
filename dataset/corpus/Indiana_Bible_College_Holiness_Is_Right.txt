Chorus  
There's a difference between wrong and right  
There's a difference between darkness and light  
There's no compromise  
We must draw the line  
Sin is still a reproach but holiness is right  
  
Verse 1  
Now the world is living all kinds of life styles  
But the life of a Christian should be pure and undefiled  
Everybody has faults to repent thereof  
And then walk in the light because holiness is right  
  
Verse 2  
God is God and He'll always be the same  
His Word is the law, not one title will ever change  
We must distinguish between the clean and unclean  
And then walk in the light because holiness is right  
  
Vamp 1  
We must be holy,  
Holy  
We must be holy,  
Holy  
For holiness is right  
  
Bridge  
To see the Lord there's no other way than  
  
Vamp 2  
Holiness (4x)  
  
Vamp 3  
Holiness (3x)  
Holiness is right  
  
Ending  
Holiness, Holiness  
To see the Lord there's no other way than Holiness
