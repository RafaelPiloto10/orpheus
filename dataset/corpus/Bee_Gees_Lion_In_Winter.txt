Lion in my winter.  
I'm a lion with no crown.  
  
You want to make me big man,  
A star on a screen,  
Some kind of James Brown,  
Or something in between.  
  
But when I look for money  
You smother me in charms.  
I can't live on glory  
When you're bending both my arms.  
  
I, I was a lion in winter.  
And, man, I had friends  
For miles around.  
I was a lion in my winter.  
What good's a lion, lord,  
Without a crown.  
  
You're living in a cave, man,  
Upon your marble throne.  
You think you own the heavens,  
But you've got to be alone.  
  
You know, you know I prayed for sunshine,  
A woman with my name.  
I don't want to live, man,  
You gave away the game.  
  
I, I was a lion in winter.  
And, man, I had friends  
For miles around.  
I was a lion in my winter.  
What good's a lion, lord,  
Without a crown.  
  
I was a lion in my winter.  
What good's a lion, lord,  
Without a crown.
