Thank you for informing me  
That I've been banned from Canada  
It comes as no surprise to me  
Since last week it was Africa  
Since you've been ambassador  
There's trouble at the border  
La la la la la la la Halfway 'round the world  
  
It's amusing still it makes me wince  
Your face is like a scimitar  
When accidentally eye to eye  
You shoot a look of vinegar  
What could I have done to you  
To make you act the way you do  
La la la la la la la Halfway 'round the world  
  
For whatever reason  
You would keep me  
Halfway 'round the world  
I believe it's like some kind of compliment  
I must be quite a girl  
Quite a girl  
La la la la la la la Halfway 'round the world  
  
Once upon a time you swore you'd love me  
'Til the end of the world  
Now, nowhere is far enough away for you  
I must be quite a girl  
Quite a girl  
La la la la la la la Halfway 'round the world
