All is fair in love,  
Love's a crazy game  
Two people vow to stay  
In love as one they say  
But all is changed with time  
The future none can see  
The road you leave behind  
Ahead lies mystery, but all is fair in love  
I have to go away  
A writer takes his pen to write the words again  
All in love is fair...  
All of fate's a chance  
It's either good or bad  
I tossed my coin to say, to say  
In love with me you'd stay  
But all in war is so cold  
You either win or lose  
When all is put away  
The losing side I'll play...  
All is fair in love  
I could have never left your side  
A writer takes his pen to write the words again  
That all in love is fair  
A writer takes his pen to write the words again...  
That all in love is fair...
