Your mother was crying  
Your father passed her a handkerchief  
Their tear-stained faces  
Looked to mine for a sign of grief  
A thousand raincoats  
Always stand around too long  
But I stayed to talk with you  
After they had gone.  
  
The flowers I brought you  
Were beginning to fade under the heavy rain  
Your name on the card had run  
So I tried in vain to write it again  
They didn't understand you, no!  
They didn't even try  
I'm so glad that you left us now  
Before you had the chance to die.  
  
I sat there for a long time,  
Expecting to turn and see you there  
I ran my fingers through the long grass  
Willing it to turn into your hair, and oh  
I'm gonna miss you, dear  
But I don't have to cry  
  
I'm so glad that you left us now,  
Before you had the chance to die  
And oh, I'm going to miss you dear,  
But I'm not going to cry  
I'm so glad that your life stopped now,  
Before it had the chance to die.
