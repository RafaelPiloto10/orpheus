I can't believe that it's real  
The way that you make me feel  
A burning deep down inside  
A love that I cannot hide  
  
I know it's you and me babe  
That makes the world go round  
Ah keeping you in love with me baby  
Laying all my troubles down  
  
Here I am babe, come and take me  
Here I am babe, won't ya come and take me  
Take me by the hand, ooh show me  
Here I am babe, oah  
  
It always ends up this way  
Me begging you every day  
A love that I cannot have  
You broke my heart in two halves  
  
Ooh I know it's you and me babe  
That makes the world go round  
Ah keeping you in love with me baby  
Laying all my troubles down  
  
Here I am babe, come and take me  
Here I am babe, won't ya come and take me  
Take me by the hand, ooh show me  
Here I am babe, oah  
  
Here I am babe, come and take me  
Here I am babe, won't ya come and take me  
Take me by the hand, ooh show me  
Here I am babe, oah
