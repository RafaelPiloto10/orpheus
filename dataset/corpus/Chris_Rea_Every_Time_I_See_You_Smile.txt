Sat out a card game in a motel room  
Don't let the muzak drive you crazy late at night  
They tell me it's all part of the deal I'm in  
Well I close my eyes, put memory into sight  
Every time I see you smile  
Now the lady tabs your case, leaves you thinking  
An hour or so: I hope she's right on time  
And you dream away your touchdown destination  
Now single file and put yourself back in line  
But oh, every time I see you smile  
Now this old world don't give much for choosing  
You can spend a lifetime driving yourself wild  
But I can take it's punches laughing - don't mind losing  
Just as long as I get to see you smile every once in a while
