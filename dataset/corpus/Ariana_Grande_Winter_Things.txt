[Verse 1]  
It ain't even cold outside, not where I'm from  
Feeling like it's mid-July under the sun  
My jacket don't get no love, no hats and no gloves, not even a chance to rain  
But my baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things  
  
[Chorus]  
Ayo, I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole  
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday  
Made just for me and my baby, ooh, ooh  
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things, hey  
  
[Verse 2]  
Take me to the ice-skating rink downtown (No, no, no, downtown)  
Even though it's 100 degrees, gotta get out  
Ain't no ice or no chills, no snowmen to build, most of our friends at the
beach  
But my baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things  
  
[Chorus]  
Ayo, I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole  
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday  
Made just for me and my baby, ooh, ooh  
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things, hey  
  
[Bridge]  
Just imagine that we're laughing  
In the cabin, chilling by the fireside  
Even though this sun is blasting  
We can be wherever if we visualize  
  
[Chorus]  
Ayo, I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole  
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday  
Made just for me and my baby, ooh, ooh  
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things, hey
