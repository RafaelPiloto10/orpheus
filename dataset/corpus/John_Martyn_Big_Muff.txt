Well, the man upstairs always lends an ear  
To the man downstairs even though he doesn't care  
The man up the spiral staircase, he? Love the sympathy?  
With the man downstairs and the same old face  
Big muff, can't you see I've had enough?  
God knows you're trying to kill me  
Big muff, get away with your powder puff  
Lord knows you're killing me  
It's like an allergy with no apology  
It's sapped my energy and now my? Integrity?  
Big muff, get away with your powder puff  
Lord knows you're killing me  
The lord knows you're stifling me  
The lord knows you're trying to kill me  
Well, the man upstairs has learned it from his wife  
But the man downstairs has got trouble in his life  
The man upstairs don't notice what has gone  
Every time he sees his neighbour singing that same old song  
Big muff, get away with your powder puff  
Lord knows you're trying to kill me  
Big muff, get away with your terrible stuff  
The lord knows you're killing me  
This thing is dangerous, I tell you it's serious  
No need to be envious, it's bigger than the both of us  
Big muff, can't you see I've had enough?  
Lord knows you're trying to kill me  
Well, the man downstairs has moved away for good  
Like the man upstairs, I always knew he would  
The man downstairs has moved and gone away  
And the girl upstairs every night can hear him say  
Big muff, get away with your powder puff  
Lord knows you're killing me  
Big muff, can't you see I've had enough?  
Lord knows you're stifling me  
It's like an allergy with no apology  
It's sapped my energy, ? Most catch...?  
God knows you're stifling me  
The lord knows you're stifling me  
The lord knows you're trying to kill me
