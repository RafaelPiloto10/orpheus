I keep getting attacked by  
The girl in the black hat  
The girl in the black hat.  
  
I can't find any shade but  
I'll be swayed as long as  
I got a switchblade.  
  
I keep getting the eye from  
The girl in the thigh highs  
The girl in the thing highs.  
  
With irises of jade are built  
To persuade and they're  
Swift like a switchblade.  
  
Switchblade, switchblade  
They're swift like a switchblade  
Switchblade  
  
Nobody wears it like you anymore  
Nobody wears it like you anymore  
  
Light like a feather  
Bright like a dying star.  
Cut those together  
Girl that is what you are.  
Wild eyes forever  
Built to punish and persuade.  
I like together  
But all I got was a switchblade.  
Switchblade  
  
So just gimme the facts  
Who's the girl in the black hat  
The girl in the black hat.  
  
I can't find any shade but  
I'll be swayed as long as  
I've got a switchblade.  
  
I think I'm getting a rise  
On all her American thighs  
Her American thighs.  
  
She got her black hat  
And irises of jade  
And I got a switchblade.  
Switchblade  
Yes I've got a switchblade  
  
Nobody wears it like you anymore  
Nobody wears it like you anymore  
  
Light like a feather  
Bright like a dying star.  
Cut those together  
Girl that is what you are.  
Wild eyes forever  
Built to punish and persuade.  
I like together  
But all I got was a switchblade.  
Switchblade  
  
Nobody wears it like you anymore  
Nobody wears it like you  
  
I keep getting attacked by  
The girl in the black hat  
The girl in the black hat.  
  
I can't find any shade but  
I'll be swayed as long as  
I got a switchblade.  
Switchblade  
  
Light like a feather  
Bright like a dying star.  
Cut those together  
Girl that is what you are.  
Wild eyes forever  
Built to punish and persuade.  
I like together  
But all I got was a switchblade.  
Yes I got a switchblade  
  
Light like a feather  
Bright like a dying star.  
Cut those together  
Girl that is what you are.  
Wild eyes forever  
Built to punish and persuade.
