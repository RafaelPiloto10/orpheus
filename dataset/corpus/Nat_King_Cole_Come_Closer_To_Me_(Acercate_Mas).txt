Come closer to me  
So I can see  
Heaven in your eyes  
  
Come closer to me  
So I can be  
Close to paradise  
  
Thrill me with your kisses  
Let me learn what bliss is  
Kiss me once and then  
We'll kiss and kiss again  
And life will be divine  
  
Come closer, my dear  
So I can hear  
Music in my heart  
  
I've waited so long  
To hear the song that  
Your love will start  
  
Darling, I'll adore you  
Live my life just for you  
All I ask is this  
Please give me one more kiss  
And whisper you'll be mine  
  
Acercate mas y mas y mas  
Pero mucho mas  
Y besame asi, asi, asi  
Como besas tu  
  
Pero besa pronto  
Porque estou sufriendo  
  
Kiss me once and then  
We'll kiss and kiss again  
And life will be divine  
  
Come closer, my dear  
So I can hear  
Music in my heart  
  
I've waited so long  
To hear the song that  
Your love will start  
  
Darling, I'll adore you  
Live my life just for you  
All I ask is this  
Please give me one more kiss  
And whisper you'll be mine
