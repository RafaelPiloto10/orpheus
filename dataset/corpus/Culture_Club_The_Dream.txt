Like Alice in Wonderland  
The dream takes you by the hand  
Inside emotions that you might not feel  
If by some notion the dream was not real  
The dream, the dream, the dream  
  
Watching the colors as they run  
Figures you mold like the sun  
Lovers can dream, devils can dream  
You may be nowhere until you have seen  
  
The dream, the dream, the dream whoa  
Oh what have I done?  
Close my eyes and I dream of some world  
It could be magic, it could be tragic  
  
Hee, dream  
The dream, the dream, the dream whoa
