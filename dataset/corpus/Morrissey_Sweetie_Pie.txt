Sweetie pie  
I've fallen in love.  
And the joke is on me.  
And the sun's given up.  
I'm depending on you,  
To see I get safely to  
The port where my heart  
Is too lost to find.  
And will be there to meet you when its your time.  
  
Sweetie pie  
I'm ending my life.  
Because I've fallen in love.  
And nothing is enough.  
To see I get safely to  
The port where my heart  
Is too lost to find.  
And will be there to meet you when its your time  
  
Sweetie pie.  
How I feel in my mind,  
And how I live in he world,  
They are oceans apart.  
To see I get safely to  
The port where my heart  
Is too lost to find.  
And will be there to meet you when its your time.
