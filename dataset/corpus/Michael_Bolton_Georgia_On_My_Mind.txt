Georgia, Georgia, whole day through  
Just an old sweet song  
Keeps Georgia on my mind  
  
Talking 'bout Georgia  
I'm in Georgia  
A song of you  
Comes as sweet and clear as moonlight  
Through the pines  
  
Other arms reach out to me  
Other eyes smile tenderly  
Still in peaceful dreams I see  
The road leads back to you  
  
Georgia, sweet Georgia, no peace I find  
Just an old sweet song  
Keeps Georgia on my mind  
Georgia on my mind  
  
Other arms reach out to me  
Other eyes smile tenderly  
Still in peaceful dreams I see  
The road leads back  
It always leads back, leads back to you  
  
I'm in Georgia, Georgia, sweet Georgia  
No peace, no peace I find  
Just this old sweet song  
Keeps Georgia forever on my mind  
Just an old sweet sweet sweet song  
Keeps Georgia forever on my mind
