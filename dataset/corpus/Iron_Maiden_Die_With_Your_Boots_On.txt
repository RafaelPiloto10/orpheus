Another prophet of disaster  
Who says the ship is lost  
Another prophet of disaster  
Leaving you to count the cost  
Taunting us with visions  
Afflicting us with fear  
Predicting war for millions  
In the hope that one appears  
  
No point asking when it is  
No point asking who's to go  
No point asking what's the game  
No point asking who's to blame  
'Cause if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die  
if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die  
if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,  
if you're gonna die  
  
If you're gonna die, die with your boots on  
If you're gonna try, well stick around  
Gonna cry, just move along  
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die  
  
In thirteen the beast is rising  
The Frenchman did surmise  
Through earthquakes and starvation  
The warlord will arise  
Terror, death, destruction  
Pour from the eastern sands  
But the truth of all predictions  
Is always in your hands  
  
No point asking when it is  
No point asking who's to go  
No point asking what's the game  
No point asking who's to blame  
'Cause if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die  
if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die  
if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,  
if you're gonna die  
  
If you're gonna die, die with your boots on  
If you're gonna try, just stick around  
Gonna cry, just move along  
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die
