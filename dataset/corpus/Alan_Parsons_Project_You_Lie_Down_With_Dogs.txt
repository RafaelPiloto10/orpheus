You're such a cool woman but I love you  
Such a cruel woman but I love you  
Open up your eyes and realize  
You're such a fool woman but I love you  
But give me all that you've got to give  
Cause it sure feels good to me  
I'm not your only man I'm just your lover  
Not your only man just another  
Open up your eyes and realize  
I'm gonna take what I can like any other  
I'll say any damned thing that you want me to  
Cause it don't mean a thing to me  
Well  
You lie down with dogs you fall in with thieves  
You're gonna catch something but you do as you please  
You're scratchin' an itch that nothing can ease  
You lie down with dogs you get up with fleas  
Get out and find yourself another lover  
Why don't you find yourself another lover  
Open up your eyes and realize  
You don't mean nothing to me I'm not your mother  
You gave me all that you had to give  
But there's a whole lotta fish in the sea  
Well  
You lie down with dogs you fall in with thieves  
You're gonna catch something but you do as you please  
You're scratchin' an itch that nothing can ease  
You lie down with dogs you get up with fleas  
You lie down with dogs you fall in with thieves  
You're gonna catch something but you do as you please  
You're gonna catch something but you do as you please  
You're scratchin' an itch that nothing can ease  
Ooo, you fall and you fall and you fall and you fall  
You lie down with dogs you get up with fleas
