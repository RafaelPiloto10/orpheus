(Great hits of the sixties)  
Look the lady's got a photograph  
Silver framed and velvet backed  
Well, she took it quite a while ago  
Funny that she never let me know  
What does it matter to me  
If it doesn't show  
I just don't know  
It's only just a memory  
Just a little history  
Oh, oh, oh  
And now she's wearing satin shoes  
Gilded hair to pay the dues  
I guess that I should tip my hat  
I wonder if she'd think of looking back  
What does it matter to me  
If it doesn't show  
I just don't know  
It's only just a memory  
Just a little history  
Oh, oh  
In the parking lot late at night  
Paper straws never worked out right  
I knew I wanted to  
But didn't know why  
So I just said "Hi"  
(Everybody sing along now)
