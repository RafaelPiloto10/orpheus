Ten years ago on a cold dark night  
Someone was killed beneath the townhall light  
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed  
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me  
She walks these hills in a long black veil  
She visits my grave when the night winds wail  
Nobody knows, nobody sees, nobody knows but me  
  
The judge said "son, what is your aliby?  
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die."  
I said not a word, though it meant my life,  
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife.  
Oh, she walks these hills in a long black veil.  
She visits my grave when the night winds wail.  
Nobody knows, nobody sees, nobody knows but me.  
  
Oh, now the scaffold is high, eternity is near  
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear  
And sometimes at night when the cold winds blow  
In a long black veil she cries over my bones.  
She walks these hills in a long black veil  
She visits my grave when the night winds wail  
Nobody knows, nobody sees, nobody knows but me.  
  
Oh, she walks these hills in a long black veil  
She visits my grave when the night winds wail  
Nobody knows, nobody sees, nobody knows but me.  
  
Nobody knows. nobody knows, but me.  
Nobody knows but me.
