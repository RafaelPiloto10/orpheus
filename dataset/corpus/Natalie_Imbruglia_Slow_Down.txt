You got it the wrong way 'round completely  
The fact that I love you so  
Doesn't make me a fool  
One day you just might grow tired of chasing  
The end of a rainbow  
You're already there you know  
  
So slow down  
Tell me why you're running  
And turn around  
Let it out and keep it coming  
Nothing I can do  
If I can't get to you  
Slow down  
  
Remember the day you came to see me  
Even that lonely long drive  
Couldn't keep us apart  
And you opened up to me completely  
And you gave me piece of mind  
The rest we can leave behind  
  
So slow down  
Tell me why you're running  
And turn around  
Let it out and keep it coming  
Nothing I can do  
If I can't get to you  
Slow down  
  
You don't have to hurt yourself  
And feel so small  
It's so confusing  
And you're already there  
  
So slow down  
Tell me why you're running  
And turn around  
Let it out and keep it coming  
Nothing I can do  
If I can't get to you  
Slow down  
  
So slow down  
Tell me why you're running  
And turn around  
Let it out and keep it coming  
Nothing I can do  
If I can't get to you  
Slow down  
  
Slow down
