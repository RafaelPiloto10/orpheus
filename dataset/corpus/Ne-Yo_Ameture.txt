(Verse)  
Hey, beating yourself up  
Tryna figure up how you wound up out in the cold  
Not only did you lose me, but the one that you was  
Cheatin' on me also left ya alone, no, I can't speak for her  
But that be mean(?) you had my mind and was clockin' my soul  
But it fell apart cuz you couldn't recall first lie that you told  
  
(Chorus)  
Listen, baby, if you're gonna be a liar  
At least try to be good at it  
If you're gonna be a cheater  
Our deal is not to be caught  
Got her on the roots(?)  
Or don't even play the game  
Cuz you got me so high  
Don't know what you doin'  
Such an ameture  
  
(Verse 2)  
Beating myself up  
Tryna figure out how you fooled me as long as you did  
Mad at myself, so anxious for love that I wasn't payin' attention  
But you got the best of me, gave you the best, best believe  
Never again, said I'm way to smart, so believe me, baby, never again  
  
(Chorus)  
Listen, baby, if you're gonna be a liar  
At least try to be good at it  
If you're gonna be a cheater  
Our deal is not to be caught  
Got her on the roots(?)  
Or don't even play the game  
Cuz you got me so high  
Don't know what you doin'  
Such an ameture  
  
(Bridge)  
Smokin' mills(?), deception  
Pillow saltin' tears, rejection  
Your hopes and tears connect  
When our heart is treated with no care or discretion  
Ladies, what you fear is protection  
From fellas that don't know about affection  
But I'd try some love and affection  
Only Mr. Smith and Weston(?)  
  
(Chorus)  
Baby, if you're gonna be a liar  
At least try to be good at it  
If you're gonna be a cheater  
Our deal is not to be caught  
Got her on the roots(?)  
Or don't even play the game  
Cuz you got me so high  
Don't know what you doin'  
Such an ameture
