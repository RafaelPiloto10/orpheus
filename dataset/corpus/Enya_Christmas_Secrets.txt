Underneath a winter sky,  
A distant train sings out the miles.  
And so I wonder can it be,  
Will every mile bring you to me?  
  
A promise made may still come true,  
So I am waiting here for you.  
If you don't come, what will I do?  
Who shall I tell my secrets to?  
  
Christmas bells ring out their chimes,  
I hear them echo through the night.  
And moonlight shines upon the road,  
And trembles on the falling snow.  
  
I look into the midnight blue,  
So many stars I never knew.  
If you don't come, what will I do?  
Who shall I tell my secrets to?  
  
I look into the midnight blue,  
So many stars I never knew.  
If you don't come, what will I do?  
Who shall I tell my secrets to?
