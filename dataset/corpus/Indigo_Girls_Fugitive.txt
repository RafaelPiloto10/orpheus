I'm harboring a fugitive  
Defector of a kind  
And she lives in my soul  
Drinks of my wine  
And I'd give my last breath  
To keep us alive  
  
Are they coming for us  
With cameras or guns  
We don't know which  
But we gotta run  
And you say this is not  
What I bargained for  
  
So hide yourself for me  
All for me  
  
We swore to ourselves  
We'd go to the end of the world  
But I got caught up in the whirl  
And the twirl of it all  
A day in the sun  
Dancing alone  
Baby I'm so sorry  
  
Now it's coming to you  
The lessons I've learned  
Won't do you any good  
You've got to get burned  
Well the curse and the blessing  
They're one in the same  
Baby it's all  
Such a treacherous gain  
  
Hide yourself for me  
I said hide yourself for me  
All for me  
  
I stood without clothes  
Danced in the sand  
I was aching with freedom  
And kissing the damned  
I said remember this  
As how it should be  
  
Oh baby I said  
It's all in our hands  
Got to learn to respect  
What we don't understand  
We are fortunate ones  
Fortunate ones  
I swear  
  
Hide yourself for me  
I will hide myself for you  
All for you  
(I will hide)  
All for you  
(Myself for you)  
I will hide myself for you  
All for you  
  
I stood without clothes  
I danced in the sand  
I was aching with freedom  
Kissing the damned  
I said remember this  
Is how it should be
