My baby's got a heart of stone  
Can't you people just leave her alone  
She never did nothing to hurt you  
So just leave her alone  
  
The motion of her tiny hands  
And the quiver of her bones below  
Are the signs of a girl alone  
And tell you everything  
You need to know  
  
I can't explain it  
I feel it often  
Every time I see her face  
But the way you treat her  
Fills me with rage and I  
Want to tear apart the place  
  
You try to tell her what to do  
And all she does is stare at you  
Her stare is louder than your voice  
Because truth doesn't make a noise
