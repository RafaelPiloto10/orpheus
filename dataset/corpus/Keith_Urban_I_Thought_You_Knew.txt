I thought You knew, guess I assumed to much  
I don't know how, but now where so far out of touch  
And I never planned, to so miss understand  
But what you needed, you never asked me to give  
And I swear as I live  
  
I thought you knew my heart was yours  
And that we were so together  
That we, would always be  
I don't believe, you leavin' me is the answer  
  
I'm not askin' you to let me rush back in and fail again  
I'm askin' for one chance, not to assume  
So I can say and do all the things I thought you knew  
  
So far where still so far  
From where we know we should be  
I'm searching for words  
And you haven't heard  
  
I thought you knew my heart was yours  
And that we were so together  
That we, would always be  
I don't believe, you leavin' me is the answer  
  
I'm not askin' you to let me rush back in and fail again  
I'm askin' for one chance, not to assume  
So I can say and do all the things I thought you knew  
  
I thought you knew  
  
Oh god I thought you knew!
