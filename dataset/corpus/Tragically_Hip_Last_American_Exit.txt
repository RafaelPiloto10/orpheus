You know the reasons I can't conceal you kow I'm leaving you  
Obviously you know how I feel you know I'm tired of crawling  
'hind my name among the crowd  
  
It's not a matter for wrong or right  
It ain't much better than drinking  
And looking to fight it's not as easy as calling out your  
Name when ism down  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm on the last american exit to the north land  
I'm on the last american exit to my homeland  
I'm on the last american exit to my  
Last chance the keep calling out my name, I shout it down  
  
You've made them wonder and know for sure  
You've made them hunger at night and then run for the door you know you'll  
Probably cry like Caesar's son when you're found  
  
It's not your face it's another town let's face it baby  
I'm up and then baby I'm down you'll watch the border offer you fame and  
Watch you drown  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Know your neighbors and know they'll take us  
Know my city it's just like theirs are hope I make it I know I'm gonna make it  
Somehow know my savior he knows you shakers  
Know my pity I'll see you later I'd like to stay but I know it doesn't matter  
Somehow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They keep callin' out my name they keep callin' out my name  
They keep callin' out my name I shout it down
