[1st verse:]  
Just like a melody that lingers on  
You seem to haunt me night and day  
I never realized till you had gone  
How much I cared about you  
I can't live without you  
[Refrain:]  
All alone  
I'm so all alone  
There is no one else but you  
All alone  
By the telephone  
Waiting for a ring  
A ting-a-ling  
I'm all alone every evening  
All alone feeling blue  
Wondering where you are  
And how you are  
And if you are  
All alone too  
[2nd verse:]  
Just for a moment you were mine, and then  
You seemed to vanish like a dream  
I long to hold you in my arms again  
My life is very lonely  
For I want you only
