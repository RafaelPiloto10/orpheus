Every day and every night, I'm lonesome  
The one I thought I'd never find, I lost somehow  
We had a dream  
In which our love could never die  
  
A messy place an empty mind, stii feel you  
An unmade bed a glass of wine, I'm used to  
I'll find a reason, a new meaning to hold on to  
But till I know I want to spend my time with you...  
  
Thinking about you in the morning  
I am thinking about you in the night  
I am thinking of the tears and the laughter  
And all the time we used to fool around  
I am missing all the crazy days with you and I  
  
Our favourite songs and tv-shows remind me  
Baby talk, internal jokes, sweet memories  
We had a dream  
In which our love would last forever  
We had a dream  
But God has changed our destiny  
  
I'm spending days just staring at the ceiling  
My tears they fall no matter what I'm feeling  
I'll find a reason a new meaning to hold on to  
But till I know I want to spend my time with you  
  
Thinking...  
  
I'm missing all the crazy days, with you and I  
I'm missing and the lovely days, with you and I  
I wanna spend my time with you  
As long as I can do  
Till I find a meaning to  
Hold on to...
