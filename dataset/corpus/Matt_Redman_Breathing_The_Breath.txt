We have nothing to give  
That didn't first come from Your hands  
We have nothing to offer You  
Which You did not provide  
Every good, perfect gift comes from  
Your kind and gracious heart  
And all we do is give back to You  
What always has been Yours  
Lord, we're breathing the breath  
That You gave us to breathe  
To worship You, to worship You  
And we're singing these songs  
With the very same breath  
To worship You, to worship You  
Who has given to You  
That it should be paid back to him?  
Who has given to You  
As if You needed anything?  
From You, and to You, and through You  
Come all things, O Lord  
And all we do is give back to You  
What always has been Yours  
We are breathing the breath  
That You gave us to breathe
