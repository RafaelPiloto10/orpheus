When I hold you in my arms  
It's a breath of fresh air,  
When I hold you in my arms  
I forget what's out there,  
All those people with their faces  
Walkin' up the street,  
They don't have to say a thing  
Just look around and you see.  
  
New buildings going up,  
Old buildings coming down,  
New signs going up,  
Old signs coming down,  
You gotta hold onto something in this life.  
  
Well the older generation  
They got something to say,  
But they better say it fast  
Or get outta the way.  
All those gangsters with their crimes  
They make it look so good,  
We've been blowing up the planet  
Just like the old neighbourhood.  
  
New buildings going up,  
Old buildings coming down,  
New signs going up,  
Old signs coming down,  
You gotta hold onto something in this life.  
  
If I only had a heart  
It would beat all night for you,  
If I only had a heart  
I would cry the whole day through,  
When I hold you in my arms  
It's like a breath of fresh air,  
When I hold you in my arms  
I forget what's out there.  
  
Old heart's going up,  
Old heart's coming down,  
My feelings going up,  
My feelings coming down,  
You gotta hold onto someone in this life.  
  
When I hold you in my arms  
It's a breath of fresh air.  
When I hold you in my arms  
I forget what's out there.
