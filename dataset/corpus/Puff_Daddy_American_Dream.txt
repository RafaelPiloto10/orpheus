[P. Diddy]  
This is not America  
Bad Boy baby, David Bowie, let's go  
  
[Chorus: David Bowie]  
This is not America  
This is not America  
This is not America  
This is not America  
  
[P. Diddy]  
Land where my father died, land where my children cried  
Come on, America, ain't no barriers  
Free the strings, let's see how freedom rings  
One nation all gettin' down for the dollars  
And the heat is gettin' hotter  
But a lot don't understand  
Just the way some plan to break you  
I done seen the whole thing go straight through  
Hungry for it, I'ma make you  
Pay back what's due to me  
Everybody gonna see, look what they put upon me  
Made me a monster, two steps beyond ya  
More streets to wonder  
For which it stands for cause let's get it  
Cause I'ma get mine for damn sure, come on  
  
[Loon]  
Screens, greens car candy painted  
Chicks in cream is the American dream, ain't it?  
I pledge allegiance to Beamers, dark skies  
Sleepless nights on the block, two for fives  
Deep in the struggles but need the hustle  
Weed and blow shit I make the block bubble  
I'm to the point where I'm playa hatin'  
Fool in the stash and I'm losin' my patience  
Medieval times in the chest of the beast  
Come around sniffin' I'ma mess up ya fleece  
Job lookin' I'd rather be pot cookin'  
It's not America, son this is Brooklyn  
Home of the shiesty, home of the crook  
We signed joints, ain't scared to do a took  
My country tis of thee, where there's no liberty  
Just misery, ya heard me  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Kain]  
Now why can't I breathe with a gun and come free  
If six dead people run this country  
Now they come cause my crew's too large  
Who the fuck put chu' in charge  
Runnin' around here like you is God  
Then they wonder why the shootin' starts  
Gettin' checks with half my stacks  
I forgot George Bush wrote half my raps  
Murderin' people for blastin' facts  
Then blamin' other cats for their tragic acts  
I'm tryin' to get paid till my eyes is closin'  
Cops is like freeze and I'm already frozen  
So they clap and they brawl in hysteria  
Tappin' Jackson callin' this area  
Green gots cats crawlin' to bury ya  
Don't blame Kain for the fall of America  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Mark Curry]  
Uh, yo what about these streets here  
Before y'all creep here  
Look around we there  
365 days a year  
Lines to cross no fear  
And what appears to be roses  
See I'm knowin' this  
When I chose this  
What's right  
In broad day or night  
More dope deals  
I'm tryin' to stay on my heels  
Every day's training day  
Some things not in explainin' ways  
Who said crimes don't pay  
Choices to make  
Ain't too many chances left to take  
Things look so green  
The sign of the times corruption politics, youg ones dyin'  
What you made of  
Either hate or love  
Pressure on the nine when push come to shove  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[David Bowie]  
A little piece of you (I'm ya worst nightmare)  
A little peace in me  
A little piece of you (This is not America)  
A little peace in me  
Will go  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Black Rob]  
Yo, why you cocksuckers pullin' me over  
Racial profilin' me cause I ain't pushin' no Nova  
I'm up to par lookin'  
I know police corruption is up this year and y'all crooked  
Took my hard white  
Had niggas sellin' the same block, pumpin' the same night  
Arrest me, come to court and lie  
Yeah that's him, pointin' like I'm the guy  
What chu' want those is me of the block  
Yo, so you can serve fiends everytime they knock  
Just last summer had the mad Hummer  
They took that and didn't even give me they badge number  
So how am I supposed to feel  
Who I'm supposed to call when the shit gets real  
Word man I'd rather dial 8-1-1 when it's important  
Plus they ain't tryin' to score like Ed Norton, word  
  
[Chorus to fade]
