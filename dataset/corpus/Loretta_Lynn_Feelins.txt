Feelins' just lead us on till we know where we're goin' mhmm  
If I told you that I loved you could we slip away where the lights're low  
And if I put my arms around you and held you close could you tell me no  
Well you know that I'd be lyin' if I said I was a tryin' to let you know I'd
go  
Yes love take me where we've never been before  
Feelins' just lead us on till we know where we're goin' mhmm  
You don't know how long I wanted to have you where you are right now  
With you looking soft and pretty ain't no telling where we've found  
Now here we are together too close with talkin' I can't tell you no  
Yes love take us where we've never been before  
Feelins' just lead us on till we know where we're goin' mhmm  
Feelins' mhmm feelins'
