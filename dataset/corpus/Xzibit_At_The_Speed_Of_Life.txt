Listen you fuckers, you screwheads  
Here's a man who won't take it anymore  
A man who stood up against  
The skunk, the kunts, the dogs, the fill, the shit  
Here is some one who stood up  
Here is...  
  
Yeah! this is it for anybody usin bodies  
presents, Xzibit movin at the speed of life  
Yeah! check it  
  
Verse One:  
  
It took a long time comin but we waited  
Xzibit went from underated  
To now most antcipaded  
never would of thought that I would rock your set  
And get love and respect without no special effects  
Only the rugged ruff shit that the hard rock need  
Lyrics must contain more then just clothes bitches and weed  
thinkin' how you like to see the next man bleed  
Tryin to glority greed  
Livin life at ridiculuos speed-indeed!  
The main goal to achieve, is to succeed  
Have it laid out for your seed  
But the world gets colder every day by day  
Physically, mentally gettin drained by L.A.  
Trying to find piece of mind  
is like trying to find a gold mine  
it just won't happen  
no time for relaxin  
Real soldiers of fortune  
the front line of the action  
So never show a nigga what you packin'  
"You know what i'm sayin'?"  
It's too much weight to be juggling  
who do you picture when you think about struggling  
Kids in the bed, no food stomach bubbilin  
Niggas in the E-class heavy drug smugglin  
  
Chorus:  
  
Movin...yeah!  
yes movin...  
At the speed of life  
  
Verse Two:  
  
And plus I feel that no style is darker than mine  
There was a time it was all about beats and rhymes  
But nowadays the blind just follow the blind  
and when I die!  
Niggas still recite these lines  
to rock the heads, waterbeds citys and towns  
Bringin strength to the masses that be holdin it down  
the underground! to upper echelon and beyond  
Xzibit rock and roll the streets like a vagabond  
Nigga want to trip you gettin dissed like a blond bitch  
mackin to Farrakhan, I run game like a marathon  
It's here today then tomorrow it's gone  
It's the law of the land  
a straight modern day babylon!  
  
Chorus:  
  
Movin...yeah! yeah! like this  
Like this...at the speed of life  
Ah! Bring it live, yeah!  
  
Verse Three:  
  
Xzibit lookin at the earth through wide angles  
I found a stairway to heaven in a city of lost angels  
Where small situations turn to altercation  
with a heavy ass price  
'cause niggas don't fight no more!  
before hip hop was all about drama  
anything for a dollar before Kane fucked Madona  
Xzibit maintain and stayed bent like a comma  
Just me and my bottle  
we shall lead not follow  
Emcees be full of shit  
but they style be hollow  
it seems you've bitin off more  
than you can possibly swallow  
just a day in the life of a man named X  
only blunt and latex for the oppisite sex  
you see niggas comin through to smoke and pay respect  
ever since fifteen, I been ready for anything  
whatever they bring in any shape, form or fashion  
I live to the fullest and rip rhyme with a passion  
but in the mean while if worse comes to worst  
bust a round or bust a verse whatever comes first  
Yeah! we got it locked down tight  
Xzibit bring truth to the light  
shit is movin at the speed of life  
  
Chorus:  
  
Movin...  
At the speed of life
