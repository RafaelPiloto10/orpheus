How strong a will  
How long to kill  
The Vampire's out to play  
He's going for his prey  
How wise the decisions  
How clear of a mind with perfect precision  
The aim it will find  
Removing a tyrant  
The vampire on it's track  
The shot in the dark  
The vampire strikes back  
Removing a tyrant  
The vampire on it's track  
The shot in the dark  
The vampire strikes back  
How sweet can it taste?  
How good can you feel?  
The enemy is dead  
Your victory is real  
How deep can you fall?  
How low can you feel?  
How sweet can it be?  
To know it is real?  
Removing a tyrant  
The vampire on it's track  
The shot in the dark  
The vampire strikes back  
Removing a tyrant  
The vampire has struck  
The shot in the dark  
The vampire strikes back  
Removing a tyrant  
The vampire on it's track  
The shot in the dark  
The vampire strikes back  
Removing a tyrant  
The vampire on it's track  
The shot in the dark  
The vampire strikes back
