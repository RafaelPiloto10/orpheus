You think we look pretty good together  
You think my shoes are made of leather  
  
But I'm a substitute for another guy  
I look pretty tall but my heels are high  
The simple things you see are all complicated  
I look pretty young, but I'm just back-dated, Yeah  
  
Substitute your lies for fact  
(Substitute) I can see right through your plastic mac  
(Substitute) I look all white, but my dad was black  
(Substitute) my fine looking suit is really made out of sack  
  
I was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth  
The north side of my town faced east, and the east faces south  
  
And now you dare to look me in the eye  
Those crocodile tears are what you cry  
It's a genuine problem that you won't try  
To work it out at all you just pass it by, pass it by  
  
Substitute me for him  
(Substitute) my coke for gin  
(Substitute) you for my mum  
(Substitute) at least I'll get my washing done
