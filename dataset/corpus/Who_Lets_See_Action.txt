Let's see action  
Let's see people  
Let's see freedom  
Let's see who cares  
  
Take me with you when you leave me  
And my shell behind us there  
I have learned it known who burned me  
Avatar has warmed his feet  
  
Take me with you  
When you leave me  
Time and life can meet  
  
Rumor has it minds are open  
Then rumors fill them up with lies  
Please the people, audiences  
I try to scream, 'cause nothing dies  
  
Let's see action  
Let's see people  
Let's see freedom  
In the air

In the air

Let's see people  
Let's be free  
Let's see who cares  
  
Give me a drink boy, wash my feet  
I'm so tired of running from my own heat  
Take this package and here's what you do  
You gonna get this information through  
  
I don't know where I'm going  
I don't know what I need  
But I'll get to where I'm gonna end up  
And that's alright by me  
  
I've been running from side to side  
Now I know for sure that both sides lied  
It's got so hard but we gotta keep trying  
I can't stand to see my people crying  
  
I don't know where I'm going  
I don't know what I need  
I'm gonna get to where I'm gonna end up  
And that's alright by me  
  
Let's see action  
Let's see people  
Let's see freedom  
In the air  
  
Let's see action  
Let's see people  
Let's be free  
And see who cares

Nothing is everything  
Everything is nothing is  
Please the people, audiences  
Break the fences, nothing is
