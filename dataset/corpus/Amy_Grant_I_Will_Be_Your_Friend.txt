When every moment gets too hard  
End of the road can feel so far  
No matter how much time we're apart  
I'm always near you  
  
I'll be the shelter in your rain  
Help you to find your smile again  
I'll make you laugh at a broken heart  
Wherever you are  
  
Cause I'm never gonna walk away  
If the walls come down someday  
All alone and you feel afraid  
I'll be there when you call my name  
You can always depend on me  
I believe until forever ends  
I will be your friend  
Yeah  
I will be your friend  
  
So many people come and go  
Nothing can change the you I know  
You'll never be just a face in the crowd  
And time will show  
  
Through the seasons and the years (and the years)  
I will always hold you dear  
Never you fear  
  
I'm never gonna walk away  
If the walls come down someday  
All alone and you feel afraid  
I'll be there when you call my name  
You can always depend on me  
I believe until forever ends  
I will be your friend  
  
Cause I'm never gonna walk away  
If the walls come down someday  
All alone and you feel afraid  
I'll be there when you call my name  
You can always depend on me  
I believe until forever ends  
I will be your friend  
  
I'll be your rock when every candle burns down low  
And I want you, and I want you to know  
  
I'm never gonna walk away  
If the walls come down someday  
All alone and you feel afraid  
I'll be there when you call my name  
You can always depend on me  
I believe until forever ends  
I will be your friend  
  
'Cause I'm never gonna walk away  
If the walls come down someday  
All alone and you feel afraid  
I'll be there when you call my name  
You can always depend on me  
I believe until forever ends  
I will be your friend  
  
I will be your friend  
I will be your friend
