Lovely little lady  
You got me on the run  
You're a love machine  
And you say that I'm your gun  
  
But I don't care  
'Cause I've got to know  
  
She said she were a loser  
The kind that came off worse  
So I had to try hard  
To satisfy your thirst  
  
But I don't care  
'Cause I've got to know  
  
The only time she's happy  
Is when the bullets fly  
And she'll make you  
Feel you're better  
Than any other guy  
  
And I don't care  
'Cause I've got to know  
  
Lovely little lady  
You got me on the run  
You're a love machine  
And I'm trying to be your gun  
  
And I don't care  
'Cause I've got to know
