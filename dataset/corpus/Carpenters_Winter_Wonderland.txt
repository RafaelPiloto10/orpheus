Sleigh bells ring  
  
Are you listening  
  
In the lane  
  
Snow is glistening  
  
A beautiful sight  
  
We're happy tonight  
  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
  
  
Gone away is the blue bird  
  
Here to stay is a new bird  
  
He songs a love song  
  
As we go along  
  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
  
And pretend that he is Parson Brown  
  
He'll say are you married?  
  
We'll say no man  
  
But you can do the job  
  
While you're in town  
  
  
  
Later on we'll conspire  
  
As we dream by the fire  
  
To face unafraid  
  
The plans that we made  
  
Walking in a winter wonderland
