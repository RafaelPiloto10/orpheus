I didn't know what day it was that day,  
Felt just like falling down on my knees to pray.  
Looked at myself, and all that I could say  
Was,"I think I see the errors of my way".  
  
There in the glass there was something caught my eye,  
Although I try through my sighing not to cry.  
See where I am, and what I try to say,  
Just so I'll look at the errors of my way.  
  
Guess I got no one around to pull me through.  
I just need someone to turn to, yes, I do.  
Doin' my best just to change my yesterday,  
Then I won't have no more errors of my way.
