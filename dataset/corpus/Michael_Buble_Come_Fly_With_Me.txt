Come fly with me, let's fly let's fly away  
If you can use some exotic booze  
There's a bar in far Bombay  
Come fly with me, let's fly let's fly away  
  
Come fly with me, let's float down to Peru  
In lama land, there's a one man band  
And he'll toot his flute for you  
Come fly with me, let's take off in the blue  
  
Once I get you up there,  
Where the air is rarefied  
We'll just glide  
Starry eyed  
Once I get you up there  
I'll be holding you so near  
You may hear the angels cheer  
Just because we're together  
  
Weather wise it's such a lovely day  
Just say the words, and we'll beat the birds  
Down to Acapulco bay  
It's perfect, for a flying honeymoon, they say  
Come fly with me  
Let's fly, let's fly away  
  
Once I get you up there,  
Where the air is rarefied  
We'll just glide  
Starry eyed  
Once I get you up there  
I'll be holding you so near  
You may hear all the angels cheer  
Just because we're together  
  
Weather wise it's such a lovely day  
You just say the words, and I'll beat the birds  
Down to Acapulco bay  
It's perfect, for a flying honeymoon, they say  
Come fly with me  
Let's fly, let's fly away  
Pack up let's fly away
