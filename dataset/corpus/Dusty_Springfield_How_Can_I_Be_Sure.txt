How can I be sure?  
In a world that's constantly changing  
How can I be sure?  
Where I stand with you  
  
Whenever i  
Whenever I am away from you  
I wanna die  
'cause you know I wanna stay with you  
  
How do I know?  
Maybe you're trying to use me  
Flying too high can confuse me  
Touch me, but don't take me down  
  
Whenever i  
Whenever I am away from you  
My alibi is telling people  
I don't care for you  
  
Maybe I'm just hanging round  
With my head up, upside down  
It's a pity for you  
I can't seem to find somebody new that's as  
Wonderful baby as you  
  
How can I be sure?  
I really, really, really, wanna know  
Really, really, wanna know , yeah  
  
Also whether  
Whether or not we're together  
Together will seem that much better  
I love you, I love you forever  
You know where I can be found  
  
How can I be sure?  
In a world that's constantly changing  
How can I be sure  
I'll be sure with you?
