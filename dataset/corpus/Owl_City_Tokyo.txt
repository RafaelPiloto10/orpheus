Feels like I've been away for a thousand years  
So tired of these airports and souvenirs  
I shiver in the night and I think of you  
  
I stroll the boulevards  
I stare up at the stars  
And wish they all aligned  
You keep me on my toes  
And this is how it goes  
You never leave my mind  
  
Are you having fun yet  
I'll send you the sunset  
I love the most when I'm in Tokyo  
I'll melt in the moonlight  
and follow the shoreline  
On down the coast, when I'm in Tokyo  
Oh, can't sleep the whole night through  
Oh,and I'm missing you  
  
I'm thinking it out loud  
I wish I could reach out  
And hold you close, when I'm in Tokyo  
  
I wander all alone in the pouring rain  
Line-shocking on the wind, in the bullet train  
I shiver in the night and I think of you  
  
I stroll the boulevards  
I stare up at the stars  
And wish they all aligned  
You keep me on my toes  
And this is how it goes  
You never leave my mind  
  
Are you having fun yet  
I'll send you the sunset  
I love the most when I'm in Tokyo  
I'll melt in the moonlight  
and follow the shoreline  
On down the coast, when I'm in Tokyo  
Oh, can't sleep the whole night through  
Oh, I'm missing you  
  
I'm thinking it out loud  
I wish I could reach out  
And hold you close, when I'm in Tokyo  
I stroll the boulevards  
I stare up at the stars  
And wish they all aligned  
You keep me on my toes  
And this is how it goes  
You never leave my mind  
  
Are you having fun yet  
I'll send you the sunset  
I love the most  
I'll melt in the moonlight  
and follow the shoreline  
On down the coast  
Oh, can't sleep the whole night through  
Oh, I'm missing you  
  
I'm thinking it out loud  
I wish I could reach out  
  
And hold you close when I'm in Tokyo  
When I'm in Tokyo, (when I'm in Tokyo)  
When I'm in Tokyo, (when I'm in Tokyo)  
When I'm in Tokyo, (when I'm in Tokyo)  
When I'm in Tokyo, (when I'm in Tokyo)
