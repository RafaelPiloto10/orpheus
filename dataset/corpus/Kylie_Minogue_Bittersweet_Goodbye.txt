Here we are in the dead of night  
Will you keep me warm and hold me tight  
  
All we have is until the dawn  
Let the night be long and ease the dawn  
  
I love you more than you'll ever know  
It hurts to see you go  
  
So darling sing me a lullaby  
Uh bittersweet goodbye  
  
Don't think about the future now  
These few hours  
Let the nighttime envelop us  
Take us under  
Bewitching spell, bewitching spell  
  
Here we are in the dead of night  
Won't see you past the morning light  
  
So Darling sing me a lullaby  
Bittersweet goodbye  
  
Remember me when you're away
