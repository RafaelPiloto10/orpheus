You wake up in the middle of  
The thunder of a scream  
And you realise that it was yours  
You don't know what to tell them  
'Cause you don't know where you've been  
And you've been late so many times before  
  
It's only natural to feel like you're sinking  
It's only human to be so unprepared  
  
Don't worry baby  
If you get a little high  
It's just a phase to get you through  
Getting by  
So you get a little restless  
And you get a little wasted  
It's just a little light entertainment  
Embrace it  
It might just save your life  
  
You always say you're sorry  
But you never know what for  
And it's been happening more and more  
Act your age and not your shoe size  
And blah blah blah blah blah  
That's your role model  
  
Slammin' the door  
  
So it's only natural to feel  
The guilt of a nation  
It's only human when your young  
You're gonna cry  
  
Don't worry baby  
If you get a little high  
It's just a phase to get you through  
Getting by  
So you get a little restless  
And you get a little wasted  
It's just a little light entertainment  
Embrace it  
It might just save your life  
  
So where else can you go to  
Cause no one's given you the book  
About what to say and how to feel  
And what you should and shouldn't have took  
It's feelings that your fearing  
That's why you step outside your mind  
  
Don't look back  
'Cause if you don't crack  
You get to sing this lullaby  
You get to sing this lullaby
