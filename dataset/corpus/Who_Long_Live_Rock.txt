Down at the Astoria the scene was changing  
Bingo and rock were pushing out x-rating  
We were the first band to vomit at the bar  
And find the distance to the stage too far  
Meanwhile it's getting late at ten o'-clock  
Rock is dead they say  
Long live rock  
  
Long live rock! I need it every night  
Long live rock! Come on and join the line  
Long live rock! Be it dead or alive  
  
People walk in sideways pretending that they're leaving  
We put on our makeup and work out all the lead-ins  
Jack is in the alley selling tickets made in Hong Kong  
Promoter's in the pay box wondering where the band's gone  
Back in the pub the governor stops the clock  
Rock is dead they say  
Long live rock  
  
Long live rock! I need it every night  
Long live rock! Come on and join the line  
Long live rock! Be it dead or alive  
  
Landslide, rocks are falling, falling down upon our very heads  
We tried but you were yawning. Look again  
Rock is dead  
Rock is dead  
Rock is dead  
  
The place is really jumping to the high watt amps  
'Til a twenty inch cymbal fell and cut the lamps  
In the blackout they danced right into the aisle  
And as the doors fly open even the promoter smiles  
Someone takes his pants off and the rafters knock  
Rock is dead they say  
Long live rock  
  
Long live rock! I need it every night  
Long live rock! Come on and join the line  
Long live rock! Be it dead or alive
