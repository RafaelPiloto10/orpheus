I am a lady in Spain  
I'll sing a haunting refrain  
I am a lady from Mars  
And I can unscrew the stars  
I can be anything that I see  
I can be anything that I, anything that I see  
  
I am in love with a boy  
Manufactured to destroy  
So I shall unravel my love  
Like an old red woolen glove  
  
I can do anything I want to  
I can do anything I want, anything my heart tells me to do  
Tells me to do  
Tells me to do  
  
I can be anything that I see  
I can do anything I want to  
  
I can do anything I want to  
I can be anything that I, anything that I see
