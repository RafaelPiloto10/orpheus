Everywhere everybody needs a neighbor  
Showing up when times get hard  
But there's friends of sons and daughters  
Saying grace without supper in your backyard  
Who doesn't wanna be a hero?  
At least a little bit of helpin' out  
There's some things you're never gonna help or change  
But hunger's somethin' we can turn around  
  
Here's hope (here's hope)  
Showin' up at your front door  
Here's hope (here's hope)  
Yeah what everybody's looking for  
Here's your one chance to make a difference  
Here's your one choice to give a helping hand  
There's room at the table for more  
Yeah here's hope  
Yeah here's hope  
  
There's a small-town girl in third grade  
Makin' sure her sisters get enough  
She sees her mama working two jobs worrying and crying,  
Doing everything but giving up  
If a miracle's a gift when you need it  
Then it's time for stepping in  
Here's to families and kids, where ever you live  
Never ever wondering again  
  
Here's hope (here's hope)  
Showin' up at your front door  
Here's hope (here's hope)  
Yeah what everybody's looking for  
Here's your one chance to make a difference  
Here's your one choice to give a helping hand  
There's room at the table for more  
Yeah here's hope  
  
Here's to going to bed not hungry  
Here's to changing the story  
Here's to bigger hearts and brighter days  
Let me hear you sing it for me  
Let me hear you sing it for me  
  
Here's hope (here's hope)  
Showin' up at your front door  
Here's hope (here's hope)  
Yeah what everybody's looking for  
Here's your one chance to make a difference  
Here's your one choice to give a helping hand  
There's room at the table for more  
Yeah here's hope (here's hope)  
Yeah here's hope (here's hope)  
  
Yeah here's hope (here's hope (yeah here's hope))  
Yeah here's hope (here's hope (yeah here's hope))  
Yeah here's hope
