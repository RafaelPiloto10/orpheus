Can I believe my ears?  
Is this really you?  
Pacing the floor with one eye on the door  
Watching the winners go through  
Why do you hang back now?  
Why d'you hesitate?  
You fires don't burn  
For he who waits  
  
Out of all of the people  
That I ever knew  
If one should have made it  
It should have been you!  
  
I know who I'm looking for  
But I don't believe my eyes  
The sight of you with your head hung low  
Is a sick, sad surprise  
Why do you hang back now?  
Why d'you hesitate?  
How dare you throw it all away then tell me  
Aw man it must be fate  
  
Out of all of the people  
That I ever knew  
There had to one I could believe in  
And it should have been you!  
  
A gift that dies is a tragic thing  
And it happens all the time  
But a gift that's wasted, thrown to hell is the  
Worst of stupid crimes!  
I saw you hang back now!  
I watched you hesitate!  
You're a well respected man, but bullshit!  
You could've been great!  
  
Out of all the people  
I ever knew  
There should have been one  
And it should have been you!  
  
I spent my whole life  
Looking for someone like you!
