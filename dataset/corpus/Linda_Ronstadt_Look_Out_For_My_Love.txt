There's a lot to learn  
For wasting time  
There's a heart that burns  
There's an open mind  
Look out for my love  
Look out for my love  
Look out for my love  
Look out for my love  
You own it  
You own it now  
You own it  
There's a weight on you  
But you can't feel it  
Living like I do  
It's hard for you to see it  
Was I hurt too bad  
Can I show you daylight  
How can I be sad  
When I know that you might  
Look out for my love  
Look out for my love  
Look out for my love  
Look out for my love  
Look out for my love  
It's in your neighborhood  
I know things are gonna change  
But I can't say bad or good  
There's a lot to learn  
For wasting time  
There's a heart that burns  
There's an open mind  
Look out for my love  
Look out for my love  
Look out for my love  
Look out for my love  
Look out for my love  
Look out for my love  
Look out for my love
