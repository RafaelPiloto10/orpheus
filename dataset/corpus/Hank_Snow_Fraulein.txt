Far across the deep blue water lives an old German's daughter  
By the banks of the old River Rhine  
Where I loved her and lost her but I can't forget her cause I miss my pretty
Fraulein  
(Fraulein Fraulein look up toward the heavens)  
Each night when the stars start to shine  
(By the same stars above you I swear that I love you)  
  
'Cause you are my pretty Fraulein  
When my memories wander away over yonder to the sweetheart that I left behind  
In a moment of glory a face comes before me the face of my pretty Fraulein  
Fraulein Fraulein walk down by the river (pretend that your hands are holding
mine)  
By the same stars above you I swear that I love you cause you are my pretty
Fraulein
