China all the way to new york  
I can feel the distance getting close  
You're right next to me  
But I need an airplane  
I can feel the distance as you breathe  
  
Sometimes I think you want me to touch you  
How can I when you build a great wall around you  
In your eyes I saw a future together  
You just look away in the distance  
  
China decorates our table  
Funny how the cracks don't seem to show  
Pour the wine dear  
You say we'll take a holiday  
But we never can agree on where to go  
  
Sometimes I think you want me to touch you  
How can I when you build a great wall around you  
In your eyes I saw a future together  
You just look away in the distance  
  
China all the way to New York  
Maybe you got lost in Mexico  
You're right next to me  
I think that you can hear me  
Funny how the distance learns to grow  
  
Sometimes I think you want me to touch you  
How can I when you build a great wall around you  
I can feel the distance  
I can feel the distance  
I can feel the distance getting close
