How do I love you. well let me see  
I love you like a lyric love a melody  
Baby, completely wrapped up in you  
How do I need you, well can't you tell  
I need you like a penny needs a wishing well  
Baby, completely wrapped up in you  
  
[Chorus]  
Every now and then when the world  
That we're living in is crazy  
You gladly hold me and carry me through  
No one in the world has ever done  
What you do for me and I'd be  
Sad and lonely if there were no you  
  
How do I love you, well count the ways  
There ain't a number high enough to end this phrase  
Baby, completely wrapped up in you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
How do I love you, well, don't you know  
I love you about as deep as any love can grow  
Baby, completely wrapped up in you
