I'm kinda lost now  
Don't intervening, no meaning  
I have no cause now  
My heart is bleeding a tiny bit  
And it goes now  
I'm only bleeding at you and me  
Can be awesome  
But that's not realistic  
Pain that you've inflected  
It's so wicked  
I'm addicted  
You're the place of shifted  
Ain't no try to get physical  
I just wanna know  
Do you still wearing lipstick?  
You're so cryptic  
If You've lost my drug  
And you've got me lifted  
Just one night come at the...  
We can just be friends  
And we'll hold hands  
And dance until the night ends  
And I'll run the engines... Engines  
And I'll let you finish all my sentences  
You right here right now  
Girl that's a blessing  
Just one night  
We should learn some lessons  
Looking so flatted while you're dressing  
Like this we can guess them all  
Get them all like a festival  
But the rush you go  
I'm steady you just wanna pay  
Can't breathe like I'm living in space  
I'mma... With ace  
I'mma being mistakes  
Cause my life is a chase  
And I'm in the race  
See that you wanna to taste  
... My hand won't waste  
I don't care what they say  
I wasn't really looking at you  
But they say you were here  
With that dude  
Is it true?  
I've been captured  
We've been running like patrol  
Don't count that  
When the... That  
It's about that  
It's a trick right there  
Little home you shout that  
Going down rewind that  
We're going up right now  
  
I think I can find you somewhere  
I think I can find you somewhere  
I think I can find you somewhere  
I think I can find you somewhere  
  
Dance  
  
Oh look girl look some precious  
All I see is true pics and restless  
Well I guess is I have to leave  
Till I have intrigue... Something I can't believe  
Believe it's like Jesus
