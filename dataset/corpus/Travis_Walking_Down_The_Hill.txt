Walking down this hill tonight  
I had a thought all to myself  
As I contemplated the moonlight  
  
We've got it all, we've got it made  
I don't know how I got here  
But I'm holding on for the crash  
  
Pull myself out of the moon  
I know I'll never go there but  
It's shining down from up on high  
We got it made, we got it made  
I don't know what we gotta make  
Sooner or later we die  
  
We're apart, go to pieces  
While I go to sleep  
  
Look into my heart, oh baby  
Don't become a part of the past  
You can be a part of the key  
  
Don't turn away, don't run away  
Don't leave me hanging by a thread  
Shine a little love down on me  
  
We're in love, make your peace  
Wasting time is all you need  
  
Walking down this hill tonight  
I had a thought it was my own  
Moon swept by the clouds and save the starlight  
Or shall I be or shall I not be  
I don't know I just don't  
Feel like it tonight
