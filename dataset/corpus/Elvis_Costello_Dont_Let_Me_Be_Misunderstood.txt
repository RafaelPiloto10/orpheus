Baby can you understand me now  
Sometimes I feel a little mad  
Don't you know that no one alive can always be an angel  
When things go wrong I seem to be mad  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good  
Oh Lord please don't let me be misunderstood  
  
Baby sometimes I'm so carefree  
With a joy that's hard to hide  
Other times it seems that all I have to do is worry  
And then I know you're bound to see my other side  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If I get mad at you I want you to know  
That I never mean to take it out on you  
Life has its problems and I get my share  
But that is one thing I would never do 'cause I love you  
Oh don't you know I'm human  
I've got my faults just like any one  
Sometimes I lie awake long regretting  
Some foolish thing, some sinful thing I've done  
  
[Chorus:x3]
