Yeah!  
Poetry in motion  
One take, daddy  
This is how we do it in person, man  
Ladies and gentleman!  
You are now tuned in to the very best  
Jazze Phizzel  
Jazze Pha - that is for all you numb skulls out there  
Hey, speakin' of pimpin' - that's my nigga  
Young Buck!  
  
[Chorus]  
Just hop in my ride  
If you want some  
We can only get high  
If you want some  
Gotta open them wide  
If you want some  
I can see in your eyes that you want some  
  
I know you want me, shawty  
I know, I know, I know, I know  
I know you want me  
I know, I know, I know, I know  
I know you want me, shawty  
I know, I know, I know, I know  
I know you want me  
I know, I know, I know, I know  
I know you want me, shawty  
  
[Young Buck]  
These hos out here love me  
I get it wet  
Niggas' old ladies want to fuck me  
You should see the shit  
I'm nothin' like them other thugs  
That eat it quick  
Too many niggas in this club  
I need a bitch  
We park right up in the front  
You see the six  
I puff some smoke up out my blunt  
And pop the Crys  
I gotta find me a model  
I like 'em thick  
I make her hop in my Impala  
Go take a trip  
Clean off my shoe and pop my collar  
I'm rich, bitch  
Oh, what, you never seen a balla?  
Well, this is it  
I make that pussy feel good  
Till you tell me quit  
And I won't tell nobody that you let me hit  
Psych!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Young Buck]  
Okay then, shawty, if you ready  
Then let's go  
Let's take it from the dirty to the East and West Coast  
A couple shots of Patron  
Let's have a sex show  
I got a lot but' baby  
You can be my best ho  
I see you watchin' a playa  
She like my dress code  
Rockin' these Cartier's  
Drinkin' that X-O  
I know a place that we can go  
And get low  
You wit' a gangsta  
You ain't never felt like this before  
And if you know that pussy good  
Then hit tha floor  
Shake that ass like you should  
Go get that dough  
I'll make you love me if you let me  
Fo' real though  
See, down here we put Chevy's ridin' real slow  
So come on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Young Buck]  
Don't get scared, girl  
Show me what you got  
Show me what you got  
Just show me what you got  
I said, don't get scared, girl  
Show me what you got  
Show me what you got  
Just show me what you got  
C'mon, don't get scared, girl  
Show me what you got  
Show me what you got  
Just show me what you got  
I said, don't get scared, girl  
Show me what you got  
Just show me what you got  
Just show me what you got  
  
[Chorus]
