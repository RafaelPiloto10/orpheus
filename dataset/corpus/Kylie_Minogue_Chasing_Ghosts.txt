Like it's suffering  
  
I have this feeling  
It is forever  
That forever is so close  
  
I hear you calling after midnight  
After all night like a Van Gogh  
  
So allelujah  
The feeling is going through her  
Like a food caught into her throat  
  
If I lose her  
I don't know what I would do  
You got my eye chasing off ghosts  
  
You got me here waiting for your love  
You got me here waiting for you  
You got me here waiting for your love  
You got me here waiting for you  
  
With all this nature  
They calling names so they know  
Yeah, they what they know  
  
I'm hearing voices  
Drowning out the noises  
  
So allelujah  
The feeling is going through her  
Like a food caught into her throat  
  
If I lose her  
I don't know what I would do  
You got my eye chasing off ghosts
