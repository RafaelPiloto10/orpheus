Don't get me started, let's get it right  
There's no use to talk about it deep into the night  
Don't ask about secrets I could tell  
I'm gonna keep them to myself  
  
No bad decisions, no good advice  
No time to think about it even once or twice  
No second chances looking down the road  
When there's the only way, only way to go  
  
Oh it makes me wonder  
What's going on inside my head  
Well could it be the pressure that I'm under  
Makes me forget the things I never said  
  
I can't remember, I can't forget  
Take it from me there's not a moment of regret  
Since the day I learned to tie my shoes  
I found it hard to spread the news  
  
Oh it makes me wonder  
What's going on inside my head  
Well could it be the pressure that I'm under  
Makes me forget the things I never said  
  
It's hard to swallow, it's hard to take  
When I think about it now my knees begin to shake  
Never came to me to mention at the time  
Tell the truth it never crossed my mind  
  
Oh it makes me wonder  
What's going on inside my head  
Well could it be the pressure that I'm under  
Makes me forget the things I never said  
  
Oh it makes me wonder  
What's going on inside my head  
Could it be the pressure that I'm under  
Makes me forget the things I never said
