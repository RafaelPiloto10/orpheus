She wears a tight skirt but it won't rip or tear.  
When I went out with her she got extensions in her hair.  
She got style and she got the cat moves.  
You're gonna keep the beat Bud because she's coming after you.  
  
I ain't high, I won't lose  
I might be lookin for attention but I'm just not gunna lose  
It's Friday night, and there's going to be another chick on my tip  
But it won't be you baby.  
  
Got one more trick up my sleeve  
One more thing to say to you before I leave  
Yo girl you don't mean a thing to me  
And if you thought you ever did you were high on things  
  
I said high no but I'm not lying  
Gunna lose a Goddamn thing tonight  
  
I saidb Friday night there's going to be  
Another chick on my tip but it won't be you baby.  
  
Oh if you change your ways  
Oh I would lay down any time with you  
With you  
  
But I fear one more slip and this will go right  
But I'm not ready to say goodbye  
Because first I got a couple of tails  
I'm gunna kick it on down your butthole  
  
High, low. High on Booze  
Run for attention but I just can't lose  
Friday night there's going to be  
Another chick on my tip but it won't be me  
  
But, oh  
Oh if you change your ways  
Oh I would lay down anytime with her  
With her  
  
Got one my, my, my  
I know we had a couple of times  
But I'm ready to go  
I'm gunna kick it on down your butthole  
  
High, low, High on booze  
I'm gonna run for attention but I just can't lose  
Friday night there's going to be  
Another chick on my dick but it won't be me  
  
But oh,  
Oh, if you'll change your ways  
I would lay down anytime with her, With her
