Ready steady gonna meet you on the ballroom floor,  
Brother Eddie quit your banging on my bathroom door,  
After shaving yeah and after three,  
I'm after having me some fun you see,  
I'm getting ready for the night to come,  
And here i come.  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm just a hot shot hitting town,  
(have a little fun),  
Just a hot shot getting down,  
(ready steady run),  
I'm just a hot shot looking around,  
(loving on the run),  
I'm having fun.  
  
Get the recognition each and every place i go,  
Fashion leader in the Cuban heel and pointed toe,  
My Italian suit is pressed and clean,  
I'm the Latin lover of the local scene,  
I'm getting ready for the night to come.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
A faded picture on the mantelshelf,  
My older brother looks like myself,  
Remember Donny dated Susie,  
And Susie rated johnny,  
Johnny's into Susie,  
But Susie's into Ronnie,  
Ronnie waits for Louie,  
But Louie's singing Louie  
  
[Chorus]
