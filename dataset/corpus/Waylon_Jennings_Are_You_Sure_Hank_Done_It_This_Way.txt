Lord it's the same old tune, fiddle and guitar  
Where do we take it from here?  
Rhinestone suits and new shiny cars  
It's been the same way for years  
We need a change  
  
Somebody told me, when I came to Nashville  
Son you finally got it made  
Old Hank made it here, and we're all sure that you will  
But I don't think Hank done it this way  
No, I don't think Hank done it this way  
  
Ten years on the road, makin' one night stands  
Speedin' my young life away  
Tell me one more time just so's I'll understand  
Are your sure Hank done it this way?  
Did ol' Hank really do it this way?  
  
Lord I've seen the world, with a five piece band  
Looking at the back side of me  
Singing my songs, and one of his now and then  
But I don't think Hank done 'em this way  
I don't think Hank done 'em this way.  
Take it home.
