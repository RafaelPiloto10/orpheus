I wake up everyday on  
The wrong side of the bed  
But I won't lay down on the floor  
Like I'm the whore in your head  
Call me a failure  
Pretender, sex-offender, infector  
Say I killed all my friends  
And I deserve to be dead.  
  
Kiss baby kiss  
Bang baby bang  
Suck baby suck  
It's Vodevil  
Kiss baby kiss  
Bang baby bang  
Suck baby suck  
It's Vodevil  
  
This isn't music and we're not a band  
We're 5 middle fingers on a motherfucking hand  
This isn't music and we're not a band  
We're 5 middle fingers on a motherfucking hand  
  
I won't pull out I just came  
I want all of the blame  
your love is tin, faith is thin  
No concept of pain, right to complain  
All you fagazines, senile teens  
Jaw me black ball me  
Deejay yourself away and turn your back  
It will be easier to stab  
  
Kiss baby kiss  
Bang baby bang  
Suck baby suck  
It's Vodevil  
Kiss baby kiss  
Bang baby bang  
Suck baby suck  
It's Vodevil  
  
This isn't music and we're not a band  
We're 5 middle fingers on a motherfucking hand  
This isn't music and we're not a band  
We're 5 middle fingers on a motherfucking hand  
  
VIP add TRD violent shiny hate crime  
"Total Requested Dead" it's  
Version point (less) downloadable suicide.  
The only ones left standing are the ones not demanding  
This isn't a show, this is my fucking life  
I'm not ashamed you're entertained  
But  
I'm not a puppet  
I am a grenade  
I'm not ashamed you're entertained  
But  
I'm not a puppet  
I am a grenade  
  
Kiss baby kiss  
Bang baby bang  
Suck baby suck  
It's Vodevil  
Kiss baby kiss  
Bang baby bang  
Suck baby suck  
It's Vodevil  
  
This isn't music and we're not a band  
We're 5 middle fingers on a motherfucking hand  
This isn't music and we're not a band  
We're 5 middle fingers on a motherfucking hand
