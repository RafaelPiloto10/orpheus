I woke up today  
To find myself in the other place  
With a trail of footprints  
From where I ran away  
It seems everything I've heard  
Just might be true  
And you know me  
(well you think you do)  
Sometimes, I have everything - yet I wish I felt something  
  
Do you know how far this has gone?  
Just how damaged have I become?  
When I think I can overcome  
It runs even deeper  
  
And in a dream I'm a different me  
With a perfect you  
We fit perfectly  
And for once in my life I feel complete  
And I still want to ruin it  
Afraid to look  
As clear as day  
This plan has long been underway  
  
I hear them call  
I cannot stay  
The voice inviting me away  
  
Do you know how far this has gone?  
Just how damaged have I become?  
When I think I can overcome  
It runs even deeper  
Everything that matters is gone  
All the hands of hope have withdrawn  
Could you try to help me hang on?  
It runs...  
  
I straight  
I won't crack  
On my way  
And I can't turn back  
I'm okay  
I'm on track  
On my way  
And I can't turn back  
I stayed  
On this track  
Gone too far  
And I can't come back  
I stayed  
On this track  
Lost my way  
Can't come back
