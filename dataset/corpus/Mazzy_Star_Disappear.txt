Just because  
You call my name  
I cannot hear  
It's not the same  
You close your eyes  
And knock me back  
All the things that I had to have  
  
And now you choose the thorny cave  
I can't believe what I had to say  
All the things you never say  
I'll never be what you want me to be  
  
Now I can't disappear  
  
Close your eyes and look at me  
I can't believe what I cannot see  
Everything is like you say  
Change your mind and you'll have to forgive  
  
And I can't disappear  
Now I can't  
Now I can't
