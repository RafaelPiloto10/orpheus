The sheep's in the meadow  
The cow's in the corn  
Now is the time for a child to be born  
You'll laugh at the moon and you'll cry for the sun  
And if it's a boy he'll carry a gun  
Sang the crow on the cradle  
And if it should be that this baby's a girl  
Never you mind if her hair doesn't curl  
With rings on her fingers dna bells on her toes  
A shadow above her wherever she goes  
Sang the crow on the cradle  
The crow on the cradle  
The black on the white  
Somebody's baby is born for a fight  
The crow on the cradle  
The white on the black  
Somebody's baby is not coming back  
Sang the crow on the cradle  
Bring me my gun and I'll shoot  
That bird dead  
That's what your mother and  
Father once said  
A crow on the cradle what can we do  
This is the thing I must leave up to you  
Sang the crow on the cradle
