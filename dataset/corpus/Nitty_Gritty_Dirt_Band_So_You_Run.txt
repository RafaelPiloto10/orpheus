You've got to be the rich man  
You keep your momma worrying  
They say that life's a bitch man  
So you run and you run and you run  
Got to be the fat man  
To keep the pretty woman happy  
Cause if she get's the itch man  
She'll run and she'll run and she'll run  
You never hear the shot  
That brings you down  
One day you wake up  
A hole in your life  
Don't know you've fallen  
Until you hit the ground  
Too many pieces to pick up  
And put back  
Got to be chic man  
Drive a Masarati  
Don't want to be no geek man  
So you run and you run and you run  
Your down friends are comin' around  
One day you wake up  
Flat on your face  
The only difference is  
You're all alone  
Too many pieces to pick up  
And put back  
Run and run  
Run and run  
You've got to be the rich man  
You keep the finest all to yourself  
They say that life's a bitch man  
Cause you run and you run and you run  
Yes you run  
And you run  
Yes you run  
And you run  
And you run  
You run  
And you run  
Yes you run  
And you run  
And you run  
Run and run  
Run and run  
Run and run  
Run and run
