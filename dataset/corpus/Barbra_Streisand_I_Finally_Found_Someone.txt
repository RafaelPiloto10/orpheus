I finally found someone, that knocks me off my feet  
I finally found the one, that makes me feel complete  
We started over coffee, we started out as friends  
It's funny how from simple things, the best things begin  
  
This time it's different, dah dah dah dah  
It's all because of you, dah dah dah dah  
It's better than it's ever been  
'Cause we can talk it through  
Oh, my favorite line was "Can I call you sometime?"  
It's all you had to say to take my breath away  
  
This is it, oh, I finally found someone  
Someone to share my life  
I finally found the one, to be with every night  
'Cause whatever I do, it's just got to be you  
My life has just begun  
I finally found someone, oh, someone  
I finally found someone, oh  
  
Did I keep you waiting, I didn't mind  
I apologize, baby, that's fine  
I would wait forever just to know you were mine  
And I love your hair, are you sure it looks right?  
I love what you wear, isn't it too tight?  
You're exceptional, I can't wait for the rest of my life  
  
This is it, oh, I finally found someone  
Someone to share my life  
I finally found the one, to be with every night  
'Cause whatever I do, it's just got to be you  
My life has just begun  
I finally found someone, oh, someone  
I finally found someone, oh  
  
Whatever I do, it's just got to be you  
My life has just begun  
I finally found someone
