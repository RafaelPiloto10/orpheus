Time is my friend  
Till it ain't, and runs out  
And, that is all, that I have  
Till it's gone  
  
Tried to build on bones of birds  
Singing in the cold and fall to earth  
  
Hey! Sometimes she won't cry  
When the smallest one is trapped  
Too weak to survive  
Probably, maybe  
  
Tried to look out  
Through a hole in the vague  
Circle above, looking down  
Bird of prey  
  
Tried to build on bones of birds  
Singing in the cold and fall to earth  
  
Hey! Sometimes she won't cry  
When the smallest one is trapped  
Too weak to survive Too weak to survive  
Too weak to survive  
Probably, maybe  
  
Tried to build on bones of birds

Hey! Sometimes she won't cry  
When the smallest one is trapped  
Too weak to survive, Probably  
  
Hey, Sometimes she won't cry  
When the smallest one is trapped  
Too weak to survive  
Too weak to survive  
Too weak to survive  
(Maybe)
