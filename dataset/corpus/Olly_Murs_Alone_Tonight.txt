I can't leave you alone tonight!  
I can't leave you aloooone!  
  
Bring my beat at midnight  
Don't be till the daylight, do it right  
Kiss me with affection,  
Make that friends' connection with some tide,  
Alright  
You don't have to wait another life,  
Put it all, put it all, put it all over me  
And grant me on my wishes at one time  
Now give me that fantasy!  
  
Kiss me like a stranger  
It's time to misbehave  
Don't leave me lonely  
I can't leave you alone tonight  
You don't need my permission  
When you're in that position,  
When you hold me  
I can't leave you alone!  
  
Ooh uh oh oh  
Ooh uh oh oh  
Ooh uh oh oh  
Ooh uh oh oh  
  
Stroll down to the dancefloor,  
Act like you don't know me for tonight  
Sexy like a diva, dressed in black to tease me in the light  
Alright  
  
You don't have to wait another life,  
Put it all, put it all, put it all over me  
And grant me on my wishes at one time  
Now give me that fantasy!  
  
Kiss me like a stranger  
It's time to misbehave  
Don't leave me lonely  
I can't leave you alone tonight  
You don't need my permission  
When you're in that position,  
When you hold me  
I can't leave you alone!  
  
(A different kind of love,  
A different kind of love,  
A different kind of love,  
A different kind of love  
Ah ah ah ah)  
  
I'm lost in a different body  
Surely you can see the signs  
This thing you seize you're mine  
You're all tied up  
And it's different every time,  
But you always feel the same, the same  
Don't change, don't you ever change  
  
Be that fantasy that I visualize  
And you're telling me to do the same,  
And we'll just dress our love up in the skies  
And I'll show what that means!!  
  
Kiss me like a stranger  
It's time to misbehave  
Don't leave me lonely  
I can't leave you alone tonight  
You don't need my permission  
When you're in that position,  
When you hold me  
I can't leave you alooone!  
  
(A different kind of love,  
A different kind of love,  
A different kind of love,  
A different kind of love  
Ah ah ah ah  
A different kind of love,  
A different kind of love,  
A different kind of love,  
A different kind of love  
Ah ah ah ah)
