I don't want a lover's heartache  
I don't need nobody's sympathy  
So come on get the party started  
All I need is lying next to me  
  
We got our own situation  
Ready and steady to go  
Hang out, put out, get out  
That's what we're all about  
  
I wanna hear you shout mercy  
I wanna get a little crazy  
  
You got everything I'm after  
Flesh and blood just like a fantasy  
So make my heart start beating faster  
Love what is and what can never be  
  
You got a life you keep waiting  
Hiding so nobody sees  
Hang out, put out, get out  
That's what we're all about  
  
I wanna hear you shout mercy  
I wanna get a little crazy  
We're gonna make a little ecstasy  
You and me  
That's what we're all about  
Mercy  
  
We got our own situation  
Ready and steady to go  
Hang out, put out, get out  
That's what we're all about  
  
I wanna hear you shout mercy  
I wanna get a little crazy  
We're gonna make a little ecstasy  
You and me  
That's what we're all about  
Mercy  
  
I don't want a lover's heartache  
I don't need nobody's sympathy  
I don't want it and I don't need it  
Mercy
