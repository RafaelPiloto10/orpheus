There's a reason why  
You can look up every night  
And every star in heaven's in its place  
There's a reason why  
  
The full moon pulls the tide  
And the waves roll into a shore that always waits  
And just like that  
  
Baby you belong  
Baby you belong  
Nothin's ever been so meant to be  
Or ever felt so right to me  
  
Every single part of me believes  
Baby you belong (in my life)  
Oh, baby you belong (by my side)  
There really is no mystery  
  
I think anyone can see  
That baby you belong  
With me  
  
There's a voice inside  
And I heard it promise me  
When you came along  
I'd know you by heart  
  
Like a familiar song  
Every word is telling me  
That the time has finally come  
Now here you are  
And I know for sure  
  
Baby you belong (in my life)  
Baby you belong (by my side)  
Nothin's ever been so meant to be  
Or ever felt so right to me  
  
Every single part of me believes  
Baby you belong (in my life)  
Oh, baby you belong (by my side)  
There really is no mystery  
  
I think anyone can see  
That baby you belong  
  
Like the sun belongs up in the morning sky  
For at least another million reasons why  
  
Baby you belong  
Baby you belong  
Nothin's ever been so meant to be  
Or ever felt so right to me  
  
Baby you belong (in my life)  
Oh, baby you belong (by my side)  
Nothin's ever been so meant to be  
Every single part of me believes  
  
Baby you belong (in my life)  
Oh, baby, baby, baby, you belong (by my side)  
There really is no mystery  
I think anyone can see  
  
That baby you belong  
With me  
  
Baby, you belong with me
