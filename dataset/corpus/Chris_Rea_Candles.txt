Faith for reasons still unknown  
Like 'Bleak House fog' seems everywhere  
The truth has frozen into stone  
And hope lies freezing in the midnight air  
Though dark our days may seem  
This is a different dream  
Their freedom light don't shine at all  
  
So I will light a candle for you  
Keep it burning in the night  
And pray that you are all right  
I will light a candle for you  
Little candle burning bright  
  
When school yard heroes disappeared  
The little girl, she stands alone  
Oh I believe you if you say  
A prayer can help to get her home  
  
So I will light a candle for you  
Keep it burning in the night  
And pray that you are all right  
I will light a candle for you  
Little candle burning bright
