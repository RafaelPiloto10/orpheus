I have a dream about a lazy river  
After a drink or two  
I see myself in the water like a mirror  
But I don't see you  
  
So I'll meet you at the royal infirmary  
We can be together have some fun  
At the royal infirmary  
Maybe we can get along  
  
I had a dream about a bad connection  
I just couldn't get through  
I left a message with the operator  
A time to place a rendez vous  
  
I'll meet you at the royal infirmary  
We can be together have some fun  
At the royal infirmary  
Maybe we can get along  
  
We'll be dancing and singing  
Practise mudslinging  
And when things get scary  
We'll say three hail marys  
Drink till the morning then  
Off with the fairies  
  
I'll meet you at the royal infirmary  
We can be together have some fun  
At the royal infirmary  
Maybe we can get along
