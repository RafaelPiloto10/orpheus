This won't be easy  
You'll think it's strange  
When I try to explain how I feel  
That I still need your love  
After all that I've done  
  
You won't believe me  
All you will see is a girl you once knew  
Although she's dressed up to nines  
For sixes and sevens with you  
  
I had to let it happen  
I had to change  
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel  
Looking out of the window  
Staying out of the sun  
So I choose freedom  
Running around, trying everything new  
But nothing impressed me at all  
I never expected it too  
  
Don't cry for me, Argentina  
The truth is I never left you  
All through my wild days  
My mad existence  
I kept my promise, don't keep your distance  
  
And as for fortune  
And as for fame  
I never invited them in  
Though it appeared to the world  
They were all I desired  
They are illusions  
They're not the solutions they promised to be  
The answer was here all the time  
I love you, and hope you love me  
  
Don't cry for me, Argentina  
The truth is I never left you  
All through my wild days  
My mad existence  
I kept my promise,  
Don't keep your distance  
I kept my promise  
Don't keep your distance
