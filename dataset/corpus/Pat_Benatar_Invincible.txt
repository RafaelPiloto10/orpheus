This bloody road remains a mystery  
This sudden darkness fills the air  
What are we waiting for?  
Won't anybody help us?  
What are we waiting for?  
  
We can't afford to be innocent  
Stand up and face the enemy  
It's a do or die situation  
We will be invincible  
  
This shattered dream you cannot justify  
We're gonna scream until we're satisfied  
What are we running for?  
We've got the right to be angry  
What are we running for?  
When there's no where we can run to anymore  
  
We can't afford to be innocent  
Stand up and face the enemy  
It's a do or die situation  
We will be invincible  
And with the power of conviction  
There is no sacrifice  
It's a do or die situation  
We will be invincible  
  
Won't anybody help us?  
What are we running for?  
When there's no where, no where we can run to anymore  
  
We can't afford to be innocent  
Stand up and face the enemy  
It's a do or die situation  
We will be invincible  
  
And with the power of conviction  
There is no sacrifice  
It's a do or die situation  
We will be invincible  
  
Yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
We can't afford to be innocent  
Stand up and face the enemy  
It's a do or die situation  
We will be invincible
