Let it rain  
As I walk these streets unknown  
To no one named  
Not even myself  
When I'm low  
  
Give me hope  
That help is coming  
When I need it most  
Give me hope  
That help is coming  
When I need it most  
  
Let it go  
No mother no father no home  
Forget as all others  
Have forgotten  
When I'm alone  
  
But give me hope  
That help is coming  
When I need it most  
Give me hope  
That help is coming  
When I need it most  
  
Let it come  
Love that lifts me up  
Pain that brings me down  
Everything I'd ever want and don't  
When I'm not strong  
  
But give me hope  
That help is coming  
When I need it most  
Give me hope  
That help is coming  
When I need it most  
  
Let it rain  
Let it flood these streets and wash me away  
To where it makes no difference who I am  
Or what the future holds  
When I don't know  
  
But give me hope  
That help is coming  
When I need it most  
Give me hope  
That help is coming  
When I need it most
