Look out, here comes tomorrow  
That's when I'll have to choose  
How I wish I could borrow  
Someone else's shoes  
  
Mary, oh what a sweet girl  
Lips like strawberry pie  
Sandra, the long hair and pig tails  
Can't make up my mind  
I see all kinds of sorrow  
Wish I loved only one  
Look out here comes tomorrow  
Oh how I wish  
Tomorrow would never come  
  
Told them both that I loved them  
Said it, and it was true  
But I can't have both of them  
Don't know what to do  
  
I see all kinds of sorrow  
Wish I loved only one  
Look out here comes tomorrow  
Oh how I wish  
Tomorrow would never come  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
I see all kinds of sorrow  
Wish I loved only one  
Look out here comes tomorrow  
Oh how I wish  
Tomorrow would never come
