Dear lover  
Do you remember?  
The sound of your laughter and demise  
And that was all  
I need to fall in love  
  
This matter  
It's something bigger  
Anything ever graced my heart  
And that was all  
I could fall in love, with you  
And I can't stall this now  
  
Did you find some happiness with me?  
Now I know the way true love should be  
  
Dear lover  
Do you remember?  
The beats of my heart that I gave you  
And that was all  
I need to fall in love  
  
It shattered  
Slipped through my fingers  
Floated down safely into your hands  
And that was all  
I could fall in love, with you  
I can't stall this now  
  
Ooh Ooh Ooh  
  
Did you find some happiness with me?  
  
Yea yea yea  
Yea yea yea yea
