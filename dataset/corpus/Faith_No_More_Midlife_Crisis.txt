Go on and wring my neck  
Like when a rag gets wet  
A little discipline  
For my pet genius  
  
My head is like a lettuce  
Go on and dig your thumbs in  
I cannot stop giving  
I'm thirty-something  
  
Sense of security  
Like pockets jingling  
Midlife crisis  
Suck ingenuity  
  
Down through the family tree  
You're perfect, yes, it's true  
But without me you're only you  
Your menstruating heart  
  
It ain't bleedin' enough for two  
It's a midlife crisis...  
What an inheritance  
The salt and the Kleenex  
  
Morbid self attention  
Bending my pinky back  
A little discipline  
A donor by habit  
  
A little discipline  
Rent an opinion  
Sense of security  
Holding blunt instrument  
  
I'm a perfectionist  
And perfect is a skinned knee  
You're perfect, yes, it's true  
But without me you're only you  
  
Your menstruating heart  
It ain't bleeding enough for two  
It's a midlife crisis...
