For the first time in my life I'm up to run away  
It's not a choice that I made easily  
  
It's not that I'm ashamed to face the light of day  
It's really just a case of self-delusion  
  
And I know it ain't easy  
I know it ain't easy  
I know it ain't easy  
To see the truth  
  
So run the sun, here's one for the road  
And may God's love go with you  
My tears are starting to show  
Whoa  
  
That I should fall from grace implies a twist of fate  
But I'm open to the joys and woes of passion  
  
And who shall take the wheel when it's time for overkill?  
There's no release when destiny is calling  
  
And I know it ain't easy  
I know it ain't easy  
I know it ain't easy  
To see the truth  
  
So run the sun, here's one for the road  
And may God's love go with you  
My tears are starting to show  
Whoa  
  
So run to the sun, here's one for the road  
Though I'll never be lonely  
Are you so high above me?  
Whoa  
  
Run to the sun  
Run to the sun  
Run to the sun  
  
And I know it ain't easy  
Somebody reach me  
Willing to teach me  
  
So run to the sun, here's one for the road  
And may God's love go with you  
My tears are starting to show  
Whoa  
  
I'll run to the sun, here's one for the road  
Though I'll never be lonely  
Are you so high above me?  
Whoa  
  
So run to the sun, here's one for the road  
And may God's love go with you  
My tears are starting to show  
Whoa  
So run to the sun, here's one for the road  
Though I'll never be lonely  
Are you so high above me?  
Whoa
