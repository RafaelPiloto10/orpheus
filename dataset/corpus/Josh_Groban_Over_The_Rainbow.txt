Somewhere over the rainbow  
Way up high  
There's a land that I heard of  
Once in a lullaby  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow  
Skies are blue  
And the dreams that you dare to dream  
Really do come true  
  
Someday I'll wish upon a star  
And wake up where the clouds  
Are far behind me  
  
And troubles melt like lemon drops  
Away above the chimney tops  
That's where you'll find me  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow  
Bluebirds fly  
Birds fly over the rainbow  
Why then, oh why can't I?  
  
Someday I'll wake and rub my eyes  
And in that land beyond the skies  
You'll find me  
  
I'll be a laughing daffodil  
And leave the silly cares  
That fill my mind behind me  
  
Oh somewhere over the rainbow  
Bluebirds fly  
If birds can fly over the rainbow  
Why then, oh why can't I?  
  
If happy little bluebirds fly  
Beyond the rainbow  
Why oh why can't I?
