Hey baby won't you look my way  
I could be your new addiction  
Hey baby what you got to say

I'm a sorry sucker and this happens all the time  
I find out that  
Everybody talks  
Everybody talks  
Everybody talks  
  
It started with a whisper  
And that was when I kissed her  
And then she made my lips hurt  
I can't even chit-chat  
Take me to your love shack  
Mama's always got a backtrack  
And everybody talks babe  
  
Hey honey you could be my drug  
You could be my new prescription  
Too much can me an overdose  
All this stress talk make me itching  
On my mind yeah  
Everybody talks  
Everybody talks  
Everybody talks  
Too much  
  
It started with a whisper  
And that was when I kissed her  
And then she made my lips hurt  
I can't even chit-chat  
Take me to your love shack  
Mama's always got a backtrack  
And everybody talks babe  
  
Never thought I'd live to see the day  
When everybody's words got in the way

All you're giving me is friction  
Hey sugar what you got to say  
  
It started with a whisper  
And that was when I kissed her  
And then she made my lips hurt  
I can't even chit-chat  
Take me to your love shack  
Mama's always got a backtrack  
And everybody talks babe  
  
Everybody talks  
Everybody talks

It started with a whisper  
And that was when I kissed her  
Everybody talks
