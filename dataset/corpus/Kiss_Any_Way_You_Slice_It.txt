I caught the tail of a hurricane and I've never ever been the same  
I went out on a limb, gotcha under my skin, well alright  
You got dirt under your fingernails  
What I'm thinkin' can land me in jail  
Well, you're caught in this trap and you can never go back  
Well, oh no no  
I know you wanna cross the border and you know the doctor's orders  
Well it's better late than never, can't stay innocent forever  
It's alright, it's alright, yeah  
  
Any way you slice it, any way you slice it  
You know you can't deny it, any way you slice it  
You're hot under the collar  
Ain't your mother's little daughter anymore  
  
Ooh, ain't no wolf on the corner, can't keep it in any longer  
Well if you're lookin' for bliss  
What I got you can't miss, well alright  
  
When it works like a charm it'll do you no harm  
You'll be in heaven tonight  
I know you'll feel alright  
  
Any way you slice it, any way you slice it  
You know you can't deny it, any way you slice it  
I know what's in your heart, I know what's in your mind  
  
Any way you slice it, any way you slice it  
You know you can't deny it, any way you slice it  
You're hot under the collar  
Ain't your mother's little daughter anymore  
  
I know you wanna cross the border and you know the doctor's orders  
Well it's better late than never, can't stay innocent forever  
No, no, no, no  
  
Yeah, alright  
Well, if I told you once, I told you twice  
Just listen, babe, and take my advice  
Why settle for seconds when you can have the best  
So let me be your king bee, I want your hornets nest  
  
Any way you slice it, any way you slice it  
You know you can't deny it, any way you slice it  
I know what's in your heart, I know what's in your mind, yeah  
  
Any way you slice it, any way you slice it  
I know you can't deny it, any way you slice it  
You're hot under the collar  
Ain't your mother's little daughter anymore  
You know you ain't your mother's little daughter anymore  
Any way, ooh hoo
