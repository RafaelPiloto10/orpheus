Bye bye, baby, bye bye  
Don't want to make you cry  
Bye bye, baby, bye bye  
Don't want to make you cry  
I'll be leaving you now  
You'll get along somehow  
Time time is gone when you and I were strong  
Time time is gone when you and I were strong  
Isn't easy to leave, isn't easy to leave  
  
You spend you life thinking about living  
You spend your whole life  
  
Bye bye baby bye bye  
Don't want to make you cry  
  
Time time time is gone when you and I were strong  
Time time time is gone when you and I were strong  
Isn't easy to leave, isn't easy to leave  
  
You spend your time sitting there thinking  
Thinking about sitting there thinking  
You waste my time talking about dying  
Dying when you should be trying  
Bye bye, baby, bye bye  
Don't want to make you cry  
Bye bye, baby, bye bye  
Don't want to make you cry  
I'll be leaving you now  
You'll get along somehow  
  
Time time time is mine to make my fortune mine  
Time time time is mine to make my fortune mine  
Can't say I can see what'll happen to me  
Can't say I can see what'll happen to me  
Bye bye baby bye bye
