Get ready for love! Praise Him!  
Get ready tot love! Praise Him!  
Get ready for love! Get readyl  
  
Well, most of all nothing much  
Ever really happens  
And God rides high up in the ordinary sky  
Until we find ourselves at out most distracted  
And the miracle that was promised  
Creeps quietly by  
  
Calling every boy and girl  
Calling all around the world  
Calling every boy and girl  
Calling all around the world  
  
Get ready for love! Praise Him!  
Get ready for love! Praise Him!  
  
The mighty wave their hankies from their  
High-windowed palace  
Sending grief and joy down in supportable doses  
And we search high and low without  
Merty or malice  
While the gate to the Kingdom swings  
Shut and closes  
  
Calling every boy and girl  
Calling all around the world  
Calling every boy and girl  
Calling all around the world  
  
Praise Him till you've forgotten  
What you're praising Him for  
Praise Him till you've forgotten  
What you're praising Him for  
Then praise Him a little bit more  
  
Yeah, praise Him a little bit more  
Praise Him till you've forgotten  
What you're praising Him for  
Praise Him tillyou've forgotten what  
You're praising Him for  
Praise Him a little bit more  
Yeah, praise Him a little bit more  
  
Get ready for love! Praise Him!  
Get ready for love! Get ready!  
  
I searched the seven seas and I've looked  
Under the carpet  
And browsed through the brochures  
That govern the skies  
Then I was just hanging around, doing  
Nothing und looked up to see  
His face burned in the retina of your eyes  
  
Calling every boy and girl  
Calling all around the world  
Calling every boy and girl  
Calling all around the world  
  
Get ready for love! Praise Him!  
Get ready for love! Praise Him!
