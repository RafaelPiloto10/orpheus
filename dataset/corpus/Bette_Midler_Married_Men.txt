The world is full of married men  
With wives who never understand.  
They're looking for someone to share  
The excitement of a love affair.  
  
And just as soon as they find you  
They'll wine you and dine you.  
Fly on the wings of romance.  
But in the eyes of the world  
You're just another girl  
Who loves a married man.  
  
Uh! They do it, they do it, they do it, they do it  
Again and again.

These married men.  
  
Ooh, you make him feel so young,  
But his wife is still the number one.  
He promises to marry you.  
Yeah, just as soon as his divorce comes through.  
  
Whoa, it's not just a fling,  
He swears it's the real thing,  
A love that will last 'til the end.  
But as he's driving away  
You know it's true what they say  
About a, a married man.

These married men.  
  
Ah, he'll run when the scandal  
Gets too hot to handle.  
He'll say he just wants to be friends.  
And then he'll walk outta your life  
And go home to his wife  
'cause he's a married man.  
  
Oh, your love is a secret.  
You've got to sneak it  
Long as you can.  
Don't cry for your lover.
