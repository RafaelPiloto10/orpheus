I remember you  
You're the one that made my dreams come true  
Just a few kisses ago  
I remember you  
You're the one who said I love you too  
Yes I do  
Didn't you know  
I remember too, a distant bell  
And stars that fell, like the rain  
Out of the blue  
  
When my life is through  
And the angels ask me to recall  
The thrill of them all  
Then I will tell them I remember  
Tell them I remember  
Tell them I remember you  
  
I remember too, a distant bell  
And stars that fell, like the rain  
Out of the blue  
  
When my life is through  
And the angels ask me to recall  
The thrill of them all  
Then I will tell them I remember  
Tell them I remember  
Tell them I remember you
