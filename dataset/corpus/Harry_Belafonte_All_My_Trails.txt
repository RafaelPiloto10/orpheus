Hush little baby, don't you cry,  
You know your mother was born to die  
All my trials, Lord, soon be over  
Too late my brothers, too late  
But never mind  
All my trials, Lord soon be over  
  
The river of Jordan is chilly and cold  
It chills the body but it warms the soul,  
All my trials, Lord soon be over  
  
I've got a little book with pages three,  
And every page spells liberty,  
All my trials Lord, soon be over  
Too late my brothers, too late  
But never mind  
All my trials, Lord soon be over  
  
If living were a thing that money could buy,  
You know the rich would live  
And the poor would die,  
All my trials Lord, soon be over  
  
There grows a tree in Paradise,  
The Christians call it the tree of life,  
All my trials Lord, soon be over  
Too late my brothers, too late  
But never mind  
All my trials, Lord soon be over
