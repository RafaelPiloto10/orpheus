Well don't move  
Why don't you listen to what I'm saying  
And hey you  
You better get up if you plan to be staying  
Get loose  
You got to listen to what the band is playing  
Oh tonight  
There's action in the street all night  
We're bopping to the big beat, go  
Get up off your seat and roll  
At school  
The girls you know their dancing, mister 's just my speed  
And hey cool  
If action is the thing you need  
Well don't fool  
The kid's satisfaction guaranteed  
Oh tonight  
There's action in the street all night  
We're bopping to the big beat, go  
Get up off your seat and roll  
Well hey man  
Yeah don't let the little girl sigh  
Understand  
If you just move your body side to side  
Raise your hand  
Shout until you're satisfied  
Oh tonight  
There's action in the street all night  
We're bopping to the big beat, go  
Get up off your seat and roll
