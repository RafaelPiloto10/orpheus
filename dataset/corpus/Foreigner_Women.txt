Women behind bars, women in fast cars, women in distress, women with no dress  
Women in airplanes, women who play games  
Women in uniform, see that woman with her clothes gone  
  
Women who satisfy, women you can't buy  
Like women in magazines, and women in a limousine  
Women who sip champagne, women who feel no pain  
Women in a disco, and women who don't want to know, no no  
  
Oh, women wanting sympathy, women feeling ecstasy  
Women who live in fantasies, bringing man to his knees  
  
Women who boil to love, women who need a shove  
Women who can't be beat, get that woman in the back seat, yeah yeah  
Women in the USA, those women steal your heart away  
Women into rock 'n' roll, women who steal the show, go go go  
  
Women that you write songs about, women that turn around and kick you out  
Women you dream about all your life  
Women that stab you in the back with a switchblade knife  
  
Oh women, oohoo, talking 'bout women, all 'round the world  
Yeah women, all the naughty girls, talking 'bout women, come on baby
