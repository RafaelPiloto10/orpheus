So many miles it seems  
Nothing can come between, your life and mine  
Before the ink is dry  
I feel just you and I, inside my mind  
  
Love is the arrow, fly straight and true  
Into this deep and fallow hart  
What am I to do  
What am I to do  
  
Another world to spin  
A distant tide come in, they always do  
A mother holds the son  
A lover waits alone, like me for you  
  
Love is the arrow, fly straight and true  
Into this deep and fallow hart  
What am I to do, what am I to do  
  
Into the highest cloud  
Before a word is spoken  
Beyond the slighest doubt  
Before the dream is woken
