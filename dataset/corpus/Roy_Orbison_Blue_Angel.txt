(Sha la la, dooby wah, dumb dumb dumb, yeh yeh, um)  
(Sha la la, dooby wah, dumb dumb dumb, yeh yeh)  
  
Oh blue angel, don't you cry just because he said goodbye  
Oh, ah ah ah no don't cry  
  
Oh blue angel, have no fear brush away lonely teardrops  
Hey hey, whoa whoa, o (yeah yeah, dumb wah wah wah wah)  
  
Well, love's precious flame can just burn in vain  
But you're not to blame  
You thought love was a game, oh such a shame  
  
But don't you cry, don't sigh  
I'll tell you why, I'll never say goodbye--blue angel  
(Sha la la, dooby wah, dumb dumb dumb, yeh yeh, um wah wah wah wah)  
  
We'll have loving so fine, magic moments divine  
If you'll just say you're mine I'll love you till the end of ti-i-ime  
  
Don't you worry your pretty head  
I'll never let you do-ow-ow-ow-ow-own  
I'll always be arou-ou-ou-ou-ound, blue angel  
  
(Sha la la, dooby wah, dumb dumb dumb, yeh yeh, um)  
Blu-ue an-an-gel (sha la la)
