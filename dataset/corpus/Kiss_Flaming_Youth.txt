Whoo yeah  
My parents think I'm crazy and they hate the things I do  
I'm stupid and I'm lazy, man, if they only knew  
  
How flaming youth will set the world on fire  
Flaming youth, our flag is flying higher and higher and higher  
  
My uniform is leather, and my power is my age  
I'm gettin' it together to break out of my cage  
  
Cause flaming youth will set the world on fire  
Flaming youth will set the world on fire  
Flaming youth, our flag is flying higher and higher and higher  
  
Flaming youth will set the world on fire  
Flaming youth will set the world on fire  
Flaming youth will set the world on fire  
Flaming youth will set the world on fire  
Flaming youth will set the world on fire  
Flaming youth, our flag is flying higher and higher  
And higher and higher and higher and higher and higher
