McCormack and Richard Tauber are singing by the bed  
There's a glass of punch below your feet and an angel at your head  
There's devils on each side of you with bottles in their hands  
You need one more drop of poison and you'll dream of foreign lands  
  
When you pissed yourself in Frankfurt and got syph down in cologne  
And you heard the rattling death trains as you lay there all alone  
Frank Ryan brought you whiskey in a brothel in Madrid  
And you decked some fucking blackshirt who was cursing all the yids  
At the sick bed of Cuchulainn we'll kneel and say a prayer  
And the ghosts are rattling at the door and the devil's in the chair  
  
And in the Euston tavern you screamed it was your shout  
But they wouldn't give you service so you kicked the windows out  
They took you out into the street and kicked you in the brains  
So you walked back in through a bolted door and did it all again  
At the sick bed of Cuchulainn we'll kneel and say a prayer  
And the ghosts are rattling at the door and the devil's in the chair  
  
You remember that foul evening when you heard the banshees howl  
There was lousy drunken bastards singing billy is in the bowl  
They took you up to midnight mass and left you in the lurch  
So you dropped a button in the plate and spewed up in the church  
  
Now you'll sing a song of liberty for blacks and paks and jocks  
And they'll take you from this dump you're in and stick you in a box  
Then they'll take you to Cloughprior and shove you in the ground  
But you'll stick your head back out and shout "We'll have another round"  
At the graveside of Cuchulainn we'll kneel around and pray  
And god is in his heaven, and billy's down by the bay
