To be someone must be a wonderful thing  
A famous footballer a rock singer  
Or a big film star, yes I think I would like that  
To be rich and have lots of fans  
Have lots of girls to prove that I'm a man  
And be no. 1 - and liked by everyone  
  
Getting drugged up with my trendy friends  
They really dig me and I dig them  
And the bread I spend - is like my fame - its quickly diminished  
  
And there's no more swimming in a guitar shaped pool  
No more reporters at my beck and call  
No more cocaine its only ground chalk  
No more taxis now well have to walk  
  
But didn't we have a nice time -  
didn't we have a nice time  
Oh wasn't it such a fine time  
  
I realize I should have stuck to my guns  
Instead shit out to be one of the bastard sons  
And lose myself - I know it was wrong - but its cost me a lot  
  
And there's no more drinking after the club shuts down,  
I'm out on me arse with the rest of the clowns  
Its really frightening without a bodyguard  
So I stay confined to my lonely room
