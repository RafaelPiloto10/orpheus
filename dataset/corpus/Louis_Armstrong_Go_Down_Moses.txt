(Go down Moses  
Way down in Egypt land  
Tell all Pharaohs to  
Let my people go)  
  
When Israel was in Egypt land  
Let my people go  
  
Oppressed so hard they could not stand  
Let my people go  
  
So God sayeth: "Go down, Moses  
Way down in Egypt land  
Tell all Pharaohs to  
Let my people go"  
  
So Moses went to Egypt land  
Let my people go  
  
He made all Pharaohs understand  
Let my people go  
Yes, the Lord said, "Go down, Moses  
Way down in Egypt land  
Tell all Pharaohs to  
Let my people go"  
  
Thus spoke the Lord  
Bold Moses said  
"Let my people go  
If not, I'll smite your firstborn dead  
Let my people go"  
  
God, the Lord said, "Go down, Moses  
Way down in Egypt land  
Tell all Pharaohs to  
Let my people go"  
  
Tell all Pharaohs  
To  
Let my people go
