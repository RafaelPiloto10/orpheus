Way down upon Sycamore Slough  
White man sings the blues  
Selling roses of paper mache  
And flecks of starlight dew  
Swiped a bunch and threw them your way  
Where hazy moonlight glows  
Way down, down along lazy river road  
Way down upon Shadowfall Ward  
End of the avenue  
Run, hide, seek in your own backyard  
Mama's backyard won't do  
All night long I sing love's sweet songs  
Down where the water flows  
Way down, down along lazy river road  
Moonlight wanes as hound dogs bay  
Never quite catch the tune  
Stars fall down in buckets like rain  
There ain't no standin' room  
Bright blue boxcars train by train  
Clatter while dreams unfold  
Way down, down along lazy river road  
Way down upon Seminole Square  
Belly of the river tide  
Call for me and I will be there  
For the price of a taxi ride  
Nighttime double clutches into the day  
Like a truck down shifting it's load  
Way down, down along lazy river road  
Moonlight wanes as hound dogs bay  
Never quite catch the tune  
Stars fall down in buckets like rain  
There ain't no standin' room  
Bright blue boxcars train by train  
Clatter while dreams unfold  
Way down, down along lazy river road  
Thread the needle right through the eye  
The thread that runs so true  
All the others I let pass by  
I only wanted you  
Never cared much for careless love  
Oh, how your bright eyes glow  
Way down, down along lazy river road  
Way down, down along lazy river road  
Way down, down along lazy river road
