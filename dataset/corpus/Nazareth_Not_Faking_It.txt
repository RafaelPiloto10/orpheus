Slim Jim was a stool pidgeon  
On the payroll of the f.b.i.  
Reverend Fred sold instant religion  
With a license from the man in the sky  
Billy the kid was a gunslinger  
Edgar Wallace was a dead ringer  
Me, I'm just a rock'n'roll singer  
  
Keyhole Pete was a keen watcher  
Had a telephoto lens in each eye  
Jack the ripper was a cool stalker  
But his birds no longer fly  
James Joyce was a mudslinger  
Jesus Christ was a forgiver  
Me, I'm just a rock'n'roll singer  
  
I'm not fakin' it  
Foolin' myself that I'm makin' it  
I'm not fakin' it  
  
Tricky dicky was a fast talker  
But his promises were always a lie  
Nostradamus was a doomwatcher  
Predicted when we're gonna die  
Cleopatra was a love giver  
Jesse James was a born killer  
Me, I'm just a rock'n'roll singer
