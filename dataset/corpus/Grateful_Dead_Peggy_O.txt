As we rode out to Fennario, as we rode on to Fennario  
Our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove  
And called her by a name, pretty Peggy-O.  
Will you marry me pretty Peggy-O, will you marry me pretty Peggy-O  
  
If you will marry me, I'll set your cities free  
And free all the ladies in the area-O.  
I would marry you sweet William-O, I would marry you sweet William-O  
I would marry you but your guineas are too few  
  
And I fear my mama would be angry-O.  
What would your mama think pretty Peggy-O,  
What would your mama think pretty Peggy-O,  
What would your mama think if she heard my guineas clink  
  
Saw me marching at the head of my soldiers.  
If ever I return pretty Peggy-O, if ever I return pretty Peggy-O  
If ever I return your cities I will burn  
Destroy all the ladies in the area-O.  
  
Come steppin' down the stairs pretty Peggy-O,  
Come steppin' down the stairs pretty Peggy-O,  
Come steppin' down the stairs combin' back your yellow hair  
Bid a last farewell to your William-O.  
  
Sweet William he is dead pretty Peggy-O,  
Sweet William he is dead pretty Peggy-O,  
Sweet William he is dead and he died for a maid  
And he's buried in the Louisiana country-O.  
  
As we rode out to Fennario, as we rode out to Fennario  
Our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove,  
And called her by a name, pretty Peggy-O.
