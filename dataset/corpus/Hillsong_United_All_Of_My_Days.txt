Proclaim Your awesome power  
Tell of mighty deeds  
Declare Your future kingdom  
Of everlasting peace  
  
And my eyes they look unto You always  
And I am captured by Your Majesty  
  
All of my days  
I will sing of Your greatness  
All of my days  
I will speak of Your grace  
All of my days  
I will tell of Your wonderous love  
Your love in my life  
Your love  
  
All Your works will praise You  
Your children bless Your name  
We speak of all Your goodness  
We walk in fields of grace
