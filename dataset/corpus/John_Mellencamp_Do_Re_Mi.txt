Lots of folks back East, they say, is leavin' home every day  
Beatin' the hot old dusty way to the California line  
'Cross the desert sands they roll, gettin' out of that old dust bowl  
They think they're goin' to a sugar bowl, but here's what they find --  
Now, the police at the port of entry say  
"You're number fourteen thousand for today."  
Oh, if you ain't got the do re mi, folks, you ain't got the do re mi  
Why, you better go back to beautiful Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Georgia,
Tennessee  
California is a garden of Eden, a paradise to live in or see  
But believe it or not, you won't find it so hot  
If you ain't got the do re mi  
You want to buy you a home or a farm, that can't deal nobody harm  
Or take your vacation by the mountains or sea  
Don't swap your old cow for a car, you better stay right where you are  
Better take this little tip from me  
'Cause I look through the want ads every day  
But the headlines on the papers always say  
If you ain't got the do re mi, boys, you ain't got the do re mi  
Why, you better go back to beautiful Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Georgia,
Tennessee  
California is a garden of Eden, a paradise to live in or see  
But believe it or not, you won't find it so hot  
If you ain't got the do re mi
