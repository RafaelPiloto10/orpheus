She leads a lonely life  
She leads a lonely life  
  
When she woke up late in the morning  
Light and the day had just begun  
She opened up her eyes and thought  
O' what a morning  
It's not a day for work  
It's a day for catching sun  
Just laying on the beach and having fun  
She's going to get you  
  
All that she wants is another baby  
She's gone tomorrow boy  
All that she wants is another baby  
All that she wants is another baby  
She's gone tomorrow boy  
All that she wants is another baby  
  
All that she wants, all that she wants  
  
So if you are in sight and the day is right  
She's a hunter you're the fox  
The gentle voice that talks to you  
Won't talk forever  
It's a night for passion  
But the morning means goodbye  
Beware of that is flashing in her eyes  
She's going to get you  
  
All that she wants
