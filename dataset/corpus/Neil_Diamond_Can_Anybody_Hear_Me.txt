You've gotta take your time now  
If love is gonna take you by the hand  
You need to take your time though  
'Cause love is not a thing you can command  
  
There's gotta be a reason  
Gotta be a closeness  
Gotta have a feeling  
Only you can know  
  
And when you find love hold on tight  
Don't ever waste another night  
You're gonna make it through in spite of your fears  
Can anybody hear me  
Is anybody out there  
  
I listen to the river  
And hear the river calling out a name  
Trying to forgive her  
But nothing's gonna ever be the same  
  
There's gotta be a reason  
Gotta be a closeness  
Gotta have a feeling  
Only you can know  
  
And when you find love hold on tight  
Don't ever waste another night  
You're gonna make it through in spite of your fears  
Can anybody hear me  
Is anybody out there  
  
Gotta be a reason  
Gotta feel a closeness  
Gotta have a feeling  
Only you can know it  
  
And when you find love hold on tight  
Don't ever waste another night  
You're gonna make it through in spite of your fears  
Can anybody hear me  
Is anybody out there  
  
Can anybody hear me  
Is anybody out there  
  
Can anybody out there hear me
