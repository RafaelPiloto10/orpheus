We use to laugh in the pouring rain  
Out in your corner everyday  
A thousand smiles can't hide the pain  
Can you give me, give me more love  
You never seem to satisfy  
Can't help but wonder why  
Why you lie to me everyday  
I just want you, want you to fly  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
How can I lift you up  
When you're the one who's bringing me down  
How can I sacrifice in your life  
I'm no one  
  
[Chorus:] [2x]  
I'm on the run hiding from you  
You wont find me I know what to do  
Under the sun thinking of you  
I hate to love you  
I love to hate you  
  
I used to call you on the phone  
Every time I feel alone  
You never leave me on my own  
That makes me  
Makes me feel all right  
  
Now you say you don't understand  
Everything that I have done  
All I want is peace of mind  
Can you give me, give me more time  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
How can I lift you up  
When you're the one who's bringing me down  
How can I sacrifice in your life  
I'm no one  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm on the run hiding from you  
You wont find me I know what to do  
Under the sun thinking of you  
I hate to love you  
I love to hate you
