Weird goings-on at the county jail  
Prisoners reading the sheriff's mail  
He's strapped down to a swivel chair  
Trying to swivel right out of there  
Pin-striped sweet's in cell 15  
Convinced his self it's all a dream  
He's got a pet black tabby cat  
That carries a gun and wears a stetson hat  
The door flies open, in strides geek  
Looking like the front page of newsweek  
He says to lou in a voice of glee,  
'what's the matter, ain't you glad to see me? '  
Lou's on the floor 'cause he can't stand up  
As green as a leaf in a tea-cup  
When on to geek's back jumps a stetson-hatted cat  
Which breaks geek's neck like he was a rat  
Long gone geek!
