Written by The Doors  
  
Well, she's fashionably lean  
Hey and she's fashionably late  
She'll never gonna wreck a scene  
She'll never break a date  
But now she's no drag  
Just watch the way that she walks  
  
She's a twentieth century fox  
She's a twentieth century fox  
She's got world, she's got the world  
All locked up inside a plastic box  
She's a twentieth century fox, oh yeah  
  
She's the queen of cool  
And she's the lady who waits  
Sent to manless school  
She never gonna hesitate  
Well know she don't waste her time  
On all this elementary talk  
  
She's a twentieth century fox  
She's a twentieth century fox  
She got the world, babe,  
Now she got this world  
She got it all locked up  
Inside some kind of plastic plastic box  
She's a Twentieth century fox, oh yeah  
She's a Twentieth century fox, oh yeah  
She's a Twentieth century fox, oh yeah  
She's a Twentieth century fox
