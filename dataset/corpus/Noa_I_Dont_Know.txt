Flower, colored bright  
I am strong, I can fight  
But I don't know, I don't know, I don't know  
Tower, brick and stone  
Make my way on my own  
But I don't know, I don't know, I don't know  
I don't know why, I don't know how  
If I can fly, can I fly now?  
Are my wings strong enough to bear  
The winds out there?  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I don't know  
Flower, colored bright

Are my wings strong enough to bear  
The winds out there?  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I don't know  
Tell me it'll never fade  
And I'll go forth unafraid  
'Cause I don't know, I don't know, I don't know  
Show me rain and flood  
To cool the fire in my blood  
'Cause I don't know, I don't know, I don't know  
I don't know why, I don't know how  
If I can fly, can I fly now?  
Are my wings strong enough to bear  
The winds out there?  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I don't know  
La lala lala la la la lala  
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know  
La lala lala la la la lala  
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know  
I don't know why, I don't know how  
If I can fly, can I fly now?  
Are my wings strong enough to bear  
The winds out there?  
I don't know why, I don't know how  
If I can fly, can I fly now?  
Are my wings strong enough to bear  
The winds out there?  
I don't know why, I don't know how  
If I can fly, can I fly now?  
Are my wings strong enough to bear  
Strong enough to bear...  
I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why  
I don't know how, I don't know how, I don't know how  
Are my wings strong enough  
Are my wings strong enough
