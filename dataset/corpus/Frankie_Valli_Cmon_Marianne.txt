Marianne, Marianne, Marianne, Marianne  
  
Whoa, ho, ho, here I am on my knees again  
I'll do anything just to make it right  
Say you'll understand, oh I know you can  
C'mon Marianne  
  
No matter what people say, it didn't happen that way  
She was a passing fling and not a permanent thing  
Say you'll understand, oh, I know you can  
  
C'mon Marianne  
(Baby)  
C'mon Marianne  
(Baby)  
  
C'mon Marianne  
(Baby)  
Say you can understand  
My Marianne, Marianne, Marianne, Marianne  
  
Well, now your big brown eyes are all full of tears  
From the bitterness of my cheatin' years  
So I hang my head, wish that I was dead  
  
C'mon Marianne  
(Baby)  
C'mon Marianne  
(Baby)  
  
C'mon Marianne  
(Baby)  
Say you can understand  
My Marianne  
(Baby)  
  
C'mon Marianne  
(Baby)  
C'mon Marianne  
(Baby)  
  
Marianne, Marianne, Marianne, Marianne
