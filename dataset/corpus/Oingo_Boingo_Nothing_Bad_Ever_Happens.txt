Nothing bad ever happens to me  
Nothing bad ever happens to me  
Why should I care?  
A man broke into my neighborhood  
He threatened the family with a loaded gun  
He tied them all up and beat 'em real good  
He took everything and he got away clean  
And I can't believe that anyone would  
Wanna do such a terrible thing  
But why should I care?  
Did ya hear about Fred, he's unemployed  
They threw him away like a useless toy  
He went down the drain after 20 long years  
No warning, no pension and nobody's tears  
And I can't believe that anyone would  
Wanna do such a terrible thing  
But why should I care?  
Why should I care?  
Every time I look around this place  
I see them scream but I hear no sound  
And the terrible things happen down the road  
To someone else that I don't even know  
CHORUS  
Nothing bad ever happens to me  
Nothing bad ever happens to me  
Nothing bad ever happens to me  
Nothing bad ever happens to me  
Why should I care?  
Have you heard about the Joneses, my, my, my  
It happened so quick and no one knows why  
Their teenage son, he seemed O.K.  
But his suicide ruined everyone's day  
And I can't believe that anyone would  
Wanna do such a terrible thing  
But why should I care?  
CHORUS  
(Nothing bad ever happens to me)  
Nothing bad ever happens to me
