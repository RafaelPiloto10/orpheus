You are the song  
Playing so softly in my heart  
I reach for you,  
You seem so near yet so far  
  
I hope and I pray  
You'll be with me someday  
I know down inside  
You are mine and I'm your true love  
Or am I dreaming  
  
How can I each time I try you say goodbye  
You were there  
You look my way I touch the sky  
We can share tomorrow and forever more  
And I'll be there to love you so  
You are my song  
  
I know for sure that  
We were meant to fall in love  
I look in your eyes  
I know what you're thinking of  
  
I try not to say  
The words that might scare you away  
I know down inside  
You are mine and I'm your true love  
Please no more dreaming  
  
How can I each time I try you say goodbye  
You were there  
You look my way I touch the sky  
We can share tomorrow and forever more  
I'll be there to love you so  
You are my song
