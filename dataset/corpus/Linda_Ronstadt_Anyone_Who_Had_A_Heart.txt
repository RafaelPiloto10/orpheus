Anyone who ever loved could look at me  
And know that I love you  
Amyone who ever dreamed could look at me  
And know I dream of you  
  
Knowing I love you so  
Anyone who had a heart  
Would take me in his arms and love me too  
You couldn't really have a heart and hurt me  
Like you hurt me and be so untrue  
What am I to do  
  
Every time you go away I always say  
This time it's goodbye dear  
Loving you the way I do I'd take you back  
Without you I'd die dear  
  
Knowing I love you so  
Anyone who had a heart  
Would take me in his arms and love me too  
You couldn't really have a heart and hurt me  
Like you hurt me and be so untrue  
What am I to do  
  
Knowing I love you so  
Anyone who had a heart  
Would take me in his arms and love me too  
You couldn't really have a heart and hurt me  
Like you hurt me and be so untrue  
Anyone who had a heart would love me too  
Anyone who had a heart would surely take me  
In his arms and always love me  
Why won't you, yeah  
Anyone who had a heart would love me too  
Anyone who had a heart would surely take me  
In his arms and always love me  
Why won't you  
Yeah  
Anyone who had a heart would love me too
