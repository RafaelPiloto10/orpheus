You, you, you  
  
I loved so much that I cried  
I danced so much til I was tired  
I drank some red wine and now I'm walking on the sky  
I had the time of my life  
  
And you know, I, I, I  
I'm feeling alright  
'Cause I don't got to worry 'bout a thing  
  
And you know, I, I, I  
I'm feeling alright  
'Cause I don't got to worry 'bout a thing  
  
When I'm with you  
I'm chillin', I'm chillin'  
When I'm with you  
I'm chillin', I'm chillin'  
When I'm with you  
I'm chillin', I'm chillin'  
When I'm with you  
I'm chillin', I'm chillin'  
I'm chill  
  
I sang so loud that I smiled  
I made it worth my while  
I drank some white wine  
Now I'm walking on the sky  
I had the time of my life  
  
And you know, I, I, I  
I'm feeling alright  
'Cause I don't got to worry about a thing  
  
And you know, I, I, I  
I'm feeling alright  
'Cause I don't got to worry about a thing  
  
When I'm with you  
I'm chillin', I'm chillin'  
When I'm with you  
I'm chillin', I'm chillin'  
When I'm with you  
I'm chillin', I'm chillin'  
When I'm with you  
I'm chillin', I'm chillin'  
I'm chill  
  
Everyday, everyday, everyday  
Chillin' with you  
Everyday, everyday, everyday  
Chillin' with you  
I'm chillin' with you  
I'm chillin' with you  
I'm chillin' with you  
I'm chillin' with you  
I'm chillin' with you  
I'm chillin' with you  
I'm chillin' with you  
  
And you know, I, I, I  
I'm feeling alright  
'Cause I don't got to worry about a thing  
  
When I'm with you  
I'm chillin', I'm chillin'  
When I'm with you  
I'm chillin', I'm chillin'  
When I'm with you  
I'm chillin', I'm chillin'  
When I'm with you  
I'm chillin', I'm chillin'  
I'm chill
