I had a dream last night  
That I was piloting a plane  
And all the passengers were drunk and insane  
I crash landed in a Louisiana swamp  
Shot up a horde of zombies  
But I come out on top  
What's it all about?  
It just reflects my mood  
  
Sitting in the dirt  
Feeling kind of hurt  
Aaaaall I hear is doooom and gloom  
And aaaaall is darkness in my room  
Through the light your face I see  
Baby take a chance  
Baby won't you dance with meeeeee  
  
Lost all that treasure in an overseas war  
It just goes to show you don't get what you paid for  
Battle to the rich and you worry about the poor  
Put my feet up on the couch  
And lock all the doors  
Hear a funky noise  
That's the tightening of the screeeeews  
  
I'm feeling kind of hurt  
Sitting in the dirt  
Aaaaall I hear is doooom and gloom  
But when those drums go boom boom boom  
Through the night your face I see  
Baby take a chance  
Baby won't you dance with meeee  
Yeah  
Baby won't you dance with meeee  
Oh yeah  
  
Fracking deep for...  
But there's nothing in the sump  
There's kids all picking  
Ar the garbage dumb  
I'm running out of water  
So I better prime the pump  
I'm trying to stay sober  
But I end up drunk  
  
We'll be eating dirt  
Living on the side of the roooaaad  
There's some food for thought  
Kind of makes your head explode  
Feeling kind of hurt  
Yeah  
  
But aaaall I hear is doooom and gloom  
And aaaaall is darkness in my room  
Through the night your face I see  
Baby come on  
Baby won't you dance with me  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Baby won't you dance with me  
I'm feeling kind of hurt  
Baby won't you dance with meeeee  
Yeah  
Come on  
Baby won't you dance with me  
I'm sitting in the dirt  
Baby won't you dance with me!
