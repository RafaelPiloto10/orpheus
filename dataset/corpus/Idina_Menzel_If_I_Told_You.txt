If I told you that I lie sometimes,  
If I told you that I'd run away,  
If I told you who I was before,  
Would you follow me?  
  
If I told you that I sneak sometimes,  
If I told you that I love too much,  
If I showed you the other side,  
Would you follow me?  
  
Cause I'm shedding my skin  
So you can see my face,  
I need you to know who I am.  
I'm ready to go where I've never been,  
Will you stay around and follow me?  
  
Yeah  
If I told you the earth was square,  
If I told you water wasn't wet,  
If I told you life was fair,  
Would you follow me?  
  
Oh  
Cause I'm shedding my skin  
So you can see my face,  
I need you to know who I am.  
I'm ready to go where I've never been,  
Will you stay around and follow me?  
  
To the furthest moon and back,  
Jupiter and Mars and all that,  
To the middle of a galaxy,  
On the smallest raft  
I don't know if I can be sure  
Of anything I believed before  
Will you follow me?  
  
Cause I'm shedding my skin  
So you can see my face,  
I need you to know who I am.  
I'm ready to go where I've never been,  
Will you stay around and follow me?  
  
To the moon and back,  
Jupiter and Mars and all that
