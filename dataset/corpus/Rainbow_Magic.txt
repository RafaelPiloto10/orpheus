There's a light in the sky  
That hangs on the edge of illusion  
Something very fine but it's something  
You know is there  
Mystery of time hidden by a man of confusion  
But the hand is quicker than the eye  
  
Only the stranger knows why  
'Cause it's magic  
You know it's magic that you'll find  
You see it's magic  
I know who you are there's magic in you  
  
Keep your eye on the man  
And don't look away for a moment  
How is it done how does he make me see  
Something up his sleeve when he speaks you want  
To believe him  
  
But the hand is quicker than the eye  
Only stranger knows why  
'Cause it's magic  
Can't you see it's magic that you'll find  
You know it's magic  
I know who you are 'cause there's magic in you  
  
Driven by a force  
Moving in another dimension  
Here for today, gone for eternity  
Seeking for truth  
Hidden by the word of his wisdom  
  
But the hand is quicker than the eye  
Only the stranger knows why  
Can't you feel it's magic  
You know it's magic that you'll find  
I said it's magic  
I know who you are 'cause there's magic in you
