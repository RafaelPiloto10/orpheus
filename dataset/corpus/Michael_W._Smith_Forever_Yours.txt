Give thanks to the Lord, Our God and King  
His love endures forever  
For He is good, He is above all things  
His love endures forever  
Sing praise, sing praise  
  
With a mighty hand and outstretched arm  
His love endures forever  
For the life that's been reborn  
His love endures forever  
Sing praise, sing praise  
Sing praise, sing praise  
  
[Chorus]  
Forever God is faithful  
Forever God is strong  
Forever God is with us  
Forever and ever, forever  
Forever and ever, forever  
  
From the rising to the setting sun  
His love endures forever  
And by the grace of God we will carry on  
His love endures forever  
Sing praise, sing praise  
Sing praise, sing praise  
  
[Chorus]  
  
His love endures forever  
His love endures forever  
His love endures forever  
His love endures forever  
His love endures forever  
His love endures forever  
His love endures forever  
His love endures forever  
  
Sing praise, sing praise  
Sing praise, sing praise  
  
[Chorus]
