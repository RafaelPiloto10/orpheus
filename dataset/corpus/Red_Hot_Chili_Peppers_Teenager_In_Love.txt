Each time we have a quarrel  
It almost breaks my heart  
'Cause I'm so afraid  
That we will have to part  
Each night I ask the stars up above  
Why must I be a teenager in love?  
One day, I feel so happy  
Next day, I feel so sad  
I guess, I'll learn to take  
The good with the bad  
'Cause each night  
I ask the stars up above  
Why must I be a teenager in love?  
I cried a tear for nobody but you  
I'll be a lonely one  
If you should say we're through  
Well, if you want to make me cry  
That won't be so hard to do  
If you should say goodbye  
I'll still go on loving you  
Each night I ask the stars up above  
Why must I be a teenager in love?  
I cried a tear for nobody but you  
I'll be a lonely one  
If you should say we're through  
Well, if you want to make me cry  
That won't be so hard to do  
And if you should say goodbye  
I'll still go on loving you  
Each night I ask the stars up above  
Why must I be a teenager in love?  
Why must I be a teenager in love?  
Why must I be a teenager in love?  
Why must I be a teenager in love?
