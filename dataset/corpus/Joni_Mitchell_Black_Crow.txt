There's a crow flying  
Black and ragged  
Tree to tree  
He's black as the highway that's leading me  
Now he's diving down  
To pick up on something shiny  
I feel like that black crow  
Flying  
In a blue sky  
  
I took a ferry to the highway  
Then I drove to a pontoon plane  
I took a plane to a taxi  
And a taxi to a train  
I've been traveling so long  
How's I ever going to know my home  
When I see it again  
I'm like a black crow flying  
In a blue, blue sky  
  
In search of love and music  
My whole life has been  
Illumination  
Corruption  
And diving, diving, diving, diving.  
Diving down to pick up on every shiny thing  
Just like that black crow flying  
In a blue sky  
  
I looked at the morning  
After being up all night  
I looked at my haggard face in the bathroom light  
I looked out the window  
And I saw that ragged soul take flight  
I saw a back crow flying  
In a blue sky  
Oh I'm like a black crow flying  
In a blue sky
