Words and music by greg allman  
I got to run to keep from hidin'  
And I'm bound to keep on ridin'  
I got one more silver dollar  
But I'm not gonna let them catch  
The midnight rider  
I got only the clothes I'm wearin'  
And the road goes on forever  
I got one more silver dollar  
And I'm not gonna let them catch  
The midnight rider  
I own all the clothes I'm wearin'  
Some old bed I'll soon be sharin'  
Got me one more silver dollar  
And I'm not gonna let them catch  
The midnight rider  
Not gonna let 'em catch me  
Not gonna let 'em catch me  
Not gonna let 'em catch me  
Not gonna let 'em catch me  
Not gonna let 'em catch me  
Not gonna let 'em catch me  
Not gonna let 'em catch me  
Not gonna let 'em catch me  
Come on  
Keep on riding  
Keep on riding  
Keep on riding  
Midnight, midnight rider
