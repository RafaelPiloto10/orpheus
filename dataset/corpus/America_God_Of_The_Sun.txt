God of the sun  
Don't make me wait till the morning comes  
Light in the sky  
Look me in the eye, eye, eye, eye  
  
Don't, keep me waiting around  
Too much longer now  
Don't, don't keep me waiting around, around, around, around  
  
When I called you from my river of darkness  
An echo was all that came back  
Saw you wave goodbye  
Down the railroad track  
Sometimes when you're out and all alone  
And you can't find your way back  
Wonder if you'll ever make it home  
  
God of the sun  
I'll be around till the day's begun  
One sight of your ray  
Takes the night away, away, away, away  
  
Oh, but when I walk through that door  
Take my hat and my coat off waiting for you to call  
I tell you not right now, lady, I got work on my mind  
And I'll talk to you soon  
Always remember  
  
When I called you from my river of darkness  
An echo was all that came back  
I saw you wave goodbye  
Down the railroad track  
Sometimes when you're out and all alone  
And you can't find your way back  
Wonder if we'll ever make it home  
No more
