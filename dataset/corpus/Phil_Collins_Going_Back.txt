I think I'm goin' back  
To the things I learned so well in my youth  
I think I'm returning to  
Those days when I was young enough to know the truth  
  
Now there are no games to only pass the time  
No more electric trains, no more trees to climb  
But thinking young and growing older is no sin  
And I can play the game of life to win  
  
I can recall a time  
When I wasn't ashamed to reach out to a friend  
Now, I think I've got  
A lot more than just my toys to lend  
  
Now there's more to do than watch my sailboat glide  
But every day can be a magic carpet ride  
A little bit of courage is all we lack  
So catch me if you can, I'm goin' back
