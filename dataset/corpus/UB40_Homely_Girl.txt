It must have broke your poor little heart  
When the boys used to say,  
You looked better in the dark.  
But now they'd give all they learnt in school  
To be somewhere in the dark with you  
  
The teacher would ask the questions  
And you, would always raise your hand  
But somehow you never got your turn  
And my eyes would fill with water, inside I'd burn  
  
[Chorus]  
Homely girl, you used to be so lonely  
You're a beautiful woman oh yes you are  
Homely girl you used to be so lonely  
You're a beautiful woman oh yeah  
  
There was a boy who used to sit beside you  
Who'd like to hold that place his whole life through  
Ooh you were beautiful to me  
You had a heart no one could ever see, oh yes you did  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Homely girl, you used to be so lonely  
You're a beautiful woman oh homely girl  
  
I was the only one who offered  
To carry your books  
Took all the stares and laughter  
And the dirty looks  
Cause I saw then what they see now  
They all want to ask you for a date  
They don't know how, they don't know how  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Homely girl, you used to be so lonely  
You're a beautiful woman oh yeah  
Homely girl you used to be so lonely  
You're a beautiful woman, ooh yea, ooh hoo  
You're a beautiful woman
