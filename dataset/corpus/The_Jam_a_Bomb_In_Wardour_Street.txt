Where the streets are paved with blood  
With cataclysmic overtones  
Fear and hate linger in the air  
A strictly no-go deadly zone  
I don't know what I'm doing here  
'Cause it's not my scene at all  
There's an 'A' bomb in Wardour Street  
They've called in the Army, they've called in the police to  
  
I'm stranded on the vortex floor  
My head's been kicked in and blood's started to pour  
Through the haze I can see my girl  
Fifteen geezers got her pinned to the door  
I try to reach her but fall back to the floor  
'A' bomb in Wardour Street  
It's blown up the West End, now it's spreading throughout the City  
  
'A' bomb in Wardour Street, it's blown up the City  
Now it's spreading through the country  
  
Law and order take a turn for the worst  
In the shape of a size 10 boot  
Rape and murder throughout the land  
And they tell you that you're still a free man  
If this is freedom I don't understand  
'Cause it seems like madness to me  
'A' bomb in Wardour Street, Hate Bomb  
Hate Bomb, Hate Bomb, Hate Bomb  
  
A Phillistine nation, of degradation  
And hate and war. There must be more  
It's Doctor Martin's A,P,O,see,A,L,why,P,S,E,  
Apocalypse!
