Somebody lookin' for the answer,  
Somebody dyin' to cut a deal  
Somebody got a cure to cancer,  
Somebody drunk behind the wheel  
But me, I'm just tryin' to find my little Suzie  
  
Somebody bustin' illegal aliens,  
Somebody burnin' Hollywood  
Somebody tryin' to shoot the president,  
Someone abused and misunderstood  
But, me, I'm just holding up a sign for little Suzie  
  
Somebody reachin' out for Jesus,  
Somebody lookin' for a sign  
Somebody said they spotted Elvis,  
He was healin' the sick and leadin' the blind  
But me, I'm just tryin' to make some time for my little Suzie  
Yeah me, I'm sneakin' up behind, don't you hear me say  
  
I won't surrender, I will survive, so help me Jesus  
We'll be together until the end of all space and time  
  
Everybody's got an infomercial,  
Everybody's psychic on the phone  
Somebody had a sex change reversal,  
Somebody thinks nobody knows  
Somebody cryin' out for justice,  
Somebody shootin' someone's kid  
Somebody caught the perpetrator,  
Somebody swears they never did  
But me, I'm just makin' time for my little Suzie  
Yeah me, I'm playin' my guitar for my little Suzie  
  
The world is gonna turn from here until doomsday  
But I don't give a damn long as I've got little Suzie  
  
I won't surrender, I will survive, so help me Jesus  
We'll be together until the end of all space and time  
  
Somebody's awaiting execution,  
Somebody's dyin' to pull the switch  
Somebody cries another martyr,  
Somebody screams "fry the son of a bitch"  
But me, I'm just spending time with little Suzie  
Yeah me, I'm playing my guitar for little Suzie  
Oh me, I'm safe in the arms of little Suzie
