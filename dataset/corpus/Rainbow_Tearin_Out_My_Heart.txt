First time I saw your face  
By your side was the place  
That I would wanna be  
Sometimes and I don't know why  
Love can come or it can pass you by  
Now you take all the love you gave to me  
(you take it from me)  
You're tearin' out my heart  
Oh  
Never thought I'd see the day  
You would throw my love away  
And oh, it's killing me  
One thing you'll never know  
How it hurts to let you go  
As you turn and walk away from me  
(walk away)  
You're tearin' out my heart  
Feel like I been ripped apart  
You're tearin' out my heart  
  
Daybreaks I try to be free  
But your memory is haunting me  
Oh , there's nothing I can do  
All alone in the candlelight  
I see your face again tonight  
And I feel all the emptiness without you  
(without you) tearin' out my heart  
Oh, I feel like I been ripped apart  
Tearin' out my heart  
Whoa, my heart
