My Fine feathered friend with your cute little pranks,  
I would like to express my thanks  
I trusted you implicitly  
But What a double-crosser you turned out to be  
  
Stupid Cupid You're a real mean guy  
I'd like to clip your wings so you can't fly  
I'm in love and it's a crying shame  
and I know that you're the one to blame  
Hey Hey Set me Free  
Stupid Cupid stop picking on me  
  
I can't do my homework and I can't think straight  
I meet her every morning bout half past eight  
I'm acting like a lovesick fool  
You've even got me carrying your books to school  
Hey Hey Set me Free  
Stupid Cupid stop picking on me  
  
You messed me up for good right from the very start  
Hey now, go play Robin Hood with somebody else's heart  
You got me jumping like a crazy clown  
and I don't feature what your putting down  
Well since I kissed her loving lips of wine  
the thing that bothers me is that I like it fine  
Stupid Cupid stop picking on me  
Hey Hey set me free  
Stupid Cupid stop picking on me  
  
You got me jumping like a crazy clown  
and I don't feature what your putting down  
Hey since I kissed her loving lips of wine  
the thing that bothers me is that I like it fine  
Hey Hey set me free  
Stupid Cupid stop picking on me
