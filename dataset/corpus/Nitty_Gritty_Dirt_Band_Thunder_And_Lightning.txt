I remember our first night together  
It was rainin' cats and dogs, when we made love  
Made the most of all that stormy weather  
That's what this ol' night reminds me of  
  
Thunder and lightning  
Nothing like a storm  
Cozy up beside me honey  
And let me keep you warm  
Nothing more invitin'  
Then a good one comin' down  
Born two rainy day lovers  
Who love to hear the sound  
Of thunder and lightning  
  
The rhythm of the rain outside the window  
Always brings a sparkle to your eye  
It's music to my ears each time the wind blows  
We know how to spend a stormy night  
  
Chorus  
  
No, we don't need no sunny day-ay  
Just turn the lights down low  
And let it rain  
  
Chorus
