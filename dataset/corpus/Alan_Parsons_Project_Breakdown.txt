I break down in the middle and lose my thread  
No one can understand a word that I say  
When I break down just a little and lose my head  
Nothing I try to do can work the same way  
  
Any time it happens I'd get over it  
With a little help from all my friends  
Anybody else could see what's wrong with me  
But they walk away and just pretend  
  
When I break down  
  
I break down in the middle and lose my thread  
No one can understand a word that I say  
When I break down just a little and lose my head  
Nothing I try to do can work the same way  
  
Where are all the friends who used to talk to me  
All they ever told me was good news  
People that I've never seen are kind to me  
Is it any wonder I'm confused  
  
When I break down  
When I break down  
  
Freedom, freedom, we will not obey  
Freedom, freedom, take the wall away  
Freedom, freedom, we will not obey  
Freedom, freedom, take them all away  
  
Where are all of my friends  
My so called friends  
Take the wall away  
Take them all away  
Will somebody here me?
