Oh, grandpa wore his suit to dinner nearly every day  
No particular reason, he just dressed that way  
Brown necktie with a matching vest and both his wingtip shoes  
He built a closet on our back porch and put a penny in a burned-out fuse  
  
[Chorus]  
Grandpa was a carpenter, he built houses, stores and banks  
Chain-smoked camel cigarettes, and hammered nails in planks  
He would level on the level, he shaved even every door  
And voted for Eisenhower, cause Lincoln won the war  
  
Well, he used to sing me "blood on the saddle" and rock me on his knee  
And let me listen to the radio before we got TV  
Well, he'd drive to church on Sunday and he'd take me with him too  
Stained glass in every window, hearing aids in every pew  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, my grandma was a teacher, she went to school in bowling green  
Traded in a milking cow for a singer sewing machine  
Well, she called her husband "mister," and she walked real tall and proud  
She used to buy me comic books after grandpa died  
  
[Chorus]
