Holy water on the brain  
And I'm losing sleep  
Holy bible on the night stand  
Next to me  
As I'm raped by another  
Monkey circus freak  
Trying to take my  
Indigence away from me  
  
Holy water is rusting me  
Bloody murder is the best  
I've heard her scream  
Holy devil in the flesh  
Some might believe  
And they take thine  
Majesty so seriously  
It's the big lies  
That are more likely to be believed  
  
Holy water is rusting me  
Damn the water if it's life  
You want to drink  
Mind your mother if  
It makes you feel at ease  
As you're raped by another  
Monkey circus freak  
It's the big lies that are  
More likely to be believed
