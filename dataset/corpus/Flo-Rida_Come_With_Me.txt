I met a lot of women on the road  
I'm piping this world wide and everyone knows her  
But something about her makes wanna slow it  
Spin the one more time I like that she has a mind on her  
I gotta get her won't stop till I got her  
She focus she goes to school she works from ten to two, hey  
Cause shawtys , cause shawtys, 'cause shawtys fly  
I could use someone like you by my side  
As long as you're a rider, a rider,  
I can know you down  
Baby are you down  
So you should get to know me, little momma  
So tell me what it's gonna be, little momma  
Hop in the ride, in the passenger side  
I'll show you just how to roll  
Come kick it with me tonight  
Don't be afraid, everything is all right  
Na na na na  
  
She wanna come with me, little momma, wanna  
But do we have enough and do you wanna ride tonight?  
  
The perfect situation for us both, 'cause surely you  
Just tell me what you need and it's a go  
I love the fact that you're fine so movie girl can we drive through  
Put off the pedal like you  
Wanna make you to won, get freaky under the sun  
That body, that body, that body's right  
We can get straight to every night  
  
As long as you're a rider, a rider,

So tell me what it's gonna be, little momma  
  
Hop in the ride, in the passenger side  
I'll show you just how to roll  
Come kick it with me tonight  
Don't be afraid, everything is all right  
Na na na na

But do we have enough and do you wanna ride tonight?
