I know exactly how you feel  
You were this close to closing deals  
When everything fell from out your hands  
You were forced to decide on other plans now  
You figured it best to just ignore it  
Otherwise you're only living for it  
And if anyone ever wondered why you did it  
You'd swear they never knew you sold your soul to the  
Burning, burning, burning, burning bridges  
  
You know exactly what I want so  
I don't have to be so damn upfront  
No matter the moment we decide to make our minds up  
I know a man who may need a new assignment  
To hand in his heart and take his last vacation  
Attempting to spoil imagination  
If anyone ever wonders where he went  
I wouldn't say that he spent his time driving over  
Burning, burning, burning bridges  
  
Burning, burning which is  
Nothing more than a longing for being uninvolved  
Uninvolved  
Uninvolved  
Uninvolved  
  
Oh, desire can cause heart attacks  
Oh, desire can cause heart attacks  
Oh, desire can cause heart attacks  
Oh, desire, it won't bring you back
