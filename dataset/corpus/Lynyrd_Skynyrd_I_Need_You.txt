Ain't no need to worry  
There ain't no use to cry  
'Cause I'll be comin' home soon  
To keep you satisfied  
You know I get so lonely  
That I feel I can't go on  
And it feels so good inside, babe  
Just to call you on the telephone, I said  
  
Ooh baby, I love you  
What more can I say?  
Ooh baby, I need you  
I miss you more every day  
  
I woke up early this mornin'  
And the sun came shining down  
And it found me wishin' and hopin'  
Mama you could be around  
For you know I need you  
More than the air I breathe  
And I guess I'm just tryin' to tell you, woman  
Oh, what you mean to me, yeah yeah  
  
Ooh baby, I love you  
What more can I say?  
Ooh baby, I need you  
I miss you more every day  
  
I'm tryin' to tell you I love you  
In each and every way  
I'm tryin' to tell you I need you  
Much more than a piece of lay  
  
Ooh baby, I love you  
What more can I say?  
Ooh baby, I need you  
I miss you more every day  
  
Ooh baby I love you  
What more can I say  
Oh baby I need your sweet lovin'  
I miss you more, more every day  
  
Oh baby I love you  
Baby, bay I need you
