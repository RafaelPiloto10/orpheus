Salome, uncross your heart  
I know what goes on inside, it's over before it starts  
Stay all night, yeah I'll wait right here  
The full moon might work magic, girl but I won't disappear  
  
And I'm tired of makin' friends and I'm tired of makin' time  
And I'm sick to death of love and I'm sick to death of tryin'  
And it's easier for you, oh it's easier for you  
And it's easier for you, it's easier for you  
  
Salome, untie my hands  
Well I'll find another lady and you'll wreck another man  
It's over now, yeah and so are we  
My blood's turned to dirt, girl you broke every part of me  
  
And I'm tired of makin' friends and I'm tired of makin' time  
And I'm sick to death of love and I'm sick to death of tryin'  
And it's easier for you, oh it's easier for you  
And it's easier for you, oh it's easier  
  
And I'm tired of makin' friends and I'm tired of makin' time  
And I'm sick to death of love and I'm sick to death of tryin'  
And it's easier for you, yeah it's easier for you  
And it's easier for you, oh it's easier for you  
And it's easier for you, oh it's easier for you, oh
