[Chorus]  
Riddle me who, riddle me why, answer me this,  
Who owns the chains that bind your wrists?  
Riddle me who, riddle me why, answer me this,  
Who built the machine that washed your brain?  
Like parents did before them  
Your parents did the same  
They said do your best, you must pass the test  
You must learn to play the game  
They scrimped and saved and suffered  
To send you off to school  
But if they'd had the cash they could've bought the class  
And a different set of rules  
  
Riddle me who, riddle me why, answer me this,  
Who owns the chains that bind your wrists?  
Riddle me who, riddle me why, answer me this,  
Who built the machine that washed your brain?  
  
They taught a simple system  
Why they had and you had not  
They said know your place, you can't win the race  
Life's an auction you're the lot  
If you'd ever thought to question  
They would never answer why  
When they buy your sweat, your are in their debt  
And they own you till you die  
  
Riddle me who, riddle me why, answer me this,  
Who owns the chains that bind your wrists?  
Riddle me who, riddle me why, answer me this,  
Who built the machine that washed your brain?  
  
You took hook line and sinker  
Everything they fed  
Worked day and night, for most your life  
To earn their daily bread  
Now you're old and weary,  
And you lay you down to sleep  
With body worn and spirit torn  
What's left is yours to keep  
  
Riddle me who, riddle me why, answer me this,  
Who owns the chains that bind your wrists?  
Riddle me who, riddle me why, answer me this,  
Who built the machine that washed your brain?
