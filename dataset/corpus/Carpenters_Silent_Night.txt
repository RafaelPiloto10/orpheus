Silent Night  
Holy Night  
All is calm  
All is bright  
Round your virgin  
Mother and child  
Holy infant so tender and mild  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
  
Silent Night  
Holy Night  
All is calm and bright  
Glories stream from heaven afar  
Heavenly hosts sing alleluia  
Christ the Savior is born  
Christ the Savior is born  
  
Silent Night  
Holy Night  
Son of God  
Love's pure light  
Radiant beams from thy holy face  
With the down of redeeming grace  
Jesus, Lord at thy birth  
Jesus, Lord at thy birth
