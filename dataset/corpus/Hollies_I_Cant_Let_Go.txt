Oh I tried and I tried but I can't say good-bye  
Feel so bad baby  
Oh it hurts me  
When I think of how you love and desert me  
I'm the broken-hearted toy you play with  
You got me goin'  
I need you baby  
I can't let go  
And I want you baby  
I gotta have all your love  
I can't let go  
Though I'm just one of your lovers  
And I know there are so many others  
You do something strange to me baby  
You got me goin'  
I need you baby  
I can't let go  
And I want you baby  
I gotta have all your love  
I can't let go  
Oh I tried and I tried but I can't say good-bye  
I know that it's wrong and I should be so strong  
But the thought of you gone  
Makes me want to hold on  
You got me goin'  
I need you baby  
I can't let go  
And I want you baby  
I gotta have all your love  
I can't let go  
You got me goin'  
I need you baby  
I can't let go  
And I want you baby  
I gotta have all your love  
I can't let go  
I can't let go
