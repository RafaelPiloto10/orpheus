You said I'm stubborn and I never give in  
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening  
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that  
I think you're giving out in way too much in fact  
I say we've only known each other a year  
You say I've known you longer my dear  
You like to be so close, I like to be alone  
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor  
Walking with each other,  
Think we'll never match at all, but we do  
But we do, but we do, but we do  
  
I thought I knew myself, somehow you know me more  
I've never known this, never before  
You're the first to make up whenever we argue  
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know you  
You're so provocative, I'm so conservative  
You're so adventurous, I'm so very cautious, combining  
You think we would and we do,  
But we do, but we do, but we do  
  
Favoritism ain't my thing but,  
In this situation I'll be glad  
  
Favoritism ain't my thing but,  
In this situation I'll be glad to make an exception
