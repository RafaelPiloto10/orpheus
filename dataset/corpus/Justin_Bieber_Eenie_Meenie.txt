Eenie meenie miney mo  
Catch a bad chick by her toe  
If she holla (if, if, if she holla) let her go  
  
She's indecisive  
She can't decide  
She keeps on lookin'  
From left to right  
  
Girl, come a bit closer  
Look in my eyes  
Searchin' is so wrong  
I'm Mr. Right  
  
You seem like the type  
To love 'em and leave 'em  
And disappear right after this song  
So give me the night  
To show you, hold you  
Don't leave me out here dancin' alone  
  
You can't make up your mind, mind, mind, mind, mind  
Please don't waste my time, time, time, time, time  
I'm not tryin' to rewind, wind, wind, wind, wind  
I wish our hearts could come together as one  
  
'Cause shawty is a eenie meenie miney mo lova  
Shawty is a eenie meenie miney mo lova  
Shawty is a eenie meenie miney mo lova  
Shawty is a eenie meenie miney mo lova  
  
Let me show you what your missin'  
Paradise  
With me you're winning girl  
You don't have to roll the dice  
Tell me what you're really here for  
Them other guys?  
I can see right through you  
  
You seem like the type  
To love 'em and leave 'em  
And disappear right after the song  
So give me the night  
To show you, hold you  
Don't leave me out here dancin' alone  
  
Can't make up your mind, mind, mind, mind, mind  
Please don't waste my time, time, time, time, time  
Not tryin' to rewind, wind, wind, wind, wind  
I wish our hearts could come together as one
