Out here in the fields, I fight for my meals  
I get my back into my living  
I don't need to fight, to prove I'm right  
I don't need to be forgiven  
  
Don't cry, don't raise your eye  
It's only teenage wasteland  
  
Sally, take my hand  
Well travel south, 'cross land  
Put out the fire and don't look past my shoulder  
  
The exodus is here  
The happy ones are near  
Let's get together before we get much older  
  
Teenage wasteland  
It's only teenage wasteland  
Teenage wasteland  
(it's only) teenage wasteland  
  
They're all wasted!
