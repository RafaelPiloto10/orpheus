Let me tell you a story from way back,  
Truck on down and dig me, Jack,  
There's Big Moe, little biddy Moe, four eyed Moe, No Moe,  
Look at brother, look at brother, look at brother,  
Eat Moe!  
  
Who's the greatest band around,  
Makes the cats jump up and down,  
Who's the talk of rhythm town,  
Five guy's named Moe, that's us!  
  
When they start to beat it out,  
Everybody jumps and shouts,  
Tell me who the critics all rave about,  
Five guys named Moe.  
  
We came out of nowhere,  
And that don't mean a thing,  
We rate high and you'll know why,  
When you hear us sing, sing, sing, sing, sing.  
  
High brow, low brow, they all agree,  
We're the best in harmony,  
I'm telling you folks, you really ought to see,  
Five guys named Moe.  
  
We came out of nowhere,  
And that don't mean a thing,  
We rate high and you'll know why,  
When you hear us sing  
  
We're the greatest band around,  
Make the cats jump up and down,  
We're the talk of rhythm town,  
Five guy's named Moe.  
  
Not one guy, No Moe,  
Not two guys, little biddy Moe,  
Not three guy's, four eyed Moe,  
Not four guys, Big Moe,  
But five guys, eat Moe,  
Five little guys named Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe,  
That's us!
