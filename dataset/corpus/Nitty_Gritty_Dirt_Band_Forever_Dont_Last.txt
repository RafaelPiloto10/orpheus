(Here we go)  
  
Same these days, I think about her  
Dream up ways to live with out her  
We made vows that I can not excuse  
Yes forever don't last the way it used too  
  
We filled the church and hired a preacher  
I raised her veil to reach her  
Lives on the promise of her youth  
But forever don't last the way it used too  
  
Eternity can not be messed with  
The law says you might confess to  
Enough coals, hotter hell you fool  
Then you swear an oath and then take it back, anytime you choose  
That forever don't last the way it used too  
  
Hammers, razors fill the trash  
You throw'em out when you use the last  
Get a new form son, don't become confused  
If forever don't last the way it used to  
  
Forever don't last, forever don't last  
Forever don't last, forever don't last the way it used too  
Forever don't last, forever don't last  
Forever don't last, forever don't last
