You say you love me  
I say I love you  
So why don't you stop your cryin'  
Dry your weeping eyes  
You know I love you  
Baby, here I am,  
Come rub it on my belly  
Like Guava Jelly  
Baby, here I am,  
Come rub it on my belly  
Like Guava Jelly  
You say you need me  
I say I need you too  
So why don't you stop your cryin'  
Dry your weeping eyes  
You know I love you  
Baby, here I am,  
Come rub it on my belly  
Like Guava Jelly  
Baby, here I am,  
Come rub it on my belly  
Like Guava Jelly  
Ooh rub it baby (repeated to  
Background voices)  
Ooh Rub it over me?.  
(Chorus in background)  
Keep rubbin' on my belly (X2)  
Rub it Rub Rub it?  
Ooh rub it on my belly  
Keep rubbin on my belly (fade)
