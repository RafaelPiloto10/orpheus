Like a melody that is impossible to play away  
In my memory there's a part of you that's gone away  
To keep my mind from wondering  
I'm wondering  
To keep myself on falling  
I'm following  
  
[Chorus]  
Something Anything just to keep on living  
Just to keep on breathing for a moment longer  
Something Anything just to keep on living  
Just to keep on breathing for a moment longer  
  
I'd tell you anything if I had anything to say ehh  
I keep a battle in 'cause there's a time and there's a place for this  
I keep my story where it is  
An act this it  
Don't even all wanna this  
When all I need is  
  
[Chorus]
