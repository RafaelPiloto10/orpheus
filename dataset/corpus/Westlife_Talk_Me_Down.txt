I'm too tired to go to bed  
I'm too wired for anything except  
The crossfire in my head  
It's been a long night  
Cos I took all I can take  
Til the walls shook and the windows break  
I want to phone you but it's far too late  
It's been a long night  
  
So talk me down  
Talk me down  
Talk me down  
Talk me down  
  
Cos we fought an endless war  
Til we forgot what we were fighting for  
Now we can't stop  
But we can withdraw  
In the long night  
  
So talk me down  
Talk me down  
Talk me down  
Talk me down  
  
The light flashed and I thought I'd died  
My life passed before my eyes  
It went too fast for the love I feel  
Inside  
  
So talk me down  
Talk me down  
Talk me down  
Talk me down  
  
Down, down, down  
  
Lay your head near mine  
Tell me that it's all fine  
Love me while there's still time  
It's been a long night
