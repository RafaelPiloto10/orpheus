Wake up ! There's a new day dawning  
I think I'll take a little walk for a while  
I need shades 'cause the sun is blinding  
And I can see for miles and miles  
Then I can feel the earth beneath me  
I lie down we are as one  
And they look but they cannot find me  
I'm off heading for the sun  
  
I'm getting colder  
I feel a chill the air  
There's a change in the weather  
Here it comes again  
Now I can feel the rain  
  
The wind that brings on the change  
Is taking me over  
The wind that brings on the rain  
Is making me older  
  
Downtown the moon is shining  
I'm gonna dress me up in style  
My business everybody's minding  
I need to get away for a while  
  
I'm getting colder  
I feel a chill the air  
There's a change in the weather  
Here it comes again  
Now I can feel the rain  
  
The wind that brings on the change  
Is taking me over  
The wind that brings on the rain  
Is making me older
