I was waiting for something  
I was listening to my breathing  
Like a man listening to life  
  
I was looking for fire  
It could take me or leave me  
It could all just burn away  
  
The oxygen law  
It remains me  
  
I'd been surrounded for hours  
By the sound of thinking metal  
And I knew something was wrong  
  
I can tell you what fear is  
It is the smell of burning  
And I'd been close once before  
  
I waited a long time  
How I survived God only knows  
It seemed like forever  
How I survived God only knows  
I don't like the memory  
How I survived God only knows  
How I survived God only knows  
  
I remember the feeling  
I'll remember forever  
How it all just came apart  
  
I don't believe in praying  
I don't believe in a God  
Now I question everything  
  
The dreamer is gone  
I'm an old man  
  
I could tell you of horror  
I could show you the pieces  
But I just want to forget  
  
I'm not sure if I saw it  
I'm not sure if I heard it  
I just screamed 'I can't get out'  
'I can't get out'
