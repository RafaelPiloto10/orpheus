Meat Loaf feat. Cher - Dead Ringer For Love  
  
Meatloaf: Every night I grab some money and I go down to the bar  
I got my buddies and a beer, I got a dream, I need a car  
You got me begging on my knees, c'mon and throw the dog a bone  
A man he doesn't live by rock 'n roll and brew alone  
Baby baby, baby baby  
  
Rock 'n roll and brew, rock 'n roll and brew  
They don't mean a thing when I compare 'em next to you  
Rock 'n roll and brew, rock 'n roll and brew  
I know that you and I we got better things to do  
I don't know who you are or what you do, or where you go when you're not
around  
I don't know anything about you baby, but you're everything I'm dreaming of  
I don't know who you are, but you're a real dead ringer for love  
A real dead ringer for love  
  
Cher: Ever since I can remember you been hanging 'round this joint  
You been trying to look away but now you finally got the point  
I don't have to know your name and I won't tell you what to do  
But a girl she doesn't live by only rock 'n roll and brew  
Baby baby, baby baby  
  
Cher and Meatloaf: Rock 'n roll and brew, rock 'n roll and brew  
They don't mean a thing when I compare 'em next to you  
Rock 'n roll and brew, rock 'n roll and brew  
I know that you and I we got better things to do  
I don't know who you are or what you do, or where you go when you're not
around  
I don't know anything about you baby, but you're everything I'm dreaming of  
I don't know who you are, but you're a real dead ringer for love  
A real dead ringer for love  
  
Meatloaf: Ooh you got the kind of legs that do more than walk  
Cher: I don't have to listen to your whimpering talk  
Meatloaf: Listen you got the kind of eyes that do more than see  
Cher: You got a lotta nerve to come on to me  
Meatloaf: You got the kind of lips that do more than drink  
Cher: You got the kind of mind that does less than think  
But since I'm feeling kinda lonely and my defenses are low  
Why don't we give it a shot and get it ready to go  
I'm looking for anonymous and fleeting satisfaction  
I want to tell my daddy I'll be missing in action  
Ever since I can remember I've been hanging 'round this joint  
My daddy never noticed, now he'll finally get the point  
Meatloaf: You got me beggin' on my knees, c'mon and throw the dog a bone  
A man he doesn't live by rock 'n roll and brew alone  
Baby baby, baby, baby  
  
Cher and Meatloaf: Rock 'n roll and brew, rock 'n roll and brew  
I know that you and I we got better things to do  
Rock 'n roll and brew, rock 'n roll and brew  
They don? T mean a thing when I compare? Em next to you  
I don't know who you are or what you do, or where you go when you're not
around  
I don't know anything about you baby, but you're everything I'm dreaming of  
I don't know who you are, but you're a real dead ringer for love  
A real dead ringer for love  
  
Dead ringer for love  
Dead ringer
