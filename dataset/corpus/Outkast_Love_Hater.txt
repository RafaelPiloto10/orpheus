Everybody needs a glass of water today to chase the hate away  
You know you've got company coming over, so you scrub extra hard  
And everybody needs somebody to love before it's too late...it's too late  
Don't nobody want to grow older, right?  
Everybody needs someone to rub their shoulders, scratch their dandruff  
And everybody needs to quit actin' hard and shit  
Before you get your ass whooped (I'll slap the fuck outta ya!)  
Everybody needs somebody to love before it's too late...it's too late  
  
Love Hater, Love Hater  
Hater of Love  
Love Hater, Love Hater  
Hater of Love  
Love Hater  
Everybody needs someone to love [Repeat: x2]
