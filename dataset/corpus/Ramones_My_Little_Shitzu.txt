Verse 1:  
I bought a little dog from my local pet shop  
He prances around with a little white mop  
I don't think he's an animal I can afford  
Everyday I take him surfin on his little surfboard  
  
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah (x2)  
  
Verse 2:  
He's pickin up dogs and he's givin them licks  
He's always gettin me a lot of chicks  
I don't think he's an animal I can afford  
Everyday I take him surfin on his little surfboard  
  
Chorus:  
My dog, is well, he's doin mighty fine  
My dog, is swell, he's all mine  
My dog, is good, he's swingin through the vine  
My dog, really should, stop pretending he's a porcupine  
  
Verse 3:  
The wee little puppy never passes on a meal  
One time I ran him over on my car's rear wheel  
I don't think he's an animal I can afford  
Everyday I take him surfin on his little surfboard  
  
Chorus:  
My dog, is well, he's doin mighty fine  
My dog, is swell, he's all mine  
My dog, is good, he's swingin through the vine  
My dog, really should, stop pretending he's a porcupine  
  
Bridge:  
If he doesn't get his act together  
I'll be in really deep shit  
If I can't pay for kibble  
I'll have to morgage my house a bit  
  
Chorus:  
My dog, is well, he's doin mighty fine  
My dog, is swell, he's all mine  
My dog, is good, he's swingin through the vine  
My dog, really should, stop pretending he's a porcupine  
  
My dog, is well, he's doin mighty fine  
My dog, is swell, he's all mine  
My dog, is good, he's swingin through the vine  
My dog, really should, stop pretending he's a porcupine
