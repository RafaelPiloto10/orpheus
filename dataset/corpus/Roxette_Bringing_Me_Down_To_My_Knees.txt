Been thinking about you  
Without even trying, I've done it  
There's something about you  
I can't put my finger on it  
Monday was fine and I was on a high  
  
I'm begging you please to ease, allow your feelings to show, oh oh  
You're bringing me down to my kneesw 'cause I love you so  
  
If your love is strong I want to be sure about it  
Oh is it all wrong to go on talking about it?  
  
Oh you thrilled me  
I should be alright but Friday I died when you killed me  
You're bringing me down to my knees, oh oh  
Love me forever or baby, just let it go, oh oh  
  
Monday was fine, yea the hours went by like a summer breeze  
But way down the line you might make up your mind and it's time to freeze  
You're bringing me down to my knees  
I've been thinking about you
