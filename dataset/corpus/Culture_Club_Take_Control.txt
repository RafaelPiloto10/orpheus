No defeat  
Your dance is sweet  
'Cause you ripped it from my soul  
I'll kiss you  
And we will throw a view  
It's the only way to take control  
  
Boy I'm sweet  
When you've got me beat  
I can't turn it  
I feel cold  
It's for you, that my love is true  
Got to blind a boy  
To take control  
  
[Chorus:]  
Take control (Take it)  
Take control (Take it)  
Take control (Take it)  
Take control  
  
I was there  
But you didn't care  
And I know  
You're using me  
(If it's true get the best of you)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Take control (God would let this thing go)[Repeat: x3]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Take control (God would let this thing go)[Repeat: x3]  
  
No defeat  
Your dance is sweet  
'Cause you ripped it from my soul  
I'll kiss you  
And we will throw a view  
It's the only way to take control.
