I'm not in your town to stay said a lady old and gray  
To the warden of the penitentiary  
I'm not in your town to stay and I'll soon be on my way  
I'm just here to get my baby out of jail  
Yes, warden, I'm just here to get my baby out of jail  
  
I've tried to raiser my baby right, I have prayed both day and night  
That he'd never follow the footsteps of his dad  
I have searched both far and wide, I had feared that he had died  
And at last I find my baby here in jail  
Yes, warden, but it's good to find my baby here in jail  
  
I will pawn you my watch, I will pawn you my chain  
I will pawn you my gold diamond ring  
I will wash all your clothes, I will scrub all your floors  
If that will get my baby out of jail  
Yes, warden, you know I want my baby out of jail  
  
Then I heard the warden say to the lady old and gray  
I will send your baby boy to your side  
Those wide gates swung wide apart, she held her darling to her heart  
She kissed her darling boy and then she died  
But smiling in the arms of her boy there she died
