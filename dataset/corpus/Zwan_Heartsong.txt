come in  
make yourself at home  
i'm a bit late  
hate to make you wait  
  
but heart songs  
are still on my mind  
there's never the time  
to write down these lines  
  
how can you say  
that i don't need you  
just be sure  
no more, no less  
let love confess to you  
what you must do  
  
come on  
let's hit the road  
i'm up to my tricks  
i know they seem cold  
  
but heart songs  
are all that i am  
i use the same words  
to say the same things  
  
how can you say  
that i don't need you  
just be sure  
no more, no less  
let love confess to you  
what you must do  
  
how can you say  
that i don't need you  
just be sure  
no more, no less  
let love confess to you  
no less
