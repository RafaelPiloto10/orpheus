Haha, today was a good day  
Sometimes I just get on my knees you know what I mean  
And pray to the man with the master plan  
  
[Verse 1: Ice Cube]  
Lord have mercy, my people so thirsty  
Come feed 'em, either Jesus or Mohammad  
All we get is vomit, come like a comet  
Put it in my brain Lord, put it in my stomach  
Only you can do it, I'ma learn from it  
Do what I gotta do, try not to plum it  
America used to shoot like reptiles  
Don't worry tomorrow, let's get this right now  
They wanna run us in the ground  
Educate yourself, before they dumb you down  
Get your money boy, the legal way  
Beat 'em with they own bullshit if you may  
Now rich white men they got the world fucked up  
Why should I give a fuck about a Styrofoam cup  
Environmental saying, but if I go green  
You know what I mean bitch  
  
[Chorus]  
Take me away from these people [Repeat: x4]  
  
[Verse 2: Ice Cube]  
Ice Cube for President, let's just do it for the hell of it  
See how I run the government  
Make money irrelevant  
I might tell a chick, it's illegal to resell of it  
Secret service don't know where the hell I went  
Sorry yall, I had to fuck a super delicate  
Dream ticket, Ice Cube and Obama  
American dream, Ice Cube and yo mama  
The Terminator, are you Sarah Conner?  
Arnold Schwarzenegger, can kill who he wanna  
In California, they strap you to a jury  
And murder your ass, in front of your attorney  
Do you really wanna take this journey?  
And scared of none of yall, motherfuckers like Bernie  
Mad step back, I got the mac 11  
Unlike Obama, I'ma have to back my Reverend  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
Now the Lord is my Sheppard  
My flow is respected, world wide  
In the west I got to rep it  
So please check it, cause my style is infected  
With the virus, Ice Cube's the ocyeros  
I bailed through, they wanna put up in bail view  
Cause my point of view is not red, white and blue  
It's black and blue residue  
I know what crack can do, to a whole fuckin' avenue  
Spit on it, and they'll get mad at you  
You know I do this bullshit for your gratitude  
I'ma nigga with a attitude  
I'ma do what I gotta do, just to change my latitude  
In the system, rollin' with my diamonds glistening  
And niggas listenin', from your local prison  
I'ma prism, your only vision is a rainbow in the sky  
When I spit the ism  
  
[Chorus]
