Miles from nowhere  
I guess I'll take my time  
Oh yeah, to reach there  
  
Look up at the mountain  
I have to climb  
Oh yeah, to reach there.  
  
Lord my body has been a good friend  
But I won't need it when I reach the end  
  
Miles from nowhere  
I guess I'll take my time  
Oh yeah, to reach there  
  
I creep through the valleys  
And I grope through the woods  
'Cause I know when I find it my honey  
It's gonna make me feel good, yes  
  
I love everything  
So don't it make you feel sad  
'Cause I'll drink to you, my baby  
I'll think to that, I'll think to that.  
  
Miles from nowhere  
Not a soul in sight  
Oh yeah, but it's alright  
  
I have my freedom  
I can make my own rules  
Oh yes, the ones that I choose  
  
Lord my body has been a good friend  
But I won't need it when I reach the end  
  
I love everything  
So don't it make you feel sad  
'Cause I'll drink to you, my baby  
I'll think to that, I'll think to that.  
Oh yeah  
  
Miles from nowhere  
Guess I'll take my time  
Oh yeah, to reach there.
