You always come around this time of year with your big ole bag that's full of
christmas cheer  
And when it starts to snow the little boys and girls all know soon they'll
hear the sound of your reindeer  
  
Now sometimes grownups grow up to believe that you don't really come on  
Christmas eve  
But I don't think that's true 'cause I know I see you in sparking little eyes  
Around the tree  
  
Oh santa claus, I still believe in you  
And there's still a kid inside of me that still believes you're true  
Oh santa claus, the kids are tucked in tight  
And it's time to play ole santa clause tonight  
  
Well I don't see how anybody could ever doubt that there's really a santa  
Clause.  
Not if they've ever seen a little girl with her arms wrapped around her baby  
Doll, so tight both of 'em waking up mama and daddy way before daylight  
And grandma and grandpa are looking young and full of life, just knowin' that  
Their grandkids are gonna be alright  
And mama and daddy, they'll be waitin' up to answer ole santa's call.  
"cause tonight they ain't worried about the bills- lord they're just lovin'  
It all  
  
Oh santa claus, I still believe in you  
And there's still a kid inside of me that still believes you're true  
Oh santa claus, the kids are tucked in tight  
And i'll be waiting up for you tonight  
Ho-ho-ho
