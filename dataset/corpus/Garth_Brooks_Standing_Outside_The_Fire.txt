We call them cool  
Those hearts that have no scars to show  
The ones that never do let go  
And risk it the tables being turned  
  
We call them fools  
Who have to dance within the flame  
Who chance the sorrow and the shame  
That always come with getting burned  
  
But you got to be tough when consumed by desire  
'Cause it's not enough just to stand outside the fire  
We call them strong  
Those who can face this world alone  
Who seem to get by on their own  
Those who will never take the fall  
  
We call them weak  
Who are unable to resist  
The slightest chance love might exist  
And for that forsake it all  
  
They're so hell bent on giving, walking a wire  
Convinced it's not living if you stand outside the fire  
  
[Chorus:]  
Standing outside the fire  
Standing outside the fire  
Life is not tried it is merely survived  
If you're standing outside the fire  
  
There's this love that is burning  
Deep in my soul  
Constantly yearning to get out of control  
Wanting to fly higher and higher  
I can't abide standing outside the fire  
  
[Chorus x2]
