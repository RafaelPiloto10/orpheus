(Dolly Parton)  
Without a love to call my own my life was incomplete  
It seems I couldn't help but think that love was not for me  
But my life took on a different twist when I met me a man that I couldn't
resist  
I didn't know what all I'd missed, and I'm a gettin' happy  
Oh, I'm a gettin' happy  
Yeah, I'm a gettin' happy - all my lonely days are gone  
I'm a gettin' happy - no more lonely nights alone  
I got someone to call my own and now my life is like a song  
And he helps me sing along - I'm a gettin' happy  
Oh, I'm a gettin' happy  
Oh, people used to talk of love and I couldn't understand  
About the fire and the desire in lovin' a good man  
Oh, but now I know just what they meant since I met me a man that was Heaven
sent  
Wonder where the sadness went, cause I'm a gettin' happy  
Oh, I'm a gettin' happy  
I'm a gettin' happy - all my lonely days are gone  
I'm a gettin' happy - no more lonely nights alone  
I got someone to call my own and now my life is like a song  
And he helps me sing along - an' I'm a gettin' happy  
Oh, I'm a gettin' happy - whoo!  
Yeah, I'm gettin' happy - all my lonely days are gone  
I'm a gettin' happy - no more lonely nights alone  
I got someone to call my own, now my life is like a song  
Got someone to sing along and I'm a gettin' happy  
Oh, I'm a gettin' happy  
Hey, hey I'm a gettin' happy - all my lonely days are gone  
I'm a gettin' happy - no more lonely nights alone  
'Cause I'm a gettin' happy
