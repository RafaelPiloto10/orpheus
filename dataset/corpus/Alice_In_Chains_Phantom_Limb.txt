No hope of rescue  
I'm trapped here alone  
If I don't dig my own way out, I'll die here  
  
Gave my loyalty too soon  
Now the forked-tongue piper's bill is due  
  
Weather is shifting  
So cold, going numb  
Through a pinhole of light, I see vultures circling  
  
Bottom feeders pick my skin  
Weathered brain a parasite within  
  
Ego pulverized  
No better medicine  
Angels have been advised  
Don't want no requiem  
  
I'll just haunt you like a phantom limb  
I'll just haunt you like a phantom limb  
Gonna wear you like a second skin  
I'll haunt you like a phantom limb  
  
Every new second  
Getting harder to breathe  
No matter which side I end up on, this ain't over  
  
My regrets are many, true  
Still so much worse lies ahead for you  
  
Ego pulverized  
No better medicine  
Angels have been advised  
Don't want no requiem  
  
I'll just haunt you like a phantom limb  
I'll just haunt you like a phantom limb  
Gonna wear you like a second skin  
I'll haunt you like a phantom limb
