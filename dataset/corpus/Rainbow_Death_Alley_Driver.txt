Rough and ready rider  
In a supersonic sound machine  
Rock and Roll survivor  
Chrome pipes between your knees  
Running all the red lites  
Your gonna make a dead stop  
But you just can't see the signs  
Oh - you'll never win the race  
But you can't give up the chase  
Death alley driver  
Living at high speed  
Death alley driver...Yeah  
Death alley driver...who knows what you need  
Death alley driver...  
One hundred twenty five smokin' on the turns  
Always on the hit and run  
But you never learn...  
Running from the man... and you're running  
From yourself  
Another dirty angel heading straight to hell  
Oh - you'll never win the race  
But you won't give up the chase  
Death alley driver...  
Live in overdrive...Death alley driver...yeah  
Death alley driver...ride to stay alive  
Death alley driver...  
let's go  
Red lights in the mirror  
Danger on the band  
Got to take a detour cause a road block's up ahead  
He takes you on the corner with a wave of his hand  
Death is in the back seat of a big old black sedan  
Oh - you'll never win the race...  
As you turn and see his face...  
Death alley driver...  
Movin' for the kill  
Death alley driver...yeah  
Death alley driver...  
Time is standing still...  
Death alley driver...  
Always on the run cause you're a...  
Death alley driver  
Love the way it feels  
Death alley driver...yeah  
Death alley driver  
Hell on wheels...  
Death alley driver... ooh -
