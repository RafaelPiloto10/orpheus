feat. Cody Simpson  
  
I don't work hard when it's easy  
I put in work when it's hard  
Girl they never believed in love until I had yours  
This is more than a season  
And I'm not just sprung  
I'm not afraid to tell you that you're the one  
But when I wake up thinking 'bout  
The one that I can run to when I'm feeling down  
Life is so good when you're around  
Girl nobody from the past is beating you right now  
Cause I'll take you home to mama, let you meet my friends  
Cause you don't come with drama  
So I want you till the world ends  
You're way more than worth it  
But I don't feel like I deserve it  
You got the pieces  
You're my kind of perfect
