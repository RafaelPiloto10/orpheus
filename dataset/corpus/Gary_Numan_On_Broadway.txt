They say that  
Neon lights are bright on broadway  
They say there's always magic in the air  
But when you're walking down the street  
And you aint had enough to eat  
The city all lights up and you're nowhere  
  
They say  
The girls are something else on broadway  
Looking at them just gives me the blues  
Cause howre you gonna make some time  
When all you got is one thin dime  
And one thin dime wont even shine your shoes  
  
They say that  
Love wont last too long on broadway  
Now catch a greyhound bus for home  
They all say  
I bet they're wrong, I know they are  
Cause I can play this here guitar  
And I wont quit till I'm a star  
On broadway
