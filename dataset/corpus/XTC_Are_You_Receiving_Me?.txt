Are you receiving me?  
You are deceiving me I know, see I know  
  
When we're out walking  
Your mouth ain't where it's supposed to do the talking  
When we're in kissing  
Your lips are missing, are they out on loan to someone else  
Are you listening?  
  
I put it in a letter, what could be better?  
I put it in a note, one night I wrote  
I put it in a telegram, just like the son of Sam  
Babe there's something missing  
Your TV's just hissing
