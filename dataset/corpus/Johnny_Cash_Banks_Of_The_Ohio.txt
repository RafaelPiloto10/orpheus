I asked my love to take a walk  
Take a walk just a little ways  
And as we walked, along we talk  
All would be our wedding day  
And only say that you'll be mine  
In no others arms entwined  
Down beside where the waters flow  
Down by the banks of the Ohio  
I asked her if she'd marry me  
And my wife forever be  
She only turned her head away  
And had no other words to say  
And only say that you'll be mine  
In no others arms entwined  
Down beside where the waters flow  
Down by the banks of the Ohio  
I plunged a knife into her breast  
And told her she was going to rest  
She cried "Oh Willy, don't murder me  
I'm not prepared for eternity"  
I took her by her golden curls  
And drug her down to the river side  
And there I threw her into drown  
And I watched her as she floated down  
And only say that you'll be mine  
In no others arms entwined  
Down beside where the waters flow  
Down by the banks of the Ohio  
And going home between twelve and one  
I cried "Oh Lord, what have I've done?"  
I've killed the only girl I love  
Because she would not marry me  
And only say that you'll be mine  
In no others arms entwined  
Down beside where the waters flow  
Down by the banks of the Ohio
