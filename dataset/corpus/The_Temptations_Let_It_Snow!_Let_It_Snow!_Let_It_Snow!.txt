Oh the weather outside is frightful  
But the fire is so delightful  
And since we've no place to go  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
And it doesn't show signs of stopping  
And I've brought some corn for popping  
The lights are turned way down low  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
When we finally kiss goodnight  
How I'll hate going out in the storm  
But if you really hold me tight  
All the way home I'll be warm  
  
And the fire is slowly dying  
And my dear is still goodbyeing  
But as long as you love me so  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
And the fire is slowly dying  
And my dear is still goodbyeing  
But as long as you love me so  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
Let it snow
