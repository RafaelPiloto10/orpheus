Another day and more bad news  
I wonder who died today  
I feel so numb I might as well be dead  
  
I live on hope and legal dope  
Addicted to the system  
Is it real or does it just live within my head  
  
I guess they lied to make me feel afraid  
I can't believe a single word they say  
  
Cry another tear  
'Cause the devil will not wait  
Living in fear  
Why do people love to hate  
Love to hate  
  
Desensitized and victimized  
The action never stops  
Could it be a smokescreen to keep us satisfied  
  
Insecure and paranoid  
I'm trying to survive  
I can't tell if I'm hearing truth or lies  
  
I'll never make it to the Holy Gates  
No ones gonna matter, the fire of hell awaits  
  
Cry another tear  
'Cause the devil will not wait  
Living in fear  
Why do people love to hate
