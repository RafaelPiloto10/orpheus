Well its an open road  
And its full of life  
But it stops somewhere  
'Cause time keeps ticking away  
Let me tell you about a boy  
An average spud  
He was twice in love  
With two very different girls  
Knowing life was short  
He told them both the truth  
But they already knew  
Now he's a happy guy  
Well its a random turn  
On a game show wheel  
And it stops somewhere  
'Cause time keeps ticking away  
Let me tell you about a man  
A tragic case  
Love kicked in his face  
He shriveled up and died  
From a broken heard  
Reincarnated as a work of art  
He's got a brand new start  
Hey!  
Now he's a happy guy
