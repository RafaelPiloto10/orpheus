Long night, it's a long night, my friend  
The barrooms and the back street's dead end  
Sometimes I thought I saw the sunrise and good times in the air  
It was just, it was just another big town with midnight's neon glare  
  
Long night, it's a long night, I know  
The bus rides and the "nowhere to go"  
  
I've seen what the street corners do to things like love and dreams  
Seen what the bottle can do to a man with his hopes and his schemes  
  
A long night, what a long night it has been  
The wheelers and the dealers, they win  
I've tasted the 90-proof gin and chased it away with the blues  
I rarely paid debts that I owed but I sure have paid my dues  
  
No daylight, just a long night for me
