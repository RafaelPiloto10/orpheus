I heard about a man, walking on the water  
He had hope in his eyes  
He didn't wear a crown or have any money  
He didn't have any lies  
  
He had holes in his pockets  
He had holes in his hands  
He looked like an outlaw talking to his lover  
  
He was a spiritual man  
  
I wanna be a prince, not a king or a warrior  
I wanna have a special light in my eyes  
Wanna climb up a mountain, find a tree of wisdom  
I wanna feel good when I cry  
  
And maybe someday I could be a teacher  
I want that karma when you touch my hand  
I'll walk through the streets,  
Talking to the homeless in winter  
  
I wanna be a spiritual man, yeah  
  
I heard about a man who was born in the desert  
He rode for days and nights across the sand  
And one day, he came upon an angel  
The angel said, "Hey you, you're gonna be a spiritual man!"  
  
Last night I saw a man walking toward a club in Harlem  
He had a black case in his hands  
Went through the back door and pulled out his gold companion  
He closed his eyes and played all night like a self-taught spiritual man
