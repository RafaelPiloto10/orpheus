I've been away for a long while  
The holidays made a change  
Ooh but the bit of me that you revile  
Is diffused in this exchange  
  
I knew you then, you were a good friend  
Swapping books and clothes and things  
Your incessant smile is marred with sin  
But it's strains the happy within  
  
Don't push me fragile friend  
Don't let me down  
I'd snap hard back at you  
And hurt a fragile friend  
Don't let me down  
Don't let me down, yeah yeah yeah  
  
Your fragile friend is desperate  
To learn the tricks of the trade  
To catch up fast with all his friends  
Who left him on parade  
  
This fragile friend isn't perfect  
All the grapes in his mind are going sour  
Learning the rules as he plays it  
How much his smile has the power  
  
Don't push me fragile friend  
Don't let me down  
I'd snap hard back at you  
And hurt a fragile friend  
Don't let me down  
Don't let me down, yeah yeah yeah  
  
Don't push me fragile friend  
Don't let me down  
I'd snap hard back at you  
And hurt a fragile friend  
Don't let me down  
Don't let me down, yeah yeah yeah
