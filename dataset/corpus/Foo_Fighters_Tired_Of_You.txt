I can be your liar  
I can be your bearer of bad news  
Sick and uninspired by  
The diamonds in your fire  
Burning like a flame inside of you  
But is this just desire or the truth?  
  
So shame on me for the ruse  
Shame on me for the blues  
Another one returned that I'll never use  
  
I won't go getting tired of you  
I won't go getting tired of you  
I'm not getting tired  
I won't go getting tired of you  
I won't go getting tired of you  
I'm not getting tired  
  
Hanging on this wire  
Waiting for the day I have to choose  
Cursed by love so dire  
One more boy for hire  
One more boy to lend a hand to you  
But it is this just desire or the truth?  
  
So shame on me for the ruse  
Shame on me for the blues  
Another one returned that I'll never use  
  
I won't go getting tired of you  
I won't go getting tired of you  
I'm not getting tired  
I won't go getting tired of you  
I won't go getting tired of you  
I'm not getting tired  
Of you  
Of you  
  
I can be your liar  
I can be your bearer of bad news  
Sick and uninspired by  
The diamonds in your fire  
Burning like a flame inside of you  
Is this just desire or the truth?  
  
So shame on me for the ruse  
Shame on me for the blues  
Another one returned that I'll never use  
  
I won't go getting tired of you  
I won't go getting tired of you  
I'm not getting tired  
I won't go getting tired of you  
I won't go getting tired of you  
I'm not getting tired  
Of you
