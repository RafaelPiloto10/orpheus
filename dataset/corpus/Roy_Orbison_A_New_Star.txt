The evening sun is falling that old blue moon is calling  
My guardian angel in the sky came through  
To help all my dreams come true there's a new star  
There's a new star coming tonight, there's a new love burning  
So bright for a new star of love is born between the earth and sky  
For you and I  
  
There's a new star  
The moon was dull, the sky was cold and gray  
There were no stars to light my lonely way  
And then I traced the love-light in your eyes  
To a new star twinkling in the sky burning bright, day and night  
Now I'm alright, now we're together, lovers forever  
A new star, a new star to light our way  
There's a new star burning for us, there's a new world turning for us  
There's a new star sparkling in the sky  
  
There's a new star shining somewhere and we know the reason why  
There's a new star way up there for a true love  
A new star for our love will never die
