It's wonderful to look into your eyes  
And realize you care a little bit  
It's wonderful to know that you love me, babe  
  
It's glorious to feel that  
I'm a part of you, sweetheart  
To share your happiness  
It's marvelous how lovely love can be  
  
Who dreamed that I'd be allowed  
Through the doorway of Heaven  
I'm drifting high on a cloud  
You're an angel and this is Heaven, mama  
  
It's wonderful to have  
Your lips divine combined with mine  
And dream forever more  
It's wonderful to know that you love me  
Oh, babe, you love me too
