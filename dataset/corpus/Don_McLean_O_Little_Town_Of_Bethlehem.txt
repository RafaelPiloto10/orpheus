O little town of Bethlehem  
How still we see thee lie  
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep  
The silent stars go by  
  
Yet in thy dark streets shineth  
The everlasting light  
The hopes and fears of all the years  
Are met in thee tonight  
  
For Christ is born of Mary  
And gathered all above  
While mortals sleep, the angels keep  
Their watch of wondering love  
  
O morning stars together  
Proclaim the holy birth  
And praises sing to God the King  
And peace to men on earth  
  
Yet in thy dark streets shineth  
The everlasting light  
The hopes and fears of all the years  
Are met in thee tonight  
  
O holy Child of Bethlehem  
Descend to us we pray  
Cast out our sin and enter in  
Be born in us today  
  
We hear the Christmas Angels  
The great glad tidings see  
For born to us in Bethlehem  
Is Jesus Christ the King  
  
Born to us in Bethlehem  
Is Jesus Christ the King
