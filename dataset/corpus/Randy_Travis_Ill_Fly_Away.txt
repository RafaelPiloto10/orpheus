Some glad morning when this life is o'er  
I'll fly away  
To a home on God's celestial shore  
I'll fly away.  
  
I'll fly away, oh glory,  
I'll fly away  
When I die, hallelujah, by and by  
I'll fly away.  
  
When the shadows of this life grow have grown  
I'll fly away  
Like a bird from prison bars has flown  
I'll fly away.  
  
I'll fly away, oh glory,  
I'll fly away  
When I die, hallelujah, by and by  
I'll fly away.  
  
Just a few more weary days and then  
I'll fly away  
To that land where joy shall never end  
I'll fly away.  
  
I'll fly away, oh glory,  
I'll fly away  
When I die, hallelujah, by and by  
I'll fly away.  
  
I'll fly away, oh glory,  
I'll fly away  
When I die, hallelujah, by and by  
I'll fly away  
  
When I die, hallelujah, by and by
