I remember what my father said  
He said "You don't slow down  
You're gonna end up dead"  
I remember what my brother said  
He said "You're runnin blind  
Like a bird flyin' into the sun"... Yeah  
  
They might be older than me  
But the eyes of the seeker  
Are the ones that see  
  
Old man with a new brown bag  
Washed away his home  
Hung over the nag  
Threw the ring in the river  
At the end of the street  
Then he laid on down in the park  
With the bag at his feet... Yeah  
  
He might think he's really free  
But the eyes of the seeker  
Are the ones that see  
All... All ya'll  
  
Try to push it further  
Than you think your life is worth  
Or you'll get nowhere  
Spendin' all your time with the devil  
Grind... Your mind  
'Stead of sittin home  
Lyin' in your bed  
Sayin you just don't care... Well...  
  
Big Daddy from the back of the cell  
Said "You want to last  
You gotta run like hell"  
But Big Daddy must been runnin' slow  
He told me the view's real good  
From the top of the rope... Yeah  
  
It's overcast with an ill decree  
And the eyes of the seeker  
Are the ones that see
