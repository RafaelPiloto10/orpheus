Wait a minute, I don't want you to know  
Is the only way that I can go  
  
A secret's safe behind a pretty smile  
And it's mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine  
  
What's with all the late night liquor phone calls?  
I don't think your love likes me at all  
  
A secret's safe behind a pretty smile  
But it's mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine  
  
What? What might you do to find out why I can't love you?  
I can't love you!  
  
Oh  
Oh  
  
Who said it was cool to be asking me these questions?  
Your who, what, and where, when and why are making my head spin  
And when was it an option to put your lips upon my lips?  
And how did this happen?  
And why are you laughing?  
And how do I get back together again?  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh  
  
What?  
What might you do?  
And what?  
What might you do?  
To find out why  
To find out why  
I can't love you  
I can't love you  
I can't love you
