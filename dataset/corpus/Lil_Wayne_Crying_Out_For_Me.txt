Uh huh  
Mario  
And Young Weezy baby (Oh)  
So you know that only means one thing  
This the remix baby  
  
[Verse:]-Lil' Wayne  
So I met this shawty the other day  
I got her numba called her up  
Like what you doin' she say nothin  
I say what's good  
She say not much  
I say guess what  
She say what's up  
I say I think we should hook up  
She say uh  
I say what  
She say but  
I say but why you stuck  
She say fuck  
I say who  
She say not you  
I said then who  
She say you know  
I know what  
You know who  
I said I do  
She said you do  
I said I do but I really don't  
Because it's you that I really want  
And we can do what you really want  
Girl we grown and if he ain't gon treat you right  
Then I ain't gon treat you wrong  
That's my word  
And she done heard so many lies  
She don't what's true or not  
Shawty like a valley servers  
I swear she been through a lot  
But I put her car in park  
And never let her cry alone  
I listen to her heart beat  
Because it plays my favorite song  
  
(Chrous)  
I can hear your heart crying out for me (crying out for me)  
I can hear your heart crying out for me  
(And it keeps on saying) Come on in, come on in come on in and save me  
(And it keeps on saying) Come on in, come on in come on in and save me  
(I can baby) I can hear your heart crying out for me  
  
[Verse 2:]-Mario  
Baby, I should've never caught no feelings  
But baby having late night conversion on your sofa  
You telling me how he played you out over and over, over and over  
But I'm stuck in the middle of seeing you hurt  
I know when you love him  
And you wanna make it work  
And I can't help but think that I knew you first  
It's getting louder  
Girl I can't ignore it no more baby  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I don't wanna confuse things (no)  
But I just can't keep lying to myself  
When you're holding me (when you're holding me)  
I can feel your pain oh baby let me be your dream  
I'm the answer come see me (see me)  
And you don't have to cry no more (you don't have to cry)  
  
Girl I can hear your heart baby  
I can hear your heart  
Girl it's crying  
Won't you listen to your heart, baby  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Girl I can hear, hear it cry for me, for me, for me, me, me, me(whoo)  
  
Ladies wave your hands in the air  
Ladies wave your hands in the air  
  
Oh oh baby  
It's crying for me  
It's crying for me for me
