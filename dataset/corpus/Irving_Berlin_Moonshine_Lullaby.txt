Behind the hill  
There's a busy little still  
Where your pappy's workin' in the moonlight  
  
Your lovin' pa  
Isn't quite within the law  
So he's hidin' there behind the hill  
  
Bye bye, baby  
Stop your yawnin'  
Don't cry, baby  
Day will be dawnin'  
  
And when it does  
From the mountain where he was  
He'll be comin' with a jug of moonshine  
  
So count your sheep  
Mama's singin' you to sleep  
With a moonshine lullaby  
  
Dream of pappy  
Very happy  
With his jug of mountain rye  
  
So count your sheep  
Mama's singin' you to sleep  
With a moonshine lullaby
