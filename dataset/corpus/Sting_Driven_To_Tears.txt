How can you say that your not responsible?  
What does it have to do with me?  
What is my reaction?  
What should it be?  
Confronted by this latest atrocity  
Driven to tears  
Driven to tears  
Driven to tears  
  
Hide my face in my hands, shame wells in my throat  
My comfortable existence is reduced  
To a shallow, meaningless party  
Seems that when some innocents die  
All we can offer them is a page in a some magazine  
Too many cam'ras and not enough food  
'Cause this is what we've seen  
Driven to tears  
Driven to tears  
Driven to tears  
  
Protest is futile  
Nothing seems to get through  
What's to become of our world?  
Who knows what to do?  
Driven to tears  
Driven to tears  
Driven to tears  
Driven to tears  
Driven to tears  
Driven to tears
