I'd rather be rich, it sounds a little funny  
If diggin' a ditch would earn me lots of money  
I'd dig like a fool in the land of milk and honey  
Where everything's cool, provided you have money, yeah, yeah, yeah  
I'd rather be rich, just short of being greedy  
I'm eager to switch, to hell with being needy  
I'd rather be rich, the truth of cash is tragic  
The system's a bitch, but money works like magic, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Money makes the world go round  
Buy and sell it by the pound  
Bitter truth that I have found  
Food to eat, shoes on your feet  
Maybe some heat, you live with defeat  
  
Money gets you justice, money sets you free  
Money makes it possible to be or not to be  
Money is the power, money is the key  
Sad and so unfortunate, but real as it can be, yeah, yeah, yeah  
I'd rather be rich, than what the other choice is  
My thumb out to hitch, or riding in Rolls Royces  
'Cause I ain't no fool in the land of milk and honey  
Where everything's cool until you lose your money
