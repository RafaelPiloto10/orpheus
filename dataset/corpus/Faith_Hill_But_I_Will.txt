Remember when I said  
The next time would be the last time  
That time came this mornin'  
When you came in  
  
You always had a line  
To change my mind  
So I guess you thought  
I'd just let you break my heart again  
  
I don't want to stop lovin' you?but I will  
I don't like wakin' up alone?but I will  
You're the only one  
Who can make my heart stand still  
I don't want to let you go?but I will  
  
I could write a book  
On the innocent looks you're giving me  
You've got one for every story you tell  
I've seen it all and I'm not gonna fall  
  
For those make believe tears  
So, darlin' I will try to make it clear  
  
I don't want to stop lovin' you?but I will  
I don't like wakin' up alone?but I will  
You're the only one  
Who can make my heart stand still  
I don't want to let you go but I will  
  
You're the only one who  
Can make my heart stand still  
I don't want to let you go?but I will
