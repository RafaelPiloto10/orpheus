[Verse 1]  
Maybe it was all too much  
Too much for a man to take  
Everything's bound to break  
Sooner or later, sooner or later  
You're all that I can trust  
Facing the darkest days  
Everyone ran away  
But we're gonna stay here, we're gonna stay here  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Ahh, ahh  
I know you're scared tonight  
Ahh, ahh  
I'll never leave your side  
  
[Chorus]  
When it all falls, when it all falls down  
I'll be your fire when the lights go out  
When there's no one, no one else around  
We'll be two souls in a ghost town  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
When the world gets cold, I'll be your cover  
Let's just hold, onto each other  
When it all falls, when it all falls down  
We'll be two souls in a ghost town  
  
[Verse 2]  
Tell me how we got this far  
Every man for himself  
Everything's gone to hell  
We gotta stay strong, we're gonna hold on  
This world has turned to dust  
All we've got left is love  
Might as well start with us  
Singing a new song, something to build on  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Ahh, ahh  
I know you're scared tonight  
Ahh, ahh  
I'll never leave your side  
  
[Chorus]  
When it all falls, when it all falls down  
I'll be your fire when the lights go out  
When there's no one, no one else around  
We'll be two souls in a ghost town  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
When the world gets cold, I'll be your cover  
Let's just hold, onto each other  
When it all falls, when it all falls down  
We'll be two souls in a ghost town  
  
[Bridge]  
I know we're all right, cause we'll never be alone  
In this mad mad, in this mad mad world  
Even with no light, we're gonna shine like gold  
In this mad mad, in this mad mad world  
  
[Chorus]  
When it all falls, when it all falls down  
I'll be your fire when the lights go out  
When there's no one, no one else around  
We'll be two souls in a ghost town  
  
[Chorus]  
When it all falls, when it all falls down  
I'll be your fire when the lights go out  
When there's no one, no one else around  
We'll be two souls in a ghost town  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
When the world gets cold, I'll be your cover  
Let's just hold, onto each other  
When it all falls, when it all falls down  
We'll be two souls in a ghost town  
  
[Outro]  
When it all falls, when it all falls down  
We'll be two souls in a ghost town
