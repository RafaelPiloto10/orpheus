What can this strange device be?  
When I touch it, it gives forth a sound  
It's got wires that vibrate and give music  
What can this thing be that I found?  
See how it sings like a sad heart  
And joyously screams out its pain  
[Incomprehensible] that build high like a mountain  
Or notes that fall gently like rain  
I can't wait to share this new wonder  
The people will all see its light  
Let them all make their own music  
The priests praise my name on this night
