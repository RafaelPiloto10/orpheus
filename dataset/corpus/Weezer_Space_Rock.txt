Ooo-hoo hoo hoo hoo-oo-oo (x 2)  
  
You want to cry  
When you're dealing with the kids  
  
Ooo-hoo hoo hoo hoo-oo-oo (x 2)  
They know it all  
And they're pinning you to boards  
  
It's a game  
And you play  
But you can't have fun  
When all they do is say  
Lies  
  
They know it all  
And they're pinning you to boards  
  
It's a game  
And you play  
But you can't have fun  
Whne all they do is say  
Lies  
Lies
