I watch the cars move, I watch the lights up on the window  
I walk along the street, I'm only thinking of you  
I watch the clock staring from the wall, it hardly moves at all  
It's you I'm waiting for  
Without someone I can depend on  
I'm lost without someone  
As I go on, I hope you're remembering  
I'm lost without someone  
All alone no one around, I watch the shadows falling faster  
The city lights begin to glow and then I start to realize  
I count the hours as they slip away into another day  
Wondering where you'll stay  
Without someone I can depend on  
I'm lost without someone  
As I go on, I hope you're remembering  
I'm lost without someone  
Still watching the cars move, still watching the lights  
Upon the window  
I'm walking down the street, I'm only thinking of you  
I hear the night as it calls to me, it plays a symphony  
It says you're gone from me  
Without someone I can depend on  
I'm lost without someone  
As I go on, I hope you're remembering  
I'm lost without someone
