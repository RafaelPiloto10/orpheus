Tell my ma when I go home,  
The boys won't leave the girls alone,  
They pulled my hair and stole my comb,  
But that's all right 'till I go home.  
She is handsome, she is pretty  
She is the belle of Belfast city,  
She is courting, one two three  
Please won't you tell me who is she?  
  
Albert Mooney says he loves her,  
All the boys are fighting for her,  
Knock on the door and they ring the bell  
Oh my true love, are you well?  
Here she comes, as white as snow,  
Rings on her fingers and bells on her toes,  
Old Jenny Murray she says she'll die  
If she doesn't get the fella with the roving eye.  
  
Tell my ma when I go home,  
The boys won't leave the girls alone,  
They pulled my hair and stole my comb,  
But that's all right 'till I go home.  
She is handsome, she is pretty  
She is the belle of Belfast city,  
She is courting, one two three  
Please won't you tell me who is she?  
  
Let the wind and the rain and the hail blow high  
And the snow come tumbling from the sky  
She's as nice as apple pie  
She'll get her own lad by and by  
When she gets a lad of her own,  
She won't tell her ma 'till she comes home,  
Let the boys stay as they will,  
For it's Albert Mooney she loves still.
