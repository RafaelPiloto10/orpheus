In a mansion high the young man stood  
Ready to join his companions good  
Outside the scent of Magnolia blossoms  
Down streets of gold the children were racin'  
Just another wandering soul  
Adrift among the stars  
Just another human heart  
Led, led away  
He put his shoes on and he laid down  
(Led, led away)  
Outside the clouds were swiftly gathering  
(Don't be led away)  
He drained his cup and his stirred the mixture  
(Led, led away)  
And he closed his eyes as his conscience whispered  
(Don't be led away)  
Just another wandering soul  
Adrift among the stars  
Just another human heart  
Led, led away  
Misgivings unspoken he joined his companions  
(Led, led away)  
His face covered over in a mansion high  
(Don't be led away)  
Outside the children gazed in wonder  
(Led, led away)  
At the quickening sky then slowly disbanded  
(Don't be led away)  
Thirty-nine wandering souls  
Adrift among the stars  
Thirty-nine human hearts  
Led, led away  
His burning skin cooled by angels  
Swallowing sorrows excretion  
It's all excretion  
(Don't be led away)  
(Led, led away)  
Felled by his hand for the mind of another man  
(Don't be led away)  
Who makes the decisions  
Lends no provisions for mere eternal rides  
(Led, led away)  
(Don't be led away)  
Learning of course every alien force  
(Don't be led away)  
Even Christ yearns to be to possess the skin  
(Led, led away)  
And bones of man the blood of man  
(Don't be led away)  
Who tends the flock who breaks the bread  
(Don't be led away)  
(Led, led away)  
Who makes his own choices, won't listen to voices  
(Don't be led away)  
Accept no false teachers, false preachers, good deeders  
(Don't be led away)  
(Led, led away)  
With their hands out stretched to be filled with your money  
(Don't be led away)  
Your flesh, your breath, your imagination  
(Don't be led away)  
(Led, led away)  
Sympathy, empathy  
(Don't be led away)  
Acknowledge all man as fellow creation  
(Don't be led away)  
(Led, led away)  
But don't follow him  
(Don't be led away)  
Don't be led away  
Don't be led away  
(Led, led away)  
Don't be led away  
(Led, led away)  
Don't be led away  
Don't be led away  
Don't be led away
