Bob Marley - I Can See Clearly Now  
  
I can see clearly now, the rain is gone,  
I can see all obstacles in my way  
Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind  
It's gonna be a bright (bright), bright (bright)  
Sun-Shiny day  
It's gonna be a bright (bright), bright (bright)  
Sun-Shiny day  
  
Oh yes I can make it now, the pain is gone  
All of the bad feelings have disappeared  
Here is the rainbow I've been prayin' for  
It's gonna be a bright (bright), bright (bright)  
Sun-Shiny day  
  
Look all around, there's nothin' but blue skies  
Look straight ahead, there's nothin' but blue skies  
  
I can see clearly now, the rain is gone,  
I can see all obstacles in my way  
Here is the rainbow I've been prayin' for  
It's gonna be a bright (bright), bright (bright)  
Sun-Shiny day  
It's gonna be a bright (bright), bright (bright)  
Sun-Shiny day  
Bright (bright), bright (bright)  
Sun-Shiny day  
It's gonna be a bright (bright), bright (bright)  
Sun-Shiny day  
It's gonna be a bright (bright), bright (bright)  
Sun-Shiny day
