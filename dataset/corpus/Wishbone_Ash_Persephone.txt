There's a light that shines on Persephone,  
Always a fire in her eyes,  
And the last time that I went to her  
I could tell things weren't right.  
  
I just don't care to see your years go wasting,  
There's no longer magic in your eyes.  
  
In your time, you could outshine everybody else around,  
But your off-stage ways might be a bore -  
You take a bow, you take a fall.  
  
I came to be here in the footlights,  
To live with you through every song,  
And your face displays a peaceful field.  
I can't believe the curtain has to fall.  
  
Now I know your years were never wasted,  
Tonight I saw the magic in your eyes.
