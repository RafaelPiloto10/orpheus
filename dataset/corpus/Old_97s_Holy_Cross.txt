You work for 37 years  
Drivin' trucks, not shiftin' gears  
He never got it in his head  
To settle down, he'd never wed.  
  
He liked the river how it flowed.  
Unlike the breaker, never to explode.  
It had no wires runnin' in  
It just went on and on and on until the ocean got to it.  
  
Holy Cross  
Electric Association  
Oh well it's more than a job  
It's more like a damnation  
Well it was my life, now it's my loss  
Holy Cross  
  
It was a honey of a night  
He met his maker, he saw the light.  
The car was passin' on a curve  
He never slowed down, he never swerved.  
  
And in the hot glare of the lamps  
He had regrets, he'd never learned to dance.  
There was no angel at his side  
There was a Thermos that became homeless when he died.  
  
Holy Cross  
Electric Association  
Oh well it's more than a job  
It's more like a damnation  
Well it was my life, now it's my loss

Oh well it's more than a job

Holy Cross  
Well it was my life, now it's my loss  
Well it was my life, now it's my loss
