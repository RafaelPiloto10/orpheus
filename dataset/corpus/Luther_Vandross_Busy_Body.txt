I'm so downhearted 'cause what had started  
Out to be love has now dearly departed  
There's no reason for you to be leaving  
I wish you would stay but you're a...  
  
Busy body  
Giving all your lovin' to just anybody  
A Busy body  
Holding, kissing, loving, hugging anybody  
  
If it would have lasted it would have been fantastic  
But when the morning came you were gone  
All your one night standin' must take a lot of plannin'  
But I don't think you'll last for very long  
'Cause you've got a...  
  
All I ever  
Wanted to do was love you, baby  
Gotta believe me  
I'm hopelessly into you  
  
I can hear love calling  
And I can't believe I'm falling  
For somebody  
Who'll never be all mine  
I've got to stop the fire  
I can't let it get no higher  
But, I'm so afraid I'm running out of time  
'Cause you've got a...  
  
Busy body  
Giving all your lovin' to just anybody  
A Busy body  
Holding, kissing, loving, hugging anybody
