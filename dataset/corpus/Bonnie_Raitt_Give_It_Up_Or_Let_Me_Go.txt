Well, I told you pretty baby, such a long time ago,  
If I found you with another, well I'd walk right out your door,  
Woh, you might call me crazy, but there's one thing you should know,  
Oh honey, if you want me to love you,  
You've got to give it up or let me go.  
  
I know it's useless to be jealous, I couldn't tire you if I tried,  
But when I think of you messing behind my back  
It brings a pain I just can't hide.  
Oh baby, I've been true to you.  
And if I can make that sacrifice, honey you can do it too.  
Well, you come home drunk and nasty, you won't tell me where you've been.  
Just when things are nice and sweet, you go back out again.  
Why do you want to mess up a good thing?  
I'm gonna find me another man, one who wants to give me everything.  
  
Well, I told you pretty baby, such a long time ago,

Woh, you might call me crazy, but there's one thing you should know.

You've got to give it up or let me go.
