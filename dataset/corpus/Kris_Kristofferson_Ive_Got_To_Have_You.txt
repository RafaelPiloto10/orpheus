You came smiling softly  
Shyly moving, easy as a dreamer, into my world  
Then before I realized the danger  
I found myself staring into your eyes  
Somewhere in their colors  
I saw promises of things I'd never seen before  
It's all over  
I've got to have you  
Holding onto, talking, saying nothing  
Knowing in a moment I could lose you  
Then without a warning I remember  
That you trembled at the touch of my hand  
Knowing when you came to me that  
No one else would ever feel the same in my arms  
It's all over  
I've got to have you  
Waking in the morning to the  
Tenderness of holding you asleep in my arms  
Dreaming while your hair was blowing  
Softer than a whisper on my cheek  
I don't know the feeling, so I don't know if it's love  
But it's enough, it's enough  
It's all over  
I've got to have you  
I just can't help it, no  
I've got to have you
