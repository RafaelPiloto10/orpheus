"I just want to write you a letter. I have to be very honest with you right
now.  
I don't really know how to say this... "  
  
I wanna believe  
But I'm having a hard time seeing past what I see right now, I see right now  
I wanna be free  
But when I try to fly I realize I don't know how, no one showed me how  
Wish I could see that this mess I'm in will really work out for my good, you
said it would  
So, if you can hear me, can you give me a sign cause I don't feel you like I
should, please if you Could  
My faith is almost gone, I can't hold on much longer, take this cup from me  
  
[Chorus]  
Help me believe  
Can I believe  
Let me believe  
I wanna believe  
I'm no good on my own, please give me another chance  
It's hard to believe in what I can't see  
To give you my will cause you're what's better for  
You can look in my eyes and see I wanna believe, believe, believe, believe  
  
(I want you to know)  
I wanna believe  
If I never hear I'm sorry I can let it go, gotta let you go  
Cause, it's killing me. Jesus you know how it feels cause you've been hurt
before, don't wanna hurt No more  
I'm trying to hear you speak, but my heart is growing weaker, take this cup
from me  
  
Help me believe  
Can I believe  
Let me believe  
I wanna believe  
I've been here before and can't take that hurt again  
It's hard to believe in what I can't see  
To give you my will cause you're what's better for  
You can look in my eyes and see I wanna believe, believe, believe, believe  
  
Believe  
Believe  
  
I wanna believe when I close my eyes on this side I'll wake up with you, more
in love with you  
And, and finally, you will say my race it is over and my work is through,
cause I believed in you  
I know dark nights will come and some days there'll be no sunshine and you're
too far to see  
  
Help me believe  
Can I believe  
Let me believe  
I wanna believe  
I'm no good on my own, please give me another chance  
It's hard to believe in what I can't see  
To give you my will cause you're what's better for  
You can look in my eyes and see I wanna believe, believe, believe, believe
