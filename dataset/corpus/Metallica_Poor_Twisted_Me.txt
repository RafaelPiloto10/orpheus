Oh poor twisted me  
Oh poor twisted me  
I feast on sympathy  
I chew on suffer  
I chew on agony  
And swallow whole the pain  
Oh it's too good to be  
All this misery  
Is just for oh poor twisted me  
Poor twisted me  
Poor mistreated me  
Poor mistreated me  
I drown without a sea  
I'm filled with sorrow  
Once filled with misery  
And hated the deep dark blue  
Such a burden to bear  
Poor mistreated me  
Finally reached the shore  
Survival's gone  
Now your feeling cold ever since he was born  
Your pain is so over you  
Finally reached the shore  
Survival's gone  
Now your feeling cold ever since he was born  
Your pain is so over you  
Could ya be my friend  
Such a pain to see  
Oh poor twisted me
