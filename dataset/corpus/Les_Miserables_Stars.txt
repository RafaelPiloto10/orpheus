[Javert]  
There, out in the darkness  
A fugitive running  
Fallen from God  
Fallen from grace  
God be my witness  
I never shall yield  
Till we come face to face  
Till we come face to face  
  
He knows his way in the dark  
But mine is the way of the Lord  
And those who follow the path of the righteous  
Shall have their reward  
And if they fall as Lucifer fell  
The flame, the sword!  
  
Stars in your multitudes  
Scarce to be counted  
Filling the darkness  
With order and light  
You are the sentinels  
Silent and sure  
Keeping watch in the night  
Keeping watch in the night  
  
You know your place in the sky  
You hold your course and your aim  
And each in your season  
Returns and returns  
And is always the same  
And if you fall as Lucifer fell  
You fall in flame!  
  
And so it must be for so it is written  
On the doorway to paradise  
That those who falter and those who fall  
Must pay the price!  
  
Lord, let me find him  
That I may see him  
Safe behind bars  
I will never rest  
'til then, this I swear!  
This I swear by the stars!  
  
[Gavroche]  
That inspector thinks he's something  
But it's me who runs this town!  
And my theater never closes  
And the curtain's never down  
Trust Gavroche, have no fear  
Don't you worry, auntie dear,  
You can always find me here!
