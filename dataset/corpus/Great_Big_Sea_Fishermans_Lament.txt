I stand in my doorway as the moon rises high  
Over glorious ocean, reflects the bright sky  
My heart it is aching, so much I could die  
I've known only the ocean, since I was a boy  
Chorus:  
And I spent my whole life, out there on the sea  
Some government bastard now takes it from me  
It's not just the fish, they've taken my pride  
I feel so ashamed that I just want to hide  
I fished with my father, so long long ago  
We were proud of our trade, and in us it did show  
We held our heads high, there was lots of fish then  
That was the time, when we were proud men  
We challenged great storms and sometimes we won  
Faced death and disaster, we rose with the sun  
We worked and we toiled, we strained our men brane  
We were a proud people, will we ere be again?  
Chorus  
My father is gone now, and the fish are gone too.  
Abused and mis-managed, oh what can we do?  
I'm too old to change, but what of my sons,  
How will they know that we weren't the ones?  
Dfo regulations permitted the rape  
Of our beautiful ocean, from head land to cape  
They brought in big trollers, they tore up our twine  
Politians don't care for what's yours or what's mine!  
Chorus  
You brave Newfoundlanders, now listen to me  
Shove the package to hell, go back to the sea  
If we don't stand our ground, we will fade away  
And the bones of our fathers will turn into clay  
And I spent my whole life, out there on the sea  
Some government bastard now takes it from me  
It's not just the fish, they've taken my pride  
I feel so ashamed that I just want to die.  
Back to the sea.
