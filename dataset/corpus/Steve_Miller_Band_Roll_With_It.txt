There's a plane goin' down the runway  
Believe I better go with with it  
There's a train goin' by the highway  
Believe I better roll with it  
  
I don't know what's got into me  
All I know is I've got to be free  
Take off all these chains that bind me  
Once I'm gone, you'll never find me  
  
Did she love you  
Mmmm Hmmm  
Did she need you  
Mmmm Hmmm  
  
Did she please you  
Mmmm Hmmm  
Did she leave you  
Mmmm Hmmm  
  
Iiii, Iiii, Iiii, Iiii  
Iiii, Iiii, Iiii, Iiii
