In the dark before the train  
Just beyond the barn glow  
Where no dissident remains  
Driving it like we stole it  
  
Snow falling, a silver poet  
To concentrate the gallows  
And subtracting us like the wolf does  
Driving it like we stole it  
  
But we're getting nearer, nearer  
Getting near that modern spirit, yeah  
I can hear it, hear it, hear it  
I can hear that modern spirit  
  
On the open road for boys  
A white and an open throat  
Night slips back with no noise  
Inside the hitch-hiker's coat  
  
But we're getting nearer, nearer  
Getting near that modern spirit, yeah  
I can hear it, hear it, hear it  
I can hear the modern spirit, yeah  
  
Can't you just hear it, hear it, hear it?  
Winter counting everything, we're near it  
We're getting nearer nearer, nearer  
Friendship changing everything, we're near it  
I can hear it  
  
Is this the modern spirit?  
Is this the modern spirit, yeah  
Is this the modern spirit  
This is the modern spirit, yeah  
This is the modern spirit  
This is the modern spirit, yeah  
This is the modern spirit  
This is the modern spirit, yeah
