She drew out all her money from the Southern Trust  
And put her little boy aboard a greyhound bus  
Leavin' Louisianne for the golden west  
Down came her tears from her happiness  
Her own little some named Johnney B Goode  
Was going to make some motion pictures down in Hollywood  
  
And sing bye bye, bye bye  
Bye bye, bye bye  
Bye bye Johnney, goodebye Johnny B Goode  
  
She remembered taking money in from gathering crops  
And buying Johnny?s guitar from the brokers shop  
As long as he was playing by the railroad side  
Wouldn't get in trouble, she?d be satisfied  
She never thought that there would come a day like this  
When she would have to give her son a goodbye kiss  
  
And sing bye bye, bye bye  
Bye bye, bye bye  
Bye bye Johnney, goodebye Johnny B Goode  
  
She finally got the letter she was dreaming of  
Cos Johnny wrote and told her he had fell in love  
As soon as he was married he would bring her back  
And build a mansion for her by the railroad side  
So every time she heard the locomotive roar  
She be standing,waiting at the kitchen door  
  
And sing bye bye, bye bye  
Bye bye, bye bye  
Bye bye Johnney, goodebye Johnny B Goode
