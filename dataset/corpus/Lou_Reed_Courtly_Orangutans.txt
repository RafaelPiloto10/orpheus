[Hop Frog:]  
Tomorrow is the seasonal ball  
I propose costumes for you  
and the honourable ministers to wear  
[King:]  
Yes  
[Hop Frog:]  
All dress as orangutans  
All your guests will run and scream  
with their mouths agape  
And try to hide  
And you Sire will have last laugh  
For such imperial cunning  
  
[Hop Frog:]  
I will reach, restore wrong  
I will torture you  
I will burn you  
Dead  
[Tripitena:]  
My prince  
My prince  
You light a fire .......  
Burn, monkeys  
Burn
