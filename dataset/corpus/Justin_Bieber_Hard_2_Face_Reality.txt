Sometimes it's hard to face reality  
Even though you might get mad at me  
Sometimes it's hard to face reality  
  
Don't be afraid to stand alone  
Don't be afraid to stand outside all by yourself  
I know it's hard away from home  
It ain't easy all alone  
Relationships over the phone  
Talkin' to your significant other all night long  
  
Sometimes it's hard to face reality  
Even though you might get mad at me  
Sometimes it's hard to face reality  
  
[Pooh Bear]  
Should've been adjusted to my life  
Had the opportunity to stay and wait for the last time  
Now you're standin' right in front of me  
It is mean and though, that life  
Try to protect your feelins  
Givin' in between the lines  
Hope your heart is totally healed and  
  
Sometimes it's hard to face reality  
Even though you might get mad at me  
Sometimes it's hard to face reality
