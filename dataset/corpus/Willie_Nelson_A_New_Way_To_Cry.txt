All my tears have fallen, I can cry no more.  
I've cried so mmuch since you have said goodbye.  
The pressure keeps on building up, within my heart.  
It grows and grows but still, my eyes are dry.  
Though my heart is breakin', tears refuse to start,  
So I've got to find a new way to cry.  
  
I've got to find a new way to relieve the pain.  
It just can't stay, forever, locked inside.  
And until I forget you and can smile again,  
I've got to find a new way to cry.  
  
[Instrumental break]  
  
I've got to find a new way to relieve the pain.  
It just can't stay, forever, locked inside.  
And until I forget you and can smile again,  
I've got to find a new way to cry.
