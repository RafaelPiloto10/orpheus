Why forbidden fruit  
Always looks so sweet  
Hanging down like devil's food  
From highest branch on tree  
  
Yes, woman should be satisfied  
Be happy with her lot  
But sometimes half of him  
Seems better than the whole I've got  
Yes, sometimes half of hell right here  
Is better than a heaven forgot  
  
yield not to temptation  
Is only good advice  
If true love happens just the once  
And never ever twice  
  
Yes, woman should be satisfied  
Be happy with her lot  
But sometimes half of him  
Seems better than the whole I've got  
Yes, sometimes half of hell right here  
Seems better than a heaven forgot  
  
We were happy with happily ever after  
But only if the plot  
Had bad guys we could boo and hiss  
And good guys we could not  
  
We probably feel that second best  
Could actually be much worse  
But you're kind of drawn to chocolate  
When you've tasted wafer first  
Yes, you're kind of drawn to chocolate  
When you've tasted wafer first  
  
Hunt me down like your other prey  
Let your claws take hold  
If what I've chosen's truly gray  
Make tiger black and gold  
  
Yes, woman should be satisfied  
Be happy with her lot  
But sometimes half of him  
Seems better than the whole I've got  
Yes, sometimes half of hell right here  
Is better than a heaven forgot  
  
We were happy with happily ever after  
But only if the plot  
Had bad guys we could boo and hiss  
And good guys we could not  
  
We probably feel that second best  
Could actually be much worse  
But you're kinda drawn to chocolate  
When you've tasted wafer first  
Yes, you're kinda drawn to chocolate  
When you've tasted wafer first  
  
'I can't get no satisfaction'  
So sang all the guys  
The biggest single breeding ground  
For a girls, 'I will survive'  
  
We'll be happy with happily ever after  
But only when the song  
Admits 'can't get no satisfaction'  
Wasn't all our wrong  
  
We probably feel that second best  
Could actually be much worse  
But you're kind of put off wafer  
When you've tasted chocolate first  
Yes, you're kinda put off wafer  
When you've tasted chocolate first  
  
Why forbidden fruit always looks so sweet?
