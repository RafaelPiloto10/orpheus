Softly and tenderly  
Jesus is calling  
Calling for you and for me  
See on the portals  
He's waiting and watching  
Watching for you and for me.  
  
Come home, come home  
Ye who are weary, come home  
Earnestly, tenderly Jesus is calling  
Calling, Oh sinners come home.  
  
Why should we tarry  
When Jesus is pleading  
Pleading for you and for me  
Why should we linger  
And heed not his mercies  
Mercies for you and for me.  
  
Come home, come home  
Ye who are weary, come home  
Earnestly, tenderly Jesus is calling  
Calling, Oh sinners come home.  
  
Come home, come home  
Ye who are weary, come home  
Earnestly, tenderly Jesus is calling  
Calling, Oh sinners come home.  
  
Calling, Oh sinners come home
