I took a long, long trip to the city  
I was determined to get somewhere  
I spent all my hard earned money  
I had saved to put me there  
  
Big bayou where did you go  
To the river that's running slow  
And to the Gulf of Mexico  
Big bayou carry me home  
  
I took a cotton picking job in Memphis  
And the people there treated me good  
But my luck run bad in Nashville  
I had to walked the streets of Hollywood  
  
Big bayou where did you go  
To the river that's running slow  
Into the Gulf of Mexico  
Big bayou carry me home  
  
Oh Lord I'm going home  
Where the fish jump in the air  
You know I don't need a lot of money  
'Cause I ain't going nowhere  
  
Big bayou where did you go  
To the river that's running slow  
Into the Gulf of Mexico  
Big bayou carry me home  
  
Big bayou carry me home  
To the river that's running slow  
Into the Gulf of Mexico  
Big bayou where did you go  
  
I'm gonna catch a southbound  
Train home one of these days
