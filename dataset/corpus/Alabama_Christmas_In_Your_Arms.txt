All my friends are asking me where I plan to spend the holidays  
People seem to celebrate the season in so many different ways  
Some go where the weather's freezing cold while others like it warm  
I don't care about the weather just whether I spend Christmas in your arms  
  
[Chorus:]  
We could drive up to the mountains, build a fire and watch it snow  
We could sail down to the islands where the gentle breezes blow  
I'd be happy in the city, I'd be happy on the farm  
I don't care where I spend Christmas as long as I spend Christmas in your arms  
  
It was only last December I had no Christmas spirit in my heart  
My world lay cold and shattered in the ashes of a dream that fell apart  
But now you're here beside me, no greater gift is wrapped beneath my tree  
And the arms you wrap around me and the precious gift of love you give to me  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't care where I spend Christmas as long as I spend Christmas in your arms
