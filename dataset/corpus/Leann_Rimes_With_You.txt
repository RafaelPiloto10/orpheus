A little stretch of river on a big green field  
The kind you see from airplanes baby, that's the deal, that's the deal  
A place to plan a future, a place to keep the past  
A place to raise some kids, and what's wrong with that, wrong with that  
  
Maybe it's the same routine  
Walking on the concrete  
Running like a river so deep  
Wearin' down my high heels  
Wearin' down my high ideals  
Of what I thought my life was supposed to be  
  
Everybody's got a weakness, some kind of kryptonite wearing 'em down  
Everybody's got dreams they can't let go of, don't they, baby?  
Everybody has a little secret they keep inside and mine's  
Livin' happily ever afterly  
With you, with you  
  
I want to paint the world with the colors that I see  
Every time I close my eyes and you're kissin' me, kissin' me  
I wanna wake up in your arms so far from here  
I wanna get lost in the dark and know you're near, know you're near  
  
Maybe it's an old love song playing up loud on the radio bringin' these
thoughts on  
Getting me thinking that there might be a little bit more than what I'm
working for  
Or maybe it's just me  
  
Everybody's got a weakness, some kind of kryptonite wearing 'em down  
Everybody's got dreams they can't let go of, don't they, baby?  
Everybody has a little secret they keep inside and mine's  
Livin' happily ever afterly  
With you, with you  
  
Everybody's got a weakness  
  
Everybody's got a weakness, some kind of kryptonite wearing 'em down  
Everybody's got dreams they can't let go of, don't they, baby?  
Everybody has a little secret they keep inside and mine's  
Livin' happily ever afterly  
With you, with you  
  
With you
