Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey  
  
Off through the new day's mist I run  
Off from the new day's mist I have come  
I hunt  
Therefore I am  
Harvest the land  
Taking of the fallen lamb  
  
Off through the new day's mist I run  
Off from the new day's mist I have come  
We shift  
Pulsing with the earth  
Company we keep  
Roaming the land while you sleep  
  
Shape shift, nose to the wind  
Shape shift, feeling I've been  
Move swift, all senses clean  
Earth's gift, back to the meaning (back to the meaning) of life  
  
Bright is the moon high in starlight  
Chill is the air cold as steel tonight  
We shift  
Call of the wild  
Fear in your eyes  
It's later than you realized  
  
Shape shift, nose to the wind  
Shape shift, feeling I've been  
Move swift, all senses clean  
Earth's gift. back to the meaning (back to the meaning) of life  
  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey  
  
Got any wolves out there?  
  
I feel I change  
Back to a better day  
(Shape shift) Hair stands on the back of my neck  
(Move swift) In wildness is the preservation of the world  
So seek the wolf and not the man  
  
Shape shift, nose to the wind  
Shape shift, feeling I've been  
Move swift, all senses clean  
Earth's gift  
Back to the meaning (back to the meaning) of wolf and man
