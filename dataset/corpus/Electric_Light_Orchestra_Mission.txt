For many days we travelled from a distant place and time,  
To reach a place they call the planet earth,  
There was to be a celebration,  
On the mission of the sacred heart.  
  
The planet earth from way up there is beautiful and blue  
And floating softly through a rainbow,  
But when you touch down things look different here,  
At the mission of the sacred heart.  
  
Chorus  
Watching all the days roll by  
Who are you and who am i?  
  
On a dirty worn-out sidewalk, sits a mother with a baby,  
In her vale of tears she sees no rainbow  
And someone's singing from a window  
In the mission of the sacred heart.  
  
Chorus -- repeat  
  
There's a building on a corner, in a city, in a land,  
On a place they call the planet earth,  
My orders are to sit here and watch the world go by,  
From the mission of the sacred heart.  
  
Chorus -- repeat
