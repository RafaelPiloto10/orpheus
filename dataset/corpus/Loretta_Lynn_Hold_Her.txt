There's two suitcases hid back in the closet  
Packed for much more than a few days stay  
And in her purse there's several thousand dollars  
Years of saving for one rainy day  
It scares her half to death to think of leaving  
She's never been out on her own before  
Too many nights she's cried while he was sleepin'  
Oh but she's not sure he loves her any more  
  
[Chorus:]  
All he has to do to hold her is to hold her  
Tell her how he feels down deep inside  
All he has to do to hold her is to hold her  
There's no way she would ever leave his side  
  
To him she's always been a special angel  
And so much more than he thought he deserved  
Oh how was she to know all he's been feeling  
When he could never put it into words  
He was so afraid one day she'd walk out on him  
He knows he's just a plain and simple man(Yes he is)  
He could easily tear down that wall between them  
Everything he needs to keep her's in his hands  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Maybe he'll wake up in time  
To hold me
