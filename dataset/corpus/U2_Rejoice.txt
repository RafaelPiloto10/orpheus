It's falling, it's falling  
And outside the buildings  
Are tumbling down  
And inside a child on the ground  
Says he'd do it again  
  
And what am I to do  
What in the world am I to say  
There's nothing else to do  
He says he'll change the world someday  
I rejoice  
  
This morning I fell out of bed  
When I woke up to what he has said  
Everything's crazy  
But I'm too lazy to lie  
  
And what am I to do  
Just tell me what am I supposed to say  
I can't change the world  
But I can change the world in me  
If I rejoice  
Rejoice...  
  
And what am I to do  
Just tell me what am I supposed to say  
I can't change the world  
But I can change the world in me  
If I rejoice  
  
I don't know what to change  
Rejoice...
