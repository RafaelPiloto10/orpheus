Hey boy, don't be shy  
Waiting all alone  
Think about what you can give  
Some boys never learn  
That's the way to live  
And it's the secret  
To getting it right  
  
Living carefully, always filled with doubt  
Scared to make a move too soon  
Just once, take a chance  
She will take one, too  
'Cause that's the secret  
To getting it right  
  
It's not who loves you as how much do you love  
And what's in your heart that shows what you're made of  
You're made of love, hey, boy  
It's all right  
Someone understands  
You don't have so far to go  
Reach out for her hand  
Then you'll really know  
The secret to getting it right  
  
You're made of love, hey, boy  
It's all right  
Someone understands  
You don't have so far to go  
Reach out for her hand  
Then you'll really know  
The secret to getting it right  
  
Reach out, take her hand  
Then you'll really know  
You'll know that you're getting it right  
Yes, you'll know that you're getting it right
