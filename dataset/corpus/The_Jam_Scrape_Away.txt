Your twisted cynicism - makes me feel sick  
Your open disgust for 'idealistic naive'  
You've given up hope you're jaded and ill  
The trouble is your thoughts a catching disease  
Ooh - you need to get away  
Ooh - you need a change of pace  
Because you're all dried up and you don't believe  
You reckon I'm dreaming when I say I still feel real  
You say you work for yourself and its the only way  
But I look at you talking and to me you just scrape away  
What makes once young minds get in this state,  
Is it age or just the social climate  
You're talking like some fucking hardened MP  
You're saying power's all!  
And it's power you need!  
Ooh - you need to get away  
Ooh - you need a change of place  
Because you've given up on hope  
You're emotionless  
You've no need for love it's just hate, hate, hate.  
But I look at you shaking and it is you  
Who is scraping away  
You who is scraping away.
