Tucked away in the darkest cupboard of your heart  
There's a feeling you can't let out  
In a way you are just a soldier of the mind  
You are marching, what are you marching about?  
  
On your mark, now get set  
Get back on your feet  
We ain't down yet  
You know we will get it  
So don't you forget  
That the world rolls on.  
  
Your reward will come  
It's just a question of how and when  
Look around, everyone is wondering where it's at  
Do you wonder, or do you know?  
  
Clap your hands! Raise your voice  
Some people will hide  
They can't stand the noise  
But we're freedom fighters  
And we've got no choice.  
  
In a way you are just a soldier of the mind  
But the world rolls on.  
Your reward will come  
  
And the truth will come and the change will come  
It's just a question of how and when  
I can't believe my eyes.
