Father Time and Mother Love,  
Sit in their house some where up above  
And make us do what they want us to do  
And they made me wanting you.  
  
Father Time with his memory's of you  
And Mother Love with her heart beat so true  
Have brought us back although we were through  
And made me know that I love only you.  
  
Father Time has dimmed my eyes,  
With tears Mother Love placed inside  
When I had missed you all that I could  
They gave me you back to love as I should.  
  
Father Time and Mother Love,  
Sit in their house somewhere up above  
And like puppets and mortals do love  
They guide our hearts where they want them to go.  
  
Father Time and Mother Love  
Will always be in their house up above,  
And Father Time forever will see,  
Mother Love keeps you close to me
