I was young and healthy  
Extremely wealthy  
I swung in the trees  
And did as I pleased  
I thought I was rich  
Oh yeah  
Such sweet seduction  
I could feel the suction  
Greasing my palm  
And doing no harm  
Just making some deals  
What a bitch  
  
Money talks to me  
Whispers in my ear  
Gives me everything I want  
Everything I want  
  
I had rising stock  
So I got more pockets  
I knew somewhere to stick it  
Where no-one would nick it  
I kinda went private  
And then, aha  
Such sweet seclusion  
No more intrusion  
Too much food on my plate  
But there's guards at the gate  
Such joy  
I could almost die of it  
  
Money talks to me  
Lays it on the line  
Gives me everything I want  
Everything I want  
  
Money goes to money  
Yes it always returns  
Finds its way back to the big house  
Where it lives all alone  
Wraith like silent partners  
Operators of the system  
Give words of quiet assurance  
To an otherwise healthy victim  
  
It's all coming back to me  
I would swing in the trees  
And I'd swim in the ocean  
I used to show some emotion  
  
I was not to blame  
I feel no shame  
The structure was shaking  
Was there for the taking  
I had the resources  
But then, oh no  
Someone outbid me  
I can't take it with me?  
Then I will devour it  
I can't go without it  
It's simply a question of  
Market forces  
  
Money talks to me  
Whispers in my ear  
Gives me everything I want  
Everything I want  
Money talks to me  
Laughs right in my face  
Gives me everything I want  
Everything I want
