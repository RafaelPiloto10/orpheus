Touche, touche  
You're right, there's nothin' I can say  
I am a wishy, washy girl  
But it's a wishy, washy world  
  
Go away  
No, wait a minute  
I want out  
Then I want in it  
I'm all confused but I admit it  
Go away  
No, wait a minute  
  
Ces la vie, la vie  
That's what you get when you get me  
Have the right to change my mind  
At least a couple hundred times  
  
Go away  
No, wait a minute  
I want out  
Then I want in it  
I'm all confused but I admit it  
Go away  
No, wait a minute  
  
I need some help  
I'm not quite myself  
And lately I'm a nervous wreck  
My whole world has changed  
And the reason I'm strange  
Is I love you and baby that scares me to death  
  
Go away  
No, wait a minute  
I want out  
Then I want in it  
I'm all confused but I admit it  
Go away  
No, wait a minute  
  
I'm all confused but I admit it  
Go away  
No, wait a minute
