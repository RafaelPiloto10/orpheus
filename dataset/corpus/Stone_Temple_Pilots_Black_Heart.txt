Black heart's comin', he?s a cold machine  
Cuts like a knife, gentle and clean  
Face like an angel, mind of a killer  
Nobody else gonna love her better  
  
Lay down now stay down  
Took her life with a quick pull trigger  
  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Well I don?t mind, I don?t mind  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Said I don?t mind if you don?t mind  
  
The color is all but faded  
Out of a dead man's eyes  
Down to his blackened heart  
  
Black heart's kickin' like a beating drum  
Shooting her down the sound of his gun  
No compassion, hard as an assassin  
Falling deeper still in that reckless fashion  
  
Lay down now stay down  
Deeper and deeper with a blind man's passion  
  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Well I don?t mind, I don?t mind  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Said I don?t mind if you don?t mind  
  
The color is all but faded  
Out of a dead mans eyes  
Down to his blackened heart  
  
Rescue me  
(If you don?t mind)  
[x3]  
  
If you don't mind  
The color is all but faded  
Out of a dead man's eyes  
Down to his blackened heart  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
