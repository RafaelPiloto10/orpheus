Well I got a little girl and she's got a daddy  
Who's got a lotta money and it makes me happy  
To follow them around like a little whipped puppy dog  
Well she's my honey but he's my sugar dad  
This country boy ain't doin' too bad  
Livin' high on someone else's hog  
  
Well, I'm livin' high on someone else's hog  
I sit around all day like a twenty-four karat  
Bump on a golden log  
Well I traded that rusty ol' GMC  
Gotta long black Cadillac limousine  
I'm a livin' high on someone else's hog  
  
Well this redneck boy from a blue-collar town  
Has really moved up since he got tied down  
I got a brand new life and I owe it to my daddy-in-law  
Well he gave me a so-called executive position  
Now I get up early every day and go fishin'  
I'm a livin' high on someone else's hog  
  
Well, I'm livin' high on someone else's hog  
I sit around all day like a twenty-four karat  
Bump on a golden log  
Well I traded that rusty ol' GMC  
Gotta long black Cadillac limousine  
I'm a livin' high on someone else's hog  
  
Well, I'm livin' high on someone else's hog  
I sit around all day like a twenty-four karat  
Bump on a golden log  
Well I traded that rusty ol' GMC  
Gotta long black Cadillac limousine  
I'm a livin' high on someone else's hog  
  
Well I traded that rusty ol' GMC  
Gotta long black Cadillac limousine  
I'm a livin' high on someone else's hog
