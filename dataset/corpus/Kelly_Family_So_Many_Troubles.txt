To find in me the seed of love  
You gave to me from high above  
To rest in you and you in me  
To find the truth and not to hide  
To feel the way beneath the sun  
To hear your voice and be your song  
  
So many troubles, so many troubles  
  
Through greedy pride and noisy hide  
Through hocus pocus rock 'n' roll  
Through spinal tap and ugly fights  
And rollercoaster beauty tips  
Mm... Mm... Mm  
Through Peter Pan and pretty fans  
Through sticks and stones and broken bones  
Chicken freaks mountain and freaks  
Through ups 'n' downs 'n' ups 'n' downs  
Through ugly pimps and ugly chicks  
And ugly forms  
Through fakes... Through summer warms  
And ugly worms  
Through ugly freaks and cheaky tricks  
  
So many troubles, so many troubles  
  
Here I am, here I come  
Hold my hand one  
More time one more try  
One more try  
  
Sing it  
So many troubles, so many troubles  
So many troubles, so many troubles oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh  
So many troubles, so many troubles  
  
To find in me the seed of love  
You gave to me from high above  
To rest in you and you and me  
To feel the way beneath the sun  
Through greedy pride and noisy hide  
Through hocus pocus rock 'n' roll  
Through Peter Pan and pretty fans  
Through sticks and stones  
  
So many troubles  
Here I am, here I come  
Hold my hand one more time  
One more try  
  
Speak to me cause I don't know the way
