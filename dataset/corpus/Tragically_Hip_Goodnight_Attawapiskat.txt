Hello! Good evening, folks  
We are the Silver Poets  
Here in our thousand mile suits  
We're here to get paid  
We know nobody ever who got laid  
Telling people what to do  
We've come too far to feel like that  
You've come too far to feel like that  
  
Attawapiskat  
City by the Bay!  
There's no denying that  
Oh, Attawapiskat  
You're on your way  
  
And though there's no sign  
Of a songbird up here yet  
No one to take advantage of  
We know that life is short  
Nobody can afford it  
To sing a song that they don't love  
I've come too far to feel like this  
You've come too far to feel like that  
  
Attawapiskat  
City by the Bay!  
A diamond dazzling  
Oh, Attawapiskat  
You're on your way  
  
You're on your way  
You're on your way  
You're on the way  
  
Oh, Attawapiskat  
Oh, goodnight, Attawapiskat  
Thank you! Goodnight!  
Goodnight, Attawapiskat  
Oh, goodnight Attawapiskat  
Goodnight, Attawapiskat  
Goodnight, Attawapiskat  
Goodnight, Attawapiskat
