Last night  
I saw a fire burning on  
The palace lawn.  
O'er the land  
The humble subjects watched in mixed  
Emotion.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Who is burnin'?  
Who is burnin'?  
Effigy.  
Who is burnin'?  
Who is burnin'?  
Effigy.  
  
Last night  
I saw the fire spreadin' to  
  
The palace door.  
Silent majority  
Weren't keepin' quiet  
Anymore.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Last night  
I saw the fire spreadin' to  
The country side.  
In the mornin'  
Few were left to watch  
The ashes die.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Why?  
Why?  
Why?  
Effigy.
