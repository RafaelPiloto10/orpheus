I'm gonna sign my name to full confession  
It seems the woman I loved last night  
Belongs to another man  
  
They'd like to take you home  
They'd like to purr and tease you  
But I'm a passionate man  
And I couldn't leave her alone  
  
'Cause you are damned if you do  
Damned if you don't  
Damned if you will  
Damned if you won't  
  
Sometimes they look so good  
But don't you let 'em deceive you  
'Cause then you find out that they got  
Some kind of a venomous mind  
  
And the thing that's worse  
Is that it all seems worth it  
I'm still a passionate man  
And she wouldn't leave me alone  
  
If you think that being a stud is easy  
Well, now don't ask me, boys  
I wouldn't know, I'm a little slow  
  
And you are damned if you do  
And damned if you don't  
You're damned if you will  
And you are damned if you won't  
  
If you think that being a stud is easy  
Well, now don't ask me, boys  
I wouldn't know, I'm a little slow  
  
Gonna sign my name to full confession  
It seems the woman I loved last night  
Belongs to another man  
  
They'd like to take you home  
They'd like to purr and tease you  
And I'm a passionate man  
And I couldn't leave her alone  
  
'Cause you are damned if you do  
Damned if you don't  
Damned if you will  
Damned if you won't  
  
Damned if you do  
Damned if you don't  
Damned if you will  
And damned if you won't, ooh  
  
I'll be damned
