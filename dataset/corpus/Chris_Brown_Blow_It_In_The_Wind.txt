Oh baby, you stay on my brain, I smoke, kick back and think

Oh keep watching me, we sitting here tryna have a good time right now

Keep tripping on us but we just stunting on 'em right now  
They hating on us, they just mad cause we way up, right now  
  
[Chorus]  
So blow it in the wind  
Let the sparks fly now, get your mind blown  
Let the good times get your back, let the sparks fly now

[Bridge]  
Hit the corner, swerving left to right  
You know we get to ducking when we see them lights  
I catch a charge and beat it  
I pop a 30, codeine got me leaning  
Yeah yeah, you know the strong don't quit  
Yeah you know my shooters don't miss  
Steady double cup in the fifth, ice  
Me and my niggas be young, black and rich, wassup  
I got my feet up in the two seater  
Niggas stay looking but don't wanna see us  
So to the haters and true believers  
All my people, you know I see ya  
Hey yeah, yeah yeah  
Yeah sing it baby like  
Hey yeah, yeah yeah  
Hey yeah, yeah yeah  
Hey yeah, yeah yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
So blow it in the wind  
Let the sparks fly now, get your mind blown  
Let the good times get your back, let the sparks fly now  
We can smile and then they wonder why, we up now  
So blow it in the wind  
We can't let them other niggas kill the vibe  
So blow it in the wind  
All that bullshit, we gon' let it ride
