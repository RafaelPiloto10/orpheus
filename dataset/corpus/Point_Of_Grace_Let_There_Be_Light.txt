Star of wonder, star of might  
Star with royal beauty bright  
Westward leading, still proceeding  
Guide us to thy perfect light  
  
From the beginning the Father  
Had a magnificent plan  
Revealed through the law and the prophets  
To fulfill the redemption of man  
  
You spoke after centuries of silence  
In the midst of a still, starry night  
And Emmanuel came down among us  
And the Father said, 'Let there be light'  
  
Let there be light, let it shine bright  
Piercing the darkness with dazzling white  
Hope for the hopeless was born on that night  
When God sent His Son and said, 'Let there be light'  
Let there be light  
  
People who walked in great darkness  
Gathered from near and afar  
Shepherds with flocks in their keeping  
Three kings who follow a star  
  
Together the poor and the richest  
Witness that Bethlehem night  
And the sky full of Angels announcing  
The birth of a glorious light  
  
Let there be light, let it shine bright  
Piercing the darkness with dazzling white  
Hope for the hopeless was born on that night  
When God sent His Son and said, 'Let there be light'  
Let there be light  
  
We who are His have this calling  
To praise Him and make His name known  
So one day the presence of Jesus  
Shines in every heart and every home  
(Shines in our home)  
(Star of wonder, star of beauty bright)  
  
Let there be light, let it shine bright  
Piercing the darkness with dazzling white  
Hope for the hopeless was born on that night  
When God sent His Son and said, 'Let there be light'  
Let there be light  
  
Let there be light, let it shine bright  
Piercing the darkness with dazzling white  
Hope for the hopeless was born on that night  
When God sent His Son and said, 'Let there be light'  
Let there be light
