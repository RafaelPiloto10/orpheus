Hey brothers, hear me call  
It ain't that I had to fall  
Wasn't no one's fault last night  
When I looked up and felt the light  
  
Here's hoping you'll understand  
I want to fell like a natural man  
Get up early in the morning to do what I can  
You can't help no one with money  
If you can't with your hands  
  
And you got to be there brothers, yes you do  
If the world is turning under you  
Ain't no good to sit around  
And bring it up or down  
You got to be there brothers, yes you do  
  
Hey brothers, now and then  
There's something that oughta move you  
More than a pen  
You don't need no school or knowledge  
You've got something else to lend  
And all the people in the world  
Can make it better again  
  
And it ain't easy, yes I know  
It's a hard and rugged road  
Don't be swindled, don't be fooled  
Just be honest and stay cool  
  
'Cause you got to be there brothers, yes you do  
If the world is turning under you  
Ain't no good to sit around  
And bring it up or down  
You got to be there brothers, yes you do
