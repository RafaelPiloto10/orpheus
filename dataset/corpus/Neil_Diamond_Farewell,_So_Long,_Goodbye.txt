Farewell  
To all of the heartaches you brought  
So long  
To all of the tears I cried  
Goodbye  
To the bitter lesson you taught  
Farewell, so long, goodbye  
  
Through with having you walk on me now  
How many times can one person die?  
Once I was blinded  
But I can see now  
Farewell, so long, goodbye  
  
If there was some way to start again  
I'd try it  
But we both know  
It never can be  
Oh,  
Wish I could say I won't even miss you  
It's gonna hurt me and that's no lie  
But I'll get hurt more if I stay with you  
So Farwell, So long, Goodbye
