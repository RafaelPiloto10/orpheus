Even the lover makes a mistake sometimes.  
Like any other, fall out and lose his mind.  
And I'm sorry for the things I did,  
For your teardrops, or the words I said.  
Can you forgive me and open your heart once again? Oh yeah.  
  
[Chorus]  
It's true. I mean it.  
From the bottom of my heart.  
Yeah, it's true.  
Without you I would fall apart.  
  
Whatever happened, I know that I was wrong. Oh yes.  
Can you believe me? Maybe your faith is gone.  
But I love you and I always will,  
So I wonder if you want me still.  
Can you forgive me and open your heart once again?  
Oh yeah.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'd do anything to make it up to you.  
So, please understand and open your heart once again.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
It's true.
