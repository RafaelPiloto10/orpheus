Yeahhh!!!!  
Hello  
Here I am!  
Here we are,we are one  
I've been waiting for this night to come  
Get up!  
Now it's time for me to take my place  
The make-up runnin' down my face  
We're exiled from the human race.  
  
You're in the psy  
You're in the psycho circus  
You're in the psy  
You're in the psycho circus  
I say welcome to the show.  
  
I've been waiting here to be your guide  
So come  
Reveal the secrets that you keep inside  
Step up!  
No one leaves 'til the night is done  
The amplifier starts to hum  
The carnival has just begun.  
  
You're in the psy  
You're in the psycho circus  
You're in the psy  
You're in the psycho circus  
Yeah I say welcome to the show  
Welcome to the show

I've been waiting here to be your guide  
Some come  
Reveal the secrets that you keep inside  
Step up!  
No one leaves 'til the night is done  
The amplifier starts to hum  
The carnival has just begun.
