There she sits buddy just gleaming in the sun  
There to greet a working man when his day is done  
I'm gonna pack my pa and I'm gonna pack my aunt  
I'm gonna take them down to the Cadillac Ranch  
  
Eldorado fins, whitewalls and skirts  
Drives just like a little bit of heaven here on earth  
So when I die buddy throw my body in the back  
And take me to the junkyard in my Cadillac  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Cadillac, Cadillac  
Long and dark, shiny and black  
Open up them engines let 'em roar  
Tearing up the highway like a big old dinosaur  
  
James Dean in a Mercury '49  
Junior Johnson running in the woods of Caroline  
Even Burt Reynolds in a Black Trans Am  
Are gonna meet me down at the Cadillac Ranch  
  
Cadillac, Cadillac  
Long and dark, shiny and black  
Open up them engines let 'em roar  
Tearing up the highway like a big old dinosaur  
  
Hey little girlie in the blue jeans so tight  
Driving all alone in a Colorado night  
You're my last love, baby you're my last chance  
Don't let 'em take me to the Cadillac Ranch  
  
Cadillac, Cadillac  
Long and dark, shiny and black  
Open up them engines let 'em roar  
Tearing up the highway like a big old dinosaur  
  
Cadillac, Cadillac  
Long and dark, shiny and black  
Open up them engines let 'em roar  
Tearing up the highway like a big old dinosaur
