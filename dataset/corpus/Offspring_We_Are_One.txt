We are one with ourselves  
We don't give a shit about anyone else  
Well it won't be wrong until our day in the sun is gonna stop  
The walls come tumbling down  
  
[Chorus]  
We are one  
We are free  
We are headed for obscurity  
We are one  
We are weak  
We are gonna make ourselves extinct  
  
Let it go  
We're gonna let it go  
It's real, we are one  
You know it's true  
Don't fuck with us or we'll fuck with you  
It's a mentality that kills the best  
We better stop  
The walls come tumbling down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We are one and it won't be news  
When we hang ourselves with one collective noose  
Well, it won't be wrong until our day in the sun is gonna stop  
The walls come tumbling down  
  
The bigger they are  
The harder they fall
