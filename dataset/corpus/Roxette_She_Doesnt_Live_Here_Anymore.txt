We grew up together,  
we've been here forever.  
Barefoot in the summer,  
cold in stormy weather.  
She taught me all there is,  
like magic and love,  
lots of forgotten words.  
  
But now,  
she doesn't live here anymore.  
She's off and she's gone,  
she doesn't live here anymore.  
I'm sorry that's all there is to it,  
I'm sorry that's all.  
  
She dressed just like a painter,  
a female street Picasso and I,  
I will remember the heaven in her laughter.  
And the scent of her sweet perfume  
when we made love under an August moon  
  
But now,  
she doesn't live here anymore.  
She's off and she's gone,  
she doesn't live here anymore.  
I'm sorry that's all there is to it,  
I'm sorry that's all.  
  
But now, she doesn't live here anymore.  
She's off and she's gone,  
she doesn't live here anymore  
She's gone since long, so long,  
she doesn't live here anymore.  
She took off and left home,  
She doesn't live here anymore.  
I'm sorry that's all there is to it,  
I'm sorry that's all.  
That's all.
