Father, blessed Father it's morning again  
I give You Father, myself Father continue Your plan  
I know together we can climb mountains in the sky  
No one can stop us when I'm standing by Your side  
When trouble's knocking here again  
I'll tell him Jesus has me by his hand He'll walk me through  
Father, loving Father create in me  
A pure love, Father, Your love, Father instill it in me  
I remember the nights I've cried for You  
Now I only have to die for You  
Thank You, Lord, You've made it clear just for me  
I see the light it's burning out the night, oh, Father it's morning  
Morning, morning, morning, morning  
Morning, morning, morning, morning  
Morning, morning, morning, morning  
Morning, morning, morning, morning, morning
