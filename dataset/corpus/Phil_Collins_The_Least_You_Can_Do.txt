I was lying awake last night, waiting for your call  
But if the rumors are true, that won't bother you at all  
I'm trying hard to understand  
What it takes to be your man  
Now I don't have to wonder anymore  
  
Least you can do is say you're sorry  
Least you can do is give me back my heart  
Just give me back my heart  
  
Seems living in hope was wrong those years I was away  
Thinking your letters, I never received, had gone astray  
You said you'd always be there for me  
Like a fool I thought you'd be  
Now I don't know what I was thinking at all  
  
But the least you can do is say you're sorry girl  
Least you can do is give me back my heart  
I won't come around no more  
You won't find me standing outside your door  
Least you can do is tell me why, tell me why  
  
The least you can do is say you're sorry girl  
Least you can do is give me back my heart  
I won't come around no more  
You won't find me standing outside your door  
But the least you can do is tell me why  
  
I won't be your fool anymore  
There's no need to be cruel anymore, no, no  
Least you can do is say you're sorry girl  
The least you can do is give me back my heart  
Just give me back my heart
