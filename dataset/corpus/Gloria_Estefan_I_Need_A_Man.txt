I've been waiting for somebody  
To satisfy my needs  
Someone who will be my lover  
Someone that I can please  
I just don't know where to find him  
I don't know where to go  
All I know is this urge inside me will  
Drive me up the wall  
  
I need a man who will love me  
I need a man that I can make love to  
I need a man who will please me  
My whole life long  
  
I'm not waiting any longer  
I'm running out of time  
You can't spend your whole live dancing  
You've got to have some fun  
My body is screaming for some action  
Don't you understand  
Tonight I need someone to love me  
Tonight I need a man  
  
I need a man  
Who will love me  
I need a man  
That I can make love to  
I need a man  
Who will please me  
My whole life long  
I need a man  
  
I want a guy that I can call my own  
A boy who's kisses get me out of control  
A guy to kiss me everything that I need  
You've gotta find him, I'm beggin' ya please  
I need a, I need a, I need a, I need, I need,  
I need a man  
Come on, I want you, I want you,  
I've got to have you  
I want a guy that I can call my own  
A guy to kiss me everything that I need  
Come one, I want you, I need you  
I've got to have you  
I want a guy that I can call my own
