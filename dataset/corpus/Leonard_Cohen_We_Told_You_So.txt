(Written By Cohen, Performed In "Night Magic")  
  
(Angels) We told you so  
We told you dear  
You didn't have  
To come here  
  
The human life  
Is full of quirks  
We can't work it out  
Nothing works  
  
It's a lemon  
This mechanic  
Live, love, suffer  
Die and panic  
  
It lives, it loves  
Suffers and dies  
It eats cow's meat  
And apple pies  
  
Dumb, dumb, dumb  
And full of fear  
Anxiety and strife..  
This is the human life!  
  
... We have many duties still  
Much gold and silver light to spill  
On anxious boys and frightened girls like you...
