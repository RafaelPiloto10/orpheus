[Chorus 1: Marvin Gaye (Snoop Dogg)]  
Get up and, party, yeah  
(Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me)  
Groovy baby, sing a song,  
Get up and, and party, ooh,  
Come on girl  
(Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me)  
  
[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]  
Can't you hear what I hear, that's the sound  
Of the voice that you haven't heard in a while  
It makes you wanna do the bumpin  
I'm starvin', I went and got Marvin  
I see the rap game is just augin  
And at times, I'm the main target  
Hey yo Marvin, what you feel about it  
And what you think your nephew Snoopy  
Snoop should do about it  
  
[Chorus 2: Marvin Gaye]  
Get up and, party,  
Yeah (Snoopy and Marvin, Marvin  
And Snoopy)  
I wanna sing a song, get up, and  
Party (together at last)  
Baby come on, come on girl  
  
[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]  
It's a party over here  
But I don't really know  
What the party is a go  
Cause they trippin' at the front door  
Let it go, slide in slow  
But I really don't know cause I'm  
Tryin' to hit the dance floor  
And then I'm gonna go to the motel  
Hands in the air cause you know I don't care  
Hey yo Marvin, what you feel about it  
And what you think your nephew Snoopy  
Snoop should do about it  
  
[Marvin Gaye]  
Get up and oh party, yeah  
(Snoopy and Marvin, Marvin and Snoopy)  
I wanna sing a song, and party  
(Together at least)  
Baby come on, come on (and party, yeah)  
Get up and oh party, yeah (sing a song, get up)  
  
[Snoop Dogg]  
Dance with me, dance with me,  
Dance with me (yeah)  
  
[Marvin Gaye]  
Groovy baby, sing a song, get up, and party  
  
[Snoop Dogg]  
Dance with me, dance with me, dance with me  
  
[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]  
No matter where you at  
  
If you white, if you black  
If you don't like me  
This is somethin' to groove to, to move to  
Made to move you, ensue you, Snoop do  
What I do, keep it true, and ball through  
What I make may can take years on you  
Hey yo Marvin, what you feel about it  
And what you think your nephew Snoopy  
Snoop should do about it  
  
[Chorus 1]  
  
[Chorus 2: Repeats]
