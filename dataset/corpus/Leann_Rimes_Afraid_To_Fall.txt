Wild flowers felt good beneath my feet  
The wind blew tangles in my hair  
As long as i remember the blue eyed boy lived down the road  
Until then i never noticed he was there  
He was like a storm and keepin' me awake  
And no one's gonna stop me there from runnin' in the rain  
  
And it was three a.m. and the moon was bright  
And we'd sneak out and go for a ride  
And we'd made love where the river meets the sky  
Yeah he'd say things i've never heard  
And i'd hang on his every word  
And the perfect teen i gave him my heart  
And i wasn't afraid to fall  
  
Autumn leaves were breakin' 'neath my feet  
The dawnin' face had felt a tear  
He said he didn't feel the way he did before  
But somehow we were still there  
But i didn't wanna lose him  
And i knew my heart would break  
And no one's gonna stop me there from chasin' the pain  
  
And it was three a.m. and the moon was bright  
And we'd sneak out and go for a ride  
And we'd made love where the river meets the sky  
Yeah he'd say things i've never heard  
And i'd hang on his every word  
And the perfect teen i gave him my heart  
And i wasn't afraid to fall  
  
I wouldn't change a single thing  
Every touch a drop of rain  
Oohh ohh yeah oh oh yeah  
And it was three a.m. and the moon was bright  
And we'd sneak out and go for a ride  
And we'd made love where the river meets the sky  
And he'd say things i've never heard  
And i'd hang on his every word  
And the perfect teen i gave him my heart  
And i wasn't afraid to fall  
  
I wasn't afraid to fall oh ohh  
Wasn't afraid to fall ohh oh
