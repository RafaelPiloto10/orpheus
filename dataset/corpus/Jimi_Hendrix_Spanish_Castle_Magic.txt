It's very far away  
It takes about a half and a day to get there  
If we travel by my uh, dragon-fly  
No it's not in Spain  
But all the same you know, it's a groovy name  
And the wind's just right.  
Hey!  
  
Hang on my darling  
Hang on if you wanna go  
Here it's a really groovy place  
It's uh, just a little bit of uh, said uh, Spanish Castle Magic.  
  
The clouds are really low  
And they overflow with cotton candy  
And battle grounds red and brown  
But it's all in your mind  
Don't think your time on bad things  
Just float your little mind around  
Look out! Ow!  
  
Hang on my darling, yeah
