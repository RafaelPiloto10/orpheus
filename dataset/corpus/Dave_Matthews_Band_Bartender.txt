If I go  
Before I'm old  
Oh, brother of mine  
Please don't forget me if I go  
  
Bartender, please  
Fill my glass for me  
With the wine you gave Jesus that set him free  
After three days in the ground  
  
Oh, and if I die  
Before my time  
Oh, sweet sister of mine  
Please don't regret me if I die  
  
Bartender, please  
Fill my glass for me  
With the wine you gave Jesus that set him free  
After three days in the ground  
  
Bartender, please  
Fill my glass for me  
With the wine you gave Jesus that set him free  
After three days in the ground  
  
I'm on bended knees, I pray  
Bartender, please  
  
When I was young, I didn't think about it  
Now I can't get it out of my mind  
  
I'm on bended knees  
Father, please  
  
Oh, and if all this gold  
Should steal my soul away  
Oh, dear mother of mine  
Please redirect me if this gold  
  
Bartender, you see  
The wine that's drinking me  
Came from the vine that strung Judas from the Devil's tree  
His roots deep, deep in the ground  
  
Bartender, you see  
The wine that's drinking me  
Came from the vine that strung Judas from the Devil's tree  
Its roots deep, deep in the ground  
Ground  
  
I'm on bended knees  
Oh, Bartender, please  
  
I'm on bended knees  
Father, please  
  
When I was young, I didn't think about it  
Now I just want to run and hide  
  
I'm on bended knees  
Oh, Bartender, please  
Bartender, please
