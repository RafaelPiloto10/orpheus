Alright  
Yeah  
  
Look at all the people, livin' on the street  
It don't seem they got nothin' to eat  
Children play with guns and they ain't toys  
What will become of all my girls and boys?  
  
It don't take brains to figure it out  
Everyday the newspaper headlines shout  
It's gonna take a miracle from above  
Either that just one drop of love  
  
(One drop of love)  
One drop of love will make the world alright  
(One drop of love)  
One drop of love will unite black and white  
(One drop of love)  
One drop of love to make a new start  
(One)  
One drop of love everyone's heart  
  
I know  
I know  
I know  
  
It's getting harder everyday to make ends meet  
When you do, it's hard to stay on your feet  
Who are your real friends? You can't keep track  
While you're wathin' you front, you're gettin' stapped in the bag  
  
I ain't no genius but I know  
There's only one way to make this hatred go  
People, I tried it, now I'm beggin' you  
(Just)  
Reach in your heart and give up one drop too  
  
(One drop of love)  
One drop of love will make the world alright  
(One drop of love)  
One drop of love will unite black and white  
(One drop of love)  
One drop of love to make a new start  
(One)  
One drop of love everyone's heart  
  
One drop of love, will plant a seed  
Maybe everyone will follow our lead  
Then they'll see, one drop can grow  
'Cause wilt enough drops a whole river flows  
A whole river flows from one drop of love  
  
(One drop of love)  
Yeah  
(One drop of love)  
Hmm  
(One drop of love)  
Ye, one drop, aha  
  
I ain't no genius but I know  
There's only one way to make this hatred go  
People, I tried it, now I'm beggin' you  
(Just)  
Reach in your heart and give up one drop too  
  
(One drop of love)  
One drop of love will make the world alright  
(One drop of love)  
One drop of love will unite black and white  
(One drop of love)  
One drop of love to make a new start  
(One)  
One drop of love everyone's heart  
  
(One drop of love)  
One drop of love will make the world alright  
(One drop of love)  
One drop of love will unite black and white
