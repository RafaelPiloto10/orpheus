It's so hard to find you  
I'm standing right behind you  
The streets are much colder  
This mean I'm getting older  
  
Why would you? How could I?  
These questions lead to goodbye  
But now I got my freedom  
Don't I?  
  
[Chorus]  
I parked my car outside your house  
Hope that someday you'll come home  
Seems the woman that I love  
Is someone that I hardly know  
And after all this time  
I've finally found a way to be alone  
I'm terrified, I think that I may be losing my mind  
  
Shy girl, so humble  
With eyes that make me stumble  
Somehow not speaking lets me know everything  
I go out, you eat in  
Hide from the situation  
You're naked in daylight  
Wrap yourself up and goodnight  
  
I'm burning, I'm hungry  
Angry 'cause she don't love me  
You've got me completely  
In my own game, you beat me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I will be back again  
No this is not the end  
I've fallen hard this time but I not giving in  
I want the world to know that I won't let you forget  
The tears that you shed  
I'll make it impossible to let go  
  
[Chorus: x2]
