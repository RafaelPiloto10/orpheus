Casper, the friendly ghost,  
The friendliest ghost you know.  
Though grown-ups might  
Look at him with fright,  
The children all love him so.  
  
He always says hello (Hello),  
And he's really glad to meetcha.  
Wherever he may go,  
He's kind to every living creature.  
  
Grown-ups don't understand  
Why children love him the most.  
But kids all know  
That he loves them so,  
Casper the friendly ghost.
