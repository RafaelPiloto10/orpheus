I feel a song comin' on  
And I'm warning ya  
It's a victorious  
Happy and glorious new strain!  
I feel a song comin' on  
It's a melody!  
Full of the laughter  
Of children out after the rain!  
You'll hear a tuneful story  
Ringin' thru ya!  
Love and glory!  
Hallelujah!  
And now that my troubles are gone  
Let those heavenly drums go on drummin'  
Cause I feel a song comin' on!  
  
I feel a song comin' on  
And I'm warning ya  
It's a victorious  
Happy and glorious new strain!  
I feel a song comin' on  
It's a melody!  
Full of the laughter  
Of children out after the rain!  
You'll hear a tuneful story  
Ringin' thru ya!  
Love and glory!  
Hallelujah!  
And now that my troubles are gone  
Let those heavenly drums go on drummin'
