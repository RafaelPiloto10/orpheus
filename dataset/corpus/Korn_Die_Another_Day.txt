The madness creeping up on me  
The pressure's building, I foresee  
  
Slowly escaping  
This wreckage in making  
So don't look back for me  
  
Sometimes we take it all  
Nothing stands in our way  
We have to fight and crawl  
To die another day  
Die another day (x2)  
  
Misery often misleads  
It creates things we can not see  
Excessive thoughts unbound  
Distorting reality  
  
Slowly escaping  
This carnage in making  
So don't look back for me  
  
Sometimes we take it all  
Nothing stands in our way  
We have to fight and crawl  
To die another day  
Die another day (x4)  
  
Hello  
Are you there?  
How come?  
Won't you listen?  
I really don't care (x2)  
  
Slowly escaping  
This wreckage in making  
Nothing will be the same  
So don't look back for me  
  
Sometimes we take it all  
Nothing stands in our way  
We have to fight and crawl  
To die another day  
Sometimes we take it all  
Nothing stands in our way  
We have to fight and crawl  
To die another day
