You said you were out with a friend  
Well your friend left her lipstick in your car again  
That mark on your neck didn't get there from shaving  
I got a feeling you've been misbehaving  
  
[Chorus]  
So give me one good reason why I should stay  
Just one good reason not to walk away  
Must be open season on cheating man-a-tease  
And why do you do me this way  
Just give me one good reason to stay  
And I'll stay  
  
You tell me your love is true  
Well is that what you tell all the other girls too  
You can't tell the truth babe  
You're not even trying  
I got a feeling you're just adlibing  
  
[Chorus: x4]
