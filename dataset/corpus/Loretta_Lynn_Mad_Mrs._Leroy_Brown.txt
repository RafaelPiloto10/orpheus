I've been in and out of every honky tonk in town  
And I'm almost drunk from the drinks that I've turned down  
Well, you told me you'd be happy, bouncin' babies on your knee  
While I sit at home alone and I've been bouncin' three  
Yeah, and I'm tired of it too  
  
I'm gonna call myself a long pink limousine  
Yeah, believe it or not it's the prettiest thing I think I've ever seen  
There's a big bar in the corner and a tv on the side  
This baby's 60 feet long and 40 feet wide  
  
Hey driver pull this car, buddy, right inside the bar  
Take it on back to the big ole blonde that thinks she's a movie star  
I'm gonna grab her by her phony ponytail  
I'm gonna sling her around and around  
When she wakes up she'll know she met up with mad Mrs. Leroy Brown  
  
Well, the smoke's so doggone thick you could cut it with a knife  
And the music's so loud you can hear the same line twice  
Hey Leroy Brown, how do you like my big ol' pink limo?  
I just drawed all your money out of the bank today  
Honey, you don't have no mo'  
  
I'm gonna call myself a long pink limousine  
Yeah, believe it or not it's the prettiest thing I think I've ever seen  
There's a big bar in the corner and a tv on the side  
This baby's 60 feet long and 40 feet wide  
  
Hey driver pull this car, buddy, right inside the bar  
Take it on back to the big ole blonde that thinks she's a movie star  
I'm gonna grab her by her phony ponytail  
I'm gonna sling her around and around  
When she wakes up she'll know she met up with mad Mrs. Leroy Brown
