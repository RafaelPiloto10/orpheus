He has a heart of gold  
The way to paradise is cold  
I know, I know  
That this world is a show  
Love you more than words can say  
There's a will, there's a way  
I know, I know  
That this world is a show  
  
I want you, hey you  
Feel brand new  
Oh, I break the golden rules  
Time is on my side  
I want you, hey you  
Take a chance on me  
Baby, put your love on me  
I want you tonight  
  
I want you, hey you  
Little boogaloo  
Shot a hole right in my soul  
Hey girl, hey girl, take this chance for love  
I want you, hey you  
Little boogaloo  
You want me and I want you  
Hey girl, hey girl  
You are the one that I'm dreaming off  
  
I'm tired of be alone  
Oh girl, it's easier said than done  
I know, I know  
That this world is a show  
Oh, you wasted days and nights  
Give me the chance for paradise  
I know, I know  
That this world is a show
