The holiest place there could ever be  
All you can do is bow  
Before the one who made heaven and earth  
Before the Almighty God  
For Him alone  
  
Sing with the angels  
Sing with the angels  
Singing the name of the lord  
Singing the name of the lord  
  
For every soul  
He gave it all  
Given for all of mankind  
Eternal life is His alone  
Given to all who believe  
In Him alone  
  
Jesus  
Jesus  
Jesus  
Jesus.
