You, do you remember me?  
Like, I remember you  
Do you spend your life, going back in your mind to that time?  
'Cause I, I walk the streets alone  
I hate being on my own  
And everyone can see that, I really fell  
And I'm going through hell  
Thinking about you with somebody else  
  
[Chorus]  
Somebody wants you, somebody needs you  
Somebody dreams about you every single night  
Somebody can't breathe, without you it's lonely  
Somebody hopes that one day you will see  
That somebody's me  
That somebody's me  
Yeah  
  
How, how did we go wrong?  
It was so good, and now it's gone  
And I pray at night, that our passing will cross  
What we hide isn't lost  
'Cause you are always right here in my thoughts  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You will always be in my life, even if I'm not in your life  
'Cause you're in my memory  
You, will you remember me?  
And before you set me free, oh listen please  
  
[Chorus]  
  
That somebody's me  
That somebody's me
