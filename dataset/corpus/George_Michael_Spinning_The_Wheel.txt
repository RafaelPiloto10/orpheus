Five o'clock in the morning  
You ain't home  
I can't help thinking that's strange  
Baby I just want you to know  
I won't go through it again  
Yes, those clouds are closing in  
  
And I will not accept this as a part of my life  
I will not live in fear  
Of what may be  
And the lessons I have learned  
I would rather be alone than watch you  
Spinning that wheel for me  
  
You've got a thing about danger  
Ain't you getting what you want from me  
You've got a thing about strangers  
Baby that's what we used to be  
You've got a thing about danger baby  
I guess the hungry just can't see  
One of these days  
You're gonna bring some home to me  
  
Six o'clock in the morning  
You ain't home  
I can't help thinking that's strange  
It seems that everybody takes their chances  
These days  
Oh yeah we're standing in the rain  
  
And I will not accept this as part of my life  
  
How can you love me  
When you are playing with my life  
You say give me time and I'll do better I swear  
Give me time and I'll lead you back to despair  
And I don't want to go back there
