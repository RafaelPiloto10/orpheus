I'd like to dial your number again  
But I don't remember it so well.  
I'd like to see you again  
'Cause I don't remember when  
  
I said I wouldn't see you again  
Been so long I don't remember when.  
  
I'd like to kiss you one more time  
Because I feel it might be different now.  
I'd like to love you one more time  
Because the last respect was mine.  
  
Although I didn't have the time  
Been so long just thought one more time.  
  
So I'd like to dial your number again,  
Seems that I remember it so well.  
I'd like to see you again  
'Cause I don't remember when  
  
I said I wouldn't see you again  
Been so long, can you tell me when ?
