It's the swing  
It's the swing like a pendulum  
It marks the moments as the years go by in an innocent phase  
The swing into never-never land  
There was a darkness like an old friend  
That scratched and crawled up the wall  
Into my life  
Into my destiny  
Into my desire  
  
It's the swing  
It's the swing like a pendulum  
So look behind you when the race has run  
And the winner is named  
The swing into never-never land  
There was a darkness like an old friend  
That scratched and crawled up the wall  
Into my life  
  
Well it's the swing  
The swing like a pendulum  
Between the pieces and between the lines  
Leaving nothing to hide  
There was a darkness like an old friend  
That scratched and crawled up the wall  
Into my life  
Into my destiny  
Into my desire  
  
It's the swing  
It's the swing like a pendulum  
It's the swing  
It's the swing like a pendulum  
It's the swing
