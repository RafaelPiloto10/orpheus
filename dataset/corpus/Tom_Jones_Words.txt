WORDS  
WRITERS BARRY, MAURICE AND ROBIN GIBB  
Smile an everlasting smile A smile could bring you near to me Don't ever let
me find you gone 'Cause that would bring a tear to me This world has lost its
glory Let's start a brand new story Now my love right now there'll be No other
time and I can show you How my love Talk in everlasting words And dedicate
them all to me And I will give you all my life I'm here if you should call to
me You think that I don't even mean A single word I say It's only words, and
words are all I have to take your heart away You think that I don't even mean
A single word I say It's only words, and words are all I have to take your
heart away It's only words, and words are all I have to take your heart away
