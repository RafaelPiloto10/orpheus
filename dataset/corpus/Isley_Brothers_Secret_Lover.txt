So much on my mind I want to to do

(And like) mess around  
(Like) all night long  
Girl, let's get it on

My mystery girl  
I want to play hide and seek  
Baby, let's creep between the sheets tonight  
My secret lover  
My mystery girl  
I want to play hide and seek  
Baby, let's creep between the sheets tonight  
My door is open wide, let me come inside  
Shadows fill the room from the candlelights  
See our bodies moving to the groove, yeah  
So girl let's get it on, ain't no time to loose  
You got me on cloud nine  
And I don't want to come down  
Your lovin' soothes my soul  
And I love it when you come around  
Repeat 1  
This meal is on my plate  
I can't wait to taste, taste you girl  
Good lovin' going down all around this place  
(Like) upstairs  
(And like) down there  
(Like) everywhere  
Woman, I don't care  
Repeat 1  
If the wind blows, no one knows  
'Bout the hiding place on my porch  
You body's cold, let me step to you  
And rub you down nice and slow  
Nothing but the water  
And opportunity for you and me  
So baby girl just ride my wave  
Until the next day  
Can't you feel me babe, oh baby  
My secret lover  
My secret lover
