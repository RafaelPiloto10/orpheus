Turn your lights down low  
And pull your window curtain  
Oh let the moon come shining in  
Into our life again  
Saying ooh, it's been a long, long time  
(Long, long time)  
I got this message for you girl  
But it seems I was never on time  
Did I wanna get through to you girl?  
On time, on time (word)  
I want to give you some love  
I want to give you some good, good loving  
(Uh, uh, right, uh)  
Oh I, oh I, oh I  
Yeah I want to give you some good, good loving (uh)  
  
Turn your lights down low  
(Word, word, uh, uh)  
Never ever try to resist, oh no  
(Na, na, na, na)  
Let your love come shining in  
(Na, na, na, na)  
Into our lives again  
(Na, na, na, na)  
And ooh, I love you  
(I love you, I love you)  
And I want you to know right now  
(Know right now)  
Ooh I love you  
(Uh-uh, yeah, uh)  
And I want you to know right now (uh)  
That I, that I  
I wanna give you some love (uh, yeah)  
I wanna give you some good, good loving  
Oh I, oh I, oh I  
I wanna give you some good, good loving (yeah uh-uh)  
  
Loving you is a like a song I replay  
Every three minutes and thirty seconds of every day (uh, uh)  
And every chorus was written for us to recite (right)  
Every beautiful melody of devotion every night  
It's potion like this ocean that might carry me  
In a wave of emotion to ask you to marry me  
And every word, every second, and every third  
Expresses the happiness more clearly than ever heard (uh)  
And when I play them, every chord is a poem  
Telling the lord how grateful I am cause I know him (what? word)  
The harmonies possess a sensation similar to your caress (uh)  
If you asking then I'm telling you it's yes  
Stand in love, take my hand in love, god bless (right)  
  
I want to give you some good, good loving  
I want to give you some love  
I want to give you some good, good loving  
Oh I, oh I, oh I  
I wanna give you some good, good loving  
  
Good, good, good loving  
(I wanna give you some good loving)
