Sat outside my front window  
This story's going somewhere  
He's well hung and I am hanging on  
There's a song on the radio that says  
"Let's get this party started"  
So let's get this party started  
  
What you do on your own time's just fine  
My imaginations much worse  
I just never want to know  
And what meant the world had folded  
Like legs and fingers holding on to  
What escapes me what he has:  
A better kiss that never lasts  
  
[Chorus]  
You said between your smiles and regrets  
"Don't say it's over"  
Dead and gone  
Dead and gone yeah  
  
The calm before the storm, set it off  
And the sun burnt out tonight  
A reception less than warm, set it off  
And the sun burnt out tonight  
  
This is me standing in the arch of the door  
Hating that look that's on your face  
That says there's another fool like me  
There's one born every minute  
There's one born every minute  
  
What you do on your own time's just fine  
My imaginations much worse  
I just never want to know (never want to know)  
What meant the world imploded  
Inflated then demoted all my  
Oxygen to product gas  
And suffocated my last chance  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Calm before the storm (set it of, set it off)  
Calm before the storm (set it off, set it off)  
  
The calm before the storm, set it off  
And the sun burnt out tonight  
A reception less than warm set it off  
And the sun burnt out tonight  
  
Sun burnt out tonight  
The sun burnt out tonight
