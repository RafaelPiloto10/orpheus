All my life  
And the hereafter  
I've never seen  
Seen one like you  
You're a knife  
Sharp and deadly  
And it's me  
That you cut into  
  
But I don't mind  
In fact I like it  
Though I'm terrified  
I'm turned on but scared of you, oh  
  
She's a monster  
Beautiful monster  
Beautiful monster  
But I don't mind  
And I need her  
Said I need her  
Beautiful monster  
But I don't mind  
  
No I don't mind (I don't mind I don't I don't mind)  
No I don't mind (I don't mind I don't I don't mind)  
No I don't mind (I don't mind I don't I don't mind)  
No I don't mind (I don't mind I don't I don't mind)  
  
In her eyes  
There's love and fire  
And my heart  
She's burning through  
But I don't mind  
In fact I like it  
Though I'm terrified  
I'm turned on but scared of you  
  
She's a monster (she's a monster)  
Beautiful monster (beautiful monster)  
Beautiful monster (beautiful monster yeah)  
But I don't mind (I don't mind)  
And I need her (and I need her)  
Said I need her (said I need her)  
Beautiful monster (whoa)  
But I don't mind (I don't mind I don't I don't mind)  
No I don't mind  
  
Playing with my heart, mmm  
And she's playing with my mind  
  
And I don't mind I don't I don't mind  
No I don't mind I don't I don't mind  
No I don't mind I don't I don't mind  
No I don't mind I don't I don't mind  
  
(I don't mind I don't I don't mind) And I don't mind  
(I don't mind I don't I don't mind) Said I don't mind  
(I don't mind I don't I don't mind) And I don't mind  
(I don't mind I don't I don't mind) Beautiful monster  
  
She's a monster (she's a monster)  
Beautiful monster (beautiful monster)  
Beautiful monster (ooh)  
But I don't mind (but I don't mind)  
And I need her (and I need her)  
Said I need her (said I need her)  
Beautiful monster (beautiful monster)  
But I don't mind (ooh)  
No I don't mind  
  
(Said I don't mind I don't I don't mind) no I don't mind  
(I don't mind I don't I don't mind) no I don't mind  
(I don't mind I don't I don't mind ooh) no I don't mind
