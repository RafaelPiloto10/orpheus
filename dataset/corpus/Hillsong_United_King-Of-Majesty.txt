More than I have before

These words are not made up  
I will live for you, I am devoted to You  
  
King of Majesty, I have one desire  
Just to be with You, my Lord  
Just to be with You, my Lord  
  
Jesus, You are the Saviour of my soul  
And forever and ever, I'll give my praises to You
