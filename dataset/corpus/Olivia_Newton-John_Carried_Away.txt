There you are  
Shiny as a morning star  
It's a figure of speech  
But you're still out of reach  
You never told me loving you could be so wrong and right  
And it's gonna be a lonely night  
I turn to you  
You turn away  
You're looking at someone else  
And here am I  
Loving you more and more  
We've got an open door, my love  
Oh let it be just a state of mind  
And suddenly you appear  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm carried away  
I'm carried away  
To be carried away  
I'm carried away  
To be carried away  
I'm carried away  
  
See'est la vie  
So you want to play another part  
Can you say goodbye  
Can you live a lie  
She'll never give you what I gave you was my breaking heart  
Better than I ever knew  
And if you can live without my love  
You're really gonna be alone  
And here am I  
Walking against the crowd  
Calling your name out loud, my love  
Oh let it be just a state of mind  
And suddenly you appear  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Carried away  
Baby there ain't no final word  
I'll be yours again  
I got a world of tenderness  
Yours until the end  
  
[Chorus: Repeats]
