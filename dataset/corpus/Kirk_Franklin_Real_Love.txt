Written by Kirk Franklin  
Look in my eyes and you will see  
The way real love used to be  
When the flowers bloomed in the spring time  
And happiness was all mine  
It's hard to let my feelings show  
But I've got to let somebody know  
About the love that Jesus has given me  
He loosed my shackles and set me free  
Is this a dream or is it reality?  
Have I finally found someone who loves me?  
I just want to know  
CHORUS  
Have you ever loved somebody  
Will you ever love somebody  
The way that Jesus loves you  
Repeat  
Over and over I ask myself  
Could there ever be anyone else  
Who can give me so much joy and peace  
And make everyday oh so sweet  
I searched all over couldn't find one  
Til I met His only begotten Son  
At first I didn't understand  
Until I saw the nailprints in His hand  
Is this a dream or is it reality?  
Have I finally found someone who loves me?  
I just want to know  
I just want to know  
I just want to know  
CHORUS  
He loves me (4x's)  
Repeat
