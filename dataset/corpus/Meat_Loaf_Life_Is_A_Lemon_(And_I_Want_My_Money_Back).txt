I want my money back  
I want my money back  
It's all or nothing  
  
And nothing's all I ever get  
Every time I turn it on  
I burn it up and burn it out  
  
It's always something  
There's always something going wrong  
That's the only guarantee  
That's what this is all about  
  
It's a never ending attack  
Everything's a lie, and that's a fact  
Life is a lemon and I want my money back!  
  
And all the morons  
And all the stooges with their coins  
They're the ones who make the rules  
It's not a game, it's just a rout  
  
There's desperation  
There's desperation in the air  
It leaves a stain on all your clothes  
And no detergant gets it out  
  
And we're always slipping through the the cracks  
Then the movie's over, fade to black  
Life is a lemon and I want my money back!  
  
I want my money back  
I want my money back  
  
What about love?  
It's defective!  
It's always breaking in half  
  
What about sex?!  
It's defective!  
It's never built to really last  
  
What about your family?  
It's defective!  
All the batteries are shot  
  
What about your friends?  
They're defective!  
All the parts are out of stock  
  
What about hope?  
It's defective!  
It's corroded and decayed  
  
What about faith?  
It's defective!  
It's tattered and it's frayed  
  
What about your Gods?  
They're defective!  
They forgot the warranty  
  
What about your town?  
It's defective!  
It's a dead end street to me  
  
What about your school?  
It's defective!  
It's a pack of useless lies  
  
What about your work?  
It's defective!  
It's a crock and then you die  
  
What about your childhood?  
It's defective!  
It's dead and buried in the past  
  
What about your future?  
It's defective!  
And you can shove it up your ass!!  
  
I want my money back  
I want my money back  
  
It's all or nothing  
And nothing's all I ever get  
Every time I turn it on  
I burn it up and burn it out  
  
It's a never ending attack  
Everything's a lie, and that's a fact  
Life is a lemon and I want my money back!  
  
And we're always slipping through the the cracks  
Then the movie's over-fade to black  
Life is a lemon and I want my money back!
