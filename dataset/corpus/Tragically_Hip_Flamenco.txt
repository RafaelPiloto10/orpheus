Does it diminish your  
Super-capacity to love  
  
Walk like a matador,  
Don't be chicken-shit  
And turn breezes into rivulets  
  
Flamenco-sweep the air  
And weave the sun  
And stamp your feet for everyone  
  
Does it exhibit your  
Natural tendency to hate  
  
Maybe a prostitute  
Could teach you  
How to take a compliment  
  
Maybe I'll go to New York,  
I'll drag you there  
You said, "no one drags me  
Anywhere"  
  
Does it diminish your  
Super-capacity to love
