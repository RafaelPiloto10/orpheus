Tuesday afternoon  
I'm just beginning to see  
Now I'm on my way  
It doesn't matter to me  
Chasing the clouds away  
  
Something calls to me  
The trees are drawing me near  
I've got to find out why  
Those gentle voices I hear  
Explain it all with a sigh  
  
I'm looking at myself reflections of my mind  
It's just the kind of day to leave myself behind  
So gently swaying through the fairyland of love  
If you'll just come with me you'll see the beauty of  
Tuesday afternoon  
Tuesday afternoon  
  
Tuesday afternoon  
I'm just beginning to see  
Now I'm on my way  
It doesn't matter to me  
Chasing the clouds away  
  
Something calls to me  
The trees are drawing me near  
I've got to find out why  
Those gentle voices I hear  
Explain it all with a sigh
