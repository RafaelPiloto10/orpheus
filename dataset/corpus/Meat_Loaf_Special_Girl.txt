Into each life a little sunlight wants to shine  
Let me tell you fortune life that once was mine  
  
[Chorus]  
She was a special girl and she meant the world to me and I gave her everything  
  
When I found her, I'd been looking everywhere  
And when I lost her, I was lost beyond despair  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Dreams are hard to touch, could it be I love her too much  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Bottom line is she was fine in every way  
And it's not with hesitation that I say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Dreams they come and go, but thoughts, like love, will always grow
