Nobody  
Can tell me  
I know  
I know better now  
  
You're a kid  
You're a brat  
Clean up your room  
Throw out the trash  
  
When I was your age  
I heard it all  
Like livin' under  
Your Marshall law  
  
I would think it was  
For my own good  
I would think it was true  
  
Nobody  
Can tell me  
I know  
I know better now  
  
Gotta be in early  
Gotta go to school  
They don't like my friends  
I don't like those rules  
  
I'm not a criminal  
I'm not on drugs  
Don't wait up for me  
I'm out havin' fun  
  
I would think it was  
For my own good  
I would think it was true  
  
Nobody  
Can tell me  
I know  
I know better now  
  
Nobody  
Can tell me  
I know  
I know better now...
