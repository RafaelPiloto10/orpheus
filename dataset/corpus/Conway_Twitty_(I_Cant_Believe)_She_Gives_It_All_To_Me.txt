I pinch myself when I wake up each mornin'  
'Cause I'm constantly amazed when I see  
Exactly everything I've always wanted  
But I can't believe she gives it all to me  
Mmm, lips that warm my face with mornin' kisses  
Arms that reach to hold me tenderly  
And love that always satisfies completely  
But I can't believe she gives it all to me  
She gives me more than any one man deserves  
I who have everything am nothing without her  
Somehow she knows I need her desperately  
I can't believe she gives it all to me
