Mama take this badge off of me  
I can't use it any more  
It's gettin' dark, too dark to see  
And I feel I'm knockin' on Heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door  
Mama, put my guns in the ground  
I can't shoot 'em anymore  
[Incomprehensible] clan is coming down  
I feel I'm knockin' on Heaven's door, hey  
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on Heaven's door
