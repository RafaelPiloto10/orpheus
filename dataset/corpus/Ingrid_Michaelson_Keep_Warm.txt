Eyes on the prize and I can't capsize this time  
'Cause there's somebody else in my boat  
Used to live alone in a tomb I made my own  
But now I've gone and given up my coat  
  
And it's cold outside but I'm just fine  
You are mine to keep warm  
  
Down down down I go  
On a road that I don't know  
And I ain't got a thing in my bag  
Some things you can not plan  
Like your hand in mine  
Just put your hand in mine  
  
And it's cold outside but I'm just fine  
You are mine to keep warm  
Yeah it's cold outside but I'm just fine  
You are mine to keep warm  
  
Sables and wine till the end of time you give me much more than that  
Diamond rings and beautiful things  
Oh you give me much more than that  
When you smile  
  
You are mine to keep warm  
And it's cold outside but I'm just fine  
You are mine to keep warm
