Sinner rider, rides in with the storm  
The devil rides beside him  
The devil is his god, God help you mourn  
Do you, do you hear it, do you hear the thunder  
Deafen every living thing about  
Can you, can you see it, can you  
See the mountains darken yonder  
Black sun rising, time is running out  
  
Sacrifice to vice or die by the hand of the  
Sinner!  
Sinner!  
Sinner!  
Sinner!  
  
His steed of fury,  
Eyes of fire and mane ablaze  
Demonic vultures stalking  
Drawn by the smell of war and pain  
He roams the star ways  
Searching for the carcasses of war  
But if it's hungry then its very presence  
Disrupts the calm into the storm  
  
Curse and damn you all you'll fall by the hand of the  
Sinner!  
Sinner!  
Sinner!  
Sinner!  
  
God of the Devils, God of the Devils  
Won't you help them pray  
God of the Devils, God of the Devils  
Is there no other way  
  
Can't you hear their souls calling out in their plight  
Can't you see their blood is boiling setting them alight  
  
Thirty years now sleeping, so sound  
War raises its head, and looks slowly around  
The Sinner is near, sensing the fear  
And the beast will start movin' around  
  
Can't you see their souls calling out in their brain  
Can't you hear their blood is boiling setting them alight  
  
Sinner, Sinner, Sinner, Sinner!  
Sinner!  
Sinner!  
Sinner!  
Sinner!  
  
Sacrifice to vice or die by the hand of the curse  
And damn you all you fall by the hand of the sinner!  
Sinner! Sinner! Sinner!
