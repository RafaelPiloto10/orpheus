[Defari]  
Danger danger, wild west ranger ranger  
Rearrange 'a the mark ass stranger  
Behold, the look on my face stone cold  
With a rare cowboy style that never grow old  
  
I'm the Golden State bear with a rough flare, plus debanare  
Time for me and mine, but for any kind I can't care  
Stormy weather rain liquid  
Defari con Tony Toca, Tash, and Xzibit  
  
Break necks bounce with it when I spit it  
Knockin this jam is a form of calastenics  
Let it knock when you mashin down the block  
Rims spank with the car wash  
  
Watch the bitches stop  
An look, always stay five steps ahead  
Hard at work, while you tricks lay in bed  
Dead to the world but ?Hayru? he be the sun  
  
Always burnin, 'Cause my job is never done  
Run from one time I rather dump an AK  
that's for all the black and brown that got carried away  
To the morg, when I look in the mirror I see the Lord

[Tash]  
Since niggas want to set trip  
It's time to start the checklist sh the Likwit rhymer runnin through your city
reckless  
Blame it on the hennisey, we drink that shit for breakfast  
  
My style be standin out like my homie Tony's necklace  
This is flawless raw'less for ya ballers  
Nah, fuck why'all, this is for all my drunken alcoholiks  
Nah, fuck dat, this is for my homie Tony Touch  
  
I told ya homeboy we come through in the clutch  
New York, L.A. its not the same thing  
why'all niggas rob, out here we gangbang  
Guns to the ammo, niggas think they Rambo  
  
Standin on the corner with they khakis and they flannel  
Dang yo' flow sound just like D's  
Who want to battle three G's for T's  
Please, read it off the lips of the Alki-bumrusher  
Fuck you up so bad, Tony wouldn't want to Touch ya  
  
Say what?  
Say what?  
Say what?  
Say what?  
Say what?  
Say what?  
I'll fuck you up so bad, Tony wouldn't want to Touch ya  
Say what?  
I'll fuck you up so bad, Tony wouldn't want to Touch ya  
  
[Xzibit]  
Lets get upclose and personal, malicious, Sid Vicious  
I bang bitches, you might find yourself missin tonight  
Rapper's Delight, keep it at the house but ain't fuckin it right  
Got'choo stuck in the headlights, can't move  
Impact is all of the sudden, vehicular homicide  
But I ain't stoppin for nothin  
Me and my cousin, strong buzzin, and playin a dozen  
Pushin and shovin', leads to gettin sucked and rolled up  
Like a nigga with a mask and a gun, hold up  
Rappers act like they ain't gon' die for small fry  
Try to reply, don't touch what you ain't gon' buy  
I ain't gon' lie, motherfucker love to get high  
Barely get by with scraps and pennies  
Now we winnin Grammy's and Emmy's  
And party with the henni and remi  
Got a big bang theory nigga keepin it hot  
Its the art versus ??? or not
