She can't stop pacing, she never felt so alive  
Her thoughts are racing, set on overdrive  
It takes a village, this she knows is true  
They're expecting her and she's got work to do  
  
He helplessly stands by  
It's meaningless to try  
As he rubs his red-rimmed eyes  
He says, I've never seen her get this bad  
  
Even though she seems so high  
He knows that she can't fly  
And when she falls out of the sky  
He'll be standing by  
  
She was raised in a small Midwestern town  
By a charming and eccentric loving father  
She was praised as the perfect teenage girl  
And everyone thought highly of her  
  
And she tried everyday  
With endless drive to make the grade  
Then one day she woke up to find  
The perfect girl had lost her mind  
  
Once barely taking a break, now she sleeps the days away  
She helplessly stands by, it's meaningless to try  
And all she wants to do is cry  
No one ever knew she was so sad  
  
'Cause even though she gets so high  
And thinks that she can fly, she will fall out of the sky  
But in the face of misery, she found hopefulness  
Feeling better, she had weathered this depression  
  
Much to her advantage  
She resumed her frantic pace  
Boundless power, midnight hour  
She enjoyed the race
