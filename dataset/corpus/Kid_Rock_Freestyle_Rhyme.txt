Kid Rock, I'm gonna rock the house biatch  
It goes, 1 for the trebble, and 2 for the bass  
  
And the blue eyed devils gonna rock this place  
'Cause I don't give a damn what ya label me  
I'm still able G, to wreck the whole town  
Got my cards on the table, it's a Royal Flush  
  
In God I trust, and it's a must I bust  
The angel dust and the strick 9  
A big bag of shrooms and the Boones wine  
Never uptight, see I'm that light that shines  
  
Lady's always askin me "what's your sign"  
I'm a Capricorn, not a Taurus  
I'm the oriental lick master from the forest  
I'm the Borris, sorest, looser that you ever saw  
  
But watch out slick, I'm quick on the draw  
And I'll be blastin the fools like this  
Pop, pop, pop, shit!  
Rocks no joke, I go straight for the throat  
  
Chillin it late on my old mans boat  
I hate to grin about the girls I got  
1-2-3-4-5-6-7 yo I got a whole lot  
Stright pimpin, can't stop this  
  
So when I get low on dough, I make my hoe's dance topless  
Watch me rock this, I'm far from spotless  
I'm really kinda dirty, flippin you the birdy  
Rollin on chrom D's  
  
Bumpin them motherfuckin Beasties  
I see these emcee's laugh at Rock  
But I'm nuclear  
Feel the wrath of the after shock  
  
'Cause after Rock, rocks the spot, I leave the whole crowd hot  
On the mic with my nuts in my hand  
With the sluts backstage, hittin nuts on demand  
That could never be a buster, a straight hustler  
  
I got a good bitch, but I still don't trust her  
Let me lay it on the line  
  
I'm just another kid with a freestyle rhyme  
Freestyle rhyme, freestyle rhyme  
I'm just another kid with a freestyle rhyme  
Freestyle rhyme, freestyle rhyme  
  
I'm just another kid tryin to get mine  
Freestyle rhyme, freestyle rhyme  
I'm just another kid with a freestyle rhyme  
Freestyle rhyme, freestyle rhyme uhh, uhh  
  
I gave an invitation to the president, just for kicks  
It said "your courduly invited to suck my dick"  
I'm a trippin, true as this  
I got mill in the bank, cause I make so much sense  
  
Hell bent, and I'm whisky bound  
Is there anything wacker than the wicked clown (no)  
Some people just don't get it  
They got no talent so they hide behind the gilnick and rcok with it  
  
It's a shame, but who's to blame.  
I got a see note brain, steel veins  
I got love for everyone  
Just don't get dumb, cause if ya get dumb,ya get done  
  
From the jimmy to the beach, to the bum  
From the fist, to the back, to attack with the hand granades  
You can't fade me, I'm down for mine  
And the hate in the world, is the sign of the times  
Let me lay it on the line  
  
I'm just another kid with a freestyle rhyme  
Freestyle rhyme, freestyle rhyme  
I'm just another kid with a freestyle rhyme  
Freestyle rhyme, freestyle rhyme  
  
I'm just another kid tryin to get mine  
Freestyle rhyme, freestyle rhyme  
I'm just another kid with a freestyle rhyme  
Freestyle rhyme, freestyle rhyme uhh, uhh  
  
Now I'm the highest, flyest emcee in town  
The scratchin, most smackinest emcee around  
Heaven sentin, representin always  
Your on MTV, radio, game all crazed  
  
I blaze smoke screen, 4-5 OG's  
Got the lady's breakin' with this goatee  
24 on a 12 step relapse  
Phil and Bill bozin' at the knee caps  
  
I'll be back if I don't make green  
With the funky rhymes and the no sell out themes  
I have dreams and aspirations  
My graduation, was from pimp of the county to pimp of the nation  
  
Damn nation is shockin' signs  
From the Kid Rock flows, to the free style rhymes
