(On memory's bliss of you)  
  
The candle plays the hourglass  
The days go and all I do is  
Think of you and wonder where you are at night  
Oh I remember everything  
Every smile, and even all  
The reasons why you say  
I pushed you out of my life  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby you set me  
Baby you set me  
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you  
Baby you set me  
Set adrift on memory's bliss of you  
  
Destiny is everything  
Reality's replaced you with  
The biggest empty void I've ever had in life (ever had in life) ohh  
Bet you say that I don't care  
I bet you say that I don't even think of you  
But God knows how wrong you are  
  
Baby will you be there when the morning comes?  
(Baby will you be there?)  
Just give me time (just give me time)  
To fix my life (to fix my life, baby)  
Baby will you be there when I open my eyes?  
After all the time I've spent, wishing you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sadness that overwhelmed me  
My mind flies and carelessly  
Imagines that you're happy with your life right now oh  
I guess that's just the was it goes  
Forever's gone so now I must  
Place you with all the things that I can never have  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So come on now  
I know this much is true  
I know this much is true
