I'm from the man wit the gang bang,  
Since I was little ain't a god damn thing changed,  
Its the same old same,  
On some bad shit like Saddam Hussein,  
Cock and aim, clinically insane,  
To deal wit dis bullshit day-to-day  
If I sell some yey, smoke some hay,  
You bitches wanna throw me in Helekin's Bay  
Call me an animal up in the system,  
But who's the animal who built this prison,  
Who's the animal who invented lord-livin',  
The projects?, thank god for Russel Simmons,  
Thank God for Sugah Hill,  
I'm puttin' a different type of steel up to my grill,  
Yall know what it is, here for ya home kids,  
How these lil' niggas takin' over show-biz,

There's boys in tha hood, there's toys in tha hood,  
Ya'll wanna know why there's noise in tha hood,  
Cause there's guns in the hood, drugs in the hood,  
Nigga killed the crips and the blood in the hood,  
Cause when niggas get tried, survivable, nobody liable,  
I got caught by 5-0, grandmama came to court wit her bible,  
But when the judge hit the gavel, too far from my family to travel,  
I just came unraveled, came to the d.a. before I got daffeled,  
State my c.a., state property, just like the kid 15-53,  
Lookin' for me, a one-way ticket out,  
Don't know whats so hard to figure out,  
  
The give us guns and drugs,  
They wonder why we fuck wit thugs,  
They want to count the slugs,  
Ain't come around here and fuck wit us,

Ain't come around here and fuck wit us,  
  
Damn I can't take tha pressure, pulled tha fo-fo out the dress'a  
Grabbed away, out the closet, popo comin' but I'm scare to toss it,  
Ya'll know what happened last time I lossed it,  
Can't tell you niggas what the fuckin' boss did,  
G-game got the brotha exhausted, gotta go for the the big bargain they off it  
Twenty yea's fo' what, these laws are so corrupt,  
Takin' these halls and fill them up, some politicin' shit they bout to erupt,  
This shit is horrible stuff, until the year two thousand-what the fuck,  
In the hood don't press ya luck, cause these muthafuckas will set you up,  
Word up  
  
The give us guns and drugs,  
They wonder why we fuck wit thugs,  
They want to count the slugs,  
Ain't come around here and fuck wit us,
