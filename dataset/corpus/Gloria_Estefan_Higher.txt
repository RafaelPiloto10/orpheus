Here we go, here we go now  
  
I saw a girl today  
Could tell from what she say  
She was a liar  
She walks a wire  
I tried to make here see  
That this was not the way  
Of getting higher  
And then she turned away, so I say hear me now  
Just understand, don't get me wrong  
You got to live your life, live it right,  
Or you'll go back to the end of the line  
Higher step it up, higher just do it right and go  
Higher keep it up, higher just pick it up and you go  
Higher move along, higher get off the ground  
Higher lift it up, higher  
  
There is a man I know  
And everyplace he'd go he'd take your money  
Think it was funny  
He'd like to get his way, he never likes to pay  
The law would chase him  
But he just run away, so I say hear me now  
Just understand, don't get me wrong  
You got to live your life, live it right,  
Or you'll go back to the end of the line  
Higher step it up, higher just do it right and go  
Higher keep it up, higher just pick it up and you go  
Higher move along, higher get of the ground  
Higher lift it up, higher here we go, here we go now  
  
I gotta friend who lives on all the love he gives  
When he retires, he's going higher  
One thing I know is true, that everything you do  
Will come back to you, don't let it fool you  
And I say hear me now  
Just understand, don't get me wrong you got to live your life, and live it
right,  
Or you'll go back to the end of the line  
Higher step it up, higher just do it right and go  
Higher keep it up, higher just pick it up and you go  
Higher move along, higher get of the ground  
Higher lift it up, higher here we go, here we go now  
  
Higher step it up, higher just do it right and go  
Higher keep it up, higher just pick it up and you go  
Higher move along, higher get of the ground  
Higher lift it up, higher here we go, here we go now...
