I knew that I had drunk too much  
I had passed my drink degree  
I climbed into my rented car  
I was happy as could be  
  
Then I pulled out of the driveway  
And the lights began to blur  
Within a mile the car was stopped  
By a police officer - she said  
  
"Did you see the light was red?  
Did you see the light at all?"  
Then I fell into her open arm  
And that's all that I recall  
  
I knew that I had danced before  
But it never made the news  
Surprised to find my two left feet  
In John Travolta's shoes  
  
I hogged the space around a girl  
I found so full of verve  
Then I moved in slowly for the kill  
And watched her body swerve,  
  
She said "did you know I'm not impressed  
With the way you dance at all"  
Then I fell into her open arms  
And that's all that I recall  
  
Blacked out and wasted  
I had to be persuaded  
With my view a little jaded  
That I was about to go  
  
Down like a domino  
  
I knew that I had said too much  
But tact was not my way  
Tears were on her bottom lip  
She had nothing more to say except  
  
"Did you know this love we have  
Has made me feel so small"  
Then I fell into her open arms  
And that's all that I recall
