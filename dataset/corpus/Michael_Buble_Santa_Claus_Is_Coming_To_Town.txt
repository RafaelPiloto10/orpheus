You better watch out  
You better not cry  
You better not pout  
I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
He's making a list,  
He's checking it twice,  
He's gonna find out who's naughty or nice  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
He sees you when you're sleeping  
And he knows when you're awake  
He knows if you've been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake  
  
You better watch out!  
You better not cry  
You better not pout, I'm telling you why  
'Cause Santa Claus is coming to town  
Oh let's go!  
  
He sees you when you're sleeping  
And he knows when you're awake  
He knows if you've been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake  
  
You better watch out!  
You better not cry  
You better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
You better watch out!  
You better not cry  
You better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is coming  
I mean the big fat man with the long white beard  
Is coming to town
