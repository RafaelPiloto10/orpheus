Everybody's laughing  
Yes everybody's laughing  
They know that you and I are through  
And everybody's laughing  
  
I told the world you loved me  
And bragged about it proudly  
But since they know it's over  
They're laughing at me loudly.  
  
People love to linger  
So they can point a finger  
And tear apart a gal whose heart  
Was taken through the wringer  
  
It we could start all over  
The laugh might be on them  
But meanwhile  
Everybody's laughing  
  
It we could start all over  
The laugh might be on them  
But meanwhile  
Everybody's laughing
