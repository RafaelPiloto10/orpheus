I love, I love, oh, I still love you  
Can't wait to see the firelight in your eyes  
That's why I wait for your footsteps in the snow  
  
I dream each night that I will wake to find you  
Sleeping deep and still down by my side  
That's why I wait for your footprints in the snow  
  
Time after time  
Year after year  
Forever  
I will love you  
  
In deepest winter, darkest hours you'll find me  
At midnight silence, tremble at the glow  
That's why I wait for your footprints in the snow
