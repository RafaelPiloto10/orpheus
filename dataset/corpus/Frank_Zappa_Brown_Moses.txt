Brown Moses:  
  
Oh-oh! Wait a minute!  
What?  
  
(singing)  
  
What wickedness id this?  
De way you's carryin' on!  
This pygmy I be clutchin'  
Have been lef' out on de lawn!  
  
De daddy were ne-Glij-ible,  
De mama were de-Flate-able,  
De trauma to de imfunt  
Be mostly not ne-Gate-able  
  
Yo' urgin' to be exitin'  
Because of dem fla-min-i-go's  
Be thoroughly perplexin' him  
Because of where yo' petuh goes  
  
If only you been 'siderate  
Erbout this lil' illiterate  
I wouldna been trudgin' cross de san'  
Fum way down yonder in E-gyp-lan'  
  
Dey callin' me brown moses,  
Fo' dat id sho'ly what I am,  
Ancient an' re-lij-er-mus  
Solemn an' pres-tig-i-mus  
  
Wisdom reekin' outa me  
'Long wif summa this baby pee  
'Minds me of dem River Weeds  
'n all dem ignint Bible deeds  
  
Growed up in de Pharoah place,  
Lef' de sucker in disgrace!  
Some dem boys refuse to loin  
Somthin' smokin': Somthin' boin!  
  
Somethin' borry: Somethin' blue!  
Best keeps a lil' paper  
In yo shoe!  
Hear me when I's tellin' you:  
Leavin' de midgit were  
Wrong T'do!  
  
It's a terr'ble thang, done did to him  
Left wit de crab-grass  
Over his chin!  
  
Sho'ly one day he will grow,  
'n put some shit  
In yo' sack o' woe  
  
Ol' brown moses now have spoke!  
Could ya lends me 'bout a dollar?  
I's a tiny bit broke  
  
I likes my wine  
I loves my gin  
'n for a lil' collateral,  
I'll gives ya him!  
A lil' collateral,  
I'll gives ya him!  
A lil' collateral,  
I'll gives ya him!  
I said a lil' collateral,  
A lil' collateral,  
A lil' collateral,  
A lil' collateral,  
A lil' collateral,  
I'll gives ya him!  
I'll gives ya him!  
Take A pompadour, baby!
