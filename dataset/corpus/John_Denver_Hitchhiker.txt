If your driving down the road and you come across an old man  
Holding out his thumb in the wind  
His clothes are old and dirty and dirty that doesn't matter  
It's his eyes that tell where he's been  
If you're not afraid to take your chances on a stranger  
He might have some company to lend  
Why don't you pull off to the side and let that old man have a ride  
He can tell you all the crazy things he's seen  
  
I'm an old hitchhiker  
The highway is the only home I know  
Where you're headed I don't mind  
I ain't been there in some time  
And it's just exactly where I want to go  
  
I can tell you how I started in the circus as a barker  
Drawing people in from far and wide  
They never did regret the dollar that it cost 'em  
We always left 'em feeling good inside  
We were headed for Montana when we hired us a dancer  
Her beauty it was more than I can say  
Then one summer night she set my soul on fire  
Lord, I wish that she was here with me today  
  
I'm an old hitchhiker, I wonder what's a waiting 'round the bend  
I don't know what I might see and I don't need no guarantee  
Just a ride from here to there and back again  
  
I was only seventeen when I took the open highway  
Took it for my teacher and a friend  
I've been thirty years a-thumbing  
Some might call it bumming  
But it's better than just crying in the wind  
So if you're driving down the road and you come across an old man holding out
his thumb in the rain  
Why don't you pull off to the side let the poor boy have a ride  
He can tell you all the crazy things he's seen  
  
I'm an old hitchhiker looking to the far side of the hill  
Some people say I'll settle down  
Build a home in some small town  
But within my heart I know I never will  
  
I'm an old hitchhiker
