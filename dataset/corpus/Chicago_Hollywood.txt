People running everywhere  
Got no place to go  
Got no time to look around to find out where they are  
Where they are  
Where they are  
  
People having such a race  
Don't know where it ends  
Got beat the other man, not getting anywhere  
Anywhere  
Anywhere  
  
Hollywood  
Crazy neighborhood  
Never understood why I stay  
Hollywood  
Lovely lady hood  
  
Make you feel good  
Every day  
Feeling the night's flash by  
Under the glowing eyes  
  
Of the sweet butterflies  
Watch  
What you say  
When you say it  
  
Someone you know  
Will betray it  
Will betray it  
Hollywood  
  
Oh, crazy neighborhood  
Never understood why I stay  
Heard it through the grapevine  
Heard it through the grapevine  
Heard it through the grapevine
