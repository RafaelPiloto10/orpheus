I've forgotten your number  
I hadn't called in a while  
And I'm slowly forgetting your funny little smile  
I've even stopped missing  
The love that we knew  
But I've never stopped dreaming of you  
  
I've lost all the memories  
The feel of your touch  
And it's left my mind why I loved you so much  
I've even forgotten who walked out on who  
But I've never stopped dreaming of you  
  
[Chorus]  
I've never stopped seeing your face every night  
I see it each time that I close my eyes  
And time's heal the memories  
Of the pain I went through  
But I've never stopped dreaming of you  
  
I've misplaced all the trinkets  
That you told me to keep  
And it's been such a long time  
Since I've lost any sleep  
Now I'm doing just fine  
With somebody new  
But I've never stopped dreaming of you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No I've never stopped dreaming of you
