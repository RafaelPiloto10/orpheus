What a sad, sad picture to paint  
Of a dirty, dirty little soul  
We are so blind here  
Let's watch us all fall apart  
  
Find it hard to believe in it  
Believe in it, believe in  
What you give to me  
  
Never thought I would find you here  
Find you here, find you (?)  
  
Tie a rope to either side  
Either side and let's see how our limbs hold up  
  
Eventually we will sink or swim  
Sink or swim, sink into the great abyss
