Somebody told me  
Just the other day  
That you're leaving me  
We're through  
Well if you knew  
How it hurt me so  
Then you'd change your mind  
I'm sure  
Don't want to hear  
What's going on  
I don't care  
What's new  
Don't want to know  
About anything  
Cause all I want  
Is you  
Going out with other girls  
Was always such a bore  
But since I fell in love with you  
I need you more and more  
Don't want to know  
About one-night-stands  
Cut-price souvenirs  
All I want is  
The real thing  
And a night that lasts  
For years.  
If you ever change your mind  
I've a certain cure  
An old refrain, it lingers on  
L'amour, toujours l'amour  
Don't want to learn  
About etiquette  
From glossy magazines  
Why should I try  
To talk correct  
Like they do  
In another scenes  
Say no more  
About imagery  
You're starting to confuse  
Just make an offer  
Of more romance  
Of course I can't refuse  
All I want is you  
Oo oo I'm all cracked up on you.
