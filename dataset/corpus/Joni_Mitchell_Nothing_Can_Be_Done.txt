Must I forgive you  
Each time  
And say you don't know what you're doing  
There are no victimless crimes  
I know of  
Out here in these graffiti ruins  
My love  
  
Oh I am not old  
I'm told  
But I am not young  
Oh and nothing can be done  
Don't start  
My heart  
Is a smoking gun  
Oh and nothing can be done  
  
I heard you leaving  
Late last night  
I heard you screaming down the mountain  
Like you were running red lights  
(Red lights)  
You had some trash-can-rock-band pounding  
  
Oh I am not old  
I'm told  
But I am not young  
Oh and nothing can be done  
Don't start  
My heart  
Is a smoking gun  
Oh and nothing can be done  
  
Must I surrender  
With grace  
The things I loved when I was younger  
(Sweet embrace)  
Must I remember your face  
So well  
What do I do here with this hunger  
  
Oh I am not old  
I'm told  
But I am not young  
Oh and nothing can be done  
Don't start  
My heart  
Is a smoking gun  
Oh and nothing can be done  
  
Nothing can be done  
Nothing can be done  
Oh nothing can be done
