Hey baby I'm here to tell you about yourself  
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog, scratchin' all the time  
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog baby, scratchin' all the time  
You ain't caught no rabbits you ain't no friend of mine  
Well, you said you was high class  
Found out that was just a lie  
Yeah you said you was high class, baby  
That was just a lie  
Well, you ain't killed no rabbits, you ain't no friend of mine  
  
Hey you ain't nothin' but a hond dog, scratchin' all the time  
You ain't nothin' but a hond dog boby, scratchin' all the time
