Come join the band  
Come shag the damned  
God I blow them away  
A heart of chrome  
A broken home  
I got plenty to say  
  
Who ya doin'  
Don't spoil my day  
A bigger better offer baby  
Is on it's way  
You gotta love LA  
  
I feel gigantic  
Gonna burst a vein  
I'm stoppin' traffic  
Cause they dig the fame  
And I'm just the same  
  
Sorry ba-baby  
Haven't seen you lately  
Do you still give it away  
So get my peeps  
To call your peeps  
Cause we've got nothing to say  
  
Don't feed the models  
Don't look (at) the police  
Don't go to Crenshaw Bouli  
Cause Wally can't get fleeced  
Gotta love LA  
  
I feel gigantic  
Gonna burst a vein  
I'm stoppin' traffic  
Cause I dig the fame  
  
I'm hearing voices voices  
Like a jumbo jet  
Too many choices choices  
Gotta love LA  
Californ-I-a  
  
Who ya doin' baby  
Don't spoil my day  
You've been gloating lately baby  
And I dig LA  
Got nothing to say  
  
I feel gigantic  
Gonna burst a vein  
I'm stoppin' traffic  
Cause I dig the fame  
  
I'm hearing voices voices  
Like a jumbo jet  
Too many choices choices  
Gotta love LA  
Californ-I-a
