Danger, she's out into the night  
Danger, she's such a pretty sight  
She was treated so badly it seems  
Now she's lookin' for a dream  
Danger, she's out into the night  
  
Danger, she walks the streets alone  
Danger, all the boys she don't know  
All the men, they look her way  
Could be hers, hers today  
Danger, she's out into the night  
  
Walked into a love affair  
Didn't seem going nowhere  
With no choice, she thought she might  
Now she took the rule right into the night  
  
Danger, she walks the streets alone  
All the boys she now knows  
And all the men, who look her way  
Could be hers today  
  
Risk she'd take to find someone new  
She don't know where or who  
She wants to do, doin' it right  
She's gone out into the night  
  
Danger, she's out into the night  
Danger, she's such a pretty sight  
  
Danger, she's out into the night  
Danger, she's such a pretty sight  
Danger, she's out into the night  
Danger, she's such a pretty sight
