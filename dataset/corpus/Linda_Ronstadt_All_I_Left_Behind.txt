All I left behind should come as no surprise  
To me since I fell through the black hole of your eye  
Only little things inconsequential I could say  
Of all I left behind with you along the lost highway  
Silver earrings in Wichita  
Beaded moccasins in Tonapah  
  
But I had you, so  
I just let them go  
The flannel shirt I wore to keep me from the cold  
When we drove from Boston all the way to Buffalo  
The leather boots I bought so many miles ago  
I took them off to follow you into the Ohio  
Never did my armor feel so thin  
  
Silk was all I had between me and your skin  
Like Waterloo, I lost that too  
And the gold bracelet with my father's name inscribed  
On the back by the one who loved him all her life  
The way I too could have loved you  
The Spanish shawl I put across the broken shade  
Of the lamp that lit the room  
  
That last night near Cour d'Alene  
Only little things inconsequential I could say  
Of all I left behind with you along the lost highway  
Of all I left behind
