Round and round I go in circles trying to be free  
Since you went away the world is closing in on me  
Every day I face tomorrow knowing you'll be there  
I see your face in every little thing we used to share  
The memory of you is everywhere  
  
And my world keeps getting smaller every day  
I run but I can't run away  
You're with me everywhere I go  
And I find you're in my heart and in my mind  
There's no place left on earth to stay  
My world gets smaller every day  
  
In the lonely of the morning when I'm waking up  
I find you standing at the bottom of my coffee cup  
I see you on the highway when I'm driving in the car  
Downtown in the city I just turn and there you are  
I run from you but never get too far  
  
And my world keeps getting smaller every day  
I run but I can't run away  
You're with me everywhere I go  
And I find you're in my heart and in my mind  
There's no place left on earth to stay  
My world gets smaller every day  
  
And my world keeps getting smaller every day  
I run but I can't run away  
My world gets smaller every day
