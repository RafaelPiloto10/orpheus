I watch you breathe, I cannot sleep,  
I touch your hair, I kiss your skin,  
And hope the morning sun won't wake you too soon.  
For when you wake, and look at me,  
You never know, you just might see,  
Another boy who crept in your room...  
Take your time...(that's what you told me),  
Take your time...  
But I fell head first, and I just don't know what to do.  
  
Chorus:  
Nothing looks the same in the light,  
Only a fool like me would take to heart,  
The things you said you meant last night.  
Nothing looks the same in the light,  
I'll keep my feet firm on the ground.  
Nothing looks the same in the light,  
There's danger in a stranger,  
With a warm hand and a kiss so right.  
Nothing looks the same in the light,  
It's been a pleasure, - see you around...  
  
I watch the sun, upon the sheets.  
I hear a car, out on the street,  
And gently pull you close, it's over too soon.  
What can I do, but wait and see,  
Hold on to you, please stay with me,  
Because you're the first, and I want to stay here with you.  
  
Chorus
