Well, I'm not superstitious  
But there's something  
Going on inside  
Could be friendly, could be vicious  
And there isn't any place to hide  
  
It's my imagination  
A blessing or a curse  
No, I can't ignore it  
For better or for worse  
It wakes me when I'm sleeping  
A thief that takes my breath away  
  
And I find myself  
Reaching for a lifeline  
Throw me a lifeline and  
Bring me back in time  
I need a lifeline, throw me a lifeline  
I'm going down for the last time  
  
Sometimes I can't control it  
Sometimes it isn't there at all  
Sometimes I try to roll it  
And wind up staring at the wall  
  
My imagination  
I love the games it plays  
I get in so deep that I get lost  
For days and days  
It sometimes leaves me shakin'  
Standin' in the dark alone
