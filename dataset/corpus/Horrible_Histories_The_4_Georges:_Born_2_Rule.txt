George I:  
I took the throne of England  
Just 'cause I was protestant  
A German prince whose English stank,  
King George number one  
  
George II:  
I like to argue, now that's clear  
Especially with my father here  
And when he died of diarrhoea  
I fought with my son  
  
George III:  
I broke records with my sixty year reign  
  
George VI:  
And I broke the scales with my giant frame  
  
all:  
Born to rule over you  
King George four, three, one and two  
You had to do what we told you to  
Just because our blood was blue  
  
George I:  
I was a hunk, girls adored me  
Ladies all swooned before me  
They would do anything for me  
Or I'd have their husbands killed  
  
George II:  
Had a war with Prince Charles Bonnie  
  
George III:  
Everyone said that I was f-f-funny  
  
George IV:  
I spent everyone's money  
  
All:  
Our subjects were not thrilled  
  
George I:  
I was the sad one,  
  
George II:  
I was the bad one  
  
George III  
I was the mad one,  
  
George IV:  
and I was the fat one  
  
All:  
We were born to rule over you  
Georges one, three, four and two  
England's kings, though we were German too  
Him, then him, then me, then you  
  
(We were born)Born to rule over you(born 2 rule)  
  
George I:  
Gorged on fruit then I died on the loo  
  
ALL:  
People hated us, and we hated them too  
Born to rule over you  
  
Born to rule over you  
  
George III:  
Me I was as batty as a bonkers kangaroo  
  
George IV:  
Me I would have been more at home in a zoo  
And now, now our song is through.  
  
Yeah...  
  
Georges  
  
George III:  
Banana
