Here I go again, my heart's on the line.  
I'm willing to pretend, one more time  
I got some life to spend, on even rhymes  
But when I reach the end, will you (will you) will you be mine?  
  
[Chorus]  
This time I know you're not the answer to my prayer  
And I have grown with each disappointment through the years  
And as bad as I am, and as bad as I am  
I'm still here  
  
On the road again  
I've paid a fine  
Where now is the friend  
I leave (I leave) I leave behind?  
  
I'm goin' 'round the bend  
One more climb  
But when I reach the end  
Will you (will you) will you be mine?  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I'm still here  
I'm still here  
I'm still here  
I'm still
