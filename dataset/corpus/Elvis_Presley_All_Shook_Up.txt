A well'a bless my soul  
What'sa wrong with me?  
I'm itchin' like a man in a fuzzy tree  
My friends say I'm actin' wild as a bug  
I'm in love  
I'm all shook up  
Mm mm mm, mm, yay, yay, yay  
  
Well, my hands are shaky and my knees are weak  
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet  
Who do you think of when you have such luck?  
I'm in love  
I'm all shook up  
Mm mm mm, mm, yay, yay, yay  
  
Well, please don't ask me what'sa on my mind  
I'm a little mixed up, but I'm feelin' fine  
When I'm near that girl that I love best  
My heart beats so it scares me to death!  
  
Well she touched my hand what a chill I got  
Her lips are like a volcano when it's hot  
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup  
I'm in love  
I'm all shook up  
Mm mm mm, mm, yay, yay, yay  
  
My tongue gets tied when I try to speak  
My insides shake like a leaf on a tree  
There's only one cure for this body of mine  
That's to have that girl that I love so fine!  
  
She touched my hand what a chill I got  
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot  
I'm proud to say that she's my buttercup  
I'm in love  
I'm all shook up  
Mm mm mm, mm, yay, yay, yay  
Mm mm mm, mm, yay, yay  
I'm all shook up
