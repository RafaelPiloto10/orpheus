Was it the words she said or was it all in the way  
In which the lady said them?  
Her eyes that spoke to me were sending my heart  
A thought so deep I can't forget them  
I guess it wasn't the right time or the place  
For love right then  
But we met destiny, and it sealed our fate  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
We'll meet again (we will meet again)  
I know we will (we will meet again)  
On my heart it's written (we will meet again)  
Somewhere, someplace, somehow I'll find her then as I did now, just for a
moment  
And I will hear the wind that told me  
I will return again my love have patience  
Life's a circle, it all comes back around,  
So until then...  
I'll be waiting for you knowing somehow  
  
And if she were standing in a crowd  
She'd be the one that I would find among the faces  
And if the music was too loud  
It'd be her voice that I would hear  
Above it all (we will meet again)  
  
I know we will (we will meet again)  
I know we will (we will meet again)  
And if she were standing in a crowd  
She'd be the one that I would find among the faces  
And if the music was too loud  
It'd be her voice that I would hear  
Above it all (we will meet again)  
I know we will (we will meet again)  
On my heart it's written (we will meet again)  
From this day till(we will meet again)  
We'll meet again (we will meet again)  
We'll meet again (we will meet again)
