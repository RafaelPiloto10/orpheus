The words she said turned out why  
Desperation fills her eyes  
Hold her in your arms  
Don't let go  
  
When you taste defeat, when you loose again  
Fight and win, never give in  
Hold her in your arms  
Don't let go  
  
That girl you need  
Gonna knock you off your feet  
That girl, you know  
She'll never let you go  
  
[Chorus]  
That girl, That girl, That girl you need  
That girl, That girl, That girl, That girl  
  
Can you hear her call, call out your name  
Think about you, cry without you  
Hold her in your arm  
Don't let go  
  
Can you taste defeat, when you loose again  
Fight and win, never give in  
Hold her in your arms  
Don't let go  
  
That girl you need  
Gonna knock you off your feet  
That girl, you know  
She'll never let you go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
You need!
