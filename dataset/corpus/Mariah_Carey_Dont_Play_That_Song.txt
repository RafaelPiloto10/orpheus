Don't Play That Song  
  
Performed by: Mariah Carey  
Written by: B Nelson, A Ertegun  
  
Don't play that song for me  
'Cause it brings back memories  
Of days that I once knew  
Those days that I spent with you  
  
Oh no don't leave me  
'Cause it fills up my heart with pain  
So please stop it right away  
'Cause I remember just what he said  
  
He said "Darling I love you"  
But I know that he lied  
"Darling I need you"  
Know that you lied  
"Darling I love you"  
Darling you lied  
Lied  
You lied to me  
  
Hey mister  
Don't play it no more  
Don't play it no more  
I can't stand it  
Don't play it no more  
No more, no more, no more  
I can't stand it  
  
I remember on our first date  
He kissed me and he walked away  
I was only seventeen  
I never dreamed he'd be so mean  
  
He told me "Darling I love you"  
But baby baby you lied  
"Darling I need you"  
You lied  
"Darling I love you"  
Darling you lied  
Lied  
You lied to me  
  
Oh darling  
"Darling I love you"  
You know that you lied  
"Darling I need you"  
Baby I know that you lied  
"Darling I love you"  
Darling you lied  
Lied  
You lied to me and hurt me  
Darling you lied  
  
Don't play it no more  
No baby  
Don't play it no more  
Don't do it  
Don't play it no more  
'Cause I can't stand it no more
