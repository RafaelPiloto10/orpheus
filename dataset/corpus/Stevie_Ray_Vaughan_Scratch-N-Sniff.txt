They were two lonely folks doin' the do's and don'ts  
And got the notion together they'd be happy  
Thought they'd lose the crowd 'n' do the mess around  
Decided to make it snappy  
  
Just a twist of fate they didn't hesitate  
Now they had another party to lean on  
She made him jump and sang he made her share that thang  
  
Looks like they gonna have a ball ain't nothin' wrong at all  
Wo they gonna have a ball  
  
They got to askin' what if they had to scratch-n-sniff  
To find out what it is they are after  
Got the ants out their pants 'n' took the chance on romance  
Made some plans to make it forever  
Now several years have gone they still gettin' along  
They know what true love is made of  
Now they know that life's a trip with all it's bumps and dips  
  
They gonna help one another along  
Nothin' wrong at all still havin' a ball  
Lord they really gettin' it on  
  
Time is on their side they got nothin' to hide  
Never had no secrets between them  
He don't need to accuse her, use her or abuse her  
And she feels the same for him  
  
And those vows they made said nothin' 'bout slaves  
And didn't mention rentin' to own  
They can take the stand that walkin' hand in hand  
What they got is gooder than gold  
  
Ain't nothin' wrong at all wo they gonna have a ball  
Yeah they really got it all  
Love is true heart's desire without it's just a funeral pyre  
Got to let your true love grow it's all you got that's gooder than gold  
  
Let's get it on y'all
