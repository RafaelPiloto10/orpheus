Stay in my heart where I lead you  
Stay where a kiss won't mislead you  
Don't ever think of going far  
You'll have me following where you are  
  
Stay where my arms can reach for you  
Close to the lips that adore you  
And even though it's time to go  
You'll like it better if you stay  
  
Don't ever think of going far  
You'll have me following where you are  
  
Stay where my arms can reach for you  
Close to the lips that adore you  
And even though it's time to go  
You'll like it better if you stay  
You'll like it better if you stay
