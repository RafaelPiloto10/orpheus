Father's hands are lined with dirt  
From long days in the field  
Mother's hands are serving meals  
In a cafe on Main Street  
With mouths to feed  
Just trying to keep clothing on our backs  
And all I hear about  
Is how it's so bad, it's so bad  
  
It's too bad it's too bad  
Too late, so wrong, so long  
It's too bad we had no time to rewind  
Let's walk, let's talk  
Let's talk  
  
You left without saying goodbye  
Although I'm sure you tried  
You'd call the house from time to time  
To make sure we're alive  
But you weren't there  
Right when I needed you the most  
And now I dream about it  
And how it's so bad, it's so bad  
  
It's too bad it's too bad  
Too late, so wrong, so long  
It's too bad we had no time to rewind  
Let's walk, let's talk  
It's so bad  
It's too bad it's too bad  
It's too late, so wrong, so long  
It's too bad we had no time to rewind  
Let's walk, let's talk  
(Let's talk)  
  
Father's hands are lined with guilt  
For tearing us apart  
Guess it turned out in the end  
Just look at where we are  
We made it out  
We still got clothing on our backs  
And now I scream about it  
And how it's so bad, it's so bad, it's so bad, it's so bad  
  
It's too bad it's too bad  
Too late, so wrong, so long  
It's too bad we had no time to rewind  
Let's walk, let's talk  
It's so bad  
It's too bad it's too bad  
It's too late, so wrong, so long  
It's too bad we had no time to rewind  
Let's walk, let's talk  
  
No time  
Let's walk  
Let's talk
