Well, they call you cradle baby  
They say you're too young  
Oh, that yours is not real love  
You're just havin' fun  
'Cause you're only sixteen  
And your life is not free  
Well, they call you cradle baby  
But you're just right for me  
So when I need a-lovin' and all of us do  
L know that I'm a cookin', Well I'm a lookin' for you  
Right back in the cradle  
They say you should be  
Well, they call you cradle baby  
But you're just right for me  
  
Well, they call you cradle baby  
Why don't they leave you alone  
They say your mama will worry  
If you don't hurry home  
Just a-pay no attention  
'Cause it's all there to see  
Well, they call you cradle baby  
But you're just right for me
