It's a bit hard to take  
But all good things must end  
Y' know it's sad but it's true  
I know my heart will ache  
And it will take time to mend  
But it's something I've got to do  
Cause I owe it all to you  
  
(Chorus)  
It's not over yet  
It's a new beginning  
I just gotta say I'm grateful for the time we've had  
It's not over yet  
It's a brand new start  
All I need to say is thank you  
From the bottom of my heart  
  
I need some time alone  
A little moment of silence  
So I can figure out where to go  
Don't know what comes and that's the beauty of tomorrow  
There's so many things to find  
All I need is time  
  
It's not over yet  
It's a new beginning  
I just gotta say I'm grateful for the time we've had  
It's not over yet  
It's a brand new start  
All I need to say is thank you  
From the bottom of my heart  
  
I take a long last look around  
Every moment, every sound  
It's all been worth fighting for  
Just because we close the door  
Doesn't mean it's over yet  
  
It's a new beginning  
And I just gotta say I'm grateful for the time we've had  
It's not over yet  
It's a brand new start  
I just go to say im grateful  
For each and every day  
  
It's not over yet (For each and every day)  
It's a new beginning (For each and every day)  
I just gotta say Im grateful for the time we've had (The time we've had)  
It's not over yet  
It's a new beginning (The time we've had)  
All I need to say is thank you  
From the bottom of my heart  
  
From the bottom of my heart
