The other night I took the long way home  
Out past the old schoolyard  
It's funny how you keep it all inside  
Dreams they do die hard  
  
I closed my eyes and I could see your face  
Somewhere back in time  
One summer night a million miles ago  
Back when you were mine  
  
Say yes, say no, say that I'm grabbing at shadows  
But don't carve the words in stone  
I know it's late  
But can't you see I was only  
Taking the long way home  
  
Sometimes its easy to get all wrapped up  
In trying to be free  
And all those dreams I sailed away to find  
Were right in front of me  
  
Say yes, say no, say that I'm grabbing at shadows  
But don't carve the words in stone  
One of these days  
You're gonna see I was only  
Taking the long way home  
  
Although the letters stopped many years ago  
I'll show you even time could not keep this heart  
from letting go  
  
The other night I took the long way home  
Out past the old schoolyard  
It's funny how you keep it all inside  
Dreams they do die hard  
  
Say yes, say no, say that I'm grabbing at shadows  
But don't leave me here all alone  
One of these days  
You're gonna see I was only  
Taking the long way home  
  
Say yes, say no  
But don't leave me here all alone  
One of these days  
You're gonna see I was only  
Taking the long way home
