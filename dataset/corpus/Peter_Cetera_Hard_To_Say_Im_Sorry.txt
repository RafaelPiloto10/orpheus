Everybody needs a little time away  
I've heard her say  
From each other  
  
Even lovers need a holiday oooh  
Far away from each other  
  
Hold me now  
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry  
I just want you to stay  
And after all that you've been through  
I will make it up to you  
I promise you, baby  
  
And after all that's been said and done  
You're just the part of me I can't let go  
  
Ooooh bup bup bup bup  
  
Couldn't stand to be kept away  
Just for a day  
From your body  
Wouldn't want to be swept away  
Far away from the one that I love  
  
Hold me now  
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry  
I just want you to know  
Hold me now  
I really want to tell you I'm sorry  
I could never let you go  
  
And after all that we've been through  
I will make it up to you  
I promise you  
  
And after all that's been said and done  
You're just a part of me I can't let go  
  
I can't let go.
