It wasn't my intention to cause you this pain  
But here we are, a bridge too far  
I've left you here to wonder if it all was a game  
How can it be, these changes in me  
  
Nothing lasts forever, that's true  
Take a look at the world that we once knew  
Gone are the feelings that once we could hold on to  
  
[Chorus]  
Try to forgive me, find a way to believe me  
I'm hurting the same way too  
Oh I know it's not easy, but baby believe me  
We've been fighting this war far too long  
Where did we go wrong  
  
I tried to write a letter, but it's better this way  
Here in this place, face to face  
Let's not forsake the future in view of the past  
So little gained and far too much pain  
  
Trying to compromise our points of view  
We leave each other feeling blue  
Gone are the feelings that once would have seen us through  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The simple truth is clear to see  
Time to surrender, let it be  
There's nothing here for us to hold on to  
  
[Chorus]
