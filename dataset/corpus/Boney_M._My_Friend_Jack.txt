My friend jack eats sugar loaves  
Sugarman hasn't got a care  
He's been traveling everywhere  
Been on a voyage across an ocean  
Heard the sweet sounds of wheels in motion  
He's seen hawks fly high to hail the setting sun

My friend jack eats sugar loaves  
Sugarman hasn't got a care  
He's been traveling everywhere  
He's seen the people in the city  
And the bright lights looks awful pretty  
He's followed dusty tracks into eternity  
Eating sugar cain in cuba  
Try to grow it in japan  
On the west coast, he's real famous  
Kids they call him sugar man
