People need hope, people need lovin'  
People need trust from a fellow man  
People nee love to make a good livin'  
People need faith in a helping hand  
  
Man has alway wanted a woman by his side  
To keep him company  
Women always knew that it takes a man to get  
Matrimony and harmony  
Everybody knows that a man who's feeling down  
Wants some female company  
Gotta have love to carry on living  
Gotta have love 'til eternity  
  
People need hope, people need lovin'  
People need trust from a fellow man  
People nee love to make a good livin'  
People need faith in a helping hand  
  
La la la la, la la la la la  
La la la la, la la la la la  
La la la la, la la la la la  
La la la la, la la la la la  
  
Flowers in a desert need a drop of rain  
Like a woman needs a man  
If a man's in love and his woman wants the moon  
Then he'll take it down if he can  
Somebody who loves you and somebody who cares  
Isn't that what you call a friend  
Gotta have love to carry on living  
Isn't it easy to understand  
  
People need hope, people need lovin'  
People need trust from a fellow man  
People nee love to make a good livin'  
People need faith in a helping hand  
  
La la la la, la la la la la  
La la la la, la la la la la  
La la la la, la la la la la  
La la la la, la la la la la  
  
People need hope, people need lovin'  
People need trust from a fellow man  
People nee love to make a good livin'  
People need faith in a helping hand  
  
La la la la, la la la la la  
La la la la, la la la la la  
La la la la, la la la la la  
La la la la, la la la la la
