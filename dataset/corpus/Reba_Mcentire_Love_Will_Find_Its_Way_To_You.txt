Another morning, another day in your life  
Without someone there by you  
You had a dream again last night  
You wonder why the dream just won't come true  
So what ya gonna do  
Walk around with your head hung down  
Maybe that's the reason you've never found  
The one for you  
So you've got to let your love shine through  
Your eyes, your smile  
You've got to let somebody know how you feel inside  
Your heart, you'll find  
Somebody wants to be a part of your life  
And if you just believe  
And say that's what you're gonna do  
One day love will find it's way to you  
Yes it will  
One day love will find it's way to you  
Another party, and all your friends are smiles  
Oh you might meet someone new  
And being close would be so nice  
In this life the chances are so few  
So what ya gonna do  
Walk around with your head hung down  
Maybe that's the reason you've never found  
The one for you  
So you've got to let your love shine through  
Your eyes, your smile  
You've got to let somebody know how you feel inside  
Your heart, you'll find  
Somebody wants to be a part of your life  
And if you just believe  
And say that's what you're gonna do  
One day love will find it's way to you  
Oh yes it will  
One day love will find it's way to you  
Don't you think you're the only one  
Oh somewhere in the world  
There's a lonely heart looking for someone  
You've got to let your love shine through  
Your eyes, your smile  
You've got to let somebody know how you feel inside  
Your heart, you'll find  
Somebody wants to be a part of your life  
Cause your eyes, your smile  
You've got to let somebody know how you feel inside  
Somebody wants to be a part of your life
