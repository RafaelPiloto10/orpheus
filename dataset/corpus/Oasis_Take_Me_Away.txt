Just when it falls apart  
And when it's time to start  
Will you sit down here for another day  
And when it's time to be  
All the things that we  
Are wishing away for another day  
  
'cause in my soul we know where we're goin  
We're goin where the grass is free  
The air is clean and the good times are growin'  
So take me away just for today  
'cause I'm sat here on my own  
I'd like to be under the sea  
Where they'd probably need a phone  
  
And just when it falls apart  
Just when it's time to start  
Will you sit down here for another day  
  
'cause in my soul we know where we're goin  
We're goin where the grass is free  
The air is clean and the good times are growin'  
So take me away just for today  
'cause I'm sat here on my own  
I'd like to be under the sea  
Where they'd probably need a phone  
I could be you if I wanted to  
But I've never got the time  
You could be me  
And pretty soon you will be  
But you're gonna need a line  
  
Need a line  
Need a line  
Need a line
