Hey, you got the look of a lonely woman's eyes  
What'cha thinking when you're standing so close to me  
Ain't no law says a man can't fantasize  
There's a secret locked up in you tight  
Oh, I'd love to turn the key  
  
[Chorus]  
Whoa, playing with fire  
Whoa, fighting my desire, baby  
Whoa, my conscience is a liar  
Oh, Lord, have mercy on the shameless sinner  
Whoa, playing with fire  
Whoa, walking on a wire, now I  
Whoa, I face the crucifier  
What'cha doin' to me  
  
Live by rules made up by society  
But I guess I must've missed election day  
'Cause so much about you looks so good to me, yeah  
For what I'm thinking I could go to jail  
But some laws are born to break  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Whoa, playing with fire  
Whoa, fighting my desire, baby  
Oh, I'm beggin' you Lord, have mercy  
On a shameless sinner  
Whoa, playing with fire  
Whoa, stakes are getting higher  
I think I'm losin' it
