She's gotta do what she's gotta do  
And I've gotta like it or not  
She's got dreams too big for this town  
And she needs to give 'em a shot  
Whatever they are  
  
Looks like I'm all ready to leave  
And nothing left to pack  
Ain't no room for me in that car  
Even if she asked me to tag along  
God, I gotta be strong  
  
I'm at the startin' line of the rest of my life  
As ready as I've ever been  
Got the hunger and the stars in my eyes  
The prize is mine to win  
  
She's waitin' on my blessings  
Before she hits that open road  
But baby get ready, oh I'm ready, get set, don't go  
  
Looks like things are fallin' in place  
Feels like they're fallin' apart  
I painted this big old smile on my face  
To hide my broken heart  
If only she knew  
  
This is where you don't say  
What you want so bad to say  
This is where I want to  
But I won't get in the way  
Of her and her dreams  
And spreadin' her wings  
  
I'm at the startin' line of the rest of my life  
As ready as I've ever been  
Got the hunger and the stars in my eyes  
The prize is mine to win  
  
She's waitin' on my blessings  
Before she hits that open road  
But baby get ready, get set, don't go  
  
I'm at the startin' line of the rest of my life  
As ready as I've ever been  
Got the hunger and the stars in my eyes  
The prize is mine to win  
  
She's waitin' on my blessings  
Before she hits that open road  
But baby get ready, get set, please don't go  
  
Don't go, don't go now  
Mmm don't go  
I'll be all right, I'll be ok  
[Incomprehensible]  
Thinking of you each and every day  
She's gotta do what she's gotta do
