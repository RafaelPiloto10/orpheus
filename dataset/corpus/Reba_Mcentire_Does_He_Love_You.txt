I've known about you for a while now  
When he leaves me he wears a smile now  
As soon as he's away from me  
In your arms is where he wants to be  
  
But you're the one he rushes home to  
You're the one he gave his name to  
I never see his face in the early morning light  
You have his mornings, his daytimes  
And sometimes I have his nights  
  
But does he love you (does he love you)  
Like he loves me (like he loves me)  
Does he think of you (does he think of you)  
When he's holding me  
And does he whisper (does he whisper) all of his fantasies  
Does he love you (does he love you) like he's been lovin' me  
  
But when he's with me, he says he needs me  
And that he wants me, that he believes in me  
  
And when I'm in his arms, oh he swears there's no one else  
Is he deceiving me, or am I deceiving myself?  
  
But does he love you (does he love you)  
Like he loves me (like he loves me)  
Does he think of you (does he think of you)  
When he's holding me  
And does he whisper (does he whisper) of his fantasies  
Does he love you (does he love you) like he's been lovin me
