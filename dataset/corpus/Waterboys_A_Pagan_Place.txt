How did he come here?  
Who gave him the key?  
Slipped in his hand  
So secretly  
Who put the colour  
Like lines on his face  
And brought him here  
To a pagan place?  
Who shot the arrow?  
How high did it fly?  
When he tipped it  
With poison  
Did he even know why?  
What unseen hand  
Brought him  
Face to face to face to face with  
All this and more  
In a pagan place?  
Come into my parlour  
Sail in at my shore  
Drink my soul dry  
There is always more  
There is always more after  
Now fly on my carpet  
Look into my face  
And see the  
Heart of Man  
In a Pagan  
In a Pagan  
In a Pagan  
In a Pagan  
In a Pagan  
Pagan....
