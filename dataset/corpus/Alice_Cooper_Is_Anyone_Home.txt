Talking in my sleep, next to no one  
Never never, say never again  
I can't rise and shine  
No I won't even try  
  
My rainy windows are crying crying  
Shoulda, woulda, coulda been  
Like it shoulda been  
A contender like Marlon Brando  
  
Eani Meani Minei Mo  
Caught a virus won't let go  
Been down so long it looks like up to me  
I'm so lonely, I can almost taste it  
  
In a perfect world, I'd just be wasted  
Send me an angel, wrap me in her wings  
Hello, Hello, Hello.  
Is anyone home?  
  
Well, people love to talk  
When I can hardly walk  
To them I'm probably just the "News at Eleven"  
It's the edge of night  
  
As the world turns  
Misunderstood it's just the wrong medication  
I wish, I wish, upon a star  
I wish it hadn't gone this far  
  
Been up so long it looks like down to me  
I'm so lonely, I can almost taste it  
In a perfect world, I'd just be wasted  
Send me an angel, wrap me in her wings  
  
Hello, Hello, Hello.  
Is anyone home?  
Hello, Hello.  
I'm really really wasted  
  
I live in a big doll house  
And nobody's home  
Just me and my mouse  
I live in a big dark house  
  
And nobody's home  
Just me and my mouse  
I'm so lonely, I can almost taste it  
In a perfect world, I'd just be wasted  
  
Send an angel, my own little angel  
Hello, Hello.  
Is anyone home?  
Is anyone home?  
  
Hello, Hello  
Is anyone home?  
Hello, Hello, Hello  
Is anyone home?  
  
Hello, Hello  
Is anyone home?  
Hello, Hello, Hello  
Is anyone home?  
  
Hello, Hello, Hello  
Is anyone home?  
Hello, Hello, Hello  
Is anyone home?
