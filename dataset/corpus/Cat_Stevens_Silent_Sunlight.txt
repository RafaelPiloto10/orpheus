Silent sunlight, welcome in  
There is work I must now begin  
All my dreams have blown away  
And the children want to play  
They'll soon remember things to do  
When the heart is young  
And the night is done  
And the sky is blue  
  
Morning songbird, sing away  
Lend a tune to another day  
Bring your wings and choose a roof  
Sing a song of love and truth  
We'll soon remember if you do  
When all things were tall  
And our friends were small  
And the world was new  
  
Sleepy horses, heave away  
Put your backs to the golden hay  
Don't ever look behind at the work you've done  
For your work has just begun  
There'll be the evening in the end  
But till that time arrives  
You can rest your eyes  
And begin again
