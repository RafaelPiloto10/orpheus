Escape is on your mind again  
Escape to a far away land  
Sometimes it sems there is no end  
To long hard nights of drinking  
How will you go  
How will you go  
Drive through the wind and the rain  
Cover it up  
Cover it up  
I'll find you a shelter to sleep in  
Fell over on the couch again  
But you know not all sleep is wasted  
Your dreams are alcohol inspired  
I can't find a better way to face it  
How will you go  
How will you go  
Drive through the wind and the rain  
Cover it up  
Cover it up  
I'll find you a shelter to sleep in  
And you know I'll be fine  
Just don't ask me how it's going  
Give me time, give me time  
'Cause I want you to see  
That the world, that the world  
Is a tangled up necklace of pearls  
How will you go  
How will you go  
Drive through the wind and the rain  
Cover it up  
Cover it up  
I'll find you a shelter to sleep in
