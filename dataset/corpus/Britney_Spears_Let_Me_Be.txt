You try to read me  
You try to figure out  
You try to breathe me  
But you can't blow me out  
You try to feel me but I'm so out of touch  
I won't be falling  
You won't have to pick me up  
  
[Bridge]  
Sorry if I sound confused  
I don't feel the way you do  
  
But I won't turn around x2  
  
[Chorus]  
You think I might back down but I won't  
Think that I might have doubts but I don't  
No insecurities  
Won't you just let me, let me be  
Think that you know me now but you don't  
Think that I-I can't stand on my own  
Ain't my philosophy  
Won't you just let me, let me be  
  
Trust in my instincts  
Trust that I know what's right  
These are the reasons that keep you up at night (at night)  
  
Tell me "Go slow"- This is my flow  
'Cause you don't know- know what I know  
Let me tell you how it feels  
Baby it's time that you see me for real  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Trust that I know, this is my show  
Letting you know, Gotta go the way I go x2  
  
[Chorus: x2]
