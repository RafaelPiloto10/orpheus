Just to sleep, just to sleep  
Put them lighters up, up  
Put them lighters up, up  
  
My body is cold, I need your help  
I'm coming down from a perfect spell  
Can I take a hint of your love's device  
Inhale the rum, you're just in time  
Your fingertips leave me hypnotized  
And when it hits my lips I am paralysed!  
Cause we come too far, and it feels so right  
So put up a fight, just enjoy the ride!  
No wrong or right, just want the light!  
  
Chorus:  
So put them lighters up, when you see me coming  
Put them lighters up, I wanna see you wave them in the sky  
So put them lighters, put them lighters up  
  
Up, up, put them lighters up  
Up, up, put them lighters up  
Up, up, put them lighters up, up, up  
  
Strike a match while I catch my breath  
Burn it down, I see the take  
Open my eyes and let my spirit bright!  
Cause we come too far, and it feels so right  
So put up a fight, just enjoy the ride!  
No wrong or right, just want the light!  
  
Chorus:  
So put them lighters up, when you see me coming  
Put them lighters up, I wanna see you wave them in the sky  
So put them lighters, put them lighters up  
Up, up, put them lighters up  
Up, up, put them lighters up  
Up, up, put them lighters up, up, up
