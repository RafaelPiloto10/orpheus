I'm walking on a razor blade  
Careful not to cross the line  
Every little step I take, it's punishment time now  
I'm getting to the end of the blade  
Slipping to the other side  
Every little step I take, it's punishment time!  
  
Fighting to survive there's no tomorrow  
Fighting to survive there's no today  
Final flight I'm losing my mind  
Heavy on the heart there's no tomorrow  
Heavy on the heart there's no today  
Final flight I'm losing my mind  
  
I'm hanging like a bat today  
Crucified by the sign  
Every little move I make, it's punishment time now  
I'm sleeping on a bed of nails  
They're breaking through one at a time  
Cause every little move I make  
The punishments mine  
  
Fighting to survive there's no tomorrow  
Fighting to survive there's no today  
Final flight I'm losing my mind  
Heavy on the heart there's no tomorrow  
Heavy on the heart there's no today  
Final flight I'm losing my mind  
  
I give and don't get  
I try to my death  
There's something inside of me  
That makes me forget  
I give and don't get  
I'll try to my death  
There's something inside of me  
That makes me forget  
I give and don't get  
I'll try to my death  
There's something inside of me  
That makes me forget  
I give and don't get  
I'll try to my death  
There's something inside of me  
That makes me forget!  
  
Fighting to survive there's no tomorrow  
Fighting to survive there's no today  
Final flight I'm losing my mind  
Heavy on the heart there's no tomorrow  
Heavy on the heart there's no today  
Final flight I'm losing my mind  
  
Losing my mind, losing my mind, losing my mind  
Losing my mind  
  
Losing my mind, losing my mind, losing my mind!
