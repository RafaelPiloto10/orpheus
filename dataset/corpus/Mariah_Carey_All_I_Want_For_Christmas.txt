I don't want a lot for Christmas  
There's just one thing I need  
I don't care about the presents  
Underneath the Christmas tree  
  
I just want you for my own  
More than you could ever know  
Make my wish come true...  
All I want for Christmas  
Is you...  
  
I don't want a lot for Christmas  
There is just one thing I need (and I)  
I don't care about the presents  
Underneath the Christmas tree  
  
I don't need to hang my stockings  
There upon the fireplace (aahh)  
Santa Clause won't make me happy  
With a toy on Christmas Day  
  
I just want you for my own (ooo)  
More than you could ever know (ooo)  
Make my wish come true  
All I want for Christmas is you...  
You baby  
  
I won't ask for much this Christmas  
I won't even wish for snow (and I)  
I'm just gonna keep on waiting  
Underneath the mistletoe  
  
I won't make a list and send it  
To the north pole for Saint Nick (aahh)  
I won't even stay awake to  
Hear those magic reindeer click  
  
'Cause I just want you here tonight (Ohh)  
Holding on to me so tight(Ohh)  
What more can I do  
Baby all I want for christmas is you  
You Baby...  
  
Oh all the lights are shining  
So brightly everywhere (so brightly baby)  
And the sound of children's  
Laughter fills the air (Ohh)  
  
And everyone is singing (Oh yea)  
I hear those sleigh bells ringing  
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need  
Won't you please bring my baby to me...  
  
Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas  
This is all I'm asking for (aahh)  
I just want to see my baby  
Standing right outside my door  
  
Oh I just want you for my own (ohh)  
More than you could ever know (ohh)  
Make my wish come true  
Baby all I want for Christmas is  
You Baby  
  
All I want for Christmas is you baby  
All I want for Christmas is you baby  
All I want for Christmas is you baby
