I remember you.  
You're the one who made my dreams come true,  
A few kisses ago.  
  
I remember you.  
You're the one who said, "I love you, too.  
I do. Didn't you know?"  
  
I remember, too, a distant bell,  
And stars that fell  
Like rain out of the blue.  
  
When my life is through  
And the angels ask me to recall  
The thrill of them all,  
Then I shall tell them I remember you.  
  
Was it in Tahiti?  
Were we on the Nile?  
Long, long ago, say, an hour or so,  
I recall that I saw your smile.  
  
And I remember, too, a distant bell,  
And stars that fell  
Like rain out of the blue.  
  
When my life is through  
And the angels ask me to recall  
The thrill of them all,  
Then I will tell them I remember,  
Tell them I remember you.
