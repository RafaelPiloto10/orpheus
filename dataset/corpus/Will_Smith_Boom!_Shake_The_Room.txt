  
Yo back up now and give a brother room  
The fuse is lit and I'm about to go boom  
Mercy mercy mercy me  
My life is a cage but on stage I'm free  
Hyped up syched up ready for wil'in'  
Standing in a crowd of girls like an island  
I see the one I wanna sic come here cutie  
I flip 'em around and then I work that booty  
Work the body work work the body  
Slow down girl you're 'bout to hurt somebody  
Oh and yo let's get just one thing clear  
There's only one reason why I came here  
Ya really done want me to tig-a-tig-a-tig-a tell ya wassup (go)  
Ya really done want me to tig-a-tig-a-tig-a tell ya wassup (go)  
Ya really done want me to tig-a-tig-a-tig-a tell ya wassup (go)  
I came here tonight to hear the crowd go  
  
Chorus:  
Boom! shake-shake-shake the room  
Boom! shake-shake-shake the room  
Boom! shake-shake-shake the room  
Tic-tic-tic-tic boom!  
  
Well yo are y'all ready for me yet  
(Pump it up prince)  
Well yo are y'all ready for me yet  
(Pump it up prince)  
Well yo are y'all ready for me yet  
(Pump it up prince)  
Well here I go here I go here I here I go  
Yo  
Dance in the aisles when the prince steps to it  
The rhyme is a football y'all and I went and threw it  
Out in the crowd and yo it was a good throw  
How do I know? because the crowd went hoooo  
In response to the way that I was kicking it  
Smooth and individual  
Rhymes always original  
Like the dr. jekyl man and this is my hyde side  
I am the driver and you're on a rap ride  
So fellas (yeah)  
Are y'all wit me (yeah)  
I said fellas (yeah)  
Are y'all wit me (yeah)  
Why don't you tell the girls what y'all wanna do  
Ya wanna ooh-ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh--ooooh  
That's right yo and I'm in the flow  
So pump up the volume along with the tempo  
I want everybody in the house to know  
I came here tonight to hear the crowd go  
  
Chorus  
  
Pump it pump it come on now  
Repeat 5x  
  
Yeah, come on now  
  
Chorus  
  
Here I go  
The the f-f-f-f-fresh p-p-p-prince is who I am  
So tell my mother that I never make a whack jam  
But some times I get n-nervous and start to stutter  
And I f-fumble every word for word I utter  
So I just try to ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-chill  
But it gets worse-a but worse-a but-but-but worse still  
I need the c-c-c-crowd to k-k-k-kick into it  
They help me calm down and I can get through it  
So higher higher  
Get ya hands to the ceiling  
Let it go y'all don't fight the feeling  
Mic in a strangle hold sweat pourin'  
And like jordan yo I'm scoring  
Yeah that's right y'all and I am in the flow  
So pump up the volume along with the tempo  
Many have died tryin' to stop my show  
I came here tonight to here the crowd go  
  
Chorus
