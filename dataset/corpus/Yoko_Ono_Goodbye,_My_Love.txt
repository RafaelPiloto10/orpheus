Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, my love  
It's time to say goodbye  
Remember me for the fun we had  
Remember me for our love  
  
Be proud that we loved and loved so well  
Don't listen to people who speak from Hell  
Tears, yes, but let's not be too sad  
Let's hope it won't be all that bad  
  
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, my love  
I guess, it's goodbye  
The rivers may flow and the trees may grow  
But it's not the same without you  
  
You said, "Life isn't so bad after all"  
Keep living for us two  
The sun goes up and the moon fades away  
But it's not the same without you  
  
Tears, yes, but don't be too sad  
Let's hope it won't be all that bad  
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, my love  
It's time to say goodbye
