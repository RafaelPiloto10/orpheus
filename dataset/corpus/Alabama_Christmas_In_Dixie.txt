By now in New York City, there's snow on the ground  
And out in California, the sunshine's falling down  
And, maybe down in Memphis, Graceland's all in lights  
And in Atlanta, Georgia, there's peace on earth tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
Christmas in Dixie, it's snowin' in the pines  
Merry Christmas from Dixie, to everyone tonight  
  
It's windy in Chicago. The kids are out of school  
There's magic in Motown. The city's on the move  
In Jackson, Mississippi, to Charlotte, Caroline  
And all across the nation, it's the peaceful Christmas time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And from Fort Payne, Alabama  
God bless why'all...We love ya...Happy New Year...Good night  
Merry Christmas...Merry Christmas tonight
