Chemistry look what you've done to me  
Chemistry brought me near gravity  
Chemistry look what you've done to me  
  
You've called me up  
My heart is pounding  
Can't bear to breath  
I've Just got over you  
  
What do you want  
You like a broken record  
Spinnin' in my head  
Why can't you let me be?  
  
I don't understand  
What it is about you  
The more you reject me  
The more I want from you  
  
You're always on my mind  
Always have been, always will be  
I think about you all the time  
I don't want to, you're a habit  
  
And I'm running and running and  
Running and running away from you  
Every time when you call,  
I come undone can't escape from you  
  
Is it the science of Love?  
Is it the science of Love?  
It's the science of Love  
It's the science of Love  
  
I'm thinking to fight it  
To get away from you  
Something always pulled me  
Right back to you  
  
I don't understand  
What it is about you  
The more you reject me  
The more I want from you  
  
You're always on my mind  
Always have been, always will be  
I think about you all the time  
I don't want to, you?re a habit  
  
And I'm running and running  
and running and running away from you  
Every time when you call,  
I come undone can't escape from you  
  
Is it the science of Love?  
Is it the science of Love?  
I wanna be with you but I'm so afraid  
My heart's not ready cause I'm still in pain  
I'm feeling my love is out of control  
I wanna give up but I can?t let go  
  
You're always on my mind  
Always have been, always will be  
I think about you all the time  
I don't want to, you're a habit  
  
And I'm running and running and  
Running and running away from you  
Every time when you call, I come undone can't escape from you  
Is it the science of Love?  
Is it the science of Love?  
It's the science of Love  
It's the science of Love  
Love is Science
