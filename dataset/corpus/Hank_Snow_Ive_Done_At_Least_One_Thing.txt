When I think of the dreams I've let slip through my hands  
And the years that I've wasted Lord I've cried from my shame  
But when I feel the glow of your love then I know  
That I've done at least one thing that was good in my life.  
  
Yes, I've done at least one thing that was good in my life  
And with you I have one dream that will live through the night  
And each day I will know as I watch our love grow  
That I've done at least one thing that was good in my life.  
  
When I think of the dreams I've let slip through my hands  
And the years that I've wasted Lord I've cried from my shame  
But then when I feel the glow of your sweet love then I know  
That I've done at least one thing that was good in my life.  
  
Yes, I've done at least one thing that was good in my life  
And with you I have one dream that will live through the night  
And each day I will know as I watch our love grow  
That I've done at least one thing that was good in my life...
