I keep singing the same old song  
Like I did before  
When you left me  
You left me in darkness  
I'd never known before  
I was restless  
A fool for your time  
Waiting 'round for you to call  
But now I've found me  
An angel of mercy  
I don't feel bad at all  
  
Your body was honey  
I tasted a lot  
But let me tell you babe  
I need more than you got  
I want someone to hold me  
An' keep me satisfied  
I need love  
  
I've got nothing to do  
Ain't got nothing to say  
Just live your life  
The way you know  
When you moved on  
You took all the sweetness  
Was I a fool to let you go  
With the woman I forget for the moment  
All the times we knew before  
Tho I'm still singing  
The same old love song  
I don't want you knocking on my door
