You brace and hold it all inside  
It's more than you can stand  
No one around even tries  
Tries to understand  
  
Don't turn away, don't turn away  
Come out swinging  
Come out alone  
They're in your way  
But as long as you're swinging  
Strong then you'll get by  
  
Your pacing's wearing out a line  
Right beside your bed  
The scene replays a million times  
Stuck inside your head  
  
And though you stand in place  
Your mind escapes  
Read between the lies  
Smile's on your face  
You fake like you're ok  
  
Don't turn away, don't turn away  
Come out swinging  
Out on your own  
They're in your way  
You may be stinging  
But you'll get by  
Don't turn away, don't turn away  
Come out swinging  
Never alone again  
The pain inside can guide your way  
  
Midnight, no sleep  
Inside, you scream to  
No one, hears you fall  
Daylight, prove me today  
One more try  
  
Don't turn away, don't turn  
Come out swinging  
Come out alone  
They're in your way  
You may be stinging  
But you'll get by  
Don? T turn away, don't turn away  
Come out swinging  
Never alone again  
Pain inside  
Leads you through so you'll get by
