In this world of make believe I must confess  
  
To be number one you've got to do it better  
  
And if you strive to be happy you'll find success  
  
Perspectively you've got to pull it together  
  
Nothing good will come to you if you don't see  
  
A reason for victory  
  
Everybody loves the winner  
  
Only the winner can really make things happen  
  
Everybody loves the winner, so be the winner, I know you are  
  
If there's something you'd like to do you've never done  
  
Don't let fear stand in your way  
  
Just collect your dreams and thoughts and get on the run  
  
I wouldn't wait another day  
  
You can be the best in everything you do  
  
When it thawls out, it's all up to you  
  
Everybody loves the winner (everybody loves the winner)  
  
Only a winner can really make things happen  
  
Everybody loves a winner (everybody loves a winner)  
  
So be the winner you are  
  
Be a winner, ooh (yes you can, yes you can, yes you can)  
  
Be a winner, ooh (yes you can, yes you can, yes you can)  
  
Be a winner, a winner, a winner, yes you can  
  
'cause everybody (everybody) loves (loves a winner)  
  
The winner, so be a winner  
  
You can only make things happen  
  
Everybody (everybody) loves a winner (loves a winner)  
  
So be the winner, I know you are  
  
Every (everybody), everybody, (loves a winner)

Only the winner can really make things happen  
  
Everybody (everybody) loves the winner (loves a winner)  
  
So be a winner (so be a winner), I know you are if you really try  
  
Be a winner, you know you can, you know you can  
  
You know you can be a winner
