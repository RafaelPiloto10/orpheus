Where would you rather be?  
Anywhere but here  
When will the time be right?  
Anytime but now  
  
On the edge of sleep,  
I was drifting for half the night  
Anxious and restless,  
Pressed down by the darkness  
Bound up and wound up so tight  
So many decisions, a million revisions  
Caught between and light...  
  
Wilderness of mirrors  
World of polished steel  
Gears and iron chains  
Turn the grinding wheel  
I run between the shadows  
Some are phantoms, some are real  
  
Where would you rather be?  
Anywhere but here  
When will the time be right?  
Anytime but now  
The doubt and the fear  
I know would all disappear  
Anywhere but here  
  
On the edge of sleep,  
I heard voices behind the door  
The known and the nameless,  
Familiar and faceless  
My angels and my demons at war  
Which one will lose - depends on what I choose  
Or maybe which voice I ignore...  
  
Wilderness of mirrors  
Streets of cold desire  
My precious sense of honor  
Just a shield of rusty wire  
I hold against the chaos  
And the cross of holy fire  
  
Wilderness of mirrors  
So easy to deceive  
My precious sense of rightness  
Is sometimes so naive  
So that which I imagine  
Is that which I believe  
  
On the edge of sleep, I awoke to a sun so bright  
Rested and fearless, cheered by your nearness  
I knew which direction was right  
The case had been tried by the jury inside  
The choice between darkness and light...
