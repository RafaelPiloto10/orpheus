Light up light up  
Light up your lazy blue eyes  
Moon's up nights up  
Taking the town by surprise  
Night time night time  
Day left an hour ago  
City light time  
Must you get ready so slow  
There are places to come from and places to go  
  
Night in the city looks pretty to me  
Night in the city looks fine  
Music comes spilling out into the street  
Colors go flashing in time  
  
Take off take off  
Take off your stay-at-home shoes  
Break off shake off  
Chase off those stay-at-home blues  
Stairway stairway  
Down to the crowds in the street  
They go their way  
Looking for faces to greet  
But we run on laughing with no one to meet  
  
Night in the city looks pretty to me  
Night in the city looks fine  
Music comes spilling out into the street  
Colors go waltzing in time
