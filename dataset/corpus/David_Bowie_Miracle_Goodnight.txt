Burning up each others' love, burning up our lives  
Tried all kinds of working out, miracle goodnight  
Future full and empty knocking on my door  
Ragged limbed and hungry mama  
Miracle no more  
(Skin tell me) turn it around  
(Head tell me) make it alright  
(Nobody dancing)  
Morning star you're beautiful, yellow dime on high  
Spin you round my little room, miracle goodnight  
Evening flower all alone, puzzling capeche  
Haven't got a death wish, just want a little more  
  
CHORUS  
(Skin tell me) turn it around  
(Head tell me) make it alright  
(Nobody dancing) miracle goodnight  
(Breath tell me) turn it around  
(Heart tell me) make it alright  
  
(Nobody dancing) it was only make believe  
I wish I was a sailor a thousand miles from here  
I wished I had a future, anywhere  
I love you in the morning sun, I love you in my dreams  
I love the sound of making love, the feeling of your skin  
The corner of your eyes, I long forevermore  
I never want to say goodnight, miracle goodnight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't want to know the past, I want to know the real deal  
I really don't want to know that  
The less we know, the better we feel  
Morning star you're beautiful, yellow diamond high  
Spinning around my little room, miracle  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Skin tell me) turn it around  
(Moon tell me) make it alright  
(Nobody dancing) it was only make believe  
(Eyes tell me) turn it around  
(News tell me) make it alright  
(Nobody dancing)  
  
[Chorus]
