You are my teacher, I come to school  
I love you, baby  
Sometimes I'm right and then a fool  
Oh, be my lady  
It's not a game I play with you  
Darling I know, 'cause I know the golden rule  
  
Do what you want be what you are  
You're the lady of my heart  
Oh come, oh come to me  
  
I was lonely  
I was so lonely  
I never break apart  
The loving feeling  
My sense is reeling  
You're the lady of my heart  
  
Sometimes we win, sometimes we lose  
I love you baby  
Sometimes we sin, I always choose  
You're my lady  
Always forgive what I have said  
Darling, I know  
We'll hold together come what made
