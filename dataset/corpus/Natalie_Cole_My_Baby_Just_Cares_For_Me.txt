My baby don't care for shows  
My baby don't care for clothes  
My baby just cares for me  
My baby don't care for cars and races  
My baby don't care for high toned places  
Liz Taylor's not his style  
And even Lana Turner's smile  
Is something that he just can't see  
My baby don't care who knows it  
My baby just cares for me  
My baby don't care for shows  
My baby don't care for clothes  
My baby just cares for me  
My baby don't care for cars and races  
My baby don't care for those high toned places  
Liz Taylor's not his style  
And even Lana Turner's smile  
Is something that he just can't see  
My baby don't care who knows it  
Cause my baby just cares for me  
My baby don't care for shows  
My baby don't care for clothes, no  
My baby just cares for me  
Well I wonder what's wrong with my sweet baby  
'Cause my baby just cares for, oh  
My baby don't care for cars and races  
My baby don't care for fancy high toned places  
Liz Taylor's not his style  
And even Lana Turner's smile  
Is something he can't see  
I don't know what's wrong with my pretty pretty baby  
'Cause my baby he really just cares for  
Oh oh my baby he only only swears for  
My baby he only just cares for me  
So there!
