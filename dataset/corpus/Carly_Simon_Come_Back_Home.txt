Summer time, kids in the street  
We were up on the roof laughing at the heat  
That was the last I ever saw of you  
  
Now it's December, cold and dark  
No more rainbows over Central Park  
In this house no window has a view  
There's no love here without you  
  
[Chorus]  
When you gonna come back home  
When you gonna see it's been too long  
When you gonna come back home to me  
  
Standin' at the door and I turn the key  
I'm holding my breath half expecting to see  
You lyin' on the bed, smilin' up at me  
I'm goin' crazy 'cause I just don't know  
Which way your heart's gonna go  
I only pray it leads you back to me  
Darlin' let your heart  
Lead you back to me
