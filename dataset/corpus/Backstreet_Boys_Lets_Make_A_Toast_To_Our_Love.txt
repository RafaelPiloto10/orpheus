I'll love you forever  
Leaving you, I'll never  
Let's make a toast to our love  
I'll love you forever  
Leaving you, I'll never  
Let's make a toast to our love  
  
Here's to us, girl, you and I  
May our love last 'til eternity  
The love we have can touch the sky  
It's just enough love for you and me  
  
Now we've been blessed (we've been blessed)  
With happiness (with happiness)  
Your love came from up above  
So we'll always stay together  
We must keep that forever  
  
I'll love you forever  
Leaving you, I'll never (oh girl)  
Let's make a toast to our love  
I'll love you forever  
Leaving you, I'll never (oh girl)  
Let's make a toast to our love  
  
We sip the champagne as a symbol of love  
We want everyone to know just how much  
Made a vow, to one another  
You'll always be my lady, and I'll always be your man  
As we sit at the table, reserved for two  
All this love, girl, and it's only me and you  
It's so amazing another can rely  
Stars fill the sky, the night is so right  
  
We've been blessed (we've been blessed)  
With happiness (with happiness)  
Your love came from up above  
So we'll always stay together  
We must keep that forever  
  
I'll love you forever  
Leaving you, I'll never (oh girl)  
Let's make a toast to our love  
I'll love you forever  
Leaving you, I'll never (oh girl)  
Let's make a toast to our love  
  
I'll love you forever  
Leaving you, I'll never  
Let's make a toast to our love
