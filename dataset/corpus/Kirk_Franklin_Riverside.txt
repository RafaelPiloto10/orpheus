It's Friday and my bills are due  
My 3 month old baby need some shoes  
Can you feel what I'm going through  
Clock on the wall keeps ticking tockin  
No stoppin and somebody's knockin  
On the do tellin me to go  
Brotha I can't take no mo  
So with my knees I hit the flo  
And say help me Jesus, help me Jesus  
  
[Chorus]  
Let's go down by the riverside  
Leave your problems all behind  
You can rest troubled minds  
Down by the riverside  
If I concentrate on all the bad  
And all the things I wish I had  
How can the dark clouds ever pass  
Weeping may endure for a night  
But joy comes in the morning light  
God he keeps me right  
So no matter what the people say  
Ain't nobody takin this joy away  
In spite of all I've been through I can say  
Thank you Jesus, Thank you Jesus, Thank you Jesus  
  
[Chorus]  
Let's go down by the riverside  
Leave your problems all behind  
You can rest troubled minds  
Down by the riverside  
(3 x)  
Well, Well, Well  
There's a blessing in the water ya'll  
By the riverside, Say what now  
There's a healin in the water  
By the riverside, Say what now
