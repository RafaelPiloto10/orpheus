Who are these ones who would lead us now?  
To the sound of a thousand guns  
Who'd storm the gates of hell itself?  
To the tune of a single drum  
  
Where are the girls of the neighborhood bars?  
Whose loves were lost at sea?  
In the hills of France and on German soil  
From Saigon to Wounded Knee  
  
Who come from long lines of soldiers?  
Whose duty was fulfilled?  
In the words of a warrior's will  
And protocol  
  
Where are the boys in their coats of blue?  
Who flew when their eyes were blind?  
Was God in town for the Roman games?  
Was he there when the deals were signed?  
  
Who are the kings in their coats of mail?  
Who road by the cross to die  
Did they all go down into worthiness?  
Is it wrong for a king to cry?  
And who are these ones who would have us now  
Whose presence in concealed  
Whose nature is revealed  
In a time bomb  
  
Last of all you old sea dogs  
Who travel after whale  
You'd storm the gates of hell itself  
For the taste of a mermaid's tail  
Who come from long lines of skippers  
Whose duty was fulfilled?  
In the words of a warrior's will  
And protocol
