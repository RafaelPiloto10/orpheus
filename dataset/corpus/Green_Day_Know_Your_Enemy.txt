Do you know the enemy?  
Do you know your enemy?  
Well, gotta know the enemy  
  
Do you know the enemy?  
Do you know your enemy?  
Well, gotta know the enemy  
  
Do you know the enemy?  
Do you know your enemy?  
Well, gotta know the enemy  
  
Violence is an energy  
Against the enemy  
Violence is an energy  
  
Bringing on the fury  
The choir infantry  
Revolt against the honor to obey  
  
Overthrow the effigy  
The vast majority  
While burning down the foreman of control  
  
Silence is an enemy  
Against your urgency  
So rally up the demons of your soul  
  
Do you know the enemy?  
Do you know your enemy?  
Well, gotta know the enemy  
  
Do you know the enemy?  
Do you know your enemy?  
Well, gotta know the enemy  
  
The insurgency will rise  
When the blood's been sacrificed  
Don't be blinded by the lies  
In your eyes  
  
Violence is an energy  
From here to eternity  
Violence is an energy  
Silence is an enemy  
So gimme gimme revolution  
  
Do you know the enemy?  
Do you know your enemy?  
Well, gotta know the enemy  
  
Do you know the enemy?  
Do you know your enemy?  
Well, gotta know the enemy  
  
Overthrow the effigy  
The vast majority  
We're burning down the foreman of control  
  
Silence is an enemy  
Against your urgency  
So rally up the demons of your soul
