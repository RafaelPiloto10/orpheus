I'm gonna pack up my pain,  
I been a keepin' in my heart,  
I'm gonna catch me the fastest train  
And make me a brand new start  
But that's okay,  
Tomorrow's gonna be another day,  
Hey, hey, hey.  
And I don't care what they say  
Tomorrow's gonna be, tomorrow's gonna be,  
Tomorrow's gonna be another day.  
Yay, yay, yay,  
Yay, yay, yay.  
  
They say there's a lotta fish,  
Swimmin' in the deep blue sea,  
I'm gonna catch me a pretty one  
And she'll be good to me.  
But that's okay,  
Tomorrow's gonna be another day,  
Hey, hey, hey.  
And I don't care what they say  
Tomorrow's gonna be, tomorrow's gonna be,  
Tomorrow's gonna be another day.  
Yay, yay, yay,  
Yay, yay, yay.  
  
Well, I ain't gonna think about ya,  
'Cause it ain't no use no more,  
I'm gonna make it fine without ya,  
Just like I did before,  
I'm on my way.  
Tomorrow's gonna be another day,  
Hey, hey, hey.  
And I don't care what they say  
Tomorrow's gonna be, tomorrow's gonna be,  
Tomorrow's gonna be another day.  
Yay, yay, yay,  
Yay, yay, yay.
