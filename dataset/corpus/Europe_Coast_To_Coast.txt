You look out that window  
For someone you know  
But it all looks the same and time and again  
It hurts you so  
You wonder if always  
You'll stand on your own  
But hear in your mind, you'll get through this time  
You're not alone  
  
When time seems so lonely  
And your day seems too long  
You wonder if you will ever get through  
And still be strong  
With eyes full of sadness  
You stand on your own  
It tears you apart, but you know in your heart  
You're not alone  
  
Coast to coast and land to land  
We're together hand in hand  
Coast to coast and land to land...
