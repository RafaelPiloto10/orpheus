I just don't know what to do tonight,  
My head is aching as I drink and breathe  
Memory falls like cream in my bones, moving on my own.  
  
There must be something I can dream tonight,  
The air is filled with the moves of you,  
All the fire is frozen yet still I have the will, ooh, ah.  
  
Trumpets, violins, I hear them in the distance  
And my skin emits a ray, but I think it's sad, it's much too bad  
That our friends can't be with us today
