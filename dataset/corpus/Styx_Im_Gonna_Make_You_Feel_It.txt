Every day I get the feeling  
When you move on down the street  
Wondering when I'll be your lover  
And you'll make my dream complete  
  
The way you walk is so inviting  
That I quiver and I shake  
The way you move it makes me wonder  
How much more can I take  
  
I'm gonna make you feel it  
Basically that's what I say  
I'm gonna make you feel it  
Cause you want it just that way  
  
Every time that we're together  
My head starts to rock and roll  
I get this strange electric feeling  
That I simply can't control  
  
I'm gonna make you feel it  
Basically that's what I say  
I'm gonna make you feel it  
Cause you want it just that way  
  
I'm gonna make you feel it  
I'm gonna make you feel it  
I'm gonna make you feel it
