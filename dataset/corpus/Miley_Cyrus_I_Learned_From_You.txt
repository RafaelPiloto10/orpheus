[Miley]  
Ooh  
Yeah  
I didn't wanna listen to what you were sayin'  
I thought that I knew all I need to know  
I didn't realize that somewhere inside me  
I knew you were right but I couldn't say so  
  
I can take care of myself, yeah, you taught me well  
  
[Chorus: (Miley)]  
I learned from you that I do not crumble  
I learned that strength is something you choose  
All of the reasons to keep on believin'  
There's no question, that's a lesson, that I learned from you  
  
[Billy Ray]  
We always don't agree on  
What is the best way  
To get to the place that we're going from here  
But I can really trust you, and give you the distance  
to make your decisions without any fear  
  
[Both]  
I'm grateful for all of the times  
You opened my eyes  
  
[Chorus: (Both)]  
I learned from you that I do not crumble  
I learned that strength is something you choose  
All of the reasons to keep on believin'  
There's no question, that's a lesson  
I learned from you  
  
[Both]  
You taught me to stand on my own  
  
[Miley] and I thank you for that  
  
[Both]  
You saved me, you made me,  
and now that I'm looking back  
  
[Miley] I can say  
  
[Both] woooaaahhhh!  
  
[Miley] Hmmmm... Hmmmm... Yeah!  
  
[Both]  
I learned from you that  
  
[Miley] I learned from you  
  
[Both]  
I do not crumble  
I learned that strength is something you choose  
  
[Miley] something you choose  
  
[Both]  
All of the reasons to keep on believin',  
  
[Miley] keep on believin'  
  
There's no question, that's a lesson that I learned from you  
  
[Miley]  
Woooaaahhhh!

[Billy Ray] something you choose
