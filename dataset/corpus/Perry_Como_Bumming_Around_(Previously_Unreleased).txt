I got an old slouch hat  
Got my roll on my shoulder  
I'm as free as a breeze  
And do as I please  
Just to bumming around  
  
Got a million friends  
I don't feel any older  
I've got nothing to lose  
Not even the blues  
Just to bumming around  
  
Whenever worries start  
To bothering me  
I grab my coat, my old slouch hat  
Hit the trail again  
  
You see, I ain't got a dime  
Don't care where I'm going  
I'm as free as a breeze  
And do as I please  
Just to bumming around  
  
I hit the trail again  
  
You see, I ain't got a dime  
Don't care where I'm going  
I'm as free as a breeze  
And do as I please  
Just to bumming around  
  
Just to bumming around  
Just to bumming around  
Just to bumming around
