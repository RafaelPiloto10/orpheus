I found the bones of all your ghosts  
Locked in the wishing well  
While bird song gourmets dragged empty nets  
I slumbered in my shell  
In mitternacht, die mensch-maschine  
Kissed me on my eyes  
I rose and left the fire-ladies  
Glowing lonely in the night  
With all the pornographers  
Burning torches beneath the sea  
  
[Chorus:]  
I want to be a machine  
I want to be a machine  
I want to be a machine  
I want to be a machine  
  
I stole a cathode face from newscasts  
And a crumbling fugue of songs  
From the reservoir of video souls  
In the lakes beneath my tongue  
In flesh of ash and silent movies  
I walked at boulevards again  
A nebula of unfinished creatures  
From the lifetimes of my friends  
I hope your innocence has depraved me  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Broadcast me, scrambled clean  
Or free me from this flesh  
Let the armchair cannibals take their fill  
In every cell across wilderness  
We'll trip such a strangled tango  
We'll waltz a wonderland affair  
Let's run to meet the tide tomorrow  
Leave all emotion dying there  
In the star cold beyond all of your dreams  
  
[Chorus:]  
Ah!
