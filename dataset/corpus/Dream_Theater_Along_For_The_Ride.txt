At this moment words fail me  
And my vision's unclear  
Blind to the truth  
Like hands reaching out in the darkness  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't stop the world from turning around  
Or the pull of the moon on the tide  
But I don't believe that we're in this alone  
I believe we're along for the ride  
I believe we're along for the ride  
  
Through the gift of surrender  
I'm embracing the fight  
Breaking the code  
There's clarity on the horizon  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't stop the world from turning around  
Or the pull of the moon on the tide  
But I don't believe that we're in this alone  
I believe we're along for the ride  
I believe we're along for the ride  
  
I will not live under a shadow of fear  
Never be crippled by chaos and doubt  
Fall prey to your madness  
  
I am not shattered  
Out of the ashes I rise  
Knowing that nothing is stronger than faith  
Finding hope in our hopeless lives  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't stop the world from turning around  
Or the pull of the moon on the tide  
But I don't believe that we're in this alone  
I believe we're along for the ride  
  
I can't stop the world from turning around  
Or the pull of the moon on the tide  
But I don't believe that we're in this alone  
I believe we're along for the ride  
I believe we're along for the ride  
I believe we're along for the ride
