I paid all my dues  
So I picked up my shoes  
I got up and walked away  
Oh, I was just a boy  
Giving it all away  
I didn't know how to play  
I've worked hard and failed  
Now all I can say is  
I threw it all away  
Oh, I was just a boy  
Giving it all away  
Sail away, sail away  
Ooh, well I know better now,  
I know better now  
Giving it all away  
Oh oh, I now better now,  
I know better now  
I've given it all away  
Went out in the world  
Too much for my nerves  
Well, only myself to blame  
See, I was just a boy  
And there was nobody else to blame  
I've done all I can  
Now it's out of my hands  
Stand on my head and say  
Oh, I was just a boy  
Giving it all away  
Sail away, yeah sail away  
Oh, I know better now,  
I know better now  
Ain't gonna give it all away  
Oh oh, yeah yeah, I now better now,  
I know better now  
Ain't gonna give it all away  
Ooh, I know better now  
I know better now  
I've given it all away  
See I was just a boy  
Giving it all away  
I was just a boy  
Giving it all away  
Oh, I know better now  
Giving it all away  
I was just a boy
