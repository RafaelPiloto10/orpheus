I need light, I need light to find my way around this house  
I'm turning on the chandelier  
Nice bright light for me to see  
Little footsteps coming from the hallway  
Oh.. No.. The lights are flickering  
Oh.. No.. The lights are out  
In the black of night, oh it's so hard to see  
In the Black of night, I see the moon  
In the black of night, oh the moon is full  
Ha -ha.. In the black of night, oh it's so hard to see  
In the Black of night, I see the moon  
In the black of night, oh the moon is full  
My black cat Magic  
Mesmerized by something in the hallway  
Who's to say what's living in the Darkness?  
Who is to say if a black cat can sense it?  
I need light, I need light to find my way around this house  
Oh.. There's a candle  
Just a little light.. So I can see again  
Little footsteps coming from the hallway  
Auu.. Auu.. Something hit me on the head  
Auu.. Auu. There it is again  
In the black of night, oh it's so hard to see  
In the Black of night, I see the moon  
In the black of night, oh the moon is full  
In the black of night, oh it's so hard to see
