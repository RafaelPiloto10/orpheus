Tommy gun  
You ain't happy less you got one  
Tommy gun  
Ain't gonna shoot the place up  
Just for fun  
Maybe he wants to die for the money  
Maybe he wants to kill for his country  
Whatever he wants, he's gonna get it!  
  
Tommy gun  
You better strip it down for a customs run  
Tommy gun  
Waiting in the airport 'till kingdom come  
An' we can watch you make it  
On the nine o'clock news  
Standing there in palestine lighting the fuse  
Whatever you want, you're gonna get it  
  
Tommy gun  
You'll be dead when your war is won  
Tommy gun  
But did you have to gun down everyone?  
I can see it's kill or be killed  
A nation of destiny has got to be fulfilled  
Whatever you want, you're gonna get it!  
  
Tommy gun  
You can be a hero in an age of none  
Tommy gun  
I'm cutting out your picture from page one  
I'm gonna get a jacket just like yours  
An' give my false support to your cause  
Whatever you want, you're gonna get it!  
  
Boats an' tanks and planes, it's your game  
Kings an' queens an' general learn your name  
I see all the innocents, the human sacrifice  
And if death comes so cheap  
Then the same goes for life
