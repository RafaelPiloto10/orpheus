The wash is out, it's hanging up  
And all I have is nothing  
Nothing to do, nothing to say  
I think I must be dreaming  
  
The sun comes up and I'm all washed out  
Is this what Deaner was talkin' about  
I don't think I will ever return again my friend  
  
If I was king I'd wear a ring  
And never hurt my people  
I'd stay alert and dress to kill  
I might even slip you something  
  
The sun comes up and I'm all washed out  
Is this what Deaner was talkin' about  
I don't think I will ever return again my friend  
  
The sun comes up and I'm all washed out  
Is this what Deaner was talkin' about  
I don't think I will ever return again my friend  
I do not think I will ever return again, my friend [2x]
