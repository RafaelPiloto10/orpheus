(Original by Cracker)  
  
Sometimes I wanna take you down.  
Sometimes I wanna get you low.  
Brush your hair back from your eyes.  
Take you down let the river flow.  
Sometimes I go and walk the street  
Behind the green sheet of glass.  
A million miles below their feet  
A million miles, a million miles  
CHORUS:  
I'll be with you girl  
Like being low  
Hey hey hey like being stoned.  
I'll be with you girl  
Like being low  
Hey hey hey like being stoned.  
A million poppies gonna make me sleep.  
Just one rose and knows your name  
The fruit is rusting on the vine  
The fruit is calling from the trees  
Hey don't you wanna go down  
Like some junkie cosmonaut  
A million miles below their feet  
A million miles a million miles  
CHORUS  
Blue blue is the sun.  
Brown brown is the sky.  
Green green of her eyes.  
A million miles a million miles  
Hey hey don't you wanna go down  
Like some disgraced cosmonaut  
A million miles below their feet  
A million miles a million miles  
CHORUS
