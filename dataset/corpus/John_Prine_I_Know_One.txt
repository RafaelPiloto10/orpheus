When all your loves have ended  
When all your friends have flown  
Who'll be around to want you  
When all your loves have gone  
Only a fool would do it  
After the way you've done  
But how many fools would have you I know one  
  
This fool keeps wonderin' why  
He fell in love at all  
But you might need this fool  
Around in case you fall  
  
After the party's over  
And you've had your fill of fun  
If you need a fool to forgive you I know one  
  
You never know, you might be lonely  
When all your loves have missed  
It wouldn't hurt to keep an extra  
Fool on your list.  
  
After your heart's been broken  
And you need a place to run  
If you'll take a fool who loves you  
I know one  
I know one  
I know one
