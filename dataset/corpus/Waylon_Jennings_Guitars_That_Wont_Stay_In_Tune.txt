Well I grew up lean and hungry I worked hard for my money  
Said I'm gonna live my life the way I please  
Spent some time on the road of life saw an angel once and the devil twice  
I came across some things that I don't need  
  
Like a cold hearted women whiskey in my water  
And only one way out of a motel room  
Payments on the Cadillac and too many questions  
And old guitars that just won't stay in tune  
  
You know there's good and bad breaks you learn from your mistakes  
It's all in how you handle them do's and don'ts  
A hillbilly boy is hard to convince wild and stubborn and not much sense  
But I've got enough to know what I don't want  
  
Like a cold hearted women whiskey in my water...  
And old guitars that just won't stay in tune
