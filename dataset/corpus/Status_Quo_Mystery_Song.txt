I see that look on your face  
I see that look on your face  
I see that look on your face, oh-oh-oh  
  
The boys know what you're giving, you give the boys such a lot of fun  
And by the way that you make a living you've got the boys all on the run  
S.T.'s showing, you really got me going maybe you can give me a price  
I want to try it, yeah I want to buy it, tell me would you treat me nice  
Oh my legs are shaking, oh my heart is breaking  
I'm just feeling like a boy  
Now I just can't slow down, gotta get in, go down  
Have my share of what a joy  
  
Now I've got your name and number, I like to look upon your face  
And now you know that I want to take you, give me the time you can name  
the place  
Call me honey, you can take my money, baby we can make a deal  
I really mean it, gotta get between it, do you know the way I feel?  
Oh I'm feeling kinda like I've gotta find a way to make you understand  
Oh I know you're lying and your love I'm buying  
Oh I'm feeling like a man  
  
The boys know what you're giving, you give the boys such a lot of fun  
And by the way that you make a living you've got the boys all on the run  
S.T.'s showing, really got them going, you can even say the price  
They'll want to try it, even want to buy it if you really treat them nice  
But I'd rather take you, show that I can make you  
Good enough for just one man  
Oh I'm feeling kinda like I've gotta find a  
Way to make you understand
