Well, if you're ever in los angeles  
And you've got time to spare  
Take a stroll up sunset boulevard  
You'll find the whiskey there  
Gliding round the tables  
With wounderous natural ease  
Serving two-star brandy  
Is the body you have to see...all belonging to  
  
Long-legged linda  
She sure was worth the flight  
Long-legged linda is playing the whiskey  
Tonight  
  
Oh don't boogie-woogie with linda  
'tho she dances like a dream  
She acts like she's a thousand  
But she's barely sweet sixten  
She re-arranged my brain-cells  
And took control of me  
So if I miss my plain to jacksonville  
You can guess where I'll still be...i'll be diggin'
