Everywhere is freaks and hairies  
Dykes and fairies, tell me where is sanity  
Tax the rich, feed the poor  
Till there are no rich no more?  
  
I'd love to change the world  
But I don't know what to do  
So I'll leave it up to you  
  
Population keeps on breeding  
Nation bleeding, still more feeding economy  
Life is funny, skies are sunny  
Bees make honey, who needs money, Monopoly  
  
I'd love to change the world  
But I don't know what to do  
So I'll leave it up to you  
  
World pollution, there's no solution  
Institution, electrocution  
Just black and white, rich or poor  
Them and us, stop the war  
  
I'd love to change the world  
But I don't know what to do  
So I'll leave it up to you
