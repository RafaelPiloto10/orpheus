Damn it's been  
Something  
Like three years since we came to amends  
Goodness I  
  
Didn't realize  
It's been that long  
But anyways  
So good to  
  
Hear that you  
Moved on and found somebody new  
So have I  
Still baby  
Something is wrong  
  
(You don't have)  
(To answer this)  
(If its too personal)  
Don't worry bout it  
  
(Do your thoughts)  
(Of me ever)  
(Become sexual)  
Do I ever cross your mind  
  
(Ever reminisce of us)  
(On the bathroom floor)  
Or the counter maybe in the tub or even on the sink  
'cause lately what's been happening  
  
Is When I'm with my girl (I call your name)  
And it just ain't right  
That I'll be sexin' her and I (I call your name)  
And it just ain't right  
  
Girl it ain't no little thing that I (I call your name)  
And it just ain't right  
Do you ever do the same 'cause I (I call your name)  
And it just ain't right  
  
Needless to  
Say to you  
Me and my girl are almost through  
Seems that she  
  
Thinks that I'm not over us  
(That's crazy ain't it)  
But anyway  
Just called to see  
  
(If you was experiencin') the same as me  
'Cause if so  
We got some things to discuss  
  
(You don't have)  
(To answer this)  
(If its too personal)  
If it's too personal

(On the bathroom floor)  
Or the counter maybe in the tub or even on the sink  
'Cause lately what's been happening  
  
And When I'm with my girl (I call your name)  
And it just ain't right

The truth  
Could we still be in love... (Could we be in love)  
  
Think of you  
Though that I know it ain't right  
Said do you think of me  
When you lay with him at night  
  
It's not that I'm lonely baby  
But I just can't help myself...  
I don't know if I'm still in love with you girl  
But when I'm laying with her, girl I call your name  
  
When I'm with my girl (I call your name)  
And it just ain't right  
That I'll be sexin' her and I (I call your name)  
And it just ain't right

And it just ain't right  
Do you ever do the same (I call your name)  
And it just ain't right
