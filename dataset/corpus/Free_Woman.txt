Carry me away  
I know your angel eye can see through me  
Carry me away  
Far away from the love you give so generously  
So generously  
  
Woman, oh oh  
Listen  
  
I got a burning heart  
I need to tell you that it's you I love  
I got a burning heart  
I need to tell you that I'll never get enough  
Never, never, never, never get enough, ooh babe  
  
Woman, oh oh  
  
Yeah, marry me today  
I'll give you all I own except my car  
Marry me today, baby  
I'll give you everything but my guitar  
But my guitar and my car  
  
Woman, oh oh  
Listen  
  
Let me hold your tongue  
For I know you'll understand the way I feel  
Baby, I know you'll understand  
That all I wanna do is take your hand  
  
I don't mean to do you no harm, baby  
I just wanna be your man  
Oh, I just wanna be your man, baby  
Lord, I wanna be, I wanna be  
Hey, woman, I'll be your man  
Woman, I'll be your man, yeah
