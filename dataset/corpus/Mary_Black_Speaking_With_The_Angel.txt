He don't know how to lie  
Or undermine you  
He don't know how to steal  
How to deal or deceive  
So leave him alone, set him free  
Cause he's speaking with the angel  
That only he can see  
  
You say he's so helpless  
Well what about you  
You don't pull the strings  
Don't you know anything  
Just leave him alone, let him be  
Cause he's speaking with the angel  
That only he can see  
  
Would you teach him about heaven  
Would you show him how to love the earth  
Would you poison him with prejudice  
From the moment of his birth  
  
He in the name of love  
He in the blood of the lamb  
He that never lays blame  
He don't even know his name  
Just leave him alone, let him be  
Cause he's speaking with the angel  
Speaking with the angel  
The very one that spoke to you and me  
Oh do you remember?
