Well, when I walk, when I walk  
Walk my horse upon a hill  
Well, when I walk, walk, walk, walk  
Walk my horse upon a hill  
When I lay me down  
Will my lover love me still?  
  
A dog is here  
A dog is there  
My dog, he got three legs  
But he can't run  
  
Well, when I thought, well, I thought  
When I thought you was my friend  
When I thought, well, I thought  
When I thought you was my friend  
But you let me down, ho  
Put my heart around the bend  
  
A fly flies in  
A fly flies out  
Most flies they got three legs  
But mine got one  
  
Well, when I fly, when I fly, when I fly  
When I fly above the clouds  
Oh, when I fly, when I fly, when I fly  
When I fly above the clouds  
You can knock me down with a feather, yes, you could  
But you know it's not allowed  
  
A dog is here  
A dog is there  
My dog, he got three legs  
But he can't run  
  
My dog he got three legs, your dog he got none  
My dog he got three legs, your dog he got none  
My dog he got three legs, your dog he got none
