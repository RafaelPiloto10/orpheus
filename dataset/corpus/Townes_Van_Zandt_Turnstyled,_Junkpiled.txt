Well, I've been turn-styled,  
Junk-piled  
And railroaded too  
I've been laid low  
But don't you know  
I'm still in love with you  
I've been took down many a road  
If anybody says I ain't day lie  
But ain't got no plans  
Except to be your man  
And love you 'til I die  
  
Well you got me under your spell  
Won't you tell  
Me all 'bout your wonderful charms  
I got time to burn  
And a lot to learn  
Mama, take me in your lovin' arms  
Well, I know that probably  
You feel quite oddly  
'Bout you hear say  
But if you hold me tight  
It's gonna be all right  
Mama, chase my blues away
