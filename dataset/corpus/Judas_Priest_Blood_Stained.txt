Atrocities  
Made every day  
Religiously  
Their sins  
They hide  
Can never disguise  
  
Blood stained hands  
Blood stained times  
Blood stained deeds  
Blood stained lies  
  
They wage their wars  
Such profiteers  
Will nail us all  
Their crimes  
Concealed  
Despicably reveal  
  
Blood stained hands  
Blood stained times  
Blood stained weapons  
Blood stained lies  
  
They fire at will  
Intent to kill  
They have no conscience  
They have no conscience  
  
Ethnic cleansing nothing more!  
Blood of nations blood of war  
  
Turn blind eyes  
From all your crimes  
You bare our souls  
Show no remorse  
You cannot wash  
The bloodstains off  
  
They turn their backs  
While others  
Commit grisly acts  
We're scared  
For life  
By politicians' greedy  
  
Blood stained hands  
Blood stained times  
Blood stained weapons  
Blood stained crimes  
Blood stained lands  
Blood stained minds  
Blood stained deeds  
Blood stained lies  
  
And while such predators  
Stalk this earth  
Disguised as saints  
They kill our faith  
  
Obsessed by greed  
Lying through their teeth  
They cannot wash  
The blood stains off
