When time was young we walked the roads together  
When love was sweet I meant the world to you  
Now comes the sun we'll say goodbye forever  
And teardrops will kiss the morning dew  
  
Take me and make me your lover one more time  
Close in your arms as before  
'Til o'er your shoulder the early morning shines  
Then I'll leave you and grieve you no more  
  
When time was young we walked the roads together  
When love was sweet I meant the world to you  
Now comes the sun we'll say goodbye forever  
And teardrops will kiss the morning dew  
  
Daises need sunshine and roses need rain  
So it was all meant to be  
A wild bird needs wings, free to take to the wind  
And so it was meant for you and me  
  
When time was young we walked the roads together  
When love was sweet I meant the world to you  
Now comes the sun we'll say goodbye forever  
And teardrops will kiss the morning dew  
  
Teardrops will kiss the morning dew
