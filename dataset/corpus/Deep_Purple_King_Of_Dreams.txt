It doesn't matter if I'm right or wrong  
It really doesn't mean a thing  
It doesn't matter if you like my song  
As long as you can hear me sing  
'Cause I'm the thorn in every little girl's rose  
You know I cut but never bleed  
A shadow in the night, pure delight  
I can satisfy your every need  
  
I'm a real smooth dancer, I'm fantasy man  
Master of illusion, magic touch in my hand  
All the stages are empty when I steal the scenes  
A beggar of love, second hand hero  
King of Dreams  
  
Don't make a difference what you got  
It doesn't matter what you lose  
Don't make a difference if you like it or not  
Baby I'm gonna change your attitude  
'Cause all around me there is mystery and wonder  
Now can't you see it in my eyes  
I'll crack the sky, make you feel the thunder  
You'll never see through my disguise  
  
I'm a real smooth dancer, I'm fantasy man  
Master of illusion, with my sleight of hand  
All the stages are empty when I steal the scenes  
A beggar for love, second hand hero  
King of Dreams  
  
All around, all around  
Emotional squeeze through again and again  
I know how to please you, your mind is on the bend  
Can't you feel the power, surrender in my arms  
Beyond the witching hour we're traveling on and on  
  
I'm a real smooth dancer, I'm fantasy man  
Master of illusion, magic touch in my hand  
The stages are empty when I steal the scenes  
A beggar of love, second hand hero  
King of Dreams  
  
I'm a real smooth dancer, fantasy man  
Master of illusion, sleight of hand  
The stages are empty when I steal the scenes  
A beggar for love  
King of Dreams
