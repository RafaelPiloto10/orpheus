Am I free  
Am I done believing  
Oh God Jehovah  
I've never known religion  
  
Lost in the darkness of my memories  
Deep in the darkness of my heart  
Coiled in the grass's that torment me  
There lyes my serpents in the dark  
  
Father, I'm here in the dark  
And I know it's forever night  
Oh tell me can you change forever  
My wicked heart  
Father I'm here in the dark  
And I know my heart is the darkness  
Oh tell me can you claim me never  
My wicked heart  
Because nothing can change  
My wicked heart  
Nothing can tame  
My wicked Heart  
Nothing unchains  
My wicked heart  
  
Am I too far  
Beyond forgiving  
A borrowed soul  
Ain't never known believing  
  
Lost in the dark can you forgive me  
Deep in the darkenss of my heart  
Coiled in the grass's that torment me  
There lies mt serpents in the dark
