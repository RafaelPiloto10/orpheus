Earth is our mother  
Just turning around  
With her trees in the forest  
And roots underground  
  
Our father above us  
Whose sigh is the wind  
Paint us a rainbow  
Without any end  
  
As the river runs freely  
The mountain does rise  
Let me touch with my fingers  
And see with my eyes  
  
In the hearts of the children  
A pure love still grows  
Like a bright star in Heaven  
That lights our way home  
  
Like the flower that shattered the stone  
A sparrow finds freedom  
Beholding the sun  
In the infinite beauty  
  
We're all joined in one  
I reach out before me  
And look to the sky  
Did I hear someone whisper  
  
Did something pass by  
As the river runs freely  
The mountain does rise  
Let me touch with my fingers  
  
And see with my eyes  
In the hearts of the children  
A pure love still grows  
Like a bright star in Heaven  
  
That lights our way home  
Like the flower that shattered the stone  
Like a bright star in Heaven  
That lights our way home  
  
Like the flower that shattered the stone
