Queen for a day, queen for a night  
Dressed head to toe, so you'd never know it's me, it's me  
  
Ribbons and lace, shoes made of glass  
Rouge on my face, off to the dance  
To dance  
  
To dance and dance and dance and dance  
Queen for a day, queen for a day  
  
Queen for a day, queen for a night  
Just time to find the man who could be so right  
  
Queen for a day, ribbons and lace  
Shoes made of glass, rouge on my face  
  
To dance and dance and dance and dance  
And dance the night away  
Gonna dance the night away  
Gonna be a queen for a day  
Want to dance the night away  
What I'd give to be a queen for a day  
Gonna dance and dance and dance  
Gonna dance and dance and dance  
  
Queen for a day, queen for a day  
Queen for a day, queen for a day  
  
Queen for a day, queen for a night  
Just time to find the man who could be  
So right, so right  
  
Queen for a day, queen for a night  
Ribbons and lace suit me just fine  
So fine, so fine  
  
I shall be queen for a day  
I shall be queen for a day  
Can you make me a queen for a day  
Queen for a day
