Someone point me in the right direction  
Tell me where's the nearest piece of mind?  
I'm going crazy  
  
Knight in shining armor in the distance  
He sees the angel threatening my life  
Why won't he save me?  
  
All I want is somebody to give a damn  
Notice that I'm struggling and lend a hand  
They say  
Everybody needs someone to understand  
Well damnit that includes me too  
  
And all I want is someone to be there for me  
Someone that genuinely cares  
But I'm just dreaming  
It's like I'm silently screaming  
  
Even though I'm totally surrounded  
I feel like I'm in here by myself  
  
How about you do it cuz you love me?  
Not cuz you want something in return  
Is that so crazy?  
Crazy  
  
In the middle of the sea of helpless  
But see, I never learned how to swim  
Somebody save me  
Somebody save me  
  
All I want is somebody to give a damn  
Notice that I'm struggling and lend a hand  
They say  
Everybody needs someone to understand  
Well damnit that includes me too  
  
And all I want is someone to be there for me  
Someone that genuinely cares  
But I'm just dreaming  
It's like I'm silently screaming  
  
Somebody to catch me when I fall  
Somebody to help me through it all  
Someone I can trust  
Tell me if I'm asking too much  
  
All I want is somebody to give a damn  
Notice that I'm struggling and lend a hand  
They say  
Everybody needs someone to understand  
Well damnit that includes me too  
  
All I want is someone to be there for me  
Someone that I can genuinely trust  
But I'm just dreaming  
It's like I'm silently screaming  
  
Even though I'm totally surrounded  
  
Silently screaming  
  
I feel like I'm in here by myself  
  
Silently screaming
