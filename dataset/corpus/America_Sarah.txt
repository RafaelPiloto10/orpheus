Sarah, please  
Where is the love you said you'd save for me  
Am I a fool to think that something's strange  
I think you've changed  
  
Golly, dad  
She was the best thing that I ever had  
Torn and battered now and due for repair  
But she's not there  
  
What does it matter and who really cares  
With no one to turn to when she's not there  
Ah, but it's all right, I'll get by  
  
Miles apart  
Left here standing with a broken heart  
Call me names but I'll refuse to cry  
Don't ask my why  
  
What does it matter and who really cares  
With no one to turn to when she's not there  
Ah, but it's all right, I'll get by
