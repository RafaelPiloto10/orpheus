Welcome to Forgotten Freshness Volume 3  
  
Draw something make sure you don't forget your red pen  
cause we gonna need it when you draw the blood in  
ps-ps-ps-psychopathic records baby all offensive powers  
our plane's high-jacked, head for record label towers  
drink of choice, Faygo, rock-n-rye with hennesey  
i like marijuana that is sent from tennessee  
I'm sick of rock guitars always lacin' our shit  
we bout to get wicked for the sixth (the sixth), the sixth (the sixth)  
I like cuttin' heads off, blood trail through the house  
down to the basement where I hollow them out  
(???) (???) dont't you reach for the phone  
I'm gonna cut you up and voodoo drums with your bones  
  
CHROUS:  
Cartoon Nightmares!  
Science fiction, brain incision.  
Cartoon Nightmares!  
Satellites and televisions.  
Won't you draw me?  
Liquid lines of (technicolor) color.  
I will hurry right there.  
(walk like an) Egyptian.  
  
Im like Richard Remeriz (the stalker)  
and I didn't even know it  
Of course I mean without the ACDC and the money  
Local Rappers from my city they wanna talk smack  
But they be so wack they aint worth dissing back  
(Worth Yo (???)) Nope  
Break yo head, pull out ya brain  
pass it down the line, we call it the train  
Look at that girl (2x)  
Booty in the pants (2x)  
Shakin that thing (2x)  
Like WHUT WHUT WHUT WHUT  
If you were Andre The Giant, that shit would be slick  
You could finger fuck a girl and she would think it's your dick  
Blood ozes down the screen  
Off the page and magazine  
Off the table to the floor  
Cross the tile out tha door  
  
CHORUS  
  
ICP headin back to St. Louis  
Nelly scoot over, me and shaggy bout to do this  
There's an arm in my trunk (Whaa)  
An arm in my trunk (Where)  
Underneath the tire there's an arm in my trunk  
I've seem to recognize this plaaaace  
up in county jail  
yes I recall, STALE  
Me and Jumpsteady killa hookers at night  
check my bumper hell if (??????) and blood in the light  
Me and Billy Bill, we put a arm in shaggy's trunk  
He woulda never noticed, but it stunk soo bad...  
There's an arm in my trunk ( HEY YOU)  
Gimme a subway bun (Yeaaa)  
knuckel deep in mayo like yumm  
  
CHORUS  
Cartoon Nightmares, (Walk Like An Egyptian)  
Cartoon Nightmares, (Walk Like An Egyptian)  
Won't you draw me  
Cartoon Nightmares, (Walk Like An Egyptian)  
I will hurry right there  
Cartoon Nightmares, (Walk Like An Egyptian)  
Cartoon Nightmares, (Walk Like An Egyptian)  
Cartoon Nightmares, (Walk Like An Egyptian)
