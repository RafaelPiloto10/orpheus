I got your love  
You need to look no further  
Don't you know that  
Don't you know that  
  
After my love  
You'll never need another  
Don't you know that  
Don't you know that  
  
I don't make no promises I can't keep  
And I promised myself that I'd love you forever  
How many times must I say that  
For you to understand the real thing  
  
Don't you know that I love you so  
Baby, don't you know  
Don't you know that  
I love you so, ooh, don't you know  
Don't you know that  
Oh  
  
Without a doubt  
You are my sweetest inspiration  
Don't you know that  
Don't you know that  
  
I'm always down  
For anything that you say  
Don't you know that  
Don't you know that  
  
I love you so, yeah  
I really love you, don't you know, yeah  
Don't you know that  
Alright, don't you know that  
  
I really, really do, yeah  
I'm really so in love with you, yeah  
Don't you know that  
Alright, ooh, yeah  
  
I used to doubt every girl that I'd meet  
I thought that nobody could knock me off my feet  
But you are the one who made my heart's bell ring  
And that's why I'm sure that this is the real thing, yeah  
  
Don't you know that I love  
Don't you know, ooh, ooh  
Oh, don't you know that I love  
Don't you know, oh, yeah  
Don't you know that I love you so  
Don't you know that  
I bet a million dollars that you know  
  
Don't you know that  
Hey, baby, really don't you know that  
Ooh, don't you know that  
Don't you know I, don't you know I love you  
  
Don't you know that  
Hey, baby, really don't you know that  
I love you, I'm in love  
Ooh, ooh, I love  
  
Don't you know that  
Hey, baby, really don't you know that  
Don't you know that  
Don't you know that  
  
Don't you know that  
Hey, baby, really don't you know that  
Don't you know, don't you know  
That I love  
  
Don't you know that  
Hey, baby, really don't you know that  
Don't you know that  
Don't you know that  
  
Don't you know that  
Hey, baby, really don't you know that
