Left New Hyde Park  
to hold my own in New York Town  
Groped in the dark  
Until I faced a place where scallywags are found  
Sharks and yo-yos everywhere  
I think you can take it from there  
Now there's a horse in town  
I scream: Honey it's just a clown  
Yes there's a horse in town  
Saddle up and ride, ride, ride  
Can you reveal  
The day you came, the day you'll go  
This way I feel  
The time is moving much too slow  
And it passes by your chair  
If you laugh at my despair  
[Chorus]  
[Solo]  
The shoes of my friend  
They stamp the nail into the ground  
Let's not pretend  
We know we've all had fearsome style  
Following my frozen trail  
Moving to the inside rail  
[Chorus]
