We were born in this little town  
Growin' up I was countin' down  
Every single day  
'Til we made our get away  
But you said you could never see yourself  
Tryin' to make a life anywhere else  
This would be your home  
And I was on my own  
  
But ever since you said good bye  
I've been out here on the wind  
And baby you would be surprised  
All the places you have been  
I've seen you in  
  
[Chorus]  
Albuquerque  
Waitin' out a blizzard  
Arizona  
Dancin' 'cross the desert  
Watchin' the sun set in Monterey  
Girl I swear just the other day you were  
Down in Georgia  
Pickin' them peaches  
In Carolina  
Barefoot on the beaches  
No matter where you choose to be  
In my heart I'll always see you  
  
Everywhere  
  
Now days  
When I'm passin' through  
The conversation always turns to you  
And I hear you're doin' fine  
Livin' out by the county line  
Got a man that's home every night  
A couple of kids and the kind of life  
That you want to lead  
Guess you could say the same for me  
But you and I  
Made our choices  
All those years ago  
Still I know  
I'll hear your voice  
And see you down the road  
  
Maybe in  
Oklahoma  
Drivin' 'cross the prairie  
In Dallas, Texas  
Isn't that where we  
Always said we would  
Like to try  
Never did  
So maybe that's why you're on  
Every highway  
Just beyond the high-beams  
Right beside me  
In all of my sweet dreams  
No matter where you choose to be  
In my heart I'll always see you  
In  
  
[Chorus]
