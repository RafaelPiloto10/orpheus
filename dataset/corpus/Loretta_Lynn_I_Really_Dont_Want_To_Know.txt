How many arms have held you and hated to let you go  
How many how many I wonder no I really don't want to know  
How many lips have kissed you and set your heart aglow  
How many how many I wonder but I really don't want to know  
So always make me wonder always make me guess  
And even if I ask you oh darling don't confess  
Just let it remain your secret cause darling I love you so  
No wonder no wonder I wonder no I really don't want to know  
No I really don't want to know
