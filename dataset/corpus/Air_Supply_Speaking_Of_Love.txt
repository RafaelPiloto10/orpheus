I've been in love, I've walked alone  
I turned to you, but you were gone  
I felt the doubt, it hurt me inside  
Without your help, my hands are tied  
  
You are my home, my place to go  
My faith returned, you told me so  
I feel you now, I'm standing beside you  
Do you hear me calling  
It's to remind you, if you find me falling  
  
Hold me in your arms,  
Tell me that you want me  
Whisper all the words  
That dreams are made of  
Hold me in your arms  
Tell me are we speaking of love  
  
Don't leave me know, I've come so far  
To hear your voice, speak from your heart  
I hear you now, you're standing beside me  
Do you hear me calling  
It's to remind you, if you find me falling  
  
Hold me in your arms  
Tell me that you want me  
Whisper all the words,  
That dreams are made of  
Hold me in your arms  
Tell me are we speaking of love
