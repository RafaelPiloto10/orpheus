I can't imagine why you say the things you do  
Maybe in time I'll understand  
What is the reason for the emptiness you feel  
When I'm trying everything I can  
  
My love is running deeper than the night  
Stronger than the north wind blowing  
It's a fire burning bright  
And it's always been this way  
  
Can you hear me?  
Am I really coming through?  
Why do your eyes seem to dance away?  
I know what's right for you, haven't I always?  
I need you more than I can say  
  
My love is running deeper than the night  
Stronger than the north wind blowing  
It's a fire burning bright  
And it's always been this way  
  
My love is running deeper than the night  
Stronger than the north wind blowing  
It's a fire burning bright  
And it's always been this way  
  
And I'll never ever change  
In my life time, I'll stay the same  
Yes I'll never, I'll never change  
I'll love you, I'll stay the same  
  
My love is running  
[Deeper than the night  
Stronger than the north wind blowing  
Fire burning bright  
And it keeps on growing  
Keeps on growing]
