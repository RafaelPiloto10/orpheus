I've been stopping at green lights,  
Got lost on my way home,  
Sleep walking at night,  
I put my shirt on inside out,  
  
Umbrella in the sun,  
My head up in the clouds,  
My friends just laugh at me,  
There's only one thing it could be  
  
I've come down with love  
Got bit by the bug,  
I'm sick and I feel confused  
I know it's true  
  
I've come down with love,  
I can't get enough,  
I wont break this fever,  
I need her I'm bit by the bug  
  
I've come down with love,  
I've come down with love  
  
You got me trippin' on my feet,  
My mind starts racing  
And my heart forgets beat,  
When you start to walk my way  
  
I forget where I am,  
Can't find a word to say,  
My friends just laugh at me,  
There's no cure for this disease  
  
I've come down with love,  
Got bit by the bug,  
I'm sick and I feel confused,  
I know it's true  
  
I've come down with love,  
I can't get enough,  
I wont break this fever  
I need her I'm bit by the bug  
  
I've come down with love,  
I've come down with love  
  
Don't need a shot,  
Don't need a doctor  
They can't make me ok  
It's up to you  
  
Give me an answer,  
Because I'm trying just to see you,  
Only want to feel you,  
Dying just to hear you say,  
  
I've come down with love,  
Got bit by the bug,  
I'm sick and I feel confused,  
I know it's true  
  
I've come down with love,  
Got bit by the bug,  
I'm sick and I feel confused,  
I know it's true  
  
I've come down with love,  
I can't get enough,  
I'm sick and I feel confused,  
I know it's true  
  
I've come down with love,  
Got bit by the bug,  
I wont break this fever,  
I need her I'm bit by the bug  
  
I've come down with love,  
I've come down with love,  
I've come down with love,  
I've come down with love,  
We've come down with love!
