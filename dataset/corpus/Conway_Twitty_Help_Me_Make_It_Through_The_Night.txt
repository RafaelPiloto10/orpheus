Take the ribbons from your hair  
Shake it loose and let it fall  
Laying soft upon your skin  
Like the flowers on the wall.  
  
Come and lay here by my side  
Till the early morning light  
All I'm taking is your time  
Help me make it through the night.  
  
I don't care who's right or wrong  
And I don't try to understand  
Let the devil take tomorrow  
'Cause Lord, tonight I need a friend.  
  
Yesterday is dead and gone  
And tomorrow's out of sight  
And it's sad to be alone  
Help me make it through the night.  
  
I don't care who's right or wrong  
I don't try to understand  
Let the devil take tomorrow  
Lord, you know tonight I need a friend.  
  
Yesterday is dead and gone  
And tomorrow's out of sight  
And it's sad to be alone  
Help me make it through the night.  
  
You know it's sad to be alone  
Help me make it through the night...
