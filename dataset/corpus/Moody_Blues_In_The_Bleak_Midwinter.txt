In the bleak midwinter  
Frosty wind may blow  
Earth stood hard as iron  
Water like a stone  
Snow had fallen, snow on snow  
Snow on snow on snow  
In the bleak midwinter  
Long, long ago  
What can I give him?  
Poor as I am  
If I were a shepherd  
I would bring a lamb  
If I were a wise man  
I would do my part  
Yet what I can, I give him  
Give my heart  
Snow had fallen, snow on snow  
Snow on snow on snow  
In the bleak midwinter  
Long, long ago
