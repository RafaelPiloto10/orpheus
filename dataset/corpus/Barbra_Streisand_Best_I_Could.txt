I can't apologize for the way I feel  
Cause I've always been honest with you  
I've loved you the best I could  
In the only way I knew  
And If that's not enough I've got nothin' to say  
And I'm not even sure that I would  
Somedays it was bad and somedays good  
But I've loved you the best I could  
  
I need more... I need someone to hold me tonight  
Someone there when I turn out the lights  
Just to be here with me  
I need more...  
I need more than you somehow  
I need more than your time will allow  
I want you as my friend  
Why can't you be that now?  
  
You say you need me, then you'd be gone  
The times I needed you  
Then you'd hold me and say you're sorry  
But what else could you do?  
Yet I know you really loved me  
So it's hard to let go like I should  
Let's forget the bad  
Remember the good  
Cause you loved me the best you could  
  
But I need more  
I need someone to hold me tonight  
Someone there when I turn out the light  
Just to be here with me  
I need more, I need more than you somehow  
I need more than your time will allow  
Remember the times that were good  
We both loved the best we could
