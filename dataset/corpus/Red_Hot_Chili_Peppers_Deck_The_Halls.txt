Anything we should know about your change?  
Hahahaha  
You start by doing that first, okay?  
Okay, here we go  
Deck Deck  
(Not yet, not yet)  
(Deck, Deck...)  
(No, if you...)  
(De...De...)  
  
Deck the halls  
With boughs of holly  
Fa, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la  
'Tis the season  
To be jolly  
Fa, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la  
  
Don we now  
Our gay apparel  
Fa, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la  
Something something  
Yule tide carol  
Fa la la la la  
La la la la  
  
Merry Christmas!  
Good night Detroit!
