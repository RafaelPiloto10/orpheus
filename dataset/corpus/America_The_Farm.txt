We're feedin' the world but we can't feed ourselves  
They tell us don't plant now but there's nothing on the shelves  
If someone is watchin' down from above  
What in the world is he thinkin' of  
Daisy I think we must sell the farm  
And you know I don't wanna cause alarm  
The times are a changin', the money is gone  
Where do we go from here, where do we go from here  
If someone is watchin' down from above  
What in the world is he thinkin' of  
Daisy I think we must sell the farm  
And you know I don't wanna cause you harm  
The times are a changin', the money is gone  
Where do we go from here, where do we go from here  
Where do we go from here
