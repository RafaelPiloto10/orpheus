May not know enough about you, babe  
That can only come in time  
Only know enough to make you stay  
On my mind  
  
Though I met you only yesterday  
And only for a moment then  
I knew I couldn't let you get away  
I just can see you, girl  
  
I can be the one you love  
Let me be the one you need  
Take a look into your heart  
Try to find a place for me  
  
Can't say I can't live without you, babe  
That's just some worn out loser's line  
May not know enough about you, babe  
But you stay on my mind  
  
[Repeat x4]  
I can be the one you love  
Let me be the one you need  
Take a look into your heart  
Try to find a place for me
