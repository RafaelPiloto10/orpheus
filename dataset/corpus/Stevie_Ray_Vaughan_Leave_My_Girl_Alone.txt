You better leave, you better leave my little girl alone  
You better leave, you better leave my little girl alone  
Lord before I get evil man, and I go and do something wrong  
  
You call my house, just yesterday  
I picked up the extension and I heard every word you say  
Why don't you just go, man and leave my little girl alone  
Now before I get evil man, and I go and do something wrong  
  
You call my house all hours of the night  
Let me tell you mister that's a sure, sure way to start a fight  
Why don't you just go on man and leave my little girl alone  
Lord before I get evil man and I'm gonna do something wrong
