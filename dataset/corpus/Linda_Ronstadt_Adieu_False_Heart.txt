Adieu false heart, now we must part  
May the joys of the world go with you  
I love you long with a faithful heart  
But never anymore can I believe you  
  
I seen the time I'd married you  
And been your constant lover  
But now I'd gladly give you up  
For one whose heart is truer  
  
You think you are too good for me  
You think I am forsaken  
But if you think I care for you  
You are very much mistaken  
  
My mind is like the constant sun  
From the east to the west it ranges  
But yours is like unto the moon  
It's every month, it changes  
  
When I lay down to take my rest  
No scornful one to wake me  
I'll go straight way unto my grave  
Just as fast as time can take me  
  
Adieu false heart, now we must part  
May the joys of the world go with you  
I love you long with a faithful heart  
But never anymore can I believe you
