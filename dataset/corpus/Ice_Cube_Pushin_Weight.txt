Yeah yeah  
Blaze one for the nation  
Brr  
Brr  
Brr  
  
I got lyrics that wake up spirits  
They told me how to make big hits and spend digits  
Can you dig it?  
You fed you dead see red  
My lead yo head I fed  
Like you shit  
I got rhymes push that shit like weight  
My nigga Lincoln help me navigate  
Through this hate retaliate it's official  
I got that bomb, bomb, diddy, diddy, diddy, bomb, bomb  
When I hit you  
Push the issue  
My ghetto dope is amazin'  
The bitch that's with you already know that I'm blazin'  
That's by the number, we can slumber, on the under  
Girl no wonder, you got a ass full of thunder  
The frozen Tundra ain't cold enough  
And baby ain't old enough  
For this game I'm rollin' up  
De-zamn it feels good to be the don  
Straight legit, while niggas like Gotti just sit  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
A yeah yeah  
I push rhymes like weight  
I push rhymes like weight  
  
I hold zone like a Corleone  
No more fuckin' with that homegrown  
Hit the shit we on  
The rolleo's and the baguettes  
You still fuckin' with them faggots  
We turn haters into maggots  
Oak on the dash, but no coke on the hash  
You broke ass niggas learn to mash, like me  
Constantly, put the hustle down  
With four or five niggas that's musclebound  
Send your head to the taxidermist  
Won't be satisfied, till I get my face on a thermos  
You got to earn this, you can't take it  
Can't fake it, got to live it, or we gots to visit  
Who is it, the exquisite, Don Mega  
Walkin with my entourage, I think I'm better, makin' chedder  
You see me sag in my Jag, with the rag recognize the flag  
You better get back, everybody want to do it like me  
I got it made, been makin' rap money since the tenth grade  
(Ch-ching)  
(since the tenth grade)  
(Ch-ching)  
(What you need)  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
I keeps a firm grip on my shit when in transit  
Uncandid, it's the young bandit  
Fresh out the trenches, the wood works  
City of the Tempeon, where the hoods lurk  
In search of the rich blocks, to lick spots, and kick rocks  
From shattered glass, down the pig locks  
Want tips by the clock  
You niggas scramblin' for fouyan  
And settle for crumbs and croutons  
I'm out for armored bucks and armored trucks, with armed killers  
Bitch niggas get swallowed by the armadillos  
Ain't no harmin' me, the army full honorary niggas you can't see  
So while you pace bitches and Saturn's livin' jenky  
I hangs with niggas who got patterns on they hankey  
After Ben Frankeys, with the big skullen eyes  
You niggas bound and nullified  
Sit back and mine stack it multiply  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
A yeah yeah  
I push rhymes like weight  
I push rhymes like weight  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
A yeah yeah  
I push rhymes like weight  
I push rhymes like weight  
  
Ask about me  
Worldwide baby  
Worldwide baby (A yeah yeah)  
Ice Cube makin' more money in the rap game  
Than some of you can (A yeah yeah) with a bird in your hand  
Puttin' it down  
We wanted in fifty states for this weight  
(A yeah yeah)  
Pushin' rhymes like weight  
Pushin' rhymes like weight  
(A yeah yeah)  
Yeah, blaze one for the nation  
(A yeah yeah)  
You know my name  
You know my name  
(A yeah yeah)  
You know my name  
  
Yeah, some of you fools just got in it  
And think you gonna change the game  
You ain't changin' nothin'  
  
I been doin' this, I been doin' this  
Ask about me  
Ask about me
