Gather round me boys and fill your coffee cups  
I'll tell you all a story while you drive them trucks  
A story bout a girl who joined the state patrol  
The legend of the Lady Bear is how it goes  
She married some young trucker she was in her teens  
And like all newly weds they had their hopes and dreams  
And one night in a snowstorm so the story went  
She lost her loving husband in an accident  
They say she sat and cried for him a year or more  
And all she did was think of him and walk the floor  
She'd lie there in her bed at night alone and cold  
Until one day she joined the highway state patrol

Well they say she has a CB and she's on the air  
And she goes by the handle of the Lady Bear  
She never gives a ticket and she works at night  
All she does is tell the story of her life  
I've heard some truckers say there ain't no Lady Bear  
And others say she don't work when the weather's fair  
But when the weather's bad she's on the air all night  
Begging us to slow down till the weather's right  
Well you know I love this story well it could be true  
If you're ever in a snowstorm tell you what to do  
If you should hear the Lady Bear on your radio  
Well tell her I wrote this song and said hello
