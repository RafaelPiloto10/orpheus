I've got you under my skin  
I've got you deep in the heart of me  
So deep in my heart, you're really a part of me  
I've got you under my skin  
  
I'd tried so not to give in  
I said to myself this affair never will go so well  
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know so well  
That I've got you under my skin?  
  
I'd sacrifice anything come what might  
For the sake of havin' you near  
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night  
And repeats and repeats in my ear  
  
Don't you know, little fool, you never can win?  
Use your mentality, wake up to reality  
But each time that I do just the thought of you  
Makes me stop before I begin  
'Cause I've got you under my skin  
  
I'd sacrifice anything come what might  
For the sake of havin' you near  
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night  
And repeats, how it yells in my ear  
  
Don't you know, little fool, you never can win?  
Why not use your mentality, wake up to reality?  
But each time that I do just the thought of you  
Makes me stop just before I begin  
'Cause I've got you under my skin  
  
'Cause I've got you under my skin  
Yeah, I've got you under my skin  
Sure enough I do, baby  
Sure enough I do
