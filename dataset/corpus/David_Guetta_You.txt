You must be  
Living in a fantasy  
  
You've got me dreaming now I believe  
And there I saw you  
Looking oh so right  
Working the dance floor  
You superstar of the night  
You take me up you take me down  
Shake your body to the ground  
How do you do the things you do  
I know it must be true that you  
You pull me closer like I knew you would  
I try to please you the way you think I should  
You make me feel I'm in control  
You take my body and my soul  
You fill me up  
This empty cup  
I just can't get enough of you
