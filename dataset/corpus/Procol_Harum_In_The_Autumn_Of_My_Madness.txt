In the autumn of my madness when my hair is turning grey  
For the milk has finally curdled and I've nothing left to say  
When all my thoughts are spoken (save my last departing birds)  
Bring all my friends unto me and I'll strangle them with words  
In the autumn of my madness which in coming won't be long  
For the nights are now much darker and the daylight's not so strong  
And the things which I believed in are no longer quite enough  
For the knowing is much harder and the going's getting rough
