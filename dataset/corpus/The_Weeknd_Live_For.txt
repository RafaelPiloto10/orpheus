Getting sober for a day, got me feeling too low  
They tryna make me slow down, tryna tell me how to live  
I'm about to lose control (lose control)  
Well they can watch me fuck it up all in one night  
I'm in my city in the summer, camo'd out  
Leather booted, kissing bitches in the club  
They wanna threesome (threesome)  
Then some (then some)  
Spend whatever come in, fuck an income  
Me and my niggas we ain't never going broke  
And you, have to  
Do it all just to know where it gets you  
Living dreams we can never afford  
Now we sitting in the back saying  
  
This the shit that I live for  
This the shit that I live for  
This the shit that I live for  
With the people I'd die for  
  
This the shit that I live for  
This the shit that I live for

With the people I'd die for

Yeah  
This the shit that I live for  
This the shit that I'd die for  
This the shit you can't fake dawg  
This the shit you need God for  
How long do you think  
It's gon' take for y'all to fall?  
That's a serious question 'cause I'm seriously questioning all of y'all  
Been touring the world man, I've done spent racks in all the malls  
And they know my story, flaws and all, I still got plaques hanging wall to
wall dawg  
She just offered a strip tease, but she don't look like Demi Moore  
Hips all on 45, waist all on 24  
And it's all love in the city, still scream XO, when that Henny pour  
But I'm that boy, not just any boy, what the fuck you think that I'm in it for  
Roll up in that thing, got hoes like Prince, but they know I'm king  
Chubbs might hold that thing, if he get caught, he'll be home by spring  
Things I shouldn't share, I mean for the sake of my career  
I'm not trynna stunt, I'm just tellin' you the truth, I swear  
This the shit that I live for with the people I'd die for  
This the shit you can't fake dawg, this the shit you need God for  
This that shit we really gotta talk about in person  
There's some shit I need to work on, but I know you see me working  
Nigga, champagne  
  
This the shit that I live for  
This the shit that I live for  
This the shit that I live for  
With the people I'd die for  
  
This the shit that I live for

With the people I'd die for
