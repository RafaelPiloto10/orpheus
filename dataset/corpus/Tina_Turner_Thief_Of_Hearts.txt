Let me tell you about a man I knew  
Yeah, I knew him all too well  
  
My attitude has always been you can have me for tonight  
But not for tomorrow  
It's gonna cost you plenty, more than you can afford  
More than you can borrow  
Well I can make them fall in love just as easy as I  
Pick their pockets hey  
And when I've done the deed I jump on a freight train  
And make my getaway  
  
I'm a thief of hearts, a burglar in the night  
Before they knew what hit them I was out of sight  
Been a thief of hearts, now I'm paying for my crimes  
Cause now you're gone and stolen mine  
  
I met you on a starry night, full moon in your eyes  
Did something strange to me  
I was all prepared to spin my web, take you for a ride  
But there was a fork in the street  
Well I didn't mean to fall in love, didn't practice the rules  
That I've been taught  
You never get involved, never drop your defences  
But this time I got caught  
  
I'm a thief of hearts, a burglar in the night  
Before they knew what hit them I was out of sight  
Been a thief of hearts, now I'm paying for my crimes  
Cause now you're gone and stolen mine  
Thief of hearts, paying for my crimes  
Thief of hearts, and now you've gone and stolen mine  
  
Feels so good, I want more, it should be against the law
