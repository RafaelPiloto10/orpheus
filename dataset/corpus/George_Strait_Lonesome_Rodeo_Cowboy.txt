I own this horse and saddle  
And that old Cadillac  
This broken down horse trailer  
And the clothes that are on my back  
Well I know that it ain't a hell of a lot  
But it's all that I can show  
  
My wife left me five years ago  
In one of those rodeo towns  
I can't say that I blame her much  
She just wanted to settle down  
Oh god how I miss that woman  
It hurt so to see her go  
If I was smart I woulda stuck by her  
But I'm hooked on this rodeo  
  
[Chorus]  
And I'm just a lonesome cowboy  
I'm a little bit over the hill  
I shoulda quit this thing a long time ago  
But I guess I never will  
So I keep on movin' from show to show  
Hopin' to change my luck  
My good ol' days are just a memory  
But I just can't give it up  
  
There was a time I used to do alright  
And bring home my share of the dough  
But now I'm losin' out to the younger boys  
I guess I must be gettin' slow  
But there's one thing you learn from this  
You gotta make it on your own  
Cause when your on top you've got a million friends  
But when your down buddy you're all alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My good ol days are just a memory  
But I just can't give it up
