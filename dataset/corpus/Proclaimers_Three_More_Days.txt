Three more days and then I'll see  
The people who depend on me.  
Three more days and I'm home.  
  
Not long now until I step inside  
The place where we all reside.  
Three more days and I'm home.  
  
And life's rolled on and on  
The whole time I've been gone.  
  
I walk around today feeling right.  
I dreamt about each one of them last night.  
Three more days and I'm home.  
  
And life's rolled on and on  
The whole time I've been gone.  
  
When I close my eyes I can see  
The faces of my family.  
Three more days and I'm home.  
  
Everything that I hold dear  
Lies five thousand miles from here.  
Three more days and I'm home.  
Three more days and I'm home.  
  
Home.
