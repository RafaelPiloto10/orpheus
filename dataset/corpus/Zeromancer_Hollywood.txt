It's the real thing  
Safety's off  
Are you there  
Are you there for me  
By my side  
An angel  
Who dodge the bullets wide  
  
It feels right  
On a beach  
When you talk  
You talk without a sound  
And when you walk  
Your feet hardly touch the ground  
  
But you're there  
By my side  
But you're there for me  
  
When all this is over  
Heaven knows I'm going nowhere  
I was only dreaming  
Censored for a deeper meaning  
  
It wears off  
Like lipstick on your skin  
Like a day that won't begin  
Waking up  
And you can't remember  
Where you've been  
  
It's time  
We get things straight  
Are you there  
Are you there for me  
Back for good  
It's 6 a.m. in Hollywood
