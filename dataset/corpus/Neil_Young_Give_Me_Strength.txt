A lonely man I know myself to be  
It's not as bad  
As some things I have seen.  
The picture painted here  
Is not a dream  
The only reality  
Is the way it seems.  
  
The happier you fly  
The sadder you fall  
The laughter in your eyes  
Is never all.  
  
Give me strength to move along.  
Give me strength  
To leave my sweetheart.  
  
I'm riding down this wet road  
In my old car  
The moon is almost full  
Except for stars.  
The party ended  
Long before the night  
She made me feel alive  
And that's all right.  
  
The happier you fly  
The sadder you fall  
The laughter in your eyes  
Is never all.  
  
Give me strength to move along.  
Give me strength  
To leave while she's gone.  
  
The happier you fly  
The sadder you fall  
The laughter in your eyes  
Is never all.  
  
Give me strength to move along.  
Give me strength to move along.  
Give me strength to move along.
