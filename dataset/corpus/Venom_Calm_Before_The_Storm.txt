I can smell the fear  
Hear the screams of pain  
I must kill or be meat  
I'll say to you  
On this planet of dirt  
Number one comes first  
This is our place  
The last of the human race  
Children of disgrace  
Now can you all hear me say  
There's a calm before the storm  
Don't say that you ain't been warned  
A calm before the storm  
And it's coming for you  
Is there life after death  
Do you ask yourself  
This is our place  
The last of the human race  
Children of disgrace  
Now can you all hear me say  
There's a calm before the storm  
Don't say that you ain't been warned  
A calm before the storm  
And it's coming for you  
I have smelled the fear  
Heard the screams of pain  
This is our place  
The last of the human race  
Children of disgrace  
Now can you all hear me say  
There's a calm before the storm  
Don't say that you ain't been warned  
A calm before the storm  
And it's coming for you  
There's a calm before the storm
