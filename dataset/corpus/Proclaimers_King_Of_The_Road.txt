Trailer for sale or rent, rooms to let, fifty cents  
No phone, no pool, no pets, I ain't got no cigarettes, ah but  
Two hours of pushing broom buys an eight by twelve four bit room  
I'm a man of means by no means, king of the road  
Third box car midnight train, destination Bangor, Maine  
Old worn out suit and shoes, I don't pay no union dues, I smoke  
Old stogies I have found, short, but not too big around  
I'm a man of means by no means, king of the road  
I know every engineer on every train  
All of the children and all of their names  
And every handout in every town  
And ev'ry lock that ain't locked when  
No one's around I sing...
