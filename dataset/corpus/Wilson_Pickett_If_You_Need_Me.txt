If you need me, I want ya to call me  
Said if you need me, all ya gotta do is call me  
Don't wait too lo-o-ong if things go wrong  
I-I-I'll be home, whoa-oh-oh, home  
  
If you want me, send for me  
I said if you want me, want, all ya gotta do is send for me  
Don't wait too lo-o-ong, just-a pick up your phone  
And I-I-I'll (hurry home where I belong)  
  
People always said, darlin', that I didn't mean you no good. And you  
Would need me someday. Way deep down in my heart I know I've done the best I  
Could. That's why I know that one of these days, it won't be long, you'll come  
Walkin' through that same door (I'll hurry home). And I can imagine in my mind  
That these are the words that you'll be sayin'.  
  
I still love you, always thinkin' of you  
And I still love, love, always thinkin' of you  
Don't wait too lo-o-ong, just-a pick up your phone  
And I-I-I'll hurry home (I'll hurry home)  
Right there, where I belong
