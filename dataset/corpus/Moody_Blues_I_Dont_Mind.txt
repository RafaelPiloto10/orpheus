I don't mind your love  
I don't mind the one you're thinking of  
'Cause I know, baby I know  
You're going to miss me  
I don't mind, he loves you so  
I don't mind, it can't grow cold  
'Cause I know, baby I know  
You're going to miss me  
Baby, tell me what you've got to say  
I don't mind, this is all of my song  
I don't mind, goodbye, so long  
'Cause I know, I know  
You're going to miss me  
Baby, can you ever let me go?  
You know, you know that I love you so  
Why'd you ever leave me?  
Why'd you ever leave me?  
Oh, so we will die
