Sometimes the sun shines  
And I close the blinds  
'Cause I can't stand to see the light of day  
I have no use for pain  
  
But I don't mind the rain  
'Cause I can stare outside and hear the sound  
Today I looked right down to the ground  
With nothing in between to break my fall  
  
I'm blue for you, blue for you  
I don't know what to do  
  
[Chorus]  
Gotta form a plan of attack  
Can't stop to look back I know  
You are so far from here  
Gotta be strong in my mind  
Not encroach on your time I know that  
That would be wrong for sure  
  
I must get out and about  
Of that I have no doubt  
There surely must be new places to go  
Sights I've never seen  
  
All with pastures green  
'Cause the old ones are making me blue for you  
'Cause I'm blue for you, blue for you  
I don't know what to do  
  
And I'm blue for you, blue for you  
I don't know what to do  
  
Gotta form a plan of attack  
Climb back on the track I know  
Bid my devil friend good-bye  
Hope I'm still in the race  
  
But I don't know what to chase oh no  
And you're still so far from here  
  
The sun it still shines in  
And I shall close the blinds  
'Cause I know I won't see you anymore, see you anymore  
And I'm blue for you, blue for you  
  
I don't know what to do  
'Cause I'm blue for you, blue for you  
I don't know what to do  
I don't know  
I could take a big jump
