Maybe I'm wrong  
Maybe I'm right  
Maybe I just don't know  
Will I ever fall in love  
  
And never have to worry  
That I'm fallin' all alone?  
Maybe it's true  
I was just born to be blue  
  
Maybe it's true  
I was just born to be blue  
  
They say everybody's got a someone  
A sweet somebody to love  
It might be fate or destiny  
May be written in the stars above  
  
But I can't help but wonder  
After all that I've been through  
Maybe my baby's nowhere to be found  
And I was just born to be blue  
  
Was I born to be unhappy?  
Just to live on heartache street  
Was I born to go to bed each night  
And cry myself to sleep?  
  
Can somebody out there help me?  
Give me some kind of clue  
Tell me I'm wrong, tell me I'm right  
But, don't tell me I was born to be blue  
  
They say nobody dies from a heartache  
You can't drown in your own tears  
But who wants to live in this world alone  
Where minutes turn into years?  
  
So I'd rather go down believin'  
Suffer a heartache or two  
Tell me I'm wrong, tell me I'm right  
But, don't tell me I was born to be blue  
  
Was I born to be blue?  
Born just to cry?  
Born to be alone 'til the day I die?  
  
Somebody tell me  
Was I born to be loved?  
Born to be kissed?  
Born to find the one to show me what I missed?  
  
Was I born to be blue?  
Born just to cry?  
Born to be alone 'til the day I die?  
  
Tell me, Mama  
Was I born to be loved?  
Born to be kissed?  
Born to find the one to show me what I missed?
