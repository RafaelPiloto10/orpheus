Girl you wanna play with me baby  
Money ain't a thing cause I got paper  
I'm lookin' at your body  
You about to get exactly what you came for  
Now I can throw it up throw it up  
Break it down down down  
Even if it ain't loud she gets me aroused  
Slow it up slow it up slow it down  
You the sh-t you the sh-t  
Go ahead play with it baby  
Cause I'mma keep my hands to myself  
And my back on the wall  
Now I'm playing with it baby  
I know you don't give a f-ck  
Cause you gon' get your money up  
  
I, I, I  
Get your ass up on that pole  
Get this money in my hand  
I, I, I  
All this money dripping on you  
Like paint from a Mona Lisa  
Drop it to the flo' b-tch  
All this money dripping on you  
Like paint from a Mona Lisa

I f-cked with my first b-tch  
I upgrade my second broad  
Corporate my credit card  
Vintaged out my f-ck-ng watch  
Vintaged out my f-ck-ng cars  
No... just f-ck-ng yacht  
Your new b-tch, my old b-tch  
You can have the hoe cause she talk a lot  
Now get your ass up on this pole, you can get this money  
Now I got them carats, I got all them playboy bunnies  
I'm throwing them honies  
Racks on top of racks and they backs look like...  
  
[Chris Brown]  
  
  
And they ass big as some mountain  
Put my drink on it, she cold  
My zipper down but my money up  
Better get your ass up on that pole  
Two mo' shots then I'm out, black, black then I reload  
... might earn 20 more, get yo ass up on that pole  
Damn look at Lakeisha getting that money just like a zesta  
All of these bunnies hopping and popping  
You fighting to get up in my 2 seater  
My chain, 6 rings  
  
I, I, I  
Get your ass up on that pole  
Get this money in my hand  
I, I, I  
All this money dripping on you  
Like paint from a Mona Lisa  
Drop it to the flo' b-tch  
All this money dripping on you  
Like paint from a Mona Lisa  
  
I don't make it rain  
Nigga I make a monsoon like a tidal wave  
Me taking 23 shots, that's a MJ  
I mean a fadeaway, we 'bout to fadeaway  
  
She said she like my pants  
I think she like my pockets  
B-tch I'm in the building counting millions  
You should try it  
Yeah what d'you mean  
She tried to kiss me, I said stop it  
Put that money in the face then she get that pussy popping  
  
I, I, I  
Get your ass up on that pole  
Get this money in my hand  
I, I, I  
All this money dripping on you  
Like paint from a Mona Lisa  
Drop it to the flo' b-tch  
All this money dripping on you  
Like paint from a Mona Lisa
