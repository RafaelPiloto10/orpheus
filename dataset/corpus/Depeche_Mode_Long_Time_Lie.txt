It's been a while since you did something  
Not so long since you complained  
Can sit around here doing nothing everyday  
You're the coward who points the finger  
I understand that I'm helping you  
You have delusions and some spaced-out fantasies  
That's what you do  
  
He loves to wallow in the glory  
Loves to cut you down to size  
Try to make you believe in all of his lies  
It's been a long, long, long, long, long, long time  
It's been a long, long, long, long, long, long time  
Long time lie  
  
Don't you ever look in the mirror  
Don't you know there's so much more  
Locked up inside that box behind your door  
All your twisted conversations  
When you're sitting all alone  
Just remember we know your secret while you moan  
  
He loves to wallow in the glory  
Loves to cut you down to size  
Try to make you believe in all of his lies  
It's been a long, long, long, long, long, long time  
It's been a long, long, long, long, long, long time  
Long time lie
