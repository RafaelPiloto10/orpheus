In my imagination  
You are my dear companion  
And I'm the one you cling to  
And your voice still calls my name  
Before your heart began to wander  
And mine was torn asunder  
Before the fairer and the younger  
Before the cryin' game  
All those girls with their long dark tresses  
Waltzing out in their Sunday dresses  
All their sweet soft warm caresses  
Cannot hold you like l do  
And though you say you do notlove me  
And your dreams are never of me  
I will dream my dream of you  
In my dreams you are the swallow  
Coming back to Capistrano  
And I'm the sound of the bells you follow  
But in this world dreams don't come true  
Still when you're lost out in the desert  
When your fire's a dying ember  
The last light you remember  
Will be the light l shed for you  
Mine is no ordinary star love  
I see exactly where you are love  
And no one else could shine that far love  
To bring you safely through  
And though you say you do not want me  
And made no promises to haunt me  
I will dream my dream of you  
The sorrows flow down like a fountain  
Over the miles beyond our countin'  
More than the flowers of the mountain  
Or the raindrops in the sea  
But if Heaven's just a dreaming  
Surely my love will be redeeming  
And you will dream your dream of me
