Last night I went to sleep in Detroit City  
And I dreamed about the cotton fields and home  
I dreamed about my mother, dear old papa, sister and brother  
And I dreamed about the girl who's been waiting for long.  
  
I want to go home, I want to go home  
Oh, how I want to go home.  
  
Home folks think I'm big in Detroit City  
From the letters that I write they think I'm fine  
But by day I make the cars, by night I ake the bars  
If only they could read between the lines.  
  
I want to go home, I want to go home  
Oh, how I want to go home.  
  
Cause you know I rode a freight train north to Detroit City  
And after all these years I find I've just been wasting my time  
So I think I'll take my foolish pride  
And put it on the south-bound freight and ride  
And go on back to the loved ones  
The ones that I left waiting so far behind.  
  
I want to go hoe, I want to go home  
Oh, how I want to go home.
