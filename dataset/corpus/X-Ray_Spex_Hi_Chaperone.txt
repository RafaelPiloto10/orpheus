You know, you know, you know you know you know  
I can't go out alone  
Hi chaperone, my chaperone  
What you think is all wrong  
'cause you shouldn't treat a girl like a game of ping-pong  
But I can't go out alone without a chaperone  
Hi chaperone, my chaperone  
You may say sweet dreams tonight  
Blow me a kiss, well I guess that's alright, that's alright  
I can't go out alone without a chaperone  
Hi chaperone, my chaperone  
You may say the streets are safe  
In these modern days, but I'm not OK  
I can't go out alone without a chaperone  
Hi chaperone, my chaperone  
I can't go out alone without a chaperone  
Hi chaperone, my chaperone  
Hi chaperone, my chaperone  
Hi chaperone!  
Hi chaperone! Hi chaperone! (repeat)
