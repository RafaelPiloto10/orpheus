I'd go anywhere for you  
Anywhere you asked me to  
I'd do anything for you  
Anything you want me to  
  
I'd walk halfway around the world  
For just one kiss from you  
Far beyond the call of love  
The sun, the stars, the moon  
As long as your love's there to lead me  
I won't lose my way believe me  
Even through the darkest night you know  
  
[Chorus]  
I'd go anywhere for you  
Anywhere you asked me to  
I'd do anything for you  
Anything you want me to  
Your love as far as I can see  
Is all I'm ever gonna need  
There's one thing for sure  
I know it's true  
Baby, I'd go anywhere for you  
  
I used to think that dreams were just  
For sentimental fools  
And I'd never find someone  
Who'd give their love so true  
But I knew the very minute  
Couldn't live my life without you in it  
And now I want the whole world  
To know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hey baby, hey baby, hey baby, oh [Repeat: x3]  
  
[Chorus: x2]
