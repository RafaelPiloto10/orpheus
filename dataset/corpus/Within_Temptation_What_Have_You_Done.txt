Would you mind if I hurt you?  
Understand that I need to  
Wish that I had other choices  
Than to harm the one I love  
What have you done now?  
I know I'd better stop trying  
You know that there's no denying  
I won't show mercy on you now  
I know I should stop believing  
I know there's no retrieving  
It's over now, what have you done?  
What have you done now?  
I, I've been waiting for someone like you  
But now you are slipping away  
What have you done now?  
Why, why does fate make us suffer?  
There's a curse between us, between me and you  
What have you done?  
What have you done?  
What have you done?  
What have you done?  
What have you done now?  
What have you done?  
What have you done?  
What have you done?  
What have you done?  
What have you done now?  
Would you mind if I killed you?  
Would you mind if I tried to?  
'Cause you have  
Turned into my worst enemy  
You carry hate that I don't feel  
It's over now, what have you done?  
What have you done now?  
I, I've been waiting for someone like you  
But now you are slipping away  
What have you done now?  
Why, why does fate make us suffer?  
There's a curse between us, between me and you  
What have you done?  
What have you done?  
What have you done?  
What have you done?  
What have you done now?  
What have you done?  
What have you done?  
What have you done?  
What have you done?  
What have you done now?  
What have you done?  
What have you done?  
What have you done?  
What have you done?  
What have you done?  
What have you done?  
What have you done?  
I will not fall, won't let it go  
We will be free when it ends  
I, I've been waiting for someone like you  
But now you are slipping away  
What have you done now?  
Why, why does fate make us suffer?  
There's a curse between us, between me and you  
I've been waiting for someone like you  
But now you are slipping away  
What have you done now?  
Why, why does fate make us suffer?  
There's a curse between us, between me and you
