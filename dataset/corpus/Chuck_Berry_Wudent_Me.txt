Old boy he ran a little stop sign in the south  
And he got in deeper trouble with his mouth  
They wouldn't let him phone or make a bail  
Just let him sit there in that Delford County jail  
It wudn't me, it wudn't me  
I'm so glad it wudn't me  
No phone, no bail, no plea  
Oh, I'm so glad it wudn't me  
He had to break out of that Delford County jail  
They put a Grand Dragon posse on his trail  
And seven Alabama bloodhounds in a line  
Buckin' and barkin' for a bite of his behind  
It wudn't me, it wudn't me  
I'm so glad it wudn't me  
Hung posses ain't my cup o'tea  
Oh, I'm so glad it wudn't me  
He was streakin' through the Delta double three  
But them hungry hounds was gainin'on his lee  
His feet was playin' "Louisiana Bound"  
Lord, you help me pick 'em up, I'll put 'em down (Amen)  
It wudn't me, it wudn't me  
I'm so glad it wudn't me  
Prayin' ain't no sure guarantee  
Oh, I'm so glad it wudn't me  
He was streakin' through the Delta, stridin' wide  
But that leadin' hound was meters from his hide  
Lord, bless my feet, don't let 'em go corrupt  
I'll lay 'em down as fast as you can pick 'em up  
It wudn't me, it wudn't me  
I'm so glad it wudn't me  
Just meters from a canine jubilee  
Oh, I'm so glad it wudn't me  
He reached a highway through the ticket on the side  
And a trucker came along and let him ride  
But as he settled down to thank him for no harm  
He saw a swasti-KKK band on his arm  
That's when he knew he had to get on help his self  
'Stead if sittin' pinnin' it on somebody else  
He hung a left into that thicket 'cross the fence  
And ain't nobody ever sawed or seen him since  
It wudn't me, it wudn't me  
I'm so glad it wudn't me  
It ain't quite my kinda cup o'tea  
Jeez, I'm glad it wudn't me  
It wudn't me, it was not me  
I'm so glad it wudn't me  
It just ain't my kinda cup o'tea  
Jeez, am I glad it wudn't me
