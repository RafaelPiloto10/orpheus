Shift work, hard work, tired bar  
Blue-collar shirt and a baseball cap  
You knew me  
  
He's hot, sweat drops, 'round the clock  
Door never locks  
Noise never stops  
Not all day  
Work seven to three  
Three to eleven  
Eleven to seven  
  
Shift work, tough work for the convenience store clerk  
Two feet that hurt, going insane  
She's mad at some lad  
Drove off and didn't pay for his gas and he won't be the last  
'round the clock pain  
Work seven to three  
Three to eleven  
Eleven to seven  
  
Talking about a bunch of shift work  
A big ol' pile of shift work  
Work seven to three  
Three to eleven  
Eleven to seven  
  
Well I work, shift work,  
Ten years man, I hated that work  
I made a break with the money I made  
It took me to the beach to have a beer by the edge of the sea  
And this 'round a clock place  
I drank my money away  
We partied  
Work seven to three  
Three to eleven  
Eleven to seven  
  
Talking about a bunch of shift work  
A big ol' pile of shift work  
Work seven to three  
Three to eleven  
Eleven to seven  
  
Talking about a bunch of shift work  
A big ol' pile of shift work  
Work seven to three  
Three to eleven  
Eleven to seven  
  
Work seven to three  
Three to eleven  
Eleven to seven
