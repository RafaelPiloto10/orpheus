Here she is, boys!  
Here she is, world!  
Here's Rose!  
  
Curtain up!  
Light the lights!  
Play it, boys!  
  
Ya either got it, or ya ain't.  
And, boys, I got it!  
Ya like it?  
Well, I got it!  
  
Some people got it and make it pay.  
Some people can't even give it away.  
This people's got it  
and this people's spreadin' it around!  
You either have it  
or you've had it!  
  
Hello, everybody! My name is Rose! What's yours?  
How do you like them eggrolls, Mr. Goldstone?  
Hold your hats and hallelujah.  
Mama's gonna show it to you.  
Ready or not, shhh, here comes Mama.  
  
Mama's talkin' loud.  
Mama's doin' fine.  
Mama's gettin' hot.  
Mama's goin' stong.  
Mama's movin' on.  
Mama's all alone.  
Mama doesn't care.  
Mama's lettin' loose.  
Mama's got the stuff.  
Mama's lettin' go.  
Mama?  
Mama's got the stuff.  
Mama's gotta move.  
Mama's gotta go.  
Mama? Mama?  
Mama's gotta let go.  
  
Why did I do it?  
What did it get me?  
Scrapbooks full of me in the background.  
Give 'em love and what does it get ya?  
What does it get ya?  
One quick look as each of 'em leaves you.  
All your life and what does it get ya?  
Thanks a lot and out with the garbage,  
They take bows and you're battin' zero.  
  
I had a dream.  
I dreamed it for you, June.  
It wasn't for me, Herbie.  
And if it wasn't for me  
then where would you be,  
Miss Gypsy Rose Lee?  
  
Well, someone tell me, when is it my turn?  
Don't I get a dream for myself?  
Starting now it's gonna be my turn.  
Gangway, world, get off of my runway!  
Starting now I bat a thousand!  
This time, boys, I'm taking the bows and  
  
Everything's coming up Rose!  
Everything's coming up roses!  
Everything's coming up roses  
this time for me!  
For me! For me! For me! For me! For me!  
For me!
