C'mon, c'mon, c'mon  
When nothing's funny it gets easy to laugh  
At the drop of the hat or a bomb  
When someone's screaming it's hard to ignore  
Like the shot of a gun, c'mon  
Let's run to a place somewhere  
The party never ends  
Let's run till there's no way  
To go on, c'mon  
Can't you hear the sirens blowing  
Can't you hear them call  
Can't you see the lasers probing  
Brighter than the sun, let's run  
c'mon, c'mon, c'mon  
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon  
Let's run from a promise  
That could never be kept  
Let's run or it's sure to chase us down  
Well c'mon, let's run  
c'mon, let's run  
C'mon, let's run  
Can't you hear the sirens blowing  
Can't you hear them call  
Can't you see those lasers probing  
Brighter than the sun, well c'mon  
c'mon, c'mon, c'mon  
When no one's laughing you can bet they've been paid  
Not to find out what's going on  
When something's funny there's a feeling you get  
It's the grip of a threat, c'mon  
Let's run to a place somewhere  
The party never ends  
Let's run till there's no way  
To go on, c'mon  
Let's run from a promise  
That could never be kept  
Let's run or it's sure to chase us down  
Well c'mon, let's run  
c'mon, let's run  
C'mon, let's run  
C'mon, well let's run
