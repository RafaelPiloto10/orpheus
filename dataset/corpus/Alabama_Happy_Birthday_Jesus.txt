Happy birthday, Jesus, it's that time of year  
All the lights on the trees say Christmas time is near  
Another year's behind us, you helped us make it through  
So, happy birthday, Jesus, this song is just for you  
  
We all get so hung up on material things at times it seems like we forget  
What Christmas really means  
It should be thanks we're givin', that's why I wrote this tune  
Happy birthday, Jesus, this sing is just for you  
  
There's a gift for everyone but you underneath the tree  
No, it's not much, but I hope you like this song to you from me  
  
Happy birthday Jesus, that's why I wrote this tune  
So, happy birthday, Jesus, my song is just for you
