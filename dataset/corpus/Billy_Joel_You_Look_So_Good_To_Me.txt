Ah, you look so good to me  
With my eyes open wide, I can see  
Ah, you feel so good to me  
And it's so good when you're here 'cause I'm free  
Feelin' the glory from that smile upon your face  
It's liftin' me high above my ordinary place  
And I am so happy when I'm in your warm embrace  
Ah, you look so good to me  
With my eyes open wide, I can see  
Ah, you feel so good to me  
And who knows what your next move will be?  
Ah, you look so good to me  
With my eyes open wide, I can see  
Ah, you feel so good to me  
And it's so good when you're here 'cause I'm free
