"Kill the rockstars" how ironic, Kathleen  
You've been crowned the newest queen  
Kinda like the punk rock Gloria Steinham  
You can't change the world by blaming men  
Can't change the world by hating men  
  
Just cause I don't know the reason you're so pissed  
Don't dare tag me misogynist  
I thought the goal here was mutual respect  
Not constructing a separate sect  
I wish I could have seen Courtney  
Demonstrate some real mysoginy  
Can't change the world by hating men
