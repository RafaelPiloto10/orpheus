Band gonna play that rock 'n roll  
Sound of the music gonna groove your soul  
Band gonna do that slip 'n slide  
Sound of the music gonna get you high  
  
Now if you dig Chuck Berry and your head's into rock 'n roll  
Come on down the road a piece  
The cats are gonna burn your soul  
  
Chorus:  
And they all was a reelin'  
Well they all was a rockin'  
The place was blown sky high  
Grandpa's sittin' in the corner  
Mixin' his rock with rye  
  
Now if you dig the dixieland and your heart's into rhythm and blues  
Come on down the road a piece  
The cats are gonna break the news  
  
Chorus:  
And they all was a reelin'  
They all was a rockin'  
The bass man drives it on home  
Now if you dig the dixieland  
Listen to that slide trombone  
  
If you think I'm a bit old-fashioned  
And you want to maintain your cool  
The rhythm of the music is guaranteed  
To make you out a fool  
  
Chorus:  
And they all was a slippin'  
They all was a slidin'  
The place was blown sky high  
Now if you dig the boogie  
The cats will blow your mind  
  
Band gonna play that rock 'n roll  
Sound of the music gonna groove your soul  
Band gonna do that slip 'n slide  
Sound of the music gonna get you high  
  
Slip 'n slide  
Slip 'n slide
