Contained in everything I do  
There's a love, I feel for you  
Proclaimed in everything I write  
You're the light  
Burning, brightly  
Onward through the night  
Onward through the night  
Onward through the night of my life  
  
Displayed in all the things I see  
There's a love you show to me  
Portrayed in all the things you say  
You're the day  
Leading the way  
Onward through the night  
Onward through the night  
Onward through the night of my life  
  
Onward through the night  
Onward through the night  
Onward through the night of my life
