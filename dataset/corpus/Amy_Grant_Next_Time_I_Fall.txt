Love like a road that never ends  
How it leads me back again  
To heartache  
I'll never understand  
Darling I put my heart up on a shelf  
'Till the moment was right and I told myself  
Next time I fall in love  
I'll know better what to do  
Next time I fall in love  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
The next time I fall in love  
The next time I fall in love  
It will be with you  
  
Now as I look into your eyes  
Well I wonder if it's wise  
To hold you  
Like I've wanted to before  
Tonight oh I was thinking that you might  
Be the one who breathes life in this heart of mine  
  
Next time I fall in love  
I'll know better what to do  
Next time I fall in love  
Oh oh oh  
The next time I fall in love  
The next time I fall in love  
(It will be with you)  
  
Next time I'm gonna follow through  
And if it drives me crazy  
I will know better why  
The next time I try  
  
Next time I fall in love  
I'll know better what to do  
Next time I fall in love  
Oh oh oh  
The next time I fall in love  
The next time I fall in love  
The next time I fall in love  
the next time I fall in love
