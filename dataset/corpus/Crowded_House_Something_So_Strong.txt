Love can make you weep, it can make you run for cover  
Roots that spread so deep, bring life to frozen ground  
  
(Something so strong) could carry us away  
(Something so strong) could carry us today  
  
Turning in my sleep, love can leave you cold  
The taste of jealousy, is like a lust for gold  
  
(Something so strong) could carry us away  
(Something so strong) could carry us today  
  
(I've been) feeling so much older  
(Frame me) and hang me on the wall  
(I've seen) you fall into the same trap  
(This thing) is happening to us all  
  
(Something so strong) could carry us away  
(Something so strong) could carry us today  
  
(Something so strong)  
(Something so strong)  
(Something so strong)  
Something something so strong
