I love lookin' at you  
In the way God intended us  
I'm talkin' nothing but about a smile  
I love the sweat when we make love  
And you hear me singin'  
  
Cause if it's a touch you just ask  
Then I'm glad I came  
All I can say is Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, pretty baby  
You got me religious  
You got me religious  
You got me religious  
And all I can say  
Is Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, pretty baby  
You got me religious  
You got me religious  
You got me religious  
  
I love being with you  
Cause I easily work door in you  
Your voice in my head is something like a choir of angels  
Easy like Sunday morning  
Your body makes me go  
Cause being around you is a blessing  
Thank God I can  
And all I can say is  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, pretty baby  
You got me religious  
You got me religious  
You got me religious  
And all I can say  
Is Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, pretty baby  
You got me religious  
You got me religious  
You got me religious  
  
When I see you in the morning  
Breakfast in the bed  
When you smile at me  
You're in my head  
All I can see baby is your love  
All that I can see baby is your love  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,  
You got me religious  
You got me religious  
You got me religious  
I said that all I can say  
Is Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, pretty baby  
You got me religious  
You got me religious  
You got me religious  
How fucking stupid bitch about makin' love, makin' love?  
Makin' love
