Dreams that money just can't buy  
You give away no try and now you're gone, is it forever?  
Love, for me is not a game  
Don't play a trick again, it's over now, is it forever  
Don't hurt my heart  
  
Oh I thought you are the girl out of my dreams  
I'll be there for you oh baby now it seems  
You're the one who quit this love and let me go  
Is it over now, I have to know  
  
Girl, oh why you changed your mind  
There's a way we'll find, but why, you're gone, is it forever?  
Love is looking through my eyes  
Don't leave this paradise, it's over now, is it forever?  
Don't hurt my heart  
  
I have to know, I have to know
