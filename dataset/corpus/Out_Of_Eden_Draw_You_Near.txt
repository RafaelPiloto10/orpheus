I woke up on this morning  
And misery surrounded me  
And I am forced to face a day  
I didn't even want to begin  
God knows I'm going through it  
And it's hard to imagine I can make it this time  
As my sadness mounts I pray that this day will end  
Cry myself to sleep and then start again  
  
When the world loses its luster  
And you're feeling sad and lonely  
And you need someone to be there  
In your time of need  
You can turn your eyes to the heavens  
And their creator's watching over you  
With arms of love to hold you and draw you near  
  
You're in the midst of heartache  
Perhaps you've lost a loved one  
Lost all your faith-can barely pray  
For the strength you need to go on  
Well, darling don't give up now  
I know that inevitably this too shall pass  
Trouble doesn't last always  
Hold on through the pain  
I believe the sun will outlast your rain
