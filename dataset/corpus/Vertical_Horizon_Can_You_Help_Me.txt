Can you finally reach me  
Out beyond the blue  
I've been gone a long time  
Far away from you  
  
I can see that love alone is not enough  
If you don't believe in what you are and what you've got  
  
The tears you've cried have come to my eyes  
  
Can you, can you help me?  
'cause I went away  
Can you, can you help me?  
Or is it too late?  
Can you, can you help me?  
I'm trying to get through  
Can you, can you help me?  
'cause I wanna love you  
  
Once you've been defeated  
Once you've been defined  
Once your will is broken down  
It's so hard to feel alive  
  
But I believe that somewhere out across the fields  
I can see what is false and what is real  
  
You're the one face that holds me in place  
I can see you  
  
Can you, can you help me?  
'cause I went away  
Can you, can you help me?  
Or is it too late?  
Can you, can you help me?  
I'm trying to get through  
Can you, can you help me?  
'cause I'm want to love you  
  
You say hush, everyone heals in time  
So hush, hush, everyone heals in time  
Hush everyone heals in time, time  
So hush, hush, everyone heals in time  
  
Can you, can you help me?  
'cause I went away  
Can you, can you help me?  
Or is it too late?  
Can you, can you help me?  
I'm trying to get through  
Can you, can you help me?  
'cause I wanna love you  
  
I wanna love you
