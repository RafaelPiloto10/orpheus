Put your hand in the paintbox and choose  
Which one says the most about you  
I would have to pick the deepest shade  
The saddest shade of blue  
But red is colour I'd choose  
Red is colour I'd choose  
  
I set my soul long ago and far away  
Oh it's written down so deep it can never fade away  
Though so many years have come and gone  
Through my life one thing has stayed  
An eternal light that shines clean through the grey  
  
Red is colour I'd choose  
Deepest red on a sky of deepest blue  
It don't matter now if I should win  
If I should win or lose  
'cause red is colour I'd choose  
If I waste my time away waiting just for you  
I don't care what others say  
'cause baby I just love, love what you do  
  
Red is colour I'd choose  
Deepest red on a sky of deepest blue  
It don't matter now if I should win  
If I should win or lose  
'cause red is colour I'd choose
