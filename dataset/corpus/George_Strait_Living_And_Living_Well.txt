Had a nice little life  
A little boat a little beach  
A little routine I liked  
A blue ocean view  
Free to go with the flow  
Anywhere that I wanted to  
But the moment you set foot on my shore  
That's when I knew  
  
There's a difference in  
Living and living well  
You can't have it all  
All by yourself  
Something's always missing  
'Til you share it with someone else  
There's a difference in living and living well  
  
'Til you smiled with me  
Thought that I had it good  
As good as it could be  
From the back of my deck  
Caught a fish caught a breeze  
And a thousand red sunsets  
But sitting here with you girl I just saw  
The best one yet  
  
There's a difference in  
Living and living well  
You can't have it all  
All by yourself  
Something's always missing  
'Til you share it with someone else  
There's a difference in living and living well  
  
My days are brighter  
My sky a deeper blue  
My nights are sweeter  
When I'm with you  
  
There's a difference in  
Living and living well  
You can't have it all  
All by yourself  
Something's always missing  
'Til you share it with someone else  
There's a difference in living and living well
