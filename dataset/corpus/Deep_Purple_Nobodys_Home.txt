Nothing I can do about it  
Maybe I won't even try  
Your will is determined to kill any  
Reason of mine  
  
I see you coming  
With that look in your eye  
You act like a king but you ain't got a thing  
In your mind  
  
And now there's nobody home  
My belly is aching  
Your image is blown  
Your lights are burning bright  
But nobody's home  
  
You talk about love and affection  
If only you could  
You're full of pride but there's nothing inside  
And you think you're so good  
  
You know you got it coming to ya  
All things return  
You need me  
It's not gonna be my concern  
  
And now there's nobody home  
Your message is changing  
The children have grown  
Your lights are burning bright  
But nobody's home  
  
I hear you crying  
What can I say  
You get what you give so  
Forgive me as I turn away  
  
Nobody's home  
A legend is dying  
The seeds have been sown  
Your lights are burning bright  
But nobody's home
