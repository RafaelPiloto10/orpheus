I've been losing myself beneath this, so much broken by the rain  
Nothing can take my mind off how to make them pay  
Give up myself to nothing, then the pain will go away  
Losing myself to know this, I've been going away  
  
If I could turn the hands of time  
I would, but here I am  
  
Tell me why am I still here when I'm so dead?  
I am just a ghost of yesterday  
Tell me why am I still trying to hold on?  
Gotta turn it down to let it go  
  
I do turn to keep on trying, but I spend it to the end  
Knowing that there's no person for my rising side  
I've buried again in evil, always the one who's left behind  
I am the one who's standing, I will live to tell  
  
If I could turn the hands of time, I would, but here I am, here I am  
  
Tell me why am I still here when I'm so dead?  
I am just a ghost of yesterday  
Tell me why am I still trying to hold on?  
Gotta turn it down to let it go  
  
Tell me why I'm wasting away  
Tell me how to be my own change  
Cause I've been losing it too long  
Tell me how to stand here and fight  
Tell me how to face my own day  
Cause I'm still standing  
  
I'm still standing, such as a fighter  
I've got to fight for all of it  
  
Tell me why am I still here when I'm so dead?  
I am just a ghost of yesterday  
  
Tell me why am I still here when I'm so dead?  
I am just a ghost of yesterday  
Tell me why am I still trying to hold on?  
Gotta turn it down to let it go
