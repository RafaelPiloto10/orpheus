Our lives run different ways  
Through the rain I see you in the sun  
Our star shines anyway  
If you wish upon it we are one  
  
Dog eat dog  
To get by  
Hope you like my genocide  
I find it such a shame  
  
Through the pain I see things as they are  
We're served up on a plate  
The pedestal is high enough to fall  
And if in time  
We can see the errors of our ways  
  
Would anyone change it anyhow  
Our time is up  
I bet you'd only run  
If you saw what goes inside our own  
  
I bet you'd lead the way  
If it were up to you to decide  
But it's not
