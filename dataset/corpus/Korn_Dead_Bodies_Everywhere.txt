Come on, step inside, and you will realize  
Tell me what you need, tell me what to be  
What's your vision?  
You'll see, what do you expect of me?  
I can't live that lie  
Hate!  
  
I sing my words, I'm fucked at dealing  
with your life's dead bodies everywhere  
You  
  
Really want me to be a good son why?  
You make me feel like no one  
Let me strip the plain, let me not give in  
Free me of your life, inside my heart dies  
Your dreams never achieved, don't lay that shit on me  
Let me live my life  
  
Hate!  
I sing my words, I'm fucked at dealing  
With your life's dead bodies everywhere  
  
You!  
Really want me to be a good son, why?  
You make me feel like no one  
You want me to be, something I can never ever be!  
I sing my words, I thought that didn't  
With your life's dead bodies everywhere  
  
You!  
Really want me to be a good son why?  
You make me feel like no one  
Dead bodies everywhere!
