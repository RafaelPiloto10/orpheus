We the people of the United States  
In order to form a more perfect union  
  
Stop pretending that you've never been bad  
You're never wrong and you've never been dirty  
You're such a saint, that ain't the way we see you  
Ah, You want to rule us with an iron hand  
You change the lyrics and become Big Brother  
This ain't Russia, you ain't my Dad or Mother  
(They never knew anyway)  
'Cause I never walk away from what I know is right  
But I'm gonna turn my back on you  
  
Freedom, we're gonna ring the bell  
Freedom to rock, freedom to talk  
Freedom, raise your fist and yell  
Freedom to rock, freedom to talk  
Freedom - ring  
  
Aaaah  
You're playing God from your ivory tower  
Back off preacher, I don't care if it's Sunday  
I ain't no angel, but I've never felt better  
We're a make-up metal generation  
We're not as stupid as you want to make us  
You better leave us, man  
'Cause you sure can't take us  
Oh... Nobody better tell you how to live your life  
Or you gotta do it on your own  
  
Freedom, we're gonna ring the bell  
Freedom to rock, freedom to talk  
Freedom, raise your fist and yell  
Freedom to rock, freedom to talk  
Freedom - Yeah...  
  
Oh yeah  
'Cause I never walk away from what I know is right  
But I'm gonna turn my back on you  
Freedom, we're gonna ring the bell  
Freedom to rock, freedom to talk  
Freedom, raise your fist and yell  
Freedom  
Freedom, we're gonna ring the bell  
Freedom to rock, freedom to talk  
Freedom, raise your fist and yell  
Freedom  
Freedom, we're gonna ring that bell  
Freedom to rock, freedom to talk  
Freedom, come on, raise your fist and yell  
Freedom  
Come on, yell  
Come on, yell  
Freedom to rock, freedom to talk  
Freedom  
Make a fist  
Make a fist  
Make a fist  
Freedom  
And yell.......
