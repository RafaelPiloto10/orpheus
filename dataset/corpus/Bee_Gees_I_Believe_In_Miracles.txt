I don't believe in love  
Im not afraid of the night  
People who follow their hearts survive  
  
Don't need the chains of life  
I am no refugee  
They say that the eyes of the soul surrender  
  
Give me little lovin , can we set the world alight  
Evry thing I wanted walking right beside me ,baby  
When I think Im losin , I just look at you and  
  
Baby , I believe in miracles  
Burnin through the night  
Shinin with the power of lightning , so exciting  
Im on a journey , I don't know if I can make it on my own  
  
Baby , I believe in miracles  
Destination , your desire  
And baby , oh sweet baby  
  
I can't agree with war  
Its not important to me  
The stranger that stands in the wind survives  
  
Give me little lovin , can we set the world ali ght  
Evry thing I wanted walking right beside me baby  
When I think Im losin , I just look at you and  
  
Baby , I believe in miracles  
Burnin through the night  
Shinin with the power of lightning , so exciting  
Im on a journey , I don't know if I can make it on my own  
  
Baby , I believe in miracles  
Burnin through the night  
Shinin with the power of lightning , so exciting  
Im on a journey , I don't now if I can make it on my own  
  
Baby , I believe in miracles  
Destination , your desire  
Shinin with the power of lightning , so exciting  
Im on a journey , I don't know if I can make it on my own
