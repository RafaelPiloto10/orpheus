Darling you send me  
Darling you send me, yeah  
Darling you send me (come on baby, come on)  
Honest you do (you know it)  
Honest you do (come on, don't be nervous)  
Honest you do  
  
Darling you move me  
Darling you move me, yeah  
Darling you move me  
Honest you do, honest you do  
  
Oh, and at first I thought it was infatuation  
But, oh, it's lasted so long  
That now I find myself wanting to marry you  
And take you home  
  
Oh, you send me  
Darling you send me  
Darling you, you, you send me  
Honest you do, honest you do  
  
Oh, and at first I thought it was infatuation  
But, oh, it's lasted so long  
That now I find myself wanting to marry you  
And take you home  
  
Oh, you move me, yeah  
Darling you move me  
Darling you move me  
Honest you do, honest you do
