I came all around the world just to be with you  
I've been flying supersonic, between black and blue  
I promised I'd be there  
And now I'm here and I won't go  
Before I give you everything I've got  
  
You left everything behind, just to feel that touch  
To join the family of spiders. really means so much  
There's a storm up in the air  
It's the power we all share  
When it runs through our flesh and blood  
  
If your blood is so hot  
Stand up and rock with me  
If your blood is too hot, rock with me  
If your blood is so hot  
Stand up and rock with me  
If your blood is too hot, rock with me  
  
I came all around the world, like on flying wings  
To hear you screaming out for more, still means everything  
Raise your hands up in the air  
I swear to you that I'll be there  
I swear it, in the name of rock  
  
If your blood is so hot  
Stand up and rock with me  
If your blood is too hot, rock with me  
If your blood is so hot  
Stand up and rock with me  
If your blood is too hot, rock with me
