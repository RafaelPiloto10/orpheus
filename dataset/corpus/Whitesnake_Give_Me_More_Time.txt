I want you  
I need your rhyme,  
But, you keep saying, babe,  
It's gonna take time  
I know the heartache  
I put you through,  
Believe me, babe,  
I'm gonna make it up to you  
  
You are the reason  
I'm down on my knees,  
I'm begging you to give me a chance  
If only you would  
Give me just a little more time,  
Give me just a little more time,  
Give me just a little more time,  
Give me just a little more time,  
To prove it to you  
  
So many feelings  
I can't explain,  
I never thought I'd ever cause you any pain  
Now I'm alone here  
An' I can't hide,  
The sun don't shine for me  
Without you by my side  
  
You are the reason  
I'm down on my knees,  
I'm begging you to give me a chance  
If only you would  
Give me just a little more time,  
Give me just a little more time,  
Give me just a little more time,  
Give me just a little more time  
To prove it to you  
  
An' I'm gonna prove it  
  
I want you  
Right by my side  
'Cause you're the only one who keeps me satisfied  
I need your loving,  
I need your charms,  
I can't stand the through of you  
In someone else's arms  
  
You are the reason  
I'm down on my knees,  
I'm begging you to give me a chance  
If only you would  
Give me just a little more time,  
Give me just a little more time,  
Give me just a little more time,  
Give me just a little more time  
To prove it to you  
An' I'm gonna prove it
