O Connie, O Connie,  
I miss you so.  
Where have you gone to?  
O Connie O  
My Connie  
O Connie O  
  
My darling, my darling,  
What changed your mind?  
My heart is broken,  
I'm hurting so,  
My Connie O.  
  
Wasn't it yesterday I held you tight?  
Why did you run away just before our wedding night?  
  
O Connie, O Connie,  
I miss you so.  
Where have you gone to?  
O Connie O  
My Connie  
O Connie O  
  
My darling, my darling,  
What changed your mind?  
My heart is broken,  
I'm hurting so,  
My Connie O.  
  
O Connie O  
O Connie O
