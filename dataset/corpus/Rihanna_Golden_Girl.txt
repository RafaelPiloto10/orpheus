Your place mid-night  
When I come through  
I ring ya doorbell twice  
When I come through  
I do the things you like like  
Like I'm room service  
And don't you take me  
But every chick  
Tryna take all your shit  
Coz I aint even tryna  
Get none of yo shit  
Please I don't want none  
Of your shit  
  
[Chorus:]:  
  
Don't be start struck  
When we go on under these covers  
You can have have a bit  
Of my hand cuffs  
Man a boy just playin along  
I'll give it to you proper  
Play nurse and you play doctor  
Boy you know I got ya (hah)  
I know what you like  
  
You like the way I shine  
I'm 10 times parta a dime  
  
My golden girl  
My golden girl  
  
I've got my shit together  
Even with a chick get a grip  
With hips like this  
  
My golden girl  
My golden girl  
  
Freeze,  
You aint ever had a girl like me  
If you think  
That I'm lying test me, you'll see  
That I'm good on that anger please  
I'm gonna show you how to break it down  
Youve been given none of my love to you  
So don't be start struck  
  
[Chorus:]:  
  
Don't be start struck  
When we go on under these covers  
You can have  
Have a bit of my hand cuffs  
Man a boy just playin along  
I'll give it to you proper  
Play nurse and you play doctor  
Boy you know I got ya (hah)  
I know what you like  
  
You like the way I shine  
I'm 10 times parta a dime  
  
My golden girl  
My golden girl  
  
I've got my shit together  
Even with a chick get a grip  
With hips like this  
  
My golden girl  
My golden girl  
  
You like the way I shine  
I'm 10 times parta a dime  
  
My golden girl  
My golden girl  
  
I've got my shit together  
Even with a chick get a grip  
With hips like this  
  
My golden girl  
My golden girl
