I see a house, a house of stone  
A lonely house, 'cos now you're gone  
Seven rooms, that's all it is, seven rooms of gloom  
I live with emptiness, without your tenderness  
  
You took the dream I had for us, and turned that dream into dust  
I watch a phone that never rings, I watch a door that never rings  
I need you back into my life and turn this darkness into light  
I'm all alone in this house, turn this house into a home  
  
I need your touch to comfort me, your tender tender arms that once held me  
Without your love, your love inside  
This house is just a place to run and hide  
Seven rooms, that's all it is, seven rooms of gloom  
I live with emptiness, without your tenderness  
  
Don't make me live from day to day, watching a clock that ticks away  
Another day, another way, another reason for me to say  
I need you here, here with me, I need you, darlin', desperately  
I'm all alone, all alone in this house that's not a home  
  
I miss your love I once have known, I miss your kiss that was my very very own  
Empty silence surrounds me, lonely walls, they stare  
Seven rooms, that's all it is, seven rooms of gloom  
I live with emptiness, without your tenderness  
  
And all the windows are painted black, I'll wait right here 'til you get back  
I keep waitin' and waitin', 'til your face again I see  
  
(I want you back now) I keep waitin' and waitin', I want you back now  
(I want you back now) I keep waitin' and waitin', c'mon back now  
I keep waitin' and waitin' and waitin', waitin', waitin', waitin'  
(I want you back now) C'mon back now
