I was waiting for somebody  
This afternoon  
Hope that she remembered  
Our rendezvouz  
And when she didn't show  
Just like yesterday  
I do the last, I'll find another way  
One night I saw the stranger  
Across the hall  
I knew he was the reason  
Why she didn't call  
I wish I had imagined  
Or dreamt the lot  
But the heart didn't choose  
The pain I've got  
Now she' turning me inside out  
Upside down  
And me heart is all a roundabout  
Spinnin' round  
She's turnin' me inside out  
Inside out  
She's turnin' me inside out  
Inside out  
Now he's got all so melt  
With a diamond ring  
And she was thinking through  
Almost anything  
She's like a shadow going up  
Seventh avenue  
But so what, she's only going  
Where she's didn't to  
I just got one thing to say  
Just before I go  
Since he was the offender  
I want her to know  
Now my mind has got me the day  
I'm watching to  
I'll never raise a thought  
Of what she'd done
