O gather up the brokenness  
And bring it to me now  
The fragrance of those promises  
You never dared to vow  
  
The splinters that you carry  
The cross you left behind  
Come healing of the body  
Come healing of the mind  
  
And let the heavens hear it  
The penitential hymn  
Come healing of the spirit  
Come healing of the limb  
  
Behold the gates of mercy  
In arbitrary space  
And none of us deserving  
The cruelty or the grace  
  
O solitude of longing  
Where love has been confined  
Come healing of the body  
Come healing of the mind  
  
O see the darkness yielding  
That tore the light apart  
Come healing of the reason  
Come healing of the heart  
  
O troubled dust concealing  
An undivided love  
The heart beneath is teaching  
To the broken heart above  
  
Let the heavens falter  
Let the earth proclaim  
Come healing of the altar  
Come healing of the name  
  
O longing of the branches  
To lift the little bud  
O longing of the arteries  
To purify the blood  
  
And let the heavens hear it  
The penitential hymn  
Come healing of the spirit  
Come healing of the limb  
  
O let the heavens hear it  
The penitential hymn  
Come healing of the spirit  
Come healing of the limb
