This is your life, you've got problems with your wife  
She was makin' mashed potatoes now she gives you Minute Rice  
And she used to do your laundry now she sends it out instead  
And she always made believe that she was satisfied in bed  
  
That's what she used to say but that's how things were yesterday  
Looks like the good ole days were gone  
That's how she used to be but that goes down as history  
Time has the way of movin' on  
  
Oh I know she was there when you needed lovin' care  
When she only used the car to drive the children everywhere  
And I'm sure she washed the windows I'm sure she waxed doors  
But now she doesn't call you her Prince Charming anymore  
  
That's what she used to say but that's how things were yesterday  
Looks like the good ole days were gone  
That's how she used to be but that goes down as history  
Time has the way of movin' on  
  
She's not the sweet little girl that she was before  
You're not the end of the world anymore, you're not the end of the world  
  
She wins when you fight and she goes to school at night  
She leaves you home to babysit and watch "The Price Is Right"  
And she wants the joint 2 count to see where all the money goes  
So she doesn't have to talk you into buying all the clothes, solo  
  
[humming "da-da-da"]  
  
That's what she used to say but that what things were yesterday  
Looks like the good ole days was bored  
That's how she used to be but that goes down as history  
Time bridged the way of movin' on  
  
She's not your li--little girl that she was before  
You're not the end of the world anymore, you're not the end of the world...
End
