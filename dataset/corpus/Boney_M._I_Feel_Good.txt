What a beautiful morning  
Just to wake up beside you  
Is something I've missed for so long  
I'm so glad that you came back home  
  
Baby let me tell you  
How my days slipped away  
And how I was afraid of the night  
But now I'm alright  
  
I feel good  
Feeling like a lover should  
What else can I say  
Won't forget the day  
You came back to stay  
I feel so good (i feel good, I feel good, I feel good)  
Finally we understood  
You and me were meant  
True lovers from the start  
We can never part  
  
Our love is grown stronger  
More than any temptation  
In this world could possibly be  
There's no doubt 'cause it's plain to see  
  
I feel good  
Feeling like a lover should  
What else can I say  
Won't forget the day  
You came back to stay  
I feel so good (i feel good, I feel good, I feel good)  
Finally we understood  
You and me were meant  
True lovers from the start  
We can never part  
  
I feel good  
Feeling like a lover should  
What else can I say  
Won't forget the day  
You came back to stay  
I feel so good (i feel good, I feel good, I feel good)  
Finally we understood  
You and me...
