I'm so far away from everything you know  
Your name is carried, carried on the wind  
Oh your ice blue waters Anya, where do they flow?  
Where have they been? Ah where have they been?  
A hidden passion touching a spark  
Flame of revolution burning wild in your gypsy heart  
Oh your gypsy heart  
Anya Anya the spirit of freedom  
Anya Anya ooh Anya  
  
The light of freedom buried deep within your soul  
Across the puszta plain to see  
The rhapsody of angels refuse to dance alone  
What do they mean? Oh what do they mean?  
Your jewel flashing across the dark  
Forbidding distance, I love your gypsy heart  
Oh your gypsy heart  
Anya Anya the spirit of freedom  
Anya Anya ooh Anya  
  
Jewel flashing across the dark  
Forbidding distance, I love your gypsy heart  
Oh your gypsy heart  
Anya Anya the spirit of freedom  
Anya Anya ooh Anya
