Mornin', Mrs. Campbell  
Lovely day today  
I heard about the fire  
I wonder what the papers say  
  
Let's see now:  
Give me fifty shotgun shells  
And a hundred feet of rope  
Just add that to my bill  
  
Says here there ain't no hope  
They all were burned alive  
And four packs of cigarettes  
No, I think I'll make it five  
  
I heard about the wedding  
I'm so happy for the bride  
Why that fire house looked mighty nice  
And the whole town swelled with pride  
  
We've watched her grow to womanhood  
She's found an upright man  
She'll learn this life ain't easy  
You do the best you can  
  
No, no, my family ain't so good  
My wife just had a spell  
And I can't afford the medicine  
She needs to make her well  
  
I've been laid off at that factory  
For sixteen months or more  
I came home last Wednesday evenin'  
I found her lyin' on the floor  
  
Bye now, Mrs. Campbell  
Say howdy to your son  
You can tell him we'll go huntin'  
When he gets a bigger gun  
  
It was too bad about that fire  
But don't you get me wrong  
We've gotta teach these people  
How to stay where they belong
