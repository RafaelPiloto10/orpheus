Hey, hey, good lookin', whatcha got cookin'  
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?  
Hey, hey, sweet baby, don't you think maybe  
We could find us a brand new recipe?  
  
I got a hot rod Ford and a two dollar bill  
And I know a spot right over the hill  
There's soda pop and the dancin's free  
If you wanna have fun come along with me  
  
Hey, hey, good lookin', whatcha got cookin'  
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?  
  
I'm free and ready so we can go steady  
How's about savin' all your time for me?  
No more lookin', I know, I've been tooken  
How's about keepin' steady company?  
  
I'm gonna throw my date book over the fence  
Find me one for five or ten cents  
Keep it till it's covered with age  
Cause I'm writin' your name down on every page  
  
Say hey, good lookin', whatcha got cookin'  
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?
