I'm scared of swimming in the sea  
Dark shapes moving under me  
Every fear I swallow makes me small  
Inconsequential things occur  
Alarms are triggered  
Memories stir  
It's not the way it has to be  
  
I'm afraid of what I do not know  
I hate being undermined  
I'm afraid I can be devil man  
And I'm scared to be divine  
Don't mess with me my fuse is short  
Beneath this skin these fragments caught  
  
When I allow it to be  
There's no control over me  
I have my fears  
But they do not have me  
  
Walking through the undergrowth, to the house in the woods  
The deeper I go, the darker it gets  
I peer through the window  
Knock at the door  
And the monster I was  
So afraid of  
Lies curled up on the floor  
Is curled up on the floor just like a baby boy  
  
I cry until I laugh  
  
I'm afraid of being mothered  
With my balls shut in the pen  
I'm afraid of loving women  
And I'm scared of loving men  
Flashbacks coming in every night  
Don't tell me everything's alright  
  
When I allow it to be  
It has no control over me  
I own my fear  
So it doesn't own me  
  
Walking through the undergrowth, to the house in the woods  
The deeper I go, the darker it gets  
I peer through the window  
Knock at the door  
And the monster I was  
So afraid of  
Lies curled up on the floor  
Is curled up on the floor just like a baby boy  
  
I cry until I laugh
