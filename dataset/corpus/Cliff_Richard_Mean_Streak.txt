Well, you stand there honey, with you hands on your hips  
Well, its stoppin your feeling, baby, button your lips  
Yeah, you stand there honey with the devil in your eyes  
You say youre gonna leave me, but I know its a lie  
  
Uh uh honey, you got a mean streak  
Uh uh baby, you got a mean streak  
Well, if you wanna stay with me, be my lovin honey  
You must lose your mean streak  
  
You look so cute and you walk so nice  
Oh but your hide is as mean and as cold as ice  
Well, I found my heart, it was a big kind of faster  
And I know I was living in disaster  
  
Uh uh honey, you got a mean streak  
Uh uh baby, you got a mean streak  
Well, if you wanna stay with me, be my lovin honey  
You must lose your mean streak

Well, you took my love and you threw it away  
And I know whats gonna happen to you someday  
  
Uh uh honey, you got a mean streak  
Uh uh baby, you got a mean streak  
Well, if you wanna stay with me, be my lovin honey  
You must lose your mean streak
