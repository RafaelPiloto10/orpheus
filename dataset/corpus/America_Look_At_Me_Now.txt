(Gerry Beckley)  
  
I'm feelin' alright  
I'm sleepin' OK  
I'm getting to work on time  
But everything else I guess  
Has really turned out a mess  
Oohhh  
  
What can I do  
What can I say  
Nothing will change your mind  
I'm thinkin' that I should call  
But baby I'm not that kind  
  
Woman look at me now  
I'm doing better on my own somehow  
Woman I'm making my way through the day now  
Hey now  
Woman look what you've done  
Unleashed this fool on everyone  
Woman I'm making my way through the day  
  
I'm shining my shirt  
I've ironed my shoes  
I think that I'm lookin' fine  
I'm getting all kinds of looks  
Forgot how much time it took  
  
I run out of gas  
I fall on my ass  
It's happenin' all the time  
What am I doing wrong  
I'm practicing all day long  
  
Woman look at me now  
I'm doing better on my own somehow  
Woman I'm making my way through the day now  
Hey now  
Woman look what you've done  
Unleashed this fool on everyone  
Woman I'm making my way through the day  
  
Life is so strange  
Roles constantly changing  
Hey hey hey  
  
Woman look at me now  
I'm doing better on my own somehow  
Woman look what you've done  
Unleashed this fool on everyone  
Woman look at me now  
Dih diddah dih diddah  
Woman look at me now  
Dih diddah diddah  
Woman look at me now  
Di diddah di diddah  
Woman look at me now
