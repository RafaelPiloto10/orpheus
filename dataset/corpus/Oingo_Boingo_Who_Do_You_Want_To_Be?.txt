Who do you want to be today?  
Who do you want to be?  
Who do you want to be today?  
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?  
Oh boredom is so terrible, it's like a dread disease  
Nothing could be worse than when there's nothing on TV  
I'd rather be a cowboy than to stare blank at the walls  
I've been reborn so many times, I can't remember them all  
Who do you want to be today?  
Who do you want to be?  
Who do you want to be today?  
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?  
Just like someone on TV  
I think I'll be a teddy boy, I think I'll be a hunk  
I think I'll be a tough guy and I think I'll be a punk  
I might just be a fashion star all dressed in frilly rags  
Or perhaps, I'll cross the other side and walk around in drag!  
Who do you want to be today?  
Who do you want to be?  
Who do you want to be today?  
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?  
Just like somebody on TV  
Do you like to be just like a rock  
In the middle of the sea  
Do you want to suffer by yourself  
In a pool of blissful misery  
Do you want to feel like a saint in artists' clothes  
With a rosary in your hand  
Do you wanna be crazy like Van Gogh  
Like a stranger in a strange, strange land  
Would you rather push the buttons  
And be feared by all humanity  
Or perhaps you'd like to be a bum  
Do you wanna be stupid, just like me  
Who do you want to be today?  
Who do you want to be?  
Who do you want to be today?  
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?  
Just like somebody on TV  
Who do you want to be today?  
Who do you want to be today?  
Who do you want to be today?  
Who do you want to be today?  
Who do you want to be today?  
Who do you want to be?  
Who do you want to be today?  
Who do you want to be?
