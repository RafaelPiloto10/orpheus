I'm sorry that I hurt you  
I took for granted all you gave so freely to me  
I prayed it's not too late  
To save you from a broken heart  
To promise you I'll make a brand new start  
Believe me when I say  
  
Chorus  
You are all that I need  
The only treasure I see  
You're the air that helps me breathe  
Through the darkest night  
When I fall down on my knees  
I was blind but now I see  
You are all that I need  
  
When no one far from perfect  
Like a child that needs a guiding hand  
Can you stay here with me  
I finally understand  
You've always been the missing part  
Complete the jigsaw puzzle of my heart  
Please hear me when I say  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Please let me hear your voice again  
Let me hear you say your love will never end  
That whatever it takes you'll be there  
When I say  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
You are all that I need
