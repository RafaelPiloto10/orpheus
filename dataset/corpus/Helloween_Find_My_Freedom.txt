Why you come tonight to take my live?  
I know one day it's time to go  
Why don't you give me one more chance?  
I know that I can try to die another time  
Don't wait for me, I'm gonna stay  
Because there's much more to get clear  
  
You are always on time  
Patiently you wait for me  
But you know I'm always too late  
Try another day  
  
I don't know where to go  
When the time has come for me  
Is it heaven or hell?  
Well you'll tell me again  
Tell I know what to do  
In the endless shades of space  
Is it heaven or hell?  
You will tell me again  
To find my freedom  
  
Hey, come on  
Go date an other mate  
I bade you once ago to go  
But now you're back too soon again  
You said that I could pay  
When all my fear would stay away  
Instead my life is high and dry  
I'm still afraid to die  
  
You are always on time  
Patiently you wait for me  
But you know I'm always too late  
Come another day  
  
I don't know where to go  
When the time has come for me  
Is it heaven or hell?  
Well you'll tell me again  
Tell I know what to do  
In the endless shades of space  
Is it heaven or hell?  
You will tell me again  
To find my freedom  
Everlasting freedom
