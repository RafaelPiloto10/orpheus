Awakened by the sunlight  
Victimized by the light  
Memories flashin' through my head  
WasI born or am I dead?  
Yesterday's forgotten, the morning after  
I can taste you, I can hear your laughter  
Fading in the distance  
Recollections drifting  
Bloodstains on my tattered clothes  
Each minute the fear grows  
If I could just lay down to rest  
I'm tired of searching for myself  
If I am dead, how can I feel such love?  
If I am dead, why am I dreaming?  
If I am dead, where do I go from here?  
If I am dead, why does this pain feel so good?  
Is this blood dried upon my face?  
Or is it the love of someone else?  
It tastes so sweet, just like you used to  
So rescue me my love, splice us together  
I remember loving you so much  
But where are you and where's your fatal touch?  
When I closed my eyes, was it my siesta?  
Did I encounter a darkness stronger than sleep?  
I am thirsty for my sleep  
There are no answers anyway.
