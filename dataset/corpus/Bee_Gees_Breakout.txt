It don't matter who you are  
Anyone can be a star  
Brighter than the lightning  
You go as far as you go  
You got to be what you know  
  
There may be somebody out to get the better of you  
You need the one good woman to keep you alive  
Don't let the pressure beat a hole in your head  
Remember nobody left you on the railway line  
And if the one shoe fits you've got a chance this time  
  
Breakout  
Ain't no one gonna break your heart  
You'll never do it if you never start  
You be there  
Breakout now  
  
You gotta be a story told  
And baby , no one gonna steal your soul  
You be there  
If you believe in tomorrow and you wait all night  
You've got it all and then you're lost in flight  
  
There are diamonds in the street  
But you don't get enough to eat  
Walking on a wire  
There is a future unknown  
Nobody does it alone  
  
And maybe you can be the thunder  
If you follow your dream  
There must be one good woman to show you the way  
Don't let them make you feel you're less than you are  
Remember , somebody calls you on the telephone line  
And all the world gets crazy and you win this time  
  
Breakout  
Ain't no one gonna break your heart  
You'll never do it if you never start  
You be there  
  
Breakout now  
You gotta be the story told  
And baby , no one's gonna steal your soul  
You be there  
  
If you believe in tomorrow and you wait all night  
You've got it all and then you're lost in flight  
  
Breakout now  
Ain't no one gonna break your heart  
You'll never do it if you never start  
You be there  
  
Breakout now  
You gotta be the story told  
And baby , no one's gonna steal your soul  
You be there  
If you believe in tomorrow and you wait all night  
  
Breakout now  
You gotta be the story told  
And baby , no one's gonna steal your soul  
You be there  
If you believe in tomorrow and you wait all night ( fade)
