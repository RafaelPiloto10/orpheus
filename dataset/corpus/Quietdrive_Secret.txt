Hey, bride of mine  
I love you  
So why'd you find another  
Who would make  
Love with you?  
  
Death do us part  
Might be true  
Before the doctor asks me  
What did I do  
What did I do  
  
Hey, here's a crime  
If you've got time  
I'll tell you just what I'll do  
(Can you keep a secret, secret?)  
  
Hey, bow down low  
Does it go  
When your friends don't even know  
(You think I'm innocent)  
  
I'm just an arrogant boy  
Now you've found me out  
I'm just an arrogant boy  
I'm the last one around  
How did I get myself  
Into this secret?  
Into a secret?  
  
Hey, is it real?  
Want to feel  
Dark regret for what you've done  
(Can you keep a secret, secret?)  
  
Hey, bow down low  
Does it go  
When your friends don't even know  
(You think I'm innocent)  
  
I'm just an arrogant boy  
Now you've found me out  
I'm just an arrogant boy  
I'm the last one around  
How did I get myself  
Into this secret?  
Into a secret?  
  
What did I do?  
What did I do?  
  
Hey, bow down low  
Does it go  
When your friends don't even know  
(You think I'm innocent)  
  
I'm just an arrogant boy  
Now you've found me out  
I'm just an arrogant boy  
I'm the last one around  
I'm not the only one  
That can hear you  
That can hear you whisper  
I should have know  
To never trust you  
Now I'm sinking deeper  
Why did I get myself  
Into a secret?  
Into a secret?  
Why did I get myself  
Into a secret?  
(Into a secret?)
