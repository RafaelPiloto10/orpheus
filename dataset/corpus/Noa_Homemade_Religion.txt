Stop.  
It' s 3: 15  
You have one minute.  
Are you ready?  
  
Now think of all things created  
Think of those that you care for  
Think of what you've been blessed with  
And everything that makes you afraid  
  
Wish for anything  
Let yourself dream  
Wish for things to get better  
Until 3: 16  
  
There's a stone in my garden that keeps me committed  
And close to the ground when I feel I should run  
There's a branch in my window that helps me remember  
To reach out my arms and touch the sun..  
  
There are two million ants that live in my sidewalk  
Working together to nurture and feed  
And the old tv set, with the sad evening news  
So I never forget how much love we need  
  
Home-made religion  
(In my kitchen)  
Home-made religion..  
  
Think of how you've been feeling  
And how you've made others feel  
Think of what you've been given  
And what you need to heal  
  
Wish for anything..  
Try to keep still  
Wish for things to get better  
And maybe they will  
  
There' s a plant in the corner that helps me remember  
All of the beauty that grows from a seed  
And the old tv set, with the sad evening news  
So I never forget how much love we need  
  
Home-made religion  
(In my kitchen)  
Home-made religion..  
  
Stop.
