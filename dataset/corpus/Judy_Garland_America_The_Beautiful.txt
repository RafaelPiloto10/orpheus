O beautiful, for spacious skies  
For amber waves of grain  
For purple mountain majesties  
Above the fruited plain  
  
America, America  
God shed His grace on thee  
And crown thy good with brotherhood  
From sea to shining sea  
  
O beautiful, for heroes proved  
In liberating strife  
Who more than self, their country loved  
And mercy more than life  
  
America, America  
God shed His grace on thee  
And crown thy good with brotherhood  
From sea to shining sea  
  
America, America  
God shed His grace on thee  
And crown thy good with brotherhood  
From sea to shining sea
