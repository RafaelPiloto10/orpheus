Yeah, my baby left me this morning  
And I don't care now, I don't care what the people say  
  
Yeah, I did everything that I could, everything I could,  
Lord knows I did everything I could  
I tried to satisfy her worried mind, that's what I did  
  
You know she was nothing but trouble, trouble  
She keep me worried all the time  
God knows her movements are killing me  
  
Yeah, my baby stayed out all night long, all night long  
She keep me worried all the time  
  
Yeah, I lay down last night I was thinking  
Must I kill that woman? Must I kill that woman?  
Oh Lord I get down on my knees  
They tell me God forgivin' everything you do  
But I don't care what the people say  
I'm gonna kill that woman,  
I'm gonna kill that woman, God knows  
I'm gonna get down on my knees
