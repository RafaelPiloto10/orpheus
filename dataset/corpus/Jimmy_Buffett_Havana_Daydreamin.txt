Stashed his trash in Ecuador, bought a good suit of clothes.  
Flew on up to Mexico, standin' by the shore.  
Waiting for some mystery man, to pay him for his time.  
Thinkin' about all the money he made,  
couldn't help to ease his mind  
Havana daydreamin' oh he's just dreamin' his life away.  
  
Daddy shucked that sugar cane,  
One day he fell dead.  
Jesus had a wanderin' feelin'  
Swimmin around in his head.  
Sailin' on a midnight boat,  
There were no questions asked,  
Water's so green and the air was so clean  
That he stuck right to his task, Havana daydreamin',  
Oh he's just schemin', his life away.  
  
Ceilin' fan stirs the air  
Cigar smoke did swirl,  
A fragrance on the pillow case  
And he thinks about the girl.  
Spillin' wine wine and sharin' good times  
She sure could make him smile.  
He pays her well but what the hell  
He'll be movin' in a little while, Havana daydreamin',  
Havana daydreamin'  
Oh he'll be dreamin' his life away.
