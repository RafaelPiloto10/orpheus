Standing here  
The old man said to me  
Long before these crowded streets  
Here stood my dreaming tree  
Below it he would sit  
For hours at a time  
Now progress takes away  
What forever took to find  
And now he's falling hard  
He feels the falling dark  
How he longs to be  
Beneath his dreaming tree  
Conquered fear to climb  
A moment froze in time  
When the girl who first he kissed  
Promised him she'd be his  
Remembered mother's words  
There beneath the tree  
No matter what the world  
You'll always be my baby  
Mommy come quick  
The dreaming tree has died  
The air is growing thick  
A fear he cannot hide  
The dreaming tree has died  
  
Oh  
Have you no pity  
This thing I do  
I do not deny it  
All through this smile  
As crooked as danger  
I do not deny  
I know in my mind  
I would leave you now  
If I had the strength to  
I would leave you up  
To your own devices  
Will you not talk  
Can you take pity  
I don't ask much  
But won't you speak  
Please  
  
From the start  
She knew she had it made  
Easy up 'til then  
For sure she'd make the grade  
Adorers came in hordes  
To lay down in her wake  
She gave it all she had  
But treasures slowly fade  
Now she's falling hard  
She feels the fall of dark  
How did this fall apart  
She drinks to fill it up  
A smile of sweetest flowers  
Wilted so and soured  
Black tears stain the cheeks  
That once were so admired  
She thinks when she was small  
There on her father's knee  
How he had promised her  
You'll always be my baby  
Daddy come quick  
The dreaming tree has died  
I can't find my way home  
There is no place to hide  
The dreaming tree has died  
  
Oh  
If I had the strength to  
I would leave you up  
To your own devices  
Will you not talk  
Can you take pity  
I don't ask much  
But won't you speak  
Please  
  
Take me back  
Take me back  
Take me back  
Take me back  
Take me back  
Take me back  
Take me back  
Save me please
