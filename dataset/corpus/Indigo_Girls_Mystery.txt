Each time you'd pull down the driveway  
I wasn't sure when I would see you again  
Yours was a twisted blind sided highway  
No matter which road you took then  
Oh you set up your place in my thoughts  
Moved in and made my thinking crowded  
Now we're out in the back with the barking dogs  
My heart the red sun  
Your heart the moon clouded  
I could go crazy on a night like tonight  
When summer's beginning to give up her fight  
And every thought's a possibility  
And the voices are heard but nothing is seen  
Why do you spend this time with me  
Maybe an equal mystery  
  
So what is love then is it dictated or chosen  
(Handed down and made by hand)  
Does it sing like the hymns of 1000 years  
Or is it just pop emotion  
(Handed down and made by hand)  
And if it ever was there and it left  
Does it mean it was never true  
And to exist it must elude  
Is that why I think these things of you  
I could go crazy on a night like tonight  
When summer's beginning to give up her fight  
And every thought's a possibility  
And the voices are heard but nothing is seen  
Why do you spend this time with me  
May be an equal mystery  
  
But you like the taste of danger  
It shines like sugar on your lips  
And you like to stand in the line of fire  
Just to show you can shoot straight from you hip  
There must be a 1000 things you would die for  
I can hardly think of two  
But not everything is better spoken aloud  
Not when I'm talking to you  
  
Oh the pirate gets the ship and the girl tonight  
Breaks a bottle to christen her  
Basking in the exploits of her thief  
She's a very good listener  
Maybe that's all that we need  
Is to meet in the middle of impossibility  
We're standing at opposite poles  
Equal partners in a mystery  
(Handed down and made by hand)  
  
We're standing at opposite poles  
Equal partners in a mystery
