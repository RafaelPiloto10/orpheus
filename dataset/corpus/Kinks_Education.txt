In a deep dark jungle long time ago  
Lived a lonesome caveman  
He was a solitary soul  
And he spent his playtime  
Chewing meat from bones.  
He didn't know how to talk much  
He only knew how to groan  
Then he lifted up his hands and reached to the sky  
Let out a yell and no one replied.  
Frustration and torment tore him inside  
Then he fell to the ground and he cried and he cried.  
But then education saved the day.  
He learned to speak and communicate  
Education saved the day.  
He thanked God for the friends he made.  
Cause everybody needs an education  
Everybody needs an education.  
Black skin, red skin, yellow or white,  
Everybody needs to read and write  
Everybody needs an education.  
  
Thank the day when that primitive man  
Learned to talk with his brothers  
And live off the land.  
He left his cave and he moved far away  
And he lived with his friends in a house that they'd made  
He learned to think and to work with his brain  
And he astounded his friends with all the knowledge he gained  
  
He wrote it down on a rock that he found  
And he showed all his friends and they passed it around  
And then education came that day.  
The day it came was a sacred day.  
Education came that day  
He thanked God for the friends he'd made.  
  
Well man built a boat and he learned how to sail  
And he traveled far and wide  
Then he looked up above saw the stars in the sky  
So he learned how to fly.  
Thanks to all the mathematicians  
And the inventors with their high I.Q.s  
And the professors in their colleges  
Trying to feed me knowledge  
That I know I'll never use.  
Thank you sir for the millions of words  
That you've handed me down and you've told me t
