Say it ain't so Jo, please, say it ain't so  
That's not what I wanna hear Jo  
And I got a right to know  
Say it ain't so Jo, please, say it ain't so  
I'm sure they're telling us lies Jo  
Please tell us it ain't so  
They told us that our hero has played his trump card  
He doesn't know how to go on  
We're clinging to his charm and determined smile  
The good old days have gone  
The image and the empire may be falling apart  
The money has gotten scarce  
One man's word held the country together  
But the truth is getting fierce  
Say it ain't so Jo, please, say it ain't so  
We pinned our hopes on you Jo  
And they're ruining our show  
Ooh baby don't you think  
We're gonna get burned  
Ooh baby don't you think  
We're gonna get burned  
We're gonna get turned  
We're gonna get burned  
Yes we're gonna get turned  
We're gonna get burned  
We're gonna get turned  
Yes, we're gonna get burned  
We're gonna get burned  
We're gonna get burned  
Yes we're gonna get turned  
We're gonna get burned  
Say it ain't so Jo, please, say it ain't so  
That's not what I wanna hear Jo  
And I got a right to know  
Say it ain't so Jo, please, say it ain't so  
I'm sure they're telling us lies Jo  
Please tell us it ain't so  
Say it ain't so Jo, please, say it ain't so  
That's not what I wanna hear Jo  
And I got a right to know  
Say it ain't so Jo, please, say it ain't so  
I'm sure they're telling us lies Jo  
Please tell us it ain't so  
Say it ain't so
