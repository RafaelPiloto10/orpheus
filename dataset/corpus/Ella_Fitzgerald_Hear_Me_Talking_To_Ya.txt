Ramblin' man makes no change in me  
I'm going to ramble back to my used-to-be  
Aww, you hear me talkin' to ya  
I don't bite my tongue  
You wanna be my man?  
You gotta fetch it with you when you come  
  
Eve and Adam in a garden takin' a chance  
Adam didn't take time to get his pants  
Aww, you hear me talkin' to ya  
I don't bite my tongue  
You wanna be my man?  
You gotta fetch it with ya when you come  
  
I don't care whether they're old or young  
When the chips were down, they have trouble along  
I guess you hear me talkin' to ya  
I don't bite my tongue  
You wanna be my man?  
You gotta fetch it with ya when you come  
  
Hello sayin' true give me 6 0 9  
What takes gettin' in these  
His or mine?  
Hear me talkin' to ya  
I don't bite my tongue  
You wanna be my man?  
You gotta fetch it with you when you come
