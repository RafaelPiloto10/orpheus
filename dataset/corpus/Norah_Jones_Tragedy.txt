[Intro]  
It's a tragedy  
It's a tragedy  
It's a tragedy  
It's a tragedy  
  
[Verse 1]  
He was only 25  
Had an open heart and tender mind  
He sang through all the hymns he knew  
He was searching for a higher sign  
When his water was turned to wine  
All the darkness became light  
Babies and a patient wife  
They just weren't enough to keep him high  
So he gave them up  
Just to fill his cup  
Every sip would make him feel alive  
No bones in his body were dry  
  
[Chorus]  
It's a tragedy  
It's a tragedy  
It's a tragedy  
It's a tragedy  
  
[Verse 2]  
Now he's finally coming around  
He's got wrinkles and a crooked frown  
He holds back tears thinking of the years  
That the bottle had a long time, down  
So he'd sit and have another round  
Singing Hallelujah till he drowns  
  
[Chorus]  
It's a tragedy  
It's a tragedy  
It's a tragedy  
It's a tragedy  
It's a tragedy  
It's a tragedy  
It's a tragedy  
It's a tragedy
