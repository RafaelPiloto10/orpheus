She took my hand and said "Let's go together"  
"You and me against the world"  
And so we stuck it out through still and stormy weather  
And so we tumbled down the years  
I took her hand and said "Let's go together"  
Just you and me against the world  
  
Let's go together  
Stay together  
We'll tumble down the years  
And we'll come to find the key behind it all  
  
We never stopped to see if we were still in step  
We never checked each other's eyes  
To see who lived in there behind them  
And down the years we disappeared  
  
Let's go together  
Say no together  
We'll tumble down the years  
Let's try together  
Let's lie together  
We'll tumble down the years  
  
And though we never found the key behind it all  
I think we came to know the meaning of the fall  
  
Let's go together  
We said "forever"  
You and me against the world  
Hold on together  
And damn the river  
We'll tumble down the years  
We'll tumble down the years  
We'll tumble down the years
