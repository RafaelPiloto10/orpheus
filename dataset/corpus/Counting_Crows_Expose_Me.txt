I have so many talents  
I'm afraid to show them  
People may not like them  
  
So they're hidden  
Hidden within  
Where no one can hate them!  
Or appreciate them?  
  
I have so many dreams  
I'm afraid to reveal them  
People may not accept them  
  
So they're hidden  
Hidden within  
Where no one can kill them!  
Or fulfill them?  
  
I have so many beautiful thoughts  
I'm afraid to share them  
People may ignore them  
  
So they're hidden  
Hidden within  
Where no one can ignore them!  
Or enjoy them?  
  
I hate to hid  
I hide cause I'm lonely  
I need someone who will expose me  
  
Is it you?
