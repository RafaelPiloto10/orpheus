Over the hills they came from the valley  
Making innuendos about my lack of talent, oh well  
They say that when I'm supposed to be singing  
All I 'm really doing is yelling, oh well  
To you I say  
  
Break out or get out  
Then they say that I can't sing  
That I don't say a thing  
That I make everything up oh well  
To you I say  
  
Break out or get out  
Break out or get out  
  
Get out of your mind  
Cause it's much too small  
And there's so much going on
