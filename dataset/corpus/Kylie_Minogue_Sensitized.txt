Sensitized by every word that you say  
Boy you got me messed up  
But I like it that way  
  
Tantalized just too good to refuse  
When I try to stop ya  
You keep blowing my fuse  
  
Can't deny how hot the feeling  
If the body could fly  
I'd hit the ceiling cause I  
  
[Chorus 1]  
Can't hold back, the minute I try  
Baby you trip the switch and I'm sensitized  
Every touch, whatever you do  
Baby you trip the switch, I turn on for you  
  
Energized by all the pleasure and pain  
Boy got that something  
That burns a spark to the flame  
  
Look at me, you got me begging for more  
'Cause you got that one thing  
I hadn't discovered before  
  
Can't deny how rude I'm feeling  
If the body could talk  
You'd hear me screaming cause I  
  
[Chorus 1]  
  
I'm sensitized tonight and you can watch me come alive  
I'm sensitized tonight and you can watch me come alive  
I'm sensitized tonight and you can watch me come alive  
I'm sensitized tonight, I'm sensitized tonight  
  
[Chorus 2]  
I can't hold back, the minute I try  
Baby you trip the switch and I'm sensitized  
Every touch, whatever you do  
Baby you trip the switch, I turn on for you, I turn on for you  
  
[Chorus 2]  
  
I come alive  
Baby you know it's true, I feel this for you  
I come alive  
Baby you know it's true, I feel this for you  
  
I come alive  
I come alive
