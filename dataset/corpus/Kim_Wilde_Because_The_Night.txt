Take me now, baby, here as I am  
Put me close, try and understand  
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe  
Love is a banquet on which we feed  
  
Come on now, try and understand  
The way I feel when I'm in your hands  
Take my hand, come under cover  
They can't hurt you now,  
Can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now  
  
Because the night belongs to lovers  
Because the night belongs to lust  
Because the night belongs to lovers  
Because the night belongs to us  
  
Have I doubt, baby, when I'm alone  
Love is a ring, a telephone  
Love is an angel, disguised as lust  
Here in our bed 'til the morning comes  
  
Come on now try and understand  
The way I feel under your command  
Take my hand as the sun descends  
They can't hurt you now,  
Can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now  
  
Because the night belongs to lovers  
Because the night belongs to lust  
Because the night belongs to lovers  
Because the night belongs to us  
  
With love we sleep  
With doubt the vicious circle  
Turns and burns  
Without you I cannot breathe  
Forgive, the yearning burning  
I believe it's time to heal to feel  
So touch me now, touch me now, touch me now  
  
Because the night belongs to lovers  
Because the night belongs to lust  
Because the night belongs to lovers  
Because the night belongs to us  
  
Have I doubt when I am alone  
Love is a ring on the telephone
