He said "I'll love you till I die",  
She told him "You'll forget in time"  
As the years went slowly by,  
She still preyed upon his mind  
  
He kept her picture on his wall,  
Went half-crazy now and then  
He still loved her through it all,  
Hoping she'd come back again  
  
Kept some letters by his bed  
Dated nineteen sixty-two  
He had underlined in red  
Every single "I love you"  
  
I went to see him just today,  
Oh but I didn't see no tears  
All dressed up to go away, first time  
I'd seen him smile in years  
  
He stopped loving her today  
They placed a wreath upon his door  
And soon they'll carry him away  
He stopped loving her today  
  
You know,  
She came to see him one last time.  
Aww, 'n' we all wondered if she would.  
And it kept runnin' through my mind  
"This time he's over her for good."  
  
He stopped loving her today  
They placed a wreath upon his door  
And soon they'll carry him away  
He stopped loving her today
