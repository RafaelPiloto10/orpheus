Ahh It still feels good  
You were always there to bring me breakfast in bed  
And when I stayed out late you had some powder for my head  
I've been a bad man  
But you never paid no mind  
  
[Chorus]  
We've had some long nights  
But we're alright this time  
  
I believe in something I just don't know what it is  
And every time I climb I wind up back on the skids  
You always stood by me  
When the natives start to whine  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
You're like an angel with a 12 gauge (Lock and load)  
You're like a wheelman on a get-away (Hit the road)  
And together we ride  
You ain't Bonnie I ain't Clyde  
But we made out of town just the same  
I could take a taxi but it's better when you drive  
You always come between me and the mess outside  
I could buy you a ring  
But you'd rather have the cash  
Ha ha and that don't even rhyme  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And together we ride  
You ain't Bonnie I ain't Clyde  
But we made it out of town just the same  
I could take a taxi but it's better when you drive  
You always come between me and the mess outside  
I could buy you a ring  
But you'd rather have the cash  
Ha ha and that don't even rhyme  
  
[Chorus: x3]
