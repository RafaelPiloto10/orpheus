Slipped in this morning with the lights still in your eyes  
You got all tangled up in your little white lies  
I won't let it go won't let it get that far  
I swear I'm gonna catch you with your fingers in the honey jar  
  
(Ann chuckles) "that's right"  
  
I'll get to the truth if it's the last thing I do.  
I got my risin suspicions got me eye on you  
Do you think I don't see it do you take me for a fool ?  
Got my risin suspicion got my eye on you  
  
If you got something to say well I think you better tell us now.  
Your deluding yourself if you think I'm getting jealous baby.  
I'll get to the truth if it's the last thing I do  
I got my risin suspicion Got my eye on you.  
Do you think I don't see it do you take me for a fool ?  
Got my risin suspicion got my eye on you.  
  
2 x 4 x 6 x 9 just don't add up no more than your lies.  
I'll get to the truth if it's the last thing I do  
I've got my risin suspicion got my eye on you  
Do you think I don't see it do you take me for a fool ?  
I've got my risin suspicion , emm hmmm  
I'll get to the truth if it's the last thing I do.  
I got my Risin suspicion I got my eye on you.
