I come from California  
Where you say no one grows old  
And y'all drive to fast.  
But you say it so slow.  
In that southern style, baby  
That always drives me crazy.  
And I start to laugh.  
  
Cause, I have never been to Memphis  
But if you're there  
I will pack my bag, and go.  
Cause I don't care, if it never rains here,  
The suns always shining.  
I have never met a girl like you  
And I'm tired of trying.  
I have never been to Memphis.  
  
You're all crazy about Jesus  
Back where you're from.  
You got baptized in rivers  
Where the deep waters run.  
That's alright by me,  
Yeah I love that you believe in  
Something you can't touch,  
Something you can't see.  
  
Cause, I have never been to Memphis  
But if you're there  
I will pack my bag, and go.  
Even though, never been afraid of flying  
But I am afraid to fall.  
I've been painting by numbers you've been  
Just splashing them on the wall.  
And I see the colors running  
It lets me know which way to go.  
  
After all  
(After all)  
Yeah, After all  
(After all)  
I've got to get myself there, oh yeah  
You know I've got to get myself there  
  
Cause I have never been to Memphis  
But if you're there.  
I'm on my way  
(Oh, oh oh oh)  
I'm on my way  
I'm on my way  
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)  
I'm on my way  
Yeah  
I'm on my way.  
Gotta get myself to you baby, yeah  
  
I have never been to Memphis.  
But if you're there  
I have never been to Memphis.  
  
You're all crazy about Jesus  
Back where you're from,  
You get baptized in rivers  
Where the deep waters run.
