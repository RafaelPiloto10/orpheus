He's lazy, but he's lovable, we know him like a book  
Anytime he can't be found, we know just where to look:  
  
Gone fishin', there's a sign upon his door  
Gone fishin', he ain't workin' anymore  
There's his hoe out in the sun where he left a row half done  
He said "hoein' ain't no fun", he ain't got no ambition  
Gone fishin' by a shady wady pool  
I'm wishin' I could be that kinda fool  
I'd say no more work for mine on my door I'd hang a sign  
Gone fishin' Instead of just a wishin'  
  
Gone fishin'. . .see him snoozin' by a brook  
Gone fishin'. . .didn't even bait his hook  
There's his hound dog by his side fleas are bitin' at his hide  
He won't scratch 'em he's to tired he ain't got no ambition  
Gone fishin'. . .learnin' fishin' worms to swim  
I'm wishin. . .he wuz me and I wuz him  
Wish I had a plane to fly here's what I'd write in the sky  
Gone' fishin'. . .instead of jest awishin'  
  
Gone fishin'. . . he don't worry 'bout no wars  
Gone fishin'. . .left his wife to do the chores  
Cows need milkin' in the barn but he jest don't give a darn  
See his fishin' pole is gone he's on a secret mission  
Gone fishin'. . .out where peace has never died  
I'm wishin'. . .all the world was by his side  
Then our guns we'd throw away grab a fishin' pole and say
