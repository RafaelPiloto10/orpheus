You saw the wise man salomon,  
You know what 'came of him.  
To him the world seemed clear as day,  
He cursed the sad hour that he saw the sign,  
He knew that everything was dust.  
How great and wise was salomon!  
Watch out the world is spinning fast  
The night will fall, the price we'll pay  
Such wisdom's not all it's cracked up to be,  
So let us praise such clarity.  
You saw divine cleopatra,  
You know what 'came of her.  
Two emperors died to serve her lust,  
She whored herself to death, yes she did,  
And withered into lovely dust.  
How beautiful great babylon.  
Watch out, the world is spinning fast  
The night will fall, the price we'll pay,  
Such beauty's not all it's cracked up to be,  
So let us praise such luxury.  
Behold the man, the bold macheath,  
The end's in sight, I fear.  
If he had kept his pretty head  
And just robbed the rich, but oh no, instead  
All's come to nought and turned to dust.  
How sad the heart when it has won.  
Watch out the world is spinning fast,  
The night will fall, the price we'll pay.  
Such whoring's not all it's cracked up to be,  
So let us praise sweet chastity.  
I'd like to introduce my friend, my musical director and accompanist, mr. paul
trueblood. please, come on!
