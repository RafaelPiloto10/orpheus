Ooh give it to me  
I'm gettin' fired up  
Hot thunder's flowin' through my blood  
My temperature's risin', baby  
I want the warmth of your touch  
So get a grip  
I'm hot on your heels  
You're burnin' up 'cause you know just how it's gonna feel, yeah  
And you just can't help yourself now, baby  
Cause this time it's real, ow  
  
Love's a deadly weapon  
And murder's on my mind  
Time you learned a lesson  
Gonna love you this time  
  
Like sugar to a baby, yeah  
Got something you could use  
Make you an offer, baby  
You can't refuse  
  
There you stand all dressed in red  
I got this feelin' in me  
Can't get you out of my head  
One day you say you hate me  
But I found you in my bed, yeah  
  
Love's a deadly weapon  
And murder's on my mind  
I'm burnin' up with fever  
I'm gonna love you this time  
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna love this time, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Love's a deadly weapon  
And murder's on my mind  
I'm burnin' up with fever  
I wanna love you, I wanna love you, yeah  
One more time, ow
