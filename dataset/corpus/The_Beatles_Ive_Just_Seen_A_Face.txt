I've just seen a face,  
I can't forget the time or place  
Where we just met.  
She's just the girl for me  
And I want all the world to see  
We've met, mm-mm-mm-m'mm-mm  
  
Had it been another day  
I might have looked the other way  
And I'd have never been aware.  
But as it is I'll dream of her  
Tonight, di-di-di-di'n'di.  
  
Falling, yes I am falling,  
And she keeps calling  
Me back again.  
  
I have never known  
The like of this, I've been alone  
And I have missed things  
And kept out of sight  
But other girls were never quite  
Like this, di-di-di-di'n'di.  
  
Falling, yes I am falling,  
And she keeps calling  
Me back again.  
  
Yeah!  
Bup-a-lup-bup!  
  
Falling, yes I am falling,  
And she keeps calling  
Me back again.  
  
I've just seen a face,  
I can't forget the time or place  
Where we just met.  
She's just the girl for me  
And I want all the world to see  
We've met, mm-mm-mm-di-di-di.  
  
Falling, yes I am falling,  
And she keeps calling  
Me back again.  
  
Falling, yes I am falling,  
And she keeps calling  
Me back again.  
  
Oh, falling, yes I am falling,  
And she keeps calling  
Me back again.
