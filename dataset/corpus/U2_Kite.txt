Something is about to give  
I can feel it coming  
I think I know what it means  
I'm not afraid to die  
I'm not afraid to live  
And when I'm flat on my back  
I hope to feel like I did  
  
'Cause hardness, it sets in  
You need some protection  
The thinner the skin  
  
I want you to know  
That you don't need me anymore  
I want you to know  
You don't need me anyone, anything at all  
  
Who's' to say when the wind will take you  
Who's to know what it is will break you  
I don't know which way the wind will blow  
Who's to know when the time's come around  
Don't want to see you cry  
I know that this is not goodbye  
  
In summer I can taste the salt in the sea  
There's a kite blowing out of control on a breeze  
I wonder what's gonna happen to you  
You wonder what has happened to me  
  
I'm a man, I'm not a child  
A man who sees  
The shadow behind your eyes  
  
Who's' to say when the wind will take you  
Who's to know what it is will break you  
I don't know which way the wind will blow  
Who's to know when the time's come around  
Don't want to see you cry  
I know that this is not goodbye  
  
Did I waste it?  
Not so much I couldn't taste it  
Life should be fragrant  
Roof top to the basement  
The last of the rock stars  
When hip hop drives the big cars  
In the mean time when new media  
Was the big idea
