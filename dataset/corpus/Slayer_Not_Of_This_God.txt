Awake each day, to propaganda  
Complacency, conformity  
Relentless madness they regurgitate  
So save your breath, you can't coerce the strong with verbal warfare  
  
Defending, bludgeoning, to succumb to Christ or they will  
Watch you fucking burn, these apocalyptic predators must die  
Everyone til none are left alive, I'll eradicate the weak  
Within this war, cos I'm the fucking weapon, I'm not, not of this god  
  
Replicate, like a virus that infects with disease  
The beckoning pestering, don't preach to me with your blasphemy  
Exterminate, the bottom dweller on your fear they prey  
There's symmetry in anarchy, believe the lies or they will watch you  
  
Fuckin' burn, these apocalyptic predators must die  
Everyone til none are left alive, I'll eradicate the weak  
Within this war, cos I'm the fucking weapon, I'm not, not of this god  
False god, sorcerer, free thought torturer, embedded in the mind of the masses  
  
Outcast, conjurer, spineless provocateur, engulfed in narcissistic madness  
No need to feel so hollow, a promise of no sorrow, you call him the messiah  
I seek a deviant pariah  
  
Holy water empty threat, the holy cross has no effect  
I piss on any object of virtue, crucifix and rosaries  
A world of insecurities, keep waiting for your soul to be rescued  
You'll see no bright tomorrow, a promise of more sorrow  
  
You call him the messiah, I see a reckless fashion based on metal slavery  
  
You are the tainted, I am the pure, you are the sickness  
I am the cure, a toxic threat of your non sense, I feed  
I'll be the one to bring Christ to his knees, crucify then ridiculed again  
A target for all time, until the end  
  
I'll expose a total inconsistencies, and wallow in my heresy  
Cos I am the fucking weapon, attacker of their ideology  
Intoxicate with rationality, these apocalyptic predators must die  
Cos I am the fucking weapon, I'm not, not of this god
