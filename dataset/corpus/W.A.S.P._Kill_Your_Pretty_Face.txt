He come slow, the slither man  
So long crawls out of his own dead skin  
He come, he come  
  
I come here for your pain  
I come take all your pain away  
Two in me, they can't see who they are  
No, no, no  
Little voice, with big horror  
Come meet the advocate's devil  
Leave your soul at the door  
And come on inside  
  
Asylums of lost insane  
A kiss from some slowly dying face  
Two in me, they can't see who they are  
No, no, no  
  
Sex and death and the american west  
Fuck us all, farewell to flesh  
I want you, I want to, I want to kill you  
  
Want to kill your pretty face, kill your pretty face  
  
Come on give me a little piece of death  
The darkened heart inside the self  
To lives to sleep, to dies awake  
Kill your pretty, kill your pretty face  
Kill your pretty face  
  
Tear the heart out of mother  
And mother bleeds  
Cut mother open, and the wounded mother dies
