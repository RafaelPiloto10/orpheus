I'll tell you what you wanna know,  
But boy you better listen close.  
People gonna tell you lies,  
Don't let it come as a surprise.  
  
That woman's on my back again,  
I know she's got the best intentions.  
When you begin to realize,  
You know you got your daddy's eyes.  
  
And there's something that I want to say,  
I love her, too.  
And all of this has got nothing to do with you.  
  
And I'd like to stay but I can't because  
I've been fooling around and I know  
That you called because you never even knew  
That it was hurting me.  
  
When you put it on the other hand,  
  
When you're old enough to understand.  
That glove will bring it all to life,  
I didn't say that made it right.  
  
Because that woman's on my back again,  
I know she's got the best intentions.  
When you begin to realize,  
You know you got your daddy's eyes.  
  
And there's something that I want to say,  
I love her, too.  
And all of this has got nothing to do with you.  
  
And I'd like to stay but I can't because  
I've been fooling around and I know  
That you called because you never even knew  
That it was hurting me.  
  
And I'd like to stay but I can't because  
I've been fooling around and I know  
That you called because you never even knew  
That it was hurting me.  
  
And sometimes people get tired,  
And I woke up a little too late to lie.  
  
Dreams should last a long time,  
This is not what I'd call goodbye.  
  
And I'd like to stay but I can't because  
I've been fooling around and I know  
That you called because you never even knew  
That it was hurting me.  
  
And I'd love to stay but I can't because  
I've been fooling around and I know  
That you called because you never even knew  
That it was hurting me, me.  
  
I love her, too.
