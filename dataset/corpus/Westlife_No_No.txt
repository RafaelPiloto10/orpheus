Once we had it all for the taking  
Love was just me and you  
You better think twice  
About the plans that you're making  
Of splitting one word in two  
  
Put your mind in doubt  
Did you ever think about  
Everything that we're missing  
Don't you make me see  
What is best for me  
'Cause I just won't listen baby  
  
No no no no  
I don't need nobody  
Anyone to take your place but you  
No no no no  
I just couldn't fall for anyone new  
Nobody but you  
  
Girl you are the life that I'm living  
I just can't go on without you  
Let's make it alright  
Wake up to what we've been given  
Remember the things we've been through  
  
Put your mind in doubt  
Did you ever think about  
Everything that we're missing  
Don't you make me see  
What is best for me  
'Cause I just won't listen baby  
  
No no no no  
I don't need nobody  
Anyone to take your place but you  
No no no no  
I just couldn't fall for anyone new  
Nobody but you  
  
I can't imagine  
The two of us apart  
Can't find a reason  
'Cause I still believe  
There's no one like you  
That is why I need  
Nobody but  
Don't need nobody  
To take your place but you  
Don't need nobody at all  
No no no no...  
  
No no no no  
I don't need nobody  
Anyone could take your place but you  
No no no no  
I just couldn't fall for anyone new  
Nobody but you  
  
No no no no...  
I don't need nobody  
No no no no baby...  
I don't need nobody  
No no no no...  
I just couldn't fall for anyone new  
Nobody but you
