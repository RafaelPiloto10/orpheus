I'm gonna lay my troubles on a railroad track  
I'm gonna ride I ain't lookin' back  
Tried to stop but I can't unpack  
Gotta get used to the clickety-clack  
The big ol' wheels and the smokin' stack  
Ah babe I gotta go  
Babe I gotta go  
  
Loved you honey heart and soul  
I swear you're the sweetest thing I know  
I loved you true and I told you so  
I told you too come time to go  
I'll be gone with any ol' wind that blows  
Ah babe I just can't stay  
And it's bound to be that way  
  
There's lots of things I'd like to see  
From the mountains to the shining sea  
Up in the sky where the wind blows free  
To the cities down below  
Babe I just don't know  
I got trouble, trouble in my soul  
I got trouble in my soul  
  
I'm gonna lay my trouble on a railroad track  
I'm gonna ride, I ain't lookin' back  
I tried to stop but I can't unpack  
Go to sleep with the clickety-clack  
The big ol' wheels and the smokin' stack  
Babe I'm bound to go  
I got trouble in my soul  
I got trouble trouble in my soul
