There's thorns on the cactus tree  
There's thorns on the rose  
There's thorns in the heart of me  
That nobody knows  
  
They tear at the flesh until  
The tears start to rise  
They form in my heart  
But they fall from Anastasia's eyes.  
  
And I was lost in the wilderness  
Without courage or hope  
I was setting my signal fires  
And watching the smoke  
When out of the smoke appeared  
The sweetest surprise  
And I knew I'd been found  
When first I looked in  
To Anastasia's eyes.  
  
There's thorns on the cactus tree  
There's thorns on the rose  
There's thorns in the heart of me  
That nobody knows  
But finally I've found out where  
My salvation lies  
It lies in the love that lives  
In Anastasia's eyes
