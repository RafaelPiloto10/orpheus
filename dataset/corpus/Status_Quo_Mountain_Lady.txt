You're climbing mountains in the sky  
You're always looking for another high  
You're looking so far ahead you're looking away  
I'm taking you in, you're taking me on  
Your smiling face never lets you down  
Where everyone who calls you friend remembers your name  
And everyone who called you friend will never again  
  
I'm taking a walk in your heart  
I'm feeling my way through the dark  
I'm taking a walk in your heart  
I'm taking a walk in your heart  
  
I've known the mountain ladies well  
They live a never-ending fairytale  
Where walking through another heart is all in a day  
They treat me well, they treat me nice  
They think that I'm gonna pay the price  
So now I'm gonna put you straight, you're playing my game  
  
I'm taking a walk in your heart  
I'm feeling my way through the dark  
Oh, I'm taking a walk in your heart  
I'm taking a walk in your heart  
  
There's never been a better reason at any time before  
''cause everything that we've been feeling is now an open door  
And as the snow is falling the mountains start to call  
But do I feel you walking in my heart?  
  
I'm taking a walk in your heart  
I'm feeling my way through the dark  
And I'm taking a walk in your heart  
Yeah, I'm taking a walk in your heart  
I'm feeling my way through the dark  
Yeah I'm taking a walk in your heart
