Can't forget his face  
What a lonely place  
Has he really let us flow  
All the time that's lost  
What's the final cost?  
Will I really get away?  
All my life it seems  
Just a crazy dream  
Reaching for somebody's star  
Can't believe it all  
Did he really fall?  
What to do now I don't know  
  
Something's calling me back  
It's a light in the black  
Am I ready to go?  
I'm coming home  
  
Breathed the air before  
Heard the thunder roar  
Never knew it was for me  
Always looking down  
Lost but never found  
Eyes to look but not to see  
All my life it seems  
Just a crazy dream  
Reaching for somebody's star  
Like an open door  
That you've passed before  
But you never had the key  
  
Something's calling me back  
There's a light in the black  
Am I ready to go?  
I'm coming home  
I'm coming home  
Yeah  
I'm going back to my home  
  
I'm going home, home, home  
Going home, home, home  
I'm coming back  
  
Can't forget his face  
What a lonely place  
Has he really let us flow  
All the time that's lost  
What's the final cost?  
Will I really get away?  
All my life it seems, just a crazy dream  
Reaching for somebody's star  
Can't believe it all  
Did he really fall?  
What to do now I don't know  
  
Something's calling me back  
Like a light in the black  
Yes, I'm ready to go  
I'm coming home  
Home, yeah!  
I'm on my way back home  
Look to the sky  
There in the sky  
I see a star
