Man is love man is animal  
A warrior an intellectual  
He's the face of original sin  
He's the devil and the poet within  
  
Our father's have embraced the messiah  
And made the peace with Allah  
They even sought to be like Buddha  
To follow the old ways of Krishna  
  
Pretending prophets come to rule this age  
Turn the faith to fuel the wars they stage  
Well something has to change to go beyond the pain  
And somehow turn the page  
  
To whom it may concern I'm sending out a prayer  
The world finds peace in my lifetime  
To whom it may concern are you listening  
Are you there?  
I'll keep my hopes for paradise alive  
To whom it may concern  
  
We simply want to live it free  
So happy and in harmony  
No guilt, no fear, no hell to burn  
  
To whom it may concern I'm sending out a prayer  
The world finds peace in my lifetime  
To whom it may concern are you listening  
Are you there?  
I'll keep my hopes for paradise alive  
I close my eyes
