Look at me, see the love that you're missing  
Can't you see that I'll always be there  
You can't run you can't hide from the feeling tonight  
Damage done, I guess love isn't fair.  
Sometimes I wonder who you are  
So close, but we've gone too far.  
  
How long can I hold on till you say good-bye baby  
You're gone and it's so wrong and now my heart cries for you girl.  
  
Lonely days, fill my nights with such sorrow  
Shades of grey, turn into blue tomorrows.  
  
Sometimes I wonder where you are  
So close, but your eyes are so far.  
  
How long can I hold on till you say good-bye baby  
You're gone and it's so wrong and now my heart cries for you girl.  
  
How long can I hold on till you say good-bye baby  
  
You're gone and I can't go on and now my heart cries for you girl.
