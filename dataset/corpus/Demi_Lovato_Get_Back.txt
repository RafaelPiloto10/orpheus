Don't walk away like you always do  
This time  
Baby you're the only thing that's been  
On my mind  
Ever since you left I've been a mess  
(You won't answer your phone)  
I'll say it once and I'll leave you alone  
But I gotta let you know  
  
[Chorus]  
I wanna get back  
To the old days  
When the phone would ring  
And I knew it was you  
I wanna talk back  
And get yelled at  
Fight for nothing  
Like we used to  
Oh, kiss me  
Like you mean it  
Like you miss me  
Cause I know you do  
I wanna get back  
Get back  
With you  
  
Don't look at me that way  
I see it in your  
Eyes  
Don't worry about me  
I've been  
Fine  
I'm not gonna lie  
I've been a mess  
Since you left  
And every time I see you  
It gets more and more intense  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You were the only one I wanted  
And you were the first one I fell for  
You're the only one that im in need of  
And I don't want to be lonely anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Get back)  
Get back  
(Get back)  
Get back  
(Get back)  
Get back  
(Get back)  
Get back  
  
Oh, kiss me  
Like you mean it  
Like you miss me  
Cause I know that you do  
I wanna get back  
Get back  
I wanna get back  
Get back  
I wanna get back  
Get back  
Get back  
Yeah!
