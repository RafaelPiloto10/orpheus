[Disciples to Jesse] Never say die  
Never say die, no , no  
Never say die no more  
  
Never say die  
Never say die, no , no  
Never say die my boy  
  
[Judah to Jesse] Where will we go from here  
My Neon One  
Or will we wander from now on  
Is there a promised land we hear  
Of ever Neon sun  
Take us all down to you Heaven  
My pagan son  
  
Lead us a thousand years  
Red rising sun  
Stoned wilderness  
And give us love  
You blew a breath into our ears  
With your dying dove  
Are we all hellbound forever  
My heathen son  
  
[Disciples to Jesse] Never say die  
Never say die, no , no  
Never say die no more  
  
[Judah to Jesse] Never say die  
Never say die, no , no  
Never say die my boy  
But where do we go from here  
We really want to know  
It is down, down, down, down  
Or is it our Neon God
