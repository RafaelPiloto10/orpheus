A memo to a higher office  
Open letter to the powers that be  
To a God, a King, a head of state  
A captain of industry  
To the movers and the shakers  
Can't everybody see?  
  
It ought to be second nature  
I mean, the places where we live  
Let's talk about this sensibly  
We're not insensitive  
I know progress has no patience  
But something's got to give  
  
I know you're different  
You know I'm the same  
We're both too busy  
To be taking the blame  
  
I'd like some changes  
But you don't have the time  
We can't go on thinking  
It's a victimless crime  
  
No one is blameless  
But we're all without shame  
We fight the fire  
While we're feeding the flames  
  
Folks have got to make choices  
And choices got to have voices  
Folks are basically decent  
Conventional wisdom would say  
  
Well, we read about  
The exceptions  
In the papers every day  
  
It ought to be second nature  
At least, that's what I feel  
"Now I lay me down in Dreamland"  
I know perfect's not for real  
I thought we might get closer  
But I'm ready to make a deal  
  
Today is different  
And tomorrow the same  
It's hard to take the world  
The way that it came  
  
Too many rapids  
Keep us sweeping along  
Too many captains  
Keep on steering us wrong  
  
It's hard to take the heat  
It's hard to lay blame  
To fight the fire  
While we're feeding the flames
