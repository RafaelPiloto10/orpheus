What a day this has been  
What a rare mood I'm in  
Why it's almost like being in love  
  
There's a smile on my face  
For the whole human race  
Why it's almost like being in love  
  
All the music of life seems to be  
Like a bell that is ringing for me  
  
And from the way that I feel  
When that bell starts to peel  
I would swear I was falling  
Swear I was falling  
Almost like being in love  
  
What a day this has been  
What a rare mood I'm in  
Why it's almost like being in love  
  
Oh, there's a smile on my face  
For the whole human race  
Why it's almost like being in love  
  
All the music of life seems to be  
Like a bell that is ringing for me  
  
And from the way that I feel  
When the bell starts to peel  
I would swear I was falling  
Swear I was falling  
Almost like being in love, love, love, love  
Almost like being in love
