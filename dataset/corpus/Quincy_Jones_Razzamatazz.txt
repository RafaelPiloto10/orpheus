Don't believe those clouds in the sky  
'Cause they'll be moving on and the sun will shine  
If the world's been passin' you by,  
Just reach out for a star and you'll realize  
  
Got to put back all the good times that we had  
We can make it better with a little bit of razzamatazz  
  
If you feel your life's in a rut  
Just come on out tonight and we'll pull you up  
Ain't no use in draggin' your feet  
'Cause something's in the air that just can't be beat  
  
Got to put back all the good times that we had  
We can make it better with a little bit of razzamatazz  
  
Bring out the rides with all those white walled tires  
Let's go out cruisin' like we used to do  
Get suited down let's set the town on fire  
Jump out your seat and let the music pull you through  
  
We can make it better with a little bit of razzamatazz  
  
Got to put back all the good times that we had  
We can make it better with a little bit of razzamatazz  
  
Bring out the rides with all those white walled tires  
Let's go out cruisin' like we used to do  
Get suited down let's set the town on fire  
Jump out your seat and let the music pull you through  
  
You can lay your soul on the line  
'Cause we can make it work  
If we do it right  
Got to spread the message around  
The people of the world should be getting down  
  
Got to put back all the good times that we had  
  
We can make it better with a little bit of razzamatazz  
We can make it better with a little bit of razzamatazz  
We can make it better with a little bit of razzamatazz  
  
We can make it better with a little bit of razzamatazz  
We can make it better with a little bit of razzamatazz
