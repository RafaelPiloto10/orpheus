Run away to no where  
Too chicken shit to face  
I'm gonna go there  
The fear I cannot taste  
You think you got me  
You're gonna tumble down  
Keep coming for me  
I'll drop you on the ground  
  
I fuck with no one  
Until you get in my face  
  
Break you now  
Mercy, I cannot allow  
Through your face, my fist will plow  
Watching as your blood pours down  
Lets do this now  
Lets do this now  
  
You're gonna feel how  
I really am with you  
You're going no where  
Don't really know what to do  
It's going to go on  
Until you run away  
You can't control me  
You best do in my way  
  
I fuck with no one  
Until you get in my face  
  
Break you now  
Mercy, I cannot allow  
Through your face, My fist will plow  
Watching as your blood pours down  
Let's do this now  
  
Don't you know that  
You can touch me  
Don't you know that  
You can bring me down  
Oh my life would be so easy now  
If you haven't stepped across that line  
Line! Line!  
  
Break you now  
Mercy, I cannot allow  
Through your face, My fist will plow  
Watching as your blood pours down  
Let's do this now  
Let's do this now  
Let's do this now  
Let's do this now  
Let's do this now
