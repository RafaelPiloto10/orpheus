So this is love..  
  
First I give you all my love and now whats up  
So i'll tell you what it feels like this time  
I put my whole life and soul on the rocks  
Trying to get jealous is just another bad experience  
Fuck, I wish a girl could love me too for once  
You say "hey, you want to try something different"  
Now I see your feels weren't always just for one man  
Ya got my heart now tell me what ya plan do with it  
Ya say you never loved me like that, now you full of shit  
So this is loooooove!!!!!! (x8)  
Well I feel fascist when I say bitch  
But I thought that bitch was liking it when she sucked my dick  
I didn't see that this was not any good for me  
Fuck you, just open your eyes and see  
I want to tell you so bad but I can't find my lips  
Every time I give you my heart I can feel it rip  
You got my heart tell me what ya plan do with it  
You say you never loved me like that now you full of shit  
So this is loooooove!!!!!! (x8)  
  
For love, but not be loved  
For the push, and I've been shoved  
For the truth, and that's a belief  
For the gift, I will never recieve (x3)  
  
So this is loooooove!!!!!! (x8)
