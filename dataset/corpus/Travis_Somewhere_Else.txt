Home and away  
Life goes on the same  
We bury the pain  
And hold on to love  
Hear the song  
Sing along  
  
But what does it change this life is so confusing  
Feel like I'm always losing  
  
We come in  
Knowing everything  
But don't say a word  
Till they teach it away  
Words are found  
Too close to the edge that we don't dare say  
  
And this will turn into something else  
Something else  
And when it does I'll be somewhere else  
Somewhere else  
Where else?  
  
And you say I should be myself  
Despite all the wrong (dragging you back)  
Forgive and then forget and on and on and on and on  
  
This life is so confusing feels like I'm always losing  
And this will turn into something else  
Something else  
And when it does I'll be somewhere else  
Somewhere else  
Where else?
