Watchin' the long places ridin' this run down track  
And the lost places from a dream that never brings them back  
And sad truth is nothing but a cold hard fact  
I'm ridin' the blue train over the miles yet to cover a ghost in a hurry to
fade  
I'm taking it one way to nowhere afraid you might be there  
To find me inside this blue train  
  
Countin' the burned bridges trailing this rusted wreck  
As our back pages scatter in the dust we left  
Like a pearl necklace falling from around my neck  
I'm ridin' the blue train...  
Away down the low road a ticket to an empty room a rendezvous unknown  
[ guitar ]  
I'm ridin' the blue train...  
I'm ridin' the blue train...
