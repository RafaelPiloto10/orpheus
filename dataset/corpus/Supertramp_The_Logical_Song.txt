When I was young, it seemed that life was so wonderful,  
A miracle, oh it was beautiful, magical.  
And all the birds in the trees, well they'd be singing so happily,  
Joyfully, playfully watching me.  
But then they send me away to teach me how to be sensible,  
Logical, responsible, practical.  
And they showed me a world where I could be so dependable,  
Clinical, intellectual, cynical.  
  
There are times when all the world's asleep,  
The questions run too deep  
For such a simple man.  
Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned  
I know it sounds absurd  
But please tell me who I am.  
  
Now watch what you say or they'll be calling you a radical,  
Liberal, fanatical, criminal.  
Won't you sign up your name, we'd like to feel you're  
Acceptable, respectable, presentable, a vegetable!  
  
At night, when all the world's asleep,  
The questions run so deep  
For such a simple man.  
Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned  
I know it sounds absurd  
But please tell me who I am.
