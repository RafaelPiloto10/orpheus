You could shoot off a cannon  
Down the middle of bond  
And attract no attention in downtown st. John's  
This getting nowhere is getting to me  
Wondering where can you go  
To be all you can be  
  
No regular joe wants to pull up and go  
And wind up homesick  
Where there's no one you know  
Just a smoke and a beer  
And the sports on tv  
Being sorry you left  
With no choice but to leave  
  
[Chorus:]  
No change in the weather  
No change in me  
I don't want to leave  
But I can't live for free  
Can't eat the air, can't drink the sea  
No change in the weather  
No change in me  
  
You could shoot off a cannon  
From the top of long's hill  
And a gulliver's taxi might be all that you'd kill  
We were promised the sun  
And the moon and the stars  
We got weathered old clapboard and salt-rusted cars  
  
So I'll join in the leaving like all of the rest  
Montreal, calgary, vancouver west  
Lay down on the sidewalk  
Kick off and die  
And watch people not looking  
As they hurry by  
  
[Chorus:]
