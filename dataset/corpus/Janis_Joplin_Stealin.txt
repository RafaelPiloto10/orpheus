Well, put your arms around me like the circles in the sun  
I want you to love me daddy like my easy rider done.  
If you don't believe that I love you, look what a fool I've been,  
If you don't think I'm sinking, look what a hole I'm in.  
I'm stealin', stealin', pretty mama don't you tell on me,  
I'm stealin' back my same old used-to-be.  
Well, I got a little woman, 'bout my height and size,  
Now she's a married woman, sees me once in a while.  
If you don't believe I love you, look what a fool I've been  
If you don't think I'm sinking, look what a hole I'm in.  
Stealin', stealin', pretty mama don't you tell on me,  
I'm stealin' back my same old used-to-be.  
With good whiskey you stay drunk all the time,  
Stay drunk baby 'cause it eases my mind.  
If you don't believe that I love you, look what a fool I've been,  
If you don't think I'm sinking, look what a hole I'm in.  
I'm stealin', stealin', pretty mama don't you tell on me  
I'm stealin' right back my same old used-to-be
