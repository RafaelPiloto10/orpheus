I'm lost, I'm a ghost  
Dispossessed, taken host  
My hunger burns a bullet hole  
A spectre of my mortal soul  
These rumors and suspicion  
Anger is a poison  
The only truth that I could see  
Is when you put your lips to me  
Futures tricked by the past  
Spectre, how he laughs  
  
Fear puts a spell on us  
Always second-guessing love  
My hunger burns a bullet hole  
A spectre of my mortal soul  
The only truth that I can see  
Spectre has come for me
