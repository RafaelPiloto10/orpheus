Watch them all fall down  
Watch them all fall down  
  
I used to rule the world  
Seas would rise when I gave the word  
Now in the morning I sleep alone  
Sweep the streets I used to own  
  
I used to roll the dice  
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes  
Listen as the crowd would sing  
"Now the old king is dead, long live the king"  
  
One minute I held the key  
Next the walls were closed on me  
Now I discovered that my castles stand  
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand  
  
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'  
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'  
Be my mirror, my sword and shield  
My missionaries in a foreign field  
For some reason I can't explain  
I know St. Peter won't call my name  
Never an honest word  
  
And that was when I ruled the world  
  
It was a wicked and wild wind  
Blew the doors to let me in  
Shattered windows and the sound of drums  
People couldn't believe what I'd become  
  
Revolutionaries wait  
For my head on a silver plate  
Just a puppet on a lonely string  
Oh, who would ever want to be king?  
  
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'  
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'  
Be my mirror, my sword and shield  
My missionaries in a foreign field  
For some reason I can't explain  
I know St. Peter won't call my name  
Never an honest word  
But that was when I ruled the world  
  
Watch them all fall down  
Watch them all fall down  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...
