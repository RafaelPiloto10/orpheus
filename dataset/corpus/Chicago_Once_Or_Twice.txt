Oh girl  
I looked you over once or twice  
I think that you are very nice  
And you're just meant for me  
Oh girl  
I think you got a messed up mind  
But if you will take the time  
Baby I can set you free  
Well I'm not trying to be  
What I am not  
But I think what you need  
Is what I got  
Girl I'm no philosopher  
But I can offer you that cure  
To mend your broken heart  
I know that you are not blind  
I know you see my messed up mind  
I bet you see my broken heart too  
So won't you  
Bring your heart and your mind  
That's out on the run  
Fuse them with my broken heart  
In my mind  
We'll be one  
Girl I looked you over once or twice  
I think that you are very nice  
And you're just meant for me  
Girl I think you got a messed up mind  
Now that you know yours is just like mine  
Baby, won't you set me free
