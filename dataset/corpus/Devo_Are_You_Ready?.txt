Are you ready?  
  
Action boy now  
Action girl now  
Be prepared to climb another mountain  
Are you ready?  
  
Action boy now  
Action girl now  
Be prepared to swim across the ocean  
Are you ready?  
  
Be prepared  
To fill you plate  
Be prepared  
Don't hesitate  
Be prepared  
For a great big bust  
Be prepared  
To do what you must  
Be prepared  
To take a hit  
Be prepared  
To go for it  
Be prepared  
For a sneak attack  
Be prepared  
Just don't look back  
  
They say, where there's a will there's a way  
We've heard, these are the things that they say  
So....  
  
Reach out for that big fat star  
Stick to the groove  
And go real far  
Outrun the ones who steal the Abar (??)  
  
Are you ready?  
  
Action boy now  
Action girl now  
Be prepared to blast into the future  
Action boy now  
Action girl now  
Be prepared to rearrange the picture  
  
Are you ready?
