Nothing touches me, man  
These walls are three feet thick  
Wouldn't take one of them  
Little drills to get through it  
  
I try to make her listen  
When I turn away she's split  
I try to make her listen  
When I turn away she's split  
She went  
  
Nothing touches me  
Nothing touches me now  
Nothing touches me, man  
No matter how you split  
  
Sticks and stones can get through bones  
So I've given up looking out of it  
  
I try to make her listen  
When I turn away she's split  
I try to make her listen  
When I turn away she's split  
She went  
  
Nothing touches me now  
Nothing touches me now  
Nothing touches me now  
Nothing touches me now  
  
Laugh if you can, if you can, if you can, at me now  
Laugh if you can, if you can, if you can, at me now  
Laugh if you can, if you can, if you can, at me now  
Laugh if you can, if you can, if you can, at me now
