A sad mistake  
A strange coincidence  
Two fields were crossed  
I lost my innocence  
Stood staring straight into the sun  
  
An orange flame  
To break the black of night  
He calls my name  
But doesn' t say it right  
I stay in place  
When I should run  
  
Carefully, carefully now  
Don' t let it fall and break  
Hold it tight, with both hands  
For sadness sake  
  
I know you' re there  
But I can' t see too well  
I touch your hair  
Inhale your earthy smell  
I try to feel  
Beyond the glass  
  
Carefully, carefully now  
Don' t let it fall and break  
Hold it tight, with both hands  
For sadness sake  
  
A sad mistake  
But I' m recovering  
The birds of prey  
No longer hovering..  
  
Carefully, carefully now...
