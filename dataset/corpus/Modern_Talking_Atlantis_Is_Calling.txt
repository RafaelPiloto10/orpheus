Lady, I know it was hard  
But it's much harder to ignore  
There's a chance and I'll promise  
I won't hurt you anymore  
Hollywood nights we're romancin'  
You can trust me anytime  
Somewhere, oh babe - there is someone  
Oh you're dancing in my mind  
  
Ohoho, little queenie  
I'm your fool  
Come on, teach me the rules  
And I will send an S.O.S. for love  
Ohoho, little queenie,  
I'm your fool  
You need love, like I do  
And I will send a S.O.S. for love  
  
Atlantis is calling, S.O.S. for love  
Atlantis is calling, from the stars above  
Atlantis is calling, S.O.S. for love  
Atlantis is calling, it's too hot to stop  
  
If loving you is wrong, babe  
Oh, I don't want to be right  
I've got you under my skin, babe  
And baby, hold me tight  
I'm ready for our romance  
I wait a million years for you  
I love you more than I'm saying  
Baby, that's for me the truth
