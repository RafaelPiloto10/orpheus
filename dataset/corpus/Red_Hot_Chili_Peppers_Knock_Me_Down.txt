Never too soon to be through  
Being cool too much too soon  
Too much for me too much for you  
You're gonna loose in time  
Every turn looking to burn  
Some never learn live and learn  
Stop your searching for a curse  
Before you end up in a hearse  
Don't be afraid to show your friends  
That you hurt inside inside  
Pain's part of life don't hide behind your false pride  
It's a lie your lie  
Don't slip away and don't forget  
I'll give you more than you can get  
It's so lonely when you don't even know  
Yourself come to me  
If you see me getting mighty  
If you see me getting high  
Knock me down  
I'm not bigger than life  
I'm tired of being untouchable  
I'm not above the love  
I'm part of you and you're part of me  
Why did you go away  
Too late to tell you how I feel  
I want you back but I get real  
Can you hear my falling tears  
Making rain where you lay  
Finding what you're looking for  
Can end up being such a bore  
I pray for you most every day  
My love's with you now fly away  
If you see me getting mighty  
If you see me getting high  
Knock me down  
I'm not bigger than life  
It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself
