Now you say you're lonely  
You cried the long night through  
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river  
I've cried a river over you  
  
Now you say you're sorry  
For being so untrue  
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river  
I've cried a river over you  
  
You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head  
While you never shed a tear  
Remember, I remember all that you said  
  
Told me love was to plebeian  
Told me you were through with me  
And now you say you love me  
  
Well, just to prove you do  
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river  
I've cried a river over you  
  
Well, you told me love was to plebeian  
Told me you were through with me  
And now you say you love me  
  
Well, just to prove that you do  
Come on and cry me a river, I wanna see a river  
'Cause I've cried a river over you  
  
I've cried a river over you, I've cried a river over you  
I've cried a river over you, I've cried a river over you  
I've cried a river over you, I've cried a river over you
