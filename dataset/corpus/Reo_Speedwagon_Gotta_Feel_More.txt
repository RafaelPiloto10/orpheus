I've never seen the sea seem so calm.  
I've never felt the breeze slippin' through the trees.  
But now I've got you and it's takin so long.  
I want to see more.  
I gotta feel more.  
  
I never felt young 'til I met you.  
Never felt fear 'til I thought about losin' you.  
Only a fool would think that it's all true.  
I want to see more.  
I gotta feel more.  
  
I gotta feel more, more, more  
Than I've ever felt before.  
There are deeper places to explore.  
I've seen the world through an eagle's eye.  
I've felt the ocean's roar.  
I still love you to the core,  
I just gotta feel more.  
  
I never did believe that mountains could move.  
Never did believe that the Yankees could lose.  
I never thought love could come my way.  
I want to see more.  
I gotta feel more.  
  
I never felt young 'til I met you.  
Never felt fear 'til I thought about losin' you.  
Only a fool would think that it's all true.  
I want to see more.  
I gotta feel more.  
  
I gotta feel more, more, more  
Than I've ever felt before.  
There are deeper places to explore.  
I've seen the world through an eagle's eye.  
I've felt the ocean's roar.  
I still love you to the core,  
I just gotta feel more.
