Well, you hoot and you holler and you make me mad  
And I've always been under your heel  
Holy christ what a lousy deal  
Now I'm sick and tired of your tedious ways  
And I ain't gonna take it no more  
Oh no no - walkin' out that door  
  
Burning my bridges, cutting my tie  
Once again I wanna look into the eye  
Being myself  
Counting my pride  
No un-right neighbour's gonna take me for a ride  
Burning my bridges  
Moving at last  
Girl I'm leaving and I'm burying the past  
Gonna have peace now  
You can be free  
No one here will make a sucker out of me
