A little girl's dream world with ribbons and long curls  
Reflections of yesterday's past  
Now headlines and foot lights  
The hours of long nights keep everything  
Moving so fast  
  
It's taken a long time  
And she's walked a thin line  
The fame and fortune arrived  
  
She kept on striving  
Way of surviving  
Till part of those dreams came alive  
  
[Chorus]  
And she wishes she looks like  
They tell her she looks like all the time  
What she'd give just to feel like  
She tells them she's feeling  
Just fine  
All that money she makes every night  
Ain't as much as it seems  
A dollar a wrinkle and less then a nickel a dream  
  
Her heart may be breaking  
But she keeps on taking  
What she thought she wanted way back when  
It's too late to change her  
There's always a stranger  
To tell her she's someone again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nickel a dream  
Nickel dreams
