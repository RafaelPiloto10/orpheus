Counting sheep  
When you're trying to sleep,  
Being fair  
When there's something to share,  
Being neat  
When you're folding a sheet,  
That's mathematics!  
  
When a ball  
Bounces off of a wall,  
When you cook  
From a recipe book,  
When you know  
How much money you owe,  
That's mathematics!  
  
How much gold can you hold in an elephant's ear?  
When it's noon on the moon, then what time is it here?  
If you could count for a year, would you get to infinity,  
Or somewhere in that vicinity?  
  
When you choose  
How much postage to use,  
When you know  
What's the chance it will snow,  
When you bet  
And you end up in debt,  
Oh try as you may,  
You just can't get away  
From mathematics!  
  
Andrew Wiles gently smiles,  
Does his thing, and voila!  
Q.E.D., we agree,  
And we all shout hurrah!  
As he confirms what Fermat  
Jotted down in that margin,  
Which could've used some enlargin'.  
  
Tap your feet,  
Keepin' time to a beat,  
Of a song  
While you're singing along,  
Harmonize  
With the rest of the guys,  
Yes, try as you may,  
You just can't get away  
From mathematics!
