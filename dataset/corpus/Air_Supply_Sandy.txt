Sandy, the fireworkds are hailin' over little Eden tonight  
Forcin' a light into all those stoney faces left stranded  
On this warm July  
  
And the boys from the casino dance with shirts open  
Like Latin lovers on the shore  
Chasin' all them silly New York virgins by the score  
  
Sandy, the aurora is risin' behind us  
Those pier lights, our carnival life forever  
Oh love me tonight, for I may never see you again  
Hey Sandy girl, my, my, my baby.  
  
Sandy, the waitress I was seein' lost her desire for me  
I spoke with her last night, she said she won't set herself  
On fire for me, anymore  
Did you hear the cops finally busted Madame Marie  
For telling fortunes better than they do  
For me this boardwalk life is through  
You outta quit this scene, too  
  
Sandy, the aurora is risin' behind us  
Those pier lights, our carnival life forever  
Oh love me tonight, for I may never see you again  
Hey Sandy girl, my, my, my baby.  
  
Oh I mean it Sandy girl  
Oh, my, my, my baby,  
Oh I love you Sandy girl,  
My, my, my baby...
