I crashed a  
Learned to keep my eye on you  
You always say you'll lead the way, but then you never do  
I slow a swerve but lost my nerve and quickly looked away  
When I looked back, the day was black  
Then I heard you say  
Why is the sun high, and why does it rain  
Why is there danger and why is there pain  
Why can't the burden be carried away  
And why isn't it Friday today  
  
Your lack of trust is hardly just  
So do as you've been told  
Please follow me into the sea  
Don't worry if its cold  
I knew right then my chance again  
Had quickly slipped away  
I crashed, I cried, I burned my eyes  
Ill follow anyway  
  
Why is the sea cold, why is it blue  
Why do I stay here, why is it you  
Notice the danger, don't help it anyway  
Why isn't it Friday today  
  
I knew right then my chance again  
Would quickly slip away  
I crash, I cry, I burn my eyes  
I still follow anyway
