I wanted love so very bad that  
I could almost tasted it  
And so I gave mine all to you  
And hoped you would not wast it  
I laid awake the whole night long  
And wondered was I wrong  
But when you woke and touched my face  
I knew that I belonged  
  
Belonging to someone I find is very necessary  
The load is lighter on your mind  
When someone helps to carry  
And even though I'm strong enough  
To make it on my own  
I would not even care to try  
To live my life alone  
  
For if I lived my life alone  
With no one to belong to  
There'd be no one to pledge my heart  
Or sing my song of love to  
My melodies would soon dry up  
And the words would leave me too  
It all would come to pass if I  
Could not belong to you  
  
I wanted love so very bad that  
I could almost taste it  
And when I gave mine all to you  
I knew you would not wast it
