Come on so tough  
When you think you got a right  
Make love so rough  
Until I lose the will to fight  
You got that somethin', baby  
That turned my darkness in the light  
And I can't get enough of your love  
I never found a man  
Who took the time to see  
The woman that I am  
And not the one he hoped I'd be  
And I think we're onto somethin'  
And it's good enough for me  
I just can't get enough of your  
Come on so tough  
Baby, you know just how to please  
You got that stuff  
Brings this woman to her knees  
I think we're onto somethin'  
That is good enough for me  
I just can't get enough of your  
I just can't get enough of your  
And I just can't get enough of your love  
Can't get enough of your love  
Can't get enough of your love  
Just can't get it  
Can't get enough of your love  
Just can't get it  
Can't get enough of your love  
Can't get enough of your love  
Well, I can't get enough of your love
