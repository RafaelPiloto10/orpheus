There's still a little bit of your taste in my mouth  
There's still a little bit of you laced with my doubt  
It's still a little hard to say what's going on  
  
There's still a little bit of your ghost, your witness  
There's still a little bit of your face I haven't kissed  
You step a little closer each day  
That I can't say what's going on  
  
Stones taught me to fly  
Love taught me to lie  
Life taught me to die  
So it's not hard to fall  
When you've flown like a cannonball  
  
There's still a little bit of your song in my ear  
There's still a little bit of your words I long to hear  
You step a little closer to me  
So close, I can't see what's going on  
  
Stones taught me to fly  
Love taught me to lie  
So come on courage, teach me to be shy  
Cause its not hard to fall  
When you know that you just dont know  
  
Stones taught me to fly  
Love taught me to lie  
So come on courage, teach me to be shy  
Cause its not hard to fall  
When you've flown like a cannonball  
  
Stones taught me to fly  
Love taught me to cry  
So come on courage, teach me to be shy  
Cause its not hard to fall  
And I don't wanna scare him  
  
Its not hard to fall  
And I don't want to lose  
Its not hard to fall  
When you've flown like a cannonball.
