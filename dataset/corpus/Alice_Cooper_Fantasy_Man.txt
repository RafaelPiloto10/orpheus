I don't drink tea or white chablis  
I sit around and watch tv  
Don't send flowers or take showers  
But I'll be there to pull your weeds  
  
Oh yeah  
  
I don't read books, I don't french cook  
Or stroll around in galleries  
I hate opera, I hate Oprah  
Don't fill my head with poetry  
  
You just want to squeeze my masculinity  
Why can't you leave it alone  
  
Hey, hey I ain't gonna change  
Hey, hey don't you love it this way  
Hey, hey I am what I am  
So please understand, I'm not you fantasy man  
  
I don't do dishes and I'm suspicious  
Of any grown-up man who does  
I'm homophobic, don't do aerobics  
Just lay around and catch a buzz  
  
You just want to squeeze my masculinity  
Why can't you leave it alone  
  
Hey, hey I ain't gonna change  
Hey, hey don't you love it this way  
Hey, hey I am what I am  
So please understand  
I'm not you fantasy man  
Hey, hey I ain't gonna change  
Hey, hey don't you love me this way  
Hey, hey I am what I am  
So please understand  
I'm not your fantasy man  
Hey  
Hey hey  
Hey  
Hey hey  
  
You just want to squeeze my masculinity  
Why can't you leave it alone  
  
Hey, hey I ain't gonna change  
Hey, hey don't you love me this way  
Hey, hey I am what I am  
So please understand  
I'm not you fantasy man  
  
Hey, hey I ain't gonna change  
Hey, hey don't you love me this way  
Hey, hey I am what I am  
So please understand  
I'm not you fantasy man
