If I were you  
I'd think it over  
Take your time  
Before you leave  
Everyone wants the perfect lover  
  
If I were you  
I'd fall in love with me  
If I were you  
I'd just remember  
Don't miss the forest for the trees  
  
The mighty flame  
Was once an ember  
If I were you I'd fall in love with me  
  
If I were you  
I'd whisper sweet I love you's everyday  
If I were you, I'd never ever let me get away  
  
If I were you  
I'd look me over  
There's much more than what you see  
I can prove You'll need no other  
If I were you I'd fall in love with me
