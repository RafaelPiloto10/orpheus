I got a girl that ain't got no home  
She ain't very fat just skin and bones  
She don't cast no shadow because she's so thin  
Never knows where she going but she knows were she's been  
She Never knows where she going but she knows were she's been  
  
The girl I love ain't got no name  
But I love her just the same  
She's a little peculiar but it ain't no sin  
She never know where she going but know were she's been  
She never knows where she going but she knows were she's been  
Never know where she going but she knows were she's been  
  
She's six feet tall and got long black hair  
Runs around in her sack dress but I don't care  
She got great big feet with size number 10  
She never know where she going but know were she's been  
She never know where she going but know were she's been  
  
The girl I love ain't got no name  
But I love her just the same  
She's a little peculiar but it ain't no sin  
She never know where she going but know were she's been  
She never knows where she going but she knows were she's been  
She never know where she going but know were she's been  
She never knows where she going but she knows were she's been  
She never know where she going but know were she's been  
She never knows where she going but she knows were she's been  
She never know where she going  
She never knows where she going  
She never know where she going  
She never knows where she going  
She never know where she going now  
But she know were she's been ugh  
She never know where she going  
Never know where she going  
But I know were she's been.
