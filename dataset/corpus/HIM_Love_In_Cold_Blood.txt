Serpentine love's thighs wrap around me in search for death  
Drenched in blood the adored and beloved will give in to'  
  
Love in cold blood  
Breathe me in sweet suffering  
Love in cold blood  
Put me out of my misery  
  
Love's feline eyes in darkness shine on her web  
Demonized with divine insight we draw our last breath  
  
Darling take me home  
To the castle made of skulls and bones  
Sing me a song to remind me where I belong  
In your arms, my love, in cold blood
