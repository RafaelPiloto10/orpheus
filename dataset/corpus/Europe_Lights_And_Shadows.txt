One night she came, in from the cold  
Like a long lost friend, someone to hold  
She said, don't ask me now  
Cause what's in a name  
But when I'm gone you'll never be the same  
  
So won't you hold me now  
Can't you see what I came here for  
Save me now, cause I now  
We'll keep on headin' through  
Lights and shadows  
We're talkin' lights and shadows  
  
She came from far, with so much to tell  
Cause when you're lookin' for love  
You can walk through hell  
Just like a ricochet, she might come and go  
And one look can say more than you'll ever know  
  
So won't you hold me now...  
  
Oh lights and shadows  
We're talkin' lights and shadows  
  
So won't you hold me now...  
  
Oh lights and shadows...  
  
We keep on headin' through  
Lights and shadows
