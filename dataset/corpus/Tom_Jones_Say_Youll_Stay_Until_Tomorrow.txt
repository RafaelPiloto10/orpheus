[Chorus]  
Say you'll stay until tomorrow  
I can't face tonight alone  
Though I know it's over and we're through  
Say you'll stay until tomorrow  
  
I need you  
The words have all been said  
Your mind's made up to go  
You're standing by the bed  
Like someone I don't know  
  
Your love has died and there is nothing you can do  
Though you try (though you try)  
Yes, you try (yes, you try)  
You can't live (you can't live)  
With a lie, so  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've known for some time now  
That thing's just ain't been right  
'Cause when we try to talk  
We both get so uptight  
  
But now you've told the truth  
And I know where I stand  
Though it hurts (though it hurts)  
Deep inside (deep inside)  
Give me time (give me time)  
I'll get by, so  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Though I know it's over and we're through  
Say you'll stay until tomorrow  
I need you
