Well I think it's time to get ready  
To realize just what I found  
I have lived unaware of what I am  
It's all clear to me now, that  
  
My heart is on fire  
My soul's like a wheel that's turning  
My love is alive, my love is alive  
  
Well there's something inside  
That's makin' me crazy  
Tryin' to keep it together  
Cause what I'm saying, I have been saving  
And now could be forever  
  
My love is alive, my heart's on fire  
Soul is like a wheel, like a hot wire  
My love is alive, my heart's on fire  
Soul's like a wheel, like a hot wire  
  
There's a mirror inside my mind  
Reflectin' the light that shines on me  
Hold on to the feeling  
Let it be, let it grow  
My heart is on fire, my love is alive  
  
Fire in my heart, soul's like a wheel that's turning  
My love is alive
