Thought I'd take the slide  
I thought I'd be alright  
But when the details swam  
Oh no, the door got jammed  
Someone took the hand  
And we were out slow dancing  
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh  
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh  
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh  
In the blue light, blue light  
Blue light, blue light  
There was a crowd below  
Swanning in the glow  
All the paste it shimmered  
In the swimmer's glimmer  
It was a sticky summer  
And I was diving under...  
The Blue light, blue light, uh-huh  
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh  
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh  
In the blue light, blue light  
Blue light, blue light  
Well nothing drove out behind me  
I was so glad  
Even the walls were turning round  
Well, someone said  
There was something wrong  
But I couldn't quite  
Put my finger on it  
What the...  
Well I thought I heard...  
And I tried to...  
Then we were just diving  
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh  
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh  
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh  
In the blue light, blue light  
Blue light, blue light
