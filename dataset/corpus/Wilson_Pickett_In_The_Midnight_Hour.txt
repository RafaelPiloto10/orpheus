I'm gonna wait 'till the midnight hour  
That's when my love comes tumbling down  
I'm gonna wait 'till the midnight hour  
When there' no one else around  
I'm gonna take you girl and hold you  
Do all things I told you in the midnight hour  
  
I'm gonna wait till the stars come out  
See them twinkle in your eyes  
I'm gonna wait 'till the midnight hour  
That's when my love begins to shine  
  
You're the only girl I know  
Really love you so in the midnight hour
