An old cowboy went ridin out one dark and windy day  
upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way  
when all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw  
plowin through the ragid skies and up a cloudy draw  
  
Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel  
their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel  
a bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky  
for he saw the riders comin hard and he heard their mournful cries  
  
chorus:  
yippie i ohhh ohh ohh  
yippie i aye ye ye  
ghost riders in the sky  
  
Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred  
their shirts all soaked with sweat  
he's ridin hard to catch that herd  
but he ain't caught em yet  
cause they got to ride forever in that range up in the sky  
on horses snortin fire as they ride on hear their cries  
  
As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name  
''if you want to save your soul from hell a-ridin on our range  
then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride  
tryin to catch the devil's herd across these endless skies  
  
yippie i ohhh oh oh  
yippie i aye ye ye  
ghost riders in the sky  
ghost riders in the sky  
ghost riders in the sky
