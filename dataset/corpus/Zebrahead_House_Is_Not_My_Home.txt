Well I'm tired, so tired of getting up and wasting another day  
I wish the picture on the wall would still say it all  
But now yesterday is so far away  
And I would give anything, say anything  
  
To keep it all like it was  
But you just throw it all away  
And I think this house is not my home  
I think that I'd rather be alone tonight  
I'm trying, trying to fake it  
  
I'm tired, so tired, of giving up and taking all the blame  
I wish the shouting and the fights would stop for the night  
Can't close my eyes and make them all go away  
And I would give anything, say anything  
To keep it all like it was  
But you just throw it all away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This is the part where you say  
You can't stay together just for me  
This is the part where you make me choose  
On whose side I want to be  
This is the part where you decide  
What's going to be best for me  
This is the start  
Now we grow apart  
Now we grow apart  
  
[Chorus]
