Yeah, come on, Love my girl  
She lookin' good, come on, One more  
Five to one, baby  
One in five  
  
No one here gets out alive, now  
You get yours, baby  
I'll get mine  
Gonna make it, baby  
  
If we try  
The old get old  
And the young get stronger  
May take a week  
  
And it may take longer  
They got the guns  
But we got the numbers  
Gonna win, yeah  
  
We're takin' over  
Come on!  
Yeah!  
Your ballroom days are over, baby  
  
Night is drawing near  
Shadows of the evening crawl across the years  
Ya walk across the floor with a flower in your hand  
Trying to tell me no one understands  
  
Trade in your hours for a handful dimes  
Gonna' make it, baby, in our prime  
Come together one more time  
Get together one more time  
  
Get together one more time  
Get together, aha  
Get together one more time!  
Get together one more time!  
  
Get together one more time  
Get together one more time  
Get together, gotta, get together  
Ohh!  
  
Hey, come on, honey  
You won't have along wait for me, baby  
I'll be there in just a little while  
You see, I gotta go out in this car with these people and...  
  
Get together one more time
