If there was no tomorrow  
Then tonight would never end  
If we could freeze  
The hands of time  
I would stay here in your arms  
And not go back again  
  
Cause all I want  
Is for you to hold me now  
And we can make it  
Through this night together  
All I need  
Is for you to show me how  
Cause nothing can stop this  
Feeling of forever  
  
I've never felt this close to love  
Lyin' here face to face  
Far beneath the silver skies  
There's no one around  
To chase this night away  
  
Cause all I want  
Is for you to hold me now  
And we can make it  
Through this night together  
All I need  
Is for you to show me how  
Cause nothing can stop this  
Feeling of forever  
  
The world is ours tonight  
As long as we just believe  
The feelings that we hold inside  
Are in every heart that beats  
  
Cause all I want  
Is for you to hold me now  
And we can make it  
Through this night together  
All I need  
Is for you to show me how  
Cause nothing can stop this  
Feeling of forever
