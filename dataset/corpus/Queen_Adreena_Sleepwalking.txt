(K. J. Garside C. Gray)  
Trippy little Popsicle cod,  
Did I get it quite right?  
Broken got broke,  
Was it good to smoke?  
I am not sure,  
Was it good to sing?  
Was it right to love?  
Was it wrong this turning that I took?  
Does the song sound right?  
Do I look alright?  
I spent all night getting it right.  
So you would love me more,  
So you would love me more.  
Pray for your indecision girl,  
Run from your indecision girl,  
Hide from your indecision girl.  
Somnambulation up and down the road,  
I lay in the garden with the cats,  
Oh my how the grass did grow,  
I watch the clock till the day did stop.  
I pray for my lovers return,  
I spent all night getting it right.  
So you would love me more,  
So you would love me more.  
Pray for your indecision girl,  
Burn for your indecision girl,  
Blind from your indecision girl.
