Where the air's not clean  
Where the water's glowing green  
Where the dogs are mean  
  
I'm Moving to Bohemia  
Taking you along  
Say goodbye to suburbia  
You don't have to cut the lawn  
  
I had a dream of a different place  
I had a dream that you had a different face  
I heard a scream of a desperate kind  
I've got a feeling that you're going love what  
You'll find  
  
Where we're on T.V.  
Where the money grows on trees  
Where the beer is free  
  
Moving to Bohemia  
Taking you along  
Say goodbye to Utopia  
We'll wave before we're gone  
  
I had a dream of a different place  
I had a dream that you had a different face  
I hear the beat of an anxious heart  
I feel the heat... it's time for us to start  
Time for us to start  
  
I'm moving to Bohemia  
Where the literature's obscene  
Bathing in Euphoria  
Where the naked truth is on the screen  
  
I had a dream of a different place  
I had a dream that you had a different face  
I heard a scream of a desperate kind  
I've got a feeling that...  
You're going love what you'll find  
  
You're going love what you'll find
