Look out your window  
That grass aint green  
Its kinda yellow  
See what I mean?  
Look up your chimney  
The sky aint blue  
Its kinda yellow  
You know its true  
(its so hard to figure what its all about)  
  
When your outsides in (inside out)  
And your downsides up (upside down)  
Yeah, your upsides right (rightside up)  
Yeah, dont it make you wanna twist and shout  
When youre inside out  
  
Look down your drain pipe  
What color do you see?  
Its got to be yellow  
Dont try to fool me  
(and dont it make you wanna twist and shout)  
  
When your outsides in (inside out)  
And your downsides up (upside down)  
Yeah, your upsides right (rightside up)  
Yeah, dont it make you wanna twist and shout  
When youre inside out  
  
Be careful where youre walking  
You might step in something rough  
Be careful where youre talking  
And saying all that stuff  
Take care when you are breathing  
Somethings funny in the air  
And somethings Im not saying  
bout whats happening out there  
Its inside out  
  
Look into the future  
With your mystic crystal ball  
See if it aint yellow  
See if its there at all  
(aint no shadow or a doubt)  
(dont it make you wanna twist and shout)  
  
When your outsides in (inside out)  
And your downsides up (upside down)  
Yeah, your upsides right (rightside up)  
Yeah, dont it make you wanna twist and shout  
When youre inside out  
(inside out)  
(right side up)  
Yeah, dont it make you wanna twist and shout  
When youre inside out  
Inside out  
Inside out
