Hurling down with thunder from on high  
An ancient evil steals across the sky  
Flaming power, death is in his wake  
The lord of Hell returns to rend and rape  
  
Watch the lights as they devour you  
A blazing presence rips you through and through  
Blinded by such beauty caught so unaware  
You're stripped and burning in his fiery stare  
  
Howling furies, shrieking backwards lies  
Phantom armies summoned by their cries  
Nothing equals this astounding sight  
Of the beast unveiled in this unholy light  
  
Watch the lights as they devour you  
A blazing presence rips you through and through  
Blinded by such beauty caught so unaware  
You're stripped and burning in his fiery stare  
  
Angel of light, descends to the Earth  
To challenge the might of the son  
The angel of light, descends on the Earth  
To take back the crown from the One  
  
No mercy doth the dragon bring  
Harken now his beating wings  
Fire dances on the air  
The seventh serpent leaves his lair  
Invoking all the hounds of Hades  
The shrouded angels meet his gaze  
Spouting flame upon the wise  
The legions steal into the skies  
To fly, to fly  
  
Crashing, burning, locked in wars embrace  
The desolate one meets with his fiery fate  
His armies smitten by the sword of him  
Our lord of lords, the holy king of kings  
  
No more fear of phantoms of the night  
Rejoice in the city of unending light  
No more tears of dying  
On his throne he's shining  
Raise the chalice for eternity  
  
Angel of light descends on the Earth  
And dies by the roar of the lamb  
The angel of light, descends on the earth  
And is crushed by the might of the lamb
