Masquerade, masquerade,  
Grab your mask and don't be late  
Get out get out well disguised  
Heat and fever in the air tonight  
  
Meet the others at the store,  
Knock on other people's door  
Trick or treat they have the choice  
little ghost's are makin'lotsa noise  
  
But watch out beware  
listen take care  
  
In the streets on Halloween  
There's something going on  
No way to escape the power unknown  
In the streets on Halloween  
The spirits will arise  
Make your choice, it's hell or paradise  
Ah it's Halloween  
Ah it's Halloween tonight!  
  
Someone's sitting in a field,  
Never giving yield  
Sitting there with gleaming eyes  
Waiting for big pumpkin to arise  
Bad luck if you get a stone  
Like the good old Charlie Brown  
You think Linus could be right  
The kids will say it's just a stupid lie  
  
But watch out beware  
listen take care  
  
In the streets on Halloween  
There's something going on  
No way to escape the power unknown  
In the streets on Halloween  
The spirits will arise  
Make your choice, it's hell or paradise  
Ah it's Halloween  
Ah it's Halloween tonight!  
  
Listen now we are calling yo  
And there's magic in the air  
Magic in the air on Halloween  
  
Black is the night full of fright  
You'll be missing the day  
What will be here very soon  
Changing your way  
A knock at your door  
Is it real or is it a dream  
On trembling legs you open the door  
And you scream on Halloween  
  
Darkness  
Where am I now  
Is there anybody out there  
What has happened  
Am I in heaven  
Or is it hell  
  
I can see a Light comin'  
It's comin' nearer  
It's shining  
It's shining so bright  
It's shining on me  
  
I am the one, doom 's in my hands  
Now make your choice,  
redeemed or enslaved  
  
I'll show you passion and glory  
He Is the snake  
I'll give you power and abundance  
He's the corrupter of man  
  
Save me from the evil one  
Give me strength to carry on  
I will fight for all mankind's  
deliverance and peace of mind  
  
But watch out beware  
listen take care  
  
In the streets on Halloween  
There's something going on  
No way to escape the power unknown  
In the streets on Halloween  
The spirits will arise  
Make your choice, it's hell or paradise  
Ah it's Halloween  
Ah it's Halloween tonight!  
  
Yeah, it's Halloween  
Yeah, it's Halloween tonight
