I'm gonna move to Southern California  
Got me a ride and a reason to ignore you  
Got me a radio ain't got no speakers  
Ain't much use so I'm leaving it,  
Leaving it for you  
I'm leaving it for you  
Could be back for you  
  
Gotta find a room and I'm running out of money  
Staying up late but I gotta get up early  
Why did I move to southern california  
Smiles, kisses, blue  
Someone should have warned you  
They should have warned you  
Could be back, I could be back for you  
  
Why did I run  
Southern California  
Why did I run  
Southern California  
Southern California  
Why did I run  
Southern California  
Southern California  
Southern California  
Southern California  
  
Why did I move to Southern California?
