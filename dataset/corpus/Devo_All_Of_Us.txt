I left home with a friend of mine  
Gone two years and I don't know why  
Now I'm happy all the time  
I can't think and I'm feelin' fine  
I got feelings but they don't show  
Don't ask me cause I don't know  
No no no no no  
All of you  
Think you've heard this all before  
Now your're gonna hear some more  
I know a place where dreams are crushed  
Hopes are smashed but that ain't much  
All you stupids anyway  
We're all gonna die some day  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
All of us  
Me leave home with booji boy  
Teeth fall out of china doll  
Poo poo man got jiffy-snipped  
Bad girl launching - floppy tits  
Listen listen me no lie  
We like stuff what makes us cry  
Why why why why!!!!?  
All of us
