Reflections in my mind, thoughts I can't define  
My heart is racing and the night goes on  
I can almost hear a laugh, coming from your photograph  
Funny how a look can share a thousand meanings  
Well intended lies, contemplating alibis  
Is it really you, or is it me I'm blaming  
A distant memory flashes over me  
Even though you're gone, I feel you deep inside  
  
Dance beneath the light with that look in your eyes  
  
[Chorus:]  
I can't stop loving you, time passes quickly and chances are few  
I won't stop till I'm through loving you, girl  
  
There's a window in a heart, I've tried to look through from the start  
You're never really sure what someone else is thinking  
Someone's broken something new, another altered point of view  
Just a certain someone's conscience playing  
  
I held it in my hand, I did not understand  
What lives inside the wind that cries her name  
Tried to catch a shooting star, what seems so close can't be that far  
I'm living in a dream that's never ending  
  
Dance beneath the light with that look in your eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Dancing with that look that's in your eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can't stop loving you, time passes quickly and chances are few  
I won't stop till I'm through loving you, loving you...
