[J. Cole]  
Hey, to the college kids no scholarships  
Starting your semester  
Unpacking your suitcases filling up your dresser  
Enjoy it while you got it, after that it's God bless ya  
Life is your professor, you know that b-tch is gon test ya  
I got some sh-t I'd like to get off my chest  
I spill out my soul, I spit out my stress  
And can I spit out my stress?  
It's the feeling in the air you bout to drop a real classic  
He said Cole, "a lil birdy told me on the low you got an Illmatic"  
Nobody touching Nas n-gga it's more like Villematic  
These fayettnam tales be paying off well  
What story is my audio theatre gon tell  
I know my debut will ship, but is it gon sell?  
I guess it's in God's hand's  
I make the type of pieces that make Jesus say God damn  
That's for your non-believers  
I'm the truth only time will teach ya  
And f-ck the haters probably never love they momma's neither  
Old bitter-ass sit around in middle class homes with computers on hating on
the newest song  
While you was browsing I was taking out them student loans  
Trying to do this sh-t better than the n-ggas we grew up on  
Name a f-cking song I aint threw up on  
Talk is cheap, it's like ya'll grew up in a Jewish home!  
Pardon the stereotype  
But ya'll giving me mixed feeling's like you married a white woman  
One minute I'm over-rated, next minute I'm the saviour  
You hate it before you played it, I already forgave ya  
For bullsh-ttin' and the n-gga Cole spittin' it real  
Wrote this line on a plane got flown straight from the Ville  
To Miami, where the same time last year  
I was broker than you, I just wanna make that clear  
Cause now I'm dealing with money I've never seen before  
And Rnb b-tches want me, that was just dreams before  
Now do I give in to the temptation I'm facin'  
The thought of losing a good woman keep me from chasin'  
But I'm just a man, at time's the timing is wrong  
Plus my d-ck is like a man with a mind of it's own  
But I'm trying to be strong, remind myself she ain't about sh-t  
These hoes the same, all that change is the outfit  
Looking for chesse on some mouse sh-t  
Suck a n-gga, f-ck a n-gga, than go run they mouth quick  
Rappers took a vacation I came over the house sit  
You want change, this that "between the seats in your couch" sh-t  
The f-ck you thought, I lost it  
All that flame on my name would get exhausted  
Au contraire my n-gga they all ears  
Sit back, enjoy the ride it's finna be a long year, yeah  
It's finna be a long year, yeah  
  
I know you feel that, the tingle in your spine don't conceal that  
Don't conceal that  
This exactly what you thought  
Somebody bought the real back  
[End]
