Silent as a willow tree  
This road moves like a, a river to me  
Sun goes down on Wisdom Street  
Break the glass and throw away the key  
  
Somewhere out where the fates collide (collide)  
Cigarettes and candlelight  
I sit here in the lone cafe  
So stripped away (oh, oh)  
So stripped away  
  
Ah, huh:  
Huh:huh  
Oh, ah, oh, ah  
  
Everybody knows  
I'm your street corner Romeo  
Everybody knows  
You're my Juliet in rags  
And Charlie Parker loves me  
  
Sit with me forever more  
Is the draft too cold when they open door  
Seem to me whenever you're drunk  
And we'll drift away, drift away (drift away)  
  
Ah, huh:  
Huh:huh  
Oh, ah, oh, ah  
  
Everybody knows (everybody)  
I'm your street corner Romeo (oh, yeah)  
Everybody knows  
You're my Juliet in rags  
And Charlie Parker loves me (ooh:)  
  
I feel your heart beat underneath my skin  
Like a New Orleans night  
But the rain can't get in  
So red-hot dig the beat up underneath a cool, cool night  
And the glass moonlight of spring  
  
Everybody knows (ooh:)  
I'm your street corner Romeo (oh, yeah)  
Everybody knows (know, yeah)  
You're my Juliet in rags  
  
Everybody knows (everybody knows)  
I'm your street corner Romeo, yes, I am  
(Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Everybody knows (yeah)  
You're my Juliet in rags  
And Charlie Parker loves me (ooh:)  
  
Everybody knows  
(I'm listenin' to ya, Charlie)  
I'm your street corner Romeo  
(Bird is fly high tonight)  
Everybody knows  
Everybody knows  
Charlie Parker loves me  
  
Everybody knows [yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah]  
(Fly away, Charlie)  
I'm your street corner Romeo-aca
