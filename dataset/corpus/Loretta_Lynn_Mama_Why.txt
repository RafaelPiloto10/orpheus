(feat. Ernest Ray)  
  
(Oh mama why did God take my daddy cause I'd been good just like he said to be  
I heard daddy pray dear Lord don't take me from them  
Oh mama why did God take him from me)  
Come here son you've asked mama somethin' that's even hard for me to
understand  
For there's one thing I do know  
Daddy wouldn't gonna see those tears in the eyes of this big man  
So stop cryin' now and listen real careful to every word mama has to say  
You see son God picks the sweetest most beautiful flowers that grow  
And he makes them the brightest shiniest stars that glow  
Now daddy talk with the Lord every day and daddy and God'll be real close  
So let's just say it seems that God takes the ones he loves the most  
(Oh mama why did God take my daddy)  
Son you haven't heard a word that mama said  
So come on now let's say your prayers and mama tuck you in bed  
And we must have questioned God cause he already has everything planned  
And honey daddy can't ever come back to us though we can go to him  
(Oh mama why did God take him from me)
