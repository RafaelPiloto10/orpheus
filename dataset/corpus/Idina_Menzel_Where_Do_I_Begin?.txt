Where do I begin my love?  
Starting with the things I haven't said enough of  
Starting with the day you changed my life and ending with the way I feel
tonight  
Where do I begin?  
  
Where do I belong if you're not here?  
This is way beyond my darkest fear  
Don't know where I am or where I start  
The trail in between is way too far  
Where do I begin?  
  
I've always counted all my blessings  
Knowing you'll defend me, stand by my side  
I always turn and lose my sense's each time I intended words to come out right  
Where do I begin my love?  
  
Maybe with the morning you brought me the sun  
Maybe with the stars from out of space  
You took a few and lit up my face  
Where do I begin?  
  
I've always counted all my blessings  
Knowing you'll defend me, stand by my side  
I always turn and lose my senses each time I intended for these words would
come out right  
  
Where do I begin my love?  
I always read the last page instead of the first one  
There's no need to rush it all in  
I love you and I'll say it again  
Where do I begin?  
Where do we begin?
