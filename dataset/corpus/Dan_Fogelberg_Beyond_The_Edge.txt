Beyond the edge twenty miles a minute  
Shot like a bullet from a frozen gun  
Beyond the edge way beyond the limit  
Beyond the edge on a downhill run  
  
Some play it cool, some take it easy  
Some never know what the snow can do  
Some call me fool, some call my crazy  
I may be crazy but I'm crazy about you  
  
Beyond the edge twenty miles a minute  
Shot like a bullet from a frozen gun  
Beyond the edge way beyond the limit  
Beyond the edge on a downhill run  
  
You got no guts, you get no glory  
There ain't no ruts along the easy ride  
Out on the edge it's another story  
Some got to take it to the other side  
  
Beyond the edge twenty miles a minute  
Shot like a bullet from a frozen gun  
Beyond the edge way beyond the limit  
Beyond the edge on a downhill run  
  
Beyond the edge twenty miles a minute  
Shot like a bullet from a frozen gun  
Beyond the edge way beyond the limit  
Beyond the edge on a downhill run  
  
Beyond the edge twenty miles a minute  
Shot like a bullet from a frozen gun  
Beyond the edge way beyond the limit  
Beyond the edge on a downhill run
