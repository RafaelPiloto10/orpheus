The moon was yellow and the night was young  
A smile brought us together, a  
And I was wond'ring whether  
We'd meet again some day  
  
The moon was yellow and a song was sung  
That vocal inspiration gave me the inclination  
To give my heart away!  
  
Her we are is our romance to continue?  
Will it be my luck to win you?  
May I look that far?  
  
Ah! My love is mellow and my hopes are strung  
Around that cupid fellow  
Behold! The moon is yellow  
And the night is young
