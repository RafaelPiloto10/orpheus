A taste of honey,  
Tasting much sweeter than wine  
  
Do do do  
Do do do  
  
I dream of your first kiss, and then,  
I feel upon my lips again,  
A taste of honey, a taste of honey  
Tasting much sweeter than wine  
  
I will return, yes I will return,  
I'll come back for the honey and you  
  
Do do do  
Do do do  
  
Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart,  
There lingers still, 'though we're far apart,  
That taste of honey, a taste of honey  
Tasting much sweeter than wine  
  
I will return, yes I will return,  
I'll come back (he'll come back)  
For the honey (for the honey)  
And you
