Something's coming down the street  
Something static under your feet  
Never looking left or right  
'coz she'll just blow you out of sight  
  
She's never waiting on your smile  
Devastating, what's in her style ?  
Situation no-go zone  
But she'll cut loose when she's alone  
  
[Chorus:]  
She's a love Blonde  
She's a love Blonde  
She's a love Blonde  
She's got that sensuality for love  
  
When the boys say "how you been  
What you doin', Can we get in ?"  
Eyes'll flash and lips will smile  
And she'll just tease them for a while  
  
'coz now you see her, now you don't  
You could be there, only you won't  
If you've got that "Savoir Faire"  
Well that girl knows and she's aware  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oooh, well if she fills your dreams tonight  
Oooh, just lay back and hold on tight  
  
[Chorus]
