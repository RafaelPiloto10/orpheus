[Chorus]  
I don't like the work but true I need the money  
My life is like a joke but to me is isn't funny  
People all around, telling me what to do  
And all I want to do is stay at home with you  
  
Time after time I say to myself  
Working all my life isn't good for my health  
Get old, get tired, get put on the shelf  
I do all the work, someone else gets all the wealth  
Wish I was on an island in the sun  
Where I wouldn't have to worry how to get things done  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Day after day becomes more of a grind  
Bills pile up, moneys harder to find  
Trying to get ahead money's harder to find  
If I don't give it up I'm gonna lose my mind  
Wish I was on an Island in the sun  
Where I wouldn't have to worry how to get things done  
  
[Chorus]
