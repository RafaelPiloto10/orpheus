I want to apologize for makin you wait so long for the sequel  
Wyclef, Mary J., this one called 'What About the Baby'  
You ever been like  
  
[Wyclef]  
Let me talk to my daughter  
Daughter this is your poppa  
I know it's been a while  
We haven't talked  
  
[Mary J. Blige]  
But daddy you've been gone  
And me and mom have been all alone  
It's been a struggle and you weren't there for us  
He say  
  
[Wyclef Jean]  
Okay, when I called you  
She wouldn't put you on the phone  
She call the police, restrainin order  
50 feet, from my home  
I tried, I ain't lyin  
It's so sad that the heavens cryin, AYY!  
Once a boy and twice a man  
I'm just tryin to do the best I can  
Give me a chance girl  
  
[Chorus: Wyclef]  
A grown man ain't supposed to cry  
So why does water fill my eyes when I hear your voice  
Everything gon' be alright  
Baby girl I'm by your side, dry your eyes  
  
[Mary J. Blige]  
Let's talk this over  
Now see I heard everything that you told her  
But it's gon' take more than words  
For you to be a father, uh-huh  
Responsibilities of a man  
Like stayin faithful just for the fam'  
What if she knew that you chose  
Another over her mother, aowwww!  
So you called her  
And I wouldn't put her on the phone  
I called the police yes, restrainin order  
50 feet, from my home  
I tried, I ain't lyin  
It's so sad that the heavens are cryin, yeahhh  
Once a girl, twice of a man  
And I'ma try to do the best I can  
I can't give you a chance noooo  
  
[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]  
A woman ain't supposed to cry  
So why don't you just wipe your eyes, dry your eyes  
You've learned a house is not a home  
When you're living all alone, and you want back home  
  
[Wyclef]  
Wait a minute girl! You're my joy, happiness that you bring  
Turn the fall back to spring girl, you're my bling  
You a hip-hop song I heard for the first time time  
Studied all the words to the rhyme  
You're my life, without you there's no sun, there's no moon  
There's no stars, shinin in the ni-iight  
  
[Mary J. Blige]  
But if I give you a chance, would you show me you care  
Be a man, no matter what the circumstances  
Ahhhow!  
  
[Wyclef]  
A grown man ain't supposed to cry  
So why does water fill my eyes when I hear your voice  
[Blige]  
You've learned a house is not a home  
When you're living all alone, and you want back home  
  
[Chorus: Wyclef]  
A grown man ain't supposed to cry  
So why does water fill my eyes when I hear your voice  
(What about the baby! What about the baby!)  
Everything gon' be alright  
Baby girl I'm by your side, I apologize!  
I cry, and I cry, I cry
