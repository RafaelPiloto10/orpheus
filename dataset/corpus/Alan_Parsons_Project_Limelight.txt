I can see the glow of a distant sun  
I can feel it inside  
Maybe this day could be the one  
  
I can hear the roar of a distant crowd  
They are waiting for me  
Calling my name  
Shouting out loud  
  
Holding on isn't always easy  
I ain't gonna change my mind  
  
Limelight you were all I ever wanted  
Since it all began  
Limelight shining on me  
Telling the world who I am  
Limelight don't let me slip right through your fingers  
There's a long way to fall  
After the years of waiting  
I'm gonna show them all  
  
I can see the world in a different light  
Now it's easy to say  
Where I went wrong  
What I did right  
  
I can hear the beat of a different drum  
Take it all in my stride  
Hold my head high  
Second to none  
  
Holding on wasn't always easy  
Nothing can change my mind  
  
Limelight you were all I ever wanted since it all began  
Limelight shining on me telling the world who I am  
Limelight don't let it slip right through your fingers  
There's a long way to fall  
After all the years of waiting, I'm gonna show them all  
Maybe the role's not easy, maybe the prize is small  
After all the years of waiting, I'm gonna show them all
