Raise your hands  
Raise your hands high  
Don't take a seat  
Don't stand aside  
This time  
Don't assume anything  
But go go go  
  
I am a problem child  
Ive been wild all my days  
All my anger and my rage  
My senses said it would lead me astray  
I said go go go  
  
Raise your hands  
Raise your hands high  
Don't take a seat  
Don't stand aside  
This time  
Don't assume anything  
This time  
Don't assume anything  
I said this time  
Don't assume anything  
  
One two three four  
Jump jump jump so high  
Watch me let you down  
If I stumble I will stumble  
If I fall I will fall  
Try to hold it like rain in the river  
But everything is getting bigger  
Better this wont last forever  
Touch me and fall  
Yeah
