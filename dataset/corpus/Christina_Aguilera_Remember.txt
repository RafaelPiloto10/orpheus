I remember that time when I first laid eyes on you  
I looked into your eyes and I knew all my dreams would come true  
With you  
Then you left last summer and rest of your family  
And you left me here all alone for the rest of eternity  
  
Chores  
It's not easy to move on and it's certainly not easy to  
Be as stong as you'd like to be  
Because you left me here with only one memory  
  
How could ya do it how could ya leave knowing what you've done  
How could stand blaming for what I have done  
What I have done  
  
It was a cold night and I was at home crying over you my  
Friends were there to calm me and I got up and I jumped  
Over the balcony  
  
I......  
I blame you my.... My friends do to  
It was all.... All because of you  
Because you left me to find someone new
