Sometimes I can't see past a day  
I know I'm growin' tired and I feel it, yeah  
And the song that I sing when the notes begin to ring  
It's hard for my head to get into the melody, yeah  
  
Day to day, I tell you  
Day by day  
I see faces all around me  
When they start to smile  
I just stop for a while  
And I say baby let me love you  
  
A small town store with an old wooden floor  
The old man inside sellin' dry goods  
Has a smile on his face  
Don't you know that's hard to replace  
I bet he's gonna live to be a hundred, yeah  
  
Day to day, I tell you  
Day by day  
I see faces all around me  
When they start to smile  
I just stop for a while  
And I say baby let me love you  
  
Summer is hot and the winter is cold  
People all doin' just what they're told  
It's too bad, it's too sad  
Thinkin' for yourself is a hard thing to do  
Well, don't you know they're depending on you  
To see them through, yeah  
To see them through  
It's the only thing you can do  
You know you got to see them through  
  
Shinin' my light like a candle so bright  
Show me the way to my future, yeah  
With your hand on my face  
Take me far from this place  
Honey, I'll be the key to your heavenly door  
Hear me, baby, calling to you now  
Don't you know now baby, well, they're countin' on you  
  
See me, baby, reachin' for you  
For you, reachin' out for you, baby  
Don't you see me reachin' out for you  
Hear me, baby, hear me callin' to you  
Don't you know, baby, that I'm countin' on you  
To see me through
