Sitting in Darwins theory  
And you're down in the 48  
I'm practicing politics  
Your practicing guitar and staying out late  
How'd we get so turned around  
Why did we make it so hard  
Why can't we cut it out tender  
Give us something good to remember  
  
Hey my my my my rock star  
Saw your feet leave the ground  
You said all I wanted to be is loud  
I was ushering your friends in  
I was I was  
I was trying to clear the aisles  
How'd you get so turned around  
Why did you make it so hard  
Why can't you cut it out I'm tender  
Give me something good to remember  
  
I said  
Cut it out  
Cut it all out  
  
So it's Alaska in the summertime  
In the wintertime I'm free  
The days are short cold and wasted  
Nowhere is warm enough for me  
Baby you tell me what happened  
Why did I make it so hard  
Can't I cut it our you're tender  
Give you something good to remember  
  
Baby you tell me what happened  
(Why did we make it so hard)  
How did I make it so hard  
(Can you tell me what happened)  
I wonder  
Oh cut it out I'm tender  
(Why did we make it so hard)  
Give me something  
Give me something good to remember  
(Why did we make it so hard)  
(Why did we make it so hard)  
(Can you tell me what happened)  
(Why did we make it so hard)  
(Can you tell me what happened)  
(Why did you make it so hard)  
(can you tell me what happened)  
(Why did we make it so hard)  
(Can you tell me what happened)  
  
I said  
Cut it out  
Cut it all out  
Cut it out  
Cut it all out  
  
Hey my my my rock star  
Cut it out  
How did we get so turned around  
Cut is all out  
Hey my my my rock star  
Cut it all out now  
Cut it all out now  
Hey my my my rock star  
How did we get so turned around  
Cut it all out now  
Cut it all out now  
Hey my my my rock star  
Cut it all out now  
Cut it all out now  
Hey my my my rock star  
How did we get so turned around  
Cut it all out now  
Cut it all out now  
Hey my my my  
Cut it all out  
  
Out
