Well sometimes I go out by myself  
And I look across the water  
And I think of all the things what you're doing  
And in my head I paint a picture  
  
'Cause since I've come on home  
Well my body's been a mess  
And I've missed your ginger hair  
And the way you like to dress  
  
Won't you come on over  
Stop makin? A fool out of me  
Why don't you come on over valerie?  
Valerie valerie valerie  
  
Did you have to go to jail  
Put your house on up for sale  
Did you get a good lawyer?  
  
Hope you didn't catch a tan  
Hope you find the right man  
Who'll fix it for you  
Are you shopping anywhere  
Changed the color of your hair  
Are you busy?  
  
And did you have to pay that fine  
You was dodging all the time  
Are you still busy?  
  
Since I've come on home  
Well my body's been a mess  
And I've missed your ginger hair  
And the way you like to dress  
  
Won't you come on over  
Stop makin? A fool out of me  
Why don't you come on over valerie?

Well sometimes I go out by myself

? Cause since I've come on home  
Well my body's been a mess  
And I've missed your ginger hair  
And the way you like to dress
