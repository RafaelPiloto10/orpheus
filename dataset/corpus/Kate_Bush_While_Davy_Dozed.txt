I stayed the night in your arms.  
Over half an hour I stayed awake,  
Looking at you.  
Your face seemed radiant,  
The walls to Steve  
With a crack emerged  
As I held you.  
Oo-ooh...  
While na-na ne-ne-na ne-na-na Davy dozed.  
I closed my eyes  
Realised the time is close for us to go.  
Hold me, oh hold me.  
Davy, Davy,  
Bending like a willow-branch.  
He rocks me like a baby.  
Oo-ooh...  
I know he loves another lady,  
But I still see him in the hallway  
Calling me.  
Oh, when we danced so closely,  
I really felt as though I was melting  
In a pool.  
Oo-ooh...  
Oh while na-na na-na na-na-na Davy dozed.  
I closed my eyes  
Realised the time is close for us to go.  
Hold me, please hold me.  
Davy, Davy,  
Bending like a willow-branch.  
He rocks me like a baby.  
Oo-ooh...
