A world without heroes  
Is like a world without sun  
You can't look up to anyone  
Without heroes  
And a world without heroes  
Is like a never ending race  
It's like a time, without a place  
A pointless thing  
Devoid of grace  
Where you don't know what your after  
Or if something's after you  
And you don't know why you don't know  
In a world without heroes  
In a world without dreams  
Things are no more than they seem  
A world without heroes  
Is like a bird without wings  
Or a bell that never rings  
Just a sad and useless thing  
Where you don't know what you're after  
Or if somethings after you  
And you don't know why you don't know  
In a world without heroes
