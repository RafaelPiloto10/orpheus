Busted flat in Baton rouge, headin' for the train  
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans  
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained  
Took us all the way to New Orleans  
  
I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna  
I was blowin' sad while Bobby sang the blues  
With them windshield wipers slappin' time  
And Bobby clappin' hands  
We finally sang up every song that driver knew  
  
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose  
And nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free  
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues  
Buddy, that was good enough for me  
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee  
  
From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun  
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul  
Standin' right beside me through everything I've done  
And every night he kept me from the cold  
  
Then somewhere near Salinas I let him slip away  
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find  
And I'll trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday  
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine  
  
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose  
Nothin' left is all he left me, yeah  
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues  
Buddy, that was good enough for me  
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee  
  
Enough for me and Bobby McGee  
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee  
  
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose  
And nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free  
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues  
Buddy, that was good enough for me  
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

Enough for me and Bobby McGee  
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee, yeah  
I let him slip away lookin' for the home I hope he finds  
Enough for me and my Bobby McGee  
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee, yeah  
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee, yeah
