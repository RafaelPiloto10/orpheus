Doesn't Seem That Long Ago  
  
Three Of Us Walkin' Down That Road  
  
Grey 55 Chevy, Parked In The Front Yard  
  
Little Melody Tagged Along  
  
Those Were the Best Days Now They're Gone  
  
Oh It's Been Twelve Years Since It Went Down  
  
Lord Lost My Best Friend Now  
  
I Can See Him, Fishin' On That Old Dock  
  
I Know I Can't Bring Back Yesterday  
  
But Oh Lord Can You Help Me Find My Way  
  
Down To Brickyard Road-Oh Walk On Down  
  
Down To Brickyard Road-He's With Me Now  
  
Swore I Say A Free Bird Fly  
  
Ridin' The Winds Of The Southern Sky  
  
When I Hear That Whistle Blow  
  
It Carries Me Back  
  
To Brickyard Road  
  
Brother Do You Realize What You've Done  
  
Touched The Hearts Of Everyone  
  
You Might've Died Too Young  
  
But Your Songs Live On  
  
I Know I can't Bring Back Yesterday  
  
But We'll Be All Together, Again Some Day  
  
(Repeat chorus)  
  
(Repeat Chorus 2nd Time)  
  
I Can See Him Standin' On The Dock  
  
His Old Chevy Out In The Front Yard  
  
Walk On Down-Walk On Down  
  
Momma And Daddy's, Doin' All Right  
  
Saw Melody Last Saturday Night She's All Grown Up She's Such A Pretty Girl  
  
Things Just Ain't The Same Since You Left Our World  
  
Oh Brickyard Road  
  
Hear Me Now  
  
I Can See Him, Down On Brickyard Road  
  
Swore I Saw A Free Bird Fly  
  
Ridin' The Winds Of The Southern Sky  
  
Down To Brickyard Road  
  
On Brickyard Road  
  
Oh Brickyard Road  
  
Wanna Go Back
