I'm a reader and a writer  
Not a lover or a fighter  
When it comes to push and shove  
I'm as peaceful as a dove  
  
I'm a tiger in the night  
When I'm talking of the fight  
When it comes to trading blows  
I'm the first one on my toes  
  
I'm a leopard in a cage  
When I'm on the printed page  
When it comes to blood and gore  
I'm the first one on the floor  
  
I'm a tiger in the night  
When I'm talking of the fight  
When it comes to trading blows  
I'm the first one on my toes  
  
Well I'm a man of stern repute  
When the opposition's mute  
When I start to lose my grip  
I'm the first one off the ship  
  
I'm a tiger in the night  
When I'm talking of the fight  
When it comes to trading blows  
I'm the first one on my toes  
  
I'm a man of stern repute  
When the opposition's mute  
When I start to lose my grip  
I'm the first one off the ship  
  
I'm a tiger in the night  
When I'm talking of the fight  
When it comes to trading blows  
I'm the first one on my toes
