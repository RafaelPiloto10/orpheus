(Roamer, roamer)  
Hello, I'm coming at your town again  
How's about a night, how's about a flight supernova  
I know, I've been kinda hot and cold  
But you never go away, no matter what I say,  
In the mornings  
  
[Chorus]  
My need is running low  
I've been moving everywhere  
Spreading out my wings, trying everything  
But that's over, 'cause when I'm on my own  
Waking up with someone new  
And now I feel the same, I'm mixing up their name  
It's like a roamer  
  
Goodbye, I'm going on the road again  
But I'm bringing you along,  
In each and every song that we cover  
And I, I always want to see your face  
Cause looking in your eyes, is where I see my life  
When I'm older  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Like a roamer, like a roamer  
Mississippi, Tennessee  
California , Lexico ,like a roamer  
Russia, San Francisco bay, to the UK,  
Round the world in 80 days  
Like a roamer  
  
When I go away, don't want to go away  
Don't want to go away, don't want to go away  
Don't want to go away, don't want to go away  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Mississippi, Tennessee  
California, Lexico, like a roamer  
Russia, Francisco bay, to the UK,  
Round the world in 80 days  
Like a roamer
