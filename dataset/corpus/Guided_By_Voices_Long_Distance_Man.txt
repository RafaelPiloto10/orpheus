He's a long distance man  
And he keeps on going because its not worth blowing  
And he does what he can because it not worth losing and  
There ain't no choosin  
Any other world that you live in  
Don't believe in second chance  
Sell another dream he won't take it  
So don't fake it when you dance  
Cover up your eyes in these bad times for  
The sad times passing years build another tower  
For your freedom he don't need them shed no tears.  
For the long distance man.....
