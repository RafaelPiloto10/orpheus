How could I forget what she had on  
Halter top with the capri pants on  
Had a smile that would stop time  
And pretty feet which is a fetish of mine  
Hair down to her shoulders barely  
Lip gloss with no make-up surely  
I wasn't gonna let her get away  
Until she heard me say  
  
Excuse me miss  
What's your name  
Where are you from  
And I come and possibly  
Can I take you out tonight  
To a movie, to the park  
I'll have you home before it's dark  
So let me know  
Can I take you out tonight  
  
Don't care if I get rejected  
At least then I won't regret it  
Regret the fact I missed the chance  
For romance at least  
I walk away knowing I tried my best  
And I'm going, I'm going on with my day  
Cause at least she heard me say  
  
Excuse me miss  
What's your name  
Where are you from  
And I come and possibly  
Can I take you out tonight  
To a movie, to the park  
I'll have you home before it's dark  
So let me know  
Can I take you out tonight  
  
Excuse me miss  
What's your name  
Where are you from  
And I come and possibly  
Can I take you out tonight  
To a movie, to the park  
I'll have you home before it's dark  
So let me know  
Can I take you out tonight  
  
That's why I had to come over  
And introduce myself to you  
Cause you never gonna know  
When you're gonna find love  
And hopefully I'll find it in you  
  
Excuse me miss  
What's your name  
Where are you from  
And I come and possibly  
Can I take you out tonight  
To a movie, to the park  
I'll have you home before it's dark  
So let me know  
Can I take you out tonight
