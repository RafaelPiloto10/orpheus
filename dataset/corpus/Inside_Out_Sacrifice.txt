I gave, I gave, you indulged yourself and robbed from my good will  
If not you who can I trust? Who can I trust to be fulfilled?  
Sacrifice  
I've done more than my share  
I kept you from drowning when I couldn't swim  
Now I'm sinking and you're not there  
  
You're not there  
You're not there  
You're not there  
  
So now I choke on every word that I said to your pretty face  
Like when I said that no one better, no one better could take your place  
Betrayal, lies lies thick in the air  
And should the bottom fall out on your life you'll turn around and I'm not
there  
  
I'm not there  
I'm not there  
I'm not there  
  
Don't waste your time insulting me, I'd do anything  
You take and you take then you just give it away  
So how can I give any more?  
There will be no more, there will be no more sacrifice
