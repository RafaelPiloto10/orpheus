[Tony Bennett]  
It don't mean a thing  
If it ain't got that swing  
(Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah  
Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah)  
  
[Lady Gaga]  
It don't mean a thing  
All you got to do is sing  
(Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah  
Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah)  
It makes no difference  
If it's sweet or hot  
  
[Tony Bennett]  
Just give that rhythm  
Everything you got  
  
[Both]  
Oh, it don't mean a thing  
If it ain't got that swing  
(Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah  
Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah)
