So close to paradise, but closer than I should be  
It's like I'm along for the ride, it happened unexpectedly  
Promised myself that I wouldn't ever love again  
But you make me feel something, my mind's always on you  
I was standing in the rain (I thought about you)  
I was riding on the train (I thought about you)  
Feeling high like I seem to do  
Every time I think about you  
Saw two lovers start to kiss (I thought about you)  
Had to hold back the tears (I thought about you)  
Other girls no more exist  
All because I think about you  
Nothing seems to help, I don't even know myself  
I'm trying not to think of you, but a heart does what it wants to do  
Pass you by, see you smile and I must admit I get  
So emotional, I think I'm falling for you  
Bought a pillow for my room (I thought about you)  
Heard Alicia sing a tune (I thought about you)  
It sends my rocket to the moon  
Every time I think about you  
Right from this heart of mine (I thought about you)  
I wanted you every time (I thought about you)  
What I feel is so divine  
And it's all because I think about you  
But I'm constantly reminded  
Reminded that you're only someone who I'd like to know  
You don't know me, you're my private fantasy  
You're with me, constantly in my mind  
Had a lovely day today (I thought about you)  
Wasn't hard to get through (I thought about you)  
Seems to happen easily  
Every time I think about you  
Took a walk with myself (I thought about you)  
Wish it could've been with you (I thought about you)  
But every star in the sky came out for me  
And it's all because I think about you
