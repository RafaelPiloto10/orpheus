I thought that I knew all there was to know  
I knew all about love  
I lived the highs and made it through the lows  
I knew all about love  
But now I must admit I'm surprised  
And feel I've only scratched the surface  
'Cause baby when I look in your eyes  
I understand my one true purpose  
  
You were sent to me  
By angels up above, I'm certain  
I thought I'd show you what love can be  
But what did I know  
Until along came you  
To teach me about love  
Oh yes, along came you  
To teach me about love  
  
And as this feeling grows with every day  
You awaken my heart  
A heart so full I fear that it may break  
If we're ever apart  
And though one day you'll be own your own  
You know I always will be near you  
As near as on the day you were born  
Call on me, you know I'll hear you  
  
You were sent to me  
For one reason, I can tell you  
You're here to show me what love can be  
'Cause what did I know  
Until along came you  
To teach me about love  
Oh yes, along came you  
To teach me about love  
  
Thula thula sana  
You mama uyeza  
Thula Thula sana  
Thula thula sana  
You mama uyeza  
  
You were sent to me  
By angels up above, I'm certain  
You're here to show me what love can be  
'Cause what did I know  
Until along came you  
To teach me about love, oh  
Oh yes, along came you  
To teach me about love  
Teach me about love  
Oh yes, along came you  
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby  
Teach me about love  
Baby, baby teach me about love  
Oh yes, along came you
