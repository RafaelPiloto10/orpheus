There's a silence full of stars for as far as I can see  
In the silence where you are do you ever dream of me  
The moon is dark the night is silver wild perfume is on the breeze  
I feel the stars cold as forever half as true as you and me  
And I'll be your friend I'll be your lover I'll be whatever you ever need  
Right to the end until it's over I swear to you you can count on me  
But my heart is breaking here tonight my soul is weary from the fight  
My God I've tried and I've been true my love I'm coming home to you  
[ harmonica ]  
I'll be your friend...
