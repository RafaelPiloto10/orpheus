You're gonna say something to the people?  
A prayer for you  
A prayer to you  
Just a simple thought of you means everything  
To my life you give meaning that you're the best thing  
So precious like it for life  
That why I send you up this prayer  
I pray for your protection your covering  
That everything intended for you, you'll receive  
And I believe he'll guide ya  
Right out of my prayer  
A prayer for you  
A prayer to you  
(I Pray for you)  
A prayer for you  
I'll do my best to be there for you everyday  
To be what my father wished he was to me  
Baby I got you  
Daddy you'll be there  
I'll be there to encourage you to be the best you can be  
You carry my name, I pray that you're better than me  
(I ain't going no where, even when I get on your nerves  
'Cause I'm your daddy)  
My prayer for you  
Son I pray for you
