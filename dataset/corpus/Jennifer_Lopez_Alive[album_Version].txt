Time goes slowly now in my life  
Fear no more of what Im not sure  
  
Searching to feel your soul  
The strength to stand alone  
The power of not knowing and letting go  
I guess Ive found my way  
Its simple when it's right  
Feeling lucky just to be here tonight  
And happy just to be me and be alive  
  
Love, in and out  
Of my heart  
And though life can be strange  
I can't be afraid  
  
Searching to feel your soul  
The strength to stand alone  
The power of not knowing and letting go  
I guess Ive found my way  
Its simple when it's right  
Feeling lucky just to be here tonight  
And happy just to be me and be alive  
  
I guess Ive found my way  
It's simple when it's right  
Feeling lucky just to be here tonight  
And happy just to be me and be alive
