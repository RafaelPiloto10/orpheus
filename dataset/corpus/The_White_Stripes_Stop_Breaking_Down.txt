Some pretty mama she starts  
Breakin' down  
Stop breakin' down  
Woo stop breakin' down  
The stuff I got is gonna bust your brains out  
Well it'll make you lose your mind  
  
You Saturday night women  
You love to  
Ape and crown  
You won't do nothin' but tear good mans  
Reputation down  
Stop breakin' down  
Woo stop breakin' down  
The stuff I got is gonna bust your brains out  
Well it'll make you lose your mind  
  
I gave my baby  
The ninety-ninth degree  
Shed just love to throw a pistol  
Down on me  
Stop breakin' down  
Hey stop breakin'down  
The stuff I got is gonna bust you brains out  
Well it'll make you lose your mind
