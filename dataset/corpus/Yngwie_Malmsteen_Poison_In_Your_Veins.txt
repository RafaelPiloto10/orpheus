I paint a smile on you  
'Cause you want me to  
Then I unmask you  
Laughing in your face  
  
If you had half a mind  
I wouldn't even try  
But you're so naive  
Just can't let you be  
  
Make me glorious  
And victorious  
I'm superior  
  
Time to pay the price  
Throw off my disguise  
Poison in your veins  
So easily deceived  
The lie that you believe  
Poison in your veins  
  
You follow my advice  
And feed my appetite  
What you leave behind  
I will claim as mine  
  
In the end you'll see  
What you're meant to be  
Something obsolete  
Mission is complete  
  
Call me a disgrace  
To the human race  
I don't give a damn  
  
It's time to pay the price  
Throw off my disguise  
Poison in your veins  
So easily deceived  
The lie that you believe  
Poison in your veins
