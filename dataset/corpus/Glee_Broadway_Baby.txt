Rachel:  
I'm just a Broadway Baby  
Walking off my tired feet  
Pounding Forty Second Street  
To be in a show, oh  
  
Blaine:  
Broadway Baby  
Learnin' how to sing and dance  
Waiting for that one big chance  
To be in a show, oh  
  
Blaine and Rachel:  
Gee, I'd like to be on some marquee  
All twinkling lights  
A spark to pierce the dark  
From Batt'ry Park to Washington Heights  
  
Rachel:  
Some day maybe  
  
Blaine:  
All my dreams will be repaid  
  
Rachel:  
Heck, I'd even play the maid  
  
Blaine and Rachel:  
To be in a show  
  
Rachel:  
Hey, Mister producer  
I'm talkin' to you, sir  
I don't need a lot  
Only what I got  
Plus a tube of greasepaint and a follow spot  
  
Blaine:  
I'm a Broadway Baby  
  
Rachel (Blaine):  
Broadway Baby  
Slaving at the five and ten (Oooo, Yeah)  
  
Blaine (and Rachel):  
(Dreaming of the great day when)  
I'll be in a show (Rachel: Oh, Oh, Oh)  
Hey, hey  
  
Rachel (Blaine):  
Oh, Broadway Baby (Broadway Baby)  
  
Blaine and Rachel:  
Making rounds all afternoon  
Eating at a greasy spoon  
To save on my dough  
  
At my tiny flat there's just my cat  
A bed and a chair  
Still I'll stick it till  
I'm on a bill  
  
Blaine:  
All over Times Square  
  
Rachel:  
All some day maybe  
  
Blaine and Rachel:  
If I stick it long enough  
I may get to strut my stuff  
  
Rachel:  
Working for a nice man  
  
Blaine:  
Like a Ziegfeld or a Weissman  
  
Rachel:  
In a  
  
Blaine and Rachel:  
Great big Broadway show
