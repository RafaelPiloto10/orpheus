Every woman have a snapping point  
You don't want her to snap no  
  
Someone stop Linda  
She just left the crib with a beretta  
She's on her way to pop her fiance  
It's the word on the street  
He was sleeping with Renee  
Lord knows, please someone stop Linda  
He don't even know she's coming  
Like the FBI, she gon' knock down the door with no warrant  
Lord knows, what happened to the good time lovin', lovin'  
  
My father used to tell me, son, listen  
There's a thin line between love and hate  
Once you cross that line, see there's no escape  
She love me, she love you not  
You don't want to open up Pandora Box no, no  
She will see that two men cheating  
When you said that two men working  
All I'm saying is just watch your back  
'cause tonight see I got a bad feeling Jack  
Linda's got a gat  
  
Someone stop Linda  
She just left the crib with a Beretta  
She's on her way to pop her fiance  
It's the word on the street  
He was sleeping with Renee  
Lord knows, please someone stop Linda  
He don't even know she's coming  
Like the FBI, she gon' knock down the door with no warrant  
Lord knows, what happened to the good time lovin', lovin'  
  
Listen to me now  
Every barrel got a Linda  
Trust me you don't want that drama  
When you laughing she's crying  
Mascara running down her face, now she's plotting  
Like Method Man, she gon' bring the pain  
Like Cypress Hill you got a insane in the membrane  
All I'm saying is just watch your back  
'Cause tonight see I got a bad feeling Jack  
Oh my God  
  
Someone stop Linda  
She just left the crib with a beretta  
She's on her way to pop her fiance  
It's the word on the street  
He was sleeping with Renee  
Lord knows, please someone stop Linda  
He don't even know she's coming  
Like the FBI, she gon' knock down the door with no warrant  
Lord knows, what happened to the good time lovin', lovin'  
  
Someone stop Linda (Samson fell for Delilah)  
Someone stop Linda (Ahab fell for Jezebel)  
Someone stop Linda (King David fell for ?)  
And coming in the mist  
Linda wants to head up the baptist  
Someone stop Linda  
He don't even know she's coming
