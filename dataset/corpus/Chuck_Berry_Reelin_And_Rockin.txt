Sometimes I will, then again I think I won't  
Sometimes I will, then again I think I won't  
Sometimes I do, then again I think I don't  
  
Well I looked at my watch, it was 9:21  
We was at a rock'n'roll dance having nothing but fun  
  
[Chorus]  
And we rolled, reelin' and a rockin'  
We was reelin' and a rockin'  
Rollin' till the break of dawn  
  
Well I looked at my watch, it was 9:32  
There's nothing I would rather do than dance with you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I looked at my watch, it was 9:43  
And everytime I spinned she would spin with me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I looked at my watch, it was 9:54  
I said, " Dance ballerina girl, go go go!"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I looked at my watch, it was 10:05  
Man, I didn't know if I was dead or alive  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I looked at my watch, it was 10:26  
But I'm gonna keep on dancing toll I get my kicks  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I looked at my watch, it was 10:28  
I gotta get my kicks before it get too late  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I looked at my watch, it was 10:29  
I had to hold her hand, she was still holding mine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I looked at my watch and to my surprise  
I was dancing with a woman that was twice my size  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I looked at my watch and it was time to go  
The bandleader said " We ain't playing no more "  
  
[Chorus]
