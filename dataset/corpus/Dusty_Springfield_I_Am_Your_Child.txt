And I am your child  
Wherever you go  
You take me too  
Whatever I know  
I learned from you  
Whatever I do  
You taught me to do  
I am your child  
And I am your chance  
  
Whatever will come  
Will come from me  
Tomorrow is won  
By winning me  
Whatever I am  
You taught me to be  
I am your hope  
I am your chance  
And I am your child  
  
Whatever I am  
You taught me to be  
I am your hope  
I am your chance  
And I am your child
