My man he don't love me he treats me oh so mean  
My man he don't love me he treats me oh so mean  
He's the meanest man that I've ever see  
  
My baby wears high peg pants stripes are really yellow  
Baby wears high peg pants stripes area really yellow  
When he starts into love me he's so fine and mellow  
  
Love will make you drink and gamble make you stay out all night long  
Love will make you drink and gamble make you stay out all night long  
Love will make you do things that you know is wrong  
  
Do right baby if you stay home every day  
I'll do right baby if you stay home every day  
You're so mean and evil I know you're gonna drive me away  
  
Why did he leave me why did he have to go  
Why did he leave me why did he have to go  
Went off and left me baby I loved him so  
  
I'll be a good wife to you if it means anything to you  
I'll stay home every night and I'll love you  
And kiss you every night and one of these days  
If you're good to me honey one of these day  
If God is good to me I'll bring you a little burny  
  
Come back to me baby try me one more time  
Cos without your loving I swear I'm gonna lose my mind
