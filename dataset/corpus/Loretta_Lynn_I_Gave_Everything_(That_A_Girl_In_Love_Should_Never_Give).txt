It's too late but something tells me I was wrong  
For doing the one thing that I did  
Ah I'd prove I can I had let you have your way  
And I gave everything that a girl in love should never give  
When we made love it brought the meanings to my life  
You taught me a brand new way to live  
Ah now it's debtful if I'll ever be your wife  
And I gave everything that a girl in love should never give  
I gave you the part of me that no one else had touched  
Because I loved you and you said you wanted me so much  
Now you've changed and it's because of what I did  
I gave everything that a girl in love should never give  
You don't know the hurt you've put deep in the heart of me  
You've got what you wanted now you want no part of me  
Mhm now you've changed and it's because of what I did  
I gave everything that a girl in love should never give
