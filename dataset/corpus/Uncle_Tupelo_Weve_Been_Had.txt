There's a guitar leaning on a Marshall stack  
Used to sound like the sun on the horizon  
Now I think we've been had  
There's a young girl screaming all the way in the back  
  
Poor kid, she never saw it coming  
Now she knows she's been had  
Watching the label spinning on my turntable  
There's no call waiting in my headphones  
  
And every star that shines in the back of my mind  
Is just waiting for its cover to be blown  
There's an eardrum bleeding, yeah it's in my head  
How could I still be so in love when I know  
  
We've been had?  
Republicans and Democrats can't give you the facts  
Your parents won't tell you 'til you're grown  
That every star that shines in the back of your mind  
  
Is just waiting for its cover to be blown  
Flashing the badges, just like the law of averages  
Nobody likes 'em where they're from  
And every star that hides on the back of the bus  
  
Is just waiting for its cover to be blown
