He was the King of trees  
Keeper of the leaves  
A deep green god of young  
Love stained memory  
We used to meet by him  
Far from the hustling town  
I loved you  
Now they've come to cut you down  
Down  
  
He was the guardian of days  
We held the same  
Beneath the shade he gave  
Shelter from the rain  
Oh Lord how its empty now  
With nothing save the breeze  
Now they've come to burn the leaves  
Don't burn the leaves  
  
And if my mind breaks up  
In all so many ways  
I know the meaning of  
The words I love you  
And if my body falls inside  
An early grave  
The forest and the evergreens  
Are coming to take me back  
So slowly as I roll  
Down the track  
  
The forest and the evergreens  
Are coming to take me back  
The forest and the evergreens  
Are coming to take me back  
Please take me back  
  
He was the King of trees  
Keeper of the glades  
The way he enchanted my life  
Makes me so amazed  
We used to meet by him  
Many years ago  
I love you  
Now they've come to lay the road  
Don't lay the road
