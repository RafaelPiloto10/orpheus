Hawaii's callin'  
When I hear the rhythm of the hula rock, hula rock  
  
In the South Pacific where the trade winds blow  
They thought that the hula was a little bit slow  
So they stepped it up with a go, go, go  
And that's where they got that rock and roll  
  
In the South Pacific now, they're gettin' with it  
On the beach at Waikaki  
And it's a lula when they try the hula  
With a rockin', rollin' beat  
  
Take me back where the trade winds blow  
To the land of the hula where they never get old  
And the gooney birds dance with a go, go, go  
And the natives join in with a rock and roll  
  
With me it's a riddle how they break in the middle  
And yet stay on the beat  
But I want to sway with 'em when I hear the rhythm  
Of the rockin' hula beat  
  
Rockin' and a-rollin' in Waikaki  
Rockin' and a-rollin' in Waikaki  
Rockin' and a-rollin' in Waikaki  
Rockin' and a-rollin' in Waikaki  
Don't stop just let her rock  
  
Hawaii's callin'
