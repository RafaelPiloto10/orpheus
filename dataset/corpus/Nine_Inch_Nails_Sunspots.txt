Sunspots cast a glare in my eyes  
Sometimes I forget I'm alive  
I feel it coming and I've gotta get out of it's way  
I hear it calling and I come cause I can't disobey  
I should not listen and I shouldn't believe  
But I do, yes I do  
  
She turns me on  
She makes it real  
I have to to apologize  
For the way I feel  
  
My life it seems has taken a turn  
Why, in the name of God, would I ever want to return  
  
Peel off our skin, we're gonna burn what we were to the ground  
Fuck in the fire and we'll spread all the ashes around  
I want to kill away the rest of what's left  
And I do, yes I do  
  
She turns me on  
She makes it real  
I have to to apologize  
For the way I feel  
  
And nothing can stop me now  
There is nothing to fear  
And everything that ever was  
Is inside us here  
  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
Inside us here  
  
Now I just stare into the sun  
And I see everything I've done  
I think I could've been someone  
But I can't stop what has begun  
When everything's been said and done  
And there is no place left to run  
I think I have to be someone  
Now I just stare into the sun
