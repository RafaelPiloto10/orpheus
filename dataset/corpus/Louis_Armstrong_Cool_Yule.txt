From Coney Island to The Sunset Strip  
Somebody's gonna make a happy trip  
Tonight, while the moon is bright  
  
He's gonna have a bag of crazy toys  
To give the Groanies of the boys and girls  
So dig, Santa comes on big  
  
He'll come a-callin' when the snow's the most  
When all you cats are sleepin' warm as toast  
And you gonna flip when old Saint Nick  
Takes a lick on the peppermint stick  
  
He'll come a-flyin' from a higher place  
And fill the stocking by the fire place  
So you'll have a yule that's cool  
  
Yeah, from Coney Island to The Sunset Strip
