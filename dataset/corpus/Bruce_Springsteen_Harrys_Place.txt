Downtown hipsters drinking up the drug line  
Down in the kitchen working in the coal mine  
Got a special sin, mister, you can't quite confess  
Messy little problem, maybe baby need a new dress  
Razor-back diamond you shine too hard  
Need a hammer help you handle a little trouble in your backyard(Bring it on
down to Harry's Place)  
  
When Harry speaks it's Harry's streets, in Harry's house it's Harry's roads  
You don't wanna be around, brother, when Harry scolds  
It's Harry's car, Harry's wife, Harry's dogs run Harry's town  
Your blood and money spit shines Harry's crown  
You don't fuck with Harry's money, you don't fuck Harry's girls  
These are the rules, this is the world  
  
(You bring it on down to Harry's Place)  
(Bring it on down to Harry's Place)  
  
You need a little shot of something, dear, to improve your health  
A taste of that one little weakness you allow yourself  
You're looking for the key of that box you locked yourself in  
Just stood up to the line and be one of Harry's friends  
  
Shadow on the corner, no light, no sign  
Nobody on the street 'cept the deaf, dumb, and blind  
Now Connor's on the couch, Father McGowan's at the bar  
Chief Horden's at the door checking who the fuck you are  
  
C saw Bobby dressed in drag and Mr. Nice  
Carry me into a back room and dim the lights  
My arms strapped to the table, a thousand angels spinning up the room  
A voice whispers in my head, "We do what we must do"  
(When we bring it on down to Harry's Place)  
(Bring it on down to Harry's Place)  
(Bring it on down to Harry's Place)  
(Bring it on down to Harry's Place)  
  
Nobody knows his number, nobody knows his name  
If he didn't exist, it'd all go on just the same  
(Bring it on down to Harry's Place)  
(Bring it on down to Harry's Place)  
(Bring it on down to Harry's Place)  
(Bring it on down to Harry's Place)
