[Verse 1]  
She is the life of the party  
Don't stick that knife in my body  
It's something she always wanted  
It's for a good cause you're doing a good job  
And we're off where the wind blows  
And I don't care where we go  
Just like the ocean  
You change what I see  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
They don't know what I know  
How long I've had to hold  
You're like a commotion  
All because of me  
  
[Chorus]  
So take it off, let's break down all of our walls  
Right now I wanna see it all  
I don't wanna cool off, so let's cross the lines we lost  
Right now I wanna see it all  
You were right on the border  
Give me all of this  
Give me all of you  
Don't fall on me  
Don't lean on me  
  
[Verse 2]  
Beautiful insanity  
You're like a movie, change the scene  
Taste your sweet profanity  
It's is all for a good cause think you're doing a good job  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
They don't know what I know  
How long I've had to hold  
You're like a commotion  
All because of me  
  
[Chorus]  
So take it off, let's break down all of our walls  
Right now I wanna see it all  
I don't wanna cool off, so let's cross the lines we lost  
Right now I wanna see it all  
You were right on the border  
Give me all of this  
Give me all of you  
Don't fall on me  
Don't lean on me  
You were right on border  
  
[Bridge]  
Give me all of this, give me all of you  
No falling in, don't need no proof  
Give me all of this, give me all of you  
No falling in, don't need no proof  
  
[Chorus]  
So take it off, let's break down all of our walls  
Right now I wanna see it all  
I don't wanna cool off, so let's cross the lines we lost  
Right now I wanna see it all  
You were right on the border  
Give me all of this  
Give me all of you  
Don't fall on me  
Don't lean on me  
You were right on the border
