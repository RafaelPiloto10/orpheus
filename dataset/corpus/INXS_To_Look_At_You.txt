What is the name to call  
For a different kind of girl  
Who knows the feelings  
But never the words  
  
To look at you  
And never speak  
Is so good  
For me tonight  
To look at you  
And never speak  
Is so good  
For me tonight  
What is the name to call  
For a different kind of girl  
Who knows the feelings  
But never the words  
  
Who do you ask when there's no one  
Left to turn to  
You ask me and I'll always try to hear  
Past money and colors and make believe  
Good cheap values for a thrifty clown  
  
To look at you  
And never speak  
Is so good  
For me tonight  
To look at you  
And never speak  
Is so good  
For me tonight  
To look at you  
And never speak  
Is so good  
For me tonight  
What is the name to call  
For a different kind of girl  
Who knows the feelings  
But never the words  
  
What do you fear in the simple  
Still of a summer's night  
I understand I sympathize for a day dream  
Fairytailes and I love you  
  
What is the name to call  
For a different kind of girl  
Who knows the feelings  
But never the words  
To this, real life documentary
