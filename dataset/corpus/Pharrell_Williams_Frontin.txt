Don't wanna sound full of myself or rude  
But you ain't looking at no other dudes cause you love me  
(I'm sorry but.. so sexy)  
So you think about a chance  
You find yourself trying to do my dance  
Maybe cause you love me (Uh, you do it well)  
So then we tried - ain't feeling this love now  
Because you weren't used to how fast we touched (fast we touched)  
Then we locked eyes - and I knew I was in there  
And I was gon' tear ya ass up (tear ya ass up)  
  
I know that I'm carrying on, nevermind if I'm showing off  
I was just frontin (you know I want ya babe)  
I'm ready to bet it all, unless you don't care at all  
But you know I want ya (you should stop frontin babe)  
  
Trying to be the best girlfriend you could be  
But still you sneak and look at me, and girl I love it  
Then you give your other girl a shove  
Tell her you gon' palm her ass like it was  
And she's gon love it (whoa-oh whoa, yeah yeah)
