Intro: I'm so high. [Puffy] Rock on!  
  
Verse One:  
  
Ll Cool J:  
Black shades, three-quarter leathers and medallions  
Honies lined up ready to ride like stallions  
Since good love is hard to find  
I snatch up the real hot ones and make 'em mine  
I let my track record speak instead of me  
On a level that the halfway players will never see  
Uhh, wave your drinks in the air  
Shorty turn around keep the ass right there  
Focus your attention-let your eyes  
Get paralyzed, by the size  
Of my rocks, just remember that members of my click carry glocks  
We got it locked down  
Mo' flowin', click rollin'  
Niggaz still smokin' [L get 'em open]  
Team rough scoop the cream with the puff  
You oughtta stop sleepin', you don't dream enough  
  
Mary J. Blige:  
Oooooh baby, not tonight, I don't wanna fuss and fight  
I just wanna make it right  
Oooooooh, there's work to do  
I wanna get real close to you, I wanna get you in the mood  
All the things, you want to do  
Just relax, and I'll take care of you  
And anytime you want me  
I'm sayin' that I love you everyday  
And I know that you want me, baby admit it  
  
Chorus: Gimme all your love and don't stop  
My love's waiting when you reach the top  
All night long  
Come into my bedroom honey  
What I got will make you spend money  
All night long  
  
Verse 2:  
  
Mary J. Blige:  
You know, that I know that you love me  
So if you just give me a change  
I can still show you romance  
I know, that you still savor for my flavor baby  
So stop playin' hard to get  
Let's make love like we first met  
All the things, you want to do  
Just relax, and I'll take care of you  
And anytime you want me  
I'm sayin' that I love you everyday  
And you know that you want me baby admit it  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 3:  
  
Ll Cool J:  
Girlfriend you get me open like Moet, cherry goes pop  
When my love drops  
Two G's in my pockets for tricks  
So tell your girlfriends to warm up and mingle with my click  
You're only a customer  
You're walking in the presence of hustlers  
I did it just right  
Spent money all night  
Magnums of Moet  
Get your lips wet  
  
Chorus 2X
