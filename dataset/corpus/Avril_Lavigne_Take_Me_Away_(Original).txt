Don't say no to anything,  
Yes, yes, say yes to everything,  
Just find away, to get away (wanna run away?)  
Let's take off our clothes, and see if anybody notices  
Then run away, what d'you say?  
Have a little joy have a little faith, live life  
Have a little hope have a lot of fun  
  
[Chorus:]  
'Cause you, you, you never know what fate will throw,  
To make you stop,  
I, I, I'm gonna try  
To let this life  
Pick me up and take me away  
  
Run up to a stranger,  
Kiss and tell them that you love them,  
And then walk away,  
You made their day (at least you hope you did)  
Stand up in a restaurant,  
Start dancing on the table,  
Get kicked out for that behavior (oops I did it again)  
Have a little joy have a little faith, live life  
Have a little hope have a lot of fun  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Don't you know that nothing equals nothing,  
Do anything, do everything, do something  
Open up your mouth and let your soul sing  
  
You, you, you never know what faith will throw,  
To make you stop  
  
[Guitar solo]  
  
You, you, you never know what fate will throw,  
To make you stop  
I'm gonna try,  
To let this life,  
Pick me up and take me away
