Tell me a story of mind over matter  
The hope and the glory of life ever after  
The sound and the fury the cloak and the dagger  
Days when we sink like a stone  
Porcelain portraits and silver medallions  
Plasticine soldiers that march in battalions  
Angels of mercy and lifelong companions  
Days when we sink like a stone  
There's a room somewhere with a different look  
Where your secret life is an open book  
Where the love we made was a chance we took  
Days when we sink like a stone  
Ladybird fly away our friends are gone  
Ladybird fly away our house is on fire  
Let us be lovers we'll melt after midnight  
Hoist up the mainsail we'll coast through the daylight  
Twisted like candles that fade in the half-light  
Days when we sink like a stone  
Well we die sometimes to begin again  
When the same old dreams have the same old end  
When we lose our mind or we lose our friends  
Days when we sink like a stone  
Ladybird fly away our friends are gone  
Ladybird fly away our house is on fire  
Ladybird fly away our friends are gone  
Ladybird fly away our house is on fire  
Your friends have gone  
Porcelain portraits and silver medallions  
Your friends have gone  
Plasticine soldiers that march in battalions  
Your friends have gone  
Angels of mercy and lifelong companions  
Tell me a story of mind over matter  
The hope and glory of life ever after  
The sound and the fury  
The cloak and the dagger  
Ladybird fly away our friends are gone  
Ladybird fly away our house is on fire  
Ladybird fly away our friends are gone  
Ladybird fly away our house is on fire  
Ladybird fly away our friends are gone  
Ladybird fly away our house is on fire  
Ladybird fly away our friends are gone  
Ladybird fly away our house is on fire
