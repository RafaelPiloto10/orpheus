The palpitating cherry-red organ was returned to its rightful place and began
to beat faster as it led our hero, counting out time, through his first
romantic encounter.  
  
I'm counting out time,  
Got the whole thing down by numbers.  
All those numbers!  
Give me guidance!  
O Lord I need that now.  
  
The day of judgement's come,  
And you can bet that I've been resting,  
for this testing,  
Digesting every word the experts say.  
Erogenous zones I love you.  
Without you, what would a poor boy do?  
  
Found a girl I wanted to date,  
Thought I'd better get it straight.  
Went to buy a book before it's too late.  
Don't leave nothing to fate.  
I studied every line, every page in the book,  
Now, I've got the real thing here, I'm gonna take a look, take a look.  
  
This is Rael!  
  
I'm counting out time, hoping it goes like I planned it,  
'cause I understand it. Look! I've found the hotspots, Figs 1-9.  
Still counting out time, got my finger on the button,  
"Don't say nuttin' just lie there still  
And I'll get you turned on just fine."  
Erogenous zones I love you.  
Without you, what would a poor boy do?  
  
Touch and go with 1-6.  
Bit of trouble in zone No. 7.  
Gotta remember all of my tricks.  
There's heaven ahead in No. 11!  
Getting crucial responses, dilation of the pupils.  
"Honey get hip! It's time to unzip, to unzip, zip, zip-a-zip-a-zip.  
Whipee!"  
(Take it away Mr. Guitar)  
  
I'm counting out time, reaction none to happy,  
Please don't slap me,  
I'm a red blooded male and the book said I could not fail.  
I'm counting out time, I got unexpected distress from my mistress,  
I'll get my money back from the bookstore right away.  
Erongenous zones I question you  
Without you, what would a poor boy do?  
Without you, what would a poor boy do?  
Without you, mankind handkinds through' the blues.
