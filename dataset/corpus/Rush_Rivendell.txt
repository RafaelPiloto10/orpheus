Sunlight dances through the leaves  
Soft winds stir the sighing trees  
Lying in the warm grass  
Feel the sun upon your face  
Elfin songs and endless nights  
Sweet wine and soft relaxing lights  
Time will never touch you  
Here in this enchanted place  
  
You feel there's something calling you  
You're wanting to return  
To where the misty mountains rise and friendly fires burn  
A place you can escape the world  
Where the dark Lord cannot go  
Peace of mind and sanctuary by loud water's flow  
  
I've traveled now for many miles  
It feels so good to see the smiles of  
Friends who never left your mind  
When you were far away  
From the golden light of coming dawn  
Till the twilight where the sun is gone  
We treasure ev'ry season  
And ev'ry passing day  
  
We feel the coming of a new day  
Darkness gives way to light a new way  
Stop here for a while until the world,  
The world calls you away  
Yet you know I've had the feeling  
Standing with my senses reeling  
This is the place to grow old till  
I reach my final day
