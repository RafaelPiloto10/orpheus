I know what you're doing and I'll save you the trouble  
I saw you wink for the waiter to slip me a double  
If you want some barroom swinger I'm not the one  
'Cause I don't think a girl's gotta drink to have fun  
Mama said when I went out in the world drinking ain't the thing for a sweet
young girl  
I didn't listen then but now I'm here to shout  
That my dear old mama knew what she was talkin' about  
So if you want another round just order one  
'Cause I don't think a girl's gotta drink to have fun  
  
Don't bother bringing a bottle when you call  
'Cause I like my kisses straight or not at all  
I want to be sure I remember everyone  
And I don't think a girl's gotta drink to have fun  
Mama said when I went out...  
No I don't think a girl's gotta drink to have fun
