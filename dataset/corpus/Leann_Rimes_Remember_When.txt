Do you remember your imagination?  
When Neverland was your destination  
Your magical adventure isn't over yet  
Just hold on tight and don't forget  
  
Every wish, every dream you ever had  
Just close your eyes  
And it will all come rushing back  
Fly away  
All you need is to believe and remember when  
  
You never know where your dreams might take you  
So keep them safe and sound don't let reality break you  
Feel your sweetest memories come and carry you away  
Just get lost in yesterday  
  
Every wish, every dream you ever had  
Just close your eyes  
And it will all come rushing back  
  
Fly away  
All you need is to believe and remember when  
  
Surrender to the innocence  
You thought you left behind  
And reach the child that lives inside  
  
Every wish, every dream you ever had  
Just close your eyes  
And it will all come rushing back  
Fly away  
All you need is to believe and remember when  
  
Fly away  
All you need is to believe and remember when
