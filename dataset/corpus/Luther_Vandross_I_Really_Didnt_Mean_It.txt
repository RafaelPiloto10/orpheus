I told my girl bye-bye (bye)  
And I really didn't mean it  
Said I met somebody new so fine (fine)  
And I really didn't mean it  
  
Out of my head to say the things I said  
I didn't mean a word  
Think jealousy just took a hold of me  
I hope she'll ignore the things she heard  
(No doubt about it) My heart is in her hands  
(With every moment) I'm waiting for a second chance  
(Maybe an angel) Will come and help her see  
I can't face the world if she don't love me  
  
I told my girl bye-bye (bye)  
And I really didn't mean it  
Said I met somebody new so fine (fine)  
And I really didn't mean it  
When I walked away I cried (cried)  
And I really didn't mean it  
So she took me back cause she knew I (I)  
Really didn't mean it  
  
Dear one from me take my apology  
I need you back  
I promise I know o never let you go  
Is there a chance to see you baby  
(They talk about all) the love that we still share  
(From her emotion) I barely miss your happiness  
(You're missing and mourning) the way it used to be  
I know it's true but I don't believe  
  
I told my girl bye-bye (bye)  
And I really didn't mean it  
Said I met somebody new so fine (fine)  
And I really didn't mean it  
When I walked away I cried (cried)  
And I really didn't mean it  
So she took me back cause she knew I (I)  
Really didn't mean it  
  
I want you back it can't be any other way  
I want you back and I've waited for the day  
I want you back I'm gonna be a little smarter  
I want you back I'm gonna try a little harder  
She's good She's fine and always on my mind  
I know our love will stand the test of time  
She's my girl and my best friend  
And I really didn't mean it  
Her love is love so fine and so for real  
I want the world to know the way I feel  
She's my girl and my best friend  
And I really didn't mean it  
Yeah... yeah.. ooh...
