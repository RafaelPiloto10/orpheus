By your leave, I think that I'll be going now  
I think I've stayed a little long  
I looked up all my mother's recipes  
I can't think what I did wrong  
  
We go to a restaurant, but you don't like wine  
You say it's love you want, but there is no time  
I realize, I can see it in your eyes  
You keep staring at the floor  
  
I used to look at your school photographs  
But I don't have them anymore  
I wonder who's in my old college rooms  
Or stuck on my old locker door  
  
I dream of the ships at sea, on a stormy night  
I wish that it was me, but I wake in fright  
I realize, I can see it in your eyes  
I've only got myself to blame  
  
Winter kisses when your lips were blue  
Like chasing wild geese in the snow  
Pressing faces on the window panes  
But that's a long long time ago  
  
We go to a restaurant  
You say it's love you want  
I realize, I can see it in your eyes  
You're moving on to something more
