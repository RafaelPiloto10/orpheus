Sometimes I think I go insane  
So what's a boy supposed to do  
Working just to pay my way  
But baby when the day is through  
Just wanna have a good time  
Hey! I've got my shoe, shoes shined  
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance  
  
Walking down the city street  
They don't like the kind of stuff I play  
But feel that bass beneath your feet  
Man don't take my only life away  
Just wanna have a good time  
Hey! I've got my shoe, shoes shined  
I'm gonna dance, dance, dance  
I'm scared when I wake up sometimes it gets so fast  
I want it high and higher but it never lasts  
And all I have starts friday night with my first drink  
Don't tell me, don't say anything, don't wanna think  
Just wanna dance
