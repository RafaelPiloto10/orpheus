All of a sudden all the past was behind me.  
All of a sudden nothing stood to remind me.  
All of a piece I am awake and I can say.  
  
All of a sudden I am finding religion.  
All of a sudden all my sins are forgiven.  
Now all at once it is down to you and me.  
  
I see light over there at the end of the tunnel and  
I don't mind if it takes a little more time.  
Come over here, don't take your hand away.  
Come over here, take my breath away.  
Now is the time to say what you want to say.  
(It's not a dream, this is really happening.)  
  
All of a sudden, now baby, it's love.  
All of a little just isn't enough.  
All of a sudden, now baby, it's real.  
All of the riddle comes perfectly clear.  
  
All in a moment I was brought through the darkness.  
All in one motion like the sun through the forest.  
Oh, by the grace I am alive and I will live.  
  
All of a sudden I am cleared of confusion.  
All of my happiness is real, not illusion.  
So many years I had to seek so I could find.  
  
I see light over there at the end of the tunnel and  
I don't mind if it takes a little more time.  
Come over here, don't take your hand away.  
Come over here, take my breath away.  
Now is the time to say what you want to say.  
(It's not a dream, this is really happening.)  
  
All of a sudden, now baby, it's love.  
All of a little just isn't enough.  
All of a sudden, now baby, it's real.  
All of the riddle comes perfectly clear.  
  
Come over here, don't take your hand away.  
Come over here, and take my breath away.  
Now is the time to say what you want to say.  
(It's not a dream, this is really happening.)  
  
All of a sudden, now baby, it's love.  
All of a little just isn't enough.  
All of a sudden. now baby, it's real.  
All of the riddle comes perfectly clear.  
  
All of a sudden, now baby, it's true.  
All of a sudden I believe in you.  
All of a sudden I'm fooling around.  
All of a sudden I know what I found.  
I know what I found.  
I know what I found.  
I know what I found.
