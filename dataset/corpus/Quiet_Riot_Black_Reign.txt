[Verse 1:]  
Somebody?s watching, watching you all the time  
Somebody?s waiting, waiting for you to lose your mind  
Wishes are like broken glass show the cracks of you past  
Thought you left it all behind  
Sailing on ship of fools  
You got nothing left to prove  
Hidden from the naked eye  
  
[Chorus:]  
Black reign- white light  
Your pain- will ignite  
Black reign -takes flight  
You know it heals as it bites  
Black reign- It?s like looking directly at the sun  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Move my soul and take me to a higher place  
Let it go and see the storm face to face  
All the answers are within- the secrets that you see as sin  
It?s a deal that you make with yourself  
Intervene your vanity  
Forget about your sanity  
We all have a tale to tell  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge:]  
Blot out the rays of the sun  
Deep in your mind it will come  
Take all the things that you?ve learned
