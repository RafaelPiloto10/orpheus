There you go again when you  
Rub up against my skin  
I have to catch my breath  
I began to sweat, oh  
Lips tracin' down my neck and  
it's scarin' me to death  
How'd you learn to draw me  
to the cliff  
Just to push me off  
Just to push me off the edge  
  
[Chorus]  
Damn, I hate the way you  
know me and  
Damn, you kill me when you  
hold me  
Like I'm your world, like this  
won't hurt  
Like a favorite curse hittin'  
every nerve  
Damn, I'm fightin' and I'm losin'  
and  
Damn you, you're pullin' and  
I'm pushin'  
I'm wrestlin' with,  
I toss and twist  
Till finally I give in, Damn  
  
I hate bein' addicted only  
You would have predicted that  
I'd be torn and worn so thin  
You can see right through  
You can see right through my  
soul  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I get reckless, scared, confused  
I feel desperate so for you  
And you know it, you know it  
You know it, yes you do  
  
[Chorus]
