Stranded in the middle of a hurricane  
I've got an umbrella but nowhere to stay  
Do I give up now, do I face the cold  
I better get some boldness  
Looking to the left I see it coming  
I'm alone and I'm scared and it's heading my way  
Do I run, do I hide, do I dare close my eyes  
Do I face the fear inside  
Time after time  
Lord, I'll keep running back to you  
Keep running back to you  
I, I realize this time that I'll be fine  
Even if the stars fell like rain  
Even if tomorrow never came  
Even if the world I know should crumble  
Nothing's gonna stand in my way  
Even if the sun left the sky  
And even if these tears never dry  
Even if the mountains fall and tumble  
If what's left of me is taken, I will not be shaken  
Landed in the middle of the desert  
And I'm wondering why what keeps me alive  
When the water I drink  
And the air that I breathe is dry  
Time after time  
Lord, I'll keep running back to you  
Keep running back to you  
I, I realize this time that I'll be fine  
Even if the stars fell like rain  
Even if tomorrow never came  
Even if the world I know should crumble  
Nothing's gonna stand in my way  
Even if the sun left the sky  
And even if these tears never dry  
Even if the mountains fall and tumble  
If what's left of me is taken, I will not be shaken  
Even in the darkest night  
I know I'll be alright  
The world is bound to change  
But you always stay the same  
You give me joy, you give me hope  
You give me love that doesn't change  
Even if the stars fell like rain  
Even if tomorrow never came  
Even if the world I know should crumble  
Nothing's gonna stand in my way  
Even if the sun left the sky  
And even if these tears never dry  
Even if the mountains fall and tumble  
If what's left of me is taken, I will not be shaken  
Even if the stars fell like rain  
Even if tomorrow never came  
Even if the world I know should crumble  
Nothing's gonna stand in my way  
Even if the sun left the sky  
And even if these tears never dry  
Even if the mountains fall and tumble  
If what's left of me is taken, I will not be shaken
