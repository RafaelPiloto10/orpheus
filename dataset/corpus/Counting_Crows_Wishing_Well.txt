Did you think you were unbelievable  
Then, I see that  
Twenty-four hours in a wishing well  
Thinking about drowning  
Thinking about pennies in heaven  
I guess I'll realize in a day or more  
I guess I'll tilt my head back in the rain  
Drown myself on sky  
I guess I'll realize in a day or more  
I guess I'll realize when I'm buried in the evidence  
Did you think you were irresponsible  
Well I don't see that  
One or two children on a workingman's salary  
Doesn't seem like a lot to ask  
I guess I'll realize in a day or more  
I guess I'll realize when her baby starts to cry  
Mothers in welfare lines  
Husbands who said good-bye  
I think I realize  
I think I realize, yeah  
Didn't you wonder where your bright-eyed babyboy has gone  
He's sleeping in the bottom of a wishing well  
Whispering' the ripples through the fates and changes  
Did you think you were young and beautiful  
Then, I see that  
One or two people sliding gracefully together and apart  
This sort of thing never lasts  
I guess I'll realize in a day or more  
I guess I'll realize when I'm twisting in the wind  
After I say good-bye, I guess I'll understand why  
I guess I realize  
I guess I realize  
Didn't you wonder where your bright-eyed babyboy has gone  
He's a victim in the bottom of a wishing well  
Wishing he was anywhere but there and gone  
And, didn't anyone wonder where their bright-eyed babyboy has gone  
He's sleeping in the bottom of a wishing well  
Wishing he wasn't suffering the same dreams all day long  
I think I realize  
I think I realize  
Ahh baby, I think that I realize  
I think I realize..
