Looking out the window  
Waiting for your headlights  
To pull up in the driveway  
It's really coming down tonight  
You're scared that I won't make it through the storm  
You should be here with me, safe and warm  
  
I'll be waiting under the mistletoe  
While you're driving here through the winter snow  
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home  
When the only gift that I really need  
Is to have your arms wrapped around me  
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home  
Home this Christmas  
  
Pacing down the hallway  
Trying to fight the urge to call  
I could almost hear a pin drop  
'Cept for the clock on the wall  
And I'm scared you won't make it through the storm  
You should be here with me, safe and warm  
  
I'll be waiting under the mistletoe  
While you're driving here through the winter snow  
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home  
When the only gift that I really need  
Is to have your arms wrapped around me  
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home  
Home this Christmas  
  
I'm praying that you make it home tonight  
So we can lay down by the fireside  
You and I till Christmas morning  
There's nothing else that I want this year  
More than just to have you here, whoa  
I'll be waiting  
  
I'll be waiting under the mistletoe  
While you're driving here through the winter snow  
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home  
When the only gift that I really need  
Is to have your arms wrapped around me  
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home  
Home this Christmas  
  
Looking out the window  
Waiting for your head lights  
To pull up in the driveway  
It's really coming down tonight
