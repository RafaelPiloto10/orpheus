I wanna wish ya'll a happy christmas  
(A merry christmas)  
I mean merry christmas  
Let the carols begin...  
  
Jingle Bells  
(Jingle bells)  
Jingle all the way  
(All way)  
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh  
(We ridin' ridin')  
Jingle bells  
(Jingle bells)  
Jingle all the way  
If ya notice it just might be santa elves and trey  
(Flo Rida)  
  
[Trey Songz:]  
Dashing thru the snow  
Flo Rida and Trey  
Whip on 24's so we stuntin' all the way  
(All the way)  
Look up at the stars  
(Stars)  
There goes santa claus  
I asked him for some jewels  
And a really nice watch  
  
[Chorus:]  
Jingle Bells  
(Jingle bells)  
Jingle all the way  
(All way)  
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh  
(We ridin' ridin')  
Jingle bells  
(Jingle bells)  
Jingle all the way  
If ya notice it just might be santa elves and trey  
  
(Flo Rida)  
  
[Flo Rida:]  
Heyy  
What fun it is to be a rida  
On the snow with 24" tyres  
All the way how we navigate to the south pole cause the ice is just a lil  
Bit brighter  
All the gifts just lil bit liver  
Settin it got kicks that's fire  
Every door got a reindeer driver  
Pull off the red nose might surprise ya  
Stockings for the (holidays)  
I call it my (dollar day)  
Reach inside don't hesitate  
Ya might find money with santas face  
I'm ballin' with all the girls  
My chimney gets all the mail  
Stay stuntin till my presents fell  
Flo rida and the jingle bells  
  
Jingle Bells  
(Jingle bells)  
Jingle all the way  
(All way)  
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh  
(We ridin' ridin')  
Jingle bells  
(Jingle bells)  
Jingle all the way  
All the way now  
If ya notice it might be santas elves and trey  
(Flo Rida)
