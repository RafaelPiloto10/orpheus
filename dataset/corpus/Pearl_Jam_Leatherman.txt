I read about a man to whom I may be related  
Leatherman  
Died a long time ago, in the 1880s  
Leatherman, Leatherman  
  
Covered with leather but it wasn't tight  
Underneath the moon in the woods at night  
  
Making the rounds, ten miles a day  
Once a month they spot him  
Here's what they say:  
  
"Here he comes, he's a man of the land  
He's Leatherman  
Smile on his face  
Axe in his pack  
He's Leatherman, Leatherman, Leatherman."  
  
Comes out of the caves once a day to be fed  
He wasn't known to say much  
But, "Thanks for the bread."  
  
So modern day I walk my way, my jacket faded  
Just like a man of leather to whom I may be related  
  
Rolled a cigarette for which he asked for a light  
Appeared to be an animal, yet so polite  
  
Making the rounds, ten miles a day  
Once a month they spot him  
Here's what they say:  
  
"Here he comes, he's a man of the land  
He's Leatherman  
Smile on his face  
Axe in his pack  
He's Leatherman, Leatherman, Leatherman  
He's Leatherman, Leatherman."  
  
Shakes his head, he's Leatherman  
Bake some bread, he's Leatherman  
Shame he's dead  
I saw his bed  
It's all that's left of Leatherman  
Leatherman  
Give me some skin, Leatherman.
