Fare thee well, little broken heart  
Downcast eyes, lifetime loneliness  
  
Whatever walks in my heart will walk alone  
  
Constant longing for the perfect soul  
Unwashed scenery forever gone  
  
Whatever walks in my heart will walk alone  
  
No love left in me  
No eyes to see the heaven beside me  
My time is yet to come  
So I'll be forever yours  
  
Whatever walks in my heart will walk alone  
  
No love left in me  
No eyes to see the heaven beside me  
My time is yet to come  
So I'll be forever yours  
  
No love left in me  
No eyes to see the heaven beside me  
My time is yet to come  
So I'll be forever yours  
  
Whatever walks in my heart will walk alone
