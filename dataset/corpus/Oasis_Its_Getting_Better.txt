Say something shout it from the rooftops off your head  
Make it sort of mean something make me understand  
Or I'll forget  
The people here on lifes beaches  
They wish upon the waves that hide the sand  
Let them know that life theaches you  
To build a castle in your hand  
Maybe the songs that we sing are wrong  
Maybe the dreams that we dream are gone  
Bring it on home and it won't be long  
It's getting better man!  
  
Hey! what was that you said to me?  
Just say the word and I'd be free?  
And when the stars are shining bright  
We're getting better man!  
  
And crashing in upon a wave  
It's calling out beyond the grave  
And we're the fire in the sky  
We're getting better man!  
  
Build something, build a better place and call it home  
Even if it means nothing you'll never ever feel that your alone  
  
Cos maybe the songs that we sing are wrong  
Maybe the dreams that we dream are gone  
Bring it on home and it won't be long  
It's getting better man!  
  
Hey! what was that you said to me?  
Just say the word and I'd be free?  
Yeah as the fire in the sky  
It's getting better man!  
  
And crashing in upon a wave  
It's calling out beyond the grave  
And when the stars are shining bright  
It's getting better man!  
  
It's getting better man!  
  
And what was that you said to me?  
You told me one day I'd be free  
And when the fire's burning bright  
I'm getting better man!  
  
And crashing in upon a wave  
It's calling out beyond the grave  
And when the stars are in the sky  
We're getting better man  
  
We're getting better man,  
We're getting better man,  
We're getting better man,  
We're getting better man,  
We're getting better man,  
  
We're getting better man,

We're getting better man,  
We're getting better man,
