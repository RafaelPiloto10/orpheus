Her momma's still got that sequin gown that she wore in '68  
She taught her early how to smile that smile and wave from the parade  
It took a whole lot of years and tears  
For her momma to finally admit  
No matter how many stitches and pins  
That old dress was never gonna fit  
  
She was daddy's little girl  
Momma's little angel  
Teacher's pet, pageant queen  
She said "All my life I've been pleasin' everyone but me,  
Living someone else's dream"  
  
Her daddy used to say, "You'll make a lovely bride someday  
He'll ride up on big white horse and just carry you away"  
It took twenty-five years and some broken vows  
Before they'd finally see  
There's a little more to love and life  
Then fairy tales and hand me down dreams  
  
She was daddy's little girl  
Momma's little angel  
Teacher's pet, pageant queen  
She said "All my life I've been pleasin' everyone but me,  
Living someone else's dream"  
  
Now she's got twenty-seven candles on her cake  
And she means to make her life her own  
Before there's twenty-eight  
  
She was daddy's little girl  
Momma's little angel  
Teacher's pet, pageant queen  
She said "All my life I've been pleasin' everyone but me,  
Living someone else's dream"  
  
She was daddy's little girl  
Momma's little angel  
Teacher's pet, pageant queen  
She said "All my life I've been pleasin' everyone but me,  
Living someone else's dream"
