I love you whether or not you love me  
I love you even if you think that I don't  
Sometimes I find you doubt my love for you, but I don't mind  
Why should I mind, why should I mind  
  
What is Love anyway, does anybody love anybody anyway  
What is Love anyway, does anybody love anybody anyway  
  
Can anybody love anyone so much that they will never fear  
Never worry never be sad  
The answer is they cannot love this much nobody can  
This is why I don't mind you doubting  
  
And maybe love is letting people be just what they want to be  
The door always must be left unlocked  
To love when circumstance may lead someone away from you  
And not to spend the time just doubting
