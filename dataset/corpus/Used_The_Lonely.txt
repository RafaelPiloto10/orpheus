I see that face, that look in your eyes  
It's so hard to hide that look in your eyes  
You've been kicked down so many times  
Yeah you've tasted the dirt  
And you know what it's like  
  
Fill up your cup  
Fill it up to the top  
Take a sip, spit it out  
And fill it back up  
Cause you said half full  
Is never enough  
All alone and you've had enough  
  
Don't let me be, don't let me be  
All by myself, that's not how I felt  
Do I deserve to be one of the lonely?  
Hold my hand, stand by me  
All by myself that's not how I felt  
No one deserves to be one of the lonely  
Hold my hand, stand by me.  
  
I've got that face, that look in my eye  
It's impossible to hide  
That look in my eyes  
I've been kicked down so many times  
Yeah I've tasted the dirt,  
I know what it's like  
  
Fill up my cup  
Fill it up to the top  
Take a sip, spit it out  
And fill it back up  
Cause I said half full  
Is never though  
All alone and I've have enough  
  
Don't let me be, don't let me be  
All by myself, that's not how I felt  
Do I deserve to be one of the lonely?  
Hold my hand, stand by me  
All by myself that's not how I felt  
No one deserves to be one of the lonely  
Hold my hand, stand by me.  
  
How many times will we forgive  
What we just can't forget?  
Time after time and still  
We let it happen again  
How many times do we  
Deserve exactly what we get?  
I never wanted, no I never want to be  
  
All by myself  
That's not how I felt  
Do I deserve to be one of the lonely?  
Hold my hand, stand by me  
All by myself  
That's not how I felt  
No one deserves to be one of the lonely  
Hold me hand, stand by me.
