All the poems of my neighbors  
That drift across the sand  
Are just the tendrils of a vast  
But gentle plant which they command  
  
The headdress of a goddess  
You wore the night we came  
Is only one small symptom  
And really not to blame  
  
You're riding a tiger  
Riding a tiger  
  
Heaven sent immortals  
Waged upon the wall  
And likewise all the missiles  
Shot to make them fall  
  
Everlasting movie  
Picture into frame  
  
Riding a tiger  
Riding a tiger  
Riding a tiger  
  
All of the beaches  
Into the sky  
Into the beach of sun-glass goodbye  
  
Key grip was crying  
Best boy was made  
Here in the shelter  
Whole unafraid  
We were there  
  
Follow the road that leads to the sun  
Who formed our leader he is the one  
Who will offer the silence  
You must beware  
Using the page that no one can share  
  
Riding a tiger  
Riding a tiger  
Riding a tiger  
Riding a tiger  
  
Out of the morning  
Into the day  
Onto the evening  
Nowhere to stay  
  
We were always together  
Always the same  
Into the future  
No one to blame  
  
Riding a tiger  
Riding a tiger  
Riding a tiger  
Riding a tiger  
Riding a tiger  
Riding a tiger
