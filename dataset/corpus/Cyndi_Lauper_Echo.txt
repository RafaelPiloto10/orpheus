Woke up to the clock  
What knob makes it stop  
Time to be aware  
Time to just be there  
You go, go , go, go,  
I go, go , go, go,  
Conversations rare  
Trail off in the air  
Echo, echo, home, home  
  
All that rolls our way  
Wheels that time will play  
Happiness grows back  
Heartache leaves a scratch  
You go, go, go,go,  
I go, go, go , go  
Everyplace I go  
Never told you so  
Echo, echo, home, home  
  
[Chorus]  
All of my days, all of my life  
Standing by you  
All of my days, all of my life  
I will find you  
All of my days, all of my life  
Standing by you  
All of my days all of my life  
Landing next to you  
  
When you're on the top  
Notice what you've got  
I will be your frail  
When your on the trail  
You go, go, go, go  
I go, go, go, go  
Everything you know  
Everywhere you go  
Echo, echo, home, home  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I go back back back  
You go from the top  
Once till we drop  
Never like to stop
