Life is filled with gray  
But now he comes to me  
Please fall away  
Hip hop is playing again  
And it's bangin' too  
Gonna bang for you  
Don't stop this feeling I feel  
I just wanna run out all day for you  
And breathe for you at least  
I'm so into your rich history  
Tell me a story and take me away  
C'mon and take me ooh  
C'mon and take me with you  
  
Life is, better  
Now that, now that I've found you  
Life is, better  
Now that, now that I've found you  
Life is, better  
Now that, now that I've found you  
Life is, better  
Now that, now that I've found you  
Life is, better  
Now that, now that I've found you  
Life is, better  
Now that, now that I've found you  
Life is, better  
Now that, now that I've found you  
Life is, better  
Now that, now that I've found you  
  
One step at a time, a man walked on the moon  
One record got played Kool Herc said boom  
One minute young man, your time come soon  
We waiting, it was prophesied you loom  
We bang our drums, message in our sound  
We rastlers and we takin' up in your town
