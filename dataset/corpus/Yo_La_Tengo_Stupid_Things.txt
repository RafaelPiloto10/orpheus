For every stupid thing that happens to you  
Every single thing I say  
Did you stain a waist line into gray  
Every little thing just creeps up on you  
A bumpy road  
I could still reach them  
And it takes my breath away  
  
And I still want  
We always wake before we fall  
I always know that when we wake up  
You're mine  
Liquid the time that holds us down but  
I can barely slumber  
When does that time go before our eyes?  
  
Every stupid thing that happens to you  
Simpler things are said  
Not so hard to see  
But it seems so out of reach  
  
And I still want  
We always wake before we fall  
I always know that when we wake up  
You're mine  
And I still want  
We always wake before we fall  
I always know that when we wake up  
You're mine
