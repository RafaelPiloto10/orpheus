[Verse 1]  
I've been spinning now for time  
Couple women by my side  
I got sinning on my mind  
Sipping on red wine  
I've been sitting here for ages  
Ripping out the pages  
How'd I get so faded?  
How'd I get so faded?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Oh no no don't leave me lonely now  
If you loved me how'd you never learn  
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes  
One or two could free my mind  
  
[Chorus]  
This is how it ends, I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream  
Fading out again, I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream  
So tell me when it kicks in  
So tell me when it kicks in  
  
[Verse 2]  
I've been looking for a lover  
Thought I'd find her in a bottle  
God, make me another one  
I'll be feeling this tomorrow  
Lord forgive me for the things I've done  
I was never meant to hurt no one  
I saw scars upon a broken hearted lover  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Oh no no don't leave me lonely now  
If you loved me how'd you never learn  
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes  
One or two could free my mind  
  
[Chorus]  
This is how it ends, I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream  
Fading out again, I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream  
So tell me when it kicks in  
So tell me when it kicks in  
  
[Bridge x5]  
All the voices in my mind  
Calling out across the line  
All the voices in my mind  
Calling out across the line  
All the voices in my mind  
Calling out across the line  
All the voices in my mind  
Calling out across the line  
  
[Outro x6]  
Tell me when it kicks in  
I saw scars upon her  
Tell me when it kicks in  
Broken hearted
