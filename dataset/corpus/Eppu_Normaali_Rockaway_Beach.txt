Rockaway beach  
  
One-two-three-four!  
  
Chewing out a rhythm on my bubble gum  
The sun is out and I want some  
It's not hard, not far to reach  
We can hitch a ride to rockaway beach  
  
Up on the roof, out on the street  
Down in the playground the hot concrete  
Bus ride is too slow  
They blast out the disco on the radio  
  
Rock-rock-rockaway beach  
Rock-rock-rockaway beach  
Rock-rock-rockaway beach  
We can hitch a ride to rockaway beach  
(2x)
