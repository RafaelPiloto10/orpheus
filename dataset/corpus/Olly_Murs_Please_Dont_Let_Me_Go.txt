Where do I begin?  
Should I tell you  
How bad I need you now yeah  
You're underneath my skin  
But I'm confused  
My head is spinning all around  
I waited so long  
I need to know, darling  
What is on your mind  
  
Normally I try to run  
And I might even want to hide  
'Cause I never knew what I wanted  
Till I looked into your eyes  
So am I in this alone?  
What I'm looking for is a sign  
That you feel how I feel for you  
Baby please don't let me go  
Baby please don't let me go  
Baby please don't let me go  
No, please don't let me go  
Baby no, no, no, no  
  
Badabadeebaba  
What else can I say? (Can I say)  
My heart is beating double time, yeah  
And do you feel the same? (Do you feel the same)  
Don't leave me in the dark, no  
But baby don't put out this spark, no  
I waited so long  
I need to know, darling  
What is on your mind  
  
Normally I try to run  
And I might even want to hide  
'Cause I never knew what I wanted  
Till I looked into your eyes  
So am I in this alone?  
What I'm looking for is a sign  
That you feel how I feel for you  
Baby please don't let me go  
Baby please don't let me go  
Baby please don't let me go  
No, please don't let me go  
Baby no, no, no, no  
  
Caught in the inquisition  
Under these conditions  
I need a definition  
Is it love that we're sharing  
Show me that you're caring  
You see my fascination  
Tell me I'm not mistaken  
Give me the information I need  
One, two, three  
  
Normally I try to run  
And I might even want to hide  
'Cause I never knew what I wanted  
Till I looked into your eyes  
So am I in this alone?  
What I'm looking for is a sign  
That you feel how I feel for you  
Baby please don't let me go (Don't let me go)  
Baby please don't let me go (Please don't let me go)  
Baby please don't let me go (Don't let me go)  
No, please don't let me go  
Baby no, no, no, no
