'Bout time, 'bout time we had little taste of wasted time  
Like love a deux, I wasted time alone with you  
'Bout time we two we're livin' out a lovely dream come true  
'Bout you, 'bout me, 'bout love, yes  
  
'Bout time, 'bout time we spent good time with no one near  
To watch me while I say a little somethin' in your ear  
'Bout how I care, 'bout how I wanna make my feelin's clear  
About you, 'bout me, 'bout love  
  
We're in deep water, darlin', clear over my head  
'Bout time to either sink or swim, let's swim, 'nuff said  
  
'Bout time, 'bout time we didn't have to always steal a kiss  
'Bout time, 'bout time I had my arms around your waste like this  
My whole life through I wanna make you feel the way I do  
'Bout you, 'bout me, 'bout love  
  
Yes, we're in deep water, darlin', clear over my head  
'Bout time to either sink or swim, let's swim, 'nuff said  
  
'Bout time, yes time, we didn't have to always steal a kiss  
'Bout time, time, I had my arms around your waste like this  
My whole life through, I wanna make you feel the way I do  
'Bout you, about me, 'bout us, ooo-eee  
About your love and mine, budd-lee-ooo, 'bout time
