Hey  
Why'd you wake me from my nap?  
I'm not in the mood  
To play your games  
Or sit on your lap  
  
You  
Where's my Yankees drinking glass?  
I want some juice  
And I want it now  
So you better move your ass  
And feel bad for me  
'Cause I'm just getting over a cold  
  
I'm four years old!  
I'm four years old!  
I'm four years old!  
Somebody better tie my shoes!  
  
Now  
I run down the hall  
I scream and I yell  
And I cry 'cause I fell  
Bring the rubbing alcohol  
  
Outside  
I get mud on my shoe  
I come back in the house  
I get it on the rug  
The cleanging's up to you  
And I won't take a bath  
Unless you make me Spaghetti-O's  
  
I'm four years old!  
I'm four years old!  
I'm four years old!  
Mommy reads to me at night  
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory  
  
Well  
I can't have a job  
And I can't go to school  
If no grownups are around  
I can't go near the pool  
I'm not alowed to climb  
My neighbor's apple tree  
I'm not allowed to sit  
Too close to the TV  
I don't know how to drive  
And I don't know how to spell  
But if I hear my brother cursing  
I do know how to tell  
'cause he made me eat some bread  
That was covered in mold  
  
I'm four years old!  
I'm four years old!  
I'm four years old!  
I just threw up on my grandmother
