Come like the dusk  
Like a rose on the grave of love  
You are my lust  
Like a rose on the grave of love  
  
I curse the day I first saw you  
Like a rose that is born to bloom  
Don't look at me the way you do  
Like the roses, they fear the gloom  
  
Your thorns, they kissed my blood  
  
Your beauty heals, your beauty kills  
And who would know better than I do?  
Pretend you love me!  
  
Come like the dusk  
Like a rose on the grave of love  
You are my lust  
Like a rose on the grave of love  
  
Indeed, reality seems far  
  
When a rose is in love with you  
Slaves of our hearts, that's what we are  
We loved and died where roses grew  
  
They watched us silently  
  
A rose is free, a rose is wild  
And who would know better than I do?  
Roses are not made for love  
  
Come like the dusk  
Like a rose on the grave of love  
You are my lust  
Like a rose on the grave of love
