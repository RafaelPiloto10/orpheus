Sadly, that's how you're feeling  
Sorry, my heart was deceiving  
I want you to know, our time had it's reason  
Long before my love was gone  
I felt that this would go wrong  
Chorus:  
Don't be so unhappy  
Your life has just begun  
Don't be so unhappy  
There are wars that can't be won  
Daddy, I gave you a hard time  
Forgive me, for being so dumb, deaf 'n' blind  
Broke, hurt, hate, habibi  
We can't erase, can't rewind  
Long before my love was gone  
I felt that 'us' would turn out wrong  
Chorus  
Long before my love was gone  
I felt that things would go wrong  
Chorus
