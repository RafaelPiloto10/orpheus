Riddler Riddler ask me why  
The birds fly free on a mackerel sky  
Ask me whither goes the wind  
Whence the endless tick-tick stream begins  
  
Make me guess if the earth is flat or round  
Set a guessing if fantasies are unbound  
If tales aren't just for children to see  
That it's peace if sleep walks with me  
  
As you wish  
For kingdom come  
The one to know all the answers  
You think you dwell in wisdoms sea  
Still sweet ignorance is the key  
To a poet's paradise  
Challenge the Riddler and you will see..  
  
Riddler Riddler ask me why  
All mothers beneath the Earth and sky  
Hold their children's hands for a while  
Their hearts forever - yours and mine  
  
Make me wonder what's the meaning of life  
What's the use to be born and then die  
Make me guess who's the one  
Behind the mask of Father and Son  
  
As you wish  
For kingdom come  
The one to know all the answers  
You think you dwell in wisdoms sea  
Still sweet ignorance is the key  
To a poet's paradise  
Challenge the Riddler and you will see..  
  
For nature hates virginity  
I wish to be touched  
Not by the hands of where's and why's  
But by the Oceans' minds  
  
As you wish  
For kingdom come  
The one to know all the answers  
You think you dwell in wisdoms sea  
Still sweet ignorance is the key  
To a poet's paradise  
Challenge the Riddler and you will see..
