I'm living right next door to an angel  
And I just found out today  
I'm living right next door to an angel  
And she only lives a house away  
She used to be a skinny little girl  
But all of a sudden she's out of this world  
I'm living right next door to an angel  
And I'm gonna make that angel mine  
  
Since I saw her this morning  
I'm on cloud number nine  
There's a garden of Eden  
At the house next door to mine  
I took a look and oh what a shock  
To find a little bit of heaven  
Right here on the block  
I'm living right next door to an angel  
And I'm gonna make that angel mine  
  
I can't believe that this is the girl next door  
Her funny little face isn't funny no more  
Sixteen and oh what a dream  
Ain't it strange how she changed  
Into such a lovely angel  
  
Saw her walkin' down main street  
And I couldn't believe my eyes  
It used to be such a plain street  
But now it's paradise  
  
I feel so happy I'm feelin' so good  
I'm the luckiest devil in the neighbourhood  
I'm living right next door to an angel  
And I'm gonna make that angel mine
