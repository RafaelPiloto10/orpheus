I don't have to beg you to hold me  
Cause somebody else will  
You don't have to love me when I want it, no  
Cause somebody else will  
  
Your so called friends say you don't need it  
When all the time they're trying to get it  
Look out  
Your good thing is about to come to an end  
Your real good thing is about to come to an end  
  
All those nights I watched the four walls  
I did not have to watch them all alone  
When other men said they wanted me (whenever someone said)  
I didn't have to tell them I was your very own (think that I was)  
  
You have all the love that I've got baby  
Even ice melts to water and gets hot  
Look out  
Your good  
  
Gettin' myself back together  
Is going to be a big problem I know  
But when the right man says he wants me  
You can bet I won't tell him no  
  
Cause your real good
