Ran away from home when I was seventeen  
To be with you  
On the California coast  
  
Drinking margaritas all night in the old cantina  
Out on the California coast  
  
Don't think that I'm ungrateful  
And don't look so morose  
Adios  
Adios  
  
We never really made it baby  
But we came pretty close  
Adios adios  
  
Going up north where the hills are winter green  
I have to leave you  
On the California coast  
  
Going where the water's clear and the air is cleaner  
Than the California coast  
  
Our dreams of endless summer  
Were just too grandiose  
Adios  
Adios  
  
And I miss the blood red sunset  
But I miss you the most  
Adios adios  
Adios  
Adios  
Adios adios
