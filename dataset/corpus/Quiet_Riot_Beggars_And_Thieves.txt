[Verse 1:]  
Grain of sand, no man? S land, I wanna fly  
Fade away, that? S okay, I enjoyed the ride  
Incognito, fireflies, burning up my eyes  
Sanctify or receive a fortune full of lies  
Cover me- Disconnected all the way down  
I Gotta hold on  
  
[Chorus:]  
Beggars and thieves  
They won? T bring you no peace  
Beggars and thieves  
They're living on a one way street  
Standing on the edge of madness  
I look down and what do I see  
Beggars and thieves  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Detour ahead-it pretends to save the day  
Full of hope, low on faith, I feel compelled to pray  
Overwhelmed with emotion, the tea has been brewed  
Indiscreet and abandoned, I guess I? M pretty well screwed  
Forgive me, feeble minded out of control  
Break down, shakedown  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Bridge:]  
Safe cracker, scene stealer, a thief of the first degree  
Heartbreakers with no takers What does it mean?  
Dreaming of at time with no pain, Dreaming of the time when they came  
Nothing here but faded pictures, kinda smooth with faded textures
