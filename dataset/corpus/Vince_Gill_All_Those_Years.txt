Come on in and take your coat off  
Come on in and sit down  
If I seem a little nervous  
I've been walkin' shaky ground  
  
I've been alone since she left me  
And I'm not quite sure what to do  
So if I call her name I'm sorry  
It's all those years are hard to lose  
  
[Chorus]  
All those years with just one woman  
Was all gone in just a day  
All those years with just one woman  
Makes it hard to try to find a brand new way  
After all those years  
  
I guess I should take down her picture  
And try to put your mind at ease  
And tell myself it's really over  
And put aside this misery  
  
[Chorus]
