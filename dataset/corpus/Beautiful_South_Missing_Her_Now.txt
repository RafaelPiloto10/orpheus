(M. Greaves)  
  
I was always told that time could heal  
And change the way the broken-hearted feel  
Now I know it's not true  
For I'm sad and blue  
And I'm sure missing her now  
  
When she said goodbye  
I was not sad enough to cry  
The misery I'd known  
Would end somehow  
Oh, but I'm sure missing her now  
  
I always thought the single life would soothe me  
A different girl depending on my mood  
But the dance floor is no place for a lonesome heart  
And I'd wind up nailed to a barstool
