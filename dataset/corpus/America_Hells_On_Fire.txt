Drove through the valley on my way to the sea  
I was lookin' for the answer to what's botherin' me  
Sat there all day and I stared at the blue  
There's no denyin' I was thinkin' of you  
Hell's on fire, heaven's freezin'  
And I love you baby without good reason  
I walked to the corner, watch the world go by  
Hands in my pockets and my head in the sky  
What does it matter now that everything is fine  
When I can't eat, sleep, or even walk a straight line  
Hell's on fire, heaven's freezin'  
And I love you baby without good reason  
Hell's on fire, heaven's freezin'  
And I love you baby without good reason  
But it's hard, you make it hard, ah  
When I first met you I was barely alive  
Had no direction baby you had the drive  
We headed out on the wild open road  
Till we broke down from the weight of the load  
Hell's on fire, heaven's freezin'  
And I love you baby without good reason  
Hell's on fire, heaven's freezin'  
And I love you baby without good reason  
I drove through the valley on my way to the sea  
And I was lookin' for the answer to what's botherin' me  
Sat there all day and I stared at the blue, wow  
There's no denyin' I was thinkin' of you, but  
Hell's on fire, heaven's freezin'  
And I love you baby without good reason  
Hell's on fire, heaven's freezin'  
And I love you baby without good reason
