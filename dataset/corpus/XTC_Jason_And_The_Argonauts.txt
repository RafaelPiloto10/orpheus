There may be no golden fleece,  
But human riches I'll release  
  
Oh, my head is spinning like the world and it's filled with beasts I've seen,  
Let me put my bag down and I'll tell you it all right from the start,  
Like the scarlet woman who would pick on the boys she thought were green,  
And the two faced man who made a hobby of breaking his wife's heart.  
  
Seems the more I travel,  
From the foam to gravel,  
As the nets unravel,  
All exotic fish I find like Jason and the Argonauts  
  
There may be no golden fleece,  
But human riches I'll release  
  
I was in a land where men force women to hide their facial features,  
And here in the west it's just the same but they're using make-up veils.  
I've seen acts of every shade of terrible crime from man-like creatures,  
And I've had the breath of liars blowing me off course in my sails.  
  
Seems the more I travel,  
From the foam to gravel,  
As the nets unravel,  
All exotic fish I find like Jason and the Argonauts  
  
There may be no golden fleece,  
But human riches I'll release.  
  
I have watched the manimals go by  
Buying shoes, buying sweets, buying knives.  
I have watched the manimals and cried  
Buying time, buying ends to other peoples lives.  
  
Jason and the Argonauts  
  
There may be no golden fleece,  
But human riches I'll release.  
  
Jason and the Argonauts  
  
There may be no golden fleece,  
But human riches I'll release.
