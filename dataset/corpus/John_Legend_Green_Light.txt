Give me the green light, give me just one night  
I'm ready to go right now, I'm ready to go right now  
  
I'm ready to go right now, I'm ready to go right now  
  
I see you move, I'm checking your smile  
Working your back like it's going out of style  
Shake just a little bit faster  
Shake just a little now girl  
Dying to meet you, so let's mess around  
I've got an obsession of us getting down  
Come just a little bit closer  
I just need permission so just  
  
Give me the green light, give me just one night  
I'm ready to go right now, I'm ready to go right now  
We can go all night, give me the green light  
I'm ready to go right now, I'm ready to go right now  
  
One two three green light, but if it's what it seems like  
The you moving baby, lets me know it's gon' be right  
I'm ready to go right now, I'm ready to go right now  
  
One two three red light, I wanna see what you dance like  
But if I can be your buddy, help you study and get your head right  
I'm ready to go right now, I'm ready to go right now  
  
Do I have a girlfriend, technically no.  
If you'll be my girlfriend then I'll make it so  
You'll be my only true lover  
No competition, no others  
Baby it's just the thrill of the chase  
But I've got a feeling that I'm winning this race!  
Baby I'm gettin' closer, I just need permission so  
  
Give me the green light, give me just one night.  
I'm ready to go right now! I'm ready to go right now  
We can go all night, give me the green light  
I'm ready to go right now, I'm ready to go right now  
  
One two three green light, but if it's what it seems like  
The you moving baby, lets me know it's gon' be right  
I'm ready to go right now, I'm ready to go right now  
  
One two three red light, I wanna see what your dance like  
But if I can be your buddy, get your study and get your head right  
I'm ready to go right now, I'm ready to go right now  
  
So I went hard like Medusa staring at me  
I told her let's go, let's blow this lame nigga factory  
She said, What type of girl do you think I are  
The kind that you meet in a bar  
You think you can get whatever you want cause you some kinda star  
No I'm a comet, I just want you woman  
Hey, If I were you then It would be me that I go home with  
Three, the one and only, one thing you ain't considered  
I heard you when you told your girl "ooh he can get it" admit it,  
You did it let's hop a cab and split it  
I'm kiddin' we both going to where you livin'  
Ha, I got you gigglin' like I'm piglet  
Oh that's the ticket, I hope you are more like Anita Baker than Robin Givens  
No, I don't know that lady so let me quit it  
I'm just style freein', freestylin' with y'all seldom do  
This is what I'm telling you  
To the bed I'm nailing you  
Like I've been in jail for two  
Years and then they let me loose  
  
Give me the green light, give me just one night  
I'm ready to go right now, I'm ready to go right now  
We can go all night, give me the green light  
I'm ready to go right now, I'm ready to go right now
