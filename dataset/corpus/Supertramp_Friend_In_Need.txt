Hey buddy, I want to talk to you  
About (I got?) a friend in need, a friend indeed  
I hear you got a few friends too  
Living up the stairs, selling their wears  
And they don't care, 'cause they don't know that  
  
Oooh he's very lonely  
Oooh he's lost his one and only  
Woman that he's ever had  
He sure feels bad, can you make him glad?  
Hey mister can you help him out?  
Can you put him straight, before it gets to late  
And show what it's all about  
  
Hey mister where you got the dope?  
Which way will it be, to pay the fee?  
I guess that you can see through me  
So I'll be straight with you, I'll tell the truth  
Friend in need is just really me
