I can walk on fire, it ain't stoppin' me  
It's just showin' me the way  
Come thunder, lightning all over me  
I'd still be on my way  
  
You can put me through loads of trouble  
But in anyway  
  
It's just the beginnin' and not the end  
No use in pretendin' cause you can't win  
It's just a beginnin', the beginnin'  
Not the end  
  
It's not a strange behavior, it's the way I am  
Nothin' puts me down  
And if a situation would get out of hand  
I'd still be back around  
  
You can put me through loads of trouble  
But never bring me down  
  
It's just the beginnin' and not the end...  
I can walk on fire, it ain't stoppin' me...  
You can put me through loads of trouble  
But in anyway  
  
It's just the beginnin'  
It's just the beginnin'  
It's just the beginnin'  
It's just the beginnin'  
  
It's just the beginnin', and not the end...
