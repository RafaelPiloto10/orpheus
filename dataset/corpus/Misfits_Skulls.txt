The corpses all hang headless and limp  
Bodies with no surprises  
And the blood drains down like devil's rain  
We'll bathe tonight  
  
I want your skulls  
I need your skulls  
I want your skulls  
I need your skulls  
  
Demon I am and face I peel  
To see your skin turned inside out, 'cause  
Gotta have you on my wall  
Gotta have you on my wall, 'cause  
  
I want your skulls  
I need your skulls  
I want your skulls  
I need your skulls  
  
Go  
Collect the heads of little girls and  
Put 'em on my wall  
Hack the heads off little girls and  
Put 'em on my wall  
  
Oh oh  
I want your skulls  
I need your skulls  
I want your skulls  
I need your skulls  
  
I want your skulls  
I need your skulls  
I want your skulls  
I need your skulls  
  
Whoa
