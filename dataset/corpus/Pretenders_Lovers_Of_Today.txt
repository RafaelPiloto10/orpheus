I tried to talk to my baby  
I said no, no, no, no baby  
Please don't cry  
No, no, no baby please  
'Cause all of the leaves come down  
Every time babies cry  
All of the leaves come down  
  
I put my arms around my baby  
I said hush, hush, hush, hush  
Baby sleep tight now  
Hush, hush, hush baby, sleep  
'Cause all of the birds start to sing  
Every time babies dream  
All of the birds start to sing  
  
Nobody wants to see  
Lovers of today happy  
So assumed they're going to part  
Nobody wants to be with someone  
So afraid they'll be left with  
A broken heart  
  
I kissed the eyes of my baby  
I said dream, dream, dream, dream  
Baby all night long  
Dream, dream, dream all the night  
'Cause all of the stars in the skies  
Twinkle on baby's eyes  
All of the stars in the skies  
  
I tried to talk to you baby  
No no  
No I'll never feel  
Like a man in a man's world
