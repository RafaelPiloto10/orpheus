The signs are getting clearer, clearer than you need  
The writing's on the wall, for you to see  
  
You never thought you'd ever get the taste  
You never thought that it could be this good  
Just tell me what you want and I'll find the key  
Reach out and touch it's all yours.  
  
If you hang in long enough, you'll do it  
Just hang in long enough  
  
You're down on the ground, or so you say  
You'd sell the hole in your pocket, if you could find a way  
Don't ask me how I know, you don't want to hear  
It's been a long hard road, and the end is getting near.  
  
You never thought you'd ever get the chance  
You never thought your break would come along  
If you tell me what you want, I'll find the key  
Just reach out and touch it's all yours  
  
If you hang in  
  
They always say  
The best things in life are free  
But you want to have everything  
Well you're going to have to beg if you want it all.  
  
So hang in long enough, you'll do it  
Hang in long enough  
  
They'll let you out, then pull you in  
Playing hell with your emotions,  
You'll feel like giving in.  
  
So just hang in long enough
