You know I've been so lonely, every night  
Since you went away  
Would you let me down, any night  
Is that the way you're made girl  
  
I keep telling myself it's all right  
Even though I cry  
There's no question why  
How could I be happy when  
  
[Chorus: ]  
My arms keep missing you  
Who's been kissing you  
Since you went away  
My arms keep missing you  
I keep wishing you'd  
Come back today  
  
You said you wouldn't hurt me anyway  
And I believe in you  
We said we trust each other every day  
We'd never be untrue  
  
But I keep thinking you're telling lies  
Even though I try  
There's no question why  
How can I be happy when  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
You know I've been so lonely, every night  
Since you went away  
Would you let me down, any night  
Is that the way you're made girl  
  
I keep telling myself it's all right  
Even though I cry  
There's no question why  
How could I be happy when  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2x]
