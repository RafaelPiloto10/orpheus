Prepare for battle, wait for the time to arrive.  
Unleashing the fury, a gift to me and my kind.  
Suffer little damage, only the strong will survive!!!  
The gift we are given will carry us through the fight.  
  
These are the days of thunder and rage,  
We cry our battle hail...  
The time has come! We take the stage!  
Unleash! The beast within...  
  
Attack!!!  
  
Unleash the weak, lay down by my side.  
To my own memories, a warrior end is mine.  
Accepting the challenge, destroy those who stand in our way!  
Reaction to late, haha! Now you'll pay!  
  
Unleash the beast.  
  
? The gates of hell have opened for you.  
? Forever? The kingdom of?  
Ashes to ashes? The enemies that hide in the night.  
The time has come for you to run, long live the beast tonight.  
  
Divide and conquer, the roar of the crowd fills the air.  
Raise high your hands, a claim to the battle we share.  
Ememy soldiers, they run, try to hide from my sight!  
? The weapons to carry us through the fight.  
To carry us through the fight.
