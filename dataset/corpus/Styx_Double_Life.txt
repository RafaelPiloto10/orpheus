In the dark so all alone  
Slowly reach for the telephone  
A message waits just for you  
A secret place, another rendezvous  
  
It's not always honesty  
That is the best policy  
But little lies can give you away  
Though you'll deny it if they say maybe you're just  
  
Leading a double life  
Friends in the daytime, strangers at night  
Leading a double life  
Can it be wrong when you know that it's right?  
  
The other side of the Berlin Wall is  
Not far enough to avoid the call  
Somebody knows, somebody's seen  
Somebody knows right where you've been  
And that you're just  
  
Leading a double life  
Friends in the daytime, strangers at night  
Leading a double life  
Can it be wrong when you know that it's right?  
  
Nowhere to hide, though we both might try  
I'm schizophrenic, and so am I  
Double life, a double life, a masquerade  
You know we all live a masquerade  
I know you're out there!  
  
Leading a double life  
Friends in the daytime, strangers at night  
Leading a double life  
Can it be wrong when you know that it's right?
