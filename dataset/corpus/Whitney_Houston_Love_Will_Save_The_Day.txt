Forget this fear and frustration  
Love will always play the greater part  
When you battles wear you down  
Here's my advice  
  
When you're feeling down and out  
And you're got troubles on your mind  
Love will save the day  
When you're feeling full of doubt  
And fear has got you in a bind  
Love will save the day  
  
When your world's falling apart  
All you got to do is say a prayer  
And love will save the day  
There's answer in your heart  
So let your light shines, my dear  
And love will save the day  
Love will save the day

Many things in this world bring you down  
It's a wonder you can make it through the day  
Well you can't sleep cause your problems are too deep  
And there's always something getting the way

Mass confusion is the only thing you'll see  
Well there's no question  
That we need a new direction cause  
We all could use dome peace and harmony
