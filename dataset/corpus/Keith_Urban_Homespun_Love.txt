You spun your web back a Sunday or two  
I ain't never met nobody  
Like the likes of you  
You got me preachin' the news  
You turned down my road and decided to stay  
And I took a shine to your hair  
And your hillbillly ways  
And how you kiss on my face  
I got a bone deep feelin'  
You're the start of the good ole days  
  
[Chorus]  
Well I still remember  
You came by my trailer  
With chicken and some homemade wine  
The dogs got to barkin'  
When we got the sparkin'  
We almost set the house on fire  
Well I got a big heapin' helpin'  
Of the stuff I get a hankerin' for  
But honey your homespun love  
Just keeps me comin' back for more  
  
I like the flamingos you stuck in your yard  
And I like the notions you stick in my head and my heart  
Yeah and how you fix on my car  
Well I reckon I'm lucky you're everything I need so far  
  
[Chorus]
