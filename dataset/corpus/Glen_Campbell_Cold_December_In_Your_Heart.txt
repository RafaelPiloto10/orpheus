A touch of April in your smile July and Agust in your yellow hair  
A sweet September in your eyes November notions in the clothes you wear  
You're every season's work of art but there's a cold December in your heart  
It seemed to me the day we met that all the flowers had begun to bloom  
I thought you'd help me to forget the dusty shadows of my lonely room  
I should have known right from the start about the cold December in your heart  
  
I loved you more and more each day through every season of the year  
Your lovin' laughter seemed to say your life was empty when I wasn't near  
Old love would lead you to the grave I was a fool to think you loved my too  
You always took but you never gave until you've taken all my love for you  
I feel a chill I must depart and leave the cold December in your heart  
In your heart in your heart
