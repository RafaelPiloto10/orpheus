I could be jealous and grasping with greed  
I could pretend that I want something I don't need  
These are the things that go through my head  
But then, I could be an angel disguised as a man  
I could be the sun that shines in the midnight land  
If you would only stand in my corner  
Give that advantage to me  
Don't you feel something?  
You know what I'm thinking but  
I can't set it free  
We must  
Play this game, take the prize  
But not before you realize  
That win or lose, it's all the same  
Then maybe we can play this game  
I can't remember the reason I'm here  
Sometimes it seems like it's all out of habit or fear  
Sometimes I wish I could just go to sleep  
But then, I'll have a dream with a beautiful end  
I'll wake up and feel alive, then I'm off again  
If I could only keep your connection  
Give me whatever remains  
Then I might win you total liberation  
But I can't break these chains  
We must  
Play this game  
Let's pretend that we could never reach the end  
For it would be a crying shame  
If we can't learn to play this game  
Stand in my corner  
Give that advantage to me  
Stand in my corner  
Pull down a message with me  
The answer that evades our brains  
We only think we're wearing chains
