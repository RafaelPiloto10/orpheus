You can call it anything you want  
But a rose is a rose and a thorn is a thorn  
Tell me white is black and black is white  
You can say anything but that don't make it right  
You can tell me that the world is flat  
If I didn't know any better, I might go for that  
And the sky is falling on my head  
I believe the sky is falling on my head  
I've been such a fool  
Don't you agree?  
I let you call all my shots for me  
Don't you know how it feels  
When you've got high ideals?  
  
Call it what you will, don't call it love  
Call it what you will, don't call it love  
Call it what you will, don't call it love  
Call it what you will, don't call it love, not in front of me  
  
I think I'm old enough  
I can handle myself when the going gets tough  
You don't have to hide it anymore  
Why bother sparing me now when you didn't before?  
You can save that line for someone else  
That's your own can of beans and I swear I won't tell  
Now is the sky is falling on my head  
I believe the sky is falling on my head  
I've been such a fool  
But don't cry for me  
You are the one who needs sympathy  
Tell me how many times  
Can you play the same line?  
  
Now the sky is falling on your head  
Look out baby, now the sky is falling on your head  
Yes the sky is falling on your head  
I believe the sky is falling on your head  
You've been such a fool  
Now can't you see?  
You lost your best opportunity  
You passed up a prize  
For some pie in the sky
