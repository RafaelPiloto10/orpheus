Irving berlin  
How can I tell you what is in my heart?  
How can I measure each and every part?  
How can I tell you how much I love you?  
How can I measure just how much I do?  
How much do I love you?  
I'll tell you no lie  
How deep is the ocean?  
How high is the sky?  
How many times a day do I think of you?  
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?  
How far would I travel  
To be where you are?  
How far is the journey  
From here to a star?  
And if I ever lost you  
How much would I cry?  
How deep is the ocean?  
How high is the sky?
