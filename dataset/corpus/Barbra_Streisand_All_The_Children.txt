They tell us lies, they try to tell us who we are  
But we have grown  
And we remember in the future not to cry  
You could be an angel  
Look in your ancient eyes  
  
What do you see?  
Knowing what the power of your future could be  
To fall and then to rise  
It's knowing how it was  
And how that sets you free  
  
All the children will send out love to everyone  
All the children will dance and sing for you  
Through the rhythm of ages, blinded in the sun  
All the children will dance and sing for you  
  
So let them talk  
They won't be hiding any secrets from the eyes of a child  
Things can never be but what they are to you  
You could be an angel  
Make all your dreams come true  
  
All the children will send out love to everyone  
All the children will dance and sing for you  
Through the rhythm of ages, blinded in the sun  
All the children will dance and sing for you  
  
Stand up, freedom is for everyone to know  
Tell them what your truth is when you play  
Stand up, freedom is the message in your song  
In the light of what is swept away  
There's someone there to catch you when you fall  
  
All the children will send out love to everyone  
All the children will dance and sing for you  
(High above)  
  
Through the rhythm of ages  
(See how they run)  
Blinded in the sun  
(Got to be sure)  
All the children will dance  
(Watch how they shine)  
And sing for you  
(This is love)  
  
All the children will send out  
(Just like before)  
Love to everyone  
(This is the place)  
All the children will dance  
(This is the time)  
And sing for you  
(High above)  
  
Through the rhythm of ages  
(See how they run)  
Blinded in the sun  
(Got to be sure)  
All the children will dance  
(Watch how they shine)  
And sing for you  
(This is love)  
  
All the children will send out  
(Just like before)  
Love to everyone  
(This is the place)  
All the children will dance  
(This is the time)  
And sing for you  
(High above)  
  
Through the rhythm of ages  
(See how they run)  
Blinded in the sun  
(Got to be sure)  
All the children will dance  
(Watch how they shine)  
And sing for you  
  
High above, high above, this is love  
High above, this is love, high above, this is love
