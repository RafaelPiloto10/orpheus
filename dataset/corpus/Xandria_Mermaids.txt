Sigh - for they make you feel alive  
Try - it's just one step aside  
Fly - over seas of drunken wine  
Lie - cause you'll never draw a line  
come and be a child of the blue  
We'll make the azure dream come true  
cry - for they leave you cold and dead  
Ride - til the last of suns is set  
don't dive too deep - too deep into the sea  
come and be a child of the blue  
We'll make the azure dream come true  
I drift and fall - sapphire spear inside  
They come for me and softly close my eyes  
fight - for this is your last chance  
come and be a child of the blue  
Leave the past, we make it new  
you will always be our child  
(child of the blue)  
You will always be our child  
(child of the blue)
