Something in your smile was so inviting  
Something in your eyes told me to stay  
Something in your touch electrified me  
Completing me in every single way  
  
Now I realize as I look in your eyes  
This must be love  
Baby try to understand my heart is in your hand  
  
Love will set you free  
Love will set you free  
You can trust in me  
My love will set you free  
Set you free  
  
Every time I think about you baby  
Every time I see your smiling face  
Every time I feel your loving arms  
Around me guilty pleasures  
Take up all my time and space  
  
Now I realize as I look in your eyes  
This must be love  
Baby try to understand my heart is in your hand  
  
Love will set you free  
Love will set you free  
You can trust in me  
My love will set you free  
Set you free  
Set you free, set you free  
  
Now I realize as I look in your eyes  
This must be love  
Baby try to understand my heart is in your hand  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Love will set you free  
Love will set you free  
You can trust in me  
My love will set you free  
Set you free  
  
Set you free
