Knocked out of my breath  
Since I fell for you  
Now I've come down  
With the heartbreak blues  
It's gonna take a doctor  
Witha special degree  
I need a love doctor  
I need a love M.D.  
  
I've been sick ya'll  
I've been sick ya'll  
Bedridden  
Bedridden  
  
I need a prescription  
Just right for me  
A lot of bed rest  
And some company  
A whole lot of hugs  
A little sympathy  
I need a love doctor  
I need a love M.D.  
  
I've been sick ya'll  
A love M.D.
