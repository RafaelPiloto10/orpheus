Don't raise your voice to me  
And don't be unkind  
I'm just a foolish man  
Who doesn't know his mind  
There is a reason  
I don't love you like I should  
And it's you  
Yes, it's you  
Oh it's you  
  
Try understanding  
I'm a simple man at heart  
The way you carry on  
I think we'll drift apart  
I can't afford to live  
The way you want us to  
So, it's you  
Yes, it's you  
Oh, it's you  
  
Why can't I love you  
Why can't I love you  
Cause I'm not the kind of man you are looking for  
  
If everything is wrong  
We'll go our separate way  
You'll have to find a man  
Who does just what you say  
To break up is a shame  
It spoils the chance we had  
But it's you  
Yes, it's you  
Oh, it's you  
  
Why can't I love you  
Why can't I love you  
Cause I'm not the kind of man you are looking for  
  
If everything is wrong  
We'll go our separate way  
You'll have to find a man  
Who does just what you say  
To break up is a shame  
It spoils the chance we had  
But it's you  
Yes, it's you  
Oh, it's you
