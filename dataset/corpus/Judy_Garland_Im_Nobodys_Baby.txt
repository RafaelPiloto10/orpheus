I'm nobody's baby  
I wonder why  
Each night and day I pray the Lord up above  
Please send me down somebody to love  
  
But nobody wants me  
I'm blue somehow  
Won't someone hear my plea and take a chance with me  
Because I'm nobody's baby now  
  
Nobody's baby  
And I've got to know the reason why  
Last week I was walking down the street and met a boy and I said  
"Hey! Maybe I was meant for you"  
But he only shook his head and said "Goodbye"  
He kept on walking down the avenue  
  
Nobody wants me  
I'm mighty blue somehow  
Won't someone hear my plea and take a chance with me  
Because I'm nobody's baby now
