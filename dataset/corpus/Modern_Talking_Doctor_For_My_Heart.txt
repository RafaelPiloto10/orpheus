Babe, how can you mend a broken heart?  
Oh, you're tearing me apart  
Thousand drums play in my mind  
Take, it off him put it on me  
Oh, I'm feeling so lonely  
And I'm holding back my tears  
  
I don't want to a doctor for my heart  
Oh, I want to try a brand new start  
I don't want to a doctor for my heart  
Oh, I want to a commander of my love  
  
I don't want to a doctor for my lonely heartache  
My heart bleeds love me lady  
Come, take a chance on love  
  
I can give you anything but love  
Take this chains from your heart  
Thousand drums are playing my mind  
Babe, harder I try, bluer I get  
Don't put my love in a dirty bag  
Until then there's no end
