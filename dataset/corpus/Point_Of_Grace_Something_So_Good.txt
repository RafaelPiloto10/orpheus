We've got something so good  
We're gonna show you  
It makes me happy  
Always makes me feel free  
When I'm in His hands  
Do you understand  
Not trying to sell you  
I'm only trying to tell you  
That His love is for real  
It's there for you to feel  
There is no reason to run from the One  
Who can free you oh yeah  
  
[Chorus:]  
We've got something so good  
We're gonna show you  
Stand in His light you'll see  
It's gonna shine through  
  
Open you heart it's real  
And waiting for you  
We've got something so good  
All through the highs and lows  
The only thing you need to know  
Is that Jesus will be true  
He's there to comfort you  
You're not the only one  
Who feels like everything you've done  
Is measured in pain  
Come in from the rain  
There's no reason to run from the One  
Who can free you oh yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
A love we can give  
A love we can share  
A love that is more than money can buy  
I believe  
That He'll  
Set you free
