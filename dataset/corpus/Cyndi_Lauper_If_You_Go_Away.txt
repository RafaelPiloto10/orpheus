If you go away  
On this summer day  
Then you might as well  
Take the sun away  
All the birds that flew  
  
In the summer sky  
And our love was new  
And our hearts were high  
When the day was young  
  
And the night was long  
And the moon stood still  
For the night bird song  
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away  
  
But if you stay  
I'll make you a day  
Like no day has ever been  
Or will be again  
  
We'll sail on the sun  
We'll ride on the rain  
We'll talk to the trees  
And worship the wind  
  
And if you go  
I'll understand  
Leave me just enough love  
To hold in my hand  
  
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away  
If you go away  
As I know you will  
You must tell the world to stop turning  
  
Till you return to me  
If you ever do,  
Oh what good is love without loving you?  
I can tell you now, as you turn to go  
  
I'll be dying slowly  
Till your next hello  
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away,  
But if you stay  
  
I'll make you a night  
Like no night has ever been  
Or will be again  
I'll sail on you smile  
  
I'll ride on your touch  
I'll talk to your eyes  
That I love so much  
But if you go  
  
I'll understand  
Leave me just enough love  
To hold in my hand  
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away, if you go away  
  
If you go away, as I know you must  
There is nothing left in this world to trust  
Just an empty room, full of empty space  
Like the empty look I see on your face  
I'd have been the shadow of your shadow  
If you might have kept me by your side  
If you go away, if you go away, if you go away.
