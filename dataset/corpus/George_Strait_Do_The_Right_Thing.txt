Once you told me you were gonna love me  
That it was meant to be and there's no other way  
Then came someone showed you more fun  
We've had a good run better think it over  
  
Do the right thing baby do the right thing  
Go with your heart and do the right thing  
  
He's got a good line, shows you a good time  
Did he change your mind guess it's your move  
I'll lose my pride I'd even step aside  
Honey you really must decide who's best for you  
  
Do the right thing baby do the right thing  
Go with your heart and do the right thing  
Do the right thing baby do the right thing  
Go with your heart and do the right thing  
  
You might chose me or chose to lose me  
Someday you'll see the good thing you had  
  
Do the right thing baby do the right thing  
Go with your heart and do the right thing  
Do the right thing baby do the right thing  
Go with your heart and do the right thing  
Go with your heart and do the right thing
