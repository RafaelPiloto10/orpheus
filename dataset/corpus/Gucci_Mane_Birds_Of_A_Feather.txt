Two times, it's gucci, Two times  
Zugi Zugi  
Burr burr burr burr, burr burr burr burr, yeaaa  
  
It's two times gucci  
And I don't give excuses  
I use to drive a hooptie, but now my life a movie  
A genius like Confucius, but please do not confuse me  
Don't think cuz I do music, I won't pull up with Uzi  
They want me just like Tookie, But Gucci Mane survive  
Don't ask me nuthin stupid, they bury me alive  
Right now I'm on that new shit, my struggle I embrace it  
Forever live in diamonds, like ancient kings in Asia  
Big ballin is my major, I still got my lil trap house  
A condo flip a Florida, I'm ballin on you stakehouse  
I'm in and out the trap house, but this ain't what you wanted  
I put my shooters on ya, you think your house was haunted, Fool  
Pounds in the bathtub, keys on the dresser  
My money in a great place that I can never tell ya  
A cinderella story call me Cinder-fella  
I make it rain so much the strippers gotta bring umbrellas  
I double spike the punch, Skip breakfast and lunch  
I sell a thang, and whip a plain, and eat some captain crunch  
I smoke a blunt then go to brunch, and babe I don't do dutch  
I let ha order what she wants, order what you must, it's Gucci  
  
A they don't think I would be back I told them wait and watch  
All you waiting watching kick back and factor this  
O maker ain't no coming after this  
We the realist niggas coming from Atlanta streets  
Yall thought Atlanta rap was all novelty, Where you was at?  
I was sit N trenches trying to escape the poverty  
Probably out sellin sacs, Or what?  
Or probably trying figure out where the fk you and your sacs... At  
And way before I was sellin sacs, What?  
5th avenue, what were you doing?  
I was on the avenue pitching quarters, taking orders  
But now nigga the consumer, I'm a Zone 4 nigga I hit the yams up in my pum's  
These nigga grew up with a silver spoon, I had to dust the vault  
Had to learn to wiggle up had to get it up  
Nigga playing cards in the hood, but I ain't playing  
Hell I'll throw in ya hands if I had yall hands  
Got niggas that will cut off their hands just to have my hands  
I'm that nigga now, look at you, you doop dealin  
100 percent legitimate yea, I'm doop dealing  
My name O weight, I carry my own weight
