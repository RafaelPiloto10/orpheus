(A Hard hard hard)  
  
I'm looking for hard headed woman  
One who'll take me for myself  
And if I find my hard headed woman  
I won't need nobody else, no no no!  
  
I'm looking for hard headed woman (headed woman)  
One who'll make me do my best  
And if I find my hard headed woman  
I know the rest of my life will be blessed yes (yes) yes yes  
  
I know a lot of fancy dancers  
People who can glide you on the floor  
They move so smooth but have no answers (Ooo oooo oo oo)  
When you ask them - What you come here for?  
I don't know - Why?  
  
(Head headed woman)  
  
I know! Many fine feathered friends  
But their friendliness depends on how you do  
They know!  
Many sure fired ways  
to find out the one who pays  
and how you do  
  
I'm looking for hard headed woman (headed woman)  
One who will make me fell so goo-oo-oood  
And if I find my hard headed woman  
I know my life will be as it should yes yes yes  
  
I'm looking for hard headed woman (headed woman)  
One who'll make me do my best  
And if I find my hard headed woman...
