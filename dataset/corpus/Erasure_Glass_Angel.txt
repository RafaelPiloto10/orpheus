Come on angel  
You're in danger  
Give me a sign now  
Show me the way  
We gotta do it now  
Oh we gotta do it now  
  
Come on angel  
Times are strange  
And I need a life  
And you are the one  
Who can show me how  
We gotta do it now  
  
Ooh and the light that you're sending me down  
In the name of falling shadow-land  
Our love is real  
And ooh, when you're deep inside  
You can persuade me love  
Our love is real  
Hold me now  
  
Come on angel  
You're in danger  
Give me a sign now  
Show me the way  
We gotta do it now  
Oh we gotta do it now  
  
Ooh by the time that you're landing alone  
And you're losing control where you lay your love  
You lay your love  
And ooh, when you're deep inside  
You can persuade me love  
Show me how  
Show me how  
Show me how  
  
We gotta reach for the stars  
We gotta reach for the love  
We gotta reach for it all  
We gotta reach  
  
Ooh and the light that you're sending me down  
In the name of falling shadow-land  
Our love is real  
And ooh, when you're deep inside  
You can persuade me love  
Show my how  
Hold me now  
Hold me now  
We gotta do it now oh
