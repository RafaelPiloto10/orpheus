June was the lobster shell,  
I dug by hand, a haven that hid me well,  
Beneath the sand,  
The white windy waves washed in,  
But I stayed dry,  
The great breakers broke again,  
'Cause I'm on and off inside.  
And then, when the empress run aground,  
And my eyes turned blue and green,  
I heard a gorgeous sound,  
And that's when it became a dream,  
When the sky fell in,  
When the hurricanes came for me,  
I could finally crash again,  
And that's how I became the sea.  
I wrenched the engines off,  
And dragged them down,  
The depths turned the iron soft,  
As they swiftly drowned,  
And I brought the ocean side,  
To its rusty knees,  
  
As I felt the even tide,  
Deep in my shallow dreams.  
And then, when the empress run aground,  
And my eyes turned blue and green,  
I heard a gorgeous sound,  
And that's when it became a dream,  
When the sky fell in,  
When the hurricanes came for me,  
I could finally crash again,  
And that's how I became the sea.  
(When the sky fell in),  
When the sky fell in,  
(When the sky fell in),  
When the hurricanes came for me,  
I could finally crash again,  
And that's how I became the sea,  
That's how I became the sea,  
That's how I became the sea
