Some say you're just a good man  
Some say you are kind  
Some say you are in the grave  
But I say you're alive  
  
Some say you're just a prophet  
Some say you were wise  
Some say you were just a man  
But I say you are God, you are my God  
  
I will shout your fame to all the earth  
I will lift your name on high  
And the world will know your greatness  
You are my God  
I will shout your fame  
  
I know you're the Messiah  
You gave your life for me  
I know you're the only way  
Jesus you are God, you are my God  
  
I will shout your fame to all the earth  
I will lift your name on high  
And the world will know your greatness  
You are my God  
Jesus I will shout your fame to all the earth  
I will lift your name on high  
I will show the world your goodness  
As I live a life that shouts your fame (X2)  
  
Jesus I decide to live, live a life that shouts your fame (X4)  
(Shout your fame)
