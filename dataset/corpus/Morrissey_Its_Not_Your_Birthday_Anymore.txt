Your voice it might say "no"  
But the heart has a will of its own  
Your voice it might say "no"  
But the heart has a heart of its own  
It's not your birthday anymore  
There's no need to be kind to you  
And the will to see you smile and belong has now gone  
It's not your birthday anymore  
Did you really think we meant  
All those syrupy, sentimental things  
That we said?  
  
It cannot be given  
And so it must be taken  
It cannot be given  
And so it must be taken  
  
All of the gifts that they gave can't compare in any way  
To the love I am now giving to you  
Right here, right now on the floor  
All of the gifts that they gave can't compare in any way  
To the love I am now giving to you  
Right here, right now on the floor  
  
It's not your birthday anymore  
There's no need to be kind to you  
And the will to see you smile and belong has now gone  
It's not your birthday anymore  
Did you really think we meant  
All those syrupy, sentimental things  
That we said yesterday?
