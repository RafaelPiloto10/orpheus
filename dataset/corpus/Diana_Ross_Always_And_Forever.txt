Always and forever  
Each moment with you  
Is just like a dream to me  
That somehow came true  
  
And I know tomorrow  
Will still be the same  
'Cause we got a life of love  
That won't ever change and  
  
Every day love me your own special way  
Melt all my heart away with a smile  
Take time to tell me you really care  
And we'll share tomorrow together  
I'll always love you forever  
Forever  
  
There'll always be sunshine  
When I look at you  
It's something I can't explain  
Just the things that you do  
And if you get lonely  
Call me and take  
A second to give to me  
That magic you make and  
  
Every day love me your own special way  
Melt all my heart away with a smile  
Take time to tell me you really care  
And we'll share tomorrow together  
I'll always love you forever
