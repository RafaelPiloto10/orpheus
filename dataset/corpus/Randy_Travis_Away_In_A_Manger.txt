Away in a manger, no crib for a bed  
The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head  
The stars in the sky looked down where He lay  
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay  
  
The cattle are lowing the baby, he wakes  
But little Lord Jesus, no crying he makes  
I love thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky  
And stay by my cradle, 'til morning is nigh  
  
Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay  
Close by me forever and love me I pray  
Bless all the dear children in thy tender care  
And take us to heaven to live with thee there  
And take us to heaven to live with thee there
