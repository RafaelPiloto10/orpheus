Hey now do you see me down the way  
Been watching you everyday  
In my car on your street is where I stay  
I know you better that way  
One day I'll be meeting you for real  
You'll feel bad like I feel  
  
It'll blow you away - you're gonna fall for me [Repeat: x 2]  
And the voices told me  
To blow you away - you're gonna fall for me [Repeat: x 2]  
  
Hey now well I'm kncking on your door  
This special delivery is yours  
My infatuation it's true  
Hello, I got something for you  
  
It'll blow you away - you're gonna fall for me [Repeat: x 2]  
And the voices told me  
To blow you away - you're gonna fall for me [Repeat: x 2]  
  
If you hadn't sold me  
I'd still be away - you're right in front of me [Repeat: x 2]  
Then, I'll be on my way  
Breathing you okay  
  
Can't break from my sins  
Cannot pray [Repeat: x 2]  
  
But you can't kill a man when he's got no hope  
You can't kill a man when he's got no hope  
You can't kill a man when he's got no hope  
You can't kill a man when he's...OH GOD, HELP ME!  
  
It'll blow you away - you're gonna fall for me [Repeat: x 2]  
And the voices told me  
To blow you away - you're gonna fall for me [Repeat: x 2]  
  
If you hadn't sold me  
I'd still be away - you're right in front of me [Repeat: x 2]  
Then, I'll be on my way  
You breathe onto me
