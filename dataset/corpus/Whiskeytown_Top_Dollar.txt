Well I tried to find something  
Something to hold on to  
I thought it was you  
'Cause I'm sick and tired  
Of trying to make something  
  
Something out of nothing  
I guess that you were bluffing  
Now I think I'm losing my mind  
The pain in my heart  
  
Was it worth the price  
The pain in my heart  
Was it worth the time that I wasted on you  
You're giving me the Top Dollar blues  
  
And I gave you it all, all  
All that I could give you  
You've taken what I've given  
And thrown it all away  
  
Like it's nothing  
Never meant nothing  
Now I'm left with nothing  
What an awful price I've paid  
  
The pain in my heart  
Was it worth the price  
The pain in my heart  
Was it worth the time that I wasted on you  
  
You're giving me the Top Dollar blues  
I've bet all my money and that's how it goes  
You ran a good race  
But you lost just by a nose  
  
It's true  
Baby you're giving me the Top Dollar blues  
The Top Dollar blues  
I gave you it all, all  
  
All that I could give you  
And the Top Dollar blues  
Top Dollar blues
