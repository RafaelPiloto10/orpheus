I'm waiting for you to drown in my love  
So open your arms  
I'm waiting for you to open your arms  
And drown in this love  
I'm waiting for you to drown in my love  
So open your arms  
I'm waiting for you to open your arms  
And drown in this love  
Open your arms and let me show  
you what love can be like  
It's all tears and it will be  
'til the end of your time  
Come closer my love  
Will you let me tear your hearth apart?  
Now all holp is gone so drown in this love  
I'm waiting for you to drown in my love  
So open your arms  
I'm waiting for you to open your arms  
And drown in this love  
I'm waiting for you to drown in my love  
So open your arms  
I'm waiting for you to open your arms  
And drown in this love  
So my love your laughter is finally  
turning into tears  
And you're begging for more though  
the end is getting near  
come closer my love  
I'll violate you in the most sensual way...  
until you drown in this love  
I'm waiting for you to drown in my love  
So open your arms  
I'm waiting for you to open your arms  
And drown in this love  
I'm waiting for you to drown in my love  
So open your arms  
I'm waiting for you to open your arms  
And drown in this love
