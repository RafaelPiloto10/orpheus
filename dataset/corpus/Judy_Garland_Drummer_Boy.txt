There's a boy down on our street  
Plays the drums with such a beat  
You cannot control your feet  
When you hear the drummer boy!  
  
In the morning when you wake  
You can hear him take a break  
Soon the whole street starts to shake  
When you hear they hear the drummer boy!  
  
Bing bang, ding dang  
He's so nimble on the symbol  
Bing bong, ding dong  
When he plays 'em he just slays 'em!  
  
All your troubles fly away  
Every day's a happy day  
Everything will be OK  
When you hear the drummer boy play!  
  
Gather round, all you chums  
Watch this cat, spin those drums  
Swing it Brother, beat that hyde!  
Take that song and jive it right!  
  
This is what the Doc prescribes,  
For a case of jibs and jives  
Drummer boy please give out on those vibes  
Hear that, drummer boy play!
