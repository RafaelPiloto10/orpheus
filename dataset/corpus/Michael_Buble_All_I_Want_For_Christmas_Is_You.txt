I don't want a lot for Christmas  
There's just one thing I need  
I don't care about those presents  
Underneath the Christmas tree  
I just want you for my own  
More than you could ever know  
Make my wish come true  
You know that all I want for Christmas is you  
  
I wont ask for much this Christmas  
I won't even wish for snow  
No I'm just gonna keep on waiting  
Underneath the mistletoe  
  
There's no sense in hanging stocking  
There upon the fireplace  
Santa Claus he won't make me happy  
With a toy on Christmas day  
I just want you here tonight  
Holding on to me so tight  
Girl what can I do  
You know that all I want for Christmas is you  
  
And all the lights are shining  
So brightly everywhere  
And the sound of children's  
Laughter fills the air  
And everyone is singing  
I can hear those sleigh bells ringing  
Santa won't you bring me the one I really love  
Won't you please bring my baby to me  
  
I don't want a lot for Christmas  
This is all I'm asking for  
No I just want to see my baby  
Standing right outside my door  
I just want him for my own  
More than you could ever know  
Make my wish come true  
You know that all I want for Christmas  
Is you  
Is you
