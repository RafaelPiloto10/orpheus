Never look back but now never lose sight  
Of your past, oh no  
Change every moment knowing your decisions  
They just won't last, oh no  
  
Well it's different this time around  
I won't look back 'cause i found  
That gone are the days  
Long are the nights  
It feels right turning this time around  
  
Always the danger of falling into  
A mindless shell, oh yeah  
Come out of your shell don't fall into a trap  
You can't get out (can't get out, can't get out)  
  
Well it's different this time around  
I won't look back 'cause i found  
That gone are the days  
Long cold nights  
It feels like turning this time around  
  
When it hurts that bad  
You know my temperature rises  
It never goes down  
It's goin' up  
Straight up  
  
When it hurts that bad  
You know my temperature rises  
It never goes down  
It's goin' up  
Straight up, straight up  
  
Gone are the days  
Long are the nights  
It feels right turning this time around, oh yeah  
  
It's different this time around  
I won't look back 'cause i found  
That gone are the days  
Long are nights  
It feels right turning this time around
