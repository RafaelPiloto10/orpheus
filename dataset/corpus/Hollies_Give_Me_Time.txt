Back off baby  
Don't lean too hard  
I'll come 'round when I'm ready  
I ain't finished my playing 'round  
Don't want to go steady  
You gotta give me time  
Give me time give me time  
You gotta give me time  
Give me time give me time  
The feeling in me ain't the same as yours  
I'm still first-class flying  
You've gotta wait till I reach the ground  
No need to be lying  
chorus  
to think it over  
Don't try so hard  
Don't spoil your chance  
Don't try so hard  
Don't spoil your chance  
verse 1  
chorus  
To think it over  
Give me time  
Give me time give me time  
You gotta give time  
Give me time give me time  
(repeat)
