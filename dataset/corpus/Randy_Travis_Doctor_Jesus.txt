You know, I've got so many problems  
And lately, I've been feelin' kinda down  
I hear you're the one I should talk to  
I hear you're the best healer around  
  
[Chorus:]  
Doctor Jesus, will you help me?  
Make me better, make me whole  
Doctor Jesus, Lord I need you  
To mend my heart, and save my soul  
  
There's so many out there who need you  
Do you think you could work me in?  
You see I,m in the worst of conditions  
But mostly, I just need me a friend  
  
[Chorus:]
