I woke up one early evening and I knew I was alone  
Did the sun come up or did it rain again I'll never know  
I felt the acid in my stomach rise above my throat as I dialed  
  
There was a message from my mother from about 7am said I've forgotten what you
sound like and I'm wondering how you've been  
I cried myself to sleep back on the floor unconscious in denial  
  
Life is just a little part of what the world will do  
To get it's point across it beats you 'til your black and blue  
And decides just when your in or when your out  
'Cuz when your through your through  
  
There's a cafe round the corner from the home I call a house  
I sit and play sudoku 'til I figure some shit out  
I drink the days first coffee and I smoke  
The last cigarette of my life  
  
And I'm wondering out of all the crazy places that I've been  
Would it ever be as good as sitting here just with a friend  
Where it's always understood it might be time  
To switch the coffee to the wine  
  
Life is just a little part of what the world will do  
To get it's point across it beats you 'til your black and blue  
And decides just when your in or when your out  
'Cuz when your through your through  
  
Yeah, Yeah.  
Whoaaaah, Ohhhh.  
Whoaaaaahhhhhh  
  
Ohhhh, Ohhh, Ohhh.  
Oh.  
  
Janis sings to me just like she's sitting by my side  
And I wonder just how many times she's sat like me and cried  
I've made it passed the age of 27  
So there's no use in dying  
  
And all my friends have asked the question  
"baby will you be ok"  
I wanna tell them yes 'cuz I know that's what I should say  
But I've got no crystal ball and I can't bring myself to lie and why should I?  
  
Hey, yeahhhh I think that...  
Life is just a little part of what this world will do  
It brings us to the brink and beats the shit right outta you  
And decides just when your in or when your out  
'Cuz when your through your through  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Life is just a little part of what this world will do  
It brings us to the brink and beats the shit right outta you  
And decides just when your in or when your out  
'Cuz when your through your through  
  
Ayyye, Oh.  
I guess I'm through  
Mmmmm.  
When you're through, you're through
