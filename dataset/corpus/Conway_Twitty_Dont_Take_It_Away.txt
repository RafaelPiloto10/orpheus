I been lookin' for you all night long, darlin'  
You've got to talk to me  
I wanna tell you how wrong I've been  
And I won't do it again  
  
You know that woman didn't mean a thing to me  
I hope, I don't embarrass you too much  
Here in front of all your friends  
I'm gonna get down on my knees  
  
Please, let me make it  
Please, I can give you up  
'Cause you've made love  
So good for me so long  
  
Don't take it away  
'Cause love don't come easy  
Darlin', I'm sorry  
I stepped over the line  
  
Don't take it away  
Don't make me go crazy  
'Cause I would follow you  
To the ends of my mind  
  
From now on  
I'm gonna be the kind of man  
That you can lean on  
  
And when the waters of life  
Get a little too rough or a little too deep  
I'm gonna be your steppin' stone  
  
And oh, I remember all those nights  
That you used to take right a hold of me  
And you'd hold on  
  
Please, let me make it  
Please, I can give you up  
'Cause you've made love  
So good for me so long  
  
Don't take it away  
'Cause love don't come easy  
Darlin', I'm sorry  
I stepped over the line  
  
Don't take it away  
Don't make me go crazy  
'Cause I would follow you  
To the ends of my mind
