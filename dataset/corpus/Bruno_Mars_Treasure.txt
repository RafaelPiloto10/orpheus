Give me all, give me all, give me all your attention baby  
I got to tell you a little something about yourself  
You're wonderful, flawless, oh you're a sexy lady  
But you walk around here like you wanna be someone else  
  
I know that you don't know it, but you're fine, so fine  
Oh girl I'm gonna show you when you're mine, oh mine  
  
Treasure, that is what you are  
Honey you're my golden star  
You know you can make my wish come true  
If you let me treasure you  
If you let me treasure you  
  
Pretty girl, pretty girl, pretty girl you should be smiling  
A girl like you should never live so blue  
You're everything I see in my dreams  
I wouldn't say that to you if it wasn't true  
  
I know that you don't know it, but you're fine, so fine  
Oh girl I'm gonna show you when you're mine, oh mine  
  
Treasure, that is what you are  
Honey you're my golden star  
You know you can make my wish come true  
If you let me treasure you  
If you let me treasure you  
  
You are my treasure, you are my treasure  
You are my treasure, yeah, you you you, you are  
You are my treasure, you are my treasure  
You are my treasure, yeah, you you you, you are  
  
Treasure, that is what you are  
Honey you're my golden star  
You know you can make my wish come true  
If you let me treasure you  
If you let me treasure you
