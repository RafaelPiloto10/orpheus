We wrote this song, it's not too short, not too long  
It's got back-up vocals in just the right places (in just the right places)  
It's got a few oohs and ahhs (oooh aaah)  
And it takes a little pause  
Just before I sing the F word  
  
Please play this song on the radio  
  
Almost every line is sung on time  
Almost every verse ends in a rhyme  
The only problem we had was writing enough words  
(Oooh aaah)  
But that's okay, because the chorus is  
Coming up again now  
  
Please play this song on the radio  
Please play this song on the radio  
  
Please play this song on the radio  
Please play this song on the radio  
Please play this song on the radio  
Please play this song on the radio  
Please play this song on the radio (please play this song)  
Please play this song on the radio (please play this song)  
  
Right about this time  
Some shit head will be drawin a fat fuckin' line  
Over the title on the back sleave  
What an asshole!  
So Mr. DJ I hope you've already made your segue  
Or the FCC is gonna take a shit right on your head  
  
Can't play this song on the radio (can't play this song)  
Can't play this song on the radio (can't play this song)
