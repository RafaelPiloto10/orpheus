Sit yourself down  
Bang out a tune on that grand piano  
Sit yourself down  
Lay languidly down upon that sofa  
  
Ooh, isn't it nice  
When your heart is made out of ice  
  
Ride, Sally, ride  
It's not your time or way of confusion  
Ride, Sally, ride  
'Cause if you don't, you'll get a contusion  
  
Ooh, isn't it nice  
When your heart is made out of ice  
  
Sit yourself down  
Take of your pants, don't you know this is a party  
Sit yourself down  
Why do you think we brought all these people, miss brandy  
  
Ooh, isn't it nice  
When you find your heart's made out of ice  
  
Ride, Sally, ride  
It's not your time, it's just your confusion  
Ride, Sally, ride  
It's not your time, you'll get a contusion  
  
Ooh, isn't it nice  
When you find your heart is made out of ice  
  
(Ride, sally ride)  
(Ride, ride, ride, ride, Sally ride) Ride, Sally, ride  
(Ride, ride, ride, ride, Sally ride) Hey, ride, Sally, ride  
(Ride, ride, ride, ride, Sally ride) Ride, sally, ride  
(Ride, ride, ride, ride, Sally ride, Oh-oh-oh, oh)  
(Ride, ride, ride, ride, Sally ride, Hey-hey-hey, hey-hey)
