You drive the away the best of you  
It's all that's left to say  
You leave me with the rest of you  
You've made it on your way  
I need a call to save from you  
Just before you go  
The more that I've been close with you  
The door was always closed  
-Chorus-  
Drive away, there's nothing you should say  
Drive away, but drive us anyway  
Get on up and straight you go  
There's nothing left to say  
And begging not's my place you know  
You'll never hear it anyway  
There's all the days I let you stay  
I saw it made you blind  
There's more than I can really say  
Why it is it traps you all inside  
  
[-Chorus-]  
You made it all get so uptight  
I made it in the dreams  
You went and robbed an overnight  
And they hid behind your scream  
They've hidden where I just don't know  
I think you've gone inside  
I hope the world looks good from there  
But I hope it looks alright  
We never made it all the way  
We never made it all the way  
You take the best of you  
I'll keep the rest of you  
  
[-Chorus-]
