All this time has whittled away  
Like so many days in one  
Back and forth the leaders sway  
Backing it up with guns  
  
Superpowers flex their wings  
Hold the world on puppet strings  
Egos will feed  
While citizens bleed  
  
That's always the way it goes  
When will the world listen to reason  
I've got a feeling it'll be a long time  
When will the truth come in to season  
  
I've got a feeling it'll be a long time  
All they want is what they can defend  
Before their time is up  
Make the same mistakes again  
  
Heard it all before  
Superpowers flex their wings  
Hold the world on puppet strings  
Egos will feed  
  
While citizens bleed  
That's always the way it goes  
Well if they tried  
Maybe they'd see  
  
It'd do a little good to let the world be free  
Handshake and a smile  
Gets you on through  
Then turn it all around with a suicide move  
  
But you know it's not fooling anyone but me  
You gotta make yourself see what you want to see  
  
[Chorus]
