I've got something new for you  
When it hits you wont know what to do  
Relax, let me move you  
Don't resist its in the air  
Just one taste will take you there  
Let it flow right through you  
I know you're getting tired of the same old thing  
Imma break the rules gonna change the game  
You'll be screaming my name  
And Imma take you places you never seen  
You couldn't picture this in your wildest dreams  
Don't fear you're here with me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Let's get lifted  
(lifted)  
Ohh Imma get you high  
I'm really gonna blow your mind  
We'll get lifted (lifted)  
You're gonna feel it in your soul  
And baby you will lose control  
We'll get lifted (high)  
Ohhh ohhhh  
  
Once you take a hit of this  
You wont ever wanna quit  
You'll be so addicted  
Said I'll have you spinning round and round  
Crazy, making freaky sounds  
You won't want to come down  
And I'll have you seeing things and hallucinating  
Even walking funny 'cuz your legs are shaking  
All night we'll be blazin'  
  
I'll take you for a walk to the other side  
We can get high and enjoy the ride  
Hold tight we'll be alright  
  
[Chorus:]  
We'll get lifted  
(lifted)  
Ohh Imma get you high  
I'm really gonna blow your mind  
We'll get lifted  
You're gonna feel it in your soul  
And baby you will lose control  
We'll get lifted (high)  
Ohhh ohhhh  
  
So come and go  
(so much I wanna show you I'll take you there)  
Yeah, I'll take you there  
Lemme take you there  
Said I will show you  
(so much I wanna show you I'll take u high)  
There's so much I wanna show ya  
I'll take you high...
