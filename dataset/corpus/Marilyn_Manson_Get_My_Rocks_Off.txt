Some men need some killer weed, some men need cocaine  
Some men need some cactus juice, to purify the brain  
Some men need two women, some need alcohol  
Everybody needs a little something, but Lord I need it all  
  
To get my rocks off, get my rocks off  
Get my rocks off the mountain, and roll 'em on down the hill  
  
I may do you one time, and I may do you more  
I may turn you into something, that you ain't ready for  
I might want your body, and I might want your bread  
I might want your momma to come visit me instead  
  
And get my rocks off, get my rocks off  
Get my rocks off the mountain, and roll 'em on down the hill  
  
Sometimes I dream of chicks, to bring me ever lasting joys  
Sometimes I dream of animals, sometimes I dream of boys  
Sometimes I kill the living, sometimes I raise the dead  
Sometimes I say just screw it all, and crawl back into bed  
  
And get my rocks off, get my rocks off  
Get my rocks off the mountain, and roll 'em on down the hill
