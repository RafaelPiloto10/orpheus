The lights go out and I can't be saved  
Tides that I tried to swim against  
Have brought me down upon my knees  
Oh I beg, I beg and plead, singing  
  
Come out of the things unsaid  
Shoot an apple off my head and a  
Trouble that can't be named  
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singing  
  
You are, you are  
  
Confusion that never stops  
The closing walls and the ticking clocks gonna  
Come back and take you home  
I could not stop, that you now know, singing  
  
Come out upon my seas  
Cursed missed opportunities am I  
A part of the cure  
Or am I part of the disease, singing  
  
You are, you are  
You are, you are  
You are, you are  
  
And nothing else compares  
And nothing else compares  
And nothing else compares  
  
You are, you are  
  
Home, home, where I wanted to go  
Home, home, where I wanted to go  
Home, home, where I wanted to go (You are)  
Home, home, where I wanted to go (You are)
