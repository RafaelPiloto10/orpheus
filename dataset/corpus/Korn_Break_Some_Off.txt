I am living without you  
You think everything will be fine  
I find making it hard to lie  
Realize nothing is left inside  
  
I'm about to break somebody off  
Going to lose my mind  
I'm about to break somebody off  
I feel I'm feeling fine  
I'm about to break somebody off  
No it won't be fine  
I'm about to break somebody off  
  
My lies is going to hurt you  
my fat not going to wait this time  
I play, games just to despite you  
I know, you're going to believe this time  
  
I'm About to break somebody off  
Going to lose my mind  
I'm About to break somebody off  
I feel I'm feeling fine  
I'm About to break somebody off  
No it won't be fine  
I'm About to break somebody off  
  
Feel me as I'm laughing  
Leaving, eating, fucking  
Hating all this bullshit  
Maybe I can't stand this  
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck  
I can't stand this  
  
Fuck  
I'm about to break somebody off  
Going to lose my mind  
I'm about to break somebody off  
I feel I'm feeling fine  
I'm about to break somebody off  
No it won't be fine  
I'm about to break somebody off  
Off, off, off, off
