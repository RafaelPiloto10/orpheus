Just when every ray of hope was gone  
I should have known that you would come along  
I can't believe I ever doubted you  
My old friend the blues  
  
Another lonely night, a nameless town  
If sleep don't take me first, you'll come around  
'Cause I know I can always count on you  
My old friend the blues  
  
Lovers leave and friends will let you down  
But you're the only sure thing that I've found  
No matter what I do I'll never lose  
My old friend the blues  
  
Just let me hide my weary heart in you  
My old friend the blues
