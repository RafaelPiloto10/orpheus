Motherfucker, you'd better break yourself  
  
My skin is my sin, look at my complexion  
Section 8, erection great  
Balls like Ru Paul and a big fat plank  
Get you higher than a Spike Lee joint  
See I'm a chicken hawk and I'm hunting chicken and watermelon  
It ain't nothing but hard time bailing  
Just got a misdomener  
Cause I got a deuce-five, and I'm black as Sarafina  
Get the hell out Somolia, we didn't call y'all  
I can't wait till I can kill all y'all  
Fuck Reggie Denton and Jimmy (Johnny) Cochran  
Damn I couldn't get close enough to sock him  
I plead guilty your honor  
Cause I dissed the Pope more times than Sinead O'Connor  
Huh huh, cool, like Butthead and Beavis  
Truer than the Mack but I'm downer than he is  
And that police chief named Willie  
Can take his motherfucking ass back to Philly  
Dropped a bomb on a crew named "Move"  
Years ago, here's a hoe  
That's ready to stop me, they think I'm Khadafi  
Rolling in a six-tre jalopy  
They want to give me ten in the pen cause I'm smelling like Hen  
My skin is my sin  
  
My S-K-I-N is my S-I-N (Burning our black skin)  
My S-K-I-N is my S-I-N (Burning our black skin)  
  
I Get Around like Tupac, just bought a new glock  
And I want what you got  
So please give it up so I can live it up  
Just like the rich but I still eat grits  
I don't know karate  
But I can still beat the dog shit out of Nazis  
You claim you want to put in work  
Plotting to blow up a church  
See you devils are all the same  
You'll gun down a congregation in Jesus' name  
Using me as a scapegoat, well cracker don't sleep  
Far from a goat, more like a black sheep  
Lamb of God, and it's odd  
That Allah is a man that don't need a tan  
And you can't stand when I talk like that  
And why do black men have to walk like that?  
Cause we swing low like a chariot  
And now I got Harriet all on my dick  
Cause my shoe size is much bigger than a motherfucking 10  
My skin is my sin  
  
My S-K-I-N is my S-I-N (Burning our black skin)  
My S-K-I-N is my S-I-N (Burning our black skin)  
  
Who's that janky-ass nigga with last?  
Standing like a G pissing on America's flag  
Dub C, the nigga from Westside  
Westide Maad Circle bailing with a double barrel  
Cause uh, my skin is my sin  
And all I need is knowledge of self and ammunition is my best friend  
When it's time to roll nigga, we ain't calling on Jesus  
I'm calling Mad Dog for the 9 millimeters  
Cause I give the song with those peckerwoods to the fullest  
And a bitch by the name of America's on it  
The same bitch that jacked my forefathers  
And the Indians took my motherfucking religion  
Place a holy Bible in my hand, but for what?  
Like Jim Kelly said, "You try to set me up?" Shit...  
I'm too slick for your lies in disguise  
When will you devils open your eyes and realize?  
Like Pepsi, niggas got a new generation  
And we don't want your American education  
Ain't no brain washing this way  
Fuck America, Tom Meztger, and KKK  
And to the cracker named J.B. Stoner  
Don't let me catch you on no corners  
I see you on TV talking more shit  
But just like your punk-ass ancestors, you's a bitch  
You's a bitch if I ever saw one  
Grand Wizard bring your ass on Imperial so we can get physical  
And watch God show and prove  
Not only mentally but physically the black man rules  
So run devil run, you's to best start running  
Because the niggas are coming, oh, the niggas are coming  
And ain't no way you gon' win  
Cause I come from a tribe of O.G.'s and my skin is my sin  
  
My S-K-I-N is my S-I-N "Burning our black skin"  
My S-K-I-N is my S-I-N "Burning our black skin"
