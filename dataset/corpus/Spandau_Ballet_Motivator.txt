I can make you feel so good  
Hold me by the arm  
I can take your speckles of sweetness  
And turn them into stars  
I can make your dreams so real  
Just think what we could do  
Oh I could be your messiah  
And I'll take you higher  
And maybe I won't stop till I do  
'cause I'm your motivator  
I'm behind everything you do  
Yes I'm your motivator  
If your heart is thumping  
I can give you something  
Feel me with the crack of my whip.  
I will be your inspiration  
Movin' in your soul  
I'll be your little bit of muscle  
And move and take control  
I can be just simple persuasion  
So take me as your guide  
But when your mind is cooking  
Remember who's looking  
'cause baby I'm that something inside  
'cause I'm your motivator  
I'm behind everything you do  
Yes I'm your motivator  
If your head is reeling  
Get off on this feeling  
Hold me now and shoot from the hip.  
Do do do  
You give something something I need.
