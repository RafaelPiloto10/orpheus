Prasanna vadanaaM saubhaagyadaaM bhaagyadaaM  
HastaabhyaaM abhayapradaaM maNigaNair-  
Naanaavidhair-bhuushhitaaM  
(who is of smiling face, bestower of all fortunes,  
Whose hands are ready to rescue anyone from fear,  
Who is adorned by various ornaments with precious stones)  
  
Puer natus est nobis,  
Et filius datus est nobis  
Cujus emperium super humerum  
(For to us a child is born,  
To us a son is given:  
And the government will be upon his shoulder)  
  
Some day you came  
And I knew you were the one  
You were the rain, you were the sun  
But I needed both, cause I needed you  
  
You were the one  
I was dreaming of all my life  
When it is dark you are my light  
But don't forget  
Who's always our guide  
  
It is the child in us
