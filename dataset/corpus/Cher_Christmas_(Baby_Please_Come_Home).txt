Its Christmas, baby please come home,  
Its Christmas, baby please come home,  
  
Christmas,  
The snow's coming down,  
I'm watching it fall,  
Lots of people around,  
Baby please come home.  
  
Christmas,  
The church bells in town  
Are ringing of snow,  
What a happy sound,  
Baby please come home.  
  
(chorus)  
They're singing deck the hall,  
But its not like christmas at all,  
Coz I remember when you were here  
And all the fun we had last year  
  
Christmas,  
Pretty lights on the trees  
I'm Watching them shine,  
You should be here with me,  
Baby please come home,  
Baby please come home,  
Baby please come home,  
Baby please come home.  
  
(repeat chorus)  
If there was a way,  
I'd hold back each tear,  
But its Christmas day,  
Baby please come home.  
  
(repeat chorus)  
If there was a way,  
I'd hold back each tear,  
But its Christmas day,  
Baby please come home.  
  
(repeat chorus)  
If there was a way,  
I'd hold back each tear,  
But its Christmas day,  
Baby please come home.  
  
OH baby please come home  
Baby please  
Baby please  
Baby please come home  
  
Pretty lights on the trees  
I'm watching them shine,  
You should be here with me  
Baby please come home,  
Baby please come home,  
Baby please come home,  
Baby please come home,  
Baby please come home.  
  
Christmas.
