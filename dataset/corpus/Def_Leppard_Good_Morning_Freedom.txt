Well good morning freedom  
I've been woken to a brand new day  
Good morning freedom  
Now it seems that you have a different way  
Starts today  
  
So now I'm free  
And now you're ready to take my chance again  
So come with me  
And I'll take you to the rainbow's end  
  
Oh good morning freedom  
I'd like to take you by the hand  
And if you doubt me  
Just listen to the fan  
And you'll understand  
  
So now I'm free  
And now you're ready to take my chance again  
So come with me  
And I'll take you to the rainbow's end  
  
So now I'm free  
And now you're ready to take my chance again  
So come with me
