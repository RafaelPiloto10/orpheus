Ooo when I was a small boy,  
Well, I could see the magic in a day,  
But, now I'm just a poor boy,  
Well, maybe it's the price you have to pay,  
If you lock your dreams away  
If no-one wants to listen.  
  
What's the story,  
I wish I'd been a minstrel,  
Just think of all the maidens I could call,  
Oh-I wish I'd been a gypsy,  
Then maybe I could read the crystal ball,  
Cause surrounded by these walls,  
Just makes me feel uneasy.  
  
I said hey, Sister Moonshine  
Won't you send me a little sun  
I said hey, Sister Moonshine  
Who's a stranger to everyone.  
  
So, -MAKE US ALL LAUGH-  
Make us all cry  
-MAKE US ALL GIVE-   
Make us all try  
Give us a secret, show us the light,  
Well, strike up the music, light up the sky.  
  
Mmm-If I was a lion,  
Well, I could be the king off all the plains,  
Mmm-If is was an eagle,  
Well, maybe I could fly above the rains,  
Oh, fly above the pain  
But, I know I'm only foolin'  
  
I said hey, Sister Moonshine,  
Won't you send me a little sun,  
I said hey, Sister Moonshine,  
Who's a stranger to everyone.  
  
So, -MAKE US ALL LAUGH-  
Make us all cry,  
-MAKE US ALL GIVE-   
Make us all cry,  
I said hey, Sister Moonshine  
I said hey, Sister Moonshine,  
I said hey, said hey  
I said hey, I said hey Sister Moonshine
