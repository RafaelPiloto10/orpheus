Every one of us has heard the call  
Brothers of True Metal proud and standing tall  
We know the power within us has brought us to this hall  
there's magic in the metal there's magic is us all  
  
Heavy metal or no metal at all whimps and posers leave the hall  
Heavy metal or no metal at all whimps and posers go on get out  
Leave the hall  
  
Now the world must listen to our decree  
We don't turn down for anyone we do just what we please  
got to make it louder, all men play on ten  
If you're not into metal, you are not my friend  
  
Heavy metal or no metal at all whimps and posers leave the hall  
Heavy metal or no metal at all whimps and posers I said  
Leave the hall  
  
Now the world must listen to our decree  
We don't turn down for anyone we do just what we please  
Got to make it louder, all men play on ten  
If you're not into metal, you are not my friend  
  
There's metal in the air tonite, can you hear it call  
If you ain't got the balls, to take it you can  
Leave the hall  
  
Heavy metal or no metal at all whimps and posers leave the hall  
Heavy metal or no metal at all whimps and posers leave the hall
