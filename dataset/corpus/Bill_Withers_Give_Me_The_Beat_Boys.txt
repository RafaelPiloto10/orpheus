Day after day I'm more confused  
But I look for the light through the pouring rain  
You know that's a game that I hate to lose  
Now I'm feeling the straine  
Aint it a shame?  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll  
And drift away  
Give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll  
And drift away  
  
Beginning to think that I'm wasting time  
I don't understand the things I do  
The world outside looks so unkind  
I'm counting on you  
To carry me through  
  
(Chorus)  
  
And when my mind is free you know melody can move me  
And when I'm feeling blue the guitar's coming through to soothe me  
Thanks for the joy that you've given me  
I want you to know I believe in your song  
Your rhythm and rhyme and harmony  
You've helped me along  
You're making me strong  
  
(Chorus)  
  
(Repeat chorus 2 times)  
  
Now now now won't you take me?  
Oh oh take me  
Fly high...
