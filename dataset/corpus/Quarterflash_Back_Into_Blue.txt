Here I go into blue  
You think I'd learn  
To stay away from you,  
But, baby, here I go  
Here I go, back into blue  
I can't believe what I do  
Did I really think  
That you'd come through  
Oh, baby, here I go  
Here I go, back into blue  
  
Into blue  
Here I go again  
I'm falling off the end for you  
No matter what I do  
I'm always back into blue  
  
Some people learn,some will lose  
Some people never see a single clue  
But baby, here I go  
Here I go, back into blue  
Only love makes a fool  
Out of me over you  
Oh, baby, here I go  
Here I go, back into blue  
  
Into blue  
Here I go again  
I'm falling off the end for you  
No matter what I do  
I'm always back into blue  
  
Some people learn to protect their hearts  
They say "no" when the feeling starts  
But some fools live their lives in the dark  
For you, for you, for you  
  
Yes it's true, I'm a fool  
To ever take a chance on you  
Oh, baby, here I go  
Here I go, back into blue  
Oh, baby, here I go  
Here I go, back into blue
