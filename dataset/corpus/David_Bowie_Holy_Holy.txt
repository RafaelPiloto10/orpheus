Listen baby, let me lie low, lie low with you  
To be lie-high-high-high  
High-high lie-low lie  
Slowly, it's good and holy  
Helping one another, just a righteous brother  
Lifetime, give me back my lifetime  
I don't want to be an angel, just a little bit evil  
Feel the devil in me  
  
Holy, holy  
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone  
But just let me be  
Holy, holy  
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone  
But let go of me  
  
Listen baby, let me lie low, lie low with you  
To be a lie-high-high-high  
High-high my oh my  
  
Holy, holy  
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone  
But just let me be  
Holy, holy  
Hold on to anyone, hold on to anyone  
But let go of me
