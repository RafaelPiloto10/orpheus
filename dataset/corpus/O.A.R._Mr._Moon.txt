A little boy, alone, he relies on fairytales.  
And the moon is his castle late tonight.  
Smiling down upon our war,  
It's funny when  
you're far away.  
But Mr. Moon why you laughing at me?  
  
You cannot blame us for lying to you.  
You cannot blame us for crying to you.  
Why you laughing at me, Mr. Moon?  
  
The wiser man roams the world.  
Looks back upon his days  
The moon is a wonder late tonight.  
Smiling from above our world  
It's easy when you're far away.  
But Mr. Moon why you laughing at me?  
  
You cannot blame us for lying to you.  
You cannot blame us for crying to you.  
Why you laughing at me, Mr. Moon?  
  
You don't need me.  
You don't want me.  
Leave me be while I sleep.  
  
You cannot blame us for lying to you.  
And you run away, you run away.  
Daytime.  
But, the night just brings us back together.  
You cannot blame us for crying to you no, no.  
It's time we laughed at you, Mr. Moon.
