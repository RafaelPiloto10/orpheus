Look's like it's over you knew I couldn't stay  
She's coming home today  
We had a good thing I'll miss your sweet love  
Why must you look at me that way  
  
It's over  
Sad eyes turn the other way  
I don't wanna see you cry  
Sad eyes you knew there'd come a day  
When we would have to say goodbye  
  
Try to remember the magic that we shared  
In time your broken heart will mend  
I never used you you Knew I really cared  
I hate to see it have to end  
  
But its over  
Sad eyes turn the other way  
I don't wanna see you cry  
Sad eyes you knew there'd come a day  
When we would have to say goodbye  
  
Sad eyes you knew there'd come a day  
When we would have to say goodbye  
Sad eyes turn the other way  
I don't wanna see you cry  
Sad eyes you knew there'd come a day  
When we would have to say goodbye  
Sad eyes turn the other way(fading out)
