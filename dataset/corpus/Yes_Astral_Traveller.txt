And in the ruins of the balloon  
Stood a man with glasses held high,  
Wondering when to do it again  
Have another fly into the sky,  
Somewhere flying high.  
  
Astral trav'ller leaving without her,  
Wandering where lights go,  
Leave out the body load.  
  
Once in the air, people who dare  
Get a great respect in being.  
(Astral trav'ller.)  
Heavenly flight wondrous night  
And all the sights worth seeing  
Just believe in  
  
Astral trav'ller leaving without her,  
Wandering where lights go,  
Leave out the body load.
