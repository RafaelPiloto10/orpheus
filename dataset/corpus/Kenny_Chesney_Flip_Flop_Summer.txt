Sprin's sprung, the sun's up and shinin'  
School's out, and everyone's smilin'  
Let's pop the top off, and lie for a while  
And some take it easy days.  
  
Let's tell that old grind where to stick it  
Put the rest of the stress in there with it  
Don't you think we've had enough  
It's time to get away.  
  
It's gonna be another flip flop summer  
Kick off your shoes, and call up your lover  
Say hey baby, the winter is over  
Let's head south awhile  
We're going to take us a long vacation  
Mix us up some strong libations  
No worries, just good vibrations  
And lazy days in style  
It's a flip flop summer, It's a flip flop summer.  
  
Put your coat away in the closet  
You won't need it, baby  
Because it's a clear blue sky  
And the weatherman says it looks that way for weeks  
Baby, we'll cruise down to Montigo  
Raise us a glass as we pass Puerto Rico  
It don't matter 'cause wherever we go  
Its where it's good to be.  
  
It's gonna be another flip flop summer  
Kick off your shoes, and call up your lover  
Say hey baby, the winter is over  
Let's head south awhile  
We're going to take us a long vacation  
Mix us up some strong libations  
No worries, just good vibrations  
And lazy days in style  
It's a flip flop summer, It's a flip flop summer.  
  
Let's sail away, where no problems can find us  
We've got 90 days  
To watch that ole Tequila sun rise  
And leave all our troubles behind us.  
  
It's gonna be another flip flop summer  
Kick off your shoes, and call up your lover  
Say hey baby, the winter is over  
Let's head south awhile  
We're going to take us a long vacation  
Mix us up some strong libations  
No worries, just good vibrations  
And lazy days in style  
It's a flip flop summer, It's a flip flop summer.  
  
It's a flip flop summer...
