Heaven on earth  
We need it now  
I'm sick of all of this  
Hanging around  
Sick of sorrow  
Sick of pain  
Sick of hearing again and again  
That there's gonna be  
Peace on earth  
  
Where I grew up  
There weren't many trees  
Where there was we'd tear them down  
And use them on our enemies  
They say that what you mock  
Will surely overtake you  
And you become a monster  
So the monster will not break you  
  
It's already gone too far  
Who said if you go in hard  
You won't get hurt  
  
Jesus could you take the time  
To throw a drowning man a line  
Peace on earth  
Tell the ones who hear no sound  
Whose sons are living in the ground  
Peace on earth  
No who's or whys  
No-one cries like a mother cries  
For peace on earth  
She never got to say goodbye  
To see the color in his eyes  
Now he's in the dirt  
That's peace on earth  
  
They're reading names out over the radio  
All the folks the rest of us won't get to know  
Sean and Julia, Gareth, Ann and Brenda  
Their lives are bigger, than any big idea  
  
Jesus could you take the time  
To throw a drowning man a line  
Peace on earth  
Tell the ones who hear no sound  
Whose sons are living in the ground  
Peace on earth  
  
Jesus this song you wrote  
The words are sticking in my throat  
Peace on earth  
Hear it every Christmas time  
But hope and history won't rhyme  
So what's it worth?  
This peace on earth  
  
Peace on earth  
Peace on earth  
Peace on earth
