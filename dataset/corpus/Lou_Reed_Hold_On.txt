There's blacks with knives and whites with guns  
fighting in Howard Beach  
There's no such thing as human rights  
when you walk the N.Y. streets  
A cop was shot in the head by a 10 year old kid named Buddah in  
Central Park last week  
The fathers are lined up by  
the coffins by the Statue of Bigotry  
You better hold on something's happening here  
You better hold on---meet you in Tompkins Square  
The dopers sent a message to the cops last weekend  
They shot him in the car where he sat  
And Eleanor Bumpres and Michael Stewart must have appreciated that  
There's a rampaging rage rising up like a plague of bloody vials  
washing up on the beach  
It'll take more than the Angels or Iron Mike Tyson  
to heal this bloody breach  
A junkie ran down a lady a pregnant dancer  
she'll never dance but the baby was saved  
He shot up some China White and nodded out at the wheel  
and he doesn't even remember a thing  
They shot that old lady  
'cause they thought she was a witness  
to a crime she didn't even see  
Whose home is the home of the brave by the Statue of Bigotry  
You got a black .38 and a gravity knife  
You still have to ride the train  
There's the smelly essence of N.Y. down there  
but you ain't no Bernard Goetz  
There's no Mafia lawyer  
to fight in your corner  
for that 15 minutes of fame  
The have and the have nots are bleeding in the tub  
That's New York's future not mine  
Oh you better hold on---something's happening here.
