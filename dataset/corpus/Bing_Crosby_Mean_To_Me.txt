You're mean to me  
Why must you be mean to me  
Dear, honey, it seems to me  
You like to see me cryin'  
  
I don't know why I stay home each night  
When you say you'll phone, you don't  
And I'm left alone singing the blues inside  
  
You treat me coldly  
Each day in a year  
You always call me  
Whenever somebody is near  
  
Dear, it must be great fun  
To be mean to me  
You shouldn't, for can't you see  
What you mean to me  
  
You treat me coldly  
Each day in a year  
You always call me  
Whenever somebody is near  
  
Dear, it must be great fun  
To be mean to me  
You shouldn't, for can't you see  
What you mean to me
