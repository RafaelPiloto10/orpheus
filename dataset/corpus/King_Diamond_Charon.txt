Welcome My Friend, My Name Is Charon  
Please Take My Hand, I Know The Secret Land  
  
Don't Be Afraid... Oh No  
I'm Faceless But Don't Fear Now  
I'll Take You Safe Across The River Styx  
  
Waste No Time, Soon The Night Will Break Away  
That Boy Can Wait, There's Only Room For One  
  
Don't Be Afraid...Oh No  
I'm Faceless But Don't Fear Now  
I'll Take You Safe Across The River Styx  
  
I Am Your Death  
We Must Leave Now, My Boat Is Waiting  
On The Other Shore Is The Land Of The Dead  
  
Don't Be Afraid... Oh No  
I'm Faceless But Don't Fear Now  
I'll Take You Safe Across The River Styx
