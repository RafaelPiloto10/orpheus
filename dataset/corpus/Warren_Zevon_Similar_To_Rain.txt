Once upon a time these stories always start  
There lived a handsome prince and he had a happy heart  
And a princess, too--she was a beautiful kid  
She said she'd never leave him but she did  
Sometimes love is wet and cold  
Similar to rain, just a hard to hold  
Love can make you sad and blue  
If you don't watch out it'll fall all over you  
Everybody knows that winter can be nice  
You can play in the snow, you can skate on the ice  
But you can't skate far when the ice gets thin  
'Cause you might fall in  
Sometimes love is wet and cold  
Similar to rain, just as hard to hold  
Love can make you sad and blue  
If you don't watch out it'll fall all over you  
Gray skies everywhere  
Storm clouds know your name  
Sadness in the air  
Feels like rain  
Sometimes love is wet and cold  
Similar to rain, just a hard to hold  
Love can make you sad and blue  
If you don't watch out it'll fall all over you
