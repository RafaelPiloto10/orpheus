Doctor, my woman  
Is comin' back home late today  
Could you maybe give me somethin'?  
'Cause the feeling is gone and I must get it back right away  
Before she sees that I've been  
Up, down, tryin' to get the feeling again  
All around, tryin' to get the feeling again  
The one that made me shiver  
Make my knees start to quiver  
Every time she walks in  
  
And I've looked high, low  
Everywhere I possibly can  
But there's just no tryin' to get the feelin' again  
It seemed to disappear as fast as it came  
  
Read ev'ry book  
Looked  
Through every meditation and poem  
Just to bring home  
That old sweet sensation  
But it ain't no use to me  
To try to get that feeling again  
  
Where did it run to?  
I thought I'd done all that I could  
Just to keep the love burnin'  
  
I've been up, down  
Tryin' to get the feeling
