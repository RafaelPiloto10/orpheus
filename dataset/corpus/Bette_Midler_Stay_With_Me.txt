Where did you go when things went wrong, baby?  
Who did you run to?  
Find a shoulder to lay your head upon.  
Baby, wasn't I there?  
Didn't I take good care of you?  
But, oh, no. I can't believe you're leaving me, yeah.  
  
Stay with me, baby.  
I'm beggin' you to stay with me, baby.  
Yeah, stay with me, baby.  
I can't go on.  
  
Who did you touch when you needed tenderness, baby?  
I gave you so much,  
And in return I found happiness.  
Baby, what could I do?  
Maybe I was too good, too good to you.  
Oh, I can't believe you're leavin' me.  
Oh, oh, oh.  
  
Oh, stay with me, baby.  
Why don't you, why don't you just stay with me, baby?  
Yeah, stay with me, baby.  
Remember, you said you always gonna love me.  
Remember, you said you'd never ever leave me.  
Remember, remember, I'm asking you, begging you.  
Oh, oh, oh.  
  
Oh, stay with me, baby, baby, baby.  
Why don't you stay with me, baby?  
Stay with me, baby.  
I can't, I can't go, oh, on.  
  
"well, I'm a young woman, and I could get plenty of men. but honey, keepin'
'em's the hard part, ain't it? yeah. sometimes, sometimes I find I try so
hard."  
Maybe this time I should be the one to go away.  
'cause honey, ain't it my turn to have somebody  
Grab hold of me and say,  
"no! don't go! you can't go!"  
  
Oh! stay, stay with me, baby.  
I'm begging you, stay with me.  
Stay with me, baby.  
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't.  
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, stay with me, baby.  
Why don't you stay with me, baby?  
Stay with me, baby.  
I can't, I can't go on.
