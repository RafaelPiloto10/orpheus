Johnny stumbles johnny falls  
Under slogans  
Off the wall  
He sees where's the sense  
He says call me mister malcontent  
A waste of space and alcohol  
Drinking rain and eating soil  
And slogans off the wall  
Cannot express himself at all  
Cut off my nose despite my face  
And I will not more longer wait  
Or should I laugh or should I cry  
Or should I part my hair behind...  
... Or should I laugh or should I cry  
As I become all I despise
