Is there another guy?  
Who I think is cool,  
Walking outside my door,  
Peeking everyday.  
  
I look at him,  
Like he is so poor,  
Everytime I eat he will steal,  
He is my boy.  
  
There are four Evermore,  
Radio stations,  
Everywhere that we go.  
You think I know,  
He is so cute.  
He is cool and funkin'.  
In the four Evermore.  
  
Is there someone?  
That I look onto,  
Kiss me on my cheek,  
Taking advantage.  
  
I look at him,  
Like he is so poor,  
Everytime I eat he will steal,  
He is my boy.  
  
There are four evermore,  
Radio stations.  
Everywhere that we go.  
You think I know,  
He is so cute,  
He is so cool and funkin',  
In the four Evermore.
