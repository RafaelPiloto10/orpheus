Is it true what they say,  
Are we too blind to find a way?  
Fear of the unknown clouds our hearts today.  
Come into my world,  
See trough my eyes.  
Try to understand,  
Don't want to lose what we have.  
  
We've been dreaming  
But who can deny,  
It's the best way of living  
Between the truth and the lies.  
  
[Chorus]  
See who I am,  
Break through the surface.  
Reach for my hand,  
Let's show them that we can  
Free our minds and find a way.  
The world is in our hands,  
This is not the end.  
  
Fear is withering the soul  
At the point of no return.  
We must be the change  
We wish to see.  
I'll come into your world,  
See trough your eyes.  
I'll try to understand,  
Before we lose what we have.  
  
We just can't stop believing  
Because we have to try.  
We can rise above  
Their truth and their lies.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I hear their silence  
Preaching my blame.  
Will our strength remain  
If their power reigns?  
  
[Chorus]
