It's a long and lonely highway.  
When you're traveling all alone.  
I was on my way to nowhere.  
But now I'm coming home.  
I'm coming home.  
  
I've been running through the fire.  
I've been running for so long.  
If I took it any higher.  
Baby I would be still be gone.  
  
And now I'm coming home,  
Coming home.  
I'm coming home.  
I'm coming home, coming home  
Coming home.  
  
Well my home was really never.  
On a far and distant shore.  
If I stayed away forever.  
I could never miss you more.  
  
And so I'm coming home,coming  
Home.  
I'm coming home.  
I'm coming home,coming home,  
Coming home.  
  
I think of all these years gone by.  
Never even wondered why.  
I never touched the ground.  
All the time that's come and gone.  
All the nights I've been alone.  
And now I'm homeward bound.  
  
I heard the thunder over canaan.  
And I heard the angels cry.  
And their voices came revealing  
As you live,so will you die.  
  
I'm coming home,coming home,  
I'm coming home.  
I'm coming home,coming home,  
Coming home.
