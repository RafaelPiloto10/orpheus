I know what you're thinkin'  
We were goin' down  
I can feel the sinkin'  
But then I came around  
  
And everyone I've loved before  
Flashed before my eyes  
And nothin' mattered anymore  
I looked into the sky  
  
Well we all want something better than  
We wish for something new  
Well we all want something beautiful  
Wish for something true  
Been lookin' for a reason and  
Something to lose  
  
When the wheels come down  
When the wheels touch ground  
And you feel like it's all over  
There's another round for you  
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)  
  
Now your head is spinnin'  
Broken hearts will mend  
This is our beginning  
Comin' to an end  
  
Well, you wanted something beautiful  
You wished for something new  
Well, you wanted something better than  
Wished for something true  
Been lookin' for a reason and  
Something to lose  
  
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)  
When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground)  
And you feel like it's all over  
There's another round for you  
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)  
Oh!  
  
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)  
When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground)  
And you feel like it's all over  
There's another round for you  
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)  
  
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)  
When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground)  
And you feel like it's all over  
There's another round for you  
When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)
