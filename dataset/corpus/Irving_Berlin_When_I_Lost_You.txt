(musical intro)  
I lost the sunshine and roses, I lost the heavens of blue,  
I lost the beautiful rainbow, I lost the morning dew.  
I lost the angel who gave me summer, the whole winter too.  
I lost the gladness that turned into sadness,  
When I lost you.  
(musical interlude)  
And I lost the angel who gave me summer, the whole winter too.  
I lost the gladness that turned into sadness,  
When I lost you.
