The morning that you left me was just another day  
How could I see the sorrow that had found me  
Then you left and told me that I was in your way  
And I turned and ran as heaven fell around me  
I stumbled through the darkness my footsteps were unsure  
I live within a world that had no sunshine  
When you left me darling my world came to an end  
And there was darkness on the face of the earth  
The stars fell out of heaven and the moon could not be found  
The sun was in a million pieces scattered all around  
Why did you ever leave me you knew how it would hurt  
And now there's darkness on the face of the earth  
  
The stars fell out of heaven...  
And now there's darkness on the face of the earth
