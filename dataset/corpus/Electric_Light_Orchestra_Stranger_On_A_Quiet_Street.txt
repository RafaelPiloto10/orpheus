When all the thrills have been forgotten  
The chill of night can call them home  
And all the dreams that you left stranded  
Will slowly start to come along  
  
I felt it as she slipped away, slipped away  
I didn't have the words to say  
When I saw the stranger  
A stranger on a quiet street  
Stranger on a quiet street  
  
You can go straight as an arrow  
You can go straight as you dare  
Walkin' the old straight and narrow  
Don't always get you there  
  
The sun was shining when I saw it all  
She was moving to a different beat  
When I met a stranger  
A stranger on a quiet street  
Stranger on a quiet street  
  
It came to me out of the blue, out of the blue  
There came the moment that I really knew  
When I met a stranger  
A stranger on a quiet street  
Stranger on a quiet street  
  
Stranger on a quiet street...  
Stranger on a quiet street...  
Stranger on a quiet street...  
Stranger on a quiet street...  
Stranger on a quiet street, on a quiet street  
Stranger on a quiet street...  
Stranger on a quiet street...  
Stranger on a quiet street...
