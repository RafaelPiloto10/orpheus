At long weary last  
this game is over  
The sins of the past  
fled from my shoulder  
The sleep that I need  
is all that I ask  
In thought and in deed  
I have burnt the mask  
Here I am  
here I am  
Enchantment is broken  
I merged with the crowd  
Oaths have been spoken  
inside and out loud  
Emerging from under  
motions of God  
In tears and in wonder  
I ventured abroad  
Here I am  
here I am  
Can you walk a smithereen  
Can you walk a smithereen  
Closer to me  
could you love a thimbleful  
Could you love a thimbleful  
harder for me  
Encountered a loathly hag  
blood on the snow  
She said "I've a burden to drag  
and leagues to go"  
I left her down by the seaside  
in someone's hall  
By dawn's empty light I cried  
to no-one at all  
Here I am  
here I am  
Can you walk a smithereen  
Can you walk a smithereen  
Closer to me  
could you love a thimbleful  
Could you love a thimbleful  
harder for me  
I swing between  
tears and wonder  
I swing between  
tears and wonder  
I swing between  
tears and wonder  
I swing between  
tears and wonder  
Can you walk a smithereen  
Can you walk a smithereen  
Closer to me  
could you love a thimbleful  
Could you love a thimbleful  
harder for me  
Harder for me
