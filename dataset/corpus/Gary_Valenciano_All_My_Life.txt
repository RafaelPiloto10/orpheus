All my life  
Without a doubt I give you, all my life  
Now and forever  
Till the day I die,  
You and I will share...  
  
All the things  
This changing world can offer so I sing  
I'd be happy just to stay this way  
Spend each day with you  
  
There was a time  
When I just thought that I would lose my mind  
You came along and then the sun did shine  
Trying to find my way.  
  
I do recall  
Every moment spent was wasted time  
But then I chose to lay it on the line  
Put the past away, put the past away, put the past away  
  
Instrumental  
  
All my life  
I will carry you through all my life  
Between each hour of the passing days  
I will stay with you  
  
There was a time  
When I just thought that I would lose my mind  
You came along and then the sun did shine  
Started out my way  
  
I do recall  
Every moment spent was wasted time  
But then I chose to lay it on the line  
I want this all my life, I want this all my life, I want this all my life, I
want this all my life, I want this all life,  
I've wanted this all my life...
