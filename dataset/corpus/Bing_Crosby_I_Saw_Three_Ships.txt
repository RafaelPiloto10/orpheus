I saw three ships  
Come sailing in  
On Christmas Day  
On Christmas Day  
I saw three ships  
Come sailing in  
On Christmas day  
In the morning  
And all the bells  
On Earth  
Shall ring  
On Christmas Day  
  
In the morning  
Let us all  
Rejoice again  
On Christmas day  
On Christmas day  
Let us all  
Rejoice again  
On Christmas Day  
In the morning  
  
I saw three ships  
Come sailing in  
On Christmas day  
On Christmas Day  
I saw three ships  
Come sailing in  
On Christmas day  
In the morning
