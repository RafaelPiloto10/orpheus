There's truth in your eyes, let me hear it from your lips  
Your tears say you cry, let your words be the whip, baby  
  
There's no reason anymore to live with all the pain  
Take this key, unlock the door, before it makes us both insane  
  
Spill your heart out to me, darlin', girl I really need to know  
  
[Chorus]  
Screams and whispers, don't be afraid  
Let's be more than lovers tonight  
Screams and whispers, let go of the pain  
Whatever we uncover, we can make it, make it alright  
  
Alright  
  
I know you've been alone, takin' care of yourself  
Girl don't you think it's time to trust somebody else?  
  
Try just once to let your guard down, you've got nothin' there to hide  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Spill your heart out to me, darlin', girl I really need to know  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
"Whatever we uncover, there'll be screams and whispers tonight"  
  
Alright
