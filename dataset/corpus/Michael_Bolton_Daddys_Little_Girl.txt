You're the end of the rainbow, my pot of gold  
You're daddy's little girl to have and hold  
A precious gem is what you are  
A ray of hope, a shining star  
You're as bright as the sunshine, morning's first light  
You warm my day, brighten my night  
You're sugar, you're spice, you're everything nice  
And you're daddy's little girl  
A precious gem that's what you are  
A ray of hope, a shining star  
You're as bright as the sunshine, morning's first light  
You warm my day and brighten my night  
You're sugar, you're spice, you're everything nice  
And you're daddy's little girl
