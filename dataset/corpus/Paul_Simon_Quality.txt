The way you move  
It's got quality  
  
Come on baby, let's go downtown  
Little girl, you sure look good to me  
The way you move  
It's got quality  
  
Come on baby, now don't be shy  
Step in the light so I can see  
The way you move  
It's got quality  
  
I want to know  
Are you my beautiful young boy  
Or just another love  
Passing through my life  
I need to know  
Will you be my sorrow and my joy  
And maybe one day soon  
Will I be your wife  
  
Come on baby, let's rock some more  
I want to spend my salary  
The way you move  
It's got quality  
  
Come on baby, let's go downtown  
Little girl, you sure look good to me  
The way you move  
It's got quality  
  
I want to know  
Are you my beautiful young boy  
Or just another love  
Passing through my life  
I need to know  
Will you be my sorrow and my joy  
And maybe one day soon  
Will I be your wife  
Quiero saber  
Quiero saber  
Nadie nunca sabe  
En la vida  
  
The way you move  
It's got quality
