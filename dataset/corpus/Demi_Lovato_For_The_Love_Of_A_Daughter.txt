Four years old  
With my back to the door  
All I could hear  
Was the family war  
Your selfish hands  
Always expecting more  
Am I your child?  
Or jut a charity award?  
  
[Chorus]  
You have a hollowed out heart  
But it's heavy in your chest  
I tried so hard to fight it but it's hopeless,  
Hopeless  
You're hopeless  
Oh father,  
Please father,  
I'd love to leave you alone  
But I can't let you go  
Oh father,  
Please father  
Put the bottle down  
For the love of a daughter  
  
It's been five years  
Since we've spoken last  
And you can't take back  
What we never had  
I can be manipulated  
Only so many times  
Before even "I Love You"  
Starts to sound like a lie  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't you remember I'm your baby girl?  
How you push me our of your world?  
Lied to your flesh and your blood  
Put your hands on the ones that you swore ou loved  
Don't you remember I'm your baby girl?  
How could you throw me right out of your world?  
So young when the pain had begun  
Now forever afraid of being loved  
  
Oh father,  
Please father,  
I'd love to leave you alone but I can't let you go  
Oh father,  
Please father,  
Put the bottle down  
For the love of a daughter  
For the love of a daughter
