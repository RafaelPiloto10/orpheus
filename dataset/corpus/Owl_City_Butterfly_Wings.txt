If I was a raindrop  
You'd be my thunderstorm  
It's cold, so surround me  
With rain clouds to keep me warm  
I feel like I'm falling  
  
So darling, don't let me go  
The thought is appalling  
But should I slip away into the stormy sea  
Will you remember me  
  
Asleep in the warm cocoons  
We dream of lovely things  
We're both gonna wake up soon  
So we hope that tomorrow brings  
Us our "Butterfly Wings"  
  
If I was a grain of sand  
Would you be Miami Beach  
So dusty with starlight  
Close your eyes and cuddle close to me  
  
I'll try not to wake you  
Or make a sound while you're dozing off  
But in the night should the high tides  
Sweep me away from you  
Tell me again my dear, will you be waiting here  
  
Whenever we leave the ground  
And take to the sky  
I'll smile as I'm gazing down  
'Cause I've always wondered why  
We won't need feathers to fly
