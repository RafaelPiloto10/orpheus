Since the first day I met her I knew she was the one  
Or  
I know she's the one I've been searching for all my life  
Or  
There's not a day that I could go without her, I have to see her beautiful
face  
Or  
Every time I'm with her I fell like if I'm dreaming  
Or  
I just can't stop thinking about her  
Or  
I love everything about her, there's not one thing that I'll ever change about
her  
Or  
There's something about her that makes me fall in love with her within
everyday  
Or  
It's like a dream come true, I still can't believe how a pretty lady like her
fell in love with me  
Or  
She's the best girlfriend I've had so far  
Well that's all I got for now!
