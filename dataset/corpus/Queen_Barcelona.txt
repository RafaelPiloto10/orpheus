I had this perfect dream  
Un sueno me envolvio  
This dream was me and you  
Tal vez esta aqui  
I want all the world to see  
Un instinto me guiaba  
A miracle sensation  
My guide and inspiration  
Now my dream is slowly coming true  
The wind is a gentle breeze  
EI me hablo de ti  
The bells are ringing out  
EI canto vuela  
They're calling us together  
Guiding us forever  
Wish my dream would never go away  
  
Barcelona  
It was the first time that we met  
Barcelona  
How can I forget  
The moment that you stepped into the room  
You took my breath away  
  
Barcelona  
La musica vibro  
Barcelona  
Yella nos unio  
And if God is willing  
We will meet again  
Someday  
  
Let the songs begin  
Dejalo nacer  
Let the music play  
Ah  
Make the voices sing  
Nace un gran amor  
Start the celebration  
Ven a mi  
And cry  
Grita  
Come alive  
Vive  
And shake the foundations from the skies  
Shaking all our lives  
  
Barcelona  
Such a beautiful horizon  
Barcelona  
Like a jewel in the sun  
Por ti sere gaviota de tu bella mar  
Barcelona  
Suenan las campanas  
Barcelona  
Abre tus puertas al mundo  
If God is willing  
If God is willing  
If God is willing  
Friends until the end  
  
Viva!  
Barcelona!
