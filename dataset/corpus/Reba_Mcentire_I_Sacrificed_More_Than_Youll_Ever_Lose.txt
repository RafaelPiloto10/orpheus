I fed the children  
And I kissed them goodnight  
You fed the jukebox  
Till they turn out the lights  
I bought the bacon  
While you bought the booze  
I've sacrificed more than you'll ever lose  
  
Needing new clothes with the money you spent  
On barbills and motels and women you met  
But I stood the heartache that you put me through  
I've sacrificed more than you'll ever lose  
  
I gave up so much  
And now I'm giving up you  
It's too late to make up for  
The love that you used  
  
I've had enough  
I don't want you around  
Don't look at me  
Like I let you down  
You say I'm to blame  
But who's fooling who  
I've sacrificed more than you'll ever lose  
Yeah I sacrificed more than you'll ever lose
