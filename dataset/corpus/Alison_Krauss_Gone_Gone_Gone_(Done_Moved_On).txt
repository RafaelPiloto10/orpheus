Some sunny day-hay baby  
When everything seems okay, baby  
You'll wake up and find out you're alone  
Cause I'll be gone  
Gone, gone, gone really gone  
Gone, ga-gone, cause you done me wrong  
  
Everyone that you meet baby  
As you walk down the street baby  
Will ask you why you're walkin' all alone  
Why you're on your own  
Just say I'm gone  
Gone, gone, gone  
Gone, ga-gone, cause you done me wrong  
  
If you change your way baby  
You might get me to stay baby  
Ya better hurry up if ya don't wanna be alone  
Or I'll be gone  
Gone, gone, gone  
Really gone  
Gone, ga-gone  
Cause you done me wrong
