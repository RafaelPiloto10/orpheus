Intrigue surrounding me  
Intrigue surrounding you  
I was only looking for a bit of harmony and grace,  
I swear I only meant it in good faith.  
  
In league enfolding you  
Fatigue I feel it, too.  
I guess I never thought I had a thing or two to lose,  
I never thought I'd end up as good news.  
  
Believe in what you hear.  
Concede to what you fear.  
And if you think that I have so much love to go to waste,  
Cut out the running home, make the pace.
