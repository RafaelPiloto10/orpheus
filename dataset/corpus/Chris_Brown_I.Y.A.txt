I was crazy when I said I didn't love you,  
From the first time that I ever saw you,  
The emotions running deep underneath my skin,  
Sign anywhere for your love, where do we begin.  
  
So lay me down  
Tell me what I wanna hear  
Take me down  
There's nobody else I'd rather be with.  
  
I wanna wake up in your arms,  
I wanna wake up in your arms,  
I wanna wake up in your arms,  
I wanna wake up in your arms.  
  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
  
If my heart is outta place move over,  
I coulda told you how it hurts, coulda told ya.  
And now I want you I can feel it in my heartbeat,  
It's like a race like I'm running in a track meet.  
  
So lay me down  
Tell me what I wanna hear  
Take me down  
There's nobody else I'd rather be with.  
  
I wanna wake up in your arms,  
I wanna wake up in your arms,  
I wanna wake up in your arms,  
I wanna wake up in your arms.  
  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh
