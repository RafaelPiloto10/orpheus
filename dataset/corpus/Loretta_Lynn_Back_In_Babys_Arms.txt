I'm back in baby's arms how I've missed those lovin' arms  
I'm back where I belong back in baby's arms  
  
Don't know why we quarrel we never did before  
Since we found out how it hurts I bet we never quarrel anymore  
I'm back in baby's arms...  
  
Thought I didn't need his love till it took away  
Now I'm back where I belong in my baby's arms I'm gonna stay  
I'm back in baby's arms...  
Back in baby's arms back in baby's arms
