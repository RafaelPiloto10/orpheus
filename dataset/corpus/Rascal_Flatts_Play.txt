You're a single mom with three kids and just as many jobs  
Your candle burns at both ends but you can't make it stop  
Your a farmer on a John Deer honest work for little pay  
Now throw that thing in park it's time to play  
  
[Chorus]  
Like it's midnight in Vegas  
Mardi Gras in New Orleans  
New Years Eve in New York City  
You know what I mean  
It's like lovers in Paris, Sunset Strip in L.A.  
Doesn't matter where you are  
Well it's alright it's alright to play  
  
Oh yes it is  
  
Where there ain't no drugs or doctors  
Who can get you what you need  
I've got the magic potion  
And it doesn't cost a thing  
Yeah you've seen some hard times  
Life just works out that way  
When your smack dab in the middle  
You gotta play  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hey hey  
  
Like a kiss in the moonlight  
Barefoot walks on the beach  
Like sipping Champagne straight from a bottle  
You know what I mean  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(It's alright to play it's alright it's alright it's alright to play yeah it's
alright)  
Come on come on come on  
It's alright to play (it's alright to play it's alright it's alright it's
alright to play)  
It's alright to play yeah (it's alright to play it's alright it's alright it's
alright to play)  
Yeah it's alright to play (it's alright to play yeah it's alright it's alright
to play)  
Well it's alright it's alright well it's alright alright to play  
It's alright to play
