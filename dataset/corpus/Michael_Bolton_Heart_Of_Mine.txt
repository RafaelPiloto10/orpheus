You say you're sure  
You wanna stay with me  
I don't think  
You better play with me  
You fool around I gotta lose  
I don't need it  
  
And pretty soon you want  
Our love to last  
I think your mind  
Has got you moving too fast  
So slow down you can't lose  
You can have it  
Anyway that you choose  
  
Chorus:  
You wanna know  
So I'll tell you to your face  
You don't play with  
Love on the line  
You wanna know  
So I'll tell you to your face  
You don't play with  
This heart of mine  
  
Why don't you come  
Out of your fantasy  
You can't afford to take  
The chance with me  
I'm telling you I can't lie  
I don't need it  
  
So let's forget about  
The rest of you  
'Cause I already know  
The best of you  
You're alright you can't lose  
You can have it  
Anyway that you choose  
(repeat)  
  
You say you're sure  
You wanna stay with me  
I don't think  
You better play with me  
Just slow down you can't lose  
You can have it  
Anyway that you choose  
(repeat 2 times)  
  
This heart of mine
