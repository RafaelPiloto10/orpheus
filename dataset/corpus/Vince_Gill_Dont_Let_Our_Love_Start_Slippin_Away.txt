We've been up  
All night long  
Trying to solve a problem  
Hell it's almost dawn  
Ain't no time for sleepin'  
If our love is wearin' thin  
'Cause I ain't givin' up  
And you ain't givin' in  
  
Don't let our love start slippin'  
Love start slippin' away  
'Cause the life we've been livin'  
Gets harder everyday  
Don't let our love start slippin'  
Love start slippin' away  
  
A wounded love  
Walks a real thin line  
And no communication  
Will kill it every time  
So open up your heart  
Baby we can work it out  
'Cause we've got the kind of love  
People dream about  
  
Don't let our love start slippin'  
Love start slippin' away  
'Cause the life we've been livin'  
Gets harder everyday  
Don't let our love start slippin'  
Love start slippin' away  
  
It's past the point of right or wrong  
Let's find a way to just hold on
