[Verse 1]  
If I lost it all today, what would you take?  
Would my love be enough to stimulate?  
Shit hit the fan, grenades got thrown  
Would you still show, oh?  
Could you go down with me into the night?  
Could we get back up beneath, eventually love?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Oh, I get myself tonight  
I get myself tonight, oh  
Oh, I get myself tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
We are just looking for a connection  
Yeah, we all want to be seen  
I'm looking for someone who speaks my language  
Someone to ride this ride with me  
Can I get a witness, witness?  
Will you be my witness, witness?  
I'm just looking for a witness in all of this  
Looking for a witness to get me through this  
  
[Verse 2]  
When you tell me everything, theres no holes  
You can scroll through anything, you got the codes  
Nothing to hide, it's all in their eyes  
And we just know, oh  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Oh, I get myself tonight  
I get myself tonight, oh  
Oh, I get myself tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
We are just looking for a connection  
Yeah, we all want to be seen  
I'm looking for someone who speaks my language  
Someone to ride this ride with me  
Can I get a witness, witness?  
Will you be my witness, witness?  
I'm just looking for a witness in all of this  
Looking for a witness to get me through this
