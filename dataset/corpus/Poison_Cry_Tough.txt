Remember the nights we sat  
And talked about all our dreams  
Well little did we know then  
They were more distant than they seemed  
Well I knew it  
You knew it too  
The things we'd go through  
We knew the things we had to do  
To make it, baby.  
  
[Chorus]  
You gotta cry tough  
Out on the streets  
To make your dreams happen  
You gotta cry out  
Out to the world  
To make them all come true.  
  
Life ain't no easy ride  
At least that's what I am told  
Sometimes the rainbow baby  
Is better than the pot of gold  
You've got to stick it out  
Whether you're wrong or right  
And you can't give in without a fight  
To make it baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You gotta aim high, baby  
Whether you lose or win  
And when you get to the top  
You gotta get off or go right back down again  
  
[Chorus]
