[Uh, What? Star, star  
Lana Del Rey, Lana Del Rey,  
Sing it to me, sing it to me]  
  
You're so easy to love  
You make me coo, coo like a turtle dove  
So hot that I can't get enough, enough of you  
  
Hit me and it felt like a kiss  
You know it hurt so good, when you do me like this  
So sad when I hear the girls talk  
When I walk by, I start to cry  
  
[Sing it to me baby]  
Cuz you're a beautiful player  
You're a beautiful player baby  
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh baby  
[You love that?]  
Ooh ooh oh oh, ah, ah, ah  
[Sing it to me, dawg)  
  
Sunset on a Saturday night,  
Having a talk, talk bout the time of our lives.  
He selling souls on the boulevard  
Of broken dreams, and city queens  
  
Live young like we oughta die fast  
'Cause he's been breaking the law, and he's not going back  
I love him finally all through the night  
And yes it's true, I live for you  
  
[Sing it to me baby]  
'Cause your my beautiful player [Sing it to me?]  
You're a beautiful player baby  
Ooh ooh oho ohh oh oh baby [Aw ya love that?]  
Ohh ohh oh ah ah ahh  
  
L is for the love you that gave and took away  
O is for the only one I wanted to stay  
V is for my valiant, valiant baby  
E is X that we took with champagne  
  
Hit me and it felt like kiss  
Baby, if it don't hurt, then I'll have to insist  
We have just one life to live  
But true loves more than he can give  
  
[Sing it to me baby]  
'Cause he's my beautiful player  
He's my beautiful player baby  
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh baby  
[Aw you love that?]  
Ooh ooh oh oh, ah, ah  
[Sing it to me baby]  
Cuz he's beautiful player  
[Sing it to me]  
He's my beautiful player baby  
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh baby  
[Aw you love that?]  
Ooh ooh oh oh, yeah
