I had guards like watchdogs  
Dogs in a manger  
I could feel the protection  
Possession and anger  
And I drove out of there  
With no on behind me  
Feeling funny and free  
All you pretty pretenders  
Negligent vendors  
Aren't you precious inside  
I have no need for anger  
With intimate strangers  
And I got nothing to hide  
Yeah  
  
I laughed as I said it  
This is my situation  
It's not pictures or privilege  
It's just self preservation  
I don't want you to feel  
Any obligation  
It feels so funny to be free  
All you pretty pretenders  
Negligent vendors  
Aren't you precious inside  
I have no need for anger  
With intimate strangers  
And I got nothing to hide  
  
We act empty and innocent  
But we are fueled by distortions  
(I remember you)  
Of lives led in discontent  
(When we were shiny and new)  
Trading misfortunes  
(Now you guard your faith)  
'Cause faith is one thing  
That is hard to deliver  
(Temper your speed)  
It feels so funny to be free  
  
All you pretty pretenders  
Negligent vendors  
Aren't you precious inside  
I have no need for anger  
With intimate strangers  
And I got nothing to hide  
I got nothing to hide  
  
All of us aren't we  
Pretty pretenders  
Negligent vendors  
Aren't we precious inside  
I have no need for anger  
With intimate strangers  
And I got nothing to hide  
I got nothing to hide  
  
I had guards like watchdogs  
Dogs in a manger  
(I remember you)
