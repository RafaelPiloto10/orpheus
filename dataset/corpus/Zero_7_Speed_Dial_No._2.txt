I don't need you anymore  
I'm okay and I am sure  
I don't need you anymore  
Yeah I'm okay, I'm reassured  
  
And I don't need you not today  
I promise I'll call I promise I'll say  
I don't need you not to stay  
And if you ever need me I'll reciprocate  
  
Your shoulders in my pocket  
Speed dial No. Two  
See you when I need you  
See you when I do  
See you when I do  
  
Do you need me, I am here  
Can you ask, can you be clear  
Yes you need me, I appear  
Now you are me, I am here  
  
Your shoulders in your pocket  
Speed dial No. Two  
Call it when you need me  
See you when I do  
See you when I do  
  
Call me when you need me  
Just call me when you need me  
  
Call me when you need me  
See you when I do
