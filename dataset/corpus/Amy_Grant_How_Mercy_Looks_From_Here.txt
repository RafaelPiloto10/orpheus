The water rose today,  
The river with the rain  
Memories and picture frames  
Are floating miles away.  
Through the wreckage and the mud,  
The ruins after the flood,  
She survived at 91, hmm  
  
Some would have given up  
Drowning in their tears  
But on her wrinkled face  
A smile appeared.  
  
When you face your greatest fear  
Losing all that you hold near  
Open up your eyes my dear,  
Oh how mercy looks from here.  
  
The call I couldn't take,  
Unbearable mistakes  
A brilliant mind that fades away  
A baby doll beside the grave  
  
When you face your greatest fear  
Losing all that you hold near  
Open up your eyes my dear  
Oh how mercy looks from here.  
  
I would have given up, drowning in my tears  
If it wasn't for your voice all these years  
  
When you face your greatest fear  
Losing all that you hold near  
Open up your eyes my dear  
My dear  
  
That's when boundless grace appears  
Unseen angels hover near  
Saints are singing loud and clear  
Oh how mercy looks from here.  
Oh how mercy looks from here.  
  
Oh how mercy looks from here.  
Oh how mercy looks from here.  
  
The water rose today
