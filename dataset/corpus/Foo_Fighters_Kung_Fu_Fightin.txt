Everybody was kung fu fighting  
Those kids were fast as lightning  
In fact it was a little bit frightening  
But they fought with expert timing  
  
There were funky china men  
From funky china town  
They were chopping them up  
They were chopping them down  
It's an ancient chinese art  
And everybody knew their part  
From a faintin' to a sniff  
And a kicking from the hip  
  
Everybody was kung fu fightin  
Those kids were fast as lightning  
In fact it was a little bit frightening  
But they fought with expert timing  
  
There was funky Billy Chin  
And little Sammy Chung  
He said: Here comes the big boss  
Let's get it on  
We took a vow and made a stand  
Started swaying with the hand  
But sudden mmotion made me skip  
Now we're into a brand new trip  
  
Everybody was kung fu fighting  
Those kids were fast as lightning  
In fact it was a little bit frightening  
But they did it with expert timing  
  
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh  
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh  
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh  
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh  
  
Everybody was kung fu fighting  
Those kids were fast as lightning  
In fact it was a little bit frightening  
Make sure you have expert timing  
  
Oh-Oh-Oh Kung Fu Fightin  
Has made me fast as lightning  
  
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh  
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh  
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh Give Give Give on  
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
