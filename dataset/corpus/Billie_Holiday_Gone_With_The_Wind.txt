Gone with the wind  
Just like a leaf that has blown away  
Gone with the wind  
My romance has flown away  
yesterday's kisses are still on my lips  
I had a lifetime of heaven at my fingertips  
now all is gone  
Gone is the rapture that filled my heart  
Gone with the wind  
The gladness that thrilled my heart  
just like a flame love burned brightly  
Then became an empty smoke dream  
That has gone with the wind
