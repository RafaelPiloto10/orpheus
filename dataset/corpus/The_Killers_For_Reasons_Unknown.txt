I pack my case, I check my face  
I look a little bit older  
I look a little bit colder  
With one deep breath, and one big step  
I move a little bit closer, I move a little bit closer  
For reasons unknown  
  
I caught my stride, I flew and flied  
I know if destiny's kind, I've got the rest on my mind  
Well, my heart - it don't beat, it don't beat the way it used to  
And my eyes - they don't see you no more  
And my lips - they don't kiss, they don't kiss the way they used to  
And my eyes don't recognize you no more  
  
For reasons unknown  
For reasons unknown  
  
It was an open chair  
We sat down in the open chair  
I said, if destiny's kind, I've got the rest on my mind  
But my heart - it don't beat, it don't beat the way it used to  
And my eyes - they don't see you no more  
And my lips - they don't kiss, they don't kiss the way they used to  
And my eyes don't recognize you at all  
  
For reasons unknown  
For reasons unknown  
  
I said, my heart - it don't beat, it don't beat the way it used to  
And my eyes don't recognize you no more  
And my lips - they don't kiss, they don't kiss the way they used to  
And my eyes don't recognize you no more  
  
For reasons unknown  
For reasons unknown  
For reasons unknown  
For reasons unknown
