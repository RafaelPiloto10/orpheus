Freeloader Freddy got a cold chevy nova  
Where he got the papers-don't know.  
Got a line on sweet act, sheer heart attack  
We're sticking close to the floor  
  
Refrain:  
How you feel, all right now  
I'm king of the road  
How you feel, red lights fading  
King for an hour, I need another.  
  
Freeloader Freddy knows all the ladies  
Standing on the corner downtown.  
Doing lines off the dash, own private stash  
Oh, the word is getting around.  
  
Refrain  
  
I'm taking my time making it mine  
I've got some people to see.  
And you want to play, you got to pay,  
Yesterday it used to be free.  
  
Refrain  
  
Assorted Ad Libs:  
It's all right, come on babe,  
Freeloader Freddy, oh yeah  
Ooh ooh ooh  
  
Some words are definately wrong!
