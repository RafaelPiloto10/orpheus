Warren Zevon, Zevon Music BMI  
You know I hate it when you put your hand inside my head (Warren sings
"stick")  
And switch all my priorities around  
Why don't you go pick on someone your own size instead?  
Go on without me, I'll just slow you down  
Go on without me, I'll just slow you down  
You always say you know me somehow I don't think you do  
Maybe you should buy another vowel  
You're jumping to conclusions so I can't keep up with you  
Go on without me, I'll just slow you down  
I'll just hold you up  
When I fall behind  
I'll just throw your schedule off  
So you get going if you're so inclined  
You know I hate it when you put your hand inside my head  
And switch all my priorities around  
You think you're pretty tricky but you're simply overbred  
Go on without me, I'll just slow you down  
Go on  
Go on  
Go on  
Go on
