A little bit of me and a whole lot of you  
Add a dash of starlight and a dozen roses, too  
Then let it rise for a hundred years or two  
And that's the recipe for making love  
  
It doesn't need sugar 'cause it's already sweet  
It doesn't need an oven 'cause it's got a lot of heat  
Just add a dash of kisses to make it all complete  
And that's the recipe for making love  
  
And if you've made it right you'll know it  
It's not like anything you've made before  
And if you've made it wrong you'll know it  
'cause it won't keep you coming back for more  
  
I didn't get it from my grandma's book upon the shelf  
I didn't get it from a magical and culinary elf  
No, a little birdie told me you can't make it by yourself  
And that's the recipe for making love
