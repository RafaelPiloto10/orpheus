I can live in a mansion or a double-wide  
Eat sushi raw or my catfish fried  
Wherever I am, then that's where I belong  
'Cause I'm quite content with who I am  
And if you ain't, well, kiss my ham  
Country is as country does and I'm country to the bone  
  
Country is as country does  
It's the way I am and it's the way I was  
It's the way I always will be, that's for sure  
Country born and country bred  
Countrified and country-fed  
A country heart and a country head  
'Cause I'm country to the core  
  
Now, I can drive a tractor or a Cadillac  
I can fly first class or slum in the back  
But I'll be the same ol' gal when I arrive  
Oh I can wear denim or I can wear silk  
Drink champagne or chocolate milk  
Take the best or live with less, 'cause a country girl survives  
  
Country is as country does  
It's the way I am and it's the way I was  
And the way I'll be until they lay me low  
Country born and country bred  
I'm countrified and I'm country-fed  
And I'll be that way 'til I'm country dead  
'Cause I'm country head to toe  
  
And what you see is what you get  
Nothing's ever changed me yet  
Nothing will, it's a pretty safe bet  
'Cause I'm country through and through  
  
Oh, that's country!  
  
Country is as country does  
It's the way I am and it's the way I was  
It's the way I'll be until my dying day  
I'm country born and country bred  
Countrified and country-fed  
And nothing done and nothing said can change my country ways  
Nothing done and nothing said  
Nothing's gonna change my country ways  
  
I don't think so  
Wouldn't change if I could  
  
Country is as country does  
It's the way I is and it's the way I was  
Country born and country bred  
I'm countrified and I'm country-fed, you know that  
I'm country (she's country)  
But now that don't mean I can't go to town!
