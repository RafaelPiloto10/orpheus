You were only fooling  
(while I was falling in love)  
  
Words by billy faber and fred meadows  
Music by larry fotine  
  
You were only fooling,  
While I was falling in love,  
It's a story as old as adam and eve,  
I was making love but you were making believe,  
  
You lied to me with kisses,  
I tried to stop dreaming of,  
But you were only fooling me,  
While I was falling in love.  
  
(repeat from start)
