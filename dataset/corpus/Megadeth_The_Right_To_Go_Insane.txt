I barely get to the graveyard shift on time  
After pulling another grueling 9 to 5  
I live from credit card to check  
The paper money's whirling by  
And I hardly just  
Just barely only just survive  
  
I'm living on the edge  
Reality is teetering  
My mind is on the brink  
  
How will I face the day tomorrow  
If I can't make it through today  
I've got nothing left to lose but my sanity  
And the right to go insane  
  
I've got nothing left to lose but my mind  
I've got nothing left to choose  
So I think I'll go insane  
  
My stomach aches  
Insufficient funds  
My cheeks are gaunt  
And my guts are overdrawn  
My head pounds  
Starvation's giving me the shakes  
Too much squalor  
Too much pressure  
Now I'm getting pissed  
  
I'm living on the edge  
Reality is teetering  
My mind is on the brink  
  
How will I face the day tomorrow  
If I can't make it through today  
I've got nothing left to lose but my sanity  
And the right to go insane  
  
I've got nothing left to lose but my mind  
I've got nothing left to choose  
So I think I'll go insane
