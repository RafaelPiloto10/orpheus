I believe that when the hurting and the pain has gone  
We will be strong, Oh yes we will be strong  
And I believe that if I'm crying while I write these words  
Is it absurd? Or am I being real  
I believe that if you knew just what these tears were for  
They would just pour like every drop of rain  
That's why I believe it is too late for anyone to believe  
I believe that if you thought for a moment, took your time  
You would not resign yourself to your fate  
And I believe that if it's written in the stars, that's fine  
I can't deny that I'm a Virgo too  
I believe that if your bristling while you hear this song  
I could be wrong or have I hit a nerve?  
That's why I believe it is too late for anyone to believe  
I believe that maybe somewhere in the darkness  
In the nighttime, In the storm  
In the casino  
Casino Spanish eyes  
I believe, no I can't believe that every time you hear a new born scream  
You just can't see the shaping of a life  
The shaping of a life
