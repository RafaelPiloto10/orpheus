Tired of my beeper, tired of my phone  
Tired of this tired ol' tie I got on  
Sick of this traffic jam that I'm in  
We all get sick of it all now and then  
When I've had it up to here  
I go down there  
  
To guitars, tiki bars and a whole lotta love  
Mangoes and Marley, you know, fit me like a glove  
Sixth gear with nowhere to steer  
When enough is enough  
It's guitars, tiki bars and a whole lotta love  
  
I feel like a fish jerked out of the sea  
Or a bird in a cage that's never seen a key  
Sick of this grind and I think that I ought  
To bring this grind to a grinding halt  
Now I've had it up to here  
Let's go down there  
  
To guitars, tiki bars and a whole lotta love  
Mangoes and Marley, you know, fit me like a glove  
Sixth gear with nowhere to steer  
When enough is enough  
It's guitars, tiki bars and a whole lotta love  
  
Now I've had it up to here  
Let's go down there  
  
To guitars, tiki bars and a whole lotta love  
Mangoes and Marley, you know, fit me like a glove  
Sixth gear with nowhere to steer  
When enough is enough  
It's guitars, tiki bars and a whole lotta love
