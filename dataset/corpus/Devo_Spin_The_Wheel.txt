When I was young I thought I stood  
On solid ground well that proved wrong  
Everything I knew was true  
Just blew up in my face  
Isn't life wonderful?  
I didn't really think so  
I took my chips and cashed them in  
And let the games begin  
'Cause it's easy  
It's perfectly easy  
To spin that wheel 'round  
'Til you turn it all upside down  
It's easy  
It's perfectly easy  
To let that wheel spin  
'Til the numbers come back right to you  
Now spin that wheel  
There's nothing to lose  
Spin that wheel  
It's waiting for you  
Now spin that wheel  
Let the wheel decide  
Spin that wheel  
Go along for the ride  
Spin the wheel  
When I was young and set to move  
I started looking forward to  
The fun that disappeared so soon  
I wanted to check out  
Isn't life wonderful  
I didn't used to think so  
I took my chips and cashed them in  
And started up again  
Now it's easy
