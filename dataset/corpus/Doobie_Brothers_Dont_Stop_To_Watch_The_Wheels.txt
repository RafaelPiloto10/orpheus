When I think about you, baby  
I want you here  
I wanna put my arms around you  
And feel you, dear  
Girl, you've touched my heart, I'm so in love  
And you're the only girl I'm thinking of, ooh  
I call my baby on the phone  
Got to get a message just to let her know  
That if she ever feels alone  
To dial my heart  
And if by chance you're not at home  
You can reach me, baby, by the nearest pay phone  
I gotta cross my fingers and pray you'll know  
To dial my heart  
Dial my heart  
Just dial heart  
Yeah, yeah  
Can we talk it about, baby  
Do you have the time?  
I said, "Am I the only homeboy  
That's on your mind?"  
?Cause I'm alone  
And I can't sleep at night  
And I won't sleep  
Until you're by my side, yeah  
I call my baby on the phone  
Got to get a message just to let her know  
That if she ever feels alone  
To dial my heart  
And if by chance you're not at home  
You can reach me, baby, by the nearest pay phone  
I gotta cross my fingers and pray you'll know  
To dial my heart  
Just dial my heart  
You can dial my heart  
Just dial my heart  
I call my baby on the phone  
Got to get a message just to let her know  
That if she ever feels alone  
To dial my heart  
And if by chance you're not at home  
You can reach me, baby, by the nearest pay phone  
I gotta cross my fingers and pray you'll know  
To dial my heart  
I call my baby on the phone
