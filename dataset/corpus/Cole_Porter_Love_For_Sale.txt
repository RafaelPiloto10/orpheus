When the only sound on the empty street  
Is the heavy tread of the heavy feet  
That belong to a lonesome cop  
I open shop  
The moon so long has been gazing down  
On the warward ways of this wayward town  
Her smile becomes a smirk, I go to work  
Love for sale  
Appetizing young love for sale  
Love that's fresh and still unspoiled  
Love that's only slightly soiled  
Love for sale  
Who will buy  
Who would like to sample my supply  
Who's prepared to pay the price  
For a trip to paradise  
Love for sale  
Let the poets pipe of love  
In their childish ways  
I know every type of love  
Better far than they  
If you want the thrill of love  
I've been through the mill of love  
Old love  
New love  
Every love but true love  
Love for sale  
Appetizing young love for sale  
If you want to buy my wares  
Follow me and climb the stairs  
Love for sale
