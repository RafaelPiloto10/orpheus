We giving up on all the emptiness  
I fill it up with your sweet love beside me.  
Ain't no fun to be a rolling stone inside  
You buy the feeling and you pay with tears.  
For what it matters you flow with the motion  
Then out of nowhere there's a full moon rising  
And it's mine.  
And every  
Every moment is the history we make - and more  
We got a legacy of understanding  
I can love you better  
But donY let your -  
Heart stop beating in time  
Don't take me below the danger level.  
Caught up in the middle of a misery -  
Don't let me die.  
And I warn you if you let your  
Heart stop beating in time  
Don't make it a fatal combination  
I won't ever find another your love no more.  
Got to get closer  
Got to be in sight  
You make it heaven to breathe with you woman.  
Don't you get lonely in the midnight hour like me?  
And there's an angel that I follow on the wind - and more  
Within a universe of undiscovered eyes  
We found each other  
So don't let your -  
Heart stop beating  
In time  
Don't take me below the danger level.  
Caught up in the middle of a misery.  
Oh baby  
Don't let it be.  
Save my soul  
I don't want to be no chains that hold  
Gotta be a wild new world out.  
There is a plan  
I don't want to be no one night stand  
Gonna be alive for you down.  
Here is the love I can hold out in my hand  
And you can feel it I'm nothing if you let your -  
Heart stop beating in time  
. . .  
Don't let your heart stop beating in time  
. .
