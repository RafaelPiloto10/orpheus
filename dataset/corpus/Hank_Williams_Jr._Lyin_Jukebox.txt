Well, I've been sittin' here listenin'  
To your songs all night long  
Oh, you think you've got it all figured out  
You don't know at all  
  
Everything I've heard from you  
It's all a pack of lies  
I wouldn't spend another quarter  
For what you've said tonight  
  
Lyin' jukebox, ain't you got a song  
That tells the truth I didn't do her wrong  
Lyin' jukebox, ain't a word of it so  
You know I didn't leave her  
That woman made me go  
  
Well I think you've already said way too much  
And I've had way too many rounds  
I never fought a jukebox before  
But it's time to hit you down  
  
You've made a whole lotta accusations  
Without one bit of proof  
And if you say I cheated one more time  
I'll pull the plug on you  
  
Lyin' jukebox, ain't you got a song  
That tells the truth I didn't do her wrong  
Lyin' jukebox, ain't a word of it so  
You know I didn't leave her  
That woman made me go  
You know I didn't leave her  
That woman made me go
