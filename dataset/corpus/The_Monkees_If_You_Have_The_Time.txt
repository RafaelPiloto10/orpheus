If you have the time would you keep me in mind  
Mind you, I only want to treat you kind  
If you're all alone, would you pick up the phone  
And dial the number that you know  
  
Will bring back the glow  
That's been gone for such a long, long time  
I feel like I'm just acting like a fool,  
Talking to my pillow, once a happy fellow was I  
  
I know that I'll get over you if I have to, but do I have to?  
I don't want to spend another day being so far away  
From the girl that I love
