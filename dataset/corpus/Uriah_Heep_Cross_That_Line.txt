What do you say  
To a talk over dinner  
Though we haven't  
Spoken for a while  
This time I won't take no  
For an answer  
You can't hide forever  
From your only son  
Let's take a seat  
Right here by the window  
I remember how you like the view  
Now look me in the eye  
The truth I wanna hear  
The time is right  
There's a shadow hanging  
Over me tonight  
Tell me what you did now  
Even though it hurts to say  
It's always been a mystery  
Locked behind the door  
Tell me is it true now  
Do you need the heart to say it  
I always did my best for you  
Don't you lie  
Don't you lie no more  
You tought me the way  
To be a winner  
And never to play  
On the losing side  
I guess that I turned out  
The way you always planned  
So hard to cross that line  
But the words have got to come  
From you this time
