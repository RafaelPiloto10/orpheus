Let me tell you how it's goin' down  
Let me introduce the new show in town  
Playin' no games, no messin' round  
Taking no prisoners, how's that sound  
Three young ladies, comin' out for you  
Yo, it's been too long since you heard the truth  
So this is the real no substitute  
We've come to lay it down, get it crunk for you  
You tired of hearing songs about things they've got  
When you are dead broke and ain't got a lot  
Got questions and answers they have not  
That's why we came here, to blow up the spot  
You're ready for something new  
Something more than my new car or my brand new shoes  
My Burberry this or my 22's  
Well, listen close as we break it down for you  
[chorus 2x]  
Make way for the crew, shout it  
We comin' through, shout it  
You know how we do, shout it  
We're makin' moves, shout it  
I know you feel this beat  
So bump it in the clubs  
And bang it in your Jeeps  
Cause you just can't get enough  
We represent for G-O-D  
Full of life, bringing positivity  
Livin' right cause that's the way  
Fully clothed and that's okay  
Trying to give a new point of view  
Cause you to think  
The message that your life can be new  
That's what we bring  
You're wasting years and air you breath  
No clue about your destiny  
Great is what you're meant to be  
Here's the light for you to see  
Cause we're walking different  
We smoke the competition  
We dope, we're on a mission  
No joke, this thing is real  
[chorus 2x]  
Make way for the crew, shout it  
We comin' through, shout it  
You know how we do, shout it  
We're makin' moves, shout it  
I know you feel this beat  
So bump it in the clubs  
And bang it in your Jeeps  
Cause you just can't get enough  
Listen close to what we say  
What we say, what we say  
We ain't coming just to play  
We've come to save the day  
[2x]  
Yo, we from the south, shout it  
Gonna make you bounce, shout it  
It's mister deal and now it's even what you think whatay  
My jiggle, my Burberry frick it don't matter  
When it come to the home beat pitcher, holla back  
If you really wanna get down whatcha like  
Can i get a witness, in the bars it's pitching  
Shout it, we gonna represent  
Shout it, cause we heaven sent  
[chorus 4x]
