You only hold me up like this  
'Cause you don't know who I really am  
Sometimes I just want to know what it's like to be you  
We're making out inside crashed cars  
We're sleeping through all our memories  
I used to waste my time dreaming of being alive (now I only waste my time
dreaming of you)  
  
Turn off the lights and turn off the shyness  
All of our moves make up for the silence  
And oh, the way your makeup stains my pillowcase  
Like I'll never be the same  
  
I've got headaches and bad luck but they couldn't touch you  
I'm not trying  
You only hold me up like this
