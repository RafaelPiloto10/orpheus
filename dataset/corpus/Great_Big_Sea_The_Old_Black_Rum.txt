I drank sixteen doubles for the price of one  
Trying to find the courage to talk to one  
I asked her for a dance  
Not a second glance  
My night had just begun  
  
Well I drink to the father and the holy ghost  
I'm kneeling at the alter of my nightly post  
So I'll raise a glass, not the first nor last  
Come join me in this toast  
  
[Chorus:]  
Because the old black rum's got a hold on me  
Like a dog wrapped round my leg  
And the old black rum's got a hold on me  
Will I live for another day?  
Hey, Will I live for another day?  
  
Well the queen of George street just went walking on by  
Walking on by with some guy who don't care  
That she stood in line  
Since half past nine  
And spent three hours on her hair (On her hair!)  
  
Well her friend is looking at me with an evil grin  
I think the bloody racket might soon begin  
I must have said some thing  
To the George street queen  
The boys are joining in!  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
So I drank all of my money  
And I slept out in the rain  
Everyday is different but the nights they're all the same  
You never see the sun on the old black rum  
But I know I'm gonna do it again!  
  
[Chorus:] 2x
