Well I'm a runnin' down the road try'n to loosen my load  
I've got seven women on my mind  
Four that want to own me, two that want to stone me  
One says she's a friend of mine  
Take it easy, take it easy  
Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy  
Lighten up while you still can  
Don't even try to understand  
Just find a place to make your stand, and take it easy  
Well, I'm a standin' on a corner in Winslow, Arizona  
Such a fine sight to see  
It's a girl my Lord in a flat-bed Ford  
Slowin' down to take a look at me  
Come on, baby, don't say maybe  
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me  
We may lose and we may win, though we will never be here again  
So open up I'm climbin' in, so take it easy  
Well, I'm a runnin' down the road tryin' to loosen my load  
Got a world of trouble on my mind  
Lookin' for a lover who won't blow my cover, she's so hard to find  
Take it easy, take it easy  
Don't let the sound of your own wheels make you crazy  
Come on baby, don't say maybe  
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
