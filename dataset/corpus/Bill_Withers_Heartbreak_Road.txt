Wonder who is it waiting for me  
At the end of heartbreak road  
Hope that she'll be tender  
Someone I can know  
  
Hope it just don't  
Don't last forever  
But it's a lonely road  
Road that we all must travel  
Once before we go  
  
I believe that love's a good teacher  
When you're in it  
Even if it don't work out  
  
You ain't gonna never understand it  
Getting all done it  
Hey, hey, Lord, and find out  
What it's all about  
  
That's all right 'cause  
Heartache just don't  
Don't last forever  
But it's a lonely road  
Road that we all must travel  
Once before we go  
  
I believe that love's a good teacher  
And even if it don't work out  
You ain't gonna never understand it  
Till you been all down in it  
And find out what it's all about  
  
That's all right 'cause  
Heartache just don't  
Don't last forever  
But it's a lonely road  
Road that we all must travel  
Once before we go
