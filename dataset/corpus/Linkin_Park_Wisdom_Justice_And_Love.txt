I come to this magnificent house of worship tonight,  
Because my conscience leaves me no other choice.  
A true revolution of values will lay hands on the world order and say of war,  
This way of settling difference is, is not just.  
This business of burning human beings with napalm,  
Filling our nation's homes with orphans and widows,  
Of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into veins of peoples normally humane.  
  
Of sending men home from the dark and bloody battlefields  
Physically handicapped and psychologically deranged,  
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love.  
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love.  
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love.  
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love.  
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love.  
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love.
