You told me goodbye, how was I to know  
You didn't mean goodbye, you meant please don't let me go?  
I was having a high time, living the good life, well I know  
The wheels are muddy, got a ton of hay,  
Now listen here, Baby, 'cause I mean what I say.  
  
I'm having a hard time, living the good life, well I know.  
I was losing time, I had nothing to do,  
No one to fight, I came to you.  
  
Wheels broke down, leader won't draw,  
The line is busted, the last one I saw.  
Tomorrow come trouble, tomorrow come pain,  
Now don't think too hard Baby, 'cause I know what I'm saying.  
  
I could show you a high time, living the good life, don't be that way.  
Nothing's for certain, it could always go wrong,  
Come in when it's raining, go on out when it's gone.  
We could have us a high time, living the good life, well I know.
