I got more cash than I can put in a bank  
Got pink piranhas swimming in my tank  
Two piece bikinis all around my pool  
My 40-ouncer is never not cool  
Frank Sinatra on the radio  
Some chase the rainbow, I chase the gold  
  
Nuthin' changes, it's always the same  
Nuthin' changes, I can't complain  
Nuthin' changes, we roll and we rock  
Nuthin' changes, thank God  
  
I got a yacht parked down in the keys  
I write my name in the sand when I pee  
My body's tanned except for my wrist  
That's where my shiny diamond Rolex is  
Don Williams on the radio  
Brown bag my diamond, take my lobster to go  
  
Nuthin' changes, it's always the same  
Nuthin' changes, I can't complain  
Nuthin' changes, we roll and we rock  
Nuthin' changes, thank God  
  
It's so easy, so warm and breezy  
I'm so lucky to be me  
  
I got a 24 car garage  
I snap my fingers when I want a massage  
Nuthin' but sevens when I roll the dice  
Sometimes it's lonely, but the view is nice  
  
Nuthin' changes, it's always the same  
Nuthin' changes, I can't complain  
Nuthin' changes, we roll and we rock  
Nuthin' changes, thank God  
  
Nuthin' changes, it's always the same  
Nuthin' changes, you won't hear me complain  
Nuthin' changes, we roll and we rock  
Nuthin' changes, thank God
