I'm Violent J  
I breath toxic fumes and throw my lungs up  
all over your brand new patten-leather penny loafers  
You fuck!  
I'm 2dope  
I got sick ass sewer sludge stuck in my throat  
And I live in a big pipe on Sog Island  
So stop by and have a bowl of rust, you fucking bitch-ass faggot  
Faggot, you bitch ass faggot  
I'm in the south-west detroit, Del-ray  
In a city, ghetto street-gang  
I got people who want me dead  
But everytime they run up on me, I get scared  
And my skull explodes  
All over those motherfuckers  
Sometimes I get hungry, man, but it ain't nothing  
But it ain't nothing in the box but a brick sandwich  
So I start hurting that motherfucker  
And I chew on that bitch until my jaw breaks  
Which don't fade me, cause I'm a hoodlum  
And I don't exist to you fucks (you fucks)  
You green-grass fucks  
Fuck me, and I'll fuck you, fucker  
We comin', motherfucker  
We coming to get ya  
Coming to get ya  
How ya see me is what ya get  
How ya see me is what ya get  
Carnival of carnage is coming  
How ya see me is what ya get  
I was snookin' good in my bed  
Woke up to find my brain fell out my head  
Stuffed it back in with a screwdriver, I'm that much liver  
I can walk on my hands on a tight rope  
But then I always fall, and bust my ass.  
But it really don't matter (really don't matter) (don't matter) don't  
matter, cause I'm in the haugh  
In the haugh, in the haugh

(With the wiked town, south west gang, wicked joker's  
kill, southwest thrill)  
Get off me, dog, I'll shit face  
I mean I ain't got shit on my face, but ya know  
People in the suburbs hate me (why?)  
Southwest carnival crazy (hiii)  
My mind ain't nothing but a lemon  
But I mean it's fucking yellow and shit  
I don't know man, fuck off  
You can't fade me, vato, cause I'm in the haugh!

I'm greasy, and I can moonwalk  
But I don't, cause that shit's so fucking played out  
Instead, I just grab this wang, and tell you that I'm in the haugh, bitch!  
Parachute pants, and moon boots  
Chilling on the corner butt-naked hurting fruit loops  
Fuck a hill billy goat  
Sitting in the tub, I let my nuts float, cause I'm in the haugh  
In the haugh, in the haugh
