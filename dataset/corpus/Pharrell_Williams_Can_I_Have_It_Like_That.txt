Ladies and gentlemen,  
Yeszir,  
Let's do it!  
Yeszir,  
  
Yo, On and on and my nuts I'm palming,  
Take two of these and call me in the morning  
You should see the way the chain heart is to charmin'  
Flying like a bird like Nelly Furtado  
Shit pop ya bottles toast to screen cheers!  
Getcha 2-step cuz it's the record of the year  
Nigga that brought you ice creams 2 for a pair,  
Officially announcing that this is warfare  
Cuz back in the day my clouds was grey  
And it seemed like my angels couldn't blow them away  
But then i sold my first verse that cut the NSX  
But i was still ridin' in them thin ass jets,  
But now,  
  
My business so clear out the window of the leer  
And I'm talking on my celly all this shit that you should hear,  
Listen clearly now,  
Hello, can you hear me now?

You got it like that  
Can i have it like that?  
You got it like that  
Can i have it like that?  
You got it like that

So, drop ya purse, and grab ya hips,  
And act like ya tryin' to get this money right quick,  
So can i have it like that?  
You got it like that  
Can i have it like that?  
You got it like that  
  
On and on and this beat is zoning,  
I control the mind straight over the phone,  
Let 'em explore the words something like a tourist,  
They never get addicted unless the headywop is serious  
From Louisdales to Jimmy Choos is real,  
She knows the time she sees the richard mille,  
Flat double skeletal tourbillon  
Its just like her body move it turns her on,  
She like the way my hands use her body for hand warmers,  
And all our car doors go up like Transformers  
See i can do it thisaway i can do it thataway  
From the crib in Viginia to that new Miami getaway  
So cool like new edition that she hollas ya scent,  
I'll get it ok, let it boil away,  
But please run along, cuz ladeez is feelin wrong,  
And I got some right for 'em right after this song  
Cuz my name is Skate-Board-P

On and on and the temperatures warming  
I spit heat flashes, niggaz get nautious,  
Bright as a bitch  
So analyze with caution  
When the light hit the ice bet a 100 that you vomit  
Should i mention the fact the transition is the track  
No one change into the vision just to get me where I'm at  
No skateboy P too grown  
Riding up and down college in that new 2 tone  
It's so cold you dont wanna feel the chill of it, (Uh!)  
Just stand back and just look at the grill of it, (Uh!)  
I don't smoke but i bet the... love it!  
It totally intensifies vivd ass appeal of it,  
  
You could be jealous, and grit ya teeth,  
But all these little nigaas got something in reach  
  
While on my boat party trying to sunseek,  
  
Ladies and gentlemen,  
  
Can i have it like that?  
You got it like that  
Can i have it like that?  
You got it like that  
Can i have it like that?  
You got it like that  
Can i have it like that?  
You got it like that  
  
So, drop ya purse, and grab ya hips,  
And act like ya tryin' to get this money right quick,  
So can i have it like that?  
You got it like that  
Can i have it like that?
