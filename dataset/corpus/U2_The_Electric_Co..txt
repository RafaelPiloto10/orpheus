Boy, stupid boy  
Don't sit at the table  
Until you're able to  
  
Toy, broken toy  
Shout shout  
You're inside out  
  
If you don't know...Electric co.  
If you don't know...Electric co.  
  
Red, running red  
Play for real  
The toy could feel  
A hole in your head  
You go in shock  
You're spoon-fed  
  
If you don't know...Electric co.  
If you don't know...Electric co.  
  
One two three four...  
[vague words]  
  
If you don't know...Electric co.  
[Repeat 6 times]  
  
(more vague words)  
Just to hear me  
(more vague words)  
I've found me way home
