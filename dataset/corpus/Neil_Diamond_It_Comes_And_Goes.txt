It comes and goes  
The feeling I've been feeling  
When she comes it grows  
I know it's just a feeling  
But when she's around  
I get the feeling  
That I'm in some other world  
Like some other girl  
And when she calls her name  
I don't know what it is  
But it's just not the same  
I don't know what's been missing  
But I know it's gone  
I feel it from  
My head way down to my toes  
It comes and goes  
  
She still really cares  
And I'm not being smart  
I might of been imagining all the time  
Who's to say the feeling  
I feel in my heart  
Won't turn out to be all in my mind  
It hurts me  
  
It comes and goes  
It comes and goes  
  
Oh baby  
She still really cares  
And I'm not being smart  
I might of been imagining all the time  
Who's to say the feeling  
I feel in my heart  
Won't turn out to be all in my mind  
  
And yet when we're alone  
She makes me feel like some old toy  
That's been outgrown  
As tho' I were just some old boy  
She hardly known  
I can't help feeling  
How the feeling comes and goes  
She comes and goes with someone new
