There's a fairground down in Chattanooga  
Where a kiddie train runs up and down the track  
There's an old black hound that always hangs around  
And he chases that train down and back  
And I've been chasing you like that Chattanooga dog  
Even though I know you don't care  
I've been chasing you like that Chattanooga dog  
And it ain't gonna get me anywhere  
  
Well I'm thinking that you're like that old train anybody gets a ticket to
ride  
I'm like that pup I won't ever give up I'd do anything to be by your side  
I've been chasing you like that Chattanooga dog...  
  
Every day when the kids come for playing to ride that ole kiddie train once
more  
There's that old faithful hound with his tongue hangin' down  
And runnin' till his feet get sore  
And I've been chasing you like that Chattanooga dog...
