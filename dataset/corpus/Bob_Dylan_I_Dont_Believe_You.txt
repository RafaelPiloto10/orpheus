I can't understand, she let go of my hand  
An' left me here facing the wall  
I'd sure like to know, why she did go  
But I can't get close to her at all  
Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime  
She said she would never forget  
But now morning is clear, it's like I ain't here  
She acts like we never met  
It's all new to me like some mystery  
It could even be like a myth  
Yet it's hard to think on that she's the same one  
That last night I was with  
From darkness, dreams are deserted  
Am I still dreamin' yet?  
I wish she'd unlock her voice once an' talk  
'Stead of acting like we never met  
If she ain't feelin' well then why don't she tell  
'Stead of turnin' her back to my face?  
Without any doubt, she seems too far out  
For me to return to her chase  
Though her skirt it swayed as a guitar played  
Her mouth was watery and wet  
But now something has changed for she ain't the same  
She just acts like we never have met  
If I didn't have to guess, I'd gladly confess  
To anything I might've tried  
If I was with her too long or have done something wrong  
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run an' hide  
Though the night ran swirling an' whirling  
I remember her whispering yet  
But evidently she don't, evidently she won't  
She just acts like we never have met  
I'm leavin' today, I'll be on my way  
Of this I can't say very much  
But if you want me to, I can be just like you  
An' pretend that we never have touched  
An' if anybody asks me, "Is it easy to forget?"  
I'll say, "It's easily done  
You just pick anyone  
An' pretend that you never have met"
