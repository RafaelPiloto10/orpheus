Maybe, I'm right and maybe, I'm wrong  
Maybe, I'm weak or maybe, I'm strong  
Nevertheless, I'm in love with you  
  
Maybe, I'll win or maybe, I'll lose  
Maybe, I'm in for crying the blues  
Nevertheless, I'm in love with you  
  
Somehow I know at a glance  
The terrible chances I'm taking  
Fine at the start that left  
With a heart that is breaking  
  
Maybe, I'll live a life of regret  
And maybe, I'll give much more than I get  
But nevertheless, I'm in love with you  
  
Somehow I know at a glance  
The terrible chances I'm taking  
Fine at the start but then left  
With a heart that's breaking  
  
Maybe, I'll live a life of regret  
And maybe, I'll give much more than I get  
But nevertheless, I'm in love with you  
Nevertheless, I'm in love with you
