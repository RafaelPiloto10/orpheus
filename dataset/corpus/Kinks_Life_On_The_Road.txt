Ever since I was a child,  
I loved to wander wild  
Through the bright city lights,  
And find myself a life I could call my own.  
It was always my ambition  
To see Piccadilly,  
Ramble and roam around Soho  
And Pimlico and Savile Row,  
And walk down the Abbey Road.  
So I saved all my money  
And packed up my clothes,  
And I said good-bye to my friends  
And my folks back home.  
And I left for a life of my own.  
I left for a life on the road.  
  
I'm a real hungry tyke,  
And I know what I like.  
And I know where I'm goin':  
To those bright city lights.  
Oh yeah, oh yeah,  
This time I'm gonna get there.  
I'm bound for a life on the road.  
Give me life on the road.  
I said life on the road.  
  
When I arrived in Euston,  
I was little more than a child.  
And I didn't know then  
That the dives and the dens  
Would be so vulgar and wicked and wild.  
Mama always told me  
The city ladies were bawdy and bold.  
And so I searched night and day  
To catch a kissable lady,  
But all that I caught was a cold,  
'Cause those stuck-up city ladies  
Didn't notice me walk by.  
Now I've got holes in my shoes  
'Cause I've been walkin' the streets all night.  
And I'm livin' the life that I chose.  
Livin' my life on the road.  
I said life on the road.  
I want life on the road.  
Life on the road.  
  
I was standing with the punks in Praed Street,  
When a muscle man came my way.  
He said,
