You think I'm crazy for wanting you  
But you just hide away  
Behind your untold truths  
And so I sit and  
Listen to your lonely words  
Another reason for you  
To be yourself  
I can't be wrong for believing in you  
'cause this ice is melting  
And the waves are breaking through  
I see a fire, it's burning  
In your heart tonight  
There's only one way  
For me to forget  
All for one, one for all  
Strong in heart, body and soul  
We were all for one, one for all  
All for one, one for all  
Nothing could stop us, we had it all  
We were all for one, one for all  
I always knew  
You had dreams of your own  
But I can't understand you  
So many words, too much to say  
And nothing to hold on to  
And so another day must end  
In this loneliness  
Another season  
Another time, I guess  
All for one, we were all for one  
All for one, strong in body and soul  
All for one, and  
Nothing's gonna stop us  
All for one, one for all ...
