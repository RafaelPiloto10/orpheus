You've got me girl on the run around run around  
You've got me all around town  
You've got me girl on the run around  
And it's getting me down, getting me down  
Lady if you want to find a lover  
Then you look no further  
For I'm gonna be your only  
Searching at the start of the season  
And my only reason  
Is that I'll get to you  
I'll find some way of connection  
Hiding my intention  
Then I'll move up close to you  
I'll use you and I'll confuse you  
And the I'll lose you  
Still you won't suspect me
