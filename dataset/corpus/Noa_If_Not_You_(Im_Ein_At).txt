What is broken or ready to break  
Who is asleep and who stays awake  
Who lives with all of memory's ache?  
  
Who has gone and who stayed still  
Who looked back, and who never will  
Who is empty, who can fill?  
  
Who is blind and who reflects  
Who has sworn and who defects  
Who can sleep and who protects?  
  
Who has made it all so clear  
Who has lost and who will cheer  
Who kept still, erased the tear?  
  
If not you,  
Who will do?  
Who will do for you, if not you?  
  
Be strong, be strong!!  
Lift your chin up high!  
That way your tears go no further than your cheek..  
Take care, take care  
Of the thunder in your sky!  
The spark in your eye  
Always keep!  
  
If not you,  
Who will do?  
Who will do for you, if not you?  
Never soft or tender,  
No brother or mender will render your fall without pain  
If not you,  
Who will do?  
If not you,  
Who?
