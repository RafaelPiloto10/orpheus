I can count it on my fingers  
I've got all my reasons not to feel  
I'm numb as rigor mortis  
Scared by monkey faces  
Drowned in shark fins  
  
But I don't feel like feeling  
Feeling like you  
  
Now I'm in the mirror  
Now it's getting clear  
I fear that I'm in you  
Now I'm into plastics  
Now I've made a mask  
It looks like fish heads  
  
But I don't feel like feeling  
Feeling like you  
  
Face pollution [Repeat: x4]
