What we're looking at here is a harder situation  
Let me make it quite clear  
There must be no hesitation  
Either you're with me or you're not  
Are we gonna lose a love we got?  
  
When I called you last night  
Words got tangled in the wires  
It was hanging me up  
Wondering which one was the liar  
But if you want honesty from me  
This is the way it's got to be, ooh  
  
Heart to heart we should be  
Like a melody in harmony  
Heart to heart, can't you see  
We're a rhapsody, baby, you and me  
Heart to heart, heart to heart to heart.  
  
Open your eyes  
Can't you see that you're in danger  
Say it goodbye, turning lovers into strangers  
We'd be fools if let this go  
And all we gotta do is let the feelings flow, ooh.  
  
Heart to heart '  
  
Hurting one another is the easy thing to do  
You turn your back on love and walk away  
We can make it right, we can start tonight  
If you only knew it's right before your eyes  
When will you realize'
