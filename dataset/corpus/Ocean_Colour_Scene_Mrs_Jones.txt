What are you going to do today Mrs Jones  
Are you going to chase the pain away Mrs Jones  
Or leave it sitting there waiting outside your door  
Hoping to find the things you hoped would tell you more  
About the dreams that seem to slip away  
  
What are you going to do today Mrs Jones  
Are you going to face the bills to pay Mrs Jones  
Or leave them sitting there waiting outside your door  
Hoping to find the things you hoped would tell you more  
About the dreams that seem to slip away  
  
It's not as if Mr Jones could help in anyway  
It's not as if Mr Jones the bills that he could pay
