(Verse)  
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand  
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand  
I'm a longway from home and I miss my loved one so  
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go  
  
Cut on runway number nine, big 707 set to go  
I'm stuck here on the grass, with the pain that ever grows  
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast  
Well, there she goes, my friend, she's rolling down at last  
  
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high  
She's away and westward bound, far above the cloud she'll fly  
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines  
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours time  
  
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me  
Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunk as I might be  
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train  
So I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain
