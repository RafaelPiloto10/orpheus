I've gone through changes  
I've gone through pain  
But there's not enough reason for me to go insane  
I know the feeling, when it grows  
I'm in a rage up from my head down to my toes.  
  
You know it ain't easy  
Running out of thrills  
You know it ain't easy  
When you don't know what you want.  
  
Rock now, rock the night  
'Til early in the morning light  
Rock now, rock the night  
You'd better believe it's right.  
  
I know my limit  
Just what it takes  
When things ain't good enough  
I just pull the brake  
Sometimes it's easy  
Sometimes so tough  
But just have one thing clear  
I can't get enough.
