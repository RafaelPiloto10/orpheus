How can I forget the night we met?  
I can still remember what you wore.  
I had the strangest feeling like we'd met before.  
Maybe it was something that you said.  
How can I forget the night we met?  
  
How can I forget when we first touched?  
Never thought that I would want someone so much.  
I looked in your eyes and then I knew for sure  
You would be my love forevermore.  
As you slept, I kept thinking of the night we met.  
  
Memories come and go like a dream lost in the night,  
But I remember everything about you,  
How you came and changed my life.  
  
And how can I forget those wedding bells?  
You looked like an angel, I remember well  
How we danced all night and never touched the ground.  
How can I forget the night we met?  
  
Memories come and go like a dream lost in the night,  
But I remember everything about you,  
How you came and changed my life.  
  
How can I forget your greatest gift?  
I swore I saw your eyes when I first looked at his,  
And when you cried, the tears were falling from my eyes  
As I held our baby, held on to his first breath.  
How can I forget the first night that we met?  
And how can I forget that night?  
How can I forget the night we met
