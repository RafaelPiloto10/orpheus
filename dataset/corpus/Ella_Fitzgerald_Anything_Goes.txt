Times have changed  
And we've often rewound the clock  
Since the Puritans got a shock  
When they landed on Plymouth Rock.  
But today, any shock they should try to stand,  
'Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock,  
Plymouth Rock would land on them.  
  
In olden days a glimpse of stocking  
Was looked on as something shocking  
Now, heaven knows, anything goes  
  
Good authors too who once knew better words  
Now only use four letter words writing  
Prose  
Anything goes  
  
The world has gone mad today  
And good's bad today  
And black's white today  
And day's night today  
When most guys today that women prize today  
Are just silly gigolos  
  
And though I'm  
Not a great romancer  
I know what I'm bound to answer  
When you propose, anything goes
