Wrapped in a blanket of hope  
Asleep in the of dreams  
My step into eternity was not what it might have been  
Or not at all  
For who knows which way the wind is gonna blow  
I'm waiting for your gentle whisper  
  
Distant child, my flower  
Are you blowing in the breeze?  
Can you feel me?  
As I breathe life into you  
In a while my flower  
Somewhere in a desert haze  
I know one day you'll amaze me  
  
An act of balancing, imagining the moment I can be  
Looking deep into your eyes  
For now a mystery  
Or not at all  
For who knows which way the wind is gonna blow  
I'm waiting for your gentle whisper  
  
Distant child, my flower  
Are you blowing in the breeze?  
Can you feel me?  
As I breathe life into you  
In a while my flower  
Somewhere in a desert haze  
I know one day you'll amaze me  
  
2 hearts in the hands of time  
Your love bleeds into mine  
I'll be with you forever  
And give you everything I am  
Want you to understand  
It's you and I together  
  
Distant child, my flower  
Are you blowing in the breeze?  
Can you feel me?  
As I breathe life into you  
In a while my flower  
Somewhere in a desert haze  
I know one day you'll amaze me
