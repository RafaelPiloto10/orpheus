So long big city  
It's time to say goodbye  
I'm longing for those country roads  
I need to see the sky  
Think I'll take a swing down south  
Visit Tennessee  
See if that girl Annie  
Still remembers me  
  
Gonna take that blue highway  
And leave this sorry town  
Stayed too long, but now I'm gone  
And I know where I'm bound  
I don't want to take the interstate  
It represents all the things I hate  
I'm rolling down that blue highway  
  
So long confusion  
It's time to slow things down  
Say goodbye to my old friends  
Ease on out of town  
I made me some money here  
I paid for every day  
And every mile just makes me smile  
'Cause I've made my getaway  
  
Gonna take that blue highway  
And leave this sorry town  
Stayed too long, but now I'm gone  
And I know where I'm bound  
I've had it up to here with worry  
From now on I'm in no hurry  
Rolling down that blue highway  
  
I'll be rolling down that blue highway  
You can find me on that blue highway
