Mom and dad are goin' out for the evening  
And you're stuck inside the house all alone  
That's when you decided it might be fun to harass someone  
Dial a random number up on your telephone  
You ask if their refrigerator is running  
Then you tell 'em they should go out and catch it  
Buddy, if they ever figured out where you were callin' 'em from  
They'd come and bust your head right in with a ratchet  
Listen to me  
Don't go makin' phony calls  
Please stick to the seven-digit numbers you're used to  
I know that you think it's funny drivin' folks up the wall  
But it's really gettin' old fast  
Little Melvin has a natural obsession  
Askin' for Prince Albert in a can  
He gets a kick each time he makes a collect call  
To some guy he doesn't know who lives in Japan  
He's callin' strangers up at three in the morning  
Gives 'em pizza pie delivery at four  
He won't be laughin when they're tracin' his line  
One day the phone police will be there at his door  
Yo, hear me  
Don't go makin' phony calls  
Only dial the seven-digit numbers you're used to  
Swear someday I'm gonna yank that phone cord right out from the wall  
How long is this phase gonna last?  
Come on Moe's bar, what'll ya eat, beat or drink?  
Uh, yeah, hello, is Mike there?  
Last name Rotch.  
Hold on. I'll check.  
Mike Rotch! Mike Rotch!  
Hey, has anybody seen Mike Rotch lately?  
Listen to me, you little puke.  
One of these days, I'm going to catch you,  
And I'm going to carve my name on your back with an ice pick!  
Don't go makin' phony calls  
Please stick to the seven-digit numbers you're used to  
You went through the New York City phone book and prank called 'em all  
Hope that you grow out of this fast  
Dont' go makin' phony calls,  
Please stick to the seven-digit numbers you're used to  
Betcha think it's funny when you're drivin' folks right up the wall  
But you're just a pain in the aaa....
