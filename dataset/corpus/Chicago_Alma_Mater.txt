Looking back a few short years  
When we made our plans and played the cards  
The way they fell  
Clinging to our confidence  
We stood on the threshold of the goal  
That we knew, dear  
And though we had our fights  
Had our short tempered nights  
It couldn't pull our dreams apart  
All our needs and all our wants  
Drawn together in our heart  
We felt it from the very start  
It's all happened recently  
Now we're living in that dream  
We had not long ago  
Everything is going fine  
And now we just have to keep in mind  
We must set brand new goals  
We must not lose control  
Of the possibility of a new discovery  
That would let everybody see  
That we were just meant to be
