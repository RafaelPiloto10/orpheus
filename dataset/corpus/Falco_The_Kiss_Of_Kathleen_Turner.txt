Train sounds and coughing I always take the 7:30 AM train  
Going to Brasil City  
Well, at this hour of the day, I'm not too well humored  
'Cause life doesn't show any pity  
You're always complaining 'bout yourself  
And putting things down in the world  
Just take a good look at Kathleen Turner  
Now there's one heck of a girl  
  
I've been to hell and back but I'm alright Jack  
Now I know what love is about  
Under the seven moons  
I made a solemn vow  
I need the kiss of Kathleen Turner right now  
I need the kiss of Kathleen Turner right now  
Smack! In the middle  
  
Female voice on telephone: "Hello?"  
"Oh it's me, I know it's late  
But I just had to call you  
I'll be over real soon"  
  
"Kathleen Kathleen"  
  
Is this a dream, or is it real  
Is this really happening to me  
Or is this just fantasy?  
In this world there's only one woman  
Who can make my dreams my dreams come true  
And that woman Kathleen  
It's you  
  
Standing on the corner watching all the girls go by  
He wants a kiss  
Not just one, I want lots of kisses  
He wants a kiss  
Standing on the corner watching all the girls go by  
He wants a kiss  
  
Hallelujah, he's in love  
Hallelujah, glory, glory

Kathleen, can you hear me babe  
Kathleen, do you know what I'm talking about  
I'm just talking about  
Not the first kiss of my life  
I'm talking about, our planet  
Kathleen!
