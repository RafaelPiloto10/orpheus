Joey rides the subway  
Fast from east to west  
On the street he's number one  
Some say that he's the best  
Got something going on  
In a honkey tonk down town  
He is expected  
Word has got around  
  
The other-side of midnight  
Or in the combat zone  
Meeting no resistance  
Joe stands alone  
  
Night riders prowling  
Out into the night  
There's someone else out there  
And they're looking for a fight  
  
Between the rain soaked buildings  
A distant whistle blows  
Fate lies in waiting  
It's hand it never shows  
  
[Chorus]  
Heart beating like a drum  
Out in this wasteland  
And there's no place baby for us to run  
(In) Jungle land (baby)  
Jungle land, jungle land  
Jungle land. jungle land  
  
Under the railway arches  
Someone calls his name  
Streams out the words  
Come on boy this ain't no game  
  
One flash of bright cold stsel  
In a stranger's hand  
Kids dance away like shadows  
There's no one to command  
  
Joey's got his name  
Pairited on the wells  
On the side of buses  
Subways and tenement halls  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Jungle land, jungle land  
Jungle land, jungle land  
Jungle land, jungle land  
Jungle land, jungle land
