Read it in the papers, it ain't fair  
You know who today don't seem to care  
Livin' lovin' gettin' loose  
Masturbatin' with a noose  
Now someone's kickin' out the chair  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Some kind of Voodoo  
Come across this land  
Some kind of Voodoo  
We need a medicine man  
Everybody's lookin' at the sky  
Can't believe the cover ups and lies  
They been tellin' us since birth  
Pissin' off old Mother Earth  
My gones are by-gones prophesized  
Come on  
Some kind of Voodoo  
Come across this land  
Some kind of Voodoo  
We need a medicine man  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Wonder should I go or should I stay  
What we got ain't working any way  
I did my best, God knows I've tried  
I feel like I've been crucified  
Why did you, why did you,  
Why did you take it all away  
Voodoo, Voodoo, Medicine Man...
