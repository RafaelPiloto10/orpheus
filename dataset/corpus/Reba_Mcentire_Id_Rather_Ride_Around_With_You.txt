My cousin's gettin' married at the Methodist church  
That's why I stayed home from work  
I'm supposed to hold the flowers  
When the new bride kisses the groom  
That's what I'm supposed to do  
So what are we doin' with the windows rolled down  
Twenty five passionate miles from town  
I love ?er like a sister baby, but to tell you the truth  
I'd rather ride around with you  
  
The guy she's gonna marry's got money to burn  
His daddy's a partner in some big law firm  
Yeah, that's how they're goin'  
To Hawaii on their honeymoon  
First class to Honolulu  
She ain't ever even set foot on a jet  
I'm a little bit jealous I confess  
I'd like to fly to Hawaii but honey if I had to choose  
I'd rather ride around with you  
  
I don't care where this road goes  
No I don't wanna turn around  
Let go of the wheel and feel the wind blow  
Don't even think about slowin' down  
  
They're tyin' tin cans to the back of the car  
Wonderin' where in the world we are  
The preacher's done prayin'  
And the couple's done sayin' I do  
That could be me and you  
There's way too many decisions to make  
The length of the dress, the layers on the cake  
One of these days I might get married too  
But I'd rather ride around with you  
  
I don't care where this road goes  
No I don't wanna turn around  
Let go of the wheel and feel the wind blow  
Don't even think about slowin' down
