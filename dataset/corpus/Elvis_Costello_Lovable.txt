[Chorus:]  
It's going round the town  
It's going round the town  
It's going round the town  
You're so lovable  
  
My baby gave me notice to quit  
I just can't get used to it  
She broke my little heart in two  
Now somebody else is being the same old you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My baby has Egyptian eyes  
And a wicked look beyond compare  
If you thought I was a fool for you  
Then I must be a bigger fool for her  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He'd turn the flowers of springtime into a wreath  
He says he'd love you eternally  
I say please please can't you keep it brief  
  
They say they're going to bury you  
Because you're so lovable  
Put your money where your mouth was  
You're so lovable  
Each tender mumble brings us closer to bedlam  
You're so lovable  
The toast of the town and the talk of the bedroom  
You're so lovable  
  
You're so sweet  
You're so honest  
You say 'I'll be true to you boy'  
But I won't promise  
Then you say you love me  
Then you show me  
As you lie there so lifelike below me  
  
[Chorus]
