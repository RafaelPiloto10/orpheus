Asked my girl what she wanted from me  
She said everything that I can see  
I said baby what d'you think of me  
And she said nothing at all  
  
So I sit here waiting patiently  
To see if there will be a change or three  
I think that baby she is using me  
It doesn't matter at all  
And now I'm wondering which way to go  
  
So it's a hard time for us all 'til she gets it right  
Yes it's a hard time for us all, be some kind of fight  
She makes the same excuse for making all the same mistakes again  
  
Now I think of all the times we had  
Yeah, of all the good and all the bad  
I sometimes think that maybe I've been had  
It doesn't matter at all  
And now I'm wondering which way to go  
  
So it's a hard time for us all 'til she gets it right  
Yes it's a hard time for us all, be some kind of fight  
She makes the same excuse for making all the same mistakes again

So it's a hard time for us all 'til she gets it straight  
Yes it's a hard time for us all, hope she's not too late  
She makes the same excuse for making all the same mistakes again,  
again, again  
Oh it's a hard time for us all 'til she gets it right  
Yes, it's a hard time for us all, be some kind of fight  
She makes the same excuse for making all the same mistakes again  
and again  
Oh, it's a hard time, yes, it's a hard, hard time  
Now, it's a hard time, yes, it's a hard, hard time  
A hard, hard time  
A hard, hard time
