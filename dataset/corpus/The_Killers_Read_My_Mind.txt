On the corner of main street  
Just tryin' to keep it in line  
You say you wanna move on, and  
You say I'm falling behind  
  
Can you read my mind?  
Can you read my mind?  
  
I never really gave up on  
Breakin' out of this two-star town  
I got the green light  
I got a little fight  
I'm gonna turn this thing around  
  
Can you read my mind?  
Can you read my mind?  
  
The good old days, the honest man  
The restless heart, the Promised Land  
A subtle kiss that no one sees  
A broken wrist and a big trapeze  
  
Oh well, I don't mind, you don't mind  
Cause I don't shine if you don't shine  
Before you go, can you read my mind?  
  
It's funny how you just break down  
Waiting on some sign  
I pull up to the front of your driveway  
With magic soaking my spine  
  
Can you read my mind?  
Can you read my mind?  
  
The teenage queen, the loaded gun  
The drop dead dream, the Chosen One  
A southern drawl, the world unseen  
A city wall and a trampoline  
  
Oh well, I don't mind, you don't mind  
'Cause I don't shine if you don't shine  
Before you jump  
Tell me what you find  
When you read my mind  
  
Slipping in my faith until I fall  
He never returned that call  
Woman, open the door, don't let it sting  
I wanna breathe that fire again  
  
She said, I don't mind, you don't mind  
Cause I don't shine if you don't shine  
Put your back on me  
Put your back on me  
Put your back on me  
  
The stars are blazing like rebel diamonds cut out of the sun  
When you read my mind
