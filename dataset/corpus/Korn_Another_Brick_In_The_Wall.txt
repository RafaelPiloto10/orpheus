Daddy's flown across the ocean  
Leaving just a memory  
A snapshot in the family album  
Daddy, what else did you leave for me?  
Daddy, whatcha leave behind for me?  
All in all it was just a brick in the wall  
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall  
  
We don't need no education  
We don't need no thought control  
No dark sarcasm in the classroom  
Teachers leave them kids alone  
Hey teachers  
Leave those kids alone  
All in all it's just another brick in the wall  
All in all you're just another brick in the wall  
  
We don't need no education  
We don't need no thought control  
No dark sarcasm in the classroom  
Teachers leave them kids alone  
Hey teachers  
Leave those kids alone  
All in all you're just another brick in the wall  
All in all you're just another brick in the wall  
  
I don't need no arms around me  
I don't need no drugs to calm me  
I have seen the writing on the wall  
Don't think I need anything at all  
No, don't think I'll need anything at all  
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall  
All in all you were all just bricks in the wall  
  
Goodbye cruel world  
I'm leaving you today  
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye  
Goodbye all you people  
There's nothing you can say  
To make me change my mind  
Goodbye
