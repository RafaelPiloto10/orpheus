Many Roads I've Travelled  
And Faces I've Seen  
Each Tells A Story  
Of What Might Have Been  
A Missed Golden Moment  
But Life Still Remains  
A Search For The Innocence  
Somehow We Lost On The Way  
  
And We All Need A Miracle, That I Truly Believe  
Yes We All Need A Miracle, And I Believe My Miracle Is You  
  
Now The Silence That Follows  
The Last Curtain Call  
I Don't Know Anyone  
Who Has Come Through It All  
You Gave Me Direction  
A Part In Your Cast  
No Longer Make Believe  
Now That I Know It Will Last  
  
'cause We All Need A Miracle, That I Truly Believe  
Yes We All Need A Miracle, And I Believe My Miracle  
  
And I Believe My Miracle  
I Believe My Miracle  
Yes I Believe My Miracle Is You
