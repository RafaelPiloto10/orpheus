Jenny's got a job, a cat named Jake,  
Thirty one candles on her birthday cake  
Next year  
Thought by now she'd have a man  
Two car seats and a minivan  
But it still ain't here (hey!)  
  
She's been lookin' for Mr. Right so long  
But all she's found is Mr. Wrong  
And that's the pits  
She's drawn a line that she won't cross  
Her and time are facing off  
She says something's gotta give  
  
[Chorus]  
Something's gotta give me butterflies  
Something's gotta make me feel alive  
Something's gotta give me dreams at night  
Something's gotta make me feel alright  
I don't know where it is  
But something's gotta give  
  
Friday night she had a date  
Cell phone junky a half hour late  
That's the biz baby  
She's riding out of this twist of fate  
She's had all that she can take  
She says something's gotta give  
  
Something's gotta give me butterflies  
Something's gotta make me feel alive  
Yeah something's gotta give me dreams at night  
Something's gotta make me feel alright  
I don't know where it is  
But something's gotta give  
  
I swear  
There's got to be a meant to be for me out there  
Somewhere someday  
I'm gonna find someone, somehow, someway  
Yea yeah, ah ah  
  
Jenny's got a job, a cat named Jake,  
Thirty one candles on her birthday cake  
Next year  
  
Oh she thought by now she'd have a man  
Two car seats and a minivan  
She says something's got,  
Something's got,  
Something's got  
  
Something's gotta give me butterflies  
Something's gotta make me feel alive  
Yeah something's gotta give me dreams at night  
Something's gotta make me feel alright  
I don't know what it is  
But something's gotta  
I don't know where it is  
But something's gotta  
I don't know what it is  
Yeah but something's gotta give  
Ah something's got to give
