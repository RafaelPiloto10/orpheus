Raised by pedestrian wolves, out in the forest  
Raised by pedestrian wolves, out in the forest  
I was left to fend for myself  
I was left in a basket, just like baby Moses  
To float down that muddy river  
Protected by the stupid little fairies  
  
I floated for nine days and nights  
I floated for nine days and nights  
'Till I came to the city  
Bright lights and all the fine ladies  
Come on out all you bright fine ladies  
I like you just like you are,  
And I love you, kind of,  
Just like you are, and I love you  
Like a sticky piece of cotton candy  
In this bright red cotton candy, candy world  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I'm so excited, about the prospects of meeting with a  
Stranger in an alley, I'm so excited. I hope they're rough, I hope their  
Skin is Tough like Spanish leather  
Can't wait until their dull, dead eyes meet mine  
I can't wait until their dull, dead eyes meet mine  
Raised by pedestrian wolves, out in the forest  
Raised by suburban lions, out in the jungle  
  
We really like to run in packs- and I like that  
When we hunt, we all function with one mind  
Our collective predications are as sharp as the  
Razor in my pocket, and as dull as the ice  
Melting slowly in my glass  
My only love is the love of oblivion, in a dark room  
With as couple of pedestrian wolves  
So artfully backlit by a solitary candle  
I take my pleasure in soft red clouds of desire  
So funky in this unwashed bed for one with the soft red dreams of oblivion  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I'm so excited 'cause soon I'll hit the streets  
I am the crown prince of pavement, I'm so excited  
Under the sheltering skin  
Stretched out so pale and thin  
There is an ocean of bright red liquid love  
And that, my friend, is my favorite color  
Raised by pedestrian wolves out in the forest  
And I take my pleasure on a soft red cloud  
And I take my pleasure in the monkey's bed  
And the wolves still howl and the light still glowing red  
And I take my pleasure in a blue steel cage  
And I take my pleasure through the monkey's eye  
And the wolves all howl while the world around me dies  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I'm so excited, about the prospects of meeting with a stranger  
In an alley, I'm so excited. I hope they're rough, I hope their skin is tough  
Like Spanish leather  
Raised by pedestrian wolves out in the forest  
Raised by pedestrian wolves - out in the forest  
I was left to fend for myself  
I was left in as basket - just like baby Moses  
To float down that Muddy River  
Protected by all those stupid little fairies  
I floated for nine days and nights 'til I came to the city  
Bright lights and all the fine ladies  
Come on out all you bright, fine ladies  
I like you just like you are, and I love you, kind of,  
Just like you are in this bright red cotton candy, candy world  
Raised by pedestrian wolves...
