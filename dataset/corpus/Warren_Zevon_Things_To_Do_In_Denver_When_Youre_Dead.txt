I called up my friend LeRoy on the phone  
I said, Buddy, I'm afraid to be alone  
I got some weird ideas in my head  
About things to do in Denver when you're dead  
  
I was working on a steak the other day  
I saw Waddy in the Rattlesnake Cafe  
Dressed in black, tossing back a shot of rye  
Finding things to do in Denver when you die  
  
You won't need a cab to find a priest  
Maybe you should find a place to stay  
Some place where they never change the sheets  
And you just roll around Denver all day  
  
LeRoy says there's something you should know  
Not everybody has a place to go  
And home is just a place to hang your head  
And dream up things to do in Denver when you're dead  
  
You won't need a cap to find a priest  
Maybe you should find a place to stay  
Some place where they never change the sheets  
And you jut roll around Denver all day  
  
You just roll around Denver all day
