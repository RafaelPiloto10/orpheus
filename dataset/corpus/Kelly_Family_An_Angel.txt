I wish I had your pair of wings  
Had them last night in my dreams  
I was chasing butterflies  
Till the sunrise broke my eyes  
Tonight the sky has glued my eyes  
Cause what they see's an angel hive  
I've got to touch that magic sky  
And geet the angels in their hive  
Refrain  
Sometimes I wish I were an angel  
Sometimes I wish I were you  
Sometimes I wish I were an angel  
Sometimes I wish I were you  
And all the sweet honey from above  
Pour it all over me sweet love  
And while you're flying around my head  
Your honey kisses keep me fed  
I wish I had your pair of wings  
Just like last night in my dreams  
I was lost in paradise  
Wish I'd never opened my eyes  
Refrain  
Sometimes I wish I were an angel  
Sometimes I wish I were you  
Sometimes I wish I were an angel  
Sometimes I wish I were you  
But there's danger in the air  
Tryin'so hard to be unfair  
Danger's in the air  
Tryin' so hard to give us a scare  
But we're not afraid  
Refrain x 2  
Oh I wish I were you
