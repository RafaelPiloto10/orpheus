Heaven  
Is the home of all hearts  
And heaven  
Won't tear you apart  
  
Yeah,heaven  
Is the home of all hearts  
And heaven  
Don't tear you apart  
  
There's too many cares  
Want to hold you down  
And the world is a window  
Gone underground  
  
There's a hole in the sky  
Where the sun don't shine  
And the clock on the wall  
And it counts my time  
  
Heaven  
Is the home of all hearts  
And heaven  
Don't tear you apart  
  
There's a song on the air  
With a long pure line  
And a face in the glass  
And it looks like mine  
  
And I'm standing on ice  
When I say that I don't hear planes  
want to scream at walls  
I want to jump my chain  
  
Heaven  
Let me take you up  
Take you higher  
Take you up to the place  
  
Where you're gonna find peace  
Peace in your heart  
Peace in your heart  
You won't have to suffer  
  
You won't suffer  
There's a place in your heart  
Place in your heart  
Where there's peace  
  
Peace in your heart  
Peace in your heart
