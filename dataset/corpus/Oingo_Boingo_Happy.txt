Don't got a pretty girl who loves me a lot  
Don't got a fast car that looks real hot  
Don't got a fine pad or stereo  
And I don't do well in the school where I go, go, go, go, go  
  
But I'm happy, happy  
I'm happy though the world is upside down  
I'm happy that we all made it through another day  
When I pick up the phone I still remember what to say  
I'm happy that my brain still lives inside my head  
Most of all I think I'm happy  
Happy that I ain't dead  
  
I read the paper, I saw the news  
All those people out there singin' the blues  
They get excited, why don't they just relax  
All we got to do is kick back, back, back  
  
And be happy, happy  
Happy though the whole world is ready to blow  
I'm happy that I made it through another day  
When I pick up the phone I still remember what to say  
I'm happy that my brain still lives inside my head  
Most of all I think I'm happy  
Happy that I ain't dead  
  
I know a guy with plenty of loot  
You'd never catch him in a two dollar suit  
He's got gold chains, plenty of rings  
He told me money, it don't mean a thing, don't mean a thing  
If you ain't happy, happy  
Happy though the whole world is upside down  
Be happy that you made it through another day  
When you pick up the phone you still remember what to say  
Be happy that your brain still lives inside your head  
Most of all I think I'm happy.....  
  
I'm happy  
I'm happy though the whole thing is ready to blow  
Be happy that the sun has rised up again  
That somewhere in this world I still got a friend  
Be happy that the big one, it hasn't dropped yet  
Be happy that you still got something  
Something, something to forget  
I'm happy  
  
(I'm happy, so happy)
