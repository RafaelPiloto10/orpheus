Mommies and daddys always believe  
That their little angels are special indeed  
And you could grow up to be anything  
But who would imagine a king  
  
A shepherd or teacher is what you could be  
Or maybe a fisherman out on the sea  
Or maybe a carpenter building things  
But who would imagine a king  
  
It was so clear when the wise men arrived  
And the angels were singing your name  
That the world would be different 'cause you were alive  
That's what heaven stood to proclaim  
  
One day an angel said quietly  
That soon he would bring something special to me  
And of all those wonderful gifts he bring  
  
Who would imagine, who could imagine  
Who would imagine a king
