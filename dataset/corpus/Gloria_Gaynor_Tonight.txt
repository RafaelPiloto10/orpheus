Tonight, tonight,  
Won't be just any night,  
Tonight there will be no morning star.  
Tonight, tonight,  
I'll see my love tonight!  
And for us, stars will stop where they are.  
Today The minutes seem like hours,  
The hours go so slowly,  
And still the sky is light.  
Oh moon, grow bright,  
And make this endless day endless night!  
Tonight... no morning star.  
Tonight...Tonight  
Today The minutes seem like hours,  
The hours go so slowly,  
And still the sky is light.  
Oh moon, grow bright,  
And make this endless day endless night!  
Tonight... tonight...tonight  
Tonight will be no morning star  
Tonight... tonight  
I'll see my love tonight  
And for us, stars will stop right where they are.  
Today The minutes seem like hours,  
The hours go so slowly,  
And still the sky is light.  
Oh moon, grow bright,  
And make this endless day endless night!  
Tonight...  
Tonight...  
Tonight...  
Tonight...
