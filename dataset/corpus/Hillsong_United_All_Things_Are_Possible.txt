Almighty God, my Redeemer,  
My Hiding Place, my Safe Refugee,  
No other name like Jesus,  
No power can stand against You.  
  
My feet are planted on this rock,  
And I will not be shaken,  
My hope it comes from You alone,  
My Lord and my Salvation.  
  
Your praise is always on my lips,  
Your Word is living in my heart,  
And I will praise You with a new song,  
My soul will bless You Lord.  
You fill my life with greater joy,  
Yes, I delight myself in You,  
And I will praise You with a new song,  
My soul will bless You Lord.  
  
When I am weak You make me strong,  
When I'm poor, I know I'm rich,  
For in the power of Your name.  
All things are possible,  
All things are possible,  
All things are possible,  
All things are possible!
