Well there's news flying 'round  
On the rosy side of town  
That I have gone and found somebody new  
Well ?  
Against the way some people talk  
I guess sometimes it's all they have to do  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh there ain't no such thing  
As me not loving you  
Honey there ain't no such thing  
As me not being true  
So believe your heart and not your ears  
Your heart knows what is true  
There's no such thing  
As me not loving you  
  
Well a love like yours and mine  
Has got to deal with the jealous kind  
But I don't mind there's nothing I can do  
Cause their words can do no harm  
With you here in my arms  
So they can talk until their talk turn blue  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(There ain't no such thing as me not loving you)
