Love, now that you're gone,  
I just can't carry on,  
Love left a space,  
I can't erase that face,  
Love that I knew gone like the morning dew,  
What will I do without her.  
  
Love, where is she now,  
I sit and think of how,  
She used to be,  
Happy to be with me,  
Love that I knew gone like the morning dew,  
What will I do without her.  
  
Love, left me for good,  
I never thought she would,  
Now I'm alone,  
Wondering where she's gone,  
Love that I knew gone like the morning dew,  
What will I do without her.
