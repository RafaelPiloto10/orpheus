How long can you stand  
Tightening up  
Avoiding the fight  
Avoiding the truth  
Tighten the smile  
Tighten the lie  
Will you get what you want  
To be cursed with your dreams  
I hope for your sake  
Something gets in the way  
  
How long can you stand  
Living under the lens  
The kiss of success  
The ensuing, all consuming, mess  
  
Message of love  
They arrive everyday  
People you touch  
Wasting away  
People you don't know  
Give you no choice  
  
And you're sick to your stomach  
At the sound of your voice  
And the shape of your face  
And the sound of your name  
They send you pictures of yourself  
It's someone you don't know  
And they call you a genius  
Cause you're easier to sell  
But the fire in your belly  
That gave you the songs  
Is suddenly gone  
And you feel like a fake  
Is that what you want?  
  
I hope for your sake  
You've got what it takes  
You've got what it takes  
To be spoilt to death.
