I'm just a singer  
A natural born guitar ringer  
Kind of an old clinger  
To sad old songs  
  
I'm not a walk behinder  
I'm a new note finder  
But my names a reminder  
Of a blues man that's already gone  
  
So I started drinkin  
And took things that messed up my thinkin'  
I was sure sinkin'  
When you came along  
  
I was alone in the hotlight  
Not too much left in sight  
But she changed all that in one night  
When she sang me this song  
  
"Hey baby, I love you  
Hey baby, I need you  
Hey baby, you ain't gotta prove to me your some kind of macho man  
You wasted so much of your life  
Runnin through the dark night  
Let me shine some love light  
Down on a blues man"  
  
I got so sick of speed  
And all the stuff they said I was needin  
If I was to keep pleasin to all of my fans  
I got cuffed on dirt roads  
I got sued for no-shows  
But you came and took all that old load down on this blues man  
  
"Hey baby, I love you too  
Hey baby, I need you  
Hey baby, I do get tired of this travelin band  
I'm thirty years old now  
Nights would be cold now  
If you wouldn't have stuck it out  
With this blues man"  
  
I'm thirty years old now  
Night sure would be cold now  
If you hadn't stuck it out  
With this blues man
