You say the end of time is coming far too near  
My love for life is torn in vain through all the years  
What's the answer to the question  
That we have been searching for  
Can you tell?  
  
Don't want to fall apart before we have a chance  
To try again  
Don't let it end  
  
I tried so hard to make it right for you and I  
Your sacred promises have all become a lie  
  
Is this your idea of destiny?  
'Cause if it is, just set me free  
  
You can not fool me with your stories being told  
My God it brings me down, I feel I'm growing old  
  
Is this your idea of destiny?  
'Cause if it is, just set me free  
  
No, please don't end it now, there is so much more  
We can do, you know, don't let it end  
  
Let's gather what we had and build it up, again  
It used to be so good, oh, please don't let it end  
  
No, please don't end it now, there is so much more  
We can do, you know, don't let it end
