Live another day  
Climb a little higher  
Find another reason to stay  
Ashes in your hands  
Mercy in your eyes  
If you're searching for a silent sky  
  
You won't find it here  
Look another way  
You won't find it here  
So die another day  
  
The coldness of his words  
The message in his silence  
"Face the candle to the wind"  
The distance in my voice  
Isn't leaving you a choice  
So if you're looking for a time to run away  
  
You won't find it here  
Look another way  
You won't find it here  
So try another day  
  
They took pictures of our dreams  
Ran to hide behind the stairs  
And said maybe when it's right for you, they'll fall  
  
But if they don't come down  
Resist the need to pull them in  
And throw them away  
Better to save the mystery  
Than surrender to the secret  
No!  
  
You won't find it here  
Look another way  
You won't find it here  
So try another day
