Did I ever say, how I feel about you  
A thing I never found that easy to do  
The things that you do, don't need to be heard  
You know your actions, baby, speak louder than words  
  
I've got the bottle, bring me your cup  
Pop the cork, and try a sup  
And when you're empty, I'll fill you up  
We'll drink it down till the sun comes up  
  
I'm heading home, like a steaming train  
Foot to the floor, in the driving rain  
My head is aching and my mouth is dry  
I've got a thirst only you can satisfy  
  
I've got the bottle, bring me your cup  
Pop the cork, and try a sup  
And when you're empty, I'll fill you up  
We'll drink it down till the sun comes up
