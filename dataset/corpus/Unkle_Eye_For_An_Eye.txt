Even now in heaven  
There were angels carrying savage weapons  
  
An eye for an eye (for an eye)  
A tooth for a tooth (for a tooth)  
  
Run, run, run,  
But you sure can't hide (hide, hide)  
  
An eye for an eye (for an eye)  
A tooth for a tooth (for a tooth)  
  
Run, run, run,  
But you sure can't hide (hide, hide)  
  
Is that room been fit to earth?  
Doesn't help the to grow sunshine?  
Is this darkness all you'll take?  
Have you'd passed through this life?  
  
Run, run, run, but you sure can't hide (hide, hide)  
  
Where you're going you're not coming back from  
  
Run, run, run, but you sure can't hide (hide, hide)  
  
An eye for an eye (for an eye)  
A tooth for a tooth (for a tooth)  
Run, run, run,  
But you sure can't hide (hide, hide)  
  
An eye for an eye (for an eye)  
A tooth for a tooth (for a tooth)  
Run, run, run,  
But you sure can't hide (hide, hide)  
  
This grain evil  
Where is it come from?  
Had it still the end of the world?  
Who's doing this?  
Who's killed us?  
Marking us with the sign of the holy mighty man  
  
Run, run, run (run, run)  
Run, run, run (run, run)  
  
An eye for an eye (for an eye)  
A tooth for a tooth (for a tooth)  
Run, run, run, but you sure can't hide (hide, hide)  
  
An eye for an eye (for an eye)  
A tooth for a tooth (for a tooth)  
Run, run, run,  
But you sure can't hide (hide, hide)  
  
(An eye for an eye)  
Are you righteous?  
(A tooth for a tooth)  
Kind?  
(Run, run, run but you sure can't hide)  
Do you come for ?  
(An eye for an eye)  
Are you loved by heart?  
(A tooth for a tooth)  
Do you imagine your suffers will be last?  
(Run, run, run, but you sure can't hide)  
Because you loved to be truth  
An eye for an eye,  
A tooth for a tooth,  
Run, run, run, but you sure can't hide,  
Run, run, run, but you sure can't hide (hide,hide)  
  
What are you to me?
