I saw you at midnight, in a dream that I had.  
From nowhere, you stood there, and you seemed so sad.  
And a vicious decision is drivin' me mad.  
Should I follow my head, or follow my heart?  
  
You were different, indifferent, unbelievably cool.  
I approached you, to show you, that I'm nobody's fool.  
And an error, caused terror, as I sensed your dare.  
Should I follow my head, or follow my heart?  
  
Should I follow my head, or follow my heart?  
You've got the lead, baby I've got a start.  
Should I follow my head?  
Should I follow my heart?  
Should I follow my head, or my heart?  
Follow my heart.
