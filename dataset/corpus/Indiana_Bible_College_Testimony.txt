Chorus  
I love You so  
And I'm never gonna let You go  
Holdin' on to Your hand  
Though sometimes I don't understand  
Tears I've cried night and day  
But I'm gonna trust You anyway  
Because You love me  
And I love You too  
  
Verse 1  
He's my joy, He's my peace  
When I'm weak, He always stands by me  
He gives me strength to carry on  
Even when all hope is gone  
I can't explain the way I feel  
All I know is that my God is real  
He's never left me, and He never will  
  
Verse 2  
On a cross, Jesus died  
For my sins He gave His life  
Stone they rolled o'er His grave  
Crushed the hopes of men that day  
But He rose, praise His Name  
Now I'm free from guilt and shame  
Because He loves me, and I love Him too  
  
Verse 3  
Trials I've had, battles I've fought  
But through Your Word, Lord, You have taught  
If I don't go left, don't go right  
If I just stand, I'll win this fight  
The battle's not mine but the Lord's  
He will be my shield and sword  
Because he loves me, and I love Him too
