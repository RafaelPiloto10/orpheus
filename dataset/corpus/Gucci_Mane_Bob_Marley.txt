They shot my homie for nothing, killed my homie for nothing  
I smoke blunts everyday, to try to wish it didn't happen  
But I can't bring him back, cause I am only a mortal  
People think I'm a god, but to me I'm only normal  
I used to trap on the corner, trap ? with the thermal  
I had that TEC in the bushes, run up on me I burn you  
Folks they come to Atlanta, just to ride through my zone  
Wanna see where I trapped at, they wanna see what's my home  
In the place that I said, everything that I meant  
I got so many pounds in the apartment think I got dreads  
I got money in the bed, so I sleep with the bread  
If you play with Bricksquad, them might take off your head  
  
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high  
I'm so high, baby girl I'm so high  
She get high, your baby girl, she get fucked up  
And he get high, you know that nigga fuck his nose up  
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high  
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high  
She so high, but bitch with me so she good night  
And you so broke, you looking at us with all this ice  
  
Bitch I bigger pay her or get bigger paid, everyday is a bigger day  
Bigger nigga get a bigger gun, hit his ass in his bigger face  
Bigger ? and I fuck with him, half the niggas he with her don't like  
That young nigga 'bout trigger play, and my section Lil Jay like nigga day  
Reiterate I'm 'bout pistol play, anything with my pistol say  
Shoulder deep in this cocaine, but nigga I can hold the weight  
Appraise me, I'm a mill' today  
A mill, and a mill, made a mill today  
Say you wanna do a show, what's the rate?  
Told a nigga fifty with a steel face  
Smoking on kush and I'm drinking on grape's, I feel just like I'm Pimp C  
Say Gucci Mane you a murderer, so you can't get a sponsor like Pepsi  
Say Pepsi, fuck you, cause I fuck with the Coca-Cola anyway  
On check day it's booming, but it's real slow on rent day  
  
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high  
I'm so high, baby girl I'm so high  
She get high, your baby girl, she get fucked up  
And he get high, you know that nigga fuck his nose up  
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high  
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high  
She so high, but bitch with me so she good night  
And you so broke, you looking at us with all this ice
