This is how the story went  
I met someone by accident  
It blew me away  
It blew me away  
  
It was in the darkest of my days  
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain  
And buried them away, you buried them away  
  
I wish I could lay down beside you  
When the day is done  
And wake up to your face against the morning sun  
But like everything I've ever known  
You disappear one day  
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away  
  
Drop you off at the train station  
Put a kiss on top of your head  
Watch you wave  
Watched you wave  
  
Then I went on home to your skyscrapers  
Neon lights and waiting papers  
That you call home  
I call it home  
  
I wish I could lay down beside you  
When the day is done  
And wake up to your face against the morning sun  
But like everything I've ever known  
You disappear one day  
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away  
  
I woke up feeling heavy hearted  
I'm going back to where I started  
The morning rain, the morning rain  
Although I wish that you were here  
That same old road that brought me here  
Is calling me home, It's calling me home  
  
I wish I could lay down beside you  
When the day is done  
And wake up to your face against the morning sun  
But like everything I've ever known  
You disappear one day  
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away  
And I can spend my whole life hiding my heart away
