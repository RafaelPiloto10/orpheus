I'm driving' through the rain  
Just to talk to you again  
Please don't run away this time  
Until I say what's on my mind.  
  
Tonight I need to stay with you  
This time I'm not passing through  
Tear down the walls around your heart  
And though I know it's who you are  
  
I just can't get to you girl  
Oh yeah, I just can't get to you  
If you won't let me through girl  
Oh no, I just can't get to you.  
  
You say you really need me here  
So I can't let you disappear  
Even though it's getting late  
Somehow I seem to hesitate.  
  
'Cause I just can't get to you girl  
Oh yeah, I just can't get to you...  
If you won't let me through girl  
Oh no, I just can't get to you.  
  
You're afraid that you'll get hurt again  
Yes, I knw that's how it feels  
Don't surrender, that's no way to win  
Let it go, let me in  
  
'Cause I just can't get to you  
Just can't get to you girl  
Oh yeah, just can't get to you  
If you won't let me through girl  
Oh no, I just can't get to you  
  
Just can't get to you girl  
Oh yeah, just can't get to you  
You won't let me through girl  
Oh no, I just can't get to you.
