You came to me, I was alone,  
Tried to drag me in to your danger zone.  
You told me things got right inside  
And showed me things I'd never tried.  
You got a hold, you wouldn't let go,  
You lied and lied and lied  
It was a great big show.  
Everything about us looks wrong but I swear it feels right.  
(people talk) people talk, I hear them do it  
(they think think they know)they think they know, when I never knew it  
(you're a gigolo) you're gigolo I've heard it said.  
(I've got a sweet name)I've got a sweet name for you instead.  
They imagine, "what must give them a thrill?"  
They'll never know for sure, but I will  
Everything about us looks wrong but I swear it feels right.  
Everything about us looks wrong but I swear it feels right.  
Whispering is rude in public places  
(its so obvious)it's so obvious, written on their faces  
They think your taking me for a great big ride  
But you know whats more? they're probably right I'm hoping on with you
tonight...  
You take me up and let me down  
Don't like my friends to come around.  
(if your not center) if your not center of the stage  
You sulk and rant and go into a rage.  
Ohohoh but I can leave at any time,  
But I'd miss the oh so absurd and so sublime.  
Everything about us looks wrong but I swear it feels right.  
Everything about us looks wrong but I swear it feels right.  
Everything about us looks wrong but I swear it feels right.
