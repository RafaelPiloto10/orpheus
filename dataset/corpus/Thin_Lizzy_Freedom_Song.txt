Let me tell you the hard luck story  
About a man named jack mcduff  
He believed in God and glory  
But he just wasn't tough enough  
  
I believe in the freedom song  
Long live liberty!  
I believe in the freedom song  
I'll choose my own destiny  
  
Well they took him and they beat him  
Underneath the old hanging tree  
Saying, jack, you must die  
What will your last words be?  
  
Jack, he hung his head back  
Long live liberty!  
I believe in the freedom song  
Doesn't matter what you do to me  
  
With a rope around his neck they left him hanging  
High on that old hanging tree  
On her knees his wife was screaming  
Lord have mercy, lord have mercy  
  
I believe in the freedom song  
Long live liberty!  
I believe in the freedom song  
Doesn't matter what you do to me
