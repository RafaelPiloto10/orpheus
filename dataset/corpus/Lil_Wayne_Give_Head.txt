Now, momma's a hoe met her at a video with her face ready to go waiting for
cameo  
She say, I can tell you hustle, I can smell the coke  
The money, you got a lot, I can smell the dough  
I told her, keep her nose outta business of grown folks  
She been to New Orleans twice never been through the?  
Now her pocketbook nice, and her dress coal  
But her teeth pearly white and her lips was swole  
She bad, have you seen her?  
My nigga said I might aswell marry a diva, like Trina, I pleased her, she
please me the same, hey  
What's the beauty without the brain?  
  
Now go down girl, give head, go down Go down girl, give head, go down Now go
down, girl, give head, go down Go down girl give head  
  
Right on the club, right in the club, shorty popped an x and gave me head
right in the club  
To be honest, I don't think we gonna go to my truck cause her cousin's with
her and she looking better than her  
Yeah, she's fat in the ass, slim in the waist, kinda pretty and she down to
take the shit in the face  
Licking all on her lips, cause she love how I taste  
It's dripping on her chin, hope it don't fall on my?  
Yeah, I'm glad I found ya, can't wait to bring Wayne and Mack Maine around ya  
Gave me head in the pool and I damn near drowned her  
  
Before I'd kiss that hoe, I'd rather kiss a perahna  
  
Now go down girl, give head, go down Go down girl, give head, go down Now go
down, girl, give head, go down Go down girl give head  
  
Now I ain't saying she a dick sucker, but she ain't bout to get a kiss from
us,  
Now I ain't saying she a dick sucker, but she ain't bout to get a kiss from us  
  
Now go down girl, give head, go down Go down girl, give head, go down Now go
down, girl, give head, go down Go down girl give head  
  
All my little divas, pay attention, just listen  
If we ain't in Paris, then we ain't French kissin'  
I'm tryna feel your tounge, I'm just tryna be the one  
Give it to ya from the back and make you cough up a lung  
Or give a little brain and cough up a sun  
I bust two times and then I toss up a one  
Now shake it baby, it took your momma 9 months to make you baby  
Enter the bedroom, we won't make a baby  
Get your kneee pads on, no skating baby  
So get your aprons baby,  
She said, I think it's a boy, she ate the baby  
  
Now go down girl, give head, go down Go down girl, give head, go down Now go
down, girl, give head,
