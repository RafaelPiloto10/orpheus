There are so many things in life to know  
Cause someone says it's right don't make it so  
This is someone somewhere who's taking notes  
There's someone telling lies sowing wild oats  
When you are moving fast, you can succeed  
Just how long can you last at twice the speed  
  
[Chorus:]  
Here's a warning: two wrongs don't make a right  
Heed the warning, and everything will be alright  
I'll keep good meter, and I'll take my time  
I'll try to stay in beat and live in rhyme  
I know from love I came, to love I'll go  
I'll live and learn and love and try to grow  
When you are moving fast, you can succeed  
Just how long can you last at twice the speed
