Yeah, uh-huh  
I can't believe it  
  
[Chorus]  
Finally I'm walking down that aisle  
No need for the coping now  
I found the perfect partner waiting for me at the altar  
Made a vow before God to love me  
And finally I'm walking down that aisle  
I will never second guess us how  
When we're laughing together, and we're crying together  
Having kids together, my life begins right now  
  
Finally the day has arrived  
I'm standing at the altar, you're walking down the aisle  
My heart skips a beat, emotions run wild  
Half of me is crying, the other half smiles  
I can feel my stomach turnin' and tossin' and goin' through it  
I just can't believe it, I'm really 'bout to do it  
Take the vow to be together forever  
Plus promise I'ma be there, whenever, wherever  
Through the ups and downs, through the darkest clouds  
Side by side in the rain 'til the sun comes out  
I was blind to love, God showed me you  
Now I'm standin' here shakin 'bout to say "I do"  
And I do  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Butterflies, my palms are sweaty  
It's a lifetime commitment, I pray that I'm ready  
But your eyes tell me not to worry, you're sincere  
Can't turn back now, destiny's why I'm here  
Our friends laugh as I take you by the hand  
But they single and this a feeling that they don't understand  
You're my partner for life, I'ma treat you right  
Our honeymoon's forever, not just tonight  
Knew the time was right, to be husband and wife  
Us both dressed alike in the purest white  
Such a beautiful gown, friends and family around  
Ignore the cold feet now, time to take these vows  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's a beautiful and heavenly day  
As the pastor asks, "Who gives this woman away?"  
Your father says "I do" and gives me a hand  
Plus the tough guy, and I completely understand  
He losin' a diamond and now you're mine and  
He don't have to worry, I'm a keep you shinin'  
I'm a build us a future, I'm a keep on climbin'  
With our family on my back, cause that's my assignment  
I'm a work overtime, make sure y'all live  
But still find time for you and homework with the kids  
Took a long time to learn, I was so hardheaded  
But you stuck with me and you won't regret it, "I do"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I do (I do)  
Baby I do (I do)  
Baby I do  
We made a vow baby  
I do (I do)  
Baby I do (I do)  
Baby I do  
Find that perfect partner, yeah yeah (I do)  
Waiting for me at the altar  
And I make a vow before God to love you  
Finally I'm walking down that aisle  
I'll, never second guess you
