Seems like forever and a day  
  
If my intentions are misunderstood  
Please be kind  
I've done all I should  
I won't ask of you  
What I would not do  
Oh, I saw the damage in you  
My fortunate one  
The envy of youth  
  
Why would they  
Tell me to please those  
That laugh in my face  
With all of the reasons  
They've taught  
Fall over themselves  
To give way, oh yeah  
  
It's not a question  
Whether my heart is true  
Streamlined  
I had to pull through  
Look for a new  
Beginning on you  
Oh, I, I got a message for you  
Up and away  
It's what I gotta do  
Give what you have  
For what you might lose  
  
What would you say  
If I told you that I'm to blame?  
And what would you do  
If I had to deny your name?  
Where would you go if I told you  
"I love you"  
And then walk away? Oh yeah!  
N' who should I turn to  
If not for the ones  
That you would not save? Alright  
  
I told you when I found you  
If there were doubts you  
Should be careful and unafraid  
Now  
They surround you  
And all that amounts too  
Is love that you fed by  
Perversion and pain  
  
So if my affections  
Are misunderstood  
And you decide  
I'm up  
To no good  
Don't ask me to  
Enjoy them  
Just for you  
  
Ask yourself  
What I would choose  
To prostitute myself  
To live with fortune and shame  
Oh yeah!  
When you should  
Have turned to the hearts  
Of the ones  
That you could not save, oh now!  
  
I told you when I found you  
All that amounts too  
Is love that you fed by  
Perversion and pain
