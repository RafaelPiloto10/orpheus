She left more than just her lipstick  
When she walked out  
Her memory keeps haunting me  
That's why I'm hunting you down  
  
It's been a long time since our lips met  
You've always been good at helping me forget  
I'll regret it in the morning but that's not stopping me now  
  
Senorita Margarita  
I'm as lonesome as a man can be  
I still love her I still need her  
I'm just hopin' you can comfort me  
I don't want to do her wrong  
I don't need somebody new  
I just can't be alone tonight  
So Senorita Margarita  
Let me hold you tight  
  
She always comes to her senses  
With some space and time  
And you're just what I needed  
To pull off this hot head of mine  
  
I hope you realize this is a one night stand  
I'm gonna get her back I know I can  
So let's keep this between you, me, the salt and the lime  
  
Senorita Margarita  
I'm as lonesome as a man can be  
I still love her I still need her  
I'm just hopin' you can comfort me  
I don't want to do her wrong  
I don't need somebody new  
I just can't be alone tonight  
So Senorita Margarita  
Let me hold you tight
