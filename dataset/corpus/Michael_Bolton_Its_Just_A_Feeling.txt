Its not the tape this song is recorded on  
Its not the way it ought to be done  
Its not the words that the singer is singin  
Its not the way the music is played  
I know its nothin new  
cause its all been done before  
  
Its just a feelin baby  
A feelin, oh yeah, a feelin baby  
Its just a feelin  
Thats all its been  
Thats all its ever been  
  
Its not the things you say to me  
When were alone and the lights are low  
Its not the smile on your face in the morning  
Baby, that keeps me comin home to you at night  
Dont understand what it does  
But your love comes shinin through  
  
Its just a feelin, baby  
Its a feelin, oh  
Oh, a feelin baby  
Its a feelin that keeps me coming back  
I want to tell you right now  
  
Nothing is going to change, baby  
When your love, your love comes through  
Its just a feelin, baby  
A feelin, oh, feelin baby  
Just a feelin baby, ooh  
Its just a feelin, its just a feelin baby
