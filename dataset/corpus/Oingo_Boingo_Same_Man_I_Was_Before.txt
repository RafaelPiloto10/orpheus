I'm not the same man I was before  
I haven't changed my perception  
I haven't lost my protection  
I haven't lost, haven't lost, haven't lost  
What I have, lost intentions  
Two by two coming through the door  
(Singing like a bird)  
Boys and girls voices joined in song  
(Voices in the air)  
Fire crackers making so much noise  
(Flying in the air)  
They all start yelling at me  
. . . . . Everything you do is wrong  
I'm not the same boy I was before  
But I've not changed my desires  
I've not extinguished the fires  
I haven't lost wide eyed wonder  
I haven't lost, haven't lost, haven't lost  
The stupid fear of thunder  
Two by two walking hand in hand  
(Walkin' in the air)  
The bone come marching from the promised land  
(Comes from everywhere)  
Their voices carry like the sound of glass  
(Breaking on the ground)  
It burns my ears when they sing  
. . . . . Everything you do is wrong  
I'm not the same ghost I was before  
But I still converse with the spirits  
When people talk I don't hear it  
I walk through doors when no one sees me  
I disappear, I disappear, disappear  
Whenever it may please me
