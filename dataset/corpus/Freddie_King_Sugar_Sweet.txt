I'm gonna tell you about my baby  
I speak of her with pride  
She go all the way to make me satisfied  
Oh she's my baby, she's my baby, don't you see  
I can't call her sugar 'cause sugar never was so sweet  
She manicure my nails, scratch dandruff from my head  
She's my baby, she's my baby, don't you see  
I can't call her sugar 'cause sugar never was so sweet  
When I say what I want, that's the way it's gonna be  
She fall over backwards to go right on pleasin' me  
Oh she's my baby, she's my baby, can't you see  
I can't call her sugar 'cause sugar never was so sweet
