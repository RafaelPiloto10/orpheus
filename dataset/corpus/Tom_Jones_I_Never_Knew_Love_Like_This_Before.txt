I NEVER KNEW LOVE LIKE THIS BEFORE  
WRITERS REGGIE LEWIS, JAMES MTUME  
  
I never knew love like this before, now I'm lonely never more  
Since you came into my life You are my lovelight, this I know  
And I'll never let you go You my all, you're part of me  
Once I was lost and now I'm found Then you turned my world around  
When I need you, I call your name  
Cause I never knew love like this before  
Opened my eyes  
Cause I never knew love like this before  
What a surprise  
Cause I never knew love like this before  
This feelings so deep inside of me Such a tender fantasy  
You're the one I'm living for You are my sunlight and my rain  
And time could never change  
What we share forever more, ooh...hoo...  
I never knew love like this before  
Now I'm lonely never more Since you came into my life  
Cause I never knew love like this before  
Opened my eyes  
Cause I never knew love like this before  
What a surprise  
Cause I never knew love like this before  
You are my lovelight, this I know And I'll never let you go  
You my all, you're part of me Once I was lost and now I'm found  
Then you turned my world around  
When I need you, I call your name  
Cause I never knew love like this before  
Opened my eyes  
Cause I never knew love like this before  
What a surprise  
Cause I never knew love like this before  
Inside of me I never knew love like this before  
Opened my eyes  
Never , never  
Never knew love like this Never , never  
Never knew love like this Never , never  
Never knew love like this Never , never, never  
Never knew love like this Never , never, never  
Never knew love like this Never , never I never  
Never knew love like this Never , never, never  
Never knew love like this Never
