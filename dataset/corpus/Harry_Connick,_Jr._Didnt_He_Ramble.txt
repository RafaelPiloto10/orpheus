Didn't he ramble, didn't he ramble  
He rambled all around, in and out of town  
Didn't he ramble, didn't he ramble  
He rambled till the butcher cut him down  
  
He rambled through the city  
He rambled through the street  
Little ol' lady pass him by said  
"Look at the market meat!"  
  
Didn't he ramble, didn't he ramble  
He rambled all around, in and out of town  
Didn't he ramble, didn't he ramble  
He rambled till the butcher cut him down  
  
Didn't he ramble, didn't he ramble  
He rambled all around, in and out of town  
Didn't he ramble, didn't he ramble  
He rambled till the butcher shot him down  
  
He rambled through the city  
He rambled through the street  
Little ol' lady pass him by said  
"Look at the market meat!"  
  
Didn't he ramble, didn't he ramble  
He rambled all around, in and out of town  
Didn't he ramble, didn't he ramble  
He rambled till the butcher shot him down
