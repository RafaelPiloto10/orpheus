Isn't it time all of love's bad debts got paid?  
Don't be afraid  
Isn't it true?  
If you don't trust in yourself  
You'll trust no-one else  
All your favorite memories  
Are not your worst enemies  
Come on, give 'em a ride  
You gotta decide to push them aside  
Give it a try  
  
You gotta get yourself to love  
She's not the only one  
You, you gotta get yourself to love  
Why be the lonely one?  
Get yourself to love  
  
Take away the things you need to start again  
Your heart will never mend  
Take away, oh, the chance you have to slip and fall  
You will miss it all  
  
Drop your one-part harmonies  
For the harder melodies  
You're so aware  
Of the crosses you bear  
Don't be so scared  
Show that you care  
  
Oh, you, oh, you gotta get yourself to love  
She's not the only one  
Oh, you, yes you, you gotta get yourself to love  
Why be the lonely one?  
  
Oh, you, yeah, you gotta get yourself to love  
Yes, love, you gotta love sometime  
You, oh, you  
Why be the sad and lonely one?  
You know  
You can do it, yes, you can do it, you can do it for yourself  
Yes, you can, oh, don't bend  
You can do it, you can do it, you can do it  
You can do it for yourself
