I need a little time  
To think it over  
I need a little space  
Just on my own  
I need a little time  
To find my freedom  
I need a little  
  
Funny how quick the milk turns sour  
Isn't it, isn't it  
Your face has been looking like that for hours  
Hasn't it, hasn't it  
Promises, promises turn to dust  
Wedding bells just turn to rust  
Trust into mistrust  
  
I need a little room  
To find myself  
I need a little space  
To work it out  
I need a little room  
All alone  
I need a little  
  
You need a little room for your big head  
Don't you, don't you  
You need a little space for a thousand beds  
Won't you, won't you  
Lips that promise fear the worst  
Tongue so sharp the bubble burst  
Just into unjust  
  
I've had a little time  
To find the truth  
Now I've had a little room  
To check what's wrong  
I've had a little time  
And I still love you  
I've had a little  
  
You had a little time  
And you had a little fun  
Didn't you, didn't you  
While you had yours  
Do you think I had none  
Do you, do you  
The Freedom that you wanted bad  
Is yours for good  
I hope you're glad  
Sad into unsad  
  
I had a little time  
To think it over  
Had a little room  
To work it out  
I found a little courage  
To call it off  
  
I've had a little time  
I've had a little time  
I've had a little time  
I've had a little time
