Ooh, it's over, it's over, ooh, hey  
Oh, baby, it's over, it's over baby  
  
I want you the right way  
And I want you, but I want you to want me too  
Want you to want me baby  
Just like I want you, ooh  
  
I'll give you all the love I want in return, sweet darling  
But half a love is all I feel  
Ooh, it's too bad, just too sad you don't want me now  
But I'm gonna change your mind somehow, oh baby  
  
I want you the right way  
I want you, but I want you to want me too  
I want you to want me baby  
Just like I want you, oh  
  
One way love is just a fantasy, oh sugar  
To share is precious, pure and fair, oh  
Don't play with something you should cherish for life, oh baby  
Oh, don't you wanna care? It's lonely out there  
  
Oh, I want you the right way  
I want you, babe, but I want you to want me too  
Oh, I want to get down baby  
When I, when I get down with you, yeah  
  
I want you the right way  
I want you, babe, but I want you to want me too  
I want you baby  
Just like I want you, oh  
  
Get down babe, have mercy darling  
Listen darling, I love you, I love you  
And I want you babe, to get down babe  
When I get down with you, oh  
  
I want you babe, I want you babe  
I want you, but I want you to want me too, oh  
Oh, I love you, hey, just like I want you  
Oh, you gotta get down baby
