I'm not a fortune teller, I won't be bringing news  
Of what tomorrow brings, I'll leave that up to you  
I'm not a fortune teller, don't have a crystal ball  
I can't predict the future, can't see nothing at all  
  
It doesn't mean I'm afraid of all the things that you say  
But I just think we should stay stuck in the moment today  
And as the seasons roll by, no matter how hard I try  
Summer will end and the leaves will turn again  
  
I don't know why you're acting like this  
I don't know why you had to do it again  
Why'd you have to go and ruin the night  
Don't worry about tomorrow's mess  
  
I never know how the future will go  
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller  
I'll never change, but I want you to stay  
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller  
  
I don't like watching TV, I don't know what it all means  
And your American dream, baby it just isn't me  
I know that what I'm thinking may not be on your mind  
I know the song I'm singing is not your favorite kind  
  
It doesn't mean I'm afraid of all the things that you say  
But I just think we should stay stuck in the moment today  
And as the seasons roll by, no matter how hard I try  
Summer will end and the leaves will turn again  
  
I don't know why you're acting like this  
I don't know why you had to do it again  
Why'd you have to go and ruin the night  
Don't worry about tomorrow's mess  
  
I never know how the future will go  
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller  
I'll never change, but I want you to stay  
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller  
  
This feeling keeps growing  
These rivers keep flowing  
How can I have answers  
When you drown me in questions  
  
I never know how the future will go  
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller  
I'll never change, but I want you to stay  
And I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller  
  
I'll never know how the future will go  
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller  
I never change, but I want you to stay  
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller
