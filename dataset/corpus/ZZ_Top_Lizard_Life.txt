I got the attitude  
And that's all I ever say  
Don't have to tell nobody  
How their tail ought to lay  
  
Had a sudden revelation  
The heights that I've sunken down to  
And I don't mind I can't find  
My way out of this witch's brew  
  
Livin' for the lizard life  
Livin' for the lizard life  
I stumbled on the way around  
My own reality  
  
Gettin' right-tightly wound  
Past the pale of normality  
I like big loungin' every day  
On the iguana side of town  
  
The lizard love, it mighty deep  
Talkin' way underground  
  
Livin' for the lizard life  
Livin' for the lizard life  
Livin' for the lizard life  
Livin' for the lizard life  
  
I be a reptile all day  
And it's so fine  
Ain't no other way  
Like a life minus mind  
  
I prefer reclinin'  
Beatin' that conga drum  
And waitin' for a three-point landin'  
On my sticky tongue  
  
Livin' for the lizard life  
Livin' for the lizard life  
Livin' for the lizard life  
I'm livin with a lizard life
