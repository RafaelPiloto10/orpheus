Every night about this time  
Oh, how I miss you  
I drift into our old rendezvous  
Every night about this time  
The gang keeps on askin' why you're not around  
And I keep pretendin' that you're just out of town  
Every night about this time  
Memories haunt me  
Wondering, too, who's dancing with you  
Every night about this time  
And whenever they croon our favorite tune  
A tear falls with every rhyme  
Oh, how I miss you  
Every night about this time  
Every night about this time  
Memories haunt me  
Wondering, too, who's dancing with you  
Every night about this time  
And whenever they croon our favorite tune  
A tear falls with every rhyme  
Oh, how I miss you  
Every night about this time
