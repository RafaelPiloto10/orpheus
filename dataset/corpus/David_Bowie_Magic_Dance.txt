(What babe?)  
The babe with the power.  
(What power?)  
The Power of voodoo.  
(Who do?)  
You do.

Remind me of the babe.  
  
I saw my baby, crying hard as babe could cry  
What could I do?  
My baby's love had gone  
And left my baby blue  
Nobody knew  
  
What kind of magic spell to use  
Slime and snails  
Or puppy dog tails?  
Thunder or lightning  
Then baby said  
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)  
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)  
Put that baby's spell on me  
Jump magic, jump (jump magic, jump)  
Jump magic, jump (jump magic, jump)  
Put that magic jump on me  
Slap that baby, make him free!  
  
I saw my baby, trying hard as babe could try  
What could I do?  
My baby's fun had gone  
And left my baby blue  
Nobody knew  
  
What kind of magic spell to use  
Slime and snails  
Or puppy dogs tails  
Thunder or lightning  
Then baby said:

Jump magic, jump (jump magic, jump) (x2)  
  
Put that baby's spell on me (ooh)
