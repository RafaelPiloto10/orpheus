Merry christmas, i don't want to fight tonight with...  
  
Merry christmas, i don't want to fight tonight  
Merry christmas, i don't want to fight tonight  
Merry christmas, i don't want to fight tonight with you  
  
Where is santa at his sleigh? tell me why is it always this way?  
Where is rudolph? where is blitzen, baby? merry christmas, merry merry merry
christmas  
  
All the children are tucked in their beds sugar-plum fairies dancing in their
heads  
Snowball fighting, it's so exciting baby  
  
I love you and you love me and that's the way it's got to be  
I loved you from the start 'cause christmas ain't the time for breaking each
other's heart
