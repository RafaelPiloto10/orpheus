Greed  
Causing innocent blood to flow  
Entire culture lost in the overthrow  
They came to see, take whatever they please  
Then all they gave back was death and disease  
  
People were left with no choice but to decide  
To conform to a system responsible for genocide  
Responsible for genocide, Responsible for genocide  
  
AIDS is killing the entire African nation  
And a vaccine is still supposedly under preparation  
But these governments, they don't mind the procrastination.  
They say we'll kill them off, take their land and go there for vacation  
  
My peoples' culture was strong and was pure  
And if not for that white greed, it would have endured  
My people were left with no choice but to decide  
To conform to a system  
  
Their minds did slay  
Their souls they cage  
You feel the rage  
This brutality can never be undone  
But the sun has not yet set  
The bass and drums and microphone a threat  
That's when you've got to get the cry from the inside  
And see that they're responsible for genocide  
Responsible for genocide, Responsible for genocide  
  
You turn your culture down my throat  
Say I'm inferior when you vomit and choke  
You fill my mind with a false sense of history  
And then you wonder why I have no identity  
  
We'll strike a match and it'll catch  
And spread the insight we need  
A tiny fire burning bright  
Shedding light on the darkness of greed  
  
A yes yes y'all and you don't stop  
Shedding light on the darkness of greed  
A yes yes y'all and you don't stop  
Shedding light on the darkness of greed
