Yeah, yeah  
It seems like yesterday when I said "I do"  
And after all this time my heart still burns for you  
If you don't know by now that you're my only one  
Take a look inside me and watch my heartstrings come undone  
  
I know I promised you forever  
Is there no stronger word I can use  
To reassure you when the storm is raging outside  
You're my safest place to hide  
  
Can you see me, here I am  
I need you like I needed you then  
When I feel like giving up  
I promise inside your heart I'd still fine  
You're my safest place to hide  
  
You see colors no one else can see  
In every breath you hear a symphony  
You understand me like nobody can  
I feel like my soul unfolding like a flower blooming  
  
When this whole world gets too crazy  
And there's nowhere left to go  
I know you give me sanctuary  
You're the only truth I know  
You're the road back home  
  
Can you see me, here I am  
Standing here where I've always been  
And when words are not enough  
I promise inside your heart I'd still fine  
You're my safest place to hide  
My safest place to hide  
  
I know I promised you forever  
There's no stronger word I can use  
To reassure when the storm is raging outside  
You're my safest place to hide  
  
Oh! Can you see me, here I am  
Standing here where I've always been  
When I feel like giving up  
I promise inside your heart I'd still find  
Yeah, yeah  
You're my safest place to hide, oh yeah  
You're my safest place to hide
