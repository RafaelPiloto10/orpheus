One time a thing occurred to me  
What's real and what's for sale  
Blew a kiss and tried to take it home  
  
It isn't you, isn't me  
Search for things that you can't see  
Going blind out of reach  
Somewhere in the vasoline  
  
Two times and it has rendered me  
Punch drunk and without bail  
Think I'd be safer all alone  
  
Flies in the vasoline we are  
Sometimes it blows my mind  
Keep getting stuck here all the time  
  
It isn't you, isn't me  
  
You'll see the look  
And you'll see the lies  
You'll eat the lies  
And you will  
  
Flies in the vasoline we are  
Sometimes it blows my mind  
Keep getting stuck here all the time  
  
It isn't you, isn't me
