I took this girl out last night and we left around 12,  
We walked along lonely streets and got to know ourselves,  
I like to read, she likes to write,  
She likes to sleep, and I like to stay up all night,  
My friends say I'm crazy and I agree,  
But that's okay cause that the way she likes to be  
  
I say now hey girl, come with me and let yourself go,  
Hey girl come with me and let yourself go  
I said hey girl, come with me, and let yourself go, go, go, let yourself go  
  
Well we went out late that night and we danced through the night  
I was holding on to her and she was gripping me tight  
But I didn't care, and she didn't mind  
I was unaware that she liked to act so kind,  
My friends say she's crazy and I agree,  
But that's okay cause that's the way I like to be  
  
Hey girl, come with me and let yourself go,  
Hey girl come with me and let yourself go, go, go,  
Sayin now, just let yourself go  
  
Later on that night I took her home,  
I asked if she felt alright being alone  
So I went inside, she didn't mind,  
Took two to decide that I wasn't going home tonight  
I see we're both crazy, that's alright with me,  
The night was kind of hazy that's the way it's gonna be  
  
I say now hey girl, come with me and let yourself go,  
Hey girl come with me and let yourself go, go, go,  
Saying now, just let yourself go, go, go,  
Just let yourself go, go, go-oh  
Let yourself go
