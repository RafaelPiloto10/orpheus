Memories fill your harbor  
History to be made  
Jealousy in the cupboard  
You with me until the grave  
  
Mid-life krysis, you invited everyone  
You can't wake, you can't wake from this nightmare  
  
Everyday is like the movies  
Third world war on the rise  
Take it in the city  
Making love to get high  
  
Mid-life krysis, you invited everyone  
You can't wake, you can't wake from this nightmare  
  
I waste my time, I waste my  
Don't waste my time, don't waste my  
I waste my time, I waste my  
Don't waste my time, don't waste my  
  
Little Jane, say you're in love with me  
Say it yourself  
Maybe then you'll have some children  
Maybe you ain't have one  
  
Mid-life krysis, you invited everyone  
You can't wake, you can't wake from this nightmare  
You invited everyone  
You can't wake, you can't wake from this nightmare
