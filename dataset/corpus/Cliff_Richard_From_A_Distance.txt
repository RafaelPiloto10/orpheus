From a distance, the world looks blue and green,  
And the snow capped mountains so white.  
From a distance the ocean meets the stream,  
And the eagle takes to flight.  
From a distance, there is harmony  
And it echoes through the land.  
It's the voice of hope, it's the voice of peace,  
It's the voice of every man.  
  
From a distance, we all have enough,  
And no-one is in need.  
There are no guns, no bombs and no disease  
No hungry mouths to feed.  
For a moment we must be instruments,  
Marching in a common band,  
Playing songs of hope, playing songs of peace,  
They're is the songs of every one.  
  
God is watching us, god is watching us,  
God is watching us, from a distance.  
  
From a distance, you look like my friend,  
Even though we are at war.  
From a distance, i can't comprehend,  
What all this war is for.  
What we need is love and harmony,  
Let it echo through the land.  
It's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves,  
It's the heart of everyone.  
It's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves,  
It's the song of everyone.  
  
Sing out, songs of hope,  
Sing out, songs of freedom,  
Sing out, songs of love,  
Sing out, songs of peace,  
  
Sing out, songs of justice,  
Sing out, songs of harmony,  
Sing out, songs of love,  
Sing out, everyone,  
  
Sing out, songs of hope,  
Sing out, songs of freedom,  
Sing out, songs of love,  
Sing out, songs of peace,  
  
Sing out, songs of justice,  
Sing out, songs in harmony,  
Sing out, sing about love,  
Sing out, everyone.  
Sing out.
