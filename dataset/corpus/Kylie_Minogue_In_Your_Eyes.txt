What on earth am I meant to do  
In this crowded place there is only you  
Was gonna to leave now I have to stay  
You have taken my breath away  
  
Is the world still spinning around  
I don't feel like coming down  
  
It's in your eyes  
I can tell what your thinking  
My heart is sinking too  
It's no surprise  
I've been watching you lately  
I want to make it with you  
  
Destiny has a funny way  
When it comes and takes all your cares away  
I can't think of a single thing  
Other than what a beautiful state I'm in  
  
Is the world still spinning around  
I don't feel like coming down  
  
[Repeat x3]  
It's in your eyes  
I can tell what your thinking  
My heart is sinking too  
It's no surprise  
I've been watching you lately  
I want to make it with you
