I went down in the valley to pray  
Learnin' about the good old way  
And who would wear the starry crown  
Oh Lord, show me the way  
Oh Brother, let's go down  
Come on down, don't you want to go down  
Oh Brother, lets go down  
Down in the valley to pray  
As I went walkin in the valley to pray  
Learnin' about the good old way  
And who would wear the starry crown  
Oh Lord, show me the way  
Oh Father, let's go down  
Come on down, don't you want to go down  
Oh Father, lets go down  
Down in the valley to pray  
I went out walkin' on the mountain to pray  
Learnin' about the good old way  
I went up on the mountain and I just had to say  
Oh Lord, show me the way  
Oh Sister, let's go down  
Come on down, don't you want to go down  
Oh Sister, lets go down  
Down in the valley to pray  
As I went down in the valley to pray  
Studyin' about the good old way  
And who will wear the starry crown  
Oh Lord, show me the way  
Oh, let's go down  
Come on down, don't you want to go down  
Oh, let's go down  
Down in the valley to pray
