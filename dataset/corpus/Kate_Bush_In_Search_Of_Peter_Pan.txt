It's been such a long week  
So much crying  
I no longer see a future  
I've been told when I get older  
That I'll understand it all  
  
But I'm not sure if I want to  
Running into her arms  
At the school gates  
She whispers that I'm a poor kid  
And Granny takes me on her knee  
She tells me I'm too sensitive  
She makes me sad  
  
She makes me feel like an old man  
She makes me feel like an old man  
  
They took the game right out of it  
They took the game right out of it  
  
When I am a man  
I will be an astronaut  
And find Peter Pan  
  
Second star on the right  
Straight on 'til morning  
Second star on the right  
Straight on 'til morning  
  
Dennis loves to look  
In the mirror  
He tells me that he is beautiful  
So I look too, and what do I see?  
My eyes are full  
But my face is empty  
  
He's got a photo  
Of his hero  
He keeps it under his pillow  
But I've got a pin-up  
From a newspaper  
Of Peter Pan  
  
I found it in a locket  
I hide it in my pocket  
  
They took the game right out of it  
They took the game right out of it  
  
When I am a man  
I will be an astronaut  
And find Peter Pan  
  
Second star on the right  
Straight on 'til morning  
Second star on the right  
Straight on 'til morning  
Second star on the right  
Straight on 'til morning  
  
"When you wish upon a star  
Makes no difference who you are  
When you wish upon a star  
Your dreams come true"
