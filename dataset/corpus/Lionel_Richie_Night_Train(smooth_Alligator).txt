Leave the station  
Somewhere down in east  
Oh baby, across the nation  
Looking for some fun  
And some hey down hey  
Tell the conductor you're heading  
For the cocktail car  
Yes you are  
That is where I'll be with my sweet  
Ooh, la la, hey  
If you're tired of  
That day after day ride  
And you wanna get off  
All aboard the night train  
Like a smooth alligator  
All aboard the night train  
Such a cool calculator  
All aboard the night train  
Like a smooth operator  
All aboard the night train  
Such a cool calculator  
  
What a beauty  
Listen how the engine wails on the rails  
Sing it to me  
Come and play your tunes  
Up and down my scales  
Such a sweet melody  
I'm just a creature, smile as wide  
As the night is long  
When you're right by my side  
You can never go wrong
