Gonna stay in bed today  
'cause I can't stand the light  
Don't know why I get so down  
  
I won't be much fun tonight  
And I can't believe  
You still want to hang around me  
  
It's not so pretty all the time  
You don't mind  
To you it's alright  
  
As I am is how you take me  
Never try to push or make me different  
When I talk you listen to me  
  
As I am is how you want me and  
I know I've found the pieces missing  
I'm looking at him  
  
I'm not the girl you think you see  
But maybe that's a lie  
You almost know me better than  
Me, myself and I  
  
Don't know a lot of things  
But I know what I got  
It's not so perfect everyday  
I don't have to try  
'cause it all falls into place  
  
As I am is how you take me  
Never try to push or make me different  
When I talk you listen to me  
  
As I am is how you want me and  
I know I've found the pieces missing  
I'm looking at him  
  
Face to face, eye to eye  
You're standing there  
Feels good on the inside  
  
I don't mind, I don't care  
You're standing there  
Seein' me for the first time  
  
Seein' me for the first time  
Seein' me for the first time  
  
As I am is how you take me  
Never try to push or make me different  
When I talk you listen to me  
  
As I am is how you want me and  
I know I've found the pieces missing  
I'm looking at him  
  
Found the pieces missing  
Take me as I am  
When I talk you listen  
Take me as I am  
  
Found the pieces missing  
Take me as I am
