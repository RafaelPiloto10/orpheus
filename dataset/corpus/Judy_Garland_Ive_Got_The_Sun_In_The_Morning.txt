Taking stock of what I have and what I haven't  
Though I find the things I've got will keep me satisfied  
Checking up on what I have and what I haven't  
Though I find a healthy balance on the credit side  
Got no diamonds, got no pearls  
Still I think I'm a lucky girl  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
Got no mansion, got no yacht  
Still I'm happy with what I've got  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
Sunshine gives me a lucky day  
Moonshine gives me the Milky Way  
Got no checkbook, got no bank  
Still I'd like to express my thanks  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
And with the sun in the morning and the moon at night I'm alright  
(Got no butler, got no maid, still I think I've been overpaid)  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
(She's got the sun in the morning and the moon at night)  
(Got no silver, got no gold, what you've got can't be bought or sold)  
Got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
(She's got the sun in the morning and the moon at night)  
Sunshine gives me a lucky day  
Moonshine gives me the Milky Way  
(Got no diamonds, got no pearls  
Still, Ms. Annie's a lucky girl)  
Got the sun in the morning (sun in the morning)  
Got the moon in the evening (moon in the evening)  
Got the sun in the morning and the moon in the evening  
And I'm doing alright  
(Got the sun in the morning  
Got the moon in the evening)  
I'm doing alright
