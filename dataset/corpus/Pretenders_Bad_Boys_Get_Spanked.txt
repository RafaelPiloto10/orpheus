You're not supposed to do that  
You know you're not allowed to  
But you seem to get some kind of kick  
Out of doing what you're not allowed to  
You deliberately defy the rules  
'Cause the law's upheld by fools  
Shit on that  
Bad boys get spanked  
  
You can look but don't touch  
But no you can't resist  
Don't you ever think about the consequence  
Guys like you never do  
That's the kind of stuff boys are made out of  
That's the kind of stuff girls are made out of  
Bad boys get spanked  
Bad boys get spanked  
  
You don't listen do you asshole  
Don't be a punk all your life  
Someone's gonna sort you out  
They'll try to make a man out of you  
Say yes sir, say no sir  
Say yes ma'am, say no m'am  
Shit on that  
Bad boys get spanked  
Bad boys get spanked  
  
Get spanked, get spanked  
Come here, get spanked  
Bad boys get spanked  
Come here, get spanked
