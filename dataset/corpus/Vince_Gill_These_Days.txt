Man, I've seen it all  
I've had my back against the wall  
Pain and misery, empty victories  
Then you came along  
Oh, these days, I'll take these days  
Over any other days I've ever known  
Oh, your sweet ways make these days  
Feel like home  
Man, I've chased some crazy dreams  
Reaching for that big brass ring  
Bitter memories, I've put behind me  
I found out it's the little things  
Oh, these days, I'll take these days  
Over any other days I've ever known  
'Cause your sweet ways make these days  
Feel like home  
Oh, these days, I'll take these days  
Over any other days I've ever known  
Oh, your sweet ways make these days  
Feel like home  
'Cause your sweet ways make these days  
Feel like home
