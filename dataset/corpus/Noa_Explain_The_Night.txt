Explain the night to me  
Explain the stars  
Explain the way I feel  
Explain the scars  
Explain the outline of the trees against the sky  
Explain the tangled words of love we cant untie  
  
Explain the night to me  
Explain the black  
And how the light was lost  
And how to get it back  
Explain the rising of the waves to swallow sand  
Explain how difficult it is to hold your hand  
  
We are wrapped around our needing  
In a drunken trance  
Will you swing and sway me slowly  
And pretend to dance  
We are wrapped around our sorrow  
In a strong embrace  
And between your temple and your eye I hide my face  
  
Explain the night to me  
The pregnant moon  
Explain the sudden urge  
The empty room  
Explain the way to blue  
And all the space  
Explain the makeup swiftly streaked across my face  
  
Explain the night to me  
Explain the past  
Explain the thrill of love  
And why it cannot last  
Explain the rings that slowly spread across the lake  
And how to someday learn to live with my mistakes  
  
We are wrapped around our needing  
In a drunken trance  
Will you swing and sway me slowly  
And pretend to dance  
  
We are wrapped around our sorrow  
In a strong embrace  
And between your temple and your eye I hide my face
