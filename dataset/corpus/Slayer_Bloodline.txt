Eternal the kiss I breath  
Siphon your blood to me  
Feel my wounds of your god  
Forever rape mortality  
I smell of death  
I reek of hate  
I will live forever  
Lost child pay the dead  
Bleeding screams of silence  
In my veins your eternity  
  
I'll kill you and your dreams tonight  
Begin new life  
Bleed your death upon me  
Let your bloodline feed my youth  
  
First breath born come alive learn to kill  
Blood-fest awaits to feed your hunger  
Dark side has no rival test your faith in blood  
Night hides the hunting packs a feeding frenzy  
  
I'll kill you and your dreams tonight  
Begin new life  
Bleed your death upon me  
Let your bloodline feed my youth  
  
I am the first not the last  
Condemned by a single kiss  
Betrayed eternally I'll rip inside your soul  
Contaminating the world  
Defying god and son  
Black heart that brings your death  
Living in infamy  
  
Drink the flesh of life itself  
Prepare to reign a thousand years  
  
I'll kill you and your dreams tonight  
Begin new life  
Bleed your death upon me  
Let your bloodline feed my youth  
  
Blame god chosen children  
As you die I'm immortal  
Faithless no religion  
Stalking prey is my confession  
Captive blood enslavement  
Pain and hunger drives your madness  
Drink flesh life itself  
Prepare to reign a thousand years
