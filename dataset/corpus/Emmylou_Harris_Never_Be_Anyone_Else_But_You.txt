There'll never be anyone else but you for me  
Never ever be, just couldn't be, anyone else but you  
  
If I could take my pick of all the girls I've ever known  
Then I'd come and pick you out to be my very own  
  
There'll never be anyone else but you for me  
Never ever be, just couldn't be, anyone else but you  
  
A heart that's true and longs for you is all I have to give  
All my love belongs to you as long as I may live  
  
There'll never be anyone else but you for me  
Never ever be, just couldn't be, anyone else but you  
  
I never will forget the way you kiss me  
And when we're not together, I wonder if you've missed me  
  
'Cause I hope and pray the day will come when you belong to me  
Then I'm gonna prove to you how true my love can be  
  
There'll never be anyone else but you for me  
Never ever be, just couldn't be, anyone else but you  
  
Mm, mm, mm, mm  
Mm, mm, mm  
  
Mm, mm, mm
