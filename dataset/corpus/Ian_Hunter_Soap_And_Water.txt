(Ian Hunter)  
  
I can't believe what you did, you know - you just can't let it go  
I'm sick 'n' tired of listening to your innuendo  
I can't believe what you did, you know - you sawed me in half  
When I was at the end of my endurance  
All you did was bite the hand that fed you from the start  
  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - a little soap 'n' water, na na na na na na - would not
come amiss  
Oh - oh - a little soap 'n' water - a little soap 'n' water, a little soap 'n'
water  
  
I can't believe what you did, why - why you stoop so low  
Why am I the target for your slings and arrows  
I can't believe what you did, when - you showed me no class  
Every mirror tells a different story  
Who gave you the right to be the keeper of my past  
  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - a little soap 'n' water, na na na na na na - would not
come amiss  
Oh - oh - a little soap 'n' water - a little soap 'n' water, we're gonna have
to wash your mouth out if you persist  
  
You know, I was never loyal to you - you were never loyal to me  
We were both loyal to the cause  
That cause died - there was nothing left inside  
It ain't my fault, let it - it ain't your fault - let it ride  
  
I can't believe what you did, you know - you know how to hurt  
All you do is drag old memories through the dirt  
I can't believe what you did - you show no mercy  
Yesterday don't last until tomorrow  
My oh my, what a pitiful cry - you're your own worst enemy  
  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - a little soap 'n' water, na na na na na na - would not
come amiss  
Oh - oh - a little soap 'n' water - a little soap 'n' water, we're gonna have
to wash your mouth out if you persist  
  
I got just what you need, I got just what you need  
I got just what you need, I got just what you need  
I got just what you need, I got just what you need  
I got just what you need
