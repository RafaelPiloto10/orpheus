In search of a good life the Pilgrims set sail  
Then all through the new land they blazed their brave trails  
The iron horse speeding down freshly-laid rails  
Brought settlers determined to prosper  
  
From the far corners they made it their home  
The ities and germans, the paddies the poles  
Goin' down in the dirt comin' up with the gold  
Like Bill Fuller, the Kennedys and Corleones  
  
Life is so good in the us of A  
Live out you dreams in Amerikay  
If you've gut the guts and the bucks, it is said  
Every man is a king in the us of A  
Every man is a king in Amerikay  
  
The pilgrims these days they are called astronauts  
They seek new battlefields on the moon and beyond  
To wage their star wars in the sky by-and-by  
And to shit on us all from on high  
  
Then when it's all over and the world is no more  
When the White House and Kremlin have settled their score  
The stars and stripes flag will fly high, proud out there in space  
And that's why we all love the United States  
  
In the land of Republican automatons  
Uncle Sam's forces so gung-ho and bronzed  
Just waiting their orders from Washington  
To fight for your peace and your freedom  
  
Vietnam, Nicaragua, El Salvador  
How foolish of you not to open your doors  
To the Hersheys, Budweisers, Mcdonalds and more.....  
This wonderful life could be yours
