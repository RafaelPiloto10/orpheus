Verse 1: Black faces pressed against the glass  
Where the wind leaned its weight  
Wind blows scars and top down cars  
All share one western trait  
Sadness leaks through tear stained cheeks  
From winos to dime store Jews  
Probably don't know they gave me  
These late John Garfield blues  
  
Verse 2: Midnight fell on Franklin street  
The lamp bulbs's always broke  
For the life of me I could not see  
But I heard a brand new joke  
Two man were standing on a bridge  
One jumped and screamed you lose  
Just left the odd man holding  
These late John Garfield blues  
  
Verse 3: I'm going away to the last resort  
In a week or two real soon  
Where the fish don't bite but once a night  
In the dark light of the moon  
Horses scream their nightmare dreams  
And the dead men all wear shoes  
'Cause everybody's dancing  
These late John Garfield blues
