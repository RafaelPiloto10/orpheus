There's something in the way she moves,  
Or looks my way, or calls my name,  
That seems to leave this troubled world behind.  
And if I'm feeling down and blue,  
Or troubled by some foolish game,  
She always seems to make me change my mind.  
  
And I feel fine anytime she's around me now,  
She's around me now  
Just about all the time  
And if I'm well you can tell she's been with me now,  
She's been with me now quite a long, long time  
And I feel fine.  
  
It isn't what she's got to say  
But how she thinks and where she's been  
To me, the words are nice, the way they sound  
I like to hear them best that way  
It doesn't much matter what they mean  
If she says them mostly just to calm me down  
  
Every now and then the things I lean on lose their meaning  
And I find myself careening  
Into places where I should not let me go.  
She has the power to go where no one else can find me  
And to silently remind me  
Of the happiness and the good times that I know, got to know.
