Deedle Dee, three tots are we.  
And we're as clever as can be.  
We live with Grandma Ida and our dear old Grandpa Ned  
And little Baby Mike (the brat)  
And don't forget the siamese cat  
And in the attic from Detroit is big, fat Uncle Fred  
  
Oh Grandpa wishes he were rich,  
And Grandma just complains (the bitch)  
And Uncle Fred gets drunk while Mike just cries all night and day  
The cat thinks that he owns the place  
He bites and scratches on the face  
It'd be so nice if they just went away, away  
Ooh daddle, daddle daddle daddle daddle daddle day  
  
[Chorus:]  
The cat is dead, the cat is dead  
I went to pat him on the head  
He didn't purr, he didn't meow he didn't blink or snip.  
He seemed to have a funny smile that made me laugh  
But all the while, the tail that used o flip and flap  
Got awful cold and stiff.  
We chopped him into tiny bits,  
And seasoned him with apple bits  
And with some dust, we made a crust and put him in a pie.  
Into the oven he did sit, until the crust was nice and crisp  
I'll love that little kitty till I die.  
Dee die, dee di-de-di-de-di-de-di-de-di-de-di-de-di.  
  
The cat is dead, the cat is dead.  
And Mikey too, and Uncle Fred  
Expiring oh so suddenly while sipping down some tea.  
The tea was hot, the tea was hot  
With stricknine and a little spice to  
Cover up the funny taste of our conspiracy.  
When Grandpa saw what we had done,  
He went straight for his hunting gun  
But we were quick we sole the clip  
The rest is history  
To make sure Grandma wouldn't flea  
We gave her a lobotomy  
And now's she's just as happy as can be  
Dee dee, dee deedle deedle deedle deedle deedle deedle dee  
  
[Chorus:]
