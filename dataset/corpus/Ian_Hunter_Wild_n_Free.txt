Wild 'n free wild 'n free  
Wild 'n free wild 'n free  
Oh! I'd never known what it was like to free  
I always thought it was never true  
I got a feeling I was lost in space  
Did not like my face  
Just wanted to be  
Wild 'n free wild 'n free  
Like a hurricane  
Wild 'n free wild 'n free  
Oh insanity's so insane  
Wild 'n free wild 'n free  
I ain't got no got no got no name  
Wild 'n free wild 'n free  
Don't want no ball and chain  
  
Damn people telling me that I was thinking bad  
Had me believing they was right  
All they wanted was another slob  
In some stinking job  
That just ain't me I just want to be  
W w w wild 'n free wild 'n free  
Like a hurricane  
Wild 'n free wild 'n free  
Oh insanity's so in so insane  
Wild 'n free wild 'n free  
I ain't got no name  
Wild 'n free wild 'n free  
I don't I don't want to know a ball and chain  
  
Just then I found out I was too broke to get out  
So I took to the road no one was having me  
I said don't want no handouts  
Cause I'm making out  
You ain't like me I just want to be  
Uh uh uh wild 'n free  
  
I tried to tell you babe but you never understood  
I always tried to make you see  
But you believed just what your old man said  
He had you chained to his head  
And its on tv tv tv tv  
Want to be want to be want to be  
Wild 'n free wild 'n free  
Like a hurricane  
Wild 'n free wild 'n free  
Oh insanity's so insane  
Wild 'n free wild 'n free  
I ain't got no got no got no name  
Wild 'n free wild 'n free  
Don't want no ball and chain  
Wild 'n free wild 'n free  
Just like a ball a ball a ball of fire  
Wild 'n free wild 'n free  
Like it high its getting higher  
Wild 'n free wild 'n free  
Like some bolt from out the sky  
Wild 'n free wild 'n free  
Like some bullet  
Say goodbye
