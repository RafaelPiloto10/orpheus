I feel a strange sensation taking over from my head to my toes  
I got the shakes body rippling it's enough to shatter my bones  
  
Is it all a dream? 'Cause I don't wanna stay awake  
But I won't remember a thing  
And now it's running through my veins  
I don't know what's happening, the beats so sick  
  
Running from the madhouse, they won't take me back  
Got the medicines to give me what I need  
Yes I'm burning up but music is my drug  
Doesn't matter if I shout or if I scream  
  
They're coming for me  
They're coming for me  
  
Everywhere I look I'm shook I got bloodshot eyes  
I'm like a fugitive tryna climb the walls but my hands are tied  
In just one touch and I'm infected by the sound crawling all over my skin  
And the sky is falling down, I don't know what's happening, beats so sick  
  
Running from the madhouse, they won't take me back  
Got the medicines to give me what I need  
Yes I'm burning up but music is my drug  
Doesn't matter if I shout or if I scream  
  
They're coming for me  
They're coming for me  
  
They're coming for me, oh oh  
  
Men in white coats, coats, getting so close, close  
Saying my prayers, don't take me back there  
Men in white coats, coats, getting so close, close  
Saying my prayers don't take me back,  
Take me back, take me back there  
  
They're coming for me  
  
Running from the madhouse, they won't take me back  
Got the medicines to give me what I need  
Yes I'm burning up but music is my drug  
Doesn't matter if I shout or if I scream  
  
They're coming for me  
It's like I'm running but I just can't find my way  
(I don't wanna go back)  
And they can't hear my voice no matter how I scream  
They're coming for me
