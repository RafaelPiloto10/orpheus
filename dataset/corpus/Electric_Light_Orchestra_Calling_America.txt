Somebody told her that there was a place like heaven  
Across the water on a 747  
Yeah, we're living in  
In a modern world  
  
And pretty soon she's really got the notion  
Of flying out across the big blue ocean  
Yeah, we're living in  
In a modern world  
  
Talk is cheap on satellite  
But all I get is static information  
I'm still here re-dial on automatic  
  
Calling America (can't get a message through)  
Calling America (that's what she said to do)  
Calling America (that's where she has to be)  
Calling America (she left a number for me)  
Calling America  
  
But I'm just talking to a satellite  
Twenty thousand miles up in the sky each night  
Yeah, we're living in  
In a modern world  
  
All I had to do was pick up the phone  
I'm out in space, trying to talk to someone  
Yeah, we're living in  
In a modern world  
  
She left a number I could call  
But no one's there, no one at all  
There must be something going wrong  
That number just rings on and on  
  
Calling America (can't get a message through)  
Calling America (that's what she said to do)  
Calling America (that's where she has to be)  
Calling America (she left a number for me)  
Calling America  
  
Said she'd call when she'd been gone a while  
Guess she's missing me across the miles  
Yeah, we're living in  
In a modern world  
  
Calling America (can't get a message through)  
Calling America (that's what she said to do)  
Calling America (that's where she has to be)  
Calling America (she left a number for me)  
Calling America
