I'm driving home from work  
Knowing you're not there  
I used to hurry home  
Now I don't even care  
The sun is in my eyes  
So I can't see  
But when it sets down behind the  
Mountain it's gonna be  
  
My first night without you  
My first night without you  
My first night without you  
Oh...without you  
  
I sit here like a fool  
Remembering everything  
The way we used to talk  
The songs that we used to sing  
I've got to try and leave  
The past behind  
But my memory's so good  
I think that I'm losing my mind  
  
My first night without you  
My first night without you  
And I wonder what I'll do  
Oh...without you  
  
Will I be able to sleep  
Will I lie in my bed and weep  
What if I forget  
And reach for you  
Will I dream about you  
My first night...my first night  
  
My first night without you  
My first night without you  
And I wonder what I'll do, oh...  
  
My first night without you  
My first night without you  
And I wonder how I'll get through  
Oh...without you
