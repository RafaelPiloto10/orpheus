Hooray for Hollywood  
That screwy, ballyhooey Hollywood  
Where any office boy or young mechanic  
Can be a panic, with just a goodlooking pan  
Where any barmaid can be a star maid  
If she dances with or without a fan  
  
Hooray for Hollywood  
Where you're terrific, if you're even good  
Where anyone at all from TV's Lassie  
To Monroe's chassis is equally understood  
Go out and try your luck, you might be Donald Duck  
Hooray for Hollywood  
  
Hooray for Hollywood  
That phoney, super coney Hollywood  
They come from Chillicothes and Padukahs  
With their bazookas to get their names up in lights  
All armed with photos from local rotos  
With their hair in ribbons and legs in tights  
  
Hooray for Hollywood  
You may be homely in your neighborhood  
But if you think that you can an actor  
See Mr. Factor, he'd make a monkey look good  
With a half an hour, you'll look like Tyrone Power  
Hooray for Hollywood
