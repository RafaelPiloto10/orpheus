[Verse:]  
I just sit here waiting for you to call  
Then I wonder if you're even calling at all  
So many thought go through my mind  
Wish you can be here all the time  
Cause I'm lost without you and I can't just doubt you  
And there's everything about you, I just live without you  
  
[Verse 2:]  
I'm still sitting here waiting for much more (Text me or something)  
I can't take this, I'm walking out that door  
So many thought go through my mind  
Wish you can be here all the time  
Cause I'm lost without you and I can't just doubt you  
And there's everything about you, I just can't live without you  
Cause I'm lost without you and I can't just doubt you  
And there's everything about you, I just can't live without you  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm breathing in, I'm breathing out  
Being with you is just no doubt  
I'm going crazy and there's nothing I should do  
I can't, Can't live without you  
  
[Verse 3:]  
I pack up my things and get on that plane  
Cause without you I can't be tamed  
So many thought go through my mind  
Wish you can be here all the time  
Cause I'm lost without you and I can't just doubt you  
And there's everything about you, I just live without you  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm breathing in, I'm breathing out  
Being with you is just no doubt  
I'm going crazy and there's nothing I should do  
I can't, Can't live without you  
  
[Bridge:]  
Please girl stay with me  
My heart is waiting for you  
I can't take this no more  
There's nothing I should do  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm breathing in, I'm breathing out  
Being with you is just no doubt  
I'm going crazy and there's nothing I should do  
I can't, Can't live without  
  
I'm breathing in, I'm breathing out  
Being with you is just no doubt  
I'm going crazy and there's nothing I should do  
I can't, Can't live without you  
  
Cause I'm lost without you and I can't just doubt you  
And there's everything about you, I just can't live without you
