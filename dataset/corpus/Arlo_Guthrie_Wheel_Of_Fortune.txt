[CHORUS:]  
Rolling, wheeling like I'm feeling  
Everything's gonna carry on  
You go your way, I'm going my way  
We will come and so be gone  
  
Wheel of fortune, turn for me now  
Turn to trouble in the West  
Wheels of completion rolling  
Wait to put my mind to rest  
  
[CHORUS:]  
Hey, Ezekiel, you can leave now  
You got to go or stay so long  
While your wheels just keep turning  
Turn to rhythm right and wrong  
  
[CHORUS:]  
Wheel of fortune, turn for me now  
Turn to trouble in the West  
Wheels of completion rolling  
Wait to put my mind at rest
