Just a notion that's all  
Just a feeling that you're watchin' me  
Every move I'm making  
Am I reading your mind  
Cause it's almost like you're touching me  
There is no mistaking  
Just a notion  
That you'll be walkin' up to me  
In a while  
And you smile and say hello  
Then we'll be dancing through the night  
Knowing everything from there on  
Must be right  
  
Just a notion  
But somehow I know I'm not wrong  
If it's our destiny there's nothing we can do  
But tonight is very special  
It's the night for me and you
