Let me take you down without a sound  
Dead before you hit the ground  
Blood washes my hand can't understand  
Sterilizing my pain  
  
Washed away with crimson tide  
By my hand I keep testing time  
Quench the fire that drives my soul  
Soothing me as death takes hold  
  
Peaceful and serene slowly bleeding  
Eyes once bright are now fading  
Pallid ashen face against my skin  
Staring blindly at some distant place  
  
Washed away by crimson tide  
By my hand I keep testing time  
Straight flesh lace adorns your neck  
Spilling your blood all over my flesh  
  
Quench the fire that drives my soul  
Soothing me as death takes hold  
Divine godsend enveloping me  
Spiritual ecstasy sets me free
