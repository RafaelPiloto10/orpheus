I've seen love go by my door  
It's never been this close before  
Never been so easy or so slow  
Been shooting in the dark too long  
When somethin's not right it's wrong  
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go  
  
Dragon clouds so high above  
I've only known careless love  
It's always hit me from below  
This time around it's more correct  
Right on target, so direct  
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go  
  
Purple clover, Queen Anne's Lace  
Crimson hair across your face  
You could make me cry if you don't know  
Can't remember what I was thinkin' of  
You might be spoilin' me too much, love  
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go  
  
Flowers on the hillside, bloomin' crazy  
Crickets talkin' back and forth in rhyme  
Blue river runnin' slow and lazy  
  
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time  
  
Situations have ended sad  
Relationships have all been bad  
Mine've been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud  
But there's no way I can compare  
All those scenes to this affair  
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go  
  
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doin'  
Stayin' far behind without you  
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm sayin'  
You're gonna make me give myself a good talkin' to  
  
I'll look for you in old Honolulu  
San Francisco, Ashtabula  
Yer gonna have to leave me now, I know  
But I'll see you in the sky above  
In the tall grass, in the ones I love  
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go  
Ooh, you're gonna make me lonesome when you go  
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go  
  
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go
