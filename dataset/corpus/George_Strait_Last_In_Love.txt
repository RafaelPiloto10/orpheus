Blues outside my door  
I don't even know if it's raining  
But I've been here before  
And I don't wanna be here again  
  
Ev'ry now and then  
voices on the wind  
call me back to the first time  
far away and clear  
you can hear the tear drops  
falling for the last in love.  
  
If I let you down  
All I can say is "I'm sorry"  
Now it's' all over town  
So I don't want to hear it from you  
  
Please don't look away it's hard enough to say  
This could go on forever  
When the night is clear  
I can hear the teardrops  
Falling for the last in love.  
  
Every now and then  
I hear voices on the wind  
I may love you always and always  
Far away and clear  
You can hear the teardrops  
Falling for the last in love  
Calling for the last in love
