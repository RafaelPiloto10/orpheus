Doo, ooh, doo, ooh, doo, ooh, doo, ooh  
Doo, ooh, doo, ooh, doo, ooh, doo, ooh  
  
My ears getting tired of listening all the time  
They've been talking lots of garbage all their lives  
And suddenly they decided to ring one back  
Ring-ring, ring-ring, my ears are ringing like a warning  
  
My eyes getting tired of looking all the time  
They've been talking a lot of winking all their lives  
And finally they decided to flash one back  
Flash-flash, flash-flash, my eyes are flashing like a warning  
  
My nose is getting tired of sniffing all the time  
She's been taking Memphis blues all her life  
And surely she decided to sneeze one back  
Sneeze-sneeze, sneeze-sneeze, my nose is sneezing like a warning  
  
My body's getting tired of taking all the time  
She's been taking lot of cornballs all her life  
Suddenly she decided to hit one back  
Bang-bang, bang-bang, she hits back like a warning  
  
She hits back like a warning  
Ring-ring, flash-flash  
Sneeze-sneeze, bang-bang  
She hits back like a warning  
  
She's gonna hit back  
(Yeah)  
She's gonna kick back  
(Yeah)  
You won't know what hit you  
Till you see her flashing  
(Yeah)  
  
She's gonna hit back  
(Yeah)  
She's gonna kick back  
(Yeah)  
You won't know what hit you  
Till you see her head flashing  
(Yeah, yeah)
