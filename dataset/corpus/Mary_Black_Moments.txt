These are the moments that we love so well  
Precious moments caught within a spell  
All too soon our lives thay fade away  
These are the moments that we wish would stay  
  
If I had my life to live again  
I would choose to be with you my friend  
Time moves slowly and it goes so fast  
And who knows how long the days will last  
  
So cherish deep within you  
The love you get today  
Let the moment linger  
Cause tomorrow steals that away  
Yes tomorrow steals that away  
  
These are the memories that we made so well  
Lives like stories that we long to tell  
When we're old with not too much to say  
We'll have the memories that we made today  
We'll have the memories that we made today
