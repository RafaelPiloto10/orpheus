I remember it was late one night  
In the middle of a dream  
Woke up in a pool of sweat  
Thought I heard a scream  
Ran over to the window sill  
Stuck my head out for a peek  
Dressed in black was a man I didn't recognise  
Running down my back street  
My heart skipped a beat  
  
[Chorus x2]  
You better watch out, there's a stranger in town  
You better watch out when he comes around  
Don't make a sound  
  
The morning paper and the head-lines read:Danger to the queen  
Buckingham Palace better tighten things up  
The son of a bitch is mean.  
Vendors on the corner just doin' their job  
Acting like nothing's new  
Scotland Yard's still looking for him  
But he doesn't leave  
A single clue  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
You better watch out  
  
Who's this man who fell out of the sky?  
What's he done and where's he live?  
How can a man who's a criminal be a hero to the kids?  
The old couple swear that the Riper's back  
They say it's him all right.  
The young girl says it's Jesus and he won't be back again  
Tonight  
I wonder who's right ?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You better watch out
