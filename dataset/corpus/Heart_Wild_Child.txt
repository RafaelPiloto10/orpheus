It's too late to turn back  
When the green lights flash  
Too late to turn around  
When the love goes down  
  
Your fire my fate  
This woman won't wait  
So love beam your laser light  
Get ready gonna take this flight  
  
You're so wild  
(you're wild and willing)  
So wild (your spirit's free)  
You're such a wild wild child  
Oh baby go wild with me  
  
Two hearts one mind  
Baby you're my kind  
You're too hot you're too much  
You've got that personal touch  
  
Push button play thing  
Make my back door ring  
Fight fire with a little fire baby  
You oughta know you make this  
Little girl sing  
  
You're so wild  
(you're wild and willing)  
So wild (your spirit's free)  
You're such a wild wild child  
Oh baby go wild with me  
  
Do your little shake baby  
Rattle and roll  
Ring my bell baby do my soul  
Don't let the grass grow under my feet  
Bang my drum baby feel my beat  
You're so wild  
  
You're so wild  
(you're wild and willing)  
So wild (your spirit's free)  
You're such a wild wild child  
Oh baby go wild with me  
  
You're so wild  
(you're wild and willing)  
So wild (your spirit's free)  
You're such a wild wild child  
Oh baby go wild with me
