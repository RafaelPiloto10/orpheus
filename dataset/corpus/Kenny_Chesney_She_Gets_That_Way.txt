If you see her down at a local bar  
Showin' all the signs of a lonely heart  
Don't you be concerned  
There ain't nothin' wrong  
It's not her fault  
She gets that way when I'm gone  
  
If she's on the floor for a dance or two  
Don't mean she's lookin' for a rendezvous  
She'll only be in his arms  
'Til the end of the song  
There's no harm done  
She gets that way when I'm gone  
  
She gets that way but I understand  
I know in her heart that I'm her only man  
And I can't stand to think of her home all alone  
  
So I really don't mind if she paints the town red  
What we feel inside doesn't have to be said  
It's a matter of trust  
And I know our love is strong  
That's why I don't worry none  
She gets that way when I'm gone  
  
She gets a little restless but I don't mind  
'Cause a woman like her  
Surely deserves to have herself a real good time  
  
So I really don't mind if she paints the town red  
What we feel inside doesn't have to be said  
It's a matter of trust  
And I know our love is strong  
That's why I don't worry none  
She gets that way when I'm gone  
  
No it's not her fault  
She gets that way when I'm gone  
  
No there's no harm done  
She gets that way when I'm gone
