I can't believe I am watching our love ending  
I wonder just how long you've been pretending?  
Pretending that our love was what you wanted  
While you were out there finding someone new  
Well, these days I don't dare look in the mirror  
Cause I can hardly stand the sight of me without you  
  
My broken heart might need a little mending  
And I lie here in the dark still remembering  
Remembering when we were so good together  
I've become a perfect image of a fool  
Oh, the picture of my future is getting clearer  
And I can hardly stand the sight of me without you  
  
Oh, the picture of my future is getting clearer  
And I can hardly stand the sight of me without you  
Oh, the picture of my future is getting clearer  
And I can hardly stand the sight of me without you
