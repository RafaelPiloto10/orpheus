The D.A. is dressed to the nines  
In the mirror he practices all his lines  
To his closing argument twelve hearts beat in favor  
I'm guessing that he read the morning paper  
The headline reads: "The man hangs, but the jury doesn't."  
  
And everybody's looking for relief  
The United States versus disbelief  
Mothers cast tears on both sides of the aisle  
From face to floor the body falls like bachelors or bad luck girls  
Only breathing with the aid of the knife  
  
Case open, case shut  
But you could pay to close it like a casket  
Baby boy can't lift his headache head  
Isn't it tragic?  
  
He glances at his pew seating seven to twelve stacked  
On one to six the gallery is hushed  
Boys in three pieces dream of girls' daring and bravado  
The city streets in a cell not withstanding what we don't know  
Hang on the rope of bated breath  
Whichever you prefer  
  
And everyone's looking for relief  
A bidding war for an old friend's grief  
The calls for chick, the calls for charm  
Another girl that's not aware but that can make you comprehend  
Too well dressed for the witness stand  
The best place for whichever headlines run  
  
Case open, case shut  
But you could pay to close it like a casket  
Baby boy can lift his headache head  
Isn't it tragic?  
  
First class suit and tie  
I'm desperate  
Sing and die  
Can talk my way out of anything  
The foreman reads the verdict and the above-entitled actions  
We find the defendant (guilty)  
  
Case open, case shut  
But you could pay to close it like a casket  
Baby boy can left his headache head  
Isn't it tragic?  
Case open, case shut  
That you could be the cause of that casket  
Baby boy can left his head and he cares  
Isn't it tragic?
