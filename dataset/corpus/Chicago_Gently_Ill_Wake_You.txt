Come to me, baby mine  
And I'll make love to you  
Just when the sun begins to shine  
On the morning dew  
I've been gone, far away  
The days they seemed like years  
Right by your side I'm gonna stay  
Kiss away your tears  
Gently I'll wake you  
I won't hardly shake you  
Gently I'll wake you  
I won't hardly shake you  
And I'll make sweet love to you  
Hold me tight, don't let go  
We'll dream the whole day through  
I missed you more than you could know  
I love only you  
Come to me, baby mine  
And I'll make love to you  
Just when the sun begins to shine  
On the morning dew  
Gently I'll wake you  
I won't hardly shake you  
Gently I'll wake you  
I won't hardly shake you  
And I'll make sweet love to you
