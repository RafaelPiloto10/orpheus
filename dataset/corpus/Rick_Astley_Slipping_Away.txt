I can feel your love slipping away  
Draining from my heart each and every day  
I can feel your love slipping away  
Draining from my heart each and every day  
  
People ask me how's your love affair  
I an only tell them lies  
When they ask me where you are tonight  
I can only fantasize  
  
You may find somebody new  
You'll say you love him, that's not true  
  
I can feel your love slipping away  
Draining from my heart each and every day  
I can feel your love slipping away  
Draining from my heart each and every day  
  
Everybody thinks we're so in love  
But things aren't always what they seem  
Even my best friend says we're so good  
Just how wrong can a person be  
  
You may find somebody new  
You'll say you love him, that's not true  
  
I can feel your love slipping away  
Draining from my heart each and every day  
I can feel your love slipping away  
Draining from my heart each and every day  
  
I can feel your love slipping away  
Draining from my heart each and every day  
I can feel your love slipping away  
Draining from my heart each and every day
