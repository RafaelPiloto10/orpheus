She a college girl, but her wrist Katrina  
In the kitchen, and she baking like Anita  
Hit the club, diamonds shining like I'm drinking Magarita

Getting the same car as the Beatles  
Got bricks in the Audi, the Hannah Montana, the molly go crazy

Got your main bitch on the handle  
She dropping and popping no castles  
I'm smoking on gas like tobacco  
I'm drinking on lean taste like Snapple  
In the VIP rolling a cord  
Passing out mollies to foreigns  
They popping them like they some skittles  
Two bitches one me, Malcolm in the middle  
Hop off up in the new Bugatti, cameras flashing paparazzi  
She popping that capsule, no Nazi  
I'm twisting the rock like I'm Rocsi  
She sweating like she ran a mile  
She soaking wet she need a towel  
She sucking her lip, biting down  
She moaning and making them sounds  
She came while she sucking me now  
I'm looking at her like damn  
Hannah making them go bananas  
She fucking and sucking on camera  
Pop a handle, she got stamina  
My Jag ceiling panorama  
I'm beating the pussy like Michael  
I call her Dirty Diana
