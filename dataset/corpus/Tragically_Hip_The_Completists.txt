You lured me with your diamond flower  
You lured me with talk of still more talk  
You lured me with caramelizing power  
You lured me a lot  
Clearly lifeless bare feet  
And dogs just trained to sniff  
You saw him struggle  
Then you saw him cease his struggling  
You said, we're halfway come and meet us  
We're the completists  
  
You lured me with your bad intentions  
You lured me with your Mexican pot  
You lured me with desert dimensions  
You lured me a lot.  
You loaded up your gear so well  
You can pack so tight  
But I can still hear your tambourine  
Demeaning you through the night  
Don't want to sound defeatist  
But we're the 'complete-est'.  
  
Intimate, inaccurate, a family, in a way,  
Made the trip to Vulnerable and back  
On the same day.  
Don' t want to sound defeated.  
You lured me into repetition  
You lured me to want to go to sleep  
You lured me into open spaces  
You lure me  
Clearly lifeless bare feet  
And dogs just trained to sniff  
You showed him struggle  
Then you showed him cease his struggling  
You said, we're halfway, come, and meet us  
We're the completists.  
Halfway come and meet us  
The 'complete-est'
