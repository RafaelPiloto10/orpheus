Woke up this morning with my mind  
Stayed on freedom  
Woke up this morning with my mind  
Stayed on freedom  
Woke up this morning with my mind  
Stayed on freedom  
Hallelu, Hallelu, Hallelujah.  
  
I'm walking and talking with my mind  
stayed on freedom  
I'm walking and talking with my mind  
stayed on freedom  
I'm walking and talking with my mind  
stayed on freedom  
Hallelu, Hallelu, Hallelujah.  
  
Ain't nothing wrong with my mind  
Stayed on freedom  
Oh, there ain't nothing wrong with keeping my mind  
Stayed on freedom  
There ain't nothing wrong with keeping your mind  
Stayed on freedom  
Hallelu, Hallelu, Hallelujah.  
  
I'm singing and praying with my mind  
Stayed on freedom  
Yeah, I'm singing and praying with my mind  
Stayed on freedom  
Hallelu, Hallelu, Hallelujah.
