I watch a man sitting down the park  
The flashy suit manufactured by the makers  
He's got a pen and he circles an add  
It makes him laugh 'cause he's reading dirty papers  
  
2-6-5-8-0  
  
She doesn't know but she's getting his call  
He's talking straight but he wants it in a strange way  
She combs her hair doesn't worry at all  
He could be mad but its just another pay day  
  
2-6-5-8-0  
2-6-5-8-0  
2-6-5-8-0 Oh, dial it if you want to know me  
  
She likes to live on the poor side of town  
She's shacking down with a guy from West Guiana  
The boys around always look at the ground  
Oh, what they'd give for a night with that piranha  
  
2-6-5-8-0  
2-6-5-8-0  
2-6-5-8-0 Oh, dial it if you want to know me  
  
She doesn't have to make her money that way  
She's such a pretty young girl  
I guess they love it 'cause you hear when they stay  
They cry oh, oh, oh  
  
This guy arrives looking scared as a rat  
He needs her love but he wants it like a brother  
Three hours later he crawls out on his knees  
She's laughing loud 'cause he's calling for his mother  
  
2-6-5-8-0  
2-6-5-8-0  
2-6-5-8-0 Oh, dial it if you want to know me  
  
2-6-5-8-0  
2-6-5-8-0  
2-6-5-8-0 Oh, dial it if you want to know me
