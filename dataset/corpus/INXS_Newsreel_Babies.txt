Venetian blinds are crackling  
I like the noise  
It's got texture  
Hit it again when I'm mad  
Close it again when I'm sad  
With the door closed I'm a king  
No questions  
No answers  
Don't like talking without reason  
What's the use if you stop feeling  
  
All alone I'm cynical to the TV  
Newsman's making passes to newslady  
Camera stops  
Newsreel babies  
  
I like to close all the doors  
Make it dark  
Make it cool  
Come in and talk  
Whatever you like  
I don't mind if it's something new
