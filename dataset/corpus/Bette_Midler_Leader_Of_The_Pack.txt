"Hey, Betty? Is that Jimmy's ring you're wearing?"  
"Uh huh."  
"Oh! Must be nice riding on that motorcycle after school, huh?"  
"Uh huh."  
"Is he picking you up after school today?"  
"Unh uh!"  
"Well, where'd ya meet him?"  
  
I met him at the candy store.  
He turned around and smiled at me.  
Ya get the picture? (Yes, we see)  
That's when I fell for the leader of the pack.  
  
My folks were always puttin' him down.  
Down! Down!  
They said he came from the wrong side of town.  
They told me that he was bad,  
But I knew that he was sad.  
And that's why I fell for the leader of the pack.  
  
One day my dad said, "Find someone new."  
New! New!  
I had to tell my Jimmy that,  
Whoa, we were through.  
He stood up and then he asked me why.  
But all I could do was cry.  
I'm sorry I hurt you,  
The leader of the pack.  
  
He sort of smiled and he kissed me goodbye.  
The tears were beginning to show.  
And as he drove away from me  
On that rainy, rainy night,  
I begged him to go slow.  
But whether he heard me  
I'll never, never, never, never know!  
Look out now, now, look out!  
Whoa oh no no no! Whoa no no no! No! No!  
  
I felt so helpless! What could I do-wo-wo-wo-wo?  
The only, only love that we had was through.  
At school they all stop and stare.  
I can't hide the tears.  
I just don't care!  
I will never forget you,  
The leader of the pack!  
Whoa-oo-woh! Gone gone gone!  
Gone gone gone!  
The leader of the pack is,  
Now he's gone!  
The leader of the pack is,  
Now he's gone!  
The leader of the pack is, whoa gone!  
Gone gone gone!  
Gone gone gone!  
Gone gone gone!
