I've been so caught up in the thought of me and you  
Even though I love someone else, I know my heart belongs to you  
Maybe we should just try to hide the things we feel inside,  
Things I know we can't deny  
  
[Chorus:]  
Should've never told you that I cared about you  
Didn't think that it would be so bad  
Should've never kissed you  
Should've never held your hand  
  
Gotta find a way to let these feelings go  
What did I do the day I let you slip into my soul (My soul)  
It was then, when I realized that I would always want you in my life  
(In my life)  
No one else, can know of the things that we were saying on the telephone  
It would be, so bad if they ever knew that me and you were secretly into each
other  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Gotta find a way to let these feelings go  
Oh, I'm so scared, trembling inside 'cause I'm feelin' like somebody else  
Already knows  
Oh, my god, I love you boy so much but to have to choose between the two,  
is hurting me so deep inside  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't ever want to feel this way again  
  
[Chorus]
