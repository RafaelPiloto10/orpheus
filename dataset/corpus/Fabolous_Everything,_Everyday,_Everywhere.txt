Same shit different day just riding through the city looking prettiest as
usual  
It's the same old thing got the name on the chain just to let them know who's
who  
And they know I've over here so they come and find me right after they lose
you  
For you niggas in the way we can let the guns say "excuse you"  
At the end of the day we just trying find our way and I might be a come up  
And baby you hitch a ride but u gotta know how to do more than how to keep a
thump up  
It's so incredible that it ain't edible but they know the cake's real  
Yo I couldn't even say ask these other silicon niggas how being fake feel  
  
[Chorus]  
Everyday is my day I'ma do it my way everyday  
Everything about me, what they love about me everything  
Everywhere that I be, feel VIP baby  
And everybody's cool, but y'all just ain't me  
  
Somebody better tell em that we in this bitch like an unborn baby  
See we be everywhere, and they ain't never there, couldn't tell you where they
be  
And you already know you ain't gotta ask me you can see that everything is up  
And I'm so bout my money you ain't talking about no money you ain't even gotta
bring it up  
And I hope you don't think me give a sugar honey iced tea or a middle finger
up  
I just stay sucker-free, leave the lames where they be, and I let my chips
pringle up  
Everybody calm down, there's enough to go around, you just gotta say how much
you want  
Don't know what you're looking for, unless it's a problem, I promise this
ain't what you want  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Can you do me this favor, answer this question, y'all gon try who  
See the shoes by Gucci, bag by Louie, the hating'll be by you  
And I appreciate the love, thank the man above cause a nigga feel so blessed  
And I ain't gonna stop, better get them red bulls, I don't give these haters
no rest  
  
[Chorus]
