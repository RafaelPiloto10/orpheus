[Verse]  
Do you wanna, do you wanna be  
Do you wanna, do you wanna be  
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, free  
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy  
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy  
Do you wanna be, happy  
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy  
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy  
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, free  
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be happy  
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, free  
Free from pain, free from scars  
Free to sing, free from bars  
Free my dawgs, you're free to go  
Block gets shot, the streets is cold  
Free to love, to each his own  
Free from bills, free from pills  
You roll it loud, the speakers blow  
Life get hard, you eat your soul  
It clears your mind, learn to fly  
Then reach the stars, you take your time  
And look behind and said what I can  
Look how far I done came  
They say that dreams come true  
And when they do that there's a beautiful thing  
Do you wanna, do you wanna be, happy  
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be, free  
I said do you wanna, do you wanna be
