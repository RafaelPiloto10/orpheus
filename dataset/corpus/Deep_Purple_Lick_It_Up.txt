My shoes are heavy  
My feet are winding down  
I look for her in corners  
But she's not around  
What I eat is eating me  
It hits me hard  
I'm one jack short of a royal flush  
A stranger holds the card  
Here come the salvation in the shape of my guitar  
And I'm gonna ride it like a shooting star  
  
I don't want your money  
I don't want your soul  
I don't need a reason  
I just want to get right down and lick it up  
  
Mother Mercy told me  
A picture never lies  
She told me no self respecting hero ever cries  
The prisoner walks in circles  
The victim walks alone  
Scissors cut the paper  
The paper wraps the stone  
Standing at the entrance to the gates of paradise  
The lights go down, the heat goes up, that's when I cry  
  
I don't want your money  
I don't want your soul  
I don't a reason  
I just want to get right down and lick it up  
  
I put my faith in fortune reaching for the sky  
The only game in town that gets me high  
  
I don't want your money  
I just want to get right down and lick it up  
I don't want your soul  
I just want to get right down and lick it up  
I don't need a reason  
I just want to get right down and lick it up
