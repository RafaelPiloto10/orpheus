If you're ready for the street  
You want to mix it in some fight  
Let me tell you somethin'  
Now I don't want to get you uptight  
But if you're in a corner  
And you can't find no way out  
Don't look around for no help  
No, no there won't be any around  
  
Expect no mercy, expect no mercy  
Expect no mercy, expect no mercy  
  
So you think you got a case  
And you think you know the score  
No you don't want to listen  
You can't be told no more  
But wait'll you get out there  
You better do it right  
'Cause the streets are lined with things that kill  
And they're hidin' in the night  
  
Expect no mercy, expect no mercy  
Expect no mercy, expect no mercy  
Expect no mercy, expect no mercy  
Expect no mercy, expect no mercy  
  
Feel that you can cut it  
You think you got the time  
They'll only give you one chance  
Better get it right first time  
And the game you're playing  
If you lose you gotta pay  
If you make just one wrong move  
You'll get blown away  
  
Expect no mercy, expect no mercy  
Expect no mercy, expect no mercy  
Expect no mercy, expect no mercy  
Expect no mercy, expect no mercy
