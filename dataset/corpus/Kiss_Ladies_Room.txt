Every time it's the same  
What bothers me is my fame  
You're what I need to play the game  
You say you like to dance  
Mmm, I think I'll take a chance  
Ooh, baby, maybe it's time for romance  
You're such a jewel in the rough  
You wanna show me your stuff  
For my money, you can't be too soon  
Meet, meet you in the ladies room  
Meet, meet you in the ladies room  
For my money, you can't be too soon  
You say you like to play  
Well, it's too late for you to get away  
And you've gotta believe me, when I say  
Baby, you're such a jewel in the rough  
You wanna show me your stuff  
For my money, you can't be too soon  
Meet, meet you in the ladies room  
Meet, meet you in the ladies room  
For my money, you can't be too soon  
You can't be too soon  
You're such a jewel in the rough  
You wanna show me your stuff, come on baby  
For my money, you can't be too soon  
  
I'll meet you, greet you in the ladies room  
For my money, you can't be too soon  
Meet you, greet you in the ladies room  
I'll meet you, greet you in the ladies room  
For my money, you can't be too soon  
Meet you, greet you in the ladies room  
Mmm, meet, meet you in the ladies room  
  
Meet, meet you in the ladies room  
I'll meet you, greet you in the ladies room  
For my money, you can't be too soon  
I'll meet, meet you in the ladies room  
I'll meet you, greet you in the ladies room  
For my money, you can't be too soon  
Meet, meet you in the ladies room
