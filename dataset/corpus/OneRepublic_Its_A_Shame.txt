Oh I tried to get to you  
Pushed in the end to break me through  
I tried with all I had  
You left me standing empty handed  
  
Well time has passed  
Nothing ever lasts  
  
So now you confess that you need me  
And now you release what you're feeling  
But how is this supposed to ever be the same  
  
Oh it's a shame  
It's a shame  
Oh it's a shame  
Oh it's a shame  
Yeah  
  
You got the best of me  
Got me a reason  
Got me on my knees, yeah  
My love I lost my pride  
Searching for something I couldn't find  
  
Well the time that passed has brought a change of heart  
  
And now you confess that you need me  
And now you release what you're feeling  
But how is this supposed to ever be the same  
  
Oh it's a shame  
It's a shame  
Oh it's a shame  
You know it's a shame  
Yeah  
  
Ooh, ooh  
  
Well you got the best of me  
I said love got the best of me  
Saying you got the best of me  
And I'm afraid it will never be the same  
  
It's a shame  
It's a shame  
Oh it's a shame  
You know it's a shame, oh  
It's a shame  
It's a shame  
Oh it's a shame  
You know it's a shame, oh  
Yeah  
  
Well you got the best of me  
Ooh
