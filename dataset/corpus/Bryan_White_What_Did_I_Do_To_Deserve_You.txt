Unbelievable describes your smile so sweet  
Inconceivable that you're a part of me  
The innocent look in your eyes  
Love without compromise for me  
It's a mystery  
  
What did I do to deserve you?  
Only God's hands could have made you  
And brought this dream to life  
Always swore that I, I would never fall  
I guess miracles happen after all  
And what did I ever do to deserve you?  
  
Unconventional describes my love for you  
Unconditional 'cause there's nothing I won't do  
I pray as this feeling grows  
That you'll always touch the heart and so love me  
It's a mystery  
  
What did I do to deserve you?  
Only God's hands could have made you  
And brought this dream to life  
Always swore that I, I would never fall  
I guess miracles happen after all  
And what did I ever do to deserve you?  
  
I've waited all my life  
To hold such a treasure  
What is this feeling worth?  
There's no measure  
What did I do?  
  
You brought this dream to life  
  
Always swore that I, I would never fall  
I guess miracles happen after all  
And what did I ever do to deserve you?  
  
To deserve you?  
To deserve you?
