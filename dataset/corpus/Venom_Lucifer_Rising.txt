A sense of doom the warning  
This is our Christ returning  
The tide of fear arising  
We light the candles to sing  
Lucifer rising - Rising  
Lucifer rising - Look into the light  
Lucifer rising - Rising  
Lucifer rising  
A sense of tread the danger  
We welcome the dark stranger  
To bring infernal glory  
Rewrite biblical stories  
A hopelessness foreboding  
Forgotten tales corroding  
The laughter turns to crying  
While Nazarene lies dying
