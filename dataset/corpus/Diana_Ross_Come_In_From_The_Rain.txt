Well, hello there  
Good old friend of mine  
You've been reaching for yourself  
For such a long time  
There's so much to say  
No need to explain  
Just an open door for you  
To come in from the rain  
  
It's a long road  
When you're all alone  
And a man like you  
Will always take the long way home  
There's no right or wrong  
I'm not here to blame  
I just want to be the one  
Who keeps you from the rain  
From the rain  
  
And it looks like sunny skies  
Now that I know you're alright  
Time has left us older  
Wiser, I know I am  
  
'Cause I think of us  
Like an old cliche  
But it doesn't matter  
'Cause I love you anyway  
Come in from the rain  
  
And it looks like sunny skies  
Now that I know you're alright  
Time has left us older  
Wiser, I know I am  
  
And it's good to know  
My best friend has come home again  
  
'Cause I think of us  
Like an old cliche  
But it doesn't matter  
'Cause I love you anyway  
Coming from the rain  
  
Come in from the rain  
Come in from the rain
