So they say that a man can't live in this world  
If he's wearing his heart on his sleeve  
I can  
  
And they say that a man can't understand  
What a women needs when she cries  
I can  
I can  
  
And I can see you standing in the yard  
Tending the roses in your garden  
The sun is shining through your cotton dress  
And I will freeze this moment here in time  
I could live forever in your garden  
Ah yes  
Yes I can  
  
Fool doesn't know what he's missing the most  
It's a bitch of a place to be in  
Here I am  
  
How would I know I could give up the ghost  
And still hold all your dreams in my hand  
Here I am  
Here I am  
  
And I can see you standing in the yard  
Tending the roses in your garden  
The wind is blowing through your golden hair  
And I will freeze this moment here in time  
I could live forever in your garden  
Ah yes  
Yes I can  
  
And I can see you standing in the yard  
Tending the roses in your garden  
The sun is shining through your cotton dress  
And I will freeze this moment here in time  
I could live forever in your garden  
Oh yes  
Yes I can  
  
And I can be your man  
Mmm, yes I can
