So money made you mean  
And that's not how it's supposed to be.  
You're ready to challenge and defend,  
Yeah, but for all the wrong reasons.  
How much do we really need?  
A question, if you have to ask  
Just means what it means-  
The question that says everything.  
Right and left it's all the same conspiracy  
Just cause you ask, doesn't make a difference to me.  
You could keep it all or give it away  
But where did it come from in the first place?  
Robbing Peter to pay me, and I'll just be  
Giving it back to Peter to feel free.  
Now you have to fix everything that's broke  
Cause it'll never leave you alone.  
Reinvent the wheel, be the butt of a joke,  
Take the long road to charity.  
Right or left it's all the same conspiracy  
Robbing Peter to pay Paul  
Or robbing Peter to pay me.  
Robbing Peter to pay Paul  
Or robbing Peter to pay me.  
Yeah it's just too hard, oh well, jump in.  
Forget about the sharks and swim,  
Cause now you're one, now you're one.  
You can't deny it anymore.  
Right or left it's all the same conspiracy  
Robbing Peter to pay Paul  
Or robbing Peter to pay me.  
Robbing Peter to pay Paul  
Or robbing Peter to pay me.  
You can't deny it anymore.
