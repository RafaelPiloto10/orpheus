Sweet silver angels over the sea  
Please come down flying low for me  
  
One time I trusted a stranger  
'Cause I heard his sweet song  
It was gently enticing me  
But there was something wrong  
And when I turned  
He was gone  
Blinding me  
His song remains reminding me  
He's a bandit and a heartbreaker  
My Jesus was a cross maker  
  
Sweet silver angels over the sea  
Please come down flying low for me  
  
He wages war with the devil  
With a pistol by His side  
He's always chasing him out of windows  
And He won't give him a place to hide  
But he keeps His door  
Open wide  
Fighting him  
He lights a lamp inviting him  
He's a bandit and a heartbreaker  
My Jesus was a cross maker  
Yeah, Jesus was a cross maker  
  
I heard the thunder come rumblin'  
The light never looked so dim  
I see the junction get nearer  
And danger is in the wind  
And either road's lookin' grim  
  
Hidin' me, I flee, desire dividin' me  
He's a bandit and a heartbreaker.  
Oh, but Jesus was a cross maker  
Yes, Jesus was a cross maker
