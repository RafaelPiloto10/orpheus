Poor little, sad little blue Bluesette  
Don't you cry, don't you fret  
You can bet one lucky day you'll waken  
And your blues will be forsaken  
Some lucky day lovely love will come your way  
  
If there is love in your heart to share  
Dear Bluesette, don't despair  
Some blue boy is waiting just like you  
To find a someone to be true to  
Two loving arms you can nestle in to stay  
  
Get set, Bluesette  
True love is coming  
Your lonely heart soon will be humming  
  
Pretty little Blusette  
Musn't be a mourner  
Have you heard the news yet?  
Love's 'round the corner  
Love wrapped in rainbows and tied with pink ribbons  
To make your next springtime  
Your gold wedding ring time
