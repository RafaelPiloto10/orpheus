For so long, you've gone on  
Trying to see an end to it all  
And I know, your grip is getting loose  
You think if you leave  
The pain will go away  
But you don't know  
You need it to get through  
'Cause I can tell by the things you say  
That your feelings will never change  
You'll keep coming back to what you know is true  
It's okay to want to be free  
It's okay to spread your wings  
If you know how to fly  
So for now, you go on  
Crawling along for a while  
But you're dragging me down  
You're holding me back  
You're making it end  
'Cause I can tell by the things you say  
That your feelings will never change  
You'll keep coming back to what you know is true  
Chorus  
You can fly  
Chorus  
It's okay to close your eyes  
It's okay to fade away  
If you don't want to stay  
'Cause you can fly  
You can fly
