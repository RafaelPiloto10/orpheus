In blood their names were written  
To hell their souls committed  
Three hundred years have passed  
The book still binds  
Corbis still waits  
  
It's what you put your faith in  
Return what has been taken  
Fiends he's set to find  
They have no eyes  
For them it's too late  
  
It's pouring down  
It's come for you  
  
Nearer draws it's shadow  
Furious winds howl  
Darker than their souls  
The storm arrives  
Exposing its prey  
  
Striking without warning  
The tempest holds their jury  
Judgment has been cast  
Falling from the sky  
There's no escape  
  
It's pouring down  
It's come for you  
The devil's rain  
  
It's pouring down  
It's come for you  
  
It's pouring down  
It's come for you  
The devil's rain  
  
It's pouring down  
It's come for you  
The devil's rain  
It's pouring down
