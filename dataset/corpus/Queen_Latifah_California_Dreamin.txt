All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray  
Away for a walk on a winter's day  
I'd be so safe and warm if I was in L.A.  
California dreamin' on such a winter's day  
I stopped into a church yes I did, that I passed along the way  
And I got down on my knees down on my knees  
And I pretended to pray, you know the preacher he likes it cold  
'Coz he knows I'm gonna stay, as he knows I'm gonna stay  
California dreamin' on such a winter's day, oh yeah  
All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray  
I've been for a walk on a cold winter's day, yeah  
I'd be so safe and warm if I was in L.A  
California dreamin' on such a winter's day  
On such a winter's day, on such a winter's day  
California, California dreamin', California dreamin'  
Play that for me  
I know it's just a dream, dream of California dreamin'
