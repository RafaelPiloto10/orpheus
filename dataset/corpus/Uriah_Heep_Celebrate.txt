Celebrate, celebrate  
Dance to the music ...  
  
Slippin' away, sittin' on a pillow  
Waitin' for night to fall  
Girl in a dream, sittin' on a pillow  
This is the night  
We're going to the celebrity ball  
  
Satin and lace, isn't it a pity  
Didn't find time to call  
Ready or not  
Gonna make it to the city  
This is the night  
We're going to the celebrity ball  
  
Dress up tonight, why be lonely  
You'll stay at home  
And you'll be alone  
So why be lonely  
  
Celebrate, celebrate  
Dance to the music ...  
  
Sittin' alone, sittin' on a pillow  
Waitin' to climb the wall  
Maybe tonight  
Wherever your dream goes  
Woman alive  
We're going to the celebrity ball  
  
Dress up tonight, why be lonely  
You'll stay at home  
And you'll be alone  
So why be lonely  
  
Celebrate, celebrate  
Dance to the music ...
