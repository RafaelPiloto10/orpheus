You say you're well and satisfied  
But your body tells me something else  
What is it, baby? Tell me, tell me  
Speak up, give it to me straight  
  
Or, well, never know what you think  
Or what you want  
  
She says she's truly gratified  
But her voice tells me something else  
What is it, baby? Tell me, tell me  
Speak up, give it to me straight  
  
Or, well, never know how you feel  
Or what you want  
  
Unless we teach each other  
What we really feel  
How are we gonna communicate  
And get ourselves together?  
  
He says he's never petrified  
But his eyes tells me something else  
What is it, baby? Tell me, tell me  
Speak up, give it to me straight  
  
Or, well, never know what you need  
Or what you want  
  
Unless we teach each other  
What we really feel  
How are we gonna communicate  
And get ourselves together?  
  
I'm watching your body talk  
I'm listening to your double talk  
Straight talk's the only way  
Straight talk's the shortest way for you and I  
  
I'm watching your body talk  
I'm listening to your double talk  
Straight talk's the only way  
Straight talk's the shortest way, then the world is one  
  
Straight talk's the only way  
Straight talk's the shortest way  
Straight talk's the only way  
Straight talk's the shortest way  
  
Straight talk's the only way  
Straight talk's the shortest way  
Straight talk's the only way  
Straight talk's the shortest way  
  
Straight talk's the only way  
Straight talk's the shortest way  
Straight talk's the only way  
Straight talk's the shortest way
