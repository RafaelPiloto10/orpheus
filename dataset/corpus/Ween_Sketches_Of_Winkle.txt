Ah she danced like a floozie in a hot tub of guava  
Achin' round the scene, you know she's hip to her mantra  
He was a meditated fucker all strung-out on Sinatra  
Hitting van Winkle like there ain't no tomorr-a  
  
I saw van Winkle show up on the scene  
I can't remember when I saw that's he's been doing all the  
Sketches of Winkle crying to the heavens in a fit of rage  
Sketches of Winkle keep little humans locked up in a cage  
Sketches of Winkle I think I love her but she don't love me  
Sketches of Winkle why don't you love me, girl?  
  
She drained all the fluid from the sink in the kitchen  
Achin' round these all she's doin' is bitchin'  
Steven said he went and bought a new pair of mittens  
Mean Ween cut me and he said he was kidding  
  
I saw van Winkle show up on the scene  
I can't remember when I saw that's he's been doing all the  
Sketches of Winkle crying to the heavens in a fit of rage  
Sketches of Winkle keep little humans locked up in a cage  
Sketches of Winkle I think I love her but she don't love me  
Sketches of Winkle why don't you love me, girl?  
  
Rip van Winkle rip rip Rip van Winkle  
Rip van Winkle rip rip Rip van Winkle  
Rip van Winkle rip rip Rip van Winkle
