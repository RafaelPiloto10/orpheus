It's raining outside  
But that's not unusual  
But the way that I'm feeling  
Is becoming usual  
I guess you could say  
The clouds are moving away  
Away from your days  
And into mine  
  
Now it's raining inside  
It's kind of a shame  
And it's getting to me  
A happy man  
Why should you want to  
Waste all my time  
The world is yours  
But I am mine  
  
Rain, rain, rain in my tears  
Measuring carefully my years  
Shame, shame, shame in my mind  
See what you've done to my life  
  
See what you've done to my life
