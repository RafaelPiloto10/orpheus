"The chronics blowin" [Repeat: x 4]  
  
blowin chronic to me is like a tradition to me  
I gotz the pid-amps so sit down and listen to me  
"don't go against me boo, go wit me"  
We could blow it all together and bobby brown and whitney  
  
Yea we got somethin' in commin  
Niggaz search a nigga but they never find in my vomit  
I got the stash spot,my cash got  
A lot of mutha fukin fo police shots  
  
I'm not the one, nigga you could call me the two  
Bob marley we incartinated pupils nialated  
Imaxipated,concentrated,debated waitin  
Many times you surprised how I made it.(huh?)  
  
You hate it (huh) but you no I ain't even trippin  
I'm splitin that skwusha up plotin it cum up  
I'm livin my life n never puttin my gun up  
Drinkin my drink n imma smoke that blunt.  
  
[Chorus]  
The chronic's blowin (x4)  
  
The greena the tree the better the bud  
The strenth of the branch will tell ya how chronic it was  
(huh?) buzzin high slide n slippin got ya listenin to snoop  
N feel like you crippin  
  
It's all goody-good the dash wood  
You got some hoes in ya truck n now you ready to fuck  
But

She don't wanna eat me now  
But now hollerin at jason  
Now, don't get madd  
  
Just roll to the pad  
Just keep it g on da bitch n roll anotha dubea

Then pass it to ya homie like a player or pimp  
  
And wen ya get dizza crack da dough  
And then ya get a little sizza  
'Cause ain't no fun if the homies can't get none  
Fuck,fuck pass my nigga
