Thought I get to see your face again  
But my flight got cancelled wouldn't stop raining  
So two days three flights later I touchdown  
But there was trouble with you family and now your outta town  
And I don't like it no this ain't cool  
Feelin like there's something just don't want me near you  
  
The world keeps getting in the way  
Trying to get to you but it seems like everyday is something new  
Baby the world keeps getting in the way  
With you is where I wanna be but it just won't let me  
Cause it keeps getting in the way  
  
Keeps getting in the way  
Said it keeps getting in the way  
Keeps getting in the way  
Keeps getting in the way  
Said it keeps getting in the way  
  
And now were in the same state  
But I be in the studio workin extra late (5 in the morning)  
And finally I get to leave (I'm comin home to you)  
But by the time I get there your already fast asleep  
And I don't like it no this ain't cool  
Feelin like there's something just don't want me near you  
  
The world keeps getting in the way  
Trying to get to you but it seems like everyday is something new  
Baby the world keeps getting in the way  
With you is where I wanna be but it just won't let me  
Cause it keeps getting in the way  
  
Keeps getting in the way  
Said it keeps getting in the way  
Keeps getting in the way  
Keeps getting in the way  
Said it keeps getting in the way  
  
Keeps getting in the way  
Said it keeps getting in the way  
Keeps getting in the way  
Keeps getting in the way  
Said it keeps getting in the way  
  
And I don't like it no this ain't cool  
Feelin like there's something just don't want me near you  
Baby The world keeps getting in the way  
Trying to get to you but it seems like everyday is something new  
Baby the world keeps getting in the way  
With you is where I wanna be but it just won't let me  
Said it keeps getting in the way  
  
Keeps getting in the way  
Said it keeps getting in the way  
Keeps getting in the way  
Keeps getting in the way  
Said it keeps getting in the way  
  
Keeps getting in the way  
Said it keeps getting in the way  
Keeps getting in the way  
Keeps getting in the way  
Said it keeps getting in the way  
  
Keeps getting in the way  
Said it keeps getting in the way
