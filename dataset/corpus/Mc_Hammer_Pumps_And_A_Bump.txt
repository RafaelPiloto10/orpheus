Just when I thought could I hit another one  
So up jumps see me with the pumps and a bump  
All stiggitty stiggity girls, getting on my good nerves  
Looking like ice cream ready to be served  
Wreck it, check it, can I get in it  
If you wanna kick it with a G baby here's me  
Cause I come equipped, I'm a pimp, a slippity slip, I suppose you take a trip

Pumps and a bump, now many say a big butt  
But if you're hip you know that it's a phone crud  
It's making the brothers go crazy in the 2-G  
Shake like a bottle girl fine as wine G  
So when I here I got a step (to a fine thing)  
Never been a coward (cause it's a eastside thing)  
Just step right up to the girl with the big butt  
Tell her what's up you got the pumps and a bump  
Men Ooooh! Everyone for the rest of your life there's a girl fucking tight  
Ladies! All everyone there's a man who is tight who can hit it all night  
We gotta get the pumps

I don't like 'em stiggity fat! (No!)  
I like 'em stiggity stacked (Yeah!)  
You wiggity wiggity wack if you ain't got biggity back (Awwww!)  
So when you hear the rump shaking on the dance floor  
Keep you bottling get your eyes and get hypnotized  
But a nigga like me will dance up to some chopping and chewing  
Keep em bottling you know I keep 'em bobbing  
I put my fingerprints all over that rump  
I'm guilty as hell but I love the pumps and the bump! (Ow!)
