You pick out your credit cards and check into the night  
A dozen tequilas and you're feeling alright  
So you swim to the disco, out of your depth, jaded gigolo  
Your lucky charms are tarnished so you leave alone  
But there's one place left to go before the taxi home  
After all, you made your marks  
  
One night you'll play Elizabeth Taylor  
The next night you're Marilyn Monroe  
Forever kissing frogs that think they're princes  
Oh Lady Nina, where did all the romance go?  
  
Your little sister babysits, your husband picks you up at six  
The make-up hides the bruises and the tears so they never show  
'Cause your beauty is the only thing you've ever owned  
It's the only way you've ever known to make your marks  
You made your marks, you made your marks  
We believe it's for real  
  
Lady Nina, I'd love to take you home with me  
But I love my wife and I love my family  
I've got a good job, responsibilities  
And I need to keep respect from society  
I know you'll never act with me, I know that you're in love with me  
So how do I compare to the sailors of the ships of the night?  
Was I all right, did you come tonight, Lady Nina?  
You made your marks, you made your marks  
  
Ebony flowers pinned to a velvet cushion in a red light  
And Edith Piaf sings a lullaby for the night  
Just made your marks, just made your marks  
Just made your marks, just made your marks  
  
You made your marks  
  
Ebony flowers pinned to a velvet cushion in a red light  
And Edith Piaf sings a lullaby for the night  
Just made your marks, just made your marks  
You made your marks, and you made your marks  
Just made your marks, and you made your marks  
Just made your marks
