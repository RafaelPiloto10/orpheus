All life we work but work is bore,  
If life's for livin' what's livin' for?  
She lives in a house that's near decay,  
Built for the industrial revolution,  
But in her dreams she is far away, far away  
  
In Oklahoma U.S.A.  
With Shirley Jones and Gordon McRea,  
As she buys her papers at the cornershop,  
She's walkin' on the surrey with the fringe on top,  
Cos in her dreams she is faraway, far away  
  
In Oklahoma U.S.A.,  
She walks to work but she's still in a daze,  
She's Rita Hayworth or Doris Day,  
And Errol Flynn wants to take her away  
  
To Oklahoma U.S.A.  
All life we work but work is a bore,  
If life's for livin', what's livin' for?
