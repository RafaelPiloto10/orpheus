I can't believe the news today  
Oh I can't close my eyes and make it go away  
How long how long must we sing this song  
How long  
How long  
Cause tonight we can be as one  
Tonight  
Broken bottles under childrens feet  
Bodies strewn on the deadened street  
But I wont heed the battle call  
It puts my back up  
Puts my back up against the wall  
Sunday Bloody Sunday  
Sunday Bloody Sunday  
Sunday Bloody Sunday (Sunday Bloody Sunday)  
Alright lets go  
And the battles just begun  
There's many lost but tell me who has won  
The trenches dugg within our hearts  
And mothers, children, brothers childres torn apart  
Sunday Bloody Sunday  
Sunday Bloody Sunday  
How long  
How long must we sing this song  
How long  
How long  
Cause tonight we can be as one  
Tonight  
Tonight (sunday bloody sunday)  
Tonight (sunday bloody sunday)  
(lets go)  
Wipe the tears off your eyes  
Wipe your tears away  
I'll wipe your tears away  
I'll wipe your tears away  
(sunday bloody sunday)  
(sunday bloody sunday)  
(sunday bloody sunday)  
Alright lets go  
And it's true we are immune  
(sunday bloody sunday)  
When fact is fiction and tv reality  
(sunday bloody sunday)  
And today the millions cry  
(sunday bloody sunday)  
We eat and drink while tomorrow they die  
(sunday bloody sunday)
