Mama said see it through  
Don't let the night put the bite on you  
Take your time make your plan  
Mama said son be your own best man  
  
Mama said play it straight do what you like only do it up right  
Take your time don't run wild  
Mama said son you're my one man child  
  
Mama didn't have that know-it-all-way  
She lived by the book and she prayed every day  
Never was a time when a rhythm or rhyme  
Or the words of a song ever slipped her mind  
  
Mama said go out there play at the game and you better play it fair  
Make sure your song get sung  
Mama said honey be your own big gun  
  
Mama didn't care when I never came home  
She learned how to cope with the end of the phone  
Dad went away to his place in the sky  
Mum said son he was a real good guy  
  
Mama said see it through  
Don't let the night put the bite on you  
Take your time don't run wild  
Mama said son you're my one man child
