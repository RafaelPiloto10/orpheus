Baby baby baby  
What's it gonna be?  
Baby baby baby  
Is it him or is it me?  
Don't make me waste my time  
Don't make me lose my mind baby  
  
Baby baby baby  
Can't you stay with me tonight?  
Oh baby baby baby  
Don't my kisses please you right?  
You were so hard to find  
The beautiful ones they hurt you  
  
Every time  
Paint a perfect picture  
Bring to life a vision in one's mind  
  
The beautiful ones  
(The beautiful ones)  
Always smash the picture  
  
Always every time  
If I told you baby  
That I was in love with you  
  
Oh baby, baby, baby  
If we got married  
Would that be cool?  
You make me so confused  
The beautiful ones  
You always seems to lose
