Say farewell to your fair weathered friends  
And not a second too soon  
To leave a life among ruins  
Well there was nothing left but to  
Cut ourselves loose  
These fascists and philistines  
Of violence and fashion  
These modern day philistines  
They stand on your hands  
They stand on my hands  
Any day now we'll perish  
These are nervous times  
No one can hold a candle to you  
When it comes down to virtue and truth  
No one can hold a candle to you  
And I dim next to you  
No one can hold a candle to you  
When it comes down to old-fashioned virtue  
Kingdom mine  
Open your eyes  
Make up your mind  
Am I Einstein?  
Or am I Frankenstein  
You said blow them away  
To kingdom come  
Or will the kingdom be one?  
No one can hold a candle to you  
When it comes down to virtue and truth  
No one, no one can hold a candle to you  
And I dim next to you  
Hi-ro-shima  
Yes yes yes!
