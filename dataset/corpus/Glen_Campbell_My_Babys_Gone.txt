Hold back the rushing minutes make the wind lie still  
Don't let the moonlight shine across the lonely hill  
Dry all the raindrops hold back the sun the world has ended my baby's gone  
  
I wake up almost every night and realize you're gone  
I toss and turn and stare at darkness waiting for the dawn  
I try to tell my lonely heart we'll make it all alone  
  
But it cries the world has ended oh my baby's gone  
Hold back the rushing minutes make the wind lie still  
Don't let that moonlight shine across the lonely hill  
  
Dry all the raindrops hold back the sun  
Though they know the world has ended my baby's gone  
Though they know the world has ended cause my baby's gone
