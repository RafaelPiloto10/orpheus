(Dum, dum..can't find anything  
Better to do...you drive me crazy)  
Sitting on a castle  
On the floor with Esmeralda  
Waiting for the Geezer  
Captain Crunch to come around  
Feeling suicidal 'cause of certain situations  
Hanging from the stairs too long  
I think I'm coming down  
It's time to Crash  
(Losin' my mind...yeah, it's time to)  
Doin' tons of colon blow  
Stuffing it in every hole  
Mile high, so am I  
Watching Jimmy kiss the sky  
Salle diner becomes a blur  
With everybody jammin'  
Republicans begin to sin  
The batwings start a slamming  
It's time to crash  
(Losin' my mind...yeah, it's time to)  
Crash  
(Yeah, maybe it's a little late but it's time to)  
Crash  
You drive me crazy  
You drive me crazy  
You drive me crazy  
Captain Billy Beemish  
Put a lamb up on a rack  
Thanks for coming Billy  
And we hope you're comin' back  
The castle will be waiting  
For the next bangers and mash  
Blanche and Marsha Reznick  
Put their marmack with their hash  
It's time to crash  
Losin' my mind, losin' my mind...
