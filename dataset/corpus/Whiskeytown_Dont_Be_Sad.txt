Seen a lot of things we didn't want to see  
But I'm glad we did  
I know a lot of times we fell out of line,  
But we fell back in  
  
I think we lost the keys to the kingdom,  
Before we'd seen them  
Don't be sad  
Don't be sad  
  
It took a lot time for us to find the words we'd mean  
We spent a lot time before our dimes run out, nickel please  
I think we lost the keys to the kingdom,  
Before we'd seen them  
  
Don't be sad  
Don't be sad  
Don't be sad  
Don't be sad  
  
'Cause we won't have to live this way forever  
It's hard to compromise the things we have  
Don't be sad  
Don't be sad  
  
Talk to one to have faith  
Money can not erase  
I think we lost the keys to the kingdom,  
Before we'd seen them  
  
Don't be sad  
Don't be sad  
Don't be sad  
Talk to one to have faith  
Money can not erase
