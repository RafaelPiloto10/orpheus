If there's rage inside you so you cannot think  
Spit it out  
If you get so angry that you cannot speak  
Spit it out  
Talk to him, or her, or it  
And tell them where they can put it  
Spit it out, spit it out  
You got to talk to him, or her, or it  
And take aim with your mouth and spit  
Spit it out, spit it out  
  
If you get worked over at your job  
Spit it out  
If a taxi almost runs you down  
Spit it out  
You got to take aim with your mouth and speak  
And give it to them right between the teeth  
Spit it out, spit it out  
Talk to him, or her, or it  
And take aim with your mouth and spit  
Spit it out, spit it out  
  
If you're patient and you have the time  
Spit it out  
Wait till they're on the decline  
Spit it out  
The Chinese say you meet the hard with the soft  
The Yin with the Yang  
The down with the up, oh  
Spit it out, spit it out  
You got to grab that dumb he, she, or it  
And give it to them right between the teeth  
Spit it out, spit it out  
  
Spit it out, babe, spit it out  
Hey
