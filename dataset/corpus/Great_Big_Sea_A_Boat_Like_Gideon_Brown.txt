Oh Gideon lived across the bay  
He's gettin' older now  
His boat is big and strong and bold  
She has a stalward bow  
  
But my father's boat was second hand  
One someone used before  
And after every fishing trip  
My father always swore  
  
That someday he would save enough  
To go to St. John's town  
And buy himself a big new boat  
A boat like Gideon Brown  
A boat like Gideon Brown  
  
Confederation came around  
And the days of old age pension  
He said 'Son I'm saving every cent'  
And this you must not mention  
  
You save the baby bonus too  
And things just might turn around  
And we'll have enough to buy a boat  
A boat like Gideon Brown  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause she can punch ahead in any gale  
And ride the fishing ground  
I often thought how proud I'd be  
In a boat like Gideon Brown  
In a boat like Gideon Brown  
  
Many years did pass away  
And Dad began to fade  
He didn't talk of boats too much  
He said 'Son I'm afraid'  
  
If things don't soon improve  
Then I'll be underground  
Before we ever get to see ourselves  
In a boat like Gideon Brown  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I sat and held his hand one day  
And he said 'Son, that policy'  
The insurance is all in your name  
You're the beneficiary  
  
And when I'm gone they'll pay you off  
Then go to St. John's town  
And buy yourself a big new boat  
A boat like Gideon Brown  
  
[Chorus: x2]
