[Verse:]  
It's another, if it ain't one thing  
Instigators, like pouring fire on propane  
The wrong thing, they be worried about  
Ooh, you know females  
And how they like to run their mouths  
  
Wanna be, wanna be, just like, talk like, you  
(like you) you (like you)  
Misery, misery, best company  
Don't let them change your mood  
  
[Chorus:]  
They try to get at me (They try to get at me)  
Behind your back (your back, your back)  
Tryin' to tell me that I'm just like the others  
But I ain't all bad  
  
No, no, I ain't all bad  
All bad, all bad  
I ain't all bad  
All bad, all bad  
  
I might make you mad, so mad  
My bad, no, I ain't all bad  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Between us, they wanna comment  
Your worst enemy some time be your best friend  
Perfect, ain't saying that I am  
Proven, it's proven I don't give a damn  
  
Wanna be, wanna be everything I ought to be to you (to you)  
Envy, envy, same thing as jealousy  
Jealous of you  
That's what they do  
  
[Chorus:]  
They try to get at me (They try to get at me)  
Behind your back (your back, your back)  
Tryin' to tell me that I'm just like the others  
But I ain't all bad  
  
No, no, I ain't all bad  
All bad, all bad  
I ain't all bad  
All bad, all bad  
  
I might make you mad, so mad  
My bad, no, I ain't all bad
