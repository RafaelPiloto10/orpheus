Download something  
Useful, or useless  
Because I'm lying here  
Wide to receive  
Almost anything  
You'd care to give  
And I don't  
Get along with myself  
And I'm not too keen  
On anyone else  
Turn on, plug in  
Then just walk away  
Unlock, process  
And then just go  
And I've never felt quite so alone  
As I do right now  
  
I'm lying here  
Wide to receive  
Almost anything  
You'd care to leave  
Wide, wide, wide  
Wide, wide, wide  
Wide, wide  
Wide, wide  
Wide, wide, wide, wide  
Wide, wide, wide, wide  
Wide, wide, wide, wide
