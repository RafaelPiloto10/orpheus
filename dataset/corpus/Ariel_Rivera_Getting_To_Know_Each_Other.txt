I call you and you call me  
It's funny how we get on so easily  
We're just friends aren't we  
You've got yours, I've got mine  
And friends are all we ever could be  
  
(But) We're getting to know each other  
A little too well  
(Getting to know each other)  
(A little too well)  
We're starting to show our feelings  
And people can tell  
( Ooh, people can tell)  
Every time that your eyes meet mine  
  
I light up like a neon sign  
Yes, We're getting to know each other  
A little too well  
(Getting to know each other)  
(A little too well)  
  
We have lunch ev'ry now and then  
And I find myself humming love songs  
Again and again  
Too many nights I'm workin' 'till ten  
And I hope that you know  
That It's hopeless to go on when  
(Repeat chorus except last line)  
(Getting to know each other)  
Getting to know each other  
A little too well  
(Getting to know each other)  
(A little too well)
