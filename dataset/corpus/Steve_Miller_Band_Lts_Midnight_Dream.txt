I've been in one place too long  
With my roots in solid air  
And I'm gone, gone  
Solid gone  
I'm dreamin' 'bout a bulldog  
And I'm too far gone to care  
And I'm gone, gone  
Solid gone  
Got a bulldog in my leer jet  
Gonna teach him how to fly  
By myself, gone  
Solid gone, solid  
If I live to be 500  
I'd die tomorrow night  
By myself, gone  
Solid gone  
If there's one thing I can't stand  
It's to be misunderstood  
By myself, gone  
Yes I'm gone, gone  
Gone, gone, gone, solid gone
