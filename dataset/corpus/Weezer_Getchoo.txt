This is beginning to hurt  
This is beginning to be serious  
It used to be a game  
Now it's a cryin' shame  
'cause you don't want to play around no more  
  
Sometimes I push too hard  
Sometimes you fall and skin your knee  
I never meant to do  
All that I've done to you  
Please baby say it's not too late  
To get you, uh-huh  
  
You know this is breakin' me up  
You think that I'm some kind of freak  
But if you'd come back to me  
Then you would surely see  
That I'm just foolin' around  
  
To get you, uh-huh  
  
I can't believe  
What you've done to me  
What I did do them  
You've done to me
