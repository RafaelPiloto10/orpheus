Things have been goin' wrong long enough to know  
Everything is right  
Been walkin' in the dark long enough to know  
Finally seen the light  
Been losin' long enough to know when I've finally won  
And even a blind man can tell when he's walkin' in the sun  
  
I've cried enough tears to know  
This feeling's called a smile  
Been bottom rung long enough to know  
When I'm doin' it in style  
Been runnin' so long I know  
There's no more need to run  
And even a blind man can tell when he's walkin' in the sun  
  
Oh, the wind is at my back  
And I'm sailin' on a ship that's overdue  
Well I've blown so many chances  
I ain't gonna blow this one with you  
I've seen enough bad times to know  
Good times have begun  
And even a blind man can tell when he's walkin' in the sun  
And even a blind man can tell when he's walkin' in the sun
