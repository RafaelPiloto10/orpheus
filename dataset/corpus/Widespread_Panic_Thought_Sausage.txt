Thought sausage fallen through your head  
Bits and pieces hanging in the shed  
Churnin' out links on the other side  
Cut 'em up again and stir it in the sauce, stir it in the sauce  
  
Mama's gumbo, silky fine  
Papa's birthday, takin' up time  
Tight little secret from my mama's side,  
Use a little secret and stir it in the sauce, stir it in the sauce, stir it  
  
Mama said "back out the kitchen 'til I'm good and ready  
Stuff ain't ready yet!"  
  
Mama's gumbo, bubblin' time,  
Aw, little baby, sittin' to the side  
Matter of the spatter just makin' him cry  
Swipe a little drop of it and stir it in the sauce, stir it in the sauce  
  
Thought sausage smokin' in the shed  
Tickle in the kitchen just losin' that head  
Laughin' out loud at supper time  
One more taste and stir it in the sauce, stir it in the sauce, stir it  
  
Mama said "get out the kitchen, daddy, 'til I'm good and ready  
This stuff ain't ready yet!"  
  
Mama said "get out the kitchen, daddy, 'til I'm good and ready  
Just come and get it!"  
  
Mama said "come on in this kitchen, daddy, 'cause I'm good and ready  
Come on and get it!"
