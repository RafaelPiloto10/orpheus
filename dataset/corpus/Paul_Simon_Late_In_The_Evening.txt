First thing I remember  
I was lying in my bed  
Couldn't a been no more  
Than one or two  
I remember there's a radio  
Comin' from the room next door  
And my mother laughed  
The way some ladies do  
When it's late in the evening  
And the music's seeping through  
  
The next thing I remember  
I am walking down the street  
I'm feeling all right  
I'm with my boys  
I'm with my troops, yeah  
And down along the avenue  
Some guys were shooting pool  
And I heard the sound  
Of a cappella groups, yeah  
Singing late in the evening  
And all the girls out on the stoops, yeah  
  
Then I learned to play some lead guitar  
I was underage in this funky bar  
And I stepped outside to smoke myself a "J"  
And when I come back to the room  
And everybody just seemed to move  
And I turned my amp up loud and I began to play  
And it was late in the evening  
And I blew that room away!  
  
The first thing I remember  
When you came into my life  
I said "I'm gonna get that girl  
No matter what I do"  
Well I guess I'd been in love before  
And once or twice I been on the floor  
But I never loved no one  
The way that I love you  
And it was late in the evening  
And all the music seeping through
