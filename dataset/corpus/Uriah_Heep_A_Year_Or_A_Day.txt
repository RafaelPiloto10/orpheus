Seen from the height  
Of a thousand miles  
The earth looks the same as it did  
How is it we can fly faster than day  
But we can't find the things we need  
  
Young man said the old man  
Let the youth in your heart be at rest  
We may all be dead  
In a year or a day  
When the devil is put to the test  
  
The day of creation  
Was our finest hour  
It's something we ought to defend  
But it's been so abused  
Since the first day of light  
That no glory can come in the end  
  
Young man cried the old man  
There is victory in staying alive  
And if you care so little  
For the world we're in  
Why and what do you  
Want to survive  
  
Can't we try  
To let the past go by  
With it's lessons firmly  
Settled in our minds  
To our children one by one  
And before the darkness comes  
Let us leave a world full of light  
Of a different kind  
  
In truth they should meet  
And with love  
Their hearts should beat  
And with patience  
Solve the problems of our time  
It wouldn't be so hard to do  
It's only up to me and you  
Let us not bequeath  
A life that is a crime  
  
Young man cried the old man  
Let the youth in your heart be at rest  
We may all be dead  
In a year or a day  
When the devil is put to the test  
  
Young man
