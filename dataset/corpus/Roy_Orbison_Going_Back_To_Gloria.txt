Going back to Gloria,the girl I'm dreaming of.  
Going back to Gloria,Gloria my love.  
Forget about the letters that i wrote to you.  
Forget about the many things we used to do.  
I don't want you to cry,but I must say goodbye.  
So long you're on your own.  
Going home,going back to Gloria.  
  
Going back to Gloria, the girl I'm dreaming of.  
Going back to Gloria, Gloria my love.  
I'll keep on pretending that I never cared  
And everytime we'll meet I'll act like you're not there.  
I will write no more letters. I'll make no more calls.  
I can't meet you anymore.  
Going home,Going back to Gloria.  
  
Going back to Gloria, going back to Gloria.Gloria.  
Going back to Gloria.the girl I'm dreaming of.  
Going back to Gloria,Gloria my love, Gloria my love.
