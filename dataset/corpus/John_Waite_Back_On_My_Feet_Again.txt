I was so lonely until I met you  
Told myself I'd get by without love  
Drownin' my sorrows  
Avoiding tomorrows  
  
Kind of felt that I just had enough  
You light up my face with your jokes and your smiles  
And the way that you came here tonight  
Don't know what you got  
  
But I'm sure glad I found you  
Could be wrong but it sure feels right  
And here I am  
I'm back on my feet again  
  
Here I am  
I'm back on my feet again  
Surprised at myself  
for the way that I feel  
  
So happy that you're  
here with me  
Some women I've known  
They've left me with nothing  
  
But I guess that was just meant to be  
And here I am  
I'm back on my feet again  
Here I am  
  
I'm back on my feet again  
I was down for the count  
I was down  
I was beat  
  
I was cryin'  
I was cornered and hurt  
I was hidin' my face  
Sittin' there cryin'  
  
I was so lonely until I met you  
Told myself I'd get by without love  
Drownin' my sorrows  
Avoiding tomorrows  
  
Kind of felt that I just had enough  
And here I am  
I'm back on my feet again  
Here I am  
  
I'm back on my feet again.  
Yes here I am  
I'm back on my feet again  
Here I am  
  
I'm back on my feet again
