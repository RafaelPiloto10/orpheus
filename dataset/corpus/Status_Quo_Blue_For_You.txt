When I get old and find the time  
I'll paint a picture about my life  
I'll paint it blue for you, I'll paint it blue for you  
You gave me love, a love so strong  
I treated you so bad, I treated you wrong  
Now I want to show, I feel so low, I'm blue for you  
  
When I was younger I tried so hard  
To find a good woman and give her my love  
I found a woman sweet as can be, I found a woman for me  
I didn't know I had the world  
I was still looking for ways to your love  
Now that I know, I feel so low, I'm blue for you  
  
Cheatin' and lyin', I played around  
Livin' and dyin', you stood your ground  
Cheatin' and lyin', you knew so well  
There's no good denying, you know me too well  
  
When I'm alone I realize  
Your eyes were smilin' but deep inside  
I saw the blue in you, everything blue for you  
You gave me love, a love so strong  
I treated you so bad, I treated you wrong  
Now I want to show, I feel so low, I'm blue for you  
Feel so low, I'm blue for you  
I feel so low I'm blue for you
