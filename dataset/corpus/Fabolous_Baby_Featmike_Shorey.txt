(feat. Mike Shorey)  
  
[Intro]  
Fab... [5X]  
Can you be my B-A-B-Y?  
  
[M.S.:] I'll never call another lover mine  
  
[Verse 1: Fabolous]  
And why would I, and why should I  
When I seen a lady tonight, with my good eye that I would try and make  
My..(baby..baby)  
I was up in the club putting my hood high  
When I saw you, and I stood by  
Just lookin at your onion girl I could cry, and I could lie  
I mean I could try and say you ain't sweep me off my feet  
But only one thing could keep me off the street  
And that's if you be my, B-A-B-Y  
I can be why you always be fly  
And I'm from B-Stuy, just like B.I...G. was, that's how F-A-B does  
We can sip something 'til we both be buzzed  
In a V-dub and that's only be-cause  
  
[Chorus: Mike Shorey]  
Need someone to be my (baby)  
Kind of girl you find in the club rockin those (baby) Phat jeans  
Gonna find someone to be my (baby)  
..I see some ladies tonight that should be having my (baby, baby)  
  
[Verse 2: Fab]  
After the baby talk, the goo goo ga ga  
You like this, that, you do bla bla  
Couple good jokes, a few brouhaha's, it's time to do you mama  
First I'ma put you on your back  
And make you scream out (baby)..just like I put you on the track  
  
Then I'ma lay you on your side  
And slowly stroke you while you telling me the way you feel inside  
But my sex drive won't make me play you on the side  
You know you get the keys any day you wanna ride  
And my baby know how to start me up  
You got the kind of kiss that'll speed a heartbeat up  
And you got the kind of touch that'll gimme the chills  
I ask you 'cause I know you gonna gimme it real  
It won't be fake, and don't we make a good couple  
And won't we make a good...(baby)?  
  
[Chrous]  
  
[Bridge: Mike Shorey]  
Ooh, if I seem just a bit taken, pardon me  
But you're so amazing  
I just want us to do this exclusively  
Say you'll be my baby  
  
[Verse 3: Fab]  
My baby's the only one I bring to the villa  
That can get the bling and the scrilla  
Girl, I know you smooth enough to spring a chinchilla  
And still take a sting of Tequila, the way you swing is a thriller  
I'm watchin that like the boxing match in the ring of Manila  
I wanna keep it comin like the singles of "Thriller"  
I mean if you still uh..my B-A-B-Y  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Intro: 'til end]
