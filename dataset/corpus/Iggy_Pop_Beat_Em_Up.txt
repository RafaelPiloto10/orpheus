Nice girl with a heart of gold  
A little naive, a little bold  
Knocked' up tossed' out and abondoned,  
Now she's living on random

You know they're cheatin' anyhow

Mom and dad worked and saved,  
Good and honest everyday  
For they're sweat , what did they get ?  
An old age home and a medical debt  
  
You gotta beat em

You know they're cheatin' anyhow  
They got beat up

You know they're cheatin' anyhow

We live in a machine, machine,  
We can't keep up with a machine
