What do I do with all the roses, outside?  
They're not suppose to grow this time of year  
It's a heart break but you got me smiling  
And you're the only one who can get me through  
  
I can hear your voice when you're whispering  
I can feel your heart when it's beating  
I believe you're near when the ghost comes in  
I can hear you when you're calling out my name  
  
I can remember when a day lasted forever  
Summer was everything and there was nothing to fear  
You were so tired but your heart sense so much  
Nobody else got through quite like you  
  
I can hear your voice when you're whispering  
I can feel your heart when it's beating  
I believe you're near when the ghost comes in  
I can hear you when you're calling out my name  
  
Did I get hit by the moonlight under the stars  
'Cause you feel so close that I can reach you wherever you are  
  
I can hear your voice when you're whispering  
I can feel your heart when it's beating  
I believe you're near when the ghost comes in  
I can hear you when you're calling out my name  
I can hear your voice when you're whispering  
I can feel your heart when it's beating  
I believe you're near when the ghost comes in  
I can hear you when you're calling out my name
