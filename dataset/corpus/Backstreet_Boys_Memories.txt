Memories  
The love I left behind  
I still think about it all the time  
Nothing stays the same  
Maybe I'm to blame  
Oh I, I'd do it all again  
  
Through these eyes  
I've seen a thousand lies  
And it's taken years to realize  
That nothing stays the same  
And no one is to blame  
But I, I'd do it all again  
  
Does it really matter if you got it right?  
Does it really matter who was wrong or right? (yeah)  
All I know, yes I know that I can make it through  
What about you?  
  
Ooh my my  
But ain't no way it's gonna change me (oh you wanna know)  
Ohhh  
Cause all the fear I've left behind (where you gonna go)  
Yeah yeah  
And only time will tell you what is meant to be  
  
There's a place  
I can't let go  
Holding all the dreams I used to know  
I wish it was the same  
I guess no one's to blame  
But I, I'd do it all again  
Yeah yeah  
  
Does it really matter if you got it right? (does it really matter?)  
Does it really matter who was wrong or right? (who was wrong or right)  
Looking at my life today and I'm alright (I'm alright)  
Yes I'm okay (I'm okay)  
Now I see the world in a better way (so much better now)  
And I know, yes I know that I can make it through (yeah)  
  
Memories  
The love I left behind  
I wish it was the same  
I guess no one's to blame  
No no nothing stays the same  
And everything must change  
Oh I  
I'd do it all again  
Oooh again  
Again  
Again
