Twenty-five minutes past quiting time  
Seven of us crammed into that truck of mine  
Payin' no attention to them highway signs  
Ninety mile an hour toward the county line  
  
Quick sack, twelve pack, back again  
It's a B - double E - double are - you - N  
  
My buddies and their babies lettin' down their hair  
As long as we're together it don't matter where  
Ain't got a lot of money but we just don't care  
Knowing that the fun is in the gettin' there  
  
Aztec, long necks, paycheck spent  
Oh it's a B - double E - double are - you - N  
  
I can't stop thinkin' what the Hell they were drinkin'  
When they made this county dry  
I got a week long thirst and to make it worse  
Lord it's my turn to drive  
  
Oh, laughin' and a braggin' and a carryin' on  
We loaded up the wagons and we're headin' home  
I guess half a dozen cases doesn't last that long  
Come tomorrow morning it'll be all gone  
  
And it's turn around, leave town, sounds again  
Like a B - double E - double are - you - N  
Like a B - double E - double are - you - N
