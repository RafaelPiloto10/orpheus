Heaven knows that you're an evil child,  
Drive me crazy, drive me wild  
Get home from work I don't feel all right  
Go in your bedroom you just want to fight  
Moving in, moving out, baby you move my mind about  
Don't give me no reason don't give me no lies  
Come to take you home from school you've broken all the rules  
All I need is a bit of your love  
All I want is a bit of your love  
All I want is a part of you  
  
Heaven knows that you're an evil child  
Drive me crazy, you drive me wild  
Get home form work I don't feel all right  
Go in your bedroom you just want to fight  
Movin' in , movin' out, baby you move my mind about  
Don't give me no reason, don't give me no lies  
Come to take you home from school you've brokin' all the rules  
All I need is a bit of your love  
All I want is to hold you tight  
All I need is a part of you
