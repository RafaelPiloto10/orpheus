Morning comes too early ,  
And night time falls too late.  
And sometimes all I want to do is wait.  
The shadow I've been hiding in  
Has fled from me today.  
  
I know it's easier  
To walk away,  
Than look it in the eye.  
But I will raise a shelter to the sky  
And here beneath this star tonight I'll lie  
She will slowly yield the light  
As I awaken from the longest night.  
  
Dreams are shaking set sirens waking up tired eyes  
With the light the memories all rush into his head.  
By a candle stands a mirror of his heart and soul she dances  
She was dancing through the night above his bed.  
And walking to the window  
  
He throws the shutters out against the wall  
And from an ivory tower hears her call  
"Let light surround you"  
  
It's been a long, long time  
He's had a while to think it over  
In the end he only sees the change  
Light to dark  
Dark to light  
Light to dark  
Dark to light  
  
Heaven must be more than this  
When angels waken with a kiss  
Sacred hearts won't take the pain  
But mine will never be the same  
He stands before the window  
His shadow slowly fading from the wall  
And from an ivory tower he hears her call  
"Let the light surround you"  
  
Once I was but I was found.  
When I heard the stained glass  
Shatter all around me.  
She whispers words to clear my mind.  
I once could see but now at last,  
I'm blind.  
  
I know it's easier  
To walk away,  
Than look it in the eye.  
But I have given all that I could take.  
And now I've only habits left to break.  
Tonight I'll still be lying here surrounded  
In all the light.
