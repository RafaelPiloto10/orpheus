She's right peculiar  
She'll try and fool ya  
But the girl keeps coming apart  
She's so appealing  
Right off the ceiling  
But the girl keeps coming apart  
What did I tell ya  
She'll buy and sell ya  
'Cause the girl keeps coming apart  
She's so affected  
I'm so rejected  
And the girl keeps coming apart  
Don't, don't, don't, don't let it get me down  
Don't let it get me down  
She's just a screamer  
A nightmare dreamer  
Yeah, the girl keeps coming apart  
She's like a call girl  
Loose ends and all girl  
But the girl keeps coming apart  
White lace and leather  
She's so together  
But still the girl keeps coming apart  
I feel sedated  
Boxed up an crated  
'Cause the girl keeps coming apart  
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't  
Don't let it get me down  
Don't let it get me down  
"So there she was  
Buns up and kneelin'  
I was a wheelin' and a dealin'  
My ace in the hole so to speak"
