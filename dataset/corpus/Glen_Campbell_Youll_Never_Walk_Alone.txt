When you walk through a storm hold your head up high  
And don't be afraid of the dark  
At the end of the storm there's a golden sky and the sweet silver song of a
lark  
  
Walk on through the wind walk on through the rain  
Though your dreams be tossed and blown  
Walk on walk on with hope in your heart and you'll never walk alone  
  
You'll never walk never walk alone  
(Walk on walk on with hope in your heart) and you'll never walk alone  
No you'll never walk never walk alone walk on
