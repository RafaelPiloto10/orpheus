See the sun rise over her skin  
Don't change it  
See the sun rise over her skin  
Dawn changes everything  
Everything  
And the delta sun  
Burns bright and violet  
  
Mississippi and the cotton wool heat  
Sixty-six a highway speaks  
Of deserts dry  
Of cool green valleys  
Gold and silver veins  
Of the shining cities  
  
In this heartland  
In this heartland soil  
In this heartland  
Heaven knows this is a heartland  
Heartland...heartland  
  
See the sun rise over her skin  
She feels like water in my hand  
Freeway like a river cuts through this land  
Into the side of love  
Like a burning spear  
And the poison rain  
Brings a flood of fear  
Through the ghost-ranch hills  
Death valley waters  
In the towers of steel  
Belief goes on and on  
  
In this heartland  
In this heartland soil  
In this heartland  
Heaven knows this is a heartland  
Heartland...heaven knows this is a heartland  
Heartland...heartland  
Heartland...heaven's day here in the heartland  
Heart...
