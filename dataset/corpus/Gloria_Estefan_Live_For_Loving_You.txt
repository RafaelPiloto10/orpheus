Oh, la,la,la,la,la,la,la, la,la,la,la,la,la  
Lying awake I turn to you as you are softly sleeping  
I think of what I'd like to do while you are somewhere dreaming  
I,I feel so happy by your side,oh why,I  
wonder,wonder,wonder why  
Find it hard to find the words to say what  
I am feeling  
I'm so in love I'm so alive and I know you're the reason why  
Why I'm so crazy(happy) all the time, oh why,  
I wonder,wonder,wonder why  
  
I need nothing else in life than to hold you  
I,oh I am in so deep, I don't need no sleep  
Just baby you and me  
  
Baby I live for loving you,oh,la,la,la,la...  
Live for loving you,all I want to do is love you,  
love you  
  
It would never cross my mind to find  
another lover  
'Cause after having been with you,there could  
never be no other  
I,just touching you I'm satisfied,oh why,  
I wonder,wonder,wonder why
