I know sometimes you're scared of the light  
But how will you ever know if you never try  
There's something new inside my heart  
And it grabs like a child whenever we're apart  
I see your face under every sky  
I find the less I look, more I find  
So let's go back there, back to the star  
You know I'm never gonna leave you  
You're the only one I want  
Let's go back there, back to the star  
You know I'm never gonna leave you  
You're the only one I want  
  
You know sometimes that I'm scared of the dark  
But I'm feeling sun babe when I'm in your arms  
You said my name in the dead of glory  
You hold me alright  
When I'm short of falling  
  
So let's go back there, back to the star  
You know I'm never gonna leave you  
You're the only one I want  
Let's go back there, back to the star  
You know I'm never gonna leave you  
You're the only one I want  
  
There will be times  
When we'll try to give it up  
Bursting out, it seems no doubt that will almost fall apart than burn to
pieces  
And we'll watch them turn to dust  
But without each other, nothing is easy enough  
  
So let's go back there, back to the star  
You know I'm never gonna leave you  
You're the only one I want  
Let's go back there, back to the star  
You know I'm never gonna leave you  
'cause you're the only one I want, yeah  
You're the only one  
Never gonna leave you  
No, I'm never gonna leave you, no
