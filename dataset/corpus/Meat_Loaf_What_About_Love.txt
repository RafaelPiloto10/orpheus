[Boy:]  
There's a hole in the sky tonight  
Did the moon drift too far from sight?  
I would search through this empty darkness  
To see your face in the morning light  
  
We've been lost in a sea of confusion  
Got caught up in a selfish illusion  
But make no mistake: I will bend till I break  
Don't let fate make the choice for us  
  
What about love that lasts forever?  
What about time to see it through?  
If you don't give you just don't get it  
What about me?  
What about you?  
  
What about love?  
  
[Girl:]  
Once in a lifetime you'll find someone heaven send for you  
For a lifetime you'll feel there's a reason to believe  
In a love that's meant to be  
  
[Boy:]  
It feels like we've fallen from grace  
Given up on the higher thing  
'Cause I know deep inside if we search we will find  
Something to give us wings  
  
What about love that lasts forever?  
What about time to see it through?  
If you don't give you just don't get it?  
What about me?  
What about you?  
  
What about love?  
  
[Boy:]  
I can't go on another day  
Comin' home and seeing you cryin'  
[Girl:]  
Can't stand another night  
Of telling you I'm fine when I'm dying  
  
[Both:]  
Forever means nothing  
To live without you  
Is reaching for something that never comes through  
Together is heaven  
Apart we're in hell  
The time for forgiveness is now  
  
Once in a lifetime you'll find  
Someone to share your dreams  
For a lifetime  
Our love will always set us free  
Forever we'll believe...  
  
[Boy:]  
I can't forget the feelin of your sweat upon my skin  
And the tremble of your body on the day you let me in  
It happens once, only once in a lifetime  
  
[Girl:]  
On a summernight's surrender with nothing to loose  
You were scared and so was I when I gave myself to you  
It happens once, only once in a lifetime  
  
[Both:]  
What about love that lasts forever?  
What about time to see it through?  
If you don't give you just don't get it  
What about me?  
What about you?  
  
What about love that won't say never?  
When you don't know what you can do  
If you don't live you just regret it  
What about me?  
What about you?  
  
What about love?
