Fairweather father  
Fairweather father  
Doesn't like to hear the baby cry  
Doesn't like to about the aches and pains  
Of the day gone by  
Of the day gone by  
  
But the mother advertised as a bargain wife  
She'd make things easy for the rest of his life  
And to make herself more appealing  
She'd think only of him and forget her own feelings  
  
Fairweather father  
Fairweather father  
Wants his wife to be the truckdriver  
Wants his wife to be the gardener  
And still look like a Hollywood Starlet  
And still look like a Hollywood Starlet  
  
So the mother gets mad and she leaves town  
That brings the father and the baby down  
She wants the father to find her  
Drinkin' orange pop in the seedy Greek diner  
  
Fairweather father  
Fairweather father  
Gets her back and gets up in the night  
Loves her so much and holds the baby tight  
Ain't that enough to make you cry  
Ain't that enough to make you cry  
  
Fairweather father  
Fairweather father  
Doesn't like to hear the baby cry  
Doesn't like to know about the aches and pains  
Of the day gone by  
Of the day gone by
