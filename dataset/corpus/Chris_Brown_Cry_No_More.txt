Never thought it'd catch me  
Never thought it'd cost me  
Never thought it'd hurt me  
Never thought I'd fall in love  
But I did  
  
I feel like somebody dropped a ton of bricks on my stomach  
(Now) I can't eat  
I can't sleep  
And it hurts me so deep  
  
I heard people talk about it  
And laughed like it'll never happened to me  
Now look at me  
It caught me  
See how quick karma comes around  
  
Who says a man is supposed to cry  
Wish I can crawl under a rock somewhere and just die  
Just want the pain to go away, today  
  
[Chorus:]  
I don't wanna cry no more (No more)  
And I don't wanna hurt no more (No more)  
And I don't wanna love no more  
Especially if it causes this  
I don't want no parts of it  
Because it hurts me so bad  
  
Even when it's sunny outside  
It still feels like it's raining (Yeah)  
No clouds inside  
But I still need your umbrella (Oh)  
Sometimes I wish I would've never let you in  
And then, wish I never met you  
Fell in love with you  
Then I wouldn't feel like I do  
  
Who says a man is supposed to cry  
Wish I could crawl under a rock somewhere and just die  
I just want the pain to go away, today  
  
I don't wanna cry no more  
And I don't wanna hurt no more (No more)  
And I don't wanna love no more (Yeah)  
Especially if it causes this (Causes this)  
I don't want no part of it  
Because it hurts me so bad  
  
Never thought it'd catch me  
Never thought it'd cost me  
Never thought it'd hurt me  
Never thought I'd fall in love (Oh, no)  
But I did (Oh, no)  
  
Never thought it'd catch me  
Never thought it cost me  
Never thought it hurt me, like this  
I just want the pain to go away, today  
  
I don't wanna cry no more  
And I don't wanna hurt no more (No more)  
And I don't wanna love no more (Yeah)  
Especially if it causes this  
I don't want no parts of it  
Because it hurts me so bad (So bad)  
  
Never thought it'd catch me  
Never thought it'd cost me  
Never thought it'd hurt me  
Never thought I'd fall in love  
But I did  
  
Never thought it'd catch me  
Never thought it'd cost me  
Never thought it'd hurt me like this  
Like, like this  
(Someday)
