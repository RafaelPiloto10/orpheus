Way out here you can see for miles  
If there was anything to be seen  
Maybe I could tell the difference between  
Where I am and where I've been  
So if I stare off in the distance sometimes  
And get that far away look in my eye  
It's that my baby went and left me out there  
All alone in the middle of nowhere  
Way out in the middle of nowhere  
Oh nobody wants to go there  
My baby's gone and she don't care  
That I'm out here in the middle of nowhere  
Standin' at the edge of the sky  
On top of a mountain so tall  
Wishin' to God I could fly, fly, fly  
When I ain't even done climbin' the wall  
Could you help me let the teardrops roll  
Awe anything to cleanse my soul  
Or if you've got a single raindrop to spare  
Lord I'm out in the middle of nowhere  
Way out in the middle of nowhere  
Oh nobody wants to go there  
My baby's gone and she don't care  
That I'm out here in the middle of nowhere  
My baby's gone and she just don't care  
That I'm out here in the middle of nowhere  
Yeah I'm out here in the middle of nowhere  
Yeah out here in the middle of nowhere
