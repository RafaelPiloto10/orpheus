In the twilight glow i see her  
Blue eyes crying in the rain  
When we kissed goodbye and parted  
I knew we'd never meet again  
  
Love is like a dying ember  
Only memories remain  
Through the ages i remember  
Blue eyes crying in the rain  
  
Someday when we meet up yonder  
We'll stroll hand in hand again  
In a land that knows no parting  
Blue eyes crying in the rain  
  
Blue eyes crying in the rain  
Blue eyes crying in the rain  
Blue eyes crying in the rain
