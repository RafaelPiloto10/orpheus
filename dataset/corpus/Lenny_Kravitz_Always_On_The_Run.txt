My mama said  
That your life is a gift  
And my mama said  
There's much weight you will lift  
And my mama said  
  
Leave those bad boys alone  
And my mama said  
Be home before the dawn  
And my mama said  
  
You can be rich or poor  
But my mama said  
You can be big or small  
  
But I'm always on the run  
  
My mama said  
That it's good to be fruitful  
But my mama said  
Don't take more than a mouthful  
  
And my mama said  
That it's good to be natural  
And my mama said  
That it's good to be factual  
  
But I'm always on the run  
  
My mama said  
Baby don't ride that crazy horse  
And my mama said  
You must push with much force  
  
And my mama said  
Go get all that you're after  
And my mama said  
That love's all that matters  
  
But I'm always on the run
