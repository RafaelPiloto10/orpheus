Falling in love  
  
Kiss the past till it's better  
Make it last if you can  
Tell me know you regret her  
I'll try to understand  
  
What was lost can be regained  
All the hurt can be healed  
There's no need to feel ashamed  
You've come back and I feel afraid  
  
Falling in love falling in love  
Falling in love all over again  
I'm falling in love all over again  
Falling in love with you  
  
Say goodnight to your bad dreams  
Feel no guilt for what's done  
Another past has been washed clean  
And the day has begun  
  
Falling in love falling in love  
Falling in love all over again  
I'm falling in love all over again  
Falling in love with you  
  
Falling in love with you  
Falling in love with you  
In love with you  
Falling in love with you  
  
I'm falling in love all over again  
I'm falling in love with you  
Again and again you've got me falling  
Again and again falling in love
