I'm sorry if I made you cry  
I'm sorry if tears fell from your eyes  
I'm sorry if I hurt you  
For that was not at all what I intended to do  
But just remember  
For every tear that falls  
From your eyes  
Two tears fall from mine  
I never wanted to hurt you, baby  
I never wanted those tears to fall  
I never wanted to make you cry  
I guess I should have taken a little more time  
For every tear that you cry  
Two tears fall from mine  
For every tear that you cry  
Two tears fall from mine  
For every tear that you cry  
For every tear that you cry  
Two tears fall from mine
