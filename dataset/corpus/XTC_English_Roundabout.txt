People rushing round with no time to spare.  
I'm so dizzy,  
I'm neither here nor there.  
In this traffic jam,  
I just want to shout,  
Let me off o' this English roundabout  
  
English roundabout  
  
And all the the horns go 'beep! beep!'  
All the people follow like sheep,  
I'm full of light and sound,  
Making my head go round, round.  
  
Everyone is cursing under their breath,  
I'm a passenger,  
I feel close to death,  
Hopeless situation,  
I have no doubt.  
Stop the madness, English roundabout  
  
English roundabout  
  
And all the cars go 'brum! brum!'  
And in my ears I feel a hum,  
The neons blind my eyes,  
All those tempers rise, rise.  
  
Cars and buses go,  
Puffing out their smoke,  
Roll my window down,  
I begin to choke.  
I have had enough,  
I just want to get out.  
Let me off o' this English roundabout.  
  
English roundabout.
