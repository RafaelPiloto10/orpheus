You can laugh and joke and make fun of your friends,  
Spin in the middle when your troubles begin,  
Take it nice and easy and always pretend  
That you're cool...so cool...so cool.  
  
Say, "I'munna hold onto that a while and I will and I'll be tame",  
Talk like a jerk on an educated brain,  
Be an old girl drivin' the young boys insane,  
Be a joker, a preacher...it does not matter.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Everyone needs a hand to hold on to  
Everyone needs a hand to hold on to  
Don't need to be no strong hand  
Don't need to be no rich hand  
Everyone just needs a hand to hold on to  
  
Havin' good luck with your financial situation,  
Play the ponies, be the president of the United Nation,  
Go to work and be a Hollywood stand,  
Drive your four wheel drive right into the mud, but  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
And in those hours when you're alone,  
And there's nobody there except yourself,  
I know it...you want to pick up the phone,  
And say, "Talk to me, talk to me, somebody please  
Talk to me!" Yeah!  
  
Ohh, yeah!  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
