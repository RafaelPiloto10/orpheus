He makes an inner arm block  
Then kicks off from behind  
The lights they go off  
But he can fight blind  
Cause he got the touch  
But he won't live long  
Cause he comes from Hong Kong  
Where people are strong  
  
Chinese bombs, millions jump,  
Chairman's junk USA  
Won't somebody, won't somebody  
Sink this place  
  
Got a cab to go to Soho  
The dragon says go  
Let everyone know  
You got the touch  
You come from Hong Kong  
Where people are strong  
And you won't live long  
  
Chinese bombs, millions jump  
Chairman's junk, USA  
Won't somebody, won't somebody  
Bruce Lee comes to save the day  
Bruce Lee comes to save Chinese way
