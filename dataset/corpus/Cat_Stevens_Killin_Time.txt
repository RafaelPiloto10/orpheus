People polishing guns  
They've got nothing better to do  
Though they think they're having fun  
They're just living to die, if they but knew  
Now, now  
  
All day long they sit at home  
Waiting for the milk to come  
Watch them turn into stone  
Thinking 'bout the things they might have done,  
Now, now  
  
You missed the point, you missed the point  
You really missed the point  
  
Everybody's got to know  
Love's the reason we're here  
No matter which way you go  
Love's gonna meet you there  
  
Killing time, killing time  
Killing time, killing time  
  
You missed the point, you really missed the point  
Made me cry, I wonder why, why  
You missed the point, you missed the point  
You really missed the point
