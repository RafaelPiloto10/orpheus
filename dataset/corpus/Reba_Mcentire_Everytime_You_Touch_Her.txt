Do you hold her all night long?  
Do you sing her our love song?  
Do you kiss her lips until love makes her weak?  
Oh darlin'  
Do you promise her the moon?  
Does she think loves coming soon?  
Does she know each move is made from memory?  
Oh darlin'  
  
Everytime you touch her (Every time)  
Everytime you touch her think of me.  
  
When she reaches out for you ,  
the same way my arms do,  
does she know the truth your love belongs to me? Oh baby  
Do you wonder in the dark if she sees into your heart?  
Do you close your eyes so she will never see?  
  
Oh baby!  
Everytime you touch her ,  
(Every time)  
Everytime you touch her.  
think of me.  
  
Nights were never made to spend alone.  
I can wish you love,  
but I can't wish you gone.  
  
Do you hold her all night long?  
Do you sing her our love song?  
Do you kiss her lips until love makes her weak?  
oh darlin'  
Everytime you touch her  
(Every time)  
Everytime you touch her  
think of me.
