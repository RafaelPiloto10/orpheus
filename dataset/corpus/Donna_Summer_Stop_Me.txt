I was weak and I was blind  
You know I never ever wanted to put  
Our love on the light  
  
You were right, and I was wrong  
I should have listened to the words  
You said  
But I was too headstrong  
  
So if you've heard this all before  
Don't let me carry on no more  
  
Stop me, stop me if you think you've  
Heard this one, this one  
Stop me, stop me if you think you've  
Heard this one  
Stop me, stop me if you think you've  
Heard this one, this one  
Stop me, stop me, stop me  
  
You said I lied, you said I cried  
But I had to say something fast in case  
You threw me aside  
  
I didn't know, I couldn't guess  
If I only would have known I never  
Would have been in this mess  
  
But if you've heard this all before  
Don't let me carry on no more  
  
Stop me, stop me if you think you've  
Heard this one, this one  
Stop me, stop me if you think you've  
Heard this one  
Stop me, stop me if you think you've  
Heard this one, this one  
Stop me, stop me, stop me  
  
But if you've heard this all before  
Don't let me carry on no more  
  
Stop me, stop me if you think you've  
Heard this one, this one  
Stop me, stop me if you think you've  
Heard this one  
Stop me, stop me if you think you've  
Heard this one, this one  
Stop me if you think you've  
Heard this one, this one  
Stop me if you think you've  
Heard this one, this one
