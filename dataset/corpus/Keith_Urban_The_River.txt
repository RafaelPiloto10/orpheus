I know a place where love flows like water  
You sit on the bank and pass the time away  
So take my hand I want to show you something  
My very own lover's hideaway  
  
[Chorus]  
And I will take you down the river  
Where we'll will be lovin' in the shade of the old willow tree  
I'll take you down to the river  
Where you and I can just be you and me  
  
I see us know just lyin' underneath the heavens  
Sippin' on wine with nothing much to do  
Just you in my arms when the sun is settin'  
Then makin' sweet love in the night of Mr Moon  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You know I"ll love you anyway  
All I will feel the same until the sun don't shine  
All I want to do is stay  
Cause you're a once in every lifetime oh  
  
[Chorus: x2]
