Traces, many faces  
Lost in the maze of time  
Blinded by the darkness  
That's the start of seven lives.  
It's so close, but still too far  
  
Follow your inner guide  
Show us who you are  
In these seven lives.  
Take it easy, take it easy, take it easy  
  
Follow your inner guide  
Show me who you are  
In these seven lives.  
It's too close, but still so far  
Show me who you are  
In these seven lives
