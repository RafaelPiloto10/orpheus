Once inside, everything would change before my eyes  
No more decay  
Glorious beauty had taken its place  
But in horror... I watched as the wolf... began its  
skin to shed  
I grabbed a silver crucifix expecting evil to be next  
To the floor it fell, the crucifix, the wolf was no  
more a beast  
Instead a lady only dreams can create  
Creeping deep into the heart I never had  
"I'll love you forever... never leave"  
It was love at first sight, in true love there is no  
wrong or right  
I didn't care from where she came, just her name...  
Angel  
Then a kiss, soft and warm, my love, am I really not  
alone?  
Nights of heavenly sin, in the House of God, I  
found... true love  
Nights of heavenly sin, in the House of God, I  
found... true love  
"Plenty of Food and wine, so we laughed and we dined"  
"We made love in the holiest of places, all the  
passion  
it made us crazy"  
"I'll love you forever... never leave"  
To the floor it fell, the crucifix, the wolf was no  
more a beast  
Instead a lady only dreams can create  
Creeping deep into the heart I never had  
I didn't care from where she came, just her name...  
Angel  
Then a kiss, soft and warm, my love, am I really not  
alone?  
Nights of heavenly sin, in the House of God, I  
found... true love  
Nights of heavenly sin, in the House of God, I  
found... true love  
Angel... Angel... Angel... Angel where are you now?
