Hey hey America  
You're some kind of crazy island  
You're a place where dreams can grow  
And there's history in your mansions  
Good fortune in your plantings  
You're well respected we all know  
Hey hey America  
Let's check your children  
And see what they might know  
  
Hey hey America  
With your salesmanship and your salaries  
And your strip malls a growing  
And your handguns and your heresies  
Don't hold no responsibility  
In this land of easy millions  
Hey hey America  
It's so thrilling to see you grow  
  
You're some kind of crazy island  
You're some kind of crazy island  
  
Well I prefer a sunny day  
I just thought maybe I'd live a little bit longer that way  
I don't think we should look the same  
Or talk the same  
Yeah I think it's a shame  
And hey hey America  
Across the new horizon  
Are you sure that's the way we should go  
'Cause I don't know  
Maybe it's too late for all that  
  
And hey hey America  
You're wrapped up in your red, white and blue  
Hey hey America  
Wrapped up in yourself and your red, white and blue  
Hey hey America  
You're some kind of crazy island  
  
You're some kind of crazy island  
Hey hey America  
You're some kind of crazy island  
You're a place where dreams can grow  
And there's history in your mansions  
Hey hey America  
You're some kind of crazy island  
Some kind of crazy island
