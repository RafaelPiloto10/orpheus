Fresh scrubbed baby, momma's kiss on his cheek  
Steps off the greyhound with money for a week.  
A wild eyed innoncent, he knows no fear  
It takes more than heroes to survive down there.  
In the badlands, the badlands, the badlands  
Well if you've got the bullets...  
They'll remember your name down there.  
Can't drink the water, can't breathe the air  
They said it was exciting, never said it was fair  
You're just another singer in a pilgrim's suit  
Chased by the lines till you learn to shoot  
In the badlands, the badlands, the badlands  
If you've got those black diamonds  
They'll remember your name down there.  
Badlands, well there's always a faster hand in the west  
Room around town for only the best  
One false step and you'll be cut down  
For some it's paradise, others it's hell.  
In the badlands, the badlands, the badlands  
Yeah, if you've got the bullet  
They'll remember your name down there.  
They'll remember your name down there.  
They'll remember your name down there.  
You're gonna need some protection.  
You had better make your connections.
