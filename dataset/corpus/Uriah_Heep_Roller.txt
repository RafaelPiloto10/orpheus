Oh where is she woman  
She's only here for the sun  
It's now you'll discover  
She's only here for the fun  
And who will move over  
Sweet talker choosin' her side  
And it's then, it's all over  
She' just along for the ride  
  
She' s a roller  
She's just a roller  
Bet she'll roll her life away  
  
One town is just like another  
One man will just never do  
Don't turn around  
When she calls out your name  
She's gonna break you in two  
  
But she's a roller  
She's just a roller  
Rolling time come today  
  
One town is just like another  
One man will just never, never do  
Don't turn around  
When she calls out your name  
She's gonna snap you in two
