Down by the bay  
Where the watermelons grow  
Back to my home  
I dare not go  
For if I do  
My mother will say  
"Did you ever see a bear  
Combing his hair? "  
Down by the bay.  
  
Down by the bay  
Where the watermelons grow  
Back to my home  
I dare not go  
For if I do  
My mother will say  
"Did you ever see a bee  
With a sunburned knee? "  
Down by the bay.  
  
Down by the bay  
Where the watermelons grow  
Back to my home  
I dare not go  
For if I do  
My mother will say  
"Did you ever see a moose  
Kissing a goose? "  
Down by the bay.  
  
Down by the bay  
Where the watermelons grow  
Back to my home  
I dare not go  
For if I do  
My mother will say  
"Did you ever see a whale  
With a polka dot tail? "  
Down by the bay.
