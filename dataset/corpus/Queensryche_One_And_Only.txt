Back in '86  
February and a special number  
I just had to know, is this feeling real?  
I picked up the phone  
I was one step closer to the danger zone  
I knew she'd steal my heart away  
But I know I couldn't live without her love  
The first time she looked at me  
Her smile stayed on my mind  
I never thought I'd ever meet  
A woman of her kind  
Now I'm lost in a lover's daze  
And I'm not walking out  
Gonna give my heart away  
And hope that she will always stay  
  
Call for me, run to me  
Whenever you are lonely  
Call for me, run to me my lady love  
  
Won't you come and show me that precious smile  
And maybe stay for a little while  
Close the door, Toss the key  
Say you will always be my one and only  
  
Looking back it seems to me  
The message in her eyes  
Left a lasting spell on me  
A feeling I can't hide  
  
Now I'm lost in a lover's daze  
And I'm not walking out  
Gonna give my heart away  
And hope she will always stay  
  
Call for me, run to me  
Whenever you are lonely  
Call for me, run to me my lady love  
  
Won't you come and show me that precious smile  
And maybe stay for a little while  
Treat me to your sense of taste and style  
Together we can walk the miles  
  
Close the door, toss the key  
Say that you will always be my one and only
