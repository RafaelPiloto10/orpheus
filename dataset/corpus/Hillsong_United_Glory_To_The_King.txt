Lord, my heart cries out glory to the King  
My greatest love in life, I hand You everything  
Glory, glory I hear the angels sing  
  
Open my ears, let me hear Your voice  
To know that sweet sound  
Oh my soul rejoice  
Glory, glory, I hear the angels sing  
  
Chorus:  
You're a Father to the fatherless  
The answer to my dreams  
I see you crowned in righteousness  
We cry glory to the King  
Comforter to the lonely  
The lifter of my head  
I see You veiled in majesty  
We cry glory, glory  
We cry glory to the King  
We cry glory glory  
We cry glory to the King
