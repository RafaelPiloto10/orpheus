Way down in Virginia  
Amongst the tall grown sugar canes  
Lived a simple man and a Dominique hen  
And a rose of a different name.  
  
Well, the first time I fell lightly  
I was standing in the drizzling rain  
With a trembling hand and a bottle of gin  
And a rose of a different name.  
  
Well, the devil made me do it the first time  
The second time I done it on my own  
Lord, put a handle on a simple handed man  
And help me leave that black rose alone.  
  
When the devil made that woman  
Lord, she threw the pattern away  
She was built for speed with the tools  
You need to make a new fool every day.  
  
Way down deep and dirty  
On the darker side of shame  
I caught a cane cuttin' man with a bottle of gin  
With a rose of a different name.  
  
The devil made me do it the first time  
The second time I done it on my own  
Lord, put a handle on a simple handed man  
And help me leave that black rose alone.  
  
The devil made me do it the first time  
The second time I done it on my own  
Lord, put a handle on a simple handed man  
And help me leave that black rose alone...
