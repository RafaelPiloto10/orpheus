Steal it, take it, know my name in loving memory  
Sand it, brand it, in your brain, a forthright eulogy  
I am but a sinner here, my faults are underlined  
I have but to hold you near to cleanse the sins of time  
  
I have known you, all too well  
I have shown you, all too well  
I have thrilled you, all too well  
I have filled you, with the sense of what you need to  
  
Speak up, calling my name out  
Speak up, the shattering of doubt  
This is where you start  
With nails run through your heart  
Leave the name, burned in the brain  
Leave your mark  
  
Find it, blind it with your light or curse to be alive  
Will it, kill it in your night, commit yourself to thrive  
You are but a sinner hear, each breath is now your crime  
You have but to shed a tear, to wash away the time  
  
I have known you, all too well  
I have shown you, all too well  
I have thrilled you, all too well  
I have filled you, with the sense of what you need to  
  
Speak up, calling my name out  
Speak up, the shattering of doubt  
This is where you start  
With nails run through your heart  
Leave the name, burned in the brain  
Leave your mark  
  
Give me your principles, values and hope  
Or I'll take them away  
Not so convincible if you can't cope  
Or rise to the day  
Worn out the morals that lit up the path  
Now gone to the dark  
Frayed are the laurels, igniting the wrath  
They left in the mark  
Wrap me in darkness, wrap me in light  
Wrap me in indestructible light  
  
Way down the road it's better, believe me  
Way down the road it's gone (god)  
Carry the load, it's harder, believe me  
Carry it to your dawn (a lightning rod)  
Way down the road it's better, believe me  
Way down the road it's gone (god)  
Carry the load, it's harder, believe me  
Carry it to your dawn (a lightning rod)
