The hardest thing I've ever done  
Is say goodbye to you.  
But even though I love you baby,  
I know you can't be true.  
I walked down that country road  
Out to the big highway  
I caught a ride on an eighteen-wheeler  
And I'm takin' it all the way.  
Takin' all these blues to the highway  
Tryin' to get her out of my mind.  
When I'm out on the open road  
With the wind in my face,  
I'll leave my heartache behind.  
Raindrops on my window,  
Teardrops from my eyes,  
I thought our love was sacred  
Now I know that's just a lie.  
So I pack my suitcase  
And head out that old front door.  
Better take a long last look now baby  
'cause I won't be back no more.  
Takin' all these blues to the highway  
Tryin' to get her out of my mind.  
When I'm out on the open road  
With the wind in my face  
I'll leave my heartache behind.
