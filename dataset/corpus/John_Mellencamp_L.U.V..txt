Guilty 'til proven innocent  
I'm thinking about the government  
Wondering where the money went  
Into outer space, I guess  
Lying CS's everywhere  
Pretty boys in their underwear.  
Statue of Liberty  
Who really cares  
About freedom.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Singin' about l-u-v baby, luv  
Singin' about l-u-v baby, luv  
  
Throw up, throw down  
Get yourself a better town  
All these towns look the same  
Self pity, number one recreation  
We're dying in the USA.  
Preacher man, he keeps  
Preachin'  
While he covets your wife  
I ain't sayin' what's good  
I ain't sayin' what's right.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Wait a minute, let me check my tan  
Am I the same color as Superman?  
Helter skelter in a foreign land  
Monkeys versus dogs,  
Lying under a big palm tree  
With cream and bananas all over me  
That's the way it's supposed to be  
Here in the Garden of Eden.  
  
[Chorus x 2]
