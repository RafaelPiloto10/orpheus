Peter Parker was pitiful  
Couldn't have been any shyer  
Mary Jane still wouldn't notice him  
Even if his hair was on fire  
  
But then one day he went to that science lab  
That mutated spider came down  
Oh, and now Peter crawls over everyone's walls  
And he's swingin' all over town  
  
La li la, li de da  
La la, li le la da dumb  
  
Sling us a web, you're the Spider-Man  
Sling us a web tonight  
'Cause we're all in the mood for a hero now  
And there's evil doers to fight  
  
Now Harry the rich kid's a friend of his  
Who horns in on Mary Jane  
But to his great surprise it seems she prefers guys  
Who can kiss upside down in the rain  
  
"With great power comes great responsibility"  
That's the catch phrase of old Uncle Ben  
If you missed it, don't worry, they'll say the line  
Again and again and again  
  
Oh, la la la, di de da  
La la, di di da da dom  
  
Now Norman's a billionare scientist  
Who never had time for his son  
But then something went screw and before you knew he  
Was trying to kill everyone  
  
And he's ridin' around on that glider thing  
And he's throwin' that weird pumpkin bomb  
Yes, he's wearin' that dumb Power Rangers mask  
But he's scarier without it on  
  
Sling us a web, you're the Spider-Man  
Sling us a web tonight  
'Cause you're brave and you're strong and so limber now  
But where'd you come up with those tights?  
  
It's a pretty sad day at the funeral  
Norman Osborn has bitten the dust  
And I heard Harry's said he wants Spider-Man dead  
Aw, but his buddy Pete he can trust  
  
Oh, and M.J. is all hot for Peter now  
Aw, but Peter, he just shuts her down  
Mary Jane, don't you cry, you can give it a try  
Again when the sequal comes 'round  
  
Oh, la la la, di de da  
La la, di di da da dumb  
  
Sling us a web, you're the Spider-Man  
Sling us a web tonight  
'Cause we all sure could use us a hero now  
And we think that you'll do all right
