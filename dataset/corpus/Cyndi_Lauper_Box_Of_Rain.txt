Look out of any window  
Any morning, any evening, any day  
Maybe the sun is shining  
Birds are winging or  
Rain is falling from a heavy sky -  
What do you want me to do,  
To do for you to see you through?  
This is all a dream we dreamed  
One afternoon long ago  
  
Walk out of any doorway  
Feel your way, feel your way  
Like the day before  
Maybe you'll find direction  
Around some corner  
Where it's been waiting to meet you -  
What do you want me to do,  
To watch for you while you're sleeping?  
Well please don't be surprised  
When you find me dreaming too  
  
Look into any eyes  
You find by you, you can see  
Clear through to another day  
I know it's been seen before  
Through other eyes on other days  
While going home --  
What do you want me to do,  
To do for you to see you through?  
It's all a dream we dreamed  
One afternoon long ago  
  
Walk into splintered sunlight  
Inch your way through dead dreams  
To another land  
Maybe you're tired and broken  
Your tongue is twisted  
With words half spoken  
And thoughts unclear  
What do you want me to do  
To do for you to see you through  
A a box of rain will ease the pain  
And love will see you through  
  
Just a box of rain -  
Wind and water -  
Believe it if you need it,  
If you don't just pass it on  
Sun and shower -  
Wind and rain -  
In and out the window  
Like a moth before a flame  
  
It's just a box of rain  
I don't know who put it there  
Believe it if you need it  
Or leave it if you dare  
But it's just a box of rain  
Or a ribbon for your hair  
Such a long long time to be gone  
And a short time to be there
