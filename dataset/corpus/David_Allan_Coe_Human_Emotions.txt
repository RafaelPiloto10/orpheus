By David Allan Coe  
LONESOME, CRYING HEARTACHES  
THAT'S HUMAN EMOTIONS  
I NEVER KNEW, LORD  
TILL SHE WENT AWAY  
BEGGING, PLEADING, FORGIVENESS  
THAT'S HUMAN EMOTIONS  
THREES NOTHING AS LONESOME  
AS HEARING HER SAY  
SHE DON'T MEAN TO HURT ME  
SHE JUST WANTS HER FREEDOM  
REVENGE AIN'T WORTH HAVING  
WHEN IT COMES SO SLOW  
VIE HURT HER TO MUCH NOW  
FOR HER TO GET EVEN  
EVEN IF LEAVING  
MEANS NO PLACE TO GO  
  
SHE PACKED UP HER SUITCASE  
ALONG WITH THE BABIES  
BUT SHE LEFT HER PAINTINGS  
THEY HANG ON THE WALL  
ITS HER WAY OF TELLING ME  
JUST WHAT ILL BE MISSING  
MISSING HERS SOMETHING  
I HATE MOST OF ALL
