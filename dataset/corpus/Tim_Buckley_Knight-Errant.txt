O whither has my lady wandered?  
I'll search until I know I've found her  
One green day she left her wings  
And cut away her childhood strings  
But dropping smiles along the trail  
She left a trace I will not fail  
O whither has my lady wandered?  
I'll search until I know I've found her  
When I catch my sudden maid  
I'll deck her out in lace and jade  
I will take her to her room  
I will take her to her room  
I love her upstairs, I love her downstairs  
But I love my lady's chamber  
O whither has my lady wandered?  
I'll search until I know I've found her
