In a dark and sweaty room in '69  
Tables turning  
Dancing girls, silly girls, all kinds of girls  
And it was loud  
Tuning up to madness in the back room  
Candles burning  
Present the Stinking Hippy and throw the  
Naked thunder to the crowd  
In the Hungry Daze  
  
The long and lonely highway drags along  
It's going nowhere  
Sickness and disease and mad  
Corruption  
Something's going wrong  
The mountain's getting cold and lonely  
The trees are bare  
We all came out to Montreux  
But that's another song  
You've heard it all before  
In hungry daze  
  
Along the Mountain Road to do some  
Drinking  
And now we're mobile again  
Different girls, laughing girls, forever  
Girls  
And it's so loud  
The crew have lost again  
They are beaten men  
The winning team united  
Living for the crowd  
These are the hungry daze
