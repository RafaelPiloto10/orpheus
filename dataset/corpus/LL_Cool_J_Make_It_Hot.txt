Aha, y'nahmean?

Real rugged like, uh, man  
Make me feel like I'm method out and all that, y'nahmean?  
Go diggin', uh check it  
  
I bring the butter, huh  
Make you wanna creep up on one another, huh  
I'm mad sharp like a box cutter, huh  
I got the fam' rollin' like brothers, huh  
We in the mecca, Moey, rollie glistenin'  
Raining on niggas so bad they think it's drizzlin'  
Ground zero funk track it's mega  
Doing wild damage to your arm, legga legga  
Who's that? The bawla, the player, the mister with the techniques  
Pumping blends, creeping up the backstreets  
Throw your rocks up high and let em gleam  
It's the Uncle what? Uncle L makes a wild scene  
And I be blowin' all the rookies out the frame  
And they be knowin' Uncle's flowin' in the game  
Queens to uptown I'm gettin' down for my crown  
When you see me comin' through just gimme a pound  
And say  
  
Yeah  
I'm bout to wet it up, get it up  
Take a track, drape it in jewels and set it up  
I'm so nasty with mines, I warm it up like raw liquor  
Dime pieces throw it at me like a free picker  
I'm open, I let the funk soak in  
I taste like an eighth, ya freeze and start chokin'  
Yeah son I'm all up in ya mix  
Ya callin' in your clique, I'm bawlin' wit'cha trick  
Golden rocks fallin' off my neck and wrists  
When I breeze by, you be groovin' in the midst  
Of my cycle, every move I make is vital  
Crucial, official, brothers sayin "L we miss you"  
Much love to all the shooby doobies and cliques  
While you're bawlin' in the coupe you know I had to get the six  
Get your swerve on boo, chill wit me  
Get me, I want the cream, baby hit me  
  
Now take it to the bridge

Somebody tell me the way I keep comin' up  
Funk runnin' up and mad spots is blowin' up  
It gets hot when I manifest melodies  
Beatin' niggas all in their heads, so what you tellin' me?  
Get your drink on, throw you mink on  
Let your head nod, stick it out, that's what I'm talkin' bout  
I got ya deep deep down inside my mixture  
Swervin' curbs, servin' as I fixed ya  
Formulated and combinated, the people congregated  
You frontin' for nothin', your crew is overrated  
And I'ma take it on down to the AM  
Keep the drama flowin' til the party cave in  
Uhh, I get you open, baby come and get a fix  
Yo, that's word to mother I be droppin' mad shit  
Let's organize, bounce together for real son  
Trick a little though, sip a little Moe, peace one  
  
(Keep it comin' baby) Keep it goin' baby  
(Keep it comin' baby) Keep it goin' baby  
(Keep it comin' baby) Keep it goin' baby
