Well don't you want to climb a mountain  
Yeah, don't you want to ride the river  
Drink from a magic fountain  
Give your woman all the love that you can give her  
Well don't you want to be an outlaw  
Don't you want to ride the range  
Don't you want to be an outlaw children  
Just like jesse, like jesse james  
  
Well now don't you want to swim the ocean  
Don't you want to climb the highest tree  
Drink some of momma's lovin' potion  
Get your woman till she just can't see  
Don't you want to be an outlaw  
Just a poor boy out on the skids  
Don't you want to be an outlaw children  
Just like billy, just like billy the kid  
  
Well now billy he was a bad boy, he won the wild west  
By the year of 21, as many notches on his gun  
But someone laid him to an early rest  
  
Don't you want to climb a mountain  
Don't you want to ride the river  
Drink from a magic fountain  
Give your woman all the love that you can give her  
Don't you want to be an outlaw  
Don't you want to ride the range  
Don't you want to be an outlaw children  
Just like jesse

Jesse he was a bad boy, he won the wild west  
As many notches on his gun as the years of 21  
But someone laid him to an early rest
