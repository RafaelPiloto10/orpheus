This  
Is our place  
In the free and open air  
Under starry skies  
By the endless sea  
In an endless chain  
We are locked together  
I became a star  
You were my creator  
Never have we been closer than tonight  
You and I when our shadows crossed the light  
Never have we walked  
Further wondrous ways  
And this is where we stand  
Here on the beach  
And I'm tolling my bell  
In the fog to let you know  
I'm here by your side  
In this madness called life  
Though the knights have all gone  
And we lowered our flags  
I sing you this song as the tides wash the sands  
On the beach  
Take my hand like I once took yours  
Look me in the eye like I once looked in yours  
Here we go again, speaking in strange codes  
Reading all the stars  
Like an open book  
On the beach
