I've known for a long time  
The kind of girl you are  
And a smile that covers teardrops  
The way your head yields to your heart  
Of things you've kept inside  
That most girls couldn't bear  
Well, I've known you for a long time  
But I've just begun to care  
Yes, I've known of all the heartaches  
And I've known of all the pain  
I've seen you when the the sun shines  
And I've seen you when it rains  
I've seen you make a look of love  
From just an icy stare  
Well, I've known you for a long time  
But I've just begun to care  
I know I've been blind  
To not have loved you all this time  
To not have loved you all this time  
But the image of you wasn't clear  
I guess I've been standing too near  
It's taken me a while  
But I have finally found  
What you are to me  
And that's what really counts  
And what you are to me  
Is something we can share  
Well, I've known you for a long time  
But I've just begun to care  
Yes, I've known you for a long time  
But I've just begun to care
