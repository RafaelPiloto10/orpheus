Crownless again shall be the queen  
Trophy on her grave still remains unseen  
A boat on the river confessing the sins  
The Riddler revealing the deep hidden things  
Crownless again shall be the king  
A gull covered in oil with a broken wing  
A hitcher on a road alone and lost  
Iron sharpens iron - a truth that once was  
Mine is the Earth and the sword in the stone  
Mine is the throne for the idol  
One fleeting moment and it is all gone  
Crownless again  
Will I fall?  
Roaming on razor-sharp castles  
Ruling all but myself  
(Now my night is laid to sleep)  
One fragrant rose worth ten times what I am  
A crippled begging a coin braver than I ever was  
Reflection from me, Devil dressed in white  
Chasten the being  
Become what I once was  
Mine is the Earth
