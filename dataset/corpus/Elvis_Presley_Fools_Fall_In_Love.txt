Fools fall in love in a hurry  
Fools give their hearts much too soon  
Just put in two bars of stardust  
Just hang out one silly moon  
Oh! They've got their love torches burning  
When they should be playing it cool  
I used to laugh but now I'm the same  
Take a look at a brand new fool  
  
Fools fall in love just like schoolgirls  
Blinded by rose colored dreams  
They build their castles on wishes  
With only rainbows for beams  
Oh! They're making plans for the future  
When they should be right back in school  
I used to laugh but now I'm the same  
Take a look at a brand new fool  
All right!  
  
They've got their love torches burning  
When they should be playing it cool  
I used to laugh but now I'm the same  
Take a look at a brand new fool  
Take a look at a brand new fool
