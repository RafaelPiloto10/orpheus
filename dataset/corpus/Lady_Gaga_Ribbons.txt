I'm not bad, I just sound that way  
  
All the girls they like their presents, like their presents  
When boys wrap them up in ribbons, ribbons, ribbons  
Doesn't matter if their precious or expensive  
If their well thought out, sexed up, wrapped right.  
Everytime, get in line, and give me mine.  
  
We like black, white, big, striped, poka-dotted, cafe-lotted.  
Ribbons come in many sizes, wrap em up in ribbons.  
  
Wrap them presents up in ribbons  
Wrap them presents up in ribbons  
Wrap them presents up in ribbons  
Wrap them presents up in ribbons  
Wrap them presents up in ribbons  
Wrap them presents up  
  
I'm not a allmark card expression, need material attention.  
Wrapped in ribbons, Richard Simmons, silly ribbons ribbons ribbons  
If you can't afford the best  
Don't be stressed, take a rest  
Get a job, do it right  
It's my birthday all night  
We like black, white, big, striped  
Famous super-sized ribbons  
Don't care what you put inside them  
Wrap it all in ribbons  
It's the lifestyle that I like  
I'll give you yours, you give me mine  
But don't forget to wrap 'em all in pretty pretty ribbons  
  
Wrap them presents up in ribbons  
Wrap them presents up in ribbons  
Wrap them presents up in ribbons  
Wrap them presents up in ribbons  
Wrap them presents up in ribbons  
Wrap them presents up  
  
Only difference between downtown and uptown  
Is therapy and valium, therapy and valium.  
Not lying when I say this, there's a price to being famous  
Yeah it's therapy and valium, therapy and valium  
  
(It's not complicated  
Just a fashion statement  
Everybody wrap it up  
Everybody wrap it up) 4x  
  
Wrap them presents up in ribbons  
Wrap them presents up in ribbons  
Wrap them presents up in ribbons  
Wrap them presents up in ribbons  
Wrap them presents up in ribbons  
Wrap them presents up
