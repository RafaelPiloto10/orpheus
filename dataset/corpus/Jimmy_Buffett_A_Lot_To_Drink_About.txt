Hey, have you noticed that the world has changed  
That the news is all bad  
Well, I think it's time for a song about that  
  
Up on the East side of Manhattan,  
They're still dancing with the stars.  
While over in sub prime city,  
It's getting ugly in the local bars  
Watching the news only gives me the blues  
There's too much going wrong.  
It takes the likes of me to hit the reboot key  
And write a high speed drinking song.  
  
Millionaires losing everything.  
Hey, welcome to the other side of life!  
There goes the yacht, there goes the Rolls,  
But you, you get to keep your wife!  
And don't forget the automakers  
Swimming up stream like a trout.  
They let the shit hit the fan  
And then they made a plan  
We've got a, a lot to drink about.  
  
There's the price of oil,  
The war of the spoils.  
Here's your bucket for the big bailout?  
Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan,  
We've got a, a lot to drink about.  
  
Now, Madoff made off with all the money.  
And his clients are down to skunk weed.  
Repeat after me, it's so easy to see  
We're only talking simple greed.  
And those Somalian pirates are counting all the gold.  
While Bush and Cheney ain't around  
And all the good lookers seem to be Russian hookers  
From Key West to London town.  
  
With the price of oil,  
The war of the spoils.  
Here's your bucket for the big bailout?  
Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan,  
We've got a, a lot to drink about.  
  
So pour me some Tennessee whiskey,  
Pour me a fine Jamaican rum.  
That loud mouth soup  
Can get ya kinda looped  
Tequila, of course I'll have some!  
  
Well the family devalues  
And little children plan their net worth  
And the truth wherever it's hiding,  
Can be found on Google Earth.  
Citibank's buying jets with our money.  
I wanna flog 'em with a buggy whip.  
Let's hope Obama and Joe won't let the volcano blow  
And patch the hole in our sinking ship.  
  
There's the price of oil,  
The war of the spoils.  
Here's your bucket for the big bailout?  
Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan,  
We've got a, a lot to drink about.  
  
Recession, opression, depression, good God  
CNN keeps bumming me out.  
I can't take another doomsday minute  
We got a lot to drink, a lot to think,  
A lot to drink about.  
  
God bless America!
