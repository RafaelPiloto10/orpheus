Goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye, my love  
  
I can't hide  
Can't hide  
Can't hide what has come  
I have to go, I have to go, I have to go  
And leave you alone  
  
But always know, always know, always know  
That I love you so  
I love you so  
I love you so, oh  
  
Goodbye, brown eyes  
Goodbye for now  
Goodbye, sunshine  
Take care of yourself  
  
I have to go, I have to go, I have to go  
And leave you alone  
But always know, always know, always know  
That I love you so,  
I love you so, oh  
I love you so, oh  
  
La lullaby  
Distract me with your eyes  
La lullaby  
la lullaby  
Help me sleep tonight  
  
La lullaby (la lullaby, la lullaby)  
I have to go  
I have to go  
I have to go  
And leave you alone  
  
But always know, always know, always know  
That I love you so  
I love you so  
(Goodbye)  
(Lullaby)  
  
I love you so  
(Goodbye)  
(Lullaby)  
I love you so  
(Goodbye)  
(Lullaby)  
  
I love you so  
(Goodbye)  
(Lullaby)  
I love you so  
I love you so  
I love you so  
  
Goodbye, brown eyes  
Goodbye my love
