The words are so familiar-  
All the same greats, the same mistakes  
It doesn't have to be like this.  
If you don't make a friend, now  
One might make you-  
So learn  
The gentle art of making enemies  
Don't look so surprised  
Happy birthday...Fucker  
Blow that candle out,  
We're gonnaa kick you  
[Don't say you're not because you are]  
[Don't say you're not because you are]  
[History tells us that you are]  
[History tells us that you are]  
All you need is just one more excuse  
You put up one hell of a fight  
I want to hear your very best excuse  
Never felt this much alive  
Your day has finally come  
So wear the hat and do the dance  
And let the suit keep wearing you.  
This year you'll sit and take it  
And you will like it  
It's the gentle art of making enemies  
I deserve a reward  
'cause I'm the best fuck that you ever had  
And if I tighten up my hole  
You may never see the light again  
[There's always an easy way out]  
[There's always an easy way out]  
[You need something wet in your mouth]  
[You need something wet in your mouth]  
Never felt this much alive
