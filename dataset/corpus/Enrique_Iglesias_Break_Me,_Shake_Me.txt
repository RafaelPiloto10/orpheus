Ow!  
Ha ha ha ha ah  
Anything you want,  
But never find the heart to leave me,  
'Cause I need you too much  
So play your game but don't desert me,  
Maybe you heard I'm tough  
To love but baby please believe me  
Don't be afraid to trust me,  
I wouldn't trade you for the world,  
And if you feel you gotta test me,  
Before you be my girl  
  
You can shake me, you can break me,  
But you can't make me,  
'Cause that the only this I won't,  
Do for you  
  
Sometimes I say too much  
I am right now so please forgive me  
But I can't help but touch  
The place I keep inside you in me  
I threw away my crutch,  
I'm man enough for you, can't you see me?  
  
Don't be afraid to try me,  
Come on and give a guy a whirl,  
And if you feel you gotta test me,  
Before you be my girl  
  
You can shake me,  
You can break me,  
But you can' t make me  
'Cause that's the only thing I won't,  
Do for you  
  
Well I was making love inside my mind,  
Somebody take me to the other side,  
I wanna kiss so deep inside your world,  
So don't run away girl  
  
You can shake me,  
You can break me,  
But you can' t make me,  
Cause that's the only thing I won't,  
Do for you  
  
You can shake me,  
You can break me,  
But you can' t make me,  
Cause that's the only thing I won't,  
Do for you  
  
I'm gonna make you mine  
  
I'd sail a thousand ships to finally kiss your lips
