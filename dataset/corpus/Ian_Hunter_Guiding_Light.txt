Lost in the middle of nowhere  
As cold as a stone in the sky  
Regretting the mistakes that I made  
When I was a young boy  
Looking for a guiding light  
Looking for a guiding light  
Looking for a guiding light  
Looking for a guiding light  
  
Lookin' for an answer that I ain't found yet  
A twinkle in a blind's man eye  
Lookin' for the light at the end of the tunnel  
Looking for a reason why  
  
You're my guiding light  
You're my guiding light  
Where's my guiding light  
Where's my guiding light  
  
I know you're out there  
I know you're out there  
I know you're out there  
Guiding Light  
  
Somewhere in the darkest night  
  
I swear on the cover of the King James Bible  
I'm never gonna let you go  
You're my idol, you're my survival  
I just want you to know  
  
You're my guiding light  
You're my guiding light  
You're my guiding light  
You're my guiding light  
  
I been searchin'  
I been searchin'  
I been searchin'  
One day I will find my guiding light  
  
And we'll shoot for the moon together  
We'll shoot for the moon together, babe  
We'll shoot for the moon together, babe  
We'll shoot for the moon together, babe
