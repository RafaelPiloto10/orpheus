I See you sleeping only in my mind  
I have been away alone this season  
I waste so much time  
Thinking of when I would hold you gently  
And I'd look into your eyes  
And I would be the one to calm your shaking  
When you would cry  
I miss you in my life  
I miss you in my life  
I miss you in my life  
So miss you in my life  
You hide your answers within every smile  
Time and time again I'd lose my chances  
To reconcile  
Even if I had my time over  
It would take a while  
To reveal all my best intentions  
That I let slip by  
I miss you in my life  
I miss you in my life  
I miss you in my life  
So miss you in my life
