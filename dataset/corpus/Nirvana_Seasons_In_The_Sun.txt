Goodbye my friend, it's hard to die  
When all the birds are singing in the sky  
And all the flowers are everywhere  
Pretty girls are everywhere  
"Think of me and I'll be there."  
  
Goodbye, papa, please pray for me  
I was the black sheep of the family  
"I don't know all these words  
I have bought three turds  
With my bb-gun I would kill birds"  
  
We had joy, we had fun,  
We had seasons in the sun  
But the hills that we climbed  
Were just seasons out of time  
  
All our lives, we had fun  
We had seasons in the sun  
But the hill that we reached  
Were just starfish on the beach  
  
Goodbye, michelle, my little one  
"I was the apple of the shiny sun.  
And I have loved you every week  
All my tears are salty  
I think now I will start to leave"  
  
We had joy, we had fun,  
We had seasons in the sun  
But the hills that we climbed  
Were just seasons out of time  
  
We had joy, we had fun,  
We had seasons in the sun  
But the hill on the beach  
Were just starfish on the beach.  
  
We had joy, we had fun,  
We had seasons in the sun  
But the hills that we climbed  
Were just seasons out of time  
  
I've had joy, we had fun,  
We had seasons in the sun  
But the stars that we reached  
Were just starfish on the beach.
