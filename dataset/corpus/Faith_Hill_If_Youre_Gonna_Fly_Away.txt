If you're gonna fly away  
don't fly without me  
don't go no where  
I need you, babe  
  
Has the sun gone down on you?  
Have you given up on truth?  
I wish I could say all the right things  
To make your pain go away  
  
I wish you knew  
How beautiful you are in every way  
When the world is falling down  
Just kneel with me and pray  
  
[Chorus]  
If your gonna fly away  
Don't fly without me  
Don't go nowhere  
I need you, Babe  
If you gonna leave this place  
Take me with you  
I could never live without you  
  
So you'll take a thousand pills  
Hoping to be numb  
Lie awake in bed  
Counting all that's wrong  
  
No one understands  
No one ever will  
Trust me when I tell you  
I know just how you feel  
  
You had all these dreams  
But you're in a small town  
Oh, they kill them for you  
You had nothing else to do  
But use and use and use and use  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just sing a song for me, baby  
It's not as bad as it seems, no no no  
What matters today  
Won't matter tomorrow  
Count all your blessing,  
Settle all your sorrow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you gonna leave this place  
Take me with you  
I could never live without you  
Oooo, I need ya
