It waits for the day I will let it out.  
To give it a reason, to give its might.  
  
I fear who I am becoming,  
I feel that I am losing the struggle within.  
I can no longer restrain it,  
my strength it is fading,  
I have to give in.  
  
[Chorus]  
It's the fear  
Fear of the dark  
It's growing inside of me,  
that one day will come to life.  
Have to save  
To save my beloved,  
there is no escape,  
because my faith is horror and doom.  
  
Hold down your head now,  
just let me pass by.  
Don't feed my fear,  
if you don't want it out.  
  
I fear who I am becoming,  
I feel that I am losing all beauty within.  
I can no longer restrain it,  
my strength is fading.  
I have to give in.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Long ago it came to me  
and ever since that day,  
infected with its rage  
but it ends today.  
  
[Chorus]
