Liza's had enough of men  
She says, she won't get burned again  
She says, they don't know how to fuck  
Her last boyfriend, the shmuck  
Shared with her a nice disease  
Kept her passive, on her knees  
'Til one day she took his car  
And drove it to the city  
  
Liza had put down a few  
When she met this girl named Lou  
Who convinced her to go home with her  
She said "My name's Louise  
Now will you take your clothes off please?  
I want to take you to the moon and back  
So get on your back."  
With a flick of the tongue  
She made her scream  
She made her laugh  
She made her dance  
She was happy for the first time  
And you know she wanted more  
  
Now with her legs spread wider  
She needed to have Louise inside her  
She said "I'll never forget the first time  
You kissed me, now I want you to fist me."  
Louise didn't need a second invitation  
She knew just what to do  
She knew just what to do  
  
Liza had cum a few times before  
But she had never even see the door  
Into the world of pleasures of the flesh  
She felt just like 16  
And her life before now was a dream  
Or even a nightmare that's over and done  
Just like warm healing rays  
Shining from the sun
