Standing at the stone  
Of one of our own  
He died saving my life  
He took the lead  
Aimed for my head  
Such love shown I'd never known  
  
Give me the gun  
I love you  
A job half done  
Isn't done  
  
Standing at the stone  
Of one of our own  
He took the plug  
And he hit the rug  
Such love shown I've never known  
Now I don't want to know tomorrow  
  
So, give me the gun  
I love you  
A job half done  
Isn't done  
  
Kneeling at the stone  
Of one of our own  
He took a round  
And he hit the ground  
He took the blast  
His very last  
I have no use for tomorrow  
  
No use for tomorrow  
No use for tomorrow  
No use for tomorrow  
No use for tomorrow  
No use for...  
No use for...  
No use for tomorrow  
No use for tomorrow  
No...
