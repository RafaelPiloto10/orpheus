[Chorus:]  
Hey You, you lost your only friend  
You can't believe you're broken heart will ever mend  
But every mountain has its faces that'd make you want to stop  
On this so unwelcome journey from the bottom to the top  
  
Move along  
I believe there's Something Beautiful to see  
Move along  
I believe there's Something Beautiful  
Just waiting for you and me  
  
I know you'll never count the tears you've cried  
Though you've asked a million questions  
No one could tell you why  
A single soul is chosen to be the one put to the test  
But there will be some consolation for a heart that never rests  
  
The years will make us older  
The winters make us colder  
And there's one more thing I've come to know for sure  
There's no bitterness that smolders, no chip on any shoulder  
That a random act of kindness couldn't cure  
  
[Chorus]
