[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]  
1017 Dreamteam  
Eating them percocetes like they was baked beans  
I just got out found out who got clean lean  
And gas weed and Miley C  
Peewee Longway with me that's my blood brother  
Two pints of P's on us so we mud brothers  
My life's a gangsta movie man I love colors  
I'm in a red bentley Brooklyn it's just me and Thugga  
They say I'm getting skinny but all of my blunts stuffed  
Ain't nuthin' skinny but them skinnies on my bentley truck  
This molly really got me thow'd up in a Mulsanne backseat  
Pow'd up two three's of the codeine  
And feel I'm bout to OD  
I'm in a rari but I'm runnin from the police  
A carbon 15 on me and an ounce of OG  
These niggas say they know Gu-wop but they don't know me  
Ten G's of molly on me so I brought sand to the beach  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm in a ghost same color dope  
Feel like I just came here on a banana boat  
Come to my store, knock on my door  
Soon as I get rid of them I got plenty more  
Like Curtis Blow I got to blow  
Like Bruce Leroy I got to gloat  
I do a show like I'm selling dope  
I rep for the hood it's a dope show  
  
[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]  
Me and big Gu-wop servin them bricks of du-wop  
Them drummers south bricks to d-block  
They bookin' those shows for re-rock  
Money four door so now I'm re-routin  
Looking at a real dope boy with cleeves out  
Lebron James shooter trekkin what the heat brought  
Real dope boy finnessing with the sheet rock  
Feeling like Wayne put it on mamacita  
Hit the block break it down serve James Ether  
Fuck a thought with drop with the egg beater  
Pull up in a drop top but I damn need her  
C-Note say we not done counting 20's  
Me and Wop in a Bentley flying down 20  
Pourin' mud so dark think we sippin' henny  
Got a bitch so bad call her dream of Jeannie  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3:]  
Dope show doing shows like I'm sellin' dope  
I'm counting 300, 000 now while she snorting coke  
She mix her coke with heroine then she call it speed ballin'  
I miss my cooking with OG I hear that weed callin'  
I'm on the phone slurring my words because the lean talking  
Sipping champagne shoppin' for jeans I'm in mini markets  
Trying on giuseppes with a niff and with a beam on it  
Smelling like I just smoked a half a pound of green homey  
The choos got me looking lean homey  
They say the robins looking mean homey  
But I ain't sticky cut some lean on it  
They say I'm picky bout' my weed homey  
These niggas trick u with the lean I put PT's on it  
These niggas killin' what they eat homey  
They'll treat you like a piece of meat homey  
So don't get butchered in the street homey  
I ain't had no work in like 2 weeks homey  
I gotta feed the streets plus Gu-wop gotta eat homey  
  
[Chorus]
