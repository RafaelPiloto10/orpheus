Cascades of gentle touch,  
Her passion blinding my eyes  
I'll find, I'll lose myself  
Drowning from her colorful sky  
I'm aware of her grace  
Those careless kisses  
  
Tattered on a sacred place  
She's a mystery  
(She's mine)  
Wonderin' if she loves me  
She's a mystery  
(So fine)  
She's a sweet confusion  
  
She's my zen, my home  
My only Shangri-La  
She's my French champagne  
She's my ooh la la  
  
Tattered on a sacred place  
She's a mystery  
(She's mine)  
Wonderin' if she loves me  
She's a mystery  
(So fine)  
She's a sweet confusion  
  
Like a gentle wind she moves  
Her fascination I desire  
She's a butterfly  
She's a Mona Lisa smile  
  
Tattered on a sacred place  
She's a mystery  
(She's mine)  
Wonderin' if she loves me  
She's a mystery  
(So fine)  
She's a sweet confusion  
  
I'd give her all the time  
If she's feeling so fine, yeah  
In and out of my life  
She's a mystery, yeah, yeah yeah
