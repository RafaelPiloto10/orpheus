It doesn't take a mathematician  
To add a simple sum  
Either you are simply beautiful  
Or I am simply dumb  
  
Dumb, dumb, dumb  
  
It doesn't take Robert The Bruce  
To see the web you've spun  
Either you are simply beautiful  
Or I am simply dumb  
  
Dumb, dumb, dumb  
  
It doesn't take a Labrador  
To show a blind man sun  
Either you are simply beautiful  
Or I am simply dumb  
  
Dumb, dumb, dumb  
  
The sun, the sky, the moon, the stars  
Jupiter, Neptune and Mars  
All these things I clearly see  
It don't take a telescope for you to love me  
  
Dumb, dumb, dumb
