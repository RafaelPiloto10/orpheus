No more trouble,  
In this town.  
Silent night, for a change.  
  
Brand new year,  
Coming up ahead.  
You know its been so long,  
Since I rang one in?  
  
I close my eyes,  
Think about the path I took.  
Just when I think these times,  
Have gotten the best of me.  
  
I can see my mother in the kitchen.  
My father on the floor,  
Watching television.  
It's a wonderful life.  
  
Cinnamon candles burning.  
Snowball fights outside.  
Smile below each nose and above each chin.  
  
Stomp my boots before I go back in.  
  
I wasted my wishes,  
On Saturday nights.  
Boy what I would give,  
For just one more.  
  
I soften my heart  
  
Shocked the world.  
Do you hear my voice?  
Do you know my name?  
Light my way,  
Lift my head.  
Light my way, I can see my mother in the kitchen.  
  
My father on the floor,  
Watching television.  
It's a wonderful life.  
  
Cinnamon candles burning.  
Snowball fights outside.  
Smile below each nose and above each chin.  
  
Family all together.  
Presents piled high.  
Frost on all the windows,  
What a wonderful night.  
  
Cinnamon candles burning.  
Snowball fights outside.  
Smile below each nose and above each chin.  
  
So happy they found me,  
Love was all around me.  
Stomp my boots before I go back in.
