Beauty sat bathing by a spring where fairest shades did hide her  
The winds blew calm the birds did sing the cool streams ran beside her  
My wanton thoughts enticed mine eye to see what was forbidden  
But better memory said "fie" so vain desire was chidden  
  
Hey nonny nonny oh hey nonny nonny  
Hey nonny nonny oh hey nonny nonnie  
Into a slumber then I fell when fond imagination  
Seemed to see but could not tell her feature or her fashion  
  
But even as babes in dreams do smile and sometimes fall a weeping  
So I awaked as wise this while as when I fell a-sleeping  
Hey nonny nonny oh hey nonny nonny  
Hey nonny nonny oh hey nonny nonnie  
  
Say man are you down for doing something positive in the community?  
No I don't think I'll ever do that again  
Well ain't you worried about doing the right thing?  
Well I don't care if I hey nonny nonny nonny ho nonny nonny nonny
