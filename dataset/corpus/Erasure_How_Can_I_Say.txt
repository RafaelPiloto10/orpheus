Down town  
I'm homeward bound  
The city lights are looking bright tonight  
  
No love  
Lost between us  
When I see you things are looking up  
  
Although it's cold, inside I'm warm  
Devoid of worries, no love is forlorn  
  
How can I say what must remain unspoken  
Don't want to spoil all that we said before  
So many crybaby hearts to be broken  
Don't want to join in with their crazy wars  
  
You tease  
I try to please  
Though I know i"m not looking my best tonight  
  
Hard pressed  
You've had the rest  
Of all the choices, time to make your mind up  
  
And though you smile, you're sad inside  
But do not worry, 'cause I'll make it right  
  
How can I say what must remain unspoken  
Don't want to spoil all that we said before  
So many crybaby hearts to be broken  
Don't want to join in with their crazy wars  
  
How can I say what must remain unspoken  
Don't want to spoil all that we said before  
So many crybaby hearts to be broken  
Don't want to join in with their crazy wars  
  
How can I say what must remain unspoken  
Don't want to spoil all that we said before  
So many crybaby hearts to be broken  
Don't want to join in with their crazy wars
