We're out of control  
And I wanna do is dance  
Yeah, we're out of control  
It's hard to say 'no'  
We don't want to go home  
Yeah we don't want to go home  
Now the party is over  
We don't want to get older  
We don't want to ever stop  
Now the party is over  
  
'Cause we are out of control  
Yeah, we're out of control  
The time is ours  
'Cause we are out of control  
Yeah, we're out of control  
  
We don't want to go home  
Yeah we don't want to go home  
Now the party is over  
We don't want to get older  
We don't want to ever stop  
Now the party is over
