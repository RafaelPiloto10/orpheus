Now that you find yourself losing your mind  
Are you here again  
Finding that what you once thought was real  
Is gone and changing  
  
Now that you made yourself love me  
Do you think I can change it in a day  
How can I place you above me  
Am I lying to you when I say  
That I believe in you  
O-oh, O-oh, O-oh I believe in you  
  
Coming to you at night I see my questions  
I feel wiped out  
Wishing that maybe in a year or two  
We can laugh and let it all out  
  
Now that you made yourself love me  
Do you think I can change it in a day  
How can I place you above me  
Am I lying to you when I say  
That I believe in you  
O-oh, O-oh, O-oh I believe in you  
O-oh, O-oh, O-oh I believe in you
