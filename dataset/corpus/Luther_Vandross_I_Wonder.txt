I stood in line at the corner store  
And I heard these guys talk about this girl  
Hey, who gives them love anytime they want ...huh  
Then they said your name and how you carry on  
Your chain of fools is so long  
I thought our love was still on  
And so, oh what a fool I've been  
I thought I was your man and oh  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wonder who's there loving you  
No one does you the way I do  
I wonder who ...who's there loving you  
And I really wonder who  
(It's been so long)  
Since you've called me, yeah  
(I thought our love was strong)  
Just the way a love should be  
(And now that you're gone)  
I sit here and I wonder  
  
Bridge I:  
I've seen so many guys  
Take one look into your eyes  
And think they're in paradise  
  
There was less than love in the things that woman said  
Now, I wonder who put ideas in her head  
I'm still in shock 'cause when I went back there again  
She'd changed her lock and said, sorry you can't come in  
What a fool I've been ...lookout  
I thought I was your man and oh ooh  
  
I wonder who's there loving you  
No one does you the way I do  
I wonder who ...who's there loving you  
And I really wonder who  
(It's been so long)  
Since you've called me, yeah  
(I thought our love was strong)  
Just the way a love should be  
(And now that you've gone)  
I sit here and wonder  
  
Bridge II:  
I've seen so many guys  
Take that look into your eyes  
And think they're in paradise  
  
Repeat [Chorus:]  
  
Fade  
  
I don't wanna be in love if you don't love me  
And I love you so, I betcha that you don't know  
And I wonder who ...  
I wonder, I wonder  
  
And I wonder who thatcha got loving you  
And I wonder why you're with some other guy  
And I wonder who ...  
I wonder, I wonder  
  
Don't wanna be a fool for no one, you see  
And I want you so, I bet you don't even know  
And I wonder who ...  
I wonder, I wonder
