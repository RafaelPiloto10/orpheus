I got a hundred dollars smokin' in my billfold  
I know I ought to save it, but it's burnin' a hole  
Right through my pocket and into my skin  
Come Monday morning I'll be broke again  
  
[Chorus]  
It's finally Friday  
I'm free again  
I got my motor running for a wild weekend  
It's finally Friday  
I'm out of control  
Forget the workin' blues  
And let the good times roll  
  
I got a little sugar baby down the road  
She's sittin' on a radio and rockin' on roll  
We'll dance up a storm, and later, all night  
We'll be workin' on doin' all the wrong things right  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Monday, I'll be hurtin' with my head in a vice  
Tuesday, I'll be wonderin' if I'll ever survive  
Wednesday and Thursday, I'll be slowly tunin' in  
Friday, I'll be revin' up my motor again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's finally Friday  
I got my motor running for a wild weekend  
It's finally Friday  
Forget the workin' blues  
And let the good times roll
