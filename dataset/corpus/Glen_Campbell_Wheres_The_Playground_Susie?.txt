The end has come and found us here  
With our toys scattered all around us here  
The puzzle that we never found an answer for  
Still asks us, darlin', just what all the games were for  
And here we stand in a box of sand  
Where's the playground Susie?  
  
You're the one who's supposed to know her way around  
Where's the playground Susie  
If I don't stay around?  
If I don't stay around?  
  
The carousel has stopped us here  
It twirled a time or two and then it dropped us here  
And still you're not content with something about me  
But what merry-go-round can you ride without me  
To take your hand ?  
How would you stand?  
  
Where's the playground Susie  
If I decide to let you go and play around?  
Where's the playground Susie  
If I don't stay around?  
If I don't stay around?  
  
Where's the playground Susie?  
You're the one who's supposed to know her way around  
Where's the playground Susie  
If I decide to let you go and play around?
