Keep your head to the sky  
Keep your head to the sky  
  
I look in your eyes  
I know your fight after your trouble, waiting in line  
Praying this time, life won't pass you by  
In the news, another one dies  
Tell me what do you do  
Negativity pulling me down  
I can't stay down,  
I wish I could make it go away  
Wish I could find the right words to say  
I'm calling you please  
Jesus I need to hear a word from you  
  
Gotta know that there's more to this life than what I can see  
Wanna feel how it feels to know real love and see me happy  
Have a faith that can say to a storm your temporary  
I want to be free, if you want to be free  
  
Keep your head to the sky  
Keeping my eyes on you, you got to come through  
Cause you promised  
Keep your head to the sky we only wait 'till you come,  
'Cause you're the one my heart's created for  
  
Keep your head to the sky  
Keeping my eyes on you, you got to come through  
Cause you promised  
Keep your head to the sky we only wait 'till you come,  
'Cause you're the one my heart's created for  
  
Keep your head to the sky  
Keep your head to the sky
