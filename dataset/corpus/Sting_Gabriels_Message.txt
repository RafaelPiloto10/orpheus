The angel Gabriel from heaven came  
His wings as drifted snow  
His eyes as flame  
"All hail" said he "thou lowly maiden Mary  
Most highly favored maid," Gloria  
  
"For known a blessed mother thou shalt be  
All generations laud and honor thee  
Thy Son shall be Emanuel  
By seers foretold  
Most highly favored maid," Gloria  
  
Then gentle Mary meekly bowed her head  
"To me be as it pleaseth God," she said,  
"My soul shall laud and magnify his holy name."  
Most highly favored maid Gloria  
  
Of her Emanuel, the Christ was born  
In Bethlehem all on a Christmas morn  
And everyone throughout the world forever saved  
Most highly favored maid Gloria
