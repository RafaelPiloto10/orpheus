Let your glory fly  
Let your glory fly  
Let your glory fly  
  
If my people will humbly pray  
Turn from sin and their wicked ways  
And I will hear them and heal their land  
And show my glory and power again, yeah  
  
Lift your eyes up  
Look to the sky  
The Lord is coming  
Coming to America  
  
Can you feel the fire?  
Can you see the wind?  
It's blowing through  
Coming to America again  
  
Go and tell them the blind will see  
The lame will walk and the slave is free  
Shout the news that the lost are saved  
In the name of Jesus, the dead are raised  
  
Lift your eyes up  
Look to the sky  
The Lord is coming  
Coming to America  
  
Can you feel the fire?  
Can you see the wind?  
It's blowing through  
Coming to America again  
  
Can you see it coming?  
  
Let your glory fly  
Let your glory fly  
Let your glory fly  
  
Lift your eyes up  
Look to the sky  
The Lord is coming  
Coming to America  
  
Can you feel the fire?  
Can you see the wind?  
It's blowing through  
Coming to America, yeah  
  
Lift your eyes up  
Look to the sky  
The Lord is coming  
Coming to America  
  
Can you feel the fire?  
Can you see the wind?  
It's blowing through  
It's coming to America again, yeah yeah  
  
Can you see it coming?  
Can you see it coming?  
Can you feel it coming?
