Your eyes are the eyes of a woman in love  
And oh how they give you away  
Why try to deny you're a woman in love  
When I know very well what I say  
I say no moon in the sky  
Ever lent such a glow  
Some flame deep within made them shine  
  
Those eyes are the eyes of a woman in love  
And may they gaze evermore into mine  
Crazily gaze evermore into mine  
  
Those eyes are the eyes of a woman in love  
And may they gaze evermore into mine  
Crazily gaze evermore into mine
