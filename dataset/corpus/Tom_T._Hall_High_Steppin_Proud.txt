I was a high steppin' proud man one time king of the sidewalk fed all the
girls a line  
You came along and love laid a heavy hand on me  
High steppin' proud man went down to his knees  
For a while I enjoyed just bein' under your thumb  
But after a while the nerve of love grew numb  
Then I knew my heart was changing cryin' out long and loud  
To once again become a man high steppin' proud  
High steppin' proud man down on my knees  
Beckon to your every wish and your every need  
Oh I know it won't be long before I break those vows  
And once again become a man high steppin' proud  
[ 12str guitar ]  
There's a lot of things in life I'm glad I didn't miss  
And your good good love rates mighty high on the list  
But my restless spirit and a weddin' band don't get along somehow  
Especially since I long to be high steppin' proud  
High steppin' proud man...
