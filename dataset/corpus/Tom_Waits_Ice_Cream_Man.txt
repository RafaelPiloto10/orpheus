I'll be clickin' by your house about two forty-five  
Sidewalk sundae strawberry surprise,  
I got a cherry popsicle right on time  
A big stick, mamma, that'll blow your mind  
  
Cause I'm the ice cream man, I'm a one-man band (yeah)  
I'm the ice cream man, honey, I'll be good to you.  
  
Baby, missed me in the alley, baby, don't you fret  
Come back around and don't forget,  
When you're tired and you're hungry and you want something cool,  
Got something better than a swimming pool  
  
Cause I'm the ice cream man, I'm a one-man band  
I'm the ice cream man, honey, I'll be good to you.  
Cause I'm the ice cream man, I'm a one-man band  
I'm the ice cream man, honey, I'll be good to you.  
  
See me coming, you ain't got no change  
Don't worry baby, it can be arranged:  
Show me you can smile, baby just for me  
Fix you with a drumstick, I'll do it for free  
  
Cause I'm the ice cream man, I'm a one-man band  
I'm the ice cream man, honey, I'll be good to you.  
Be good to you, be good to you,  
Good to you yeah, good to you yeah, good to you yeah, good to you yeah,  
Good to you yeah, good to you, I'll be good to you, I'll be good to you
