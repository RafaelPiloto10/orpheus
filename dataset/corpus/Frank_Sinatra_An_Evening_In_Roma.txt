Como e' bella ce' la luna brille e' strette  
Strette como e' tutta bella a passeggiare  
Sotto il cielo di Roma  
  
Down each avenue or via, street or strata  
You can seeem disappearing two by two  
On an evening in Roma  
Do they take 'em for espresso, yeah, I guess so  
On each lovers arm a girl I wish I knew  
On an evening in Roma  
  
Though there's grinning and mandolining in sunny Italy  
The beginning has just begun when the sun goes down  
So please meet me in the plaza near your casa  
I am only one and that's one too few, on an evening in Roma  
  
Don't know what the country's coming to  
But in Rome do as the Romans do  
Will you on an evening in Roma  
  
Como e' bella ce' la luna brille e' strette  
Strette como e' tutta bella a passeggiare  
Sotto il cielo di Roma  
Don't know what the country's coming to  
But in Rome do as the Romans do  
Will you on an evening in Roma  
Sotter celo de Roma, on an evening in Roma
