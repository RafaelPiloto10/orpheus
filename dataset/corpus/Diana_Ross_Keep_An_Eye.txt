Keep an eye.  
Keep an eye  
Keep an eye  
On your close friend  
  
Keep an eye  
Keep an eye  
Keep an eye  
On your close friend  
  
'Cause what you got, that'll make you lose  
And then turn around and step in your shoes  
I say they'll turn around  
And step in your shoes  
  
I stood there, numb  
Watchin' my friend walk away  
With my love on her arm  
  
Oh, what she said was  
"Sorry for what I had to do  
But you see I love him just as much as you."  
  
Keep an eye  
Keep an eye  
On your close friend  
  
Keep an eye  
Keep an eye  
You better watch out  
For your close friend  
  
The devil's workshop is a busy place  
On top of evil there's an innocent face  
Oh, on top of evil he puts an innocent face  
She was just like a spider  
Only twice as smart  
  
Kindness was a thread  
She used to weave my world apart  
There were three of us seen all over town  
Now there's only two  
Someone's missing  
Guess who?  
  
Now I see how she schemed  
And worked her way in between  
Planted seeds of mistrust  
To make us fight unaware  
Her comforting ways when I would cry  
Shadowed the look of triumph in her eye  
Just like a snake on the limb tree  
A friend is an enemy you can see  
  
'Cause what you got, that'll make you lose  
And then turn around and step in your shoes  
I said they'll turn around  
And step in your shoes  
  
So you better keep an eye on your close friend  
You better watch out for your close friend  
Don't trust nobody  
Don't trust nobody  
Keep an eye on your close friend  
Keep an eye  
Don't trust nobody  
Keep an eye on your close friend  
You better watch out for your close friend  
She was just like a spider  
Only twice as smart
