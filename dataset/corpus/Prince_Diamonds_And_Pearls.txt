This will be the day  
That you will hear me say  
That I will never run away  
  
I am here for you  
Love is meant for two  
Now tell me what you're gonna do  
  
If I gave you diamonds and pearls  
Would you be a happy boy or a girl  
If I could I would give you the world  
But all I can do is just offer you my love  
  
Which one of us is right  
If we always fight  
Why can't we just let love decide (Let love decide)  
  
Am I the weaker man  
Because I understand  
That love must be the master plan (Love is the master plan)  
  
If I gave you diamonds and pearls  
Would you be a happy boy or a girl  
If I could I would give you the world  
But all I can do is just offer you my love  
  
D to the I to the A to the M  
O to the N to the D to the pearls of love  
D to the I to the A to the M (To the M)  
O to the N to the D to the pearls of love  
  
There will come a time (There will come a time)  
When love will blow your mind (Blow your mind)  
And everything you'll look for you'll find (Take a look inside)  
  
That will be the time (That will be the time)  
That everything will shine (Forever)  
So bright it makes you colorblind (you will be color blind)  
  
If I gave you diamonds and pearls  
Would you be a happy boy or a girl  
If I could I would give you the world  
All I can do is just offer you my love  
  
If I gave you diamonds and pearls (Pearls)  
Would you be a happy boy or a girl (Yeah yeah)  
If I could I would give you the world (Give you the world)  
All I can do is just offer you my love (All I can do)  
  
If I gave you diamonds and pearls (Diamonds)  
Would you be, would you, would you  
(Would ya, would ya, would ya be happy little baby)  
A happy boy or a girl  
If I could I would give you the world
