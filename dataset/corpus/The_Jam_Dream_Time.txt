Streets I ran, this whole town  
Backstreet's and all, I wanted to leave there  
But no matter how fast I ran, my feet were glued  
I just couldn't move there  
  
I saw the hate and lots of people  
I heard my name called above the noise  
I tried to speak but my tongue was tied  
Bumped into emptiness and started to cry, oh no  
  
[Chorus:]  
I saw the lights and the pretty girls  
And I thought to myself what a pretty world  
But there's something else here that puts me off  
And I'm so scared dear, my love comes in frozen packs  
Bought in a supermarket  
  
Streets I ran, through wind and rain,  
Around this place amongst streaming sunshine.  
Scared I was, sweating now.  
Feeling of doom, my bowels turned to water  
  
I felt hot breath whisper in my ear  
I looked for somewhere to hide but every wheres closed  
I shut my eyes pretend not to be here  
This feelings much to real to ever disappear, oh no  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I'm so scared dear  
My love comes in frozen packs
