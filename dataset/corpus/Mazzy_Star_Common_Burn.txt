Simple things like  
Your overcoat and your beauty  
That's still burnin' me  
Let me hang around  
Even if it's just some way to have  
Some common burn  
A common burn  
  
So I spend the night in someone's house  
That you clouted  
Oh simple me that you fled  
But we have that in common  
  
That common burn  
That common burn  
  
Oh well, heavens, I have said so many times before  
You could sit around and have everything that you scored  
Just don't come home and say you've been asleep  
When you know you're burnin' someone  
  
That common burn  
That common burn
