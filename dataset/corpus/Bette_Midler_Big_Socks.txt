You talk about you and only you and the things that you do for you  
You say you're not a lean cuisine  
So I wanna see whatcha got on the menu  
Now if you think you're the man the only man  
With an exterior you feel issuperior Just give Miss be a little peek  
And see if you really can deliver  
Your tendencies are short, my expectations are long  
And as I see it now, there's not much to go on  
It seems you dug a hole that you can't crawl out  
Now I truly see what you're all about  
Chorus:  
Don't brag about the diamond rings  
Or the expensive clothes you wear  
'Cause I could care less for what you possess  
And your attitude needs repair  
Don't brag about your body baby  
And say that you're packin' a lot  
'Cause all I see besides your big feet  
Is that you got big socks  
Let's just say that there's something lacking  
A flea shouldn't have the nerve to be bragging  
So pack up your little gift and get up to steppin'  
Return it back and put it in the kiddie section  
Full figured in a place that can deliver?  
Ha ha not from what I've seen  
I can't trace what's below your waist  
There's too much space to be inside those jeans  
Chorus  
(Big socks, big socks  
I've got big socks, baby  
Big socks, big socks  
I've got big socks, baby  
Big socks, big socks  
I-I-I've got big socks, baby  
Big socks, big socks  
I-I-I-I-I)  
Bye bye baby bye bye  
It's time to wave the white flag  
Now the kitten has been let out of the bag  
Chorus  
Chorus
