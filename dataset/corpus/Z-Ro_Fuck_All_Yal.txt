[Z-Ro:]  
Ain't nobody, really got my back  
Motherfuckers just be hanging around me, because I rap  
It ain't no love involved, no motherfucking love at all  
If I had a price on my head, I bet my partnas would give up they dog  
Wish my mama was living, cause I'd be giving her my time  
Shit, I'd probably never would of started to rhyme  
My lifetime it ain't no sunshine, cause it be raining  
I be trying my best to smile, but I can't cause I be paining  
I'm paranoid all day, I keep my steel with me, bitch ass jackers  
Try to get me, so now my people be scared to come and chill with me  
Fuck y'all, I'm one deep till I D-I-E  
Displaying off some boxing game, when H-O-E's try me  
An S.U.C. Guerilla Maab veteran, constantly head busting  
Leaving em in need, of an exceteran, I'm going  
Do' knocking with a glock, paying a visit to some of my foes and friends  
Z-Ro Jones Jr., swelling em up around the nose and chin  
  
[Hook: x2]  
Fuck all of y'all, y'all done pissed a nigga off  
I'm a touch all of y'all, round each and every corner  
Someone follow y'all, they just trying to give you a present  
Something holla dog, and that's for all of y'all  
  
[Z-Ro:]  
I done made up my mind  
I hustle all alone, I'm trying to get a solo shine  
Everytime I turn around, someone bringing me down  
Got tired of em pulling on me, started slanging them rounds  
Now they thinking, I'm a crazy  
Scarred and stabbed and shot, I'm still a baby  
I want my mama, cause I'm having bad dreams and I die in em all  
Got me ain't friendly when you see me, ain't no smiling at all  
Live the thug life, heartless and hopeless  
Laying low ducking the law went North, to Lufkin and Nacogdoches  
I'm connected, my best friend use to be I-10  
Till my out of town connect, pulled out two techs and took my ends  
Got me throwed off in the mind, retaliation's what I taste  
His get blowed off with my nine, incarceration's what I face  
Feel me, I done lost my mind, but I'm not trying to find out where it went to  
It might be for the best, cause I'm not trying to remember the shit I been  
Thru  
  
[Hook x2]  
  
[D-Reck:]  
It's automatic gun fire, till they all expire  
Of course they said they loved me, but they all was lies  
Told me just give em a deal, now I tote a pill  
But when it was forth and ten, only a few was real  
Instead of making you an employee, nigga I made you a friend  
Now look what you lose, your Q's and handle fections stealing your ends  
I've been behind the scenes, but in front of the schemes  
Organized the team, for you to realize your dream  
That's how you pay me back, you funny fake fraud and flipper  
Over pennies and nickels, they turned sour like milk  
It's no wonder why, so many'll never see fortune and fame  
Fuck what you claim motherfucker, you never endue it no pain  
What you bumping for lil daddy, my address the same  
Ain't no pain without no gain, you got the heart to sustain  
Now I'm solo for the do'-low, ain't fucking with you no mo'  
For one thing you do, and I'll have you knocked off for the low-low  
  
[Hook x2]
