Down this road there's an old brick house  
My mama cried the day that I moved out  
And my first summer job was pumpin' gas and fixin' flats  
But at Henry Walker's Texaco  
Down this road, down this road  
  
Down this road there's a maple tree  
In a cotton field where Jenny first kissed me  
And I can still remember the night she said good-bye  
I stood there like a fool and watched her go  
Down this road, down this road  
  
And it goes on forever  
And it goes by too fast  
It'll take you anywhere you want to go  
And every memory will bring you back  
  
Down this road there's a small white church  
Daddy lived his life by the preacher's word  
He raised me right, I could always feel his love  
Even when the angels called him home  
Down this road  
  
And it goes on forever  
And it goes by too fast  
It'll take you anywhere you want to go  
And every memory will bring you back  
  
Down this road  
Down this road  
Down this road
