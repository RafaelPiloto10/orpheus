I been fightin' gravity since I was two.  
  
Questers of the prize  
Blind men in the snow.  
Some streak the skies  
I choose to go below.  
  
Skin moves towards malignant  
Worshiping the sun.  
They clamber over corpses  
To be the chosen ones.  
  
Drift along liquid sky.  
  
Descending through the darkness  
To the vast terrain.  
Down here on the bottom  
You rarely hear the rain.  
  
Drift along liquid sky.
