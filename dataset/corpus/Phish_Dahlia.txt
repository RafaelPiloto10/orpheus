Dahlia and I were taking a bath  
And Dahlia was smoking a cigar  
And she said to me  
"I bet you've never taken a bath  
With a girl smoking a cigar before"  
  
And she told me all about her car accident  
She was overdosed on Valium  
And she made an attempt to cross "the West Side Highway"  
  
Dahlia, I know I've done you wrong  
Dahlia, I know I've done you wrong  
Dahlia, I know I've done you wrong  
But Dahlia, you know you've done me wrong too  
  
She wore an old Camel t-shirt  
With some magic of it's own  
And we listened to the Stones  
Sucking Cherry Charms Blowpops  
  
Sucking Cherry Charms Blowpops
