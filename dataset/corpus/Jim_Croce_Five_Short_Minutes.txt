Well, she was standing by my dressing room after the show  
Asking for my autograph and asked if she could go  
Back to my motel room. But the rest is just a tragic tale  
Because five short minutes of lovin'  
Done brought me twenty long years in jail  
  
Well, like a fool in a hurry I took her to my room  
She casted me in plaster while I sang her a tune  
Then I said, "Ooh, ooee!" Sure was a tragic tale  
Because five short minutes of lovin'  
Done brought me twenty long years in jail  
  
Well, then a judge and a jury sat me in a room  
They say that robbin' the cradle is worse than robbin' the tomb  
Then I said "Ooh, ooee!" Sure was a tragic tale  
(Wasn't worth it, wasn't worth it!)  
Because five short minutes of lovin'  
Done brought me twenty long years in jail  
  
And when I get out of this prison gonna be forty-five  
I'll know I used to like to do it but I won't remember why  
(Wasn't worth it, wasn't worth it!)  
I'll say "Ooh, ooee! Sure was a tragic tale  
Because five short minutes of lovin'  
Done brought me twenty long years in jail  
  
Because five short minutes of lovin'  
Done brought me twenty long years in jail
