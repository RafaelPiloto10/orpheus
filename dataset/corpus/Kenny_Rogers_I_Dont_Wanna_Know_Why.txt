I don't wanna know why  
  
I took your love as desperate measure  
Seeking shelter from another lonely night  
You took my love seeking only pleasure  
But the feeling passes and the passion doesn't last.  
  
And I don't wanna know why, I don't want no reasons  
I just feel the seasons, as they touch another year.  
And I don't wanna know why, I don't want no reasons  
I just know what is now, and what could never be.  
  
Will the memories fade or will they linger?  
Will we live forever for a moment we can keep?  
Now we stand alone  
(why don't you do what you told me)  
Where we stood together  
(I only wanted you to hold me)  
How did we ever let this dream slip through our hand  
(how did we ever let this dream slip through our hand).  
  
And I don't wanna know ....
