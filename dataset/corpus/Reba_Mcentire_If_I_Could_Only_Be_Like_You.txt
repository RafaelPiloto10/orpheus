(Reba Mcentire with Susie Luchsinger)  
  
I know I haven't said the words the way I used to  
I should've made the time, I know  
When I didn't know which way to turn, I turned to you  
You always seemed to know which way to go  
You know you always seem to see the best in me  
You stand by me, no matter how things are  
If I haven't told you lately how I feel  
Let me tell you now, what's in my heart  
  
If I could only be like you  
You always seemed to see the good  
And then you make a dream come true  
And ask for nothing in return  
You always know just what to do  
You're someone I can look up to  
I'd be a better me  
If I could only be like you  
  
You know, you've always seen me through the worst of times  
You have a way of lighting up the dark  
And though we're sometimes far apart somehow across the miles  
I still know you're never very far  
You know you always seem to see the best in me  
And you stand by me no matter how things are  
If I haven't told you lately how I feel  
Let me tell you now, what's in my heart  
  
If I could only be like you  
You always seemed to see the good  
And then you make a dream come true  
And ask for nothing in return  
You always know just what to do  
You're someone I can look up to  
I'd be a better me  
If I could only be like you  
Like you - like you
