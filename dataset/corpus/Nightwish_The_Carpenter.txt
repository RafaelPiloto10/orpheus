Who are you?  
Man condemned to shine a salvation  
Throughout the centuries  
  
Why?  
Was the wine of the grail  
Too sour for man to drink  
  
The carpenter  
Carved his anchor  
On the dying souls of mankind  
On the tomb of this unknown soldier  
Lay the tools of the one who for us had died  
Tools of the carpenter  
  
The one they lick  
The same old sick  
Dream of their precious savior  
  
Kiss them deep  
And make them weep  
Over promises of eternal peace  
  
The carpenter  
Carved his anchor  
On the dying souls of mankind  
On the tomb of this unknown soldier  
Lay the tools of the one who for us had died  
Tools of the carpenter  
  
I hear you  
Through the symphonic voices of nature  
The purity I could never doubt  
They tell me to lie on the grass  
And observe my savior  
The one crucified to the chirping of birds  
  
The carpenter  
Carved his anchor  
On the dying souls of mankind  
On the tomb of this unknown soldier  
Lay the tools of the one who for us had died  
Tools of the carpenter
