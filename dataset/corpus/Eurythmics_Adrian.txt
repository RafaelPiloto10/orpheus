Adrian, don't you understand?  
Fools like us are always dreaming.  
And when you go to bed  
And cover up your head  
It's better if you try to stop remembering.  
  
And the world is slowly dawning  
To wake up to a new clear morning.  
Some of them just half your age  
Get written off, page by page  
  
Adrian don't you understand?  
Fools like us are always dreaming.  
And when you go to bed  
And cover up your head  
It's better if you try to stop remembering.  
  
Some of them just half your age  
Get written off page by page  
And the world is softly sleeping  
While your fears are in their keeping  
  
All the planet's making haste  
To blow to bits in outer space  
Adrian - don't you understand?
