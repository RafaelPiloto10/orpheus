Someday you'll [F] call my name and I won't [Bb] answer  
Someday you'll [F] reach for me I won't be [C7] there  
For you've grown [F] tired of all the love I [Bb] gave you  
But some-[F] day you'll [C7] wish that I still [F] care.  
  
[C7] All these years how I've [F] loved you  
Still I [G] know I claim you for my [C7] own  
Someday you'll [F] call my name and I won't [Bb] answer  
For some-[F] day you'll [C7] find yourself a-[F] lone.  
  
When you hair has turned from Gold to Silver  
And your eyes are dimmed by passing years  
You'll remember darling what I told you  
There'll be no one then to dry your tears.  
  
There'll come a time in your life dear  
When you'll need someone who will care  
Someday you'll call my name and I won't answer  
For someday you'll find that I'm not there.
