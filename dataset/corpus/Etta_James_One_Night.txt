Call me fool  
Send me away  
I've got to say  
It's you I adore  
  
Alone and in love  
Falling apart  
I followed my heart  
Straight Through your door  
  
Face to Face  
With all Honesty  
I would be greatful  
If you give to me  
  
One Night  
To lay in your arms  
One Night  
Could it be that I was wrong  
To make every dream  
You ever had come true  
Oh it's just, one night  
Just One Night  
  
Standing the close  
The sound of your voice  
Leaves me no choice  
I open my love  
  
Am I so wrong  
To think, to think you might fall  
And baby you're all  
You're all I'm thinking of  
  
Face to Face  
With all Honesty  
I would be greatful  
If you give to me  
  
One Night  
To lay in your arms  
One Night  
Could it be that I was wrong  
To make every dream  
You ever had come true  
Oh it's one night  
Just One Night

One Night  
To lay in your arms  
One Night  
One Night  
One Night
