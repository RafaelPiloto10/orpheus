See I got a little bit of a problem  
Back where I come from,  
Feels like five people in my population  
And no one ever leaves there  
I'm gonna be the first one  
  
I guess my papa always told me the way it was,  
And my mama think she knows me, I know she doesn't  
(Ah ah ah)  
  
But I got my head set on California  
I'll fly away tomorrow, won't even warn ya  
And I'll send a big postcard, just to piss you off  
I got my head set on California  
Here I come  
  
See, I got what you would call an obsession  
It feels like I think sane  
The limits of a small town  
Frustrating my brain,  
Might leave some roots there,  
But my head's on the next plane  
  
'Cause my daddy always told me the way it was,  
And my mama think she knows me, I know she doesn't  
(Ah ah ah)  
  
But I got my head set on California  
I'll fly away tomorrow, won't even warn ya  
And I'll send a big postcard, just to piss you off  
I got my head set on California  
Here I come  
  
Papa always tells me the way it was,  
And my mama think she knows me, I know she doesn't  
(Ah ah ah)  
  
But I got my head set on New York City  
I'll fly away tomorrow, won't even miss me  
And I'll get a big boyfriend, just to piss you off  
  
But I got my head set on California  
I'll fly away tomorrow, won't even warn ya  
And I'll send a big postcard, just to piss you off  
I got my head set on California  
  
Here I come, here I come
