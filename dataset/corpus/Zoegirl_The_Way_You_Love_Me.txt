I tried to find You but I didn't know Your name  
I searched for love, but I found only pain  
I chased the truth, but I only caught the lies  
When I searched for beauty  
  
Dirt got in my eyes  
And then Your love showed up  
And it erased my pain  
Lord, You gave it all just to clear my name  
  
Why You love me I cannot understand  
How You love me, can't even comprehend  
That You want me as broken as I am  
I can never repay  
  
The way You love me  
The closer that I get to You the smaller this world seems  
Deep inside my heart You placed eternity  
You gave me room to breathe, a place to get away  
  
Standing in Your presence with a debt I can't repay  
There's no high, there's no low  
There's no power or control  
Nothing's gonna keep me from You  
  
I love the way, the way You love me
