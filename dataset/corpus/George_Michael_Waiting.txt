Well there ain't no point in moving on  
Until you've got somewhere to go  
And the road that I have walked upon  
Well it filled my pockets  
And emptied out my soul  
  
All those insecurities  
That have held me down for so long  
I can't say I've found a cure for these  
But at least I know them  
So they're not so strong  
  
You look for your dreams in heaven  
But what the hell are you supposed to do  
When they come true?  
  
Well there's one year of my life in the songs  
And some of them are about you  
Now I know there's no way I can write those wrongs  
Believe me  
I would not lie you've hurt my pride  
And I guess there's a road without you  
  
But you once said  
There's a way back for every man  
So here I am  
Don't people change, here I am  
Is it too late to try again  
(return to top)
