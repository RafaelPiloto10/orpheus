Come and get it, hit it like a lightning strike  
Come and get it, wear it like an iron spike  
They ain't got your number and no, nobody's right  
Come and get it like you mean it, it'll be alright  
  
No more talking, no end result  
Subterranean Resistance Cult  
  
Now you got it, hold it, like it means your life  
Never going to let it go, grip it to the oh so tight  
And no one gives forgiveness, when nothing's going right  
Now you got it, shine it up yeah and take a bite  
  
No more talking 'bout where you've been  
Welcome home with a cup of sin  
No more talking to end result  
Subterranean Resistance Cult  
  
C'mon give me lower c'mon give me deep  
C'mon take me underground up here the talk is cheap  
Gone underground, sink it deep  
Sink it deep  
Gone underground, sink it deep  
Sink it deep  
C'mon give me lower, c'mon give me deep  
C'mon take me underground up here the talk is cheap
