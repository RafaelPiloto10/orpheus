Winter's weighin' on your shoulders  
It's hangin around a little too long  
And I can see it in your eyes  
You've taken on a load that's just too strong  
Oh, but let me get down to the heart of the matter  
Baby, if you want, I can make it better now  
  
[Chorus]  
When the sun is hard to find  
When it's rainin' in your eyes  
When the shadows block those pretty, little, blue skies living inside you  
When the fallin' of your tears makes a candle disappear  
When you just can't see the light  
Baby, I'll find a way to shine  
I'll find a way to shine  
  
Everybody's got a cross to carry  
Everybody's got a story they can tell  
Ya know you're not the only one counting on a quarter and wishin' well  
Whoa, don't you sit there with your heart under lock and key  
Gimmie one chance, baby, I can set you free  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sometimes in this life, good luck don't shine like it suppose to do  
When there's no one you can trust  
And they just keep on givin' up on you  
Baby, don't ya know that I won't ever let ya down  
Come on now, woo  
  
Oh, don't sit there with your heart under lock and key  
Just gimmie one chance, and, baby, I can set you free  
  
When the sun is hard to find  
When it's rainin' in your eyes  
When the shadows block those pretty, little, blue skies living inside you  
When the fallin' of your tears makes a candle disappear  
When you just can't see the light  
Baby, I'll find a way to shine  
I'll find a way to shine  
Find a way to shine  
Find a way to shine  
You know I'll find a way  
  
Find a way  
Find a way  
  
Find a way to shine
