You turn around  
Then you ask me behind tears of doubt  
Just what do I see in you  
Please don't cry  
I know sometimes it seems we barely get by  
But you don't see how much you do  
To get me through  
  
When the world is cold  
And I need a friend to hold  
You give me love  
You give me love  
And when my hope is gone  
And I feel I can't go on  
You pick me up  
You give me love  
You give me love  
  
I apologize  
If I never told you what you are in my eyes  
Oh baby, let me tell you now  
Every day  
Looks sweeter knowing you'll be there in every way  
Now how can you say that's not enough  
  
'Cause when the world is cold  
And I need a friend to hold  
You give me love  
You give me love  
And when my hope is gone  
And it feels I can't go on  
You pick me up  
You give me love  
  
You give me  
  
Everything my heart desires  
Morning sun and midnight fires  
Someone there to share my dreams  
With you I have everything  
  
When the world is cold  
And I need a friend to hold  
You give me love  
You give me love  
And when my hope is gone  
And I feel I can't go on  
You pick me up  
You give me love  
You give me love  
  
Yeah, when my world is cold  
And I need a friend to hold me  
You give me love  
You give me love  
And when my hope is gone  
And I feel I can't go on  
You pick me up  
You give me love
