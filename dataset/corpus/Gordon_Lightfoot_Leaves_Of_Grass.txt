The leaves of grass will not pass on  
Though the millstones grind them into dust  
For the earth shall give new life to them  
But only the grass will grow once more  
And the brave must fall to honor the names  
Of the ones who have gone before  
And the earth shall give new life to them  
But only the grass will grow once more  
If people could look into each other's eyes  
What a wonderful place this world would be  
All strife would end, we could start again  
And dreams like these must not pass on  
But the brave keep falling to honor the names  
Of the ones who have gone before  
And the earth shall give new life to them  
But only the grass will grow once more  
And the brave keep falling to honor the names  
Of the ones who have gone before  
And the earth shall give new life to them  
But only the grass will grow once more  
The leaves of grass will not pass on  
Though the millstones grind them into dust  
For the earth shall give new life to them  
But only the grass will grow once more
