I wanna hold the hand inside you  
I wanna take a breath that's true  
I look to you and I see nothing  
I look to you to see the truth  
  
You live your life, you go in shadows  
You'll come apart and you'll go blind  
Some kind of light into your darkness  
Colors your eyes with what's not there  
  
Fade into you  
Strange you never knew  
Fade into you  
I think it's strange you never knew  
  
A stranger's light comes on slowly  
A stranger's heart without a home  
You put your hands into your head  
And then smiles cover your heart
