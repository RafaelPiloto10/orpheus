Did you happen to catch  
Or did it happen so fast  
What you thought would always last  
Has passed you by  
Is everything speeding up  
Or am I slowing down  
Just spinning around  
And I don't know why  
All the pieces don't fit  
Thought I didn't give a shit  
I never wanted to be like you  
But for all I aspire  
I am really a liar  
And I'm running out of things I can do  
  
I'd like to stay  
But every day  
Everything pushes me further away  
If you could show  
Help me to know  
How it's supposed to be  
Where did it go?  
  
Pleading and  
Needing and  
Bleeding and  
Breeding and  
Feeding  
Exceeding  
Where is everybody?  
Trying and lying  
Defying denying  
Crying and dying  
Where is everybody?  
  
Well okay, enough,  
You've had your fun  
But come on there has to be someone  
That hasn't yet become  
So numb and succumb  
And god damn I am so tired of pretending  
Of wishing I was ending  
When all I'm really doing is trying to hide  
And keep it inside  
And fill it with lies  
Open my eyes?  
Maybe I wish I could try  
  
Pleading and needing  
And bleeding and breeding  
And feeding exceeding  
Where is everybody?  
Trying and lying  
Defying denying  
Crying and dying  
Where is everybody?
