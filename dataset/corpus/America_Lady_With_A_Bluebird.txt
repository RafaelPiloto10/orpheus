She came out of the blue and into my world  
She came out of the blue and into my world  
I went out of my head over you  
She was a lady with a bluebird sleepin' in her chair  
She was dreamin' 'bout a girlfriend and wishing she was there  
She was a lady with a bluebird  
Under the bridge I saw Mercury flow  
Between me and you and a fine tooth comb  
She came out of the blue and into my world  
She was a lady with a bluebird sleepin' in her chair  
She was dreamin' 'bout a girlfriend and wishing she was there  
She was a lady with a bluebird  
I close my eyes, I still see blue  
I hear her voice, I'll wait for you  
I still see blue  
She came out of the blue and into my world  
Oh, she came out of the blue and into my world  
She was a lady with a bluebird sleepin' in her chair  
She was dreamin' 'bout a girlfriend and wishing she was there  
She was a lady with a bluebird
