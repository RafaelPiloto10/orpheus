Well I heard you're havin' trouble in love  
Yeah, I know how that can be

Hey Darlin', you know that love is strange  
Seems the harder you try to hold on  
The further it moves away  
I know its hard to understand  
But that's okay I got a plan  
I know a place where you can find love  
The kind you always dreamed of  
  
Lets go down to the River-O-Love  
Let me show you how sweet it can be  
Down at the River-O-Love  
Let the cool, clear water wash over you and me  
in the River-O-Love  
Lets go down to the River-O-Love  
Let me drown in the River-O-Love  
The River-O-Love  
  
You don't have to be afraid  
'Coz I'll be right there by your side  
We can take it slow baby  
One long sweet ride  
  
Lets go down to the River-O-Love  
Let me show you how sweet it can be  
Down at the River-O-Love  
Let the cool, clear water wash over you and me  
in the River-O-Love  
Lets go down to the River-O-Love  
Let me drown in the River-O-Love  
The River-O-Love
