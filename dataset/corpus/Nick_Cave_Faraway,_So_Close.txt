Empty out your pockets, toss the lot upon the floor.  
All those treasures, my friend,  
You don't need them anymore.  
Your days are all through dying,  
They gave all their ghosts away,  
So kiss close all your wounds and call living life a day.  
For the planets gravitate around you,  
And the stars shower down around you,  
And the angels in heaven adore you,  
And the saints all stand and applaud you.  
So faraway,  
So faraway and yet so close.  
  
Say farewell to the passing of the years,  
Though all your sweet goodbyes will fall upon deaf ears.  
Kiss so softly the mouths of the ones you love,  
Beneath the September moon and the heavens above.  
And the world will turn without you,  
And history will soon forget about you,  
But the heavens they will reward you,  
And the saints will be there to escort you.  
So faraway,  
So faraway and yet so close.  
  
Do not grieve at the passing of mortality,  
For life's but a thing of terrible gravity.  
And the planets gravitate around you,  
And the stars shall dance about you,  
And the angels in heaven adore you,  
And the saints all stand and applaud you.  
So faraway,  
So faraway and yet so close.
