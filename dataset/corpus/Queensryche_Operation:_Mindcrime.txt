Cause I'll show you the cure

Yeah I'm gonna make you sure  
  
A hit man for the order  
When you couldn't go to school  
Had a skin job for a hair-do  
Yeah you looked pretty cool  
Had a habit doing mainline  
Watch the dragon burn  
No regrets, you've got no goals  
Nothing more to learn

Because we've got so much to do  
And you've got nothing more to lose  
So take this number and welcome to

Working overtime

The system boy, with nothing to sign  
  
Hey Nikki you know everything  
That there is to do  
Here's a gun take it home  
Wait by the phone

To bring you what you need

Make this city bleed
