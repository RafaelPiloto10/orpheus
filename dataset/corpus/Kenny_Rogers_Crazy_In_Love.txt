Ain't funny how time  
Steals the feeling from a love affair  
And there's no place to lay the blame  
'cos in any case, oh, no one cares  
Helplessly we just watched it fade away  
Neither will admit it  
Are we both aching to say.  
  
We, you, I miss the days when we were crazy in love  
When you were so sure of me, I had my little jealousy.  
We, you, bring back the days when we were crazy in love  
I wanna feel that way again, remember when we were crazy in love.  
  
I know it used to be so easy  
One touch and I was high  
And I could get intoxicated  
Just by looking in your eyes  
Oh, baby ain't there anything we can do  
Cos I know you're missing me  
As much as I've been missing you.  
  
We, you,  
  
Girl, we were more than best of friends  
We were crazy in love.
