Yeah I feel like a force of nature  
Could make you sing like a bird released  
If what you seek is the wise man's treasure  
You know it's buried beneath your feet  
You know you look like a painted picture  
I see the cracks freezing on your skin  
And as the world slowly turns and hits you  
That the thieves of the night  
Are coming to take you in  
  
For smoking all my stash  
But burning all my cash  
I bet you knew right away  
It's all over town that  
The sun's going down  
On the days of your easy life  
  
I bet you knew right away  
You dope you don't know where it's at  
It's all over town  
That the sun's gone down  
And it's high time to pray  
  
Yeah I feel like a force of nature  
Could make you sing like a bird released  
If what you seek is the wise man's treasure  
You know it's buried beneath your feet  
You know you look like a faded picture  
I see the cracks frozen on your skin  
As the world slowly turns and hits you  
Then the thieves of the night  
Are coming to take you in  
  
For smoking all my stash  
But burning all my cash  
I bet you knew right away  
It's all over town that  
The sun's going down  
On the days of your easy life  
  
I bet you knew right away  
You dope you don't know where it's at  
It's all over if you're begging me please  
Then yer get on your knees and pray  
  
Yer smoking all my stash  
Yer burning all my cash  
I bet you knew right away  
It's all over town that  
The sun's gone down  
And it's high time to pray
