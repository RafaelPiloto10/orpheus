I could never let you know what finally came over me  
I can't begin to describe how you made me feel  
I didn't believe it myself, I thought I was dreamin'  
Now we're back together and I'll never let you go  
I've been everywhere searchin' for the one  
But no matter what I do I run into you  
Told myself so many times I just won't do  
But something's tellin' me it might be you  
I wanna know  
Chorus:  
Is this feeling for real  
I wanna know you did to me, baby  
I wanna know  
Is this fellin' for real  
I wanna know what you did to me, baby  
I can remember the time my heart was badly broken  
Can you tell by looking at me, I've been hurt before  
Now my heart is beating so fast my body's trembling all over  
Now the world is shiny and new  
We're starting over again  
I've been everywhere searchin' for the one  
But no matter what I do, I run into you  
Told myself so many times it just won't do  
But something's telling me it might be you  
I wanna know  
(Repeat Chorus twice)  
I've been everywhere searchin' for the one  
But no matter what I do, I run into you  
Told myself so many times it just won't do  
But something's tellin' me it might be you  
I wanna know  
(Repeat Chorus to fade...)
