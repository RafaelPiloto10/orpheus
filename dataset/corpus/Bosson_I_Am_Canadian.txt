I know this place is where I am,  
No other place is better then.  
No matter where I go I am,  
Proud to be Canadian!  
  
I am, you know I am, I am Canadian!  
I am, you know I am, I am Canadian!  
Common!  
  
I love this country where I am,  
This land is where I make my stand.  
No other heart is truer then,  
The one we call Canadian!  
  
Sing it!  
  
I am, you know (you know I am), I am Canadian  
I am, you know I am (you know I am), I am Canadian.  
I am canadian!
