Love Lalalala Love  
  
When we're together why does something always start  
Are we both better off when we are apart  
Someday's you hate me I can see it in your eyes  
It seems like lately you can't wait to criticize me  
  
[Chorus]  
It's alright, we don't have to fight tonight  
No, it's alright (repeat)  
  
Everyday I can hear the rockets fly  
Over the graves of too many who have died  
Fighting for land, or some ancient holy shrine  
I bet your blood runs red, just the same as mine, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Bridge  
Love lalalala Love  
  
How many more of our children have to fall  
Just how high do we have to build these walls  
In fighting there's no dignity  
It's such a waste of time  
Take my hand,  
I don't think God will mind.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love
