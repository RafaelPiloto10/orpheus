[1st verse:]  
Every time  
I see a puppy upon a summer's day  
A puppy dog at play  
My heart is filled with envy  
That's because  
My heart is yearning to pass the time away  
Like that pup  
'Cause I'm all fed up  
And tho' it's wrong to be  
I long to be  
  
[chorus:]  
Lazy  
I want to be lazy  
I want to be out in the sun  
With no work to be done  
Under that awning  
They call the sky  
Stretching and yawning  
And let the world go drifting by  
I want to peep  
Through the deep  
Tangled wildwood  
Counting sheep  
'Til I sleep  
Like a child would  
With a great big valise full  
Of books to read where it's peaceful  
While I'm  
Killing time  
Being lazy  
  
[2nd verse:]  
Life is short  
And getting shorter with each day that goes by  
And how the time does fly  
Before you know, it's over  
That's why I'm  
In such a hurry to pack my things and fly  
To a spot  
Where it's nice and hot  
And hear the birdies sing  
While I'm being
