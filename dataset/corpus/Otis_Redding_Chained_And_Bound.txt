Darling now, you made me change my mind  
Can go no further, because you got me chained and bound, oh  
Taller than the tallest sky  
Sweeter than a grape on a vine, now  
Can go no further, because you got me chained and bound, right now, now  
  
So glad, I'm so glad, I'm so glad  
Oh, I don't have to worry no more  
Oh my my my  
Baby, somebody, somebody  
  
What kind of life is this kind I'm trying living  
Oh Lord, what kind of love is she trying to give me  
I feel like I'm standing up and telling the word  
I'm chained to your love  
  
Darling, oh  
Don't break this little heart of mine  
There's no greater love than this love of yours and mine, oh  
You walk with your head in the sky  
Darling don't ever pass me by  
I ain't going no further, because you got me chained and bound, oh now  
  
So glad, I'm so glad, I'm so glad  
Lord, I don't have to worry no more  
She got me chained to her love, now  
I don't, I don't want to be taken away, baby  
I'm chained, I'm chained and a little bound, now, now, now  
I'm chained, I'm chained to your love  
I don't, I don't know darling I want to to be taken away, now  
Oh, just a little bit of soul  
Just a little bit of soul, now.
