While the world keeps turning round and round  
While I feel I just can'T hear A sound  
I hear your name... I hear your name  
I try to go back to my usual day  
I try to slip back to my usual ways  
But its not the same  
I'M not the same  
Refrain I  
Don'T you know that love is the voice  
That whispers each time I try to hide it  
I'Ve lost all control, I'M helpless inside  
And you'Ll see it in my eyes, you know  
Chorus  
You'Ve taken over me,  
My baby now you'Ve taken over my heart  
You'Ve taken over me,  
My baby now you'Ve taken over my heart  
From the start...  
I'Ve never felt this way for anyone  
My security has come undone  
And I feel alive... I feel alive  
To A place I'Ve never been before  
When you came, you opened up the door  
And it feels so right, it feels so right...  
Refrain ii  
I did'Nt know that love would be here  
But now that you'Ve come, I just can'T fight it  
And now it'S so clear, with this feeling inside  
There'S no need to ask why... because  
(Repeat chorus)  
Bridge  
Whatever you want is my command, now that'S how I feel  
It'S like whatever you wish for, I will grant  
And the feeling is oh so real...  
(Adlib)  
(Repeat chorus till fade)
