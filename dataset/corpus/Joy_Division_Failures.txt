Don't speak of safe Messiahs,  
A failure of the modern man,  
To the center of all life's desires,  
As a whole not an also ran.  
Love in a hollow field,  
Break the image of your father's son,  
Drawn to an inner feel,  
He was thought of as the only one,  
He was thought of as the only one.  
  
He no longer denies,  
All the failures of the modern man.  
No, no, no, he can't pick sides,  
Sees the failures of the modern man.  
Wise words and sympathy,  
Tell the story of our history.  
New strength gives a real touch,  
Sense and reason make it all too much.  
With a strange fatality,  
Broke the spirits of a lesser man,  
Some other race can see,  
In his way he was the only one,  
In his way he was the only one.  
  
He no longer denies,  
All the failures of the modern man.  
No, no, no, he can't pick sides,  
Sees the failures of the modern man.  
Now that it's time to decide,  
In his time he was a total man,  
Taken from Caesar's side,  
Kept in silence just to prove who's wrong.  
He no longer denies,  
All the failures of the modern man.  
No, no, no, he can't pick sides,  
Sees the failures of the modern man,  
All the failures of the modern man.
