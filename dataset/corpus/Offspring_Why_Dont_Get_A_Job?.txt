My friend's got a girlfriend  
Man he hates that bitch  
He tells me every day  
He says "man I really gotta lose my chick  
In the worst kind of way"  
  
She sits on her ass  
He works his hands to the bone  
To give her money every payday  
But she wants more dinero just to stay at home  
Well my friend  
You gotta say  
  
I won't pay, I won't pay ya, no way  
Na-na, Why don't you get a job?  
Say no way, say no way ya, no way  
Na-na, why don't you get a job?  
  
I guess all his money, well it isn't enough  
To keep her bill collectors at bay  
I guess all his money, well it isn't enough  
Cause that girl's got expensive taste  
  
I won't pay, I won't pay ya, no way  
Na-na, Why don't you get a job?  
Say no way, say no way ya, no way  
Na-na, why don't you get a job?  
  
Well I guess it ain't easy doing nothing at all  
But hey man free rides just don't come along  
Every day  
  
Let me tell you about my other friend now  
  
My friend's got a boyfriend, man she hates that dick  
She tells me every day  
He wants more dinero just to stay at home  
Well my friend  
You gotta say  
  
I won't pay, I won't pay ya, no way  
Na-na, Why don't you get a job?  
Say no way, say no way ya, no way  
Na-na, why don't you get a job?  
  
I won't give you no money, I always pay  
Na-na, Why don't you get a job?  
Say no way, say no way ya, no way  
Na-na, Why don't you get a job?
