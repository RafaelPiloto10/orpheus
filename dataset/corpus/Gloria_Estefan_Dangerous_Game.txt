I know I let you in  
I let down my defenses momentarily  
At this moment of my life to be surprised  
With feelings I can never satisfy  
The words you wrote would free  
My carefully protected vulnerability  
Doesn't matter that both wear a disguise  
We can read the truth between the lines  
Dangerous game  
Who's spared when it's over tomorrow  
I'd be a fool to keep this alive  
When I know this can't go anywhere  
You know you let me in  
You lost your self control to curiosity  
Took the bait, I should have never lit the spark  
Answering your questions in the dark  
Dangerous game  
Who's spared when it's over tomorrow  
I'd be a fool to keep this alive  
When I know this can't go anywhere  
Who's the one to blame when things begin to fall apart  
Never mind I should have known much better than to even start  
How did you make it over all the walls I build so high  
Believing all you had to do was try  
Dangerous game  
Who's spared when it's over tomorrow  
I'd be a fool to keep this alive  
When I know this can't go anywhere
