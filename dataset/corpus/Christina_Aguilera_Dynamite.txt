Dancing til the morning on a velvet sky  
Racing to the top with golden rays of light  
I never felt so free and yet so dangerous  
The night was electronic painted red with lust  
  
I move, you chase, we magnetize  
A time I was exploding with no warning sign  
  
[Chorus]  
Dynamite  
Electrify me all night  
Dynamite  
Just give it to me, I won't bite  
Dynamite  
You make me feel, it's alright  
Dynamite  
Shine it on me  
  
Caught up in this moment I was hypnotized  
Shake this feeling got me paralyzed  
I do, I don't, I think I might  
My body was electric like a flashing light  
  
[Chorus]  
  
A change, a change is coming  
A change, a change is coming  
  
All around me that a change is bout to happen  
The energy igniting has become my inspiration  
If you take a deeper look you'll find the information  
I'm only just a figment of controlled imagination  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(o-o-uh, o-o-uh, o-o-uh) Electrify me  
(o-o-uh, o-o-uh, o-o-uh) I won't bite  
(o-o-uh, o-o-uh, o-o-uh) Just give it to me  
(o-o-uh, o-o-uh, o-o-uh o-uh o-uh)  
  
Dancing til the morning on a velvet sky  
(o-o-uh o-uh o-uh) Dancing til the morning on a velvet sky  
(o-o-uh o-uh o-uh) Dancing til the morning on a velvet sky  
(Yeah, give it to me)  
(Uh, oh)  
(Uh, oh)
