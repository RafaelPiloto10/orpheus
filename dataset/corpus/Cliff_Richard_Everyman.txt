Looking around nowhere to go  
Looking high but you're feelin' low  
Ready or not you got to run when you can  
Stealin' time just like everyman  
Oh oh want to let you know  
You can't hide you can't hide  
Oh-oh want to tell you so  
Well you tried I think you lied  
Everyman you get lonely  
Saw you cryingjust the other day  
Everyman it's not your money  
You and I get to feel this way  
We can feel the rain  
We're like everyman  
Spend your time spend your money too  
Spend your life if it gets you through  
Look around see you everywhere  
Stealin' love we'll it's just not fair  
Oh oh want to let you know  
You can't hide you can't hide  
Oh-oh want to tell you so  
Well you tried but I think you lied  
Everyman you get lonely  
Saw you crying just the other day  
Everyman it's not your money  
You and I get to feel this way  
We can feel the rain  
We're like everyman  
-solo-  
Everyman you get lonely  
Saw you crying just the other day  
Everyman it's not your money  
You and I get to feel this way  
We can feel the rain  
We're like everyman  
See you everywhere I go, looking high but you're feeling low  
Everyman everyman
