Your boyfriend, he  
Went down on one knee  
Well, could it be  
He's only got one knee?  
  
I tried to surprise you  
With Vodka  
Or Tizer  
I can't quite quite remember  
But you didn't thank me  
You didn't even thank me  
Because you never do  
  
Your boyfriend, he  
Has the gift of the gab  
Or, could it be  
The gift of the grab?  
I tried to surprise you  
I lay down beside you  
And...nothing much happened  
And you didn't phone me  
You didn't even phone me  
Because it's not your style  
To dial  
  
Your boyfriend, he  
Has displayed to me  
More than just a  
Real hint of cruelty  
I tried to surprise you  
I crept up behind you  
With a homeless chihuahua  
You "coo"-ed for an hour  
You handed him back and said :  
"You'll never guess - I'm bored now"
