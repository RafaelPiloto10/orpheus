I've told you that we're getting married,  
Now don't you try changing my mind.  
We've got a good thing together,  
Who cares if the world is unkind.  
I'm a man and you're a woman,  
That's all that matters to me.  
Baby the times are a'changing  
And I want the whole world to see.  
  
You're my ebony angel,  
Who cares what people say.  
My sweet ebony angel  
We're going a long long way.  
  
I want your love for a lifetime,  
I won't let you keep us apart.  
Don't give me those black and white reasons  
'cause I only see with my heart.  
I'm a man and you're a woman,  
That's what the world's all about.  
Baby the times are a'changing,  
Let me erase any doubt.  
  
You're my ebony angel,  
Who cares what people say.  
My sweet ebony angel  
We're going a long long way.  
  
Baby the times are a'changing,  
Let me erase any doubt.  
  
You're my ebony angel,  
Who cares what people say.  
My sweet ebony angel  
We're going a long long way.
