There is a house down in New Orleans  
They call the rising sun  
And it's been the ruin of many poor girl  
And me, oh God, I'm one.  
  
My mother was a tailor  
She sowed these new blue jeans  
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord  
Down in New Orleans.  
  
Now the only thing a gambler needs  
Is a suitcase and a trunk  
And the only time he's satisfied  
Is when he's on a drunk.  
  
He fills his glasses up to the brim  
And he'll pass the cards around  
And the only pleasure he gets out of life  
Is rambling from town to town.  
  
Oh tell my baby sister  
Not to do what I have done  
But shun that house in New Orleans  
They call the rising sun.  
  
Well it's one foot on the platform  
And the other foot on the train  
I'm going back to New Orleans  
To wear that ball and chain.  
  
I'm going back to New Orleans  
My race is almost run  
I'm going back to end my life  
Down in the rising sun.  
  
There is a house in New Orleans  
They call the rising sun  
It's been the ruin of many poor girl  
And me, oh God, I'm one.
