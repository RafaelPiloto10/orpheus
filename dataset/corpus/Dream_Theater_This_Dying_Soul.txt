Hello, Mirror  
so glad to see you my friend, it's been a while.  
Searching, Fearless  
where do I begin to heal this wound of self-denial?  
  
Face yourself man!  
Brace yourself and trace your hell back.  
  
You've been  
Blinded,  
Living lie a one way  
Cold existence,  
All the while.  
Now it's  
Time to  
Stare the problem right between  
The eyes  
You long lost child.  
  
I want to feel your body breaking,  
Want to feel your body breaking,  
And shaking,  
And left in the cold.  
I want to heal your conscience making  
A change to fix this dying soul.  
This Dying Soul.  
  
Born into this world a broken home  
Surrounded by love yet all alone  
Forced into a life that's split in two  
A mother and a father both pulling you  
Then you had to deal with loss and death  
Everybody thinking they know best  
Coping with this shit at such an age  
Can only fill a kid with pain and rage  
Family disease pumped through your blood  
Never had the chance you thought you could  
Running all the while with no escape  
Turning all that pain in to blame and hate  
Living on your own by twenty one  
Not a single care and having fun  
Consuming all the life in front of you  
Burning out the fuse and smoking the residue  
  
Possessive obsessions,  
Selfish childish games.  
Vengeful resentments,  
Passing all the blame.  
  
Living out a life of decadence  
Acing without thought of consequence  
Spreading all your lies from coast to coast  
While spitting on the ones that matter most  
Running power mad with no control  
Fighting for the credit they once stole  
No one can ever tell you what to do  
Ruling other's lives while the can't stand the thought of you  
  
A living reflection,  
Seen from miles away.  
A hopeless affliction,  
Having run astray.  
  
I want to feel your body breaking,  
Want to feel your body breaking,  
And shaking,  
And left in the cold.  
I want to heal your conscience making  
A change to fix this dying soul.  
This Dying Soul.  
  
Now that you can see  
All you have done,  
It's time to take that step  
Into the kingdom.  
All your sins will  
Only make you strong,  
And help you break right  
Through the prison wall.  
  
Come to me my friend  
(Listen to me)  
I'll help this torture end  
(Help to set me free)  
Let your ego go  
(I can't carry this load)  
You can't go through this alone  
(I feel so hopeless and exposed)  
You'll find your peace of mind  
(Give me some direction)  
You can no longer hide  
(Break out of this isolation)  
Let humility  
(Openness, honesty)  
And become what you can be  
(A healing tranquility)  
  
Help me,  
Save me,  
Heal me,  
I can't break out of this prison all alone.  
  
These tormenting ghosts of yesterday,  
Will vanish when exposed.  
You can't hold onto your secrets,  
They'll only send you back alone.  
  
Your fearless admissions  
Will help expel your destructive obsessions.  
With my help I know you can  
Be at one with God and man.  
  
Hear me,  
Believe me,  
Take me,  
I'm ready to break right through this prison wall.
