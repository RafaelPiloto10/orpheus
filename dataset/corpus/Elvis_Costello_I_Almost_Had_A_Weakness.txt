Thank you for the flowers  
I threw them on the fire  
And I burned the photographs that you had enclosed  
God they were ugly children  
So you're the little bastard of that brother of mine  
Trying to trick a poor old woman  
'Til I almost had a weakness  
  
Last week cousin Florence  
Bit your uncle Joe  
Hit him on the forehead with a knife and a fork  
(she) said that he looked like the devil  
Then she said..."pass the vinegar," I'm beginning to think  
(that) I'm the only one who hasn't taken to the drinking of it  
Though I almost had a weakness  
  
It pains me to mention  
These delicate concerns  
While I have to tolerate you family jewels  
I really mustn't grumble  
('cause) when I die the cats and dogs will jump up and down  
And you little swines will get nothing  
Though I almost had a weakness
