Space girls are as cold as ice  
They'll kiss you once and kiss you twice  
You'll shiver and shake and then turn blue  
Next you got the space girl blues  
I want your mechanism  
Give me your mechanism  
Space girls always smoke for taste  
Swallow butts and leave no waste  
Sado-maso is the rule  
You want them they don't want you  
Just to show that they don't care  
They'll bite your face and burn the hair  
The sun comes up the moon boo-hoos  
Next you got the spacegirl blues  
I need your mechanism  
Destroy your mechanism  
Destroy it!!
