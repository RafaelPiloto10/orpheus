It comes as no surprise  
Your face filled with lies  
Hovers all around me in this room  
Clouds hung with my dismay  
A hot bed where we lay  
Your every kiss tasting like a tomb  
If time becomes a judge  
If my body holds a grudge  
It's just because I needed sanctuary  
Your skin under my nails  
My curiosity that failed  
To save myself for something that I need  
I don't wanna bleed  
Or bruise up black and blue  
Do I deserve these things  
All for wanting you?  
Like some virgin with her cloth  
I play the goddess coming through  
Now I play the parting slave  
All for wanting you  
We do things 'cause we must  
The law of love and lust  
Comes together just like oil on flame  
I looked into your eyes  
You saw me naked for a while  
How d'you like it in my little nest?  
Who was really using who?  
In here the scent of you  
Stains the sheets with memory and lust  
When I get back on the street  
Tell everybody that I meet  
Maybe these aren't scars, they're only rust  
I don't wanna bleed  
Or bruise up black and blue  
Do I deserve these things  
All for wanting you?  
Like some virgin with her cloth  
I play the goddess coming through  
Now I play the parting slave  
All for wanting you
