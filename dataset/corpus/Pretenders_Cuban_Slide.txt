Remember the nights I cried  
You were doing that old Cuban slide  
All night I tried and tried  
I could not master the Cuban side.  
  
R'member the night I started to weep?  
Under lights you did the 'creep'.  
That night I could not sleep.  
Oh lord how goes the creep?  
  
[Chorus]  
AIy YI AIy Ya I wanna dance but my feet won't let me  
AIy YI YI AIy I wanna dance would someone help me  
AIy YI YI Ya- I wanna dance but my feet won't let me  
AIy AIy Ya  
  
Last night I could not talk  
On the street you did the Charring Cross walk  
Up and down I swoop and stalk.  
Only I can run, but I can't walk  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Remember the nights I cried  
You were doing that old Cuban slide  
All night I tried and tried  
I could not master the Cuban side.  
  
AIy YI AIy Ya I wanna dance but my feet won't let me  
AIy YI YI AIy I wanna dance would someone help me  
AIy YI YI Ya I wanna dance but my feet won't let me  
AIy AIy Ya-  
  
Now dance!
