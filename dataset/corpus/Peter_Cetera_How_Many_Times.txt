[Chorus]  
How many tears have you cried  
How many eyes have you dried  
How many ways have you tried  
And don't you get tired of people sayin'  
How many times, how many times  
  
How many dream have been bad  
How many nights have been sad  
How many days have you had  
When you get tired of people sayin'  
How many times, how many times  
How many times, how many times  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I said tired of people sayin'  
Don't you get tired of people sayin'  
How many times, how many times  
How many times, how many times  
How many times, times, times, times  
Times, times, times, times, times
