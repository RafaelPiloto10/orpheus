He's my guy  
I don't care what he does  
Cause he's my guy  
I guess he always was  
He careless about me  
I don't think he tries  
But once in a while  
he'll hug me and smile  
Then I can see me in his eyes  
  
Oh he's my guy  
I know he'll always be  
And I will try  
To keep him loving me  
However he wants me  
I'm his until I die  
For nobody knows better than I  
That he's my guy  
  
Oh he's my guy

However he wants me

For nobody knows better than I  
That he's my guy
