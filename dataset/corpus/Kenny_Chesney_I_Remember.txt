I'm sittin' here alone,  
Thoughts of you run wild.  
I'm longin' for your touch,  
Haunted by your smile.  
No use tryin' to erase,  
No one could ever take your place.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Well I remember how it used to feel,  
Back when our love was strong and real.  
And I remember tears in your eyes,  
As I looked at you and said goodbye.  
All I want right now is to forget,  
Every single thing that I regret,  
And drown out these embers...but I remember.  
  
It's yesterday again,  
Here inside my mind.  
And I can't find a way  
To leave your love behind.  
I want to wake up to the day  
Your memory won't stand in my way.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Well I want to wake up to the day  
Your memory won't stand in my way.  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
And I remember... ohhhhhh  
Oh I remember ya' baby...all of you my baby.
