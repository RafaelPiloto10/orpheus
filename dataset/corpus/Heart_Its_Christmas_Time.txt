It's Christmas Time  
Christmas is the time of year When miracles are done You can give your hand to
a friend in need A smile to a sad someone Your best friend knocks upon your
door And asks if you want to play You don't feel much like sharing your toys
But you share them anyway You make the time to take some time With dear and
special ones Christmas is the time of year When miracles are done Open up your
heart it's Christmas time Illuminate the dark it's Christmas time Shine a
little light into the world It's Christmas time Christmas is the time of year
when music's in the air Timeless and familiar songs You hear them everywhere
Even Ebenezer Scrooge sang on Christmas day Something's living in those songs
That all hearts long to say Open up your heart it's Christmas time Illuminate
the dark it's Christmas time Shine a little light into the world It's
Christmas time
