When you get to the bottom  
You go back to the top of the slide  
And you stop and you turn  
And you go for a ride  
Till you get to the bottom  
Then you see me again  
Do you, don't you want me to love you?  
I'm coming down fast, but I'm miles above you  
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer  
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
Do you, don't you want me to make you?  
Coming down fast I don't want me to break you  
Tell me , tell me, tell me the answer  
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
When you get to the bottom  
You go back to the top of the slide  
Where you stop and you turn  
And you go for a ride  
Till you get to the bottom  
And I see you again  
Do you, don't you want me to love you?  
Coming down fast I'm right above you  
Tell me , tell me, tell me the answer  
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter
