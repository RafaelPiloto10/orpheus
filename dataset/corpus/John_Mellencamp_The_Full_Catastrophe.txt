I've ridden down the sunset  
Drank expensive wine  
I've been married two dozen times  
Raised ten children on a workman's pay  
And I'm glad to say I've enjoyed every day  
Of the full catastrophe of life  
  
I've sat in courtrooms  
Had people call me names  
I've been to London town  
On a supersonic plane  
I was lovin' your wife  
While you were lovin' mine  
And I'm glad to say I've enjoyed every day  
Of the full catastrophe of life  
  
I've opened my belt to trouble everyday  
Ain't looking for a fight  
But you know I won't run away  
From the full catastrophe of life  
  
I've seen the goodness  
I've known the baddest around  
I was tattooed when it first came out  
I shook the hand that showed Moses the way  
And I'm glad to say I've enjoyed every day  
Of the full catastrophe of life
