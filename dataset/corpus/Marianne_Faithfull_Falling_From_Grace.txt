[Chorus]  
Falling from grace, falling from grace.  
Lord, you have a pretty face.  
Take it away and pack it in a suitcase.  
Then forget about falling from grace.  
  
Don't look at me like that, I never said a word.  
Don't ask me where I've been, I'll pretend I never heard.  
Don't put it in the paper, please, don't!  
I never said I will, I never said I won't.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's looking bad, I know, I'm an outlaw.  
Don't pity me, I never felt like this before.  
Please tell me you believe me, please say  
I'll get along without you, anyway.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Feeling hunted, I'm lying low.  
Don't tell me who it is, I never said so.  
Put yourself in my place, please try.  
I never told the truth, I never told a lie.  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
[Repeats]  
Falling from grace.  
Falling from grace, falling from grace.
