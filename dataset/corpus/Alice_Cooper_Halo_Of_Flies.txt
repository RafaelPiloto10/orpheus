I've got the answers  
To all of your questions  
If you've got the money  
To pay me in gold  
I will be living  
In old Monte Carlo  
And you will be reading  
The secrets of soul  
Daggers and contacts  
And bright shiny limos  
I've got a watch  
That turns into a lifeboat  
Glimmering nightgowns  
And poisonous cobras  
Silencer under the heel of my shoe  
The elegance of China  
They sent her to lie here on her back  
But as she deeply moves me  
She'd rather shoot me in my tracks  
And while a Middle Asian lady  
She really came as no surprise  
But I still did destroy her  
And I will smash  
Halo of flies  
I crossed the ocean  
Where no one could see  
And I put a time-bomb  
In your submarine  
Goodbye to old friends  
The secret's in hand  
With full ream of papers  
And fantastic plans  
You never will understand
