It's of a gentleman soldier  
As sentry he did stand  
He saluted a fair maiden  
By a waiving of his hand  
So then he boldly kissed her  
And he passed it off as a joke  
He drilled her up in the sentry box  
Wrapped up in a soldier's cloak  
  
And the drums are going a rap a tap tap  
And the fifes they loudly play  
Fare you well polly my dear  
I must be going away  
  
All night they tossed and tumbled  
'Till the daylight did appear  
The soldier rose, put on his clothes,  
Saying, fare you well my dear  
For the drums they are a beating  
And the fifes they so sweetly play  
If it weren't for that polly my dear  
With you I'd gladly stay  
  
And the drums are going a rap a tap tap  
And the fifes they loudly play  
Fare you well polly my dear  
I must be going away  
  
Now come you gentleman soldier,  
Won't you marry me?  
Oh no my dearest polly  
Such things can never be  
For I've a wife already  
Children i have three  
Two wives are allowed in the army  
But one's too many for me  
  
And the drums are going a rap a tap tap  
And the fifes they loudly play  
Fare you well polly my dear  
I must be going away  
  
If anyone comes a courting you,  
You can treat them to a glass  
If anyone comes a courting you,  
You can say you're a country lass  
You needn't ever tell them,  
Nor pass it off as a joke  
That you got drilled in a sentry box  
Wrapped up in a soldier's cloak  
  
And the drums are going a rap a tap tap  
And the fifes they loudly play  
Fare you well polly my dear  
I must be going away  
  
Oh it's come my gentleman soldier,  
Why didn't you tell me so? my parents will be angry  
When this they come to know when nine months had been and gone  
The poor girl she brought shame  
She had a little militia boy  
And she didn't know his name  
  
And the drums are going a rap a tap tap  
And the fifes they loudly play  
Fare you well polly my dear  
I must be going away
