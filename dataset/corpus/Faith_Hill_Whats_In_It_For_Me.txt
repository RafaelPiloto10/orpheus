Thought we had a good thing baby  
You pulled the wool over my eyes  
Should've seen it coming baby  
Now all I see is a cool love dying  
  
Honey I don't want to hold you down  
Why you gotta own the lock and the key  
Oh tell me baby  
Good things just don't come around  
  
And you can't have them for free  
No not me  
You've been a river of give  
And an ocean of take  
Darlin' for heaven's sake  
  
You've got me up and down and in between  
Acting nice then being real mean  
Hey  
Well you hold me tight then you turn your back  
  
Who could deal with that  
You say you want to work it out, boy  
Tell me what's in it for me  
  
You're living in your own world  
You act like I'm just passing through  
Oh yeah  
Don't you want to be happy  
  
Don't you know how good I could be  
Seems everybody's telling you something  
That they know you just want to hear  
Oh but you ain't gonna hear it from me  
  
You've been a valley of love  
And a mountain of need  
Baby, it's time you see  
  
You've got me up and down and in between  
Acting nice then being real mean  
Hey  
Well you hold me tight then you turn your back  
  
Who could deal with that  
You say you want to work it out, boy  
Tell me what's in it for me  
  
Up and down and in between  
Acting nice then being real mean  
Well you hold me tight then you turn your back  
Who could deal with that  
You say you want to work it out boy  
Tell me what's in it for me  
  
You've been a river of give and a mountain of take  
Darlin' for Heaven's sake  
  
You've got me up and down and in between  
Acting nice then being real mean  
Hey  
Well you hold me tight then you turn your back  
  
Who could deal with that  
You say you want to work it out, boy  
Tell me what's in it for me  
  
Up and down and in between  
Acting nice then being real mean  
Hey  
Well you hold me tight then you turn your back  
  
Who could deal with that  
You say you want to work it out boy  
Tell me what's in it for me  
Oh, in it for me  
  
What's in it for me  
What's in it for me
