Like a hog a rootin' up under a fence  
Like a flop-eared mule that ain't got no sense  
I've been a fool about you, for way too long  
I've been a fool about you, but now I'm gonna get gone  
  
We fight and we fuss like a dog and a cat  
I'll tell you right now I've had enough of that  
I've been a fool about you, for way too long  
I've been a fool about you, but I'm gonna get gone  
  
Well, I said I would leave if you didn't change  
Baby, it's time for me to rearrange  
I've been a fool about you, for way too long  
I've been a fool about you, but now I'm gonna get gone  
  
I'm gettin' sick and tired of the same ole bull  
I'll tell you right now, lord my bucket's 'bout full  
I've been a fool about you, for way too long  
I've been a fool about you, but now I'm gonna get gone
