Well my telephone was ringing and  
They told me it was Chairman Mao  
Well my telephone was ringing and  
They told me it was Chairman Mao  
You got to tell him anything 'cause  
I just don't want to talk to him now  
I have a apolitical blues and  
It's the meanest blues of all  
I have a apolitical blues and  
It's the meanest blues of all  
I don't care if you're John Wayne  
I just don't want to take no calls  
No calls
