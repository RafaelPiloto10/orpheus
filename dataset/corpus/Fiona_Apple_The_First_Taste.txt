I lie in an early bed  
Thinking late thoughts  
Waiting for the black to replace my blue  
I do not struggle in your web  
Because it was my aim to get caught  
But daddy longlegs  
I feel that I'm finally growing weary  
Of waiting to be consumed by you  
  
Give me the first taste  
Let it begin, heaven can not wait forever  
Darling just start the chase  
I'll let you win  
But you must make the endeavor  
  
Oh, your love give me a heart contusion  
Adagio breezes fill my skin with sudden red  
Your hungry flirt borders intrusion  
I'm building memories on things we have not said  
Full is not heavy as empty,  
Not nearly my love,  
Not nearly my love  
Not nearly  
  
Give me the first taste  
Let it begin, heaven cannot wait forever  
Darling just start the chase  
I'll let you win  
But you must make the endeavor
