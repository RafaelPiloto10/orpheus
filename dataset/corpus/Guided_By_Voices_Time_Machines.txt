Time machines escape the fall  
But cannot climb the prison wall  
Nowhere to go they stumble headlong  
Stumbling back to where they belong  
Are you looking at my signs?  
Have you noticed they're no timelines?  
Can you examine them sometimes?  
Can you?  
Time machines colliding  
Back and forth reuniting  
No real chance to run away  
No noble voices beckon them  
Have you looked at what I've found?  
In the ocean where my thoughts drown  
Can you walk on it sometimes?  
Can you?  
Time machines, we'll buy them  
I'll ride them with you  
In the dreams of every page  
And phases we go through  
Are you coming to meet with us?  
Will you be taking a seat with us  
At any time in the future or the past?  
Is there no one to care for you?  
With any crosses to bear for you?  
Or is the light always there for you fading fast
