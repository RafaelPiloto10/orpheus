[Verse 1]  
Down here Memphis no hanky panky  
And we ride whips on twanky twanky's  
Thugged out club scene dranky dranky  
That cristy cristy til' we faint'n faint'n  
Aaaaayyyyyyy!  
And they run to the dance floor  
All shape sizes from dime to zero  
I'm not Captain Kurt or Captain Nero  
I'm just trying to get you and your friend to G-O  
Then I dream voices hit my ski-lo  
T-shirt, head band, tech-marino  
Old school throw back Memphis sho-bo  
Lorenzo jersey to hide the 4-O  
Shawty, Cree-o and she know Judo  
She say she got some green that will send me to Pluto  
Sorry mommy ya boy don't smizzo  
But you can let your boy burn brain in the G-4  
[Chorus: repeat 2X]  
Aaaaaaayyyyyyyyy!  
Shake it mommy  
Girl tell me where you get that from  
Put it on me  
Alright (alright)  
[verse 2]  
I'm like me burning drink but me at the bar and uuhhh...  
Me from the hood but me is a star and uuhhh...  
You looking right and we can go far if uuhhh...  
Ya don't mind spending time with a hustlah  
Yo gotti, M down, Lil' Monster and  
You get it right how bout you be his wifey and  
We cock whips move bricks in a mini van  
Take trips to Hawaii to hula dance  
Aaaaayyyyyyy!  
She back in Philippines  
Aaaaayyyyyyy!  
Looking right in them Gucci jeans  
She bounce she turn she drop it low  
And I look like damn! This bitch is cold  
The monastery monora whatever hoe  
Look I'm from Memphis ain't seen that shit before  
Down here they twerk and shake it fast  
But we love it 'cause we watch her crip her ass  
[Chorus]
