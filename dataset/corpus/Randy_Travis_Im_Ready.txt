All our days are numbered  
Some live on borrowed time  
But life is what you make it  
Thank God I was so inclined  
To accept my Lord and Savior  
When the good news sunk in  
He paid a heavenly price  
By giving His life  
And I can't wait to go home to Him  
  
I'm ready to go that distance  
And God only knows when that might be  
But oh, what joy waits up yonder  
Once this old world sets me free  
  
When there's no tomorrow  
And glory has come down  
Those without Jesus  
Are lost and never to be found  
So please listen when I'm talking  
I'm just saying what needs to be said  
Make plans while your still living  
It's too late when your dead  
  
I'm ready to go that distance  
And God only knows when that might be  
But oh, what joy waits up yonder  
Once this old world sets me free  
  
Oh, once this old world sets me free
