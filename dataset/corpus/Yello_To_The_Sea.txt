Away  
Away  
  
You may have many problems  
But I was never one  
All I ask is take me to the sea  
  
You had to take me somewhere  
I realize it now  
Listen now just take me to the sea  
  
Away from flickering nights and crowded streets  
Away from blinding lights and shining needs  
Away from person hiding, breathing hard  
Away from always paying on your card  
  
This will be my way out  
And you will be my guide  
Don't argue, take me to the sea  
  
I'm only asking this once  
Please take me for a ride  
All I ask is take me to the sea  
  
To the sea  
To the sea  
To the sea  
To the sea  
  
Then leave me with the seagulls  
Smile your sweetest smile  
I'll kiss you like the salty northern breeze  
  
Drop silver on your forehead  
And wave my last goodbye  
All you do is take me to the sea  
  
To the sea  
To the sea  
To the sea  
To the sea
