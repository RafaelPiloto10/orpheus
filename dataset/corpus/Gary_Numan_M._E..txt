And m.e. I eat dust  
We're all so run down  
I'd call it my death  
But I'll only fade away  
And I hate to fade alone  
Now there's only m.e.  
  
We were so sure  
We were so wrong  
But there's no one left to see  
And there's no one left to die  
There's only m.e.  
  
Why shoud I care  
Why should I try  
Oh no, oh no  
I turned off the pain  
Like I turned off you all  
Now there's only m.e.
