Slow the years go by  
They stole your man off to war  
Will you see the child  
As you sing battle songs?  
  
And it pains me  
To think of the soldier's plight  
I will pray  
For your god to guide you home  
  
And she cries for the soldier's return  
Despair at feeling alone for so long  
By the light of the candle that burns  
For his life for the day of the soldier's return  
  
Hear the cannon fire  
Lost voices echo in the night  
See the spoils of war  
Young men are falling, ooh  
  
Hear the drummer  
Marching over the hill  
Love returning  
And the graves of the battle lie still  
  
And she cries for the soldier's return  
Despair at feeling alone for so long  
By the light of the candle that burns  
For his life for the day of the soldier's return  
  
Hear the drummer  
Marching over the hill  
Love returning  
And the graves of the battle lie still  
  
And she cries for the soldier's return  
Despair at feeling alone for so long  
By the light of the candle that burns  
For his life for the day of the soldier's return  
  
Young men are falling
