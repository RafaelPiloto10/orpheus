Now it's your type o mad Jinx the mad sucker with a tail. I've got my life
worked up it ain't as cheap as one thinks. I've got links on it, the same
internet porn, ain't as deep as I've been now I've got Justin in my corner.  
I creep up but they don't want me back in you know my love is so big I think
my head is cracking, smacking my face and always giving me the baseline, dead
in a days time, give back what's mine. This ain't no rhyme about a junky on
run another punk with a gun. Now when you get it, meet the mad fun. So get on
your feet and get in pack with the deal the beats on the wheel, now how do you
feel.  
The cool vibe from my lyrical solo I beat on your chest when I'm bouncing like
yoyo. This story is old just like the tales I've told. But mark my words it
will turn into gold.  
  
All right, we've got it right all right. We've got it right all right. We've
got it right all right.  
  
We dig around fanatics, tall and fallen manics and the planets breaking down
with god the only mechanic around, faking firm ground, fucking up the program
so now I'm working on my devious master plan. It's all about these crazy comic
relieves you know Wooster and Jeeves and modern prophets you never believe, we
get them all on a boat leave out all the rules, the white pigeons, and sail
the ship of fools.  
  
All right, we've got it right all right. We've got it right all right. We've
got it right all right. x3
