[Chorus]  
I want you to believe in us  
Trust in your heart - I'm very real  
I want you to believe in me  
In time you'll know you're all  
I need  
  
I see that you're hurting  
And don't believe my words are true  
But, well, I'm truly certain  
With all my heart  
I'll never hurt you  
  
Take time to realize  
The whos, the whats, the wheres, and why's  
Don't have to compromise  
The love we feel we can't deny  
Yes  
It took me by surprise  
No, it didn't take me long  
Can't be long  
Feeling strong  
I want you for the long haul  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I see that you're open  
And that you wanna feel much more  
Well, I'm truly certain  
That my love will open the door  
To feelings to love  
And happiness  
To a life filled with wonder  
Never second guess  
That I want you and I love you  
Never wanted more  
You the one that I need  
And the one that I adore  
  
[Chorus]
