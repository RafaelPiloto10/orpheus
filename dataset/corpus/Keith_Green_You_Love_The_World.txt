I want you here with Me  
But you've been keeping other company  
You can't sit still, it's plain to see  
You love the world and you're avoiding Me  
  
You love the world, avoiding Me  
  
My Word sits there upon your desk  
But you love your books and magazines the best  
You prefer the light of your TV  
You love the world and you're avoiding Me  
  
You used to pray, you were so brave  
Now you can't keep even one appointment we've made  
Oh, I gave My blood, to save your life  
Tell Me, tell Me is it right? Tell Me  
Will you leave Me here alone again tonight?  
  
Well, I love you, still more and more  
But you're fighting everything I'm working for  
You're acting like My enemy  
You love the world and you're avoiding Me  
  
You love the world, you know you love the world  
You love the world, avoiding Me  
  
These other loves, they're hurting you  
If you end up losing Me, then what will you do?  
Oh, I gave My blood, to save your life  
Tell Me, tell Me is it right? Tell Me  
Will you leave Me here alone again tonight?  
  
Well, I want you here with Me  
But you've been keeping other company  
And you prefer the light of your TV  
You love the world and you're avoiding Me  
  
You love the world, you love the world  
You love the world and you're avoiding Me  
You love the world  
You love the world, you're avoiding Me
