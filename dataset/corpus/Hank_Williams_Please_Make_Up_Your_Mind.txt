When I agree with you baby it makes you mad  
And when I don't, it makes you sad  
When I argue back you pack and leave  
And when I don't you pout in grieve  
There just ain't nobody knows what I go through  
Will you please make up your mind, what you want me to do?  
You say get out and I'd better stay gone  
Then you have a big policeman drag me back home  
You holler good and loud put him in the calaboose  
Then you cry and ask the judge, ?Won't you please turn him loose??  
The good Lord only knows what I go through  
Will you please make up your mind, what you want me to do?  
My life with you baby has been one hard knock  
Lord, my head looks like an old chop block  
And I'll tell you right now honey that ain't all  
You done kicked me till I feel like a used football  
There just ain't nobody knows what I go through  
Will you please make up your mind, what you want me to do?  
You knock me down and then you pick me up  
Honey do you have to love so doggone rough  
I wish to my soul you'd slow down the pace  
'Cause I tell you right now the hide's gettin' scarce  
There just ain't nobody knows what I go through  
Will you please make up your mind, what you want me to do?  
Why when I married you, you were such a meek little thing  
But honey among tigers, you'd be queen  
If a poor little rabbit had you on his side  
Every hound in the country would crawl off and hide  
There just ain't nobody knows what I go through  
Will you please make up your mind?  
What in the confounded cat hair, you want me to do?
