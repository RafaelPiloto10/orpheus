I hear more than I like to...  
So I boil my head in a sense of humor...  
I laugh at what I cannot change...  
I throw it all on the pyre again...go then and do this  
I'd do it for you...  
When all that I want is so badly to be...  
By myself again...  
It's going to drive me right out of my brain  
  
Drive in drive out I'm leaving  
Drive in drive out  
I'll come back again  
Drive in drive out I'm leaving  
Drive in drive out  
  
I don't care if we all turn to waste...  
So when I beg...you avoid me...because I smell of dirt...hungry,  
Hungry boy...you won't leave me all alone...the boy won't go  
  
Sooner or later we're done  
Sooner or later I'm gone  
Because, because  
Sooner or later we're gone  
Sooner away  
  
Ooh, my head is pounding now...god has all but left me behind...  
Not a sense of worry...I'm going to drive in and drive out again  
Drive in drive out I'm leaving  
Drive in drive out I'll come  
Drive in drive out I'm leaving  
Drive in drive out  
  
I'm over this arrangement...  
Around here...emptiness  
Sounded so good...I want to  
Drive you right into my world  
  
Drive in drive out I'm leaving  
Drive in drive out I'll come  
Drive in drive out I'm leaving  
Drive in drive out
