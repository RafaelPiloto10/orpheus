At the end of my life, when it's time to depart  
Will the last face I see be yours  
When I take my last breath, and I drift through the dark  
Will I look 'round and still feel secure  
  
(It's) no sacrifice to stay by your side  
Till hell freezes clear to the core  
Whatever the price, no matter how high  
Over your shoulder,  
When you turn around I'll be tellin' you  
  
No love will ever be stronger  
No love anywhere  
No love will ever last longer  
If I can't have your love, I don't want no love at all  
  
I'll put my change on the dresser... next to your scarf  
Cook my heart in the skillet next to yours  
Ten thousand tears lead up to now  
You are the treasure for sure  
  
Lines on my face get deeper each day  
But the feelings are ageless and smooth  
One single trace of doubt still remains  
Over my shoulder, when I turn around,  
Will you be tellin' me  
  
No love will ever be stronger  
No love anywhere  
No love will ever last longer  
If I can't have your love, I don't want no love at all
