(Earl King)  
  
Do re me fa so la ti  
This little creature was a-passing me  
He got a whole lot of rhythm when he walks  
And I can hear music, baby, when he talks  
Do re mi fa so la ti  
Forget about the dough and think about me, oh yeah  
  
Do re mi fa so la ti  
I wonder who can this creature be?  
He ain't no picture as I can see  
But I don't care he looks so good to me  
Do re mi fa so la ti  
Forget about the dough and think about me  
  
Do re mi fa so la ti  
I'd like to love you, yeah, yes sir'ree  
It may sound crazy but it's a fact  
Hey tell me, baby, baby  
How you gonna act?  
  
Do re mi fa so la ti  
Forget about the dough and think about me  
Oh yeah  
  
Do re mi fa so la ti  
Let's get together and make whoopee  
A b c d e f g  
Cupid's shootin' arrows straight by me  
  
Do re mi fa so la ti  
Forget about the dough and think about me  
A b c d e f g  
The cat's in the cupboard and you can't catch me  
A b c d e f g  
Forget about the dough and think about me  
A b c d e f g  
Cupid's shootin' arrows straight by me  
Oh, yes
