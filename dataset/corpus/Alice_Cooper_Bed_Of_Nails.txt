Yeah!!!  
  
Yeah we're gonna fight  
We do it every night  
Baby when you scratch  
You know I'm gonna bite  
  
You can make me die  
I can make you cry  
Opposites attract  
That's the reason why  
  
[Chorus]  
No one else could make you feel like I do, I do, I do  
No one ever gets as deep inside you, as I do baby  
Our love is a bed of nails  
Love hurts good on a bed of nails  
I'll lay you down and when all else fails  
I'll drive you like a hammer on a bed of nails.  
  
First we're gonna kiss  
Then we're gonna say  
Dirty little words  
Only lovers say  
  
Rocking through the night  
Rolling on the floor  
When they hear you screaming  
They'll be breaking down the door  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Bed of nails  
Bed of nails  
I'll drive you like a hammer on a bed of nail  
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow  
Gonna drive you like a hammer  
Gonna put in my slammer  
Oh yeah!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Our love is a bed of nails  
Love hurts good on a bed of nails  
I'll lay you down and when all else fails  
I'll drive you like a hammer on a bed of nails  
  
Our love is a bed of nails  
Love hurts good on a bed of nails  
I'll lay you down and when all else fails  
I'll drive you like a hammer on a bed of nails
