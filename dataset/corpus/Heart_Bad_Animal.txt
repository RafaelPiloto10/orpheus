They walk into the lobby  
The pack in black  
Heads are turning  
But they don't look back  
  
They must be crazy  
Not buying in  
Why these outsiders  
Get to shock and offend  
  
They're bad animals - bad animals  
Got to swim upstream got a rebel seed  
Bad animals - bad animals  
Got to push the grain or go insane  
  
Out here on the frontline  
Our territory is nighttime  
We walk the jungle line  
We stay alive  
  
Bad, bad, bad boys and dangerous girls  
Ain't got no prescription  
They make their own styles  
  
Typical family  
Trying not to stare  
Look a little closer now  
If you dare, if you dare, if you dare  
  
Bad animals - bad animals  
Got to swim upstream got a rebel seed  
Bad animals - bad animals  
Got to push the grain or go insane  
  
Out here on the frontline  
Our territory is nighttime  
We walk the jungle line  
We stay alive  
  
Bad animals - bad animals  
Got to swim upstream got a rebel seed  
Bad, bad, bad animals - bad animals  
Got to push the grain or go insane
