Never know how much I love you  
Never know how much I care  
When you put your arms around me  
I get a fever that's so hard to bear  
  
You give me fever when you kiss me  
Fever, when you hold me tight  
Fever in the morning  
Fever all through the night  
  
Sun lights up the daytime  
Moon lights up the night  
I light up when you call my name  
And you know I'm gonna treat you right  
  
You give me fever when you kiss me  
Fever, when you hold me tight  
Fever in the morning  
Fever all through the night  
  
Everybody's got the fever  
That is something you all know  
Fever isn't such a new thing  
Fever started long ago  
  
Romeo loved Juliet  
Juliet, she felt the same  
When he put his arms around her  
He said, "Julie, baby, you're my flame"  
  
Thou givest fever when we kisseth  
Fever with thy flaming youth  
Fever, I'm afire  
Fever, yeah, I burn for sooth  
  
Captain Smith and Pocahontas  
Had a very mad affair  
When her daddy tried to kill him  
She said, "Daddy, oh, don't you dare"  
  
"He gives me fever with his kisses  
Fever when he holds me tight  
Fever, I'm his misses  
Daddy, won't you treat him right", go  
  
Now you've listened to my story  
Here's the point that I have made  
Chicks were born to give you fever  
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade  
  
They give you fever when you kiss them  
Fever, if you live and learn  
Fever till you sizzle  
What a lovely way to burn  
  
What a lovely way to burn  
What a lovely way to burn  
What a lovely way to burn
