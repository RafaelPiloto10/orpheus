Oooooo... Somewhere over the rainbow, Way up high. There's a land that I heard
of, Once in a lullaby. Somewhere over the rainbow, Skies are blue. And the
dreams that you dare to dream, Really do come true. Someday I'll wish upon a
star, And wake up where the clouds are far behind me. Where troubles melt like
lemon drops, High above the chimney tops. That's where you'll find me.
Somewhere over the rainbow, Bluebirds fly. They fly over the rainbow, Why then
- oh, why can't I? I see trees of green, red roses too. I watch them bloom for
me and you. And I think to myself, What a wonderful world. Well, I see skies
of blue and I see clouds of white. The brightness of day and light, darkness
of night. And I think to myself, What a wonderful world. The colours of the
rainbow, so pretty in the sky, Are also on the faces of people passin' by. I
see friends shakin' hands, saying "How do you do!" They're really sayin' "I
love you." I hear babies cry and I watch them grow. They'll learn much more
than I'll ever know. And I think to myself, What a wonderful world. Someday
I'll wish upon a star, And wake up where the clouds are far behind me. Where
troubles melt like lemon drops, High above the chimney tops. That's where
you'll find me. Somewhere over the rainbow, Way up high. Birds fly over the
rainbow, Why then - oh, why can't I? Oooooo...
