Now I've got something I tell you say now  
(Play it real cool) but I'm not fooled  
(Nobody loved you like) the tip of the iceberg  
I know the game and there ain't no rules  
  
I got so much love for you baby  
Bet you any time we can make it  
Don't keep telling yourself That it just wouldn't work out  
So much love in my heart  
  
Well your hoping and praying will get you nowhere  
Don't try and rush me cause I know you  
Put up a bridge could win an Oscar  
But honey why bother I can see you right through  
  
I got so much love for you baby  
Baby if you try we can make it  
Don't keep telling yourself that it just wouldn't work it  
So much love in my heart  
  
Oh in my heart  
Love in my heart
