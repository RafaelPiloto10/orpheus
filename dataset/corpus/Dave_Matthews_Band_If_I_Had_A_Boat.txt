If I had a boat  
I'd go out on the ocean  
And if I had a pony  
I'd ride him on my boat  
And we could all together  
Go out on the ocean  
Me upon my pony on my boat  
  
If I were Roy Rogers  
I'd sure enough be single  
I couldn't bring myself to marrying old Dale  
It'd just be me and trigger  
We'd go riding through them movies  
Then we'd buy a boat and on the sea we'd sail  
  
And if I had a boat  
I'd go out on the ocean  
And if I had a pony  
I'd ride him on my boat  
And we could all together  
Go out on the ocean  
Me upon my pony on my boat  
  
The mystery masked man was smart  
He got himself a Tonto  
'Cause Tonto did the dirty work for free  
But Tonto he was smarter  
And one day said kemo sabe  
Kiss my ass I bought a boat  
I'm going out to sea  
  
And if I had a boat  
I'd go out on the ocean  
And if I had a pony  
I'd ride him on my boat  
And we could all together  
Go out on the ocean  
Me upon my pony on my boat  
  
And if I were like lightning  
I wouldn't need no sneakers  
I'd come and go wherever I would please  
And I'd scare 'em by the shade tree  
And I'd scare 'em by the light pole  
But I would not scare my pony on my boat out on the sea  
  
And if I had a boat  
I'd go out on the ocean  
And if I had a pony  
I'd ride him on my boat  
And we could all together  
Go out on the ocean  
Me upon my pony on my boat
