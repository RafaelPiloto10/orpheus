Hush now my baby  
Be still and don't cry,  
Sleep like you're rocked by the stream  
Sleep and remember, my lullaby  
And I'll be with you when you dream  
  
Drift on a river  
That flows through my arms  
Drift as I'm singing to you,  
I see you smiling, so peaceful and calm  
Holding you I'm smiling too  
  
Here in my arms  
Safe from all harm  
Holding you I'm smiling too  
  
Hush now my baby  
Be still and don't cry,  
Sleep like you're rocked by the stream  
Sleep and remember, my lullaby  
And I'll be with you when you dream  
  
Here in my arms  
Safe from all harm  
Holding you I'm smiling too  
  
Sleep and remember, this river lullaby  
I'll be with you when you dream  
(2x)  
  
I'll be with you when you dream
