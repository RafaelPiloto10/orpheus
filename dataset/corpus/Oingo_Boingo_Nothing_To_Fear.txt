Hey neighbor let me give you some advice  
The russians are about to pulverize us  
In our sleep tonight  
That is if the crazy arabs  
Or the riots don't get us first  
And the fire will rain down from the sky  
The fire will rain down from the sky  
People will die--people will die  
People will die--people will die  
But go ahead sleep tight in your beds  
Remember what the wise man said  
  
Chorus  
There's nothing to fear nothing to fear  
There's nothing to fear nothing to fear  
There's nothing to fear (but fear itself)  
There's nothing to fear (but fear itself)  
And the temperature's starting to drop now  
The temperature's starting to drop now  
The temperature's starting to drop now. ..  
  
Hey little girl won't you come this way  
Won't you let me buy you candy or perhaps a chocolate shake  
Or perhaps some nice cocaine or perhaps a little kiss  
Or perhaps a ride in my big car  
Perhaps a ride in my big car  
Won't you make an old man happy  
Won't you make an old man happy  
Won't you let me show you paradise  
(don't ask your mother for advice)  
  
Chorus  
  
If they don't turn you into a junkie or a zombie on the street  
If they don't turn you into a yo-cat or a grinning jesus freak  
If they don't take away your brains or turn your body inside out  
If they don't take away your passion with a color tv set  
They'll take away your heart and soul  
They'll take away your heart and soul  
They'll take away your heart and soul  
Don't let them take away your heart and soul  
But remember what the wise man said  
  
Chorus
