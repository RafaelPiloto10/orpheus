Just can't win for losing, stare 'em in the eye  
An ego made for bruising, a heart that you can't buy  
If patience is a virtue, let's set out to sin  
I'm all worked up in the desert heat, here I go again  
I never seem to smile, you'll find me in the dirt  
Your lovable reptile, yeah for what it's worth  
I'm poison to your happiness, poison to this song  
C'mon down, c'mon down to the ground so we can sing along  
  
Plug me in, yeah, now set me free  
I got a two fang grip that you should see  
All wrapped up down, 'round your leg  
Let me loose, I'm a powder keg  
I love you  
  
More  
Than you can take  
Make no mistake  
I'm an electric rattlesnake  
More  
Than you can take  
A two fang break  
Electric rattlesnake  
All curled up, make no mistake  
Two fang deep, got skin to break  
Plug me in, got to shake and bake  
Electric rattlesnake  
More  
Than you can take  
No mistake  
Electric rattlesnake  
  
I'm ya satisfaction, give ya skin a glow  
The number one attraction, apples packed to go  
C'mon down the garden, original sin  
Got a two fang bite in the overnight, here I go again  
All about just living, living this or that  
Shake it up and lay it out, the pigs are getting fat  
Bite me as I slither, rape me as I bake  
Plug me in baby, then turn me on  
I'm your electric rattlesnake  
  
Snake bite, color my imagination  
In a spiral dream, a hallucination  
It comes to me with no reservation  
I got the taste, do you mind?  
Snake bite, color my imagination  
Like a spiral dream of illumination  
It fills me up like a medication  
I got the taste, do you mind, here I go again
