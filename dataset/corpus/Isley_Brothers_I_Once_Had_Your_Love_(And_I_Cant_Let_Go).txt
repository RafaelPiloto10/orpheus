Every day I think of you  
Can't believe it's true that I'm so into you  
That I don't know where I'm goin'  
I never felt this way before  
  
All I want to do is to love you, baby  
Behind closed doors  
Ooh, I once had your lovin', baby  
And I can't let go  
I once had your lovin', baby  
And I can't let go  
I once had your lovin', baby  
And I can't let go  
Don't let go  
  
All of the good times that we shared  
Every day's a holiday  
We could celebrate makin' love together  
Ooh, let's keep this fire burnin'  
Every day is new, girl  
When I think of you I get so excited  
Ooh, you keep my whole world turnin'  
  
I just had your lovin', baby  
And I can't let go  
I once had your loving, baby  
And I can't let go  
I once had your loving, baby  
And I can't let go  
Don't let go  
All of the good times that we shared  
Can't let you go  
Can't let you go  
Can't let you go  
Can't let you go  
Girl, I can't let you go  
  
Sure as Heaven above we've found love  
You and I can fly away  
Maybe to L.A. or some lovely island  
Take a stroll along the ocean  
Building castles in the sand  
Doin' all the things we planned together  
Ooh, I love you so much, baby  
  
I once had your lovin', baby  
And I can't let go  
I once had your lovin', baby  
And I can't let go  
I once had your lovin', baby  
And I can't let go  
Don't let go  
  
All of the good times that we shared  
I once had your lovin', baby  
And I can't let go  
I once had your lovin', baby  
And I can't let go  
I once had your lovin', baby  
And I can't let go  
Can't let it go, girl  
  
I once had your lovin', baby  
And I can't let go  
I once had your lovin', baby  
And I can't let go  
I once had your lovin', baby  
And I can't let go  
Can't let it go, no, no  
  
Ooh, I once had your lovin', baby  
And I can't let go  
I once had your lovin', baby  
And I can't let go  
I once had your lovin', baby  
And I can't let go  
Can't let go  
I once had your lovin', baby  
Can't let go  
I once had your lovin', baby  
Can't let go  
I once had your lovin', baby  
And I can't let go, ooh
