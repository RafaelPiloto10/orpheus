Low and lonely, sad and blue  
Thinking only of little you  
Always trying to keep from crying  
I'm low and lonely over you  
  
Do you miss me? Say you do  
Tell me darlin', tell me true?  
Do you yearn dear, will you return dear?  
I'm low and lonely over you  
  
Low and lonely, weary too  
You're the only true love I knew  
Don't be long dear, you know it's wrong dear  
I'm low and lonely over you  
  
Low and lonely, sad and blue  
Thinking only of little you  
Always trying to keep from crying  
I'm low and lonely over you
