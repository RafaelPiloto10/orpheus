Discussing Wallace Chambers  
I hear you talking  
Distoring Wallace Chambers  
Obscene, not absurd  
Convincing Broderick Lewis  
Crawl before walking  
Original no-neck savage  
Fishing for birds.  
You walk into the room  
Without a broom  
To sweep away time lost  
At all cost  
Wallace hears everything  
Wallace hits everything  
Wallace hunts everything  
Wallace hurts everything  
Wallace hates everything
