Young blood has got it shakin'  
Growin' up, she's changin'  
She's so tough to try tame her  
These days she just wants to run wild  
  
Short skirt, loves her make up  
Plays the flirt, it's daddy's wake up  
He's on the edge of teen age shake up  
It's so bad he's losing sleep at night  
  
Cause he was young once restless and free  
An apple doesn't fall far from a tree  
  
She's the pride of the family  
Stands above the crowd, makes them all believe  
She's the pride of the family  
When it's her time to fly  
She's got love on her side  
  
Photographs of her childhood  
The years have passed  
Where did they run to  
Love still lasts the tears they've been through  
Time's a thief as precious moments fly by  
  
Dreamy eyes like her mama  
Her temper flies like her papa  
Her brother's cool and he's never been a bother  
But he's someone to turn to  
When life ain't feelin' right  
  
Hold on loosely but never let go  
The rest she'll have to find out on her own  
  
She's the pride of the family  
Stands above the crowd, makes them all believe  
She's the pride of the family  
When it's her time to fly  
She's got love on her side  
  
Hold on loosely but never let go  
The rest she'll have to find out on her own  
  
She's the pride of the family  
Stands above the crowd, makes them all believe  
She's the pride of the family  
When it's her time to fly  
She's got love on her side
