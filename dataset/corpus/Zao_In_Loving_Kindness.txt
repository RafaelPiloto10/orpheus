We are a new creation, the old has gone, the new has come.  
Reconcile us to Himself, through Christ Jesus.  
We will be free, forever knowing what will become... of us.  
Thank you for the cross.  
Trusting in the balance has tilted me towards righteousness.  
Lifting my spirit once again, sinking not in my functioning.  
Inhale, exhale this over and over again.  
Looking for tomorrow forgetting about today.  
Dying, dying.  
Through prayer and sacrifice into all the earth,  
With love and understanding.  
Now I look to importance, standing here steadfast,  
To renew (the? or Your?) spirit within me.  
Do not cast me from Your presence,  
Or take Your Holy Spirit from me
