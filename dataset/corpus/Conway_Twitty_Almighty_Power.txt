When you feel like you've come to the end of your way you need love  
When all you get is lonesome at the end of the day you need love  
When you've lived the lifetime in a night still there's darkness above  
There's no way to measure the almighty power of a good woman's love.  
  
When you got an old mem'ry that refuses to die you need love  
When you feel someone special has long passed you by you need love  
When you've lived the lifetime in a night still there's darkness above  
There's no way to measure the almighty power of a good woman's love.  
  
A good woman's love is all that any man needs  
Give me a good woman's love my heart my sould and mind plead  
When there's someone somewhere that you're thinking of  
There's no way to measure the almighty power of a good woman's love...
