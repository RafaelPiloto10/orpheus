The door was open, I was seething  
Your mother burst in it was freezing  
She said it looks like it's trying to rain  
I was lost, I felt sea sick  
You convinced me that he'd left  
You said keep talking but don't use their names  
I scolded your driver and your brother  
We are old enough to know how long you've been hooked  
And we've all been through the war  
And each time you score  
Someone gets hauled and handcuffed and booked  
  
It felt like four in the morning  
What sounded like fire works  
Turned out to be just what it was  
The stars looked like diamonds  
Then came the sirens  
And everyone started to cuss  
  
All the noise was disturbing  
And I couldn't find Irving  
It was like two stations on at the same time  
And then I hid your car keys  
And I made black coffee  
And I dumped out the rest of the rum  
  
Nick and Socorro broke up  
And Candice wouldn't shut up  
Fin he recorded the whole thing  
Ray he said damn you  
And someone broke my camera  
And it was New Years  
And we all started to sing  
  
Should auld acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind  
Should auld acquaintance be forgot for the sake of auld lang syne  
  
I was leaving in the morning with Charles for Las Vegas  
And I didn't plan to come back  
I had only a few things  
Two hundred dollars  
And my records in a brown paper sack  
  
I ran out on Sheila  
Everything's in storage  
Calvin's right I should go back to driving truck  
  
Should auld acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind  
Should auld acquaintance be forgot for the sake of auld lang syne
