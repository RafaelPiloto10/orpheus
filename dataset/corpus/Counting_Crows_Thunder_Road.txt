(Original by Bruce Springsteen)  
(done as an alternate in Rain King)  
  
The screen door slams  
Mary's dress waves  
Like a vision she dances across the porch  
As the radio plays  
Roy Orbison singing for the lonely  
Hey that's me and I want you only  
Don't turn me home again  
I just can't face myself alone again  
Don't run back inside  
Darling you know just what I'm here for  
So you're scared and you're thinking  
That maybe we ain't that young anymore  
Show a little faith, there's magic in the night  
You ain't a beauty, but hey you're alright  
Oh and that's alright with me  
Oh oh come take my hand  
Driving out tonight to case the promised land  
Oh oh Thunder Road, oh Thunder Road  
Oh Thunder Road  
Show a little faith, there's magic in the night  
You ain't a beauty, but hey you're alright  
Oh and that's alright with me
