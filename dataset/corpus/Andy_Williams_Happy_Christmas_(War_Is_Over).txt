So this is Christmas  
And what have you done  
Another year's over  
And a new one's begun  
  
And so this is Christmas  
I hope you had fun  
The near and the dear one  
The old and the young  
  
A Merry, Merry Christmas  
And a Happy New Year  
Let's hope it's a good one  
Without any fear  
  
And so this is Christmas  
(War is over)  
For weak and for strong  
(If you want it)  
The rich and the poor ones  
(War is over)  
Who waited so long  
(Ohh)  
  
And so Happy Christmas  
(War is over)  
For black and for white  
(If you want it)  
For yellow and red ones  
(War is over)  
Let's stop all the fight  
(Now)  
  
A Merry, Merry Christmas  
And a Happy New Year  
Let's hope it's a good one  
Without any fear  
  
And so this is Christmas  
And what have you done  
Another year's over  
And a new one's begun  
  
And so Happy Christmas  
I hope you've had fun  
The near and the dear one  
The old and the young  
  
A Merry, Merry Christmas  
And a Happy New Year  
Let's hope it's a good one  
Without any fear
