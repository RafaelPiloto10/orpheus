In the morning  
Don't say you love me  
'Cause I'll only kick you out of the door  
  
I know your name is Rita  
'Cause your perfume smelling sweeter  
Since when I saw you down on the floor  
guitar  
  
Won't need to much persuading  
I don't mean to sound degrading  
But with a face like that  
You got nothing to laugh about  
  
Red lips hair and fingernails  
I hear your a mean old Jezebel  
Lets go up stairs and read my tarot cards  
  
Stay with me  
Stay with me  
For tonight you better stay with me  
  
Stay with me  
Stay with me  
For tonight you better stay with me  
  
So in the morning  
Please don't say you love me  
'Cause you know I'll only kick you out the door  
  
Yea I'll pay your cab fare home  
You can even use my best cologne  
Just don't be here in the morning when I wake up  
  
Stay with me  
Stay with me  
'Cause tonight you better stay with me  
Sit down, get up, get down  
  
Stay with me  
Stay with me  
Cause tonight your going stay with me  
Hey, whats your name again  
Oh no, get down
