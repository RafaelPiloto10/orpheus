Atop the mountain, where the river of steel flows  
Black is the forest, white was the snow.  
There as children, how could children know?  
One without name or number soon would show.  
  
There stood he, on his chariot made of gold  
He did reveal the trinity of secrets old.  
  
A sceptre of iron could mercy bring.  
A shield of gold, the Creator and king,  
And the great sword of steel.  
  
Sons of destiny shall wield.  
Hear Wisdom's voice.  
Rise, know the strength that you feel.  
Hold in your heart, but never reveal  
You were called by the Gods, their powers to wield.  
Guard well the secret of steel.
