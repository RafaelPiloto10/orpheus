Watching the smiles on those "a few" who have somebody to hold onto.  
Knowing I need you, knowing your needed, a special way to be.  
My heart was shot by cupids arrow, while gaining all my pain and sorrow.  
  
Our silver turns to gold when I have you to hold.  
Sometimes your fire, sometimes ice, sometimes your in paradise yeah.  
Paradise yeah, paradise yeah.  
  
When you smile, the sun shines out of a blue sky  
Rainbows burst into bloom,  
People are dancing and some are romancing.  
Grey skies are out of view,  
And when your heart was young, you'll sing a summer song.  
  
Our silver turns to gold when I have you to hold.  
Sometimes your fire, sometimes ice, sometimes your in paradise yeah.  
Paradise yeah, paradise yeah.  
  
Just when your sweetheart whispers I love you.  
Flowers burst into bloom,  
Love hens are swimming and church bells are ringing,  
Each time I think of you.  
Then on both you and I, lights on forever shine.  
  
Our silver turns to gold when I have you to hold.  
Sometimes your fire, sometimes ice, sometimes your in paradise yeah.  
Paradise yeah, paradise yeah.  
  
Our silver turns to gold when I have you to hold.  
Sometimes your fire, sometimes ice, sometimes your in paradise yeah.  
Paradise yeah, paradise yeah
