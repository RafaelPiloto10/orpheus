Through the years we laughed together as one family  
Growing wiser through the years with every tear  
Through the years enjoying love and life in unity  
Building dreams and reaching out to all the world  
Yes forever we will stand  
With each other hand in hand  
I will always be around for you my friend  
  
Through the years, we've been together  
Memories of me and you  
(Through the years Staying true) for worse or for better  
In all the years we've all been through  
For whatever comes our way  
Every single moment of the day  
We will always be as one in joys and tears  
Building memories again through all the years
