I know you're standing there  
Trying to say the words  
You took so long to prepare  
But I laugh, pretending I don't see  
'Cause I don't want to hear  
What you got to say to me  
  
Can't it wait until tomorrow  
Before you bring me the showers?  
Can't it wait until tomorrow?  
Give me twenty-four more hours  
  
I've seen it coming for quite sometime now  
Don't you know I've tried to stop it  
In every way I know how?  
And I know it's hard for you  
As it is for me  
So listen to my heart  
Begging desperately  
  
Can't it wait until tomorrow  
Before you bring me the showers?  
Oh, wait until tomorrow  
Give me twenty-four more hours  
  
Baby, please give me twenty-four more hours  
Can't it wait until tomorrow  
Before you bring me the showers?  
Can't it wait until tomorrow?  
Give me twenty-four more hours  
  
Can't it wait until tomorrow  
Before you bring me the showers?  
Oh, wait until tomorrow  
Give me twenty-four more hours
