Into my life  
You brought a glowing love  
Like a ray of sunshine  
From up above  
One day out of a clear blue sky  
You darkened my life with your words "goodbye"  
That's the day you left me for a stranger  
Don't you know that when you left my life  
Took on a change-a?  
  
Now I'm telling you it  
Ain't no sun since you've been gone  
  
There's a big black cloud hanging over my head  
Cloud of loneliness I feel like I'm dead  
Ain't no flowers blooming round here for sure  
Since you chose to love me no more  
I guess you know you took my sunshine away from me baby, boy  
You took the life from my world  
Crushed my dreams  
And I don't mean maybe, baby, baby  
And it ain't no sun since you've been gone  
  
Oh, my future, my future  
Was as bright as the sun, yes it was  
I ain't got no future since you've been gone  
  
I guess you know you took my sunshine away from me baby, yes you did  
You took the life from my world  
Crushed my dreams  
And I don't mean maybe, baby, baby  
It seems like night in the middle of the day  
Everything around me is faded and grey  
Cold are the days  
Dark creeps the night  
Never bringing you back into my life  
It ain't no sun since you've been gone  
  
You took my sunshine away, yeah ooh, ooh, ooh  
You took my sunshine away, yes you did, ooh, ooh, ooh  
You took my sunshine away, yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh  
You took my sunshine away, oh
