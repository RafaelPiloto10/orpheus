Whatcha got  
Whatcha got in your hand  
The father said his son  
I got the whole world here daddy  
'tween my fingers and my thumb  
Will you take care of it please?  
It's the only one  
It'd take me a lifetime old man  
To undo whatcha done  
To undo whatcha done  
Oh c'mon now  
Boy think what would Jesus do  
He'd shake his head like an angry mother  
Spoke the boy and say 'I did what I could do'  
But you take care of it please?  
It's the only one ya got  
It'll take ten lifetimes boy  
To undo what I've done  
Boy shrugged walked away  
The man stood and watched as he was leaving  
Boy just walked away  
The man stood alone thinking  
One hand is bleeding  
And the other hand holds a gun  
While everything is open  
Everything is shut down, down, down  
Begin to ending is really  
Just a go round, and round, and round  
And while I stand here, the ground beneath is nothing  
More than one point of view  
What you got, what you got in your hand?  
Your secret's safe with me  
Well I found the truth friend  
Let me whisper in your ear  
Take good care of it please  
It's the only one there is  
Can I twist it please, can I give it just a little twist?  
Boy shrugged walked away  
The man stood and watched that boy disappearing  
Boy just walked away  
The man stood there twisting  
One hand is bleeding, Oh as the other hand holds the gun  
Everything is open  
Now everything is shut down, down, down  
No one is hoping, even if you know  
You never know it all  
The ground beneath is  
Nothing more than my point of view  
Boy shrugged walked away  
The man stood and watched, the boy was leaving  
Boy just walked away  
The man stood there twisting  
One hand is open and the other hand holds the gun  
Everything is undone  
Or is everything coming down, down, down  
No one is hoping, even if you know  
You never know it all  
Nothing more than my point of view.  
  
Boy shrugged walked away  
The man stood and watched as he was leaving  
The man just stood there twisting
