Got that feeling  
Luck is just a little of it  
Got that feeling  
I can't stop winning  
  
A to Z  
Look what you're missing, as we speak  
Your number's rising, take a peak  
There's just enough to go around, get a piece  
Your own little piece of hell  
  
Got that feeling  
Loving every minute of it  
Got that feeling  
I can't stop winning  
  
Have a drink  
A pot of coffee, cannot think  
Too many friends here, just an inch  
Between striking out and striking rich, just a risk  
One I'll take and take again  
  
Got that feeling  
Gotta bet a little of it  
Got that feeling  
I can't stop winning  
And start living  
  
You can't borrow tomorrow
