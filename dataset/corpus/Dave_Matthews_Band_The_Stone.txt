I've this creeping suspicion  
That things here are not as they seem  
Reassure me  
Of why do I feel as if I'm in too deep  
Now I've been praying  
For some way to show them I'm not what they see  
Yes I have done wrong  
But what I did I thought needed be done  
I swear  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh unholy day  
If I leave now I might get away  
Oh bu this weighs on me  
As heavy as stone an as blue as I go  
  
I was just wondering if you'd come along  
Hold up my head when my head won't hold on  
I'll do the same if the same's what you want  
If not I'll go  
I will go a...  
  
...long way  
From that fool's mistake  
and now forever pain  
Go run, I will run and I'll be ok  
  
[Chorus]  
  
...long way  
To bury the past for I don't want to pay  
Oh how I wish this  
To turn back the clock and do over again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I need do  
To stay in your arms see you smile hold you close  
And now it weighs on me  
As heavy as stone and a bone-chilling cold  
  
I was just wondering if you'd come along  
Tell me you will
