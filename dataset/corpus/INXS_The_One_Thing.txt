Well you know just what you do to me  
The way you move soft and slippery  
Cut the night just like a razor  
Rarely talk and that's the danger  
  
It's the one thing  
You are my thing  
  
You know your voice is a love song  
It's a cat call from the past  
There's no ice in your lovers walk  
You don't look twice cause you move so fast  
  
It's the one thing  
You are my thing  
  
You've got a dozen men behind you  
You've got dead flowers on the floor  
You're too pretty in the daylight  
It keeps them coming back for more  
  
It's the one thing  
You are my thing  
  
It's the one thing  
You are my thing  
  
It's the one thing  
You are my thing
