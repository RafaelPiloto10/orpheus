Sweatin' hard, I didn't get a shot  
All I did was stand around and get too hot  
Knowin' all the people walkin' on my side  
Losin' all my money and I'm getting tired  
Ol' Bill he come a'runnin' like he's gettin' some  
Makes you kind of jealous but it sure is fun  
I don't mind, but he wants my lady too  
  
You know the crowd gets bigger as the word goes 'round  
Pool hall king was playin' back in town  
Minnesota Fats standin' up at the back  
Tryin' to hide himself in a plastic mack  
You ought to hear the silence when the kid walks in  
His reputation's bigger than gasoline  
I don't mind but he's tryin' to fill my lady too  
Pool Hall Richard, you're far too wicked we know  
Pool Hall Richard, kid you're wicked, we know  
You broke my heart  
Same as you could ever do  
With your yellow carnation and your pink satin shoe  
You make me jealous but I worship you  
One day soon I'm gonna beat you clean  
Wipe that smile right off your chin  
Everybody gonna drive from miles around  
Cuein' up to see me take away your crown  
Then you'll never never ever take my lady then  
  
Pool Hall Richard, you're far too wicked we know  
Pool Hall Richard, kid you're wicked, we know  
You broke my heart  
Same as you could ever do  
Dig this  
Bam goes the brown, that's another one down  
Know they play much better when the sun goes down  
Bang goes the green, you're so obscene  
Your hands are dirty but your scent is clean  
Bam goes the blue, lock away your cue  
The pool hall king is hustlin' you  
Bam goes the 8-ball, didn't see it spin at all  
This kid can play, oh yeah  
  
Bam goes the brown, ooh another one down  
Know they play much better when the sun goes down  
Bang goes the green, you're so obscene  
Your hands are dirty, your scent is clean  
Damn the pink, one more to sink  
Gonna beat you someday 'cause you're makin' me sick  
Down on the black, at the back of the pack  
Aw, you nearly missed, you ain't so hot  
  
Pool Hall Richard, kid you're wicked, we know  
You broke my heart  
Same as you could ever do  
You're breakin' my heart  
But you're stealin' my tart  
Shut up
