He followed her to work this morning  
He'd never seen that dress before  
She seemed to sail right through  
Those dark clouds forming  
That he knows he's headed for  
After seven years of marriage  
He wanted out  
Now after seven months of freedom  
It's clear that there's no doubt  
She's gonna make it  
And he never will  
He's at the foot of the mountain  
And she's over that hill  
He's sinkin' at sea  
And her sails are filled  
She's gonna make it  
And he never will  
And you know it's not like she's forgot about him  
She's just dealing with the pain  
And the fact that she's survived so well without him  
You know it's driving him insane  
And the crazy thing about it  
Is she'd take him back  
But the fool in him that walked out  
Is the fool who just won't ask  
She's gonna make it  
And he never will  
He's at the foot of the mountain  
And she's over that hill  
He's sinkin' at sea  
And her sails are filled  
She's gonna make it  
And he never will  
She's gonna make it  
He never will
