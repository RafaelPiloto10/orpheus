If my heart's not too late  
For a piece of your TIME  
There's been so many days  
Since your eyes looked at mine.  
In the dark of this room  
Where the burning has grown  
You believe in your love  
When you're lost and alone  
And life don't give no reasons  
When the love goes away  
No answers for someone like you.  
  
Chorus  
Hold me, hold me  
Seems like we never get together anymore  
Hold me, hold me  
Starry nights don't come enough  
That's what we come here for, hold me.  
  
I will lay by your side  
I can warm your cold nights  
You can play in my dreams  
Til I'm out of your sight  
In the morning my love  
Couldn't change where you go  
You were always my woman  
It's the one truth I know  
So hold out, when there's no chance  
For your love anyway  
No diamond could shine close to you  
  
Chorus:  
Hold me, hold me  
Seems like we never get together anymore  
Hold me, hold me  
Starry nights don't come enough  
That's what we CAME here for, hold me.
