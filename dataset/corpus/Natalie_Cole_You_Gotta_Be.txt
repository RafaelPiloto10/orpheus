Listen as your day unfolds  
Challenge what the future holds

You gotta be bad, you gotta be bold

Herald what your mother said  
Readin' the books your father read  
Try to solve the puzzles in your own sweet time

Time ask no questions, it goes on without you  
Leaving you behind if you can't stand the pace

The best part is danger staring you in the face
