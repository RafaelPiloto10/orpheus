It's coming on like a fever  
Burning deep inside of your brain  
Have you become a believer  
Have you gone a little insane  
  
Tonight your life is a party  
Let the celebration begin  
Turn on the lights and let's start it  
Find out what condition your condition is in  
  
Check in  
Check out  
No one needs to know  
What you're thinking about  
In the here  
In the now  
You can take it in  
While you're working it out  
'Cause you're into it  
When you're out of it  
Everything is cool in the land  
Of the brave new world  
  
Hail to the new corporation  
Fulfilling every need and desire  
Come take a mental vacation  
The reservation never expires  
  
I say we make it a holiday  
Bigger than the 4th of July  
Declare a new independence Day  
Yeah there's nothing to it  
You can do it if you try  
  
Time is always on our side  
Love is there to be our guide  
We are spirits pure and free  
And all our dreams are meant to be  
Realized  
  
But if we were granted just one minute  
To choose a dream and stay there in it  
How could we decide?  
  
We are a sea of tranquility  
We are the new golden age  
History is a mystery  
We will start it over on  
A blank new page  
  
Check in  
Check out  
No one needs to know  
What you're thinking about  
In the here  
In the now  
You can take it in  
While you're working it out  
'Cause you're into it  
When you're out of it  
Everything is cool in the land  
Of the brave new world  
  
And life is good
