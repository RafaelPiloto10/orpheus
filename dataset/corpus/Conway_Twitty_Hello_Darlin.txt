Hello, darlin', nice to see ya  
It's been a long time  
You're just as lovely as you used to be  
  
How's your new love? Are you happy?  
Hope you're doin' fine  
Just to know it means so much to me  
  
What's that, darlin? "How'm I doin'?"  
I'm doin' all right  
Except I can't sleep and I cry all night till dawn  
What I'm trying to say is "I love you and I miss you"  
"And I'm so sorry that I did you wrong"  
  
Look up, darlin', let me kiss ya  
Just for old time's sake  
Let me hold you , in my arms one more time  
  
Thank ya, darlin', may God bless you  
And each step you take  
Bring you closer to the thing you seek to find  
  
Goodbye, darlin', gotta go now  
Gotta try to find a way  
To lose these mem'ries of a love so warm and true  
And if you should ever find it in your heart ta forgive me  
Come back, darlin', I'll be waiting for you
