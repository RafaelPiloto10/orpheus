I have heard the mavis singing  
His love song to the moon  
I have seen the dewdrop clinging  
To the rose just nearly born  
But a sweeter song has cheer'd me  
At the evening's gentle close  
And I've seen an eye still brighter  
Than the dewdrop on the rose  
'twas thy voice, my gentle mary,  
And thine artless winning smile  
That made this world an eden,  
Bonie mary of argyle  
Tho' thy voice may lose it's sweetness,  
Thine eye it's brightness too  
Tho' thy step may lack it's fleetness  
And thy hair it's sunny hue  
Still to me wilt thou be dearer  
Than all the world shall own  
I have loved thee for thy beauty,  
But not for that alone  
I have watched thy heart, dear mary  
And it's goodness was the wile  
That has made thee mine forever,  
Bonnie mary of argyle
