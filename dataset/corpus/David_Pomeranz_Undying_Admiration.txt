Sometimes late at night  
I sit beside our bed  
Watching you sleeping so sweetly  
I'm almost completely out of my head  
Every breath you breathe  
Is a work of art  
Everytime you sigh just breaks my heart  
There's no one in this whole world  
Inspires me the way that you do  
Undying admiration  
Undying admiration  
I'll sing it to the night  
I'll sing until the light  
Undying admiration  
  
And when the morning comes  
And a little child appears  
Hearing the love in your laughter  
Sometimes I just have to hold back the tears  
  
The passion on your face  
The depth of your soul  
Would inspire any muse to lose control  
There's no one in this whole world  
That teaches me the way that you do  
  
Undying admiration  
Undying admiration  
I'll write it on the sky  
And tell the world of my  
Undying admiration  
  
All my life I've waited for  
The kind of love  
Keats and Shelley would be jealous of  
And it's you baby  
You made it all come true baby  
Oh, oh  
  
Undying admiration  
Undying admiration  
I'll write it on the sky  
And tell the world of my  
Undying admiration
