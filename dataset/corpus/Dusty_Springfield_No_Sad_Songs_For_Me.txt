(Tom Springfield)  
  
The Springfields  
  
No sad songs for me  
Soon our love will be  
Just a memory  
It's all over  
  
I walk around imagining  
The way you'll say goodbye  
And when you try to tell me  
I just hope that I won't cry  
  
No sad songs for me  
Soon our love will be  
Just a memory  
It's all over  
  
The glow has gone forever  
And our dreams have turned to dust  
I don't know how I can go on  
And yet I know I must  
  
No sad songs for me  
Soon our love will be  
Just a memory  
It's all over  
  
It breaks my heart to feel this way  
Although I try to smile  
To think I'll be alone again  
In just a little while  
  
No sad songs for me  
Soon our love will be  
Just a memory  
It's all over  
It's all over  
It's all over
