If I had one wish  
I'd make us drift away far from this place  
And you know better than me that I like it my way  
Since the circumstance is weak,  
I know that you are swallowing your pride  
When you look at me  
  
All I'm trying to say  
Is that whatever you do it's okay  
Baby I'll stay  
  
I am not a fool  
And it comes straight down to your p's and q's  
And mister I think you have me all wrong  
'Cause at the end of every day  
I like to lay my head your way  
And listen to your heart sing  
  
All I'm trying to say  
Is that whatever you do it's okay  
'Cause baby I'll stay with you  
I'll stay with you
