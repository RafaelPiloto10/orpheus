We have been waiting for you  
We have been waiting for you, for you  
We're still waiting for you to come inside  
You won't be leaving, you are mine  
I am afraid that the end is near  
No more moments of moonlight  
We're still waiting for you to come inside  
You won't be leaving, you are mine  
I'm so afraid that the end is near  
No more moments of moonlight  
We'll still be waiting, I'm still waiting for you  
Those sick dead eyes tell me, tell me you are mine  
I am afraid that the end is here  
No more moments of moonlight  
I have been there to push you through  
Down, down, down through the deep dark wells  
Through the animal realm  
Let me be the one, the first to welcome you to hell  
Your poor pathetic lies and evil ways  
Have brought you here, give it all to me  
I need for you to stay here with me  
Don't go away  
I'll stay here with you until the end of time  
Until it all goes away, don't run this way
