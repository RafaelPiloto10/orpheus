I've been hiding, lost in the love of another. I've followed the moon and a
song and I thought it would take me forever to find a place where I belong. I
watch a rainbow rise. I give you all i'v  
.  
  
I could never give you up, the way you make my love shine. I could never give
you up, the way you make true love shine.  
  
I believe you when you say you don't want to be lonely. I'll carry your heart
like a bridge when you need all the time you can find to get the hurt out of
your mind. I'll watch the rain go by an  
E you all I've got.  
  
Cause I could never give you up...
