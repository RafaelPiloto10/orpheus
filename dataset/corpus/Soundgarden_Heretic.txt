Lyrics by hiro yamamoto  
Music by kim thayil  
Heretic, burn at the stake  
Witch float like a log  
  
Wine from the blade on the night of the full moon  
Voices that call spirits in waiting  
Sharing the drink of the bond  
A broth of roots and charms  
Spells under a twisted tree  
  
Heretic, burn at the cross  
Witch, float like a log  
  
Flask over fire, from cobwebs of cellars  
Turning metal into gold  
A secret till the last word's untold  
  
Accused and convicted  
For nothing I suffer your fear  
Nailed to a burning cross  
Heretic, heretic
