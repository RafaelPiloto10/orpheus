You took my breath away  
I want it back again  
Look at the mess I'm in  
I don't know what to say  
I don't know how to feel  
You don't care anyway  
All I can do is wait  
You took my breath away  
  
You took this song of mine  
And changed the middle bit  
It used to sound alright  
But now the words don't fit  
Its getting hard to rhyme  
Impossible to play  
I've tried it many times  
You took my breath away  
  
One day when the sun is shining  
There will be that silver lining  
  
You knocked my headlights out  
So turn them on again  
I can't see where I'm going  
I can't tell where I've been  
I don't know how to feel  
This hasnt been my day  
Seems like I've lost a wheel  
You took my breath away  
  
You took my breath away  
You took my breath away  
You took my breath away
