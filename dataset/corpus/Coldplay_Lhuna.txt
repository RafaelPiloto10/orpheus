I'm all by myself, I don't need anybody else  
I'm all by myself, no help  
I'm all on my own quietly sleeping in my home  
I'm all on my own, my own  
  
Hello, won't you let me come in?  
Lhuna, can't you hear how much I'm suffering?  
Hello, won't you let me know?  
'Cause I'm all alone, all alone  
  
We are dreaming about Lhuna  
The smell of her, the touch and the taste of her  
Dreaming about Lhuna  
Her and me simultaneously  
  
I don't know what the time is  
I don't know where you've flown  
And I don't know why you're so far from home  
  
Hello, won't you let me come in?  
Lhuna, can't you hear how much I'm suffering?  
Hello, won't you let me know?  
'Cause I'm all alone, all alone  
  
We are dreaming about Lhuna  
The smell of her, the touch and the taste of her  
Dreaming about Lhuna  
Her and me simultaneously  
Her and me, effortlessly  
Oh, her and me effortlessly
