I keep playing it inside my head,  
All that you said to me.  
I lie awake just to convince myself,  
This wasn't just a dream.  
  
'Cause you were right here,  
And I should've taken the chance.  
But I got so scared,  
And I lost the moment again.  
It's all that I can think about,  
Oh, you're all that I can think about  
  
Is your heart taken?  
Is there somebody else on your mind?  
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused,  
Just tell me, am I out of time?  
Is your heart breaking?  
How do you feel about me now?  
I can't believe I let you walk away when  
When, I should have kissed you  
  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
  
Every morning when I leave my house,  
I always look for you.  
Yeah, I see you every time I close my eyes,  
What am I gonna go?  
  
And all my friends say that I'm punching over my weight  
But in my eyes i saw how you're looking at me  
It's all that I can think about,  
Oh, you're all that I can think about  
  
Is your heart taken?  
Is there somebody else on your mind?  
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused,  
Just tell me, am I out of time?  
Is your heart breaking?  
How do you feel about me now?  
I cant believe I let you walk away when  
When, I should have kissed you  
  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
  
When you stood there, just a heartbeat away  
When we were dancing, and you looked up at me  
If I had known then that I'd be feeling this way  
If I could replay I would never have let you go  
No, oh, never have let you go  
Am I out of time?  
  
Is your heart taken?  
Is there somebody else on your mind?  
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused,  
Just tell me, am I out of time?  
Is your heart breaking?  
How do you feel about me now?  
I cant believe I let you walk away when  
When, I should have kissed you  
  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should have kissed you
