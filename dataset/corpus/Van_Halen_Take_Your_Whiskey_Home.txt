Well, my baby, she don't want me around.  
She said she's tired of watchin' me fall down.  
She wants the good life, only the best.  
But I like that bottle better than the rest.  
And she said: I think that you're headed for a whole lot of trouble.  
Well, I think that you're headed for a whole lot of trouble.  
Well, I think that you're headed for a whole lot of trouble.  
If you take your whiskey...  
Well, that liquor in the nighttime leaves strange memories.  
Seems a lifetime since yesterday.  
Come the daybreak, come the morrow,  
That woman's waited up all night for me again.  
She said: Well, I think that you're headed for a whole lot of trouble.  
Yeah, I think that you're headed for a whole lot of trouble.  
Yeah, you know that you're headed for a lot of trouble.  
If you take your whiskey home.  
Some goes to women, some goes to Jesus,  
Though I'm absolutely certain both's all right.  
But it takes me at least halfway to the label  
'Fore I can even make it through the night.  
Well, I think that you're headed for a whole lot of trouble.  
Yeah, I think that you're headed for a whole lot of trouble.  
Yeah, you know that you're headed for a lot of trouble.  
If you take your whiskey home.
