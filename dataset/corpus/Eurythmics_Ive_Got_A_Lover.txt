I've got a lover back in japan  
He's got tatooes  
He's my superman  
I try to call him up from time to time  
We can talk about the weather  
Is the weather fine?  
  
And I say break, break  
Break away those ties  
Break, break.  
  
I've got a lover  
Up in outer space  
He's been tumbling around  
All over the place  
I like to call him from time to time  
We can talk about heaven...  
  
Break, break  
Break away those ties  
Break, break...  
  
When the whole world descends on me  
I'll be waiting for you...  
  
Got another lover in timbuktu  
Got a name for him  
He's my little guru.  
When I don't call him he starts to cry  
I have to tell him stories just to pacify.  
  
Break, break...  
  
When the whole world descends on me  
I'll be waiting for you...  
  
I was bitter when I met you  
I was eloquent with rage  
Like honey from a poisoned cup  
I flowed from stage to stage.  
(ooh... Sugar baby... Sing me a lullaby.)  
Japanese baby...
