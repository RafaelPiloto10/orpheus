All the stations up here don't sign off with Dixie,  
The way they did in sweet home Alabama,  
The people here don't sip Jack Daniels whiskey,  
The way they do in that Tennessee mountain land.  
  
I've always heard lots about the big apple,  
So I thought I'd come up here and see,  
But all I've seen so far is one big hassle,  
Wish I was camped out on the Okeechobee.  
  
If this is the promised land,  
I've had all I can stand,  
And I'm headed back below that Dixie line  
Well I just don't fit in,  
And I'll never come back again,  
I'm busted here with Dixie on my mind,  
Oh, I'm stuck up here and I got Dixie on my mind.  
  
These people never smile or say a word,  
They're all too busy tryin' to make an extra dime,  
Oh I'd love to haul 'em all down around Spartanburg,  
And show 'em how to raise hell in Carolina.  
  
Oh, the things you know that I miss most of all,  
Is the freedom of the rivers and the pines,  
They don't do much huntin' and fishin' up here ya know,  
But I have met a few squirrels and one porcupine.  
  
If this is the promised land,  
I've had all I can stand,  
Wish I was down in Houston town tonight,  
Well I just don't fit in,  
And I'll never come back again,  
I'm busted here with Dixie on my mind,  
Oh, I'm stuck up here and I got Dixie on my mind.
