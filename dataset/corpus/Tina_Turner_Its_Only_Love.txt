When the feeling is ended  
There ain't no use pretending  
Don't you worry, it's only love  
When your world has been shattered  
Ain't nothing else matters  
It ain't over, it's only love  
And that's all  
  
When your heart has been broken  
Hard words have been spoken  
It ain't easy, but it's only love  
And if your life ain't worth living  
And you're ready to give in  
Just remember that it's only love  
Yeah, that's all  
  
You can live without the aggravation  
You gotta want to win, you gotta want to win  
You keep looking back in desperation  
Over and over and over again
