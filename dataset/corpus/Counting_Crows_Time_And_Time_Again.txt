I wanted so badly  
Somebody other than me  
Staring back at me  
But you were gone  
  
I wanted to see you walking backwards  
And get the sensation of you coming home  
I wanted to see you walking away from me  
Without the sensation of you leaving me alone  
  
Time and time again  
Time and time again  
Time and time again  
I can't please myself  
  
I wanted the ocean to cover over me  
I wanna sink slowly without getting wet  
Maybe someday, I won't be so lonely  
And I'll walk on water every chance I get  
  
Time and time again  
Time and time again  
Time and time again  
I can't please myself  
  
So when are you coming home  
Sweet angel?  
You leaving me alone?  
All alone?  
Well, if I'm drowning darling, you'll come down this way on your own  
  
I wish I was traveling on a freeway  
Beneath this graveyard western sky  
I'm gonna set fire to this city  
And out into the desert  
we're gonna ride  
  
Time and time again  
Time and time again  
Time and time again  
I can't please myself
