Don't tell me your name, just use that pretty mouth  
Kiss me if you want this, but I want you inside out  
Start here at the end and later, when we're waking  
Our bodies still weak, we finally meet, turn my head and say  
  
We could be perfect strangers, let's spend tonight  
We could be perfect strangers, hello, won't you look in my eyes?  
Don't let this bad world change you  
You got places to go, so much further than I can see  
  
We could be perfect strangers  
Thank you for spending one night with me  
  
Let's just keep this simple  
It's say, then it's goodbye  
The syrup's so much sweeter when you let the butter fly  
So spread your wings and go, it's better not to know  
What I'm gonna miss, I'll remember your kiss when I turn my head and say  
  
We could be perfect strangers, let's spend tonight  
We could be perfect strangers, hello, won't you look in my eyes?  
Don't let this bad world change you  
You got places to go, so much further than I can see  
  
We could be perfect strangers  
Thank you for spending one night with me  
  
We are passing trains, we are whiplash lovers  
We are burning wires melting all over each other  
  
We could be perfect strangers, let's spend tonight  
We could be perfect strangers, hello, won't you look in my eyes?  
Don't let this bad world change you  
You got places to go, so much further than I can see  
  
Everyone wants you but nobody knows that you're so alone inside  
We could be perfect strangers  
Thank you for spending one night
