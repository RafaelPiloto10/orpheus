Couple in the next rooms bound to win a prize  
Cause they've been going at it all night long  
And I'm trying to get some sleep  
But these motel walls are cheap  
And lincoln duncan is my name  
And heres my song  
And heres my song  
  
My father was a fisherman my mom a fishermans friend  
And I was born in the boredom and the chowder  
When I reached my prime  
I left my home in the maritimes  
And I, I headed down the turnpike  
For new england  
Sweet new england  
  
Had holes in my confidence  
And holes in the knees of my jeans  
And I was left without a penny in my pocket  
And ew-whee I was desitute as a girl could be  
And I wished I wore a ring so I could hock it  
Id surely hock it  
  
I met a young girl in the parking lot  
She was preaching to the crowd  
By singing sacred songs and reading from the bible  
Well I told her I was lost  
And she told me all about the penticost  
And I seen that girl as a road to my survival  
  
Later on the very same night  
She crept to my tent with a flashlight  
And these long years of innocence ended  
Took me to the woods  
I said her comes something that feels so good  
And just like a dog I was befriended  
I was befriended  
  
I said what a night  
What a garden of delight  
Even now that sweet memory lingers  
I was lying under the stars just playing my guitar  
But I was thanking the lord for my fingers  
For my fingers  
  
I know I know I know I know  
I know I know
