I was thrilled to death, the day that Babe Ruth signed my baseball bat  
I always remember that, the greatest one of all  
When I was out in Hollywood, John Wayne tipped his cowboy hat  
And when I got his autograph, I felt ten feet tall  
I met the great Hank Williams one night, backstage at the Opy House  
He look down and grinned when I said, "I'm your biggest fan"  
And I was there the day when J.F.K. rode into Dallas  
I walked up to the limousine and shook his mighty hand  
I've met the famous and I've met the best  
But there one man I've never met that outshines all the rest  
And He's one man I always wanted to meet  
He is the King of Kings and He's the Prince of peace  
If I ever get the chance I'll fall down at His feet  
He's one man I always wanted to meet  
Jesus is the man I always wanted to meet
