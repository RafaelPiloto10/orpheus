I'm missing you  
Girl even though you're right here by my side  
Cause lately it seems  
The distance between us is growing too wide  
  
I'm so afraid that you're saying it's over  
The last thing that I wanna hear  
  
But if your heart's not in it for real  
Please don't try to fake what you don't feel  
If love's already gone  
It's not fair to lead me on  
Cause I would give the whole world for you  
Anything you ask of me I'd do  
But I won't ask you to stay  
I'd rather walk away  
If your heart's not in it  
  
You say that you love me  
But baby sometimes  
You're just saying the words  
If you've got somethin' to tell me  
Don't keep it inside  
Let it be heard  
  
I'm so afraid that you're saying it's over  
Girl I'll make it easy for you  
  
But if your heart's not in it for real  
Please don't try to fake what you don't feel  
If love's already gone  
It's not fair to lead me on  
Cause I would give the whole world for you  
Anything you ask of me I'd do  
But I won't ask you to stay  
I'd rather walk away  
If your heart's not in it  
  
How I wish I could take us back in time  
But it's gone too far now we can't rewind (And there's nothing that I can do  
To stop me losin' you)  
I can't make you change your mind (If your heart's not in it)  
  
But if your heart's not in it for real  
Please don't try to fake what you don't feel  
If love's already gone  
It's not fair to lead me on  
Cause I would give the whole world for you  
Anything you ask of me I'd do  
But I won't ask you to stay  
I'd rather walk away  
If your heart's not in it
