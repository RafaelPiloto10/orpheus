Well how much blues do you use  
Before you use it up  
And how many fools take a chance  
Before they hit it lucky  
Tomorrow's want to be the day  
It never seem to work that way  
  
[Chorus]  
What's up with that  
What's up with that  
What's up with that  
What's up with that  
  
Everybody want a little more  
Than they think they got  
But what you might think it is,  
Might really not be, baby  
Pick it up or leave it lay  
It always seem to slip away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now how high will a river get  
Before it overflows  
And how long is the hole to China  
It don't really know  
This is what it's all about  
There's always gonna be a doubt  
  
[Chorus]
