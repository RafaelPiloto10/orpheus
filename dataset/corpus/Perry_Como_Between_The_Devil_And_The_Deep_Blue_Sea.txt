I don't want you  
But I hate to lose you  
You got me in between  
The devil and the deep blue sea!  
  
I forgive you  
'Cause I can't forget you  
You got me in between  
The devil and the deep blue sea!  
  
I ought to cross you off my list  
But when you come a knockin' at my door  
Fate seems to give my heart a twist  
And I keep runnin' back for more!  
  
I should hate you  
But I guess I love you  
You got me in between  
The devil and the deep blue sea!  
  
You got me in between  
The devil and the deep blue sea!  
Hmm, you got me in between  
The devil and the deep blue sea!  
  
I ought to cross you off my list  
But when you come a knockin' at my door  
Fate seems to give my heart a twist  
And I keep runnin' back for more!  
  
Hmm, I should hate you  
But I guess I love you  
You got me in between  
The devil and the deep blue sea!  
  
You got me in between  
The devil...and the deep blue sea!...and the deep blue sea!
