Clean shirt, new shoes  
And I don't know where I am goin' to.  
Silk suit, black tie,  
I don't need a reason why.  
They come runnin' just as fast as they can  
Cause every girl crazy 'bout a sharp dressed man.  
  
Gold watch, diamond ring,  
I ain't missin' not a single thing.  
And cufflinks, stick pin,  
When I step out I'm gonna do you in.  
They come runnin' just as fast as they can  
'Cause every girl crazy 'bout a sharp dressed man.  
  
Top coat, top hat,  
And I don't worry coz my wallet's fat.  
Black shades, white gloves,  
Lookin' sharp lookin' for love.  
They come runnin' just as fast as they can  
'Cause every girl crazy 'bout a sharp dressed man.
