Stepping on the greens, in her designer jeans  
She's a disco miniature golfing queen  
Wearing plaid and sequins, she can make a scene  
She's a disco miniature golfing queen  
Like a picture from a disco golf magazine  
With her putter she's a hole in one machine  
She can dance and sing, and really shake her thing  
She's a disco miniature golfing queen  
She's a disco miniature golfing queen
