Go go go  
Go go go  
  
Let me tell you what you're doing wrong  
Been so far for years, well it's much too long  
There just has to be another way  
It will get you by going day to day  
If you need another point of view  
Take a look at mine, I got something new  
I got something new  
  
It's for you  
I hate you  
These things can quite endear you  
I call you  
I adore you  
Won't let the world ignore you  
Go go go  
  
I'm the one you want  
I'm the one you need  
Never let me go  
Never let me go  
[X4]  
  
Go go go  
  
There's a mirror standing over there  
Tell me what you see, take a cold hard step  
Save the people standing in the frame  
Tell me like our [?]  
You should try another point of view  
Take a look at mine, but it's up to you  
But it's up to you  
  
It's for you  
Just for you  
From one who must adore you  
In love fallen  
I'm someone who just can't let it go  
Go go  
  
I'm the one you want  
I'm the one you need  
Never let me go  
Never let me go  
[X4]  
  
Never let me go  
Never let me go  
  
It's for you  
I swear to  
Put no one else before you  
True somehow beside now  
We just can't let it go  
  
I'm the one you want  
I'm the one you need  
Never let me go  
Never let me go  
[X4]  
  
Go go go  
Go go go  
Go go go
