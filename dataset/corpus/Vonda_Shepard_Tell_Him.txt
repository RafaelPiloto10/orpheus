I know something about love  
You've gotta want it bad  
If that guy's got into your blood  
Go out and get him  
  
If you want him to be the very part of you  
That makes you want to breathe  
Here's the thing to do  
Tell him that you're never gonna leave him  
  
Tell him that you're always gonna love him  
Tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him right now  
I know something about love  
You gotta show him it and make him  
  
See that moon up above  
Reach out and get it  
If you want him to  
Make your heart sing out  
  
And if you want him to  
Only think of you  
Tell him that you're never gonna leave him  
Tell him that you're always gonna love him  
  
Tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him right now  
Ever since the world began it's been that way  
For woman and man were created  
To make love their destiny  
  
Then why should true love be so complicated? Oh  
I know something about love  
You gotta take it and  
Show him what the world is made of  
  
One kiss will prove it  
If you want him to be  
Always by your side  
Take his hand tonight  
  
Swallow your foolish pride and  
Tell him that you're never gonna leave him  
Tell him that you're always gonna love him  
Tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him right now  
  
Tell him that you're never gonna leave him  
Tell him that you're always gonna love him  
Tell him, tell him, tell him, tell him right now
