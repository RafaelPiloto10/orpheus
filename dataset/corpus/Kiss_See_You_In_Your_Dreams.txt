The party's over, and baby's in the corner  
She's all alone for the night  
You pick up the phone, you want to go home  
Well dry your eyes, it's alright, it's alright  
See you, feel you in your dreams tonight  
See you, feel you in your dreams tonight, dreams tonight  
  
When you're in the room, you're home too soon  
You can't get me out of your mind  
And you get in bed, you cover your head  
My letter to you is signed  
And this is what I'm sayin'  
  
See you, feel you in your dreams tonight  
See you, feel you in your dreams tonight, dreams tonight  
  
See you, see you, feel you in your dreams tonight, dreams tonight  
See you, see you, feel you in your dreams tonight, dreams tonight  
See you, see you, feel you in your dreams tonight, dreams tonight  
See you, see you, feel you in your dreams tonight, dreams tonight  
See you, see you, feel you in your dreams tonight  
See you, see you, feel you in your dreams tonight, dreams tonight  
See you, see you, feel you in your dreams tonight  
See you, see you, feel you in your dreams tonight, dreams tonight  
See you, see you, feel you in your dreams tonight  
See you, see you, feel you in your dreams tonight, dreams tonight
