[Verse 1]  
It goes and it's golden like sands of time  
I hope and I hope you'll still be fine  
I know that it's bright, look through the light and see, it's meant to be  
I know that it's bright, look through the light and see, it's meant to be  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Every single jigsaw piece  
Seems to be you complete  
  
[Chorus]  
The choices we make change the path that we take  
But I know  
That somewhere out there there's a path that we chose  
There's a life that we share, there's a love and it grows  
  
[Verse 2]  
It goes and it's golden like sands of time  
I hope and I hope you'll still be fine  
I know that it's bright  
Look through the light and see, it's meant to be  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Every single jigsaw piece  
  
[Chorus]  
The choices we make change the path that we take  
But I know  
That somewhere out there there's a path that we chose  
There's a life that we share, there's a love and it grows  
  
[Bridge]  
Cause it grows and it grows  
And I hope that you know  
Cause it grows and it grows  
I know that it's bright, look through the light and see  
  
[Chorus]  
The choices we make change the path that we take  
But I know  
That somewhere out there there's a path that we chose  
There's a life that we share, there's a love and it grows
