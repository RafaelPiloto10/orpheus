Crying,  
Crying never did nobody no good  
No how, no how  
That's why I,  
  
I don't cry  
That's why I,  
I don't cry  
Laughing,  
  
Laughing sometimes does  
Somebody some good  
Somehow, somehow  
That's why I  
  
I'm laughing now  
That's why I  
I'm laughing now  
Loving,  
  
Loving never did me no good  
No how, no how  
That's why I  
Can love you now  
  
That's why I  
Can love you now  
Lying,  
Lying never did nobody no good  
  
No how, no how  
So why am I  
Lying now  
So why am I  
Lying now
