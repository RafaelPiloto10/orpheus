The table's set ant the turkey's out  
Christmas is here, let out a shout  
The family's gathered all about  
Christmas, Christmas is here!  
Everyone is wearing big smiles  
They all try to act nice for a while  
Then George calls his in-laws vile  
Christmas, Christmas is here!  
Always at one time of the year  
When everyone's problems disappear  
And everyone smiles from ear to ear  
Christmas, Christmas is here!  
George has been drinking a lot  
He just can't keep out of the sauce  
He says his wife's been screwing her boss  
Christmas, Christmas is here!  
Margaret throws her food in his face  
People are hungry, it's really a waste  
Then she screams, "How does that taste?"  
Christmas, Christmas is here!  
Always at one time of the year  
When everyone's problems disappear  
And everyone smiles from ear to ear  
Christmas, Christmas is here!  
George picks up the carving knife  
Weilds it around and starts to slice  
Henry cocks his shotgun twice  
Christmas, Christmas is here!  
Henry says, "Hey, what's the deal?  
Just sit down and finish your meal  
Or I'll pump you full of steel!"  
Christmas, Christmas is here!  
Always at one time of the year  
When everyone's problems disappear  
And everyone smiles from ear to ear  
Christmas, Christmas is here!  
Police arrive just after eight  
Responding to a noise complaint  
Open the door, what a grisly fate  
Christmas, Christmas is here!  
Fa la la and deck the halls  
Blood was spattered on the walls  
Merry Christmas, one and all!  
Christmas, Christmas is here!  
Always at one time of the year  
When everyone's problems disappear  
And everyone smiles from ear to ear  
Christmas, Christmas is here!  
Always at one time of the year  
When everyone's problems disappear  
And everyone smiles from ear to ear  
Christmas, Christmas is here!
