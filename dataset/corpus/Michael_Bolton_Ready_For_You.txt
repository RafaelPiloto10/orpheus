Yeah yeah  
Maybe I'm a fool but being foolish gets me closer  
Everything I do is doing anything to hold you  
My heart is on the edge it's true  
But I'll walk out on the ledge for you  
  
Love can be amaze but so amazing when you find it  
Bound to make you crazy til you find yourself inside it  
It's too late now I'm in too deep  
Exactly where I want to be  
  
Cause I'm ready for you  
I'm ready for love  
Willing to take the chance  
And I'm breaking my rules  
So open your heart  
And tell me you'll take my hand  
  
I'm ready for ya  
Ready for you  
I'm ready for ya  
Ready for you  
  
Any kind of fool could see the stars are all aligning  
Baby in your eyes is where I see my future shining  
It's you that I've been waiting for  
Forever I'll be at your door  
  
Cause I'm ready for you  
I'm ready for love  
Willing to take the chance  
And I'm breaking my rules  
So open your heart  
And tell me you'll take my hand  
  
I'm ready for ya  
Ready for you  
I'm ready for ya  
Ready for you  
  
I'm ready to be a part of something stronger than I am  
Gonna give it all gonna risk it all gonna lay it on the line  
It's time to bet my heart on something I'll never understand  
Gonna give it all gonna risk it all  
I surrender to you  
  
Cause I'm ready for you ready for you  
Ready for love  
I'm ready  
C'mon baby take my hand
