Amos Moses was a Cajun.  
And lived by himself in the swamp  
Hunting alligator for a living.  
Knock 'em on the head with a stump  
The Louisiana law's gonna get you, Amos  
It ain't legal hunting alligator down in the swamp, boy  
  
Now everybody blamed his old man  
for raising him mean as a snake  
When Amos Moses was a boy,  
his Daddy would use him as alligator bait  
Tie a rope around his waist,  
throw him in the swamp  
Alligator bait on the Louisiana bayou  
  
Just about 45 minutes  
southeast of Tipidow, Louisiana  
There lived a man called Duck Bill Sam  
and his pretty wife Hannah  
They raised up a son that could  
eat up his weight in groceries  
Named him after a man of the cloth.  
They called him Amos Moses  
  
Now folks in South Louisiana  
said Amos was a helluva man  
He could trap the biggest, meanest alligator.  
He only had to use one hand  
That's all he got left  
'cause the alligator bit him. Ha ha!  
Left arm gone clean up to the elbow  
  
Just about 45 minutes

They called him Amos Moses  
  
Here comes Amos  
And you should have seen his pretty wife, Hannah  
  
Well, the Sheriff got wind that  
Amos was in the swamp hunting alligator skin  
So he hid in the swamp, I'm gonna get you boy.  
He never did come out again.  
  
Well, I wonder where the Louisiana Sheriff went to?  
Sure can get lost in the Louisiana bayou (3X)
