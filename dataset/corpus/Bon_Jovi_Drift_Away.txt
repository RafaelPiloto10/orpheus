Day after day I get more confused  
Trying to see the light  
In the morning rain  
Going on a game  
You have to lose  
'Cause the feeling's changed  
I won't lose again  
  
CHORUS 1  
Giving the people  
As I pray my soul  
I wanna get lost in rock'n'roll  
And drift away  
  
Sometimes I think  
I've always been down  
I don't understand the things I see  
The world outside seems so unkind  
So unkind  
But I'm dependin' on you to let it  
See me through  
  
REPEAT CHORUS 1
