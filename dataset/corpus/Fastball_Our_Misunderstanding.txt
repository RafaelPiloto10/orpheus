Rip out the trees and plant your flag  
Now I know just where you stand  
Nature means nothing to you  
Something that you can't control  
And we make ourselves miserable  
Trying to fill the hole  
  
It's sad that our misunderstanding  
Has turned into a war  
I don't know you anymore  
  
How was I supposed to know  
I was steppin' on your toes  
The momentum builds to a fever pitch  
Talkin' but I just can't hear  
Watchin' our problems multiply  
Wishin' they would disappear  
  
It's sad that our misunderstanding  
Has turned into a war  
I don't know you anymore, anymore  
And our love got lost in the translation  
And when I see you out  
You're a stranger to me now  
You're a stranger to me now  
  
I, I wish I could talk to you  
I wish I could make you see  
How much I care  
How much you mean to me  
  
That our misunderstanding  
Has turned into a war  
I don't know you anymore, anymore  
And our love got lost in the translation  
And when I see you out  
You're a stranger to me now  
You're a stranger to me now
