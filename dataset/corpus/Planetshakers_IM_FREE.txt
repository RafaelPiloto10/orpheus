VERSE  
Joy, there' a joy in my soul  
I can't explain it but I know, its You  
Light, Oh I'm feeling so light  
Like a weight has been lifted, by You  
  
Jesus You are my breakthrough, it's You  
  
CHORUS  
Now I'm free, Yeah  
There is nothing holding me  
I'm free, yeah  
'cause You died and rose for me  
  
Now Im Free!!  
  
VERSE  
Peace, there's a peace in my heart  
There's a power that's with me, it's You  
  
BRIDGE  
No weapon formed against me, will overcome  
The enemy's defeated, Jesus has won
