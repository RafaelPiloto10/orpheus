When I hear voice over the radio  
From a world away, so sweet  
Singing up to me, I know it's a lullaby  
And I'm tangled in thoughts of you  
And I'm all alone, till you come back home  
Why don't you come back home?  
  
You got me  
You got me good  
You got me  
You got me good, good, good  
  
And when I see the curve of the earth in your willow eyes  
I'm a rocketeer, coming home after years at the speed of light  
Suddenly you're there, like a pearl in the palm of the universe  
Your unlikely skies filling up my eyes  
You come as some surprise,  
  
You got me  
You got me good  
You got me  
You got me good, good, good  
You got me good  
  
I was nailed shut like a shack on the edge of town  
You were broken down  
'Til you came around  
  
You got me  
You got me  
You got me  
You got me good  
You got me  
You got me  
You got me  
You got me good  
You got me good  
You got me good  
You got me good
