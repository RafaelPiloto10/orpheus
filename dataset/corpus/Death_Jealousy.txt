What do you want from me,  
what is it you expect  
I have spoken my mind from deep inside my soul  
Behind the eyes is a place on one will be able to touch  
Containing thoughts that cannot be taken away or replaced  
You want what is not yours, Jealousy  
You want what you cannot have, Jealousy  
Spiteful harsh words, it comes as no real surprise.  
Tell me what you are.  
  
I cannot understand how you seem to exist  
On what people create for you, good must turn bad.  
Behind the eyes is a place on one will be able to touch  
Containing thoughts that cannot be taken away or replaced  
You want what is not yours, Jealousy  
You want what you cannot have, Jealousy
