Is it me or does it seem  
That life just carries on?  
Now was it him who said  
That life is just a song?  
Now I don't know what will  
Keep me on this little Earth  
I just might use the love  
That's all in the dirt  
  
But every damn time  
That I see you  
I say to myself  
She ain't worth it  
She ain't worth nothing I got  
Ah no no  
Nah nah  
  
Was it you who said  
That my life is over?  
Baby it was over from the very start  
And did you say that I won't be  
Around downtown tomorrow?  
Ah yes I will with a hardened heart  
  
But every damn time  
That I see you  
I say to myself  
She ain't worth it  
She ain't worth nothing I got  
Ah no way  
Na uh  
  
She can have anything she wants  
But she really doesn't know  
About the way she taunts  
It's tearing me apart,  
It's tearing me apart  
Get Away, get up, and get away
