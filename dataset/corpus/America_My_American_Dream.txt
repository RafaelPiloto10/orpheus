Found on Heard.  
  
I always thought that I wanted a long, new, shiny Cadillac  
That a real man wears five hundred dollar suits upon his back  
I always thought that I needed a big, old house with a million dollar view  
But baby, since we fell in love, all I needed is you  
  
Waking up (waking up) to my American dream  
She's a long haired, blue eyed, country girl  
She's better than a fantasy  
Waking up (waking up) to my American dream  
And I would not trade the whole wide world  
For what she means to me  
  
She's pretty as the moonlight on the gulf of Mexico  
And her heart is pure and true as any California gold  
I put her on a pedastel like Lady Liberty  
Know there is no finer girl from sea to shining sea  
  
I'm waking up (waking up) to my American dream  
She's a long haired, blue eyed, country girl  
She's better than a fantasy  
Waking up (waking up) to my American dream  
And I would not trade the whole wide world  
For what she means to me  
  
Waking up (waking up) to my American dream  
She's a real live, blue eyed, country girl  
The best thing I've ever seen  
And I would not trade the whole wide world  
For what she means to me  
I'm waking up (waking up) to my American dream  
I'm waking up (I'm waking up) to my American dream
