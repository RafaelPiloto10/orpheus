Don't let us bug ya  
Ooh, stop shakin' boy  
Unless you want to shake with us  
Relax, you ain't breakfast  
  
Don't let us bug ya  
We just be having fun  
Don't let us bug ya  
We won't eat anyone  
  
You may think that you've ridden the bus  
And been all around the world  
I bet you never seen folks like us  
We're enough to make your bald hair curl, man  
Enough to make your bald hair curl  
So...  
  
Don't let us bug ya  
Don't let us bug ya  
  
Don't let us bug ya  
Don't mean to wig you out  
Don't let us bug ya  
Your hair's blown off, no doubt  
  
You may think that there's nothing new  
For any little boy or girl  
What you see is we're the true  
We're enough to make your bald hair curl, man  
Enough to make your bald hair curl  
So...  
  
Don't let us bug ya  
Don't let us bug ya  
Enough to make your bald hair curl, man  
Enough to make your bald hair curl  
  
Don't let us bug ya  
You see we're cool enough  
Don't let us bug ya  
Just because we got these feelers and stuff  
  
Sure that you heard about "The Ugly Bug Ball"  
As sung by Uncle Burl  
Rub your eyes with the real thing  
We're enough to make your bald hair curl, man  
Enough to make your bald hair curl  
So...  
  
Don't let us bug ya  
Enough to make your bald hair curl, man  
Don't let us bug ya  
Enough to make your bald hair curl  
  
Just relax, we're not gonna eat you, boy...
