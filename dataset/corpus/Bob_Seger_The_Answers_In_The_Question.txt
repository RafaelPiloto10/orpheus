The answer's in the question Will you be home late again Will you find the
courage When truth come closin' in When trust is almost broken Faith is hard
to find The answer's in the question Will you leave this all behind  
The heart's a lonely hunter It never quite feels safe The devil's in the
details The thrill is in the chase You rise and fall like water You try to
stay the same The only thing that's certain Is that everything will change How
will I be remembered Will my critics be unkind  
The answer's in the question You must leave this all behind
