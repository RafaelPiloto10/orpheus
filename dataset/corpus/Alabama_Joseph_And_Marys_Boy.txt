Out here is the country there's magic in the air.  
It's the middle of December there's excitement eveywhere  
  
Everyone's invited, the celebration's planned  
The gift is just what's in your heart and not what's in your hand  
  
[Chorus]  
Who's the one we need to thanks  
Who's the party for  
Who's the one responsible for all this peace and joy  
Who deserves the credit for the blessings we enjoy  
Preacher said last Sunday it was Joseph and Mary's boy  
  
There were times we didn't think we'd make it through the year  
The bankers tried to take our farms but somehow we're still here  
  
I don't know how the crops survived the drought and then the rain  
It must have been a miracle how else could you explain  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The Christ Child born in Bethlehem  
He was Joseph and Mary's boy
