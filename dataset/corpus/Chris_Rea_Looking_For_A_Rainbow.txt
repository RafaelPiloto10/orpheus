Well we come down to the valley  
Yea we're looking for the honey  
I see a rainbow  
I say that's the land of milk and honey  
  
Me and my cousin  
Me and my brother  
My little sister too  
Come looking for a rainbow  
Yea we're looking for a rainbow  
  
Well we come down to the valley  
Got our babies in our arms  
Yea we're Maggie's little children  
And we're looking for Maggie's farm  
  
Me and my cousin  
Me and my brother  
My little sister too  
Come looking for a rainbow  
Yea we're looking for a rainbow  
  
Well we come down to the valley  
We ain't far away no more  
You can't leave us dying this time  
'cause we're all around your door  
  
Me and my cousin  
Me and my brother  
My little sister too  
Come looking for a rainbow  
Yea we're looking for a rainbow
