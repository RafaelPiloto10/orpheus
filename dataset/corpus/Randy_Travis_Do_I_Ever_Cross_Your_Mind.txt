Oh, sometimes I go walking through fields where we walked  
Long ago in the sweet used to be  
And the flowers still grow, but they don't smell as sweet  
As they did when you picked them for me  
  
And when I think of you and the love we once knew  
How I wish we could go back in time  
Do you ever think back on old memories like that  
Or do I ever cross your mind  
  
Oh, how often I wish that again I could kiss  
Your sweet lips like I did long ago  
And how often I long for those two loving arms  
That once held me so gentle and close  
  
And when I think of you and the love we once knew  
How I wish we could go back in time  
Do you ever recall these old memories at all  
Or do I ever cross your mind  
  
When old memories appear my eyes wont stay clear  
When I think of those happier times  
Do you ever recall these old memories at all  
Or do I ever cross your mind  
  
Do you ever think back on old memories like that  
Or do I ever cross your mind
