Just a little bit west of old Pasadena  
Is the place I go, I call it home for me  
Call it what you will, Tinseltown for real  
It''s the open edge where the debutantes run free  
  
Hollywood, California, Rocktown USA  
Cruising down the stirp is where I''ll be  
At the Rainbow bar and grill  
I''ll drink till I get my fill  
The home of the movie stars is where you''ll find me  
  
Gimme gimme home on Sunset  
Desolation Boulevard I ride  
Gimme gimme home on Sunset  
It''s paradise on the faultline tonight  
  
Everybody''s lost in the land of Disney  
Ecstacy and Sister Misery  
Save your soul boy, but not to the stars  
Ha ha ha  
  
It''s the land of the twenty four hour party  
And my fist firmly wrapped around a fifth of Bacardi  
On the Sunset Strip''s where the orphans play tonight  
  
So if you wanna get really rude  
Jus come on down and we''ll get crude  
Cause there ain''t no place like here  
Baby I mean nowhere  
Cause in here''s the land of sun and sin  
All the freaks here gonna let you in  
The shooting stars and the poseurs are gonna be there  
  
Gimme gimme home on Sunset  
Desolation Boulevard I ride  
Gimme gimme home on Sunset  
It''s paradise on the faultline tonight
