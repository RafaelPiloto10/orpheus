Waiting at the station  
Tears filling up my eyes  
Sometimes the pain you hide  
Burns like a fire inside  
Look out my window  
Sometimes it's hard to see  
The things you want in life  
Come and go so easily  
  
She took the last train out of my heart oh, oh  
She took the last train  
And now I think I'll make a brand new start  
She took the last train out of my heart  
  
Watching the days go by  
Thinking 'bout the plans we made  
The days turn into years  
Funny how they fade away  
Sometimes I think of those days  
Sometimes I just hide away  
Waiting on that 9:20 train  
Waiting on a memory  
  
She took the last train out of my heart oh, oh  
She took the last train  
And now I think I'll make a brand new start  
She took the last train out of my heart  
  
My lady's on the fly and she's never coming back  
My love is like a steam train rolling down the tracks yea, yea  
  
She took the last train out of my heart oh oh  
She took the last train  
And now I think I'll make a brand new start  
She took the last train out of my heart  
  
She took the last train oh, out of my heart  
She took the last train  
And now I think I'll make a new start  
Last train out of my heart
