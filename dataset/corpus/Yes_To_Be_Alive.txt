Not a lot is missing, every ounce of treasure found  
And I believe that everyone should get what they're allowed  
Suspected of belief that comes suspended  
In a sound and everybody wants some  
  
It's the sound they make in heaven, it's a sound for here on earth  
I've heard it in the whispering of the wonders that we search  
We've waited far too long to hear the healing of the stars  
'N' everybody wants some  
  
Everybody wants some  
Everybody wants some  
Everybody wants some  
Everybody wants some  
To feel alive  
  
Oh, does it get much better than this  
Oh, does it get much better, much better  
Oh, does it get much better than this, than this  
  
There's the sound that keeps you trying  
There's the sound that makes you smile  
There's a sound in every corner  
Of the world that we survive  
  
Your temple is the harmony, you feel the sacred ground  
Just wishing for the secret to appear within the sound  
Watching for the morning star, the rhythm of the sun  
I hear it in my waking dreams, the singing has begun  
  
The passion that we walk upon  
The passion that we bring  
Is written for the mountains  
They love to hear us sing  
  
Everybody wants some  
Everybody wants some  
Everybody wants some  
Everybody wants some  
To feel alive  
  
Oh, doesn't get much better than this  
Oh, doesn't get much better than this, than this  
  
Who made me make believe  
I'm alive I'm living  
Never underestimate  
The signals coming to you  
  
Oh, the sounding of the earth  
It shakes you, yes, it shakes you  
Oh, the sounding of the earth  
It shakes you, let it shake you  
Hep yadda
