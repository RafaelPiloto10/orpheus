Maybe the years have told you  
Do you remember when life was just a new day?  
You know the story don't you?  
The one they told you when life was slipping away  
  
Aah! Look at the brand new day  
Sitting here upon the milky way  
Aah! Look at the dancing girls  
Sitting holding hands across the world  
  
You got a brand new lady  
Just like the one you left down in some other place  
Reading all the letters  
Saw your face coming through on the ouija board  
  
Aah! Look at the brand new day  
Sitting here upon the milky way  
Aah! Look at the dancing girls  
Sitting holding hands across the world  
  
You heard the words of aaron  
He spoke the truth in these things both great and small  
  
You can throw away the ashes  
You sweep them over the world on your own accord  
Did you know the real answer?  
Youd see the kind of mistakes that you can't afford
