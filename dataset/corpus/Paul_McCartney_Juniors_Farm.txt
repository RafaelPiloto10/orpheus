You should have seen me with the pokerman  
I had no money and I bet a grand  
Just in the nick of time I look at his hand  
I was talking to an Eskimo  
Said he was hoping for a fall of snow  
When you popped a sealion ready to go.  
  
Let's go let's go let go let go  
Down to junior's farm  
Where I want to lay low  
How life high life  
Let's go let's go take me to the junior's farm.  
  
At the houses of parliament  
Ev'rybody's talking 'bout president  
We all chip in for a bag of cement  
Should have had more sense  
He bought a gee gee and it jumped a fence  
All for the sake of a couple of pence.  
  
Let's go, let's go, let go, let go...  
  
Let's go let's go down to Junior's farm  
Take me down to Junior's farm  
Ev'rybody tag along  
  
I took my bag into a grocer's store  
The price is higher than the time before  
Old man asked me why is it more  
I said you should have seen me with the pokerman  
I had no money and I bet a grand  
Just in the nick of time I looked at his hand.  
  
Let's go, let's go, let go, let go...
