Big Snoop Dogg  
Can you be my doctor?  
Can you fix me up?  
Can you wipe me down?  
So I can make you give it up give it up  
Until you say my name  
Like a Jersey Jersey shuttin' down the game  
Be my head coach  
So you can...  
And never take me out  
Till you can taste the way  
Do it again, and again till you say my name  
And by the way  
I'm so glad  
I just wanna make you sweat  
I wanna make you sweat  
I just wanna make you sweat  
I wanna make you sweat  
Sweat, sweat  
Drip drip drip for me mommy can you drip drip drip  
Drip drip drip for me mommy can you drip drip drip  
She's hot on a rainy day  
Don't drown  
Call call me up, I I I can save you now  
(Lick your feet and kiss your lap)?  
[?]  
There's only one way we can stop the drought  
Come with me  
We can take a trip down south  
I can tell she's thirsty  
I'm in the whoa like a birdy  
Whatcha wanna do tonight?  
It's still early  
Wanna get some tonight  
She's all sturdy  
I'm in I'm in  
Like a cigarette  
She wanna quit  
I just wanna make you sweat  
I wanna make you sweat  
I just wanna make you sweat  
I wanna make you sweat  
Sweat, sweat  
Drip drip drip for me mommy can you drip drip drip  
Drip drip drip for me mommy can you drip drip drip  
Can you, can you get me up like I'm late for my first class  
So I can give it to you rough like a first draft  
Hold you like a paper plane  
You know I got paper babe  
Them dollar bills  
Girl I'll make it rain  
Holiday Inn  
Come and meet me on my eighth floor  
D--n it feels good but I feel bad for (them next door)?  
And I, I I I up on the [?]  
When I slip slip slip like two girls into slip n' slide  
(There's a flood in your heart love)?  
Girl, let me pop up in your hot tub  
Every night every day,  
Sippin' on a different drink  
Different chicks, different tastes  
I do it different ways  
Where you goin?  
Whatcha say?  
I'm why her river flowin'  
To another lake  
By to ocean by the ocean  
On the beach on the beach  
I'm bout' to take a swim  
Let me dip my feet in and make you sweat  
I wanna make you sweat  
I just wanna make you sweat  
I wanna make you sweat  
Sweat, sweat  
Drip drip drip for me mommy can you drip drip drip  
Drip drip drip for me mommy can you drip drip drip
