If you see the light on in the window of my room  
I'll be looking out though the shades are drawn  
If you should hear someone quietly calling out for your hair  
Don't be alarmed it might just be me  
  
Take me with you, take me there  
I'll go with you anywhere  
Show me all the things you know  
Are you with me, are you there  
I'll be with you everywhere  
Show me all the things you know, you know, you know, you know  
  
The sun always seems to shine on the other side of the mountain  
The water is clearer on the other side of the hill  
All that water comes to me, ooh as I lay down  
Where I am is where I should be  
  
Take me with you, take me there  
I'll go with you anywhere  
Show me all the things you know - oh  
Are you with me, are you there  
I'll be with you everywhere  
Show me all the things you know  
  
I'm holding them close to me  
All those things I learned  
But there's no questions and answers  
So we watch the candle burn, on and on  
  
So the candle burns all night, burns so bright until morning  
When I wake I find myself alone  
So if you see me - are you here? - hear someone cry, calling out  
Rescue me and take me home - take me home  
  
Take me with you, take me there  
I'll go with you anywhere  
Show me all the things you know - you know  
Take me with you, take me with you  
Take me with you, take me with you  
Show me all the things you know  
Please show me  
  
Please take me, show me  
Just take me, show me...
