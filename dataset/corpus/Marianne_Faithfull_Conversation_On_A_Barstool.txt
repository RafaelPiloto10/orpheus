I'm tired, so tired I can hardly stand,  
I can't breathe in the air in this city tonight.  
It's taken everything I had to give  
And now I just want to get out of here.  
But I won't be sorry if you won't be  
And I don't want your pity or your sympathy.  
But for forty-five dollars I can make it,  
You wait and see.  
He came from Miami to start out again.  
To leave him was easy, I did it all the time.  
He said that he loved me and he wanted a child,  
If he opened his mouth, he was telling you lies.  
But I won't be sorry if you won't be  
And I don't want your pity or your sympathy.  
But for thirty-five dollars I can make it,  
You wait and see.  
I was an actress, a girl in the Chorus  
On Broadway I danced for a Kennedy.  
They know me in London and they know me in Paris,  
I'm only talkin' 'cause you looked like you needed a friend.  
But I won't be sorry if you won't be  
And I don't want your pity or your sympathy.  
But for twenty-five dollars I'm half-way  
To Miami.
