If I should leave you  
Please try to remember the good times  
Warm days filled with sunshine  
And just a little bit of rain  
  
And if you look back  
Please try to forget all the bad times  
The lonely blue and sad times  
And just a little bit of rain  
Just a little bit of rain  
  
And if I look back  
You know I'll remember the good times  
Warm days filled with sunshine  
And just a little bit of rain  
Just a little bit of rain  
Just a little bit of rain
