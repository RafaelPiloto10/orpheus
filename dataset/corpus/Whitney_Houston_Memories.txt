I know, I cannot leave this place for the memories,  
Things like they way they knew us all over town  
We used to walk the streets together,  
We could be seen,  
  
Past shops where people knew us,  
Yeah, people knew.  
I've got to choose between tomorrow and yesterday,  
Can't stop to think about my life, here today.  
  
Memories can hang you up and haunt you,  
All your life, you know,  
Get so you cannot stay,  
And yet cannot go.  
  
Hey, I could find out where you've gone today,  
I feel so unhappy,  
Streets seem so empty now,  
I want you, I want you with me,  
  
Maybe I'll find someone to get you  
Off my mind  
Take me away from here and leave it, leave it all behind  
Oh, Memories can hang you up and haunt you  
  
All your life you know  
Get so you cannot stay and yet cannot go
