Would you think that I was crazy if I said to you  
I know a way that love  
Can make your wildest dreams come true  
All you have to do is  
  
Believe, miracles can happen  
Just imagine and believe  
Open up your hear, the journey starts  
When you believe  
  
When you've had enough  
And giving up was all but got you down  
Sure could stand a helping hand  
Get your feet back on the ground, turn your world around  
  
Just believe, miracles can happen  
Just imagine and believe  
Open up your heart, the journey starts  
When you believe  
  
When your pride is trying to tell you  
To do it by yourself  
And you're running out of answers  
And you need a little help  
  
Believe, miracles can happen  
Just imagine and believe  
Open up your heart, the journey starts  
  
Believe, miracles can happen  
Just imagine and believe  
Open up your heart, the journey starts  
When you believe, just believe
