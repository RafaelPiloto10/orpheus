Sometimes I'm James Bond  
Sometimes I'm Billy The Kid  
Sometimes I feel like Sherlock Holmes  
Sometimes I feel like Jack The Ripper  
  
'Cause I got an image out of control  
Identity crisisis  
I don't need a new face  
'Cause mine's been erased  
Identity crisisis  
  
Sometimes I'm on a case  
Sometimes I'm shooting bad dudes  
Sometimes I'm slashing the face  
Sometimes I'm looking for clues  
Sometimes I'm braking the law  
Sometimes I'm solving a crime  
I'm always fast on the draw  
I get the girls all the time  
  
'Cause I got an image out of control  
Identity crisisis  
I don't need a new face  
'Cause mine's been erased  
Identity crisisis
