You tell lies thinking I can't see  
You don't cry 'cause you're laughing at me  
I'm down (I'm really down)  
I'm down (down on the ground)  
I'm down (I'm really down)  
How can you laugh when you know I'm down  
(How can you laugh) when you know I'm down  
  
Man buys ring woman throws it away  
Same old thing happen everyday  
I'm down (I'm really down)  
I'm down (down on the ground)  
I'm down (I'm really down)  
How can you laugh when you know I'm down  
(How can you laugh) when you know I'm down  
  
We're all alone and there's nobody else  
You still moan, "Keep your hands to yourself!"  
I'm down (I'm really down)  
I'm down (down on the ground)  
I'm down (I'm really down)  
How can you laugh when you know I'm down  
(How can you laugh) when you know I'm down  
  
Don't you know that I'm down (I'm really down)  
Don't you know that I'm down (I'm really down)  
Down on the ground (I'm really down)  
Don't you know that I'm down (I'm really down)  
Down, down, down
