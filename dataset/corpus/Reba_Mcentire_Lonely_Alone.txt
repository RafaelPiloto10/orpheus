(Reese Wilson)  
  
I could stop right here turn this car around.  
Walk back through the door put my suitcase down.  
Tell you I'm sorry and things would be alright I know.  
But it all comes down to the lesser of the two.  
Alone by myself or alone with you.  
And if I have to be lonely I'd rather be lonely alone.  
  
CHORUS  
I'd rather miss someone out on this highway.  
Than someone who's sittin' just three feet away.  
And I'd rather be fightin' some old memories,  
than to wonder if you ever really love me.  
  
I could keep going on like I have all along.  
Telling myself that there's nothin' wrong.  
But if I have to be lonely I'd rather be lonely alone.  
  
Repeat CHORUS  
  
I don't know what I'll do, I don't know where I'll go.  
There's a lot I'm not sure of but  
one thing I know. If I have to be lonely,  
I'd rather be lonely alone. If I have to be lonely, I'd  
rather be lonely alone.
