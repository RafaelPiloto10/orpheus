Here's someone now whose got the muscle.  
His steady hand could move a mountain.  
Expert in bed,  
But come on now,  
There must be something missing.  
That golden one leads a double life  
You'll find out.  
Tell me,  
  
I don't know where you go  
Do you climb into space  
To the world where you live,  
To the world where you live.  
  
So here we lie against each other  
These four walls can never hold us  
We're looking for wide open spaces  
High above the kitchen  
And we're strangers here  
On our way to some other place  
  
But I don't know where you go  
Do you climb into space  
To the world where you live,  
To the world where you live.  
Oh, to the world where you live  
  
Friends come round  
You might remember and be sad  
Behind their eyes is unfamiliar  
  
Do you climb into space  
To the world where you live,  
To the world where you live.  
Oh, to the world where you live  
To the world where you live.  
To the world where you live.  
To the world where you live.  
To the world where you live.
