If the last thing I see is your face  
If the last thing I feel is your embrace  
Then I would not be afraid  
I would go to a happy grave  
If the last thing I see is you  
Should I suddenly disappear  
Or linger on for 100 years  
I would know no fear  
I would taste no bitter tears  
If the last thing I see is you  
Old heart of stone, help me forget it  
Old heart of stone,  
Do you think she meant it  
Old heart of stone,  
Somehow I've always known  
That I'd regret it  
If I could have one wish  
It would be that you remember this  
Know that I did not stray  
For you were there to guide my way  
You and your beautiful face  
If I should fall would you give chase  
Would you follow me  
Or find someone to fill my space  
And keep you company  
If the sun refused to shine  
If it called for rain till the end of time  
I would not lose faith  
I'd sail my soul to a warmer place  
For you and your beautiful face
