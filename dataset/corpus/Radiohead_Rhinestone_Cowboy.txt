I've been walking these streets so long  
singing the same old song  
I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway  
where hustle's the name of the game  
and nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain  
there's been a load of compromising  
on the road to my horizon  
but I'm gonna be where the lights are shining on me  
like a rhinestone cowboy  
riding out on a horse  
in a star spangled rodeo  
like a rhinestone cowboy  
getting cards and letters from people I don't even know  
and offers coming over the phone  
well I really don't mind the rain  
and a smile can hide all the pain  
but you're down when you're riding the train  
that's taking the long way  
and I dream of the things I'll do  
with a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe  
there'll be a load of compromising  
on the road to my horizon  
but I'm gonna be where the lights are shining on me  
like a rhinestone cowboy  
riding out on a horse in a star spangled rodeo  
rhinestone cowboy  
getting cards and letters from people I don't even know  
and offers coming over the phone  
like a rhinestone cowboy  
riding out on a horse in a star spangled rodeo  
like a rhinestone cowboy  
getting cards and letters from people I don't even know  
like a rhinestone cowboy
