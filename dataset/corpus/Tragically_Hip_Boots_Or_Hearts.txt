Well I think that there's a problem here  
Her voice just don't sound right  
Left a message on the answering machine  
Said, "I'm back in town tonight"  
I feel I've stepped out of the wilderness  
All squint-eyed and confused  
But even babies raised by wolves  
They know exactly when they've been used  
  
See when it starts to fall apart  
It really falls apart  
Like boots or hearts, oh when they start  
They really fall apart  
  
Fingers and toes, fingers and toes  
Forty things we share  
Forty-one if you include  
The fact that we don't care  
Now you've blocked off most of main street  
For your faith parade  
Everyone in town now, they probably all agree  
I'm lying in the bed I made  
  
Now you won't even let me talk to you  
We got some air to clear  
We'd probably only agree on one thing anyway  
That's what the hell is happening here?  
Finger and toes, fingers and toes  
Forty things we share  
Forty-one if you include  
The fact that we don't care
