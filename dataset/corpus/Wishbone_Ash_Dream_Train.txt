Weaving a web around my heart,  
Slowly taking my world apart.  
I can't begin to think of anything else  
Left my reason way up on a shelf.  
Stealing away without a sound,  
My feet don't hardly touch the ground.  
I look at the clock, the hands of fate,  
The train I'm riding can't be late.  
Riding on that dream train -  
One look in your eyes, and I follow through.  
Riding on that dream train -  
Been a rider since I met you.  
The brush of her skirt, the look in her eye  
No use denying the curve of her thigh.  
I got a feeling I'm out on limb  
Past committing original sin.  
Cold steel on a railroad track  
Hard heart, I ain't coming back.  
Put the border on red alert  
Heed the warning, you're gonna get hurt.
