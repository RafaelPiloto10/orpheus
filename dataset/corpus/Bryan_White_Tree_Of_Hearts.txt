On a tree inside a heart  
A dull boyscout knife  
Took half a day to carve  
Michael loves Caroline  
He just turned ten and she was nine  
  
The summer she turned sweet sixteen  
He finally found his nerve  
And took her out to see  
And what she saw through her tears  
Were seven hearts for seven years  
  
CHORUS:  
And they stood beneath the tree of hearts  
And they watch their feelings grow  
And they swore they'd never be apart  
True love left it's mark  
On the tree of hearts  
  
The tenth time he carved their names  
Caroline's dad was giving her away  
There beneath the shelter of  
The tree of hearts they pledged their love  
  
And then four hearts down the road  
They brought the first of two born home  
  
CHORUS:  
And they played beneath the tree of hearts  
And they watched their children grow  
And they swore they'd never be apart  
True love left it's mark  
On the tree of hearts  
  
BRIDGE:  
In the blinking of an eye  
Somehow fifty-seven hears flew by  
  
Fifty-eight, fifty-nine  
Sixty he missed Caroline  
At sixty-one Michael knew  
There wouldn't be a sixty-two  
  
CHORUS:  
Now they lay beneath the tree of hearts  
An you can watch their love still grow  
Where they swore they'd never be apart  
True love left it's mark  
On the tree of hearts.
