Go  
  
Wasn't I always  
A friend to you?  
Wasn't I always  
A friend to you?  
Do you wanna  
Be my friend?  
Ooh, ooh  
Do you wanna  
Be my friend?  
Ooh, ooh  
  
Every once in a while  
Honey  
Let your love show  
Every once in a while  
Honey  
Let yourself show  
Nobody gets hurt  
No, no  
Ooh, ooh  
Nobody gets hurt  
  
Well  
We came here as two  
We laid down as one  
I don't care  
If I'm not your only  
What I see in you  
You see in me  
But if I be wrong  
Smoke my smoke  
Drink my wine  
Bury  
My snakeskin boots  
Somewhere  
I'll never find  
Still be  
Your lover baby  
  
Oo, oo, oo  
  
Wasn't I always  
A friend to you?  
Wasn't I always  
A friend to you?  
Do you wanna  
Be my friend?  
Ooh ooh  
Do you wanna  
Be my friend?  
Ooh, ooh  
  
Every once in a while  
Honey  
Let yourself go  
Every once in a while  
Honey  
Let yourself show  
  
Nobody gets hurt  
No, no  
Ooh ooh  
Nobody gets hurt  
  
Well  
I could be  
An astronaut  
On the wrong side  
Of the moon  
Or wrapped up  
Like a baby  
On a bus under you  
Wherever I go  
You go with me  
But if I do you wrong  
Take the master suite  
I'll take the floor  
Sleep in late  
Get some rest  
I'll get mine  
Still be  
Your lover baby  
  
Oo, oo, oo  
  
Wasn't I always  
A friend to you?  
Wasn't I always  
A friend to you?  
  
Every once in a while  
Honey  
Let your love show  
Every once in a while  
Honey let yourself  
Go  
Nobody gets hurt  
It's only love  
Love, love  
Oo, oo, oo  
  
Wasn't I always  
A friend to you?  
Wasn't I always  
A friend to you?  
Wasn't I always  
A friend to you?  
Wasn't I always  
A friend to you?
