Desert road from Vegas to nowhere  
Somewhere better than where you've been  
A coffee machine that needs some fixing  
In a little cafe' just around the bend  
I am calling you, I know you hear me  
I am calling you  
A hot dry wind blowing right through me  
Oh, the baby's crying and I can't sleep  
But we both know that a change is coming  
Oh, coming closer, such sweet release  
And I am calling you, can you hear me  
I am calling you  
Oooh, yeah

And I am calling you, don't you hear me  
I am calling you  
I, honey, I'm calling, I'm calling, I'm calling you  
I know you hear me  
I am calling you  
Mmm, hmm
