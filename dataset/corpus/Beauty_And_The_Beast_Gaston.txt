Gaston  
  
Who does she think she is?  
That girl has tangled with the wrong man!  
  
Lefou  
  
Darn right.  
  
Gaston  
  
No one says "no" to Gaston!  
Dismissed! Rejected!  
Publicly humiliated!  
Why, it's more than I can bear.  
  
Lefou  
  
More beer?  
  
Gaston  
  
What for? Nothing helps.  
I'm disgraced.  
  
Lefou  
  
Who, you? Never!  
Gaston, you've got to pull yourself together.  
  
Lefou  
  
Gosh it disturbs me to see you, Gaston  
Looking so down in the dumps  
Ev'ry guy here'd love to be you, Gaston  
Even when taking your lumps  
There's no man in town as admired as you  
You're ev'ryone's favorite guy  
Ev'ryone's awed and inspired by you  
And it's not very hard to see why  
  
No one's slick as Gaston  
No one's quick as Gaston  
No one's neck's as incredibly thick as Gaston's  
For there's no man in town half as manly  
Perfect, a pure paragon!  
You can ask any Tom, dick or Stanley  
And they'll tell you whose team they prefer to be on  
  
Lefou and chorus  
  
No one's been like Gaston  
A king pin like Gaston  
  
Lefou  
  
No one's got a swell cleft in his chin like Gaston  
  
Gaston  
  
As a specimen, yes, I'm intimidating!  
  
Lefou and chorus  
  
My what a guy, that Gaston!  
Give five "hurrahs!" Give twelve "hip-hips!"  
  
Lefou  
  
Gaston is the best  
And the rest is all drips  
  
Chorus  
  
No one fights like Gaston  
Douses lights like Gaston  
  
Lefou  
  
In a wrestling match nobody bites like Gaston!  
  
Bimbettes  
  
For there's no one as burly and brawny  
  
Gaston  
  
As you see I've got biceps to spare  
  
Lefou  
  
Not a bit of him's scraggly or scrawny  
  
Gaston  
  
That's right!  
And ev'ry last inch of me's covered with hair  
  
Chorus  
  
No one hits like Gaston  
Matches wits like Gaston  
  
Lefou  
  
In a spitting match nobody spits like Gaston  
  
Gaston  
  
I'm especially good at expectorating!  
Ptoooie!  
  
Chorus  
  
Ten points for Gaston!  
  
Gaston  
  
When I was a lad  
I ate four dozen eggs  
Ev'ry morning to help me get large  
And now that I'm grown  
I eat five dozen eggs  
So I'm roughly the size of a barge!  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh, ahhh, wow!  
My what a guy, that Gaston!  
No one shoots like Gaston  
Makes those beauts like Gaston  
  
Lefou  
  
Then goes tromping around wearing boots like Gaston  
  
Gaston  
  
I use antlers in all of my decorating!  
  
Chorus  
  
My what a guy, Gaston!
