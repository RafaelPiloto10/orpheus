Miracle Man  
You're Miracle Man  
  
Save me from the outside  
Save me from the hurt  
Save me from this cold inside and  
Save me from myself  
  
What you see when you're looking at me  
Take me out, take me out of captivity  
Got my head, my dreams, my dead my screams  
Started up the engine of the afterlife machine  
  
I've got your head and your covenant of dreams (I've got your head)  
I've got your dead and a collection of your screams  
  
Not your ordinary bout with madness  
I'm in love with the infinite sadness  
Can you see clear to save me, save me  
From myself, save me  
  
Miracle Man  
You're Miracle Man  
  
Keep me safe and warm  
Keep me underground  
Keep me from what I deserve and  
Don't just keep me down  
  
What I want, what I need to be  
Take me out, take me out of obscurity  
Got my head, my dreams, my dead, my screams  
Gone o.d. on the afterlife machine  
  
I've got your head and your afterlife machine (I've got your head)  
I've got your dead and a collection of your screams  
  
Not your ordinary bout with madness  
I'm in love with the infinite sadness  
Can you see clear to save me, save me  
From myself, save me  
  
Just a victim of my imagination  
  
What you see when you're looking at me  
Take me out, take me out of captivity  
Got my head, my dreams, my dead my screams  
Started up the engine of the afterlife machine  
  
I've got your head  
I've got your dead  
  
Not your ordinary bout with madness  
I'm in love with the infinite sadness  
Can you see clear to save me, save me  
From myself  
  
Not your ordinary bout with madness  
I'm in love with the infinite sadness  
Can you see clear to save me, save me  
From myself  
Save me
