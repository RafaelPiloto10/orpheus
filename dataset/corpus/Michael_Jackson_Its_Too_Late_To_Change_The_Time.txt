Too Late  
Too Late  
Too Late  
In this almighty cage  
We shop through the yellow page  
Gone is the corner store  
There is a supermarket there for you  
  
But feelings remain the same  
  
And it's too late, too late to change the time  
Well it's too late, too late to change the time  
And it's too late, too late to change the time  
But it's not too late to change your mind (too late)  
  
It's a new day, a new age  
A photograph is taken, its ready one minute later  
Cars are bigger and better  
Manufacture satisfy  
Any world full of crime  
I can't let you take  
  
And it's too late, too late to change the time  
And it's too late, too late to change the time  
And it's too late, too late to change the time  
But it's not too late to change your mind (too late)  
No, no  
  
So you want to be a star  
I think you are  
You don't have to go further  
Then my loving arms  
  
And it's too late, too late to change the time  
But it's not too late (too late) to change your mind  
  
Are you sure you want to go to New York City (New York City)  
Where girls make it big if their pretty (if their pretty)  
Let say you get that penthouse view  
But whose gonna love you the way I do (just the way I do)  
  
It's too late, too late to change the time  
And it's too late, too late to change the time  
No, too late, too late to change the time  
But it's not too late (too late) to change your mind  
Yea, yea, yea  
  
And it's too late, too late to change the time  
It's too late, too late to change the time  
Ooh, too late, too late to change the time  
But it's not too late (too late) to change your mind  
Yea, yea, yea  
  
Too late, too late
