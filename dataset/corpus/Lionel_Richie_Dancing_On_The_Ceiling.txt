What is happening here  
Something's going on that's not quite clear  
Somebody turn on the lights  
We're gonna have a party  
It's starting tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
  
The room is hot and that's good  
Some of my friends came by from the neighborhood  
The people startin' a climb the walls  
Ooh it looks like everybody is having a ball  
  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
  
Come on!  
  
Everybody start to lose control  
When the music is right  
If you see somebody hangin' around  
Don't get uptight  
The only thing we want to do tonight  
Is go 'round and 'round  
And turn upside down  
Come on! Let's get down!  
  
So come on! Let's get loose  
Don't hold back  
'Cause ain't no use  
Hard to keep your feet on the ground  
'Cause when we like to party  
We only want to get down  
  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
  
Say what?  
Can't stop now  
Just getting started  
Everybody clap your hands  
Come on  
Everybody let's dance  
  
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)  
  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling baby baby  
We gonna dance all night
