Big and I'm bad  
And I want you to know  
I hand around  
Where the grass is greener  
Totally naked, baby  
Totally nude  
'Cause if I want to  
Who's gonna stop me?  
I'm absolutely free  
Living in the trees  
The birdies and the bees  
'Cause I'm a nature boy  
  
Locked up inside  
You can't tell me where it's at  
Open up, open up, open the door  
Rocks and trees and physical culture  
Some days you hide  
I guess you wonder where you are  
Nature boy, nature man, take me along  
We got a life that's undiscovered  
  
We threw it all away  
Throw it all away  
Rolling every way  
It's irresponsible  
So civilized  
I guess you wonder where you are  
Nature boy, nature man, take me along  
Deep in the woods we're undiscovered  
  
I'm a little fish and you're the river  
Living in a boat that's underwater  
We can tip, tip, tip it over  
You can push, push, make it better now  
Wake your daddy up  
It's a quarter to five  
Our little boat  
Has lost it's rudder  
Dive to the bottom  
And we never come up  
  
A polka party  
For Bob and Martha  
I'm absolutely free  
Living in the trees  
The birdies and the bees  
'Cause I'm a nature boy  
Think what you like  
This is really where it's at  
Open up, open up, open the door  
We don't need clothes and we don't need money  
So civilized  
I guess you wonder where you are  
Nature boy, nature man, take me along  
Deep in the woods we're undiscovered
