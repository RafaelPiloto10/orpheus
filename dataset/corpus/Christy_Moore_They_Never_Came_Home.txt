St. Valentine's day comes around once a year,  
All our thought turn to love as the day it draws near,  
When sweethearts and darlings, husbands and wives,  
Pledge love and devotion for the rest of their lives.  
As day turns to evening soon nighttime does fall,  
Young people preparing for the Valentine's Ball,  
As the night rings with laughter some people still  
Mourn  
The 48 children who never came home.  
  
Chorus  
  
Have we forgotten the suffering and pain  
The survivors and victims of the fire in Artane,  
The mothers and fathers forever to mourn  
The 48 children who never came home.  
  
Down to the Stardust they all made their way  
The bouncers stood back as they lined up to pay  
The records are spinning there's dancing as well  
Just how the fire started sure no one can tell.  
In a matter of seconds confusion did reign  
The room was in darkness fire exits were chained  
The firefighters wept for they could not hide,  
  
Their anger and sorrow for those left inside.  
  
Chorus  
  
All around the city the bad news it spread  
There's a fire in the Stardust there's 48 dead  
Hundreds of children are injured and maimed  
And all just because the fire exits were chained.  
Our leaders were shocked, grim statements were made  
They she'd tears in the graveyard as the bodies were  
Laid  
The victims have waited in vain for 4 years  
It seems like our leaders she'd crocodile tears.  
  
Chorus  
  
Half a million was spent on solicitor's fees,  
A fortune to the owner and his family  
It's hard to believe not one penny came  
To the working class people who suffered the pain.  
Days turn to weeks and weeks turn to years  
Our laws favour the rich or so it appears  
A woman still waits for her lads to come home  
Injustice breeds anger and that's what's been done.  
  
Chorus
