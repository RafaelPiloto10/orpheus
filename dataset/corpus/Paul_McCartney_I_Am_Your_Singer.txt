You are my love, you are my song, liger on,  
You are my song, I am your singer.  
You are my one, you are my own melody,  
You are my song, I am your singer.  
  
Someday when were singing  
We will fly away, going winging.  
  
Sing, singing my love song to you.  
  
My song is sung,  
When day is done harmonies willinger on,  
I am your singer,  
I am your singer,  
Singing my love song to you.
