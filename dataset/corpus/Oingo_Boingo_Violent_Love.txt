Baby, you look so good,  
I knew you would.  
Please, don't go away  
Darling, say it's okay...  
  
I want to make violent love  
To you by the moon above  
I want to make violent love to you  
  
I want to kiss every night  
To squeeze and hold you tight  
I want to make violent love to you  
  
I don't want seem frantic  
I don't want to cramp your style  
You're driving me into a panic  
You just want to drive me, drive me,  
Drive me, drive me wild
