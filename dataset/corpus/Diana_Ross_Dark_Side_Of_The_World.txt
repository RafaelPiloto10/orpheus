Don't leave me, don't leave me here  
On the dark side of the world  
  
My days are darker than your nights  
Since I lost you, babe  
Since I lost you, babe  
  
I'm like an ember  
Fading out of sight  
One more tear, and I know I'll disappear  
Bring back the sunshine  
That you took away  
  
'Cause I need ya  
And I want ya  
Just don't think I'm gonna make it without your love  
  
Don't you know  
Such a loneliness I've never known  
Since I lost you, babe  
Since I lost you, babe  
I'm like a woman who once knew splendor  
Now all her wealth and riches  
They are gone  
  
Bring back the sunshine  
That you took away  
'Cause I need ya  
And I want ya  
And I just don't think I'm gonna make it without your love  
  
Bring back the sunshine that you took away  
Now my future lies in back of me  
Since I lost you, babe  
Since I lost you, babe  
I walk this lonely road to eternity  
Just despair and emptiness everywhere  
  
Bring back the sunshine  
That you took away  
'Cause I need ya  
And I want ya  
I just don't think I'm gonna make it without your love  
  
Don't leave me, don't leave me here  
On the dark side of the world  
  
Oh, don't you leave me here  
On the dark side of the world  
'Cause I need ya  
Oh, you know I want ya  
Right here on the dark side of the world
