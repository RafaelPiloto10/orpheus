Blue jean baby, L.A. lady  
She was the seamstress for the band  
Pretty eyed, pirate smile  
She'll marry a music man  
Ballerina, you must have seen  
Her dancing in the sand  
And now she's in me  
Always with me, tiny dancer in my hand  
  
Jesus freaks out in the street  
Handing tickets out for God  
Turning back she just laughs  
The boulevard is not that bad  
  
Piano man he makes his stand  
In the auditorium  
Looking on she sings the songs  
The words she knows, the tune she hums  
  
But oh how it feels so real  
Lying here with no one near  
Only you and you can hear me  
When I say softly, slowly  
  
[Chorus]  
Hold me closer tiny dancer  
Count the headlights on the highway  
Lay me down in sheets of linen  
You had a busy day today  
  
Blue jean baby, L.A. lady  
Seamstress for the band  
Pretty eyed, pirate smile  
Hear she married a music man  
Ballerina, you must have  
Seen her she was dancing in the sand  
And now she's in me, always  
With me, tiny dancer in my hand  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
