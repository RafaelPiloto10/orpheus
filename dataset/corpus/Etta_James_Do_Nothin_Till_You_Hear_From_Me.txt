Do nothin' till you hear from me  
Pay no attention to what's said  
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream is over my head  
  
Do nothin' till you hear from me  
At least consider our romance  
If you should take the word of others you've heard  
Don't you know, I haven't a chance  
  
True I've been seen with somebody new  
But does that mean that I'm been untrue?  
When we're apart the words in my heart reveal how I feel about you  
  
Some kiss may cloud my memory  
And others arms may hold a thrill  
But please do nothin' till you hear from me  
And baby you never will
