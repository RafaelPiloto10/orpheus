I...like the things that you hate  
And you...hate the things that I like  
But it hurts  
Honesty's your church  
But sometimes  
It's better to lie  
I...am the vinegar and salt  
And you...are the oil that dissolves  
My frustration  
Honesty's limitation  
But sometimes  
It's better to lie  
I am the vinegar and salt  
And you are the oil that dissolves my frustrations  
Limitations  
But sometimes...  
I don't dare to ask why
