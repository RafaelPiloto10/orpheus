I would love to tour the Southland  
In a traveling minstrel show  
Yes I'd love to tour the Southland  
In a traveling minstrel show  
Yes I'm dying to be a star and make them laugh  
Sound just like a record on the phonograph  
Those days are gone forever  
Over a long time ago, oh yeah  
I have never met Napoleon  
But I plan to find the time  
I have never met Napoleon  
But I plan to find the time  
'Cause he looks so fine upon that hill  
They tell me he was lonely, he's lonely still  
Those days are gone forever  
Over a long time ago, oh yeah  
  
I stepped up on the platform  
The man gave me the news  
He said, You must be joking son  
Where did you get those shoes?  
Where did you get those shoes?  
  
Well, I've seen 'em on the TV, the movie show  
They say the times are changing but I just don't know  
These things are gone forever  
Over a long time ago, oh yeah
