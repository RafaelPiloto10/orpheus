Out my window a memory  
And I'm dyin' inside  
I know the way it should be  
Even though it was right in front of me  
It was something I just couldn't see  
  
Your lonely face  
Your lonely eyes  
But this is something you can't disguise  
It's not just me, you feel it, too  
?Cause you know I belong to you  
  
Look at where we're goin'  
Tell me, what can I say  
We're tracing our footsteps  
We're going the same way  
  
Madeline  
Here we go around again  
You know it, I know it  
Don't try to pretend  
We know it could be  
So much better than it's been  
Ahh ooo  
Here we go around again  
  
I was empty inside  
But I just didn't know  
You are my ten thousand roses  
And I let you go  
Before I make the same mistake  
Hold me in your arms  
We belong, you know it in your heart  
  
Cause look where we're going  
No doubt in my mind  
Can't you see it's meant to be  
Oh oh oh my Madeline
