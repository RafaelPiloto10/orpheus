Jessie is a friend  
Yeah, I know he's been a good friend of mine  
But lately something's changed that ain't hard to define  
Jessie's got himself a girl and I want to make her mine  
  
And she's watching him with those eyes  
And she's loving him with that body I just know it  
And he's holding her in his arms late late at night  
  
You know, I wish that I had Jessie's girl  
I wish that I had Jessie's girl  
Where can I find a woman like that  
Like Jesse's girl  
I wish that I had Jessie's girl  
Where can I find a woman  
Where can I find a woman like that  
  
And I'm looking in the mirror all the time,  
Wondering what she don't see in me  
I've been funny, I've been cool with the lines  
Ain't that the way love supposed to be  
  
Tell me, where can I find a woman like that  
Like Jesse's girl  
I wish that I had Jessie's girl  
I want Jesse's girl  
Where can I find a woman like that  
Like Jesse's girl  
I wish that I had Jessie's girl  
I want, I want Jessie's girl
