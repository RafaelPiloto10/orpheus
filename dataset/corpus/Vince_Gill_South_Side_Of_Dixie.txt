You know I'm about to lose my mind  
I got a woman down below the Mason-Dixon line  
She deals the cards awful good to me  
She's a blackjack dealer on the Delta Queen  
  
[Chorus]  
On the south side of Dixie  
From Savannah Georgia down to New Orleans  
On the south side of Dixie  
Women there they don't treat you mean  
On the south side of Dixie  
A side of the south you ain't never seen  
  
Half a tank north of Birmingham  
Red eye gravy and country ham  
Chattanooga woman sure is sweet  
She's a hillbilly singer from Tennessee  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you go down south, you're gonna have a ball  
You'll go half crazy tryin' to love 'em all  
You might get lucky, you can't never tell  
With them Georgia peaches and them southern belles  
  
[Chorus]
