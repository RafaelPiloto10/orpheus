One day I have ham and bacon  
And the next day it ain't nothing shakin'  
And it ain't noboady's business if I do what I do  
  
Me and my babe oh we fuss and fight  
And the next minute, yea everything is alright  
And it ain't nobody's business what we do  
(Cause that's all private stuff)  
  
One day I think I'm going crazy  
And the next day I'm laid back and lazy  
And it ain't nobody's business if I do  
  
One day I might take a notion  
To go right down and jump in the ocean  
And it ain't nobody's business if I do
