Come and hold me  
And dissolve me  
But I never do what I am told to  
You enthuse me  
Don't abuse me  
At the worst of times you'll never lose me  
  
There are times when I could fall in love with you  
There are times when I would scream till I was blue  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't get me wrong  
I can be strong  
When I could fall in love with you  
Don't let me down  
Take me to test  
When I could fall in love with you  
Like a child  
Like a child  
  
I was dreaming  
We were sleeping  
And you held me tight to keep believing  
Don't upset me  
I won't let you  
Fall into a space that's empty  
  
There are times when I could fall in love with you  
There are times when I would scream till I was blue  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There are times when I could fall in love with you  
There are times when I would scream till I was blue  
  
[Chorus x 2]
