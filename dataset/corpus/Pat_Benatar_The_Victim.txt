You've been set up one too many times  
The perfect victim for the perfect crime  
You left yourself wide open to the pain  
So close your eyes now  
You're out walkin' in the rain  
You've got a burning desire to be The Victim  
You're bleeding from the soul  
You're hurting from the heart  
Things you can't be told are gonna tear you apart  
  
Your choice of lovers, never very bright  
Your father worried, but even he gave up the fight  
You always think their hearts are made of gold  
And you're the savior, to coax the warmth out of the cold  
  
You've got a burning desire to be The Victim  
You're bleeding from the soul  
You're hurting from the heart  
Things you can't be told are gonna tear you apart  
Cause you're The Victim  
  
Break the pattern, you've gotta break away  
Break the pattern before it gets too late  
  
You've got a burning desire to be The Victim  
You're bleeding from the soul  
You're hurting from the heart  
Things you're never told are gonna tear you apart  
Cause you're The Victim
