I've waited so long now  
I've wanted forever to hold you  
Now you're in my arms  
And I'll never let you go  
  
Whatever you do, why'know  
I'll be standing here beside you baby  
Just like a bird that's find it's way back home  
I've finally found a place where I belong  
  
I've been looking for you since I took my first breath  
And I'll be loving you baby til I take my last  
I'd like to know  
What would I do without you in my life  
From the moment I saw you I knew  
I was looking for you  
  
Can I wake up now  
Can I believe what I'm feeling  
And I'll be sure I wasn't dreaming it all  
  
Baby it's true, you do  
Something supernatural to me  
Each night I pray to God that you'll be blessed  
I need you so much baby I confess  
  
I've been looking for you since I took my first breath  
And I'll be loving you baby til I take my last  
I'd like to know  
What would I do without you in my life  
All along I was waiting for you  
From the moment I saw you I knew  
It had to be you  
  
So sure yours  
Together ever after  
Now the dream came true  
And maybe when you least expect it love will come to you  
  
I'd like to know what would I do without you in my life  
All along I was waiting for you  
From the moment I saw you I knew  
It had to be you  
  
Sweet love came to my life  
I was looking for you  
Sweet love came to my life  
I was looking for looking for you  
Sweet love came to my life  
I was thinking about you  
Sweet love came to my life  
All along I was looking for you  
Sweet love came to my life  
I was thinking about you  
Sweet love came to my life  
I was thinking about you  
Sweet love came to my life  
I was thinking about you  
Sweet love came to my life  
From the moment I saw you I knew  
Sweet love came to my life  
Looking for you  
Sweet love came to my life  
I was looking for you  
Sweet love came to my life  
I was thinking about you
