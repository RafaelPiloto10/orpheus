The deal is on the rise again  
The ship comes into shore  
You've been away to somewhere  
But life goes on no less  
  
Through the foreign ocean  
Underneath the sea  
  
The walls come tumbling down  
We'll be forever calm  
And you'll be here in my arms  
I'll keep you away from harm  
  
I thought about you twice just then  
You get me every time  
Keeps coming out of nowhere  
It cannot be defined  
  
Your colours are magnificent  
From magenta to bright blue  
  
The walls come tumbling down  
We'll be forever calm  
And you'll be here in my arms  
I'll keep you away from harm  
  
Through the foreign ocean  
Underneath the sea  
  
The walls come tumbling down  
We'll be forever calm  
And you'll be here in my arms  
I'll keep you away from harm  
  
The walls come tumbling down  
We'll be forever calm  
And you'll be here in my arms  
I'll keep you away from harm  
  
The walls come tumbling down  
We'll be forever calm  
And you'll be here in my arms  
I'll keep you away from harm
