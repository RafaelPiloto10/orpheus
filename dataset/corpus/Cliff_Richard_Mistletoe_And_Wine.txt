The child is a king, the carolers sing,  
The old has passed, there's a new beginning.  
Dreams of Santa, dreams of snow,  
Fingers numb, faces aglow  
  
Christmas time, mistletoe and wine  
Children singing Christian rhyme  
With logs on the fire and gifts on the tree  
A time for rejoicing in all that we see  
  
A time for living, a time for believing  
A time for trusting, not deceiving,  
Love and laughter and joy ever after,  
Ours for the taking, just follow the master  
  
Christmas time, mistletoe and wine  
Children singing Christian rhyme  
With logs on the fire and gifts on the tree  
A time to rejoice in the good that we see  
  
A time for giving, a time for getting,  
A time for forgiving and for forgetting  
Christmas is love, Christmas is peace,  
A time for hating and fighting to cease  
  
Christmas time, mistletoe and wine  
Children singing Christian rhyme  
With logs on the fire and gifts on the tree  
A time to rejoice in the good that we see  
  
Silent night  
Holy night
