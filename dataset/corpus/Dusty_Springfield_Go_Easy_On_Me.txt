hear you baby, I know how you feel  
We're both hungry for something that's real  
Be honest with me or don't even try  
'Cause I can't afford another goodbye  
  
Go easy on me, baby, not too rough  
If this is right, there's no need to rush  
Oh, go easy on me, if you don't mind  
'Cause I can't afford to lose another time  
  
Starting over isn't easy as it sounds  
When you try to make the pieces fit  
They all fall down  
And I need more than someone to hold on to  
I need a love that's tried and true  
It's what I'm searching for  
It's worth waiting for  
  
Talk gently to me, nice and low  
If you mean it, baby, my heart will know  
Oh, go easy on me, like walking on ice  
'Cause forever happens once not twice  
  
Starting over isn't easy as it sounds  
When you try to make the pieces fit  
They all fall down  
And I need more than someone to hold on to  
I need a love that's tried and true  
It's what I'm looking for  
It's worth waiting for  
  
Go easy on me, baby, not too rough  
If this is right, we'll know soon enough  
Oh, go easy on me, not too fast  
I gotta believe that what's between us  
Can be more than just a promise  
'Cause they don't last  
So all that I ask  
Go easy on me  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Easy, ooh, ooh, ooh
