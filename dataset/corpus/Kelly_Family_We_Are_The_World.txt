There comes a time  
When we Need a certain call  
  
When the world must come together as one.  
There are people dying  
And it's time to lend a hand To life -  
The greatest gift of all.  
We can't go on pretending day by day  
That someone somewhere will soon make a change.  
We are all a part of God's great big family  
  
And the truth  
You know  
  
Love is all we need.  
  
We are the world  
We are the children  
  
We are the ones  
Who make a brighter day  
  
So let's start giving.  
There's a choice we're making  
  
We're saving our own lives. It's true  
  
We make a better days  
  
Just you and me.  
  
Send them your heart  
  
So they know that someone cares  
  
And their lives will be stronger and free.  
As God has shown us  
By turning stone to bread  
  
So we all must lend a helping hand.  
  
We are the world...  
  
When you're down and out  
There seems no hope at all  
But if you just believe  
There's no way we can fall  
Let us realize that a  
Change will only come  
When we stand together as one.  
  
We are the world...
