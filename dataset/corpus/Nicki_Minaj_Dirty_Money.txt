I don't wanna sound mad  
I feel marvelous right now  
Dirty money  
  
Tell the bitch with the crown who run like chris brown  
Round three round I'ma need to hundred town  
Like china town bitch is better... Down  
Oh you ain't know bet the bitches know now  
Fuck I gotta let em know that I'm the one  
Way I ride the. They salute me in the slum  
In the six hun' the color the bubble gum  
I'm with the nigga spits and with ym nigga bit crum  
Yes I'm the one I'm the mother fucking one  
No more wait then the big... Pun  
Bitches talk slip but they ain't sayin none  
Man 'cause I'm bad two sticks in my bon  
Yes sir look what I've done  
They run run run when I come  
I'm stickin with... Let me tell you where I'm from  
Please little mama...
