I been gone too long  
Too long gone, too long  
I been travelin' hard  
I just can't get back home  
It's hard to believe I done all that much wrong  
  
I want to find me a seven  
Sevens ain't so bad  
Seven's about the best friend  
This poor boy ever had  
You get you a seven  
One and six don't seem so sad  
  
I ain't bein' alone  
Bein' alone too long  
I'm sick of singin' this same ol' lonesome song  
I'm gonna find me a seven and darlin'  
I'm comin' home  
  
It's lonesome down along this ol' highway  
Darlin' I ain't stayin' here  
I don't intend to stay  
You may not want me I'm comin' home anyway  
  
When the sun comes creepin'  
Over the mountain side  
I at least lay down and tell myself I tried  
I ain't like somebody gonna sit  
In no ditch and cry  
  
I been gone too long  
Too long gone, too long  
Travelin' hard I just can't get back home  
It's hard to believe I done all that much wrong  
  
Too long gone  
Too long gone, too long  
Travelin' hard, I just can't get back home  
It's hard to believe I done all that much wrong  
It's hard to believe I done all that much wrong
