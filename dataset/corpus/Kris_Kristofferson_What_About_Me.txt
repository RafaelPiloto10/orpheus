I seen another soldier who got wasted in the war  
He said he left his soul there overseas  
The notion he defended doesn't matter anymore  
And circumstance had brought him to his knees  
We sat there in the silence of a cold and empty room  
Down the hall I heard a baby cry  
He looked up from the potion he was cooking in a spoon  
And nailed me with the anger in his eye  
Chorus:  
He said, do you really believe in freedom ?  
I said, I do  
He said, oh, what about me ?  
They killed both of her parents in an undercover war  
For wanting all their children to be free  
She said, it's even sadder that it's in el salvador  
They named it for the savior don't you see  
Suddenly the truth was like a blinding flash of light  
Holy thunder rolled across the sky  
I stared into the wonder of the warrior jesus christ  
And destiny was burning in his eyes.  
Chorus:  
He said, do you really believe in freedom ?  
I said, I do  
He said, oh, what about me ?  
And the sandinista said, do you really believe in freedom ?  
I said, I do  
He said, oh, what about me ?
