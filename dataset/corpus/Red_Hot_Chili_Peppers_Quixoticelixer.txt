Kick back a little bit just to watch and see  
Getting sicker by the minute with debauchery  
Whatever your pleasure I'm your punk  
Gonna bring the second bait that's not yet sunk  
How I listen below when you told me  
That I was all you had to hold  
I wish you were sober when you told me  
That you were solid gold  
Gravity-free is she, look at her  
Hottest on the map she's full of anti-matter  
You never look at very mellow impressions  
Smell you with your going to hell expression  
Quixoticelixer might  
But it will probably not fix your bite  
Tell me now, tell me how  
Did I your lipstick on my kite  
  
I love this weather  
It's the perfect storm  
Just keep it coming  
In it's perfect form  
I love this weather  
'Cause it keeps me warm  
Just keep it coming  
In it's perfect form  
  
Everyday depression in a beautiful dress  
Lady made a beautiful mess I guess  
Dedicated mind did a medicated state  
Is a highly overrated fate  
Terra-bulb is a soul  
When she told me there is such a thing  
Do you know that you glow when you go  
From winter to the spring  
  
I love this weather  
It's a perfect storm  
Just keep it coming  
In it's perfect form  
I love this weather  
'Cause it keeps me warm  
Just keep it coming  
In it's perfect form  
  
The madder the boy, the sadder the song  
That's a wicked fate but the sick gets strong  
Mad boy, sad song  
A wicked fate, but the sick gets strong  
Nobody's right and everyone's wrong  
I refuse to punt on fourth and long  
Mad boy, sad song  
Wicked fate but the sick gets...  
  
Kick back a little bit just to watch and see  
Getting sicker by the minute with debauchery  
Whatever your pleasure I'm your punk  
Gonna bring the second bait that's not yet sunk  
How I listen below when you told me  
That I was all you had to hold  
I wish it was so when you told me  
That you were solid gold  
  
I swear to god I could not hurt you  
I've got to be inside your virtue  
I can't contain my urge to search you  
  
I stand before you there's no curfew  
I long to be inside your virtue  
My heart is swollen when I search you  
  
I swear to god I could not hurt you  
My heart is swollen when I search you  
I swear to god I could not hurt you  
  
I swear to god I could not hurt you  
I've got to be inside your virtue  
I can't contain my urge to search you
