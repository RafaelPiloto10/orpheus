I wake up in the evening  
The sun is still around  
The street seems to be busy  
I hear the traffic sounds  
  
Last night's been lousy  
I had a lot to drink  
Too many dry martinis  
And cans of beer to sink  
  
Another day, already night  
Blue neon light  
Blue neon light  
  
I could call my Rhianna  
Ask her to meet me now  
I think I lost her number  
It's too late anyhow  
I could turn on the TV  
Or I could stay in bed  
  
These Asians drive me crazy  
These Asians drive me mad  
  
Another day, already night  
Blue neon light  
Blue neon light  
  
Night is near  
I'm still in bed  
Red curtain  
Soft wind  
Sunlight  
And I was red  
  
On the papers  
On the floor  
We did watch possessed  
  
People, push and pull it  
Moss turf, and other lads  
My head's still full of poison  
What I do is insane  
I should, perhaps, move out of here  
Or take a plane to Spain  
  
Refrigerator's noise  
I'll get out, the only choice  
Should I get up right now  
Wait for me somehow  
Don't want to know what for  
To get out of this door  
Should I phone Debbie Meier?  
Is this the one desire?  
I look into the mirror  
My eyes can't be in error  
The sun's now really gone  
Perhaps I am the one  
Nothing can creep in sight  
I'm turning on the lights  
  
Turning on the lights  
I'm turning on the lights (5x)  
  
The sun's now really gone  
Perhaps I am the one
