Leroy Carr  
  
A traditional song which was a likely inspiration for The Train Song.  
  
How long, how long, has that evenin' train been gone?  
How long, how long, baby how long.  
  
Heard the whistle blowin', couldn't see the train  
Way down in my heart I had an achin' pain.  
How long, How long, how long.  
  
If I could holler like a mountain jack  
I'd go up on the mountain and call my baby back.  
  
I went up on the mountain, looked as far as I could see  
The man had my woman and the blues had poor me.  
  
I can see the green grass growin' on the hill  
But I ain't seen the green grass on a dollar bill.  
  
I'm goin' down to Georgia, been up in Tennessee  
So look me over baby, last you'll see of me.  
  
The brook runs into the river, river runs into the sea  
If I don't run into my baby, a train is goin' to run into me.
