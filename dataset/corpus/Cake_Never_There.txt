I need your arms around me  
I need to feel your touch  
I need your understanding  
I need your love so much  
  
You tell me that you love me so  
You tell me that you care  
But when I need you (baby)  
Baby, you're never there  
  
On the phone  
long, long distance  
always through such strong resistance  
First you say you're to busy  
I wonder if you even miss me  
  
Never there  
You're never there  
You're never ever ever ever there  
  
A golden bird that flies away  
A candle's fickle flame  
To think I held you yesterday  
Your love was just a game  
  
You tell me that you love me so  
You tell me that you care  
But when I need you (baby)  
Baby  
  
Take the time to get to know me  
If you want me why can't you just show me  
Well, always on this roller coaster  
If you want me why can't you get closer  
  
Never there  
You're never there  
You're never ever ever ever there  
Never there  
You're never there  
You're never ever ever ever there
