Every day of every year you live your life in hope and fear,  
That each small sin and imperfection is buried deep beyond detection.  
But one by one the ghosts return, and each selects it's place to burn,  
Into your soft and breaking heart, and this is how the aching starts.  
The jokes about the ugly kid.  
The things you said but never did.  
The people torn and crushed and battered.  
The ones you broke but should've flattered.  
  
Oh, you should have run whilst you had time.  
Oh, you should have left the past behind.  
  
  
The boy from the chemist is here to see you.  
The laughing stops cause he's too near you.  
The girl you left that always loved you.  
Returns to earth from miles above you now.  
  
  
So wash away the dirty skin, there's always worse remains within.  
The tangled web and bitter mesh, but each shall have their pound of flesh.  
No sympathy, no charity, no false pleas of humility.  
No money back, no guarantee, no great escape for you and me.  
  
Oh, you should have run whilst you had time.  
Oh, you should have left the past behind.  
  
The boy from the chemist is here to see you.  
The laughing stops cause he's too near you.  
The girl you left that always loved you.  
Returns to earth from miles above you now.  
  
And everyone that's ever suffered, friend or foe or wives or lovers.  
They'll come back to have their day.  
In time you find your mind has no escape.  
  
  
Don't believe that you can hide, don't believe they'll be denied.  
They'll come knocking at your door, this is what they've waited for.  
The chance to even up the score.  
  
The boy from the chemist is here to see you.  
The laughing stops cause he's too near you.  
The girl you left that always loved you.  
Returns to earth from miles above you now.  
  
And everyone that's ever suffered, friend or foe or wives or lovers.  
They'll come back to have their day.  
In time you find your mind has no escape.
