Why you keep on callin' me  
When you know we'll never be  
'Cause you got someone on the side  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
I said hey girl  
Did you hear me?  
I said hey girl  
Why are you callin' now?  
Arent you with him now?  
Don't try to play me for a fool  
I could never be your fool gonna find someone who really wants me  
  
Why you keep on callin' me girl  
I said stop callin' me  
Why you keep on callin' me  
When you know we'll never be  
'Cause you got someone on the side  
Keep thinking that were gonna be  
So you keep on callin' me  
But you got someone on the side  
  
Hey girl is he really good?

Why you keep on callin' me  
When you know we'll never be  
'Cause you got someone on the side  
Keep thinking that were gonna be  
So you keep on callin' me  
But you got someone on the side

That you came from above  
Damn, how could I be so wrong?  
I said get off my back
