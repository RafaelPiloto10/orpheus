We've been waiting so long  
We've been waiting so long, oh  
We've been waiting for the sun to rise and shine  
Shining still to give us the will  
  
Can you hear me, the sound of my voice?  
I am here to tell you I have made my choice  
I've been listening to what's been going down  
There's just too much talk and gossip going 'round  
  
You may think that I'm a fool but I know the answer  
Words become a tool, anyone can use them  
Take the golden rule as the best example  
Eyes that have seen will know what I mean  
  
Hold that line, baby hold that line  
Get up boys and hit 'em one more time  
We may be losing now but we can't stop trying  
So hold that line, baby hold that line  
  
If you don't know what to do about a world of trouble  
You can pull it through if you need to and if  
You believe it's true, it will surely happen  
  
Shining still, to give us the will  
We've been waiting so long, waiting so long  
Been waiting so long, waiting so long  
  
Shining still, to give us the will  
Bright as the day, to show us the way  
Somehow, someday  
We need just one victory and we're on our way  
  
We've been prayin' for it all day  
And we're fightin' for it all night  
To give us just one victory, it will be all right  
We may feel about to fall but we go down fighting  
  
You will hear the call if you only listen  
Underneath it all we are here together  
Shining still, to give us the will  
Now bright as the day, to show us the way  
  
Hold that line, baby hold that line  
Get up boys and hit 'em one more time  
We may be losing now but we can't stop trying  
So hold that line, baby hold that line  
  
Hold that line, baby hold that line  
Get up boys and hit 'em one more time  
We may be losing now but we can't stop trying  
So hold that line, baby hold that line  
  
Hold that line, baby hold that line  
Get up boys and hit 'em one more time  
We may be losing now but we can't stop trying  
So hold that line, baby hold that line  
  
Hold that line, baby hold that line  
Get up boys and hit 'em one more time  
We may be losing now but we can't stop trying  
So hold that line, baby hold that line
