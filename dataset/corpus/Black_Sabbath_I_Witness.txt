Across the desert of the burning dark, a  
Darkness which illuminates you,  
There's a place you've always wanted to be,  
Whose pleasures always did escape you,  
It's always been so out of reach, nothing, so near  
Ever felt so far  
And now it's here within your grasp, a never  
Ending burning says it all.  
  
[Chorus]  
As you drive into the darkness, in front the future  
Behind you history  
Caught alone in the dark night, do you think  
That's the way it's supposed to be.  
You don't believe your eyes, cos all they see is  
Lies, oh yeah.  
  
You better run from the holy man, the eyes that  
Will are set uppon you,  
Listen not to verse and prayer, song that thrill  
And voices tempt you  
The inner flame has fear of death, never, has  
Light ever seemed so dark.  
Pilgrims of sabbocracy, hear the hounds of  
Heaven, as they bark  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I witness a time and a place that never dies, still  
Frozen in time,  
This darkness the only place that I can hide, i  
Witness, a dream.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I witness a time and a place that never dies, still  
Frozen in time,  
This darkness the only place that I can hide, i  
Witness a dream.  
Oh, just a dream.
