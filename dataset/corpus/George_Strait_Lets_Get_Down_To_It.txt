Don't' need your love  
On a silver platter  
Let's get down tot he nitty grit  
Let's cut out all the chatter  
Get to the ehart of the matter  
Honey let's get down to it  
  
Let's get down to some huggin' and some squeezin'  
Arm and arm  
We'd be a perfect fit  
So put a freeze on the teasin'  
Let's get on with the pleasin'  
Honey let's get down to it  
  
I know that you want to  
I can see it when I look into those bug green eye's  
Baby let's come to grits  
Don't play so hard to get  
Honey let's get down to it  
  
I get a chill every time your near me  
You've got my heart doin' flips  
I only aim to please  
If you'd let go you'd see  
Honey let's get down to it  
  
I know that you want to  
I can see it when I look into those bug green eye's  
Baby let's come to grits  
Don't play so hard to get  
Honey let's get down to it  
  
Honey let's get down to it
