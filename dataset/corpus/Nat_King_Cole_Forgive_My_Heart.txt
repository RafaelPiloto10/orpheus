Forgive my heart  
My foolish heart it won't believe we're through  
Forgive my heart  
You're still a part of everything I do  
Forgive my lips  
If now and then  
They speak your name  
If you are still  
My only thrill  
Am I to blame  
  
Forgive my dreams  
In all my dreams it seems your face appears  
Forgive my eyes  
I realize I'm only wasting tears  
Don't know why you haunt me  
But you do  
Forgive my heart  
I'm still in love with you
