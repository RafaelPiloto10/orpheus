There's an abyss in your life,  
'Cause a good love's gone bad  
You've lost someone for now and forever  
She was the best you've ever had  
Just let go it's a hopeless endeavor  
Don't stick your head in the sand  
Don't you cry so much, it doesn't help  
Not with her picture in your hand  
  
Just when you lose your smiling face  
Gonna bring you to a special place, 'cause I'm a  
  
Drone, pleasure drone  
And I wipe your tears away  
Drone, pleasure drone  
I'm gonna make you a perfect day  
  
I'm made for sensing your mood  
No reason for despair  
Can you hear mechanical noises  
When I buzz through the air  
  
To get you up I'll hand you presents  
From my telescoptic arm  
No matter they're no hands  
But my claws won't do no harm  
  
And wherever there's bad vibes,  
I will detect them with laser eyes, 'cause I'm a  
  
Drone, pleasure drone  
And I wipe your tears away  
Drone, pleasure drone  
I'm gonna made you a perfect day  
  
Drone, pleasure drone  
And I wipe your tears away  
Drone, pleasure drone  
I'm gonna make you a perfect day  
Drone, pleasure drone
