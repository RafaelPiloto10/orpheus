"The way I see it," he said  
"You just can't win it  
Everybody's in it for their own gain  
You can't please 'em all  
There's always somebody calling you down  
  
I do my best  
And I do good business  
There's a lot of people asking for my time  
They're trying to get ahead  
They're trying to be a good friend of mine  
I was a free man in Paris  
I felt unfettered and alive  
There was nobody calling me up for favors  
  
And no one's future to decide  
You know I'd go back there tomorrow  
But for the work I've taken on  
Stoking the star maker machinery  
Behind the popular song  
I deal in dreamers  
And telephone screamers  
Lately I wonder what I do it for  
If l had my way  
I'd just walk out those doors  
  
And wander  
Down the Champs Elysees  
Going cafe to cabaret  
Thinking how I'll feel when I find  
That very good friend of mine  
I was a free man in Paris  
I felt unfettered and alive  
Nobody was calling me up for favors  
No one's future to decide  
You know I'd go back there tomorrow  
  
But for the work I've taken on  
Stoking the star maker machinery  
Behind the popular song.
