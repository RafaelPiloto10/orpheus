You ask how much I need you  
Must I explain?  
I need you, oh my darling, like roses need rain  
You ask how long I'll love you  
I'll tell you true  
Until the twelfth of never  
I'll still be loving you  
  
You ask me where I'm going  
Just take my hand  
My darling, I'll be showing you a promised land  
A land where we'll be lovers forever more  
Or until the twelfth of never  
Of that you can be sure  
  
Hold me close  
Never let me go  
Hold me close  
Melt my heart like April snow  
  
I'll love you 'til the blue bells forget to bloom  
I'll love you 'til the clover has lost its perfume  
I'll love you 'til the poets run out of rhyme  
Until the twelfth of never  
And that's a long, long time  
  
(I do love how you love me  
I do)  
Oh, I love you  
(I promise to be faithful)  
I promise you  
I'll love you 'til the poets run out of rhyme  
Until the twelfth of never  
And that's a long, long time
