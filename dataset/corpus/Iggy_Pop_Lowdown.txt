I don't want to throw away my time  
Playing games I don't respect or like  
I can't give away my sovereignty  
To existence with no song of me  
  
And the hole in my heart  
I'm lowdown  
There's a hole in my heart  
I'm low  
There's a hole in my heart  
I'm lowdown  
There's a hole in my heart  
I'm low  
  
I built myself a beautiful brick wall  
Gets a little higher every day  
? ignorance inhabits me  
Cause I've already chased my love away  
  
And the hole in my heart  
I'm lowdown  
There's a hole in my heart  
I'm low  
There's a hole in my heart  
I'm lowdown  
There's a hole in my heart  
I'm low  
  
Take that happy banner off the wall  
I don't need to see no smiling face  
All I really want's a cup of tea  
To feel a warmth inside of me  
  
And the hole in my heart  
I'm lowdown  
There's a hole in my heart  
I'm low  
There's a hole in my heart  
I'm lowdown  
There's a hole in my heart  
I'm low  
  
There's a hole in my heart  
I'm lowdown  
There's a hole in my heart  
I'm low  
There's a hole in my heart  
I'm lowdown  
There's a hole in my heart  
I'm low
