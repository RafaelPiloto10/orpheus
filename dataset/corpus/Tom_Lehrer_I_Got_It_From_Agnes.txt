I love my friends and they love me  
We're just as close as we can be  
And just because we really care  
Whatever we get, we share!  
I got it from agnes  
She got it from jim  
We all agree it must have been him  
Louise who gave it to him  
Now she got it from harry  
Who got it from marie  
And ev'rybody knows that marie  
Got it from me  
Giles got it from daphne  
She got it from joan  
Who picked it up in county cork  
A-kissin' the blarney stone  
Pierre gave it to shiela  
Who must have brought it there  
He got it from francois and jacques  
Aha, lucky pierre!  
Max got it from edith  
Who gets it ev'ry spring  
She got it from her daddy  
Who just gives her ev'rything  
She then gave it to daniel  
Whose spaniel has it now  
Our dentist even got it  
And we're still wondering how  
But I got it from agnes  
Or maybe it was sue  
Or millie or billie or gillie or willie  
It doesn't matter who  
It might have been at the pub  
Or at the club, or in the loo  
And if you will be my friend, then I might ...  
(mind you, I said "might" ...)  
Give it to you!
