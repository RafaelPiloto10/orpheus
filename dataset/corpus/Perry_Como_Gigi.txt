Gigi, am I a fool without a mind  
Or have I merely been too blind to realize?  
Oh Gigi, why you've been growin' up  
Before my very eyes  
  
Gigi, you're not at all  
The funny awkward little girl I knew  
Oh no, overnight there's been  
A breathless change in you  
  
Gigi, why you were tremblin' on the brink  
Was I out yonder somewhere blinkin' at a star?  
Oh Gigi, have I been standin'  
Up too close or back too far?  
  
When did your sparkle turn to fire  
And your warmth become desire?  
Oh, what miracle has made you  
The way you are?  
  
Oh Gigi, have I been standin'  
Up too close or back too far?  
  
When did your sparkle turn to fire  
And your warmth become desire?  
Oh, what miracle has made you  
The way you are?
