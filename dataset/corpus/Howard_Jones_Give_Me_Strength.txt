I'm not one to complain  
But things get heavy now and again  
These obstacles leave  
Little scars on the brain  
  
Give me strength to carry on  
Give me strength to carry on  
  
I know this worrying  
Makes my body ill  
Stops me reaching the heights  
Where we all belong  
  
Give me strength to carry on  
Give me strength I must feel strong  
Give me strength to carry on  
Give me strength I must feel strong  
  
I will relax in your arms  
Feel like a newborn babe  
I'll be floating in space  
Watching the world turn around  
  
Give me strength to carry on  
Give me strength I must feel strong  
Give me strength to carry on  
Feels like all my hope is gone  
  
Relax in your arms  
Like a newborn babe  
Floating in space  
And watch the world turn around  
Problems seem to fade  
Weightless in the air  
  
No need to worry  
Leave it behind  
I'm not one to complain  
But thing get heavy now and again  
Getting through these obstacles  
Leaves scars on the brain  
You make me feel  
There is no need to worry  
It will be fine  
Given some time
