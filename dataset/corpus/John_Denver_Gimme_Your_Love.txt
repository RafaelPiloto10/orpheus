Oh, spring is here and love is in the air  
Overflowing with life and I don't have a care  
I'm gonna see you shining like your diamond ring  
Every cell in our body is singing  
  
Gimme your love forever  
Gimme your love  
Gimme your love forever  
Oh, oh, gimme your love gimme your love  
  
All around I see signs of rebirth  
Resurrection, renewal, celebration of life on earth  
Baby won't you stay with me and watch your garden grow  
I love you, I want you, please say you'll  
  
Gimme your love forever  
Gimme your love  
Gimme your love forever  
Oh, oh, gimme your love gimme your love  
  
People think I'm crazy as I walk along the street  
I don't understand 'em anyway  
All I know is since you came my life has been so sweet  
And that's the way I know it's gonna stay  
  
Baby won't you stay with me and watch your garden grow  
I love you, I want you, please stay you'll  
  
Gimme your love forever  
Gimme your love  
Gimme your love forever  
Oh, oh, gimme your love gimme your love
