I want to have dinner with Gershwin  
I want to watch Rembrandt sketch  
I want to talk theory with Curie  
Impossible I guess  
  
I want to talk moods with Picasso  
On a rendezvous  
I want to fly double with Earhart  
I want to get next to you  
Next to you  
  
So close  
Just as close as I can get  
The rain of your worry  
Can't effect  
What I feel is what I feel  
One touch  
Of your greatness  
Is what I need  
My circle of fantasy  
Would be complete  
  
I want to sing hymns with Mahalia  
When the day is through  
I want to tell you about it  
I want to get next to you  
Next to you  
  
So close  
Just as close as I can get  
The rain of your worry  
Can't effect  
What I feel is what I feel  
One touch  
Of your greatness  
Is what I need  
My circle of fantasy  
Would be complete  
  
So close  
Just as close as I can get  
The rain of your worries  
Can't effect  
What I feel is what I feel  
One touch  
Of your greatness  
Is what I need  
My circle of fantasy  
Would be complete  
  
I want to have dinner with Gershwin  
I want to watch Rembrandt sketch  
I want to talk theory with Curie  
Impossible I guess
