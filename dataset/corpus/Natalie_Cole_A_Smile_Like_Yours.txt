Thought I'd seen everything there was to see in this world  
Now I'm not so sure I've really seen anything at all  
I thought life could show me no surprises  
And then you came and showed me I was wrong  
I have seen the bluest skies, rainbows that would make you cry  
I have seen miracles that moved my soul, days that changed my life  
I have seen the brightest stars shine like diamonds in the dark  
Seen all the wonders of the world, but I've never seen a smile  
As beautiful as yours  
I thought I'd been everywhere, I've climbed a mountain so high  
Sailed the sea, crossed the sky and still I was nowhere at all  
Until that day, oh, you came to my senses  
And your smile, it made sense out of it all  
I have seen the bluest skies, rainbows that would make you cry  
I have seen miracles that moved my soul, days that changed my life  
I have seen the brightest stars shine like diamonds in the dark  
Seen all the wonders of the world, but I've never seen a smile  
As beautiful as ours  
So beautiful, comes one time in a lifetime  
A smile this beautiful, I've never dreamed I'd ever see  
I have seen the bluest skies, rainbows that would make you cry  
I've seen miracles moved my soul and days that changed my life  
I have seen the brightest stars shine like diamonds in the dark  
Oh, I've seen the wonders of this world but I've never seen a smile  
So beautiful, oh, I've never seen a smile before as beautiful as yours
