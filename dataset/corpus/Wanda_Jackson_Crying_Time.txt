Oh it's crying time again you're gonna leave me  
I can see that faraway look in your eyes  
I can tell by the way you held me darling  
That it won't be long before it's crying time  
  
Oh they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder  
And that tears are only rain to make love grow  
Well my love for you could never grow no stronger  
If I live to be a hundred years old  
Oh it's crying time again you're gonna leave me  
  
Oh they say that you found someone that you love better  
That's the way it's happened every time before  
And as sure as sun comes up tomorrow  
Crying time will start when you walk out the door  
Oh it's crying time again you're gonna leave me  
  
No it won't be long before it's crying time
