If I'm frightened then I can hide it  
If I'm crying, I'll call it laughter  
If I am haunted, I'll call it my imaginary friend  
If I am bleeding I'll call it wine  
  
But if you leave me then I am broken  
And If I'm broken then only death remains  
  
If I am drifting, then I can fight it  
If I am sinking, no-one will know it  
If I am blinded I'll have my voices to guide me  
If they yet fled away I'd bless the silence  
  
But if you leave me then I'm broken  
And If I'm broken then only death remains
