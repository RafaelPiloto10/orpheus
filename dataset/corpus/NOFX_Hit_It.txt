You tell me you don't like the taste  
Drugs and alcohol are such a waste  
You got better things to do  
Like hang around, be straight and screw  
enjoy your day, what to say  
Hell of a friend why do they know  
You don't know any compassion  
You don't like the drink  
You tell me I've ruined my life  
Well I don't care what you think  
Why do you say we're mad as hell  
Why do you say we're mad as hell  
I've got my own set of values  
Why don't you go enjoy yourself?
