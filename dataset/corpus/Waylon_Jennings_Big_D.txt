Stranded here in Dallas cold and hungry I ain't got a dime  
Sleepin' in the filty trainyard at the warmest driest place that I can find  
What have I done that would justify the way you treatin' me Big D  
Stranded here in Dallas cold and hungry I don't know a soul  
I could feel a little warmer but I find that there's no coat in my woredraw  
My clothes're paper thin still you let your chill of winter fall on me Big D  
[ guitar ]  
Why I wanna go where the winds don't blow till summer  
Somewhere the sun will warm this chill in me  
Stranded here in Dallas cold and hungry I don't even know my name  
Oh my temperature keeps risin' and I feel that it's done damage to my brain  
Could this dirty trainyard be the last and final restin' place for me Big D
Big D
