Misty morning, clouds in the sky  
Without warning, the wizard walks by  
Casting his shadow, weaving his spell  
Funny clothes, tinkling bell  
Never talking  
Just keeps walking  
Spreading his magic  
Evil power disappears  
Demons worry when the wizard is near  
He turns tears into joy  
Everyone's happy when the wizard walks by  
Never talking  
Just keeps walking  
Spreading his magic  
Sun is shining, clouds have gone by  
All the people give a happy sigh  
He has passed by, giving his sign  
Left all the people feeling so fine  
Never talking  
Just keeps walking  
Spreading his magic
