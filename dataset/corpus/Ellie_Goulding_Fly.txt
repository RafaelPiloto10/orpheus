In the window, faces staring right past me,  
They're on a date feeling happy, yet I go in there and sit with them.  
Make them laugh, and be normal for an hour and a half of someones time, but
not mine.  
'Cause I just fly fly fly, only fly fly fly.  
When things are moving so fast you don't have to take them in.  
When you're falling apart you don't even have to think about it, about it.  
  
Know every station off by heart.  
Never get off just go back to the start of my journey, and I'm never as young
as I want to be.  
I'll think I'll never worry if I fly fly fly.  
I'll just fly.  
When things are moving so fast you don't have to take them in.  
When you're falling apart you don't even have to think about it, about it.  
  
Some day the sky will run out.  
The ground will pull me back down, back down to thinking straight,  
Never being late for love that I haven't found.  
But maybe I should try, maybe I should try.  
  
My bag is heavy, I feel weak,  
Talk to people but they don't speak.  
Always moving but I still don't know where I'm going.  
But that okay because I'll fly fly fly, I'll just fly fly fly.  
When things are moving so fast you don't have to take them in.  
When you're falling apart you don't even have to think about it, about it.  
  
I'll just fly, I'll just fly.
