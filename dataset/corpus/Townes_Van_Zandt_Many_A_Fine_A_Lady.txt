[Chorus:]  
It's many a fine lady has laid down beside me  
With their flesh made of velvet and their eyes made of rain  
Some tried to hold me, to hurt me, to hide me  
Some turned away, not to look back again  
  
One stood among them, I remember most clearly  
Her sorrows were heavy, and her laughter was slow  
I courted her gently, for I loved her most dearly  
And I came her majestic reflections to know  
  
Her words, like the mountain, stood lonely and lofty  
With her face like a daydream and her hair like the shawl  
Worn by a mourner, who steals away softly  
From those that would have him mourn nothing at all  
  
Endlessly sorrow rode high on the north wind  
Slashing and slicing to take him his toll  
Endlessly creatures of darkness were cutting  
Their paths through the walls that shelter the soul  
  
No longer gypsy-like sadness unending  
Her eyes - they lie hollow and her face petrified  
Some will go laughing and others condemning  
But who there among you could have told her goodbye?  
  
[Chorus]
