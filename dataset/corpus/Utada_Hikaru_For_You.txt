When I put my headphones on and hide amongst the crowds  
I feel like I must've just disappeared.  
that music that makes even the sound of my own footsteps fade away.  
Until I forget you and our fighting I want to dance.  
When I come back to a messy room,  
I can see my own loneliness through your existence.  
Though it would be better to become kinder for my sake and not someone else's,  
I can't feel lonely all by myself, that's why  
For you I want to give you the same loneliness so that you can become strong  
So that someday it can reach you, that's why  
I sing this song for you.  
Even on mornings when I don't want to get up,  
I get up to see your face.  
On sleepless nights,  
I sing to myself the song you gave me.  
Don't get me wrong,  
I don't intend to ever rely on you for anything at all.  
If there's a song I can sing for only me and not anyone else,  
I don't wanna remember that kind of song.  
That's why for you if you misunderstand me, I feel this heartbreak  
Eventhough I should be used to it, eventhough I should be milder.  
That's why I sing this song for you  
I want to make you cry  
Let me hurt you, and let me heal you  
When I want to fly you always give me a brighter sky.  
You want to make me cry  
You taught me joy by sorrow  
When I want to shine you always give me a darker sky.
