My tape recorder,  
It must be lyin'  
'Cause this I just can't believe.  
I hear a voice that's cryin',  
That's not me.  
  
The wheel goes round.  
I hear a sound.  
It's comin' out all wrong.  
And I swear to you I never wrote that song.  
  
I been livin' in my own shell so long:  
The only place I ever feel at home.  
  
And oh, that music,  
I hate those lyrics.  
It stayed inside me so long.  
And I swear to you I never wrote that song.  
  
But pardon me,  
I'm not lookin' for sympathy,  
Not sympathy.  
I'm just thinking out loud.  
The melody,  
It goes nowhere pointlessly.  
Silence please.  
  
I been livin' in my own shell so long:  
The only place I ever feel at home.  
  
And oh, that music,  
I hate those lyrics.  
It stayed inside me so long.  
And I swear to you I never.
