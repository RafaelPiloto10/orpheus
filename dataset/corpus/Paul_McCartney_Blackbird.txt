Blackbird singing in the dead of night, take these broken wings and learn to
fly  
All your life, you were only waiting for this moment to arise  
  
Blackbird singing in the dead of night, take these sunken eyes and learn to
see  
All your life, you were only waiting for this moment to be free  
  
Black-bird fly  
Black-bird fly, into the light of a dark black night  
  
Black-bird fly  
Black-bird fly, into the light of a dark black night  
  
Blackbird singing in the dead of night, take these broken wings and learn to
fly  
All your life, you were only waiting for this moment to arise  
you were only waiting for this moment to arise  
you were only waiting for this moment to arise
