I have never felt such frustration  
Or lack of self control  
I want you to kill me  
And dig me under, I want to live no more  
  
[Chorus: ]  
One who doesn't care, is one who shouldn't be  
I've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me  
For me  
  
I want to taste dirty, a stinging pistol  
In my mouth, on my tongue  
I want you to scrape me from the walls  
And go crazy like you've made me  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2x]  
  
You, you are so special  
You have the talent to make me feel like dirt  
And you, you use your talent to dig me under  
And cover me with dirt  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
