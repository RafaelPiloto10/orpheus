You said when you met you'd never forget me  
And I thought my problems were gone  
But you changed all the while and you did it in style  
How could I think that this was wrong  
  
Some times it stops we can't compromise that  
But I think back to all the relations we had  
That we had  
  
They say things could change neither one of us claims  
That the other was wrong at all  
But you blend different bits 2 complete opposites  
And you're asking for both to fall  
  
Some times it stops we can't compromise that  
But I think back to all the relations we had  
And remember this moment opinions we mine  
You put up all these changes i'll fall back in line  
But I can't make my thoughts just go away
