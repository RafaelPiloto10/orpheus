I'm confessin' that I love you,  
Tell me, do you love me too?  
I'm confessin' that I need you,  
Honest I do, need you every moment.  
In your eyes I read such strange things,  
But your lips deny they're true,  
Will your answer really change things  
Making me blue?  
  
I'm afraid some day you'll leave me,  
Saying "can't we still be friends"  
If you go, you know you'll grieve me,  
All in life on you depends.  
Am I guessin' that you love me,  
Dreaming dreams of you in vain,  
I'm confessin' that I love you, over again.
