Yesterday's coal train came to rest in the bitter cutting  
And as the signals took an age to change it was easy pickings  
So you go to the movies where they smash it up  
You want to feel your heart pumping it makes you feel good  
A few of the rookie cops were squealing the hits  
As another Mercedes-Benz gets blown to bits  
While all the time in the Camptown Theatres of Piccadilly  
They're going to throw a black-face minstrel show for the barefoot children  
That they're always selling  
They'll say "It's quaint" as the guilty ones faint  
And claim they ain't underneath this paint  
We interrupt these liberal saints with their whips and watermelon  
  
Reports are coming in of a coal-train robbery  
It's like another world, or it had better be  
  
So we return to whitewashed pout of his committed lips  
Since he was declared the long lost fountain of youth  
That drips and drips and drips  
They'll be sending him round from door to door,  
To sell you back what's already yours  
"So many good deeds, so little time"  
Say the advertising agency swine  
When man has destroyed what he thinks he owns  
I hope no living thing cries over his bones  
If you don't believe that I'm going for good  
You can count the days I'm gone and chop up the chairs for firewood  
  
Reports are coming in of a coal-train robbery  
It's like another world, or it had better be
