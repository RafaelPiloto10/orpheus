I'm walkin' in shadows, I cannot see  
Faces, they smile when I fall or flee  
Doors without windows all shuttered tight again  
I just might pass this way again  
I just might pass this way again  
I just might pass this way  
I just might pass this way again  
  
The night she is hot, Creole girls they sing  
My heart, it is pounding, my ears they ring  
The spell has been cast down in New Orleans again  
  
I just might pass this way again  
I just might pass this way again  
I just might pass this way  
I just might pass this way again  
  
Locked in a room down in New Orleans  
My blood is a flowin' fast  
Locked in a room down in New Orleans  
My blood is a flowin' fast  
  
The night she is hot, Creole girls they sing  
My heart, it is pounding, my ears they ring  
The spell has been cast down in New Orleans  
My blood is a flowin' fast
