I'm in control, I got a bulletproof soul  
And I'm full of self-esteem  
I invented myself with no one's help  
I'm a prototype supreme  
I sit on my private throne  
And run my lifestyle all alone  
Me, myself and I agree  
We don't need nobobdy else  
  
I never learned to bow, bend or crawl  
To any known authority  
I really want to build my statue tall  
That's all  
  
I'm just trying to be God  
I only want to be God  
I just want to be God  
Why can't I be God  
  
I got no time to take advice  
I want to gamble with my eternity with loaded dice  
I don't need a preacher in my face  
When I'm the omnipresent ruler of the human race  
Ain't gonna spend my life being no one's fool  
I was born to rock and I was born to rule  
But if I'm wrong on judgement day  
I'm royally screwed with hell to pay  
  
I never learned to bow, bend or crawl  
To any known authority  
I really want to build my statue tall  
That's all  
  
I'm just trying to be God  
I only want to be God  
I just want to be God  
Why can't I be God  
I'm just trying to be God  
I only want to be God  
I just want to be God  
Why can't I be God  
  
I'm just trying to be God  
I only want to be God  
I just want to be God  
Why can't I be God  
I'm just trying to be God  
I only want to be God  
I just want to be God  
Why can't I be God
