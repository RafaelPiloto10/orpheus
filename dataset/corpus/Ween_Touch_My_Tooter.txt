Buddy, why's my brain so muddy  
Why do I feel like putty when she walks into the room?  
Touch my tooter, smoocher  
  
Sonny, it ain't all milk and honey  
And I don't think it's funny when she starts to groove  
  
Baby, ain't it pretty lazy, and ain't it crazy  
When you think it's all smooth  
Touch my tooter, smoocher

And I don't think it's funny when she starts to groove  
Touch my tooter, smoocher  
  
Take it down for me!  
Bring it on!  
Touch my tooter, smoocher!  
Ahhhh!
