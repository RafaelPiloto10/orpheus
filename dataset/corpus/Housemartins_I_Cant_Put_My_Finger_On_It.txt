As martin said to xanthe  
As they played with wooden toys  
"you may have wendy's playhouse  
But where the heel's your boys? "  
As paul said to fifi  
As they eyed each other up  
"you may have better plimsoles  
But you can't pee standing up"  
And I'd like to take the time to bite  
Their neck and make it bleed  
Or maybe I could cut holes in their  
Daddy's harris tweed  
And I can't put my finger on it  
Maybe it's something in their food  
And I cna't put my finger on it  
All I know is christ would've sued  
As sharon said to jamie  
As they sat down for a chat  
"if you think I'm cooking dinner  
Well, prepare to eat dead rat"  
As debbie said to alex  
As they held hands in the park  
"how come you wear rupert check  
When you think you're so hard"  
I should've done his land rover  
To let him know I'd been  
Instead I wrote "f' off"  
On the dirt across his screen  
And I can't put my finger on it  
Maybe it's something in their food  
And I cna't put my finger on it  
All I know is christ would've sued  
I wish I'd let them know that I was here  
A drop of arsenic in the wine  
Sulphuric acid in the beer
