This is the moment I've waited for  
I can hear my heart singing  
Soon bells will be ringing  
  
This is the moment of sweet aloha  
I will love you longer than forever  
Promise me that you will leave me never  
  
Here and now, dear  
All my love I vow, dear  
Promise me that you will leave me never  
I will love you longer than forever  
  
Now that we are one  
Clouds won't hide the sun  
Blue skies of hawaii smile  
On this, our wedding day  
  
(I do) I do  
(love you) love you  
With all my heart
