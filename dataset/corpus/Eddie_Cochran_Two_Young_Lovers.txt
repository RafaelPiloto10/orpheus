I saw two lovers walking along the sandy shore  
Her tiny hand was locked in his, two hearts beatin' a chord  
Two young lovers like you and I  
With young love that just won't die  
They stopped to pick a pebble, each one must make a wish  
They cast them out into the blue and sealed it with a kiss  
They stood beneath an elmtree, carved initials in a heart  
And pledged to undying love, which only death could part  
Two young lovers like you and I  
With young love that just won't die  
Just won't die, will not die, never die
