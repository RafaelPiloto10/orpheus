I don't know why my whole world came crashin' down,  
I just woke up in lonely town  
I opened up my eyes and much to my surprise  
Look at this heaven that I've found  
Don't need to care about tomorrow  
I got no pain, I got no sorrow  
  
I'm the last man on earth  
So tell me what it's worth  
Am I a beggar or a king?  
Got no trouble, got no time,  
Eternity is mine  
I got a whole lot of everything  
  
I can take this town  
And just burn it to the ground  
Smash every window that I see  
I can smoke, I can drink,  
I can swear, an' I can stink  
There ain't no one to bother me  
No, no  
  
Don't need to care about tomorrow  
I got not pain, I got no sorrow  
  
I'm the last man on earth,  
So tell me what it's worth  
Am I a beggar or a king?  
Got no trouble, got no time  
Eternity is mine  
I got a whole lot of everything  
It's all mine  
  
There's not a single soul to talk to me,  
But that's okay, I never liked them  
  
I'm the last man on earth  
And I know what it's worth  
I'm not a beggar, I'm a king  
Got no troubles, got no time,  
And everything is fine  
'Cause I'm the king of everything  
It's all mine  
Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine
