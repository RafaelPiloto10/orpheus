She's got the magic touch  
And you're walkin' around in a dream  
She's got the magic touch  
Oh no, but it ain't what it seems  
You feel there's a fire burnin'  
When she feels cold inside  
But you still want her much too much  
  
One day when she leaves you lonely  
You won't be satisfied (won't be satisfied)  
Until you feel her magic touch  
Her magic touch, her magic touch, her magic touch  
  
She's got the magic touch  
And you're under a spell that she's cast  
She's got the magic touch  
Oh no, but it ain't gonna last  
  
She's keepin' her love light shinin'  
To blind you from her lie (blind you from her lie)  
But you still need her oh so much  
  
And when she says she's leaving  
That's when you realize (when you realize)  
How much you need her magic touch  
Her magic touch, her magic touch, her magic touch  
  
And in the night in the crowd  
She'll be there  
As she prances by your watch  
While your dreams fade away  
  
She's got the magic touch  
And you're walkin' around in a dream  
She's got the magic touch  
Oh no, but it ain't what it seems  
  
One day when she leaves you lonely  
You'll miss her oh so much  
Until you feel her magic touch (feel her magic touch)  
Her magic touch, her magic touch  
(Feel her magic touch), her magic touch  
  
She's got the magic touch, I really want her  
She's got the magic touch, and I still need her  
She's got the magic touch, I really want her  
She's got the magic touch, and I really want her  
She's got the magic touch, and I still need her
