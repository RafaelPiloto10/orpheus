Morning this morning the curtains are shut  
I'll ring you in the morning but the phone's been cut  
Can you hear me I've been calling all day  
Can you hear me  
  
The radio reporter said the line's all dead  
He told me that I oughta write a letter instead  
Can you hear I've been calling all day  
Can you hear me  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'd wish they'd fix the wires cause my baby won't know  
That I'm leaving in the morning and I'm ready to go  
Can you hear me  
Can you hear me at all  
Gotta get the operator make a telephone call  
  
And if I write a letter it won't get there on time  
I'll only reach you baby on the telephone line  
Can you hear me  
I've been calling all day  
Can you hear me  
My car's already and my bags are all packed  
I'm late already and I won't be back  
Can you hear me  
I've been calling all day  
Can you hear me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh can you hear me
