In good old Queen Victoria's day  
Industrial revolution  
Bosses said 'Please, we need more employees'  
We needed a solution  
  
Who will climb our chimneys?  
Who will power our grids?  
Victorian families to desperately poor  
They'll let us employ their kids for  
  
Work, terible work  
From very young ages  
Up chimneys to clean  
Paid pitiful wages  
Work, terrible work  
Pins make you work faster  
If we grow too big  
Get sacked by the master!  
  
Now you're all in my employ  
Cleaning in the factory  
We're not very strong  
And the hours are long  
This work is unsatisfactory!  
  
There not to get caught in spokes  
Or trap our hands in gages  
To stop machines and get you out  
Will cost you a week's wages!  
  
Work, terrible work  
There's no health and safety  
So if we get hurt  
They will just replace me  
Work, terrible work  
  
Now that I am short of cash  
I have to pick pockets  
Wallets from gentlemen  
And lady's lockets  
  
Small enough to get away  
Hardly ever caught  
And if we are, we're kids you see  
To cry is what we're taught  
  
Work, terrible work  
Dangerous and demeaning  
No time to complain  
Get back to your cleaning  
Work, terrible work  
Guess what we are dreaming  
School, glorious school!  
Wonderful school!  
Marvellous school!  
Wish we went to school!
