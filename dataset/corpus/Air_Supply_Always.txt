I can see hills touch the sky  
Heaven and earth, you and I  
A world we will always be  
Here in the silence we lie  
Shadows we cast, you and I  
Speak for eternity  
  
[Chorus]  
Pressed between pages  
Flowers will die  
Stories may end as time passes by  
You and I will always be  
  
With every word that I hear  
Whenever whispers are near  
I can believe in fate  
Promises made, only one  
  
Yesterday fades from the sun  
And falls to a new embrace  
Years overflow  
As rivers run dry  
  
Here in a moment of time passing by  
You and I will always be, will always be  
  
[Chorus]
