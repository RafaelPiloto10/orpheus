The car that I drive, may not impress  
But I get where I need to go  
You may disagree, with the way that I dress (oooh)  
But I'm always comfortable  
My fortune and fame,  
Ain't no display, nobody has stick to myself  
And to be perfectly honest,  
I like it that way  
So it doesn't matter what you say  
I may not be who you want me to be  
All I can be is me  
I won't pretend,  
So baby take it or leave  
'Cause all I can be is me (all I can be, all I can be)  
All I can be is me (all I can be, all I can be)  
All I can be is me  
What you get is what you see  
'Cause all I can be is me  
(Ohhh, yeah, yeah)  
Sometimes I prefer to just stay at home  
Don't need that fancy restaurant  
Sometimes I would rather turn the tv on,  
Simple is all I want  
Why put on a mask?  
Why be all a vision?  
There's never a reason  
I'm happy with me,  
My life's not in mission  
I'm ok with who I'm bein'  
Though I may not be who you want me to be  
But all I can be is me  
I won't pretend,  
So baby take it or leave  
'Cause all I can be is me (all I can be, all I can be)  
All I can be is me (all I can be, all I can be)  
Said all I can be is me  
What you get is what you see  
'Cause all I can be is me  
(Ooohh)  
Money, cars, and diamond rings  
All those expensive things  
Baby I just don't give a damn  
But if you really love me,  
Like you say you'd love me  
Then baby take me as I am  
(Heeeey)  
Though I may not be who you want me to be.  
But all I can be is me.  
I won't pretend,  
So baby take it or leave. (hey)  
'Cause all I can be is me (all I can be, all I can be)  
All I can be is me. (all I can be, all I can be)  
Said all I can be is me.  
What you get is what you see  
'Cause all I can be is me
