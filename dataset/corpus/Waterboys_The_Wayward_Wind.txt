In a lonesome shack by the railroad track  
I spent my younger days  
And I guess the sound of the outward bound  
Made me a slave  
To my wandering queen  
  
And the wayward wind  
is a restless wind  
A restless wind  
that yearns to wander  
And I was born  
next of kin  
The next of kin  
to the wayward wind  
  
I met her down in a border town  
we swore we'd never part  
Though I tried my best to settle down  
now she's all alone  
With a broken heart  
  
And the wayward wind  
is a restless wind  
A restless wind  
that yearns to wander  
And I was born  
the next of kin  
The next of kin  
to the wayward wind  
  
And the wayward wind  
is a restless wind  
A restless wind  
that yearns to wander  
And I was born  
the next of kin  
The next of kin  
to the wayward wind  
  
The next of kin  
to the wayward, wayward wind
