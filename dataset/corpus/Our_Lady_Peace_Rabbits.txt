See the light in the distance  
Ten seconds from sleep  
If you blink you could miss it  
Voluntarily  
If it's home that you're missing  
Better call the police  
  
[Chorus]  
Hopelessly lost at sea  
The holes we dig to survive  
Like rabbits we run  
  
Gonna join the resistance  
Gonna tighten that leash  
Try and find some persistence  
Temporarily  
If it's home that you're missing  
Better ramp up your speed  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Like rabbits we run  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
The light of day  
The dark of night  
We hide in our heads keeping our dreams alive  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
Like rabbits we run
