Everytime I say I wanna go  
I can see you gonna cry  
Everytime I say I wanna go  
I can tell you gonna cry  
Thinking of the lonely nights  
( when I' m not there )  
Thinking of the days  
( when I' ve gone )  
Thousands of people  
Wanna see me  
Millions are waiting  
For the message  
Billions are dying  
For the message  
I am going round the world  
Spreading the message  
I am going round the world  
Spreading the word  
Don' t cry baby, don' t cry  
  
Chorus:  
Don' t cry  
  
They wanna hear me saying!  
Ayobayo  
They wanna hear me hear me say  
I' ve got you babe  
They wanna hear me sayin  
Together as one  
They wanna hear me say  
I' m a slave
