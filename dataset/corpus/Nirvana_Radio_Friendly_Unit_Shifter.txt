Use just once and destroy  
Invasion of our piracy  
Afterbirth of a nation  
Starve without your skeleton key  
  
I love you for what I am not  
I do not want what I have got  
A blanket acne'ed with ciggarette burns  
Speak at once while taking turns  
Second-rate third defree burns  
What is wrong with me  
What is what I need  
What do I think I think  
This had nothing to do with what you think  
If you ever think at all  
Bi-polar opposites attract  
All of a sudden my water broke  
Hate, hate your enemies  
Save, save your friends  
Find, find your place  
Speak, speak the truth
