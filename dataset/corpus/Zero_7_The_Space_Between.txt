Now that you're older  
Taking the time to look  
Back over your shoulder  
On the days confusion took  
  
Now that you're wiser  
Surely you've learned to read it  
You should know  
No surface shines brighter  
Than the light that burns beneath it  
  
Never so sure  
We always take more  
Though we still don't know what it's for  
  
Now that I've seen you  
Stripped to the very core  
I know that I need you  
Less than I did before  
  
Never so sure  
We always take more  
Though we still don't know what it's for
