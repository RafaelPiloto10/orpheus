Isn't there anyone  
Who'll take me like I am?  
Someone who's willing  
To take the blue in man  
Someone that's pleased enough  
With himself to let me be  
Someone who'd love me  
And try to understand my needs  
No, I guess there isn't  
And there's no place  
I can go I guess  
I'm destined to be alone  
Good thing that somewhere  
In this world there'll be  
Someone who wouldn't  
Always try to change me  
Someone not trying to prove  
Their way is right  
Take a flame that's burnin?  
And just put out the light  
No, I guess there isn't  
And there's no place  
I can go I guess  
I'm destined to be alone
