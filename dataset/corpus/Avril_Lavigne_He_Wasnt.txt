There's not much going on today  
I'm really bored, it's getting late  
What happened to my Saturday? (Saturday)  
Monday's coming, the day I hate, hate  
  
Sit on the bed alone (Bed alone)  
Staring at the phone  
  
He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought, no  
He wouldn't even open up the door  
He never made me feel like I was special  
He isn't really what I'm looking for  
  
Hey, hey, hey  
Hey, hey, hey  
  
This is when I start to bite my nails  
And clean my room when all else fails  
I think it's time for me to bail (Time to bail)  
This point of view is getting stale-ale  
  
Sit on the bed alone (Bed alone)  
Staring at the phone (At the phone)  
  
He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought no  
He wouldn't even open up the door  
He never made me feel like I was special  
He isn't really what I'm looking for  
  
Uh, uh (hey, hey)  
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh (hey, hey)  
Uh, uh, hey, hey  
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh (hey, hey)  
  
Na, na, na, na, na (we've all got choices)  
Na, na, na ,na (we've all got voices)  
Na, na, na, na, na (stand up make some noise)  
Na, na, na, na (stand up make some noise)  
  
Sit on the bed alone  
Staring at the phone  
  
He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought no  
He wouldn't even open up the door  
He never made me feel like I was special  
He isn't really what I'm looking for  
  
He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought no  
He wouldn't even open up the door  
He never made me feel like I was special  
Like I was special, 'cause I was special  
  
Uh, uh  
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh  
Uh, uh  
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh  
Na, na, na, na, na
