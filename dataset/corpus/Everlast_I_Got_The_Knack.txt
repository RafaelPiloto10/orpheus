(You got it)  
(You) (you) (you) (you got it)  
(You got it)  
(You got it)  
(You) (you) (you got it)  
(You got it)  
Get up everybody and listen to this rhyme  
My name is Everlast and yo, I'm always on time  
I got what it takes to make this groove complete  
And when my DJ is cuttin, he's never missin a beat  
I'm down with the Syndicate and they're down with me  
I'm also down with Divine, Bilal and Quincy D.  
Tairrie B., DJ Lethal and my brother cool Nick  
Kid Jazz, Scratch, Bango and Cutmaster Quick  
I've worked hard and long to master this trade  
And to quote my other song yo, I'm just out to get paid  
So sleep on me now for my time will come  
Everlast lasts forever, that's why I'm number one  
I got the knack  
(You got it)  
(You know I feel alright)  
I got the knack  
(You got it)  
(You know I feel alright)  
I got the knack  
(You got it)  
(You know I feel alright)  
I got the knack  
(You got it)  
(You know I feel alright)  
Everlast is in effect  
Gettin big respect  
Then I collect big checks  
1's, 5's, 10's, 20's  
100 g's and I'm pullin honeys  
Left and right, day and night  
You gotta see it to believe it, it's quite a sight  
They're all on my tip to get a sip  
Of this poetical performer that's fully equipped  
But I'm out to get paid, not to get laid  
All across the country my records gettin played  
On radio stations, clubs and on tours  
And after every show I make three encores  
Sleep on me now for my time will come  
Everlast last forever, that's why I'm number one  
I got the knack  
(You got it)  
(You know I feel alright)  
I got the knack  
(You got it)  
(You know I feel alright)  
I got the knack  
(You got it)  
(You know I feel alright)  
I got the knack  
(Ah yeah)  
(Hit me)  
(Alright)  
(Check this out)  
Step up, place your bet and I'll serve you fortune  
But first I must issue just one word of caution  
Dope lyric presentations are my sole notoriety  
Everlast is on the rise movin through society  
My voice is moist recitin choice vocals  
Respected worldwide and feared by locals  
Poppin junk out your punk mouth makin bets  
It's too late for regrets, it's time to pay your debts  
E-v-e-are-l-a-s-t is the name that I bear  
A poetic demi-god with skin that's fair  
So sleep on me now for my time will come  
Everlast lasts forever, that's why I'm number one  
I got the knack  
(You got it)  
(You know I feel alright)  
I got the knack  
(You got it)  
(You know I feel alright)  
I got the knack  
(You got it)  
(You know I feel alright)  
I got the knack  
(You got it)  
(You know I feel alright)  
Now there's too many people in this world tryin to play me  
Like I'm some kind of sucker constantly they disobey me  
Tellin me what's sellin, what kinda records get charted  
Sound like him, sound like her - but they all sound retarded  
Takin very little time to write down a rhyme  
It's confusing to see so many people so blind  
Some think that it's a sell-out rhymin to this beat  
But Everlast can take any groove and make it sound complete  
I got the knack
