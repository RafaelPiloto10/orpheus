Well, it ain't hard to see you've got the blues  
Come hold on to me, and I'll comfort you  
A pretty little angel with a heavy heart  
Well, tryin' to carry on is the hardest part.  
  
Love will fool ya, it'll do you wrong  
Shout hallelujah when the clouds are gone  
'Cause you know pretty baby, the sun's gonna shine on you  
The sun's gonna shine on you.  
  
I miss that little sparkle on your face  
That pretty little smile that has been replaced  
Have a little faith, baby just be still  
'Cause things are gonna be just the way they will.  
  
Love will fool ya, it'll do you wrong  
Shout hallelujah when the clouds are gone  
'Cause you know pretty baby, when you ain't lookin'  
The sun's gonna shine on you.  
The sun's gonna shine on you.  
  
Love will fool ya, it'll do you wrong  
Shout hallelujah when the clouds are gone  
'Cause you know pretty baby, when you ain't lookin'  
And you ain't ready, the sun's gonna shine on you  
The sun's gonna shine on you...
