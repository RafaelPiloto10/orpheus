There's a saying old says that love is blind  
Still were often told "seek and you shall find"  
So I'm going to seek a certain girl I've had in mind  
Looking everywhere haven't found her yet  
  
She's the big affair I cannot forget  
Only girl I ever think of with regret  
I'd like to add her initial to my monogram  
Tell me where is the shepherdess for this lost lamb?  
  
There's a somebody I'm longing to see  
I hope that she turns out to be  
Someone who'll watch over me  
  
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood  
I know I could always be good  
To one who'll watch over me  
Although I may not be the man some girls think of as handsome  
  
To her heart I carry the key  
Won't you tell her please to put on some speed, follow my lead  
Oh, how I need someone who'll watch over me  
  
There's a somebody I'm longing to see
