Living to get his freak on, ooh ee  
Sporting his leopard skin thong, ooh ee  
Charlie the methadone man  
Plays Sunday nights in a rock n' roll band  
Charlie the metronome, the methadone man  
Patience, the name of the game, ooh ee  
Waiting on Doctor Kinkaid, ooh ee  
Charlie the methadone man  
Fills out the papers just as fast as he can  
Charlie the methadone, the methadone man  
When you're all alone and you got no where to go  
Better take it slow, oh you get so tired of where you are  
Kicking his lonely lit brain, ooh ee  
Drinking to try and stay sane, ooh ee  
Charlie the methadone man  
Chases his tail just as fast as he can  
Charlie the methadone, the methadone man  
Oh, Charlie the methadone, methadone man  
Waitin'
