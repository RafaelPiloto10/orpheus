Sweet Jesus, my Savior  
You are my faithful friend  
You made me, You know me  
And You see my every sin  
  
And my soul is amazed  
By this gift of Your grace  
And these arms that take me in  
  
Sweet Jesus, my Savior  
You are my faithful friend  
  
Sweet Jesus, my shelter  
You are my faithful friend  
The refuge that I run to  
When my world comes closing in  
  
Why should I be afraid  
When I know I am saved  
By the arms that take me in  
  
Sweet Jesus, my shelter  
You are my faithful friend, oh yeah  
  
Sweet Jesus, my shepherd  
You are my faithful friend  
You hold me, You lead me  
I'll follow till the end  
  
And once more I will say  
On that beautiful day  
When Your arms take me in  
  
Sweet Jesus, my shepherd  
You are my faithful friend  
Sweet Jesus, my Savior  
You are my faithful friend
