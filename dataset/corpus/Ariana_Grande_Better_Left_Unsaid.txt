I told you once, "Get out my life.  
I don't need ya, I'll be alright."  
But some things are better left unsaid (said said)  
So tell the truth, and hit me hard  
A broken heart is all I have now, but  
Some things are better left unsaid (said said)  
  
And I swore that I would never say  
I miss you more every day  
But some things are better left unsaid  
Are better left unsaid  
Said  
Said  
  
Oh-ooh-whoa-ooh-oh-oh  
I'm gonna say please  
?  
Oh-ooh-whoa-ooh-oh-oh  
Tonight I'm gonna loose ?  
Don't play me just kiss me.  
  
If you wanna party, put your hands up  
Put your hands up put your hands up  
Don't play me just kiss me.  
Oh-ooh-whoa-ooh-oh-oh  
Tonight I'll say ?  
Don't play me just kiss me, babe  
  
You tell a lie, plan tonight  
Too many drinks  
So many reasons that some things are better left unsaid  
  
And I swore that I would never say  
I miss you more every day  
But some things are better left unsaid  
Are better left unsaid,  
Said
