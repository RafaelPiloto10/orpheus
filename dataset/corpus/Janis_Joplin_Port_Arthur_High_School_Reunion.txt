What do you think about your town since you've left and come back ?  
It's fantastic! I was across the river from the club last night, I never had
more fun in my life! except sometimes in california I have more fun.  
Do you plan to come back soon ?  
Oh ? er, er, er, I have no immediate plans, ha ha ha!!  
Did you entertain in high school, at the high school, when you went back at
the high school ?  
Only when I walked down the aisles, man. no, I did, no, I was, er, I was a
painter, and a sort of a recluse in high school. I've changed.

How were you different from your schoolmates when you were a teenager ?  
I don't know, why don't you ask them ?  
Did they make you different ?  
No.  
Otherwise were you different in comparison with them, or were you ?  
I felt apart from them.  
Did you take a part in football games ?  
I think not. I didn't go to the high school prom, and er ...  
Oh, you were asked, weren't you ?  
No, I wasn't. I don't think, I don't think they wanted to take me. till I'll
be a hundred and sufferin'! it's enough to make you wanna sing the blues!
