I've been sitting here for many days now  
They've been looking for me for many days too  
From where I' m sitting  
I can see their angry faces  
It' s only a matter of time  
They' ll be on to me  
The sirens, helicopters and tings  
The bloodhounds are on my tail, Oh God  
Just in minutes  
They' ll be tearing me apart  
If I don' t do now  
What I've been doing all my life  
I' ll be running...all my life  
  
[Chorus:]  
I' m the running man  
The fugitive  
  
Seeking political asylum is not easy down here FONT
