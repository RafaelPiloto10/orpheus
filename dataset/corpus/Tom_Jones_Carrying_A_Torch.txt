I'm carrying a torch for you  
I'm carrying a torch  
You know how much it costs  
To keep carrying a torch  
  
Flame of love it burens so bright  
That is my desire  
Keep on liftin' me, liftin' me up  
Higher and higher  
  
You're the keeper of the flame  
Girl, you burn so bright  
Baby, why don't we reconnect?  
Move into the light  
  
I've been going to and fro on this  
And I'm still carrying a torch  
You must know how much it's worth  
But I'm carrying a torch  
  
Baby, you're the keeper of the flame  
And you burn so bright  
Why, why, why, why, why, why  
Why don't we reconnect  
And move on further into the light?  
  
I've been calling you on the phone  
'Cause I'm carrying a torch  
I can't do it all on my own  
'Cause I'm carrying a torch  
  
I'm carrying a torch for you, baby  
I'm carrying a torch  
You know how much it's worth  
When I'm carrying a torch  
  
I'm carrying a torch for you, baby  
I'm carrying a torch  
You know how much it's worth  
When I'm carrying a torch
