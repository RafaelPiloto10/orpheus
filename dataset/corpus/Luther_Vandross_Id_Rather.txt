I thought sometime alone  
Was what we really needed  
You said this time would hurt more than it helps  
But I couldn't see that  
I thought it was the end  
Of a beautiful story  
And so I left the one I loved at home to be alone(alone)  
And I tried to find  
Out if this one thing is true  
That I'm nothing without you  
I know better now  
And I've had a change of heart  
  
I'd rather have bad times with you, than good times with someone else  
I'd rather be beside you in a storm, than safe and warm by myself  
I'd rather have hard times together, than to have it easy apart  
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart  
Whoo-oo-oo-oo yeah  
  
And then I met someone  
And thought she could replace you  
We got a long just fine  
We wasted time because she was not you  
We had a lot of fun  
Though we knew we were faking  
Love was not impressed with our connection they were all lies, all lies  
So I'm here cause I found this one thing is true  
That I'm nothing without you  
I know better now  
And I've had a change of heart  
  
I'd rather have bad times with you, than good times with someone else  
I'd rather be beside you in a storm, than safe and warm by myself  
I'd rather have hard times together, than to have it easy apart  
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart  
Who holds my heart  
  
I can't blame you if you turn away from me, like I've done you,  
I can only prove the things I say with time,  
Please be mine,  
  
I'd rather have bad times with(please be mine) you,  
Than good times with someone else(I know)  
I'd rather be beside you in a storm(anytime),  
Than safe and warm by myself(so sure baby)  
I'd rather have hard times to gether,  
Than to have it easy apart  
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart(my heart)  
  
I'd rather have bad times with you(surely),  
Than good times with someone else(surely)  
I'd rather be beside you in a storm(oh yeah),  
Than safe and warm by myself(all by myself)  
I'd rather have hard times together,  
Than to have it easy apart(you know it)  
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart  
  
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart  
I'd rather have the one who holds my heart  
Whooo who holds my heart
