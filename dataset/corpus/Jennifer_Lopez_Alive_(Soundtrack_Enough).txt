Time, goes, slowly now in my life  
Fear, no more of what I'm not sure  
  
[Hook:]  
Searchin' to feel your soul  
The strength to stand alone  
The power of not knowing and letting go  
  
[Chorus:]  
I guess I've found my way  
It's simple when it's right  
Feeling lucky just to be here tonight  
And happy just to be me and be alive  
  
Love, in and out on my, my heart  
And though life can be strange  
I can't be afraid  
  
[Hook:]  
Searchin' to feel your soul  
The strength to stand alone  
The power of not knowing  
And letting go  
  
[Chorus:]  
I guess I've found my way  
It's simple when it's right  
Feeling lucky just to be here tonight  
And happy just to be me and be alive  
  
I guess I've found my way  
It's simple when it's right  
Feeling lucky just to be here tonight  
And happy just to be me and be alive
