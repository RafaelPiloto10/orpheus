I believe in there's a world down under  
Yeah yeah hey  
I believe in there's a world down under  
  
Wave after wave  
There's no wall for emotions now for me  
Infinity all day long  
Dream after dream  
Had to live in the presence not in the past  
At least a part will last  
  
All I need is love but love's not easy to find  
'Cause I'm saying all the time to all like this  
  
I believe in there's a world down under  
Where my heroes are playing with Alice  
I'm not alone  
I have been there in a world down under  
Live the dream out today, hey  
  
I know, it's hard  
To be seen as a person when you play  
Alice in Wonderland  
Are kind of figures  
That speak to them  
You don't understand  
What's driven me to that land  
  
All I need is love but love's not easy to find  
All in all I'm saying all the time to all  
  
I believe in there's a world down under  
Where my heroes are playing with Alice  
I'm not alone  
I have been there in a world down under  
Live the dream out today, hey  
  
I believe in there's a world down under  
Where my heroes are playing with Alice  
I'm not alone  
I have been there in a world down under  
Live the dream out today, hey  
  
I believe  
I believe (yeah yeah)  
Na na na na na na na  
  
I believe in there's a world down under (na na na na na na na)  
Where my heroes are playing with Alice  
I'm not alone (ooh yeah)  
I have been there in a world down under  
Live the dream out today, hey  
  
I believe in there's a world down under (there's a world down under)  
Where my heroes are playing with Alice  
I'm not alone  
I have been there in a world down under  
Live the dream out today, hey
