[Verse 1]  
I could search for all my life and find no one like You  
I believe You have the power to make this life brand new  
Troubles come and You are there to heal my broken heart  
There is nothing in this world that could tear us apart  
  
[Chorus]  
It doesn't matter what the world says  
We will live for You  
Come whatever we'll live for You  
Forever and ever  
King of Kings, You're everything, everything  
Jesus we will worship You  
Forever and ever  
All of our days  
We give You praise, give You praise  
  
[Verse 2]  
You are God over everything and on Your word we will stand  
Take control over all of me, my life is in Your hands  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Tag]  
No weapon formed against me shall prosper  
No weapon formed against me shall prosper  
You have made a way  
  
[Chorus]
