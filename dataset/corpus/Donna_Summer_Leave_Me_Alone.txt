Say you dominate you can never wait  
To listen to the things that I have got to say  
You're amorous, polygamous  
And that's okay as long as I don't start to play  
  
Say listen good  
You know you should  
Paradise is built inside an hour glass  
I'm feminine but that don't mean  
That I would want to travel second class  
  
Leave me alone 'cause I've got my rhythm (yeah)  
Leave me alone 'cause I've got my life  
Leave me alone 'cause I've got my rhythm  
Just leave me alone  
Just leave me alone  
Leave me alone if you want to stay mine  
Leave me alone  
  
Now I am you and you are me  
The signs are right and it will fit eventually  
It's hard to take you'd better break  
A habit that has ruled for an eternity  
  
It's your concern you'd better learn  
I'll never belong to you or any other man  
Take what I give and go and live  
With someone else if you don't understand  
  
Leave me alone 'cause I've got my rhythm  
Leave me alone 'cause I've got my life  
Leave me alone 'cause I've got my rhythm  
Just leave me alone  
Leave me alone  
Leave me alone if you want to stay mine  
Leave me alone  
  
Leave me alone if you want to stay mine for awhile  
Leave me alone if you want to stay mine for awhile  
  
Just leave me alone  
You think you're hot stuff  
You think you're so cool
