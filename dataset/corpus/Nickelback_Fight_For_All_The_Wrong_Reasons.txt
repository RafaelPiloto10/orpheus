Well, I wanted you  
I wanted no one else  
I thought it through  
I got you to myself  
You got off  
Every time you got onto me  
I got caught up  
In favorable slavery  
  
[Chorus]  
I guess it wasn't really right  
I guess it wasn't meant to be  
It didn't matter what they said  
Cause we were good in bed  
I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight  
For all the wrong reasons  
No, it didn't matter what I tried  
It's just a little hard to leave  
When you're going down on me  
I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight  
For all the wrong reasons  
  
Well, you know my friends  
They know your enemies  
And I'd pretend  
Not to hear what they said to me  
Cause I got off  
Every time you got onto me  
Was it wrong  
To go along with insanity?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I guess it wasn't what, it wasn't really what I thought  
I thought it was the day I got, I want it all to go away  
I guess it wasn't what, it wasn't really what I thought  
I thought it was the day I got, I want it all to go away  
I guess it wasn't what, it wasn't really what I thought  
I thought it was the day I got, I want it all to go away  
I guess it wasn't what, it wasn't really what I thought  
I thought it was the day I got, I want it all to go away  
  
[Chorus]
