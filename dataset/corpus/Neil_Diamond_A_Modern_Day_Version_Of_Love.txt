And the night was filled with laughter  
Echoing through painted smiles  
And I knew each morning after  
I never loved, was never touched  
Gave not at all, got back as much  
In the co-o-omfort of  
A modern day version of lo-o-ove  
  
Truly, how I've cursed the sweet taste  
Of lips that ask so-o much of me  
Still I wonder with every embrace  
Could I give, and not break  
Should I care, and forsake  
All the co-o-omfort of  
A modern day version of lo-o-ove  
  
Close my eyes and keep on runnin'  
Realise it isn't gonna work anymor-ore  
For me, yeah-eah  
I'm afraid, well maybe that's somethin'  
Never cared enough to be afraid of anything  
Before, not before ...  
  
Baffled child on streets of sinner  
Sleeping child, a morning call  
Playful spring, look face the winter  
Take thy hand, taste the kiss  
Leave behind, emptiness  
And the co-o-omfort of  
A modern day version of lo-o-ove
