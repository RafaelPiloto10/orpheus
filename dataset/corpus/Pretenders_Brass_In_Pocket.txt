Got brass in pocket  
Got bottle I'm gonna use it  
Intention I feel inventive  
Gonna make you, make you, make you notice  
  
Got motion restrained emotion  
Been driving Detroit leaning  
No reason just seems so pleasing  
Gonna make you, make you, make you notice  
  
Gonna use my arms  
Gonna use my legs  
Gonna use my style  
Gonna use my sidestep  
Gonna use my fingers  
Gonna use my, my, my imagination  
  
'Cause I gonna make you see  
There's nobody else here  
No one like me  
I'm special so special  
I gotta have some of your attention give it to me  
  
Got rhythm I can't miss a beat  
Got new skank it's so reet  
Got something I'm winking at you  
Gonna make you, make you, make you notice  
  
Gonna use my arms  
Gonna use my legs  
Gonna use my style  
Gonna use my sidestep  
Gonna use my fingers  
Gonna use my, my, my imagination  
  
'Cause I gonna make you see  
There's nobody else here  
No one like me  
I'm special, so special  
I gotta have some of your attention  
Give it to me  
'Cause I gonna make you see  
There's nobody else here  
No one like me  
I'm special, so special  
I gotta have some of your attention  
  
Give it to me
