Hold me... Let me dry those tears for you  
Be the healer... Of your heart he broke in two  
I wanna hold you close....  
But somethin' tells me to wait  
Is it too soon to touch,  
To reach for the love that you hide away...  
Talk to me... Tell me with your eyes  
What did he do... To make you feel this way inside  
  
Chorus:  
  
Empty words, and promises made  
I'm not that way  
Come to me and don't be afraid  
I'm not that way  
  
Silence... Was meant to be broken  
Like waves on the shore  
Let your tears wash away these emotions  
I can't change the world,  
I can change your mind...  
I'll always be here, for you until you realize  
  
Empty words, and promises made  
I'm not that way  
Broken trust... A failure in faith  
I'm not that way  
I'm not that way  
  
Cause life's too short for waistin'  
Waistin' precious time  
If time is what you need baby  
I'll give you all of mine  
One day you're gonna look at me  
And love is what you'll find...  
  
Empty words, and promises made  
I'm not that way  
Come to me  
Bring back your faith  
Don't be afraid  
I'm not that way  
I'm not that way  
  
I want to hold you  
I want to hold you close  
Let me hear your heart baby
