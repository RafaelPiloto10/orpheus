Whispers, potions, puppet with needles  
Whispers, potions, puppet with needles  
Black night, right time  
It's all about, it's voodoonight  
Can't you feel it  
Strangers surround the voodoospell  
But you saw them close your mind  
Don't listen  
'cause big zombie makes a night of it  
We're all here and break the spell  
Don't follow him  
Big zombie seeks a bride tonight  
Voodoonight  
Voodoonight  
Whispers, potions, puppet with needles  
Whispers, potions, puppet with needles  
Witchcraft, magic  
Odd songs to hear, it's voodoonight  
Does it haunt you  
The fatefull wish of voodoospell  
Voodoonight  
Voodoonight  
Voodoonight  
Voodoonight  
Voodoonight
