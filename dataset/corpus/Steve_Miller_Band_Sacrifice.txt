Thought about the folks back home  
All those miles that we had roamed  
Still can see your pretty hair  
When I come back will you be there  
You flew away like a kite  
I hope you find your light  
I pray they treat you right  
What a sacrifice  
  
Miles and miles I have roamed  
Lookin' for that home sweet home  
Thought I had the love with you  
But I found out that you weren't true  
You made me feel so nice  
Ready for wedding rice  
Then you said no dice  
What a sacrifice  
  
Lookin' back on time that's gone  
I realized I might have been wrong  
But Macon took you for a ride  
They broke us up for their own pride  
But you were young and didn't understand  
That you had found your lifetime man  
Maybe someday you'll see  
It gets so lonely being free  
So don't be wrong twice  
What a sacrifice
