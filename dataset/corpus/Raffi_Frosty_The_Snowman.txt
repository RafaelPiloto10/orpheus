Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul  
With a corn cob pipe and a button nose  
And two eyes made out of coal  
  
'Frosty the snowman' is a fairy tale they say  
He was made of snow  
But the children know how he came to life one day  
  
There must have been some magic in  
That ol' silk hat they found  
For when they placed it on his head  
He began to dance around, oh  
  
Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be  
And the children say, he could laugh and play  
Just the same as you and me  
  
Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day  
So he said, Let's run and we'll have some fun  
Now before I melt away  
  
Down to the village with a broom stick in his hand  
Runnin' here and there all around the square  
Sayin', Catch me if you can  
  
He led them down the streets of town  
Right to the traffic cop  
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler stop or  
  
Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way  
But he waved goodbye sayin', Don't you cry  
I'll be back again some day  
  
Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump  
Look at Frosty go  
Thumpety thump thump, thumpety thump thump  
Over the hills of snow
