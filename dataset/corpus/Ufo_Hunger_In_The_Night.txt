There's a heart flight of a neon moon In the darkness of this shuttered room  
Watch out  
Easy for some action holy satisfaction ooh  
Midnight makes a call skin begins to crawl  
Inside the heights upon the fantasies  
Let me introduce you now  
I'm gonna let you see the other side of me  
There's a hunger in the night moves me completely  
Hunger in the night bleeds so sweetly  
(it's) a hunger in the night moves me completely  
The hunger in the night bleeds so sweetly  
Through the shadows you won't hear a thing  
Cloaked in darkness my love's a deadly sting  
Watch out  
Comes in through the fence, sliding in the shiv  
Want to be a hero situation's zero  
Inside the heights upon the fantasies  
Let me introduce you now I'm gonna let you see the other side of me  
Chorus  
As i lie me down to sleep, with the lord my soul to keep  
If i die before i wake, will the lord my soul to take  
This life has no distance, between the line and another day  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
The hunger in the night moves me completely  
Hunger in the night, bleeds so sweetly  
Hunger in the night, damned if you see me  
Hunger in the night, come and see me
