Morning sunlight on her face  
As he wakes her with a kiss  
She's been everything he wanted  
  
They were married as high school sweethearts  
Never dreamed it'd be like this  
Finding nothing for them comes easy  
  
Trying hard just to make a living  
Seems life won't give them a break  
Well as long as they've got each other  
Ooh, they'll find a way  
  
There's a better life  
Waiting out there somewhere  
They gotta learn to fly  
Need to spread their wings to soar  
There's a better life  
They'll find it together (keep holding on)  
She shows him rainbows every time he sees her smile  
  
They've been more than lovers  
There's no mountain they can't climb  
Can't stop dreaming dreams together  
  
Gotta rise above the crossroads  
Beyond the streets they were born  
To a place where prayers are answered  
And battles are won  
  
There's a better life  
Waiting out there somewhere  
They gotta learn to fly  
Need to spread their wings to soar  
There's a better life  
They'll find it together  
They keep holding on  
It only makes them strong  
They wanna learn to fly  
  
Gotta arise above the crossroads  
Beyond the streets they were born  
To a place where prayers are answered  
And battles are won  
  
There's a better life  
Waiting out there somewhere  
They gotta learn to fly  
Need to spread their wings to soar  
There's a better life  
They'll find it together (keep holding on)  
She shows him rainbows every time he sees her smile  
  
There's a better life  
(Waiting somewhere)  
They gotta learn to fly
