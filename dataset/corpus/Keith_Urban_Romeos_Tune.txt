Meet me in the middle of the day  
Let me hear you say everything's okay  
Bring me southern kisses from your room  
  
Meet me in the middle of the night  
Let me hear you say everything's alright  
Let me smell the moon in your perfume  
  
Oh, Gods and years will rise and fall  
And there's always something more  
It's lost in talk, I waste my time  
  
And it's all been said before  
  
While further down behind the masquerade the tears are there  
I don't ask for all that much I just want someone to care  
That's right now  
  
Meet me in the middle of the day  
Let me hear you say everything's okay  
Come on out beneath the shining sun  
  
Meet me in the middle of the night  
Let me hear you say everything's alright  
Sneak on out beneath the stars and run  
  
Oh yeah, oh yeah yeah, oh yeah  
  
It's king and queen and we must go down now beyond the chandelier  
Where I won't have to speak my mind and you won't have to hear  
Shreds of news and afterthoughts and complicated scenes  
We'll huddle down behind the light and fade like magazines  
  
Meet me in the middle of the day  
Let me hear you say everything's okay  
Bring me southern kisses from your room  
  
Hey hey, meet me in the middle of the night  
Let me hear you say everything's alright  
Let me smell the moon in your perfume  
  
Oh now, meet me in the middle of the day  
Let me hear you say everything's okay  
Let me see you smiling back at me  
  
Hey, meet me in the middle of the night  
Let me hear you say everything's alright  
Hold me tight and love and loving's free  
  
Woah yeah
