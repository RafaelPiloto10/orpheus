The workers they come back from their day in the field  
Jennifer dances and she cooks me a meal  
A little less salt in the gravy tonight  
  
You ought to know from long ago  
To listen to the winds that blow  
Cause when the past creeps up at last  
You see the landscape open fast  
And you'll be standing on a landing  
Crumbling despite your demanding  
And in the pan the (?)  
Tears will fall and tears will bawl  
  
You always knew the winds that blew  
The workers they come back from their day in the field  
The workers they come back from their day in the field  
The workers they come back from their day in the field  
  
You always knew the winds that blew  
The workers they come back from their day in the field  
The workers they come back from their day in the field  
(Jennifer dances)  
The workers they come back from their day in the field  
(Jennifer dances)  
  
Jennifer dances  
Jennifer dances  
Jennifer dances  
Jennifer dances
