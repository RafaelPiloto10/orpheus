I've read the bible, I've read Dylan,  
I'm reading people now  
Because it is much more chilling  
I sit on a satellite  
With the stars made of gold  
There's life through that hollow lens  
I know supersatellite  
I watch the traffic,  
I find the seeds  
There's one man in particular  
Who's not what he seems  
I can't focus in  
On the lies in his head  
He's convinced that his blood is blue  
But it's red  
Supersatellite  
Nothing dazzles me,  
I am in his dreams  
Nothing is shocking,  
Transparent human being  
On the soul inside the world  
Far better than the eye inside the mind  
Fuck you, I am you, you hear me  
Stop crying, stop crying
