The girl at the bar, she bought me a beer  
And she'd like to know if I'm new around here  
And the gal that I danced with says she's all alone  
Her friends have all left and she needs a ride home  
  
Oh and there have been others who gave me the eye  
But if they only knew they were wasting their time  
'Cause there's only one lover I can give my heart to  
But you didn't want it and you broke it in two  
  
(So tell me) which one of them will you be tonight  
Oh which one will hold me in your arms so tight  
I've forgotten what's wrong, given up on what's right  
(Tell me) which one of them will you be tonight  
  
So I'll just smile and pretend and she'll never know  
Who she's up against when she's holdin' me close  
You're all that I want, girl, your all that I need  
And when I close my eyes, honey you're all that I see  
  
(So tell me) which one of them will you be tonight  
Oh which one will hold me in your arms so tight  
I've forgotten what's wrong, given up on what's right  
(Tell me) which one of them will you be tonight
