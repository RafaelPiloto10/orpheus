Hot winds and hunger cries--Ethiopia  
Flies in your babies' eyes--Ethiopia  
Walking sticks on burning plains  
Betrayed by politics  
Abandoned by the rains  
On and on, the human need  
On and on, the human greed profanes  
Ethiopia, Ethiopia, Ethiopia  
  
Your top soil flies away--Ethiopia  
We pump ours full of poison spray--Ethiopia  
Between the brown skies and sprinkling lawns  
I hear the whine of chain saws  
Hacking rain forests down  
On and on, insanities  
On and on, short sighted greed abounds  
Ethiopia, Ethiopia, Ethiopia  
  
Little garden planet-oasis in space  
Some hearts hurt, they can hardly stand it  
Famine phantoms at the garden gates  
Ethiopia, Ethiopia, Ethiopia  
  
Every Sunday on T.V. Ethiopia  
You suffer with such dignity Ethiopia  
A T.V. star with a P.R. smile  
Calls your baby "it" while strolling  
Through your tragic trials  
On and on, stupidity  
On and on, the basic needs are defiled  
Good air, good water, good earth  
Ethiopia, Ethiopia, Ethiopia  
  
Little garden planet, oasis in space  
Some hearts hurt, they can hardly stand the waste  
Ethiopia, Ethiopia, Ethiopia
