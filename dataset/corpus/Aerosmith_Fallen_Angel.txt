Theres a candle burning in the world tonight  
For another child who vanished out of sight  
And a heart is broken, another prayer in vain  
Theres a million tears that fill a sea of pain  
Sometimes I stare out my window  
My thoughts all drift into space  
Sometimes I wonder if theres a better place  
(Tell me)  
Where do fallen angels go  
I just dont know  
Where do fallen angels go  
They just keep falling  
Now the times in frightening  
Cant ignore the facts  
Theres so many people  
Just slippin through the cracks  
So many ashes are scattered  
So many rivers run dry  
Sometimes your Heaven is Hell  
and you dont know why  
(So listen)  
Where do fallen angels go  
I just dont know  
Where do fallen angels go  
They just keep falling, falling, falling...  
Can you hear me  
Can you hear me  
Somewhere out there theres a shining light  
And I got to be with you tonight  
And with all were nowhere  
We still pay the price  
Yeah the Devil seems to get his way  
In downtown paradise  
Where do fallen angels go  
I just dont know  
Where do fallen angels go  
They just keep falling, falling, falling...  
Where do fallen angels go  
I just dont know  
Where do fallen angels go  
They just keep falling, falling, falling...  
Theres a candle burning
