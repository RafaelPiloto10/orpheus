Love is holy, don't forget it  
It will heal you if you let it  
Love will strip you, leave you naked  
Love is sexy, love is sacred  
  
I put my faith in me and you  
Somehow I know that we'll put through  
Oh I feel my life passing by  
Sometimes it makes me want to cry  
Thank God I've got you by my side  
  
Every night I hope and pray  
Nothing takes your love away  
I lie awake just to watch you breathe  
Love is holy when you lay with me  
Love is holy baby stay with me  
  
I don't understand the world today  
Is everything made just to throw away  
But you and I (you and I)  
Get closer as time goes by (till I die)  
I feel my love intensify  
Baby you're a spiritual high  
  
Every night I hope and pray  
Nothing takes your love away  
I lie awake just to watch you breathe  
Love is holy when you lay with me  
Love is holy baby stay with me  
  
Love is holy, don't forget it  
It will heal you if you let it  
Love will strip you, leave you naked  
Love is sexy, love is sacred  
  
Every night I hope and pray  
Nothing takes your love away  
I lie awake just to watch you breathe  
Love is holy when you lay with me  
Love is holy baby stay with me  
(Every night I hope and pray)  
(Nothing takes your love away)  
I lie awake just to watch you breathe  
Love is holy when you lay with me  
Love is holy baby stay with me
