Crisis feeds the lunacy  
All fear the new machine  
Consumed democracy returns a socialist regime  
  
It's laid to rest without a contest  
All hail the new incompetence  
Masking you see what to believe  
A drone in the world of anarchy  
  
Treachery, misery, violence, insanity  
Scavengers closing in  
Covering the truth again  
Castrate society  
Fictional reality  
  
Insecurity afraid of things you cannot see  
Words become the image of the enemy  
  
You can't dissect what was correct  
Vengeance based on how things were said  
Can't see your side conflicts with mine  
Frustrations lead to complete demise  
  
Treachery, misery, violence, insanity  
Scavengers closing in  
Covering the truth again  
Every trial conspiracy  
Compassion is the enemy  
Paralyze, criticize  
Breaking through the wall of lies  
  
Suicidal hierarchy racing in reverse  
Everything that's done today will be tomorrow's curse  
  
Screams in my head precede your death  
Can't hold the rage when the truth is shed  
Blind lead the bind line after line  
In a world too shallow to defy  
  
Treachery, misery, violence, insanity  
Scavengers closing in  
Covering the truth again  
Castrate society  
Fictional reality
