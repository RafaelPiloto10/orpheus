I was born my mother's son  
When I hit the ground I was on the run  
All my life I've played the fool  
I've been breaking hearts and breaking rules  
  
I can't change my evil ways  
You can't change my evil ways  
No matter what the good book says  
I can't change my evil ways  
No more, no more, evil ways, my evil ways  
  
I've been accused of hit and run  
But all the same I had my fun  
Don't turn your back when I'm with you  
'Cause I'll steal your chickens and your sister too  
  
I can't change my evil ways  
You can't change my evil ways  
No matter what the good book says  
I can't change my evil ways  
No more, no more, evil ways, my evil ways  
  
I was born my mother's son  
Since I could crawl I been having fun  
Now I've been poor and I've been rich  
But I've always been a son of a bitch  
  
I can't change my evil ways  
You can't change my evil ways  
No matter what the good book says  
I can't change my evil ways  
No more, no more, evil ways, my evil ways  
  
My evil ways, evil ways  
Evil ways, evil ways
