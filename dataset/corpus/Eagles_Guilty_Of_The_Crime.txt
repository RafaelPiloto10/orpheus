You're the only one who's ever heard my song  
I might be lonely now, but I won't be lonely long  
Take a look at me, baby  
Tell me, what do you see?  
Take a look at me, baby  
You're lookin' at the brand new me  
  
I'm like a total stranger knockin' at your door  
No need to worry 'bout the way I was before  
It's a new love story  
So read every line  
You be the judge and the jury  
I'm guilty of the crime  
  
I'm guilty of, guilty of the crime  
Of lovin' you, baby  
Guilty of, guilty of the crime  
  
I'm savin' all my lovin' just for you  
'Cause there's nothin' more that I would rather do  
It's a new love story  
Got to read every line  
You be the judge and the jury  
I'm guilty of the crime  
  
I'm guilty of, guilty of the crime  
Of lovin' you, baby  
Guilty of, guilty of the crime  
Of lovin' you, baby  
Guilty of, guilty of the crime  
Yes, I'm guilty of, guilty of the crime  
Of lovin' you, lovin' you  
  
I'm guilty of, guilty of the crime  
Yes I'm guilty of, guilty of the crime
