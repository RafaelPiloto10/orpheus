I get high when I see you go by, (my oh my)  
When you sigh my inside just flies, (butterflies).  
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you.  
  
It's only love and that is all,  
Why should I feel the way I do.  
It's only love and that is all,  
But it's so hard loving you.  
  
Is it right that you and I should fight, (every night)  
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright, (very bright)  
Haven't I the right to make it up girl.  
  
It's only love and that is all,  
Why should I feel the way I do.  
It's only love and that is all,  
But it's so hard loving you.  
Yes it's so hard loving you.  
Loving you.
