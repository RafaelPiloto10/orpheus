Another Saturday night  
By: Jimmy Buffett  
  
Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody  
I've got some money cause I just got paid  
How I wish I had someone to talk to  
I'm in an awful way  
  
I got in town a month ago  
I've seen a lot of girls since then  
If I could meet 'em I could get 'em  
But as yet I haven't met 'em  
That's why I'm in the shape I'm in  
  
Oh, another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody  
I've got some money cause I just got paid  
How I wish I had someone to talk to  
I'm in an awful way  
  
Now another fella told me  
He had a sister who looked just fine  
Instead of being my deliverance  
She had a strange resemblance  
To a cat name Frankenstein  
  
Oh, another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody  
I've got some money cause I just got paid  
How I wish I had some chick to talk to  
I'm in an awful way  
  
Yeah, another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody  
I've got some money cause I just got paid  
How I wish I had someone to talk to  
I'm in an awful way  
  
It's hard on a fella  
When he don't know his way around  
If I don't find me a honey  
To help me spend this money  
I'm headin' back to key west town  
  
Oh, another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody  
I've got some money cause I just got paid  
How I wish I had someone to talk to  
I'm in an awful way  
  
Just another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody  
I've got some money cause I just got paid  
How I wish I had some chick to talk to  
I'm in an awful way  
  
It's awful, all dressed up and no place to go, no one to help me spend  
My flow, another Saturday night, get me the pizza man.
