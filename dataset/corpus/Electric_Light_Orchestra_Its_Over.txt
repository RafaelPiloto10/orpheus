Summer came and passed away,  
Hardly seemed to last a day  
But it's over and what can I do  
  
Music playin' in the air,  
Silence on a darkened stair  
'cos it's over and what can I do  
  
It's over, it's over, all over,  
It's all over now  
And the way you looked  
Don't even mean I'm down.  
When you kick out the sea  
And the sun says goodbye  
There is nothing much to speak of.  
  
Lookin' over sunny days,  
Searchin' for the righteous wave  
'cos it's over and what can I do  
  
Lookin' from this distant shore  
You ain't sailin' by no more  
'cos it's over and what can I do  
  
It's over, it's over, all over,  
It's all over now  
And the way you looked  
Don't even mean I'm down.  
When you kick out the sea  
And the sun says goodbye  
There is nothing much to speak of.  
  
Ah, it's over, it's over, it's over,  
It's all over and what can I do?  
Ah, it's over, it's over,  
It's all over.
