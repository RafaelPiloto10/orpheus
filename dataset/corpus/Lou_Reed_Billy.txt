Billy was a good friend of mine  
We grew up together ever since we were nine  
We went to school, he was my best friend  
And I thought our friendship would never end  
  
In highschool he played football  
And me, I didn't do anything at all  
He made touch-downs, while I played pool  
And no one could figure out, which one of us was the fool  
  
Then we both went to collage  
He studied medicine, while I studied foilage  
He got "A's", and I got "D's"  
He was going for his P.H.D.  
The I decided to drop out  
Then I decided to drop out  
Things were getting a little to hot  
  
Billy stayed there, became an intern, then a doctor  
Then war broke out and he had to go  
But not me, I was mentally unfit or so they say, so, so  
  
When he came back, he wasn't quite the same  
His nerves were shot, but not me  
Last time I saw him, I couldn't take it anymore  
He wasn't the Billy I knew, it was like talking to a door  
  
Billy was a friend of mine  
I grew up with him ever since we were nine  
We went together to school  
And now I often wonder, which one of us was the fool
