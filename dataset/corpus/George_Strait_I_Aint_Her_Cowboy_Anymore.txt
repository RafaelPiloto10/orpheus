I pack up my saddle  
Throw it in that two-horse trailer  
Back up my truck, hook 'em up  
And drive away  
Won't be the first time  
But this time's the last time  
She meant it when she said  
That's all I've got to say  
Never had been thrown like this before  
I ain't her cowboy anymore  
  
Never saw it comin'  
But I knew where it was goin'  
When she asked how long this time  
Before I hit the road  
She didn't come right out and say it  
But I sure got the message  
When I reached out to hold her  
That shoulder sure was cold  
Figured I'd just let goodbye run its course  
I ain't her cowboy anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
These white lines are a blur  
Like the last few nights I spent with her  
I don't know where I went wrong  
Or if I did  
Like the good ol' boy I am  
I told her that I understand  
But Lord knows that I won't long as I live  
Seems lately every time it rains it pours  
I ain't her cowboy anymore  
  
We met in Denver  
Settled down in Dallas  
The best days of my life  
Were the ones I spent with her  
You'd think that all that lovin' ought to count for something  
Guess I wore out my welcome  
Like the rowels of these old spurs  
That Casper sunset's what I'm shootin' for  
'Cause I ain't her cowboy anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Her cowboy anymore  
I ain't her cowboy anymore
