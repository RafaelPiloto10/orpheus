I wasn't born lookin' back, I can't tell white from black  
Kesey next to me now darling, straighter than a railroad track  
I've been so high, my mind was dry  
  
I rent it out to farmers on the midnight ride  
That ain't all  
I ain't even got me a congressman I can call  
I seen 'em dumpin' garbage, in my rivers and lakes  
All right  
I seen 'em send up John Sinclair, you know  
Two joints is all it takes  
  
Then suddenly I was in a tree  
And dogs were barking up at me  
Can't you see  
I'm so damn apethetic, I can't believe I'm free  
  
As the senator he signs the bills you know  
  
And he's telling us which way we have to go  
  
Think it's time we got together and declared  
When you see them coming and you get so scared  
  
Rain is falling down, but you know I'm feeling fine  
I think I'll watch the tv set, let America steal my mind  
But you know I'm cool, Momma had a rule  
She didn't raise no fool to be true to someone else  
I'm gonna be myself  
I'm runnin' down that highway child  
  
Highway child  
Highway child
