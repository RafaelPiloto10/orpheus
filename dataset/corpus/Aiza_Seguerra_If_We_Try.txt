When I see you on the street  
I lose my concentration  
Just the thought that we might meet  
Creates anticipation  
  
Won't you look my way once before you go  
And my eyes will say what you ought to know  
Well, I've been thinkin' about you day and night  
And I don't know if it'll work out right  
But somehow I think that it just might  
If we try  
  
Faces come and faces go  
In circular rotation  
But something yearns within to grow  
Beyond infatuation  
  
Won't you look my way once before you go  
And my eyes will say what you ought to know  
Well you've got me standin' deaf and blind  
'Cause I see love as just a state of mind  
And who knows what it is that we might find  
If we try  
And who knows what it is that we might find  
If we try  
  
You've walkin' a diff'rent direction  
From most people I've met  
You've givin' me signs of affection  
I don't usually get  
I don't want you to pledge your future  
The future's not yours to give  
Just stand there a little longer  
And let me watch you while you leave  
  
'Cause when I see you on the street  
I lose my concentration  
And just the thought that we might meet  
Creates anticipation  
  
Won't you look my way once before you go  
And my eyes will say what you ought to know  
Well, I've been thinkin' about you day and night  
And I don't know if it'll work out right  
But somehow I think that it just might  
If we try  
  
Somehow I think that it just might  
If we try  
Yes, somehow I think that it just might  
If we try
