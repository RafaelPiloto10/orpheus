Congratulations to someone  
Someone who's happy with you  
I guess he did the right things  
I was wise enough to do  
  
Yes, congratulations to someone  
Someone who's holding you now  
You know I'll always love you  
But I'll get along somehow  
  
Now, didn't I kiss you often enough?  
Didn't I hold you tight?  
Why did you leave here by myself  
Cryin' alone in the night, babe?  
  
I thought you'd love me forever  
Somehow it just couldn't be  
Congratulations to someone  
But I wish that someone was me  
  
I thought you'd love me forever  
Somehow it just couldn't be  
Congratulations to someone  
Oh, I wish that someone was me  
Yes, I wish that someone was me
