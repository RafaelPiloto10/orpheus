O' come all ye faithful  
Joyful and triumphant  
O' come ye, o' come ye  
To Bethlehem  
Come and behold Him  
Born the King of Angels  
O' come let us adore him  
O' come let us adore him  
O' come let us adore him  
Christ The Lord  
  
Yea, Lord we greet thee  
Born this happy morning  
Oh Jesus to thee be all glory given  
Word of the Father  
Now in flesh appearing  
O' come let us adore him  
O' come let us adore him  
O' come let us adore him  
Christ The Lord  
  
O' come let us adore him  
Christ The Lord
