L.a. proved too much for the man  
(too much for the man)  
(he couldn't make it)  
So he's leaving the life he's come to know  
(he said he's going)  
He said he's going back to find  
(going back to find)  
What's left of his world  
The world he left behind  
Not so very long ago  
Oh yeah  
  
He's leaving  
(leaving)  
On that midnight train to georgia  
(leaving on a midnight train)  
Oh yeah  
Oh y'all  
Said he's going back to find  
(he's going back to find)  
A simpler place and time  
(and when he takes that ride)  
Yes he is  
(guess who's gonna be right by his side)  
I'll be with him  
(I know you will)  
On that midnight train to Georgia  
(leaving on a midnight train to Georgia)  
(whoo whoo)  
I'd rather live in his world  
(live in his world)  
Than live without him in mine  
(world, world)  
(it's his, his and hers alone)  
  
He kept dreaming  
(dreaming)  
That one day he'd be a star  
(a superstar but he didn't get far)  
But he sure found out the hard way  
That dreams don't always come true  
(dreams don't always come true)  
Oh no  
(uh uh no uh uh)  
So he sold all his hopes  
And he even sold his own car  
And bought a one way ticket back  
To the life that he once knew  
Oh yes he did  
He said he would  
  
I know he's leaving  
(leaving)  
On that midnight train to georgia  
(leaving on a midnight train)  
Oh yeah  
Oh y'all  
Said he's going back to find  
(he's going back to find)  
A simpler place and time  
(and when he takes that ride)  
Yes he is  
(guess who's gonna be right by his side)  
I've got to be with him  
(I know you will)  
On that midnight train to Georgia  
(leaving on the midnight train to Georgia)  
(whoo whoo)  
I'd rather live in his world  
(live in his world)  
Than live without him in mine  
(world, world)  
(it's his, his and hers alone)  
  
He's leaving

Than live without him in mine  
  
(world, world)  
(is his, his and hers alone)  
(world is his)  
(his and hers alone)  
(all aboard)

(her man, his girl)  
I've got to go
