Hell yeah, woo  
Punk rock trippin' with the flavor of hip hop  
Spittin' out venom as I'm watching all your heads bob  
Representing for the outcasts and the have nots  
Feigning to find light in a world that has blacked out  
Your middle fingers up, yeah, put 'em up, we've had enough  
We take a shot to the chin with a grin, we're tough  
We know exactly why you're here so make it clear, let's go  
We know you want to let's go, let's go  
Hell yeah, hell yeah, we want control  
Hell yeah, hell yeah, a scene to call our own  
Hell yeah, hell yeah, I grip the microphone  
And we're picking up speed like a rolling stone  
Let's go, we can't live forever  
One note, the louder the better  
So let's go, we're in this together  
Can't you hear me?  
(Hell yeah, let's go)  
Let's go, we can't live forever  
One note, the louder the better  
So let's go, we're in this together  
Can't you hear me?  
(Hell yeah, let's go)  
Rising from the ash, counter clash, there is no doubt  
Swinging from the rafters are the kids who never sold out  
Holding out for hope, this shit is dope, hear the crowds shout  
Fighting to survive, one day we'll make them tap out  
We'll raise your voices up, yeah, raise 'em up, we've had enough  
We're standing up and now we're being heard the gloves are off  
The voice is loud, we have the crowd, the time is now, let's go  
We know you want to let's go, let's go  
Hell yeah, hell yeah, we want control  
Hell yeah, hell yeah, a scene to call our own  
Hell yeah, hell yeah, I grip the microphone  
And we're picking up speed like a rolling stone  
Let's go, we can't live forever  
One note, the louder the better  
So let's go, we're in this together  
Can't you hear me?  
(Hell yeah, let's go)  
Let's go, we can't live forever  
One note, the louder the better  
So let's go, we're in this together  
Can't you hear me?  
(Hell yeah, let's go)  
Get up tonight, stand up and fight  
They are here, they are in sight, they're inside  
And I can't go alone on this microphone  
Is this on? Is this on?  
This flow is definitive, make your throat hurt  
A gagged voice with no choice, it's so limited  
Hell yeah, come on, hell yeah, it's on  
Bounce to the boom of the beat of the drum, drum  
Let's go, we can't live forever  
One note, the louder the better  
So let's go, we're in this together  
Can't you hear me?  
(Hell yeah, let's go)  
Let's go, we can't live forever  
One note, the louder the better  
So let's go, we're in this together  
Can't you hear me?  
(Hell yeah, let's go)  
Hell yeah
