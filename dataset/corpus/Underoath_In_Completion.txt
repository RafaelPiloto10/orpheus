So follow me to the empty ocean  
We can watch the city descend behind the skyline  
On our backs we float away  
Now forget about the way you used to be  
  
Tonight I fail but I never wanted to let you drown without me  
Tonight we are the only ones to watch it fall apart  
  
We slide into our place where I can watch you swim  
Don't forget my hands still wrapped around your neck  
We fall deeper into the ground  
This nights never looked so hollow  
I wanted to share this with you with you  
I'll wait till it opens up again  
Sit here until the water reaches our necks  
Finally get to watch them wash away the lies  
  
Tonight I fail but I never wanted to let you drown without me (without me)  
Open your lungs follow me down [x2]  
I set this up keep swimming keep swimming  
Oh God I am emptier than you!
