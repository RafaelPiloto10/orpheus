Gettin' to know you,  
Gettin' to know all about you.  
Gettin' to like you,  
Gettin' to hope you like me.  
  
Gettin' to know you,  
Putting it my way but nicely.  
You are precisely,  
My cup of tea.  
  
Gettin' to know you,  
Gettin' to feel free and easy.  
When I am with you,  
Gettin' to to know what to say.  
Haven't you noticed,  
Suddenly I 'm bright and breezy,  
Because of all the beautiful and new  
Things I'm learning about you  
Day by day.
