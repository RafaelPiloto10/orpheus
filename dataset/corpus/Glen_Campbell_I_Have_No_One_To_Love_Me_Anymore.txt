My baby's gone I have no one who needs me anymore  
I can't go on I have no one to love me anymore  
Time on my hands you on my mind giving in the broken dreams you left behind  
Wherever I go whatever I do my heart keeps blinding me reminding me we're
through  
My baby's gone...  
You took my hand and turned away leaving me within the walls of yesterday  
Wherever I go whatever I do there's no use trying I guess I'll never forget
you  
My baby's gone...
