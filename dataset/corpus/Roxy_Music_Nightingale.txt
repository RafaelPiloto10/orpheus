Before the morning comes, will I hear your song  
Come little nightingale, I won't be here for long  
When you're up there flying, do you care  
If there's no one else around?  
When your lover leaves you in the air  
Do you waver, do you fall?  
  
Now while the moon is high  
Shall we, nightingale,  
Duet all through the night  
A pair of souls for sale  
Stars cluster glistening  
Captive till the dawn  
Patiently listening  
They've heard it all before  
Should I stay here or should I go?  
  
I couldn't bear to be alone  
Was it really love I saw?  
Oh, now I'll never know  
What is this I hear?  
I recognize that song  
Sweet little nightingale I knew you'd come along  
Soon when the morning comes.  
We will both be gone  
So sing pretty nightingale  
Lead, I'll follow on.
