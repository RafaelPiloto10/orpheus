I heard a funny thing about me  
Lately I've been living on the edge  
I won't say that ain't true,  
But who the hell are you  
I don't recognize my own face or my friends.  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey, Mr. Smiley  
Read the writing  
On the wall  
Wake up, Mr. Smiley  
Before you don't wake  
Up at all, up at all  
  
Today, I hired me a yes man  
He simply agrees with everything I say  
He does all my dirty deals  
And feeds me my pills  
As long as I'm still breathing he gets paid  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yesterday I had a conversation  
With all them voices in my head  
One said I was no good  
One said I should quit  
One said to remind myself to get myself a fix  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hey Mr. Smiley  
And I'm feeling ten feet tall  
Bye Mr. Smiley  
You got to go now, they just called, they just called
