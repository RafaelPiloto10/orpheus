Trouble is my calling card, that's my middle name  
Ever since you walked away, things are not the same  
Now my life is misery, don't know what to do  
Yes your gone, your history, but I can't get over you  
  
Used to be in Shanggrila, life used to be so good  
You and me were going so far and that was understood  
But ever since you walked away, my world has turned so blue  
So now I live from day to day ?'cause I can't get over you  
  
Give our love another chance, you could make it so  
Just how this could go so wrong, I will never know  
  
Well I want you right next to me and that's all I can say  
And I've been calling ever since you drove me away  
You were on my mind so long, it?s hard for me to take  
Now my heart is not so strong and it might break over you  
  
You can wear a wig and some elevator shoes  
Make yourself twice as big, but I'm still coming after you
