Jesse James we understand  
Has killed many a man  
He robbed the union trains  
He stole from the rich  
And gave to the poor  
He'd a hand and a heart  
And a brain  
  
Now Jesse had a wife  
Lived a lady all her life  
And children they were brave  
But history does record  
That Bob and Charlie ford  
Have laid poor Jesse in his grave  
  
Well it was on Saturday night  
The stars were shining bright  
They robbed the Glendale train  
And the people they did say  
For many miles away  
It was those outlays  
Frank and Jesse James  
  
Now Jesse had a wife  
Lived a lady all her life  
And children they were brave  
But history does record  
That Bob and Charlie ford  
Have laid poor Jesse in his grave  
  
Well it was Bob and Charlie ford  
Those dirty little cowards  
I wonder how they feel  
For they ate of Jesse's bread  
And they slept in Jesse's bed  
And they laid poor Jesse in his grave  
  
Now Jesse had a wife  
Lived a lady all her life  
And children they were brave  
But history does record  
That Bob and Charlie ford  
Have laid poor Jesse in his grave  
  
Well the people held their breath  
When they heard of Jesse's death  
They wondered how he came to fall  
Well it was Robert ford in fact  
Who shot him in the back  
While he hung a picture on the wall
