When you ask me do I mean it?  
You have to know  
You are the only one  
You ask me if it is forever  
How can I show?  
There's no comparison  
Beyond your doubt  
Beyond devout  
Beyond the stars tonight  
One man in my heart  
One man in my head  
Oh la la la oh la la la  
One man in my house  
One man in my bed  
Oh la la la oh la la la  
My faith is stronger than existence  
Longer than time  
More fiery than the sun  
Within a universe exploding  
Though we are mist  
Among oblivion  
Or should I lie?  
So you can cry  
In your sleep tonight  
Chorus  
Your clumsy grace  
I love your face  
And when we meet  
Oh oh oh la la la  
Your kiss so sweet  
The things we choose  
The things we choose  
The life we use  
The life we use  
The things you say  
All the things you say  
The need to stay  
And the need to stay  
One man in my heart  
One man in my head  
Oh la la la oh la la la  
One man in my heart  
One man in my house  
One man in my bed  
Oh la la la oh la la la  
I've got one man one man  
One man in my
