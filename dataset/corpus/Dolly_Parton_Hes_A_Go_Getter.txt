(Dolly Parton)  
He's a go getter, go getter  
When his wife gets off from work, he'll go get her  
Now I've got a neighbor that lives down the road a ways  
His wife holds down a steady job, he don't turn his hand all day  
I know that most of you will know the kind I'm talkin' about  
The kind that rather than have to work, he'd rather do without  
But he's a go getter, a go getter  
When his wife gets off from work, he'll go get her  
There's a group of men in the court house yard any time that you go by  
Playin' checkers and tradin' odds and makin' jokes about their wives  
They wait all week for pay day and they hold the money's plenty  
And the wife that's worked those long hard hours never gets a penny  
But he's a go getter, a go getter  
When his wife gets off from work, he'll go get her  
Yes he's a go getter, a go getter  
When his wife gets off from work, he'll go get her  
He's a go getter, a go getter  
When his wife gets off from work, he'll go get her
