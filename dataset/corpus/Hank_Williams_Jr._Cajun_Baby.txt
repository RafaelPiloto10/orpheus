Way down yonder in the bayou country in dear old Louisianne  
That's where lives my Cajun baby, the fairest one in the land  
Her teeth're white and pearly hair black as coal  
Wouldn't trade my Cajun baby for the world's gold  
Way down yonder in the bayou country in dear old Louisianne  
  
My heart's been sad and lonely since the day I left her side  
But today I got her letter said she'd be my Cajun bride  
Gonna go and wed my Cajun baby and live by the old bayou  
Eat a lotsa shrimp and crawfish ride around in my old pirogue  
  
Way down yonder in the bayou country in dear old Louisianne  
That's where lives my Cajun baby, the fairest one in the land  
Her teeth're white and pearly hair black as coal  
Wouldn't trade my Cajun baby for the world's gold  
Way down yonder in the bayou country in dear old Louisianne  
  
Before the sun goes down this evening, I'll be on my way  
To see my Cajun baby and there I'm gonna stay  
On a Saturday night we go dancin' and listen to the fiddle-o  
Lord I got me a Cajun baby just a livin' and a lovin' by the old bayou  
  
Way down yonder in the bayou country in dear old Louisianne  
That's where lives my Cajun baby, the fairest one in the land  
Her teeth're white and pearly hair black as coal  
Wouldn't trade my Cajun baby for the world's gold  
Way down yonder in the bayou country in dear old Louisianne
