You see me smile but you paint an ugly face  
Everything you do is all about the chase  
Don't let them see you cry  
Don't let them know  
You won't lay down and die for their show  
  
Why don't you go ahead tear my heart out  
Why don't you go ahead hang me out to dry  
Go ahead play your game, go ahead  
Spread my name all over your blood red sky  
  
They colour your stars till the light begins to fade  
But never give up 'cause every dog has its day  
Don't let them see you cry  
Don't let them know  
You won't lay down and die for their show  
  
Why don't you go ahead tear my heart out  
Why don't you go ahead hang me out to dry  
Go ahead play your game, go ahead  
Spread my name all over your blood red sky  
Go ahead  
  
Why don't you go ahead, go ahead, go ahead  
Why don't you go ahead hang me out to dry  
I said go ahead play your game, go ahead play your game, go ahead play your
game  
Your blood red sky  
Why don't you go ahead tear my heart out  
Why don't you go ahead lay me out to dry  
Go ahead  
I said go ahead play your game, go ahead  
Spread my name all over your blood red sky  
Go ahead  
Why don't you go ahead tear my heart out  
Why don't you go ahead hang me out to dry  
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go ahead and hang my heart out  
I said go ahead and play your game, go ahead  
Spread my name all over your blood red sky  
Your blood red sky  
Blood red sky
