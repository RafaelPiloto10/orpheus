I can't win, I can't reign.  
I will never win this game without you, without you.  
I am lost, I am vain.  
I will never be the same without you, without you.  
I won't run, I won't fly.  
I will never make it by without you, without you.  
I can't rest, I can't fight.  
All I need is you, and I without you, without you.  
Oh oh oh, you, you, you, without you.  
You, you, without you.  
Can't erase, so I'll take blame.  
But I can't accept that we're estranged, without you.  
  
I can't quit now, this can't be right.  
I can't take one more sleepless night, without you, without you.  
I won't soar, I won't climb.  
If you're not here, I'm paralyzed.  
Without you, without you.  
I can't look, I'm so blind.  
Lost my heart, lost my mind without you, without you.  
Oh oh oh, you, you, you.  
Without you, you, you.  
Without you.  
I am lost, I am vain.  
I will never be the same without you, without you.  
Without you.
