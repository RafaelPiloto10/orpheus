Train roll on, on down the line,  
Won't you please take me far, far away.  
Now I feel the wind blow, outside my door,  
I'm leavin' my woman at home, oh yeah.  
Tuesday's gone with the wind,  
My baby's gone, gone with the wind.  
And I don't know, oh, where I'm goin'.  
I just want to be left alone.  
When this train ends, I'll try again.  
I'm leavin' my woman at home.  
My baby's gone  
  
Tuesday's gone with the wind.  
Tuesday's gone with the wind.  
Tuesday's gone with the wind.  
My baby's gone, with the wind.  
Train roll on  
Tuesday's gone with the wind.  
Tuesday's gone with the wind.  
Tuesday's gone with the wind.  
My baby's gone, with the wind.  
  
Train roll on  
Train roll on many miles from my home,see I'm,  
I'm ridin' my blues, babe, blues away, yeah.  
But Tuesday you see, a she had to be free.  
Somehow I got to, to carry on.  
My baby's gone.  
  
Tuesday's gone with the wind.  
Tuesday's gone with the wind.  
Tuesday's gone with the wind.  
My baby's gone, with the wind.  
  
Train roll on...train roll on...  
Roll on train...roll on train...roll on train  
Train roll on...the train, it rolls on  
Train rolls on I can't change, I can't change,  
I can't change, I can't change,I can't change...  
Ride on train  
I can't change  
Train roll on  
Lord, I can't change  
I can't change
