CHORUS:  
Do ya, do ya have a secret friend  
Playin' around, hangin' out again  
  
Your love has been like a stranger  
Your love is hiding behind a closed door  
You're an ace at using deception  
'Cause you don't want to let me go  
  
CHORUS  
  
Be ashamed to lose good lovin'  
Chasin' dreams in the night the way we do  
There's no way, you got to be honest  
I'll do anything to make it right for you  
  
CHORUS  
  
Can't you see it's just an attraction  
He can feed you lies so easily  
I can't wait forever  
Girl, let me go or come to me  
Tell me ...  
  
CHORUS
