Easy come and easy go  
Hard to get a hold on  
Searching for what you don't know  
Blind to where you belong  
Feel the power in your dreams  
Vision in your sight  
Nothing's dark as it may seem  
We can make it right  
  
[Chorus]  
I have faith  
In your love  
I have faith  
In your heart  
You don't need to hide from what you want  
You've just got to give it all you got  
The first thing that you need  
You got to have faith  
  
Truth hidden between the lies  
We both know the chances  
Nothing comes from compromise  
Only strength advances  
I will be here at your side  
For everything you do  
When the world tears at your pride  
I'll be there for you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When the world's coming at you like a hungry alligator  
You got to have faith  
When you've got to pay them now or they'll take it from you later  
You got to have faith  
When you feel like the future's hiding on a distant cloud  
You got to have faith  
And you feel like shouting at the good Lord out loud  
You got to have faith  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When you know that you're ready but the time is not right  
You got to have faith  
And you lie awake staring at the ceiling all night  
You got to have faith
