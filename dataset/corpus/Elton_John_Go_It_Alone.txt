It's so hard to say goodbye  
When there's nothing left to give  
When this house is just a hill of bones  
Where you and I once lived  
If we put it back together  
By the skin of our teeth  
You'd still pull it all apart  
Bit by bit, piece by piece  
And I'll go it alone, call this house my home  
Build it up again with someone new  
Build it brick by brick, till I find a girl that fits  
This home's a whole lot better without you  
There's no passion alive  
When you count your phony schemes  
And the cars you drive to buy your friends  
They don't ever come back clean  
If the cards on the table  
Always turn up spades  
The cards that always cheat the hearts  
The spades you play just dug my grave  
And I'll go it alone, call this house my home  
Build it up again with someone new  
Build it brick by brick, till I find a girl that fits  
This home's a whole lot better without you  
And I'll go it alone, call this house my home  
I'm gonna build it up again with someone new  
Build it brick by brick, till I find a girl that fits  
This home's a whole lot better without you  
Oh, I'll go it alone, call this house my home  
Build it up again with someone new  
I'll build it brick by brick, till I find a girl that fits  
This home's a whole lot better without you  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you  
...
