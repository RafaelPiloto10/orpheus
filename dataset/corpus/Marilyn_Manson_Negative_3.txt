Negative 3  
Give me your blood, your tears  
Your high school pictures  
Your words can't begin to  
Satisfy my needs  
  
Give me your hand I'll never  
Give you flowers  
Your touch can't begin to  
Satisfy my...  
I can't save you from me this time  
You can't save you  
Nothing comes between you and I  
Don't know what you see  
In my negativity  
I know, you know  
It's one part you three parts me, yeah  
Don't know what you see  
In my negativity  
I know, you know  
Three parts me  
  
Show me your scars  
Show me your broken mirrors  
Your dreams can't begin to  
Satisfy my...  
I can't save you from me this time  
You can't hide from me  
Can't hide what's inside  
In your mind  
  
Don't know what you see  
In my negativity  
I know, you know  
It's one part you three parts me, yeah  
Don't know what you see  
In my negativity  
I know, you know  
Three parts me  
  
Don't know what you see  
In my negativity  
I know, you know  
It's one part you three parts me, yeah  
Don't know what you see  
In my negativity  
I know, you know  
It's one part you three parts me, yeah
