It's up to you not to heed the call-up  
'N' you must not act the way you were brought up  
Who knows the reasons why you have grown up?  
Who knows the plans or why they were drawn up?  
  
It's up to you not to heed the call-up  
I don't want to die!  
It's up to you not to hear the call-up  
I don't want to kill!  
  
For he who will die  
Is he who will kill  
  
Maybe I want to see the wheat fields  
Over Kiev and down to the sea  
  
All the young people down the ages  
They gladly marched off to die  
Proud city fathers used to watch them  
Tears in their eyes  
  
There is a rose that I want to live for  
Although, God knows, I may not have met her  
There is a dance an' I should be with her  
There is a town - unlike any other  
  
It's up to you not to hear the call-up  
'N' you must not act the way you were brought up  
Who give you work an' why should you do it?  
At fifty five minutes past eleven  
There is a rose...  
Yeah!
