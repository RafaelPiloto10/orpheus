Mama told me not to waste my life  
She said spread your wings my little butterfly  
  
Don't let what they say keep you up at night  
And if they give you shhhh  
Then they can walk on by  
  
My feet, feet can't touch the ground  
And I can't hear a sound  
But you just keep on running up your mouth yeah  
  
Walk, walk on over there  
'Cause I'm too fly to care, oh yeah  
Your words don't mean a thing  
I'm not listening  
Keep talking, all I know is  
  
Mama told me not to waste my life,  
She said spread your wings my little butterfly  
Don't let what they say keep you up at night  
And they can't detain you  
'Cause wings are made to fly  
And we don't let nobody bring us down  
No matter what you say it won't hurt me  
Don't matter if I fall from the sky  
These wings are made to fly  
  
Huh huh  
I'm firing up on that runway  
I know we're gonna get there someday  
But we don't need no ready steady go, no  
Talk, talk turns into air  
And I'm to fly to care, oh yeah  
  
Your words don't mean a thing  
I'm not listening  
Keep talking, all I know is  
  
Mama told me not to waste my life,

Don't let what they say keep you up at night,

'Cause wings are made to fly  
And we don't let nobody bring us down  
No matter what you say it won't hurt me  
Don't matter if I fall from the sky  
These wings are made to fly  
  
I don't need no one saying hey, hey, hey, hey  
I don't hear no one saying hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey  
You better keep on walking  
I don't wanna hear your talking, boy  
You better keep on walking  
I don't wanna hear your talking, boy  
  
Your words don't mean a thing  
I'm not listening  
They're just like water off my wings  
  
Mama told me not to waste my life  
She said spread your wings my little butterfly  
Don't let what they say keep you up at night  
And they can't detain you  
'Cause wings are made to fly
