A song for the deaf, that is for you  
  
Nobody's comin' down the hall  
Everybody echoes in my head  
Broken reflection outta luck  
Nobody ever needed it  
  
I got what was  
I want to take what's left  
I'm ready now  
  
Beautiful senses are gone  
Canary in a gilded cage  
Singing  
  
Sweet soft and low  
I will poison you all  
Come closer racing to your tongue  
  
I got what was  
I want to take what's left  
No talk will cure, what's lost or save  
What's left, for the deaf  
  
The blind can go get fucked  
Lie beside the ditch  
This halo round my neck  
Has torn out every stitch  
  
Who are you hidin'?  
Is it safe for the deaf?  
Beautiful, cancer  
Infiltrate, and forget  
  
Then I saw you comin'  
Then I heard not a thing  
A mistake not to listen  
When I knew where you'd been?  
  
I got what was  
I want to take what's left  
No talk will cure, what's lost or save  
What's left, for the deaf  
  
You're listening to W. A. N. T  
The high desert favorite [Incomprehensible] radio station  
It's been a good night, Dave catching here  
Not saying goodnight, just saying
