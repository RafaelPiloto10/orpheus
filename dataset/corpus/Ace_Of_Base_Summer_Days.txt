Summer days (Summer days)  
Lost in another way (uh yeah)  
I was lost in another way (oh yeah)  
  
Who was the man behind the mask  
Exploring your secrets is no easy task  
'Cause it happened long ago (oh yeah)  
You told me the secrets of living large  
And how to behave with my friend in the dark  
Our story lingers on (oh yeah)  
  
How I'm longing for you to give  
Me some magic for us to live  
If you told me it could be done  
I'd believe  
  
Summer days  
At the sea  
It was just you and me  
I was lost in another way  
Every day  
Seconds ago  
But why did you have to go?  
  
A teardrop of rain is where you are  
My perfect and gentle star of the stars  
Our story lingers on (oh yeah)  
  
How I'm longing for you to give  
Me some magic for us to live  
If you told me it could be done  
I'd believe  
  
Summer days  
At the sea  
It was just you and me  
I was lost in another way  
Every day  
Seconds ago  
But why did you have to go?  
  
I just want to find a way  
'Cause I want to be with you again  
That's the way it ought to be  
Aha aha aha aha  
  
Summer days  
Summer days  
Why did you have to go?  
  
Summer days  
At the sea (Let me know)  
It was just you and me (Have to go)  
I was lost in another way  
Every day (Tell me why did you have to go?)  
Seconds ago  
But why did you have to go?  
  
Summer days  
At the sea  
It was just you and me (Every day)  
I was lost in another way (I was lost in another way yeah)  
Every day  
Seconds ago  
Why did you have to go?
