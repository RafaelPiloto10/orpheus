(Wayne Kemp)  
Well I really had a ball last night  
I held all the pretty boys tight  
I was feelin' single, seein' double  
Wound up in a whole lotta trouble  
But today I'll face the big fight  
But I really had a ball last night  
When I came home from work this morning  
My baby was feelin' low  
And he told me what was on his mind  
Then he told me where I could go  
Well I didn't go where he told me to  
Cause the water was cold in the lake  
Now there's something fishy 'bout this whole deal  
I don't see where I made my mistake  
Well I really had a ball last night  
I held all the pretty boys tight  
I was feelin' single, seein' double  
Wound up in a whole lotta trouble  
But today I'll face the big fight  
But I really had a ball last night  
When I woke up this morning  
Like me, the sun was high  
Well I started walking the long way home  
Just to think of an alibi  
Well I couldn't think of a darn gawn thing  
That hadn't already been said  
So I guess I better just play it by ear  
Cause I'm already dead  
Well I really had a ball last night  
I held all the pretty boys tight  
I was feelin' single, seein' double  
Wound up in a whole lotta trouble  
But today I'll face the big fight  
But I really had a ball last night  
Yes today I'll face the big fight  
But I really had a ball last night
