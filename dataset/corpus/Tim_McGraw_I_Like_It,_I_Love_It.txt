Spent forty-eight dollars last night at the county fair  
I threw out my shoulder but I won her that teddy bear  
She's got me saying sugar-pie, honey, darlin', and dear  
I ain't seen the Braves play a game all year  
I'm gonna get fired, if I don't get some sleep  
My long lost buddies say I'm gettin' in to deep  
  
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it  
I try so hard, I can't rise above it  
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'  
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it  
  
My Mama and Daddy tried to teach me courtesy  
But it never sank in 'til that girl got a hold of me  
Now I'm holding umbrellas and openin' up doors  
I'm taking out the trash and I'm sweepin' my floors  
Crossin' my fingers, and countin' every kiss  
Prayin' that it keeps goin' on like this  
  
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it  
I try so hard, I can't rise above it  
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'  
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it  
  
Got to wash my truck and dress up  
To pick her up to watch TV  
And she sits down on the sofa  
She'll move a little closer  
She can't get enough of me  
  
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it  
I try so hard, I can't rise above it  
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'  
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
