The kettle's on, the sun has gone  
Another day  
She offers me tibetan tea on a flower tray  
She's at the door, she wants to score  
She dearly needs to to say  
I loved you a long time ago  
Where the winds own forget me nots blow  
But I just couldn't let myself go  
Not knowing what on earth there was to know  
But I wish that I had  
Cause I'm feeling so sad  
That I never had one of your children  
And across the room inside a tomb  
A change is waxed and wanes  
The night is young why are we so hung up  
In each others chains  
I must make her, I must take her  
While the dove domains  
And feel the juice run as she flies  
Run my winds under her sighs  
As the flames of eternity rise  
To lick us with the first-born lash of dawn  
Oh really my dear  
I can't see what we fear  
Sat here with ourselves in between us  
And at the door we can't say more  
Than just another day  
And without a sound I turn around  
And I walk away
