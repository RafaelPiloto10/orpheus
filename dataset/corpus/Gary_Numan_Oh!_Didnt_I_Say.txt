Hollow  
Faces staring through my window  
Sometimes  
I can play a boy you might know  
Station  
Standing cold and old I'm insane  
Gender  
Is uncertain just like my name  
  
The lemon kid is my friend  
But even he don't know me well  
Oh that's too bad  
The waiter is an old man  
Who looks at me so sly and strange  
What's on his mind  
  
Oh didn't I say I'm not one of you  
Oh didn't I say I'm not one of you  
  
Queenie  
From a doorway says "You got time?"  
Panic  
Not tonight if you don't mind  
Oh no  
My fear of streets I cover  
Today  
My room is home for hours  
  
You can stay if you know your lines  
But please take care  
I'll suck your mind dry  
You'll never guess  
And you can never know me  
I'll change if I begin to feel  
What's your name  
  
Zero hero says I'm no-one  
He could be right but who's to know  
Man from the sky  
Oh well I'm growing tired of this place  
I think it's time to change my face  
You can't even try  
  
Oh didn't I say I'm not one of you  
Oh didn't I say I'm not one of you  
Oh didn't I say I'm not one of you  
Oh didn't I say I'm not one of you
