I'll never forget that night long ago  
When he drove me down that old dusty road  
He took me as far as I'd ever been  
He wanted me and I wanted him  
But I'd always been told I shouldn't give in  
  
[Chorus]  
I wouldn't go that far  
I didn't follow my heart  
He said he loved me  
But I wasn't ready  
And I wouldn't go that far  
  
He was so patient, he didn't give up  
With a ring in his hand and a heart full of love  
He asked me for forever, I asked him to wait  
To please understand these dreams I must chase  
Though it was a promise I wanted to make  
  
[Chorus]  
  
After all these years. I saw him again  
He had his wife and his family with him  
He said he was proud of all my success  
He guessed both of us had found happiness  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yes, I knew he loved me  
But I wasn't ready  
And I wouldn't go that far
