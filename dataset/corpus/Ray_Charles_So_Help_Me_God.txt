So Help Me God  
By Ray Charles  
  
I am lost, I've been led astray  
Once again I need Your light and love to lead the way  
I know I don't deserve it, but I promise it's the end  
So if You rescue me just one more time  
You'll never have to do it again  
  
So help me God  
So help me God  
Help me... God  
Help me God  
Help me God  
Ooh...  
  
It's the truth, I can't tell You a lie  
You're the only one who's been there for me each and every time  
Now I guess it's my turn to prove myself to You  
Go ahead, ask me anything at all  
And that's what I am going to do  
  
So help me God (help me God)  
Help me God (please help me)  
Help me... God (God! )  
I cross my heart (help me... God)  
Help me God, oh yeah (ooh...)  
  
You've been so understanding and patient with me  
It's took me some time, but now I see (but now I see)  
It took me some time, but now I see...  
  
I am awake, now I have been found  
You can count on me forever more  
I'm never gonna' let You down  
  
So help me God (help me God)  
Yes please, God (please help me)  
Help me... (God! ) God  
Yes... (whoa! )  
Whoa... help me!  
(Help me God! Help me God! )  
  
I won't let you down... (oh no! )  
Please (help me) help me God  
(Help me God! Help me...)  
Help me God... My Lord.
