One more sad tomorrow  
And I'm not very good at hiding my sorrow  
It's not the same without you  
So alone and so afraid  
I thought we had it made  
What about us, what about the way  
We were so in love, when we were together  
I thought you'd never leave  
Now I know this time you're gone forever  
  
[Chorus]  
Only love can break your heart  
Fill you with desire  
And tear you all apart  
Only love can make you cry  
Only love knows why  
  
One more night without you  
I'm just trying to pretend that you're coming back again  
You know I never meant to doubt you, oh no  
We were young and we were free  
Now I can't believe this has happened to me  
  
What about us, what about the way  
We were so in love, when we were together  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Gonna be a long hard road without you  
And there's one thing you should know  
Tell me who will I turn to  
When I get in trouble  
I really don't want you to go, no  
  
Tell me who can I turn to  
When I get in trouble  
Baby please don't leave me  
Can't you see you must believe me  
  
Only love can break your heart  
Fill you with desire  
And tear you down, the minute that you fall apart  
  
Only love can make you cry  
Only love knows why, oh no  
Only love can tear you down  
Only love knows why, oh no  
  
Only love will make you cry
