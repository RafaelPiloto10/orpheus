Mother said, don't leave me  
There are monsters at the door  
I put on all my armour  
But I couldn't find my sword  
But there'll always be tomorrow  
Just you wait and see  
If they come to take you prisoner  
I'll be there to set you free  
  
Mother said, I'm grown up  
In a Sunday shirt and tie  
As long as I can see you  
Can I hold you when I cry  
There'll always be tomorrow  
I'll be so big and strong  
I'll sleep with all the lights out  
Not afraid of anyone  
  
I need you to stay  
I need you to stay  
I need you  
I need you  
  
Mother said she's sleeping  
So I climbed back into bed  
But the monsters took her prisoner  
That's all that father said  
So I thought about tomorrow  
And I learned to be alone  
Making friends with shadows  
As they moved around my home  
  
Mother never leaves me  
I can always see her smile  
  
I sit here in the evening  
To talk to her awhile  
There'll always be tomorrow  
Just you wait and see  
I know that any moment  
She will come to set me free  
  
I need you to stay  
I need you to stay  
I need you  
I need you  
  
I need you to stay  
I need you to stay  
I need you  
I need you
