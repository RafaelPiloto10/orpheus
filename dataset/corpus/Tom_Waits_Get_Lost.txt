I don't want to feel all cooped up  
I feel like I'm on a chain  
I got my ride all souped up  
We're never coming back again  
Time it don't mean nothing  
Money means even less  
Don't bring nothin' baby  
You're better then all the rest  
I wanna go get lost  
I wanna go get lost  
I wanna go get, I wanna go get lost  
  
When you wear that real tight sweater  
You know I can't resist  
It's been that way forever baby  
Ever since we kissed  
Roll down all the windows  
Turn up Wolfman Jack  
Please, please love me tender  
Ain't nothin' wrong with that  
Let's go get lost yeah  
Let's go get lost yeah  
Let's go get lost  
I wanna go get lost yeah  
  
Whatever that they told you about me  
Well all of it's true  
You're never gonna be with out me baby  
I'm never gonna be without you  
Top it off, fill it with high test  
Think about it what cha gonna tell your boss?  
Think about it what cha gonna tell your boss?  
Think about it what cha gonna tell your boss?  
Think about it what cha gonna tell your boss?  
  
And get lost  
I just wanna get, I just wanna get lost  
I wanna get lost  
I just wanna get  
I just wanna get  
I just wanna get  
I want to get  
I just wanna get  
I just wanna get lost  
All night long  
All night long  
All night long  
All night long  
  
I wanna get lost  
Just wanna get lost  
I wanna get lost  
I wanna get lost
