Bought a one-way ticket to the resurrection  
Got devil gone down on me  
It's a non-stop, no meal, no connection  
Devil-devil all over me  
Hero baby, here baby plant one on your daddy's cheek  
Got devil all over me  
I'll be gone for a minute but no more that a week  
Devil-devil all over me  
Gone through livin' just for dyin'  
Hear what I say  
Tacked to a six by nine  
To please us  
Look like you get what you want  
You a stone cold Jesus  
There's a movement to, yeah thare's an inc?  
Got devil gone down on me  
With a one-man, two-bit congregation  
Devil-devil all over me  
Here baby,here baby hammer down on the weak  
Got devil all over me  
With eternty gone you will inherit the meek  
Devil-devil all over me  
Gone through livin' just for dyin'  
Gone through laughin', gone through cryin'  
Hear what I say  
You know I seem to lost my way  
Seem to happen everyday  
Not sure where I'm goin'  
Or where I been  
You know it seems to cover me  
With full-blow mediocrity  
Not sure where I'm goin'  
Or where I sinned  
In quiet desperation claw  
On my soul I feel them gnaw  
Without hesitation render me  
Unconscious in too much too soon  
I long for days inside the womb  
Without hesitation comfort me  
I wait for salvation come  
You know it keep me on the run  
And put me in this place and keep me here  
I know I got my cross to bear  
I keep it with me everywhere  
Keeps me in the race that keep me here  
Got a stone cold Jesus
