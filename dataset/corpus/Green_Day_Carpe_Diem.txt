Breaking in a sweat  
Like a bomb threat  
Is your silhouette fading out?  
Nothing left to lose  
Detonate the fuse  
Another breaking news blowout  
  
Ain't it beautiful?  
So unusual  
Life's a gas and it's running out  
Living a cliche  
Gonna seize the day  
Bottle rockets and celebrate, celebrate, celebrate  
  
Carpe diem, a battle cry  
Are we all too young to die?  
Ask a reason and no reply  
Are we all too young to die?  
  
Making a living  
Making a killing  
What's worth forgiving?  
Alright  
  
The blink of an eye  
Barely scraping by  
Dominated by passer by's  
Feeling out of luck  
When the traffic's stuck  
And you're feeling  
So left behind  
  
Getting off a binge  
Get a second wind  
Another promise  
Just make a change  
Got a Broken wing  
Hear the angels sing  
With a signal that's out of range  
Ain't it strange?  
Ain't it strange?  
  
Carpe diem, a battle cry  
Are we all too young to die?  
Ask a reason and no reply  
Are we all too young to die?  
  
Making a living  
Making a killing  
What's worth forgiving?  
Alright  
  
Making a living  
Making a killing  
What's worth forgiving?  
Alright  
  
Carpe diem, a battle cry  
Are we all too young to die?  
Ask a reason and no reply  
Are we all too young to die?  
  
Carpe diem, a battle cry  
Are we all too young to die?  
Ask a reason and no reply  
Are we all too young to die?
