I'm sorry honey that you walked in and caught her in my lap  
But it's not what you're thinking so think before you slap  
I suppose you're weighin' that little blonde that walked here in this bar  
Ah don't tell me you're sory cause I know how sorry you are  
I'm sorry that you think I'm drunk I ain't had a drink today  
Would you believe I held her just to see how much she'd weight  
That cheatin' look that's on your face is lit up like a star  
So don't tell me you're sorry cause I know how sorry you are  
Don't tell me you're sorry but I'm as sorry as I can be  
Well you'd better move fast and don't give me no sass cause you belong to me  
Now honey we ain't done nothing wrong but I'm sorry it's gone this far  
But don't tell me you're sorry cause I know how sorry you are  
[ guitar ]  
Don't tell me you're sorry...  
Now wait a minute Loretta you know how sorry I am  
Conway you better believe I know how sorry you are
