We rode the train  
From Paris to the cold Atlantic shore  
The winter rain  
Kept us in each other's arms until the dawn  
Do you remember?  
  
Faster than the sun  
Flying higher than everyone  
Like a dream too good to last  
I won't regret the past  
  
[Chorus]  
Here with me  
Deep down in my soul now and forever  
A candle for the dark, I keep you  
Here with me  
A story with an unexpected end  
  
The morning plane  
Through empty doors a mountain in the sky  
The golden chain  
The autumn treetops cast a northern light  
Do you remember?  
  
We have no common ground  
Treasure lost will now be found  
We can blame our wild at heart  
From now and from the start  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Remember feelings I have shown  
Chasing dreams I've never done  
Illusion lead us both away  
Hold me in your arms before you go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Deep down in my soul you will be  
Here with me  
A story with an unexpected end  
Everywhere I go you're here with me
