All the things I said I wanted turned out to be heavan haunted  
Every time I dream I'm sharin  
All the things that I tried pairing too  
  
If the thought could ever barter  
Time enough to make a pedal  
Now I might help any other  
Now that's it I'll simply ponder you.  
Its hard to recognize that's all  
True it wasn't that at all  
  
I'm alone again  
Never thought I'd see the one I told you  
Head is along  
Over now  
  
All the things I said I wanted  
Turned out to be heavan haunted  
Every time the dream I'm sharin  
All the things that I tried pairing too  
If the thought could ever barter  
Time enough to make a pedal  
Now I might help any other  
Now that's it I'll simply ponder you.  
Its hard to recognize that's all  
True it wasn't that at all
