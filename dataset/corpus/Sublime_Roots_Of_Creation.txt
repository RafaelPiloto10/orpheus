Roots of creation  
I am living in a boring nation  
I pull up may hands and I look at my feet  
The reggae music make me sound so sweet  
Cause we play it morning evening and all of the day  
It's the sweet kinda music makes me feel O.K.  
The roots of creation  
I am living in a plastic nation  
I throw up my hands  
My hope is so wide  
Sometimes, sometimes I feel so high  
But all the time I feel irie  
I feel irie when I'm down with the scene  
Called roots of creation  
I am living in a plastic nation  
One more time!  
Well pull up here honey like you got limbo  
Well pull up your fingers like you're ready to go  
Give somthing high  
Give me something slow  
Give me something I can use  
Give me something I can know  
Your the body and the mind one  
Part of soul or two  
I feel a different person to be a different place  
I'm living in a different place  
Sometime I feel although its fin  
Pull up your style make it sound so fine  
With ah  
Pull up hands with me  
Roots of creation  
I am living in a boring nation  
A pull up sound with Mike Happoldt at my left  
I got Eric at my right  
We rock the reggae music every day and night  
We rock the reggae music say it's right on time  
When you're down with the music that they call Sublime  
I'm living in a different nation  
Reggae style again!  
Gonna win me back gonna feel so fine  
Bring me down to the place so right  
We rock the music so late at night  
With a guitar pick in my hand  
What amounts to make me a man

Called roots of creation  
I am living in a plastic nation  
I pull up my hand, left pocket  
Do the music, make me say me feel it  
Eric on my right, yes he knows I ain't wrong  
Read me on rights and me know me are wrong  
Me am a white boy but I sing a reggae song  
Called roots of creation  
I am living in a plastic nation

My ink is dry  
My love for you, it will never die  
Say me love you till me will testify  
Me love the music make me feel so high  
Song called roots of creation  
I am living in a plastic nation  
Oh in a plastic nation

Pull up here honey if you got limbo  
Pull it up make it up bounce I don't want it to be slow  
I want to make it sound right

Give me kind of music make you rock all night  
Like a roots of creation

So cheer up my life  
Cheer up my life

Take out take out the strife  
Give me some music make it sound so nice  
Give me kinda music make we want to singa song twice  
Like roots of creation

My seat is wobbly  
Pull up your hands and it sounds like this  
Cause I like my beer dry  
Drink the gin and the gin  
Love the kinda drink ya know make me sick

Make me drink gin like wine twice  
I only make me feel so sadder, aya
