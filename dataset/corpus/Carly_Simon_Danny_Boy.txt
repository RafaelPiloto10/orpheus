Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling  
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side  
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling  
'Tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bide.  
  
But come you back when summer's in the meadow  
Or all the valley's hushed and white with snow  
'Tis I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow  
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so.  
  
But when you come, when all the flowers are dying  
If I am dead, as dead I well may be  
Then if you bend and tell me that you love me  
I'll sleep in peace until you come to me  
  
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow  
Or all the valley's hushed and white with snow  
'Tis I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow  
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so.
