That's you  
That talk about your homie behind his back,  
But you always with him at every location he be at.  
That's you  
That be stealing from your momma,  
Knowing she be the only one at your side, helping you through your drama.  
That's you  
Selling crack but can't make no profit,  
Cause you smoking it up, and you just can't seem to stop it  
That's you  
That keep playing up without a rubber,  
Don't wanna claim your baby, you naked headed lover, that's your babies mother  
That's you  
A woman that's so deceitful, smiling as you do evil,  
Making money to set up your own people  
That's you  
Throwing pussy at your home girls husband every evening,  
Then try to convince her that he be cheating  
That's you  
Hate a woman doing better than you are,  
So you slash her tires and bust all the windows out her car  
That's you  
That can't get over your ex-man,  
Putting the problems of your previous relationship on the next man  
That's you  
  
[Chorus]  
(Outta be ashamed of your self)  
(Cause the shell of a man playing games with your self)  
(That's you)  
(Making the real women look fake)  
(Only hurting yourself with the decisions that you make)  
(That's you) [Repeat: x2]  
  
That beats your kid, coz somebody said he done something,  
But you don't even go see if he did  
That's you  
Still living in your parents home,  
You got a good paying job but wont even pay for the phone  
That's you  
With that unattractive attitude,  
People don't wanna be around you cause you be ruining they mood  
That's you  
That's thinking somebody owe you something,  
And ain't goin' be satisfied until somebody show you something  
That's you  
Rollin your eyes, and popping your neck,  
Cause you were the high roller, but homie only want you for sex  
That's you  
Think you the shit because your body is tight,  
What you goin' do if god decide to change that over night  
That's you  
That can't stay at woman's place, hit a man,  
Hoping he hit you back, so you can take his freedom away?  
That's you  
That enjoy making people lives hard,  
But when trouble come around your way you go running to god  
That's you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
That get up every night to go out and jack,  
But you reap what you sew, so don't get mad when it come back  
That's you  
That been out committing all that crime,  
Now you suicidal cause you gotta do all that time  
That's you  
Spending all of your money on beer and blunts,  
And ain't got nothing on your bills come the first of the month?  
That's you  
That don't care about how stupid your act,  
Man I'm so glad I'm no longer living my life like that  
That's you  
Trying to fuck over people who work for you,  
Even with all of that money ain't no peace on earth for ya  
That's you  
Yea that's you that made your homeboys hate ya,  
Can't go no where without a gun cause you're nervous by nature  
That's you  
That's in and out of jail on the same charge,  
Get out and go do the same thing on the same boulevard  
That's you  
That's gonna end up in the funeral home,  
You bobbin your head but I know you can't stand this song  
That's you  
  
[Chorus]
