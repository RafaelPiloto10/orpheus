Upon the wings of a dream she rides  
Oh, she comes to me, fills me with life  
Towards the dark side of the moon, we glide  
She sings me a tune on our way through the silvery starlight  
  
I don't wont to wake up this time  
I'm alive on this serpent ride  
  
In the grace of our love we writhe in pain  
Farther into the song I fall, mesmerized  
A drop of her blood tastes like wine  
I answer her call with a rhyme:  
  
"That is not dead which can eternal lie  
Yet with strange aeons death may die"  
  
In your eyes lies the world where I don't wanna go  
You said you'd changed, but I don't believe in miracles  
Since you conquered my heart we've never been apart  
One day we'll close our eyes, open them again  
And discover each other  
  
As I open up my eyes she greets me with a smile  
From her wrists flows wine
