Hey, pretty baby  
Don't you think you might give me a chance  
Get it on with me  
Go down-town for some loving romance  
And I know I ain't nothing  
I ain't worth but a thin dime  
But if you put your heart in my hands  
I'm sure that I could change your mind  
  
I want to boogie with you  
Yeah, I want to boogie with you  
  
There's something, baby, on which your parents  
Both agree  
And that is that they both have a  
Deep distrust for me  
And your best friend Frankie  
Well, I know, your best friend Frankie, he wants to see me sink  
And I don't much blame him for that  
He gets so useless after so few drinks, you know, baby  
  
I want to boogie with you  
I want to boogie with you  
  
Well, I know your little baby sister  
She thinks that I'm a flop  
Well, I guess that you know that it's true  
I spent more time at the bottom than the top  
Tell your little sister  
I know she wants to give me a whirl  
But I don't have the time, baby  
To wait till she's grown up, and she's a woman, not a girl  
  
Don't you know, I want to boogie with you  
Hey, I want to boogie with you  
I want to boogie with you  
I want to boogie with you, yeah  
  
Boogie with you  
Down by the corner  
We'll be able to, yeah
