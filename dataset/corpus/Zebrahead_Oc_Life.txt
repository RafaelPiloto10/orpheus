So I want to be a member and I want to be a name  
And I want to be a local face and play the social game  
Dancing through a time warp in your dinosaur trends  
The limit of your mind is what they're counting on all ends  
Listen to the media present it as a fact  
Fall in your orders 'cause you don't know how to act  
Travel on estranged 'cause you don't know your own way  
They'll get you in the end then you'll pay  
'cause O.C. life is not the life for me  
Stupid little chicks and, egotistic boys  
O.C. life is not the life so free  
Pressures on my back  
and artificial joys . . . for you girls and boys  
want to be a member, want to have some fame  
Fighting to stay ahead a part of the game  
Combat authority but don't get out of line  
Or they'll put you in the slammer you'll be doing some time  
714 tattooed on my head  
I find myself labeled that I'm a victim instead  
I fight all the rules I don't see the way  
I'd rather be dead then pay the price that they say  
'cause O.C. life is not the life for me  
Stupid little girls And egotistic boys  
O.C. life is not the life for free  
Pressures on my back  
and artificial joys . . . for you girls and boys  
Put the plastic back in the machine
