As the light across the room flickers  
It's dying song waited for a reason to keep going on  
The sweetest smile is now turned bitter by these thoughts  
So I wonder the dark of my own, I should've known all along  
  
The love without tears,  
Just a story told to keep us hanging on in the cold all along  
Baby in fear I sing  
Love without tears, love without tears  
  
Goes to the side in here a boy who can't let go  
Won't take no for an answer  
Crying his for, I should've known all along  
  
Love without tears,  
Just a story told to keep us hanging on in the cold all along  
Baby in fear I sing  
Love without tears, love without tears  
  
Go on and prove me wrong  
  
I should've known all along  
That love without tears,  
Just a story told to keep us hanging on in the cold all along  
Baby in fear I sing  
Love without tears, love without tears  
  
Go on and prove me wrong  
  
Love without tears, love without tears  
Please let me be someone
