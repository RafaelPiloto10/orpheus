Straight shot of misery  
Some days make a mess of me  
I touch the ground when I can find my feet  
You know it all comes down to love  
  
I tell myself I can do it all  
I juggle everything  
I drop the ball  
Sometimes it feels my life's impossible  
But then it all comes down to  
  
Love  
I'd love to take you on a time machine  
Fill those cracks things fall between  
So we could find more days to fly away from the hurricane  
But in the ebb and flow  
It all comes down to love  
Oh, it all comes down to love  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
The clock chimes  
The babies cry  
I turn around and they've grown so high  
As I let 'em grow  
I watch 'em fly  
You know it all comes down to love  
  
I light the candles and I cut the cake  
Make a wish for every heart that breaks  
Sweet forgiveness never made a mistake  
You know it all comes down to  
  
Love  
I could love you 'till my heart's content  
So you must be Heaven sent  
The way you sweep me up in your arms in the middle of an argument  
And you let me know  
It all comes down to love  
Oh, it all comes down to love  
  
Take you down to guts and the rubble  
Diggin' up the deeper stuff  
You gotta trust when you're runnin' into trouble  
That it all comes down to  
  
Love  
Love  
Love  
Love  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
You know it all comes down to love  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
You know it all comes down to love  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
You know it all comes down to love  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
You know it all comes down to love
