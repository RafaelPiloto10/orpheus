[Chorus:]  
Echo,  
Echo-ooo  
We come and we go  
No, I don't want to be just another  
Echo  
Echo-ooo  
  
Everywhere I go  
Something that I really need  
Everyone I know  
Someone that i want to be.  
  
Even though,  
I don't really know  
I better pick it up  
Before I let it slip away  
I better stick it out  
Before I take another day.  
  
Into now  
Every word I say, fades out.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Can only open up your eyes  
When the clouds break  
Can only feel alive  
Even though the world shakes.  
  
Every night  
You're in my quiet, sateen, light.  
Can I hold you close  
To a rather full moon kiss.  
  
Everything I know  
I don't even know who it is  
  
It all falls through  
I'm here and I hear you.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Do you hear me?  
Do you hear me?  
'Cause I need to, just to reach you  
Can you hear me?  
Coming clearly?  
Am I hollow?  
Just an echo?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Hello?)Echo  
Echo-ooo  
(Do you hear me?) We come and we go  
(Hello?) No, I don't want to be just another  
(Do you hear me?)Echo  
Echo-ooo  
  
It's just another day  
And every single word I say, fades out.
