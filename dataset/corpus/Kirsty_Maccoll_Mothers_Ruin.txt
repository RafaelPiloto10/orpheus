'Mother's ruin', she said to herself  
"I'm just screwing my own mental health"  
But Fridays and Saturdays  
She walks down those alleyways  
A latter day lady of the lamp  
How you doing? You ain't from round here  
Won't you come in? I'm really not scared  
'Cause Fridays and Saturdays  
I still do it anyways  
And anything is better than out there  
Now don't wake me up again  
Don't let me feel anything  
But when you go, let me dream that I go with you  
So I won't cry myself dry anymore  
Mother's ruin, their own little girls  
Keep them dreaming, there's more to this world  
But turn her the other way  
And every day is 'Father's Day'  
He stays until there's nothing left to say  
But don't wake me up again  
Don't let me feel anything  
But when you go, let me dream that I go with you  
'Cause I can't take it 'round here anymore  
Now don't wake me up again  
Don't let me feel anything  
But when you go, let me dream that I go with you  
So you won't make my heart ache anymore  
Leave the light on and don't shut the door
