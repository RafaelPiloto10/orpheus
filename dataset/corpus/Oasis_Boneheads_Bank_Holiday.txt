You know I need a little break  
To get away for a holiday  
So I can see the sun  
'Cause in the sun they say it's fun  
If you can get some  
Well I could take a train or a boat or an aeroplane  
Or I could steal a car  
'Cause in a car you can go far  
Just depends what kinda car you are  
  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
What kinda car you are  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
  
I met a funny looking girl  
On a crowded beach in Spain  
Her name was Avaline  
She said she came to Spain to have a good time  
But she was with her mum  
Who had a face like a nun in pain  
She said her name was Dot  
She didn't half talk a lot  
I couldn't tell if she was mad or not  
  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
  
Don't you know - I should have stayed in England  
On my polluted beach - with all my special friends  
Don't ya know - I should have stayed in England  
With my big house and my big car  
And all my friends there at the bar  
  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la  
  
You know I need a little break  
To get away for a holiday  
So I can see the sun  
'Cause in the sun they say it's fun  
If you can get some  
Well I could take a train or a boat or an aeroplane  
Or I could steal a car  
'Cause in a car you can go far  
It just depends on what kind of car you are  
  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
What kind of car you are  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
