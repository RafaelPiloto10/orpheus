Floatin' round my brain,  
Tryin' to think about the other thing.  
Than that thought you know I'm considering.  
What if what I thought,  
About who I think I though I was,  
Was nothing more than my cerebellum slobbering?  
Azwethinkweizm is hard to think about,  
But simple to trust.  
  
You'll know your on it  
When your brain won't stop to take a break, no!  
So when donut boy comes askin' around,  
Tryin' to figure out somethin' new,  
You just smile and say,  
"Pardon you! I'm sifting through  
Some particles and farcing through some folds.  
I've stumbled upon a brain fart  
Which melts away your molds!"  
  
So I think upon that ponder  
While I'm pondering the thought,  
Just thinkin' about the thinkweiz  
Is leaving me distraught!  
Well I think I thought  
I saw an Azwethinkweiz,  
Lookin' like we think we do.  
Like we think we do.  
  
Some think I'm insane,  
'Cause I think about the other thing,  
Than that one thought you call reality.  
What if what you thought,  
About who you think you thought you were,  
Was nothing more than illusion rapidly crumbling!  
Azwethinkweism should be a topic we all can trust.  
  
It's just to bad it makes your  
Head go zippity crack dang!  
So when donut boy comes sniffing around  
Trying to figure out something new,  
You just laugh and say, "Pardon you,  
I'm sifting through some particles and  
Farcing through some folds.  
  
I've stumbled upon a brain fart  
Which melts away your molds."  
So I think upon that ponder  
While I'm pondering the thought,  
Just thinking about the thinkweiz  
Is leaving me distraught.  
  
Well I think I thought I saw an Azwethinkweiz,  
Lookin' like we think we do.  
Like we think we do.  
So what if you thought about the thinkweiz  
Was nothing like you think you are?  
You'd probably more than likely be a  
Looky-loo lookin' like you think you do.  
Like you think you do.
