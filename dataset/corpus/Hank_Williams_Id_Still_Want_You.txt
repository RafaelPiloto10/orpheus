I could shame you 'til you hide your face  
And drag you right down in disgrace  
But what good would it do  
I know I'd still want you  
I could tell the world you're doin' wrong  
That I was stringin' you along  
And if it all were true  
I know I'd still want you  
This world with me might sympathize  
When I got through with all my lies  
But I'd be just as blue  
'Cause my heart would still want you  
Cry, oh, Lord  
I could tell my friends I threw you down  
And slander your name all over town  
But what good would it do  
I know I'd still want you  
If I said I'm happy to be free  
The only one I'd fool is me  
Because it isn't true  
I know I'd still want you  
What's the use to say that you're no good  
When I'd crawl back if I could  
No matter what you do  
I know I'd still want you  
Cry, oh, Lord  
I could smile and say that I don't care  
And then go home and pull my hair  
But what good would it do  
I know I'd still want you  
I could say that someone put me wise  
And get revenge by telling lies  
But when I got all through  
I know I'd still want you  
If the things I said was to break your heart  
I'd be the first to take your part  
'Cause if all these lies were true  
I know I'd still want you  
Cry, oh, Lord
