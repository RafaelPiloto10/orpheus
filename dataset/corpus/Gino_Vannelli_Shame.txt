The citys burning with desire  
High-heeled chicks turnin tricks in a trance  
Pin-stripe zombies on fire  
Sayin hey baby, heres a dime for a dance  
(out on the street)  
I see innocent faces in the rain  
(out on the street)  
I see make-up runnin down from tears of pain  
Down the drain  
  
Shame  
Now mama tell it like it is  
Its a shame  
For what papa did  
Its a shame  
Your sister shouldve told you so  
Its a shame  
Cause nobody wants to know  
  
The neon moon turns red around midnight  
Junior junkies and runaway girls  
Blue eyed babies posing in the headlights  
Another stray cat in a dog eat dog world  
(out on the street)  
Aint no room for no cheap talkin prayer  
(out on the street)  
You don't know what it's like till you're there  
And you're runnin scared  
  
Shame  
Now mama tell it like it is  
Its a shame  
The way papa hurt his kid  
Its a shame  
Your sister shouldve told you so  
Its a shame  
Cmon man let her go  
  
So young  
Yet so old  
So hard to find a friend  
She lives from lover to lover  
Till there's nothing left of her  
Yeah sweet daddy scores again  
  
Shame  
Now mama tell it like it is  
Its a shame  
The way papa hurt his kid  
Its a shame  
Your sister shouldve told you so  
Its a shame  
Cmon man let her go  
  
The world shouldve let you know  
Cmon man let her go  
Shame on the school  
Shame on the teacher  
Shame on those sticky little fingers all over that helpless creature  
Shame on the parish  
Shame on the preacher  
From where he stands that man don't have half a chance to reach her  
Shame shame shame  
On me and you  
Shame shame shame  
Now what are we goin to do
