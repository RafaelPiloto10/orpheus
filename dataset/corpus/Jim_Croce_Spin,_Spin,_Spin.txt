Spin, spin, spin  
Spin around, spin around  
  
The harlequin dances in a costume of green  
Spin around  
But under his makeup his age can't be seen  
Spin around  
But where are you spinnin'  
When will you know  
That life is for livin'  
That it isn't a show?  
  
Spin, spin, spin  
Spin around, spin around  
  
You look out on the city from your penthouse so high  
Spin around  
But your pedestal's your prison and so is your high  
Spin around  
But where are you spinnin'  
When will you know  
That life is for livin'  
That it isn't a show?  
  
Spin, spin, spin  
Spin around, spin around  
  
Your pills are you conscience  
They make ev'rything seem all right  
Spin around  
Take a white one go to sleep  
Take a red one to stay up all night  
To spin around  
But where are you spinnin'  
When will you know  
That life is for livin'  
That it isn't a show?  
Spin, spin, spin  
Spin around, spin around  
Spin, spin, spin  
Spin away, spin away  
Spin, spin, spin  
Spin around, spin around
