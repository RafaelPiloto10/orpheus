I cried all night for Sonny  
'Til my eyes were dry  
'Til the oceans overflowed  
And the Red Sea turned blue  
I cried all night for Sonny  
I heard he was crying, too  
  
I cried all night for Sonny  
We shook hands and said goodbye  
His face was etched with sorrow  
His heart without a hue  
I cried all night for Sonny  
I heard he was crying, too  
  
When you try and love two people  
You can't love either one  
'Cause after a while you'll have to choose  
Or else love self denial  
  
I stayed all night with Sonny  
Like there'd never be another day  
Go on and sleep 'til sunset  
And I'll watch over you  
I cried all night for Sonny  
I know he was crying, too
