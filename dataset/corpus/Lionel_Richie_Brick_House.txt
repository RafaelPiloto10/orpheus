[Chorus:]  
She's a brick----house  
Mighty might just lettin' it all hang out  
She's a brick----house  
The lady's stacked and that's a fact,  
Ain't holding nothing back.  
  
She's a brick----house  
She's the one, the only one,  
Who's built like a amazon [pronounced am-a-ka-zawn]  
We're together everybody knows,  
And here's how the story goes.  
  
She knows she got everything  
A woman needs to get a man, yeah.  
How can she lose with what she use  
36-24-36, what a winning hand!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The clothes she wears, the sexy ways,  
Make an old man wish for younger days  
She knows she's built and knows how to please  
Sure enough to knock a man to his knees  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Shake it down, shake it down now (repeat)
