We all know about the hate you're breeding  
And we pay for the machine you're feeding  
You can never shut up, you can never shut down  
This house divided...  
  
(We all know, we all know, something's wrong, we all know)  
  
Something's wrong about the way you're thinking  
The rats are jumping, and your ship is sinking  
You can never get on, you can never get off  
This house divided...  
  
We all hear about this case you're pleading  
Your demands have gone beyond conceding  
You can never get in, you can never get out  
This house divided...  
  
This is a sad day for violence  
When speech results in silence  
I'm supposed to hate you  
You're supposed to hate me  
We can never agree  
  
[Solo: Chris]  
  
Now we've become so desperate  
Don't you forget you asked for it!  
I'm supposed to hate you  
You're supposed to hate me  
We never agree  
  
[Solo: Chris]  
  
[Solo: Dave]  
  
We all know about the hate you're breeding  
And we pay for the machine you're feeding  
  
A house divided...
