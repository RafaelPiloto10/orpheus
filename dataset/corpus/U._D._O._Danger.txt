Fearing the day - hiding the light  
My mind is shocked with fever  
Evil will play - night after night  
They are the soul receivers  
  
Yeah, they are strangers in the night  
Yeah, they're endangering your life  
Drinking your tears - embracing your fears  
  
[Chorus:]  
Danger - the lair is hard to find  
Danger - so keep that in your mind  
Ripping me up - tearing me down  
My soul is crying "action!"  
Terror is king but I got the crown  
I'll start a chain reaction  
  
[Bridge]  
Danger - a madness in the air  
Danger - dimensions everywhere  
  
Whispering names on lonely roads  
With eyes camouflaged in shadows  
They stalk the earth in silent packs  
No time to die tomorrow  
  
[Chorus]
