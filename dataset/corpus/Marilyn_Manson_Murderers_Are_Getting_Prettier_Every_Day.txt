Do you always  
Have to hire actors  
To play the devils  
That talk me  
Out of my  
Sui-sites?  
  
You're just a ring tone  
That happens when  
You get sick enough  
To call the one  
With bullet holes  
Bullet holes for eyes  
  
Fall on your knees  
I hear the horrid voices  
Of someone else's angels  
Fall on your knees  
I hear the horrid voices  
Of someone else's angels  
  
I broken open the box  
When I spoke the spell  
And I became  
An entrance wound  
To your bedroom grave  
And I was paid  
With the shadow of consensual rape  
  
Your ransom note  
Is quoted by  
Your death and  
Birth certificates  
And all of your love  
And all of your love letters  
Read just like my will  
  
Fall on your knees  
I hear the horrid voices  
Of someone else's angels  
Fall on your knees  
I hear the horrid voices  
Of someone else's angels  
  
I don't have to see  
To know that murderers  
Are getting prettier  
Every day  
I don't have to see  
To know that murderers  
Are getting prettier  
Every day  
I don't have to see  
To know that murderers  
Are getting prettier  
Every day  
  
Fall on your knees  
I hear the horrid voices  
Of someone else's angels  
Fall on your knees  
I hear the horrid voices  
Of someone else's angels  
Fall on your knees  
I hear the horrid voices  
Of someone else's angels
