I've got no money  
Could you spare a dime?  
I got the plan  
If you got the time  
  
If you take me there  
You can claim your share  
Of the action  
Been on the road  
  
For a long time now  
Paid all my dues  
Oh, I'm ready now  
If you take me there  
  
You can claim your share  
Of the action  
Oh, for a piece of the action  
Oh, for a slice of the cake  
  
Oh, for a piece of the action  
Oh, for a slice of the cake  
Sometimes I feel  
As I'm going down  
  
That nothing can stop me  
From losing ground  
If you take me there  
You can claim your share  
  
Of the action  
Oh, for a piece of the action  
Oh, for a slice of the cake  
Oh, for a piece of the action  
  
Oh, for a slice of the cake  
For a slice of the cake  
Oh, oh, oh
