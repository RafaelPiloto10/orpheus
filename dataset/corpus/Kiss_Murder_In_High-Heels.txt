Hey, with a sleight of hand and then a word of mouth  
She's a cat been caged too long and now she's breakin' out  
Well, get it straight, you better cross your heart  
'Cause sparks are gonna fly, let me tell you what it's all about  
Better run for cover, babe, she's gonna make her move  
You know she could, she's a get rich bitch  
You better get her while the gettin's good  
  
She's a vision in leather, like salt on a wound  
Just a turn of a knob and she's real fine tuned  
  
But she's murder in high-heels  
  
She ain't the girl next door worth waitin' for  
Well you're playin' with the fire, a pool of sweat's lyin' on the floor  
She'll bring you to your knees, and when you're laid to rest  
She's gonna give you something, she's gonna get it off her chest  
(Yeah yeah yeah)  
  
She's a vision in leather, like salt on a wound  
Just a turn of a knob and she's real fine tuned - here she comes  
  
He's a vision in leather, like salt on a wound  
Just a turn of a knob and she's real fine tuned  
  
But she's murder in high heels
