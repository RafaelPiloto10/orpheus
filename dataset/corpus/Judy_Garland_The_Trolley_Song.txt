With my high starched-collar and my high-topped shoes  
And my hair piled high upon my head,  
I went to lose a jolly hour on the trolley  
And lost my heart instead.  
With his light brown derby and his bright green tie,  
He was quite the handsomest of men.  
I started to yen so I counted to ten  
Then I counted to ten again.  
  
Clang, clang, clang went the trolley,  
Ding, ding, ding went the bell,  
Zing, zing, zing went my heart strings,  
From the moment I saw him I fell.  
Chug, chug, chug went the motor,  
Bump, bump, bump went the brake,  
Thump, thump, thump went my heart strings,  
When he smiled I could feel the car shake.  
He tipped his hat, and took a seat.  
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet.  
He asked my name, I held my breath.  
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death.  
  
Chug, chug, chug went the motor,  
Pop, pop, pop went the wheels,  
Stop, stop, stop went my heart strings,  
As he started to go then I started to know how it feels,  
When the universe reels.  
  
The day was bright, the air was sweet,  
The smell of honeysuckle charmed you off your feet.  
You tried to sing, but couldn't squeak,  
In fact you loved him so you couldn't even speak.  
  
Buzz, buzz, buzz went the buzzer,  
Plop, plop, plop went the wheels,  
Stop, stop, stop went my heart strings,  
As he started to leave,  
I took hold of his sleeve with my hand,  
And as if it were planned,  
He stayed on with me and it was grand just to stand  
With his hand holding mine to the end of the line.
