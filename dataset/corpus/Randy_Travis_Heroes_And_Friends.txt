I ain't live forever but I've lived enough  
And I've learned to be gentle and I've learned to be tough  
I've found only two things that last to the end  
One is your heroes and the other your friends  
  
Your heroes will help you find good in yourself  
Your friends won't forsake you for somebody else  
They'll both stand beside you through thick and through thin  
And that's how it goes with heroes and friends  
  
I grew up with cowboys I watched on tv  
My friends and I sometimes pretended to be  
Years have gone by but now and again  
My heart rides the range with my heroes and friends  
  
Your heroes will help you find good in yourself  
Your friends won't forsake you for somebody else  
They'll both stand beside you through thick and through thin  
And that's how it goes with heroes and friends  
  
Your heroes will help you find good in yourself  
Your friends won't forsake you for somebody else  
They'll both stand beside you through thick and through thin  
And that's how it goes with heroes and friends  
  
That's how it goes with heroes and friends
