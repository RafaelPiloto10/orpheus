I keep bumpin' into trees  
Eyes wide open I can't see (mississippi downtown)  
We're in the blindfold of love  
I can't find my way downtown  
Everything spins around and around (mississippi downtown)  
We're in the blindfold of love.  
  
I was hooked right from the start  
And it's tearing me apart  
That little girl's got a bear hug on my heart  
I stay worried all the time  
I can't get it off my mind (mississippi downtown)  
We're in the blindfold of love.  
  
(Mississippi downtown, Mississippi downtown.)  
  
I'm as lost as I can be  
Being in love is killin' me (mississippi downtown)  
We're in the blindfold of love.  
I can't see across the street  
To recognize the friends I meet (mississippi downtown)  
We're in the blindfold of love.  
  
I was hooked right from the start  
And it's tearing me apart  
That little girl's got a bearhug on my heart  
I stay worried all the time  
I can't get it off my mind (mississippi downtown)  
We're in the blindfold of love.  
  
(Mississippi downtown, Mississippi downtown.)  
  
Well, I was a-hooked right from the start  
And it's tearing me apart  
That little girl's got a bearhug on my heart  
I stay worried all the time  
I can't get it off my mind (mississippi downtown)  
We're in the blindfold of love.  
  
(Mississippi downtown.)  
We're in the blindfold of love.  
(Mississippi downtown.)
