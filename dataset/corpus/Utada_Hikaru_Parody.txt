Late night broadcast  
The TV looks at me with its blue eyes  
No matter how often I change the channel  
I can't escape that gaze  
No matter how many times I look in the fridge  
It's the same answer, an answer I'm used to hearing  
The timelimit is about up  
I need more time, let me be  
Oh no, this is a parody  
But to me, it's my life story  
Without waiting for me, the clock  
Pretends not to know anything  
I know, it's a common story  
But to me, it's my life story  
Not being some copy of someone else  
I'll write the rest of it from now  
Facing the same way with everyone else  
It's the freeway  
It's just a coincidence  
When the road split, it was sudden  
Hurry me to the seventh floor, please  
The elevator is unusually small  
But no one else is here, so I feel safe  
Set me free from "thoughtfulness"  
Oh no, everything's a parody  
But to everyone, it's a true story  
Without putting any strength into it  
You pretend that you don't need anything  
I know a couple that looks just like us  
But they do nothing but argue  
Without putting much priority on it  
I'll read the rest of it from now  
Oh no, this is probably a parody  
I'm sure for someone, it's a fake story  
I can't wear any shoes but my own  
That's alright, since I can walk like that  
I know, it's a common story  
But to me, it's a real story  
Without waiting for the rest of it  
I'll go to see you from now
