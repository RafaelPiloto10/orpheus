Have fun  
And if you can't have fun  
Have someone else's fun  
'Cause someone sure had mine  
They came in  
now they're having a whale of a time  
  
You should grow a beard  
A beard to tell a thousand stories never told before  
A beard to tell you tales, whilst the fireplace roars  
The closing of relationships and the opening of doors  
The starting of hostilities and the ending of wars  
  
Take care  
And if you couldn't care  
Take someone else's care  
'Cause someone took my care  
They went there and then they were not there  
  
We should have a baby  
And then I wouldn't feel quite so sad  
Then I'd feel like Paul the Saint and not Jack the Lad  
A baby that'll make me feel so very glad  
I've had a life of booze, but that's all I've ever had  
  
'Cause I'm the King of Misery  
The Prince of the torn apart  
And you're the lighthouse keeper  
To the owner of a ship-wrecked heart  
  
Take heart  
And if you can't take heart  
Take someone else's heart  
Someone took my heart  
They came in, now I'm torn apart  
  
We should grey together  
Not that pigeon-chested Trafalgar grey  
The grey that greets you on that first October day  
The grey of Russian front, whilst wolves bay  
And the skeleton of life that love decays  
  
'Cause you're the Queen of Sadness  
The Princess of the House of Pain  
And you're the final match  
To the holder of this flickering flame  
  
Have fun
