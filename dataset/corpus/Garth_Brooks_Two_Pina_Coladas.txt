I was feelin' the blues  
I was watching the news  
When this fella came on the TV  
He said I'm tellin' you  
That science has proven  
That heartaches are healed by the sea  
That got me goin'  
Without even knowin'  
I packed right up and drove down  
Now I'm on a roll  
And I swear to my soul  
Tonight I'm gonna paint this town  
So bring me two pina coladas  
I want one for each hand  
Let's set sail with Captin Morgan  
And never leave dry land  
Any troubles I forgot 'em  
I buried 'em in the sand  
So bring me two pina coladas  
She said good-bye to her good timin' man  
Oh now I've gotta say  
That the wind and the waves  
And the moon winkin' down at me  
Eases my mind  
By leavin' behind  
The heartaches that love often brings  
Now I've got a smile  
That goes on for miles  
With no inclination to roam  
I've gotta say  
That I think I've gotta stay  
'Cause this is feelin' more and more like home  
So bring me two pina coladas  
Gotta have one for each hand  
Let's set sail with Captin Morgan  
Oh and never leave dry land  
Any troubles I forgot 'em  
I buried 'em in the sand  
So bring me two pina coladas  
She said good-bye to her good timin' man  
Bring me bring me two pina coladas  
I want one for each hand  
Let's set sail with Captin Morgan  
Oh and never leave dry land  
Any troubles I forgot 'em  
I buried 'em in the sand  
So bring me two pina coladas  
And say hello to her good timin' man
