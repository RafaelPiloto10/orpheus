For 40 years I ruled alone  
She'd all those tears while on the throne  
What got me through the pain and hurt  
Was clinging to the memory of Albert.  
  
I loved her so, my darling Vicky  
So much, you know almost made me sicky  
I was not liked in your country  
But who cares when I had her love for me  
Her love for me  
  
Oh V and A  
Oh A and V  
Each way it spells L O V E  
Oh A and V  
Oh V and A  
They'll name a building after us one day  
  
In love from our first Rendezvous  
As queen had to propose to you  
You were my rock in a crisis  
Like when someone tried to shoot you but they missed  
  
We were a real celebrity pair  
Was first Queen Vic, first Albert Square  
The press watched every smile and flirt  
Called us Alboria but I prefer Vicbert  
Or you can call me Al  
  
Oh Bert and Vic  
Oh Vic and Bert  
Nine kids made me found in hurt  
Oh Vic and Bert  
Oh Bert and Vic  
Yet I found babies ugly ironic  
  
Eur! My eyes!  
  
We set trends,  
Started new traditions.  
Christmas trees,  
Wearing tartan with style.  
Albert backed  
The Great Exhibition.  
Which made great Britain,  
Albert-o-phile.  
  
At last!  
  
Oh Vic and Al  
Oh Al and Vic  
You showed our kids love with your stick  
Oh Al and Vic  
Oh Vic and Al  
Ours was a truly grand affair royale.  
  
Then Albert died  
Which left just me  
Just V no A  
No A just V  
Oh how I mourned my special pal  
I love you Vic  
I love you Al
