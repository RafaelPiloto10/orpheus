Loving is fun when the dangers begun  
And you're makin' me run again oh-oh-oh  
When you're calling I'm climbing the wall  
I know that I'm only to blame  
Feels so divine when you're close to the line  
And there's reason to run again oh-oh-oh  
Make me wait it's a beautiful ache  
I know that it's part of the game  
  
I've got mud on my face  
From every thrill of the chase  
But I'm fine  
My heart is heavy with dirt  
And every little bit hurts  
I don't mind  
I give as good as Itake  
And boy you're letting me break my rules  
I love the lows and the highs  
You make me twinkle inside  
And I'm cool  
  
It doesn't matter what the movies say  
(Oh no) I like it better when you walk away  
And you can fool me with those golden eyes  
(Oh yeah) We're on the road to knowing satisfied  
  
Chorus  
'Cos loving you don't mean Ilost my groove  
And baby breakfast in bed don't mean I'll get in the mood  
'Cos loving you don't make me on your side  
You can't take the diamonds that are in my eyes  
'Cos loving you don't mean Ilost my groove  
And baby breakfast in bed don't mean I'll get in the mood  
'Cos loving you don't make me on your side  
You can't take the diamonds that are in my eyes  
  
So when the good times fly and it's cold outside  
I won't be dancing with myself  
And if the world's unfair and it's cold out there  
I won't be dancing with myself  
So when I got no jive and it's cold outside  
I won't be dancing with myself  
I let my heartbeat go 'cos inside I know  
I won't be dancing with myself  
  
It doesn't matter what the movies say  
(Oh no) I like it better when you walk away  
And you can fool me with those golden eyes  
(Oh yeah) We're on the road to knowing satisfied  
  
It doesn't matter what the movies say  
(Oh no) I like it better when you walk away  
And you can fool me with those golden eyes  
(Oh yeah) We're on the road to knowing satisfied  
(satisfied, satisfied, satisfied)
