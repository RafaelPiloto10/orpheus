Oh no-there's got to be a better way  
Say it again  
There's got to be a better way-yeah  
What is it good for?  
War has caused unrest  
Among the younger generation  
Induction then destruction  
Who wants to die?  
War-huh  
What is it good for?  
Absolutely nothing  
Say it again  
War-huh  
What is it good for?  
Absolutely nothing  
Yeah  
War-I despise  
'Cause it means destruction  
Of innocent lives  
War means tears  
To thousands of mothers how  
When their sons go off to fight  
And lose their lives  
I said  
War-huh  
It's an enemy of all mankind  
No point of war  
'Cause you're a man  
War has caused unrest  
Among the younger generation  
Induction then destruction  
Who wants to die?  
Give it to me one time-now  
Give it to me one time-now  
War has shattered  
Many young men's dreams  
We've got no place for it today  
They say we must fight to keep our freedom  
But Lord, there's just got to be a better way  
It ain't nothing but a heartbreaker  
War  
Friend only to the undertaker  
War  
War  
War-good God, now  
Now  
Give it to me one time now  
Now now  
What is it good for?
