If I was the sun way up there  
I'd go with love most everywhere  
I'll be the moon when the sun goes down  
Just to let you know that I'm still around  
  
That's how strong my love is, whoa  
That's how strong my love is  
That's how strong my love is, baby, baby  
That's how strong my love is  
  
I'll be the weeping willow drowning in my tears  
And you can go swimming when you're here  
And I'll be the rainbow after the tears are gone  
Wrap you in my colors and keep you warm  
  
That's how strong my love is, darling  
That's how strong my love is, baby  
That's how strong my love is, whoa  
That's how strong my love is  
  
I'll be the ocean so deep and wide  
And catch the tears whenever you cry  
I'll be the breeze after the storm is gone  
To dry your eyes and love you warm  
  
That's how strong my love is, baby  
That's how strong my love is  
That's how strong my love is, darling  
That's how strong my love is, again now  
  
That's how strong my love is, so deep and, wide  
That's how strong my love is  
So much love, yes so much love, whoa  
Yes so much love, yes so much love  
Anything that I can do, I'll be good for you  
Any kind of love you want, I'll be with you
