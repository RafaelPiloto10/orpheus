Spoken Introduction:  
While the storm clouds gather far across the sea,  
Let us swear allegiance to a land that's free,  
Let us all be grateful for a land so fair,  
As we raise our voices in a solemn prayer.  
  
Song:  
God bless America,  
Land that I love.  
Stand beside her, and guide her,  
Through the night with the light from above.  
  
From the mountains, to the prairies,  
To the oceans, wide with hope,  
God bless America,  
My home sweet home.
