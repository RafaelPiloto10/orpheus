You can have it if you really want  
You can grasp it if you have the thought  
Feel your power that is deep within  
Are you ready ?  
  
On your mark begin  
We should take time out to really love  
We should find out who we really are  
We should take time out to really love  
  
Do you feel your life's a big mistake ?  
Don't you hate the way it's all so fake ?  
All I want to do is just be real  
And get off of the spinning wheel  
  
All they sell us is a pack of lies  
And we're buying one in every size  
Can't you see it in the children's eyes ?  
It's about to get wild  
  
We should take time out to really love  
We should find out who we really are  
We should take time out to really love  
Ha yeah  
  
We should take time out to really love  
We should find out who we really are  
We should take time out to really love  
We should take time out to really love  
  
We should find out who we really are  
You can have it any way you want it  
You can have it any way you want it  
We should take time out to really love  
  
We should find out who we really are  
You can have it any way you want it  
You can have it any way you want it  
We should take time out to really love  
  
We should find out who we really are  
You can have it any way you want it  
Any you want it  
You can have it any way you want it  
  
Hey hey  
We should take time out to really love  
We should find out who we really are  
You can have it any way you want it  
  
Any you want it  
You can have it any way you want it  
Hey hey  
We should take time out to really love  
  
We should find out who we really are  
You can have it any way you want it  
You can have it any way you want it
