Yeah we're not the only ones  
Who bleed for the love that's lost  
Trust like the air we breathe  
Live you've got to lose some sleep  
Everything you do for me  
Everything I do for you  
Everything you do for me  
No one else comes close to you  
  
You laugh when the cool gets cold  
Cry when the punch lines told  
Fall into the arms of god  
Pray that your souls not sold  
Change keeps us moving on  
Alone as you walk through the crowd  
Live we're gonna lose some sleep  
Trust like the air we both breathe  
  
Anything I do for you  
Anything you do for me  
  
The way you see the world  
The way you see the world  
The way you see the world  
The way, yeah.  
  
Everything you do for me  
Everything I do for you  
  
The way you see the world  
No one else comes close to you  
  
Ah yeah, ah ha  
Ah yeah, ah ha  
Ah yeah, ah ha  
  
No one else comes close to you  
  
Ah yeah, ah ha
