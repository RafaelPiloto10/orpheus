Out of all contexts and scenery  
(issue's) laughter rings inside of me  
Aching paths don't cross so easily  
Break my back to see things differently  
  
So glow  
We've held off the cold  
Low and behold  
The season's passing toll  
  
I find reasons and stop wondering  
The different ways in which we feel the same  
Give too much to what-if imagery  
Now the second time means more to me  
  
So glow  
We've held off the cold  
So glow  
We've held off the cold  
Low and behold  
Turns winter spring and fall.
