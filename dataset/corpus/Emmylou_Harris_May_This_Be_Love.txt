(Jimi Hendrix)  
Waterfall  
Nothing can go wrong  
Nothing can go wrong  
My sweet waterfall  
When I go  
When I go down deep  
I want you here with me  
My sweet waterfall  
I can see  
A rainbow calling me  
Through your mystery  
My sweet waterfall  
Waterfall  
For a million day  
Fall with me for a million days  
My sweet waterfall  
Waterfall  
Nothing can go wrong  
Nothing can go wrong  
My sweet waterfall  
Nothing can go wrong  
My sweet waterfall
