God bless America again  
You see all the troubles that she's in  
Wash her pretty face, dry her eyes  
And then God bless America again  
  
God, I sure do wish You'd bless America again  
You know like You did way back when it all began  
You blessed her then but we just sorta kinda take it for granted  
And never did ask again  
  
So God just hold her hand that's all  
And if she should stumble, please, don't let her fall  
  
God bless America again  
You see all the troubles that she's in  
Wash her pretty face, dry her eyes  
And then God bless America again  
  
You know, I don't understand to everythin' I'm readin' here  
About what's wrong with America  
And if You don't have a lotta good learnin'  
I guess there's a lotta things You don't understand  
  
But let me say this God, she's like a mother to me  
And though all I am or ever hope to be I owe to You and to her  
Wash her pretty face, dry her eyes  
And then God bless America again
