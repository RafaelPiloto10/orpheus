Well now friends just lend an ear  
For you're now about to hear, the ballad of Cat Ballou-ou  
It's a song that's newly made and Professor Sam the Shade  
And the Sunrise Kid are singin' it for you  
Cat Ballou... , Cat Ballou...  
  
It's a hangin' day in Wolf City, Wyomin'  
Wolf City, Wyomin', eighteen-ninety-four  
They're gonna drop Cat Ballou-ou  
Through the gallows floor  
  
She killed a man in Wolf City, Wyomin'  
Wolf City, Wyomin', killed a man it's true  
And that is why they're a-hangin', hangin' Cat Ballou  
  
She has the smile of an angel (Fights like the Devil)  
The eyes of an angel (Bites like the Devil)  
The face of an angel (I say she's the Devil)  
She's mean and evil through and through  
  
Cat Ballou, Cat Ballou-ou-ou  
She's mean and evil through and through  
  
With her outlaw band, they're now tellin' a story  
Now tellin' a story, how she rode the plain  
The wildest gal in the We-est, since Calamity Jane  
  
And today's the day, that she's goin' to glory  
She's goin' to glory, for the way she sinned  
They'll be a-speedin' her sou-oul, on the wayward wind  
  
She has the smile of an angel (Fights like the Devil)  
The eyes of an angel (Bites like the Devil)  
The face of an angel (I say she's the Devil)  
She's mean and evil through and through  
  
Cat Ballou (Cat Ballou)  
Cat Ballou-ou-ou (Cat Ballou-ou-ou)  
She's mean and evil through and through  
Cat Ballou, Cat Ball-ou-ou-ou  
She's mean and evil through and through
