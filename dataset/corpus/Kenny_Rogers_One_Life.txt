If there's a way of makin' time stand still for good  
I haven't found it yet  
If I could love you for eternity, I would  
But I regret  
  
I've only got one life, I've only got one life  
An' one lifetime's just not long enough to live  
I've only got one heart, I've only got one heart  
And I wish, I had a hundred more to give  
Girl, there's so little time and so much I want to do  
But I've only got one life to love someone like you  
  
Can't take my eyes off you, I'm afraid of what I'll miss  
It goes by so fast  
So I'll treat each moment that I've been blessed with you  
Like it's the last  
  
I've only got one life, I've only got one life  
An' one lifetime's just not long enough to live  
I've only got one heart, I've only got one heart  
And I wish, I had a hundred more to give  
Girl, there's so little time and so much I want to do  
But I've only got one life to love someone like you  
And I've only got one life and I give it all to you
