I got under the grip  
Between this modern hell  
I got the rejection letter in the mail and  
It was already ripped to shreds.  
Seasons in a ruin and  
This bitter pill is chased with blood.  
There's fire in my veins  
And it's pouring out like a flood  
  
Woah, Christian's inferno  
Woah, Christian's inferno  
Woah, Christian's inferno  
Woah, Christian's inferno  
  
This diabolic state is gracing my existence  
Like a catastrophic baby  
Maybe maybe you're the chemical reaction  
I am the atom bomb  
I am the chosen one  
Toxin your reservoir  
And then return man to ape  
  
Woah, Christian's inferno  
Woah, Christian's inferno  
Woah, Christian's inferno  
Woah, Christian's inferno
