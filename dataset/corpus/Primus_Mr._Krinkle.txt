Hello Mr. Krinkle  
How are you today?  
Seems the rumors are about your team might move away  
Now, me I'm sentimental  
But I'm not one to cry  
  
Say there Mr. Krinkle let's cruise the Bastard boat  
Damn then sonsabitches with their gill-nets set afloat  
I flip on my tele and I watch the waters die  
C'mon Mr. Krinkle tell me why  
  
Hey ho Mr. Krinkle have you heard the brand new sound  
It's a cross between Jimi Hendrix  
Bocephus, Cher and James Brown  
It's called "Heavy Hometown"  
New Wave, cold-filtered, low-calorie dry  
C'mon Mr. Krinkle tell me why
