Keep givin' me lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin'  
Time after time, I've pondered this love that I'm feeling  
I feel so divine  
It must be a crime  
Don't take it away  
  
[Bridge:]  
More than a few told me "I love you"  
Now I know better  
When it got down to you  
Somehow I knew  
My number was up for some sweet sweet lovin'  
  
[Chorus:]  
Keep givin' me lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin'  
I'm talkin' 'bout lovin', lovin', lovin', lovin'  
You've captured this girl, rockin' my world ya got me reelin'  
Ain't no future with another  
You're my one and only lover  
Come on and stay  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Is it any wonder I want you so  
Only you can satisfy my need  
Can't you see my hunger won't let you go  
Babe you belong to me, just to me
