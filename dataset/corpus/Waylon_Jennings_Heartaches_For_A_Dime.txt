I called you on the phone to say I love you that I stop by for you at nine  
My heart broke when you said that it's all over  
Someone else would take up all your time  
And that's a lot of heartaches for a dime  
I'll never know what made you change your mind  
I only know I've held you close and kissed you my last time  
That's a lot of heartaches for a dime  
  
I went downtown to join the marry makers I told myself that here's where I
belong  
I thought that I was doin' fine without you and then I heard somebody play our
song  
And that's a lot of heartaches for a dime...  
That's a lot of heartaches for a dime
