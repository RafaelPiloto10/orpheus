Ancient crown placed on your head  
The hangmen of Prague  
Seven keys to the chamber  
Surrendered to the God  
  
Hunting  
Fighting  
Killing whore  
Wade through blood  
And spill some more  
  
Hiding  
Fighting  
Killing whore  
Wade through blood  
And bleed some more  
  
Golden door submits secrets  
As this nation falls  
Atmosphere of deadly terror  
Subservient to all  
  
Hunting  
Fighting  
Killing whore  
Wade through blood  
And spill some more  
  
Hunting  
Fighting  
Killing whore  
Wade through blood  
And bleed some more  
  
Burning sense of mission  
Assassination  
Symbol of oppression  
  
Crusade led from exile  
Obliteration  
Sabotaged campaign  
  
Check resistance from afar  
Planning the death of one  
When the plot is executed  
There will be nowhere to run  
Ramifications will be high  
A price paid in torment  
The end justifies the means  
To hell you will be sent  
  
The wolf leader now is the stalked  
Expansion state of horror  
Guns echo over the grave  
A thousand fates are sealed  
Murderous power brought to an end  
Only to rise again  
Cold and restless and iron will  
Protectorate of the dead  
  
A thorough sweep  
Prelude to death  
Secrets kept  
But no one left  
Firing squad  
Begins their work  
Harsh reprisal  
For what you took  
Retribution selective terror  
The stench of death is everywhere  
A severed head  
A floating mass  
Will give me answers to what I ask
