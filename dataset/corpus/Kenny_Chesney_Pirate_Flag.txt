Well I come from a little bitty, homegrown small town,  
Smoky Mountains, nice place to hang around.  
Moonshine, that's where they make it,  
Put it in a jug, make you wanna get naked.  
But I jumped on a greyhound bus one night  
And took it all the way to the end of the line.  
Stepped down in the sun, with my feet hit the sand  
What a long strange trip  
  
I spent my whole life running around  
Still let the wind kinda blow me around  
Well I dropped a note in a bottle  
To a long-legged model  
And I traded it in for a whole 'nother world  
A pirate flag and an island girl  
  
Well my friends back home think I've gone and lost my mind  
Take a sip of rum and you really would know why  
Jolly Roger flying on the picnic table  
Blender in the kitchen, willin' and able  
Don't know what makes you say "What the hell"  
But when the salt air catches a hold of that sail  
Something 'bout her makes you just wanna dance  
And she loves to dance  
  
I spent my whole life running around  
Still let the wind kinda blow me around  
Well I dropped a note in a bottle  
To a long-legged model  
And I traded it in for a whole 'nother world  
A pirate flag and an island girl  
Pirate flag and an island girl  
  
I remember back home 'neath the big ol' moon  
Tucked back in the woods, yea life was good  
But here we are in a lofty barn drinkin' shootin' stars  
  
I might spend my whole life running around  
Still let the wind kinda blow me around  
Well I dropped a note in a bottle  
To a long-legged model  
And I traded it in for a whole 'nother world  
A pirate flag and an island girl  
A pirate flag and an island girl  
A pirate flag and an island girl  
A pirate flag and an island girl  
A pirate flag and an island girl
