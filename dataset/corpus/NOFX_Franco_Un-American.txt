I never thought abouit the universe, it made me feel small  
I never thought about the problems of this planet at all  
Global warming and radioactive sites  
The imperialistic wrongs and animal rights, NO!  
  
Why think all the bad things when life is so good  
Why help with an "am" when there's always a "could"  
Let the whales worry 'bout the poisons in the sea outside of California, it's
foreign policy  
No I don't want changes I've no reactions your dilemmas are my distractions  
  
That's no way to go Franco Un-American, that's no way to go Franco Un-American  
  
I never looked around never second guessed, then I read some Howard Zinn now
I'm always depressed  
And now I can't sleep from years of apathy, all because I read a little Noam
Chomsky  
I'm eating vegetation 'cause a Fast Food Nation, I wear uncomfortable shoes
'cause of globalization  
I'm watching Michael Moore expose the awful truth, I'm listening to Public
Enemy and Reagan Youth  
I see no world peace 'cause of zealous armed forces, I eat no breath mints
'cause they're from de-hoofed horses  
Now I can't believe what an absolute failure, the president's laughing 'cause
we voted for Nader  
  
That's no way to go Franco Un-American, where can we go Franco Un-American  
I want to move north and be a Canadian, or hang down low with the nice
Australians  
I don't want to be another I don't care-ican, what are we gonna do Franco
Franco
