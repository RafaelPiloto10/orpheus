Alas my love you do me wrong  
To cast me off discourteously  
For i have loved you so long  
Delighting in your company.  
  
Greensleeves was all my joy,  
Greensleeves was my delight.  
Greensleeves was my heart of gold  
And who but my lady Greensleeves ?  
  
Alas my love that you should own  
A heart of wanton vanity  
So i must laddie think alone  
Upon your insincerity.  
  
Greensleeves
