Shame on the rain for making me twice as blue  
It's raining in my heart on my window too  
Days just like this have put out the flame  
I've got that smoke in my eyes shame on the rain  
You'd think it's enough just to know that she's gone  
With my kind of luck it will rain from now on  
After I'd lost such a heartbreaking game  
You'd think the sun would shine shame on the rain  
[ guitar ]  
Shame on the rain for adding to my unrest she took the sun it figures I guess  
I have my share of sorrow and pain look what a day it is shame on the rain  
Look what a day it is shame on the rain
