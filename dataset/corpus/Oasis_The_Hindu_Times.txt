I get up when I'm down  
I can't swim but my soul won't drown  
I do believe I got flare  
I got speed and I walk on air  
  
'Cause God gimme soul in your rock'n'roll, babe  
'Cause God gimme soul in your rock'n'roll, babe  
And I get so high I just can't feel it  
And I get so high I just can't feel it  
  
In and out my brain  
You're runnin' through my vein  
You're my sunshine  
You're my rain  
  
There's a light that shines on  
Shines on me and it keeps me warm  
It gimme peace I must say  
I can't sleep 'cause the world won't wait  
  
'Cause God gimme soul in your rock'n'roll, babe  
'Cause God gimme soul in your rock'n'roll, babe  
And I get so high I just can't feel it  
And I get so high I just can't feel it  
  
In and out my brain  
You're runnin' through my vein  
You're my sunshine  
You're my rain  
  
And I get so high I just can't feel it  
And I get so high I just can't feel it  
And I get so high I just can't feel it  
And I get so high I just can't feel it  
  
In and out my brain  
You're runnin' through my vein  
You're my sunshine  
You're my rain
