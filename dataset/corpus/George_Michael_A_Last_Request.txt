It's late, time for bed  
So we sit, and I wait  
For that gin and tonic  
To go to your head  
I know it's a devious plan  
But it's the only way that I know  
To get those big bad car keys  
Out of your hand  
You know that I remain a gentle man  
But even so there's only so much a gentleman can stand  
Sleep with me  
Oh, sleep with me tonight  
My cards are on your table  
My dreams are in your bed  
If I was able, I'd be there instead  
Oh oh, sleep with me tonight
