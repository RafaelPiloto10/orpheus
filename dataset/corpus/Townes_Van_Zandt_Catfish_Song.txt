Down at the bottom of that dirty ol' river  
Down where the reeds and the catfish play  
There lies a dream as soft as the water  
There lies a bluebird that's flown away  
  
Well, to meet is like springtime  
And to love's like the summer  
Her brown eyes shone for nobody but me  
Then autumn forever, the fool come a fallin'  
And the rain turned to freezin' inside of me.  
  
I'll kindle my fires with the words  
I can't send you  
And the roads I can't follow  
And the songs I can't sing  
  
Well, all you young ladies  
Who dream of tomorrow  
While you're a listenin'  
These words will I say  
Cling to today with its joy  
And its sorrow  
You'll need all your memories  
When youth melts away.  
  
Well, the angel of springtime  
He rides down the southwind  
The angel of summer  
He does just the same  
The angel of autumn  
She's blue and she's golden  
And the angel of winter  
Won't remember your name  
  
Down at the bottom of that dirty ol' river  
Down where the reeds and the catfish play  
There lies a dream as soft as the water  
There lies a bluebird that's flown away  
  
There lies a bluebird  
That's flown away
