What if I told you I love you  
What if I called you in rhythm  
In this world there's nothing left  
Well nothing that's new  
  
What if I told you without  
Loving is simply a lie  
Although she moves into the night  
Oh, tell me you're mine  
Please say it's true  
  
Oh, shame it's over  
I was the light and the days of them all  
Well push me over  
I'm flat on my back but I'm having a ball  
And just look whose laughing  
  
What if I flew like a dove dear  
What if I would you in rhythm  
There's nothing left  
Nothing that's good left for me now  
  
Oh,I'll just go and sleep with strangers  
I'll live like a lord in a tower  
'cause in the city there's too mich air  
That I can't dream at night  
Well not anymore  
  
Oh, shame it's over  
It been such fun and we had a ball  
Well push me over  
But I'll be the last people to fall  
Well just look whose laughing  
  
Oh shame it's over  
How like a cow bloated on grass  
Well, push me over  
Me on my back and you on your arse  
Such a shame it's all over  
There are so feel days left to grasp  
So push me over  
We on our back and you on your lazy arse  
Well just look whose laughing
