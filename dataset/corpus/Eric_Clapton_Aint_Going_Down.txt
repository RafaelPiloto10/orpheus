It ain't no big deal, we're all lucky to be alive,  
I myself don't believe in luck, or taking chances, I will survive.  
Every move I make, every twist every turn,  
You scandalize and humble me, I may be slow but I will learn.  
  
'Cause I ain't going down anymore.  
'Cause I ain't going down anymore.  
'Cause I ain't going down anymore.  
'Cause I ain't going down anymore.  
  
If I had my way, I would probably just sit and stare.  
Watch the T.V. or read a book, I'd have no reason to be aware,  
But I ain't got time, I just could not live that way.  
I've got to step outside myself, I've still got something left to say.  
  
'Cause I ain't going down anymore.  
'Cause I ain't going down anymore.  
'Cause I ain't going down anymore.  
'Cause I ain't going down anymore.  
  
'Cause I ain't going down anymore.  
'Cause I ain't going down anymore.  
'Cause I ain't going down anymore.  
'Cause I ain't going down anymore.  
  
Channeled in my groove, part of another space and time.  
Please allow me to introduce another good friend of mine.  
Some call him fear, some call him righteousness.  
I myself ain't clear, and you can't force me to make a guess.
