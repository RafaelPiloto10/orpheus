Strangeways  
Strange, strange  
  
I was born into confusion  
My mother said to me  
'When you become a man you'll understand'  
But it's still a mystery  
'And if you want to get ahead  
Get some decent clothes  
The only way to make it  
Dress the part'  
That gets right up my nose  
  
And I think to myself in this river of doubt  
This is something I can do without  
But strangeways is what I got  
  
The indians are coming Isaw it on tv  
They're 20,000 strong  
But they always get depleted by the cavalry  
Salvation is at hand  
It's guaranteed  
Just send a donation straight to God  
1-800 toll free  
  
And I think to myself in this academy of fear  
Where am I going what am I doing here  
But strangeways is all I got  
  
Have you seen the headlines  
Princess engaged  
3 million out of work  
But that's on the 2nd page  
The alien has landed  
Finger in his ear  
Can't hear a word I am saying  
But that ain't such a bad idea  
  
And I think to myself in this cradle of lust  
Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust  
But strangeways is all you get
