I had a dream last night, Lord it wasn't me  
I dreamed the only woman I ever loved  
People, turned her back on me  
Let me tell you little more about the dream  
I dream of working a graveyard shift  
For the long nights a week  
When I left home my baby's in bed  
My baby, she was fast asleep  
When I'm done sick of my job  
And I had to go home  
And when I got there my bed was empty  
My baby she was gone  
It couldn't let this worry  
It all happened in my sleep  
All the things that has been so bad  
And I don't want you from seven to seven next weekend  
And that's why, that's why, that's why I had a dream  
Lord, that's worrying me  
She's the only woman I ever loved, people  
She's turned her back on me  
Baby, don't you know I had a dream last night  
Don't you know that worries me  
You know I had a dream last night  
I had a dream, you were worrying me  
Just pick the way I was going people, yeah
