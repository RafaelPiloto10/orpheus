You bring the sun out to make my love grow  
To warm my life up  
  
[Chorus]  
(You bring the sun out)  
You're the reason that I'm living, I was hurting but I'm happy again  
(You bring the sun out)  
I was hurting but I'm happy again  
(You bring the sun out)  
Lord I wanna thank You 'cause  
(You bring the sun out, to make my love grow, you bring the sun out)  
You were there when I had nothing  
You've been with me from beginning to end  
(You bring the sun out)  
No clouds in the sky, that's the reason why  
(I Love You)  
  
Question number one (What can I do)  
Question number two (What can I say)  
To try to let You know (I appreciate, all of the ways You get me through my
day)  
Never would have thought (I would be here)  
A heart with no scars (a face with no tears)  
How can I thank You (how can I show You)  
(Wish I could get the whole world to know You)  
  
If they only knew (You are the one that gives me the air to breathe)  
And see I can't deny that (You're the reason why my life has a melody)  
And even when I stray (I still feel your grace pulling me close to You)  
So no matter where You are, just know I'm not far (without You what would I
do)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Question number three (where would I be)  
And Lord not only that but (how could You see)  
My days and my nights, the pains of my life  
But now it's alright ('cause You worked it out for me)  
You gave me a chance (when I had no chance)  
When I needed help (You gave me your hand)  
So now they need to see (just what You mean to me and if You ever left me
(where would I be)  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I feel the sunlight on my life reminding me that it is alright  
And I see the rainbow and I know my storm is finally passed away  
There is a soft wind that begins to blow back the clouds  
So I can see your perfect plan now I can hurry to my destiny
