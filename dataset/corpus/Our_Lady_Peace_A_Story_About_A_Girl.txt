(Story about a girl)  
(Story about the world)  
  
Suddenly I'm something I'm not  
I'm something that you bought  
Was it something I said  
My friend  
Little girl are you tripping on this  
Are you tripping all over it  
You better come up for air  
  
A Story about a girl  
A Story about the world  
  
Are you waking up slowly  
Nothing but lonely  
Are you waking up  
Holding, holding your breath  
Are you looking for something  
I promise you one thing  
I promise I'll always, always  
Be there  
  
Baby girl, stand up and fight  
This is not some paradise  
It's just where we live  
Finally you think you're alright  
Then it eats you up alive  
You better get used to it  
  
A story about a girl  
A story about the world  
  
Are you waking up slowly  
Nothing but lonely  
Are you waking up  
Holding, holding your breath  
Are you looking for something  
I promise you one thing  
I promise I'll always, always  
Be there  
  
With all my faith  
And all my heart  
And all those simple things you are  
  
I know  
It's stuck inside your head  
You're alone  
You better get used to it  
And I know  
The feeling has to end  
You're strong  
It sucks you in again  
And you're lost  
You can't make any sense  
This world  
It tears you limb from limb  
And hold on  
You're nothing but the best  
  
Are you waking up slowly  
Nothing but lonely  
Are you waking up  
Holding, holding your breath  
Are you looking for something  
I promise you one thing  
I promise I'll always, always  
Be there  
  
With all my faith  
And all my heart  
And all those simple things you are  
  
With all my faith  
And all my heart  
And all those simple things you are
