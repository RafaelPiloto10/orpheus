You go where the wind blows, leading the life you chose  
Your destination remains unknown  
No one to help you, nobody cares about you  
You're looking for someplace you can call home  
  
Lonely children on the run  
Lonely children need someone  
  
Too many questions, you need to answer to them  
Your information is so incomplete  
You seek directions, you would be lost without them  
Don't let them find you lying in the street  
  
Lonely children on the run  
Lonely children, lonely, need someone  
  
Someone to talk to  
Someone who cares  
Someone who listens  
Is anyone there?  
  
They may detest you, someday they may arrest you  
They stop at nothing to hold you down  
You need to be free, but will they ever let you?  
They won't be happy till you leave town  
  
Lonely children on the run, run on the run  
Lonely children need someone, need someone  
Lonely children in the night, can't see the light  
Lonely children need a guiding light, don't forget  
Lonely children all alone  
Lonely children have no home  
Lonely children on the run  
Hope someday there'll be someone  
Lonely, lonely children
