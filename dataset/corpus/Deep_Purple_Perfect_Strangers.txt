Can you remember remember my name  
As I flow through your life  
A thousand oceans I have flown  
And cold spirits of ice  
All my life  
I am the echo of your past  
  
I am returning the echo of a point in time  
Distant faces shine  
A thousand warriors I have known  
And laughing as the spirits appear  
All your life  
Shadows of another day  
  
And if you hear me talking on the wind  
You've got to understand  
We must remain  
Perfect strangers  
  
I know I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow  
  
A strand of silver hanging through the sky  
Touching more than you see  
The voice of ages in your mind  
Is aching with the dead of the night  
Precious life (your tears are lost in  
Falling rain)  
  
And if you hear me talking on the wind  
You've got to understand  
We must remain  
Perfect strangers
