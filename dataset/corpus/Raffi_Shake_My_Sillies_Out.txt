I've gotta shake, shake, shake my sillies out,  
Shake, shake, shake my sillies out,  
Shake, shake, shake my sillies out,  
And wiggle my waggles away!  
  
I've gotta clap, clap, clap my crazies out,  
Clap, clap, clap my crazies out,  
Clap, clap, clap my crazies out,  
And wiggle my waggles away!  
  
I've gotta jump, jump, jump my jiggles out,  
Jump, jump, jump my jiggles out,  
Jump, jump, jump my jiggles out,  
And wiggle my waggles away!  
  
I've gotta yawn, yawn, yawn my sleepies out,  
Yawn, yawn, yawn my sleepies out,  
Yawn, yawn, yawn my sleepies out,  
And wiggle my waggles away!  
  
I've gotta shake, shake, shake my sillies out,  
Shake, shake, shake my sillies out,  
Shake, shake, shake my sillies out,  
And wiggle my waggles away,  
And wiggle my waggles away!
