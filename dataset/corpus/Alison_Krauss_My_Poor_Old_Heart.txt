Don't expect too much from my poor old heart,  
You can blame me unforgiven for my scars,  
You might just be the best that I can find,  
But I can't seem to forget the tears I've cried,  
I don't know that I will ever trust again,  
It's a price I must pay for all my sins,  
Time has changed me and left me full of doubt,  
And my heart may be lost never to be found,  
  
Once upon a time I did believe,  
In my true love that swept me off my feet,  
Then the wind of change swept him away,  
And left me drowning in my own pain  
I don't know that I will ever love again,  
It's a price that I must pay for all my sins,  
Time has changed me and left me full of doubt,  
And my heart may be lost never to be found,  
I don't know that I will ever love again,  
It's the price that I must pay for all my sins,  
  
Time has changed me and left me full of doubt,  
I don't know that I will ever trust again,  
It's the price I must pay for all my sins,  
Time has changed me and left me full of doubt,  
And my heart may be lost never to be found.  
  
I don't know that I will ever trust again,
