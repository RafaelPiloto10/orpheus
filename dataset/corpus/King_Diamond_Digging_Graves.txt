Lucy, you stay here...the tomb is warm  
Why don't you play with the dools...  
The dolls on the wall  
  
I am not the guy I used to be,  
Not since he put me away  
I left half my brain behind, back in that crazy place  
Does that mean...that I am insane  
Does that really mean...that I am to blame...NO NO NO  
  
Is it true what they say...little girls don't cry  
Is it true what they say...Lucy look at me  
  
I am not the guy I used to be,  
Not since he put me away  
I left half my brain behind, back in that crazy place  
Does that mean...that I am insane  
Does that really mean...that I am to blame...NO NO NO  
  
Into the night I go, and you can't follow me  
Into the night I go, and you can't follow me  
  
I will be your misery, I'm gonna be your HELL  
I will be your misery, and I wish you well, in HELL  
  
I'm digging graves, seven deadly tombs  
I'm digging graves, below that crazy moon  
  
I will be your misery, I'm gonna be your HELL  
I will be your misery, and I wish you well, in HELL  
  
McKenzie, how could you think I'd forget  
  
[SOLO: Andy - SOLO: Herb]  
  
All graves done...I'm so clever  
Seven headstones in all...saying "Lucy Forever"  
  
I am not the guy I used to be,  
Not since he put me away  
I left half my brain behind, back in that crazy place  
Does that mean...that I am insane  
Does that really mean...that I am to blame...NO NO NO  
  
Into the night I go, and you can't follow me  
Into the night I go, and you can't follow me  
  
I will be your misery, I'm gonna be your HELL  
I will be your misery, and I wish you well, in HELL  
  
I'm digging graves, seven deadly tombs  
I'm digging graves, below that crazy moon  
  
[SOLO: Herb]  
  
Into the night I go, and you can't follow me...
