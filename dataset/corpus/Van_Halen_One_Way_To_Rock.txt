I've heard it called by different names  
All over the world but it's all the same  
There are so many ways to make love  
A million ways I've been thinking of, oh yeah  
But there's only one way  
There's only one way to rock  
So many things can get you high  
I'm gonna try 'em all just once before I die  
And you can analyze this situation  
To me it's all just mental masturbation  
But there's only one way  
There's only one way to rock  
There's only one way  
There's only one way to rock, yeah  
Check the hands on the clock it's 8:05, it's time to rock, F O  
And this world can disagree  
They don't understand how it can be  
And it's not my point of view, it's a fact  
We all know that it's true, oh yeah  
There's only one way  
There's only one way to rock  
There's only one way  
There's only one way to rock  
Crank up the drums, and the bass  
Crank up my Les Paul in your face  
F O
