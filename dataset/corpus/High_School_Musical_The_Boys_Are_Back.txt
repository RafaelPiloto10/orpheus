Take it back to the place where you know it all began  
We could be anything we wanna be  
You can tell by the noise that the boys are back again  
Together making history  
  
It's time to show how to be a superhero  
Just like a showdown, Will Smith and Bobby DeNiro  
We're the best, no doubt, doing it like we used to do  
This is our time and I'm telling you all!  
  
The boys are back, the boys are back  
The boys are back, gonna do it again  
Gonna wake up the neighborhood  
  
The boys are back, the boys are back  
Climbing up the walls anytime we want  
The word is out, the boys are back  
  
The boys are back, back to save the day  
The boys are back, oh yeah  
  
Keep coming with the right, win the fight every single time  
Undefeated here in our house, yeah  
We can rock, we can shock, anytime we like  
And tonight we're going all out  
  
It's time to show how to be a superhero  
Just like a showdown, keep the pedal to the metal  
We're the best, no doubt, doing it like we used to do  
This is our time and I'm telling you all!  
Lookout!  
  
The boys are back, the boys are back  
The boys are back, gonna do it again  
Gonna wake up the neighborhood

Climbing up the walls anytime we want

To solve the mystery, fight the battle, save the girl  
No one can stop us now  
We're the ones that make the rules, oh!
