You and I sailed away to a place  
We once called paradise  
We were young and deep in our love  
And we never needed lies  
So here we stand face to face  
Knowing we've drifted apart  
As for myself, there'll be nobody else  
Who'll ever touch this place in my heart  
You just call my name  
And I'll come runnin' for you in the night  
Just call my name  
And I'll come runnin' right back into your life  
If you ever need my love, call my name  
Will ya call the love we shared  
Just a moment passing in time  
It was a moment I can never forget  
And a love that was so hard to find  
There are no chains to hold you down  
I told you a long time ago  
If the time has come for movin' on  
There's one thing I need you to know  
You just call my name  
And I'll come runnin' for you in the night  
Just call my name  
And I'll come runnin' right back into your life  
If you ever need my love, call my name  
If you feel you need my love  
And it's time we start over again  
You just call my name  
And I'll come runnin' for you in the night  
Just call my name  
And I'll come runnin' right back into your life  
If you ever need my love, call my name
