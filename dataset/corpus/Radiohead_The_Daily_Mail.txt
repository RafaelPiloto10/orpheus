The moon is high up on a mountain  
The lunatics have taken over the asylum  
Waiting on the rapture  
  
Singing, "We're here to keep your prices down  
We'll feed you to the hounds  
To the daily mail, to get up, together"  
  
You made a pig's ear, you made a mistake  
Paid off security and got through the gate  
You got away with it but we lie in wait, eh  
Eh, eh  
  
Where's the truth what's the use  
I'm hanging around lost and found  
And when you're here innocent  
Fat chance, no plan  
No regard for human life  
  
You'll keep time, you've no right  
You're fast to lose, you will lose  
You jumped the queue, you're back again  
  
President for life, love of all  
The flies in the sky, the beasts of the earth  
The fish in the sea have lost command
