I've seen enough of life,  
Enough to last a lifetime.  
I've seen too many tears,  
Far too many tears.  
I don't know the answer,  
I don't know the question.  
So show me something good,  
Something to believe in.  
CHORUS:  
Love like a ghost, in the dark.  
Love like a ghost, in my heart.  
So let's talk of love,  
Maybe for the last time.  
You will remember me,  
I'm the one who died for you.  
So she'll take everything,  
Everything and nothing.  
I can't do anything,  
Anything at all.  
(repeat chorus to fade)
