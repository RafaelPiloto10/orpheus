You were my woman and I was your man  
You were good lookin'  
You know I was your biggest fan  
You tried to teach me things I already knew  
When you couldn't reach me  
Girl, I think you knew that we were through  
Baby, it's over  
  
Save your love, save it, save it  
Save your love, save it, save it  
Save your love, I don't want it (save your love)  
Save it for someone else (save it, save it)  
Save your love, I don't need it (save your love)  
Put it back on the shelf  
For somebody else  
  
You said you love me, you may have been right  
But hangin' above me, girl,  
You know that we would fight  
  
You tried to change me and mess up my mind  
Now, don't rearrange me  
And girl, you know that's why you're left behind  
It's over now  
  
Save your love, save it, save it  
Save your love, save it, save it  
Save your love, I don't want it (save your love)  
Save it for someone else (save it, save it)  
Save your love, I don't need it (save your love)  
Put it back on the shelf  
For somebody else  
  
Girl, you know it's over  
We had some good times  
But now they're gone, so long  
  
Save your love, save it, save it  
Save your love, save it, save it  
Save your love, I don't want it (save your love)  
Save it for someone else (save it, save it)  
Save your love, I don't need it (save your love)  
Put it back on the shelf  
For somebody else  
  
Save your love, I don't want it (save your love)  
Save it for someone else (save it, save it)  
Save your love, I don't need it (save your love)  
Girl, I don't want it, save your love  
  
Save your love, I don't want it (save your love)  
Save it for someone else (save it, save it)  
Save your love, I don't need it (save your love)  
Girl, I don't want it, save your love  
  
Save your love, I don't want it (save your love)  
Save it for someone else (save it, save it)  
Save your love, I don't need it (save your love)  
Girl, I don't want it, save your love
