Saying goodbye  
  
I watched every sun up  
Comin' over my tin cup  
Seen every moon changin'  
While I slept with the sky  
Felt the chill in the north wind  
Find holes that I can't mend  
This West Texas cowboy is wrestless again.  
  
Campfire light dancin'  
On the smiles of some good friends  
Wearin' the hard times  
In the lines on their faces  
Now the seasons are changin'  
And it's time I was leavin'  
'Cause this West Texas cowboy is wrestless again.  
  
So I'm sayin' goodbye-ye, ridin' away  
Sayin' goodbye-ye again  
I'm wishin' you well, miss you until  
I come back again next year.  
  
Let's sing of the good days  
And drink to the ladies  
Till the whisky's all gone  
And their pleasure is mine  
Come sit here beside me  
Sweet lullaby me  
This West Texas cowboy is wrestless again....
