I took a drive today  
Time to emancipate  
I guess it was the beatings made me wise  
But I'm not about to give thanks, or apologize  
I couldn't breathe, holdin' me down  
Hand on my face, pushed to the ground  
Enmity gaged, united by fear  
Forced to endure what I could not forgive  
  
I seem to look away  
Wounds in the mirror waved  
It wasn't my surface most defiled  
Head at your feet, fool to your crown  
Fist on my plate, swallowed it down  
Enmity gaged, united by fear  
Tried to endure what I could not forgive  
  
Saw things [Repeat x4]  
Clearer [Repeat x2]  
Once you, were in my rearviewmirror  
  
I gather speed from you fucking with me  
Once and for all I'm far away  
I hardly believe, finally the shades, are raised, hey  
  
Saw things so much clearer  
Once you, once you [Repeat x3]  
Rearviewmirror  
  
Saw things so much clearer  
Once you, oh yeah
