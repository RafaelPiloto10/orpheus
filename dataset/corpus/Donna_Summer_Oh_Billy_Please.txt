You said you loved me  
Then why won't you let me  
Be who i am all of the time  
  
Said you wouldn't hurt me  
Then why would you leave me  
And take my peace of mind  
Ah, ah  
  
Oh, billy please take my call  
Ah, ah  
Billy i've tried most of all  
Ah, ah  
  
We've got to stop having  
This misunderstanding  
There'll never be another guy  
  
I'm sending this letter  
Hope you're feeling better  
Can't stop this raining from my eyes  
Ah, ah,  
  
Oh, billy please take my call  
Ah, ah,

Ah, ah  
  
Don't be a fool for some lies  
Ah, ah,  
Billy i've tried over time  
Ah, ah,  
  
If you love me  
If you love me  
  
Some people say i'm a fool for loving you  
There's no perfect guarantee  
And i know you will agree
