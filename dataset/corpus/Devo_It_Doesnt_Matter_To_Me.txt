Listen comrade, I don't care  
How long you want to grow your hair  
  
It Doesn't Matter to Me  
It Doesn't Matter to Me  
Tell ya lady have you heard the news  
You can burn your wig and burn your shoes  
  
It Doesn't Matter to Me  
It Doesn't Matter to Me  
'Cause there's something bigger than meets the eye  
Something important and it's waiting for you  
  
Oh, Yeah!  
Woah, Yeah!  
Knock it off, pal  
I heard this story before  
  
Tell me something new  
That's what I came here for  
  
It Doesn't Matter to Me  
It Doesn't Matter to Me  
'Cause there's a train pulling into the station  
  
And it's headed for a new destination  
And I tell you my friend  
You better count me in  
Listen comrade, I don't care  
  
If you ever change your underwear  
It Doesn't Matter to Me  
It Doesn't Matter to Me  
Oh, No  
  
It Doesn't Matter to Me  
It Doesn't Matter to Me  
Uh-Huh  
  
Well, Ahhh
