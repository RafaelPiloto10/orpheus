Do you recall  
That lonely summer day?  
We were together and things got in our way.  
Well, so you think that it's all over,  
And you know it's gone to stay.  
Oh, after stormy weather, does the sunshine every day?  
  
Yes, I recall, the things you said that day  
You told me that you were leavin'  
Cause we can't go on this way  
You think that it's all over, and you know it's gone to stay.  
Oh, after stormy weather, does the sunshine every day?  
  
Yes, it's the lovin' things  
That keeps us wandering.  
Yes, it's the lovin' things,  
Ooo, baby, love.  
  
Yes, it's the lovin' things  
That keeps us wandering.  
Yes, it's the lovin' things,  
  
Ooo, girl,  
Say you'll stay.  
You'll stay.  
You think that it's all over, and you know it's gone to stay.  
Oh, after stormy weather, does the sunshine every day?
