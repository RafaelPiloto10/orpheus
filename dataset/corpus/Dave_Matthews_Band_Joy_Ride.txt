Like a dog with the television on  
Staring blankly at the screen the way you do  
I'll keep you there and your money too  
If you all line up inside of here  
Do what I tell ya and everything will be okay  
And if youre lost, I got a bobblehead Jesus  
Get on your knees, that Jesus will please ya'  
Money is clean if we scrub it good with  
Guns and gasoline, I'm gonna save the world  
Nothing's obscene if we only close our eyes  
Boys and girls welcome to this joy ride  
Come on all of you wont left alive  
Get in line and everything will be fine  
We gotta toss our troubles to the wind  
We need 'em like we did in the end  
Money is clean if we scrub it good with  
Guns and gasoline, I'm gonna save the world  
Nothing's obscene if we only close our eyes  
Boys and girls welcome to this joy ride  
Joyride, joyride, joyride  
[scatting]  
Taking everything into account the way you should  
Light it up, light it up cuz it be so good  
Woah, Yeah, Oh, all of us praying now  
Now, Yeah, Yeah, all of us praying now  
What you got [scatting].. Always fade away  
Money is clean if we scrub it good with  
Guns and gasoline, I'm gonna save the world  
Nothing's obscene if we only close our eyes  
Boys and girls welcome to this joyride  
Joyride, joyride, joyride
