"I take a bottle of wine and I go drink it among the flowers.  
We are allways three ... counting my shadow and my friend the shimmering moon  
Happily the moon knows nothing of drinking, and my shadow is never thirsty  
When I sing, the moon listens to me in silence. When I dance, my shadow dances
too.  
After all festivities the guests must depart. This sadness I do not know.  
When I go home, the moon goes with me and my shadow follows me"
