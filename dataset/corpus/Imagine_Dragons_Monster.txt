[Verse 1]  
Ever since I could remember  
Everything inside of me  
Just wanted to fit in (Oh oh oh oh)  
I was never one for pretenders  
Everything I tried to be  
Just wouldn't settle in (Oh oh oh oh)  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
If I told you what I was  
Would you turn your back on me?  
And if I seem dangerous  
Would you be scared?  
I get the feeling just because  
Everything I touch isn't dark enough  
If this problem lies in me  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm only a man with a candle to guide me  
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me  
A monster, a monster  
I've turned into a monster  
A monster, a monster  
And it keeps getting stronger  
  
[Verse 2]  
Can I clear my conscience,  
If I'm different from the rest  
Do I have to run and hide? (Oh oh oh oh)  
I never said that I want this  
This burden came to me  
And it's made it's home inside (Oh oh oh oh)  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
If I told you what I was  
Would you turn your back on me?  
And if I seem dangerous  
Would you be scared?  
I get the feeling just because  
Everything I touch isn't dark enough  
If this problem lies in me  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm only a man with a candle to guide me  
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me  
A monster, a monster  
I've turned into a monster  
A monster, a monster  
And it keeps getting stronger  
  
[Intermission]  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm only a man with a candle to guide me  
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me  
A monster, a monster  
I've turned into a monster  
A monster, a monster  
And it keeps getting stronger
