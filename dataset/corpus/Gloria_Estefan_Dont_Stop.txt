The clock is ticking, and I'm here wishing  
This new found love will find no end  
Don't wanna feel, another feeling  
Don't wanna know what time will send  
I wanna stop, the earth from turning,  
The rain from falling,  
The wind from blowing  
But don't stop (stop), the love from growing, keep that river flowing  
We can find a way  
Don't stop (stop), the love from showing  
I don't want tomorrow, just give me today  
Don't stop (stop), stop the hands of time  
Hold back the time  
And make forever, the same as the moment I felt your love  
You've touched my heart  
Erase the pain, the memories, and mistakes I made  
Stop, the earth from turning, the rain from falling, the wind from blowing  
But don't stop (stop), the love from growing, keep that river flowing  
We can find a way  
Don't stop (stop), the love from showing  
I don't want tomorrow, just give me today  
Don't stop (stop), the flame from burning  
Stop tomorrow's hurting, from seeing the light  
Don't stop (stop), my heart from beating  
Keep the time from fleeting, into the night  
Can't think about tomorrow's fears, 'cause today is here to stay  
Clear away all of yesterday's tears, there's nothing to block our way  
Stop, the earth from turning, the rain from falling, the wind from blowing,
the sun from shining  
Can't find the reason, another season  
Could never match a love so pleasin'  
Don't let it go, no, no, no, no, no  
Don't stop (stop), the love from growing, keep that river flowing  
We can find a way  
Don't stop (stop), the love from showing  
I don't want tomorrow, just give me today  
Don't stop (stop), the flame from burning  
Stop tomorrow's hurting, from seeing the light  
Don't stop (stop)  
My heart from beating, keep the time from fleeting, into the night  
Don't stop (stop), the love from growing, keep that river flowing  
We can find a way  
Don't stop (stop), the love from showing  
I don't want tomorrow, just give me today  
Don't stop the love, stop the time, another day, to keep you mine  
Don't stop the love, stop the time, another, to keep you mine
