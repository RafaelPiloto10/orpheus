I pump poison  
Into my body  
To forget  
That I am me  
  
feels good  
Wonderful  
I forget I have feelings at all  
You're dizzy  
  
I floated up  
Fifteen miles high  
Stuck my head through  
All the holes in our sky  
  
I looked out across the universe  
And thought of you  
You're dizzy  
And I am dizzy too  
  
I became lunatic  
With rolling eyes  
Squirming on the ground  
Frozen in ice  
  
Called to my mother  
Said "Mother, please  
Feed me before the sky  
Falls in on me"  
  
You're dizzy
