I got money  
Everything that I ever wanted  
Never thought of what I might need, need, need  
Ain't it funny, how I spend my whole life running  
Reaching for the sky high and coming down with nothing  
  
Feels like I'm four years old all over again  
Because I'm just running fast and should be walking  
Saying when I grow up you gon' see  
I'm gon' be comfortable and happy  
  
I guess I was faking cause look at all the money I'm making  
Still nothing can compare to the thought of love  
But it's taking too much time to see that I'm wasting  
Reaching for the sky high and coming down with nothing  
  
It feels like I'm four years old all over again  
'Cause I just keep running fast and should be walking  
Saying when I grow up you gon' see  
I'm gon' be comfortable and happy  
  
I'm so alone, I feel so alone, so alone in this world  
Got everything I want  
  
It feels like I'm four years old all over again  
'Cause I just keep running fast and should be walking  
Saying when I grow up you gon' see  
I'm gon' be comfortable and happy  
  
Whoah
