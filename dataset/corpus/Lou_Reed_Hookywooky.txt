I'm standing with you on your roof  
Looking at the chemical sky  
All purple blue and oranges  
Some pigeons flying by  
The traffic on canal street's so noisy  
It's a shock  
And someone's shooting fireworks or a gun  
On the next block  
An-an-and, I wanna hookywooky with you  
I wanna hookywooky with you  
The traffic's so noisy it's a shock  
Sounds like fireworks or a gun on the next block  
Ah, hookywooky with you  
Your ex-lover satchel is here from france  
Yet another ex  
They gather about you like a mother superior  
All of you still friends, but -  
None of my old flames ever talk to me when things  
End for me they end  
They take your pants, your money, your name  
But the song still remains  
An-an-and, I wanna hookywooky with you  
Ah-ha-ha-ha, I wanna hookywooky with you  
Then they take your pants, your money, your name  
But the song still remains, sayin' -  
I wanna hookywooky with you  
You're so civilized it hurts  
I guess I could learn a lot, ha-ha...  
About people, plants and relationships  
How not to get hurt a lot  
And each lover I meet up your roof  
I wouldn't want to throw him off, mmmmm..  
Into the chemical sky, down into the streets to die  
Under the wheels of a car on canal street  
And each lover I meet up on your roof  
I wouldn't want to throw him off, mmmmm..  
Into the chemical sky  
Under the wheels of a car to die on canal street  
Ah-ah-hi, I wanna, ah, hookywooky with you  
Ah-huh, huh-huh-huh-ah  
I wanna hookywooky with you  
I wouldn't want to throw him off into the chemical sky  
Down into the streets to die  
Under the wheels of a car on canal street  
Under the wheels of a car on canal street  
Under the wheels of a car on canal street  
Hookywooky  
Under the wheels of a car on canal street  
Hookywooky  
Under the wheels of a car on canal street  
Under the wheels of a car on canal street  
Hooky-hooky-hooky-wooky  
(under the wheels of a car on canal street)  
(under the wheels of a car on canal street)  
(under the wheels of a car on canal street)  
(under the wheels of a car on canal street)
