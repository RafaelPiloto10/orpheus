Amazing grace  
How sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost  
But now I'm found  
Was blind  
But now i see  
  
The earth shall soon  
Dissolve like snow  
The sun forget to shine  
But god who brought me here below  
Will be forever mine  
  
Through him many dangers, toils and snares  
I have already come  
'Twas grace that brought me here thus far  
And grace will lead me home
