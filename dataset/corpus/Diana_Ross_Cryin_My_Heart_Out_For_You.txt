How do you live with a broken heart?  
Everytime you come too close  
I just run away  
I need you so much  
And that's so hard to say  
There is me and there is you  
And I get confused  
And sooner or later  
I know that I'll have to choose  
  
You know it's true  
I'm crying my heart out for you  
What can I do  
I'm losing myself over you  
Over and over again  
I'm crying my heart out for you  
No one in love likes to lose  
How do you live with a broken heart  
  
And I can honestly say  
I want to be on my own  
That too bare existence  
When I was all alone  
I know you're not asking me  
To just live for you  
But it's always how I've loved  
And all I know how to do  
  
You know it's true  
I'm crying my heart out for you  
What can I do  
I'm losing myself over you  
Over and over again  
I'm crying my heart out for you  
No-one in love likes to lose  
  
But how do you live with a broken heart?  
Once again I'm falling in love  
Like a fool I'm falling in love  
And I don't know what I'm doing  
  
Once again it's somebody else  
That I need, I'm losing myself  
And I'm scared of what I'm feeling  
  
It's true  
I'm crying my heart out for you  
What can I do  
I'm losing myself over you  
Over and over again  
I'm crying my heart out for you  
No one in love likes to lose  
  
Once again I'm falling in love  
Like a fool I'm falling in love  
And I don't know what I'm doing, doing  
  
Once again it's somebody else  
That I need, I'm losing myself  
And I'm scared of what I'm feeling  
  
About you  
I'm crying my heart out for you  
What can I do  
I'm losing myself over you  
Over and over again  
I'm crying my heart out for you  
What can I do  
I'm losing myself over you  
Over and over again
