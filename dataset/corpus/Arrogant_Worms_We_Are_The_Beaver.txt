The US is the eagle, Russia is the bear,  
Australia is the kangaroo, cause they're kind of weird down there.  
Yeah, India is the tiger, that stands so proud and tall,  
But Canada is the greatest of them all.  
  
We are the beaver, we're furry and we're free  
Yeah, we are the beaver, we got two big front teeth  
Yeah, we are the beaver, we can chew right through small trees  
We are the beaver, we are the beaver, we are the beaver.  
  
You might think a rodent is a pretty lame choice  
For a national animal, but don't you listen to that voice.  
No, cause all them birds and predators, just take from the land  
But the beaver, always gives a dam.  
  
We are the beaver, we got cute little webbed feet  
Yeah, we are the beaver, it's bark we like to eat  
Yeah, we are the beaver, a nickel we complete.  
Yeah, we are the beaver, we are the beaver, we are the beaver.  
  
The eagle flies the sky above and swoops down on its prey  
The big bear will maul anyone who dares gets in its way  
The tiger is the greatest of the hunters today.  
But the beaver it can build dams. Yeah,  
The beaver it can build dams, dams, dams.  
  
We are the beaver, we slap our tails when danger's nearby  
We are the beaver, we got waterproof hides  
Yeah, we are the beaver, we got big bums and beady eyes.  
We are the beaver, we are the beaver, we are the beaver.  
  
We are the beaver, our name is often used as a double entedre  
We are the beaver, cause in Canada, both French and English belong  
Yeah, we are the beaver, and the subject of this song is  
We are the beaver, we are the beaver, we are the beaver.  
I can't hear you.  
We are the beaver, we are the beaver, we are the beaver  
Are you getting the point?  
We are the beaver, we are the beaver.  
We are the beaver
