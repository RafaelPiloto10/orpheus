Over the summer  
Somehow waiting, sometimes craving  
And I gave it all away  
Left my mind stripped away  
Kept everyone away  
  
I can't tell you anything you don't already know  
I can't tell you anything you don't already know  
I can't tell you anything  
  
I am the minister and the imposter  
You said I'm on my own  
Bu I am not alone  
You are the militant fighting to bring me home  
  
I can't tell you anything you don't already know  
I can't tell you anything you don't already know  
I can't tell you anything  
  
I can't tell you anything you don't already know
