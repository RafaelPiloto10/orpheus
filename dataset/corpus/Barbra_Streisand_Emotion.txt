Face in the mirror looks the same every morning  
I keep looking for a change  
Sometimes I wonder am I standing still in time  
Tired of doing everything the same old way  
Tired of playing all the games that people play  
This running round in circles gives me no peace of mind I need to find  
  
I need the emotion  
I need to laugh  
Sometimes I need to cry  
I need the emotion  
I need to love so hard  
I don't know what to do  
And baby, I need you  
Oh  
  
Sometimes I need a good old fashioned fight  
It doesn't matter If I'm wrong or right  
Please don't worry about it  
You know how much I care  
Sometimes I need to make love all day long  
Sometimes I need to hold you in my arms  
Let's drift away together  
It doesn't matter where  
As long as you're there cause I need  
  
I need the emotion  
I need to laugh  
Sometimes I need to cry  
I need the emotion  
I need to love so hard  
I don't know what to do  
And baby , I need you  
Oh  
  
Sometimes I need to tear the whole thing down  
Sometimes I need to turn it all around  
When I put it back together I'll be calling out to you  
Can you hear me?  
Can you hear me?  
Can you hear me?  
  
I need the emotion  
I need to laugh sometimes I need to cry  
Cry  
  
I need the emotion  
I need to feel each passing day go by  
By  
I need the emotion  
I need to love so hard I don't know what to do  
And baby I need you  
I need the emotion  
I need the emotion  
  
Yes I do  
I need the emotion  
I need ya baby  
I need, I need, I need emotion  
Oh won't ya baby?  
I need, I need, I need emotion  
Feels so good  
I need, I need, I need emotion  
Yes I do baby  
Oh  
  
I need the emotion  
I said emotion  
I need, I need, I need emotion  
I need, I need, I need emotion  
I need, I need, I need emotion  
Every day  
I need the emotion  
Emotion  
Every hour  
I need emotion baby
