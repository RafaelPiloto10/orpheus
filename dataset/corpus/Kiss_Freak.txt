I used to wonder why  
When I was walking by  
They talked about me  
What could it be  
They tried to break me  
Never could make me  
  
Out in the streets  
Takin' all the heat  
Dancin' in the sheets, oh yeah  
  
All those streaks in my hair  
People point at me and stare  
If they ask me I'll say, "yeah!"  
I'm a freak  
And I love the clothes I wear  
Where their life goes I don't care  
It's my price I'm proud to pay  
I'm a freak  
  
The called me crazy  
It doesn't faze me  
I'm doing fine, they're doing time  
They tried to break me  
Never could make me  
Live like a fire  
Dancin' with desire  
Walkin' on the wire, oh yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)  
  
I'm a freak and love what I see  
I'm a freak and I love being me (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
  
Out in the streets  
Takin' all the heat  
Dancin' in the sheets, oh yeah  
  
I pledge allegiance to the state of independence  
  
I got streaks in my hair  
People point at me and stare  
If they ask me I'll say, "yeah!"  
I'm a freak  
And I love the clothes I wear  
Where their life goes I don't care  
It's my price I'm proud to pay  
I'm a freak  
I'm the freak and I love what I see  
I'm the freak and I love being me  
I'm a freak and that's all I can be  
I'm a freak, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
I pledge allegiance to the state of independence
