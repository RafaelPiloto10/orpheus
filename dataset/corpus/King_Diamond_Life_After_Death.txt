Friday night  
  
Four shadows heading for the dark  
Four shadows heading for the past  
Four shadows heading for the graves in the wooded maze  
Four shadows looking for the place without a trace  
  
Midnight and they're here, midnight  
  
The old burial ground is part of the estate  
Hidden by the heavy trees where Jean le Noir he sleeps  
  
The shadows move  
They're here to feed the dead the shadows move  
  
Cause there is life after death  
Be patient and you will see  
Cause there is life after death  
Be patient and you will see  
Oh it must never end, never end, no  
  
Midnight and they're here, midnight  
  
Doctor le Croix, he's a voodoo sorcerer  
Madame Sarita, she's got the snake in her  
And Lula Chevalier, she's girl that no one ever sees  
Salem the servant, he belongs to the estate  
  
The shadows move  
They're here to feed the dead, the shadows move  
  
The Lafayettes are unaware, their butler Salem, he is here  
Voodoo has been his life, Voodoo cuts deep like a knife  
  
The shadows move  
They're here to feed the dead, the shadows move  
  
'Cause there is life after death  
Be patient and you will see  
'Cause there is life after death  
Be patient and you will see  
Oh it must never end..never end  
  
Midnight and they're here, midnight  
  
Midnight, life after death
