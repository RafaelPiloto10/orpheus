[Rap by Knowdaverbs:]  
I remember begging my mom for these Z. Cavarricci's  
With a striped genera shirt just to rock with these brutini's  
I begged and I begged, of course she said no  
So I committed to cutting grass just to conjour up the dough  
With a little extra change I'll cut a slope and a fade  
I'll be the freshest of the men in the midst of ninth grade  
It's crazy how we place these small things as important  
While the monument's reminding us of washed up Jordan's  
Rivers that is, not the be -ball player, told the mountains to  
Move and now there's no more Himalayas  
Had to set the devil straight since he was highly overrated  
Spoke and mountains moved and then the Alps disintegrated  
Racing through the fire I perspire like He times me  
And cross the finish line to realize that He's refined me  
Can't wait for morning breaks as joy turns from sorrow  
Busting victory laps around mount Kilimajarro  
Oh, we've made it this far and there's no turning back now  
With all of the joy deep inside  
We'll be praising His name, clapping hands while we're singing  
And dancing 'til the morning light, that's right, that's right  
Weight upon my shoulders, held a burden and they thought  
I'd never make it over, so I had to prove them wrong  
I never stopped believing, not a doubt in my mind  
The blessings I'm receiving, have cast the fears aside, yeah  
Wasn't easy, I got to let you know, had a lot to overcome  
But He loves me, he showed me the way to go  
Feels like life has just begun  
  
[Rap by Coffee:]  
I'm a scream from the rooftops, freckled face figment, light  
Complected pigment, least expected remnant, over flooding  
Supercharged enlarged freshly gutted, surgically removed was  
The flesh Jesus cut it. Was allotted when I got it, most  
Happiest, most joyful, vibrant, vibrating, dance around  
Illustrating. My matrix, a labyrinth, a maze, a holographic image,  
No end to my phonographic limits. If you've seen it once you've seen  
It twice, propelling, stopping swelling by applying bags of ice  
I'm open, before receiving Christ in darkness groping, Proverbs 4  
The focus of the diagnosis spoken made the decision to collision  
With incision self division multiplying and relying, sinful dying  
Cling to vision thank God in all I do, uh-uh, thank God in all I do  
Can't entrap me and I'm happy born anew  
Won't be easy, I've got to let you know  
There's a lot to overcome  
But He loves you, He'll show you the way to go  
You will feel like life has just begun  
  
[Rap by Bonified:]  
I got to keep moving and never carry the weight  
Trying to do it myself instead of walking in faith  
Leaving the rest to Him, giving my best to Him  
And put my flesh to death without a breath to take  
Had to battle the beats and overcame defeat  
Another factor of the seven from the garden of Eden  
Bonafied a true survivor of the wilderness  
Blessed beyond I gotta move on I gotta move on  
If you want to dance with me  
Now's your chance to be totally set free  
If you're in the groove  
And you know God is seeing you through  
Better make your move
