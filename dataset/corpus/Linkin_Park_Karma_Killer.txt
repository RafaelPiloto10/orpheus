I scream through the morning  
I'm kicking in the twilight as she comes  
Time waits at a darling  
Spooning the thickness out and feeding our open mouths  
  
The price you pay is always  
  
Chorus  
Too high, I'm too familiar  
Sunshine, Karma Killer  
  
Time waits at the darling  
When your following the animals around (around)  
I spread through the morning  
Feeding our open mouths and spooning the thickness out  
The price you pay is always  
Chorus (x2)  
  
My eyes are weary now  
My eyes are weary  
My eyes are weary now  
Chorus (x2)  
  
Karma Killer  
Will I ever miss you?
