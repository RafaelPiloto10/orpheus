She said she wanted more of that stuff  
The stuff that makes your heart your heart go pitter-pat  
The stuff that makes everything turn blue and green  
She said that she prefers it like that  
Give it up

So many people starving and fighting  
Too many salesman  
Too many batteries  
Says she likes getting high cos it's free  
Give it up  
Give it uh-uh-up  
Give it up  
Hey  
Up up up up up up up  
Give it up
