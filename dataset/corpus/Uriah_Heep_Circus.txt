Walkin' around this concrete garden  
Viewing all in vain  
Thinking why a dream  
Is driving everyone insane  
  
Then something will come  
And make you feel  
The master in control  
Still you're picking up  
And screwing anyone  
Who's got a soul  
  
I've been here  
Far too long to remember  
Sights and sounds  
From this town of clowns  
Makin' up, dressin' up  
Walkin' around  
Thinkin' that you're Greta Garbos  
  
I'm sorry my dears  
But we only sat down  
And laughed and laughed in sorrow  
But it was you  
That opened the door  
And it's that we thank you for  
  
Everyone insane  
Everyone's insane
