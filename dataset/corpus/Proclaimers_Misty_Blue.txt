When the inspiration  
Is above my station  
Thoughts are iqeienchoiy  
And I let them pass  
I tend to view this nation  
Through the condensation  
  
On a dirty glass  
When the singer solemn  
Was a honnie laddie  
When she brushed his hair  
With a watered comb  
Then he could have wandered  
And he could have shown ye  
Seven hit is like home  
If misty eyes can witness  
Love and affection  
  
Why does the heart still resist  
What the hell is wrong with you?  
I've got eyes of misty blue  
All the things I want to do  
Are all I ever wanted to  
  
As the ladik grew  
And he looked around him  
At the thugs and rapists  
In their stolen suits  
Louder beat the rhythm  
  
Of his bloody heart  
Telling him to shoot  
Thoughtless competition  
Like a home-made prison  
Made him fix his vision  
On a certain fate  
What's the use in winning  
All the worlds creation  
If you won't create.
