I look in your eyes, I really think you're fooling me  
You're pretty and nice, it doesn't matter don't you see  
'Cause I falling in love, it happens to me every day  
I'm falling in love, love just seems to slip away  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I'm falling in love  
Oh, oh  
  
Don't tell me your lies, I don't believe a word you say  
You do realize, I move around from day to day  
And I'm falling in love, it happens to me every day  
I'm falling in love, love just seems to slip away  
  
[Chorus x4]  
I'm falling in love  
Oh, oh
