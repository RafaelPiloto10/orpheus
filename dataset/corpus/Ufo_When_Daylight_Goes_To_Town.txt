I remember you when you was me  
Oh what a beautiful sight  
You'd cool it up  
Or you'd cool it down  
From some dizzy, dizzy height  
I can still hear that rolling sound  
Like a diesel in my head  
Sometimes I wake and I think of you now  
Forgetting that you're dead  
I was born on a rolling train  
Runnin' when I hit the ground  
I watch these wheels turning now  
Nothing here, nothing left  
Watching the daylight fade away  
Watching the daylight go to town  
Well  
This hotel rooms like the wild, wild west  
And there's strangers moving underground  
I still have your photograph  
It picks me up when I'm feeling down  
Pull up a chair and you pour me one  
Let's kick back and let it roll  
There's nothing here  
And there's nothing left  
But watching the daylight go to town  
We'd get swept up on a pillow fight  
You just couldn't let it go  
I watch these wheels turning now  
Nothing here, nothing left  
Watching the daylight fade away  
Watching the daylight go to town  
Don't you fade away  
solo  
Well I guess I'm walking right back home  
Got to set this all down  
Pull up a chair and you pour me two  
'cause there's nothing here,nothing left  
But watching the daylight turn around  
Watching the daylight go to town  
Watching this world spin around  
Watching the daylight go to town
