Let me tell you a story 'bout a girl I knew  
Fairest skin with eyes of blue  
I swear to the Lord that I loved her true  
It's a year now she's been gone  
  
Her spirit was as bright as the soft sunshine  
Lips the color of strawberry wine  
I wish to God she still was mine  
The chance won't come again  
  
After first we lay in love's sweet bed  
With one look at her eyes I might have read  
All the pain that was flying through her head  
Through my guilt I could not see  
  
I turned to her when the morning came  
Hungry thoughts racing through my brain  
But the knife in her heart screamed herself she'd slain  
And a note whispered love too soon  
  
Her old man screamed and her mother cried  
All I could do was to wonder why  
A girl in her youth was forced to die  
Is loving such a crime?  
  
She died (few in the years) with breasts still small  
Seeing sixteens summers and fifteen falls  
Me and my blindness never realized all  
The fear she kept inside  
  
Let me tell you a story 'bout a girl I knew  
Fairest skin with eyes of blue  
I swear to the Lord that I loved her true
