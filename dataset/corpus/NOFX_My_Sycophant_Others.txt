Inconsequent, social infant, insolent, insignificant  
And you're my sycophant  
Brown noser, confidante poser  
Shoved down the garbage disposer, sycophant  
Yes feeder, accolade breeder  
Like I need another cheerleader  
You're spineless and morally impotent  
You're my sycophant  
  
I don't need any more affirmation  
I get enough love in my rockupation arrogant  
Is a word that people call me  
That's why I don't need any more flattery  
  
Yes dudes and compliment throwers  
Ass kissers, anal smoke blowers  
I don't need to feel any more eminent  
From a sycophant  
  
"Seriously, you guys are totally wrong about Mike being wrong.  
And frankly Mike's right about him being right.  
Not only that remember my great idea that Mike had last week?  
I love it, we think it's great."  
  
Don't inflate my head anymore  
I don't need a bigger ego  
Shoot me down, I need regression  
Honesty mixed with rejection  
  
Take me down a rung or three  
I like to live in reality  
My head does not need more inflation  
It's already past regulation  
(Brown nosers, smoke blowers, yes yes-ers, no no-ers,  
Agree-ers with me-ers, those drinking my pee-ers)  
  
Yes feeder, accolade breeder  
Like I need another cheerleader  
You're spineless and morally impotent  
You're my sycophant
