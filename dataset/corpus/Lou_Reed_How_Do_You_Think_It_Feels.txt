How do you think it feels  
When you're speeding and lonely  
Come here baby  
How do you think it feels  
When all you can say is: If only  
  
If only I had a little  
If only I had some change  
If only, if only, only  
How do you think it feels  
And when do you think it stops?  
  
How do you think it feels  
When you've been up for five days  
Come down here Mamma  
Hunting around always - ooh  
'Cause you're afraid of sleeping  
  
How do you think it feels  
To feel like a wolf and foxy  
How do you think it feels  
To always make love by proxy?  
How do you think it feels  
And when do you think it stops?  
When do you think it stops?
