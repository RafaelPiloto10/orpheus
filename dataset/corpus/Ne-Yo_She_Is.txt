Caught up in the whirlwind  
I'm just a dragonfly yea  
And my wings ain't helping me yea  
  
I'm in a little trouble  
Should ,didn't see this coming tonight  
Have no clue what I'm gonna do now  
  
And ask me who's put me in this twist  
Ask me who's responsible for this  
  
She is  
Everything's all her fault  
Caught up in the whirlwind no one can help me  
Ask me who's responsible for this  
She is  
Everything's all her fault  
So now I'm in love  
And I didn't want to be  
And all because of she  
And all because of she  
  
Days ain't long enough  
Nights are even shorter this ain't fair  
Time don't wanna give me what I need  
All I'm asking is forever  
  
Forever little moment  
Listen to me this ain't how I told  
I don't know what she done to me  
But I like it  
  
And ask me who's put me in this twist  
Ask me who's responsible for this  
  
She is  
Everything's all her fault  
Caught up in the whirlwind no one can help me  
Ask me who's responsible for this  
She is  
Everything's all her fault  
And now I'm in love  
And I didn't want to be  
And all because of she  
And all because of she  
  
Said it's getting hard for me  
To picture me without you  
With every passing day baby  
But it's easy to answer who's the owner of my heart  
See me look at you and say  
  
She is  
Everything's all her fault  
Caught up in the whirlwind no one can help me  
Ask me who's responsible for this  
She is  
Everything's all her fault  
And now I'm in love  
And I didn't want to be  
And all because of she  
And all because of she  
And all because of she  
And all because of she
