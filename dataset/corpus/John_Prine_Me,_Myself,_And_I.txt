Well, tonight I'll throw a party  
And I know who I'll invite  
There's a strange and lonely person  
With whom I'll spend this night  
There'll be no old sad memories  
To haunt me till I die  
In that room there'll be a bottle  
And me, myself and I  
In that room there'll be a bottle  
And me, myself and I  
I've been introduced to many  
People I don't understand  
I've been in the house of lonely.  
I've shook a thousand shaking hands  
But tonight I'll be with someone  
Who will look me in the eye  
And in that room there'll be a bottle  
And me, myself and I  
In that room there'll be a bottle  
And me, myself and I  
At that party you'll see me when I was just a child  
In a room full of happy with a heart so meek and mild  
And that child will meet a ghost that will haunt him oh so bad  
From a family of confusion pretending love they never had.  
So, tonight I'll throw that party  
And I know just what I'll do  
Yes, I'll meet myself at midnight  
And cry the whole night through  
Yeah, I'll meet that ghost of sadness  
And he'll look me in the eye  
And in that room there'll be that bottle  
And me, myself and I  
In that room there'll be a bottle  
And me, myself and I
