[Judah to Jesse]  
  
You'll be so far out of control  
You'll be out of your mind  
You'll feel nothing, it's taking a hold of you  
Won't ya leave all your pain behind  
  
XTC Riders , Riders out of control  
Get you higher, higher  
Oh yeah  
XTC Riders , Riders  
Ain't never going home  
Oh, just let it ride  
  
You'll feel my X is taking control  
You'll be numb and blind  
Come kneel and pray for me, for a little while  
To the Neon God that's in your mind  
  
I'm your Messiah  
Dresses all in black  
Are you the chosen one  
I'll get you higher, no turning back  
My Neon Son  
Riding the XTC  
Riding the XTC
