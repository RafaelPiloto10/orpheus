A police car was outside your house today  
I haven't seen you, in a couple of days  
They knocked on your door, and then they went away  
Your mother looked scared, but she didn't cry  
She didn't cry  
  
On one hand, I've got myself to blame  
But on the other, it's always the same  
Follow suit  
Shake your head, tell me that it's a lie  
I don't want you for dead, but I want you to die  
Without a good friend, on a sunshine  
I know I want survival, but you don't know why  
  
Where is she?  
Where is she?  
Where is my baby girl  
Oh I've seen you you're crazy  
What have you done with my whole wide world?  
  
On one hand, I've got myself to blame  
But on the other, it's always the same thing  
Follow suit  
Shake your head, tell me that it's a lie  
I don't want you for dead, but I want you to die  
Without a good friend, on a bad day  
Without a soft surrender, but what do you say?  
  
All of these tears that we've cried  
All of these tears that we've cried  
  
Where is she?  
Where is she?  
Where is my baby girl  
Oh I've seen you, you're crazy  
What have you done with my whole wide world?  
  
Where is she?  
Where is she?  
Where is my baby girl  
Oh I've seen you you're crazy  
What have you done with my whole wide world?  
What have you done with my whole wide world?  
What have you done?
