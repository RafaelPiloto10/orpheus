We had a fight  
A lover's quarrel  
Angry words spoken in haste  
Deep in the night  
It went out of control  
And with tears streaming down my face  
I slammed the door and I walked out  
Swearing that we were through  
Now I'm sitting in a bar  
Thinking I've gone too far  
Wondering what I'm gonna do  
Thinking about calling you  
  
[Chorus]  
To my left blue collar  
To my right a high dollar man  
Across the bar a smooth bartender  
Who thinks I'm in the palm of his hand  
Well they buy me drinks  
Light my cigarette  
They're all wondering which one I'm gonna choose  
Oh my hand's on my glass  
My second margarita  
And my mind is on you  
My mind is on you  
  
Well I ran away  
In a moment of weakness  
I couldn't hold my own  
I should stay  
Because being together  
Means more than who was right or wrong  
And sitting in a room full of lonely faces  
You're the only one I see  
If you only knew  
I was thinking of you  
Would you come and rescue me  
Maybe I should call and see  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(My third margarita)  
  
I should of known I could never get along  
Outside of your love  
It's last call  
And I'm out of cigarettes  
They are all wondering what I'm gonna do  
Oh my hand's on the glass  
It's my last margarita  
And my mind is on you  
My mind is on you  
My mind is on you
