It's sunshine life for me  
If I could get away from this cloud over me  
Seems to just follow me around  
  
There's a good life had for free  
When you're out in the country  
That's what I could use  
If I could get away there soon  
  
It's a sunshine life for me  
If I could get away from this cloud over me  
Seems to just follow me around  
  
There's a good life had at sea  
If you're not in the navy  
That's the life for you  
Sail away raymond, sail away  
  
Now most folks just bore me  
Always imposing, and I'd rather meet a tree  
Somewhere out in the cornfield  
  
And it's a sunshine. ..  
It's a sunshine life for me  
If I could get away from this cloud over me  
Seems to just follow me around
