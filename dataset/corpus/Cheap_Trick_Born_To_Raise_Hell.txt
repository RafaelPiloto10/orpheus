Don't need you!  
I don't live in this town, don't trust you  
Don't trust anyone around, can't stand you  
Ain't gonna stick around  
  
I wasn't born for lovin' (I was born to raise hell)  
I wasn't born for lovin' (I was born to raise hell)  
  
I hate you, and I hate this town  
I mean you, and this pitiful town  
I hate you, you just make me laugh  
  
I wasn't born for lovin' (I was born to raise hell)  
I wasn't born for lovin' (I was born to raise hell)  
  
I hate you, you like me? (No!)  
You like our music, now don't yah? (No!)  
It's such a pity now you want me to go! (Go!)  
  
A lot of talk, not enough action  
Lot of lies, but no real reaction  
Lot of ways, but no real emotion  
  
I wasn't born for lovin' (I was born to raise hell)  
I wasn't born for lovin' (I was born to raise hell)

You're so pretty  
You're so pretty  
You're so fair  
Love your hair (ha ha ha)  
You're so pretty  
You're so pretty  
Love your makeup  
Love your nose  
Love your eyes  
Love your clothes  
You're pretty useless!  
  
I hate you, and I hate this town

I hate you, you just make me laugh
