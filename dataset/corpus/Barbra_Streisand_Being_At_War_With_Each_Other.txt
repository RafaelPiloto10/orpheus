Everyone comes from  
One father one mother  
So why do we complicate  
Our lives so much  
By being at war with each other  
  
Mm, maybe I'm crazy  
But I don't understand it  
Why do we seem to vote  
To dig more holes  
It's such a waste of a planet  
  
There must be a reason  
That I can't see  
Maybe somebody else now  
Knows better than me  
  
All I know is  
Everyone else is  
A sister or a brother  
So we've got to look around  
Again and stop  
Being at war with each other  
Being at war with each other  
  
Oh  
Maybe I'm crazy  
But I don't  
No, I don't understand it  
(There must be a reason)  
There must be a reason  
(There must be a reason)  
There must be a reason  
  
That I can't see  
Somebody else must be  
Better than me  
All I know is  
Everyone else is  
A sister or brothers  
So we've got to look around  
Again and stop  
Being at war with each other  
Being at war with each other
