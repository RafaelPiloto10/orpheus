Paranoid  
  
Did you ever have that feeling in your life, that someone was watching you?  
He don't have no reason, that's right. But, still he's there watching you.  
Someone is waiting just outside the door, to take you away.  
Everybody knows just what he's there for, to take you away.  
  
But, you don't know why he's been waiting.  
But, you don't know why he's been waiting.  
Spent too much time anticipating.  
Spent too much time anticipating.  
  
Did you ever think it could be you, that's just outside the door?  
There's just one way to find out if it's true. So, what you waiting for?  
Oh, get yourself together now, my friend, and step outside the pad.  
If there's no one waiting for you there, my friend, I think you should be
glad.  
  
But, who wasn't there that you should look out for?  
But, who wasn't there that you should look out for?  
Get back inside your wall, and shut the door.  
Get back inside your wall, and shut the door.  
  
You don't have nobody, don't need nobody, can't love nobody,  
You're better off by yourself.  
You ain't feelin' too bad, you're driving me mad, and say you're bad,  
You're better off by yourself.  
  
You don't have nobody, don't need nobody, can't love nobody,  
You're better off by yourself.  
You ain't feelin' too bad, you're driving me mad, and say you're bad,  
You're better off by yourself.  
  
Ahhhhh ...
