Well if you've been a married woman  
And things didn't seem to work out  
Divorce is the key to being loose and free  
But you're gonna be talked about  
Everybody knows that you loved once  
They think you'll love again  
You can't have a male friend  
When you're a has been  
Or a woman, you're rated x  
[yeah]  
And if you're rated x  
You're some kinda gold  
That even men turn [?] to make  
But I think it's wrong  
To judge every picture  
If a cheap camera makes a mistake  
So if your best friend's husband  
Says to you  
That you started lookin' good  
You should've known he would  
And he would if he could  
And he will if you're rated x  
Well nobody knows where you're going  
But they sure know where you been  
All they're thinking of  
Is your experience in love  
Well their minds fill up with sin  
The women all look at you like you're bad  
The men all hope you are  
But if you go too far  
You're gonna wear the scar  
Of a women, rated x  
[yeah]  
And if you're rated x  
You're some kinda gold  
That even men turn [?] to make  
But I think it's wrong  
To judge every picture  
If a cheap camera makes a mistake  
So if your best friend's husband  
Says to you  
That you started lookin' good  
You should've known he would  
And he would if he could  
And he will if you're rated x  
Yeah us women don't have a chance  
Cause if you've been married  
You can't have any fun at all  
You're rated x  
No matter what they do  
They're gonna talk about ya  
Don't know what to think about it  
Just let 'em talk  
Just let 'em talk meg
