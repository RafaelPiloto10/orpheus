The other night as I was driving  
Up the highway through the past  
I was torn betwwen the future  
And the memories of the past  
  
Fell in love for the wrong reasons  
Gave our hearts then lost control  
So I eased it up past sixty  
Turn away and let it roll  
  
We had the plan to stay together  
You with your dreams me with mine  
With the promess of forever  
We would stand the test of time  
  
Like the hot winds come in summer  
Trouble waited at the door  
Time to leave this all behind me  
Turn away and let it roll  
  
Chorus  
Let it roll the way these heart aches  
Let it roll away theses fears  
Let it roll away the reasons  
We've been crying all these years  
  
Every mile that comes between us  
There's a cleansing in my soul  
Throw away the rear view mirror  
Adios and let it roll  
  
Now everybody takes their chances  
Everybody has to choose  
But when love hangs in the balance  
There's an innocence you lose  
  
I don't know what lies before me  
But I'm sure I have to go  
Feel the tears slowly descending  
It's my last so let it roll  
  
Chorus  
...  
Time to leave this all behind me  
Adios and let it go
