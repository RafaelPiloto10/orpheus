Rising above  
Tension below  
Learn from the in-between  
  
Blinded by trust  
Asleep to the truth  
Awakened by disbelief  
  
But somewhere I've found  
Strength in my soul  
But still you refuse to see  
  
Are you sure I'm not all right  
Cause lately I've been feeling fine  
  
Every lifeline leads its own way to the heavens  
But I have seen you run in circles unforgiven  
Is there anything in this world that can make you stop?  
Oh, you're a machine  
  
A world of your own  
Hollow inside  
Careful when worlds collide  
  
I'm filling my life  
With all it can hold  
I'll carry it on with pride  
  
Are you sure I'm not all right  
Cause lately I've been feeling fine  
  
Every lifeline leads its own way to the heavens  
But I have seen you run in circles unforgiven  
Is there anything in this world that can make you stop?  
Oh, you're a machine  
  
The sun's still above  
All the rain that's coming down  
And I can fell the clouds drifting away  
Now the sky is open wide  
  
Turn the light on  
And you will see things so much clearer  
There's no heart, there's no heart  
And I've spent all this time feeling  
Something you can't feel at all  
You're a machine,  
Oh, you're a machine
