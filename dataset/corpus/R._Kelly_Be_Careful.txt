2 years ago, promises is all I heard, wait a minute, let me finish  
2 years ago, promises is all I heard, out of your mouth  
Now you wanna walk away boy, and tear down the walls in this house  
You used to tell me sweet things, sweet things in the morning time  
Now all you do is hurt me, and think that everything is fine  
  
You better be careful what you say to me  
'Cause it might turn around on you  
You better be careful what you do to me  
'Cause somebody might do it to you  
  
Now who was there for you, when your ass was out of work  
All by myself, taking little man to church  
So quick to hang up the phone, when I step, in the room  
Then you want to turn it all around, I'm gettin tired of playing fool  
  
You better be careful what you say to me  
'Cause it might turn around on you  
You better be careful what you do to me  
'Cause somebody might do it to you  
  
If the shoe fits, wear it boy (yaw yaw yaw yaw, yaw yaw yaw yaw)  
If the shoe fits, wear it boy (yaw yaw yaw yaw, yaw yaw yaw yaw)  
  
2 years ago, didn't know you had male friends, wait a minute, let me finish  
2 years ago, didn't know you had male friends, off up in college  
I found out you're still reaching out to some of them, Mrs. Busy Body  
You used to listen to me, when you were down and lost  
But now, you don't even respect me, ever since I got laid off  
  
You better be careful what you say to me  
'Cause it might turn around on you  
You better be careful what you do to me  
'Cause somebody might do it to you  
  
Now who gave you money, when your ass was broke, without a doubt  
And even though lil' man is not my child, I made him mine, hm-hm  
So quick to run to your friends, and talk about, what we do in this house  
And then you wanna party all night long, what the hell you talking 'bout  
  
You better be careful what you say to me  
'Cause it might turn around on you  
You better be careful what you do to me  
'Cause somebody might do it to you  
  
If the shoe fits, wear it girl (Yaw yaw yaw yaw, yaw yaw yaw yaw)  
If the shoe fits, wear it girl (Yaw yaw yaw yaw, yaw yaw yaw yaw)
