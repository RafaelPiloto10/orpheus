I am overground and  
Out-selling it.  
Since god thinks I don't exist  
The beatings happen per minute  
This is not  
Blue-collar-white-corrective politics  
I'm on a hate American style  
Kick.  
  
This is the black collar song  
Put it in your middle finger and sing along  
Use your fist and not your mouth  
(come on, come on)  
This is the black collar song  
Put it in your middle finger and sing along  
Use your fist and not your mouth  
(come on, come on)  
  
I'm on a campaign for pain  
And when I get elected  
I'll wipe the white of your house  
The smile off your face  
  
This is the black collar song  
Put it in your middle finger and sing along  
Use your fist and not your mouth  
(come on, come on)  
This is the black collar song  
Put it in your middle finger and sing along  
Use your fist and not your mouth  
(come on, come on)  
I woke up today and wished for tomorrow  
I don't want to be like anyone else  
I woke up today and wished for tomorrow  
I don't want to even be myself  
  
I said, no, this isn't your song  
We can't all get along  
It's too hard to hold hands when  
Your hand's a fist  
My hate-pop won't ever stop  
I'm fucking glad we're different  
This is my hate american style  
Hit.  
  
Don't bring, don't sing it  
Use your fist and not your mouth.  
  
This is the black collar song  
Put it in your middle finger and sing along  
Use your fist and not your mouth  
(come on, come on)  
This is the black collar song  
Put it in your middle finger and sing along  
Use your fist and not your mouth  
(come on, come on)  
I woke up today and wished for tomorrow  
I don't want to be like anyone else  
I woke up today and wished for tomorrow  
I don't want to even be myself
