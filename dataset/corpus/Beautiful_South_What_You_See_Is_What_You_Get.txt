(The Dramatics)  
  
Some people are made of plastic.  
You know some people are made of wood.  
Some people have hearts of stone.  
You know some people are up to no good.  
  
But baby I'm for real, I'm as real as real can get.  
If what you're lookin' for is real love then  
What you see is what you get.  
  
What you see (what you see)  
Is what you get now (is what you get)  
X2  
Honey what you see is what you get,  
And if you've found the real thing it's the best thing yet.  
  
Some people are made of lies.  
Breed them to shame your name.  
But baby I have good intentions.  
  
But baby I'm for real, I'm as real as real can get.  
If what you're lookin' for is real love then  
What you see is what you get.  
  
What you see (what you see)  
Is what you get now (is what you get)

Honey what you see is what you get,  
And if you've found the real thing it's the best thing yet.
