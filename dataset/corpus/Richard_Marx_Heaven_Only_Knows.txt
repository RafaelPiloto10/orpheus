I watch the world go round and round  
And my life goes by at the speed of sound  
I walk the night  
And I wonder just where I belong, oh  
  
My heart is young, but my soul is old  
I've never been one to do what I was told  
My back to the wall  
Is the only place I can feel strong, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
Heaven only knows what lies before me  
Heaven only knows what all my searching is for  
All my life I've waited for a miracle  
But I can't ask for anything more  
  
I like to think I'm a faithful man  
To resist desire, I do all I can  
I hope to die in the arms of the woman I love, oh  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
I've always wondered how to know right from wrong  
Looking for a reason to replace what is gone  
But somehow the road just seems to lead right back to me  
  
[Chorus]
