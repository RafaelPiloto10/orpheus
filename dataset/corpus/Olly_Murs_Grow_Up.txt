I thought about you the other day,  
What the hell happened with you and me?  
'Cause oh, ain't no loving no more!  
  
You ain't as cool as you used to be,  
Closer to the mirror than you are to me,  
I said oh, had to show you that door.  
Someday I hope that we can fix it cos I ain't too proud to try.  
Say hi to your friends and if they ever ask you why... We don't talk!  
  
[chorus]  
Know you gotta grow up,  
Ain't you sick of being immature?  
Talking loud cos you're insecure  
You always turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, Cmon!  
Why you always gotta show off?  
It's something that I already know  
That when you hear this on the radio  
You're gotta turn it up, turn it up, turn it up.  
Cause it's all about you  
It's all about you.  
  
Now, you said some stuff that you can't take back.  
How did you think that I would react?  
Cause you, you must be outta your mind!  
How did we go straight from love to hate? Now it's so deep that we can't be
mates.  
I said oh, we should give it sometime.  
  
Someday I hope that we can fix it cos I ain't too proud to try.  
Say hi to your friends and if they ever ask you why... We don't talk!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ohhhhhhhhhh  
Anytime you start it,  
Grow up a little, darlin x2  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ohhhhhhhhhh  
Anytime you start it,  
Grow up a little, darlin
