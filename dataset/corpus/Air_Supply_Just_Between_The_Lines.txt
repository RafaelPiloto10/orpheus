(graham russell)  
I'll always need a friend  
One I can defend  
All I've got to give  
Is do you want to live  
With me every day till I pass away  
I've been sitting here  
Frightened stiff with fear  
Love has brought it on  
And it must go on  
Being here with you,  
Taking what is mine  
Just between the lines  
And here we are, here we are  
All alone for me to take  
And here you are, here you are  
All alone for me to take  
Fell in love today  
Little words to say  
Let us close the door  
That's what doors are for  
Being here with you  
Taking what is mine  
Just between the lines  
I'll always need a friend  
One I can defend  
All I've got to give  
Is do you want to live  
Being here with you  
Taking what is mine  
Just between the lines
