Yeah right!  
  
Break down  
And shake for me  
Nothing ever is the way  
You want it to be  
Nothing even tastes right  
Now that it's over  
  
Break down  
And shake for me  
Don't write words  
Unless you want me to read them  
Nothing really matters  
Now that it's over  
  
Maybe we can be friends  
Now that we're older  
We can have fun  
Like we did in the early days  
Now that it's over  
  
Yeah right!  
  
Break down  
And shake for me  
Nothing ever seems  
The way it ought to be  
Nothing ever seems right  
Now that it's over  
  
Yeah now maybe we can be friends  
Maybe we can be closer  
We can have fun  
Like we did in the old days  
Now that it's over  
  
My bad dreams just don't seem the same  
Baby without you  
I wish you were willing to accept the blame  
Yeah for everything you do  
  
My nightmares just don't scare me now  
Baby without you  
I wish that I could find the words to tell  
In the best way possible  
You and your friends to go to hell  
  
Ooh, break up time  
Is never easy to do  
Nothing ever ends  
The way you want it to  
Nothing seems to make sense  
Now that it's over  
  
Yeah now maybe we can be friends  
Yeah now that you're leaving  
You can be nice to me  
Maybe I'm dreaming  
I am a lot better now than just OK  
Maybe I am just waking up  
In my own way  
Now that it's over  
  
Now that it's over  
  
My bad dreams just don't seem the same  
Baby without you  
I wish you were willing to accept the blame  
Yeah for all the shitty things you do  
Nightmares just don't scare me now  
Baby without you  
I wish that I could find the words to tell  
You to go politely go fuck yourself  
Yeah now that it's over  
  
Now that it's over [Repeat x4]
