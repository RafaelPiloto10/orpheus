You can dance  
Every dance with the guy who gives you the eye  
Let him hold you tight  
You can smile  
Every smile for the man who held your hand  
'neath the pale moonlight  
But don't forget who's takin' you home  
And in whose arms you're gonna be  
So darlin' save the last dance for me  
Well you can know  
That the music's fine like sparklin' wine  
Go and have your fun  
Love and sing  
But while we're apart, don't you give your heart to anyone  
But don't forget who's takin' you home  
And in whose arms you're gonna be  
So darlin', save the last dance for me  
Baby don't you know I love you so  
Can't you feel it when we touch  
I will never never let you go  
I love you so much  
Well you can dance  
You can carry on till the night is gone  
And it's time to go  
If he asks  
If you're all alone, can he take you home  
You must tell him no  
  
Cause don't forget who's takin' you home  
And in whose arms you're gonna be  
So darlin', save the last dance for me
