Meet me tonight in dreamland,  
Under the silv'ry moon.  
Meet me tonight in dreamland,  
Where love's sweet roses bloom.  
Come with the love light gleaming  
In your dear eyes of blue.  
Meet me in dreamland,  
Sweet, dreamy dreamland,  
There let my dreams come true.  
Meet me tonight in dreamland,  
Under the silv'ry moon.  
Meet me tonight in dreamland,  
Where love's sweet roses bloom.  
Come with the love light gleaming  
In you dear eyes of blue.  
Meet me in dreamland,  
Sweet, dreamy dreamland,  
There let my dreams come true.
