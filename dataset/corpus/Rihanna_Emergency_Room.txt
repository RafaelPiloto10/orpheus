(Ray L)  
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa  
Ey  
  
(Rihanna)  
[Verse 1:]  
I was pickin up your clothes in the closet (closet)  
I was bout to throw your jeans in the washer (washer)  
Till I saw a piece of paper sayin tasha (Tasha)  
I gotta say I found this a bit shockin  
And some reciepts here that say you went shoppin  
You bought some Nikey shoes  
But why you buyin stockings?  
Boy how could you lie to me?  
I thought you would die for me  
I'm not accepting another apology.  
  
[Chorus:]  
After three years Ima let it go  
Can't stand around cryin no more  
Got your bags packed sittin by the door  
Ima leave you heart broken on the floor  
You gonna be in the Emergency Room  
I'm standing by your bed  
And so tempted to pull out your iv  
You gonna be in the Emergency Room  
I'm fightin with myself  
I can't hurt you even though you hurt me  
You gonna be in the Emergency Room  
Tryin to call a nurse but nobody can help you now  
Let me see you try to live without me  
Now wheres your heartbeat?  
Flat line on the E-K-G  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Well I was home late at night watchin tv  
Got a call from my girl sayin Riri  
Saw your man in the club  
I thought he was out of town doin business  
Said that he'd be back in three weeks  
Now I'm mad (mad)  
Sittin in the kitchen gettin sad (sad)  
Lookin at your pictures  
Boy how could you lie to me?  
I thought you would die for me  
I'm not accepting another apology.  
  
[Chorus:]  
After three years Ima let it go  
Can't stand around cryin no more  
Got your bags packed sittin by the door  
Ima leave you heart broken on the floor  
You gonna be in the Emergency Room  
I'm standing by your bed  
And so tempted to pull out your iv  
You gonna be in the Emergency Room  
I'm fightin with myself  
I can't hurt you even though you hurt me  
You gonna be in the Emergency Room  
Tryin to call a nurse but nobody can help you now  
Let me see you try to live without me  
Now wheres your heartbeat?  
Flat line on the E-K-G  
  
(Ray L)  
I did you wrong girl (I did)  
Had a bunch of numbers in my phone girl (I did)  
But we been in this relationship to long girl  
For you to be listening to your silly home girls  
Better go on girl  
Now baby think about it  
Everything we do they gonna read about it  
Put it on the radio and tv outlet  
Do you wanna see your picture in that paper?  
You know them haters  
You hear that 808  
The drum that's my heartbeat  
I'm going numb  
I said Rihanna, I'm feelin stressed  
I'm goin under cardiac arrest  
  
(Rihanna)  
You gonna be in the Emergency Room  
I'm standing by your bed  
And so tempted to pull out your iv  
You gonna be in the Emergency Room  
I'm fightin' with myself  
I can't hurt you even though you hurt me  
You gonna be in the Emergency Room  
Tryin to call a nurse but nobody can help you now  
Let me see you try to live without me  
Now where's your heartbeat?  
Flat line on the E-K-G
