A chili wind is blowing  
And I'm all covered up  
With despair and desperation  
And it just won't let me up  
It's come in time to face the truth  
And somehow I got to find the strength to move  
I gotta get up and get over you  
  
Another dawn it breaking  
And the people pass me by  
And they don't know how hard I'm making  
And there ain't no place to hide  
I've got to find some resistance, forgetting your existence  
I've got to get up and get over you  
If I could have one more chance  
With you by my side  
You know I would take back that moment  
When we said goodbye ooh yeah  
  
A chili wind is still blowing  
And the sun it going down  
And the streets are all in tears  
And there not a soul around  
It's coming time to face the truth  
And it's so hard to say I I gotta to do  
Somehow I got to get up and get over you  
Ooh man ooh hey get over you hey get over you  
I gotta get over you I gotta get over you oh
