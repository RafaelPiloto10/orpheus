A live begins another's over  
As another day begins  
Life runs full circle getting older  
It happens to me  
It happens to you  
I do believe you're still around me  
You're still around me all the time  
I have no doubt one day in heaven  
I will see you again  
I'll see you again, see you again  
Break the bread drink the wine  
In my heart you'll live forever  
The time to go is never right  
When we say goodbye  
While we're here we shouldn't waste  
A day in life to say I love you  
It's now that I'd just wish so much, to see you  
Eye to eye  
When you came home the war was over  
So many years before my time  
I was so proud the day you told me  
You haven't hurt anyone  
No one  
Break the bread drink the wine  
In my heart you'll live forever  
The time to go is never right  
When we say goodbye  
While we're here we shouldn't waste  
A day in life to say I love you  
It's now that I'd just wish so much to see you  
Eye to eye
