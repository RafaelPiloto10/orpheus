Tomorrow I'll say happy birthday darling  
And surprise you with a gift when I come home  
Then mine forgetful arms will reach out for you  
I can't forget you just because you're gone  
  
I can't believe that you've stopped loving me  
It's too much for me to understand  
How can anything so real become a dream  
I can't believe that you've stopped loving me  
  
I accepted all the reasons why you left me  
I've gone back and relived all the love we've had  
For every tear we lost I've found the thousands smiles  
And the good times always outweight the bad  
  
I can't believe that you've stopped loving me  
I can't believe that you've stopped loving me
