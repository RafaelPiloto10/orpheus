My shattered dreams and broken heart  
Are mending on the shelf  
I saw you  
Holding hands  
Standing close to someone else  
Now I sit all alone  
Wishin' all my feeling was gone  
Gotta get over you  
Nothing for me to do  
But have one last cry  
  
One last cry  
Before I leave it all behind  
I've gotta put you out of my mind  
This time  
Stop living a lie  
  
I know I got to be strong,  
But around me  
Life goes on  
And on  
And on  
And on  
  
I'm gonna dry my eyes  
Right after I have one last cry  
  
One last cry  
Before I leave it all behind  
I've gotta put you out of my mind  
For the very last time  
Quit living a lie  
  
I guess I'm down  
I guess I'm down  
I guess I'm down  
To my last cry
