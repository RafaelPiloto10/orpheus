Have a drink they're buying,  
Bottom of, bottle of denial,  
  
Big guy, big eye, watching me,  
Have to wonder what it sees,  
Progress, laced with, ramifications,  
Freedom's big plunge.  
  
Pull the innocent from a crowd,  
Raise the sticks then bring 'em down ,  
If they fail to obey,  
If they fail to obey.  
  
For every tool they lend us, a loss of independence.  
  
I pledge to my grievance to the flag,  
Cause you don't give blood, then take it back again,  
We're deserving of much more.  
  
Progress, taste it, invest-it-all,  
Champagne breakfast for everyone.  
  
Break the innocent when they're proud,  
Raise the stakes, then bring 'em down,  
If they fail to obey,  
If they fail to obey.  
  
Pledge my grievance to the flag,  
Aw come on, don't give blood, then take it back again,  
We're all deserving something more.  
  
I want to breathe, part of the seen,  
I want to taste, everyone I see,  
I want to run, when I'm up high,  
I want to run to the sea,  
I only want life to be,  
I just want to be,  
I will feel alive as long as I am free.
