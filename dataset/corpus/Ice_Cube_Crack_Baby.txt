Let me tell y'all, the definition of shady  
It's a nigga like you that think it's all gravy  
Do some dumb shit, dumber than join the Navy  
What yo' broke ass doin' with a hundred babies?  
Strap it on please, you're spreadin' S.T.D's  
Throughout the hood, you's a walkin' disease  
You took the bad ones, and you turned 'em into sad ones  
Bitch you dumb too, fuckin' with the last ones  
You's a crazy nigga goin' in and out of there  
Like you love it, but nigga I'm outta here  
When they crack the door, boy I ain't comin' back  
I'm tryin' to figure out, why you keep runnin' back?

Sick with it, bipolar, crazy as the Ayatollah  
Went in to buy a soda, now we shootin' at the rollers  
He looked at me like "Cube, I thought you was a soldier"  
I am nigga, but not for a Coca-Cola  
Jumped out my car when his head hit the tar  
It bust like a jar but he still wanted to spar  
They jumped out, and hit his ass with the taser  
Fifty thousand volts turned him into Joe Frazier  
Beat they ass, took they badge, took they guns and they cash  
Came by the bar, nigga rollin' in they squad car  
Blue and red lights flashin' like a superstar  
I just shook my head and wondered who the fuck you are

You've got to be a crack baby, turn into a grown-up  
Sharp as a bowling ball, brain like a doughnut  
My daddy told me that the early bird get the worm  
He told me that the early dope fiend get the sherm  
Three AM, see you ridin' on that bicycle  
Old motherfucker, what you doin' on that tricycle?  
You's a cold motherfucker like a icicle  
With your grandmama purse tryin' to buy a nickel  
I should kick ya ass just because she can't do it  
Cause all you do is talk shit and you drink fluid  
You say "Yeah man, you better get used to it"  
They say God is perfect, and I say he blew it
