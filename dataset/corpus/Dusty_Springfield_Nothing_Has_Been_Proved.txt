Mandy's in the papers 'cause she tried to go to spain  
She'll soon be in the dock and in the papers once again  
Vicki's got her story about the mirror and the cane  
It may be false, it may be true  
But nothing has been proved  
  
Stephen's in his dressing-gown now, breakfasting alone  
Too sick to eat, he's on his feet and to the telephone  
The police inspector soothes him with his sympathetic tone  
It may be false, it may be true  
But nothing has been proved  
  
In the house a resignation  
Guilty faces, every one  
Christine's fallen out with lucky  
Johnny's got a gun  
"Please Please Me"'s number one  
  
(It's a scandal! it's a scandal! such a scandal!)  
Now, Stephen's in the dock for spending money that was earned  
By Christine, and the prosecution says that money burned  
A hole in Stephen's pocket, for expensive sins he yearned  
It may be false, it may be true  
But nothing has been proved  
  
In the news the suicide note  
In the court an empty space  
Even Mandy's looking worried  
Christine's pale and drawn  
"Please Please Me"'s number one  
  
(it's a scandal! it's a scandal! such a scandal!)  
Last night he wrote these words to his friend:  
"Sorry about the mess  
I'm guilty 'til proved innocent  
In the public eye and press"  
The funeral's very quiet because all his friends have fled  
They may be false, they may be true  
They've all got better things to do  
They may be false, they may be true  
But nothing has been proved  
Nothing  
Nothing has been proved  
Oh, nothing  
Nothing  
Oh, nothing  
Nothing  
Oh, nothing
