You say you want a revolution, well you know, we all want to change the world  
You tell me that it's evolution, well you know  
We all want to change the world  
But when you talk about destruction  
Don't you know that you can count me out  
Don't you know it's gonna be alright, alright, alright.  
You say you got a real solution, well you know, we'd all love to see the plan  
You ask me for a contribution, well you know, we are doing what we can  
But if you want money for people with minds that hate  
All I can tell you brother is you have to wait  
Don't you know it's gonna be alright, alright, alright.  
You say you'll change the constitution, well you know  
We all want to change your head  
You tell me it's the institution, well you know  
You better free your mind instead  
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao  
You ain't gonna make it with anyone anyhow  
Don't you know it's gonna be alright, alright, alright
