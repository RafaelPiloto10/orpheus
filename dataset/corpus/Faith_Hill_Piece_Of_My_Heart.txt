Didn't I make you feel  
Like you were the only man  
And didn't I give you everything  
That a woman possibly can  
Each time I tell myself I think I've had enough  
Well I'm gonna show you baby that a woman can be tough  
So come on, come on, come on and  
  
Take it  
Take another little piece of my heart now baby  
Take another little piece of my heart  
I know you will  
And break it  
Break another little piece of my heart now baby  
'Cause you know you got it, if it makes you feel good, so good  
  
You're out on the street lookin' good  
Baby deep down in your heart you know that it ain't right  
No you'll never hear me cryin'  
You know I cry all the time  
Each time I tell myself that I can't stand the pain  
You hold me in your arms and I start singin' once again  
So come on, come on, come on and  
  
Take it  
Take another little piece of my heart now baby  
Take another little piece of my heart I know you will  
And break it  
Break another little piece of my heart now baby  
'Cause you know you got it, if it makes you feel good, so good  
  
Each time I tell myself that I can't stand the pain  
You hold me in your arms and I start singin' once again  
So come on, come on, come on and  
  
Take it  
Take another little piece of my heart now baby  
Won't you just take it,  
Take another little piece of my heart I know you will  
And you will break it  
Break another little piece of my heart now baby  
'Cause you know you got it if it makes you feel good, oh so good  
  
Take another little piece of my heart now baby  
Won't you just take it,  
Take another little piece of my heart I know you will  
And you will break it  
Break another little piece of my heart now baby  
Take another little piece of my heart,  
My heart, my heart, my heart, my heart  
Take another little piece of my heart now baby  
Won't you just break it  
Break another little piece of my heart  
My heart, my heart, you cannot break  
Break another little piece of my heart
