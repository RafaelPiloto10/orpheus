You do something to me  
Something that simply mystifies me  
Tell me, why should it be  
You have the power to hypnotize me  
  
Let me live 'neath your spell  
You do that voodoo that you do so well  
  
For you do something to me  
That nobody else could do.  
  
Let me live 'neath your spell  
You do that voodoo that you do so well  
  
For you do something to me  
That nobody else could do  
  
That nobody else could do
