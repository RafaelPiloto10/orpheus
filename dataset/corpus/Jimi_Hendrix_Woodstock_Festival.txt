500,000 halos ...  
Outshined the mud and history.  
We washed and drank in  
God's tears of joy,  
And for once...and for everyone...  
The truth was not a mystery--  
  
Love called to all...music is magic.  
As we passed over and beyond the walls of nay.  
Hand in hand as we lived and  
Made real the dreams of peaceful men--  
  
We came together...danced with  
The pearls of rainy weather  
Riding the waves of music and  
Space--music is magic...  
Magic is life...  
Love as never loved before...  
Harmony to son and daughter...man and wife.
