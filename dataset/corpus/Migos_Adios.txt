These bitches see a young nigga  
'Cause I'm walkin' round with these hundreds  
And I pull up in that Lambo  
So fast you ain't even see me coming  
I got chickens out in the country  
Got a AK finna start drumming  
You was talkin' shit behind my back  
But now here a nigga you ain't sayin' nothin'  
Young rich nigga live forever  
My trap game A1 clever  
You say that I'm broke how dare ya  
I ain't never goin' broke never ever  
Your arms and your legs I sever  
Then feed 'em to the sharks for dinner  
Quavo too hot like a kettle  
Young nigga and I keep the heavy metal  
  
Adios, adios, adios  
You ain't talkin' cash nigga adios  
Adios, adios, adios  
You ain't talkin' to the plug nigga adios  
Adios, adios, adios

Adios, adios, adios  
You ain't talkin' gwala nigga adios  
  
Yeen talkin' 'bout cash adios  
I pull up in drop top convertible Rolls  
My chain is all gold, the Fendi to Gucci to Louis  
I see it I buy what I want (It's mine!)  
Young rich nigga I take a toast (Rich nigga!)  
Finessin' Pablo, he gotta go  
I'm on the boat, finessin' Pablo out his O's  
Meetin' up with Carlito (Carlito!)  
I'm takin' them trips cross the globe  
The dope that I smoke get you high, UFO  
I'm sellin you ain't gettin' it back, no repo  
It's finito, bitch adios  
You standin' and lookin' like you seen a ghost  
Maybe it's 'cause I'm in this Phantom Ghost  
I'm trippin' I just finessed you out the do'  
Finessin' the plug, it's adios  
  
Adios, adios, adios  
You ain't talkin' cash nigga adios  
Adios, adios, adios  
You ain't talkin' to the plug nigga adios  
Adios, adios, adios
