Watch the circle, dehumanize.  
Fuck the world, stay outside.  
You tread on me and you will find,  
That you flirt with death before your time.  
  
Face the music and the time has come!  
Into the circle!  
Electroviolence.  
  
Violence! Electroviolence.  
  
Keep your distance, subdivide.  
Do not enter, conservative type.  
Sweaty bodies, bodily harm.  
Abuse thy neighbour, that's the charm.  
  
Blood! shed on everyone.  
Don't mistake, violence for fun.  
Blood! guilty fashion fiend,  
What you here for, you don't fit in...!  
  
Take the shot, take the pain.  
Rebound! back again,  
Uncivilized reaction appeals to me.  
No restraints face reality.  
  
Never victim, always vice.  
Taking charge, desensitized.  
Do unto others, stay unbowed.  
You social misfit, you're one of us now.  
  
Violence! Hey! violence!  
Electroviolence!!!
