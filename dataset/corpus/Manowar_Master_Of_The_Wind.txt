In the silence of the darkness when all are fast asleep  
I live inside your dreams calling to your spirit  
As the sail calls the wind, here the angels sing.  
Far behind the sun, across the western sky  
Reach to the blackness, find a silver line  
In a voice I whisper a candle in the night  
Will carry all our dreams on a single beam of light.  
  
Close your eyes, look into the dreams  
Winds of changes will winds of fortune bring.  
  
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky  
Gold is at the end for each of us to find.  
There the road begins where another one will end,  
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend  
All to be the Master of the wind.  
  
Falling stars now light my way my life has written on the wind  
Clouds above, clouds below, high ascend between the spirit  
When the wind fills the sky and clouds will move aside,  
There will be a road to all our dreams and for every day that stings  
Two better days it brings, nothing is as bad as it seems.  
  
Close your eyes, look into the dreams  
Winds of change will winds of fortune bring.  
  
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky  
Gold is at the end for each of us to find.  
There the road begins where another one will end  
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend  
All to be the Master of the wind.
