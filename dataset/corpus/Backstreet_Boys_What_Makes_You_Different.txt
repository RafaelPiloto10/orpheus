Ohh oh yeah  
  
You don't run with the crowd  
You go your own way  
You don't play after dark  
You light up my day  
  
Got your own kind of style  
That sets you apart  
Baby that's why you've camptured my heart  
  
I know sometimes you feel  
Like you don't fit in  
And this world doesn't know  
What you have within  
  
When i look at you  
I see something rare  
A rose that can grow anywhere  
And there's no one i know that can compare  
  
Chorous:  
What makes you different  
Makes you beautiful  
What's there inside you  
Shines through to me  
In your eyes i see all the love i'll ever need  
What makes you different makes you beautiful to me  
  
You've got something so real  
You touched me so deep (touched me so deep)  
The material things  
Don't matter to me  
So come as you are  
You've got nothing to prove  
You won me with all the you do  
  
And i wanna take this chance to say to you  
  
Chorous  
  
You don't know how you've touched my life  
Oh there's so many ways, i just can't describe  
You taught me what love is supposed to be  
It's all the little things that made you beautiful to me  
  
Chorous  
  
(in background)  
Everything in you is beautiful  
Love you give shines right through me  
Everything in you is beautiful  
Beautiful to me (to me)
