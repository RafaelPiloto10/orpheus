You say you turned it off hid your heart upon a shelf  
Scared of what it might cost to take it down for sombody else  
Cause loving her you lost too much of yourself  
Baby can't you see that she's not me  
Not me at all  
  
And I need you to know you can fall into me  
That my arms are wide open and will always be  
Right here waiting staying strong come and fall into me  
Don't compare her to me, believe in love  
  
I'll follow any road anywhere to get to you  
I'll open up my soul if that is what you need me to do  
Now baby it's your move all you got to do is  
Believe in love just believe in us  
  
And I need you to know you can fall into me  
That my arms are wide open and will always be  
Right here waiting staying strong come and fall into me  
Just believe in love, just believe in us  
  
Just believe in love just believe in us  
  
Baby  
  
I need you to know you can fall into me  
That my arms are wide open and will always be  
Right here waiting staying strong come and fall into me  
Come and fall into me  
Baby fall into me
