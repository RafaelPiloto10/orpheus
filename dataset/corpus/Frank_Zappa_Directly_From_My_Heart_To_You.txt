Direct  
Directly from my heart to you  
Direct  
Directly from my heart to you  
Oh, you know that I love you  
That's why I feel so blue  
  
Oh, I pray  
Our love would last away  
I pray  
That our love would last away  
Yeah, we'd be so happy together  
But you're so far away  
  
Well, I need  
(Oh, baby, need you baby)  
I need you by my side  
Well, I need  
Yes, I need you by my side  
Oh, I'd loved you little darlin'  
Your love I could never hide
