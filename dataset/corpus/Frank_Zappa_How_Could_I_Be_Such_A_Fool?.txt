When I won your love  
I was very glad  
Every happiness in the world  
Belonged to me  
Then our love was lost  
And you went away  
Now I shed my tears  
In lonely misery  
  
I know now that you never ever  
Really loved me  
It hurts me now to think you never ever  
Really cared  
I sit and ask myself a thousand times  
To try and find  
What really happened  
To the love  
That we shared  
  
How could I be such a fool  
How could I believe  
All those lies you told me  
How could I be taken in  
By your sweet face  
You spoiled our love  
You ruined my life  
I'm so tore down  
I'm a terrible disgrace  
  
But there will come a time  
And you'll regret the way  
You treated me  
As if I was a fool  
And didn't know  
The many times you lied  
About your love for me  
Someone else is gonna know  
That your love was just a show  
  
How could I be such a fool?
