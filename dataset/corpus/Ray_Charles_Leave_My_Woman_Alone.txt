If you don't want, you don't have to (get in trouble)  
If you don't want, you don't have to (get in trouble)  
If you don't want, you don't have to (get in trouble)  
Say, you better leave my woman alone  
  
Well, I know you are a playboy  
And you've got women all over town  
But listen buddy if you ever sweet-talk my little girl  
I'm gonna lay your body down  
  
[Chorus]  
If you don't want, you don't have to (get in trouble)  
You know you don't want, oh yeah (get in trouble)  
If you don't want, you don't have to (get in trouble)  
(Say it) Oh, you better leave my woman alone  
  
Well I know you got your money  
And you've got a new fifty-six too  
But if I ever see my little girl in your new car  
I'm gonna do some work on you.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I don't believe in trouble  
So I don't want to start a fight  
So if you'll take heed and stay away from my little girl  
Then everything will be alright  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My woman alone  
My (woman alone)  
You better leave (woman alone)  
Better leave (woman alone)  
My woman alone (woman alone)  
I said (woman alone)  
I said (woman alone)  
I said (woman alone)  
You better leave (woman alone)  
You better leave (woman alone)  
You better leave (woman alone)  
My (woman alone)  
-I- (woman alone)  
-I- (woman alone)]  
My woman (woman alone)  
My woman alone (woman alone)  
Oh, now (woman alone)  
Oh, oo (woman alone)  
Oh yeah (woman alone)  
Oh yeah (woman alone)  
You better leave (woman alone)  
My woman alone (woman alone)  
  
If you don't want, you don't have to (get in trouble)  
If you don't want, you don't have to (get in trouble)  
If you don't want, you don't have to [get in trouble]  
(Say it) Yeah, you better leave my woman alone  
My woman alone  
My woman alone
