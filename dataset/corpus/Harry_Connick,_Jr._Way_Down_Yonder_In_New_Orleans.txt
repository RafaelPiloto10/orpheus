Way down yonder, in New Orleans  
In the land of the dreamy scenes  
It's a garden of Eden, you know what I mean  
  
Creole babies with lovin' eyes  
Softly whisper their tender sighs  
Stop, ya bet your life you'll linger there, a little while  
Stop, won't you give your lady fair, a little smile?  
  
It's the heaven right here on earth  
All the beautiful queens  
Way down yonder, in New Orleans  
  
Stop, won't you give your lady fair, a little smile?  
Stop, give lady fair, a little smile  
Oh!  
It's the heaven right here on earth  
All the beautiful queens  
Look out!  
Way down yonder, in New Orleans
