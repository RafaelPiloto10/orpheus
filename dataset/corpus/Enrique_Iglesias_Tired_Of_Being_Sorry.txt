I don't know why  
You want to follow me tonight  
When in the rest of the world  
With whom I've crossed and I've quarreled  
Let's me down so  
For a thousand reasons that I know  
To share forever the unrest  
With all the demons I possess  
Beneath the silver moon  
  
Maybe you were right  
But baby I was lonely  
I don't want to fight  
I'm tired of being sorry  
  
Eighth and Ocean Drive  
With all the vampires and their brides  
We're all bloodless and blind  
And longing for a life  
Beyond the silver moon  
  
Maybe you were right  
But baby I was lonely  
I don't want to fight  
I'm tired of being sorry  
  
I'm standing in the street  
Crying out for you  
No one sees me  
But the silver moon  
  
So far away  
So outer space  
I've trashed myself  
I've lost my way  
I've got to get to you, got to get to you  
  
Maybe you were right  
But baby I was lonely  
I don't want to fight  
I'm tired of being sorry  
  
I'm standing in the street  
Crying out for you  
No one sees me  
But the silver moon  
  
Maybe you were right  
But baby I was lonely  
I don't want to fight  
I'm tired of being sorry  
  
I'm standing in the street  
Crying out for you  
No one sees me  
But the silver moon
