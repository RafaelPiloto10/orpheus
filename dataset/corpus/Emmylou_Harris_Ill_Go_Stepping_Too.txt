Don't think that I'll be hangin' 'round while you're havin' fun  
I won't sit there cryin' over you  
Well from now on when you step out I'll tell you what I'll do  
I'll lock the door, put out the cat and I'll go steppin' too  
Yes I'll go steppin' too, my honey I'll go steppin' too  
I'll lock the door, put out the cat and I'll go steppin' too  
Now every time you come in late and we begin to fight  
You tell me there are more fish in the sea  
But the bait ain't what it used to be and I got news for you  
Now after this when you go out well I'll go steppin' too  
Yes I'll go steppin' too, my honey I'll go steppin' too  
I'll lock the door, put out the cat and I'll go steppin' too  
From now on when you come in and won't tell where you been  
With your hair messed up and your clothes don't fit you right  
Well I don't care if I find perfume on you too  
Well you will know that I have been steppin' just like you  
Yes I'll go steppin' too, my honey I'll go steppin' too  
I'll lock the door, put out the cat and I'll go steppin' too  
Yes I'll go steppin' too, my honey I'll go steppin' too  
I'll lock the door, put out the cat and I'll go steppin' too
