Love is a special thing  
It means more to me than just a wedding ring  
When two people join as one  
They don't know just what has begun  
  
It comes to love, honor, cherish and obey  
You promised, girl, that you would not go away  
  
When you gonna come back home, girl?  
You know I'm all alone, girl  
When you gonna come back home?  
When you gonna come back home, girl?  
You know I'm all alone, girl  
When you gonna come back home?  
  
[Lisa]  
Love is a precious thing  
So, can't you see the joy that it can bring?  
So, how can you be so cruel?  
You've gone and broken every rule  
  
You promised to love, honor, cherish and obey  
You promised me you'd never go away  
  
When you gonna stay at home, boy?  
You see I was alone, boy  
When you gonna stay at home?  
When you gonna stay at home, boy?  
You see I was alone, boy  
When you gonna stay at home?  
  
[Rick]  
Love's got a hold on me  
I need you, girl, can't you see?  
  
[Lisa]  
So, why don't we spend some time?  
Let's get together, maybe we could find...  
  
[Rick and Lisa]  
We've got to love, honor, cherish and obey  
We've got to promise that we'll never go away  
  
Never gonna leave you home, no  
Leave you all alone  
Now I'm gonna stay at home  
Never gonna be alone, no  
You see I should have known  
Never gonna leave you home  
  
Never gonna leave you home, no  
Leave you all alone  
Now I'm gonna stay at home  
Never gonna be alone, no  
You see I should have known  
Never gonna leave you home
