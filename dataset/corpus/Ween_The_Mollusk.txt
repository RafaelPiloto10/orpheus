Hey little boy, whatcha got there?  
Kind sir it's a mollusk i've found  
Did you find it in the sandy ground?  
Does it emulate the ocean's sound?  
Yes I found it on the ground  
Emulating the ocean's sound  
Bring forth the mollusk cast unto me  
Let's be forever let forever be free  
  
Hey little boy come walk with me  
And bring your new found mollusk along  
Does it speaketh of the trinity  
Can it gaze at the sun with its wandering eye  
Yes it speaks of the trinity  
Casting light at the sun with its wandering eye  
Bring forth the mollusk, cast unto me  
Let's be forever let forever be free  
  
You see there are three things that spur the mollusk from the sand  
The waking of all creatures that live on the land  
And with just one faint glance, back into the sea  
The mollusk lingers, with it's wandering eye
