I can take 'em all.  
So I leave you with this thought.  
There is a fire in the sky  
I don't need no alibi  
See I believe in all.  
  
Do you hear me when I say  
That I got to walk this way.  
There is a fire in the sky  
I don't need no alibi  
See I believe in all.  
  
[Chorus]  
And I-I-I will catch you when you fall  
That is what I'm gonna do.  
And I-I-I-I will catch you if you call  
That is what I'm gonna do.  
  
I can see for miles  
And I can see you when your cries.  
There is a fire in the sky  
I don't need no alibi  
See I believe in all.  
  
Do you hear me when I say  
That I gotta walk this way.  
There is a fire in the sky  
I don't need no alibi  
See I believe in all.  
  
And I-I-I will catch you when you fall  
That is what I'm gonna do.  
And I-I-I-I will catch you if you call  
That is what I'm gonna do.
