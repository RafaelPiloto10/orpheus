I got someone at home don't know what's going on  
  
Thinks I love her and her alone and the pressure is on  
  
I've got a new love you see she does new minds to me  
  
We sneak our love you's on the phone and the pressure is on  
  
And it puts pressure on a man if he ever lets his heart call his hand  
  
He ain't no rolling stone but the pressure is on  
  
[ fiddle - organ ]  
  
Feel like your ten thousand feet down under the sea  
  
And it's crushing all your bones and the pressure is on  
  
The trains I ride in my dreams run on the pressure of the steam  
  
Lord I could pull one a mile long cause the pressure is on  
  
Lord I could pull one a mile long cause the pressure is on  
  
The pressure is on the pressure at home
