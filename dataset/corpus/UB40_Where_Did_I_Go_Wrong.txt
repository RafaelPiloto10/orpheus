I'm sitting here praying that you weren't just saying  
Leaving tomorrow was what you had planned  
No point in pretending, I know that it's ending  
I just want to know where the ending began  
  
[Chorus:]  
Where did I go wrong to make it like this  
No warmth in your body, no touch in your kiss  
Holding you now, hurts more than it should  
If I let you go, girl, you'll be gone for good  
  
I thought you had saved me, the love that you gave me  
The sweetest loving in all of the land  
But you've taken my heart, and you've torn it apart  
And its crumbled to dust in the palm of your hand  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Where did I go wrong...(etc)  
There's nothin' worth sayin', I know you're not staying  
Might as well face it, it's out of my hand  
No point in pretending, I know that it's ending  
I just want to know where the ending began  
  
(chorus)  
Where did I go wrong........(etc)
