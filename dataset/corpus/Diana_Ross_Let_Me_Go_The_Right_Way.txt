Let me go right  
Let me go right  
Let me go right

That I done fell for you?  
I wanna know, baby  
Tell me whatcha gonna do  
You took my love, baby, all my love  
  
Don't lead me astray  
Let me go the right way  
  
My heart, baby is all weak for you  
So please be careful and treat me true  
'Cause you're my life, be a wife  
  
Don't lead me astray  
Let me go the right way

Where you lead me, where you lead me  
I'll follow you  
What you tell me, what you tell me  
That's what I'll do  
  
'Cause baby, I'm yours don't you know  
That I done fell for you?  
I wanna know, baby, whatcha gonna do  
You took my love, all my love

And wait for that odd day  
Please go right, go right, go right  
Hey won't you?
