I have found exceeding joy  
Jesus answered when I called  
This name that has saved me  
Pure love that embraced me  
Mercy, grace eternal life  
Brought from darkness to His light  
While lost in my sin He  
Raised me and made me live  
My soul magnifies the Lord  
My heart joys in God my Savior  
For He lifts the lowly  
He's done great things for me  
I will sing, praising evermore  
He is mighty and Holy is His name  
I will lift my head up high  
Praising Jesus through each trial  
Though I have not seen Him  
I love Him completely  
He is mighty, mighty  
He is mighty, mighty  
He is mighty, mighty  
He is mighty and holy is His name
