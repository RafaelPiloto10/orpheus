There is a white flag rising,  
About to catch the wind  
And I don't want to fight it,  
Or let you win  
Here I stand,  
Heart in hand  
No it ain't like me,  
Don't take it lightly  
You know I never bend  
  
[Chorus]  
Surrender  
I'm giving in, givin' up  
Surrender  
Crossing over the line for your love  
If I trust enough,  
Then I might just  
Fall in to forever  
And all I've got to do is surrender  
  
I see a white dove flyin,  
The clouds have rolled on past  
And isn't it surprising,  
I feel the peace at last  
Got all I need,  
Surroundin' me  
I'm not afraid to stand up and say,  
I will never leave  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
If I trust enough,  
Then I might just  
Fall into forever  
And all I've got to do,  
All I've got to do  
Baby, all I've got to do,  
Is surrender  
Oh surrender
