Come to me, lonely  
Come to me, blue  
Come to me, weary  
Come to me, do!  
Yeah, yeah  
  
I will refresh you  
Come to me, do  
Come to me, often  
I'll come to you  
I'll come to you  
  
Always in my heart  
Always a song  
This is the good part  
You'll always know where you belong  
  
Come to me, darling  
Ooh, baby  
Come to me, darling  
  
Come to me, happy  
Come to me, bad  
Come to me, looking  
What you ain't had  
  
I will sustain you  
Come to me, do  
Come to me, often  
I come to you  
I come to you  
  
You are the kind one  
I've waited so long  
How does one find one?  
You always know where you belong  
  
Come to me, darling  
Ooh, ooh, baby  
Come to me, darling  
  
Come to me, darling  
Come to me, darling  
Come to me, darling
