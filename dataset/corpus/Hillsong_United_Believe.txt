I say on Sunday how much I want revival  
But then on Monday, I can't even find my Bible  
Where's the power  
The power of the cross in my life  
  
I'm sick of playing the game of religion  
I'm tired of losing my reason for living  
Where's the power  
The power of the cross in my life  
  
I'm not content just to walk through my life, giving in  
To the lies, Walking in compromises now  
We cry out as a generation that was lost  
But now is found in the power of the cross  
  
Chorus:  
We believe in You  
We believe in the power of Your Word that is true  
We believe in You  
So we lay down our cause  
That our cross might be found in You  
  
I'm not satisfied doing it my own way  
I'm not satisfied to do church and walk away  
I'm not satisfied there's no love in my life but You  
I'm not satisfied living in yesterday's hour  
I'm not satisfied to have the form but not the power  
I'm not satisfied, Lord I am crucified in You  
[Chorus:]  
  
So we lay down our cause  
That our cross might be found in You
