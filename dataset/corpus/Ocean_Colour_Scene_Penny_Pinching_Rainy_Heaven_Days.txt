Every morning traffic  
Every night I've had enough  
Every day compromise  
Life's no surprise after much  
  
[Chorus:]  
Someday people lock themselves away  
Saving up for another empty...  
Penny pinching rainy heaven day  
  
No-one talks at night  
They scream and fight and say too much  
My wife dreams all day  
My life says it has heard enough  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Laa, rainy heaven days  
Laa, rainy heaven days  
  
[Chorus]  
  
La la la la la la la...  
Laa, rainy heaven days  
Laa, rainy heaven days  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Rainy heaven days [Repeat x 6]
