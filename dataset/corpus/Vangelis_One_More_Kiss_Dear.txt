One more kiss, dear, one more sigh  
Only this dear, is goodbye  
For our love is such pain and such pleasure  
That I'll treasure till I die  
So for now dear, au revoir ma belle  
But I bow dear, not farewell  
For in time we may have a love's glory  
Our love story to tell  
Just as every autumn leaves fall from the tree  
Tumble to the ground and die  
So in the springtime like sweet memories  
They will return as will I  
Like the sun dear, upon high  
We'll return dear, to the sky  
And we'll banish the pain and the sorrow  
Until tomorrow, goodbye  
One more kiss dear, one more sigh  
Only this dear, is goodbye  
For our love is such passion, such pleasure  
I will treasure until till I die  
Like the sun dear, upon high  
We'll return dear, to the sky  
And we'll banish the pain and the sorrow  
Until tomorrow, goodbye
