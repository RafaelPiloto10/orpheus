There's a kind of hush all over the world, tonight  
All over the world, you can hear the sounds of lovers in love  
You know what I mean, just the two of us and nobody else concerned  
There's nobody else and I'm feeling good, holding you tight  
  
So listen very carefully  
Closer now and you will see what I mean, it isn't a dream  
The only sound that you will hear  
Is when I whisper in your ear, "I love you, forever and ever"  
  
There's a kind of hush all over the world, tonight  
All over the world, people just like us are falling in love  
  
So listen very carefully  
Closer now and you will see what I mean, no no, it isn't a dream  
The only sound that you will hear  
Is when I whisper in your ear, "I love you, forever and ever"  
  
There's a kind of hush all over the world, tonight  
All over the world, people just like us are falling in love  
Are falling in love, falling in love
