Last night i had a dream  
A vision in the dark,  
I found that i had been across the desert space,  
Saw all the people behind a naked face.  
  
I held out my hand,  
Hoping you'd be there.  
I could not understand all the reasons why  
Faces from the past looking me in the eye.  
  
Now the light has come  
Breaking form the east  
Someday we can find somewhere  
To rest in peace.  
  
I lost my control,  
In a nightmare of being  
Just a lonely soul  
Without a hanging cross,  
Standing all alone  
Watching the lightning flash.
