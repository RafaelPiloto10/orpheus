The mysterious fox of Fox Hollow  
He doesn't have many friends  
He hides in the forest behind a big rock  
He sniffs with his nose in the wind  
And you'll never see him, there's no need to look  
He'll hide in the grass or he'll hide in the bush  
Sometimes he will run and jump over the log  
For he is afraid of your dog  
The mysterious fox of Fox Hollow  
He plays with a foxy old bunch  
He comes out at night to steal chickens  
And someday he might eat your lunch  
You'll never see him, there's no need to look  
He'll hide in the grass or he'll hide in the bush  
Sometimes he will run and jump over the log  
For he is afraid of your dog  
The mysterious fox of Fox Hollow  
You ask me how I know  
Though I never have seen him one day at the barn  
I saw his tracks in the snow, four of them  
And you'll never see him, there's no need to look  
He'll hide in the grass or he'll hide in the bush  
Sometimes he will run and jump over the log  
For he is afraid of your dog
