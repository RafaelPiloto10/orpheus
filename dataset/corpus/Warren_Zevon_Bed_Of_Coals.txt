I've been lying on a bed of coals  
I've been crying out of control  
I roll and I tumble  
Every time I come down  
  
I'm too old to die young  
And too young to die now  
I've been sleeping on a bed of nails  
I've been bleeding, it never fails  
  
I feel every needle  
That pierced through my heart  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm too old to die young  
And I can't play the part  
Bed of coals  
Bed of nails  
Through the smoke  
Behind the veils  
Bed of coals  
Bed of nails  
Through the smoke  
Behind the veils  
  
I've been lying in a bed of shame  
I've been dying all alone  
I pray for the power  
To turn it around  
  
[Chorus]
