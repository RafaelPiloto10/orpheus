I knew the day that I would stand by you and all your  
Failings  
Now I'm looking out for me  
If you want to split then I won't tell a soul about you  
Darling just you wait and you'll see.  
  
You might need a man  
I might just be the man you need  
You might need a man like me  
You might need a man  
I might just be the man you need  
You might need a man like me.  
  
I never thought I'd see the day you'd ever try to leave  
Me  
Now you've packed your bags and you've gone  
All the money in the world won't help you darling  
Take a look and see what you've done.  
  
You might need a man  
I might just be the man you need  
You might need a man like me  
You might need a man  
I might just be the man you need  
You might need a man like me.  
  
You might need a man  
I might just be the man you need  
You might need a man like me  
You might need a man  
I might just be the man you need  
You might need a man like me.  
  
And though the craziness of city life surrounds you  
Darling  
Just because you follow every trend  
Come the day you find yourself alone and feeling  
Restless  
That's the day you're going to need a friend.  
  
You might need a man  
I might just be the man you need  
You might need a man like me  
You might need a man  
I might just be the man you need  
You might need a man like me.  
  
You might need a man  
I might just be the man you need  
You might need a man like me  
You might need a man  
I might just be the man you need  
You might need a man like me.  
  
You might need a man, mmm  
Ah let me be your man  
You might need a man like me  
I wanna be that man  
You might need a man like me  
Oh let me be your man.  
  
You might need a man  
I might just be the man you need  
You might need a man like me  
You might need a man  
I might just be the man you need  
You might need a man like me.
