See I was once told  
That I would litterate gold  
Now I'm at the crossroads  
Selling my soul  
I've been laughed at  
Slepped on and stepped on  
Backstabbed twice but I always kept on  
  
I'm falling  
And I can hear my conscience calling  
I see my life dissolving  
While I'm one stallin  
Why life's gotta be this way  
It's the price we pay  
Just to live another day  
  
Get yourself up, you're falling  
Gotta get yourself up, get up, don't stop, you're falling  
  
She saw life's a bitch but I love her  
Brother never judge a book by the cover  
Same name but different faces  
Same case but different places  
Life's strange  
Joy, pain  
Sunshine, rain  
Yo we've gotta maintain  
Why life gotta be this way  
It's the price we pay just to see another day  
  
Get yourself up, you're falling  
Gotta get yourself up, get up, don't stop, you're falling (falling, falling,
falling)  
  
You're living on a lie  
Better realize you're falling down  
You're living on a lie  
Better get yourself together now  
Better get up from the ground  
You're living on a lie (lie, lie, lie)  
You're living on a lie (lie, lie, lie)  
  
It spill blood, sweat and tears  
I crept on my knees  
And begged for deaf ears  
I wouldn't learn  
Until I got burned  
Every laugh was changed  
That was the day it got turned  
Lifes Strange somebody wants me to obtain  
Some people change, others stay the same  
Why life's gotta be this way  
See it's the price we pay just to live another day  
  
Get yourself up you're falling  
Gotta get yourself up, get up, don't stop, you're falling (falling, falling,
falling)  
  
You're living on a lie  
Better realize you're falling down  
You're living on a lie  
Better get yourself together now  
Better get up from the ground  
You're living on a lie  
Better realize you're falling down  
You're living on a lie  
Better get yourself together now  
Better get up from the ground  
You're living on a lie  
Better get yourself together now  
Better get up from the ground  
  
You're livin on a lie (lie, lie, lie, lie)  
You're livin on a lie (lie, lie, lie, lie)  
You're livin on a lie (lie, lie, lie, lie)  
  
Get yourself up, you're falling  
Gotta get yourself up get up, don't stop, you're falling  
Get yourself up you're falling  
Gotta get yourself up, get up, don't stop, you're falling  
  
You're living on a lie
