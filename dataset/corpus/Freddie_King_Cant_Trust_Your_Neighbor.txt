Hit me in the the eye, maybe I can see better  
I lost the only girl I ever loved, now I got to forget her  
Let me tell you, I found out, oh baby I found out  
That you can't you can't you can't  
Trust your neighbor with your, baby  
A friend of mine how'd a lived next door  
You know that friend of mine, he don't live there no more  
My baby use to go all out for salt  
But I found out he was giving her sugar  
I trust him with my baby, the dirty dog, he took her  
They said she warns the neighbors that she have him to do you  
But my neighbor didn't even have a woman to talk to  
That's why, that's, why that's why you can't  
Trust your neighbor with your baby  
Oh, how I loved the girl, in my heart I still do  
Let me tell you, when your neighbor get her  
He don't leave to much of you  
Let me tell you, I found out, I found out  
Can you hear me?  
Come on and listen to me now  
I found out alright  
Let me say it just one more time now y'all  
Let me tell you  
Let me tell you can't, let me tell you can't  
Let me tell you can't, you can't you can't  
That you can't you can't you can't  
Trust your neighbor with your baby
