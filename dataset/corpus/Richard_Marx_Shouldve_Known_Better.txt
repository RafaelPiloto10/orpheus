Another sleepless night I can't explain  
Somebody said they heard me call your name  
The radio won't let you leave my mind  
I know it's over but I don't know why  
  
[Chorus]  
Should've known better  
Than to fall in love with you  
Now love is just a faded memory  
Should've known better  
Now I'm a prisoner to this pain  
And my heart still aches for you  
  
There was no risk that I wouldn't take  
And not a promise that I didn't make  
All I asked was that you just hold on  
And now I'm wondering what I did wrong  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I gave you all of my body and soul  
Never believing we might lose control  
I took my hands off the wheel  
  
I can't remember if the lies were true  
It's been a million years since I touched you  
I thought time might help me win this game  
But being away from you is slowly driving me insane  
  
[Chorus]
