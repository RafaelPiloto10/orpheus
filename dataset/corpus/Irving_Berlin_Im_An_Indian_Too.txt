Like the Seminole, Navajo, Kickapoo  
Like those Indians  
I'm an Indian too  
A Sioux  
A Sioux  
Just like Battle Axe, Hatchet Face, Eagle Nose  
Like those Indians  
I'm an Indian too  
A Sioux  
A Sioux  
Some Indian summer's day  
Without a sound  
I may hide away  
With Big Chief Hole-in-the-Ground  
And I'll have totem poles, tomahawks, pipes of peace  
Which will go to prove  
I'm an Indian too  
A Sioux  
A Sioux  
With my chief in his teepee  
We'll raise an Indian family  
And I'll be busy night and day  
Looking like a flour sack  
With two papooses on my back  
And three papooses on the way  
Like the Chippewa, Iroquois, Omaha  
Like those Indians  
I'm an Indian too  
A Sioux  
A Sioux  
Just like Rising Moon, Falling Pants, Running Nose  
Like those Indians  
I'm an Indian too  
A Sioux  
A Sioux  
Some Indian summer's day  
Without a care  
I may run away  
With Big Chief Son-of-a-Bear  
And I'll wear moccasins, wampum beads, feather hats  
Which will go to prove  
I'm an Indian too  
A Sioux  
A Sioux
