Listen  
I may be wrong but you're missing  
There's something wrong you could say  
Ruined in a day  
You could be the lover of jade  
Forever on your own in the shade  
Let's do it anyway  
  
Some people like to deceive you  
While others may feel that they need you  
While I do the best that I can  
Keeping my life in my hands  
  
And if you feel  
Your cradle rocking  
Then take the wheel  
Don't let me stop you  
(Hang around for awhile)  
But stop acting like a child  
Every step we take is the one  
That's gonna undo what you've done  
It could take all day  
  
Some people like to deceive you  
While others may feel that they need you  
But I do the best that I can  
I keep my world in my hands  
  
Some people like to deceive you  
While others may feel that they need you  
But I do the best that I can  
Keeping my world in my hands
