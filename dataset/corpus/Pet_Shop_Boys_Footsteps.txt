Footsteps in the dark  
Only love will break your heart  
Footsteps, footsteps  
  
Whenever trouble  
Comes around  
Or lonely nights lead  
Underground  
  
And far in the dark  
Abandoned cars suddenly  
Start up  
An anxious sound  
  
As long as I hear your  
Footsteps in the dark  
That's all I need  
  
Footsteps in the dark  
Only love will break your heart  
Footsteps, footsteps  
  
When loneliness induces fear  
Like waves against a  
Ramshackle pier  
When thunder and rain  
  
Scar the windowpane  
Once again  
I want you near  
As long as I hear your  
Footsteps in the dark  
That's all I need  
  
I'm longing to see you  
I want you, I need you  
  
Like a child who feels afraid  
Of the dark at night  
Hoping to hear a gentle touch  
Turning on a welcome light  
  
As long as I hear your  
Footsteps in the dark  
That's all I need  
As long as I hear your  
Footsteps in the dark  
That's all I need  
  
Footsteps in the dark  
Only love will break your heart  
Footsteps, footsteps  
Footsteps in the dark  
Only love will break your heart  
Footsteps, footsteps
