I'd like to take you home girl, and make you mine.  
I'd get you all alone girl, and take my time.  
Think how you feel in your heart when you climb to the top of,  
Of a big roller coaster ride.  
  
You're gettin' high on desire worth waitin'  
On the other side.  
I'd like to treat you nice girl, and treat you mean.  
I'd get you on your own girl, and fill your dreams.  
  
Think how you feel in your heart when you get to the fall,  
Of a big roller coaster ride.  
That's how it is and the way that it would be  
If you come with me.  
  
Blue satin pillow,  
Black satin silhou-  
Ette on the window  
Shade of the night.  
  
Soft light a glowin'  
Sweet night a goin'  
Out like the candle's  
Flickerin' light  
  
You know by now its your love that I'm after  
And I don' want no alibi.  
There's just no need to take no for an answer,  
Yes is in your eyes.  
  
I'd like to take you home girl, and make you mine.  
I'd get you all alone girl, and take my time.  
I'd like to treat you nice girl, and treat you mean.
