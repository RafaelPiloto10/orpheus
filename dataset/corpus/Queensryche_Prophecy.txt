Wings of fire, are sailing past the pint of no return  
Blinding eyes, from which it hides the key  
Seek to rise, begotten are the fools who'll never know  
Force will hide the presence that we see  
  
There's no time to run away  
A prophecy will make its stay  
  
Course of rage, a never ending fight for the unknown  
To justify the formulated scheme  
So we find a gleaming light to lead us far beyond  
The closing gates of our society  
  
There's no time to run away  
A prophecy will make its stay
