I've been waiting, goin' crazy  
I can't sleep when I know you're not around  
I've been saving what you're cravin'  
Look at my face I'm about to replace  
Every hurt, every tear that you cry  
  
Cause when you feel this strong and you can't go on  
There's nothing wrong, just try to realize  
  
You won't ever have to say goodbye  
You won't ever have to say "I've wasted all my time"  
If the dream you dream ain't what it seems  
Just look into my eyes  
You won't ever have to say goodbye  
  
I'm just praying, you hear me saying  
I'd be there if the sun refused to shine  
As the night gets colder I will be your shoulder  
I give you my heart until death us do part  
Every day, every moment, forever  
  
Cause when the love is strong the feeling's never gone  
There's nothing wrong in trying to realize  
  
You won't ever have to say goodbye  
You won't ever have to say "I've wasted all my time"  
If the dream you dream ain't what it seems  
Just look into my eyes  
You won't ever have to say goodbye  
  
Cause when your feeling's strong and you can't go on  
There's nothing wrong, just try to realize  
  
You won't ever have to say goodbye  
You won't ever have to say "I've wasted all my time"  
If the dream you dream ain't what it seems  
Just look into my eyes  
You won't ever have to say goodbye
