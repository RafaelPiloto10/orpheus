[Simon Climie, Holly Knight]  
This bloody road remains a mystery, this sudden darkness fills the air  
What're we waitin' for? Won't anybody help us, what're we waitin' for?  
  
[Chorus]  
We can't afford to be innocent, stand up and face the enemy  
It's a do or die situation, we will be invincible  
  
This shattered dream you cannot justify  
We're gonna scream until we're satisfied  
What're we runnin' for? We've got the right to be angry  
What're we runnin' for, when there's nowhere we can run to anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And with the power of conviction, there is no sacrifice  
It's a do or die situation, we will be invincible  
  
Won't anybody help us, what're we runnin' for  
When there's nowhere, nowhere we can run to anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And with the power of conviction, there is no sacrifice  
It's a do or die situation, we will be invincible  
  
[Repeat Chorus]
