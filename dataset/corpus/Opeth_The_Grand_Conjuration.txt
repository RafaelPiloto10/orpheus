Majesty  
Faithful me  
Pour yourself  
Into me  
  
Wield your power  
Martyr's price  
Stare me down  
To the ground  
  
Slake my thirst  
Eternal wealth  
Heathen key  
Round my neck  
  
This poetry  
Our blasphemy  
Know the sounds  
Of infamy  
  
The eyes of the devil  
Fixed on his sinners  
  
The hands of Satan  
Assembling his flock  
Pale horse rider  
Searching the earth  
  
Whispered conjuration  
A belief takes form  
Choking hand tapping  
The veins in your throat  
  
His orders in your mouth  
A decree for domination  
Beneath the tides of wisdom  
Spins the undertow of hate  
  
Injected seeds of vengeance  
Usurper's eyes of the powerless  
Clean path to his kingdom  
Beckoning in the mist  
  
Tell my why  
Love subsides  
In the light  
Of your wishes  
  
Say my name  
Ease the pain  
Clear the smoke  
In my head
