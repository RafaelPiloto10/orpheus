I'm going steady with iron ore betty  
And she's goin' steady with me  
We receive our mail in the same mailbox  
And we watch the same tv  
I got rug burns on my elbows  
She's got 'em on her knees  
Yeah, I'm goin' steady with iron ore betty  
And she's going steady with me.  
Hey, I been pickin' my brains out  
I been workin' at the hardware store  
I been trying to put a chicken in the window  
Chase away the wolf from the door  
Betty's been down in the iron ore mine  
Bringing home energy  
Yeah, I'm goin' steady with iron ore betty  
And she's goin' steady with me.  
I been speaking to her in english  
She's been speakin' in the english too  
We always speak the same language  
'cause we're always gettin' through  
I met her at a dance at the union hall  
It was a night with daddy g.  
Yeah, I'm goin' steady with iron ore betty  
And she's goin' steady with me.
