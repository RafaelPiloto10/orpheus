Jostle, hassle, elbow bustle  
In a swirling rainbow tussle  
Caught and frozen, broken sheen  
Now unites for one brief scene  
  
Lonely in the dark I grope  
The key's in my kaleidoscope  
  
Confused faces change their places  
Take up stances, exchange glances  
Lost in multicolored hues  
There is no whole which I can choose  
  
Lonely in the dark I grope  
The key's in my kaleidoscope  
  
In one face, one moment's fusion  
Realize the new illusion  
Clutching fingers break the puzzle  
Jostle, hassle, elbow bustle  
  
Still out in the dark I grope  
The key's in my kaleidoscope
