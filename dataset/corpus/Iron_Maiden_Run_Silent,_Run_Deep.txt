The convoy lights are dead ahead  
The merchantmen lay in their bed  
The thump of diesels hammers down  
In the oily sea-the killing ground  
His knuckles white his eyes alight  
He slams the hatch on the deadly night  
A cunning fox in the chickens lair  
A hound of hell and the devil don't care  
  
[Chorus]  
Running silent, running deep, we are your final prayer  
Warriors in secret sleep, a merchantman's nightmare  
A silent death lies awaiting, for all of you below  
Running silent, running deep, sink into your silent sleep  
  
Chill the hearts of fighting men  
In open ocean wondering when?  
The lethal silver fish will fly  
The boat will shiver-men will die  
A cast of millions-a part to play  
Killer victim or fool for a day  
Obeying an order-men have to die  
Us or them-a well rehearsed lie  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The lifeboats shattered the hull is torn  
The tar black smell of burning oil  
On the way down to Davy Jones  
Every man for himself-you're on your own  
The wolf eyes watch the cross wire  
'stern tubes ready', 'aim and fire
