Earth to Bella  
You think you've got it all figured in  
Earth to Bella  
Everything you know is wrong (well almost)  
Earth to Bella  
I see where you are not listening  
I bear the burden of being the voice that let's you know  
We all grow old  
And before you swim you've gotta be okay to sail  
  
Earth to Bella  
The world can be an unfriendly place  
So hold your head up  
And do your best to save some face  
It's not so hard  
Just undo yourself and see your second sun  
Escape  
  
Okay to sing  
I'm okay to sing  
I'm okay to sing  
I'm okay to sing  
  
Earth to Bella  
I sense a quiet emergency  
Earth to Bella  
There's so much more to get, they're wrong  
  
Earth to Bella  
Wading water successfully  
Or are you really?  
Don't you want to see the deep?  
It's not so hard.  
Just forgive yourself and  
Feel the water over you.
