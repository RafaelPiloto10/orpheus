Your life laid down, crucified.  
Your arms stretched out and open wide.  
To rescue me so I can be a child of God.  
  
From nail pierced hands and thorn pierced brow  
Your blood flows down to me somehow.  
It cleanses me so I can be a child of God.  
  
Praise to the lamb that was slain  
Praise to the Father who gave His son away  
  
The proof of love, the price of grace  
You traded all to take my place  
And died for me so I can be a child of God  
  
Praise to the lamb that was slain  
Praise to the Father who gave His son away
