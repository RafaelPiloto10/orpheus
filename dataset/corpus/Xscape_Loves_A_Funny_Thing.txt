Love's a funny thing  
  
Was only last night I felt you slip away,  
I tried so hard to hide the pain inside of me babe.  
I held you close but you weren't with me,  
I felt your mind a thousand miles away.  
  
I was a fool to let you break me down,  
You think by now that I would know,  
Just what to expect from you, oh.  
Everytime I fall, I make myself believe,  
That you are changing,  
And some day, the sun will shine through.  
  
Love is a funny thing,  
Your love is a funny thing,  
Love is a funny thing,  
Oooh.  
  
(I don't wanna fall, don't wanna fall in love again)  
  
When I first met you your heart was empty,  
You were innocent and so full of joy.  
But now you've changed and I don't know you,  
You played me baby like a toy.  
  
You see, I was surprised to see you with that girl,  
When you said you'd never ever ever ever see her again, no.  
I don't want to control you, so baby if she's gonna hold you,  
Then why don't you just stay, stay where you've been.  
  
Love is a funny thing,  
Your love is a funny thing,  
Love is a funny thing,  
Oooh.  
  
(I never never wanna fall again, no no no)  
  
Everybody needs someone to hold them through the night,  
And everybody needs someone to tell them it's alright.  
I gave you my heart and you only turned away,  
So tell me baby, what's going to make you stay.  
  
Love is a funny thing,  
Your love is a funny thing,  
Love is a funny thing,  
Oooh.  
  
(I never ever want to fall in love again)
