In a perfect world, in another time  
In a far off place we wouldn't need to justify  
Everything we are  
And all that we believe  
We could finally be  
Whoever we both want to be  
And when we can't be heard,  
And when we can't be seen  
I will call you close and  
You will reach for me  
  
[Chorus]  
When all of the beauty turns to pain  
When all of the madness falls like rain  
As long as we crash and we collide  
We will be gorgeous, you and I  
  
Through the window pane,  
Through the bedroom door  
This city wants to fight  
But it can't touch us anymore  
We have come so far,  
We have shed our skin  
The more that's taken from us now,  
The more we have to give  
And when we can't be heard,  
And when we can't be seen  
I will call you close and  
You will reach for me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And when we are drowning in the noise  
I'm gonna stop to hear your voice  
As long as we crash and we collide  
We will be gorgeous, you and I  
  
(We'll be gorgeous)  
(We'll be gorgeous)  
In the perfect time  
(We'll be gorgeous)  
  
And when we lose our faith  
In all that's beautiful  
You lift me to this place  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And when we are drowning in the noise  
I'm gonna stop to find your voice  
As long as we crash and we collide  
We will be gorgeous, we will be gorgeous  
(you and I)  
  
And when I lose my faith  
I don't know what to do  
You lift me to this place  
And make me feel so beautiful  
As long as you're right here by my side  
We will be gorgeous, you and I
