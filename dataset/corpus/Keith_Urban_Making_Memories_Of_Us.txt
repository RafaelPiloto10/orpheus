I'm gonna be here for you baby  
I'll be a man of my word  
Speak the language in a voice that you have never heard  
I wanna sleep with you forever  
And I wanna die in your arms  
In a cabin by a meadow where the wild bees swarm  
  
And I'm gonna love you like nobody loves you  
And I'll earn your trust making memories of us  
  
I wanna honor your mother  
And I wanna learn from your pa  
I wanna steal your attention like a bad outlaw  
I wanna stand out in a crowd for you  
A man among men  
I wanna make your world better than it's ever been  
  
And I'm gonna love you like nobody loves you  
And I'll earn your trust making memories of us  
  
We'll follow the rainbow  
Wherever the four winds blow  
And there'll be a new day  
Comin' your way  
  
I'm gonna be here for you from now on  
This you know somehow  
You've been stretched to the limits but it's alright now  
And I'm gonna make you a promise  
If there's life after this  
I'm gonna be there to meet you with a warm, wet kiss  
  
And I'm gonna love you like nobody loves you  
And I'll earn your trust making memories of us  
I'm gonna love you like nobody loves you  
And I'll win your trust making memories of us
