My heart was broken, my heart was broken  
Sorrow Sorrow Sorrow Sorrow  
My heart was broken, my heart was broken  
  
You saw it,  
You claimed it  
You touched it,  
You saved it  
  
My tears are drying, my tears are drying  
Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you  
My tears are drying, my tears are drying  
  
Your beauty and kindness  
Made tears clear my blindness  
While I'm worth my room on this earth  
I will be with you  
  
While the Chief, puts Sunshine On Leith  
I'll thank him for his work  
And your birth and my birth.
