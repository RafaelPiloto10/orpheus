We all have a weakness  
But some of ours are easy to identify  
Look me in the eye  
And ask for forgiveness  
We'll make a pact to never speak that word again  
Yes, you are my friend  
We all have something that digs at us  
At least we dig each other  
  
So when weakness turns my ego up  
I know you'll count on the me from yesterday  
  
If I turn into another  
Dig me up from under what is covering  
The better part of me  
Sing this song  
Remind me that we'll always have each other  
When everything else is gone  
  
We all have a sickness  
That cleverly attaches and multiplies  
No matter how we try  
We all have someone that digs at us  
At least we dig each other  
  
So when sickness turns my ego up  
I know you'll act as a clever medicine  
  
If I turn into another  
Dig me up from under what is covering  
The better part of me  
Sing this song  
Remind me that we'll always have each other  
When everything else is gone  
Oh, each other when everything else is gone  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
If I turn into another  
Dig me up from under what is covering  
The better part of me  
Sing this song  
Remind me that we'll always have each other  
When everything else is gone  
Oh, each other when everything else is gone  
Oh, each other when everything else is gone
