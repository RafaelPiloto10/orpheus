I'm scared to sleep, I'm scared to dream  
I'm scared to wake up in case I scream  
I'm scared to whisper one word  
That's all it needs  
  
I hear it breathe, I hear it sigh  
I hear it laughing when something dies  
I hear it calling  
But I'm too scared to move  
  
I'm so scared  
I can't breathe  
I'm so scared  
I can't breath  
I'm so scared  
I just can't breathe  
  
I'm scared to look, I'm scared to see  
I'm scared of mirrors in case it's me  
I'm scared of memories  
But now that's all I have  
  
So I can't leave and nothing comes  
So no-one noticed that I've come undone  
I'd hide in shadows  
But the shadows talk to me  
  
I'm so scared  
I can't breathe  
I'm so scared  
I can't breath  
I'm so scared  
I just can't breathe
