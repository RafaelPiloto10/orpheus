[Bridge]  
Keep your hands on me. Don't take them off until I say so.  
Let me break you off.  
We'll be taking off or maybe making love.  
You just keep your eyes on my you know what.  
  
[Verse 1]  
Trembling, when you touch.  
Rush is racing. Body baking.  
Picture me and you making.  
Making sweet love.  
Baby give it to me.  
  
[Hook]  
Eyes on me, Dance on me tonight  
Your all, All on me  
Keep your hands me.  
  
[Chorus]  
(Don't take them off.)  
Put your hands on it (8x)  
(Don't take them off.)  
Put your hands on me.  
You can put your hands on me.  
If You like what you see.  
Baby put your hands on me.  
It's your birthday. Everyday with me. And I make her hand rocky asap.(2x)  
  
[Verse 2]  
Skirt off keep the high heels on.  
Might be a little thing but I like that long yeah.  
Don't let these eyes fool you.  
I can't take it, hold nothing back, give it to me.  
  
[Hook]  
Eyes on me, Dance on me tonight  
Your all, All on me  
Keep your hands me.  
  
[Chorus]  
(Don't take them off.)  
Put your hands on it (8x)  
(Don't take them off.)  
Put your hands on me.  
You can pit your hands on me.  
If You like what you see.  
Baby put your hands on me.  
It's your birthday. Everyday with me. And I make her hand rocky asap.(2x)  
  
[Rap]  
Can I, Can I, Can I please put my hand on it?  
Shaking like they're burning, lemme put a fan on it.  
Bumblebee got a parachute to land on it.  
Cause you got the cake, can I put my candle on it?  
It's your birthday. Everyday with me.  
And I make her hand rocky asap.  
Got me talking marriage.  
I like what I see.  
I might put a ring on it.  
Work A B And Jay-Z.  
But before I do that let me put a hand on it.  
Oh so hot I could catch a tan on it.  
Got me sweating so much we can swim on the dancefloor.  
We gonna have to mess around and put a damn on it, damn on it.  
  
[Bridge]  
My lover why...  
Stay back and keep it  
Your hands on me  
And...  
  
[Chorus]  
(Don't take them off.)  
Put your hands on it (8x)  
(Don't take them off.)  
Put your hands on me.  
You can pit your hands on me.  
If You like what you see.  
Baby put your hands on me.
