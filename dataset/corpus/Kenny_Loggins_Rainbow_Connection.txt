Why are there so many  
Songs about rainbows  
And what's on the other side  
Rainbow's are visions  
They're only illusions  
And rainbows have nothing to hide  
So we've been told and some chose to  
Believe it  
But I know they're wrong wait and see  
  
Someday we'll find it  
The Rainbow Connection  
The lovers, the dreamers and me  
  
Who said that every wish  
Would be heard and answered  
When wished on the morning star  
Somebody thought of that  
And someone believed it  
And look what it's done so far  
What's so amazing  
That keeps us star gazing  
What so we think we might see  
  
Someday we'll find it  
That Rainbow Connection  
The lovers the dreamers and me  
  
Have you been half asleep  
And have you heard voices  
I've heard them calling my name  
Are these the sweet sounds that called  
The young sailors  
I think they're one and the same  
I've heard it too many times to ignore it  
There's something that I'm supposed to be  
  
Someday we'll find it  
The Rainbow Connection  
The lovers, the dreamers and me
