Been beat up and battered 'round  
Been sent up, and I've been shot down  
You're the best thing that I've ever found  
Handle me with care  
  
Reputations changeable  
Situations tolerable  
Baby, you're adorable  
Handle me with care  
  
I'm so tired of being lonely  
I still have some love to give  
Won't you show me that you really care  
  
Everybody's got somebody to lean on  
Put your body next to mine, and dream on  
  
I've been fobbed off, and I've been fooled  
I've been robbed and ridiculed  
In day care centers and night schools  
Handle me with care  
  
Been stuck in airports, terrorized  
Sent to meetings, hypnotized  
Overexposed, commercialized  
Hand me with care  
  
I'm so tired of being lonely  
I still have some love to give  
Won't you show me that you really care  
  
Everybody's got somebody to lean on  
Put your body next to mine, and dream on  
  
I've been uptight and made a mess  
But I'll clean it up myself, I guess  
Oh, the sweet smell of success  
Handle me with care
