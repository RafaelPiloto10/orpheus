Oh you're all looking up  
With hearts of devotion  
Through the dust and the heat lost to me  
In a cloud of emotion  
I have no motivation  
To keep this breathless pace  
I'm more inclined to stay here  
In this breathing space  
  
And the sun goes down  
And the moon comes up  
  
I never tried to walk the walk  
Cause the steps are elusive  
The membership is too costly  
And exclusive  
Hey, the more I've got  
The more I stand to lose  
So I'm gonna unpack my bags  
And take off my shoes  
  
And the sun goes down  
And the moon comes up  
  
Let me tell you there's no point knocking  
At the big oak door  
Can't you see that it's all full up  
They can't take no more  
The line's so long  
It's almost Disney  
Ooh?  
Won't somebody kiss me  
  
And the sun goes down  
And the moon comes up
