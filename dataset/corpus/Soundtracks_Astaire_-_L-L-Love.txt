Flirting with disaster  
You're the one I'm after  
Think I found my destiny  
Luxury and danger  
Rapture me my stranger  
Hold me close, don't let me be  
  
I could fly on the wings of my heart  
Deep inside, I've been falling apart  
L-L-Love, There's a magic in you  
And I'll be under your spell, L-L-Love  
  
Crezy, hazy feeling  
You're the thief I'm stealing  
Locked you up and lost the key  
Flying on the wings,  
Flying on the wings,  
Flying on the wings of my heart  
  
I could fly on the wings of my heart  
Deep inside, I've been falling apart  
L-L-Love, There's a magic in you  
And I'll be under your spell, L-L-Love  
  
Need your touch, it's what I'm after  
Fatal kiss, your embrace  
You got me baby, You've got me baby  
Fatal kiss, your embrace  
  
I could fly on the wings of my heart  
Deep inside, I've been falling apart  
L-L-Love, There's a magic in you  
And I'll be under your spell,  
I could fly on the wings of my heart  
Deep inside, I've been falling apart  
L-L-Love, There's a magic in you  
And I'll be under your spell, L-L-love  
L-L-Love, L-L-Love, L-L-Love...
