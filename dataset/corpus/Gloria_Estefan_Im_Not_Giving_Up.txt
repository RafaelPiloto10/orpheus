To be completely honest  
It scares me to imagine  
What life would be without you  
  
And for this very reason  
I ask you to forgive me  
For what I'm putting us through  
  
Although there are so many things  
Against us, I've decided  
That I'm not giving you up, no  
  
Thinking back, I see what we have  
Is something different  
I think we've known all along  
So how fair would it be  
To divide this love's existence  
Between what's right and what's wrong  
  
And you, always wondering if we'll make it  
Time will tell you  
That I'm not giving you up, no, no  
  
We'll find a way to be together  
However long it takes, wherever  
If it means having you for only a moment  
A moment just might be enough  
I'm not giving you up, no  
No I'm not giving you up, no  
  
Screaming in the silence the promises we've spoken  
Come back to haunt me, false and broken  
Quiet desperation to see we're lost forever  
Searching for water in the desert  
  
No, I refuse to have to do  
Without your kisses  
I'm not giving you up, no, no  
  
We'll find a way to be together  
However long it takes, wherever  
If it means having you for only a moment  
A moment just might be enough  
I'm not giving you up, no  
  
No I'm not giving you up, no  
No I'm not giving you up
