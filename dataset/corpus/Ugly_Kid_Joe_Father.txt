Beat me down, one more time  
Words of love, hard to find  
Gotta find my mother, she won't lie  
Where the hell's my father?  
Farther, farther  
You like to lie  
Swimming in the water  
One last time  
Imagination cross my mind  
I beat the bush, I beat the bush  
Shove me down  
Where the hell's my father?  
Farther, farther  
You like to lie  
Father, old man, can you find me?  
Father, old man, do you care?  
Father, old man, can you find me?  
Do you care?  
Father  
You like to lie
