Went down last night to take a look around  
Met little Sadie and I blew her down, went right home, went to bed  
Forty-four colt smokes under my head  
And I began to think what a deed I'd done  
Grabbed my hat and away I run, made a good run, but a little too slow  
They overtook me in Jericho  
I'm standin' on the corner ringin' the bell  
Along came the sheriff from Thomasville  
Says "Young man, your name's Brown,  
Remember the night you blew Sadie down?"  
Oh, yes sir, my name is Lee,  
I murdered little Sadie in the first degree  
First degree and the second degree  
Got any papers won't you read 'em to me.  
They took me downtown all dressed in black  
Put me on the train and sent me back  
Sent me back to the county jail, I had nobody to go for my bail  
The judge and the jury they took the stand  
The judge hold the paper in his right hand  
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,  
Forty-one years to wear the ball and stripes
