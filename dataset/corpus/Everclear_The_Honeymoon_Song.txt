You know I love you baby  
And I know you love me too  
But the fun that day  
Didn't start until  
We left on our honeymoon  
  
We stepped off the plane  
Into a warm sunny day  
And then we, got laid  
Together  
  
The sun shines down  
On a Hana lei town  
Where the fish all smile  
Cause they know us  
  
Our wedding day  
Was warm and sunny  
Our friends and family  
Came from out of town  
  
We said I do  
Then ate some food  
And smiled  
Until the sun went down  
  
We'll take the Zodiac Cadillac  
Around the north shore  
Then we'll head back  
The sea turtles come to greet us  
  
So let's get loaded tonight  
We'll drink on the flight  
Back home  
The honeymoon is over  
  
You know I love you baby  
And I know you love me too  
But the fun that day  
Didn't start until  
We left on our honeymoon  
  
We're on our honeymoon [Repeat x 2]  
  
The fun that day  
Didn't start until  
We left on our honeymoon
