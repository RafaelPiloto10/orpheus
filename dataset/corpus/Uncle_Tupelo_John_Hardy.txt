John Hardy, he was a desperate little man  
Carried two guns every day  
Shot a man down by the West Virginia line  
They saw John Hardy get away  
They saw John Hardy get away  
  
They cornered John Hardy on the Tombstone bridge  
He thought that he was free  
'Til the deputy sheriff came and grabbed him by the arm  
Said "Johnny, come along with me"  
"Johnny, come along with me"  
  
John Hardy, he stood inside his cell  
Tears running down his eyes  
Said "I've seen the death of many a poor boy  
Now I'm ready to die  
Now I'm ready to die"  
  
Well, I've been to the east and I've been to the west  
I've been the whole world round  
I've been to the north and I've been to the south  
Now I'm going to my hanging ground  
I'm going to my hanging ground
