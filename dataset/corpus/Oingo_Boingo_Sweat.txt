Sweat!  
Sweat!  
Sweat!  
Born for trouble, poised for action  
Ready to spring at a moment's notice  
Nerves like a trigger, waiting to be pulled  
Covered with sweat, it ain't nice  
Sweat!  
Help me please I'm burning up  
I got this fire in my heart  
Won't let me sleep, can't concentrate  
Even when it's cold I'm dripping sweat  
It ain't nice  
Sweat!  
Rivers running down my back  
Makes me slippery, like a fish  
If I don't stop, I might drown  
Falling down, down, down, down, not dead yet  
Covered with  
Sweat  
CHORUS  
The cool boys bit the dust  
They couldn't take the pressure  
The cool girls got knocked up  
They only wanted to have fun  
(Where did they go?)  
They fell in low and suffered  
(Where did they go?)  
They picked up guns and hammers  
(Where did they go?)  
Without friction there's no heat  
WIthout heat there's no fire  
Without fire there's no desire  
You're making me hot, hot, hot, hot!  
Sweat! Sweat!  
Take my baby, Saturday night  
It's hundred and ten, it's alright  
Close the door to my little room  
Starting to sweat, fun starts soon  
Sweat!  
Principal caught me after school  
Gave me hell, called me a fool  
Pointed his finger, at my face  
Started to sweat all over the place  
Flowed like rivers, onto the floor  
I can take it, give me some more  
Sweat!  
War breaks out throughout the land  
Dodging bullets in the sand  
Enemy's getting much to close  
Sun beats down on the back of my neck  
Fingers twitchin', covered with sweat  
Covered with sweat  
CHORUS  
Sweat!
