(Rollercoaster, roll, rollercoaster)  
Isabella: Phineas, are you sure this is safe?  
Phineas: Of course!  
(Rollercoaster, roll, rollercoaster)  
Phineas: It's like a leisurely drive around downtown  
Aaaahhhhhhh!  
But it starts with a 3 mile drop straight down  
Aaaahhhhhhh!  
And now keep your head and hands and feet inside the ride  
Aaaahhhhhhh!  
Not a written rule but it's strongly implied  
Aaaahhhhhhh!  
Permaneced sentados, por favor  
Scream if you want more!  
That's right  
Cork screwin 'round the interstate  
With peanut butter and rubber snakes  
Clear the way move over  
Look out Bud  
Here comes the mud!  
Rollercoaster, roll, rollercoaster  
Look out!  
Right side up and upside down  
Don't ask me to talk  
Can't tell a verb from a noun  
And I'm screaming like a baby  
Who's afraid of a clown  
Buford: I'm glad I'm wearing trousers  
That are already brown!  
Phineas: It'll twist your belly  
It'll turn your gut  
Man is this ride sweet or what?  
We go:  
Phineas and passengers: Ah ah ah  
Ferb: We go:  
Phineas and passengers: Ah ah ah  
Ferb: We go:  
Phineas and passengers: Ah ah ah  
Yeah rollercoaster  
Buford: I got the poster!
