I'll ride with you tonight  
I'll ride forever  
There's no way to predict this kind of weather  
Ashes fall to earth  
Words are severed  
Feathers turn to weighted iron pillars  
Midway Park  
Streetlights shine on a road that is dark  
Down on the graves  
Where we'll lie  
We'll lie  
We'll lie  
I'll think of you tonight  
I'll think forever  
There's no way to predict this kind of weather  
Ashes fall to earth  
Words are severed  
Feathers turn to broken beads and pillars  
Midway Park  
Streetlights shine on a road that is dark  
Down on the graves  
We'll lie  
Where we'll lie  
We'll lie  
Don't tell the truth  
We'll lie  
Just lie...
