I believe, that there's something deep inside  
That shouldn't be from time to time.  
I sure found out, for love was such a crime.  
The more you care, the more you fall.  
  
No need to worry, no need to turn away  
Cause it don't matter, anyway, baby  
  
[Chorus]  
Oooh, I miss you in a heartbeat.  
Oooh, I miss you right away.  
Oooh, I miss you in a heartbeat.  
It ain't love, if it don't feel that way.  
Oh, no.  
  
When we touch, I just lose my self control,  
A sad sensation I can't hide.  
To love is easy, it ain't easy to walk away.  
I keep the faith and there's a reason why.  
Yeah.  
  
No need to worry, no need to turn away  
Cause it don't matter, anyway, baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now, I ain't big on promises, I'll be true to you.  
I'll do 'bout anything, yeah,  
For some one like, baby for you.  
  
(Oooh)  
I miss you in a heartbeat.  
(Oooh)  
Yeah, I'd miss you right away.  
(Oooh)  
Oh, miss you in a heartbeat.  
(I miss you in a heartbeat.)  
Cause it ain't love if it don't feel that way.
