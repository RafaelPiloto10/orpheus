Woe to you, oh earth and sea  
For the Devil sends the beast with wrath  
Because he knows the time is short  
Let him who hath understanding  
Reckon the number of the beast  
For it is a human number  
Its number is six hundred and sixty six  
  
I left alone, my mind was blank, I needed time to think  
To get the memories from my mind  
What did I see? Can I believe that what I saw  
That night was real and not just fantasy?  
  
Just what I saw in my old dreams  
Were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me  
'Cause in my dreams, it's always there  
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair  
  
Night was black, was no use holding back  
'Cause I just had to see, was someone watching me?  
In the mist, dark figures move and twist  
Was all this for real or just some kind of Hell?  
  
6 6 6, the number of the beast  
Hell and fire was spawned to be released  
  
Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised  
As they start to cry, hands held to the sky  
In the night, the fires are burning bright  
The ritual has begun, Satan's work is done  
  
6 6 6, the number of the beast  
Sacrifice is going on tonight  
  
This can't go on, I must inform the law  
Can this still be real, or just some crazy dream?  
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes  
Seem to mesmerize, can't avoid their eyes  
  
6 6 6, the number of the beast  
6 6 6, the one for you and me  
  
I'm coming back, I will return  
And I'll possess your body, and I'll make you burn  
I have the fire, I have the force  
I have the power to make my evil take its course
