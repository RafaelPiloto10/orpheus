I am the final silence  
The last electrician alive  
And they called me the sparkle  
I was the best, I worked them all  
  
New ways, new ways  
I dream of wires  
  
We opened doors by thinking  
We went to sleep by dialing 'o'  
We drove to work by proxy  
I plugged my wife in, just for show  
  
New ways, new ways  
I dream of wires  
  
So I press 'c' for comfort  
I dream of wires, the old days
