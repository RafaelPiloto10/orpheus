Blue Spanish eyes  
Teardrops are falling from your Spanish eyes  
Please please don't cry,  
This is just adios and not good-bye  
Soon I'll return,  
Bringing you all the love your heart can hold  
Please say "Si Si"  
Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me  
  
Ummmm spanish eyes... And all of maxico  
  
To spanish eyes  
Please smile for me once more before I go  
  
Soon I'll return,  
Bringing you all the love your heart can hold  
Please say "Si Si"  
Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me  
Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me
