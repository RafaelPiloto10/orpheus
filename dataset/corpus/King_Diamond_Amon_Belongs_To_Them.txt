Today My Mother will return to My house  
And all the things I've done  
I've done to make her feel at home again  
Oh . . . it's all part of an act  
She can stay as long as I keep the pact  
There's someone ringing at My front door bell  
I see My Mother there  
Standing with the man I wanna send to hell  
Mother: "Oh King, see who came along"  
Ma, You don't understand  
It's all part of the deal  
There's no way I can let him inside  
You see "AMON" belongs to "THEM"  
Doctor: "You go ahead and have a talk with the boy My dear"  
You better bring this along  
Something might go wrong inside"  
Come on Mother let me show You the house  
Come on Mother there's a lot to discuss  
Mother: "Oh King, please let him in"  
Ma, You don't understand  
It's all part of the deal  
Ther's no way I can let him inside  
You see "AMON" belongs to "THEM"  
Now let Me tell You what I've seen in the house lately  
I've seen Your daughter here  
Coming and going when the dark is near  
You must never ever tell anyone what I've told  
I have hear "THEM" singing too  
Hey Mother what's that for?  
Oh I feel the needle piercing My skin  
And I'm falling, Yes I'm falling down . . .
