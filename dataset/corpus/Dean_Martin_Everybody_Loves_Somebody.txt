Everybody loves somebody sometime  
Everybody falls in love somehow  
Something in your kiss just told me  
That sometime is now  
  
Everybody finds somebody someplace  
There's no telling where love may appear  
Something in my heart keeps saying  
My someplace is here  
  
If I had it in my power  
I'd arrange for every girl to have you charms  
Then every minute, every hour  
Everybody would find what I found in your arms  
  
Everybody loves somebody sometime  
And though my dreams were overdue  
Your love made it all worth waiting  
For someone like you  
  
If I had it in my power  
I'd arrange for every girl to have you charms  
Then every minute, every hour  
Everybody would find what I found in your arms  
  
Everybody loves somebody sometime  
And though my dreams were overdue  
Your love made it all worth waiting  
For someone like you
