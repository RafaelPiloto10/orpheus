I flew a kite, I held on tight to its string  
Each time I go anywhere, I held on tight  
In the middle of the night I woke up in fright  
Thinking maybe in my dream I let go my kite  
  
When I was in a restaurant talking to my friends  
Watching their mouths move faster and faster  
I thought of the kite that was flying the sky  
And made sure that my hand was holding the string  
  
That was long time ago  
Many skies went by since then  
Now my hands stopped holding anything  
And I've learned to take a walk instead  
  
Then one day in an evening light  
I saw something strange shining bright  
The sky was dark with swarms of larks  
And in the midst of it all, yes, it was my kite  
  
How did the kite get there? I never know  
Floating away among the clouds to where nobody knows  
  
I held my gun with both my hands  
Slowly aiming at the shining dot  
The shot went off, that dot blew off  
Since then I've never seen the kite again
