Looking ba-a-ack over my life  
I can see where I caused you strife  
But I know, oh yes I know  
I'd never make that same mistake again  
  
Looking ba-a-ack over my deeds  
I can see signs a wise man heeds  
And if I just ha-ad the chance  
I'd never make that same mistake again  
  
Once my cup was overflowing  
But I gave nothing in retu-you-urn  
Now I can't begin to te-ell you  
What a lesson I have learned  
  
Looking ba-a-ack over the slate  
I can see love turned to hate  
But I know, oh yes I know  
I'd never make that same mistake again
