Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh  
The secrets that you keep  
I've only got myself to blame  
I played a losing game  
I lie awake and call your name  
All I own is just a picture in a broken frame  
It seemed so hard for me to share  
It's even harder now that you're not there  
(Now baby)  
I'm losing sleep over the secrets that you keep  
(Oh baby)  
I'm losing sleep over the secrets that you keep  
I lie awake at night not knowing where you are  
You know it don't seem right  
That you could be so far away from me  
Oh oh, the secrets that you keep  
Since you've been gone our worlds have grown apart  
Now I don't know what's in your head or in your heart  
Those little things you kept so secretly  
They don't mean much to you but they mean so much to me
