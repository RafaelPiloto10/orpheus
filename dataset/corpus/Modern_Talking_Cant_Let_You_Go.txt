You don't need nobody  
When you're down and so alone  
And there's no telephone  
No one calls you at home, my baby  
Oh tell me that you need me  
And I'm sailing back to you  
And I'm staying, yes it's true  
For you I am the fool, your my lady  
  
Can't let you go, I need you so  
Can't let you go, the time will show  
Can't let you go, you break my heart for all the time  
  
Heaven will miss an angel  
And I know you are the sun  
But baby now you're gone  
My heart it needs a home, oh baby  
Oh tell me that you miss me  
And I'm driving home to you  
You broke the golden rules  
For you I am the fool, your my lady
