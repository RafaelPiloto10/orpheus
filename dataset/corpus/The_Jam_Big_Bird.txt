Open up the sky  
Cause I'm coming up to you  
So send down your wings  
It'll bring me to you  
You know I'm standing at the station  
Ready to go  
Big ol airplane, you know I trust in you so  
  
Get on up big bird  
To my baby, love  
Get on up big bird  
To my baby, love  
Get on up big bird  
I got to make it heard  
Get on up big bird  
I got to make it heard  
Get on up!  
  
Way down here  
You up there  
Well we know is  
Is it ain't no fair  
  
You know I'm standing at the station  
Ready to go  
Big ol airplane, you know I trust in you so  
  
Get on up big bird  
To my baby, love  
Get on up big bird  
To my baby, love  
Get on up big bird  
I got to make it heard  
Get on up big bird  
I got to make it heard  
Get on up!
