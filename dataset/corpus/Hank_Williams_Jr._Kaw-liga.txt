I'm a rolling stone, all alone and lost,  
For a life of sin, I have paid the cost.  
When I pass by, all the people say  
"Just another guy on the lost highway."  
  
Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine  
And a woman's lies make a life like mine.  
Oh, the day we met, I went astray,  
I started rollin' down that lost highway.  
  
I was just a lad, nearly twenty-two,  
Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you,  
And now I'm lost, too late to pray,  
Lord, I've paid the cost on the lost highway.  
  
Now, boys, don't start your ramblin' round,  
On this road of sin or you're sorrow bound.  
Take my advice or you'll curse the day  
You started rollin' down that lost highway
