Rowers gliding on the river  
Canadian geese crap along the bank  
Back wheel of my bike begins to quiver  
The chain is wrapped around the crank  
  
Old ladies, who must be doggie training  
Walking, throwing balls, chasing all the sheep  
While the farmer stands around, and he's complaining  
His mad cows are being put to sleep and I'm a Pisces fish and the river runs
through my soul  
  
Smoke signals from the brewery  
Like someone in there found the latest Pope  
In a vat of beer that keeps pumping out with fury  
While the churchbell ringer's tangled in his rope  
  
There's a temple on an island  
I think of all the Gods and what they feel  
You can only find them in the deepest silence  
I got to get off of this big wheel  
  
And I'm a Pisces fish and the river runs through my soul  
I'm a Pisces fish and the river runs through my soul  
  
And I'll be swimming until I can find those waters  
That one unbounded ocean of bliss  
That's flowing through your parents, sons and daughters  
But still an easy thing for us to miss  
  
Blades go skimming through the water  
I hear the coxon shouting his instructions about  
With this crew oh it could be a tall order  
Have we time to sort all of these things out  
  
Some times my life it seems like fiction  
Some of the days it's really quite serene  
I'm living proof of all life's contradictions  
One half's going where the other half's just been  
And I'm a Pisces fish and the river runs through my soul
