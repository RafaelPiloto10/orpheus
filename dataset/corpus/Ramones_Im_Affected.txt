When I look into your big brown eyes  
And I feel like I'm in paradise  
I want you by my side  
Cause I'm affected, 'fected  
Yeah, I'm affected, 'fected  
Well I'm affected  
And all I want is you  
  
Didn't know it a few years ago  
But now I finally know  
I want you by my side  
I want you baby, baby, baby, baby  
  
Yeah, I love you and I want you to know  
Yeah, yeah, and that's for sure  
I want you by my side  
Cause I'm affected, 'fected  
Yeah, I'm affected, 'fected  
Well, I'm affected  
And all I want is you
