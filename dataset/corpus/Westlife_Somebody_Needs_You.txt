I'm only human  
Sometimes I make mistakes  
If you forgive me  
I'm gonna do what it takes  
  
But now I know better  
To hurt you was wrong  
Girl it's with you I belong  
  
Somebody needs you  
Like never before  
Somebody wants your love  
So open the door  
Don't you leave me alone  
Don't you turn out the light  
Somebody wants you  
Somebody needs you tonight  
  
I've been thinking  
We should be talking it through  
You must believe me  
I'll make it up to you  
  
Cause now I know better  
To hurt you was wrong  
Girl it's with you I belong  
  
In the dark  
When there's no one else around  
I still pray  
That our love can be found
