Hush, little baby, don't say a word,  
Papa's gonna buy you a mockingbird.  
  
And if that mockingbird don't sing,  
Papa's gonna buy you a diamond ring.  
  
And if that diamond ring turn brass,  
Papa's gonna buy you a looking glass.  
  
And if that looking glass gets broke,  
Papa's gonna buy you a billy goat.  
  
And if that billy goat don't pull,  
Papa's gonna buy you a cart and bull.  
  
And if that cart and bull turn over,  
Papa's gonna buy you a dog named Rover.  
  
And if that dog named Rover won't bark.  
Papa's gonna to buy you and horse and cart.  
  
And if that horse and cart fall down,  
Well you'll still be the sweetest little baby in town.
