Get up Jimmy Newman, the morning is come.  
The engines are rumbling.  
The coffee's all brewed.  
Get up Jimmy Newman, there's work to be done.  
And why do you lie there still sleeping.  
There's a waiting line forming  
To use the latrine.  
And the sun is just opening the skies.  
The breakfast they're serving just has to be seen.  
And you've only to open your eyes.  
Get up Jimmy Newman my radio's on.  
The news is all bad, but it's good for a laugh.  
The tent flap is loose and the peg must be gone.  
And why do you lie there still sleeping.  
The night nurse is gone  
And the sexy one's here.  
And she tells us such beautiful lies.  
Her uniform's tight.  
Oh her marvelous rear.  
And you've only to open your eyes.  
Get up Jimmy Newman you're missing the fun.  
They're talking us next, Jim.  
It's time to go home.  
It's over for us there's no more to be done.  
And why do you lie there still sleeping.  
It's state side for us, Jim.  
The folks may not know.  
And we'll let it be such a surprise.  
They're loading us next, Jim we're ready to go.  
And you've only to open your eyes.  
And you've only to open your eyes.  
Get up Jimmy open your eyes.
