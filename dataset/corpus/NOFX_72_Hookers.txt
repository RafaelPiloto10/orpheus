They don't hates us, they just hate their lives  
And desperate people learn to despise  
The suicidles don't want a coup  
They don't want to blow up, they just want their 72  
  
72 virgins can never stop a war  
But 100.000 hookers can beat the marine corps  
I'm stopping hatred , fighting will cease  
When everyone is getting blow jobs  
That's when we'll finally have world peace  
  
How many million men have been killed in foreign wars?  
We need to reinstate the draft, enlist a million whores  
Start with the sororities and then all the spring breaks  
Ship the girls gone wild to Afghanistan  
They'll gladly blow the sheiks (a correct pronunciation)  
  
These holy wars aren't holy, it's not the military complex  
Terrorist are 16 year old kids who were promised jihad sex  
  
Maybe if they could see a woman's face  
They might not get onto that plane  
With a bomb in their suitcase  
  
72 virgins can never stop a war  
But 100.000 hookers can beat the marine corps  
In stopping violence, fighting will cease  
When everyone is getting blow jobs  
That's when we'll finally have world peace
