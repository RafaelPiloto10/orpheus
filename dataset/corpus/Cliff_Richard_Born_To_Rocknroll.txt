If music be the food of love then play on  
Lend me your ears as I lay down this song  
You're touched by the feeling-it's hard to control  
Let me tell you people  
I was born to rock'n'roll  
  
Some people want to fight- some people want to fly  
Others live for pleasure-even do or die  
Some are born to power-try to save a soul  
Let me tell you people  
I was born to rock'n'roll  
  
It may sound a little absurd  
But I was born to spread the word  
Got the music in my soul  
I was born to rock'n'roll  
  
Some people are born to money  
Privileged all their days  
Never had a problem-never had to pay  
But I don't have a doubt about the feeling in my soul  
Let me tell you people  
I was born to rock'n'roll  
  
It may sound a little absurd  
But I was born to spread the word  
Got the music in my soul  
I was born to rock'n'roll  
  
(Instrumental)  
  
It may sound a little absurd  
But I was born to spread the word  
Got the music in my soul  
I was born to rock'n'roll  
  
It may sound a little absurd  
But I was born to spread the word  
Got the music in my soul  
I was born to rock'n'roll  
  
Born to rock'n'roll  
I was born to rock'n'roll
