Well I came down here from manhattan  
To see the lights on the mall  
But when I got here early this morning  
Well I couldn't see any at all  
So I walked a little further  
And much to my surprise  
There was a hot cool woman  
In a chevy staring into my eyes  
I've just got to see the lights  
I've just got to see the lights  
I've just got to see the lights  
Alright  
She said now don't walk any further  
Just jump into my car  
And we can head on down the highway  
But you'd better not go too far  
Cause my daddy he's big business  
So we've gotta be back by tonight  
But we can still have some fun now  
If we head on downtown to see the lights  
I've just got to see the lights  
I've just got to see the lights  
I've just got to see the lights  
I've just got to see the lights  
I've just got to see the lights  
I've just got to see the lights  
Well, we ended up in this cafe  
'Bout twenty-five minutes to one  
See, she took me to this nightclub  
And the music went on and on  
Well we were set down to get coffee  
When in walked her old man  
No matter how we tried to explain it well  
We couldn't make him understand  
I've just got to see the lights  
I've just got to see the lights  
I've just got to see the lights
