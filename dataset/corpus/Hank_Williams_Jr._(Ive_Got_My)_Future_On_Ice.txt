"I got a past  
That'll last me forever  
And enough memories for one man's life (that is true)  
The one I love  
She ain't comin back ever  
So it looks like I've got my future on ice  
  
I got bottles and cans  
That just left my hand  
And a chill to just the right Fahrenheit  
O love let me down  
Now a truer friend I've found  
Why I've got my future on ice  
  
There was a time  
She was my one and only  
Until someone else caught her eye  
Then for awhile,  
Can you believe I was acting so lonely?  
Now I've got my future on ice  
  
I got bottles and cans  
That just left my hands  
And a chill to just the right Fahrenheit  
Yes love let me down  
Now a truer friend I found  
Now I've got my future on ice  
  
O love let me down  
Now a real true friend I found  
Why I got my future on ice
