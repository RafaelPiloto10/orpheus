Why am I strapped to this hospital bed?  
  
"First your eyes, then your skin  
We will make you feel.. born again.. No More Me my friend"  
  
A shiny scalpel is in the Master's hand  
His Wife has got the jars for Blood, she keeps one near  
I fear for my life, No More Me  
I fear there will be No More Me at all  
Is this goodbye sweet life...  
  
Ahhhhh...Scalpel cuts, eyelids drop  
Into a jar...I'm crying Blood  
Fingers pull my eyeballs out...  
Scissors snap...I bleed a lot  
  
They set my eyes into this Puppet's head  
And still my eyes can see, I'm looking back.. at myself  
And what I see is No More Me at all  
I have no eyes  
  
My veins...feel.. like worms  
Drying in the sun... this takes too long  
Stripping skin from all my bones  
Pain too strong...my senses they go numb  
  
All of my Blood is now in little jars  
I should be dead by now, but I am still  
I am still alive inside my eyes  
And I see Emerencia throw my carcass in the trash
