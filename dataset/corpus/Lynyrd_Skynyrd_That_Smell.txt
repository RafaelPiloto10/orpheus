Whiskey bottles, and brand new cars  
Oak tree you're in my way  
There's too much coke and too much smoke  
Look what's going on inside you  
Ooooh that smell  
Can't you smell that smell  
Ooooh that smell  
The smell of death surrounds you  
  
Angel of darkness is upon you  
Stuck a needle in your arm  
So take another toke, have a blow for your nose  
One more drink fool, will drown you  
Ooooh that smell  
Can't you smell that smell  
Ooooh that smell  
The smell of death surrounds you  
  
Now they call you Prince Charming  
Can't speak a word when you're full of 'ludes  
Say you'll be all right come tomorrow  
But tomorrow might not be here for you  
Ooooh that smell  
Can't you smell that smell  
Ooooh that smell  
The smell of death surrounds you  
  
Hey, you're a fool you  
Stick them needles in your arm  
I know I been there before  
  
One little problem that confronts you  
Got a monkey on your back  
Just one more fix, Lord might do the trick  
One hell of a price for you to get your kicks  
Ooooh that smell  
Can't you smell that smell  
Ooooh that smell  
The smell of death surrounds you  
Ooooh that smell  
Can't you smell that smell  
Ooooh that smell  
The smell of death surrounds you
