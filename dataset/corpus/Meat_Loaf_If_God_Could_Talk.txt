If God could talk, would He tell you to come back to me?  
If God could talk, would He tell you it's alright, just leave  
And don't look back at all the memories  
The best of times, the mess you made of me  
Walk on, if you think it's gonna make you strong  
Why don't you run away and find yourself alive?  
Go on and turn the page before your lonely world collides  
What's it gonna take to break the silence  
That's been tearin' you apart?  
If God could talk, would He part the oceans straight to you  
Make mountains move, crumble at your feet to get you through  
Another day, another night alone  
Step right out into the great unknown tonight  
Even God knows, baby, that ain't right  
Why don't you run away and find yourself alive  
Go on and turn the page before your lonely world collides  
What's it gonna take to break the silence  
That's been tearin' you apart? If God could talk  
Did you swear to yourself on the day it was over  
That you'd never turn around and get locked up in another cage?  
Did you tear all the pictures of us living life together  
Did you burn all the memories that have been made in a fit of rage?  
Why don't you run away and find yourself alive  
Go on and turn the page before your lonely world collides  
What's it gonna take to break the silence  
That's been tearin' you apart?  
If only God could talk  
If only God could talk  
If only God could talk  
If only God could talk  
Would you listen now, if God could talk?
