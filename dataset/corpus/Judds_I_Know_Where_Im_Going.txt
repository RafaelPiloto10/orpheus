I know where I'm goin'  
Don't you want to come too?  
I got my reservations  
And I got one for you  
The train's leavin' just after dark  
There's always room for a lovin' heart  
I know where I'm goin'  
Don't you want to come too?  
  
I know my destination  
It's a' waitng for me  
I got no hesitation  
That's where I want to be  
And by the time that the sun comes up  
I'll be drinkin' from a lovin' cup  
I know where I'm goin'  
Don't you want to come too?  
  
[Chorus]  
I know why I'm singin'  
Don't you want to sing too?  
Can't you hear the bells a ringin'?  
Let the spirit move you  
  
Just close your eyes and let it flow  
Lean your head back, let it go  
I know where I'm goin'  
Don't you want to come too?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know where I'm goin'  
Don't you want to come too?  
I got my reservations  
And I got you for you  
I know why I'm singin'  
Don't you want to sing too?  
Can't you hear the bells a ringin'?  
Let the spirit move you  
Spirit move you, yeah  
  
I know where I'm goin'  
Don't you want to come too?  
I know where I'm goin'  
Don't you want to come too?
