I hear your voice everywhere  
It's echoes of love  
Making me look back over my shoulder  
Echoes of love are started all over  
Echoes of love  
Keeps on haunting  
I'm out of control  
Keeps on burning  
Echoes of love are out of control  
Bringing back love I used to hold  
  
Darlin', since you went away  
Think about you every day  
So many memories  
Got to get the best of me  
  
Recalling the times  
I used to hold you  
I just wouldn't do  
What I was supposed to  
I've done things  
I'd like to undo  
Now darlin' it's you  
I'd like to run to  
  
Echoes of love  
Keeps on haunting  
I'm out of control  
Keeps on burning  
Echoes of love are out of control  
Bringing back love I used to hold  
  
Echoes of love  
Echoes of love  
Love, echoes of love  
Keeps on haunting  
Echoes of love, echoes of love  
Keeps on burning  
Echoes of love
