Eat, Eat, Eat, all day long  
Eat, Eat, Eat, while I sing this song  
Eat, Eat, Eat, goldfish taste real good  
Eat, Eat, Eat, in your neighborhood.  
  
Lets break it down now..  
  
Eating, eating, gets me by,  
On day that I just wanna die,  
Weather it be, cookies or some pumkin pie  
Eatings what I'm doing, so moy tai.  
  
Eat-eat-eat-eat-eat, whoooo I'm outta air  
Mommy gonna finish that sweet ecclair?  
Or that pepsi that's sitting there?  
I can't have it? Wow that ain't fair!  
  
Eat, eat, eat, never stop  
Pretty p-p-please with cream on top  
Once start my eating I never stop  
Daddy heres some bacon so  
Chop, chop, chop.  
  
I want some food can almost taste it  
As cheech marin said (Let's get back T basics)  
  
Eat, Eat, Eat, all day long  
Eat, Eat, Eat, while I sing this song  
Eat, Eat, Eat, everything looks good  
Eat, Eat, Eat, if you wish you could.
