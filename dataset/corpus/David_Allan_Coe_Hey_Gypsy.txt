Hey gypsy, hey gypsy come on home  
Even if it's just to paint your wagon  
Old hobo how long can this go on  
She's mending socks and sittin' home a naggin'  
Hey outlaw let's spend some time together she said outlaw  
It does matter whether we're alone come on home  
  
Hey drifter has your feeling for her gone  
Have you spent too many night out on the highway  
Hey loner she said hit the road and sing your songs  
It won't be long until I have your baby  
Hey outlaw let's spend some time together...  
Hey drifter (hey gypsy) hey outlaw (hey drifter)  
Hey loner (hey outlaw) hey hobo (hey drifter)  
Hey gypsy hey gypsy
