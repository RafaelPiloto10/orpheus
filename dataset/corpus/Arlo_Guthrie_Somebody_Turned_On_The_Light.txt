I've been to wild Montana  
I went there in a storm  
My boots were Texas leather  
My Levis wet and torn  
  
I loved it in Montana  
Loved it in the storm  
I think I'm gonna cross that river  
I just might be reborn  
  
New York, New York, winter, '61  
Takin' me a city ride  
Somebody tall musta put out the lights  
'Cause it got real dark outside  
  
[Chorus:]  
And I never saw the sun till '71  
But I never gave up the fight  
I sure was glad when I saw the dawn  
Somebody, somebody turned on the light  
Somebody turned on the light  
  
Women, wine, and fast red cars  
And I couldn't seem to read the signs  
Somebody said, "Whose life is this?"  
And I said that it can't be mine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When the world is wrong, better right yourself  
It'll make the dark clouds fly  
Nobody tall can put out the lights  
Just don't let the spirit die  
  
If you never see the sun till '91  
Don't you ever give up the fight  
Sure be glad when you see the dawn  
Somebody, somebody turns on the light  
Somebody turns on the light
