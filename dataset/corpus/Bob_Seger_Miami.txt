They saw the lights on the horizon  
Out of the seas it came shinin'  
The buildings so high  
They seemed to touch the sky  
Miami, Oh Miami  
  
They felt the warm breezes blowing  
From off the strange new ocean  
They reached the end safe  
It was a new day  
Miami. Oh Miami  
  
Oh, it must've seemed  
Something from a dream  
Shinin' through the night  
All those city lights  
Staring at the shore  
Hungry, tired and worn  
Could it really be  
Were they really free  
  
And so they came  
A hundred thousand  
To find a way of life  
They could believe in  
Far away from home  
With nothing of their own  
To Miami, Oh Miami  
  
They saw the lights  
Miami
