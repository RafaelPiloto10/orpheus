I try hard to resist you  
Pretend that you're not there  
I haven't even kissed you  
But don't think that I won't dare  
'Cause you get to me baby  
Like no one ever could  
Why don't you come and save me  
Don't tease me like you do  
  
No no no no  
Ay ay I can't do without you  
No,no can't do , I can't do without you  
Ay ay I can't do without you  
  
No matter what they tell me  
There's nothin' like true love  
But if there's no happy ending  
At least you loved then lost  
That's how I feel about you  
And though it may take some time  
I love everything about you  
And I've got to make you mine  
  
No no no no  
Ay ay I can't do without you  
I love you baby, can't you see I want you baby  
Ay ay I can't do without you  
  
And though you set me up then  
Turn me down  
No matter what you say or do  
Your eyes are telling me you want me too  
I'm looking right through you  
  
And what I see is heaven  
Just waiting there for me  
Baby this was meant to happen  
Or I'll never be set free  
  
No no no no  
Ay ay I can't do without you  
No, baby can't do  
Ay ay I can't do without you
