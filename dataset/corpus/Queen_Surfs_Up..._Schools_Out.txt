Surf's up, school's out  
I got a criminal urge to twist and shout  
  
I've been searching my whole life through  
For some perfect dream imagined in my youth  
  
(Follow that dream  
Surf's up, school's out  
Surf's up, school's out)  
  
For a perfect life, find a perfect girl  
You gotta follow that dream to a perfect world  
I've been a searcher, an adventurer too  
This ride still runs, I wanna ride with you  
  
This ride still runs, wanna ride with you  
  
(Follow that dream  
Surf's up, school's out  
Surf's up, school's out)  
  
In the town and the country  
We all lay and dreamed our dreams  
Then we found the world is tough  
And all is not quite what it seems  
Gotta take it by the horns  
Gotta seize your precious day  
Gotta follow your dream  
  
(Follow that dream  
Follow that dream  
Follow that dream  
Surf's up, school's out  
Follow that dream  
Surf's up, school's out  
Surf's up  
Follow that dream  
Surf's up, school's out  
Surf's up, school's out  
Follow that dream)  
  
Follow that dream
