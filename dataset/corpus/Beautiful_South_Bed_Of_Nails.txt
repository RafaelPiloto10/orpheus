Don't think of what we can and can't achieve  
Perfection like this can't be guaranteed  
Hearts get lost, lovers leave  
Let's just see what friendship actually needs  
And if ever you do wrong I'm right behind you  
If ever you may sin, count me in  
If that devil doubt should come to find you  
Count on me and you don't count on him  
If luck should quit this town  
If fortune sails  
If conversation breaks down  
If love derails  
I'll be that back up call  
If all else fails  
I'll swap this bed of roses  
For a bed of nails  
I wouldn't mind being left up on that shelf  
If I hadn't actually built, built the thing myself  
But since there's only you and no one else  
I don't get too wound up about my health  
And if ever shelf may fall I'm right below you  
In need of DIY then I'm your guy  
If lack of confidence should come to know you  
Don't let those tears you cry stop you and I  
If luck should quit this town  
If fortune sails  
If conversation breaks down  
If love derails  
I'll be that back up call  
If all else fails  
I'll swap this bed of roses  
For a bed of nails
