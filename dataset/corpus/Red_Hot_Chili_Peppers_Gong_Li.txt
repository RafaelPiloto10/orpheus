Some people say you hate me,  
I don't believe it's true, things that you're going through  
Some people say you hate me,  
I don't believe it's you, things that you're going through,  
Some people sad I pray for,  
No one you want to live, the eyes that once were his  
Some people sad I pray for,  
The way you want to live, the eyes you want to give  
Some people say you played me,  
I don't care if it's true, I'm waiting here for you,  
Some people say you made it,  
I'm not afraid to know, when things are getting low  
Some people say you hate me,  
I don't believe it's true, things that you're going through  
Some people say you hate me,  
I don't believe it's you, things that you're going through
