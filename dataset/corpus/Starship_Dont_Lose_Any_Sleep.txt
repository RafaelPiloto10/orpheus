You tell me to be strong, tell me to be strong  
Goodbye ain't no reason to cry, it ain't no big deal  
You say I'll get along, sure I'll get along  
You're so nonchalant that it's unreal  
  
Well I thought this love would be all I needed  
I thought this love was something to believe in  
Now you, you say sorry babe, it didn't work out that way  
Don't let it ruin you're day babe  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't lose any sleep now babe  
It's just my heart you're breakin', it's just my heart you're breakin'  
Don't lose any sleep now babe  
Just don't worry 'bout me, don't you worry 'bout me  
I'll be all right, oh yeah  
  
Don't act so concerned, no don't be concerned  
Don't know how much more of your kindness I can bear  
Guess I had to learn, just had to learn  
That after all this you just don't care  
  
Well don't let that worry your mind now  
I'll be okay, baby I'll be fine now  
It's just that I'm watching my world walking away  
Don't let it ruin you're day babe  
  
Don't lose any sleep now babe  
It's just my heart you're breakin', it's just my world you're takin' (Yeah
babe)  
Don't lose any sleep now babe  
Just don't worry 'bout me, don't you worry 'bout me  
I'll be all right, oh yeah  
  
I thought this love was all that I needed  
I thought this love was something to believe in  
Now you just say sorry babe, it didn't work out that way  
Don't let it ruin your day babe  
Don't lose any sleep now babe, oh,  
Don't lose any sleep now babe, oh,  
  
Don't lose any sleep now babe  
It's just my heart you're breakin', it's just my heart you're breakin'  
Don't lose any sleep now babe  
Just don't worry 'bout me, don't you worry 'bout me  
Don't lose any sleep now babe  
It's just my world you're takin', it's just my world you're takin'  
  
Don't you worry baby it's just my heart  
Can't you see it's breaking baby
