Ain't a cardinal sin, baby lemme in, girl I'm gonna treat you right  
Well goodness sakes, my snake's alive and it's ready to bite  
Hornet's nest, lay me down to rest, ooh I wanna shed my skin  
I got the urge to merge, you're cold as ice, baby won't you lemme in  
Night scenes, wet dreams, enough to make you drool  
And fire, fire, fire for the fuel  
  
Don't like to dress, talk too good, but I found my queen  
Not too clean, know what I like, if you know what I mean  
  
Baby, baby, guess you win the prize  
Maybe, baby, where the sun never shines  
  
This must be love, fits like a glove  
Well it must be love, it must be love - fits like a glove - fits like a glove  
  
Feel the heat, driver's seat, my blessing is my curse  
Think I'm gonna burst, a gonna burst, a gonna burst  
  
Night scenes, wet dreams, enough to make you drool  
And fire, fire, fire for the fuel  
  
Ooh baby, babe - fits like a glove  
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah - fits like a glove - fits like a glove  
  
Cause when I go through her, it's just like a hot knife through butter, ooh
yeah  
  
Baby, baby, guess you win the prize  
Maybe, baby, where the sun never shines  
  
Fits like a glove - well it must be love, it must be love - fits like a glove  
Fits like a glove - well it must be love, it must be love  
Fits like a glove
