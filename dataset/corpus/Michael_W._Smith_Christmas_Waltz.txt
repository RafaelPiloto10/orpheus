Frosted window panes  
Candles gleaming inside  
Painted candy canes on the tree  
  
Santa's on his way  
He's filled his sleigh with things  
Things for you and for me  
  
It's that time of year  
When the world falls in love  
Every song you hear seems to say  
  
Merry Christmas  
May your New Year's dreams come true  
And this song of mine  
In three quarter time  
Wishes you and yours  
The same thing too!  
  
Frosted window panes  
(See them gleaming)  
Candles gleaming inside  
Painted candy canes on the tree  
Just look and you'll see  
  
Santa's on his way  
(That's why sleigh bells are ringing)  
He's filled his sleigh  
(And that's why we're all singing)  
With things  
Things for you and for me  
  
It's that time of year  
(Time for falling)  
When the world falls in love  
(So in love)  
Every song you hear seems to say  
  
Merry Christmas  
May your New Year's dreams come true  
And this song of mine  
In three quarter time  
Wishes you and yours  
The same thing too!
