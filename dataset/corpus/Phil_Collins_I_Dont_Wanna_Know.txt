It's over, oh yes it's all over  
And it's been a long time coming  
Some say it's too long  
She said it, and now she'll regret it  
But if she'd ask anyone  
I know they'll tell her to her face, that it's too late  
  
Cause I don't want to know  
No, I don't want to know  
She can cry all she wants  
She's not gonna bring me back, no no  
I don't want to know  
I don't want to know  
She can try all she wants  
It's not gonna get me back, oh oh, no no  
  
They warned me  
Oh yes they all warned me  
They told me, don't lose your heart to her  
She'll never give it back, no no  
Oh it's too late  
She made a big mistake  
It wouldn't be the first one anyway  
Tell me how many more, no no no  
  
No I don't want to know (what she said)  
No I don't want to know (what she said)  
She can cry all she wants  
She's not gonna bring me back, no no  
I don't want to know (what she said)  
No I don't want to know (what she said)  
She can try all she wants  
It's not gonna get me back, oh oh, no no  
  
It's over  
Oh oh it's all over  
And it's been a long time coming  
Some say it's too long, oh oh  
They warned me  
Yes they all warned me  
They told me, now don't lose your head to her  
She'll never give it back, no no, no no  
  
I don't want to know (what she said)  
No I don't want to know (what she said)  
She can cry all she wants  
She's not gonna get me back, no no  
I don't want to know (what she said)  
No I don't want to know (what she said)  
She can try all she wants  
She's not gonna bring me back, no no
