There's no more place to go  
the other bars are closed  
the night the stranger came to town  
how do you know  
when you're right or wrong?  
How do you know  
if you hurt or if you don't?  
So many people say so many things  
but nobody agrees on anything  
there's no more place to go  
shadows she said  
there's no more place to go  
shadows she said  
this night's an empty shell  
shadows she said  
and all the shadows followed after her  
you burned the book of life  
the cradle and the tomb  
how could you ever dare  
there's no more turning back  
your stars lit up in flames  
there's gunsmoke in the air  
and yesterday you bought a brand-new car  
but you don't feel like going very far  
there's no more place to go...  
There's no more place to go  
shadows she said  
there's no more place to go  
shadows she said  
this night's an empty shell  
shadows she said  
and all the shadows followed after her  
here they come...  
Shadows she said...  
And all the shadows followed after her...  
Shadows she said...
