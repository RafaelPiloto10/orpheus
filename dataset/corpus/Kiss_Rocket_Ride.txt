Lady space, you like the way  
I make you feel inside  
Take a rocket ride  
From the start you wanted to fly  
I got the rocket and you want the ride  
Take a rocket ride  
  
Baby wants it fast, baby wants a blast  
She wants a rocket ride, she wants a rocket ride  
Baby wants it fast, baby wants a blast  
She wants a rocket ride, she wants a rocket ride  
  
Lady space, you better wake up fast  
Countdown is comin' on  
Take a rocket ride  
The gravity that used to hold you down  
Just don't exist no more  
Take a rocket ride  
  
Baby wants it fast, baby wants a blast  
She wants a rocket ride, she wants a rocket ride  
Baby wants it fast, baby wants a blast  
She wants a rocket ride, she wants a rocket ride  
Come on, grab a hold of my rocket  
  
Baby wants it fast, baby wants a blast  
She wants a rocket ride, she wants a rocket ride  
Baby wants it fast, baby wants a blast  
She wants a rocket ride, she wants a rocket ride  
Baby's on her knees, baby wants to please  
She wants a rocket ride, she wants a rocket ride  
Baby's on her knees, baby wants to please  
She wants a rocket ride, she wants a rocket ride
