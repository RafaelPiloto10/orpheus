Thought that I was going crazy  
Just having one those days yeah  
Didn't know what to do  
Then there was you  
  
And everything went from wrong to right  
And the stars came out and filled up the sky  
The music you were playing really blew my mind  
It was love at first sight  
  
'cause baby when I heard you  
For the first time I knew  
We were meant to be as one  
  
Was tired of running out of luck  
Thinking 'bout giving up yeah  
Didn't know what to do  
Then there was you  
  
And everything went from wrong to right  
And the stars came out and filled up the sky  
The music you were playing really blew my mind  
It was love at first sight  
  
'cause baby when I heard you  
For the first time  
I knew we were meant to be as one  
  
And everything went from wrong to right  
And the stars came out and filled up the sky  
The music you were playing really blew my mind  
It was love at first sight
