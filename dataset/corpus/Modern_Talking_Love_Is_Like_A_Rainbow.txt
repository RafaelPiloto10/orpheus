When I Look Into Your Eye's - I Can See A Part Of Heaven  
Never Felt Like This Before - In My Life...  
Love Shines In Many Colors - Love Is Shining For Us  
Believe Me - That My Love Is Real...  
  
Love Will Lift You Up And And Let You Down  
The Light Behind The Shadow Will Tell You  
That I Will Never Go.....  
If You See A Rainbow In The Sky  
I Will Promise That You'll Never Cry - Again  
Those Tears From Heaven...  
  
Every Hour And Every Minute  
I Will Touch You And I Will Feel It  
Alway's Looking For Someone Like You In My Life  
I Cover You With Sunlight  
I Will Take Your Hand And Hold You Tight  
If Raindrops - Will Darken The Sky...
