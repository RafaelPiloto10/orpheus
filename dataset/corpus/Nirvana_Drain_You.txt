One baby to another says, "I'm lucky to have met you"  
I don't care what you think unless it is about me  
It is now my duty to completely drain you  
I travel through a tube and end up in your infection  
Chew my meat for you  
Pass it back and forth in a passionate kiss  
From my mouth to yours  
I like you  
  
With eyes so dilated, I've became your pupil  
You've taught me everything without a poison apple  
The water is so yellow  
I'm a healthy student  
Indebted and so grateful  
Vacuum out the fluids  
Chew my meat for you  
Pass it back and forth in a passionate kiss  
From my mouth to yours  
I like you, you, you, you, you, you

A travel through a tube and end up in your infection  
Chew my meat for you  
Pass it back and forth in a passionate kiss  
From my mouth to yours  
Sloppy lips to lips  
You're my vitamins  
I like you
