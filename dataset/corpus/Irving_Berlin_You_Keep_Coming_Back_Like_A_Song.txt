Can't run away from you, dear  
I've tried so hard but I fear  
You'll always follow me near and far  
Just when I think that I'm set  
Just when I've learned to forget  
I close my eyes, dear, and there you are  
  
You keep coming back like a song  
A song that keeps saying, remember  
  
The sweet used-to-be  
That was once you and me  
Keeps coming back like an old melody  
  
The perfume of roses in may  
Returns to my room in december  
  
From out of the past where forgotten things belong  
You keep coming back like a song
