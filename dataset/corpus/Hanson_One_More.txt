I sit here by myself  
Just staring into space  
I thought I knew you well  
Well who can ever say  
It seems I've spent so long  
I can't define my right from wrong  
One more for the night  
One more for the pain and  
One more, long goodbye  
And one shot to the brain  
And one more takes the knife  
And one more takes the train  
Who do I name today  
A dream of better days  
Was long gone by the way  
Is there a better place  
Well who can ever say  
It seems I've spent so long  
I can't define my right from wrong  
One more for the night  
One more for the pain and  
One more, long goodbye  
And one shot to the brain  
And one more takes the knife  
And one more takes the train  
Who do I name today  
Who do I blame today  
Nothing's over 'til it's over  
And if it's over I don't  
Want to hear it  
Look into my eyes I told her  
Holding onto what is gone won't heal it  
It seems I've spent so long I can't  
Define my right from wrong  
One more for the night  
One more for the pain and  
One more, long goodbye  
And one shot to the brain  
And one more takes the knife  
And one more takes the train  
Who do I name today  
Who do I blame today
