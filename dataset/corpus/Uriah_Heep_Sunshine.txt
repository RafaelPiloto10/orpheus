For many years I felt like a man  
Feeling his way through darkness  
This priceless treasure  
For which Ive searched  
  
Appeared to me nothing more  
Than a mirage in the sea  
But when the vision faded  
From this struggle and dream  
Suddenly my illusion is diary  
I've now discovered what is reality  
Sunshine, sunshine, sunshine  
Ive found you  
  
Even if you're only  
Even if you're only  
Even if you're only  
Destined for a while  
Sunshine, sunshine, sunshine  
  
Ive found you  
Even if you're only  
Destined for a while  
I'll be both most impressions  
  
And I arrive this with a smile  
As the picture book shows Stanley  
Standing at the source of the Nile
