I thought that dreams belonged to other men  
'Cause each time I got close, they'd fall apart again  
I thought my heart would beat in secrecy  
I faced the nights alone, oh how could I have known?  
That all my life I only needed you  
  
Woah, almost paradise  
We're knocking on heaven's door  
Almost paradise  
How could we ask for more?  
I swear that I could see forever in your eyes,  
Paradise  
  
It seems that perfect love's so hard to find  
I'd almost given up, you must have read my mind  
And all these dreams I save for a rainy day  
They're finally coming true, I'll share them all with you  
'Cause now we hold the future in our hands  
  
Woah, almost paradise  
We're knocking on heaven's door  
Almost paradise  
How could we ask for more?  
I swear that I could see forever in your eyes,  
Paradise  
  
And in your arms salvation's not so far away  
It's getting closer, closer every day  
  
Almost paradise  
We're knocking on heaven's door  
Almost paradise  
How could we ask for more?  
I swear that I could see forever in your eyes,  
Paradise  
Paradise  
Paradise
