Say the words, played the part.  
Gave the world and plus my heart.  
Did it all with a smile on my face  
  
Gave you love, mind and soul.  
Thought that it was mutual.  
I see now that that wasn't the case  
  
(Look at me now)  
Not exactly who I was when you last saw me.  
Baby I've grown into a man who knows the deal  
(playn around)  
With my emotions is a thing of the past,sorry.  
Said I become a bit too slick and that's for real.  
  
[Chorus]  
I was in love  
Silly me, silly me.  
I was what you wanted me to be  
But not anymore, not anymore.  
I was in love  
Silly you silly you  
I refuse to be your fool  
Not anymore  
  
Sugar what's with your eyes?  
Why do you look so surprised?  
Is it 'cause your game has no effect?  
( Girl it ain't working )  
And I've developed such a swagger,  
Sharp as a dagger and a mind that just won't fall for it.  
  
(Look at me now)  
Not exactly who I was when you last saw me.  
Baby I've grown into a man who knows the deal  
(playn around)  
My emotions is a thing of the past, sorry.  
Said I become a bit too slick and that's for real.  
Hey!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm glad you thought that  
I'm unhappy without you  
Glad you can see I'm fine hey!  
So what you coming round for baby?  
Girl I don't need you anymore  
  
[Chorus]
