I don't mind  
Stealing Bread  
From the mouths of decadence  
  
But I can't feed on the powerless  
When my cup's already overfilled  
But it's on the table,  
The fire's cooking  
And they're starving babies,  
And the slaves are all working  
  
Blood is on the table,  
The mouths are choking  
  
I'm going hungry  
  
I don't mind  
Stealing Bread  
From the mouths of decadence  
  
But I can't feed on the powerless  
When my cup's already overfilled  
But it's on the table,  
The fire's cooking  
And they're starving babies,  
And the slaves are all working  
  
And it's on the table,  
The mouths are choking  
  
I'm going hungry
