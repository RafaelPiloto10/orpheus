All I need is a place in my heart  
To keep me happy 'til the day I die  
All I want is a place in my soul  
To reach up far and touch the sky  
It's magic  
We've got the smile that'll make you laugh (ha)  
A special way to show you it's real  
Some people think it's a touch of class  
But you know it's just the way we feel  
It's magic  
We've got the magic, deep in our souls  
We've got the magic, to play rock-n-roll  
We've got the magic, to never grow old  
Can't you hear the sound, in the air  
Can't wait to show this magic inside  
Gonna bust out and spread it wide  
Can't you hear what we're trying to say  
Feeling's gettin' stronger everyday  
It's magic  
We've got the magic, deep in our souls  
We've got the magic, to play rock-n-roll  
We've got the magic, to never grow old  
Can't you hear the sound, in the air (whoa yeah)  
We've got the magic, deep in our souls (yeah)  
We've got the magic, to play rock-n-roll  
We've got the magic, we'll never grow old  
We've got the magic  
We've got the magic  
We've got the magic  
You've got the magic  
So take it on home  
We've got the magic, deep in our souls  
We've got the magic, to play rock-n-roll  
We've got the magic, it's magic, magic (whoa-oh)
