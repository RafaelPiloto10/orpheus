If you see some picture of us  
Lying on the bed  
Some old memory haunts you  
Gets stuck inside your head  
Don't get angry about it  
And wish we'd never been  
Don't get roped into a corner  
And try changing everything  
Don't get paralyzed with fear  
And stand there wondering  
What to do  
Just forget it girl  
And I will too  
  
If you're on our corner  
And you run into our friends  
If they ask about me  
Start wondering where I am  
Don't get angry about it  
Feel like you're caving in  
Don't start crying again  
And go and tell them everything  
Don't you walk away believing  
You will never make it through  
Just forget it girl  
And I will too  
  
If some rainy afternoon  
You're crying in your bed  
Cursing every detail  
Bout the day that we first met  
Don't get angry about it  
Start throwing everything  
Don't get struck dumb in your steps  
Each time you hear the doorbell ring  
Take some comfort in knowing  
These are things that I will do  
I can't forget it girl  
Though I try to  
I can't forget it girl  
Though I try to
