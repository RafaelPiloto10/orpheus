Hey listen don't you let 'em get your mind  
Fill your brain with orders and that's not right  
They're playing at a game that draws you closer  
Till you're living in a world that's ruled by fear  
  
Always takin' baby out that's o.k.  
What they're givin' maybe it's out of phase with me  
Told you once you're never gonna win the race  
Same old no tomorrow kicked in the face  
  
We are screaming for vengeance  
The world is a manacled place  
Screaming, screaming for vengeance  
The world is defiled in disgrace  
  
Tie a blindfold all around your head  
Spin you round in the torture before the dread  
And then you're pushed and shoved into every corner  
Then they lead you out into the final slaughter  
  
As the sweat is running down your neck  
All your praying for's to stop your body breakin' up  
Oh your heart is pumping gonna soon explode  
Got to fight the horror of this mental load  
  
We are screaming for vengeance  
The world is a manacled place  
Screaming, screaming for vengeance  
The world is defiled in disgrace  
  
So you wait it out and bide your time  
Rip off that straight jacket gotta break that line  
Everyone who wins in the great escape  
Leaves a thousand more who suffer in their wake  
  
I don't talk about it but that's alright  
Table's turned now there's a revenge in sight  
If it takes forever babe I tell ya I can wait  
Send them screaming back through their hell's own gate  
  
We are screaming for vengeance  
The world is a manacled place  
Screaming, screaming for vengeance  
The world is defiled in disgrace
