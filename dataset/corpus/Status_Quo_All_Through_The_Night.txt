All through the night, oh, all through the night  
All through the night, lonely day, lonely night  
  
All alone again, I never get my way  
I don't remember when it's never been the same  
I know what I've been looking for  
But now I know it's what I'm living for  
I want you back again  
I never get my way  
  
All through the night, oh, all through the night  
All through the night, lonely day, lonely night  
  
Once upon a time I didn't really care  
I loved so many times, but then I had my share  
I got a feeling here inside  
And now I know it's you that's on my mind  
I want you back again  
I never get my way  
  
All through the night, oh, all through the night  
All through the night, lonely day, lonely night  
All through the night, oh, all through the night  
All through the night, lonely day, lonely night  
  
Baby, baby, I just can't go on  
Baby, waiting, what might come along  
Baby, baby, I just hope that you know  
Baby, holding, I won't let you go  
  
All through the night, oh, all through the night  
All through the night, oh, all through the night  
All through the night, lonely day, lonely night  
All through the day, lonely night, lonely day  
All through the night, oh all through the night
