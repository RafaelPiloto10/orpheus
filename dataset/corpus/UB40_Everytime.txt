In a little while Verse One  
I'll be on my way  
Got no words to express  
What I need to say  
  
[Chorus]  
Everytime I think about the first time Chorus  
We said hello  
You know when you know  
You never let go  
  
It's just not my style Verse Two  
Something I can't do  
After all this time  
I'm scared of losing you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Is there anything Verse Three  
You could let me know  
Surely you could find me  
A reason not to go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
After everything Verse Four  
We've been going through  
I'm so up and down  
So dizzy and blue  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let me one more time Verse Five  
Look into your eyes  
I remember when  
There were no goodbyes  
  
[Chorus]
