Mystique our majesty, Goddess unwind  
Mystique of mind reveal, Mystique of mind  
Mystique our majesty, Goddess unwind  
Mystique my reveil  
Match the eyes of the dragon  
Catch the flames of breath  
Hypnotize reality  
And join in with the rest  
Chase the hunted magic  
And pray to its commands  
You think you winning flight control to OD land  
Bite the heart of the arrow  
Forget the purpose life  
Breaking in vein  
Injecting the knife  
Eagle eyes the challenge  
Regurgitating feast  
Yourself alive in mind  
And shell joins the deceased  
You can take all  
Reach your hand right out and sin  
Don't mistake it  
Kick the womb of the serpent  
Announce the arctic foul  
No mans dog but when he's gone you feel him growl  
Heat the the bowl of the chalice  
Release the virgins soul  
Every scent of innocence forever growing old  
Who awaits all  
Crawls through the pores of your skin  
Don't debate it  
Mystique to those unknown  
While all the mists arise  
Death deals in danger  
Take a look at your surprise  
Mystique our majesty collected I'm my mind  
Hell bent for mystery  
Goddess reveal unwind
