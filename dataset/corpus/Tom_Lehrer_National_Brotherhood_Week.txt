One week of every year is designated National Brotherhood Week. This is just
one of many such weeks honoring various worthy causes. One of my favorites is
National Make-fun-of-the-handicapped Week which Frank Fontaine and Jerry Lewis
are in charge of as you know. During National Brotherhood Week various special
events are arranged to drive home the message of brotherhood. This year, for
example, on the first day of the week Malcolm X was killed which gives you an
idea of how effective the whole thing is. I'm sure we all agree that we ought
to love one another and I know there are people in the world that do not love
their fellow human beings and I hate people like that. Here's a song about
National Brotherhood Week.  
  
Oh, the white folks hate the black folks,  
And the black folks hate the white folks.  
To hate all but the right folks  
Is an old established rule.  
  
But during National Brotherhood Week, National Brotherhood Week,  
Lena Horne and Sheriff Clarke are dancing cheek to cheek.  
It's fun to eulogize  
The people you despise,  
As long as you don't let 'em in your school.  
  
Oh, the poor folks hate the rich folks,  
And the rich folks hate the poor folks.  
All of my folks hate all of your folks,  
It's American as apple pie.  
  
But during National Brotherhood Week, National Brotherhood Week,  
New Yorkers love the Puerto Ricans 'cause it's very chic.  
Step up and shake the hand  
Of someone you can't stand.  
You can tolerate him if you try.  
  
Oh, the Protestants hate the Catholics,  
And the Catholics hate the Protestants,  
And the Hindus hate the Moslems,  
And everybody hates the Jews.  
  
But during National Brotherhood Week, National Brotherhood Week,  
It's National Everyone-smile-at-one-another-hood Week.  
Be nice to people who  
Are inferior to you.  
It's only for a week, so have no fear.  
Be grateful that it doesn't last all year!
