[Chorus]  
This time, this time I love you  
Last time, last time I hate you  
Next time, next time I need you  
Baby please don't go  
  
Remember when I met you  
School dress on  
I never could forget you  
And Baby now you're gone  
  
I'm goin' around, around today  
Just tryin' to find the truth  
It doesn't really matter anyway  
When I'm livin' without you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I said come on little darlin'  
Baby don't you see  
I'd never do you harmin', no  
It's just you and me  
  
I'm in the corner right now  
Waiting for your love  
You better make your choice now  
Before a push comes to a shove  
Yeah things seem kinda different  
It ain't the way it was  
Remember what your mama said  
The bond that lies is us  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm by the phone, I'm all alone  
Just waitin' and a prayin' that maybe you'll call  
I gotta know right now, should I stay around, should I stay a while  
Should I stand here crying or baby should I fly - yeah!  
  
Oh come on darlin', Don't you se and don't you know,  
I gotta have your lovin', now now I'll never let you go  
Tryin' to find that girl of mine  
She's so far away  
And I am cryin' - yeah!
