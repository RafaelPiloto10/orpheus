I can't get a girl  
'Cause I ain't got a car  
I can't get a car  
'Cause I ain't got a job  
I can't get a job  
'Cause I ain't got a car  
So I'm looking for a girl with a job and a car  
Don't you know where you are  
  
Lost in America  
  
I got a mom but I ain't got a dad  
My dad's got a wife but she ain't my mom  
Mom's looking for a man to be my dad  
But I want my mom and dad to be my real  
mom and dad  
Is that so bad  
Oh, I think I've been had  
  
Lost in America  
  
Well, I live at the 7-11  
Well, I'm tryin' to play this guitar  
Well, I'm learning "Stairway to Heaven"  
'cause Heaven's where you are  
  
I can't go to school  
'Cause I ain't got a gun  
I ain't got a gun  
'Cause I ain't got a job  
I ain't got a job  
'Cause I can't go to school  
So I'm looking for a girl with a gun and a job  
Don't you know where you are  
  
Lost in America
