My fingers walk all over you  
I won't stop before you scream  
Cause I love you  
Cause I love you  
I feel your body on my skin  
You're the goddess of my dreams  
Cause I love you  
Cause I love you  
  
You're the sting that's in my flesh  
When I am feelin down and low  
That's why I love you  
That's why I love you  
I make you scream I make you cry  
With all my heart and soul  
That's why I love you  
That's why I love you  
  
She's the one who is crying we're flying  
She cries bitter tears when I'm blue  
She's the one who is screaming I'm dreaming  
Tonight I will reach  
Out for you, out for you  
Totally electric fire  
When I hold you in my arms  
Cause I love you  
  
Cause I love you  
The only true love of my life  
You're the owner of my heart  
Cause I love you  
Yes I love you  
She's the one who is crying we're flying  
We fly on the way to the stars  
She's the one who is screaming I'm dreaming  
When I reach you with my guitar  
My guitar, my guitar
