Like the beat, beat, beat of the tomtom  
When the jungle shadows fall  
Like the tick, tick, tock of the stately clock  
as it stands against the wall  
Like the drip, drip, drip of the raindrops  
When the summer show'are is through  
So a voice within me keeps repeating  
You, you, you  
  
Night and day you are the one  
Only you beneath the moon and sun  
Whether near me or far  
It's no matter, darling, where you are  
I think of you  
Night and day  
Day and night  
  
Why is it so  
That this longing for you follows wherever I go  
In the roaring traffic's boom  
In the silence of my lonely room  
I think of you  
Night and day  
  
Night and day under the hide of me  
There's an Oh, such a hungry yearning  
Burning inside of me  
And its torment won't be trough  
'Till you spent my life making love to you  
Day and night  
Night and day  
Night and day
