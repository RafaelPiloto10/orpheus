In the summertime  
The taxman's taken all my dough  
And left me in my stately home  
Lazing on a sunny afternoon  
And I can't sail my yacht  
  
He's taken everything I've got  
All I've got's this sunny afternoon  
Save me, from this squeeze  
I've got a big fat momma tryin' to break me  
And I love to live so pleasantly  
  
Live this life of luxury  
Lazing on a sunny afternoon  
In the summertime  
In the summertime  
In the summertime (everything seems fine)  
  
My girlfriend's gone off with my car  
And gone back to her ma and pa  
Telling tales of drunkenness and cruelty  
And now I'm sitting here  
Sipping on my ice cold beer  
  
Lazing on a sunny afternoon  
Help me, sail away  
Give me two good reasons why I ought to stay  
'Cause I love to live so pleasantly  
  
Live this life of luxury  
Lazing on a sunny afternoon  
In the summertime  
Everything is fine because it's the summertime  
  
In the summertime  
(I don't care about a doggone thing)  
In the summertime  
(I'm broke, I've skint, but it's the summertime)  
In the summertime  
(even though I ain't got a dime, in the summertime, I don't have a dime)  
In the summertime  
(I just got this ice cold beer, everything seems fine)  
In the summertime  
(Nothing seems to matter)
