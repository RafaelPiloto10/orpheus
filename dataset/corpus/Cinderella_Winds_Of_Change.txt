I look into the mirror  
Can almost count the years  
The memories are clearer  
Of all those things I feared  
  
I watch the time pass slowly  
It comes and goes like the waves  
The sea can touch the sky at night  
It's got the freedom I crave  
  
I'm going through changes in my life  
I'm going through changes  
It'll be alright  
  
Look into a picture  
A thousand years are told  
Now is it any wonder  
What our tomorrows hold  
  
Our yesterdays are over  
You know they go so fast  
If I could rule the winds of change  
You know I'd make it all last  
  
I'm going through changes in my life  
I'm going through changes  
It'll be alright  
Alright  
  
I walked alone through the blackest night  
I felt the cold, I felt the bite  
I took the high road but it ain't right  
It's just the low road in disguise  
  
I'm going through changes  
Ah yea  
Everything's gonna be alright, yea  
  
Got to the top of an uphill climb  
Only to look down the other side  
Just when you think it's on your side  
This world will show you ain't no reason to the rhyme  
  
I'm going through changes  
Ah yea  
Everything's gonna be alright  
  
Times keep a changing every day  
Watch out now cause it's heading your way  
Ah yea  
Seems like the world turned upside down  
Seems like everything's falling down  
But it's all getting better every day  
Watch out now cause a good times heading our way  
Ah, every day  
Every day  
Every day  
Every day  
Every day  
Every day
