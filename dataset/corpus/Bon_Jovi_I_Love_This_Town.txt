I always knew, that I'd like this place  
You don't have to look too far, to find a friendly face  
I feel alive when I'm walkin' on this street  
I feel the heart of the city poundin' underneath my feet  
  
[Chorus:]  
Yeah let the world keep spinnin' round 'n' round  
This is where it all goes down, down, down  
That's why I love this town  
That's why I keep comin' 'round  
  
Say hey (Say hey) say yeah (Say yeah)  
You make me feel at home some how, right now  
That's why I love this town  
  
I've got some good friends here, I might have broke a heart or two  
It's gettin' loud over there, boys must have had a few  
And hey the cop on the corner, he knows everybody's name  
And a kid with a train singin' for some spare loose change  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Say hey (Say hey) say yeah (Say yeah)  
You make me feel at home some how, right now  
That's why I love this town  
  
There's shoutin' from the rooftops  
Dancin' on the bars  
Hangin' out the window  
Drivin' in their famous cars  
You want it? You got it  
You ready? I'm on it  
Come on now, here we go again...  
  
That's why I love this town  
That's why I love this town  
  
No matter where you're from, tonight you're from right here  
This is where it all goes down, down, down  
That's why I love this town  
  
Say hey (Say hey) say yeah (Say yeah)  
I love this town  
Say hey (Say hey) say yeah (Say yeah)  
I love this town  
Say hey (Say hey) say yeah (Say yeah)  
I love this town  
Say hey (Say hey) say yeah (Say yeah)  
I love this town
