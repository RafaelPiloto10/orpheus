We search for outside conclusions to questions we have inside  
We search for logical solutions to problems we cannot hide  
We hope and pray the curse of war will be undone  
And that the world will be as one  
But we can't change it on our own, it takes more  
Chorus:  
Then and only then can we live in perfect harmony  
Only if and when we sacrifice our comfort for the least of these  
Get together down on our knees and pray God give us peace  
Then and only then  
We need to stop looking on ourselves and look to the One who know all  
He has the answers that can rebuild us, a foundation that will not fall  
We hope and pray the curse of hate will be no more  
But it may be different  
At least we know what the power of prayer is for, let's unite  
(chorus)  
We know it's gonna take time to get it together, to follow it through  
But if we try a little bit harder, just think what we could do  
If we only knew  
(chorus out)
