I'm twelve o'clock,  
All daylight hours,  
I'll warm your bed,  
I'll grow your flowers.  
Like I'm a miniature sun.  
This ball ignited when she told me I was her only one.  
  
I'm not the same now.  
I'm not that plain little boy.  
I'm all aflame now.  
I'm king up here like a miniature sun.  
  
No life comes close,  
I'm rising higher,  
On holiday,  
On ball of fire,  
You made a miniature sun.  
There's no more shadows in this world she says I'm her only one.  
  
I'm not the same now.  
I'm not that plain little boy.  
I'm all aflame now.  
I radiate like a miniature sun.  
  
Now everything looks right today,  
A billion watts of bright today.  
And I'm a blazing kite today.  
I think I'll float around her house,  
And tell her exactly how she makes me glow.  
But then the other man leaving merely doffs his hat,  
And I'm the last to know.  
  
Now everything looks wrong today.  
An out of tune sung song today.  
I've grown from big King Kong today,  
Right down to miniature...  
  
Don't come too close,  
I'll burn your arm,  
I'll bleach your hair,  
Dustbowl your farm,  
I'll blind your eyes,  
You blinded mine,  
I'll spin with rage,  
All summertime,  
You made a miniature sun.  
Just take a look up in the nightsky, I'm not the only one.  
  
I'm not the same now.  
I'm not that vain little boy that I was.  
I'm all to blame now,  
Look out below here I come!  
  
Man crashing down like a miniature sun
