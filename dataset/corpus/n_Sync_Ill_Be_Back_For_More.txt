Baby, trust me  
i know you're shy  
But when you're with me  
i see the love in your eyes  
tell me why can't you see the way it feels  
and if our love is real  
say you'll love me  
forever and ever  
  
Chorus:  
Cause i'll be back for more  
Lady, i'll be back for more  
Why can't you say  
That you feel the same way  
Lady, i'll be back for more  
  
You say, you're afraid you'll get burned again  
but baby, i pray that someday  
you'll let my love in  
i can't wait  
tell me how you really feel  
and say our love is real  
say you'll love me forever and ever  
  
Chorus:  
I'll be back for more  
Baby, i'll be back for more  
Why can't you say  
you feel the same way  
Baby, i'll be back for more  
  
Oh baby, Just let me know (Just let me know)  
Girl, if you love me  
you've got to let it show (Just let it show)  
I'm down on my knees  
I'm begging you please  
  
I'll be back for more  
I'll be back for more  
Why can't you say  
you feel the same way  
Lady, i'll be back for more  
  
And i will be back for more...
