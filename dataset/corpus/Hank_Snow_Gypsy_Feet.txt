Gypsy feet will wander Gypsy feet will stray  
Neither love nor thunder can ever make them stay  
I can't tame a heart so wild like a jungle drum it beats  
Were you born a devil child with the restless gypsy feet  
Gypsy feet keep dancing to the tune of violin  
Just like devil's prancing you dance away your sins  
If I could tame your restless heart would make my life complete  
But I can't put an anchor on your gypsy feet  
  
My picture's in your locket on that golden chain  
Money's in your pocket and you're gone again  
Gypsy lips will promise vows that they never keep  
Hearts like mine are crumbled beneath your gypsy feet  
Gypsy feet keep dancing...
