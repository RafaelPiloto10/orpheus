When the storms of the day have all blown away  
Along with fair weather friends  
There's a place I can go where the wind doesn't blow  
It's the best place I've ever been  
  
You're a sight for sore eyes  
When I need a friend  
You're a sight for sore eyes  
Let the healing begin  
  
When the chips are all down and there's no one around  
To count on like I count on you  
I just picture your face and let it erase  
All the pain I'm goin' through  
  
You're a sight for sore eyes  
When I need a friend  
You're a sight for sore eyes  
Let the healing begin  
  
When I get lost and I can't find my way  
And there's nowhere to turn at the end of the day  
  
You're a sight for sore eyes  
When I need a friend  
You're a sight for sore eyes  
Let the healing begin  
  
You're a sight for sore eyes  
Let the healing begin
