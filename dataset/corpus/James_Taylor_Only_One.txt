You are my only one, you are my only one.  
Well I'm telling you now, you're my only one.  
  
I've got two long legs like to carry me,  
Two sharp eyes to look for the fight.  
Two strong arms to hold on tight,  
Two good friends on my left and right,  
But only one only one.  
You are my only one, you are my only one.  
Don't be leaving me now, you're my only one.  
  
There's only one road before me,  
Too many turns in the way,  
Thousands of things to do today.  
Millions of moments, I must admit,  
But only one, only one.  
You are my only one, you are my only one.  
Don't be leaving me now, you're my only one.  
  
Taken for granted and pushed aside,  
All that it wanted was a place to run and hide.  
Missing message in a hollow tree,  
Hidden deep inside a memory  
And the memory seems like dreams.  
Hundreds of hopes in the past,  
Nevertheless it was never the last.  
Hold on strong or you fade out fast  
And only one only one.  
You are my only one, you are my only one.  
Don't be leaving me now, you're my only one.
