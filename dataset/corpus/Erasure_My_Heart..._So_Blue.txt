I've got her picture  
It's there on the wall  
I can't remember why  
I keep it at all  
The doors are cold and  
All the windows seem gray  
I write the book  
There's so much more I should say  
  
[Chorus]  
Wave goodbye  
See my heart, so blue  
Wave goodbye  
See my heart, so blue  
  
And now it's over  
I write it all down  
No one to notice  
One less face in the crowd  
Our eyes are open  
When it suits us to say  
Dear god in heaven  
Show no mercy to me  
  
Wave (wave) goodbye  
See my heart, so blue  
Wave (wave) goodbye  
Lost for you  
  
I shed no tears  
And there's no reason for shame  
A small consolation  
Hides a stone with her name  
Just a victim  
Still the light shines all bright  
I've got her picture  
Think I'll hold it tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Wave (wave) goodbye  
See my heart, so blue  
Wave (wave) goodbye  
Lost for you
