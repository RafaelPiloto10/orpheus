Drop me off in Harlem  
Any place in Harlem  
There's someone waiting there  
Who makes it seem like Heaven up in Harlem  
  
I don't want your Dixie  
You can keep your Dixie  
There's no one down in Dixie  
Who can take me 'way from my hot Harlem  
  
Harlem has those southern skies  
They're in my baby's smile  
I idolize my baby's eyes  
And classy up-town style  
  
If Harlem moved to China  
I know of nothing finer  
Than to stow away on a 'plane some day  
And have them drop me off in Harlem

If Harlem moved to China  
I know of nothing finer  
Than to stow away on a 'plane some day  
And have them drop me off in Harlem  
  
If Harlem moved to China  
I know nothing finer than to be in Harlem
