Said the nightwind to the little lamb  
Do you see what I see  
Way up in the sky little lamb  
Do you see what I see  
  
A star, a star, dancing in the night  
with a tail as big as a kite  
with a tail as big as a kite  
  
Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy  
Do you hear what I hear  
Ringing through the sky shepherd boy  
Do you hear what I hear  
  
A song, a song, high above the trees  
with a voice as big as the sea  
with a voice as big as the sea  
  
Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king  
Do you know what I know  
In your palace oh mighty king  
Do you know what I know  
  
A child, a child, shivers in the cold  
Let us bring him silver and gold  
Let us bring him silver and gold  
  
Said the king to the people everywhere  
Listen to what I say  
Pray for peace people everywhere  
Listen to what I say  
  
A child, a child, sleeping in the night  
he will bring us goodness and light  
he will bring us goodness and light  
  
Do you hear what I hear  
A child, a child, sleeping in the night  
he will bring us goodness and light  
he will bring us goodness and light  
  
Listen  
Do you hear what I hear  
Do you hear what I hear  
Listen
