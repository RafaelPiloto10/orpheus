It was rainin' in heaven when you went down  
You were better than the best  
Stayed a notch above the rest  
It was rainin' in heaven when you went down  
  
Your mother cried, said she told you so  
But you touched the devil and couldn't let go  
(Yeah)  
No one controls the Outlaw  
  
You wrote the story with the movie in mind  
An angel face with a criminal side  
Celebraed as the rebel kind  
The Outlaw  
  
I wonder if you knew  
They would turn your bad deeds into good  
Paint you as a modern robinhood  
  
It's high noon  
Everywhere you go  
And the guilt you feel is the weary soul  
(Yeah)  
Of the Outlaw  
  
Hearts weren't made to be ruled  
And rules weren't made to be broken  
It's cold and lonely at the end of your life  
And nobody sleeps 'til they turn out the lights  
For the Outlaw  
  
Where you gonna go, where you gonna hide  
It's cold and lonely for the Outlaw  
Where you gonna go, where you gonna hide  
As the Outlaw
