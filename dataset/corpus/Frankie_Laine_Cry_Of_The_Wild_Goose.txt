My heart knows what the wild goose knows  
And I must go where the wild goose goes  
Wild goose, brother goose, which is best?  
A wandering fool or a heart at rest?  
  
Tonight I heard the wild goose cry  
Hanging north in the lonely sky  
Tried to sleep, it wasn't no use  
Cause I am a brother to the old wild goose  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
(Oh, my heart knows what the wild goose knows)  
(And I must go where the wild goose goes)  
Wild goose, brother goose, which is best?  
A wandering fool or a heart at rest?  
  
Woman was kind and true to me  
She thinks she loves me, more fool she!  
She's got a love that ain't no use  
To love a brother of the old wild goose  
  
The cabin is warm and the snow is deep  
And I got a woman who lies asleep  
She'll wake up tomorrow's dawn  
And find, poor critter, that her man is gone  
  
(Oh, my heart knows what the wild goose knows)  
(And I must go where the wild goose goes)  
(Wild goose, brother goose, which is best?)  
(A wandering fool or a heart at rest?)  
  
Let me fly, let me fly, let me fly away  
  
Spring is coming and the ice will break  
And I can't linger for a woman's sake  
She'll see a shadow pass overhead  
And she'll find a feather 'side her bed
