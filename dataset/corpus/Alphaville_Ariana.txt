Driving down the streets, listening to the radio  
What do I get: ariana  
Reading the papers and the news they scream  
Haven't you heard: ariana  
She rules the business, she's sucha restless genuine juvenile  
Everyone knows, wherever she goes  
She got chique, she got class, she got style  
Arianamaniacs rulr the world, haven't you heard  
Arianamania sets the scenes on fire  
We're goin' nutz for ariana  
We're goin' carazzy forrr herrr  
Everything glows, wherever she goes  
She got sex from her lips to her toes  
All the casanovas, even zombies agree  
With the hummingbirds and the beasts from the sea  
Ariana's a real sensation  
When will she be on the screeeeeen
