Monday finds you like a bomb  
That's been left ticking there too long  
You're bleeding  
Some days there's nothing left to learn  
From the point of no return  
You're leaving  
  
Hey Hey I saved the world today  
Everybody's happy now  
The bad thing's gone away  
And everybody's happy now  
The good thing's here to stay  
Please let it stay  
  
There's a million mouths to feed  
And I've got everything I need  
I'm breathing  
And there's a hurting thing inside  
But I've got everything to hide  
I'm grieving  
  
Hey Hey I saved the world today  
Everybody's happy now  
The bad thing's gone away  
And everybody's happy now  
The good thing's here to stay  
Please let it stay  
  
Let it stay  
Let it stay  
Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo the good thing  
  
Hey Hey I saved the world today  
Everybody's happy now  
The bad thing's gone away  
And everybody's happy now  
The good thing's here to stay  
Please let it stay  
  
Hey Hey I saved the world today (Everybody's happy now)  
Everybody's happy now  
The bad thing's gone away (Everybody's happy now)  
And everybody's happy now  
The good thing's here to stay  
Please let it, oh let it
