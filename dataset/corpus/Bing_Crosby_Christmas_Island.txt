How'd ja like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island?  
How'd ja like to spend the Holiday away across the sea?  
How'd ja like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island?  
How'd ja like to hang your stockin' on a great big coconut tree?  
  
How'd ja like to stay up late, like the islanders do  
Wait for Santa to sail in with your presents in a canoe  
If you ever spend Christmas on Christmas Island  
You will never stray, for ev'ry day  
Your Christmas dreams come true  
  
How'd ja like to stay up late, like the islanders do  
Wait for Santa to sail in with your presents in a canoe  
If you ever spend Christmas on Christmas Island  
You will never stray, for ev'ry day  
Your Christmas dreams come true
