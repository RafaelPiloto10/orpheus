I'll be loving you eternally (eternally)  
With a love that's true, eternally (eternally)  
From the start, within my heart  
It seems I've always known  
The sun would shine (shine)  
When you were mine (mine)  
And mine alone. (mine alone.)  
  
I'll be loving you eternally (eternally)  
There'll be no one new, my dear, for me (eternally)  
Though the sky should fall  
Remember I shall always be  
Forever true (true)  
And loving you (you)  
Eternally...
