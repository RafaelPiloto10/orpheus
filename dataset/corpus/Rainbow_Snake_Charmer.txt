Old hollow eyes  
Got no ties  
Walking by the light of the moon  
  
Hey shiny boots  
With strings and flutes  
Rising like a crazy balloon  
  
Close your door  
He's on the loose  
Umm, here he comes  
No hope for you, ooh  
Snake charmer, we'll haunt you  
  
So, hey mystery man  
What's your plan  
I've got to tell the world  
To beware you don't care  
  
He'll hypnotize you  
And tell you lies  
He's hiding at the top of the stairs  
  
Close your door  
He's on the move  
I see him coming out  
There's no hope for you, ooh  
Snake charmer  
Snake charmer  
Get out!  
  
Hey fancy face  
Got no place  
Living from a hole in the ground  
  
Old sparkle eyes  
He never cries  
One step ahead of the hounds  
  
Close your door  
He's on his way  
He's coming out of the shadows now, now  
No hope for you, ooh  
Snake charmer  
Snake charmer, now listen to me yeah  
  
Hey hollow eyes  
Got no ties  
Oh shiny boots  
Play your strings and flutes  
  
Mystery man what's your plan  
Fancy face, got no place  
Snake charmer  
He'll harm ya  
  
Oh sparkle eyes  
Got no ties  
Oh shiny boots  
Close your door  
He's on the loose  
Snake charmer  
My mystery man what's your plan  
I've got to tell the world to beware  
You don't care  
Hypnotized
