Chorus  
For the Lord is good  
And his mercy endureth  
His love is everlasting  
Goes one all day  
For the Lord is good  
And his mercy endureth  
Forevermore  
  
Verse 1  
When I was lost, you saw me  
From sinking sand, you brought me  
Lord through your word, You taught me  
That your love will never end  
You sent your Son, to save me  
And all of my sins, forgave me  
And Lord who I am, you made me  
And now I can say  
  
Bridge  
He's so good  
So Good, so good  
So good to me
