Don't count your chickens  
'Cause they're never gonna hatch  
You can't catch a monkey with a shotgun and a sack  
'cause you're too dull baby  
You can't see the wood for the trees  
'Cause you're too slow baby  
You just couldn't get off your knees  
Don't count your chickens  
'Cause they're never gonna hatch  
You can't catch a monkey with a shotgun and a sack  
'Cause you're too dull baby  
You can't see the wood for the trees  
'Cause you're too slow baby  
You just couldn't get off your knees  
  
I can see the love and the hate in your eyes  
Penny for the thoughts behind your disguise  
What you gonna do and what you gonna say?  
I'm not the only one believing there's an easier way  
  
It doesn't pay to disorientate me  
It doesn't cost to be someone  
I am the vine  
And you're the branches  
  
Don't knock a young man  
you don't know what he'll get done  
You can't kick and old man see what he's become  
You are far too lazy  
You stick to your pillow with ease  
'Cause you're much too lazy  
you just couldn't get off your knees  
  
I can see the love and the hate in your eyes  
Penny for the thoughts behind your disguise  
What you gonna do and what you gonna say?  
I'm not the only one believing there's an easier way  
  
It doesn't pay to disorientate me  
It doesn't cost to be someone  
I am the vine  
And you're the branches  
  
Don't count your chickens  
'Cause they're never gonna hatch  
You can't catch a monkey with a shotgun and a sack  
'Cause you're too dull baby  
You can't see the wood for the trees  
'Cause you're too slow baby  
You just couldn't get off your knees  
  
I can see the love and the hate in your eyes  
Penny for the thoughts behind your disguise  
What you gonna do and what you gonna say?  
I'm not the only one believing there's an easier way  
What'ya gonna do with the rest of your life  
Penny for the thoughts behind your disguise  
  
I am the vine  
And you're the branches
