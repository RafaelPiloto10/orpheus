Too much time talking at each other  
Seems you've got a different point of view  
Let's just relax, get down to basic facts  
I'll tell you just exactly what to do  
You want the car, oh, yeah  
Well, every penny in my pocket isn't yours, my friend  
I'm gonna do what my mama says, oh, she said  
Hit, hit him in the heart  
That's where it's gonna hurt  
Hit, hit him in the heart  
Don't let him treat you like dirt, ooh  
I don't want to sound like I'm complainin'  
But what's it got to do with love at all?  
It's a private deal, it's painful and so real  
You make me feel like I just want to crawl  
What's yours is yours, oh, yeah  
If you wanna get your bags, well, I'll leave them in the hall  
I'm gonna do what my mama says, oh, oh, she said  
Hit, hit him in the heart  
That's where it's gonna hurt  
Hit, hit him in the heart  
Don't let him treat you like dirt, ooh, aah  
This is what you gotta do  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
You've been spreading rumors all about me  
But all these things you said are just not true  
Sticks and stones can break my bones  
But boy, they're gonna hurt you too  
I've got my pride, oh, yeah  
So I'll just take your heart and beat it black and blue  
I'm gonna do what my mama said, mama said, she said  
Hit, hit him in the heart  
That's where it's gonna hurt  
Hit, hit him in the heart  
Don't let him treat you like dirt, no  
Hit, hit him in the heart  
That's where it's gonna hurt  
Hit, hit him in the heart  
Don't let him treat you like dirt, oh  
Oh, no  
[Incomprehensible]  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Don't let him treat you like dirt  
[Incomprehensible]
