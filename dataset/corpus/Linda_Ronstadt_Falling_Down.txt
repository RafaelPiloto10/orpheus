I'm falling down  
I need to sleep  
Come a long long way  
No time for weepin  
No time for weepin  
Quiet now I'm falling down  
I'm falling down  
I have heard  
A million tales  
I have told  
A million more  
Some of them  
Must have been true  
But I don't know anymore  
I'm falling down  
Do your dance on my head  
Heavy steps of the dead  
Everything the snow surrounds  
Falling, falling, falling, falling  
Falling, falling down  
I'm falling down
