Mother was an incubator  
Father was the contents  
Of a test tube in the ice box  
In the factory of birth  
  
My name is 905,  
And I've just become alive  
I'm the newest populator  
Of the planet we call Earth  
  
In suspended animation  
My childhood passed me by  
If I speak without emotion  
Then you know the reason why  
  
Knowledge of the universe  
Was fed into my mind  
As my adolescent body  
Left its puberty behind  
  
And everything I know is what I need to know  
And everything I do's been done before  
Every sentence in my head  
Someone else has said  
At each end of my life is an open door  
  
Automatically defrosted  
When manhood came on time  
I became a man  
I left the "ice school" behind  
  
Now I'm to begin  
The life that I'm assigned  
A life that's been used before  
A thousand times  
  
I have a feeling deep inside  
That somethin' is missing  
It's a feeling in my soul  
And I can't help wishing  
  
That one day I'll discover  
That we're living a lie  
And I'll tell the whole world  
The reason why  
  
Well, until then, everything I know is what I need to know  
And everything I do's been done before  
Every sentence in my head  
Someone else has said  
At each end of my life is an open door
