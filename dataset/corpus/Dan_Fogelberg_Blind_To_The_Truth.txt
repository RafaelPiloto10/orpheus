In the overcrowded cities  
Where the nights are bright as day  
You spend your weekly paycheck  
And turn your eyes away  
From the crisis we've created  
With our self-indulgent ways  
Living like there's no tomorrow  
Well that just might be the case.  
  
Now they're tearing down the forests  
In the jungles of Brazil  
Without a second thought about  
The species that they kill  
But extinction is forever  
And still the forests fall  
And push it ever closer to  
Extinction for us all.  
  
But you're so blind to the truth  
Blind to the truth  
And you can't see nothin'  
You're so blind to the truth  
Blind to the truth  
But the judgment day is coming.  
  
Now the politicians bicker  
On the early evening news  
Pledging their allegiance  
To whoever they can use  
And the corporate bosses snicker  
As they watch the profits soar  
They don't care what they make next month  
Just as long as it is more.  
  
The take our farms and marshlands  
Drive nature to the wall  
Just so they can build another  
Goddamn shopping mall  
And it doesn't seem to matter  
If we cannot see the stars  
Just as long as they can keep  
On building obsolescent cars  
'Cause they're so  
  
But you're so blind to the truth  
Blind to the truth  
And you can't see nothin'  
You're so blind to the truth  
Blind to the truth  
But the judgment day is coming.  
  
Now you cannot drink the water  
And you cannot breathe the air  
The sky is ripping open and you  
Still don't seem to care  
The soil is tired and toxic  
And unable to provide  
The clock is running out and  
There is nowhere left to hid.  
  
Now there's laws that we must live by  
And they're not the laws of man  
Can't you see the shadow  
That moves across this land  
The future is upon us  
And there's so much we must do  
And you know I can't ignore it  
And, my friend, neither can you  
Unless you're  
  
But you're so blind to the truth  
Blind to the truth  
And you can't see nothin'  
You're so blind to the truth  
Blind to the truth  
But the judgment day is coming.
