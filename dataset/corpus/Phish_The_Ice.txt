I press on the elastic sheet, I'm breathing through the slice  
'Are they worms or are they serpents? ' bubbles through the ice  
The source was quite invisible, the ever-present voice  
While skating, both legs tracing different shapes, I made my choice  
  
Mimicking the image in whose radiance at bask  
I'm tied to him, or him to me, with anything you ask  
None the less reluctantly reflections tumble in  
I slide with all the other on the wrong side of the skin  
  
He's falling on the ice, it cracks  
Will he plunge in and join me here?  
He meets my eyes, to my surprise  
He laughs in full light of my frown  
My double wants to pull me down  
  
Slipping on the friction slide, my skin peels to the bone  
The flesh I leave behind, is something that is not my own  
I beg my mirror image for a moment with my soul  
He's bleeding back, time to attack, it's me who's in control  
  
But every move I make he's got a hand up just in time  
He's throwing several punches, and he's blocking most of mine  
Defeated now I sulk and squirm in pollen and frozen mice  
Waiting, calculating till next he ventures on the ice.
