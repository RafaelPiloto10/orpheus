Don't you feel a change a coming  
From another side of time  
Breaking down the walls of silence  
Lifting shadows from your mind  
Placing back the missing mirrors  
That before you couldn't find  
Filling mysteries of emptiness  
That yesterday left behind  
  
And we all know it's better  
Yesterday has past  
Now let's all start the living  
For the one that's going to last  
Yes we all know it's better  
Yesterday has past  
Now let's all start living  
For the one that's going to last  
  
Don't you feel the day is coming  
That will stay and remain  
When your children see the answers  
That you saw the same  
When the clouds have all gone  
There will be no more rain  
And the beauty of all things  
Is uncovered again  
  
And we all know it's better  
Yesterday has past  
Now let's all start the living  
For the one that's going to last  
Yes we all know it's better  
Yesterday has past  
Now let's all start living  
For the one that's going to last  
  
Don't you feel the day is coming  
And it won't be too soon  
When the people of the world  
Can all live in one room  
When we shake off the ancient  
Shake off the ancient chains of our tomb  
We will all be born again  
Of the eternal womb  
  
And we all know it's better  
Yesterday has past  
Now let's all start the living  
For the one that's going to last  
Yes we all know it's better  
Yesterday has past  
Now let's all start living  
For the one that's going to last  
  
Let's all start living  
Let's all start living, living, living, living  
For the one that's going last  
(The one that's going to last)  
(The one that's going to last)
