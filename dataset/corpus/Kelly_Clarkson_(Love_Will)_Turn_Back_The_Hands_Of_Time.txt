[Kelly]  
No more midnight rides with you  
No more secret rendezvous  
I'm gonna miss all the things we'll never do  
I just can't believe you left me here alone  
How in this world can I make it on my own  
  
[Kalan]  
Remember I love you, I won't be far away  
Baby, close your eyes and think of yesterday  
And we'll be there together  
Love will turn back the hands of time  
Whoa oh turn back  
Whoa oh turn back the hands of time  
  
[Kelly]  
Whoa oh baby don't you know it's hard to let you go  
  
[Kalan]  
Save all your dreams and keep me in your heart  
  
[Kelly]  
It hurts to say goodbye no matter how I try  
  
[Kalan]  
Love will survive even though we have to part  
  
[Spoken]  
  
Stephanie please don't cry.  
[Kelly]  
Oh, it all seems so unfair, just when I found you I lost you.  
[Kalan]  
That doesn't matter now,  
The only thing that matters is the time we had together.  
[Kelly]  
But I don't even know your name.  
[Kalan]  
The only thing you have to know is that I love you  
And you're the only one that can keep our love alive.  
So Stephanie, don't forget me.  
Kelly:  
I promise.  
  
[Kalan]  
Remember I love you, you won't be far away  
  
[Kelly]  
I just close my eyes, and bring back yesterday  
Kelly and Kalan:  
And we'll be there together  
Love will turn back the hands of time  
Whoa oh turn back  
Whoa oh turn back the hands of time  
Whoa oh turn back  
Whoa oh turn back the hands of time  
  
We'll turn back
