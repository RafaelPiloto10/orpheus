[Bamatabois is a well dressed gentleman.]  
  
Bamatabois  
Here's something new, I think I'll give it a try.  
Come closer you! I like to see what I buy  
The usual price, for just a slice of your pie  
  
Fantine  
I don't want you, no, no, M'sieur, let me go.  
  
Bamatabois  
Is this a trick? I won't pay more!  
  
Fantine  
No, not at all.  
  
Bamatabois  
You've got some nerve, you little whore  
You've got some gall.  
It's the same with a tart as it is with a grocer  
The customer sees what he gets in advance  
It's not for the whore to say 'yes sir' or 'no sir'  
It's not for the harlot to pick and to choose  
Or lead me to a dance!  
  
[He hits her with his stick, she claws at his face, drawing blood.]  
  
Fantine  
I'll kill you, you bastard, try any of that!  
Even a whore who has gone to the bad  
Won't be had by a rat!  
  
Bamatabois  
By Christ you'll pay for what you have done  
This rat will make you bleed, you'll see!  
I guarantee, I'll make you suffer  
For this disturbance of the peace  
For this insult to life and property!  
  
Fantine  
I beg you, don't report me sir  
I'll do whatever you may want  
  
Bamatabois  
Make your excuse to the police!  
  
[Javert enters, accompanied by constables.]  
  
Javert  
Tell me quickly what's the story  
Who saw what and why and where  
Let him give a full description  
Let him answer to Javert!  
In this nest of whores and vipers  
Let one speak who saw it all  
Who laid hands on this good man here?  
What's the substance of this brawl?  
  
Bamatabois  
Javert, would you believe it  
I was crossing from the park  
When this prostitute attacked me  
You can see she left her mark  
  
Javert  
She will answer for her actions  
When you make a full report  
You may rest assured, M'sieur,  
That she will answer to the court.  
  
Fantine  
There's a child who sorely needs me  
Please M'sieur, she's but that high  
Holy God, is there no mercy?  
If I go to jail she'll die!  
  
Javert  
I have heard such protestations  
Every day for twenty years  
Let's have no more explanations  
Save your breath and save your tears  
Honest work, just reward,  
That's the way to please the Lord.  
  
[Fantine gives a last despairing cry as she is arrested. Valjean emerges from
the crowd.]  
  
Valjean  
A moment of your time, Javert  
I do believe this woman's tale  
  
Javert  
But M'sieur Mayor!  
  
Valjean  
You've done your duty  
Let her be  
She needs a doctor, not a jail.  
  
Javert  
But M'sieur Mayor!  
  
Fantine  
Can this be?  
  
Valjean  
Where will she end -  
This child without a friend?  
I've seen your face before  
Show me some way to help you  
How have you come to grief  
In a place such as this?  
  
Fantine  
M'sieur, don't mock me now, I pray  
It's hard enough I've lost my pride  
You let your foreman send me away  
Yes, you were there, and turned aside  
I never did no wrong  
  
Valjean  
Is it true, what I have done?  
To an innocent soul?  
Had I only known then... Fantine  
My daughter's close to dying  
If there's a God above  
He'd let me die instead  
  
Valjean  
In His name my task has just begun  
I will see it done!  
I will see it done!  
  
Javert  
But M'sieur Mayor!  
  
Valjean  
I will see it done!  
  
Javert  
But M'sieur Mayor!  
  
Voices  
Look out! It's a runaway cart!
