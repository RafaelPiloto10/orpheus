[Chorus]  
I've had choices  
Since the day that I was born  
There were voices  
That told me right from wrong  
If I had listened  
No I wouldn't be here today  
Living and dying  
With the choices I made  
  
I was tempted  
By an early age I found  
I liked drinkin'  
Oh, and I never turned it down  
There were loved ones  
But I turned them all away  
Now I'm living and dying  
With the choices I made  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I guess I'm payin'  
For the things that I have done  
If I could go back  
Oh, Lord knows I'd run  
But I'm still losin'  
This game of life I play  
Living and dying  
With the choices I made  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Living and dying  
With the choices I made
