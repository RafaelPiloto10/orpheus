[Chorus]  
Now I know the only compass that I need  
Oh is the one, that leads back to you  
Now I know the only compass that I need  
Is the one, that leads back to you  
  
She had cat eyes, nine lives, no tan lines, thigh highs  
She ride me like a drive by, I'm real these niggas Sci-Fi  
But that's neither here nor there  
She been contemplating short hair  
She said she tryna be different  
But she just like the rest of these bitches  
But that's neither here nor there  
And my dick is her chair  
It be sexual warfare, I be loaded like software  
Got so many hoes, I'm ho'in, but she the only one worth knowin'  
And yeah I do my dirt, but that's for the flowers to grow in  
I ain't trippin', but she be trippin'  
They ain't got shit on me, but she keep sniffin'  
Look girl, just gimmie that brain, and I'll return the favor  
Them hoes say I'mma dog, but how come I don't chase 'em  
I lick her with no chaser, I pick her out a line up  
I just wanted some time, she say "okay I'm ya honor"  
But she been wantin' to break up, since dolce and gabbana  
All that ass I just be like come sit yo groceries on my counter  
I drink tea, she drink wine, call it tijuana  
I dyin' to meet a girl, but she want me to meet her momma  
Swear I may go Issey Miyake, Bond no. 9  
The weed in funky, but I'm smelling fine  
Tunechi.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I got that shit in my system  
Somebody gon' be my victim  
Eh, so where you at wit it  
'Cause I can't do it by myself, I need an assistant  
I got that good good, that get right  
That early morning, that midnight  
I beat it up, like a fist fight  
One, two, three, four, five, six nights  
That dick all in yo' windpipe  
Some of her friends I dislike  
Some of yo friends, they alright  
Sometimes I think y'all all dykes  
But fuck all that, I'm on one  
Don't wanna be with the wrong one  
That cold head, that warm tongue  
My third leg run marathons  
I feel you like I'm blind girl  
Can't you see, it's meant to be  
So come to me, then come for me  
My game cold, one degree  
I'm rollin' with two bad bitches cuz misery loves company  
One sweet, one sour, my honeybee and my bumblebee  
I miss you in the worst way, ride that dick no speed bumps  
No redlights, no stop lights, just get to Lil' Tunechi  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Should I call somebody else?  
'Cause girl it's almost twelve, and this dick won't suck itself  
Girl you know it need some help, it'll make a nigga's day  
If you said you on your way, yeah  
Should I call somebody else?  
'Cause girl it's almost twelve, and this dick won't suck itself  
Girl you know it need some help, it make a nigga's day  
I just hope you know the way  
And she said  
  
[Chorus]
