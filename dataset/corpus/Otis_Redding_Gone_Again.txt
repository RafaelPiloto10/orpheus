The sun is gone away  
It is dark in the day  
No kids are laughing  
And none are playing  
  
No flowers have grown  
Since the month of May  
That's how it's been  
Since you've gone again  
  
One you left without a reason  
Two without a pleasing  
Three with a terrible pain  
Four you're gone again  
  
Picture a winter  
Without any snow  
Look up at the sky  
There's no star that glow  
  
Picture a river  
With nowhere to flow  
That's how it's been, honey  
Since you've gone again  
  
One without a reason  
Two without a pleasing  
Three with a terrible pain  
Four you're gone again  
  
I walked in the forest  
Didn't see no trees  
Go to sleep at night  
With a cold wind of breeze  
  
I ain't got no friends  
I got cold enemies  
That's how it's been  
Honey, since you've gone again  
  
Gone, gone again, gone, gone again  
Gone mama, gone again, yes, you are  
Where can I find you? I need you, darling  
  
Where can I get to you? I want you, mama baby  
I love you, darling, I need you, oh gone again  
Come back to me, baby
