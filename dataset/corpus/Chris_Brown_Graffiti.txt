I see you writin' on my wall, why you wanna do that?  
My name's tagged you already see that  
The media wanna paint it all black  
And they do it right in my face  
See I can't sit back and let it all wash away  
I worked too hard for it to be erased  
Before you talk, I'ma finish what I gotta say  
  
Cause I already put in time with all of my grindin'(with all of my grindin')  
You know I grind, through all of this trouble, all of this trouble  
Even through the pain I still had to hustle  
Man I had to feed my family, and at the same time keep my sanity, oh no  
Man I can't let you do it  
  
Graffiti you're tryna spray, spray on me  
Graffiti you're tryna spray, on my name  
Graffiti you're tryna spray, spray on me  
All the graffiti you're tryna spray, on my name  
  
But it's already written on the wall  
Can't cover it up, can't cover it up  
But it's already written on the wall  
Can't cover it up, can't cover it up  
  
Who got award shows rockin' every time I hit the stage  
Even the haters went and bought a CD  
Without my fans I'm an empty spray can, and I just can't paint a thing  
Seems like the less I had the money, the less I had the problems  
The more I got the money, the more I got the problems  
Let me clear my throat, gotta make sure you hear me go  
  
Cause I already put in time with all of my grindin' (with all my grindin')  
You know I grind, through all of this trouble, all of this trouble  
Even through the pain I still had to hustle  
Man I had to feed my family, and at the same time keep my sanity, oh noo  
Man I can't let you do it  
  
Graffiti you're tryna spray, spray on me  
Graffiti you're tryna spray, on my name  
Graffiti you're tryna spray, spray on me  
All the graffiti you're tryna spray, on my name  
  
Cause it's already written on the wall  
Can't cover it up, can't cover it up  
Cause it's already written on the wall  
Can't cover it up, can't cover it up, baby  
  
It's already done, ain't gotta pay no more  
All this pain that I've endured  
I know I was wrong for what I did  
And I made some mistakes cause I'm human  
I ain't gon' feed into the negative,  
I'ma keep grindin', ohh yeah  
But this graffiti, oh oh oh  
  
Cause I already put in time with all of my grindin'  
You know I grind, through all of this trouble, all of this trouble  
Even through the pain I still had to hustle  
Man I had to feed my family,  
and at the same time keep my sanity, oh no  
Man I can't let you do it  
  
Graffiti you're tryna spray, spray on me  
Graffiti you're tryna spray, on my name  
Graffiti you're tryna spray, spray on me  
All the graffiti you're tryna spray, on my name  
  
Can't cover it up, can't cover it up  
Can't cover it up, can't cover it up
