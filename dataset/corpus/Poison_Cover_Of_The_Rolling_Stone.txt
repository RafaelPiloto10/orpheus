Coughing, Blues?: "Gol, Bret--don't touch me there!"  
Bret: I'm gonna tell you who we are.  
  
Well we're big rock singers  
we got golden fingers  
And we're loved everywhere we go  
(That sounds like us)  
  
We sing about beauty  
and we sing about truth  
At ten million dollars a show  
(Yeah, right!)  
  
We take all kinda pills  
That give us all kinda thrills  
But the thrill we've never known  
Is the thrill that it gets ya  
when you get your picture  
On the cover of the Rolling Stone  
  
[Chorus]  
Rolling Stone  
I'm gonna see my picture on the cover  
Stone  
Gonna buy five copies for my mother  
Stone  
Gonna see my smiling face  
On the cover of the Rolling Stone  
  
I got a freaky old lady named Cocaine Katie  
Who embroiders on my jeans  
I got my poor old gray-haired Daddy  
Driving my limousine.  
  
Now it's all designed to blow our minds,  
But our minds won't really be blown  
Like the blow that'll getcha  
When you get your picture  
On the cover of the Rolling Stone  
  
[Chorus]  
Spoken: Hey, I know how!!!  
Solo  
Spoken: Beautiful!  
  
We gotta lot of little teen-aged  
blue-eyed groupies  
Who do anything we say  
We got a genuine Indian Guru  
He's teaching us a better way  
  
We got all the friends that money can buy,  
So we never have to be alone  
And we keep gettin' richer,  
But we can't get our picture  
On the cover of the Rolling Stone  
[  
Chorus]  
  
I don't know why we ain't on the cover, baby!  
Ah we're beautiful fellas!  
I ain't kiddin' you man, we'd make a beautiful cover  
I mean, I can see it right now--we be up front,  
Oh, we be smilin'... Beautiful!
