There is a rose in black at Spanish Harlem  
A rose in black at Spanish Harlem  
  
It is the special one  
It never sees the sun  
It only comes up  
When the moon is on the run  
  
And all the stars are gleaming  
It's growing in the street  
Right up through the concrete  
But soft sweet and dreamy  
  
There is a rose in Spanish Harlem  
A rose in black at Spanish Harlem  
  
With eyes as black as coal  
That look down in his soul  
It start a fire there  
And then he loses control  
  
I'm gonna beg his pardon, yeah  
He's going to pick that rose  
And watch her as she grows  
In his garden
