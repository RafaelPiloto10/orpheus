I took each word she said as gospel truth the way a silly little child would.  
I can't excuse it on the grounds of youth, I was no babe in the wild, wild
wood.  
She didn't mean it, I should have seen it, but now it's too late.  
I thought I'd found the girl of my dreams, now it seems, this is how the story
ends:  
  
She's gonna turn me down and say, "Can't we be friends?"  
I thought for once it couldn't go wrong, not for long, I can see the way this
ends:  
She's gonna turn me down and say, "Can't we be friends?"  
Why should I care though she gave me the air,  
  
Why should I cry, heave a sigh, and wonder why, and wonder why?  
I thought I found the gal I could trust, watta bust, this is how the story
ends:  
She's gonna turn me down and say, "Can't we be just friends?"
