[Many years after the overthrow of Wilson, a rebel soldier crouching high on a
hilltop above the war torn forests of Gamehendge spots a group of loyalists
approaching from their lakeside encampment below. His trusty llama stands
beside him, loaded down with a canvas pack that holds two large bazooka type
guns to the animal's sides. Near the man sits a cache of blastoplast, each
capable of destroying the entire hillside in an instant...]  
  
Sunrise over the turquoise mountains, messenger birds in sight  
They came up through the valley, both sides at a time  
Through the cold steady rain Raid! I bend down  
Poke a double decker on a llama. Llama, Taboot Taboot  
Trigger a blastoplast, ramshackle laker recedes I start to run  
It was the loudest thing I'd ever heard And I knew my time had come  
To enter the delta  
  
Leave it on press, depress, depress.  
Llama, Taboot Taboot
