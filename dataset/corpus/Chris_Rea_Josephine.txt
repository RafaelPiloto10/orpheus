There's rain on my window  
But I'm thinking of you  
Tears on my pillow  
But I will come through  
Josephine, I'll send you all my love  
And every single step I take  
I take for you  
Josephine  
  
There's a storm on my radar  
But I can still fly  
And you are the reason  
The blue in my sky  
Josephine  
  
A life without meaning  
I was walking away  
In the coldest of winters  
Night becomes day  
Josephine, I'll send you all my love  
And every single step I take  
I take for you  
Josephine
