I've got rippling waters to wake me to the morning, my woman in love,  
Tall pine trees are pointing us easily to Heaven above.  
Blue Spruce flaming on the grate in the evening, takes the chill away fine,  
Cut the telephone line, the story's the same.  
There's a worn red chair by the window that she found at a sale down the way,  
When some old woman said that they needed more room for the winter.  
People like pulling out the stuffing when they sit down, so it passes the
time,  
Cut the telephone line, the story's the same.  
  
Ooh, like a bubble on a windy day start to flutter when I hear you say,  
That you feel too good to go away and you make me feel fine.  
And you made the world a warmer place, by the sparkle of your diamond face.  
On a gray spot, put a little lace and you make me feel fine,  
Warm as a mountain sunshine, on the edge of a snowline, in a meadow of
Columbine.  
  
Oh, little Jennifer, I'd give a penny for what you've got on your mind,  
Seems like most of the time you're lying there dreaming.  
Maybe in your vision you see how our mission is, slightly less than defined,  
Cut the telephone line, the story's the same.  
Now rippling waters flow through the ceiling and the walls and they're keeping
me warm  
And the closest I've been to my family for days is my music.  
But to silently stare in the morning sky is like hearing her calling my name,  
Cut the telephone line, the story's the same.  
  
Ooh, like a bubble on a windy day, start to flutter when I hear you say,  
That you feel too good to go away and you make me feel fine.  
Warm as a mountain sunshine, on the edge of a snowline, in a meadow of
Columbine.
