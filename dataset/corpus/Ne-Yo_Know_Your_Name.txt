Excuse me  
I couldn't help but notice  
You noticing me  
And I was definitely noticing you  
My name is  
You know my name  
But listen  
I have a question  
  
No it ain't like me to drop too hard, no baby  
Or go out of my way to know who you are  
Say you're not one for chasing  
But I'll admit  
Something in you  
Has got my attention girl  
So if I can  
Be a gentleman  
Can I ask your permission girl  
  
[Chorus]  
Said if it's alright with you, baby  
Can I know your name, (oh can I know your name)  
And maybe call you sometime, yeah baby  
Can I know your name, (wanna know your name)  
Can I know your name  
  
Looking at you girl I see so much  
So much potential for something better than that  
Like maybe me and you becoming us  
I'm not trying to scare you  
But in your eyes  
I can see why  
People write love songs  
And if God allowed  
I could see how  
I could love you for so long  
First things first  
  
If it's alright with you  
Can I know your name, can I know your name  
And maybe call you sometime, baby, baby  
Can I know your name, (I wanna know, know, know)  
Can I know your name  
Said if it's alright with you  
Can I know your name, (can I know your name), said I wanna know your name  
And maybe call you sometime, baby, baby  
Can I know your name, (wanna know your name)  
Can I know your name  
  
Something about you, uh  
That makes me wanna know you, mmm  
Said I wanna get to know you  
I just wanna show you me, whoa babe  
Said I really wanna get to know you  
See what this thing could be, oh  
  
Baby if it's alright  
Can I know your name, (oh can I know you're name)  
And maybe call you sometime  
Can I know your name, (wanna know your name)  
Girl I wanna know, I really wann  
Girl if it's alright with you  
Can I know your name (can I know your name)  
And maybe call you sometime, baby  
Can I know your name, (wanna know your name)  
Can I know your name, mmm
