Come as you are, as you were, as I want you to be  
As a friend, as a friend, as an old enemy  
Take your time, hurry up, the choice is yours, don't be late  
Take a rest as a friend as an old memoria  
Memoria, memoria, memoria, memoria  
  
Come doused in mud, soaked in bleach, as I want you to be  
As a trend, as a friend as an old memoria, memoria, memoria  
  
And I swear that I don't have a gun  
No, I don't have a gun  
No, I don't have a gun  
Memori-a, memori-a, memoria, memoria  
  
And I swear that I don't have a gun  
No, I don't have a gun  
No, I don't have a gun  
No, I don't have a gun  
No, I don't have a gun
