Gabe:  
There's a world...  
There's a world I know.  
A place we can go  
Where the pain will go away  
There's a world  
Where the sun shines  
Each day.  
  
There's a world...  
There's a world out there.  
I'll show you just where,  
And in time I know you'll see  
There's a world where  
We can be free  
Come with me.  
Come with me.  
There's a world where  
We can be free...  
Come with me.
