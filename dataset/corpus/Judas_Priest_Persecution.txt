We're watching you  
Nowhere to hide  
Obey the holy law  
Repent for your sins  
There is but one God  
  
Against their holy laws  
I'll do whatever it takes  
I've met their kind before  
We're martyrs burned at their stake  
  
They try to dominate  
I'll be the thorn in their side  
They underestimate  
The willpower feeding my pride  
  
[Chorus]  
Under the hand of persecution  
Defy the institution  
  
Their words just crucify  
Condemning truth that I seek  
They cannot justify  
The pain, the havoc they wreak  
  
I never will conform  
My faith is deep to the core  
I stand against reform  
I'll never kneel down before  
  
[Chorus]  
  
With raised fists of fire  
As they conspire  
I'll be defiant  
Against the alliance  
  
They will not eradicate me  
Break my will or suffocate me  
I will subjugate the hate  
That they breed  
  
As the church interrogates  
I cannot see they supplicate me  
Execute and ridicule  
We're all freed  
  
I never will conform  
My faith is deep to the core  
I stand against reform  
I'll never kneel down before  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Persecute  
You defy  
  
Execute crucify  
Crucify  
  
Persecute  
You defy  
  
Execute crucify  
Crucify  
  
Persecute  
You defy  
  
Execute crucify  
Crucify  
  
Persecute  
You defy  
  
Crucify  
You survive
