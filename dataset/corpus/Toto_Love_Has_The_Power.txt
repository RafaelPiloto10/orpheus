There is too much hatred, there is too much starvation, too much inhumanity  
  
Some people get the kicks out of throwing bricks at me  
No real reason, just jealousy  
Angry words and bad attitudes is gonna get you nowhere  
  
Watching you watching me, it's alright, 'cause I will make it right  
  
Chorus:  
Love has the power, it's strong as a tower you can lean on  
Love is a fire, a burning desire, it's so warm (oh)  
  
Some believe in the almighty dollar, some don't believe in nothing at all  
There's a power that's within you, it will never never ever let you down  
  
I'm the way, I'm the key to liberty and unity, are you listening  
  
Chorus  
  
One hundred million voices singing (can you hear the voices singing)  
No weak, no strong, no right, no wrong - imagine (you gotta keep imagining)  
Impossible, the sceptics say,wait and see there's gonna come a day  
  
Chorus  
  
Love has the power, it's strong as a tower you can lean on  
Love has the power, it's strong as a tower you can lean on  
  
There's no difference between black or white, the light of life  
I can hear the children laughing  
Men at war, stop your worries, give peace a chance, there's a new day dawning  
Come together, come together, come together  
(Wisdom is the mouth of peace, of innocence)
