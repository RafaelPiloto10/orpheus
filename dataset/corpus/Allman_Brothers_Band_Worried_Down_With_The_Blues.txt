Lying here for hours  
Can't get my eyes to close  
Can't get one moment's peace  
To save my dog-gone soul  
I've been doin' more than drinkin'  
Tryin' to ease my pain  
Everywhere I go  
Somebody speaks your name  
Oh my friends keep on askin'  
Boy what's wrong with you?  
I say I'm worried  
Worried down with the blues  
Try to be a good man  
Work my fingers to the bone  
And you return the favor  
By messing up my happy home  
You played so many dirty tricks  
Till I lost my faith in you  
Now you want me to take you back  
What's a poor man supposed to do?  
Worried down with the blues  
Oh, yes I am  
Worried down with the blues  
Oh, I feel like I was born to lose  
Used to walk with pride with my head held high  
Now I'm starin' down at my shoes  
Yes I am worried  
Worried down with the blues  
You made me turn my back  
On my very best friend  
And when my back was turned  
You were messin' around with him  
I'd give up everything  
To have you by my side  
'Cause in the cold, cold night when I reach for you  
I'm holdin' to my foolish pride  
Worried down with the blues  
Oh, yes I am  
Worried down with the blues  
Feel like I was born to lose  
Used to walk with pride with my head held high  
Now I'm starin' down at my shoes  
Yes I am worried  
Worried down with the blues, oh yeah
