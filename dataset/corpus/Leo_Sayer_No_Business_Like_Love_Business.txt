There's no business like love business  
There's no business I know  
One day ya want to hold on forever  
The next you want to let it go  
  
There's nothin' shakin' like love makin'  
There's nothin'as long as it lasts  
One day can be there forever  
The next is a thing of the past  
Now listen to this  
  
I fell in love with a sweet little girl once  
She was everything a woman should be  
Did everything to find if she was wrong  
But it seemed she loved only me  
She gave me some pretty good things  
Things I couldn't get from my own dear mother  
I had to go 'way for just a few days  
When I returned she'd gone off with my brother  
I was drivin' and I didn't see it coming, no  
  
There's no business like love business  
There's no business I know  
One day ya want to hold on forever  
The next you want to let it go  
  
Once I knew this rich man  
He treated his woman like a queen  
He gave the woman everything she needed  
He kept her lookin' so fine and clean  
He had so much faith in her  
His love he never had to check out  
He had to go see a man about a dog one day  
And when he got back he found she'd shimmied out  
I tried to tell you boy, you wouldn't listen to me  
  
There's no business like love business  
There's no business I know  
One day ya want to hold on forever  
The next you want to let it go  
  
Listen! There ain't nothin' shakin' like love makin'  
There ain't nothin' as long as it lasts  
One day you want to hold on forever  
The next is a thing of the past  
  
La, da, da, da, da, da, ooh, whoo  
La, da, da, da, da, da, ooh, whoo, whoo, whoo  
La, da, da, da, da, da, ooh, whoo  
  
There's no business like love business  
There's no business I know  
One day ya want to hold on forever  
The next you want to let it go  
  
Listen! There ain't nothin' shakin' like love makin'  
There ain't nothin' as long as it lasts  
One day you want to hold on forever  
The next is a thing of the past
