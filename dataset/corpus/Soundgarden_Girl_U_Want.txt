Swings from somewhere you can't see  
She sits in the top of the greenest tree  
She sends out an aroma of undefined love  
Drifts on down in a mist from above  
  
She's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want  
She's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want  
  
You can hear her calling everywhere you turn  
You know you're headed for the pleasure burn  
The words get stuck on the tip of your tongue  
She's the real thing but you knew it along  
She's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want  
  
[Chorus:]  
Look at you, your mouth watering  
Look at you your mind spinning  
Why don't we just admit it's all over  
She's just a girl you want  
  
She's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want  
She's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want  
  
She swings from somewhere you can't see  
She sits in the top of the greenest tree  
She sends out an aroma of undefined love  
Drifts on down in a mist from above  
  
She's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want  
She's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She's just a girl, a girl, a girl you want [Repeat x 2]
