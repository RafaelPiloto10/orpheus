I read that it's all black and white  
Oooh, the spectrum made a shade I like!  
Ooh, those crinsom rays of ruby bright  
Ah! the technicolor li-I-ight!  
  
Red! red! I want red!  
There's no substitute for red!  
Red! paint it red!  
Green ain't mean compared to red!  
  
You don't know what it does to me  
Yeah, that crimson sin intensity!  
I'm haunted by the mystery of red, red, red!  
  
Red! red knocks 'em dead!  
Some like it hot-tah!  
I like it red!  
  
Red's my lover, got me covered!  
Red's my number and he's a commer!  
Red's my drummer. I hear his thunder!  
Move over, brother!  
Red is a mother!  
He's a mother!  
  
Red! red knocks 'em dead!  
Red, red, red, red!  
Red! red! I want red!  
Move over, brother!
