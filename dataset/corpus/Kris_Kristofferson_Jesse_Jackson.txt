He was walking with your brother on the streets of alabama  
He was marching next to martin when he died  
Working face to face in cuba and managua nicaragua  
He did not yet beat the devil, but he tried  
Chorus:  
Hold on brother, jesse jackson  
There's a better world a'coming  
Where a man can hope a man will show some heart  
You just keep right on believing  
In the better side of human  
They ain't ready for it yet, but it's a start  
And you move'em when you hit'em in the heart  
We must bring it all together we must start right from the bottom  
Back to helping one another when we can  
'cause if he's hungry and he's human and he's fighting for his freedom  
Then he shouldn't be too hard to understand  
Chorus:  
Hold on brother, jesse jackson  
There's a better world a'coming  
Where a man can hope a man will show some heart  
You just keep right on believing  
In the better side of human  
They ain't ready for you yet, but it's a start  
And you move'em when you hit'em in the heart  
Chorus:  
Hold on brother, jesse jackson  
There's a better world a'coming  
Where a man can hope a man will show some heart  
You just keep right on believing  
In the better side of human  
They ain't ready for you yet, but it's a start  
And you move'em when you hit'em in the heart
