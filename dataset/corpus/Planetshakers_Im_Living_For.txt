Let the heavens and the earth  
Shout Your Majesty and glory  
Let the ocean sing their song  
Every tongue will tell it's story  
Of Your Majesty  
And Your never-ending power  
Let the whole earth sing to You  
I will give my heart to You  
Everything I do  
Cause You are the One I'm living for  
And I will lift my hands in praise  
Serve You all my days  
Cause You are the One I'm living for  
Let the heavens and the earth  
Shout Your Majesty and glory  
Let the ocean sing their song  
Every tongue will tell it's story  
Of Your Majesty  
And Your never-ending power  
Let the whole earth sing to You  
I will give my heart to You  
Everything I do  
Cause You are the One I'm living for  
And I will lift my hands in praise  
Serve You all my days  
Cause You are the One I'm living for  
And I will give my heart to You  
Everything I do  
Cause You are the One I'm living for  
And I will lift my hands in praise  
Serve You all my days  
Cause You are the One I'm living for  
Cause You are the One I'm living for  
Cause You are the One I'm living for  
You are the One I'm living for  
I will give my heart to You  
Everything I do  
Cause You are the One I'm living for  
And I will lift my hands in praise  
Serve You all my days
