This must be heaven, tonight I cross the line  
You must be the angel, I though I might never find  
Was it you I heard singing, oh, while I was chasin' dreams  
Driven by the wind, like the dust that blows around  
And the rain fallin' down but I never know  
Got to be heaven 'cause here's where the rainbow ends  
If this ain't the real thing, then it's close enough to pretend  
When that wind blows when the night's about to fall  
You can hear the silence call, it's a certain sort of sound  
Like the rain fallin' down  
Hole's in what's left of my reason, hole's in the knees of my blues  
Odds against me been increasin' but I'll pull through  
I never could read no road map, I don't know what the weather might do  
But when that rich wind whines and I see the dark star shine  
I got a feeling there's no time to lose, no time to lose  
Never know now, just don't never know, no  
Well it's been heaven but even the rainbows will end  
Now my sails are fillin' and the wind is willin'  
And I'm as good as gone again  
I'm still walkin', so I'm sure that I can dance  
Just a Saint of Circumstance, just a tiger in a trance  
And the rain fallin' down, well, you never know, just don't know  
Listen, sure don't know what I going for, but I'm gonna go for it for sure
