I was a nighthawkin' in my taxi  
On a cruise below the deadline  
My fare was a shaky ol' lush  
So I kicked it over and took off  
Then he whipped out this switch blade  
Straight outta nowhere level to my throat  
He said "You ever been over to the war boy"  
I said "Man I was a combat paratrooper daddy"  
Well then he slump back cool and he pocket that steel  
He said "Take me down to Fourth and Main"  
Ah that paratroop bluff always cools oh the red eyed geezers down  
Man that last block that cat was singing  
Man he was sittin' in the backseat singing to me this song  
I got my BAR boy  
I got my M1 on my hip right  
You better listen mr president  
Oh boy don't you mess up with my war, boy  
I wanna do I wanna do  
Lord I wanna do the Blood Boogaloo  
I'm just a Redneck son of a gun  
I wanna kill me a gook before dawn  
Ah, night hawkin' for my change
