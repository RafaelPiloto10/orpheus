Won't need no shadow man  
Runnin the government  
Won't need no stinkin' WAR  
Won't need no haircut  
Won't need no shoe shine  
After the garden is gone  
After the garden is gone  
After the garden is gone  
  
What will people do?  
After the garden is gone  
What will people say?  
After the garden  
  
Won't need no strong man  
Walkin' through the night  
To live a weak man's day  
Won't need no purple haze  
Won't need no sunshine  
After the garden is gone  
After the garden is gone  
After the garden is gone  
  
Where will the people go?  
After the garden is gone  
What will people know?  
After the garden  
  
After the garden is gone  
After the garden is gone  
After the garden is gone  
After the garden is gone  
After the garden is gone
