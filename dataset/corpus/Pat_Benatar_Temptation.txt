We got it all but it ain't enough  
No, we're never ever happy with what we got  
I see that look on your face, you know I've seen that look before  
Don't you be fooled baby, you gonna show  
It's just Temptation, Whoa... Temptation  
Temptation Whoa... Must be Temptation  
  
Too far to fall but we always do  
Though we swore in our hearts to be true  
You say that hand that your holdin' feels a little cold sometime  
Baby sooner or later, you're gonna find that true love..  
  
Is just like Temptation, Whoa... Temptation  
Temptation Whoa... Feels like Temptation  
Now listen here... Whoa... Temptation  
Whoa... Temptation Whoa....  
  
We want it all and we want it fast  
No time to think, no time to ask  
But you know that road that we're on don't always lead to happiness  
You can count on it baby  
It's a pretty good guess now all we got  
  
Is just Temptation, Whoa... Temptation  
Temptation Whoa... Feels like Temptation  
Temptation Whoa... Looks like Temptation  
Temptation -- Must be Temptation Yeah
