Ain't no way I'm stayin' home tonight  
I'll be out until the mornin' light  
Just hangin' 'round the local parking lot  
Checkin' out the girls see what they got  
Yea they love it when me and the boys  
Start playin' love with them human toys  
Yea we just wind 'em up and let 'em go, oh yea  
  
[Chorus:]  
Summer nights and my radio  
That's all we need baby don't cha know  
We celebrate when the the gang's all here  
Hot summer nights that's my time of the year  
We made it through the cold  
  
This freezin' snow is gettin' really old  
Next year I'll head out for the coast  
Say boys I think that might just call for a toast, yea  
I got a line, you got a pole  
I'll meet you down at the ole fishing hole  
Yea them girls are biting good tonight  
Oh yea, uh oh, oh yea  
  
[Chorus]
