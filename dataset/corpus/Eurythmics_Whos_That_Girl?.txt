The language of love  
Slips from my lover's tongue  
Cooler than ice cream  
And warmer than the sun  
Dumb hearts get broken  
Just like china cups  
The language of love  
Has left me broken on the rocks  
  
But there's just one thing  
(Just one thing)  
But there's just one thing  
And I really wanna know  
  
Who's that girl  
Running around with you?  
Tell me  
Who's that girl  
Running around with you?  
  
The language of love  
Has left me stony gray  
Tongue tied and twisted  
At the price I've had to pay  
Your careless notions  
Have silenced these emotions  
Look at all the foolishness  
Your lover's talk has done
