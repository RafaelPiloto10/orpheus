You do that Romeo,  
Be what you want to be,  
Look like you're runnin' in place,  
Do that stupid dance for me,  
Do that Romeo,  
That go-go Romeo,  
I see you twist and turn, you look so stupid, happy and numb.  
Be my Romeo,  
Please be my voice in this world.  
I can't sing the songs that you sing,  
I can't find the gorgeous words.  
Will you be my Romeo,  
My go-go Romeo?  
I see you twist and turn, you look so stupid.  
  
I feel just like a local god when I'm with the boys.  
We do what we want, yes, we do what we want.  
I feel just like a local god when I'm with the boys.  
We do what we want, yes, we do what we want.  
We do what we want.  
Yeah, we do what we want.  
Be my Romeo,  
Tell me all about your love,  
Tell me all about your pain,  
Baited breath and rubber gloves.  
Be my Romeo,  
My go-go Romeo,  
I see you twist and turn,  
You look so fuckin' stupid.  
  
I feel just like a local god when I'm with the boys.  
We do what we want, yes, we do what we want.  
Those summer days can lead to the bad times,  
The world gets larger every day,  
Yeah, yeah, those summer days can lead to the bad blood times,  
They left me feelin' stupid, happy, and numb,  
Stupid, happy, and numb.  
I feel so stupid, happy, and numb.  
Stupid, happy, and numb,  
I feel so stupid,  
I feel so stupid.  
I feel just like a local god when I'm with the boys.  
We do what we want, We do what we want  
I feel just like a local god when I'm with the boys.  
We do what we want.  
We do what we want,  
We do what we want.
