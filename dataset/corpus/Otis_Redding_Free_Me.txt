Turn me loose  
There ain't no use  
Free me darling  
Don't hang me up  
Let me go from your love, now  
  
Just like a prisoner  
You got me chained and bound  
Unlock 'em, let me go, let me go  
Get 'em from around  
  
Turn me loose  
There ain't no use  
Free me baby, let me go, turn me loose  
From your love, now  
  
You know I did love you, yeah  
Do anything in the world for you  
I try my best, I try my very best, yeah, please  
The way your treating me  
Keep me in misery  
  
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry  
To walk away  
It's up to you  
To say we're through  
  
Free me baby, let me go, turn me loose baby  
From your love  
I got to tell you, listen this  
I know sometime  
I wonder do you really love me  
And if you don't, if you don't  
You got to let me know  
Let me go  
Your love is not shown  
Break these chains  
Make them tearing apart  
Let me love again  
  
Turn me loose  
There ain't no use  
Let me go, darling  
If you don't want me  
Free me  
Let me go  
Unchain me  
From your love
