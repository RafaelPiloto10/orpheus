Now that you found yourself losing your mind  
Are you here again?  
Finding that what you once thought was real  
Is gone, and changing?  
  
Now that you made yourself love me  
Do you think I can change it in a day?  
How can I place you above me?  
Am I lying to you when I say  
That I believe in you  
I believe in you.  
  
Coming to you at night I see my questions  
I feel my doubts  
Wishing that maybe in a year or two  
We could laugh and let it all out  
  
Now that you made yourself love me  
Do you think I can change it in a day?  
How can I place you above me?  
Am I lying to you when I say  
That I believe in you  
I believe in you.
