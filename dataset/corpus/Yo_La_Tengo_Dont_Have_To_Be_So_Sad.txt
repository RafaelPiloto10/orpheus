You and me  
Were at some goldfish pond  
And I  
I was tagging along for the ride  
This ugly big-mouthed fish really made us laugh  
  
And while I stood still  
I felt a chill  
I thought that maybe you did too  
I wanted to feel that way forever  
  
And that's why  
If you're looking at me  
I'll try  
To be what you want to see  
  
And if I  
If I'm ever that lucky  
You won't have to be so  
You won't have to be so sad  
  
Last night  
I was trying to read in bed  
I got to watching you sleep instead  
Even when I got tired I couldn't stop  
  
Because I love you so  
And I pray you know  
But I'm not one for praying  
You knew I couldn't say that without making a joke  
  
And that's why  
If you're looking at me  
I'll try  
To be what you want to see  
  
And if I  
If I'm ever that lucky  
You won't have to be so  
Won't have to be so sad...
