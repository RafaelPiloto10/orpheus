[Intro: Tweet]Ooh  
Ooh  
Ooh  
Shook up, Shook up, Shook Up  
  
Ooh  
Ooh  
Listen, it's something like dynamite  
Oow!  
  
[Verse 1: Tweet]This morning  
(I Cried)  
Had a good feeling  
(Inside)  
Exceptional emotion  
(That's why)  
I gave him my devotion  
  
He turns the lights off and loves my body  
Natural feelin', I can't describe it  
What a relationship, so contagious  
He gives me all I want, that's why I'm faded  
Shook Up  
  
[Hook: Tweet]How can I make it through the day?  
In love with you  
How am I supposed to do everything?  
When I'm shook up, shook up, shook up  
  
How can I make it through the day?  
In love with you  
How am I supposed to do everything?  
Everything, you are my everything  
  
[Verse 2: Tweet]Can't fight the feelin'  
(Inside)  
Lovin' what I'm seein'  
(Your mine)  
The way your touchin' my body, babe  
(Feels right)  
Don't stop makin' me fantasize  
  
He turns the lights off and loves my body  
Natural feeling, I can't describe it  
  
What a relationship, so contagious  
He gives me all I want, that's why I'm faded  
Shook Up  
  
[Hook: Tweet]How can I make it through the day?  
In love with you  
How am I supposed to do everything?  
When I'm shook up, shook up, shook up  
  
How can I make it through the day?  
In love with you  
How am I supposed to do everything?  
Everything, you are my everything  
  
[Rap: Free]Keep a G on stash  
No, I don't mean cash  
Let him know you gotta be so bad  
Maintain ya protein like amino ac  
Make ya boat fiend, show em' it's yo scene  
Sex like heron, clothes is mo' fiend  
Fa sure he approachin' the jokes that most dream  
You ain't gotta do everything  
You could keep him in pocket, have him goin' through change  
He say he won't well be patient, he frontin'  
(...)  
Nice and stuntin' and thumpin', ya boy moanin' and gruntin',  
And all the while ya laughin' now he say he won't  
Turn the tables, keep em' spinnin' like spree's, please  
Keep em' tamed, complain' you won't change  
Emotionally, coast is me,  
I'm a G.M., playa, no coachin' me  
  
[Hook: Tweet]How can I make it through the day?  
In love with you  
How am I supposed to do everything?  
When I'm shook up, shook up, shook up  
  
How can I make it through the day?  
In love with you  
How am I supposed to do everything?  
Everything, you are my everything
