Just like a buzzin' fly  
I come into your life  
Now I float away  
Like honey in the sun  
Was it right or wrong  
I couldn't sing that song anyway  
  
Oh, but darlin'  
Now I remember  
How the sun shown down  
And how it warmed your prayin' smile  
When all the love was there  
  
You're the one I talk about  
You're the one I think about  
Everywhere I go  
And sometimes honey  
In the mornin'  
Lord, I miss you so  
  
That's how I know I found a home  
That's how I know I found a home  
  
Oh, hear the mountains singing  
Lord, I can hear them ringing, darlin',  
Out your name  
And tell me if you know  
Just how the river flows  
Down to the sea  
  
Now I want to know  
Everything about you  
I want to know  
Everything about you  
  
What makes ya smile  
What makes ya wild  
What makes ya love me this way  
Darlin' I want to know  
Darlin' I want to know  
  
You're the one I talk about  
You're the one I think about  
Everywhere I go  
And sometimes honey  
In the mornin'  
Lord, I miss you so  
  
That's how I know I found a home  
That's how I know I found a home  
  
A-walkin' hand in hand  
And all along the sand  
A seabird knew your name  
He knew your love was growin'  
Lord, I think it knows it's flowin'  
through you and me  
  
Ah, tell me darlin'  
When I should leave you,  
Ah, tell me darlin'  
I don't want to grieve you....  
  
Just like a buzzin' fly  
I come into your life  
Now I float away  
Like honey in the sun  
Was it right or wrong  
I couldn't sing that song anyway  
  
Oh, but darlin'  
Now I remember  
How the sun shown down  
And how it warmed your prayin' smile  
When all the love was there  
  
You're the one I talk about  
You're the one I think about  
Everywhere I go  
And sometimes honey  
In the mornin'  
Lord, I miss you so....
