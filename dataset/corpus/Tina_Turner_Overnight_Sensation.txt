Well I guess I've been a long time  
Working in a backline  
Trying to make a song fit  
When you know it never was mine  
Two dollar high-heel shoes and a honky tonk dress  
In the rhythm and the soul reviews I had a dream I guess  
  
And I had to beat the stage fright  
I had to cry all night  
Trying to make a song fit  
When you know it never was right  
I said  
Girl, get up and get out of this mess  
You're gonna be an overnight sensation  
Gonna be an overnight success  
  
And all through the badlands  
Rocking on the bandstands  
It's so hard in the barbands  
When there's no one there who understands  
And Lady Luck will pas you by and she will never say yes  
You're gonna be an overnight sensation  
Gonna be an overnight success  
  
I used to be a sweet little rock'n'roll singer  
Chasing after fortune and fame  
What's your story? What's your payola?  
Me I'm in the music game  
  
Well I guess I've been a long time  
Working in a backline  
Trying to make a song fit  
When you know it never was mine  
What can I tell you, I made a break I guess  
And now I'm an overnight sensation  
I'm an over overnight success
