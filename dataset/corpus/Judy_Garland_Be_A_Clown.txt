I'll remember forever  
When I was but three  
Mama, who was clever  
Remarking to me  
If son when you're grown up  
You want everything nice  
I've got your future sewn up  
If you take this advice  
  
Be a clown, be a clown  
All the world loves a clown  
Act the fool, play the calf  
And you'll always have the last laugh  
  
Wear the cap and the bells  
And you'll rate with all the great swells  
If you become a doctor, folks'll face you with dread  
If you become a dentist, they'll be glad when you're dead  
You'll get a bigger hand if you can stand on your head  
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown  
  
Be a clown, be a clown  
All the world loves a clown  
Show 'em tricks, tell 'em jokes  
And you'll only stop with top folks  
  
Be a crack Jackanapes  
And they'll imitate you like apes  
Why be a great composer with your rent in arrears  
Why be a major poet and you'll owe it for years  
When crowds'll pay to giggle if you wiggle your ears  
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown  
  
Be a clown, be a clown  
All the world loves a clown  
If you just make 'em roar  
Watch your Mounte bank account soar  
  
Wear a painted mustache  
And you're sure to make a big splash  
A college education I should never propose  
A bachelor's degree won't even keep you in clothes  
But millions you will win if you can spin on your nose  
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown  
  
Give 'em quips, give 'em fun  
And they'll happy to say you're A-1  
If you become a farmer you've the weather to buck  
If you become a gambler you'll be stuck with your luck  
But Jack you'll never lack if you can quack like a duck  
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown
