You think she's really waiting  
I heard a different tune  
You'll let her think he wants her  
And I think she wants him too  
What she don't know won't hurt her  
She's got her secrets too  
She doesn't know about me  
The feeling's up to you, up to you  
So not to worry  
Don't be afraid, not tonight  
It's all the same, love  
I'm in no hurry and  
If we make love, it's alright  
Alright (tonight)  
Alright (tonight)  
Bring back the day I met you  
We knew it then, my love  
You smiled goodbye, then told me  
That your time was not your own  
I see you five years later  
Two thousand miles away  
You left her for a mission  
And I left him for the same  
For the same  
So not to worry  
Don't be afraid, not tonight  
It's all the same, love  
I'm in no hurry and  
If we make love, it's alright  
Well, well, well, well  
My, my, my, my  
So much for being faithful  
We've let them down again  
I wasn't very helpful  
And you didn't stop my hand  
Stop my hand, oh  
So not to worry  
When we made love, it felt right  
It's all the same, love (all the same, oh)  
We didn't hurry (we didn't hurry)  
If when we made love, it felt right, alright  
So not to worry  
If we make love, it's alright  
(Alright) It's alright, tonight's the night
