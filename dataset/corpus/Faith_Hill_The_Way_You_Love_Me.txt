If I could grant you one wish  
I'd wish you could see the way you kiss  
Ooh, I love watching you baby  
When you're driving me crazy  
  
Ooh, I love the way you  
Love the way you love me  
There's nowhere else I'd rather be  
Ooo, to feel the way I feel with your arms around me  
I only wish that you could see the way you love me  
Woh woh woh woh the way you love me  
  
It's not right  
It's not fair  
What you're missing over there  
Someday I'll find a way to show you  
Just how lucky I am to know you  
  
Ooh, I love the way you  
Love the way you love me  
There's nowhere else I'd rather be  
Ooo, to feel the way I feel with your arms around me  
I only wish that you could see the way you love me  
Woh woh woh woh the way you love me  
  
You're the million reasons why  
There's love reflecting in my eyes  
  
Ooh, I love the way you  
Love the way you love me  
There's nowhere else I'd rather be  
Ooo, to feel the way I feel with your arms around me  
I only wish that you could see the way you love me  
Woh woh woh woh the way you love me  
Woh woh woh woh the way you love me  
Woh woh woh woh the way you love me  
  
Ooh, the way you love me  
The way you love me  
Oh yeah  
  
The way you love me  
Woh woh woh woh the way you love me  
Woh woh woh woh the way you love me  
Woh woh woh woh the way you love me
