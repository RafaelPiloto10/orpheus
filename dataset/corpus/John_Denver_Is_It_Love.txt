I know how it feels to be head over heels  
To be lost in true love and the light of the moon  
When everything seems to be coming up roses,  
Every word seems to be rhyming with June  
And suddenly all of your dreams have come true,  
Happiness lives in your heart  
Then out of nowhere, one becomes two,  
And everything seems to be falling apart  
  
Is it love?  
When your heart feels like it's broken  
Is it love?  
And you just can't take anymore  
Is it love?  
When there's nothing that's left to be spoken  
Is it love?  
And there's nothing worth listening for  
Is it love?  
  
I know what it means to get caught up in dreams  
And in prayers that are answered with each passing day  
When loving and laughter are birds of a feather,  
And sharing and caring just one simple way  
You know you'll never be all alone,  
Someone will always be near  
Then you turn around and your best friend is gone,  
Oh where do they go when they just disappear?  
  
Is it love?  
When your heart feels like it's broken  
Is it love?  
And you just can't take anymore  
Is it love?  
When the good times have all been forgotten  
Is it love?  
And you fear there won't be any more  
Is it love?  
  
There's no answer, there seems to be nothing to say  
In your anger, would you even hear anyway  
It was magic, but somehow you've broken the spell  
It was heaven, but somehow it's turned into hell  
  
Is it love?  
When you know that your heart has been broken  
Is it love?  
And you just can't take it anymore  
Is it love?  
When you feel more than you could imagine  
Is it love?  
Now there's nothing that's worth living for  
Is it love?  
Is it love?  
Another expression of love  
You could be falling in love  
I wanna be in love
