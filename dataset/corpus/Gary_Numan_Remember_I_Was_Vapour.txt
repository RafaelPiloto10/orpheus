[Chorus]  
There's nothing here but us  
There's nothing here but us  
  
Remember, I was vapor  
Remember, I was just like you  
Remember, I was liquid  
Remember, I was someone too  
  
Remember, I need others  
Remember, I need oxygen  
Remember, I need lovers  
Remember, I need to forget  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Remember, I am human  
Remember, I feel just like you  
Remember, I had reasons  
Remember, I had friends like you  
  
Remember, I grow tired  
Remember, I could end all this  
Remember, I have memories  
Remember, I need to forget  
  
[Chorus]
