Tocha, Kandi, Tiny, Tamika. You know the flava.  
Do you know what you do to me? [repeat x4]  
  
When I hear your voice,  
Do you know what you do to me,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
When you come around,  
Do you know what you do to me,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
When you touch me,  
Do you know what you do to me,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
When I look in your eyes, and you look into mine,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
  
Just when you think you know  
'Cause everybody's got someone that moves them in some way.  
I never thought it could happen to me, I couldn't see it,  
Until I met you, you set me free baby.  
  
When I hear your voice,  
Do you know what you do to me,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
When you come around,  
Do you know what you do to me,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
When you touch me,  
Do you know what you do to me,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
When I look in your eyes, and you look into mine,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
  
If this was a crush I would've been long over you, but I know it's more,  
'Cause you got me doing things I said I'd never do.  
Lie awake, beep-beep, I'm losing sleep, wanna see you again,  
I'm doing everything to let you know I wanna be more than friends.  
  
When it comes to you, I lose all my control,  
I let the situation get out of hand.  
'Cause when I'm not with you I wanna be by myself,  
Can't stand to see you with no one else,  
Baby, baby, that's the kind of thing you do to me.  
  
Do you know what you do to me,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
Do you know what you do to me,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
Do you know what you do to me,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
Do you know what you do to me,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
  
When I hear your voice,  
Do you know what you do to me,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
When you come around,  
Do you know what you do to me,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
When you touch me,  
Do you know what you do to me,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
When I look in your eyes, and you look into mine,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
  
When I hear your voice,  
Do you know what you do to me,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
When you come around,  
Do you know what you do to me,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
When you touch me,  
Do you know what you do to me,  
Do you know what you do to me?  
When I look in your eyes, and you look into mine,  
Do you know what you do to me?
