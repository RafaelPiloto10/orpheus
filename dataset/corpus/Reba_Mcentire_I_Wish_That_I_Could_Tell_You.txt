How do you tell someone you're letting go?  
I wish that I could tell you  
But you're askin' me things that I don't know  
I wish that I could tell you  
Words that I would say  
Sound as empty as the way you feel inside  
While the silence in between  
Tells me everything that you deny  
I don't know how to help you  
I wish that I could tell you  
How to tell me goodbye  
I don't know how you leave it all behind  
I wish that I could tell you  
Is it true a heart heals itself with time  
I wish that I could tell you  
How do you choose?  
Do you hurt 'em with the truth or with a lie?  
Where do you go to find the courage  
You know I could never find?  
I don't know how to help you  
I wish that I could tell you  
How to tell me goodbye  
Where do you turn, where do you go?  
When you've finally reached the end of the road?  
How do you say it, I just don't know  
When it comes to leaving you're on your own  
How do you tell someone you're letting go?  
I wish that I could tell you  
Oh, wish that I could tell you
