[Chorus]  
I don't want a pickle  
Just want to ride on my motorcycle  
And I don't want a tickle  
'Cause I'd rather ride on my motorcycle  
And I don't want to die  
I just want to ride on my motorcycle  
  
It was late last night the other day  
I thought I'd go up and see Ray  
So l went up and I saw Ray  
There was only one thing Ray could say, was:  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just last week I was on my bike  
I run into a friend named Mike  
Run into my friend named Mike  
Mike no longer has a bike. He cries:  
  
[Chorus]
