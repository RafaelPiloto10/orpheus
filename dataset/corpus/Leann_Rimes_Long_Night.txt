Feel the underground breeze as the trains good bye,  
Pushing through the crowd, to see the sky around you,  
I blink as the green light turns to red  
Everybody on the streets trying to get there heads around it  
  
And when I loose myself, there is raging sea,  
You're a beacon of light you're the air I breathe  
  
Oh a long night put your arms with my self in out to the morning lights  
Baby we could make a great escape  
Run away like thieves and alight the world away  
Somewhere no-one will ever find us  
From, is a long night, long night  
  
Got a long ride home to think about things,  
And the song with the man on the radio sings is so true, reminds me of you  
The way that you know just who I am  
When I don't say I word you still understand against through, yeah who knew  
  
Oh its days like these, I crave you the most  
Shivers down my spine when you're holding me close  
  
Oh a long night put your arms with my self in out to the morning lights  
Baby we could make a great escape  
Run away like thieves and alight the world away  
Somewhere no-one will ever find us  
From, is a long night, long night  
  
Oh a long night put your arms with my self in out to the morning lights  
Baby we could make a great escape  
Run away like thieves and alight the world away  
Somewhere no-one will ever find us  
From, is a long night, long night
