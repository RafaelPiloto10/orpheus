Looking from a hill top, watching from a lighthouse,  
Just dreaming  
Up here I can see the world,  
Ooh, sometimes it don't look nice - that's OK  
Life from a window, I'm just taking in the view  
Life from a window, observing everything around you  
Staring at a grey sky, try to paint it blue,  
teenage blue  
Some people that you see around you, tell you how devoted they are  
They tell you something on Sunday, but come Monday they've  
changed their minds  
I'm looking from a skyscraper  
I'm standing on the Post Office tower -  
So I can see - all there is to see
