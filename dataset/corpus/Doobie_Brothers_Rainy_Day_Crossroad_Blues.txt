The sky is fallin' and the ground is reachin' up  
The river's goin' by and the water's gettin' high and I feel like givin' up  
Standin' in the downpour with these rainy day crossroad blues  
Got those woods on my left, city on my right, don't want to sleep alone
tonight again  
Hole in my coat, hole in my shoes, sittin' in Mobile singin' the blues about
you  
Company people call my house most every day  
Won't let a body concentrate  
Gotta get some peace that way  
Waitin' for that water risin', think I'll put my guitar in my boat  
'Cause I'm floatin' to the nearest levy just to lay down  
In that sand  
Just pickin' wild berries, gettin' stung by honey bees  
The Lord above and the devil below havin' a fight inside of me  
Thinkin' ' bout my gun, maybe that will set me free  
'Cause thunder and lightnin' are trapped inside of me  
Innocent darlin' why you treat your daddy this way?  
The price of the question is a mighty hard price to pay  
'Cause you brought these rainy day crossroad blues my way  
I can't take it no more
