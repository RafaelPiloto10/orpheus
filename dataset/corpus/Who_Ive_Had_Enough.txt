You were under the impression  
That when you were walking forward  
You'd end up further onward  
But things ain't quite that simple.  
  
You got altered information  
You were told to not take chances  
You missed out on new dances  
Now you're losing all your dimples.  
  
My jacket's gonna be cut and slim and checked,  
Maybe a touch of seersucker, with an open neck.  
I ride a G.S. scooter with my hair cut neat,  
Wear my wartime coat in the wind and sleet.  
  
Love reign o'er me.  
Love reign o'er me.  
Love.  
  
I've had enough of living  
I've had enough of dying  
I've had enough of smiling  
I've had enough of crying  
I've taken all the high roads  
I've squandered and I've saved  
I've had enough of childhood  
I've had enough of graves...  
  
Get a job and fight to keep it,  
Strike out to reach a mountain.  
Be so nice on the outside  
But inside keep ambition  
  
Don't cry because you hunt them  
Hurt them first they'll love you  
There's a millionaire above you  
And you're under his suspicion.  
  
I've had enough of dance halls  
I've had enough of pills  
I've had enough of street fights  
I've seen my share of kills  
I'm finished with the fashions  
And acting like I'm tough  
I'm bored with hate and passion  
I've had enough of trying to love.
