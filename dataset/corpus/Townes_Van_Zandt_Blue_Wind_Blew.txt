Blue wind's blown my dreams away  
My darling's flown and she's gone to stay  
All I got now is yesterday  
And I don't know what to do  
  
I guess I'll go downtown and see  
Just what downtown can do for me  
Maybe set my lonesome free  
Or maybe let me go  
  
I loved her true and I told her so  
I ask her too and she told me no  
She said she had somewhere to go  
And then she said good-bye  
  
I wonder how long it can go on  
How long I'll sing this same old song  
I wonder which one done us wrong  
Which one forgot to try  
  
I loved her true and I told her so  
I ask her too and she told me no  
She said she had somewhere to go  
And then she said good-bye
