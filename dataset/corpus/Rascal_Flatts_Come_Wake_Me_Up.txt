I can usually drink you right off of my mind  
But I miss you tonight  
I can normally push you right out of my heart  
But I'm too tired to fight  
  
Yeah the whole thing begins  
And I let you sink into my veins  
And I feel the pain like it's new  
Everything that we were,  
Everything that you said,  
Everything that I did and that I couldn't do  
Plays through tonight  
  
Tonight your memory burns like a fire  
With every word it grows higher and higher  
I can't get over it, I just can't put out this love  
I just sit in these flames and pray that you'll come back  
Close my eyes tightly, hold on and hope that I'm dreaming  
Come wake me up  
  
Turn the TV up loud just to drown out your voice  
But I can't forget  
Now I'm all out of ideas  
And baby I'm down to my last cigarette  
  
Yeah you're probably asleep deep inside of your dreams  
While I'm sitting here crying and trying to sleep  
Yeah wherever you are baby now I am sure you've moved on  
And aren't thinking twice about me and you tonight  
  
Tonight your memory burns like a fire  
With everyone it grows higher and higher  
I can't get over it, I just can't put out this love  
I just sit in these flames and pray that you'll come back  
Close my eyes tightly, hold on and hope that I'm dreaming  
  
I know that you're movin' on  
I know I should give you up  
But I keep hopin' that you'll trip and fall back in love  
  
Time's not healin' anything  
Baby this pain is worse than it ever was  
I know that you can't hear me but baby I need you to save me tonight  
  
Tonight your memory burns like a fire  
With everyone it grows higher and higher  
I can't get over it, I just can't put out this love  
I just sit in these flames and pray that you'll come back  
Close my eyes tightly, hold on and hope that I'm dreaming  
Come wake me up  
Oh I'm dreaming  
Come wake me up  
Oh, I'm dreaming
