Cool as the water melting from the winter snows  
You are the island I've been looking for  
I don't know where you come from  
But I can feel you comin' on  
You're a storm inside my soul  
That's ragin' out of control  
  
[Chorus]  
Call the wind out  
Call out the thunder  
Oh lightning, only you can will the weather  
I said come on  
Won't ya come on?  
Lightning you're mine  
  
Tonight, tonight  
You caught me while I was sleepin'  
Restin' from a heavy run  
I saw you in your evening gown  
You were lighting up the sky  
No matter what tomorrow brings  
Lightning, your mine tonight  
Woah, lightning your mine tonight  
  
Crack the horizon  
Only you can split the night  
Then comes your mother cloud to take you away  
Another wind will dry me  
And the sun will make me warm  
But to me my life will always be  
The calm before the storm  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]
