Staring at shadows on the wall  
Wish I knew of someone I could call  
Someone who might understand it all  
Ruby Lee, I show wish you was here with me  
  
Someone's lying with me in my bed  
Some stranger who don't understand my head  
Wish it was you lying here instead  
Ruby Lee, I show wish you was here with me  
  
Drowning in a sea of pretty faces  
Being quite the man about the town  
Packing up and going different places  
But I show miss having you around  
  
I listen to the noises down the hall  
Think I'll move out of here in the fall  
I ain't exactly having me a ball  
Ruby Lee, I show wish you was here with me  
  
Yeah, no
