Oh what a feeling I get when I'm with you  
You take my heart into everything you do  
And it makes me sad for the lonely people  
I walked that road for so long  
Now I know that I'm one of the lucky people  
Your love is making me strong  
  
[Chorus:]  
I've had enough bad love  
I need something I can be proud of  
I've had enough bad love  
No more bad love  
  
And now I see that my life has been so blue  
With all the heartaches I had till I met you  
But I'm glad to say now that's all behind me  
With you here by my side  
And there's no more memories to remind me  
Your love will keep me alive  
  
[Chorus: x3]
