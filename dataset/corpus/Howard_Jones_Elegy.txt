Please don't look at me this way  
I am from the same seed as you  
Take me back to the womb  
I am weary of this life  
  
Don't believe in my eyes  
Don't believe in my mind  
Don't believe in right or wrong  
Don't believe in cruel or kind  
  
But all this talk is only poetry  
Only as true as we would believe  
We must live to fight the negative  
Not to court the self in defeat oh oh oh oh  
In defeat oh oh oh oh  
  
Oh the pain of life is sweet  
Is it wrong to long for death?  
Must I cling to the thrills of life  
Ash to ash and dust to dust  
  
But all this talk is only poetry  
Only as true as we would believe  
We must live to fight the negative  
Not court the self in defeat oh oh oh oh  
In defeat oh oh oh oh  
  
You have looked at me this way  
We are all from the same seed  
Take us forward through the tomb  
There's no finish to a life
