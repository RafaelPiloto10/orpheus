If my feet don't fail and my heart gets well,  
I'll be out of here by noon.  
Packin' my load on the road,  
You can color me gone.  
  
Settlin' in for a long hard ride,  
Miss you sittin' on the shotgun side.  
Difficult journey when your navigator is gone.  
  
It's Trying times when the I'll winds blow.  
Trying times when the rivers won't flow.  
Trying times when the heartbreak starts to show.  
Trying times when the going gets tough.  
Trying times when you pack it all up.  
Trying times when you lose somebody you love.  
Lose somebody you love.  
  
The sun's coming up on the Interstate, now,  
In the eastboud lane, I'm facin' the crowd.  
Wishing I could jump up out of this traffic and fly.  
Got a pain in my heart and I'm flat on my back,  
Like a blind horse walkin' down a railroad track  
I didn't know nothing till the train came whistlin' by.  
  
It's Trying times when the I'll winds blow.  
Trying times when the rivers won't flow.  
Trying times when the heartbreak starts to show.  
Trying times when the going gets tough.  
Trying times when you pack it all up.  
Trying times when you lose somebody you love.  
Lose somebody you love. Repeat 3x
