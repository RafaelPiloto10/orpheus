A beautiful mind or a beautiful body  
I know which one I'm gonna end upon  
You say you will but you never promised thoughts  
  
A smile and a hand mix like water with sand  
As far as you're concerned  
A road and a sign I know which one catches my eyes  
  
And I, thought I heard it for a while  
Then it all came to me  
Sometimes I just don't know I believe in  
  
Don't you want to know when I suffer  
It doesn't show  
A smile and a hand mix like water with sand don't you know?  
  
I was thinking about moving back home  
I don't really need to live here  
No no I didn't I could I'm sure I would if I knew that  
I didn't I could I'm sure I would if I knew that  
  
A smile and a hand mix like water with sand  
As far as you're concerned  
A beautiful mind or a beautiful body  
I know which one, I'm gonna end upon end upon
