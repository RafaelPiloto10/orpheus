I don't know why you keep lying  
about your sanity  
Always keep on fighting 'til the end  
And I can't stop you from shining  
up your vanity  
Never taking chances to pretend  
  
Chorus:  
We get one chance to sip the wine  
And life don't come on borrowed time  
He just cries with no reply  
If we only knew just what it takes  
To leave the others making their mistakes  
  
If you care to say that life ain't  
worth it anyway  
Beze's gonna grab you in the end  
If you see a fool in memories that  
belie the rule  
Always take the chances to pretend  
  
I heard the voices of the people as  
they started praying  
I heard them singing songs of laughter  
as they started saying  
Well don't walk away  
  
I heard the voices of the people as  
they started praying  
I heard them singing songs of laughter  
as they started saying  
  
Well I know why you have lied  
about your vanity  
Always, never fighting till the end  
And I can't stop you trying to save  
your sanity  
Heaven will protect us in the end  
  
Chorus:  
We get one chance to sip the wine  
And life doesn't come on borrowed time  
He just cries with no reply  
If we only knew just what it takes  
To leave the others making their mistakes
