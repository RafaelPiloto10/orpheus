So you made it, this far,  
We upstairs, I let you up here  
You special, Marley, don't shoot  
You know what this is?  
Still The Carter 2 people  
Still The Carter 2 people  
Yeah, you still in the carter 2 people  
  
Hey yeah,  
All I have in this world is a pistol and a promise  
A fist full of dollars, a list full of problems  
I'll address them like P.O. Boxes  
Yeah I'm from New Orleans, the Creole cockpit  
We so out of it, zero tolerance  
Gangster gumbo, I'll serve 'em a pot of it  
I'm wealthy, still fuckin' with that block shit  
Wet your ass up, head to feet till your sock a drip  
Don't slip, you might fall and bust your ass  
No snakes at the carter, tell the gardener to cut the grass  
I hear 'em but they talking under mass  
Stop throwing pebbles at a bulletproof glass  
That's Cash Money, honey pie  
We ain't runnin', we don't hide screamin' fuck the other side  
Don't get caught on it, this the dailiest grind  
I'll put your heart on it and walk on it  
The chalks only for the art homie  
How they trace ya after I erase ya  
Look around, we at war and you still in preparation  
I'm riding for them reparations, no patience  
Slow paper is better than no paper  
Fast money don't last too long, you gotta pace it  
You gotta know that paper  
If you got it from a caper, you gotta blow that paper  
Gotta know that photo-fobia, no Kodak moments  
Feds walls with my pictures on 'em  
Nah, I ain't even in the school yearbook  
I don't do too much posin', got a cool killer look  
Career crook, get your career took  
I'm back like a brassiere hook  
Bitch cheer, camouflage gear, the hunter's here  
Better play it by ear, you ain't nothing but a deer  
Around here and this here is The Carter  
Serve it while it's hot out the pot to your mama  
And Slim tell me ain't nobody hotter  
But get your boys some different sauce, I want the whole enchilada  
I got 'em by the collar, watch me drop 'em  
On the head at the bottom  
You ain't gotta shoot 'em cause I already shot 'em  
And I ain't gotta get 'em cause I already got 'em  
Get 'em
