Operator, can you help me  
Help me if you please  
Give me the right area code  
And the number that I need  
My rider left upon the Midnight Flyer  
Singin' like a summer breeze  
  
I think she's somewhere down south  
Down about Baton Rouge  
But I just a can't remember no number  
A number I can use  
Directory don't have it  
Central done forgot it  
Gotta find a number to use.  
  
Trying to check out her number  
Trying to run down her line.  
Operator said that's priv'ledged information  
And it ain't no business of mine  
It's floodin' down in Texas  
Poles are out in Utah  
Gotta find a private line  
  
She could be hangin' 'round the steel mill  
Working in a house of blue lights  
Riding a getaway bus out of Portland  
Talking to the night  
I don't know where she's going  
I don't care where she's been  
Long as she's been doin' it right  
  
Long as she's been doin' it right
