Here we come again  
Like a message in the pouring rain  
And every now and then  
I still call your name  
  
Like partners in crime  
Every once in a while  
The the fishes at sea  
It's just the life we lead  
  
We're going up  
We're going down again  
  
We're going up  
We're going down again  
  
Watch us fall  
  
And time stood still  
In a distant town  
I know you  
I know you much too well  
Last year you said  
It's time to settle down  
Last time I saw you  
You were still running around  
  
Going up  
Going down again  
  
Watch us fall  
Watch us fall  
  
Remember when you said  
It's time to settle down  
Well last time I saw you  
You were still running around  
  
Going up  
Going down again  
We're going up  
We're coming down again  
  
Watch us fall  
Watch us fall  
Watch us fall  
Watch us fall
