I'll try to explain to friends, dear  
The reasons we two are apart  
I know what to tell our friends, dear  
But what can I tell my heart  
It's easy to say to strangers  
That we played the game from the start  
  
It's easy to lie to strangers  
But why tell a lie to your heart  
When I smile to hide all the tears inside  
What an ache it will be bring  
Then I'll wander home to a telephone  
That forgot how to ring  
  
I could say you'll soon be back, dear  
To fool the whole town may be smart  
I'll tell them you'll soon be back, dear  
But what can I tell my heart  
When I smile to hide all the tears inside  
What an ache it will be bring  
Then I'll wander home to a telephone  
That forgot how to ring  
  
I could say you'll soon be back, dear  
To fool the whole town may be smart  
I'll tell them you'll soon be back, dear  
But what can I tell my heart  
Oh, what will I tell my heart
