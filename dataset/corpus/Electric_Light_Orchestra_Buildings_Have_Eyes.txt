Pretty pretty are the girls as they go by  
Chilly chilly is the air under moonlit sky  
The windows watch you as you walk along  
And the streets lead back to where you started from  
  
The cities watching and you can't get by  
No matter where you hide you know the buildings have eyes  
This place is lonely but you can't get away  
No matter what you say you know the buildings have eyes  
  
Silly silly are the thoughts that fill your head  
Wish I'd never set out, wish I'd stayed in bed  
You see reflections from across the street  
So you better start movin' stop draggin' your feet  
  
The cities watching and you can't get by  
No matter where you hide you know the buildings have eyes  
This place is lonely but you can't get away  
No matter what you say you know the buildings have eyes  
  
Money money, gotta get some money and run  
It's an issue I find unenviable  
It doesn't matter which way you turn  
But you gotta keep trying cause you never learn  
  
The cities watching and you can't get by  
No matter where you hide you know the buildings have eyes  
This place is lonely but you can't get away  
No matter what you say you know the buildings have eyes  
  
Funny funny how the world goes round and round  
You better watch your step don't make a sound  
The windows watch you as you walk along  
And the streets lead back to where you started from  
  
The cities watching and you can't get by  
No matter where you hide you know the buildings have eyes  
This place is lonely but you can't get away  
No matter what you say you know the buildings have eyes  
  
Pretty pretty  
Chilly chilly  
Silly silly  
Money money
