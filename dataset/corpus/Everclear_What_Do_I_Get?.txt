I just want a lover like any other, what do I get  
I only want a friend who will stay to the end, what do I get  
  
What do I get, whoa, what do I get  
What do I get, whoa, what do I get  
  
I'm in distress, I need a caress, what do I get  
I'm not on the make, I just need a break, what do I get  
  
What do I get, whoa, what do I get  
What do I get, whoa, what do I get  
  
I only get sleepless nights  
Alone here in my half-empty bed  
For you things seem to turn out right  
I wish they'd only happen to me instead  
  
What do I get, whoa, what do I get  
What do I get, whoa, what do I get  
  
I only get sleepless nights  
Alone here in my half-empty bed  
For you things seem to turn out right  
I wish they'd only happen to me instead  
  
What do I get, whoa, what do I get  
What do I get, whoa, what do I get  
  
I just want a lover like any other, what do I get  
I only want a friend who will stay to the end, what do I get  
  
What do I get, whoa, what do I get  
What do I get, whoa, what do I get  
  
Well let me tell you now  
(What do I get)  
No love  
(What do I get)  
No sleep at night  
(What do I get)  
Nothing that's nice  
(What do I get)  
Nothing at all, at all, at all...  
  
'Cause I don't get you
