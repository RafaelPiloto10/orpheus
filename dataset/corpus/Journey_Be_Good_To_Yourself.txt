Runnin' out of self-control  
Gettin' close to an overload  
Up against a no win situation  
Shoulder to shoulder, push and shove  
I'm hangin' up my boxin' gloves  
I'm ready for a long vacation  
  
[Chorus]  
Be good to yourself when, nobody else will  
Oh be good to yourself  
You're walkin' a high-wire, caught in a crossfire  
Oh be good to yourself  
  
When you can't give no more  
They want it all but you gotta say no  
I'm turnin' off the noise that makes me crazy  
Lookin' back with no regrets  
To forgive is to forget  
I want a little piece of mind to turn to  
  
Be good to yourself when, nobody else will  
Oh be good to yourself  
You're walkin' a high-wire, caught in a crossfire  
Oh be good to yourself  
  
Be good to yourself when, nobody else will
