Fuck a hand shake nigga we ain't brothers  
On that West side where they reppin for they colors  
If you talking big shit, then my dick will make you stutter  
All up in your face like its (...)  
Right now, make her scream my name and pipe her right down  
Nasty I'm a king bitch, give a nigga a wipedown  
Twenty four bitches, I'm rolling on chrome

Fucking with these ratchets no purses they got baskets

Fire like a dragon

Been leadin as hoes, but they pretty like a pageant  
She said she'd let me cut, I had to stab it, for real though

Audemar, big bitch, big bitch, big tipper  
Supper club, 20, 000 for the liquor  
You see the bitch I'm with, you'll probably never get her  
Never cop bottles, with broke niggas  
In the corner, post it up(or pour shit up), what the dome give her  
Money flowin like a wet pussy, that's a long river  
So you got your bitch on lock, I'll slim jim her  
It's that time of the month fuck timber  
All my niggas got a bottle with a blunt lit up  
Before you pop up, throw your set up  
(hop in this bitch, lights lit up?), leave with her, a big spender, (bitch

(...)Illuminati all through your body  
She blow me like a twelve gang shawty you feel me  
Pull up in the 'rari, the fuckin life of the party

Before this rap shit, I'm honest
