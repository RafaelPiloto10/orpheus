Sheltering her ego on the edge of a floodlit arc  
She'll contemplate seduction, she'll calculate the catch  
When she moved, her presence speared me  
When she spoke, her words ensnared me  
Watch the lizard, watch the lizard,  
Watch the lizard with the crimson veil  
  
She crucified my heart in the depth of a satin grave  
As I lay in sweating monologue I sensed the love light fade  
Within the spiral of the cigarette  
You betrayed your bedside etiquette  
I saw the lizard, I saw the lizard  
I touched the lizard with the crimson veil  
  
I've seen a different doorway shut a million times before  
The smiling she chameleon, the smiling vinyl whores  
  
They know what they want, they sing your name  
And glide between the sheets  
I never say no, in chemical glow we'll let our bodies meet  
So was it just a fuck, was it just a fuck, just another fuck I said  
Loving just for laughs, carnal autograph, lying on a lizard's bed  
  
So was it just a fuck, was it just a fuck, just another fuck I bled  
Degraded and alone, raped and still forlorn  
Betrayed on a lizard's bed  
We chameleon, we chameleon, we chameleon
