I dreamed you,  
I saw your face.  
Cut my lifeline when drifting through space.  
  
I saw an angel,  
I saw my fate.  
I can only thank God it was not too late.  
  
Over mountains,  
I floated away.  
Cross an ocean,  
I dreamed her name.  
  
I followed an angel down through the gates.  
I can only thank God it was not too late.  
  
Sing a little song of loneliness,  
Sing one to make me smile.  
Another round for everyone,  
I'm here for a little while.  
  
Now I'm walkin'  
This street on my own.  
But she?s with me  
Everywhere I go.  
  
Yeah, I found an angel,  
I found my place.  
I can only thank God it was not too late.  
I can only thank God it was not too late.  
I can only thank God it was not too late.
