I didn't mean yo let you down  
You have to believe it  
I don't know what went  
Through my mind  
But now I can see  
  
That I waited too long  
To tell you how much it matters  
Just to be right here with you  
But I couldn't think of anything better  
I should have told you so  
  
Baby open your heart  
Won't you give me a second chance  
And I'll be here forever  
Open your heart  
Let me show you how much I care  
And I will make you understand  
If you open your heart  
To love me once again  
  
I'll try to make it up to you  
I want you to know  
Baby I swear that I'll be true  
And never let go  
If I waited too long  
To tell you how much it matters  
Just to be right here with you  
But I couldn't think of anything better  
I should have told you so  
  
Baby open your heart  
Won't you give me a second chance  
And I'll be here forever  
Open your heart  
Let me show you how much I care  
And I will make you understand  
If you open your heart  
To love me once again  
  
We could relive this pain and sorrow  
But we better do it in time  
Start over here and save tomorrow  
I want to make you mine  
  
Open your heart with a chance  
And I'll be here forever  
Open your heart and I'll care  
And I will make you understand  
Oh baby  
If you open your heart  
To love me once again  
  
Baby open your heart  
Won't you give me a second chance  
And I'll be here forever  
Open your heart  
Let me show you how much I care  
And I will make you understand  
If you open your heart  
To love me once again
