Trudging slowly over wet sand  
Back to the bench where your clothes were stolen  
This is the coastal town  
That they forgot to close down  
Armageddon - come Armageddon!  
Come, Armageddon! Come!  
  
Everyday is like Sunday  
Everyday is silent and grey  
  
Hide on the promenade  
Etch a postcard :  
"How I Dearly Wish I Was Not Here"  
In the seaside town  
That they forgot to bomb  
Come, come, come - nuclear bomb  
  
Everyday is like Sunday  
Everyday is silent and grey  
  
Trudging back over pebbles and sand  
And a strange dust lands on your hands  
(And on your face...)  
(On your face...)  
(On your face...)  
(On your face...)  
  
Everyday is like Sunday  
"Win yourself a cheap tray"  
Share some greased tea with me  
Everyday is silent and grey
