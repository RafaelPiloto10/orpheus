In the morning when I wake and my feet can find the floor  
I stumble down the hall and I open up the door  
Then I look into the mirror just like you know you do  
Stopping for a moment  
I can feel my mind go through the boundaries of time  
Back to a heart without his love inside  
I was more than just alone, I was dying on my own  
Thinking that nothing was ever gonna save my life  
Look what has happened to me I find it hard to believe  
His love has taken my life this far so far  
Look what has happened to me my mind can hardly conceive  
What I'm beginning to be look what, look what  
When you stop and think it over do you think you're doing well  
Are you getting stronger, can you really tell?  
If you're truthful with your feelings then you'll see there's room to grow  
Though we may have found the answer  
There is so much more to know, more to this life  
'Cause we can never stop growin' or we'll start to die  
I cannot survive alone, I am nothin' on my own  
But seeing's believin' and if you need to see look at me  
Look what has happened to me I find it hard to believe  
His love has taken my life this far so far  
Look what has happened to me my mind can hardly conceive  
Look what has happened, look what, look what  
Look what has happened to me I find it hard to believe  
His love has taken my life this far so far  
Look what has happened to me my mind can hardly conceive  
What I'm beginning to be, look what, look what  
Look what has happened to me I find it hard to believe  
His love has taken my life this far so far  
Look what has happened to me my mind can hardly conceive  
What I'm beginning to be, look what, look what
