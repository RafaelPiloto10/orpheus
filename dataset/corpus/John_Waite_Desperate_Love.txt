No guardian angel looking down on me tonight  
I'm on the streets again  
And I can't tell wrong from right  
I'm on the run from love  
But I don't know what I'm running for  
But it all looks alright when I'm standing at your door  
This could be ecstasy  
I've been dreaming of you  
This could be reality  
Tonight tonight  
Desperate love  
Got no reflection in the mirror anymore  
I'm falling backwards  
But I never hit the floor  
Don't give me counterfeits  
I need the real thing  
This ain't a game no more  
I'm bettin' everything  
This could be ecstasy  
I've been dreaming of you  
This could be reality  
Tonight tonight  
Desperate love  
Yeah desperate love  
I don't feel I should fight  
When you pull me through your door  
You take me to your room  
And show me what I'm living for  
And I lose myself  
But my heart keeps poundin'  
If you won't take me now  
Don't take me anymore  
Cause I don't read books  
But I know the score  
This could be ecstacy  
I've been dreaming of you  
This could be reality tonight  
You could be next to me  
I've been waiting for you  
This could be reality tonight  
Yeah  
I don't feel I should fight  
When you pull me through your door  
You take me to your room  
And show me what I'm living for  
And I lose myself  
But my heart keeps poundin'  
If you won't take me now  
Don't take me anymore  
Cause I don't need books  
To know the score  
You could be next to me  
I've been dreaming of you  
This could be ecstasy  
Tonight tonight  
Desperate love  
Yeah  
Desperate love  
Desperate love  
Yeah desperate love  
Ooh yeah  
Desperate love  
Desperate desperate love  
Desperate desperate love  
Love  
It's desperate desperate love
