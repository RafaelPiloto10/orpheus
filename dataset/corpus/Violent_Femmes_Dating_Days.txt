  
  
  
Three women  
  
in thirty days  
  
tell me seriously  
  
our dating days  
  
are over and done  
  
are dead and gone  
  
it seems that no matter how much I drink  
  
I seem to still stay sober  
  
it seems that no matter how young I am  
  
I seem to still feel older  
  
three men are going to hell  
  
thirty women are going to jail  
  
Jonah swore he swallowed the whale  
  
thirty thirsty women  
  
three hundred women in three hours  
  
told me boy forget the flowers  
  
Christ told a man called 1 legion  
  
come into the fold and start preachin'  
  
your devil days are over and gone  
  
your weary days are dead and done  
  
your happiness has begun
