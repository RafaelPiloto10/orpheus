Deep in the heart of the infinite darkness  
A tiny blue marble is spinning through space  
Born in the splendor of god's holy vision  
And sliding away like a tear down his face  
Closer you see the whole wide holy wonder  
Of oceans and mountains and rivers and trees  
And the strangest creation of many, the human  
A creature of laughter and freedom and dreams  
Now the warriors are waving their old rusty sabres  
The preachers are preaching the gospel of hate  
By their behaviour determined to teach us  
A lesson we're soon to be learning to late.  
Look closer my brother, we're killing each other  
And we'd better stop and get started today  
Because life is the question and life is the answer  
And God is the reason and love is the way.  
Because life is the question and life is the answer  
And God is the reason and love is the way.  
Because life is the question and life is the answer  
And God is the reason and love is the way.  
Yes, life is the question and life is the answer  
And God is the reason and love is the way.
