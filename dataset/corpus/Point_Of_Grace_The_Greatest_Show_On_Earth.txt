I'm trying to shave my legs  
Ups at the door  
The kids are clownin' on the bed  
The door is scratchin' up the floor  
Yeah - Everybody here's just a little crazy  
In our hoop jumping, good-lovin' Big Top, baby  
  
[Chorus:]  
Ooo hoo welcome to the party  
Ooo hoo we're just getting started  
Take a front row seat  
Or the back if you prefer  
'Cause to me this three ring  
Is the greatest show on earth  
Ooo hoo  
Ooo hoo  
  
Oh the baby's on my hip and the noodles are boiling over  
Little Tommy just brought me a four leaf clover  
I'm spinnin' plates 'cause dinner's late and the phone keeps ringing  
So I turn the radio up 'cause I feel like singing  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
There's toys in the yard and the house needs paintin'  
And I'm pretty sure the neighbors all hate us  
But the view sure looks nice from the front porch swing  
I wouldn't trade it for anything, for anything  
  
[Chorus 2x]  
  
Welcome to the party, oh welcome to the party, welcome to the party  
We're just getting started
