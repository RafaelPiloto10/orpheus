So my baby's on the road  
Doing business, selling loads  
Charming everyone there  
With the sweetest smile  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh tonight  
I miss you  
Oh tonight  
I wish you  
Could be here with me  
But I won't see you  
'til you've made it back again  
  
Home and dry  
Home and dry  
  
There's a plane at JFK  
To fly you back from far away  
All those dark and frantic  
Transatlantic miles  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Home and dry  
Home and dry  
  
Far away  
Through night and day  
You fly long haul tonight  
Come to me  
You know I'll be here  
When you call tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Home and dry  
Home and dry
