See the sun in the sky  
Always riding high  
At christmas time down under  
  
It will be no surprise  
Temperature will rise  
At christmas time down under  
  
This is a festive time  
And we have no rain  
Santa is dressed up fine  
Here he comes again  
  
At the time and the place  
They come face to face  
At christmas time down under  
  
Doesnt't't seem quite the same  
Playing winters game in the sun  
  
The only snow we have is on our christmas tree  
The southen cross is not the nothern star  
We like to make believe  
We hear those jingle bells  
It doesnt't't really matter where we are  
  
We can look to the sky  
And see the reason why  
Its christmas time down under  
  
Its so wide,its so blue  
Youd see the reason too  
At christmas time down under  
  
The world seems the wrong way round  
Someone made it so  
Someday were up side down  
Ask the man who knows!  
  
Its his birthday today  
He came here to stay  
At christmas time down under  
  
Its up over for me  
Down under when I see  
Clear blue sky!
