Damien save me  
And be my guide  
Sooner or later  
We're all gonna die  
When we were walking  
Through the streets  
Everything you said was bittersweet  
And I wish that we could be in a  
Bottle of time just you and me  
Let's talk about the ways and means  
The body shape  
The love supreme  
And drink drink until we disappear  
Damien save me  
And be my god  
Sooner or later  
I'm gonna die like a dog  
Cut me in half  
And I'll let you see  
What this whole wide world  
Has done to me  
I'll be you sacrificial cow  
Just tell me when and I'll  
Show you how  
Let's talk about  
The sacrifice  
The body limbs  
That rest on ice and drink drink until  
We disappear  
I know you'll never let me down  
Down down down  
So let's take it and push it  
And kick it and break it  
And turn it all around.  
Damien save me  
And be my guy  
Sooner or later  
We're all gonna die  
When we were walking  
Through the streets  
Everything you said was bittersweet  
And I wish that we could be  
In a bottle of time  
Just you and me  
When we were walking through the streets  
...walking through the streets  
...walking through the streets.
