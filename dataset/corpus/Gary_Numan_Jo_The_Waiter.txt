Jo the waiter worked for me  
Serving wine in basement bars  
Only mad men ever stay. 'got no time'  
If your mindless please take mine  
  
Jo the waiter held me close  
Behind the door marked 'gentlemen'  
Just for now that's all I need  
Won't someone call me 'friend'  
Long gone. I recall good times  
I must confess I cried  
  
We burned out and the line went dead  
At six o'clock I felt so alone  
I crawled inside. 'where else to go'?  
Could be dead for all you know  
Everyday I died for you  
Valium boys with painted eyes  
Young man need love special  
I don't think I want it at all  
  
Long gone. I recall good times  
I must confess I cried  
Me I retired to a back street flat  
Picture 'eyes in a cold steel frame'  
The freaks arrive.  
Broken needles and blood  
'What you on man to get those eyes'  
  
It's very touching I'm so close to me  
False smiles I've rehearsed for days  
Come inside you won't know I'm wrong  
Give me your heart I'm so quickly gone
