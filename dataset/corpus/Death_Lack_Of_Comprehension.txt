A condeming fear strikes down  
Things they cannot understand  
An excuse to cover up weaknesses that lie within  
Lies  
Laying your guilt and pain  
On people that had no part in the molding of a life  
That creates its destruction  
Lies  
Right before your very eyes  
A reflection of the mistakes  
To the end you will deny  
Your part in the demise of a life  
Lack of comprehension  
Thriving on your cliche  
Compelled by self-resentment  
  
[Solo: Schuldiner]  
  
Reaching into the minds of those that created  
The depression in which they  
In which they drowned their flesh and blood  
Lies  
So easy to blame the  
Everlasting fear on a pathetic attempt  
To justify the ending of life  
Lies  
Right before your very eyes  
A reflection of the mistakes  
To the end you will deny  
Your part in the demise of a life  
Lack of comprehension  
Thriving on your cliche  
Compelled by self-resentment
