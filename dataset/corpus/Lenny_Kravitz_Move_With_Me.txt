Into a world I plunge thru my headphones  
Escape into the streetlight  
I begin to believe in destiny  
When my surroundings in rhythm with me  
I'm just a grain of sand walking in a sea of people  
I look around me and my name is just someone  
For a moment in time I belong  
Where my heart beats the fear is gone  
Like destiny  
  
So move with me I'm strong enough  
To be weak in your arms  
Move with me I'm strong enough  
To be real in your arms  
  
Whispering as I was driving  
Quietly the car was rolling  
Like a bullet  
I was feeling the speed moving  
Me faster. Addicted to the rhythm  
On my ghetto blaster  
That's me supposing  
That the clarity of thought  
Is clear enough to think  
It's real enough to touch  
The wind on me got me tripping  
Can I keep you next to me  
Till the end of the world  
  
Like the joker on the pile  
Never coming or going  
The colour of my true cards was showing  
Keeping in touch with an idea  
That I been growing  
Trust trust I must trust  
With my head on my chest  
I rest with the rest of the restless
