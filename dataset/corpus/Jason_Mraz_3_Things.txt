There are three things I do when my life falls apart  
Number one I cry my eyes out and I dry up my heart  
Not until I do this will my new life start  
So that's the first thing that I do when my life falls apart.  
  
Oh the second thing I would do is I would close both of my eyes  
And sing the parts I knew of favorite songs up to the sky.  
I go where I know the love is centering that look inside  
Gathering new strength from sorrow,  
I'm glad to be alive.  
  
I keep it calm around me.  
I'm safe inside my storm.  
I'm seeing all is grounding.  
Cause on the ground you can't get no lower.  
No when you're grounded you can't get no lower.  
  
Yeah the third thing that I do now when my world caves in,  
Is I pause I take a breath and bow and I let that chapter end.  
I design my future bright not by where my life has been.  
And I try, try, try, try, try again.  
Yes I try, try, try, try, try again.
