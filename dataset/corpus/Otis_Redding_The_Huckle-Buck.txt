There's a dance you should know  
When the lights are down low  
Grab your baby then go  
  
Do the hucklebuck, do the hucklebuck  
If you don't know how to do it, boy you're out of luck  
Push your partner out then you hunch your back  
Start a little movement in your sacroiliac  
Wiggle like a snake, wobble like a duck  
That's the way you do it when you do the hucklebuck  
  
There's a dance you should know  
When the lights are down low  
Grab your baby then go

Push your partner out then you hunch your back  
Start a little movement in your sacroiliac  
Wiggle like a snake, wobble like a duck  
Now that's the way you do it when you do the hucklebuck
