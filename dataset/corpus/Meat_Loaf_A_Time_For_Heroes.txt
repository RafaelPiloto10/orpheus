We search for an answer,  
And when it appears  
We can challenge the world with our sweat and our tears.  
Through winning and losing,  
The brave never bend,  
The hero keeps fighting, standing tall in the end.  
  
Time can change anything... And mend any fall.  
The moment of truth is facing us all,  
It's time for the hero to stand tall.  
  
It's a time for heroes,  
Time to answer the call,  
It's a time for the hero in us all.  
  
We carry the flame  
For all to see  
The fire and the passion, of what we can be.  
Sometimes we must fight,  
But we never bend  
The hero keeps fighting, standing tall in the end.  
  
Love can change anything... It's inside of us all  
To reach out a hand whenever we fall.  
It's time for the hero to stand tall.  
  
It's a time for heroes,  
Time to answer the call,  
It's a time for the hero to stand tall.  
It's a time for heroes,  
When our back's to the wall  
It's a time for the hero... In us all.
