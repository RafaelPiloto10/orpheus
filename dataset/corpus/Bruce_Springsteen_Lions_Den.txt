You broke my heart, tore it apart  
Thought it was cute, thought it was smart  
But now I'm back and I've got the strength of ten  
So I got a message for you my friend  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm Daniel waitin' in the lion's den  
Daniel waitin'for that lion to come  
Daniel waitin'in the lion's den  
dumb dumb dee dumb dumb dee dee dumb dumb  
  
That old lion's mean and long in the tooth  
And like you, baby, he's out on the loose  
Messin' hearts up time and time again  
Now it's the time for that messin' to end  
  
[Chorus]  
  
At night I hear you out prowling around  
Tearing guys up, scaring 'em down  
Now all that growling's gonna come to no end  
'Cause I'm just bidding my time, my little friend  
  
[Chorus]
