Tide pools  
When the ebbing tide retreats  
Along the rocky shoreline  
It leaves a trail of tidal pools  
In a short-lived galaxy  
Each microcosmic planet  
A complete society  
  
A simple kind mirror  
To reflect upon our own  
All the busy little creatures  
Chasing out their destinies  
Living in their pools  
They soon forget about the sea...  
  
Wheels within wheels  
In a spiral array  
A pattern so grand  
And complex  
Time after time  
We lose sight of the way  
Our causes can't see  
Their effects  
  
Hyperspace  
A quantum leap forward  
In time and in space  
The universe learned to expand  
  
The mess and the magic  
Triumphant and tragic  
A mechanized world, out of hand  
  
Computerized clinic  
For superior cynics  
Who dance to a synthetic band  
  
In their own image  
Their world is fashioned,  
No wonder they don't understand  
  
Wheels within wheels  
In a spiral array  
A pattern so grand  
And complex  
Time after time  
We lose sight of the way  
Our causes can't see  
Their effects  
  
Permanent Waves  
Science, like Nature  
Must also be tamed  
With a view towards its preservation  
Given the same  
State of integrity  
It will surely serve us well  
  
Art as expression,  
Not as market campaigns  
Will still capture our imaginations  
Given the same  
State of integrity  
It will surely help us along  
  
The most endangered species,  
The honest man  
Will still survive annihilation  
Forming a world,  
State of integrity  
Sensitive, open, and strong  
  
Wave after wave  
Will flow with the tide  
And bury the world as it does  
Tide after tide  
Will flow and recede  
Leaving life to go on  
As it was...
