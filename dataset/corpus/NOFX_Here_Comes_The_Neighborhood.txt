I've got to get out of  
I've got to get out of this hood  
I've got to get out of this neighborhood  
I've got to get out of it  
Got to get out  
I've had enough, won't call their bluff  
I'm not going to live in fear  
Racism lives on both sides so  
I'm gonna get the hell out of here  
Do you want crack?  
Do you need smack on the track?  
Do you want grass?  
Smoke hash you white trash?  
You better watch out  
You better watch out  
You better watch out  
I've got to get out of  
I've got to get out of this hood  
I've got to get out of this neighborhood  
I've got to get out of it  
I've got to get out of it  
I've got to get out of this neighborhood  
I've got to get out of this neighborhood  
I've got to get out  
I've got to get out  
I've had it up to here  
I'm not gonna live in fear  
They're the ones who are racist  
Why can't they just let me be?  
Do you want crack?  
Do you need smack on the track?  
Do you want grass?  
Smoke hash you white trash?  
You better watch out  
You better watch out  
I've got to get out of this neighborhood  
I've got to get out of this neighborhood  
I've got to get out of it  
I've got to get out of it
