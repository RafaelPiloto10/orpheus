Tonight I saw an eclipse of your smile within my own reflection  
On your look, so beautiful then  
A tear ran down my face, all my memories erase  
Oh, why'd you have to leave my side  
  
Oh, why do all the rivers flow into the ocean?  
And why does all the love in the world come strait from the heart?  
And why does all the pain I feel come from deep inside?  
Oh, all those questions I could have answered ... if you were by my side  
  
Maybe something mad e me look at you,  
Maybe something made me do what I had to do what I had to do  
Maybe something made me talk to you,  
Maybe something made me do what I should do  
  
I want you by my side  
(I want you by my side)  
(I want you by my side)  
  
Now everyday the pain I feel slowly fades away  
And all the memories of you and me are always here to stay  
What I'm asking, girl, is one more chance to let me in your life  
Oh, girl, if you give me one more chance ... then I could be right by your
side  
  
Maybe something made me look at you  
Maybe something made do what I have to do, girl  
Maybe something made me talk to you  
Maybe something made me do what I should do  
  
I want you by my side  
(I want you by my side)  
(I want you by my side)
