In every job that must be done  
There is an element of fun  
You find the fun and snap  
The job's a game  
In every task you undertake  
Becomes a piece of cake  
A lark, a spree  
It's very clear to see  
That a spoonful of sugar  
Helps the medicine go down  
The medicine go down  
Medicine go down  
Just a spoonful of sugar  
Helps the medicine go down  
In a most delightful way  
A robin feathering his nest  
Has very little time to rest  
While gathering his  
Bits of twine and twig  
Though quite intent in his pursuit  
He has a merry tune to toot  
He knows a song  
Will move the job along  
For a spoonful of sugar  
Helps the medicine go down  
The medicine go down  
Medicine go down  
Just a spoonful of sugar  
Helps the medicine go down  
In a most delightful way  
The honeybees that brings the nectar  
From the flowers to the comb  
Never tire ever buzzing to and fro, no  
Because they take a little nip  
From every flower that they sip  
And hence they find  
Their task is not a grind  
For a spoonful of sugar  
Helps the medicine go down  
The medicine go down  
Medicine go down  
Just a spoonful of sugar  
Helps the medicine go down  
In a most delightful way  
In a most delightful way
