How can you turn and walk away  
Leaving me here with things to say  
How can you stand and watch me fall  
Don't you feel no love at all  
I only want to say to you  
That it would break your Papa's heart  
For him to hear the things you say  
When we could make a brand new start  
  
[Chorus:]  
Will you hold me in your arms or let me go  
'Cause I want to show the world how much I know  
That I love you  
And I only want to be with you  
  
How do I know you'll always stay  
You're changing your mind most every day  
I'm telling you girl don't push too far no  
Just who do you think you are  
I only want to say to you  
That it would break your Mama's heart  
For her to hear the things you say  
When we could make a brand new start  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]  
  
Oh I love you so  
Are you ready, for a guy like me  
Come on baby, I'm on bended knee  
Are you ready to be loved by me again  
I only want to say to you  
That it would break my loving heart  
For me to see the things you do  
When we could make a brand new start  
Yes we could make a brand new start  
  
[Chorus:]
