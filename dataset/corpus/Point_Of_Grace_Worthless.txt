I woke up today with a revelation  
An introduction to the truth  
I knew the world was round  
What goes up comes down  
And maybe I  
Finally got it figured out  
Chorus  
A moment is worthless  
No meaning, purpose  
Every breath is just wasted  
If you are not the center of my world  
I'm just drifting, barely existing  
Every minute without you  
Is worthless  
You know the state of my condition  
And yet you hold me anyway  
So I won't take a step unless it's your direction  
Where was I  
Before I finally realized  
Chorus  
There's a void in my heart  
Where it's empty and dark  
Without You and Your love  
Lord, I'm broken apart  
I surrender my life  
To be right where You are
