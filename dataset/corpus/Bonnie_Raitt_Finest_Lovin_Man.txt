The man I'm lovin' don't worry 'bout me runnin' around  
You won't ever find my baby hustlin' after me all over town  
You don't have to shout, you don't even have to call  
Knows I'm comin' home even if I got to crawl  
He'll get me when he wants me, he's the finest lovin' man around  
When he gets up in the morning or when he comes home late at night  
You know the man's always hungry, knows I'm gonna cook it up just right  
He don't ever hurry, he just takes his time  
Just a little taste is all it takes to make him mine  
He'll get it when he wants it, he's the finest lovin' man around  
Some women they act just like their men will never amount to no good  
You know they are always on the cheat  
And never treat him like a good woman should  
You want him to do you right, honey, that ain't the way, yeah  
You got to love him all night, you do just what he say  
And you get just what you give out, that's the only way to gain his place  
Now me and my baby, we always know just what we're puttin' down  
And we know we'll be together  
Till the day when something better comes around  
Till that day comes you won't hear me complaining, yeah  
I'll take him like he is 'cause you know I can't change him  
I'll love him best I can, he's the finest lovin' man around  
Oh yeah yeah
