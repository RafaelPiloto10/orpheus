It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart.  
Without saying a word you can light up the dark.  
Try as I may I could never explain what I hear when you don't say a thing.  
  
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me.  
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me.  
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall.  
Now you say it best when you say nothing at all.  
  
All day long I can hear people talking out loud,  
but when you hold me near you drown out the crowd.  
Old Mister Webster could never define  
what's being said between your heart and mine.  
  
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me.  
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me.  
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall.  
Now you say it best when you say nothing at all.  
  
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me.  
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me.  
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall.  
Now you say it best when you say nothing at all.
