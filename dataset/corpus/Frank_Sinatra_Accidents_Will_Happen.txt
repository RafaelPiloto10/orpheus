The likes of you may never be attracted to the likes of me,  
But accidents will happen and I'll be around,  
And maybe there'll be no one else but me around.  
Forevermore may never start, you may ignore my hopeful heart,  
And chances are not the one to make you fall,  
But accidents will happen after all.  
A smile may show it, your eyes may glow  
Before you know it, I'm sure I'll know.  
So if you fall in just that way, oh wouldn't I be thrilled to hear you say  
I had a lovely accident today.  
Your eyes may glow, I'm sure I'll know.
