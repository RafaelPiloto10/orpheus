The radio plays the sounds we made  
And everything seems to feel just right  
Coming through your lonely mind  
Well I've seen things  
That scarred and bruised and left me blind  
So come on, listen along with me  
I think you need a little company  
  
And how long will I run for?  
Who am I running from?  
  
And it makes sense  
The youth coming up and making you dance  
'Cause I've got some living inside of me  
So come on I could use the company  
  
And how long will I run for?  
Who am I running from?  
But now I've seen my face in a cardboard wall  
Nobody comes, nobody calls  
  
How long will I run for?  
Who am I running from?  
Teenage tears sting my eyeballs  
In a town where I wasn't born  
And I will never suffer  
So come on, come on, come on  
But now I see my face in a cardboard wall  
Nobody comes, nobody calls  
  
If you're looking for me  
I'm there and it's you  
If you're looking for me out there it's true  
If you're looking for  
I'll be looking for you  
If you're looking for me  
Then I'm looking for you  
If you're looking for me  
Then I'm looking for you  
If you're looking for me  
Then I'm looking for you
