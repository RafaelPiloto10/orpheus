I, I got a new life, you would hardly recognize me, I'm so glad  
How can a person like me care for you?  
I, why do I bother, when you're not the one for me?  
Oo-hoo-hoo-oo-oo  
Is enough enough?  
  
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign  
Life is demanding without understanding  
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign  
No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong  
But where do you belong?  
  
I, under the pale moon, for so many years I wondered who you are  
How could a person like you bring me joy?  
Under the pale moon, where I see a lot of stars  
Oo-hoo-hoo-oo-oo  
Is enough enough?  
  
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign  
Life is demanding without understanding  
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign  
No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong  
But where do you belong?  
  
I saw the sign and it opened up my mind  
And I am happy now living without you  
I've left you  
Oh, oh-oh-oh  
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign  
No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong  
  
(I saw the sign, I saw the si-ee-ign) I saw the sign  
(I saw the sign, I saw the si-ee-i-ee-ign)  
(I saw the sign, I saw the sign)  
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
