When there's a dark storm on your horizon  
And you think you can't get through it  
Just put your hand in my hand  
And I'll show you how to do it  
When the future looks uncertain  
You can count on me to be there  
And when your heart and soul are hurtin'  
Just look and you'll see me there  
Just follow where I lead  
I'll give you what you need  
A love that's always true  
And someone who believes in you  
So when you're searching for that rainbow  
I will help you find it  
And when a mountain stands before you  
I will help you climb it  
Just follow where I lead  
I'll give you what you need  
A love that's always true  
And someone who believes in you  
It's time to come alive  
Your moment has arrived  
I'll bring out the best in you  
We can have it all  
No, we will never fall  
Looking down from our celestial view  
Just follow where I lead  
I'll give you what you need  
And I'll tell you something else  
You'll start believing in yourself  
It's an easy thing to do  
When you have someone who believes in you  
Someone who believes  
Someone who believes  
I'm someone who believes  
And you've got someone who believes in you
