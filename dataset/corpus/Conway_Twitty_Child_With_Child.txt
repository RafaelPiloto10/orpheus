She was still just a baby in her mama's eyes  
Daddy's little girl only yesterday, oh my how time flies  
She learned all about romance from watching tv  
And in one night alone with the boy down the street.  
  
Child With child, mother to be  
Carryin' a secret she know she can't keep  
Child With child, lying awake  
Thinking about all the hearts she will break.  
  
Will her friends all whisper when she passes by?  
Will there be shame or love in her daddy's eyes?  
She can run from her hometown but she can't run away  
From the new life inside her, growing each day.  
  
Child With child. Mother to be  
Carryin' a secret she knows she can't keep  
Child With child, lying awake  
Thinking about all the hearts she will break.  
  
She's just a child with child...
