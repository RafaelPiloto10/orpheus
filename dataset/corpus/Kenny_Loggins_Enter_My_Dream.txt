Enter my dream, baby  
Enter my dream  
  
Jung river won't you stop for me awhile  
Hold me like a sleepy child  
And take me where I'm bound to be  
  
I'm walking on the wings of make-believe  
I'm living out the fantasy  
That I know well  
I've been visiting there all my life  
  
'Cause you see  
  
[Chorus:]  
Happiness finds me sleeping  
There I know I go beyond reality  
It'll be effortless and easy  
Somebody take me there  
  
I'm living in a dream, baby  
Living in a dream  
  
I'll play for you  
You'll play a tune for me  
A masterpiece of harmony  
That everybody here can do  
  
A hundred writers pass the words along  
And suddenly we've made a song  
That sounds sweet and clear  
Something every dreamer can hear  
  
And we sing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm livin' in a...  
  
Enter my dream.  
  
You're waiting for the wind to start to rise  
Well take a look, and close your eyes  
Away to a place every dreamer can share  
  
And that's where  
Happiness finds us sleeping  
There I know I go beyond reality  
It'll be effortless and easy  
Somebody take me there  
Somebody take me where  
We'll be living in a dream, baby  
Enter my dream
