Hey little dreamer's eyes open and staring up at me  
Oh, little lovely eyes, oh, and radiant  
Wait until I come and I will steal you  
Wait until I come, I'll take your soul  
Wait until I come and I will steal you  
Wait until I come and I will go  
  
I will dream within the night  
Shadows on the windows  
Lead our love  
Every love will lead me on tonight  
I will lay you lying,  
I will not within this life  
  
Oh, little dreamer-eyes open and waving here  
Wait until I come, and I see them go!  
Then again I leave them (hee!)  
Until I come, I do come, love...  
  
We will leave it all behind  
Oh, and in the nightmares,  
I'll fill them in good time, oh  
They will 'seech your mind  
And no lying, and you may, well, ask,  
"Why do we run around here?"  
"Oh, why does it come inside me?"  
"Oh, why does it rip me all between?"  
Why then, why then, watch this little fuck!  
  
Going away, yeah...  
Why this lonely, why this lonely, why this lonely, love?  
Why this lonely, why this lonely, why this lonely, love?  
Oh I will carry on, burial, burial, burial, burial, burial  
And let them see  
But tell us, are you satisfied, with fucking up? Don't walk away, don't walk
away, don't walk away  
I'm talking to you!  
Lovey dove, love is hell, love is hell, love is up to you  
Love, love, love, love is up to you  
Love, love, love, love is up to you  
Fuck!  
  
In the sky is half-wrote  
Up from the ground,  
I stay out of breath  
I felt the temperature rises  
And I felt across the creeping (???)  
  
Ah, These graves... (???)
