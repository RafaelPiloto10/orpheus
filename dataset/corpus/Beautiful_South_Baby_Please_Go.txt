You've heard it said a thousand times  
But only heard his Broadway lines  
So, baby please go  
Ain't, ain't part of the show  
  
'Cause when Romeo needs no cue or prompt  
The likelier your little heart be stomped  
By, by baby don't go  
Written, written in to his show  
  
'Cause in the west-end show your life  
Played understudy to every part  
Got given all the dullest lines  
Whilst the chorus girls danced on your heart  
  
Baby please go (Baby please go)  
Baby please go (Baby please go)  
  
The sorry tale we'd all applaud  
That only dripped and never poured  
But, baby just go  
Let him, let him on with his show  
  
The leading snail leaves tell tale lines  
The bullshit tower the loudest chimes  
But, baby please go  
Ain't, ain't part of the show  
  
'Cause in the west-end show your life  
Played understudy to every part  
Got given all the dullest lines  
Whilst the chorus girls danced on your heart  
  
Baby please go (Baby please go)  
Baby please go (Baby please go)  
  
Romantic love lines that we adored (Baby forget them)  
They were read by men from idiot board (Baby forget them)  
So a message from the wisest guy to broad  
Is best like flattery ignored  
  
Baby just let him go  
Let him on with the show  
Baby just let him go  
Let him on with the show
