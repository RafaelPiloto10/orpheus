Baby would it be too much if I told you that I'm in love?  
Life has never been better, we are closer than ever  
Baby would it be alright if I took a bit of your time  
To tell you my little secret, promise that you will keep it?  
  
If I was ruler for a day and there were things that I could change  
I wouldn't change a thing that's how much you mean  
  
You're my favorite pastime and I'm so happy you're mine  
We have come so far you know but there's still farther we can go  
You're my favorite pastime and baby you make me smile  
With the happiness you bring, it makes me wanna sing  
  
Baby would it make you scared if I said I want to be there  
To hold you through all the bad times and guide you back to the sunshine?  
'Cause baby it would make me cry to not have you in my life  
How could I go on breathing when you're the air that I'm needing  
  
If I could have my every wish and there were things that I could switch  
I wouldn't switch a thing that's how much you mean  
  
You're my favorite pastime and I'm so happy you're mine  
We have come so far you know but there's still farther we can go  
You're my favorite pastime and baby you make me smile  
With the happiness you bring, it makes me wanna sing  
  
Oh, when I look at you I see the future  
That's happy ever after, we'll make it work  
Though I may not always please you I'll never grieve you  
You lift me up when I am down, so happy that I've found you  
  
'Cause baby you are my  
You're my favorite pastime and I'm so happy you're mine  
We have come so far you know but there's still farther we can go  
You're my favorite pastime and baby you make me smile  
With the happiness you bring, it makes me wanna sing  
  
I wanna sing to you  
I wanna sing to you, yeah
