Rough stuff...  
Your cheatin' lips taste sweet when they are pressed to mine  
Rough stuff  
I wish that I could break a leg but you're too fine  
You said you love me, but it's plain to see, you're not mine  
Rough stuff...  
You got me in your spell, I'm just the same to you  
Rough stuff...  
Why can't you settle down and give a love that's true  
I have lost my strut and I cry inside, I'm so blue  
Woo-woo-woo, I tried to tame you but it can't be done  
Woo-woo-woo-woo, I oughta hate you but I love you  
You're the only one, oh rough stuff  
You know I couldn't live if we should ever part  
Rough stuff  
I'm such a fool and you been foolin' from the start  
Still I hope and pray you will give your heart someday
