Tux on, tux on, tux on, tux on, tux on  
He has eyes down at the bingo on that lucky Friday night  
The match was rained off Saturday but the panel came in bright  
And on Sunday your mates were toasting you with champagne down the pub  
  
And on Monday you went to London  
To pick the cheque up with your mum  
You had a tux on, you had a tux on  
The first time you had a tux on, lucky man  
  
There's a photo on the mantelpiece, when you bought your first guitar  
And your girlfriend came to see you when you were the rising star  
You knew your luck was holding when you filled the local hall  
The first time and the last time that you thought you had control  
  
You had a tux on, lucky man, you had a tux on  
You got a tux on, tux on  
Now you're touring stadiums, you've let it go too far  
Standing with your manager, your back to every bar  
  
Burning all your credit cards, chopping out the pain  
Crowding into toilets with a host of your new-found friends  
You got a tux on, nothing's changed, you got a tux on  
Lucky man with a tux on, you're still the same with a tux on  
  
It was eyes down in the parlour, they prayed it wouldn't rain  
A brother pulled his cuffs down to hide the blue-black vein  
His razor'd more than lines out, they found him just too late  
The final performance, the main man lies in state  
  
With a tux on, look at him now with a tux on  
The last time with a tux on, take him away with a tux on  
Somewhere in a tenement, in a well-thumbed magazine  
Someone finds a photograph that triggers of a dream  
  
The uniform that symbolises the comfortable life  
He's always known his luck's in but now he's found the drive  
He's got a tux on, look at him now with a tux on  
He's gonna get one with a tux on, free admission with a tux on  
  
Get it anyway with a tux on  
He's got a tux on the easy way with a tux on, tux on
