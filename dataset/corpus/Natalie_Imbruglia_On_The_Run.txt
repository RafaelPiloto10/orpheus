I'm looking for a way  
To calm these voices in my head  
With all this mad confusion  
I don't want to leave this bed  
  
I'm on the run  
I'm on the run again  
  
And I don't know which way is left  
And there's no point in not being right  
So I'll hold my breath 'till I see the light  
I'm on the run  
I'm on the run again  
From me  
  
I'm drowning in these feelings  
And it's scaring me to death  
Staring at the ceiling  
So many things I could have said  
  
I'm on the run  
I'm on the run again  
  
And I don't know which way is left  
And there's no point in not being right  
So I'll hold my breath 'till the morning  
'Til I see the light  
  
So, so many times  
So many signs  
You're out there waiting  
I should have known you're out there waiting ooh  
  
And I don't know which way is left  
And there's no point in not being right  
So I'll hold my breath 'till the morning  
'Til I see the light  
I'm on the run  
I'm on the run again  
From me
