Well the first time that I saw you  
You were standing in the rain.  
You were waiting at the station  
For the last connecting train.  
Well, who will you go to  
When there's no-one to betray?  
And I said, who will you go to  
When your best friend turns away?  
Hey hey  
  
Last time you're gonna let me down.  
Last time you're gonna  
Fool around with me  
  
There's a garden full of roses,  
There's a necklace full of pearls.  
You have come to take the roses  
To give to other girls.  
Well, I am just a pretty thing  
You wanted for a day.  
There is nothing left between us  
There is nothing left to say,  
Hey hey  
  
People like you  
Can be so mean.  
People like you  
Just don't come clean.
