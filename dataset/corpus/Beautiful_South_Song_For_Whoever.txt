I love you from the bottom, of my pencil case  
I love you in the songs, I write and sing  
  
Love you because, you put me in my rightful place  
And I love the PRS cheques, that you bring  
  
Cheap, never cheap  
I'll sing you songs till you're asleep  
When you've gone upstairs I'll creep  
And write it all down  
  
Oh Shirley, Oh Deborah, Oh Julie, Oh Jane  
I wrote so many songs about you  
I forget your name (I forget your name)  
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, Deborah, Annabel, too  
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, Deborah, Annabel, too  
I forget your name  
  
I love your from the bottom of my pencil case  
I love the way you never ask me why  
I love to write about each wrinkle on your face  
And I love you till my fountain pen runs dry  
  
Deep so deep, the number one I hope to reap  
Depends upon the tears you weep, so cry, lovey cry, cry, cry, cry  
  
Oh Cathy, Oh Alison, Oh Phillipa, Oh Sue  
You made me so much money, I wrote this song for you  
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, Deborah, Annabel, too  
I wrote this song for you  
  
So let me talk about Mary, a sad story  
Turned her grief into glory  
Late at night, by the typewriter light,  
She ripped his ribbon to shreds
