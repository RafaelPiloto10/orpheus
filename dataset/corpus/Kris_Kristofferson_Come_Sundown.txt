I heard the front door closing softly  
As I awakened from my sleep  
With the last touch of her kips, Lord  
Like a whisper on my cheek  
  
And I cursed the sun for risin'  
'Cause the worst, Lord, was yet to come  
'Cause this morning, she's just leavin'  
But, come sundown, she'll be gone  
  
See the lipstick on the pillow  
That I placed beneath her head  
And the soft sheets still feel warm, Lord  
Where she lay upon my bed  
  
And it hurts to know it's over  
For the hurt, Lord, has just begun  
'Cause this morning, she's just leavin'  
But, come sundown, she'll be gone
