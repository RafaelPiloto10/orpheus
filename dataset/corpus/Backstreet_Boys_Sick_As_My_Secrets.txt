I'm so sorry  
That I called you  
I'm trying to pick up  
The pieces of my life  
I forgot that we were over  
Tell me what went wrong  
Wrong, wrong, wrong  
Twelve days, four hours, twenty minutes  
I'm stuck and you know you've got me in it  
Broken glass on the floor from the picture frame  
Shame, shame, shame  
We had it all  
This love so strong  
Now everything  
We had is gone  
If you could read my mind  
You'd know I've crossed that line  
  
Cos I'm as sick as my secrets  
Yeah, it's killing me  
You know that I mean it  
I need you next to me  
There's nowhere to run  
Girl I can't let you go  
And it's twisted I know  
But I just can't take it no more  
  
Six miles, twelve lights till your front door  
I'm on my way just like I have so many times before  
Does he know that it's me you've been talking to?  
Shame, shame, shame  
  
If you could read my mind  
I'm gonna fight to get you back this time  
  
Cos I'm as sick as my secrets  
Yeah, it's killing me  
You know that I mean it  
I need you next to me  
There's nowhere to run  
Girl I can't let you go  
And it's twisted I know  
But I just can't take it no more  
  
I'm tired of all these lies  
There's nothing but regret behind these eyes  
All this love I could never show  
I don't care any more  
Give a damn who knows  
  
Cos I'm as sick as my secrets  
Yeah, it's killing me  
You know that I mean it  
I need you back with me  
There's nowhere to run  
Girl I can't let you go  
And it's twisting my soul  
But I just can't take it no more  
  
Sick as my secrets  
Yeah, it's killing me  
You know that I mean it  
I need you next to me  
There's nowhere to run (nowhere to run)  
Girl I can't let you go (nowhere to hide)  
And it's twisted I know  
But I just can't take it no more  
  
Yeah, I just can't leave you alone  
Yeah, yeah  
Tired of all the lies  
Oh babe you've got me stripped of my pride  
Gonna shout it from a mountain top  
Yeah, drain the oceans from the tears we've cried  
Gonna break down these walls  
Gonna stand tall  
Gonna
