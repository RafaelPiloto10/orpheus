Broke the Breadline Nobody Knows  
I walked the frontline Still got far to go  
I mixed the water I drank the water  
I broke the breadline Don't wanna know  
  
It's staring me down Wearing a crown of apathy  
I'm standing around Dressed like a clown  
Don't know my name You know where to find me  
  
I killed the manchild I'll fast alone  
I had the midwife Naked and alone  
I mixed the water I drank the water  
I killed the brainchild I'll fast alone  
  
It's staring me down...  
  
Don't wanna let me be a man  
Don't wanna lead me to your home  
  
It's staring me down....  
  
I killed the manchild  
I had the midwife  
I drank the water  
I stand alone  
  
I broke the breadline  
I walked the frontline  
Don't know my name You know where to find me  
  
Don't wanna let me be a man  
Don't wanna lead me to your home
