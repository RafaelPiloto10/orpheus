Is there a better way  
Is there a better way  
Is there a better way ahead  
Or just another day  
  
Theres got to be a way  
To make a better day  
Im gonna find away  
To make a better day  
  
Youre never gonna be the one to hold me down  
Youre never gonna be the one to hold me down  
There never was a better way with you around  
No matter what I do  
Do what you got to do  
But do it now because the the time  
Is running out on you  
  
Youve got to find a way  
To make a better day  
Youve got to live and learn  
To fight another day  
  
Im never gonna be the one who put you down  
Im never gonna be the one who put you down  
You never know there may be someone in the crowd  
There may be someone in the crowd  
  
Is there a better way  
Is there a better way  
Is there a better way ahead  
Or just another day  
  
Maybe youll never know  
A better way to go  
Ive got a feeling  
You dont really want to know  
  
Ill never let you be the one to hold me down  
Ill never let you be the one to hold me down  
There never was a better way with you around  
There never was a better way  
  
Ill never let you be the one to hold me down  
Ill never let you be the one to hold me down  
There never was a better way with you around  
There never was a better way
