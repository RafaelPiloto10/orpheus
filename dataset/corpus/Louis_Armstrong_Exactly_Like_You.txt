I used to have a perfect sweetheart  
Not a real one, just a dream  
A wonderful vision of us as a team  
Can you imagine how I feel now  
Love is real now, it's ideal  
You're just what I wanted  
And now it's nice to live  
Paradise to live  
  
I know why I've waited  
Know why I've been blue  
Prayed each night for someone  
Exactly like you  
  
Why should we spend money  
On a show or two  
No one does those love scenes  
Exactly like you  
  
You make me feel so grand  
I want to hand the world to you  
I hope you'll understand  
Each foolish little scheme I'm schemin'  
And dream I'm dreamin'  
  
Now I know why mother  
Taught me to be true  
She meant me for someone  
Exactly like you
