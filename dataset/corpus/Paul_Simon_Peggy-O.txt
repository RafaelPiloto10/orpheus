As we marched down to Faneri-o  
As we marched down to Faneri-o  
Our captain fell n love with a lady like a dove  
And they called her name, pretty Peggy-o  
Come a runnin' down the stairs, pretty Peggy-o  
Come a runnin' down the stairs, pretty Peggy-o  
Come a runnin' down the stairs, combin' back  
Your yellow hair  
You're the prettiest little girl I've ever seen-o  
  
In a carriage you will ride, pretty Peggy-o  
In a carriage you will ride, pretty Peggy-o  
In a carriage you will ride, with your true love by  
Your side  
As far as any maiden in the are-e-o  
What will your mother say, pretry Peggy-o?  
What will your mother say, pretty Peggy-o?  
What will your mother say, when she finds you've  
Gone away  
To places far and strange to Faneri-o?  
  
If ever I return, pretty Peggy-o  
If ever I return, pretty Peggy-o  
If ever I return, all your cities I will burn  
Destroying all the ladies in the are-e-o  
Destroying all the ladies in the are-e-o
