(Hey!)  
  
Well I read the news today  
And the walrus said the lucky man made the grade yea  
Well ain't that great  
You say  
Well about the rest of that news left me empty and mad  
Singing the blues yeah  
Its sad but true  
  
'cause,  
Everything gets old, everyone is dumb  
So I keep changing  
Everything is gay, everyone is fake  
So I can't hang around  
  
Si-Si-Sitting back look with on your face  
Like I'm a piece of crap  
And you're a fucking ace well  
Its time to go  
You know?  
Hit the road jack  
Like the song goes you ain't ever coming back  
Because the world turned black  
Well don't you know?  
  
'cause,  
Everything gets old, everyone is dumb  
So I keep changing  
Everything is gay, everyone is fake  
So I can't hang around  
  
(Oh oh)  
  
Well don't you know?  
Everything gets old, everyone is dumb  
So I keep changing  
Everything is gay, everyone is fake  
So I can't hang around  
Everything gets old, everyone is dumb  
So I keep changing  
Every word they say  
Every word is fake  
  
So I won't be around  
  
Everything gets old, everyone is dumb  
Everything gets old, everyone is dumb  
Everything gets old, everyone is dumb
