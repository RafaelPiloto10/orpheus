I don't wanna be the one to say goodbye  
But I will, I will, I will  
I don't wanna sit on the pavement while you fly  
But I will, I will, oh yes I will  
  
'Cause maybe in the future, you're gonna come back  
You're gonna come back around  
Maybe in the future you're gonna come back  
You're gonna come back  
  
Oh, the only way to really know is to really let it go  
Maybe you're gonna come back, you're gonna come back  
You're gonna come back to me  
  
I don't wanna be the first to let it go  
But I know, I know, I know  
If you have the last hands that I want to hold  
Then I know I've got to let them go  
  
'Cause maybe in the future you're gonna come back  
You're gonna come back around  
Maybe in the future you're gonna come back  
You're gonna come back  
  
Oh, the only way to really know is to really let it go  
Maybe you're gonna come back, you're gonna come back  
You're gonna come back  
  
I still feel you on the right side of the bed  
And I still feel you in the blankets pulled over my head  
But I'm gonna wash away,(I'm gonna wash away) oh I'm gonna wash away  
Everything till you come home to me  
  
Maybe in the future you're gonna come back  
You're gonna come back  
In the future you're gonna come back  
You're gonna come back  
  
Maybe in the future you're gonna come back  
You're gonna come back around  
Maybe in the future you're gonna come back  
You're gonna come back  
  
Oh, the only way to really know is to really let it go  
Maybe in the future you're gonna come back  
You're gonna come back around  
Maybe in the future you're gonna come back  
You're gonna come back  
  
Oh, the only way to really know is to really let it go  
Maybe you're gonna come back, you're gonna come back  
You're gonna come back to me,  
You're gonna come back to me  
You're gonna come back to me
