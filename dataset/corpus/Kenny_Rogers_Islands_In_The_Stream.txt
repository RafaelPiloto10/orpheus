Baby when I met you there was peace unknown  
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb  
I was soft inside there was something going on  
  
You do something to me that I can't explain  
Hold me closer and I feel no pain every beat of my heart  
We got something going on  
  
Tender love is blind it requires a dedication  
All this love we feel needs no conversation  
We ride it together, uh huh  
Makin' love with each other, uh huh  
  
Islands in the stream that is what we are  
No one in between how can we be wrong?  
Sail away with me to another world  
And we rely on each other, uh huh  
From one lover to another, uh huh  
  
I can't live without you if the love is gone  
Everything is nothing if you got no one  
And you did walk in the night  
Slowly losin' sight of the real thing  
  
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt  
Too deep in love and we got no way out  
And the message is clear this could be the year for the real thing  
  
No more will you cry, baby I will hurt you never  
We start and end as one in love forever  
We can ride it together, uh huh  
Makin' love with each other, uh huh  
  
Islands in the stream that is what we are  
No one in between how can we be wrong?  
Sail away with me to another world  
And we rely on each other, uh huh  
From one lover to another, uh huh  
  
Islands in the stream that is what we are  
No one in between how can we be wrong?  
Sail away with me to another world  
And we rely on each other, uh huh  
From one lover to another, uh huh  
  
Islands in the stream that is what we are  
No one in between how can we be wrong?  
Sail away with me to another world  
And we rely on each other, uh huh  
From one lover to another, uh huh  
  
Islands in the stream that is what we are
