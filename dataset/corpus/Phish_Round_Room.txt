My room is tound when I lay dowm when I wake up it's sqare  
When I go outside it's on a spiral set of stairs  
The people that souround me are waiting out there  
In a round room they can't find me anywhere  
  
Right angle rooms drive me craizer each day  
Put me in a box I know I'm never going to play  
Put me in a square room and I won't know what to say  
I want a round room at the end of the day  
  
I had an apartment, four corners on the walls  
couldn't eat, couldn't sleep there at all  
I want a curve to the place where I stay  
I want a round room at the end of the day  
  
If I pass out take me to the round church  
where echoes resound  
and my spirit is found  
and when I float high  
Take my armand I'll fly by you  
The outskirts of town, to a garden that's round  
  
I went to the lighthouse and I likes the veiw  
I looked out the window and I could see you  
Put me in a sqare house and I won't have a clue  
I want a round room just to be with you
