I said hello, Dolly,  
Well, hello, Dolly  
It's so nice to have you back where you belong  
You're lookin' swell, Dolly  
I can tell, Dolly  
You're still glowin'  
You're still crowin'  
You're still goin' strong  
I feel that room swayin'  
While the band's playin'  
One of your old favourite songs from way back when  
So take her wrap, fellas  
Find her an empty lap, fellas  
Dolly'll never go away again

While that ole band keeps on playin'  
One of your old favourite songs from way back when  
So golly, gee, fellas  
Find her an empty knee, fellas  
Dolly'll never go away  
I said she'll never go away  
Dolly'll never go away again
