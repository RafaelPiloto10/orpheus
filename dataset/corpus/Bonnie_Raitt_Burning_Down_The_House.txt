Watch out, you might get what you're after  
Cool baby, you're strange but not a stranger  
I'm an ordinary girl  
And I'm burnin' down the house  
  
Hold tight, wait till this party's over  
Hold tight, well we're gonna be in for some nasty weather  
There has got to be a way  
And we're burnin' down the house  
  
Here's your ticket, pack your bags, it's time for goin' overboard  
Transportation is here  
Close enough but we're not too far, bet you're wonderin' where you are  
Fight fire with fire  
  
Burning down the house  
  
All wet, and you might need a raincoat  
Shake down, my dreams are walkin' in broad daylight  
365 degrees  
And we're burnin' down the house  
  
My house, out of the ordinary  
That's right, I don't want to really hurt nobody  
Some things sure sweep me off my feet  
And we're burnin' down the house
