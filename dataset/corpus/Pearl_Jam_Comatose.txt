Consider me an object  
Put me in a vacuum  
Free of all conditions  
Free of air and friction  
Yea, I'll be hanging upside down.  
And there I will swing  
For all eternity  
Fell it rising, yea next stop falling  
Feel it rising, comatose, with no fear of falling  
Consider me an abscess  
Leave me in my vacuum  
Blood on all the pistons  
Running my transmission  
Feel it rising, yea next stop falling  
Feel it rising, comatose, with no fear of falling  
Feel it rising, yeah next stop falling  
Feel It rising  
High above I'll break the law,  
If it's illegal to be in love,  
Leave the hatred, on the cross  
Yea I'll be hanging upside down and here I will swing  
For all eternity  
Feel it rising, yea next stop falling  
Feel it rising, comatose with no fear of falling  
Feel it rising, yea, next stop falling  
Feel it rising  
Something never thought you'd be part of...
