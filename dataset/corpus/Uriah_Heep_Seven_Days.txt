I don't care if the rain don't shine  
Oh, I don't care if the sun don't fall  
You are the one in a million, child  
And you knew that I would call  
Thoughts of you alone with me  
I can't slow them down  
But I can't sleep at night  
Because you're not around  
I can't wait  
Seven days is a long time  
To be waiting for you girl  
I can't wait  
Seven days is just too long  
To be without you girl  
I've tried every kind of distraction  
But nothing will ease this pain  
There is only one solution, girl  
So why do you make me wait  
Got to say I didn't think  
That I could read your mind  
But I can't sleep at night  
'cause baby you're on mine  
I can't wait  
Seven days is a long time  
Oh, I miss you girl  
I can't wait  
Seven days is just too long  
I can't wait  
Seven days is a long time  
To be without you  
I can't wait  
Seven days is just too long  
Just too long
