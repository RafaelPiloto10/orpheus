Which way you gonna go  
To the left or to the right  
Gonna go up gonna go down  
I ain't got no clue tonight  
  
Which way you gonna run  
To the east or to the west  
To the north to the south  
Which way you like the best  
  
You only do things Your Way  
Baby Your Way  
You only like things Your Way  
Baby Your Way  
  
Which Way You Gonna Turn  
When you find it's all wrong  
Which way you gonna turn  
When it all comes out wrong  
  
When you find you're not that strong  
Oh baby baby  
I hope you get along
