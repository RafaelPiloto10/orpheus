Today, we stood on the wall,  
We laughed at the sun,  
We laughed at the guns,  
We laughed at it all  
And when they, they told us to go,  
We paid them no mind,  
Like any other time,  
But little did we know...  
  
Today, I look for a sign, with flames in my hands,  
A line in the sand, between yours and mine,  
And it came, like fire from below,  
Your greed led the call, my flag had to fall,  
But little did you know  
  
Another day, your truth will come,  
You're gonna pay for what you,  
Pay for what you've done,  
You'll get what's yours,  
And face your fraud,  
You're gonna give me back what's mine  
Give me back what's mine!  
  
I ain't never been a coward, I aint never seen blood,  
You had sold me an ocean and I was lost in the flood,  
We were counting on a leader,  
We were driven by need, couldn't take temptation,  
And we were blinded by greed,  
You were steady as a sniper,  
We were waiting on a wire,  
So we never saw it coming,  
When you ran from the fire,  
You can try intimidation,  
Or you can try to roar,  
But when the time comes calling,  
Yeah! You are gonna get yours!  
  
Another day, your truth will come,  
You're gonna pay for what you,  
Pay for what you've done,  
You'll get what's yours,  
And face your fraud,  
You're gonna give me back what's mine  
Give me back what's mine!  
  
And so today, your truth has come,  
You're gonna pay for what you,  
Pay for what you've done,  
You'll get what's yours,  
You're out of time,  
And you will give me back what's mine  
Give me, give me back what's mine!  
  
Give me, give me back what's mine!  
What's mine, give me, give me back what's mine!  
What's mine! What's mine!  
Give me back what's mine!  
  
Today, we stood on the wall,  
We laughed at the sun, we laughed at the guns,  
We laughed at it all  
And when they, they told us to go,  
We paid them no mind, like any other time,  
But little did we know...
