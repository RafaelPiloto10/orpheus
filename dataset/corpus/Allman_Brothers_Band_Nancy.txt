Oh-oh  
  
Walking in the midnight rain  
Thought I heard a southbound train  
Call your name  
Nancy  
  
Walking in the rain all day  
Guess there wasn't nobody goin' my way  
They didn't stop at all  
But I will get back to you if I have to crawl  
  
Nancy I told you in my letter  
Things didn't appear to be no better at all  
And this ol' highway's a hell of a line  
Nancy I just spent my last dime to make this call  
Oh Nancy  
I'll get back to you if I have to crawl  
Oh yeah  
  
[solo]  
  
Oh yeah, mmmmm  
  
I left my home for a job in the city  
It's a crying shame  
It's a pity  
It ain't livin' at all  
Nobody knows my name  
They don't even give a thang about me t'all  
Nancy  
Baby I'm getting back to you if I have to crawl  
Ohh  
  
Nancy I told you in my letter  
Things didn't appear to be no better at all  
This ol' highway's a hell of a line  
Nancy I just spent my last dime to make this call  
Nancy  
Baby I'll get back to you if I have to crawl  
Oh yeah yeah oh oh  
Oh Nancy  
Oh Nancy
