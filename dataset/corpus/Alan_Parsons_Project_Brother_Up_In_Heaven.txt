(bairnson)  
  
A boy flies for freedom  
But dies for the peace  
In the clouds, he waits for an answer  
But there's no release  
  
It's strange here without you  
And it's so hard to see  
So brother up in heaven  
Please wait up for me  
  
Oh brother up in heaven  
Please wait up for me  
  
I still see his shadow  
His laugh lingers on  
When I dream, we're all back together  
When I wake, he's gone  
It's strange here without you  
This was not ment to be  
So brother up in heaven  
Please wait up for me  
  
And though we try to change the world  
A flower when it's cut will surely die  
So why do men with so much hate  
Destroy what they cannot create  
While we all stand by  
  
We will look back in anger  
But you helped us to see  
So brother up in heaven  
Please wait up for me  
  
Oh brother up in heaven  
Please wait up for me
