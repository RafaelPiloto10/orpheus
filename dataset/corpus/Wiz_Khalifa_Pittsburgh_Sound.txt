Yea  
Its Wiz Khalifa man  
Its that 412  
I got that Pittsburgh sound  
  
Around these parts  
I'm known as the youngest in charge  
My shit bang out the trunk of your car  
Its the cities known rap spitta  
Semi blown clack niggas  
Skin and bones but really known as that nigga  
I'm known to chase the bucks  
Grind to get my paper up  
In the studio writin' rhymes til the paper crunch  
I'm not the type that you would call em a thug  
But I'm a hustler its all in my blood  
So if its all for the cheese then I'm in it  
My screws kinda loose so I ease to the finish  
I hop up in the coupe feel the breeze while I'm in it  
Blowin' smoke up out the roof from the trees that I'm spliffin'  
Youngin' got the game on lock  
I'm on top its a shame y'all not  
You a lame put your brain on pot  
Leave you wet like the rain y'all drop  
I'm gon' rock and I ain't gon' stop, nigga  
  
[Chorus]  
Who's the kid spittin' flames  
Changin' the game  
His name, its wiz khalifa man  
From the home of the brick  
Where they know for the cake  
The place, that steel city damn  
I got that Pittsburgh sound  
And Imma always hold pittsburgh down  
Its Wiz Khalifa man  
You cant tell by now  
Pittsburgh Imma swell my town  
That steel city damn  
  
Roll rubber you don't know who you dealin' with  
Oh so innocent but flows so billigant  
My spit games like a 44 killin' shit  
Know your man warm but the young ball killin' shit  
Realist shit and your main wife dig me  
Game try and hit me  
Kick game like 50 cent  
Niggas wanna play games I quickly  
Mob with a squad that will bang y'all wit' me  
And they want the kid still hurtin'  
Hundred niggas wit hammers  
Yea that's wat I call a steal curtain  
I handle my time and still work it  
Put in work couple mil. worth in  
And I'm from Pittsburgh where the green  
And the eatin' is good  
Where the fiends do everything in the hood  
Everyday is like a war so my soldiers ride fatiguesin the hood  
And we gettin' all the green like we should  
You know yea  
  
[Chorus]
