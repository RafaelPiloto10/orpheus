I used to visit the very gay places  
Those come what may places  
Where one relaxes on the axis  
Of the wheel of life  
To get the feel of life  
From jazz and cocktails  
  
All the men I knew had sad and  
Sullen gray faces  
With distingue traces  
That used to be there  
You could see where  
They'd been washed away  
By too many through the day  
Twelve o'clock tales  
  
Then you came along with your  
Siren song  
To tempt me to madness  
I knew all the while  
That your poignant smile  
Was tinged with the sadness of a  
Great love for me  
Oh, yes I was wrong  
Again I was wrong  
  
Now life is lonely again  
And only last year everything  
Seemed so sure  
Now life is awful again  
A troughful of hearts would only  
Be a bore  
A week in Paris will ease the bite  
Of it  
But all I really care  
Is to smile in spite of it  
I'll forget you  
I will and yet you are still  
Burning inside my brain  
  
Romance is mush, stifling those  
Who strive  
I'll live a lush life in some  
Small dive  
And there I'll be  
While I rot with the rest  
Of those whose lives are  
Lonely too
