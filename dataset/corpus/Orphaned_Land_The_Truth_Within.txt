Fons et origo boni ple luxque perenis  
Salvificet pietas tua nos bone rector, eleison  
  
The golden wine flows through my veins  
I know the meaning behind the holy words  
A lesson must be learned - so listen all  
Let your heart rule or we all must fall  
We cry out for help, a prayer for your soul  
When you will know the end is near,  
You will faster crawl  
  
The whole body withdraws with the pain of birth  
And once again I know the true meaning of life  
Once again I know that looking through their eyes  
...As they came with their love...  
I know the truth of life and it lies before my eyes  
The truth lies within you know  
The truth lies within the holy words
