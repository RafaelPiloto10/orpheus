Shadows fall  
Through the darkness we reach  
As the hunger calls  
Then you run  
To the passion that takes you over  
  
No lookin' back  
The chance will never come again  
You risk it all  
For your dream  
Won't let you go  
  
When you feel the hunger  
Drivin' you on  
To your one desire  
Alone through an endless night  
And the need's never satisfied  
  
Through these eyes  
Seen a river of tears  
Seen the strong survive  
Separate lives  
And the emptiness makes you wonder  
Blame it on love  
  
You had it all and it's not enough  
You'll never change  
A slave to the fire  
It never ends  
  
Still you've got the hunger  
Drivin' you on  
To your one desire  
Never deny your heart  
  
The need to be satisfied  
Still you feel the hunger  
The primitive right  
Of a restless breed  
Surrendering all your life  
To the true nature of the beast  
  
No looking back  
The chance will never come again  
You give it all to your dream  
It never ends
