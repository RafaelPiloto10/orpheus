From front to back street listen we on a mission  
To get right workin' street corner in the midnight  
Picture the scene these fiends with fire  
Ten dollar dreams scheme for a sack of that believe that  
I'm wit whateva like Wheatstraw  
Stuck servin' my cocaine raw  
Drop sixty two off the brick jump back  
Twenty over now that's mo' money to get  
Slick we fin' to lick on this corner without gettin' caught  
But time, keep a sleepin' and money gettin' short  
Plus that crooked cop Brock think we blow slangin' (fuck him)  
That why he ride through the hole with the do' swangin'  
But I make moves shake them tricks up out they shoestrings  
Be more precise when we do things  
'Cause life like shakin' the dice, but I buck back twice  
Like five-deuce, fo'trey, okay  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I'm strickly dressin' dirty dirty  
Gone represent it to the t-top  
Born and bred up on the street top  
Get to the money and the sweet spot  
And forever hollerin'  
"Hootie Hoo!" when we see cops  
  
Sheyit  
Cops and robbers niggaz be bound to get them dollars and cents  
They get in a slump like baseball players  
When they short on they rent  
Anything goin' you ain't knowin' how much money YOU spent  
But in the real world you surrounded by these ladies and gents  
Who hang around you cause you be buyin' all the weed  
And all the chicken  
Feedin' everybody, smokin' 'em out  
When you was broke though they was missin'  
Now you ridin' bout fo' deep, startin' to tear up yo' suspension  
And your baby mamma on child support  
My fault, forget to mention  
You don't even have a checkin' account  
Wasn't thinkin' about no pension  
I used to work at Steak 'N' Ale, Old Gold off in the kitchen  
Had determination and graduated  
Now I got the whole rap world fascinated  
I wanted a piece of the pie for me and my family so I made it  
Continue to sell dope, it's payin' the bills so you gon' do it  
But legislation got this new policy  
Three strikes and you're ruined now where your crew at?  
Yeah.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ay  
Me and my buddy on the cut and they know we servin em slabs  
We better watch what we doin', and look out for Joe Nab  
And quit re'in-up and standin' on this same old block  
Before our gangsta ass partna get both of us shot  
Niggaz talkin' cause they makin' some flow  
But still ain't did nuttin' that ain't been done befo'  
You can't be tryin' to showcase, just put it down for your spot  
And improvise and work with that little you got  
So I think when I finish sellin' my last sack  
I'ma take some of this money, go and give some back  
'Cause people won't forget about the time you gave, knowmsayin'?  
And start thinkin' bout a path to pave  
  
[Chorus]
