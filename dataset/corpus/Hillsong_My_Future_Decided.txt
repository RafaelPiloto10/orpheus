You hold the future in your hands  
You know my dreams and you have a plan  
And as you light my way, I'll follow you  
  
My eyes on all of the above  
My soul secure in all you've done  
My minds made up  
And you are the only one for me  
  
Jesus, savior, in my life you are everything  
My future decided, I will praise your name  
And I know that I am, I am yours  
Yeah, I know that I am, I am yours  
  
You hold the earth in your command  
You are the rock on which I stand  
And as I live each day, I'll follow you  
  
My eyes on all of the above  
My soul secure in all you've done  
My minds made up  
And you are the only one for me  
  
Jesus, savior, in my life you are everything  
My future decided, I will praise your name  
And I know that I am, I am yours  
Yeah, I know that I am, I am yours  
  
Aren't afraid, aren't ashamed Lord we know who we are  
We are your people and we won't be silent  
Unified hear us cry at the top of our lungs  
You our God and we will not be shaken
