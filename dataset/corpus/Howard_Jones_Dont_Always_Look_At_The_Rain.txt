Some people I know have given up on their lives  
Drowning their sorrows, and mumblin', and forgot the fight  
We can tip the balance we can break those barriers down  
Little things count as much as the big and turn it all around  
  
And it's oh, don't always look at the rain  
No, don't look at the rain  
  
Some people I know have lost their feel for mystery  
They say everything has got to be proved, this isn't a nursery  
And joseph who's five years old, stops fights in his playground yard  
No more fights and bigotry, oh is it so hard  
  
And it's oh, don't always look at the rain  
No, don't always look at the rain  
Ha, don't always look at the rain  
  
And tell me, is it a crime to have an ideal or two  
Evolving takes it's time, we can't do it all in one go  
Doesn't have to drive us all mad, we can only do our best  
Let the mind shut up, and the heart do the rest
