[The docks. Sailors, whores and their customers, pimps, etc. Fantine wanders
in.]  
  
Sailors  
I smell women  
Smell 'em in the air  
Think I'll drop my anchor  
In that harbor over there  
Lovely ladies  
Smell 'em through the smoke  
Seven days at sea  
Can make you hungry for a poke  
Even stokers need a little stoke!  
  
Whores  
Lovely ladies  
Waiting for a bite  
Waiting for the customer  
Who only comes at night  
Lovely ladies  
Waiting for the call  
Standing up or lying down  
Or any way at all  
Bargain prices up against the wall  
  
Old Woman  
Come here, my dear  
Let's see this trinket you wear  
This bagatelle...  
  
Fantine  
Madame, I'll sell it to you...  
  
Old Woman  
I'll give you four  
  
Fantine  
That wouldn't pay for the chain  
  
Old Woman  
I'll give you five, you're far to eager to sell, it's up to you.  
  
Fantine  
It's all I have  
  
Old Woman  
That's not my fault  
  
Fantine  
Please make it ten  
  
Old Woman  
No more than five  
My dear, we all must stay alive!  
  
Whores  
Lovely ladies  
Waiting in the dark  
Ready for a thick one  
Or a quick one in the park  
Long time short time  
Any time, my dear  
Cost a little extra if you want to take all year!  
Quick and cheap is underneath the pier!  
  
Crone  
What pretty hair  
What pretty locks you got there  
What luck you got, it's worth a centime my dear  
I'll take the lot  
  
Fantine  
Don't touch me leave me alone  
  
Crone  
Let's make a price, I'll give you all of ten francs  
Just think of that!  
  
Fantine  
It pays a debt  
  
Crone  
Just think of that  
  
Fantine  
What can I do? It pays a debt.  
Ten francs may save my poor Cosette!  
  
Whores  
Lovely ladies  
Lovely little girls  
Lovely ladies  
Lovely little ladies  
Lovely girlies  
Lovely little girls  
We are lovely, lovely girls  
Lovely ladies  
What's a lady for? Sailors  
Lovely lady!  
Fastest on the street  
Wasn't there three minutes  
She was back up on her feet  
Lovely lady!  
What yer waiting for?  
Doesn't take a lot of savvy  
Just to be a whore  
Come on, lady  
What's a lady for?  
  
[Fantine re-emerges, her long hair cut short.]  
  
Pimp  
Give me the dirt, who's that bit over there?  
  
Whore 1  
A bit of skirt, she's the one sold her hair.  
  
Whore 2  
She's got a kid sends her all that she can  
  
Pimp  
I might have known  
There is always some man  
Lovely lady, come along and join us!  
Lovely lady!  
  
Whores  
Come on dearie, why all the fuss?  
You're no grander than the rest of us  
Life has dropped you at the bottom of the heap  
Join your sisters, make money in your sleep!  
  
[Fantine goes off with one of the sailors.]  
  
That's right dearie, let him have the lot  
That's right dearie, show him what you've got!  
  
Old men, young men, take 'em as they come  
Harbor rats and alley cats and every type of scum  
Poor men, rich men, leaders of the land  
See them with their trousers off they're never quite as grand  
All it takes is money in your hand!  
Lovely ladies  
Going for a song  
Got a lot of callers  
But they never stay for long  
  
Fantine  
Come on, Captain  
You can wear your shoes  
Don't it make a change  
To have a girl who can't refuse  
Easy money  
Lying on a bed  
Just as well they never see  
The hate that's in your head  
Don't they know they're making love  
To one already dead!
