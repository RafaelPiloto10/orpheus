In my young life I have received  
Callers though they were Christmas Eve  
I'm disappointed and I don't know why  
She gave me laughter and hope  
And a sock in the eye.  
  
In my young life I know something now.  
I've never tried to create a wow  
Wows are few frustration more common  
Now I can feel it in my soul  
That's why I gave the come on.  
  
Kiss me with your mouth  
Your love is better than wine  
Kiss me with your mouth  
Your love is better than wine  
But wine is all I have  
Will your love ever be mine?  
  
Faces fall before my feet  
Like blood onto a clean white sheet  
When I grow old I won't forget  
To innocence my only debt  
  
Wow I feel so fresh today  
Barefoot in the snow to make love in the hay  
The stars are bright in the abyss  
Now I can feel you in my arms  
I explode inside your kiss.  
  
Kiss me with your mouth  
Your love is better than wine  
But wine is all I have  
Will your love ever be mine?  
  
Kiss me with your mouth  
Your love is better than wine  
Kiss me with your mouth  
Your love is better than wine  
But wine is all I have  
Will your love ever be mine?
