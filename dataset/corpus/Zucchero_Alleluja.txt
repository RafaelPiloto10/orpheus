The shadow dance  
Is ready now to take us over  
I don't know why  
I don't know why  
  
The moon's alive  
The sun has gone and run for cover  
Burning blind  
Burning blind  
  
Darkness waits  
I'm dancing with the devil's lover  
To pass the time  
To pass the time  
  
And all of this is just a game  
We tell each other  
Alleluja  
She'll always try to rule ya  
  
She'll be laughing, at the night  
But don't you let that fool ya  
She said she came from far away  
To find a lover  
  
I don't know why  
I don't know why  
She said she knew  
That we would always be together  
  
And then she cried  
And then she cried  
I spend my nights in wonder  
If I'll ever know her  
  
She's in my mind  
She's in my mind  
She laughs and turns smiles  
And blushes like a flower  
  
Alleluja  
She'll always try to rule ya  
She'll be laughing  
Lauging at the night  
  
Alleluja  
You'll need to find the answer  
Bur neon doesn't shed  
That kind of light  
  
But don't you let that fool ya
