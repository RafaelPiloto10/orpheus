I've come to tell you 'bout the story I see  
It made of honey but it sting like a bee  
Got the message that it come from the floor  
And that's the way to get yourself in trouble  
  
You think it's easy 'cause you don't know the feeling  
Make it up  
Make it up like you do no wrong  
Give me fever like a man blind from passion  
If you got the time I'll show you how to turn it on  
  
Please  
You got that need  
  
She got her ways to get me down on the floor  
And take me places that I never seen before  
Someone told me I got to take it easy  
But I'm a junkie  
A junkie when the heat is on
