I talk to you but it's not the same as touchin' you  
And every time you whisper my name, I want to run to you  
Well be together, it won't be long, it won't be long  
But it feels like forever, and it's hard to be strong  
  
[Chorus:]  
Baby 'cause I'm missing you now  
And it's drivin' me crazy  
How I'm needin' you baby  
I'm missing you now  
Can't wait 'till I'm alone with you  
To show you how I'm missing you now  
  
Wishin' you were here by my side is all that I can do  
Got my arms around my pillow at night, they should be holdin' you  
Thought I was stronger, how could I know, how could I know  
I can't take this much longer  
It's so hard on my soul  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Baby I just can't wait  
Till I see your face  
Chase away this loneliness inside  
  
When you're close to my heart  
Right here in my arms  
Then and only then  
Will I be satisfied  
I'm missing you now  
We'll be together, it won't be long, it won't be long  
But it feels like forever, and it's hard to be strong  
  
[Chorus]
