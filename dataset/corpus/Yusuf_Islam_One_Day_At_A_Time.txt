One day at a time  
We can learn to leave the past behind  
One day at a time  
We can look the future in the eye  
One day at a time  
We can learn to live  
  
The gates of the garden are open  
Wide and the trusting  
70 thousand will enter  
Of them without reckoning  
  
One day at a time  
We can learn to leave our fears behind  
One day at a time  
We can stare our hopes in the eye  
One day at a time  
We can learn to live  
  
And if you meet the evening  
Don't wait for the sun to rise  
  
One day at a time  
We can leave all treasures behind  
One day at a time  
We can watch the clocks unwind  
  
One day at a time  
A child is born into this world eyes blind  
One day he will find his sign  
And glimpse some other kind of life  
To live by, one day  
  
One day at a time  
We can put machines behind  
One day at a time  
We can learn how birds survive  
One day at a time  
We can learn to fly
