Dearly beloved  
If this love only exists in my dreams  
Don't wake me up  
  
Too much light in this window,  
Don't wake me up,  
Only coffee no sugar inside my cup,  
If I wake and you're here still, gimme a kiss,  
I wasn't finished dreamin' about your lips  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't wake me up, up, up, up, up, up  
Don't wake me up, up, up, up, up, up  
Don't wake me up, up, up, up, up, up  
Don't wake me up  
Don't wake me  
Don't wake me up  
Don't wake me up  
Don't wake me up, yeah  
Don't wake me up, up, up, up, up, up  
Don't wake me up  
Don't wake me  
  
So much life in the city you won't believe,  
Been awake for some days now, no time to sleep,  
If your heart is a pillow, this love's the bed,  
Tell me what is the music inside my head  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't wanna fall, fall, fall, fall asleep no,  
I don't wanna fall unless I'm falling for you  
I don't wanna fall, fall, fall, fall asleep no,  
I don't wanna fall unless I'm falling for you  
  
Don't wake me up  
Don't wake me up  
Don't wake me up, yeah  
Don't wake me up, up, up, up, up, up  
Don't wake me up  
Don't wake me
