When you said you were leaving tomorrow that today was our last day  
I said there'd be no sorrow that I'd laugh when you walked away  
But a little bitty tear let me down spoiled my act as a clown  
I had it made up not to make a frown but a little bitty tear let me down  
  
I said I'd laugh when you left me full of funny as you went out the door  
That I'd have another one a waitin' I'd wave goodbye as you go  
But a little bitty tear...  
  
Everything went out like I planned it and I really put on quite a show  
I thought that I was gonna stand it but when you've got through the door  
But a little bitty tear...  
When you said you were leaving...
