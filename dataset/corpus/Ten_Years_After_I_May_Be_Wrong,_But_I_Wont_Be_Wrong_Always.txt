Tell me baby, tell what's on your mind  
Tell me baby, tell what's on your mind  
Love you, baby, but I hate your hurtin' kind  
  
Baby, baby, I've got news for you  
Baby, baby, I've got news for you  
Love you, baby, I don't know what to do  
  
Baby, baby, what's on your worried mind  
Baby, baby, what's on your worried mind  
Love you, darlin', but I hate your hurtin' kind  
  
Well, the moon looks lonesome, shining through the tree  
The moon looks lonesome, shining through those trees  
How do you look sad, when your baby packs up to leave  
  
Baby, baby, what's on your worried mind  
I say, baby, baby, what's on your worried mind  
I don't cheat you, baby, I love you all the time  
  
Love to hear my baby call my name  
Love to hear my baby call my name  
Cause now you've got a man, but I call those rings, call me  
  
Tell me baby, tell what's on your mind  
Tell me baby, tell what's on your mind  
Love you, baby, but I hate your hurtin' kind  
  
Baby, baby, what's all that wrong with you  
Baby, baby, what's all that wrong with you  
Love you baby, I don't know what to do  
  
I may be wrong, but I won't be wrong always  
I may be wrong, but I won't be wrong always  
I love you, baby, love you in my own sweet way
