The waves that silences break come again,  
One by one  
I lay awake and I count til I drown  
Turn off the room, it's getting too loud,  
I know I don't have to say it,  
Pick up and move and go find some new ground,  
Somewhere I know I can make it  
  
But I won't give up,  
When I want it enough,  
No I won't give up,  
Anything, anyway, anyone, anyday  
'Cause I've figured it out,  
Here and the now,  
Takes me day by day  
  
Hey, will you come out tonight?  
Will you back down will you put up a fight?  
Turn me around and make eveything right,  
Make me normal, from now on  
  
Erased every one I've replaced  
In the end, they're all gone,  
The faces all fade as the time passes by  
What could I do I was waiting for you,  
Grown sick and tired of faking,  
Give me those eyes when I give you the truth,  
Finally here for the taking  
  
But I won't give up,  
When I want it enough,  
No I won't give up,  
Anything, anyway, anyone, anyday  
Cause I've figured it out,  
Here and the now,  
Takes me day by day  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Hey, will you come out tonight?  
Will you back down will you put up a fight?  
Turn me around and make eveything right,  
Make me normal, from now on  
  
Figured it out,  
Here and the now,  
Takes me day by day  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Hey, will you come out tonight?  
Will you back down will you put up a fight?  
Turn me around and make everything right,  
Make me normal, from now on  
  
Make me normal, from now on  
Make me normal, from now on  
Make me normal, from now on
