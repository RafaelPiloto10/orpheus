Darling, been to see the preacher man  
Darling darling, started making wedding plans  
Your lips set my soul on fire  
To be with you that's my one desire  
Oh darling  
Think it's gonna work out fine  
Darling, started getting next to me  
Darling, though about how this could be  
Ooee  
If your love is half as true  
As the love I'm offering you  
Oh darling, I think it's gonna work out fine  
Think it's gonna work out fine  
Know it's gonna work out fine  
Think it's gonna work out fine  
I'm so glad that you're mine all mine  
Do you remember they used to call you Dapper Dan  
Way back when I was the killer and everybody's loving man  
Whole lotta women used to be my speed  
Now pretty baby you're all I need  
Oh darling, think it's gonna work out fine  
He's so, I'm so, we're so glad when we remember  
Used to call me Dapper Dan yeah  
Way back when you were the killer and everybody's loving man  
Whole lotta women used to be my speed  
Now pretty baby you're all I need  
Oh darling, think it's gonna work out fine  
Think it's gonna work out fine  
Know it's gonna work out fine  
Think it's gonna work out fine  
Think, think, work out fine  
Think, think, work out fine  
You've got to think, think, work out fine  
I think it's gonna work out  
Yeah it's gonna work out  
Know it's gonna work out fine
