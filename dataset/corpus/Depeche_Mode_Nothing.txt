Sitting target  
Sitting waiting  
Anticipating  
Nothing  
Nothing  
Life  
Is full of surprises  
It advertises  
Nothing  
Nothing  
What am I trying to do  
What am I trying to say  
I'm not trying to tell you anything  
You didn't know  
When you woke up today  
Sitting target  
Sitting praying  
God is saying  
Nothing  
Nothing  
Always  
Knows the prospects  
Learnt to expect  
Nothing  
Nothing
