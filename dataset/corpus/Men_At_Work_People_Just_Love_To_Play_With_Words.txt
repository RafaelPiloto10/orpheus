I'm not tryin' to impress you with my lines  
They don't mean nothin' at all  
It's just another expression of mine  
It don't mean nothin' at all  
Mystifying, Oh no  
Crystalizing, you know  
  
People just love to play with words  
People just love to play, haven't you heard?  
People just love to play with words  
People just love to play, haven't you heard?  
  
There are two sides, a win or loss  
What's two down and four across?  
Analyzing and implying, you know  
  
People just love to play with words  
People just love to play, haven't you heard?  
People just love to play with words  
People just love to play, haven't you heard?...
