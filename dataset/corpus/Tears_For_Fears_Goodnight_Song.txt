Here on the stage  
The time has come  
With the strains of "Be my angels!?, of rock in two four  
Time may keep alive that old swang song  
That we've been playing forever  
Till the time maybe right to say goodbye  
My voice is aching, I'm tongue tired  
And the sounds we are making are so uninspired  
Goodnight song, played so wrong  
Blame the crowd, they scream so loud, so long  
Get some honesty  
Take the best of me and then the rest let go  
In every situation with it's tireless rage  
Step outside your cage and let the real fool show  
I should have stayed round to break the ice  
I thought about it once or twice  
But nothing ever changes unless there's some pain  
And our...  
Goodnight song, played so wrong  
Blame the crowd, they scream so loud, so long  
Goodnight song, played so wrong  
Blame the crowd, they scream so loud, so long
