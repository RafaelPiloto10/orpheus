A very old friend came by today  
Cause he was telling everyone in town  
Of the love that he just found  
And Marie's the name of his latest flame  
  
He talked and talked and I heard him say  
That she had the longest blackest hair  
The prettiest green eyes anywhere  
And Marie's the name of his latest flame  
  
Though I smiled the tears inside were burning  
I wished him luck and then he said goodbye  
He was gone but still his words kept returning  
What else was there for me to do but cry  
  
Would you believe that yesterday  
This girl was in my arms and swore to me  
She'd be mine eternally  
And Marie's the name of his latest flame  
  
Though I smiled the tears inside were burning

This girl was in my arms and swore to me  
She'd be mine eternally  
And Marie's the name of his latest flame  
And Marie's the name of his latest flame  
And Marie's the name of his latest flame  
And Marie's the name of his latest flame
