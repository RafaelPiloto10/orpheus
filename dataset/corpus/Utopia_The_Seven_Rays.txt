My great grandfather was a satisfied man  
Contented in every way  
Such was the course of his everyday life  
'Til he heard of the seven rays (Repeat 3X)  
  
Every modern man, in the back of his mind  
Has a problem to face  
He wants security for the home in his head  
All he needs is the seven rays (Repeat 2X)  
  
And when you think about tomorrow  
What goes through your mind?  
Now don't nobody get uptight  
Do you think that we can put up  
With this shit one more night  
All you need is just six more rays (Repeat 2X)  
  
Take one beam of light  
Prism acquire  
Break the white light down  
Seven rays appear (Repeat)  
  
One, Red, the ruler seeking freedom  
Two, Gold, the father seeking unity  
Three, Orange, the thinker seeking understanding  
Four, Yellow, the poet seeking harmony  
  
Take the seven rays  
Pure as fire  
Focus anywhere  
White light will appear (Repeat 2X)  
  
Five, Green, the scientist seeking truth  
Six, Blue, the disciple seeking goodness  
Seven, Indigo, the artist seeking beauty  
  
This may sound like a bunch of trumped up words  
But we keep no secrets today  
The only hope for you is in your brothers, my friend  
All you need is just six more rays  
All we need is the seven rays (Repeat 3X)
