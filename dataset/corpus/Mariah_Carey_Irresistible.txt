Everytime I Try To Leave  
Something Pulls Me Back Baby  
Tried And Tried To Let You Go  
But It's Just Impossible  
Everytime We Say Goodbye  
Bitter Tear Drops Fill My Eyes  
Wish I Didn't Need You So  
But You're Irresistible  
  
Verse 1  
I Don't Wanna Lose You To Somebody Else  
But I Can't Go On Contradicting Myself  
I Know That It's Pointless To Keep Hodling On  
But Something Inside Tells Me You're Where I Belong  
  
Chorus  
Everytime I Try To Leave  
Something Pulls Me Back Baby  
Tried And Tried To Let You Go  
But It's Just Impossible  
Everytime We Say Goodbye  
Bitter Tear Drops Fill My Eyes  
Wish I Didn't Need You So  
But You're Irresistible  
  
Verse 2  
I Know That It's Unrealistic To Think  
That Things Will Get Better  
Between You And Me  
Cause Time After Time  
You Just Shatter My Heart  
But When I'm Without You  
I Feel So Torn Apart  
  
Chorus  
Everytime I Try To Leave  
Something Pulls Me Back Baby  
Tried And Tried To Let You Go  
But It's Just Impossible  
Everytime We Say Goodbye  
Bitter Tear Drops Fill My Eyes  
Wish I Didn't Need You So  
But You're Irresistible  
  
Boy  
I Wish  
That I Didn't  
Love You So  
(Oh Oo Oh Oo Oh Oh)  
I Try To Tell You No  
But You're Irresistible  
(Oh Oo Oh Oo Whoah Oh)  
  
See I Only Want It To Be Like It Was  
When We Got Together And First Fell In Love  
Sometimes It's Like I'm Addicted To You  
This Love's So Consuming  
I Don't Know What To Do  
  
Everytime I Try To Leave  
Something Pulls Me Back Baby  
Tried And Tried To Let You Go  
But It's Just Impossible  
Everytime We Say Goodbye  
Bitter Tear Drops Fill My Eyes  
Wish I Didn't Need You So  
  
But You're Irresistible  
  
Everytime I Try To Leave  
Something Pulls Me Back Baby  
Tried And Tried To Let You Go  
But It's Just Impossible  
Everytime We Say Goodbye  
Bitter Tear Drops Fill My Eyes  
Wish I Didn't Need You So  
But You're Irresistible  
  
Everytime I Try To Leave  
Something Pulls Me Back Baby  
Tried And Tried To Let You Go  
But It's Just Impossible  
Everytime We Say Goodbye  
Bitter Tear Drops Fill My Eyes  
Wish I Didn't Need You So  
But You're Irresistible
