Make you into dark  
Straight into your heart  
Sorry all you are  
I don't really care  
Well, I know you are...  
  
Robots, robots  
Brainwashed babies, blood from a leech  
Spoken rabies  
Spastic, plastic, battery acid  
Yank on the leash  
Draggin' you backwards  
Oh, my closed eyes  
Never see it comin'  
  
There's nothing you can say  
You can't wish me away  
Every masochist gets a turn  
The sadistic twist you'll never learn  
Battery acid, battery acid  
  
Battery acid in my veins  
Unidentified remains  
"Yes" button broke to automatic  
Irrational dosage of furious static erasing what you are  
You were  
  
(Jealous)  
To feel the way you do  
(To mention)  
A lie, then call it true  
(Feel for)  
Nothing except for yourself and nobody else  
Hanging over the edge  
  
There's nothing you can say  
You can't wish me away  
Every masochist gets a turn  
The sadistic twist you'll never learn  
In battery acid, battery acid, hey
