Now there's something my daughter  
That I need to tell you  
And there's no easy way on your heart  
The truth is your mother and I have decided  
We're better off living apart  
But nothin's gonna change between you and me  
We'll only grow stronger in time  
As sure as the river will run to the sea  
You can always come runnin' to this love of mine  
  
Til the end of forever  
The last day of never  
And through all of your life in this world  
Promise me you'll always remember  
My love will follow you anywhere  
Til The end of forever I promise I'll always be there  
  
We'll look back at the pieces  
That we put together  
And the puzzle will mean so much more  
I'll be right where ya found me  
Wrapped round your finger  
Like I've been since the day you were born  
  
And who'll walk beside you  
When ya walk down the aisle  
When true love is takin' your hand  
When you're lost in the eyes, of your own child  
You'll remember this moment and you'll understand  
  
Til the end of forever  
The last day of never  
And through all of your life in this world  
Promise me you'll always remember  
My love will follow you anywhere  
Til The end of forever I promise I'll always be there  
  
Spread the wings of your dreams  
That's my only prayer  
To Love every moment from sunrise to sunset  
In your heart is my heart, I will be there  
  
Promise me you'll always remember  
My love will follow you anywhere  
Til the end of forever I promise  
Til the end of forever I promise  
As God is my witness I promise I'll always be there  
  
So promise you'll always remember I'll always be there
