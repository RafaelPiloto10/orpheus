I don't want to lose  
This good thing  
That I got  
If I do  
  
I would surely  
I'll surely lose a lot  
'Cause your love  
Is better  
Than any love I know  
  
[Chorus]  
It's like thunder  
(Thunder)  
Lightning  
(Lightning)  
The way you love me is frightening  
I better knock, on wood, baby  
  
Oh baby  
  
I ain't superstitious  
About you  
But I can't take no chance  
You got me spinningbaby (spinning baby)  
Baby, I'm in a trance  
'Cause your love  
Is better  
Than any love I know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My baby  
  
It's no secret  
That woman  
Fills my lovin' cup up  
She sees to it  
That I get enough  
Just one touch  
From her  
Really do so much  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah baby  
I'm about to knock, knock, knock on wood  
I think I'm about to knock, knock, knock on wood  
Good thing to do  
Knock, knock, knock on wood  
I think I better knock, knock, knock on wood  
'Cause I'm gonna knock, knock, knock on wood  
I think I better knock, knock, knock on wood  
'Cause I wanna knock, knock, knock on wood  
Better, knock, knock on wood  
Knock, knock, knock on wood  
Knock, knock, knock on wood  
Knock, knock, knock on wood  
Knock, knock, knock on wood  
Knock, knock, knock on wood  
Knock, knock, knock on wood  
Knock, knock, knock on wood.
