[Verse]  
So wicked in the way he moves  
Don't miss it, do not be a fool  
It's a long way, it's a long way home  
Light inside of me, it ignites my bones  
  
[Chorus:]  
He comes to me in my dreams  
And tells me what I need to know  
He makes me feel so at ease  
And guides me to a light so warm  
I just wanna fall into his arms tonight  
Someone tell me I will be alright  
I'll hold on tight  
  
[Verse]  
Remembering, I forever will  
Surrendering just to how it felt  
It's a long way, it's a long way home  
Light inside of me, it ignites my bones  
  
[Chorus:]  
He comes to me in my dreams  
And tells me what I need to know  
He makes me feel so at ease  
And guides me to a light so warm  
I just wanna fall into his arms tonight  
Someone tell me I will be alright  
I'll hold on tight  
  
[Bridge:]  
And when it's over, fond going gray  
The cinema is fading away  
I gotta make my way through the night  
Passing on with all of my might  
And then I'm lost and I can't find the way  
I feel the pieces breaking away  
Hug myself with all of my might  
Don't look down just hold on tight  
  
[Chorus:]  
He comes to me in my dreams  
And tells me what I need to know  
He makes me feel so at ease  
And guides me to a light so warm  
I just wanna fall into his arms tonight  
Someone tell me I will be alright  
I'll hold on tight
