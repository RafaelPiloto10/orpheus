Words like violence  
Break the silence  
Come crashing in  
Into my little world  
Painful to me  
Pierce right through me  
Can't you understand  
Oh my little girl  
  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever needed  
Is here in my arms  
Words are very unnecessary  
'cause they can only do harm  
  
Vows are spoken  
To be broken  
Feelings are intense  
Words are trivial  
Pleasure remain  
So does the pain  
Words are meaningless  
And forgettable  
  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever needed  
Is here in my arms  
Words are very unnecessary  
'cause they can only do harm
