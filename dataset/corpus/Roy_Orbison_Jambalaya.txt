Goodbye Joe, me gotta go, me oh, my oh  
Me gotta go pole the pirogue down the bayou  
My Yvonne, the sweetest one, me oh, my oh  
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou  
Jambalaya, a crawfish pie and a fillet gumbo  
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio  
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay, oh  
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou  
Thibodeaux, Fontaineaux, the place is buzzin'  
Kinfolk come to see Yvonne by the dozen  
Dress in style, go hog wild, me oh, my oh  
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou  
Jambalaya, a crawfish pie and fillet gumbo  
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio  
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gay, oh  
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou  
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou
