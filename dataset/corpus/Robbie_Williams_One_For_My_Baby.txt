It's quarter to three  
There's no one in the place  
Except you and me  
So set 'em up Joe  
I got a little story  
I think you should know  
We're drinking my friend  
To the end  
Of a brief episode  
Make it one for my baby  
And one more for the road  
I got the routine  
Put another nickel  
In the machine  
Feelin' so bad  
Won't you make the music  
Easy and sad  
I could tell you a lot  
But it's not  
In a gentleman's code  
Just make it one for my baby  
And one more for the road  
You'd never know it  
But buddy I'm a kind of poet  
And I've got a lot of things  
I'd like to say  
And when I'm gloomy  
Won't you listen to me  
Till it's talked away  
Well, that's how it goes  
And Joe I know your gettin'  
Anxious to close  
And thanks for the cheer  
I hope you didn't mind  
My bending your ear  
But this torch that I found  
It's gotta be drowned  
Or it's soon might explode  
Make it one for my baby  
And one more for the road  
The long, it's so long  
The long and winding road
