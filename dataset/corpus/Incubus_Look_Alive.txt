The hardest thing is rendering a  
Moment moving too fast to endure  
But you abide and smile wide cause  
I want to remember this for sure  
You can give me guns and politics and  
I'll just make a mess of it, you know  
Give me all the sustenance and  
The wiser wider part of me will show  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
A picture says with sight  
What we can't say with words  
But you've been walking eyes to feet  
In dark sunglasses  
A picture will survive  
So smile and look alive  
The camera lens is opening  
The wider angle's yours  
  
Yeah every empty one of us have methods  
To quell the madness of this pace  
But yours have bled and are running south  
Like jealous Dior mascara down your face  
You could take that wait and all that fuss so  
Now just get the best of us, you know  
Give me love not suicide and  
The wise wider part of me will show  
Yeah yeah  
  
A picture says with sight  
What we can't say with words  
But you've been walking eyes to feet  
In dark sunglasses  
A picture will survive  
So smile and look alive  
The camera lens is opening  
The wider angle's yours!  
  
Look alive, smile  
Smile and look alive  
Smile, smile and look alive  
Yeah whoa oh  
  
A picture says with sight  
What we can't say with words  
But you've been walking eyes to feet  
In dark sunglasses  
A picture will survive  
So smile and look alive  
  
A picture says with sight  
What we can't say with words

The wider angle's yours  
  
Look alive  
Smile, smile and look alive  
Yeah, smile and look alive  
Yeah whoa
