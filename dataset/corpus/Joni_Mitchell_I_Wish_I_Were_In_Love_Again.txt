The sleepless nights  
The daily fights  
The quick toboggan when you reach the heights  
I miss the kisses and I miss the bites  
I wish I were in love again  
  
The broken dates  
The endless waits  
The lovely loving and the hateful hates  
The conversations with the flying plates  
I wish I were in love again  
  
No more pain  
No no more strain  
Now I'm sane  
But I'd rather be punch drunk  
  
The flying fur of cat and cur  
The fine mismatching of a him and her  
I've learned my lesson but  
I wish I were in love again  
  
The furtive sigh  
The blackened eye  
The words I love you 'til the day I die  
The self-deception that believes that lie  
I wish I were in love again  
  
When love congeals  
It soon reveals  
The faint aroma of performing seals  
The double-crossing of a pair of heels  
I wish I were in love again  
  
No more care  
No more despair  
Now I'm all there  
But I'd rather be punch drunk  
  
Believe me sir, I much prefer  
The classic battle of a him and her  
I don't like quiet and I wish I were  
In love again  
In love again
