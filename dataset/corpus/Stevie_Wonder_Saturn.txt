Packing my bags going away  
To a place where the air is clean  
On Saturn  
There's no sense to sit and watch people die  
We don't fight our wars the way you do  
We put back all the things we use  
On Saturn  
There's no sense to keep on doing such crimes  
  
There's no principles in what you say  
No direction in the things you do  
For your world is soon to come to a close  
Through the ages all great men have taught  
Truth and happiness just can't be bought - or sold  
Tell me why are you people so cold  
  
I'm  
Going back to Saturn where the rings all glow  
Rainbow, moonbeams and orange snow  
On Saturn  
People live to be two hundred and five  
Going back to Saturn where the people smile  
Don't need cars cause we've learned to fly  
On Saturn  
Just to live to us is our natural high  
  
We have come here many times before  
To find your strategy to peace is war  
Killing helpless men, women and children  
That don't even know what they're dying for  
We can't trust you when you take a stand  
With a gun and bible in your hand  
And the cold expression on your face  
Saying give us what we want or we'll destroy  
  
I'm  
Going back to Saturn where the rings all glow  
Rainbow, moonbeams and orange snow  
On Saturn  
People live to be two hundred and five  
Going back to Saturn where the people smile  
Don't need cars cause we've learned to fly  
On Saturn  
Just to live to us is our natural high
