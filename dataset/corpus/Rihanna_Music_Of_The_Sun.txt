Listen, closely hear the music playing  
Let it take you to places far away and  
Relax your senses just do what you want to do  
No need for questions  
It's only for you  
And it's so amazing  
Oh how you can't escape it  
The moment takes you  
And never lets you go  
  
Can't you feel the music in the air  
Close your eyes let the rhythm take you there  
Doesn't matter who you are or where you're from  
Come and dance to the music of the sun  
Forget about your troubles it's alright  
Let them go 'til we see the morning light  
Feel the beat as our bodies move as one  
Come and dance to the music of the sun (the sun)  
Come and dance to the music of the sun the sun (the sun yeah)  
  
So real  
So right  
Can't explain the feeling  
Like the sunlight brings the life new meaning  
No need for stress (no need for stress)  
Save that for another day  
No second guessing  
Just trust me when I say  
And it's so amazing  
On how you can't escape it  
The moment takes you it never lets you go  
  
Can't you feel the music in the air  
Close your eyes let the rhythm take you there (let the rhythm take you there)  
Doesn't matter who you are or where you're from  
Come and dance to the music of the sun (music of the sun)  
Forget about your troubles it's alright  
Let them go 'til we see the morning light (see the morning light)  
Feel the beat as our bodies move as one  
Come and dance to the music of the sun (come and dance with the music of the
sun)  
Come and dance to the music of the sun the sun (of the sun yeah)  
  
And it's so amazing  
Oh how you can't escape it  
The moment takes you  
And never let's you go  
  
Can't you feel the music in the air  
Close your eyes let the rhythm take you there (let the rhythm take you there)  
Doesn't matter who you are or where you're from  
Come and dance to the music of the sun  
Forget about your troubles it's alright (it's alright, it's alright)  
Let them go till we see the morning light  
Feel the beat as our bodies move as one  
Come and dance to the music of the sun (come and dance with the music of the
sun)  
Come and dance to the music of the sun the sun  
Let it take you far  
Come and dance to the music of the sun  
It'll take you far away  
  
Can't you feel the music in the air  
Close your eyes let the rhythm take you there  
Doesn't matter who you are or where you're from  
Come and dance to the music of the sun.
