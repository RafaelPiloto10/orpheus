We used to think our love would be a fantasy  
But things don't always turn out loud  
There supposed to be, hearts can break  
And I won't surrender with so much at stake  
After all this time  
Did you think I let you slip away from me?  
Girl, we've come too far  
Just to turn our love into a memory  
Did you think that I can push you aside?  
All that we've been through  
Me and you, never give a try  
After all this time  
Easy to turn and walk away when love goes wrong  
Harder to stay and work it out but if the love is strong  
We must choose to hold on to something  
We don't wanna lose  
After all this time  
Did you think I let you slip away from me?  
Girl, we've come too far  
Just to turn our love into a memory  
Did you think that I can push you aside?  
All that we've been through  
Me and you, never give a try  
After all this time
