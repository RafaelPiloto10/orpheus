Well, I'm a real life cowboy  
Just a quiet, humble fella  
That's what we're like  
Apart from Mike  
Yeah, I'm more of a yeller!  
  
Sing songs to pass the evenings  
And because it soothes the herd  
So they won't stampede  
Unless Mike sings lead  
And shouts every single word!  
  
(Mike!)  
  
(Sorry!)  
  
'Cause we're cowboys  
Real-life cowboys  
Not like the ones you see on your tv  
We've never held up banks at all  
We're poorly paid  
And kinda small  
If you still wanna be a cowboy  
Stick with me!  
  
On your horse for eighteen hours  
And that saddle sore's a curse  
Then you feed your horse  
And yourself, of course  
Though beans just make it worse!  
  
Then you're back driving cattle  
That's what being a cowboy means  
Moving those beasts from west to east  
Sorry, it's the beans!  
  
'Cause we're cowboys  
Real-life cowboys  
Not like the ones you've seen in the movies  
We're not big hunks like that John Wayne  
'Cause our horses would complain  
If you still wanna be a cowboy  
Join us please!  
  
You should be aware  
We have some customs that are strange  
Like saying 'Howdy! ' not 'Hello'  
When you're out here on the range  
  
Never touch a cowboy's hat  
Never ride his horse  
So what would happen if I took your old mare?  
Well, I'd shoot you, of course!  
  
(Fair enough!)  
  
Cowboys,  
Real-life cowboys  
Not like the ones you see on silver screens  
We didn't go out starting fights  
'Cause unions fought for our rights  
Now Mike will do a solo thanks to beans!  
  
(How was that?)  
  
(It stunk!)  
  
And now my friend, I fear  
That the end is drawing near  
'Cause we only ruled the range for twenty years!
