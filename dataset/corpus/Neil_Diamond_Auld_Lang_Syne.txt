Should auld acquaintance be forgot  
And never brought to mind?  
Should auld acquaintance be forgot,  
And auld lang syne!  
  
For auld lang syne, my dear,  
For auld lang syne,  
We'll take a cup o' kindness yet  
For auld lang syne  
  
And surely ye'll be your pint stowp!  
And surely I'll be mine!  
And we'll take a cup o' kindness yet,  
For auld lang syne  
  
For auld lang syne, my dear,  
For auld lang syne,  
We'll take a cup o' kindness yet  
For auld lang syne  
  
We twa hae run about the braes,  
An pou'd the gowans fine  
But we've wander'd mony a weary fitt,  
Sin' auld lang syne  
  
For auld lang syne, my dear,  
For auld lang syne,  
We'll take a cup o' kindness yet  
For auld lang syne  
  
We twa hae paidl'd in the burn,  
Frae morning sun till dine
