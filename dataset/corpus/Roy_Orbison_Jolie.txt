Jolie...  
Jolie, Jolie my Cherie  
Pretty little french girl I met in Paris  
Jolie cute as she could be  
Throwing me her kisses from her balcony  
  
She had come hither eyes  
And charm from her head to her feet  
Really my Jolie was neat  
Golly my Jolie was sweet  
  
Jolie, Jolie my Cherie  
Wish I had my Jolie over here with me  
  
She had come hither eyes  
And charm from her head to her feet  
Really my Jolie was neat  
Golly my Jolie was sweet  
  
Jolie, Jolie my Cherie  
Wish I had my Jolie over here with me  
  
Wish I hadn't left her over in Paris  
On her balcony  
Jolie my Cherie  
Jolie, Jolie, Jolie, Jolie...
