My life is changing in so many ways  
I don't know who to trust anymore  
There's a shadow running through my days  
Like a beggar going from door to door.  
  
I was thinking that maybe I'd get a maid  
Find a place nearby for her to stay.  
Just someone to keep my house clean,  
Fix my meals and go away.  
  
A maid. A man needs a maid.  
A maid.  
  
It's hard to make that change  
When life and love turns strange.  
And old.  
  
To give a love, you gotta live a love.  
To live a love, you gotta be "part of"  
When will I see you again?  
  
A while ago somewhere I don't know when  
I was watching a movie with a friend.  
I fell in love with the actress.  
She was playing a part that I could understand.  
  
A maid. A man needs a maid.  
A maid.  
  
When will I see you again?
