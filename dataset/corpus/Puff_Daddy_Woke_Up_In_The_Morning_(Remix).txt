[Chorus: Carl Thomas]  
Woke up in the morning, you were not there  
All I seen was an imprint of your head  
In my pillow, weeping willow  
Why'd I treat you so bad  
I should of known one day that you'd be gone  
You should of known one day that I'd be gone  
You should of known one day that we'd be  
[Verse One by Carl Thomas]  
Why did you have to be this way  
Baby all you had to say  
Is that you were sick and tired of the man I began to be  
But you planned a great escape  
Bright and early before I wake  
We both knew we had to break  
You could of chose a better way  
  
[Chorus: Carl Thomas]  
Woke up in the morning, you were not there  
All I seen was an imprint of your head  
In my pillow, weeping willow  
Why'd I treat you so bad  
I should of known one day that you'd be gone  
You should of known one day that I'd be gone  
You should of known one day that we'd be  
  
[Verse Two: Carl Thomas]  
It was cold the way you left  
Still the pain is in my chest  
Because in my heart I felt you should of came and talked to me  
If you put away your pride  
And look deep into my eyes  
It would of been to your surprise  
That I got up to apologize  
But you were gone  
  
[Chorus: Carl Thomas 2x]  
Woke up in the morning, you were not there  
All I seen was an imprint of your head  
In my pillow, weeping willow  
Why'd I treat you so bad  
I should of known one day that you'd be gone  
You should of known one day that I'd be gone  
You should of known one day that we'd be  
  
[Break: Carl Thomas]  
Oh I thought we had forever, now it's gone  
It's time to carry on  
I thought that you made me happy  
But it's this thing that's come between us girl  
At one time you were my world  
Now it seems it's gone away, gone away  
  
[The Notorious B.I.G. - Rap Verse]  
(Uhh) I dreams filthy  
My moms and pops mixed in with Jamaican Rum and Whiskey  
Huh, what a set up  
Shoulda pushed em dead off, wipe the sweat off  
Uhh, cause in this world I'm dead off, squeeze lead off  
Benz sped off, ain't no shook hands in Brook-land  
Army fatigue break up teams, the enemies  
Look man, you wanna see me locked up, shot up  
Moms crotched up over the casket, screamin "Bastard!"  
Cryin, know my friends is lying  
Y'all know who killed em' filled em' with the lugars from they Rugers  
Or they Desert, dyin ain't the shit but it's pleasant  
Kinda quiet, watch my niggaz bring the riot  
Giving cats the opposite of diets  
You gain thirty pounds when you die no lie, lazy eye  
I was high when they hit me, took a few cats with me  
Shit, I need the company (uh-huh)  
Apologies in order, to T'Yanna my daughter  
If it was up to me you would be with me, sorta like  
Daddy Dearest, my vision be the clearest  
Silencers so you can't hear it  
Competition still fear it, shit, don't ask me  
I went from ashy to nasty to classy, and still  
  
[Chorus By Carl Thomas 4x..music fades out]  
Woke up in the morning, you were not there  
All I seen was an imprint of your head  
In my pillow, weeping willow  
Why'd I treat you so bad  
I should of known one day that you'd be gone  
You should of known one day that I'd be gone  
You should of known one day that we'd be
