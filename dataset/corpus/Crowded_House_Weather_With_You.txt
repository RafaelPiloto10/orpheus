Walking 'round the room singing 'Stormy Weather'  
At fifty seven Mt. Pleasant St.  
Well it's the same room but everything's different  
You can fight the sleep but not the dream  
  
Things ain't cooking in my kitchen  
Strange affliction wash over me  
Julius Caesar and the Roman Empire  
Couldn't conquer the blue sky  
  
Everywhere you go,  
Always take the weather with you  
Everywhere you go,  
Always take the weather  
Everywhere you go,  
You always take the weather with you  
Everywhere you go,  
Always take the weather, the weather with you  
  
Well there's a small boat made of china  
It's going nowhere on the mantelpiece  
Well do I lie like a lounge room lizard?  
Or do I sing like a bird released?  
  
Everywhere you go,  
Always take the weather with you  
Everywhere you go,  
Always take the weather  
Everywhere you go,  
You always take the weather with you  
Everywhere you go,  
Always take the weather, the weather with you  
  
Everywhere you go, (everywhere you go)  
Always take the weather with you  
Everywhere you go, (take the weather)  
You always take the weather  
Everywhere you go, (everywhere...)  
You always take the weather with you (... you go)  
Everywhere you go,  
You always take the weather, you take the weather, the weather with you  
  
Everywhere you go,  
Always take the weather with you  
Everywhere you go,  
You always take the weather  
Everywhere you go,  
Always take the weather with you  
Everywhere you go,  
You always take the weather, take the weather, the weather with you
