Still searching for that boy who had the faith to move a mountain.  
Want the fire back.  
  
Another question in me  
One for the powers that be  
It's got me thrown and so  
I Put on my poker face  
And try to figure it out  
This undeniable doubt  
A common occurrence  
Feeling so out of place  
  
Guarded and cynical now  
Can't help but wondering how  
My heart evolved into a  
Rock beating inside of me  
So I reel, such a stoic ordeal  
Where's that feeling that I don't feel?  
  
[Chorus]  
There was a boy who had the faith to move a mountain  
And like a child he would believe without a reason  
Without a trace he disappeared into the void and  
I've been searching for that missing person  
  
Under a lavender moon  
So many thoughts consume me  
Who dimmed that glowing light  
That once burned so bright in me  
Is this a radical phase  
A problematical age  
That keeps me running  
From all that I used to be  
  
Is there a way to return  
Is there a way to unlearn  
That carnal knowledge  
That's chipping away at my soul  
I've been gone too long  
Will I ever find my way home?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There was a boy who had the faith to move a mountain  
And like a child he would believe without a reason  
Without a trace he disappeared into the void and  
I've been searching for that missing person  
He used to want to try to walk the straight and narrow  
He had a fire and he could feel it in the marrow  
It's been a long time and I haven't seen him lately but  
I've been searching for that missing person
