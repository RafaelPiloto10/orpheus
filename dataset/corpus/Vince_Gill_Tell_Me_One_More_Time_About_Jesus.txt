Tell me one more time about Jesus  
All about forgiveness and grace  
Tell me one more time about Jesus  
All about my Savior's face  
Here comes my old friend, the preacher  
He's knockin' on my front door  
He's out tryin' to save all the sinners  
He's been here so many times before  
I love the easy conversation  
Man, that preacher sure can talk  
It brings up my need for salvation  
Even though he knows I'm stubborn to a fault  
Tell me one more time about Jesus  
All about forgiveness and grace  
Tell me one more time about Jesus  
Lord, I need just a little more faith  
I walked by the church Sunday mornin'  
I slipped on in the back door  
It's sure been a long time coming  
And tell my preacher what I need to know  
His words were like a cool drink of water  
He said, "Sinners come on down the aisle"  
So I went runnin' for the alter  
You should have seen my old friend, the preacher smile  
Tell me one more time about Jesus  
All about forgiveness and grace  
Tell me one more time about Jesus  
I long to see my Savior's face  
Oh, I long to see my Savior's face
