We watch each other  
Even when we sleep  
For some small protection  
It's a promise we keep  
  
Love is hard to define  
It runs in circles  
Round the mind  
But a circle  
Ain't a circle  
If it's not complete  
  
Oh love me from the heart down  
If it hurts or if it's bliss  
Love me from the heart down  
Reveal me with a kiss  
My senses must compete  
With a brain that let's me down  
Down...down  
  
We satisfy each other  
But the hunger still remains  
You sink into my flesh like a knife  
When day comes to an end  
We take off all our clothes  
And stand naked face to face  
With real life  
  
Oh love me from the heart down  
Get me on the floor  
Love me from the heart down  
Go under  
And then come back for more  
Analytical patter  
Gives love the run around, around  
You can't hold a theory  
Won't you love me  
From the heart down  
  
We misconstrue intentions  
When there's distance in-between  
Longing hurts the teeth  
Like something sweet  
When you're not here with me  
You become a memory  
This aching feels  
Like some kind of defeat  
  
Oh love me from the heart down  
Get me on the phone  
Love me from the heart down  
Lie and say you're coming home  
True confessions need  
The make-up of a clown  
Smiles are deceiving  
Won't you love me  
Love me from the heart down
