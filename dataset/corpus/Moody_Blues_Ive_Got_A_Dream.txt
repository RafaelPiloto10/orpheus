I've got a dream  
And, every night, I said to myself  
Yeah, I said I gotta share it  
Share the dream with somebody else  
We could make a beautiful day  
Oh baby, it's a beautiful dream  
But what am I going to do with it, baby?  
Say, what am I going to do with it, baby?  
What am I going to do with it, baby  
Well if I can't share it with you?  
I got some love  
And, baby, it's the kind that will do  
Yeah, I got a kiss  
And give it to someone like you  
The moon is shining up above  
And I got a heart full of love  
But what am I going to do with it, baby?  
Say, what am I going to do with it, baby?  
What am I going to do with it, baby  
But if I can't give it to you?  
I can't throw it in the river  
And I can't toss it in the sea  
And I can't put it in a paper bag  
So, baby, come and get it from me  
I've got a dream  
And, every night, I said to myself  
Yeah, I said I gotta share it  
Share the dream with somebody else  
We could make a beautiful day  
Oh baby, it's a beautiful dream  
But what am I going to do with it, baby?  
Say, what am I going to do with it, baby?  
What am I going to do with it, baby  
But if I can't share it...  
But if I can't share it...  
Well if I can't share it with you?
