Put the houses in a row  
On the streets we used to know  
And all the things out in the yard  
That can hang there to and fro  
  
And if the money isn't right  
Can I be yours tonight?  
I've an easy heart  
  
From the windows of your house  
Reflects back on yourself  
Then it gets you wondering'  
If it means anything  
  
And if the money isn't right  
Can I be yours tonight?  
I've had a pretty hard life  
I've had a pretty hard life  
For such an easy heart  
  
You move away when you're young  
They take away where you're from  
And all the things out in the trees  
Fall away in to the breeze  
  
And if the money isn't right  
Can I be yours tonight?  
I've had a pretty hard life  
I've had a pretty hard life  
For such an easy heart
