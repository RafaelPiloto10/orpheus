He broke your heart  
He took your soul  
You're hurt inside  
Because there's a hole  
You need some time  
To be alone  
Then you will find  
What you always know  
  
I'm the one who really loves you baby  
I've been knocking at your door  
  
[Chorus]  
As long as I'm living, I'll be waiting  
As long as I'm breathing, I'll be there  
Whenever you call me, I'll be waiting  
Whenever you need me, I'll be there  
  
I've seen you cry  
Into the night  
I feel your pain  
Can I make it right  
I realized there's no end inside  
  
Yet still I'll wait  
For you to see the light  
  
I'm the one who really loves you baby  
I can't take it anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You are my only I've ever known  
That makes me feel this way  
Couldn't on my own  
I want to be with you until we're old  
  
You have the love you need right in front of you  
Please come home  
  
[Chorus]
