I've been searchin' for a long time  
For someone exactly like you  
I've been travelin' all around the world  
Waitin' for you to come through  
Someone like you  
To make it all worthwhile  
Someone like you  
To keep me satisfied  
Someone exactly like you  
Just like you  
I've been traveling a hard road  
Baby looking for someone exactly like you  
I've been carrying this heavy load  
Waiting for your light to some shining through  
Someone like you  
Could make it all worthwhile  
Someone like you baby  
To keep me satisfied  
Someone exactly like you  
Just like you  
Yeah baby  
Just like you  
And I've been doing some real soul-searching  
Tryin' to find out where you're at  
And I've been up and down this highway  
To all kinds of foreign lands  
Someone like you  
To make it all worthwhile  
And someone like you  
To keep me so satisfied  
Someone exactly like you  
Just like you  
Someone like you  
Could make it all worthwhile  
Someone like you  
Could keep me so satisfied  
Someone exactly like you  
Yes someone exactly like you  
Just like you  
I've been searching  
For such a long time  
Marching to the beat  
Of a different drum  
And now I realize  
The best is yet to come  
Someone just like you  
Someone just like you
