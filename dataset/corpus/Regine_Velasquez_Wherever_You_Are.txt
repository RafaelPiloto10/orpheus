I love to see the ocean's beauty  
And the moon that shines above  
Alone in the sand lookin at the stars  
Wishing someday I would find true love  
Wouldn't be nice to see the morning  
With the one you love the most  
Wouldn't be nice to say goodnight  
To the one you hold so close  
To your heart, to your heart,  
The wind that blows the dove  
Is the wind that blows my love  
Hoping to find its way to you  
Wherever you are  
I love to sit in fields of green  
Looking deeply thru the sky  
Watching birds as they flap by  
Hoping someday faith will bring me true love  
Wouldn't be nice to hold someone  
So dear, n near your heart  
Wouldn't be nice to hear those words  
I love you, from the one  
That you love, that you love  
  
The wind that blows the dove  
Is the wind that blows my love  
Hoping to find its way to you  
Wherever you are  
The wind that blows the dove  
Is the wind that blows my love  
Hoping to find its way to you  
Wherever you are  
I love to see myself one day  
In the arms of someone  
Who will share her life with me  
Selflessly, someday you will find your way,  
To me. ..  
The wind that blows the dove  
Is the wind that blows my love  
Hoping to find its way to you  
Wherever you are  
The wind that blows the dove  
Is the wind that blows my love  
Hoping to find its way to you  
Wherever you are, Wherever you are
