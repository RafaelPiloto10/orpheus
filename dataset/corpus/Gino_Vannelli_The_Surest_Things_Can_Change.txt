I love you now  
And I never want to change my mind  
But love is strange  
And the surest things can change  
We carry love  
More than we can stand to lose  
But who can say  
The things we feel this day  
Are the things we feel in time  
  
Oh how can I be sure  
The sun will rise in days to come  
And now that I am yours  
The world is still for you and i  
  
We carry dreams  
Like children in the spring of life  
But love is pain  
And the purest things can change  
Who can say  
The things we feel this day  
Are the things we feel in time  
  
Oh how can I be sure  
The sun will rise in days to come  
And now that I am yours  
The world is still in cloudless sky  
But sad as rain  
The surest things can change
