Come on honey let's play the match game  
You strike me and I'll be the flame  
Girl you start the biggest fire  
When you touch me I'm like a likewire  
You burn a tattoo on my arms  
I can't feel the fire  
But your kisses is warm  
  
And it's the match game  
Now, now I'll tell you it's the match game  
Huh, come on  
  
Honey the match game is really in  
Strike me the light a cigarette  
Your love keeps me burning up  
Give me so much I can't get enough  
My burns can burn down a building  
But my kind of fire  
Gives you that lovely good feeling  
  
It's the match game  
Baby, I'll tell you it's my match game  
  
Hard is my momma's turn to free  
Oh, your just ties me up in the sea  
Don't you know I like it momma  
Really do, love it, huh, come on  
  
Come on honey let's play the match game  
You strike me and I'll be the flame  
Girl you start the biggest fire  
When you touch me I'm like a live wire  
You burn a tattoo on my arms  
I don't feel the fire  
But your kisses is warm

Light me up, come on and light me up
