Come gather round me boys and lend an ear  
I've got some things I think you all should hear  
It's time to shift into another gear  
I've reached my final destination bought a radio station  
And she's fifty thousand watts pure and clear  
K-S-O-S help is on the way twenty-four hours of every day  
A voice in the wilderness and we're here to stay K-S-O-S  
[ guitar - banjo ]  
K-S-O-S help is on the way...  
K-S-O-S help is on the way...
