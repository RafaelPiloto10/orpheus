I'm all dressed up in my finest attitude,  
Pretending I don't care,  
Guess I really messed up trying to be two,  
When only one heart can be there,  
Why can't I be just what I am,  
And speak my love withut any shame,  
Why can't she see what I am,  
Is a costumed fool trapped in a tragic game.  
  
Charades and pretty lies,  
They hide what's deep inside me,  
Charades do disguise,  
All the love I keep inside me,  
Charades can't see me,  
But can you feel the real me,  
The real me behind my Charades.  
  
Oh, Please don't mind me,  
Performing at my hardest,  
As I paint upon the air,  
You won't find me,  
Cause it's a portrait of the artist,  
As a man who isn't there.  
  
Charades and pretty lies,  
They hide what's deep inside me,  
Charades do disguise,  
All the love I keep inside me,  
Charades can't see me,  
But can you feel the real me,  
The real me behind my charades.  
  
Can't you feel the real me,  
Behind my charades,  
Have I lost the real me,  
Behind my charades.
