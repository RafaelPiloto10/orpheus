I been up and down before  
Grief won't hold me any more  
You're running out of games to play  
I don't have to live this way  
  
Thought I loved you for awhile  
You were loaded up on style  
Talk is cheap but I won't play  
I don't have to live this way  
  
No I won't play the games that you've designed  
And I won't wait to listen to your lines  
Before you speak another word  
I'll repeat it so I'm heard  
You're running out of games to play  
I don't have to live this way  
  
You won't stay another night  
Or did you want another right  
Now I've got the eyes to see  
You get your kicks by hurting me  
  
No I won't play the games that you've designed  
And I won't wait to listen to your lines  
Before you speak another word  
I'll repeat it so I'm heard  
You're running out of games to play  
I don't have to live this way
