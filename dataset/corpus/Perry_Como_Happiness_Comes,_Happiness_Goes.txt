Happiness comes, happiness goes  
Where it goes, no one knows!  
What's in store, who can guess?  
It could be . . . happiness!  
If you're in love, an' she loves you too  
Oh never break her heart, whatever you may do  
Don't say goodbye ( Don't say goodbye! )  
To a love that's true ( to a love that's true! )  
Because if you should lose your one an' only  
All your life you may be lonely!  
Happiness comes ( Happiness comes! )  
Happiness goes ( happiness goes! )  
Where it goes ( where it goes! )  
No one knows! ( no one knows! )  
What's in store ( What's in store? )  
Who can guess? ( who can guess? )  
It could be . . . happiness!  
  
Happiness comes, happiness goes  
Where it goes, no one knows!  
What's in store ( What's in store? )  
Who can guess? ( who can guess? )  
It could be . . . happiness!  
It could be . . . happiness!  
It could be . . . happiness!
