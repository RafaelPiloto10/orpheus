Don't you know I love you more than life itself,  
Don't you know that you're my pride  
And I would not have you walking through this world.  
Without me by your side  
  
Go to sleep my little man  
Don't you weep my little man  
  
I'd like to keep you with me all your life,  
But I know I can't do that  
So I must try to teach you wrong from right,  
To keep the vulture from your back  
  
Go to sleep my little man  
Don't you weep my little man  
  
And when you're dreaming you can talk to angels,  
So wipe the tears from your eyes  
And if there's demons that try to steal you breath away.  
You can't believe that, know my spirit will be standing by your side  
  
You saved me, you gave me, the greatest gift of all  
Believe me, believe, there ain't no mountain that's too tall  
  
I will gladly carry your cross for you,  
To take your pain away  
But what I can't carry is my love for you,  
Beyond my dying day  
  
So be strong my little man  
When I'm gone my little man  
You got to be my little man  
So don't you weep my little man  
Go to sleep my little man  
Don't you weep my little man  
You got to be my little man  
So don't you weep my little man
