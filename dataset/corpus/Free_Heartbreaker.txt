Well my maker  
Must've been a hard heartbreaker  
I said my maker  
Must've been a hard heartbreaker  
I'll tell you why  
  
I'm breaking my own heart  
Tryin' to love a faker  
  
Like a blind man  
My little house is on fire  
Just like a blind man  
My little house is on fire  
  
I'm burning my own eyes out  
Tryin' to reach the door  
  
Well the sun is shining  
But it sure don't seem to reach my heart  
Well the sun is shining  
But it sure don't seem to reach my heart  
  
I'm wasting my whole life  
Tryin' to make a new start  
  
Make a new start  
Make a new start  
Make a new start  
Make a new start.
