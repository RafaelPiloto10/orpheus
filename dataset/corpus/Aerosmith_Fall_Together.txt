Looking through the looking glass  
Looking back at me  
I got X-Ray rear view vision  
But I don't like what I see  
  
Now, I'd should not bitch and moan  
But there's not much I can do  
When you're hangin' by a thread  
And I'm hangin' on to you  
  
Baby we can fall apart  
Or we can fall together  
It's a long, way down  
We can make a new start  
Never say never  
We can fall apart  
Or we can fall together  
  
Now I know you feel compelled  
When you're so down in the dumps  
Every road can take some turns  
And every road has got it's bumps  
  
Now you got to know yourself  
Yeah, you got to play it smart  
'Cause you'll suffer for your sanity  
If you suffer for your art  
  
Baby we can fall apart  
Or we can fall together  
It's a long way down  
We can make a new start  
Never say never  
We can fall apart  
Or we can fall together  
  
Now honey I got this feelin' something's funny  
But I don't know what it is  
My knees are shakin'  
And the ground's about to give  
  
Or we can fall together  
It's a long way down  
We can make a new start  
Never say never  
We can fall apart  
Or we can fall together  
  
Baby we can fall apart  
Or we can fall together  
It's a long way down  
We can make a new start  
Never say never  
We can fall apart  
Or we can fall together  
  
Fall together  
Fall together  
Fall together, right now  
You and me
