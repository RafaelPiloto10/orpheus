Tonight I feel like a prisoner  
On fire, waiting desperately  
Denied, sentenced forever more  
Only your love can set me free  
  
I search my heart in vain  
To understand what I'm supposed to do  
Ain't never felt this way  
But there was never anyone like you  
  
[Chorus]  
Lover, you've gotta save me  
Oh, woman, don't you drive me crazy  
Lover, you've gotta save me  
Believe me, you're the one  
Won't you come and save me?  
  
Inside, so deep in the heart of me  
You've got this power I just can't explain  
In this life, this world of insanity  
I'm at your mercy when you call my name  
  
Something in your touch defies all reason  
With you passion rules  
I never felt this much  
But there was never anyone like you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Take me through this fire, this raging wall of flames  
Only you can break me from these chains  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Save me
