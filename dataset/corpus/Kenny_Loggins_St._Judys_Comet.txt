Little sleepy boy  
Do you know what time it is?  
Well the hour of your bedtime's  
Long been past  
  
And though I know you're fighting it  
I can tell when you rub your eyes  
You're fading fast  
Fading fast  
  
Won't you run come see St. Judy's Comet  
Roll across the skies  
And leave a spray of diamonds  
In its wake  
I long to see St. Judy's Comet  
Sparkle in your eyes  
When you awake  
  
Little boy  
Won't you lay your body down  
Little boy  
Won't you close your weary eyes  
Ain't nothing flashing but the fireflies  
  
Well I sang it once  
Then I sang it twice  
I'm going to sing it three times more  
I'm going to stay 'til your resistance  
Is overcome  
'Cause if I can't sing my boy to sleep  
Well it makes your famous daddy  
Look so dumb  
  
Won't you run come see St. Judy's Comet  
Roll across the skies  
And leave a spray of diamonds  
In its wake  
I long to see St. Judy's Comet  
Sparkle in your eyes  
When you awake  
  
Little boy, little boy  
Won't you lay your body down  
Little boy, little boy  
Won't you close your weary eyes  
Ain't nothing flashing but the fireflies  
  
Oo little sleepy boy  
Do you know what time it is  
Well the hour of your bedtime's  
Long been past  
Though I know you're fighting it  
I can tell when you rub your eyes  
That you're fading fast.
