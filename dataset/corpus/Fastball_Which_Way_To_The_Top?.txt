Where did you leave your baby  
bleeding in her bed?  
Her ghost has come to stay  
Oh, you can try, you can't chase her away  
In the bar we sit like blackbirds  
with our broken wings  
Like clocks without springs  
Just like time doesn't mean anything  
Won't you tell me  
which way to the top?  
Ah, so you know that I can't stay down here  
Um, ah hey  
Um, ah hey  
We used to ride around  
in a broken down old car  
but now I'm changing trains  
Oh, and I'll hit all the notes in between  
Mom and Dad are fast asleep now  
but I'll be wide awake  
The surfer in the break  
Oh, just waiting for the perfect wave  
And a place in the shade  
Won't you tell me  
which way to the top?  
Ah, so you know that I can't stay down here  
You better get it now  
while the getting's good  
ah, now, get it now  
while it's happening  
Oh!  
Get it nowwhile the getting's good  
Get it now, while it's happening  
Oh yeah  
Won't you tell me  
which way to the top?  
Ah, so you know that I can't stay down here  
Won't you tell me  
which way to the top?  
Ah, so you know that I can't stay down here
