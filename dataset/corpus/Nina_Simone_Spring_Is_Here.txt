Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart  
  
Sprinh is here  
Why doesn't my heart go dancing  
Spring is here  
Why isn't the waltz entrancing  
No desire no ambition leads me  
Maybe it's becaus nobody needs me  
  
Spring is here  
Why doesn't the breeze delight me  
Stars appear  
Why doesn't the night invite me  
But maybe it's because nobody loves me  
Spring is here I hear  
Somebody told me spring is here
