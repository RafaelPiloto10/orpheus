Shadows of night falling over my head  
People walking  
Passing me by  
Shadows of dreams falling out of the blue  
People talking  
What can I do  
Where do I go from here  
Where do I go from here  
I could give you any dream and watch it grow  
I could take you for a ride but you would know  
I could tell you every answer that I know  
It wouldn't be much tho'  
It wouldn't be anything you didn't know  
  
But  
Survival  
Nothing more than survival  
  
Shadows of days hanging endless in time  
Slowly fading  
Passing us by  
Shadows of worlds disappearing from view  
People asking  
What could we do?  
Where do I go from here  
Where do I go from here  
  
If I gave you every dream they would grow  
If I took you for a ride would you know  
If I told you every answer that I know  
It wouldn't be much tho'  
It wouldn't be anything you didn't know  
  
But survival  
In you love, I have all that  
I need for  
survival  
With your love I have all that  
I need for  
Survival  
With our love we have all that  
We need for  
Survival
