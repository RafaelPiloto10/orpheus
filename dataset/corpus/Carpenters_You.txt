You are the one who makes me happy  
When everything else turns to grey  
Yours is the voice that wakes me mornings  
And sends me out into the day  
You are the crowd that sits quiet  
Listening to me  
And all the mad sense that i make  
  
You are one of the few things worth remembering  
And since it's all true  
How could anyone mean more to me than you  
  
Sorry if sometimes i look past you  
There's no one beyond your eyes  
Inside my head wheels are turning  
Hey, sometimes I'm not so wise  
You are my heart and my soul my inspiration  
Just like the old love song goes  
  
You are one of the few things worth remembering  
And since it's all true  
How could anyone mean more to me than you
