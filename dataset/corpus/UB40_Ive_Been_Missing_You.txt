It's not because I've just been caught  
It's not as if I planned this  
I didn't give a single thought  
One big misunderstanding  
I see how things look from your side  
I see how you're hurting  
The reason that I didn't hide  
One big misunderstanding  
So I blew it again just like I always do  
It's too late for sorry, this much is true  
I did what I did  
Just to make my way through  
One more day far away from you  
And I've been missing you  
  
It's not the first won't be the last time  
I've been caught red-handed  
To tell the truth I cannot lie  
One big misunderstanding  
I haven't got an alibi  
And I can't stop them talking  
Cross my heart and hope to die  
One big misunderstanding  
  
So I blew it again just like I always do  
For the things that I did I'm saying sorry to you  
But I did what I did and I paid my dues  
I've been missing you  
  
It's not the first won't be the last time  
I've been caught red-handed  
To tell the truth I cannot lie  
One big misunderstanding  
I haven't got an alibi  
And I can't stop them talking  
I cross my heart and hope to die  
One big misunderstanding  
  
So I blew it again just like I always do  
For the things that I did I'm saying sorry to you  
But I did what I did and I paid my dues  
I've been missing you
