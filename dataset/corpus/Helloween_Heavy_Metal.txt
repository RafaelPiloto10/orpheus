Fight hard  
Live fast  
Play loud  
Step out of the crowd  
  
Iron  
Rulin'  
Steel bent  
Forever the faith will live on in our hearts  
  
There's nothing else in all the world  
That will bring it down  
We will play our wildest step to all around  
We need it as a liquid in our veins instead of blood  
  
Power  
Burnin'  
Brains out  
United metallians ready to strike  
  
White heat  
Red hot  
Mayhem  
If you don't feel it you won't understand  
  
There's nothing else in all the world  
That will bring it down  
We will play our wildest step to all around  
We need it as a liquid in our veins instead of blood  
  
Chorusheavy metal is the law that keeps us all united free  
A law that shatters earth and hell  
Heavy metal can't be beaten by any dynasty  
We're all wizards fightin' with our spell  
  
Chorus
