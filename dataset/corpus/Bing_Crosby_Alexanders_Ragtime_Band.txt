Come on and hear, come on and hear Alexander's Ragtime Band  
Come on and hear, come on and hear 'bout the best band in the land  
They can play a bugle call like you never heard before  
So natural that you want to go to war  
  
That's just the bestest band what am, oh Honey Lamb  
Come on along, come on along, let me take you by the hand  
Up to the man, up to the man who's the leader of the band  
And if you care to hear the Swanee River played in ragtime  
Come on and hear, come on and hear Alexander's Ragtime Band
