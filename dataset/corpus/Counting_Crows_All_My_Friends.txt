Thought I might get a rocket ride  
When I was a child but it was a lie  
That I told myself when I needed something good  
At seventeen, had a better dream.  
Now I'm thirty-three and it isn't me  
But I'd think of something better if I could  
  
All my friends and lovers leave me behind  
I'm still looking for a girl  
One way or another  
I'm just hoping to find a way  
To put my feet out in the world  
  
Caught some grief from a falling leaf  
As she tumbled down to the dirty ground  
Said I should have put her back there if I could  
But everyone needs a better day  
And I'm trying to find me a better way  
To get from the things I do to the things I should  
  
All my friends and lovers leave me alone  
To try to have a little fun  
One way or another I just wish I had known  
To go out walking in the sun  
And find out if you were the one  
  
Does it make you wanna come a little closer now?  
And did you wanna dance with me?  
Did you wanna hum a little harder now?  
Can you see her waiting there?  
Can you see her? Because I'm almost there  
Can you see her waiting there for someone like me?  
All you want is a beauty queen  
Not a superstar but everybody's dream machine  
All you want is a place to lay your head  
You go to sleep dreaming how you would  
Be a different kind if you thought you could  
But you come awake the way you are instead  
  
All my friends and lovers shine like the sun  
I just turn and walk away  
One way or another  
I'm not coming undone  
I'm just waiting for the day
