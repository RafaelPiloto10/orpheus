[I wanted her all over me, so I cut her up and I smeared her]  
Smack dab flat on my back  
The solid ground began to crack  
I pulled her down and down and down  
I lost my breath  
I thought I'd drown  
Fistfuls of you  
Fistfuls of you  
You pulled me through with white knuckles  
Fistfuls of you  
Fistfuls of you  
You pulled me through with white knuckles  
Her leg, my hand, a smoldering brand  
Sticking to her wet body like sand  
Her place, distaste, we fell from grace  
Red smears across her face  
Fistfuls of you  
Fistfuls of you  
You pulled me through with white knuckles  
Fistfuls of you  
Fistfuls of you  
You pulled me through with white knuckles  
White knuckles!  
White knuckles!  
White knuckles!  
White knuckles!
