Ashes to ashes  
That's how it ends  
(You go from) heartache to heartache  
As you make amends  
(Just) bigger and bigger  
But two steps back  
You want something from nothing  
And you're so exact  
  
You think you're a rich man  
Now you misbehave  
You're not a free man running  
Just a comfortable slave  
  
So selfish  
You got more than you can use  
But you still don't see  
You're so selfish  
And you're running out of room  
  
Deeper and deeper  
As you forge ahead  
Higher and higher  
But you've been mislead  
Harder and harder  
You grind the stone  
Faster faster faster  
Till you're skin and bones  
  
Too much ambition  
Without relief  
That ain't heaven  
But it's what you teach  
  
So selfish  
You got more than you can use  
But you still don't see  
You're so selfish  
And you're running out of room  
  
The world was made in seven days  
Your heads are bowed to Gods in praise  
Civilized man can only be saved  
When courage and wisdom are finally raised  
  
Who's got the answer  
Give me the cure  
Don't rush to judgment  
Until you're sure  
  
So selfish  
You got more than you can use  
But you still don't see  
You're so selfish  
And you're running out of room
