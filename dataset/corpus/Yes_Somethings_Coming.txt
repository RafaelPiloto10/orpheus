Could be  
Who knows?  
There something due any day  
I will know right away  
Soon as it shows  
  
It may come cannon-ballin' down from the sky  
Gleam in its eye  
Bright as a rose  
Who knows?  
  
It's only just out of reach  
Down a block, on the beach  
Under a tree  
I got a feeling there's a miracle due  
Gotta come through  
Coming to me  
  
Could it be  
Yes it could  
Something's coming  
Something good  
If I can wait  
  
Something's coming  
I don't know what it is  
But it is  
Going to be great  
  
With a click  
With a shock  
Bell will jingle  
Door will knock  
Open the latch  
  
Something's coming  
I don't know what it is  
But it is  
Going to be great  
  
Around the corner  
A-whistlin' down the river  
Come on deliver  
To me  
To me  
  
Could be  
Who knows?  
There something due any day  
I will know right away  
Soon as it shows  
  
It may come cannon-ballin' down from the sky  
Gleam in its eye  
Bright as a rose  
Who knows?  
  
It's only just out of reach  
Down a block, on the beach  
Under a tree  
I got a feeling there's a miracle due  
Gotta come through  
Coming to me  
To me  
  
Tonight, Tonight  
Won't be just any night  
Tonight there will be no morning star.  
  
Tonight.
