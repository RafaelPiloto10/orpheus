Between the open heart and the whisper goodbye  
There's a perfect teardrop in your eye  
Between the lover's moon and the trembling sky  
There's a broken dream in your mind  
  
And the voice is carrying the love you have lost  
And the change of heart in someone you trust  
Yea the voice is carrying the love and the scars  
Hear the lonely voice in the dark  
  
Between the careful touch and the breakaway kiss  
There's a beauty you can't resist  
Mmm, between the fall apart and the moment of bliss  
There must be something more than this  
  
And the voice is carrying the love you have lost  
Love you have lost  
And the change of heart in someone you trust  
Yea the voice is carrying the love and the scars  
Love and the scars  
Hear the lonely voice in the dark  
In the dark  
Hear the lonely voice  
Hear the lonely voice  
  
And the voice is carrying the love you have lost  
Love you have lost  
And the change of heart in someone you trust  
Yea the voice is carrying the love and the scars  
Love and the scars  
Hear the lonely voice in the dark  
  
Oh, yea, the voice is carrying the love you have lost  
Love you have lost  
And the change of heart in someone you trust  
Yea the voice is carrying the love and the scars  
Love and the scars  
Hear the lonely voice in the dark. In the dark  
Lonely voice. Lonely voice in the dark  
Hear the lonely voice  
Hear the lonely voice in the dark...
