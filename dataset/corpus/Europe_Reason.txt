And everybody will get to play  
The hand they're given  
And everybody will deserve  
The space they live in  
And everybody will get to feel  
Some peace within  
And everybody will get  
Someone to talk with  
  
'Cause there must be a reason  
Why you're keeping me alive  
On broken days like this  
There must be a reason  
A hope that God exist  
  
And everybody will lead a life  
They feel will matter  
And everybody will know such a simple thing  
Like laughter  
  
'Cause there must be a reason  
Why you're keeping me alive  
On broken days like this  
There must be a reason  
A hope that God exist  
  
After all the fear is gone  
There's place where everybody goes  
After all the feelings show  
There's a secret everybody knows  
After all the fear is gone  
There's place where everybody goes  
After all the feelings show  
There's a secret everybody knows
