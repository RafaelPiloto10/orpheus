As simple as breathing, I picture your face  
All tangled in daydreams and shielded with grace  
I feel you beside me again  
Wherever you may be, lift up your head for me  
There's somewhere in my heart, only for you  
If I must do without, I'll let these sparks fly out  
Across the wilderness from me to you  
As certain as sunrise, your image unwinds  
You're clearer than crystal, you fill up my mind  
Now, I have you by my side  
Wherever you may be, lift up your head for me  
There's somewhere in my heart, only for you  
Though continents divide and lonely thoughts collide  
Our Heaven will allow, no distance now  
I can always close my eyes  
Take your absence by surprise  
Hold my breath and make believe  
As simple as breathing, I picture your face  
All tangled in daydreams and shielded with grace  
There's somewhere in my heart only for you  
If I must do without, I'll let these sparks fly out  
Across this wilderness from me to you  
Wherever you may be  
(Wherever you may be)  
Lift up your head for me  
(Lift up your head)  
There's somewhere in my heart only for you  
(Somewhere in my heart)  
If I must do without  
(If I must do without)  
I'll let these sparks fly out  
(Ooh, baby)  
Across this wilderness from me to you  
(Across this wilderness from me to you)  
Wherever you may be  
Lift up your head for me  
There's somewhere in my heart only for you  
(I'm missing you baby)  
If I must do without  
I'll let these sparks fly out
