"Pull over, shithead, this is the cops!"  
Full tank, pockets lined with cash  
Full throttle, gonna rip some ass.  
Drive all day and through the night,  
Romance the road, winding left to right.  
The stars above guide me, the moonlight is free.  
A feeling inside me and the whole world to see.  
Driving fast makes me feel good,  
The speed of light trapped under my hood.  
Breaking laws 'cause there's nothing to do.  
Driving the interstate, stopped for a 502.  
Hundreds of miles rolled off today.  
Signs lose their meanings, minutes tick away.  
Dirt roads to interstates, I must have drove them all.  
Cigarettes and burgers, caffeine and alcohol.  
Drive until daybreak, always on the go.  
Life on the freeway, night shift 'til dawn patrol.  
Driving fast makes me feel good,  
The speed of light trapped under my hood.  
Breaking laws 'cause there's nothing to do.  
Driving the interstate, stopped for a 502.  
Stopped for a 502, next time it's gonna be you.  
Stars above guide me  
This feeling inside me  
I drive until daybreak.  
Life on the freeway is Hell.  
I'm coming through
