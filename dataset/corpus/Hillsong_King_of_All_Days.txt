In your surrender  
As you lay down your life  
You took up a sinners cross  
And your live rescued mine  
  
In this redemption  
Love and mercy display  
Lifting my eyes to see  
That your truth never fails  
  
Lord of the heavens  
King of all days  
Without you my world slips away  
Redeemed by your mercy  
Consumed by your grace  
Now I live for you  
  
I'm found in the arms of love  
Your love it has saved my soul  
I'll run to your arms of love  
Your life's gonna lead me home  
  
Glorious savior  
In your light I am free  
If things of this world will fail  
Still you're all that I need  
  
Lord of the heavens  
King of all days  
Without you my world slips away  
Redeemed by your mercy  
Consumed by your grace  
Now I live for you  
  
I'm found in the arms of love  
Your love it has saved my soul  
I'll run to your arms of love  
Your life's gonna lead me home  
  
(And) at your cross  
I lay my burden  
At your feet  
Where your love covers  
All I've done  
Now I walk with you lord  
  
I'm found in the arms of love  
For your love it has saved my soul  
I'll run to your arms of love  
Your life's gonna lead me home
