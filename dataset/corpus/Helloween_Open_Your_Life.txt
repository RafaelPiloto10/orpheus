Do you know what there is  
Just behind your wall?  
Do you hate what you can't see  
On the spinning ball?  
  
Ignorant and wasted  
That's what you are  
But you could be so much more  
Listen to your TV  
Believe the words  
And you're dumber than more  
Try to see the real picture  
Train your mind  
To read between the lines  
Take your level higher  
That is your way  
Just get up  
Start out today  
  
Time seems an endless road  
When we are young  
It don't need a genius to know that it's wrong  
  
Hey now, hey now  
Open your life  
Hey now, hey now  
Open your life  
Rise now, rise now  
Feel the new drive  
Hey now, hey now  
Open your life  
  
Full synthetic anger  
That's what you breathe  
It's a strategy for all  
Telling people stories  
And bed time tales  
But the real important false  
So you grow the wrong seed  
Inside your head  
To the will of the modern priest  
Supervised aggression  
Instructed to sleep  
That's the devil that you breed  
  
All that we learn  
Is just one point of view  
Out there in the world  
It may not become true  
Hey now, hey now  
Open your life  
Hey now, hey now  
Open your life  
Rise now, rise now  
Feel the new drive  
Hey now, hey now  
Open your life  
  
Time seems an endless road  
When we are young  
It don't need a genius to know that it's wrong  
  
Hey now, hey now  
Open your life  
Hey now, hey now  
Open your life  
Rise now, rise now  
Feel the new drive  
Hey now, hey now  
Open your life
