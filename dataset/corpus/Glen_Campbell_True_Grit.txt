One day, little girl, the sadness will leave your face  
As soon as you've won the fight to get justice done  
Someday little girl you'll wonder what life's about  
But other's have known few battles are won alone  
So, you'll look around to find  
Someone who's kind, someone who is fearless like you  
The pain of it will ease a bit  
When you find a man with true grit  
  
One day you will rise and you won't believe your eyes  
You'll wake up and see  
A world that is fine and free  
Though summer seems far away  
You will find the sun one day
