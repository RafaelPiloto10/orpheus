Here we are, once again  
Stronger now than we have ever been  
Hand in hand, heart to heart  
Now we made it through the hardest part  
We had to break it all down to build it back up  
Lean on each other when the times got rough  
How we survive going through so much  
Baby you and I could write a book about love  
Here we are, one to one  
Looking back to see how far we come  
We shared it all, you and I  
We're still together after all this time  
We had to break it all down to build it back up  
Lean on each other when the times got rough  
How we survive going through so much  
Baby you and I could write a book about love  
Here we are, once again  
We're stronger now than we have ever been  
With hand in hand, with heart to heart  
Here we are, here we are  
Here we are  
Here we are  
Here we are
