How long can this go on, are you still actin' the same old crazy way?  
I think there's something wrong, I think somebody took your heart away,  
I believe someone took your love away, I want to bring love back to stay,  
But if somehow I don't get to you, you'll still be okay.  
How long can this lonely night be, I sing the same old sad love song,  
It's the only song I know, it's just like me,  
And I believe someone took your love away, I want to bring love back today,  
But if somehow I don't get to you, you'll still be okay.  
I believe someone took your love away, I want to bring love back to stay,  
But if somehow I don't get to you, you'll still be okay.  
How many times can I tell you the same old story, I say the same old line,  
I love you, baby, that's what I'm worryin' about.  
I believe someone took your love away, I want to bring you a heart today,  
But if somehow I don't get to you, you're still okay.  
I believe someone took your heart away, I want to bring you a heart today,  
But if somehow I don't get to you, baby, you'll be okay.  
So I'll try, try here, I'm a tryin' to find another way to say I really love  
You,  
I may not ever win, I'm gonna sing this song, tryin' to talk to you,  
I belive someone took your love away, I want to bring you a heart today,  
But if somehow I don't get to you, you're still okay
