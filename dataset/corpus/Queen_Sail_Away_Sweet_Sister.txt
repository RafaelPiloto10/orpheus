Hey little babe you're changing  
Babe are you feeling sore  
It ain't no use in pretending  
You don't want to play no more  
  
It's plain that you ain't no baby  
What would your mother say  
You're all dressed up like a lady  
How come you behave this way  
  
Sail away sweet sister  
Sail across the sea  
Maybe you'll find somebody  
To love you half as much as me  
My heart is always with you  
No matter what you do  
Sail away sweet sister  
I'll always be in love with you  
  
Forgive me for what I told you  
My heart makes a fool of me  
You know that I'll never hold you  
I know that you gotta be free  
  
Sail away sweet sister  
Sail across the sea  
Maybe you'll find somebody  
To love you half as much as me  
Take it the way you want it  
But when they let you down my friend  
Sail away sweet sister  
Back to my arms again  
  
Hot child don't you know you're young  
You got your whole life ahead of you  
And you can throw it away too soon  
Way too soon  
  
Sail away sweet sister  
Sail across the sea  
Maybe you'll find somebody's  
Gonna love you half as much as me  
My heart is always with you  
No matter what you do  
Sail away sweet sister  
I'll always be in love with you
