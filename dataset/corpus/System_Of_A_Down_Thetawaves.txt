The unsettled mind is at times an ally,  
Leaving the senses to fend for them selves,  
The senses collect undeniable data,  
About beta carotene and theta waves,  
The unsettled mind is at times an ally,  
Leaving the senses to fend for them selves,  
Then, the senses wanted the sky,  
  
All rise, I fall,  
Time feels like a midnight ride,  
Finality waits outside,  
Weeping in perplexity's arms,  
Caressing our smiles inside,  
  
The National debt is at times an ally,  
Leaving the senses to fend for them selves,  
The senses collect undeniable data,  
About high pulse weapons and microwaves,  
The National debt is at times an ally,  
Leaving the senses to fend for them selves,  
Then, the people found out the lie,  
  
All rise, I fall,  
Now I rise, and then fall,  
Time feels like a midnight ride,  
Finality waits outside,  
Weeping in perplexity's arms,  
Caressing our smiles inside,  
  
Wanting to get you high,  
Wanting to touch the sky,  
  
All rise, I fall,  
Now I rise, and then fall,  
Time feels like a midnight ride,  
Finality waits outside,  
Weeping in perplexity's arms,  
Caressing our smiles inside.
