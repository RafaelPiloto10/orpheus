These eyes, cry every night for you  
These arms, they long to hold you again  
The hurtin's on me  
And I will never be free, no  
Gave a promise to me  
Then you broke it, and you broke it  
  
These eyes, watched you bring my world to an end  
This heart, just could not accept and pretend  
The hurtin's on me  
I will never be free, no  
You took a vow with me  
And you spoke it, when you spoke it  
  
Chorus  
These eyes, are cryin'  
These eyes have seen a lot of love  
But they're never gonna see another  
One like I had with you  
(Repeat X2)  
  
These eyes, watched you bring my world to an end  
This heart, just could not accept and pretend  
  
Chorus X2  
These eyes, cry every night for you  
These eyes
