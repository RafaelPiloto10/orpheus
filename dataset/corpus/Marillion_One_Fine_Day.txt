When we were young we used to say  
Things would be different  
One fine day  
The walls would crumble  
Nations sing as one  
We live in hope  
Cause so far it hasn't come  
  
Listening to the pouring rain  
Waiting for the world to change  
Beginning to wonder if we'll wait in vain  
For one fine day  
  
Oh, how years change  
The things for which we strive  
A better world, or just a quiet life  
What seemed so simple  
Is still so far away  
Don't hold you breath waiting  
For one fine day  
  
Listenin' to the pouring rain  
Waiting for the world to change  
Beginning to wonder if we'll wait in vain  
For one fine day  
  
Life is strange  
It can seem you're high and dry  
Turn around  
You find there's nothing in this world you recognise  
Did we fall asleep babe?  
Dreaming that dream babe?  
  
Listening to the pouring rain  
Did we fall asleep babe?  
Dreaming that dream babe?  
One fine day
