There ain't no time,  
No time for sorrow.  
And we ain't got time no time  
Ah time to be sad.  
  
And maybe the world ain't what it could be  
But to understand that is to know reality  
Ah don't give in (hang on in there)  
Ah I said hang on (hang on in there)  
  
How many times did you hear your mom and daddy?  
Say oh child I never had it so good  
I wanna say thank you, thank you for the start  
Cause deep in my soul, I know you did all that you could  
I'm just a part of your dreams this I know  
But I'll do what ever possible to make this thing grow.  
Ah don't give in (hang on in there)  
I said hang on (hang on in there)  
  
Ah now say tomorrow if you woke up a king  
Now tell me just how would you fix everything?  
You walk around complaining about how things are  
But what have you added to this world so far  
Check out your mind, and see what the answer is  
And tell me how much did you give  
Ah don't give in (hang on in there)  
I said hang on, hang on in there (hang on in there)  
  
There are plenty of things still left to live for  
A child, a friend, and a wife  
They all want to share your life.  
Ain't that enough to make you want hang on  
Hang on, hang on (hang on in there)  
  
The sign said  
"America, love it or leave"  
Well has it really come to that?  
And besides,  
I don't want to and you can't make me love
