It's hard to be a snail  
Who wants to hit the trail  
But when your house is on your tail  
It's hard to see!  
  
He hides from people, too  
As snails will always do  
And only children's nursery tunes  
Can set him free.  
  
He sees a falling leaf  
A flower opened wide  
He wishes he were different!  
But all he does is hide.  
The silence all around  
Reminds him of the sea  
I'll go so far with you!  
But will you wait for me?  
  
It's hard to be a snail  
Who wants to hit the trail  
But when your house is on your tail  
It's such a bummer!  
  
Open spaces are a thrill  
And his feelers make him ill  
Is this temporary, will  
It fade with summer?  
  
He sees a falling leaf  
A flower opened wide  
He wishes he were different!  
But all he does is hide.  
The silence all around  
Reminds him of the sea  
I'll go so far with you!  
But will you wait for me?  
  
It's hard to be a snail  
Who wants to hit the trail  
But when your house is on your tail  
It's hard to see!  
  
He hides from people, too  
As snails will always do  
And only children's nursery tunes  
Can set him free.
