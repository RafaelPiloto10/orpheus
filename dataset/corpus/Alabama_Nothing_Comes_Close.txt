I've been lucky, got to travel this great land  
From the mountains of Montana to the Sarasota sands  
Oh, what a life living my dreams  
I can say these eyes have seen so many things  
The moon over Miami, sunset in Frisco bay  
It's all been so beautiful but still I have to say  
  
Nothing comes close to the beauty of your love  
Nothing comes close, your sight I can't describe  
Nothing comes close, when you're lying by my side  
Nothing comes close, oh no  
Baby, I've been there nothing comes close  
  
I could search forever and never stop  
Walk every valley and climb each mountain top  
Sell every ocean to the end of my days  
But when it was over, I'd still believe I'd say  
  
Nothing comes close to the beauty of your love  
Nothing come close, your sight I can't describe  
Nothing comes close, when you're lying by my side  
Nothing comes close  
  
Nothing comes close to the beauty of your love  
Nothing come close, your sight I can't describe  
Nothing comes close, when you're lying by my side  
Nothing comes close  
  
Oh, no, baby, I've been there and nothing comes close  
Nothing comes close
