My show  
  
Put it down, they move this town  
They follow with their eyes  
Ice cold kisses, fierce surprise  
A good, a good disguise  
Is all you need to bleed a situation  
  
You know  
  
Pull it back and put on attack  
Admission in your eyes  
Ice cold kisses compromise  
A good, a good disguise  
Is all you need to bleed a situation  
  
Let go  
  
Put it down they move this town  
They follow with their eyes  
Ice cold kisses terrorize  
A good, a good disguise  
Is all you need to bleed a situation  
  
(I could pull it with a bullet)  
Down in seven, shine a light boy  
(I could pull it with a bullet)  
What a wasted revolution  
  
(I could pull it with a bullet)  
I'm a white boy, need confusion  
(I could pull it with a bullet)  
We're all out together, together forever
