Have you ever thought that the sky was just endlessly dark?  
And then look up and see a million stars  
Have you ever been scare off the water it's stuck on the edge?  
And then you dive in, how quickly you'll forget  
  
You know fears, they capture the way, get by  
Now that I'm back in the light, so warm I feel it like a  
  
[Chorus]  
Wave of love coming over me  
Got greater drop fall and I'm on my knees  
Got the sound of you ringing in my ears  
Sun coming up on another day  
Got a second hand change gonna do it again  
Got rainbow colors and no more rain  
  
(Rain) no more  
(Rain) no more  
(Rain) no more  
(Rain) no more  
  
Have you ever dreamed you were flying until you look down?  
You never moved an inch feet firmly on the ground (feet on firmly on the
ground)  
  
Our love carries a hurt that you hold  
Funny how live can unfold, oh yeah I feel it like a  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Rain) no more  
(Rain) no more  
(Rain) no more  
(Rain) no more  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
(Rain) no more  
(Rain) no more  
(Rain) no more  
(Rain) no more
