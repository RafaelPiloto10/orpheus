I get in from work at 2a.m.  
And sit down with a beer  
Turn on the late night t.v.  
And then wonder why I'm here  
It's meaningless and trivial  
And it washes over me  
And once again I wonder  
Is this all there is for me  
  
Here I am again  
Look at me again  
Here I am again  
On my own  
Trying hard to see  
What there is for me  
Here I am again  
On my own  
  
Life seems so pathetic  
I wish I could live it all behind  
This canvas chair, this bed,  
These walls that fall in on my mind  
Hold on for something better  
That just drags you trough the dirt  
Do you just let go or carry on  
And try to take the hurt
