Oh, I see you out late at night  
You don't treat your baby right  
There's strange things happenin' everyday  
  
The love that you refuse  
Some other man can use  
Strange things are happenin' everyday  
  
Everyday, everyday  
(Everyday, everyday)  
There's strange things happenin' everyday  
  
The love that you refuse  
Some other man can use  
Strange things are happenin' everyday  
  
The way you never miss the water  
Until your well runs dry  
Strange things are happenin' everyday  
  
I won't be satisfied  
Till I see teardrops in your eyes  
Strange things are happenin' everyday  
  
Yes, everyday, everyday  
(Everyday, everyday)  
There's strange things happenin' everyday  
  
I won't be satisfied  
Till I see teardrops in your eyes  
Strange things are happenin' everyday  
  
Oh, well you thought I was a fool  
But I got blues for you  
Strange things are happenin' everyday  
  
I found this someone new  
And I'm feelin' through you  
Strange things are happenin' everyday  
  
Everyday, everyday  
(Everyday, everyday)  
There's strange things happenin' everyday  
  
Found this someone new  
And I'm feelin' through you  
Strange things are happenin' everyday  
  
Yes, strange things are happenin', happenin' everyday
