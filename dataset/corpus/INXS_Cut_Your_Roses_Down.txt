And it comes down to this  
When you take a look  
Got to find a reason  
Find it out  
What the fuck it's about  
All you lovers  
Take a look around  
Before they cut your roses down  
All they have is bones and blood  
Don't they know that  
Love is around  
  
Make your way through the pain  
You got no one to blame  
Put a rope around  
Push it into the ground  
All in the name of love  
  
Meet the devil within  
That's a name not a friend  
Comes around  
Knocking down doors  
When you let him in  
Gonna burn again
