You roly-poly  
All over town  
But you come on back to me  
When things are down  
Love like a man  
Love all you can  
  
Your satisfaction  
Is growing less  
If you come on back to me  
Use my address and let you  
Love like a man  
Love all you can  
  
You are the woman  
You can't deny  
You look so good to me, girl  
You make me high  
  
I'll tell you something  
I think you know  
When you flash those eyes at me  
All systems go and let you  
Love like a man  
Love all you can
