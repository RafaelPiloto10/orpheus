These endless days are wait for me  
Tearing my heart that breaks for you  
I'm coming home tomorrow  
  
Though you're not lying next to me  
I hear your song that calls to me  
I'm coming home tomorrow  
Back in your arms  
  
Tomorrow's just a dream I can't detain  
It's like a fall I can't contain  
And though it seems so far away  
It's just a day, a lonely day away  
  
The summer's gone and I can see  
The season's end is set me free  
I'm coming home tomorrow  
Back in your arms  
  
Tomorrow's just a dream I can't detain  
It's like a fall I can't contain  
And though it seems so far away  
It's just a day,  
A lonely day away  
  
Tomorrow I'm coming home  
Tomorrow I'm coming home  
I'm so tired and so alone  
  
It's like a dream I can't detain  
It's like a fall I can't contain  
And though it seems so far away  
It's just a day,  
A lonely day away
