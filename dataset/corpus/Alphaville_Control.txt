Pretty baby, don't you know, times they are a changin'  
Every little moment we grow up we lose control  
Life's a loaded gun with no directions  
And it keeps you on the run, it has no mercy  
Mum and daddy went to war  
Never coming back no more  
Did you ever think they'd make you whole again  
Maybe someone dropped a bomb  
Just right into the middle of your soul-they're in control  
You got to get out of control again  
No more control again  
You're getting whole again  
Ain't no control again  
You got to get out of control  
  
Twentieth century honey bee  
What you're doing is what you'll be  
Life's no dress rehearsal when you bring the honey in  
Everything seems wrong to thee  
Tortured from the poison of reality that has no mercy  
All your friends went for the thrill  
Now it's yours to grab the kill  
Did you ever think you're getting whole again  
Maybe someone send a priest  
With some religion cooking in a bowl  
They're in control  
You got to get out of control again  
What's the fucking thing about control  
Did you think you'd ever getting whole  
Just as long as there is no control  
They have no control of you at all
