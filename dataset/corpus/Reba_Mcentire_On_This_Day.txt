The kids were up before dawn this morning  
Right to the Christmas tree they ran  
Called up the stairs for us to hurry  
Wait for this day for about as long as they could stand  
  
While trading presents the little one asks me  
Why do we have Christmas each year  
I said long ago a child was born this day  
He's a gift more precious than all you see here  
  
[Chorus:]  
Cause on this day  
A child was born  
In the town of Bethlehem  
And on this day  
God sent his son to bring peace and goodwill  
To all men  
Oh on this day we call Christmas  
We honor his name  
On this day  
We recall all the reasons he came  
On this day [Repeat x1]  
  
Grandma and Grandpa arrived after breakfast  
The rest of the gang by noon  
We spent the day watching football and breaking in toys  
Helping out in the kitchen  
Catching up on old news  
  
When the dinner bell rang  
We all took our places  
Grandpa said who wants to say grace  
Before anyone else could utter a word  
Oh the little one bowed her head  
And she started to say  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause on this day  
A child was born  
In the town of Bethlehem  
And on this day  
God sent his son to bring peace and goodwill  
To all men  
Oh on this day we call Christmas  
We honor his name  
On this day  
We recall all the reasons he came  
On this day [Repeat x1]  
  
Oh on this day we call Christmas  
We honor his name  
On this day  
We recall all the reasons he came  
On this day [Repeat x1]
