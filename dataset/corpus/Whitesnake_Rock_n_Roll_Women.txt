I'm goin' looking for a woman with the night in her eyes  
Someone to take all the small talk and laugh at the lies  
A high heeled double trouble backstage queen  
Who gets what she wants and knows where she's been  
Alright show your hand  
I'm looking for the promise of a one night stand  
So I'm going looking for those rock 'n' roll women tonight  
You can see in my face just what I'm hoping to find  
I want a twelve bar beauty with a one track mind  
I don't drive babe but, I can steer  
We got the green light, let's get out of here  
Alright show your hand  
I'm looking for the promise of a one night stand  
So I'm going looking for those rock 'n' roll women tonight  
I said, I'm going looking for those rock 'n' roll women tonight  
When I saw you across the floor  
I could feel I wanted more  
I get lonely in the night  
I would do anything, anything you say  
Do anything to take the pain away  
So those lonely nights will be alright  
Don't worry, honey, we can put out the light  
I'm going looking for those rock 'n' roll women tonight  
I said, I'm going looking for those rock 'n' roll women tonight  
So I'm looking for a woman who got no shame  
'Cause in the morning there'll be no one to blame  
A high heeled double trouble, backstage queen  
Who gets what she wants and knows where she's been  
Alright show your hand  
I'm looking for the promise of a one night stand  
So I'm going looking for those rock 'n' roll women tonight  
I'm going looking for those rock 'n' roll women tonight
