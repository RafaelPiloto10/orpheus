Their eyes were upon me as they sat they're drinking  
Their hands reach up for you with lust in their hearts  
As you dance away I know just what they're thinking  
As I watch them watch you it just tears me apart  
Dance while my heart breaks Christina  
Dance to the strings of your shame and my sorrow  
I'll take you home when it's over to dream all the dreams of a brighter
tomorrow  
[ trumpet ]  
Your eyes fall out at them and the crowd all goes wild  
To them you're just a woman to go with their wine  
I look at you and all I can see is a child  
Hating the world makes you old before your time  
Dance while my heart breaks Christina...  
Dance while my heart breaks Christina...
