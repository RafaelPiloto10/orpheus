[Verse 1]  
Sometimes I hate every single stupid word you say,  
Sometimes I wanna slap you in your whole face.  
There's no one quite like you,  
You push all my buttons down.  
I know life would suck without you.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
At the same time, I wanna hug you,  
I wanna wrap my hands around your neck.  
You're an asshole, but I love you,  
And you make me so mad I ask myself  
Why I'm still here, or where could I go  
You're the only love I've ever known.  
But I hate you, I really hate you,  
So much I think it must be  
  
[Chorus]  
True love, true love,  
It must be true love.  
Nothing else can break my heart like  
True love, true love,  
It must be true love.  
No one else can break my heart like you.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Just once try to wrap your little brain around my feelings,  
Just once please try not to be so mean.  
Repeat after me now are R-O-M-A-N-C-EEE,  
Come on I'll say it slowly (romance).  
You can do it baby!  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
At the same time, I wanna hug you,  
I wanna wrap my hands around your neck.  
You're an asshole, but I love you,  
And you make me so mad I ask myself  
Why I'm still here, or where could I go  
You're the only love I've ever known.  
But I hate you, I really hate you,  
So much I think it must be  
  
[Chorus]  
True love, true love,  
It must be true love.  
Nothing else can break my heart like  
True love, true love,  
It must be true love.  
No one else can break my heart like you.  
  
[Hook]  
(I love you, I think it must be love, I love you)  
Why do you rub me up the wrong way?  
Why do you say the things that you say?  
Sometimes I wonder how we ever came to be,  
But without you I'm incomplete.  
  
[Outro]  
(I think it must be)  
True love (it must be), true love,  
It must be true love (it must be)  
Nothing else can break my heart like.  
True love (it must be), true love,  
It must be true love.  
And no one else can break my heart like you (like you),  
No one else can break my heart like you (like you),  
No one else can break my heart like you.
