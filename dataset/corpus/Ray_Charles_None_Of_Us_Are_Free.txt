Well you better listen my sisters and brothers  
'Cause if you do you can hear  
There are voices still calling across the years  
And they're all crying across the ocean  
And they're crying across the land  
And they will till we all come to understand  
None of us are free  
None of us are free  
None of us are free, one of us are chained  
None of us are free  
And there are people still in darkness  
And they just can't see the light  
If you don't say it's wrong then that says it right  
We got try to feel for each other  
Let our brothers know that we care  
Got to get the message, send it out loud and clear  
None of us are free  
None of us are free  
None of us are free, one of us are chained  
None of us are free  
It's a simple truth we all need, just to hear and to see  
None of us are free, one of us is chained  
None of us are free, now I swear your salvation isn't too hard too find  
None of us can find it on our own  
We've got to join together in spirit, heart and mind  
So that every soul who's suffering will know they're not alone  
None of us are free  
None of us are free  
None of us are free, one of us are chained  
None of us are free  
If you just look around you  
You're gonna see what I say  
'Cause the world is getting smaller each passing day  
Now it's time to start making changes  
And it's time for us all to realize  
That the truth is shining real bright right before our eyes  
None of us are free  
None of us are free  
None of us are free, one of us are chained  
None of us are free  
None of us are free  
None of us are free  
None of us are free, one of us are chained  
None of us are free  
None of us are free  
None of us are free  
None of us are free, one of us are chained  
None of us are free  
...
