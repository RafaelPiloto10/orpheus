I got two hands  
I want to clap my hands together  
I got two legs  
I want to dance to heavens door  
I got one heart  
I gonna fill it up with up Jesus  
And I ain't gonna think about trouble anymore  
  
Well now, this old world sometimes it does get lonesome  
And it's many a grown man has hung his head and cried  
Down in your soul there's one that won't desert you  
Ain't it fine to have the Saviour by your side  
  
Now the Lord resides inside a house of golden  
And faith is the door and love is the key  
And warm is the light pouring from his mighty windows  
And that light, my friend, it shines on you and me  
  
When the wind blows on that faithful morning  
And I close my eyes, Lord, and fly my body home  
I don't want my friends to cry no tears about me  
I'll be batheing in the glory of the throne  
  
I got two hands  
I want to clap my hands together  
I got two legs  
I want to dance to heavens door  
I got one heart  
I gonna fill it up with up Jesus  
And I ain't gonna think about trouble anymore
