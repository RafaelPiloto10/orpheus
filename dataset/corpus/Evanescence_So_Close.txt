I've spent so much time  
Throwing rocks at your window  
That I never even knocked  
On your front door  
  
I walk by statues  
Never even made one chip away  
But if I could leave a mark  
On the monument of the heart  
I just might lay myself down  
For a little more than I had  
  
The last day  
The last day  
The last day  
  
Wait a time  
To spare these lies we tell ourselves  
These days have come and gone  
But this time is sweeter than honey
