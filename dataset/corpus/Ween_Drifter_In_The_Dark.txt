Do you ever walk alone?  
Like a drifter in the dark  
Seeking out what isn't there  
Looking only for a spark  
  
From a girl who's all alone  
Maybe she's a-driftin' too  
Like a shadow in the night  
Waitin' just to meet with you  
  
And then perhaps in love you'll stay  
Or fall and go your separate ways  
Still searchin' for a spark  
Like a drifter in the dark  
  
[Repeat: x8]  
Doodn doo doo doodn doo (da da da da da)  
  
Do you ever walk alone?  
Like a drifter in the dark  
Seeking out what isn't there  
Looking only for a spark  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
Like a drifter in the dark
