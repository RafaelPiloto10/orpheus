So I found me a little thing  
Wanna keep me up all night  
She told me don't be so uptight  
She wanna keep up all night  
Damn she might kill me  
  
I found me a pretty little thing  
Wanna keep me up all night  
She says she gonna make things all right  
She wanna keep me up all night  
Damn she might kill me  
  
I'm in Brazil where the scene so fire  
Where the girls and trees can get hotter  
Everything that I see talks to me  
Can't believe how the girls be walking  
  
I've been here about an hour  
They keep saying come talk to me  
I keep thinking there's one and they say us three  
Standing there getting out of the shower  
Turning around showing me the thing got power  
  
Started to converse and I sense a problem  
And I'm thinking girl I can always solve them  
But she didn't want to hear it  
She says she is all mine and I can make him feel it  
All along I was thinking it was gonna be her plus two  
Now they're looking like Lionel the joke's on you  
Next thing I'm feeling is her up and down  
While the girls are watching  
  
So I found me a little thing  
Wanna keep me up all night  
She told me don't be so uptight  
She wanna keep up all night  
Damn she might kill me  
  
I found me a pretty little thing  
Wanna keep me up all night  
She says she gonna make things all right  
She wanna keep me up all night  
Damn she might kill me  
  
I thought there ain't a thing I ain't seen  
Until she pulled out a banner for me  
She said whatever you want  
I know I needed a little vacation  
But now I may never go home
