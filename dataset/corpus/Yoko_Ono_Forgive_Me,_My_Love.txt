Forgive me, my love,  
For hiding my soul from you.  
It seems easier for us  
If I don't show all of myself.  
  
How am I gonna tell you how I miss you?  
How am I gonna tell you how I need you?  
Through pride and hurt and love and fear  
We lay an ocean between us.  
  
Forgive me, my love,  
For closing my eyes to our love.  
It seems easier for us  
If we thought this was just a play.  
  
How am I gonna tell you how I miss you?  
How am I gonna tell you how I need you?  
Through pride and hurt and love and fear  
We hold an ocean inside us.  
  
Let me take your hand  
And press it on my breast  
And you will know that  
The ocean is for you.
