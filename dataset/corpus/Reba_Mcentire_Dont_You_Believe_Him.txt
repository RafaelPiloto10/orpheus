He can give you a reason to live if he wants to  
He can make you forget other loves that you had known  
He has two lips and two arms that thrill you as very few do  
And if you want him to give them to you just ask and he will  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't you believe him  
I did and soon he'll be leaving me  
No don't believe him if you do  
Then soon he'll be leaving you too  
  
He can tell you a lie you believe if he has to  
And you'll trust me till time and the tide both stand still  
He can cry on your shoulder and swear to the things that he won't do  
But be careful for when you're not looking he will  
  
[Chorus]
