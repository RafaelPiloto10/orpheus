I lived in your shadow  
I drove your car  
You thought I belonged in your four walls  
I was never your bunny  
I was never, never your pet  
When you threw me out the window  
I landed on my feet  
Yeah you threw me out the window  
Like a, like a, like a cat  
  
Hey mister you can never own me  
I only let you hold me like a cat  
And mister you can never know me  
I only let you stroke me, like a, like a  
  
You thought I'd be purring  
Curled up by your fire  
Don't want to be kept for your desire  
You said I should be happy  
But it only made me sad  
And when you could never tame me  
That made you mad  
No you could never tame me  
Like a, like a, like a cat  
  
Hey mister you can never own me  
I only let you hold me like a cat  
And mister you can never know me  
I only let you stroke me  
  
You rescued me I didn't want to be saved  
I got tired of your missionary position babe  
  
When you threw me out the window  
I landed on my feet  
Yeah you threw me out the window  
Like, like a, like a cat  
  
Hey mister you can never own me  
I only let you hold me like a cat  
And mister you can never know me  
  
I only let you stroke me like a cat  
And mister you can never know me  
I only let you hold me like a  
  
No you never can own me  
Like a cat  
No you never can own me  
Like a cat  
No you never can own me  
Like a cat
