I lost myself on a cool damp night  
I gave myself in that misty light  
Was hypnotized by a strange delight  
Under a lilac tree  
  
I made wine from the lilac tree  
Put my heart in it's recipe  
It makes me see what I want to see  
And be what I want to be  
  
When I think more than I want to think  
Do things I never should do  
I drink much more that I ought to drink  
Because it brings me back you  
  
Lilac wine is sweet and heady  
Like my love  
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady  
Like my love  
  
Listen to me, I cannot see clearly  
Isn't that she, coming to me  
Nearly here  
  
Lilac wine is sweet and heady  
Where's my love  
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady  
Where's my love  
  
Listen to me, why is everything so hazy  
Isn't that she, or am I just going crazy, dear  
Lilac wine, I feel unready for my love  
Feel unready, for my love
