[Verse 1]  
It's just another day  
It's just another year  
"One step at a time", they say  
"One trip, and you're back that way"  
I don't recognize these eyes  
I don't recognize these hands  
Please believe me when I tell you  
That this is not who I am  
  
[Chorus]  
If I recover, will you take me back again?  
I'm just another, trying hard to fit right in  
But my photographs remind me of who I used to be  
If only I could go back when I was me  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'll try hard to make this ride  
I'll try hard to win this fight  
"One step at a time", they say  
"One trip, and you're back that way"  
I don't recognize these eyes  
I don't recognize these hands  
Please believe me when I tell you  
That this is not who I am  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
Give me strength to fight  
Help me feel alive again  
Make me whole inside  
Instead, this hole inside is killing me  
Oh, I'm begging you  
  
[Chorus]
