Don't look at me  
  
Everyday is so wonderful  
Then suddenly  
It's hard to breathe  
Now and then I get insecure  
From all the pain  
I'm so ashamed  
  
I am beautiful  
No matter what they say  
Words can't bring me down  
I am beautiful  
In every single way  
Yes words can't bring me down  
Oh no  
So don't you bring me down today  
  
To all your friends you're delirious  
So consumed  
In all your doom, ooh  
Trying hard to fill the emptiness  
The pieces gone  
Left the puzzle undone  
Ain't that the way it is  
  
You're beautiful  
No matter what they say  
Words can't bring you down  
Oh no  
You're beautiful  
In every single way  
Yes words can't bring you down  
Oh no  
So don't you bring me down today  
  
No matter what we do (no matter what we do)  
No matter what we say (no matter what we say)  
We're the song inside the tune (yeah, oh yeah)  
Full of beautiful mistakes  
  
And everywhere we go (and everywhere we go)  
The sun will always shine (the sun will always, always, shine)  
And tomorrow we might awake  
On the other side  
  
We're beautiful  
No matter what they say  
Yes words won't bring us down  
Oh no  
We are beautiful  
In every single way  
Yes words can't bring us down  
Oh no  
So don't you bring me down today  
  
Oh, oh  
Don't you bring me down today  
Don't you bring me down, ooh  
Today
