Feel, listen like no one  
Uses dancing, uses dancing  
Mere strings and private strikes  
Uses dancing, uses dancing  
  
Seers through his head  
These words, are looking down  
Through his head As I'm moving the future  
For dancing, for dancing  
  
Jeeper stoner under his eyes  
Uses dancing, uses dancing  
Reed and wooden steel eyes  
Uses dancing, uses dancing  
  
The prays mourn hollow cries  
Uses dancing, uses dancing  
I fear masses are coming in  
As I'm talking to mountains
