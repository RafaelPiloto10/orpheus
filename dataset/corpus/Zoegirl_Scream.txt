Does anybody care what's going on  
Sometimes I'm numb  
Sometimes I'm over come.  
Does anybody see what's going on  
Do I have to wear my scars like a badge on my arm  
For you to see me  
I need relief  
  
Do I have to scream for you to hear me  
Do I have to bleed for you to see me  
Cause I grieve  
Your not listening to me  
Do I need to scream  
  
Has anybody seen what's been done  
Where were my defense  
No one heard my protest  
The eyes of God were watching me  
It's time to make my peace,  
Let is go and be released  
So I can breathe again (breathe again)  
I'm on my knees  
  
Do I have to scream for you to hear me  
Do I have to bleed for you to see me  
Cause I grieve  
Your not listening to me  
Do I need to scream (Repeat)  
  
I don't have to scream for you to hear me  
I don't have to bleed for you to see me  
Cause I'm clean  
And your listening to me  
I don't have to scream
