An angel fell one stormy night  
From heaven's glory  
He split the earth to reign in hell  
Waoh o-oh  
He fears the light  
He fears the truth  
He fears what's going to be  
He spits on life  
He spits on God  
He spits up death for you and me  
  
Prince of Darkness  
Studies the world with hungry eyes  
Prince of Darkness  
Ready to baptize you in lies  
Heart of evil  
Soul of blackness  
Prince of Darkness  
  
He saw the man was just a boy  
With a baby's mind  
He swore damnation of God's creation  
Waoh o-oh  
He lives for hate  
He lives for tears  
He lives up to his name  
He knew the light  
He knew the one  
Who was crucified in pain  
  
Prince of Darkness  
Studies the world with hungry eyes  
Prince of Darkness  
Ready to baptize you in lies  
Heart of evil  
Soul of blackness  
  
He fears the light  
He fears the truth  
He fears what's going to be  
He spits on life  
He spits on God  
He spits up death for you and me  
  
Prince of Darkness  
Studies the world with hungry eyes  
Prince of Darkness  
Ready to baptize you in lies  
Prince of Darkness  
Studies the world with hungry eyes  
Prince of Darkness  
Ready to baptize you in lies  
Prince of Darkness  
  
He smells the breath of sweet human sin  
And deeply breathes it in  
Prince of Darkness
