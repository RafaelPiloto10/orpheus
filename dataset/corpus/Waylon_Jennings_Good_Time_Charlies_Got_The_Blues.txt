Everybody's gone away said they're moving to LA  
There's not a soul I know around everybody's leaving town  
Some caught a freight some caught a plane  
Find the sunshine leave the rain they say this town'll waste your mind  
Must be right cause it's wasting mine  
Some got to win some got to lose good time Charlies got the blues  
  
My heart keeps telling me there ain't no kid at thirty-three  
Play around you lose your wife you play too long you lose your life  
I got my pills to ease the pain can't find a thing to ease the rain  
Sometimes I'd like to try and settle down but everybody's leaving town  
Some got to win some got to lose good time Charlies got the blues
