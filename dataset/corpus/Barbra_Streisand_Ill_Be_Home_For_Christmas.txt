I'm dreaming tonight  
Of a place I love  
Even than more than I usually do  
And although I know  
  
It's long road back  
I promise you  
I'll be home for Christmas  
You can count on me  
  
Please have snow  
And mistletoe  
And presents round the tree  
Christmas eve is gonna find me  
  
Where the love light gleams  
I'll be home for Christmas  
If only in my dreams  
I'll be home for Christmas  
  
You can count on me  
Please have some snow  
And lots of mistletoe  
And presents round that tree  
  
Christmas eve is gonna find me  
Where the love light gleams  
I'll be home for Christmas  
If only in my dreams  
If only in my dreams....
