Make the river deep  
the mountain high  
the cornflower blue as the summer sky  
and heaven above me  
tell her to love me  
make her mine  
  
make the valley green  
the pine tree tall  
the warmth of the sun after raindrops fall  
and heaven above me  
tell her to love me  
make her mine  
  
Is it so wrong to long for  
someone who's so supreme?  
I'm not the one she strong for  
but is a sin if I dream?  
  
I sigh for her  
and her caress  
am I but a voice in the wilderness  
oh heaven above me  
tell her to love me  
make her mine  
  
Is it so wrong to long for  
someone who's so supreme?  
I'm not the one she strong for

I sigh for her  
and her caress  
am I but a voice in the wilderness  
oh heaven above me  
tell her to love me  
make her mine
