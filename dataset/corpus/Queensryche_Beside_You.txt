Take your children down to the water wash their heads and sing, holy holy  
Last night I dreamed you were standing there, strong and tall beside me.  
All my life behind me.  
  
You gently took me by my hand and led me to where I couldn't see,but where
I've always been an island.  
In my dreams I've been an island  
Where I'm all alone, and I've built these walls stone by stone.  
I want to leave but I don't know where to go.  
  
I've tried the best I can, but it's hard to be a man and feel the way you
feel.  
I'm different on the inside. I've tried to give to you what you need to get
you through.  
  
I'll always be beside you.  
The day you were born I held you small and helpless crying, your life and mine
entwining.  
As I looked into your eyes I saw myself in an overview, reaching out to you
from this island in the sea.  
I don't want to be an island.  
  
I've tried the best I can, but it's hard to be a man and feel the way you
feel.  
I'm different on the inside.  
  
I've tried to give to you what you need to get you through.  
I'll always be beside you.
