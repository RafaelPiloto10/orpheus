Mes amis nous allons quelque part don't tout  
Le monde  
Se rappelle d'un endroit ou l'herbe etait  
Toujours verte  
Et la fete ne s'arretait jamais  
A autour do rocher  
  
This a a little tale about a hotel in the Caribbean.  
Well it wasn't really a hotel, it was a patio  
Bar with funky rooms and an outdoor disco  
With bad wiring. Some people said if you looked  
Between the cracks of the floorboards of our  
Dance floor you would see Hell. If you ever  
Went there, you would know what I'm talking  
About. If you never had, then we  
Thought we'd send you a little musical souvenir.  
  
Some say it was a planet  
Some say it was a rock  
For five wild years in L"Orient  
The party never stopped  
  
There were pirates from the Indies  
There were models from Paris  
There were locals and New Yorkers  
And the Brazilian Navy  
  
By mini-moke and scooters  
In cabs and stolen cars  
Came the creatures of the evening  
From St. Martin and from Mars  
  
Alors, Alors, Alors, Alors alors come on, come on  
Vien faire un tour autour do rocher  
On croisera les fantomes do passe  
Viens faire un tour autour do rocher  
Sur les souvenirs l'herbe a poussee  
  
Girl at the pool table  
Puts on a show for free  
They were bivouacked in the bathroom  
By the hot tub near the sea  
  
Every night at midnight  
Seems the devil took control  
And the hill became a parking lot  
Fueled by rock 'n' roll  
  
They were talking by the cannon  
But I couldn't believe my ears  
The Russian had plutonium  
The sailor wanted beers  
  
They shook hands in the moonlight  
And broke out a big cigar  
Just business as usual  
Beneath the tropic stars  
  
Alors(come on) alors (let's go) alors  
Vien faire in tour autour do rocher  
On croisera les fantomes do pass'e  
Viens faire un tour autour do richer  
Sur les souvinirs l'herbe a poussee  
  
It was better than a painting  
At le Musee de Beaux Arts  
And simply what we did for fun  
Back in the old St. Barts  
  
Then the glitz and all the glamour  
Hit like a hurricane  
Or maybe we just all grew up  
But it never was the same  
  
The gendarmes finally closed the joint  
And the fire it did the rest  
But on New Year's Eve of '91  
We sang the last request  
  
We were dancing in the ashes  
We were dancing in the sea  
We were dancing in the ruins  
Where we left our memories  
Come on let's go alors  
Vien faire un tour autour do rocher  
On croisera les fantomes do pass'e  
Viens faire un tour autour do rocher  
Sur les souvinirs l'herbe a poussee  
  
Alors. Alors, Alors, Alors  
Vien faire un tour autour do rocher  
On croisera les fantomes do pass'e  
Viens faire untour autour do rocher  
Sur les souvenirs l'herbe a poussee
