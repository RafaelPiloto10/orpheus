See how the child reaches out instinctively  
To feel how the fire will feel.  
  
See how the man reaches out instinctively  
For what he cannot have.  
  
The pull and the push of it all.  
  
Reaching out for the hand  
Reaching out for the hand that smacked  
Reaching out for that hand to hold  
Reaching out for the Star  
Reaching out for the Star that explodes  
Reaching out for Mama.  
  
See how the flower leans instinctively toward the light  
See how the heart reaches out instinctively  
For no reason but to touch.  
  
The pull and the push of it all.  
  
Reaching out for the hand  
Reaching out for the hand that smacked  
Reaching out for that hand to hold  
Reaching out for the Star  
Reaching out for the Star that explodes  
Reaching out for Mama.  
(Can't we see)  
Reaching out for Mama.
