Sha, sha, sha  
  
I probably shouldn't say this  
But at times I get so scared  
When I think about the previous  
Relationship we shared  
It was awesome, but we lost it  
It's not possible for me not to care  
And now we're standing in the rain  
But nothing's ever gonna change until you hear  
My dear  
  
The seven things I hate about you  
The seven things I hate about you  
Oh, you  
You're vain, your games, you're insecure  
You love me, you like her  
You made me laugh, you made me cry, I don't know which side to buy  
Your friends, they're jerks, and when you act like them, just know it hurts  
I wanna be with the one I know  
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do  
You make me love you  
  
It's awkward and it's silent  
As I wait for you to say  
But what I need to hear now your sincere apology  
When you mean it, I'll believe it If you text it I'll delete it  
Let's be clear  
Oh, I'm not coming back  
You're taking seven steps here  
  
The seven things I hate about you  
You're vain, your games, you're insecure  
You love me, you like her  
You made me laugh, you made me cry, I don't know which side to buy  
Your friends, they're jerks, and when you act like them, just know it hurts  
I wanna be with the one I know  
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do  
You make me love you  
  
Compared to all the great things  
That would take too long to write  
I probably should mention  
The seven that I like  
  
The seven things I like about you  
Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's  
When we kiss, I'm hypnotized  
You made me laugh, you made me cry, but I guess that's both that I'll have to
buy  
Your hand in mine when we're intertwined, everything's alright  
I wanna be with the one I know  
And the seventh thing I like the most that you do  
You make me love you  
  
Sha, sha, you do, oh
