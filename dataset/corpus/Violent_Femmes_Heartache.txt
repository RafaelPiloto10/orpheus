I know nobody ever taught you  
How to dance like that  
Nobody ever taught you  
How to dance like that  
  
Nobody ever taught me  
How to dance like that  
Heartache---too late  
And I gotta get up  
  
Heartache---too late  
And I gotta get up  
Heartache---too late  
And I gotta get up  
  
I know  
I been workin' twenty-five hours a day  
I don't want to live this way  
Five and a half weeks with one day off  
Stop the train I'm getting off
