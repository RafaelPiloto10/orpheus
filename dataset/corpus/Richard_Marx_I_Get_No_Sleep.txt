Got a house full of fortune and they pay me in gold  
For something I'd do for free  
But there's still something missing that a  
man can't hold  
It's like a weight over me  
  
So scared the thrill will be gone  
But I'm the one who keeps the pressure on  
  
[Chorus]  
All I've got is all I need  
But I get no sleep and I'm tired to the bone  
All I've got is all I need  
But I get no sleep and I know I'm not alone  
  
Well, I'm sick of walking 'round with blood in my eyes  
Just keeping up with this town  
I' m a roadrunner racing, but I don't see the signs  
I've got to learn to slow down  
  
My life makes it hard to complain  
But there's times I'd take my school days back again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Four o'clock and I'm still counting sheep  
Love to change the system, but I'm in too deep  
I keep the pressure far away as I can  
But it still comes back again, back again, yeah, yeah  
  
My life makes it hard to complain  
But there's times I'd take my school days back again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All I've got is all I need  
But I get no sleep and I'm sure I'm not alone  
I'm not alone, yeah
