Life's too short to even care at all oh,  
I'm losing my mind losing my mind losing control  
These fishes in the sea they're staring at me oh, oh  
A wet world aches for a beat of a drum  
Oh, oh  
  
If I could find a way to see this straight  
I'd run away  
To some fortune that I should have found by now  
I'm waiting for this cough syrup to come down, come down  
  
Life's too short to even care at all oh,  
I'm coming up now coming up now out of the blue oh,  
These zombies in the park they're looking for my heart  
Oh , oh  
A dark world aches for a splash of the sun oh, oh  
  
If I could find a way to see this straight  
I'd run away  
To some fortune that I should have found by now  
  
And so I run now to the things they said could restore me  
Restore life the way it should be  
I'm waiting for this cough syrup to come down  
  
Life's too short to even care at all oh  
I'm losing my mind losing my mind losing control oh,  
  
If I could find a way to see this straight  
I'd run away  
To some fortune that I should have found by now  
  
So I run now to the things they said could restore me  
Restore life the way it should be  
I'm waiting for this cough syrup to come down  
  
One more spoon of cough syrup now, oh  
One more spoon of cough syrup now, oh
