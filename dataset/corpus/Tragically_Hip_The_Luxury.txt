Zoo Lion sobers up and starts to scream and shout  
A little dose of home-fire got him all smoothed out  
Melancholy wine-soaked tenderness  
She hated it here and she couldn't care less  
  
Prisonyard stares and Fleur-De-lis tattoos  
Cannibal are saving all their bones for soup  
Eating with my fingers and sucking hulls of ships  
My parasite don't deserve no better than this  
  
The Golden Rim Motor Inn  
Soft water and a color TV  
So consumed with the shape I'm in  
Can't enjoy the luxury  
  
She says, "Why are you partial to that Playboy con?  
When you can see me naked anytime you want?"  
If I had loads of money to make me tame and sour  
I could pay you to remind me of my baby by the hour  
  
Zoo Lion sobers up and starts to scream and shout  
A little dose of home-fire got him all smoothed out  
If this is where it all starts getting good  
Then I'll be here waiting for you, like I said I would  
  
The Golden Rim Motor Inn  
Soft water and a color TV  
So consumed with the shape I'm in  
Can't enjoy the luxury  
  
The luxury
