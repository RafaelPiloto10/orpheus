You see me on the street, well you guess I'm doing fine  
Oh but it's fantasy baby, almost all the time  
I've got to get away, by myself  
Oh the way it's going, soon be needing help  
'Cause I'm just a man, doing the best I can  
Don't you understand, I just want some peace of mind  
  
You see me on the stage, doing my job  
I learn to do it well, keep on singing the song  
But sometimes it gets, so lonely out there  
When you're on the road and you're going nowhere  
Because I'm just a man, oh I ain't got no plans  
Don't you understand, I'm just trying to find some peace of mind  
  
I have to stand in line, baby when I'm in queue  
I got to do it all, just the same as you  
Got my doubts about it, oh but I try  
Oh make it work with tears in my eyes  
Because I'm just a man, only trying to do the best I can  
  
Don't you understand, I want some peace of mind  
Oh I'm just a man, baby I ain't got no plan  
Oh don't you understand, got to get some peace of mind  
  
Oh got to get, got to get some peace of mind  
Oh got to get, got to get some peace of mind  
Got to get, got to get some peace of mind  
Got to, got to, got to get, got to get, get some peace of mind  
  
Got to get, got to get, get some peace of mind  
Get me some, get me some, get me some, get me some peace of mind  
Get me some, get me some, peace of mind  
Get me some baby, get me some peace of mind
