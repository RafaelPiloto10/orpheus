Tonight, I, I just want to talk to the ladies, oh fellows your cool but girls  
  
If you've got a good man, you'd better keep him,  
  
Oh I know you're saying right now, what does she know  
  
Who is she to tell me about my situation, well, I don't know your situation  
  
But whatever it is, you should try to stay together  
  
You know that big argument that you had the other night, remember  
  
Well, today it's not nothing, just don't let him leave you honey  
  
Cause then you'll find out that it wasn't those real big things you loved
about  
Him  
  
It was the real small things, go on and laugh but it's true  
  
You know, things that you've seen a thousand times around the house  
  
But never paid any attention to, like helping with the groceries  
  
And helping in the yard and painting and repairing and huh, paying the bills  
  
But you know now, all I have is memories and regrets  
  
I could have given our love a chance to grow but no  
  
I had to challenge it and be heard (oh), let me tell you something  
  
That female liberation stuff, I don't know, sometimes I don't think it's worth
it  
  
And I'm really feeling, feeling kind of bad yaul, I'm catching hell living
here  
Alone  
  
Hmm, I never realized, oh Lord, that you mean so much to me  
  
I'm catching hell living here alone, I want you to come back baby  
  
Come back cause here's where you belong, oh yeah  
  
If I could replay, if I could replay that whole scene again, oh well  
  
You know that I would never, never say it again, that our love, our love is at  
Its end  
  
And oh, you know that I would kind of ease on back, yes I would  
  
And let confusion pass on by, I took a fools'way out, oh yeah  
  
Without one good reason why, I'm catching hell, catching hell  
  
Lord I'm living, living, living here alone, Alone, lone, I didn't believe it  
Could be  
  
You know all the pressure on me, all the time, oh, I'm catching hell, well,
well  
  
Living here alone, lone, lone, lone, lone, lone, lone, to tell you the truth  
  
To tell you the truth I'm going out of my mind---, yeah, oh do you hear me  
Tonight  
  
I don't have too (this is my story) much more to say except  
  
Somebody (hey, this is my song) told me that if you've got something  
  
That's good to you And you don't use it (sad, sad) you might lose it (sad,
song)  
  
(Song, so sad) So girls hold on to your good thing (Oh), (you gotta hold on a  
Little bit now)  
  
And don't let go, oh---do you hear me tonight, It's so sad living alone  
  
Living alone (Hmm), hold on to your good thing, hold on, (well, well) oh yeah  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah---oh, oh, oh, Lordy, Lordy do you know what it's like  
  
Catching hell, (somebody turn up the microphone, oh---), Oh, no, no, no, no,  
No, no
