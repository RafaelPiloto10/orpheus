Wait a minute more before you roll  
I got plans for us thought you should know  
Wait a minute more before you leave  
Promise you're always coming back to me  
'Cause I've had visions in my head  
From the very first day that we ever met  
Everything that I've been waiting for, is knocking at my door  
You make me feel so high, your love is like sunshine  
You had me at hello, don't mind if I say so  
So before it fades away, I got one thing left to say  
Your love is like sunshine  
Throw another dime in that wishing well  
If I could stay here underneath your spell  
I'll do anything that you want me to  
Just wanna be the one that gets to you  
"cause baby boy oh you're so fine  
I get chills when you look at me with that smile  
Everything we do is just so good  
  
You make me wanna move  
You make me feel so high, your love is like sunshine  
You had me at hello, don't mind if I say so  
So before it fades away, I got one thing left to say  
Your love is like sunshine  
You make me feel so good  
You make me want to move  
I'm under your spell and I will do  
Anything to get to you  
You make me feel so high, your love is like sunshine  
You had me at hello, don't mind if I say so  
So before it fades away, I got one thing left to say  
Your love is like sunshine  
(Repeat until fade)
