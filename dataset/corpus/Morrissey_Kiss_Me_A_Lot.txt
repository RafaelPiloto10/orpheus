Bastille mausoleum  
Stockyard, churchyard  
Your mammy's backyard  
  
I don't care when or where  
I just care that you're there  
And that you will...  
  
Kiss me a lot, kiss me a lot  
Kiss me all over my face  
Kiss me a lot, kiss me a lot  
Kiss me all over the place  
Kiss me a lot, kiss me a lot  
Kiss me all over and then when you've kissed me  
Kiss me all over again  
  
Bastille mausoleum  
Stockyard, churchyard  
Your mammy's backyard  
  
I don't care when or where  
I only care that the two of us are there  
And that you, and that you will...  
  
Kiss me a lot, kiss me a lot  
Kiss me all over my face  
Kiss me a lot, kiss me a lot  
Kiss me all over the place  
Kiss me a lot, kiss me a lot  
Kiss me all over and then when you've kissed me  
Kiss me all over again  
  
Kiss me a lot, kiss me a lot  
Kiss me all over my face  
Kiss me a lot, kiss me a lot  
All over the place  
Kiss me a lot, kiss me a lot  
I don't care where or when but when you've kissed me  
Kiss me all over again
