Know it's around, I don't have any doubts about that night  
I'll see you get it tonight, and if I can't I'll cry and cry  
You won't see me without it and I'll see you tonite  
  
But I know it's around, I don't have any doubts about that night  
  
I'll see you get it tonight, and if I can't I'll cry and cry  
You won't see me without it and I'll see you tonite, outside  
See you tonite, outside, see you tonite  
  
I'll see you get it tonight, and if I can't I'll cry and cry  
You won't see me without it and I'll see you tonite, outside  
See you tonite, outside, see you tonite
