Blue sky, devil eye  
Cyanide, suicide  
Double down, let it ride  
Lose your money  
Bruise your pride  
Easy come, easy went  
Ghetto slums tenements  
Things look real, Old Testament  
Blame it all on the president  
  
[Chorus:]  
The emperor's got brand new clothes  
And everybody but him knows he's naked  
But you don't say a word  
The emperor's got brand new jewels  
Wake up soon you silly fools  
He's naked  
But you don't say a word  
The rich they get richer  
The poor they get poorer  
While liberty stands naked screaming in horror  
The emperor raped her but we just ignore her  
The rich they get richer  
The poor they get poorer  
  
Euthanize, youth will rise  
Scrutinize, truth from lies  
Time to revolutionize  
Organize, weaponize  
Easy come, easy go  
Think I'm movin' just a little bit too slow  
Got front row tickets to the big freak show  
Wait for the whole freakin' thing to blow  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Homicide, genocide  
Victimize, paralyze  
Empathize and analyze  
Compromise and vandalize  
Easy come, hard to take  
Wide awake the original fake  
Find the heart, drive the stake  
Wait for the whole freakin' thing to break  
  
[Chorus:]
