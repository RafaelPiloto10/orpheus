(Was actually sung by Unique ii)  
  
Last night I had the strangest dream,  
I sailed away to China, in a little row boat to find ya,  
And you said you had to get your laundry cleaned  
Didn't want no one to hold you what does that mean? And you said...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Ain't nothin' gonna break my break my stride,  
Nobody gonna slow me down, oh no,  
I've got to keep on movin'.  
Ain't nothin' gonna break my stride,  
I'm runnin' and I won't touch ground, oh no,  
I've got to keep on movin'.  
  
You're on the road and now you pray it's gone  
The road behind was rocky, but now you're feelin' cocky.  
You look at me and you see your past.  
Is that the reason why you're runnin' so fast and you said...  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Never let another girl like you work me over  
Never let another girl like you drag me under  
If I meet another girl like you I will tell her  
Never want another girl like you have to say oh  
  
(chorus)(2x)  
  
Repeat till fades
