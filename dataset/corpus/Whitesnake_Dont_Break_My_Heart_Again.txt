I'm gonna take it to the limit of my love,  
Before I turn and walk away  
I've had enough of holding on  
The promises of yesterday  
Every day of my life, it seems,  
Trouble's knocking at my door,  
It's hard to try and satisfy  
When you don't know what you're fighting for  
  
Time and again I sing your song,  
But, I've been runnin' on empty far too long  
I've had enough holdin' on to the past,  
Make no mistake, it could be your last  
  
Don't break my heart again, like you did before  
Don't break my heart again, I couldn't take anymore  
  
I never hide the feeling inside,  
And though I'm standing my back to the wall,  
I know that even in a summer love  
A little bit of rain must fall  
But, every road I take I know  
Where it's gonna lead me to,  
Because I've traveled every highway  
And they all keep coming back to you  
  
Time and again I sing your song,  
But, I've been runnin' on empty far too long  
I've had enough holdin' on to the past,  
Make no mistake, it could be your last  
  
Don't break my heart again, like you did before  
Don't break my heart again, I couldn't take anymore  
Don't break my heart  
  
Don't break my heart again, like you did before  
Don't break my heart again, I couldn't take anymore
