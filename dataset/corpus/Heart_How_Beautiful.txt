Winter in the city The year is running dry New Year's resolutions  
So perfect in mind Gonna lose this blue addiction of mine Me,  
I work long hours First to come and last to go  
I walk by Christmas windows Full of things I'll never own Things  
  
I cannot give you My fortune's set in stone  
  
[Chorus]  
How beautiful the falling snow It hushes all the world And heals a melancholy
heart  
How beautiful, how beautiful The candle in the window It dances and it swirls  
How beautiful the snow tonight How beautiful the world How beautiful,
beautiful  
  
Da da da da's For some, the table's laden Others are denied Makes my love run
deeper  
When I see how hard you try And just like you, the snow falls Silent in the
night  
  
[Chorus]
