So you found someone  
You found some heartache  
You found some fun  
You had some give and take  
You had a friend  
You had a fight  
You saw it end  
And then you're up all night  
Have you seen the way she walks  
The way she smiles at me  
Laugh a while and talk a lot  
And you're beginning to see  
That you get lost in her eyes  
She takes you away  
You start to talk  
And time it flies  
She takes you away  
She takes her time and leads you on  
And then she lets you go  
Time to time she'll lead you on  
And then she'll let you know  
Then you get lost in her eyes  
She takes you away  
You start to talk  
And time it flies  
She takes you away  
Then you get lost in her eyes  
She takes you away  
You start to talk  
And time it flies  
She takes you away  
You found someone  
You found some heartache  
You found some fun  
You had some give and take  
You had a friend  
You had a fight  
You saw it end  
But that's alright  
Have you seen the way she walks  
The way she smiles at me  
Laugh a while and talk a lot  
And you're beginning to see  
That you get lost in her eyes  
She takes you away  
You start to talk  
And time it flies  
She takes you away
