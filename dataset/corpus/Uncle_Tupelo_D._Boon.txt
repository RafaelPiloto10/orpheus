Do you remember, remember D. Boon  
Part of what he was is a part of me now and if you think back, where would he
be  
Where would I be if time had allowed  
  
This isn't written for any one man it's about me  
This isn't written for anyone alive just the songs that he sang  
  
I've been told that it's a waste of time  
Well, so what  
Will it be worth mine  
  
And if Managua's bullets don't fly young men still would die for glory  
Or for their countries  
It's just me and Jay  
Playing our guitars along with it all  
  
This isn't written for any one man it's about me  
This isn't written for anyone alive just the songs that he sang  
  
And I'm not old  
So I've got nothing but time to waste will it be worth mine
