(Lyrics: Cohen, Recorded By Buffy Sainte-Marie)  
  
God is alive, magic is afoot  
God is alive, magic is afoot  
God is alive, magic is afoot  
God is afoot, magic is alive  
Alive is afoot, magic never died  
God never sickened  
Many poor men lied  
Many sick men lied  
Magic never weakened  
Magic never hid  
Magic always ruled  
God is afoot, God never died  
God was ruler  
Though his funeral lengthened  
Though his mourners thickened  
Magic never fled  
Though his shrouds were hoisted  
The naked God did live  
Though his words were twisted  
The naked magic thrived  
Though his death was published  
Round and round the world  
The heart did not believe  
  
Many hurt men wondered  
Many struck men bled  
Magic never faltered  
Magic always lead  
Many stones were rolled  
But God would not lie down  
Many wild men lied  
Many fat men listened  
Though they offered stones  
Magic still was fed  
Though they locked their coffers  
God was always served  
Magic is afoot, God is alive  
Alive is afoot  
  
Alive is in command  
Many weak men hungered  
Many strong men thrived  
Though they boast of solitude  
God was at their side  
Nor the dreamer in his cell  
Nor the captain on the hill  
Magic is alive  
Though his death was pardoned  
Round and round the world  
The heart would not believe  
  
Though laws were carved in marble  
They could not shelter men  
Though altars built in parliaments  
They could not order men  
Police arrested magic and magic went with them  
Mmmmm.... For magic loves the hungry  
But magic would not tarry  
It moves from arm to arm  
It would not stay with them  
Magic is afoot  
It cannot come to harm  
It rests in an empty palm  
It spawns in an empty mind  
But magic is no instrument  
Magic is the end  
Many men drove magic  
But magic stayed behind  
Many strong men lied  
They only passed through magic  
And out the other side  
Many weak men lied  
They came to God in secret  
And though they left Him nourished  
They would not tell who healed  
Though mountains danced before them  
They said that God was dead  
Though his shrouds were hoisted  
The naked God did live  
This I mean to whisper to my mind  
This I mean to laugh within my mind  
This I mean my mind to serve  
Til' service is but magic  
Moving through the world  
And mind itself is magic  
Coursing through the flesh  
And flesh itself is magic  
Dancing on a clock  
And time itself  
The magic length of God
