Donna on my mind when I get up in the morning,  
Donna on my mind the whole day through,  
Love can't come so quick and real without any warning  
Wonder if she's thinking of me too.  
  
Once I thought that no one girl could ever hold me  
Even thought this thing called love was just fantasy,  
Now I won't be satisfied until she's mine,  
Till then I'll just have Donna on my mind.
