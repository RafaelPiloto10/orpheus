Sweet thing  
I know how strong I can appear  
But your don't know the days  
Since somebody loved me  
You came  
And led me through that door again  
You say you want to stay  
But you don't know me (no you don't)  
  
You make me feel safe  
  
Someday  
My darkest fears will find their way  
After all  
Somebody loves me  
All day  
My heart tells strangers how I feel  
And it's hard not to feel this way  
When you thought your future was on prescription  
  
You make me feel safe
