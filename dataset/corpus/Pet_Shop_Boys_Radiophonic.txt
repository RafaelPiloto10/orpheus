In the air  
In the air  
  
The night was long  
Now the crowd has gone  
There's sunlight on my bed  
Feels like a radiophonic  
Workshop's  
Beaming straight into my head  
It could make you weep  
I can't get to sleep  
There's ringing in my ears  
Like a radiophonic workshop  
Orchestrating all my  
Stupid fears  
  
[Chorus]  
Radiophonic  
I think I'm in love  
Radiophonic  
I think I'm in love  
  
My skin is itching  
I'm totally twitching  
With the pounding in my head  
Like a dub sub-sonic beat-box  
Booming bass under the bed  
My hands are shaking  
My mind is aching  
With a feeling deep inside  
That you've been staring  
Sending signals  
Every time our paths collide  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Think I'm in love  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In the air  
In the air
