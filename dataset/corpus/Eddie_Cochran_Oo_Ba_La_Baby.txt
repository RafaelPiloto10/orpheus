Oo ba Ia baby, he's my Joe  
Oo ba la baby, love him so  
Oo ba la baby, never-never-never let me go  
Dancin' at a party when Joe walked in  
I came with Pete but I left with him  
Oo ba la baby, he's my Joe

Oo ba la baby, never-never-never let me go  
Young fifteen, I love my Joe

Now at eighteen, ooh-ooh-ooh  
Ah, oo ba la baby, he's my Joe  
Oo oa la baby, love him so  
Oo ba la baby, never-never-never let me go

And all the women love him, oh yes-yes-yes
