Hey, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh  
Well, the first time I saw you  
Was the first time I lost you  
And the first time I kissed you  
Was the first time I missed you  
There were times when we tried to  
Get by with some love too  
But the things that we went through  
Were so cold, don't let me remind you  
It takes one to be alone  
And it takes two to carry on  
Tell me what you want to say  
When you'll take my love  
And just walk away  
Is it love that we're missing  
Peace of mind we're not getting  
Are the games that we're playing  
Simply our way of entertaining  
Since the start you don't seem to  
Realize what I've been through  
Since the start I have tried to  
Make you see that I need you  
It takes one to be alone  
And it takes two to carry on  
Tell me what you want to say  
When you'll take my love  
And just walk away  
And at times when we drift to  
Our knees but forgot to  
Leave behind all the past fun  
Sometimes I find it hard to comfort  
Wonder why we're not one  
Is it love that we're missing  
Peace of mind we're not getting  
Is it love that we're missing  
Is it love that we're missing  
Peace of mind we're not getting  
Tell me is it love that we're missing  
I tried so hard to make it work  
But it seems to me, only got hurt  
Is it love that we're missing  
Peace of mind we're not getting  
Is it love that we're missing  
Leave behind all the past fun  
[Incomprehensible]  
Is it love that we're missing
