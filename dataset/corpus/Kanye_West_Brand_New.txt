[Verse: Kanye West]  
They say your attitude determines your latitude  
I'm high as a motherfucker - fly as a motherfucker  
And still the motherfucker you love to hate  
But can't - because you love what I make  
Now ain't - that about a bitch  
And I'ma talk shit until I'm out of hits  
They don't want to turn they speakers up they claim I ain't deep enough  
All that talkin' I feed off of - keep it up  
I'm relaxin' my feet is up - I'm leavin' you haters  
Like when Shaq left the Lakers just to "heat" It Up  
I state the stats to stunt - I don't need to front  
I make history E'ry day - I don't need a month  
The survey says - by the streets according  
Kanye's just important as Michael Jordan  
Was to the Nba when he was scorin'  
Ralph Lauren was borin' before I wore him and...

[Verse: Rhymefest]  
Now Some Women Hit The Mall And Some Shop At The Thrift Store  
Some Of 'em Mix And Match And Make It Look Like They Get More  
Some Of Y'all Know You Wear A Sixteen - Squeezin' Into A Six  
Damn - What You Make Them Jeans Rip For?  
I Guess She's Lookin' For A Brand New Man Who  
Ain't Always Gotta Sit Down Cause He Can't Stand You  
Boo - This The Brand New Jam To Dance To  
While You Givin' Me "head" Like Shampoo - Come As You Came  
Skip The Brand Name - I Won't Brand You  
What You Do Here'll Stay Here Like Cancun  
Besides Your Breasts Is Augmented - I Like Things Authentic  
Look At All My Whips, They're All Vintage  
I Got A Loft With A View Of The Sea  
See I Take Some More shit And Make It New For Me  
Pimp It Out Like Xzibit To The (Oomph) Degree  
Why Spend And Arm And A Leg - We Can Kick It For Free You See...

I'm Quick To Give Y'all niggaz Constructive Criticism  
Like "wait - You Basically Suck" - His Mother Said "my Son Wanna Rhyme!"  
I'm Like "ma'am - I Don't Agree With That Decision  
Nothin' Against Him - But If He Step I Got To Diss Him  
I Listen To That Weak shit - All Of It - I Can't Follow It  
[Barf) Excuse Me - I'm "whack"tose Intolerant  
"I Worked Too Hard To Get My Baby Ballin' Kid!"  
Down The Fives - Had Me Blue Collar Poppin' It  
Now I'm In The Club - And Look Who I Get It Poppin' With  
Me And 'ye Go Back Like Crew Cuts  
He Hook Me Up - As Long As I Don't Ask Him For Too Much  
But Even He Know 'fest Is Layin' It Down  
Cause This Is Just An Old Beat He Had Layin' Around!
