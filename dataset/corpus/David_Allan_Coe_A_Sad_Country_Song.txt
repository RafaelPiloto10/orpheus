If you're feeling lonely  
And think you're the only one  
Left that's alone in a bar  
If you need somebody  
With shoulders to cry on  
Well, baby, I'm not very far  
Just look for my name on a jukebox  
When you're tired of being alone  
Put in a dime  
And I'll take the time  
To sing you a sad country song  
  
If you started drinkin'  
And still can't stop thinkin'  
About all those all nights alone  
If teardrops start fallin'  
And you keep on callin'  
To find out there's nobody home  
Just look for my name on a jukebox  
When you're tired of being alone  
Put in a dime  
And I'll take the time  
I'll sing you a sad country song
