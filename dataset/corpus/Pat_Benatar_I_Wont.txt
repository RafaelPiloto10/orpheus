I was there when you cried like a baby  
When you thought that maybe  
Things weren't goin' your way  
I was there when you asked me  
Just 'cause you asked me and I didn't hesitate  
  
Now that I need you, you turn away  
Like I was nothing, like it was a big mistake  
Come on baby, you know it ain't right  
Tell me how do you sleep at night  
  
I won't behave, sit quietly by while you take  
Everything that I keep inside of me  
I won't be still, Oh no, not I  
'Cause there's no way that I'd stay here  
I'd rather die than love you  
I'd rather die than love you  
You know that I would rather die  
  
It isn't fair to take someone's heart  
Tear it apart, use it like you don't care  
How does it feel to be hurt  
It's gonna get worse  
It's gonna get ugly, I swear  
  
How many tears can one person cry  
How much is enough  
When's it time to say goodbye  
Come on baby, you know it ain't right  
Tell me how do you sleep at night?
