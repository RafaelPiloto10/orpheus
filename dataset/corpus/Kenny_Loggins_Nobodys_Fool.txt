I know you think, I'm no match for you baby  
You like making it rough on me, don't you? My my...  
Back to the shadows, ah ah yeah  
Nothing suits me better than that  
In time to start the healing  
Got to learn to be the ball  
And I can't keep from laughing at it all  
Whoa whoa, I'm going now  
I'm going all the way  
Sooner or later, gotta love somebody  
I don't care how long it takes  
Like a shot to the heart, I've got news for you  
I may not look so smart, but I'm nobody's fool  
Oh no, lassoing love for you baby  
Taking it slow, it's too much for me to analyze  
Still alright, heading into the rhythm of the southern light  
Winds of wild insanity, blow with me tonight  
Shouting love to all you cowboys, alright  
Whoa whoa, I'm going now  
I'm going all the way  
Sooner or later, gotta love somebody  
I don't care how long it takes  
You can turn up the heat, but I'm playing it cool  
I know it's hard to believe, but I ain't nobody's fool  
I'm going all the way  
Sooner or later, gotta love somebody  
I don't care how long it takes  
You might think that I've not gone to school on you  
Baby like it or not, I ain't nobody's fool  
My illusion nation become a sound surprise  
You may turn to deny it  
To the place when the clouds stops the wind in the face  
Leaves you dumbfounded there in his waste  
I'm going all the way  
Sooner or later, gotta love somebody  
I don't care how long it takes  
Like a shot to the heart, I've got news for you  
Maybe I'm not so smart, but I'm nobody's fool  
I'm going all the way (Ooh yeah)  
I'm going all the way (Nobody's fool baby, nobody's fool)  
I don't care how long it takes (I don't care... Listen to the right)  
I'm going all the way (Who's fooling who?)
