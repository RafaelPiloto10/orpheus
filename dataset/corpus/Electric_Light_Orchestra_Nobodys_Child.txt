Painted lady, stop that closin' in on me,  
Painted lady, you're supposed to be a dream,  
Painted lady, you better stay away from me.  
  
Painted lady, why you loosinin' my tie,  
Painted lady, what's that twinkle in your eye,  
Painted lady, you better stay away from me.  
  
Painted lady, with your jewels and your beads,  
Painted lady, don't you do these dirty deeds,  
Painted lady, you better stay here with me.  
  
Nobody's child til I saw the light of your smile.  
Painted lady, nobody's child, you have set me free.  
  
Nobody's child, you came in and stayed for a while.  
Painted lady, nobody's child, you have set me free.
