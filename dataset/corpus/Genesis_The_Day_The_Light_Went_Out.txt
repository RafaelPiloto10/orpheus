When they went to bed that night, no one would have believed  
That in the morning light would not be there  
The dark hung heavy on the air like the grip of a jealous man  
No place was there known to have been spared  
Then panic took control of minds as fear hit everyone  
The day the light went out of the daytime sky  
  
Artificial light could hardly penetrate the gloom  
Nothing out of reach could be observed  
Looting, pillage, murder, rape became the rule of that day  
Who hit him no one knew, or whom he hit  
Cars were caught in pileups and the planes could never land  
The day the light went out of the daytime sky  
  
"Now I can rest here after my journey  
Now I can feed here before I continue."  
  
Some were there who's heads were clear who sought, tried to find  
The nature of this deadly foe, the dark  
It seemed the sun was still somewhere, though hidden from their sight  
By something, though amorphous, yet alive  
And so they looked for ways to rid themselves of the parasite  
The day the light went out of the daytime sky  
  
"Now I can rest here after my journey  
Now I can feed here before I continue."  
  
They tried in many fruitless ways to see the noonday sun  
By blasting with their missiles through the dark  
But soon a kind of sleepy state came over everyone  
Till nothing seemed to stir or even breathe  
And when the darkness chose to disappear, not many had survived  
Then came a shadow - another had arrived  
And again the light went out of the daytime sky
