Pay to kill, die to lose, hunted, hunter which are you  
Diablo come again to make trophies out of men  
Lose your skin, lose your skull, one by one the sack is full  
In the heat dehydrate, know which breath will be your last  
  
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, you've got to kill to stay alive  
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, you've got to kill to stay alive  
  
Show them no fear, show them no pain  
Show them no fear, show them no pain  
Show them no fear, show them no pain  
Show them no fear, show them no pain  
  
Human heart, human mind, intellect intertwined  
Focus sharp in the night, watch the jungle burning bright  
Toe to toe throw the line, everyone's caught hand tied  
Iron will iron fist, how could it have come to this?  
  
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, you've got to kill to stay live  
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, you've got to kill to stay alive  
  
Show them no fear, show them no pain  
Show them no fear, show them no pain  
Show them no fear, show them no pain  
Show them no fear, show them no pain  
  
Show them no fear, show them no pain  
Show them no fear, show them no pain  
Show them no fear, show them no pain
