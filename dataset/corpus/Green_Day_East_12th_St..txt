And nobody cares  
And nobody cares  
Does anyone care  
If nobody cares?  
  
And nobody cares  
And nobody cares  
Does anyone care  
If nobody cares?  
  
Jesus filling out paper work now  
At the facility on East 12th St.  
He's not listening to a word now  
He's in his own world and he's daydreaming  
He'd rather be doing something else now  
Like cigarettes and coffee with the underbelly  
His life's on the line with anxiety now  
And she had enough  
And he had plenty  
  
Somebody get me out of here  
Anybody get me out of here  
Somebody get me out of here  
Get me the fuck right out of here  
  
So far away  
I dont want to stay  
Get me outta here right now  
  
I just want to be free  
Is there a possibility?  
Get me out of here right now  
  
THIS LIFELIKE DREAM AINT FOR ME!
