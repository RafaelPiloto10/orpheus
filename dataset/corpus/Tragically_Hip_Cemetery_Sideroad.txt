I had heart, but I used to be older  
I'm not like I used to be had you,  
But I guess it's all over you talk,  
But you're not like me  
  
You talk and you talk like some weird saint  
What do you think that we could taint?  
When you're nothing I am and I'm something you ain't  
  
Hold me, until the night makes colder  
Tell me, how life's made you bad kick  
When I choke and I smolder  
When I'm not what you had  
  
I'm looking for a cemetery side road  
I'm screaming like a lighthouse lamp  
I'm chasing after what I think that I'm owed  
Like a french foreign legion tramp  
  
You swim in an ocean that's storming  
You eat when the wolves all do  
You ache like a mother in mourning  
When you're left along with you
