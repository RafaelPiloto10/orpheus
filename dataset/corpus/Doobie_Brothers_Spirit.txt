And when you're faced with the wise man's road  
You gotta know where to go

Leadin' the way for his journey  
East and west, wherever you go, mm  
Leadin' the way  
The first to come  
Showin' the way for his children  
Now it's up to you  
Do you know you're pullin' through  
Man, it's not easy and you know it  
Children in a happy place  
They're always smiling

Jumpin' and playin' in the middle of the afternoon
