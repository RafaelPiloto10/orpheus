There ain't no reason why you let me wait  
Just give me up and i will go  
Let's set it straight  
Got a right to who i am  
And if i don't fit your plan then set me free  
  
But you refuse to set me free  
And you deny me of my needs  
You have me under lock and key  
Just set me free just set me free  
  
You never cared for what i had to say  
It's just because you got to have it all your way  
Well i ain't no superman  
  
If that's what you demand then set me free  
Couldn't you please just set me free  
You get your fun just hurting me  
If this is how it's going to be  
Just set me free just set me free  
  
Now i deserve to be as mad as hell because  
I just don't get it  
I place myself in your hands to fall  
But i'm not quitting (no)  
Feels like the time we spent was going to waste  
Sooner or later it's goodbye we're gonna say  
'cause you just don't give a damn  
So go find some other man and set me free  
  
Just don't refuse to set me free  
You can't deny me of my needs  
Just turn your head to hear my plea  
Just set me free just set me free  
  
Couldn't you please just set me free  
You get your fun just hurting me  
If this is how it's going to be  
Just set me free just set me free
