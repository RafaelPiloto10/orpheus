Cryin' on the corner, waitin' in the rain  
I swear I'll never, ever wait again  
You gave me your word but words for you are lies  
  
Darlin' in my wildest dreams, I never thought I'd go  
But it's time to let you know, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm gonna harden my heart  
I'm gonna swallow my tears  
I'm gonna turn and leave you here  
  
All of my life I've been waitin' in the rain  
I've been waiting for a feeling that never, ever came  
It feels so close, but always disappears  
  
Darlin', in your wildest dreams, you never had a clue  
But it's time you got the news  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm gonna harden my heart  
I'm gonna swallow my tears  
I'm gonna harden my heart  
I'm gonna swallow my tears  
Harden my heart, harden my heart  
swallow my tears  
I'm gonna harden my heart
