I've been slavin' my mind just to try to find a way out  
And it's been on my brain just to put the blame on you  
I've gotta find a way just to make my day a useful one  
Cause I'm a front row ticket to a nothin' show  
I've got one free pass just to let me know  
Hey babe it's a stagnant time  
But it takes more than that to hang my coat and hat and sleep  
I've gotta sweat once more till my bones feel sore  
I tell you why  
Cause I'm a front row ticket to a nothin' show  
I've gotta crash this prison and not let go  
My heart's on a sun cloud screamin' for progress  
'Cause I want work  
I'll keep slavin' my mind just to try to find some kind of light  
I'm gonna burn this damn ticket and think of tomorrow  
And I won't live this long life in stagnation no more  
My heart's on a sun cloud screamin' for progress  
Cause I'm a man  
And man's gotta work
