Mirrored in your face  
Is a look that says it all  
  
Boy I'm slow  
I've been uncertain  
Just couldn't be sure  
Now I know  
  
You say it's over  
But just how long have you known  
(You better go now)  
But as you leave me  
  
Shoot to disable  
Shoot to disable  
  
Maybe I got careless  
Maybe it's true I ran too fast  
But on recollection it didn't do much  
So I pass  
  
You're such a hard man  
Why can't you take steady aim  
(Just get it over with)  
Don't fool around now  
  
Shoot to disable  
Shoot to disable  
  
Oh what a fool I was to love
