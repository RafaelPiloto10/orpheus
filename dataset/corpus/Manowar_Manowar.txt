We met on English ground  
in a backstage room  
We heard the sound  
And we all knew what we had to do  
  
We called the high command  
Requested leave to make a stand  
And in the field we grew  
And we all knew  
  
Soon the time would come  
For us to fight,  
Destination  
now in sight  
  
Oooh, Manowar  
Born to live forever more  
The right to conquer every shore  
Hold your ground and give no more  
  
Our fight will never end  
So we called on partisans  
To raise your hands  
And take our stand  
  
Look sharp  
when duty calls  
Where we march  
cities fall  
And the strong survive  
And take our side
