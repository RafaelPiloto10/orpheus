I'm not hungry, I eat  
When I'm tired, I can't sleep  
When I'm nervous, I speak  
It seems the only thing to do  
In the morning, I rise  
Wipe the dream from my eyes  
Contemplate your demise  
There's just no getting through  
  
Always dream, don't apologize  
Life is sweet, never close your eyes  
The truth it seems, must have passed you by  
At least a million times  
  
Gimme a sign, gimme a reason to be here  
I'm leading the blind, when will you make your motives clear  
Gimme a sign (gimme gimme, gimme a sign)  
After all this time why can't we get it right  
  
So you made me, a 'creep' (ow)  
I'm not losing any sleep (ow)  
Cause my scars are much too deep (ow)  
Don't start getting precious on me (yeah)  
  
In the morning, I rise  
While your life is, paralyzed  
In the sweet smell of disguise  
There's just no getting through to you  
  
Always dream, don't apologize  
Life is sweet, never close your eyes  
The truth it seems must have passed you by  
At least a million times  
  
Gimme a sign, gimme a reason to be here  
I'm out of my mind, so shallow and always insincere  
Gimme a sign (gimme gimme, gimme a sign)  
After all this time why can't we get it right  
  
Hey!  
  
(gimme gimme gimme a sign)  
Gimme gimme gimme yeah!  
(gimme gimme gimme a sign)  
Gimme gimme gimme yeah, yeah, yeah  
(gimme gimme gimme a sign)  
After all this time why can't we get it right  
  
Another drive by love affair  
Why don't you tell someone who cares  
If you care  
  
Gimme a sign, gimme a reason to be here  
I'm out of my mind, when will you make your motives clear  
Gimme a sign (gimme gimme gimme a sign)  
After all this time why can't we get it right  
  
(gimme a sign)  
(gimme gimme gimme a sign)  
Gimme gimme yeah yeah  
(I'm out of my mind, gimme gimme gimme a sign)  
Gimme gimme gimme yeah  
(gimme a sign)  
(gimme gimme gimme a sign)  
  
After all this love why can't we get it right  
Let's get it right
