Lay that pistol down, babe  
Lay that pistol down  
Pistol packing mama  
Lay that pistol down  
  
Oh, drinking beer in a cabaret  
Was I having fun  
Until one night she caught me right  
And now I'm on the run  
  
Oh, lay that pistol down, babe  
Lay that pistol down  
Pistol packing mama  
Lay that pistol down  
  
Oh, I'll sing you every night Bing  
And I'll woo you every day  
I'll be your regular mama  
And I'll put that gun away  
  
Oh, lay that pistol down, babe  
Lay that pistol down  
Pistol packing mama  
Lay that thing down before it goes off and hurts somebody  
  
oh, she kicked out my windshield  
And she hit me over the head  
She cussed and cried and said I lied  
And she wished that I was dead  
  
Oh, lay that pistol down, babe  
Lay that pistol down  
Pistol packing mama  
Lay that pistol down  
  
We're three tough gals  
From deep down Texas way  
We got no pals  
They don't like the way we play  
We're a rough rooting tooting shooting trio  
But you ought to see my sister Cleo  
She's a terror make no error  
But there ain't no nicer terror  
Here's what we tell her  
  
Lay that pistol down, babe  
Lay that pistol down  
Pistol packing mama  
Lay that pistol down  
  
Pappy made a batch of corn  
The revenuers came  
The drought was slow  
So now they know  
You can't do that to Mame  
  
Lay that pistol down, babe  
Lay that pistol down  
Pistol packing mama  
Lay that pistol down  
  
Oh, singing songs in a cabaret  
Was I having fun  
Until one night it didn't seem right  
And now I'm on the run  
  
Oh, lay that pistol down, babe  
Lay that pistol down  
Pistol packing mama  
Lay that pistol down  
  
Oh, pistol packing mama  
Lay that pistol down
