Sometimes there's no tomorrow  
Sometimes you hate the day  
You feel there may be something  
That intends to screw with fate  
  
Take a look at what surround you  
Each time you watch the news  
Your mind gets set by someone's will  
A template you can't choose  
  
Love and desire, dry ice or fire  
Don't you just want to flee their magic spell  
  
No mercy for the nations two people are at war  
Beliefs divide the dream they share of peace and harmony  
Their eyes look up to heaven, address our god in prayers  
Their souls exposed, they may decease by emperor's decree  
  
Look, how they're crying  
There's no denying  
Now change the channel you're remote control  
And the tune goes on eternally  
  
For those who share the fear  
On a frequency for you and me  
You stare but you can't see  
You hear and you agree  
  
We're all here for a reason  
So we can't just hang around  
There's so much left to see and learn  
Make way for common ground  
  
And those who head the wrong way  
Will rate as minor class  
As castaways they'll render fools  
When the horsemen come to rule  
  
Strike the last hour in their glass towers  
Infinite lust has made the curtain fall  
  
And the tune goes on eternally  
For those who share the fear  
On a frequency for you and me  
You stare but you can't see  
You hear but you agree  
You agree  
  
And the tune goes on eternally  
For those who share the fear  
On a frequency for you and me  
You stare but you can't see  
You hear but you agree  
  
And the tune goes on eternally  
For those who long to hear  
And those freaks sense they're superior  
We're hypnotised, you see  
They wave and we agree
