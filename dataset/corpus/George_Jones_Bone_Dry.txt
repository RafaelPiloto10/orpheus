Baby wants me to go cold turkey bone dry  
No Jack Daniels no Jim Beam whiskey bone dry  
No stoppin' after work for a beer with the guys  
Nothin' in the mornin' to open my eyes  
Well I'm comin' down from a permanent high bone dry  
  
I got my doubts if I can make it a bone dry  
It's a crazy world I don't know if I can take it a bone dry  
It's only been an hour I'm startin' to shake  
Sixty more minutes and I know I'll break  
How much more of this hell can I take bone dry  
  
Well bone dry boy am I dry as a bone  
How'd I ever say I'd ever leave it alone  
Break down shake down layin' in bed  
Covers are soaked and I'm damn near dead and I'm bone dry  
  
Baby took a look at her cold turkey bone dry  
I tried to smile but my mouth wasn't working I was bone dry  
This is one promise that I'm gonna keep  
Unless I get lucky and die in my sleep  
One way or the other I'm gonna be bone dry  
  
Well bone dry why am I dry as a bone  
Bone dry bone dry bone dry
