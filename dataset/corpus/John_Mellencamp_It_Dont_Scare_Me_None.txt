Well, it don't scare me none,  
I've been there before,  
Sideswiped an old Oak tree  
In a rusted-out old Ford.  
Shot at guys who were shootin' back  
In the Second World War,  
And it don't scare me none  
I've been there before.  
  
Well I fell in love with a woman  
Who did not love me back,  
Bare-handled rattle snakes  
And threw 'em in a sack,  
Honkey tonked with strangers  
Who were eating broken glass,  
Well, it don't scare me none  
'Cause I'll be comin' back.  
  
I take from my loved ones  
To gamble on my friends,  
I take the long way home  
And the fun never ends,  
Woke up blurry-eyed  
Wonderin' where I've been,  
I've wrestled with my conscience,  
But my conscience never wins.  
  
No you don't scare me none,  
I've been there before  
Sideswiped an old Oak tree  
In a rusted-out old Ford.  
Shot at guys who were shooting back  
In the Second World War,  
And it don't scare me none  
I've been there before.  
  
Well, the preacher man, he told me  
I'd better change my ways,  
Put a lid on the boilin' pot  
Or there'd be Hell to pay,  
Hell ain't no place  
For a guy to jump the track,  
But it don't scare me none  
'Cause man, I'm coming back.  
  
Well it don't scare me none,  
I've been there before,  
Sideswiped an old Oak tree  
In a rusted-out old Ford.  
Shot at guys who were shooting back  
In the Second World War,  
And it don't scare me none,  
'Cause I've been there before.
