La Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da.... Hey Yeh...Oh  
Your Body's Warm, But You're Still Unsure  
I'll Have You Know That I Have The Perfect Cure.... Yeah  
Step In My Room And I'll Take Your Fears Away  
Put Your Trust In Me And All That I Say  
Tell Me Can We Lay- Ay eee  
  
Chorus  
  
Let's Lay Together  
Ooh Hoo Baby  
Let's Lay Together  
Tell Me Can We Lay- eee  
Let's Lay Together  
Lay Ay Ay Ay... Yeah Oh Baby  
Let's Lay Together  
Ooh... Oh Hoo Oh Hoo  
  
Heaven's To Blame For This Love Affair  
Feels Good To Know Love Will Always Be There...Baby  
You Took My Heart And Made Such A Sexual Burning Flame  
Let's Love Tonight, Straight Into The Day  
Can We Lay  
  
Chorus To Fade
