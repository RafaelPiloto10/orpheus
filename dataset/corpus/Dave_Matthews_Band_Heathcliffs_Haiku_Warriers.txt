I won't be so what will we wait  
And our reasons sew away  
Then we crawl out of our holes into the open air  
Take us so long we cried away  
In corners they may feel  
But oh no what I see  
But I know it's not fair  
Baby say you love me  
And don't leave her waiting  
By the any one word  
You call me up and say a lie  
So child take'em I call to come again  
And now I'm watching you  
Why and it's all into the old way back  
We swing our hands and hope  
That everyone comes back  
I don't believe you're saying  
I don't believe what you're doing here  
Tell me good intentions  
And what you hang from your tree  
I don't believe what you said  
But walkin by my door  
I find all these smilin' faces  
Locked up and tied  
Oh the rhythm, an old song I heard  
Wild and afraid I'll sail away again  
Memories fall  
Hey we feel so cold  
I really thought it was cool winter day  
Not to buy  
We buy the air down the wall  
Say this one time  
We all, they could do it for a week or more  
Then they wait and buy it  
I don't care no matter what  
I will mend me one too  
Pour the soul out in an open page  
Crushed by our memories  
So my happiness fell away  
And tore my mind and darkness fell here
