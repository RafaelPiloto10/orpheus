I played the part  
I played the start  
I made a table out of clay  
I placed my hands upon the plans  
I waited for a proud display  
I played around  
I heard the sound of certain trouble on the way  
  
I got bulldog skin  
  
I took a car  
I drove it far  
I dug the quality of steel  
I crashed my nerve  
I made it swerve  
I made it back - was no big deal  
I tasted blood  
A date with scud  
And now I don't know how to feel  
  
I got bulldog skin  
(Spark from the master)
