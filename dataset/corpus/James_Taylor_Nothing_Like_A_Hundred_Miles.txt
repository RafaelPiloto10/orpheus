I have tried to forget about you and all the plans that we had planned.  
Yes, and I'm bound to leave this town, I don't care where I may land.  
  
If what they're telling me is true, you have found somebody new to love you.  
There ain't but one thing I can do, baby,  
To save my heart from being broken in two by you, baby, I'm moving through.  
  
There's nothing like a hundred miles between me and trouble in my mind.  
There's nothing like a hundred miles, show me the yellow line.  
There's nothing like a hundred miles when I'm only passing through.  
There's nothing like a hundred miles to make me forget about you, forget about
you.  
  
Now don't we like our found farewells.  
And don't we like to keep our good-byes nice and clean.  
You may wish I'd go to hell while you tell me what a pleasure it's been,  
So long, baby, I'm moving on.  
  
There's nothing like a hundred miles between me and trouble in mind.  
There's nothing like a hundred miles, show me the yellow line.  
There's nothing like a hundred miles when I'm only passing through.  
There's nothing like a hundred miles to make me forget about you, forget about
you.  
  
I have tried to forget about you. And baby, I have failed.  
But just as long as I stay in Houston, I will.
