Little White House in a little old town  
Stuck in the middle of nowhere  
Stars shine bright when the sun goes down  
It's a perfect world as long as you're there  
  
[Chorus]  
Count my blessings and save my prayers  
Love waking up in the morning  
Sunlight shining upon your hair  
And you're lying next to me  
  
Blue sky over fields of green  
I'm as happy as I've ever been  
One thing makes it all so clear  
It's a perfect world as long as you're there  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
And it's where I want to be  
  
Don't want to live near the lights of the city  
I like it right where I am  
Just to be part of a woman in love  
With the heart of a simple man  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
And it's where I want to be.  
  
Ohoo... When you're next to me  
I'm exactly where I want to be [Repeat: x 5]
