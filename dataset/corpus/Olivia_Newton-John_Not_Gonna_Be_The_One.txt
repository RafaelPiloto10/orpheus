Here we are in a room full of broken hearts  
Lovers once, but in the end, we never really had a chance  
You wanted to be free, now that you're lonely, you want me back again  
  
But I'm not gonna be the one that you call  
Not gonna take the fall, for all your indecision  
Not gonna put my back to the wall  
Not gonna take the fall, for all the pain you've given  
  
Me and you, we were a dream that never could come true  
In time you'll see, that our love was never really meant to be  
And if you discover, you need a lover, someone to break your fall  
  
But I'm not gonna be the one that you call  
Not gonna take the fall, for all your indecision  
Not gonna put my back to the wall  
Not gonna take the fall, for all the pain you've given  
  
You wanted to be free, now that you're lonely, you want me at your arm  
  
But I'm not gonna be the one that you call  
Not gonna take the fall, for all your indecision  
Not gonna put my back to the wall  
Not gonna take the fall, for all the pain you've given
