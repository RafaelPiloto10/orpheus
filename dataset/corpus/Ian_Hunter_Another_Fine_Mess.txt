Well, you rang me up you say you wanna get high  
Now I'm underpaid and I'm overtired  
Riding shotgun 'round the world  
I'm too young to die, too old for the girls  
You wanna know something, I've had it with you  
Another fine mess you got me into  
Well, you're always in one hole or another  
And I come runnin' just like a brother  
When are you ever going to get yourself cleared  
You'll keep on running 'til we disappear  
I can't believe the things you do  
Another mess you got me into  
Another fine mess, another fine mess, another fine mess  
Well, that's what you get when you settle for less  
Another fine mess yeah, another fine mess  
Look on the bright side, smile, smile, smile  
Relive our childhood just for a little while  
Can't you see it's catching it up on you? Hit me, Darrell  
Well, that's another mess you got me into  
How many more times are you gonna get pissed?  
How many more asses have we gotta kiss?  
How many more songs have I gotta write?  
How many more sessions into the night?  
For some dumb fuck who don't got a clue  
Another fine mess you got me into  
Well you say I'm kicking up too much fuss  
Twenty-four hours is too long on the bus  
The band's all moan and the driver's slow  
There's not enough people, too many shows  
Down in the bus with the birthday blues  
Another fine mess you got me into  
Another fine mess, another fine mess, another fine mess  
Well, that's what you get when you settle for less  
Another fine mess, another fine mess  
Oh, I said another fine mess, another fine mess, ohh  
I said another fine mess, another fine mess  
Another fine mess, another fine mess  
Another fine, another fine, another fine, another fine  
Another fine, another fine, another fine mess
