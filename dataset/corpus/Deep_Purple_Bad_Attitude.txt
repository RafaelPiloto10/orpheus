Take a look at  
These dirty hands  
Take a look at this face these blazing eyes  
Do you see me as a broken man  
Tell me  
Are you really that blind  
  
You got yourself a load of trouble now  
You got yourself a bad deal  
You say I've got a bad attitude  
How d'you think I feel  
  
You got me locked in a paper cage  
You think I'm chained up but I'm just tied down  
Step aside get out of my way  
I won't hurt you I had enough being pushed around  
  
You got yourself a load of trouble now  
You got yourself a bad deal  
You say I've got a bad attitude  
How d'you think I feel  
  
Don't want a number  
I got a name  
Take a look at my face  
Talk about a bad attitude  
Things have got to change
