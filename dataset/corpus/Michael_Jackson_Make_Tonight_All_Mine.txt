Oh baby, now, I've been watchin' you, girl  
When you dance, you steal the show  
Just like you stole my heart  
When the lights were low  
All the guys are waiting  
Pleading just to hold you tight  
Oh, darling, no, no, no please not tonight  
  
'Cause now you're in my arms, girl  
You thrill my soul  
C'mon, hold me close  
Rock me slow  
Baby, never let me go  
  
[CHORUS]  
Oh, baby, make tonight all mine  
I can make you happy  
Just gimme a try  
Oh, I've waited such a long, long time  
Make tonight all mine  
(Baby, I...)  
Can satisfy you  
Gonna 'lectrify you  
C'mon, let me prove it  
Show you I can do it  
  
I've been walkin' like a shadow  
Right behind you, by myself  
While you've been walking home  
With someone else  
Don't you know it hurts me  
Seeing you with other guys  
Oh, darling, no, no, no please not tonight  
  
When the party's over, let me walk you home  
I'll hold you close  
Rock you slow  
Never, never let you go  
  
Oh, baby, make tonight all mine  
I can make you happy  
Just gimme a try  
Oh, I've waited such a long, long time  
Make tonight all mine  
(Baby, I...)  
Oh, all, all mine, mine, mine, mine, yeah  
  
Oh, baby, make tonight all mine  
I can make you happy, yeah  
Oh, I've waited such a long, long time  
Make tonight all mine  
(Baby, I...)  
Hey, what you say, girl?  
Can we slip away, girl?  
I want to get into you  
Let me do it to you, oh  
  
(Oh, baby, make tonight all mine)  
(Oh, I've waited such a long, long time)  
(Baby, I...)
