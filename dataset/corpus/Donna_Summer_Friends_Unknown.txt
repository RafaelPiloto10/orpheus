I'm writing you this song  
'Cause I've always wanted to let you know  
That no matter where you go  
My love is with you  
Long after the curtain falls  
It's you I hear  
Breaking down the walls  
To let me know you're there  
So sincerely  
You've stood beside me  
All through the years  
Together we have grown  
My friends unknown  
Down on your knees you pray, for me  
Deep in my heart you'll stay  
Eternally  
You can turn my gray skies blue  
There's just no me without you  
For all the love you've shown  
My friends unknown  
This road may be long and winding  
But no matter where it takes me to  
I will always find my way  
Back to you  
And you should know that no matter  
where you go  
I'm always there for you  
I say a prayer for you  
And I love you  
Eternally  
And if we never, never ever meet again  
You'll always know where I stand  
I'll never be alone  
My friends unknown  
For all the love you've shown  
I wanna thank you  
My friends unknown.
