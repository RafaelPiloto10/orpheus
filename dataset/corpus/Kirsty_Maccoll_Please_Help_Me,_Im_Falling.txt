Please help me, I'm falling in love with you  
Close the door to temptation  
Don't let me walk through  
Turn away from me darling  
I'm begging you to  
Please help me, I'm falling in love with you  
  
I belong to another whose arms have grown cold  
But I promised for ever to have and to hold  
I could never be free dear  
But when I'm with you  
I know that I'm losing the will to be true  
  
Please help me, I'm falling and that would be sin  
Close the door to temptation  
Don't let me walk in  
For I mustn't want you, oh but darling I do  
Please help me, I'm falling in love with you  
Please help me, I'm falling in love with you
