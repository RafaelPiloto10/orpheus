Longing is the animal inside you when you bleed  
Suffering is critical in finding what you need  
Deliverance is evidence there's more than what you say  
Pain is there the moment that you wake up from your dreams  
  
Oh, I know you can't tithe  
Oh, when you look inside yourself  
You've got to cross that line  
Yeah, you're running out of time  
  
Loneliness is beautiful, it leads you home again  
Happiness is overrated, joy is infinite  
Liberate the hate you feel before it's permanent  
Smile when it hurts, it works like mother's medicine  
  
Oh, I know you can't tithe  
Oh, when you look inside yourself  
You've got to cross that line  
Yeah, you're running out of time  
  
You've got to learn your lesson  
To see what you've been missing  
You've got to cross that line  
  
Yeah, you've got to look inside  
Yeah, it's time that you decide  
Yeah, you've got to cross that line  
Yeah, you're running out of time
