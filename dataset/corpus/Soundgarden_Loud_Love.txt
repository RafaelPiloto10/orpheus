There's no time to keep it low  
I've been deaf now I want noise  
You stay down  
But I won't be quiet  
I'll hammer on until you fight  
  
Loud Love  
Loud Love  
Loud Love  
Loud Love  
  
If you've got some time to kill  
Slow resistance wins the war  
Well I know  
But that's no way to go  
You can't resist the louder pull  
  
Well that's right  
I want something to explode  
I've been deaf  
Now I want noise
