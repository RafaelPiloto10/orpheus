You hide your eyes  
But the ugly truth  
Just loves to give it away  
You gave yourself  
  
If you were mine to give  
I might throw it away  
You share but money can't give  
What the truth takes away  
Throw it away  
  
I painted my eyes  
Ugly isn't what I want to see  
I painted my mind  
Ugly isn't what I want to be  
  
I don't mind but the truth  
Don't look that good on me  
Throw it away  
  
I don't think I really  
Understand you  
And I can't see why  
I'd ever want to  
  
And even if it isn't mine to say  
I'll say it anyway  
It's ugly  
  
If you were mine to give  
I might throw it away  
But money can't give  
What the truth takes away  
Throw it away
