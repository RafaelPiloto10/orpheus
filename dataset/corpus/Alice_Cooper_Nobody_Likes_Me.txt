Nobody likes me  
It's all my fault  
Nobody likes me  
Nobody likes me  
  
Oh yes we all like you  
We like you a lot  
Yes we all like you  
Yes we all like you  
  
I never get a letter  
We have no time  
Never ever get a call from you  
We have no dime  
  
Oh yes you do  
Oh no we don't  
Oh no we don't  
Oh yes you do  
Oh no we don't  
Yes! No! Yes! No!  
  
Never call, never write  
Yes I do always try  
Make me cry all the night  
Sorry I made you cry  
Make me sad, Make me mad  
Tell me true, what can I do?  
Way too late can't can't make up  
All the hate has built up  
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ah  
  
Right we all like you  
We like you a lot  
We like all your family  
We like your dog Spot  
Even Spot?  
Yes
