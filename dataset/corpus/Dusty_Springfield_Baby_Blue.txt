(Ooh, ooh, baby blue)  
(What's wrong with you?)  
Ooh, yeah  
Getting back to business, baby  
Just believe in me  
Forget the things the wise men say  
That's our philosophy  
  
(I want you now)  
I've got the feeling you want me, too  
(Show you how)  
Oh, oh  
Gonna catch a shaft of light  
Shine it in your eyes  
Gonna see what's on your mind  
Before you realise  
  
(I want you now)  
I've got the feeling you want me, too  
(Show you how)  
Ooh, hoo  
  
(Ooh, baby blue)  
(What's wrong with you?)  
You got me worn out trying  
(Ooh, baby blue)  
(What can I do?)  
Why don't you let me through to you?, oh, yeah, oh  
  
If I follow my desire  
Come inside your heart  
It would be impossible  
To stop what we might start  
  
(I want you now)  
I've got the feeling you want me, too  
(Show you how), so  
  
(Ooh, baby blue)  
(What's wrong with you?)  
You got me worn out trying  
(Ooh, baby blue)  
(What can I do?)  
Why don't you let me through to you?  
  
(Ooh, ooh, baby blue)  
(What's wrong with you, baby blue?)  
(Ooh, ooh, baby blue)  
What can I do?  
  
If I follow my desire  
Come inside your heart  
It would be impossible  
To stop what we might start  
  
I want you now  
I've got the feeling you want me, too  
(Show you how, ooh)  
(Ooh, baby blue)  
(What's wrong with you?)  
You got me worn out trying  
(Ooh, baby blue)  
(What can I do?)  
Why don't you let me through to you?  
Ooh, baby blue  
(What's wrong with you?)  
You got me worn out trying  
(Ooh, baby blue)  
(What can I do?)  
Why don't you try to let me through to you?  
(Ooh, baby blue)  
Oh, baby blue  
(What's wrong with you?)  
You got me worn out trying  
(Ooh, baby blue)  
(What can I do?)  
Oh, baby blue
