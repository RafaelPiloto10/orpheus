Everybody listen to me  
And return me my ship  
I'm your captain  
I'm your captain  
Though I'm feeling mighty sick  
  
I've been lost now for days uncounted  
And it's months since I've seen home  
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?  
Or am I all alone?  
  
If you return me to my home port  
I will kiss you Mother Earth  
Take me back now  
Take me back now  
To the port of my birth  
  
Am I in my cabin dreaming?  
Or are you really scheming  
To take my ship away from me?  
You'd better think about it  
I just can't live without it  
So please don't take my ship from me  
  
I can feel the hand of a stranger  
And it's tightening around my throat  
Heaven help me  
Heaven help me  
Take this stranger from my boat  
I'm your captain  
I'm your captain  
Though I'm feeling mighty sick  
Everybody listen to me  
And return me my ship  
I'm your captain  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
I'm your captain  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
I'm your captain  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
I'm your captain  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...  
  
I'm getting closer to my home  
I'm getting closer to my home  
I'm getting closer to my home
