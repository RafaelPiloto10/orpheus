I'm calling out tonight.  
I wanna feel his might  
And I won't be quiet.  
  
Cause I've seen the truth  
Wanna fight for you.  
And we just can't buy it.  
  
This is your life.  
Are you gonna stand by.  
And take  
  
One last look at Eden.  
Just stop believing and walk away.  
This could be our moment.  
Time that we own it.  
I wanna hear you say  
Come with me.  
  
Are you still not there.  
The ones who really care.  
Who's open minded.  
  
This is your life.  
Are you gonna stand by  
And take  
  
One last look at Eden.  
Just stop believing  
And walk away.  
  
This could be our moment.  
Time that we own it.  
I wanna hear you say  
Come with me.  
  
One last look at Eden.  
Just stop believing  
And walk away.  
  
This could be our moment.  
Time that we own it.  
I wanna hear you say  
To night  
Come with me.
