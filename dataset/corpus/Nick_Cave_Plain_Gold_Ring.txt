Plain gold ring on her finger she wore  
It was where everyone could see  
It belonged to someone, but not me  
On her hand she wore a plain gold ring  
  
  
Plain gold ring's got a story to tell  
It was one that I knew very well  
In my heart it will never be spring  
Long as she wears that plain gold ring  
  
  
When night time comes calling on me  
I know why I will never be free  
I can't stop these teardrops of mine, oh no  
I'm gonna love her till the end of time  
  
  
Plain gold ring's got but one thing to say  
I'm gonna love her till my dying day  
In my heart it will never be spring  
Long as she wears that plain gold ring
