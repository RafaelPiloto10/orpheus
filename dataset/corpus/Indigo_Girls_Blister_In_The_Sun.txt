When I'm out walking  
I strut my stuff  
And I'm so strung out  
  
I'm high as a kite  
And I just might  
Stop to check you out  
  
Let me go on  
Like a blister in the sun  
Let me go on  
Big hands I know your the one  
  
Body and beats  
I stain my sheets  
I don't even know why  
  
My girlfriend  
Shes at the end  
She is starting to cry  
  
Let me go on  
Like a blister in the sun  
Let me go on  
Yeah big hands I know your the one  
  
When I'm out walking  
I strut my stuff  
And I'm so strung out  
  
And I'm high as a kite  
I just might  
Stop to check you out  
  
High as a kite  
I just might  
Stop to check you out  
  
Body and beats  
I stain my sheets  
I don't even know why  
  
My girlfriend  
Shes at the end  
She is starting to cry  
  
When I'm out walking  
I strut my stuff  
And I'm so strung out  
  
I'm high as a kite  
I just might  
Stop to check you out  
  
Let me go on  
Like a blister in the sun  
Let me go on  
Big hands I know your the one
