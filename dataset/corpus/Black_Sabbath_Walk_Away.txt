Lord she's handsome as she flows across the floor  
Nothing I've seen in my life has ever pleased me more  
She's got the look of freedom, and it makes you think she's wild  
But I can see right through it all, it's the way to have a child  
  
Oh, walk away  
She's looking to love you  
There's nothing to say  
Just turn your head and walk away  
Walk away, walk on  
  
She moves in sunlight, never seen the night at all  
Like a star in the midnight sky, burns before it falls  
I've never been lonely, and I can't imagine why  
Maybe she could be the one to tell me, I guess it's do or die  
  
Can't see her fire  
But I can feel her heat, all right!  
It's rising higher  
I'm walking the wire  
  
Walk on by!  
  
Oh! Walk away!  
She's looking to love you  
There's nothing to say  
Just turn your head and walk away  
Oh, walk on by, walk away!  
Walk on!  
  
You'll feel her fire, she'll lift you higher  
But don't be fooled! just turn your head and walk away!
