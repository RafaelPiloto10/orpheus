When I was waiting for your phone call  
The one that never came  
Like a man about to burst  
I was dying of thirst  
  
Though I will never fade  
Or get lost in this daze  
Though I will disappear  
Into the street parade  
  
It's not too hard to cry  
In these crying times  
I'll take a broken heart  
And take it home in parts  
But I will never fade  
  
I was in this place  
By the first church of the city  
I saw tears on the face  
The face of a visionary  
  
Though I will disappear  
To join the street parade  
Disappear and fade  
Into the street parade
