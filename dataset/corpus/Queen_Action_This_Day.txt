Action  
  
This street honey is a mean street  
Living in this street honey needs a mean streak  
We've got criminals living in this street  
But there's a heart beat pulse  
That keeps on pumping  
Like a juke box playing the same dead record  
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring  
I got a feeling this world is using me  
  
This town honey is a dead town  
Living in this town honey is a let down  
Coming to this town honey is a show down  
But there's a heart beat pulse  
That keeps on pumping some sunshine ray  
Through a crack in the shutter  
Or a sight of a light at the end of a tunnel  
Still there's a feeling this world is using me  
  
Action this day action this night  
Oh we've gotta learn to love to live  
You can't say it ain't right  
Action this day action this night  
Oh you've got the power you've got the power  
You've got the power to love to live  
You can't say it ain't right  
  
Your mind honey is a bleak place  
Living in your minds living in a blank space  
Your mind is coming from a rat race  
But there's a heart beat pulse  
That keeps on pumping  
Like a jukebox playing the same dead record  
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring  
I got a feeling that just won't quit  
This world is using me  
  
Action this day action this night  
Oh we've gotta learn to love to live  
We can't say it ain't right  
Action this day action this night  
Oh you've got the power you've got the power  
You've got the power to love to live  
You can't say it ain't right  
  
Action action this day  
Action this day  
Action action this day  
Action this day  
Living in the street  
Action
