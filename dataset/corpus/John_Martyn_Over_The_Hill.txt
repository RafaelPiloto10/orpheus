I'm going away to leave you, I'm going to leave you in disgrace  
Nothing in my favor, got the wind in my face  
I'm going home, hey, hey, hey, over the hill  
Over the hill, hey, hey, hey, over the hill  
Can't get enough of sweet cocaine, get enough of Mary Jane  
Going back to where I come from, going rolling back home again  
Over the hill, hey, hey, hey, over the hill  
Over the hill, hey, hey, hey, over the hill  
Been worried about my babies, been worried about my wife  
Just one place for a man to be when he's worried about his life  
I'm going home, hey, hey, hey, over the hill  
Over the hill, hey, hey, hey, over the hill  
Well, I'm going away to leave you, I'm going to leave you in disgrace  
Got nothing in my favor, rain in my face  
I'm going home, hey, hey, hey, over the hill  
Over the hill, hey, hey, hey, over the hill  
Over the hill, hey, hey, hey, over the hill  
Over the hill, hey, hey, hey, over the hill
