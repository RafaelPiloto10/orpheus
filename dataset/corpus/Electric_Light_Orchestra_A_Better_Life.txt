Hush little baby, don't you cry  
Oh-oh, don't you cry  
Maybe tomorrow's, a better life  
Oh-oh, if you try  
  
Rain is falling all around  
Storm came, it brings you down  
But if you lose your mind  
Weatherman, in his overcoat  
  
Look up in the sky now, the weatherman cry now  
Oh-oh, the window pane  
Damp in the valley, up in the alley  
Oh-oh, it's pouring rain  
  
Rain is falling all around  
Storm came, it brings you down  
So let your mind roll on  
Weatherman, dry's the lonely tears  
  
Early in the morning, while the sun's still yawning  
Oh-oh, smiles on you  
Maybe today is, a better life  
Oh-oh, if we try  
  
Sun is shining all around  
It warms your heart and melts the cloud  
But if your mind can see  
Weatherman, smiles a lonely smile
