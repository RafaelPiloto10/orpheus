It's three o'clock in the morning  
And the rain begin to fall  
But I know what I'm needin  
But I don't have it all.  
I'm needin someone like you  
That I just want to do love to.  
Baby, baby, I need you tonight.  
  
Outside my window  
It's lonely and cold.  
Inside my heart there's a fire  
Burning out of control.  
Burning for someone like you  
I just want to do love to.  
Baby, baby, I need you tonight.  
  
Your love's coming to me  
Like a wolf howling at the moon  
But that just doesn't do me  
If I can't get you soon.  
I'm calling for someone like you  
That I just want to do love to.  
Baby, baby, I need you tonight.
