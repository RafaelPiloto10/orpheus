Georgia I love your big magnolia trees Texas I love to feel the prairie breeze  
Tennessee you made me what I am today but it's got to be Kentucky for me  
She loves me and she knows where I am Kentucky you are my motherland  
Say hello to the rivers and the trees oh it's got to be Kentucky for me  
[ guitar ]  
New York that's a fine place to go Colorado my it's pretty covered with the
snow  
California sunshine just brings me to my knees oh but it's got to be Kentucky
for me  
My flesh and my blood is buried there I believe that Jesus blessed the briar  
Big world I have seen your majesty but it's got to be Kentucky for me  
Oh it's got to be Kentucky for me
