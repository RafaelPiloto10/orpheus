If I'm high on a hill  
She'd still been looking down at me  
What does she see that brings her closer every day to my heart  
If I'm away from home  
And think I'm all alone  
She's there, somewhere  
I look around to see  
And looking back at me  
She's there, beware!  
  
Creeping like a hungry cat  
Seen it before  
I know it can mean that  
  
The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck  
The lady starstruck, running after me  
The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck, yeah  
  
I could fly to the moon  
But she'd soon find a way to be there  
I never knew for a while that a smile made 'em really care  
  
She wants a souvenir  
To everyone it's clear  
She's hooked, with one look  
She wants a photograph  
And everybody laughs but not me 'cause I see  
  
She's creeping like a hungry cat  
I've seen it before  
I know I can mean that  
  
The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck  
The lady starstruck, running after me  
The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck,oh  
Oh my  
The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck  
The lady starstruck, running after me, yeah  
The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck, yeah  
  
It used to be a game  
Now I can't repeat my name at all  
She seems to believe that  
I never can refuse a call  
  
She wants a souvenir  
To everyone it's clear  
She's hooked! With one look!  
She wants a photograph  
And everybody laughs, hah!  
But not me 'cause I see  
  
She's creeping like a hungry cat  
I've seen it before  
I know it can mean that  
  
The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck  
The lady starstruck, running after me  
The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck, bad luck  
The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck  
  
The lady starstruck running after me  
The lady starstruck, she's nothing but bad luck  
Bad luck, bad luck, bad luck  
And back of a tree, looking back at me  
Climbing up my stair  
I've just got to beware  
Lady starstruck, yes, she's bad luck, bad luck
