You know I've had some lonely days.  
I've made mistakes and had to pay.  
I've had some friends that walked away  
Just like momma told me.  
But there's someone whose love is real.  
Who cares about the way feel.  
Every pain and erased every stain.  
There's peace when I call out your name.  
  
Jesus your my everything, the cross you did that just for me.  
So whatever you take me through, I promise you, I'll spend my always with you.  
No one can touch my heart like you, or make me smile the way you dooo,  
I finally found someone who, who really truly loves me.  
  
And when my strength has come and gone, your life in me it makes me strong.  
Your hand is where my heart belongs.  
You took all my pain and erase every stain.  
  
[Chorus]  
Jesus your my everything, the cross you did that just for me.  
So whatever you take me through, I promise you, I'll spend my always with you.  
Jesus my whole life has changed, since that day I cried Your name.  
  
For every time You brought me through,  
I promise You, I'll spend my always with You.  
  
[Chorus: x2]
