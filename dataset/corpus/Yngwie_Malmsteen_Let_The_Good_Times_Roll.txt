I'm casting pearls before the swine.  
I think I must be losing my mind.  
You tried to leave me high and dry.  
Yes you nearly left me to die.  
Sticks and stones may break my bones.  
But your words, they never hit home.  
Time to say good-bye to all the pain.  
And chase away the rain.  
Now there is wind in my sails.  
And I cannot fail.  
Let the good times roll.  
Let the good times roll.  
I'm a soldier and I will fight.  
On through the darkness and into the light.  
Now the ace is up my sleeve.  
It's so good it's hard to believe.  
I will take the journey to the end.  
Until there is nothing left for you to defend.  
Now the tables are being turned.  
And it's time for you to burn.  
Now there is wind in my sails.  
And I cannot fail.  
Let the good times roll.  
Let the good times roll.  
[guitar solo]  
Let the good times roll.  
Let the good times roll.  
Let the good times roll
