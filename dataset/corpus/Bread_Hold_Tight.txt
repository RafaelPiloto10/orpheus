Hold tight  
I want to dance with you this whole night  
I hope the music never slows up  
I hope this place don't never close up  
  
Hold tight  
Cause you're the only one who feels right  
Girl I know it's now or never  
I want to dance with you forever  
  
So hold on tight, never let me go, baby  
Cause I can feel the rhythm of your love  
And when you get yourself in motion  
Girl it's tearing my emotions right in two  
  
Hold tight  
And we will dance into the moonlight  
All the stars they will surround us  
We will be so glad we found us  
  
So hold on tight, never let me go, baby  
Cause I can feel the rhythm of your love  
And when you get yourself in motion  
I get loving notions all for you, yes I do  
  
Hold tight  
And we will dance into the moonlight  
I hope the music never slows up  
I hope tomorrow never shows up
