Lying and cheating  
Taking all I can get  
Always wanting more  
It's time to even the score  
  
Winners and losers  
Always come and go  
As soon as I get it  
I gotta let it go  
  
I can hear you say  
I can hear you say!  
  
Ladies of the night  
Give me what you've got  
I ain't looking for love  
Just want some action!  
  
We're headed for a life of crime  
Keep running till the day we die  
We're headed for a life of crime  
But it's too late now  
We've already crossed the line!  
  
This nowhere train you're riding  
Is going nowhere fast  
You better watch your step  
Or you're gonna burn in hell!  
  
I can hear them say  
I can hear them say!  
  
We're headed for a life of crime  
Keep running till the day we die  
We're headed for a life of crime  
But it's too late now  
We've already crossed the line!
