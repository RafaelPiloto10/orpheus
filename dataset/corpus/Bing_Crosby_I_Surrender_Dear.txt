We've played the game of 'stay away'  
But it costs more than I can pay  
Without you I can't make my way  
I surrender, dear  
  
Little mean things we were doin'  
Must have been part of the game  
Lending a spice to the wound  
Oh, but I don't care who's to blame  
  
When stars appear and shadows fall  
Why then you'll hear my poor heart call  
To you my love, my life, my all  
I surrender, dear  
  
Oh, to you my love, my life, my all  
I surrender, dear
