Your hair and your eyes  
I saw them in the night  
Your face, your disguise  
I felt it in the night  
Your cool clammy skin  
It could be right beside me  
I saw you swimmin' over here  
You looked so fragile  
And don't you know her eyes were red?  
Your hair and your skin  
I know my desire  
I felt akin  
To my desire  
Your eyes and your face  
I dreamed them in the night  
Your hair and your skin  
I saw them swimmin' over here  
And don't you know you're life itself?
