SHANE  
Nah nahnah nah nahh  
All around the world (2)  
Someone needs somebody  
Let it be a shield  
All around the world (2)  
Someones feeling lonely  
But I know you never will  
  
ALL  
'cause when it all gets too much  
Put your head down on my shoulder  
A little warmth when it gets colder  
Now I don't know the things that your going through  
But you can put your head down  
On my shoulder  
Where the storm is it blows ova  
I know your there for me too  
No Ill be there for you  
  
BRYAN  
Your waiting for a change  
Your waiting for the day  
When all that you remember is with you once again  
there's a long road ahead  
It stretches out for miles  
And if you want some company  
Walk with me a while  
Ohh and when the road gets too rough  
  
ALL  
Put your head down on my shoulder  
A little warmth when it gets colder  
Now I don't know the things that your going through  
But you can put your head down  
On my shoulder  
Where the storm is it blows ova  
I know your there for me too  
No Ill be there for you  
  
SHANE  
When it all..gets too..much...  
  
Chorus
