At Christmas Eve, tomorrow's near  
I hope that love will bring you here, home for a while  
I'll make the best of what's for me  
But I would love you here to be holding me now  
  
How I wish that you and I and love could be close  
'Cause the holidays are when I need you most, so  
Another year, another chance  
A different song, a different dance  
For us to try  
  
Please come home for Christmas (I don't want it this way)  
Please come home for Christmas (and stay)  
  
Good morning love, it's me again  
As Christmas day begins again, I think of you  
I know that time has passed us by  
I tell myself to stop but I still dream it's true  
  
How I dream that you and I and love could be one  
'Cause Christmas time should never be lonesome  
Remember when our love began  
You held my heart, I held you hand  
Ready to fly  
  
Please come home for Christmas (I don't want it this way)  
Please come home for Christmas (and stay)
