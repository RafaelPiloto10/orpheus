If you gave me a fresh carnation  
I would only crush it's tender petals  
With me you'll have no escape  
And at the same time there'll be nowhere to settle  
I trample down all life in my wake  
I eat it up and take the cake  
I just avert my eyes to the pain  
Of someone's loss helping my gain  
  
If you gave me a dream for my pocket  
You'd be plugging in the wrong socket  
With me there's no room for the future  
With me there's no room with a view at all  
  
I am out of season all year around  
Hear machinery roar to my empty sound  
Touch my heart and feel winter  
Hold my hand and be doomed forever  
  
If you gave me a fresh carnation  
I would only crush it's tender petals  
With me you'll have no escape  
And at the same time there'll be nowhere to settle  
And if you're wondering by now who I am  
Look no further than the mirror  
Cause I am the greed and fear  
And every ounce of hate in you
