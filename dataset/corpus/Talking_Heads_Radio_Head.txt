Baby your mind is a radio  
Got a receiver inside my head  
Baby I'm tuned to your wavelength  
Lemme tell you what it says:  
  
Transmitter!  
Oh! Picking up something good  
Hey, radio head!  
The sound...of a brand-new world.  
  
So look at my fingers vibrate  
From their tip down down to my toes  
Now I'm receiving your signal  
We're gonna leave the land of noise  
  
Transmitter!  
Oh! Picking up something good  
Hey, radio head!  
The sound...of a brand-new world.  
  
Transmitter!  
Oh! Picking up something good  
Hey, radio head!  
The sound...Of a brand-new world.  
  
Now you and I have no secrets  
Now baby, lemme read your mind  
I hear ev'rything you're thinking  
You can't help the way you sound  
  
Transmitter!  
Picking up something good.  
Hey! Radio head!  
The sound...Of a brand-new world  
Oh! Radio Head  
Radio Head  
Radio Head  
Radio Head
