Hey, hound dog man,  
Where you been now,where you been?  
I wish that you were back,  
It was too good to ever end.  
Once in a while someone like you  
Will give everything for what you wanted to do.  
  
Hey, hound dog man,  
My old friend play it again.  
  
You gave the world a whole lot of joy  
Now that ain't bad for a country boy  
I just knew you could not lose  
The way you sang rock and roll and blues.  
I still think about these things  
And the memory that it brings  
  
Hey, hound dog man,  
My old friend,play it again.  
Hey, hound dog man,  
My old friend,play it again  
  
Sometimes I think about James Dean,  
Sammy Cooke and my teenage queen.  
Doo ron, de ron, de ron,  
Marilyn Monroe and hot rod fun.  
I still think about these things  
And the memory that it brings.  
  
Hey, hound dog man,  
My old friend,play it again.  
Hey, hound dog man,  
My old friend why did it end?  
Hey, hound dog man,  
My old friend, why did it end.
