Well now baby used to stay all night long, made me cry, Lord she done me
wrong.  
Hurt my eyes open, and that's no lie, tables turnin', now it's her turn to
cry,  
Cuz I used to love her, but it's all over now.  
Well I used to wake up in the morning, get my breakfast in bed,  
When I got worried, you know she eased my achin' head,  
But now she's here and there with every man in town'  
Still tryin' to take for that same old clown.  
Cuz I used to love her, but it's all over now.  
Well she used to run around with every man in town,  
Spend all my money, Lord I better pass "go",  
Put me out, it was a pity how I cried, table's turnin', now it's her turn to
cry,  
Cuz I used to love her, but it's all over now.  
Yes and I used to love her, but it's all over now
