The Carter boys were born one and after another in a little old country place  
I was the last and the death of my mother and I know it was a pretty bad trace  
We'd get to drinking I'd do the singing and they taught me to chase girls and
cuss  
We played poker I'd do the dealing I was the only one we could trust  
And there were six of us all together and that's how we stood all the time  
Six of us all together the Carter boys were brothers of mine  
We had an old car that we kept tied together with pieces of baling wire and
hope  
Well they knew when we got there and they knew when we left  
They could tell by the noise and the smoke  
Anytime the sheriff had nothing to do he'd get out and chase us around  
The old women prayed the old men laughed and the middle aged people all
frowned  
There were six of us all together...  
Daddy was a preacher and the Lord knows he tried  
Gave us everything he could afford  
We lost a lotta battles but daddy always said the only thing we feared was the
Lord  
Well as I look back through the long lean years I wonder how we ever survived  
All of that hard work all of those women and all of those pistols and knives  
There were six of us all together...  
There were six of us all together...
