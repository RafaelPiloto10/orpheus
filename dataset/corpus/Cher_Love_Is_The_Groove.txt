In the east and in the west  
Every bird will seek its' nest  
Everyone will seek its' home  
Home is where the heart goes  
  
And the moon will rise and fall  
And the light will touch the tide  
Are we holding hands and never feeling?  
  
All around the world we sing  
Like a penny in a spin  
Always looking for the way  
To get out, to get in  
  
[Chorus]  
Love is the groove in which we move  
Love is the groove in which we move  
Love is the groove in which we move  
  
In the alleys o Monsay  
In the streets of Katmandu  
On the high roads of Peru  
People meet and touch and go  
  
But the wind of change will blow  
And another dance will start  
And I'll finally get the point  
Like an arrow to my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Look back where's the sea  
Who brought this mystery?  
Deep in another world  
Someone is listening  
  
And they as with night  
And we keep asking why  
Look back there's the key  
Deep in another life  
  
On this ship in which we sail  
Everything is possible  
Keep on turning like a star  
Till you get to where you are  
  
If I promise not to laugh  
Will you promise not to cry?  
Will you promise not to let this life  
Slip by?
