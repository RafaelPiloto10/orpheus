I want to be free  
  
As I wake up everyday  
With no new songs to play  
Feeling like I ought to  
Pack my bag and run  
My imagination flies  
To some other sunny skies  
Where I felt so good  
And everything was done  
  
And my time was my own  
And my heart felt so free  
  
I don't mind a little rain  
But it doesn't seem the same  
When the clouds shut out  
Your beauty from my eyes  
There's a storm inside my head  
And I know it doesn't lead  
To a clearer day  
When nobody will cry  
  
I can't stand here alone  
And I need to be free  
  
So bring fire and bring steel  
For you know the way I feel  
Bring a silver horse  
To carry me away  
I'm no stranger, I'm a friend  
And my pain will never end  
Till the world will let us  
Live our lives as one  
  
And our time is our own  
And our hearts can be free  
  
I want to be free
