You must have faith in everything you do  
Faith will help you find the way faith will see you through  
Faith can move mountains and change the tide of the sea  
You can follow the guiding light wherever you may be  
Like the darkness come at the end of each day there must be an end to the
night  
And from the depths of your darkest moments faith will show you the lights  
You must have faced yes in everything you do  
Faith will help you find the way faith will see you through
