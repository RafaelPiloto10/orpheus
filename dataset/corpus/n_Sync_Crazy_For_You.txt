Wherever I go, whatever I do  
Whenever my heart is crying out for you  
Wherever I go, whatever I do  
I'm crazy for you  
  
It's not easy to be alone  
It's not easy to fall in love  
Every night I just get down and pray  
That you come my way, yeah  
I've never had a girl like you  
(Girl like you)  
I've never known what love could do  
Wish you'd come, baby and set me free  
I can't let it be, yeah  
  
Wherever I go, whatever I do  
Whenever my heart is crying out for you  
Wherever I go, whatever I do  
I'm crazy for you  
  
I want to, I want to rock with you  
I'm gonna, I'm gonna make it true  
I want to, I want to rock with you  
I'm crazy for you  
  
I'm waiting for the phone to ring  
And all the wonder love should bring  
All the things, darling I left behind  
Please give me a sign  
A little smile would light my life  
And a single touch would blow my mind  
Girl you know, by now you've got to be mine  
Till the end of time  
  
Wherever I go, whatever I do  
Whenever my heart is crying out for you  
Wherever I go, whatever I do  
I'm crazy for you  
  
Wherever I go, whatever I do  
My heart is crying out for you  
Wherever I go (wherever I go)  
Whatever I do, I'm crazy for you  
  
I want to, I want to rock with you  
I'm gonna, I'm gonna make it true  
I want to, I want to rock with you  
I'm crazy for you  
  
Ooh, and I will know  
Wherever I go, whatever I do  
My heart is crying out for you  
Wherever I go (wherever I go)  
Whatever I do  
  
Wherever I go, whatever I do  
(Wherever I go, whatever I do)  
My heart is crying out for you  
Wherever I go (wherever I go)  
Whatever I do, I'm crazy for you  
  
Wherever I go, whatever I do  
My heart is crying out for you  
Wherever I go (wherever I go)  
Whatever I do, I'm crazy for you
