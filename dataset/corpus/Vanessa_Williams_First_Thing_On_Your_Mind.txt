A little more giving  
A little less take  
A little more time  
To bend so we don't break  
A little less anger  
A little less pain  
A little more love  
Could surely stop the rain  
  
If you asked me if I thought  
That you loved me I'd say I know it  
But sometimes I need you to show it  
So baby  
  
Kiss me when you get out of bed  
Say the words that never get said  
Loving me should always be  
The first thing on your mind  
Tell me what I already know  
Hold me like you'll never let go  
Loving me should always be  
The first thing on your mind  
  
A little more laughter  
A little less tears  
A little more compromise  
To see us through the years  
A dream in the making  
A place of our own  
A little more give and take  
Will make a happy home  
  
If you asked me if I thought  
That you loved me I'd say I know it  
But sometimes I need you to show it  
So baby  
  
Kiss me when you get out of bed  
Say the words that never get said  
Loving me should always be  
The first thing on your mind  
Tell me what I already know  
Hold me like you'll never let go  
Loving me should always be  
The first thing on your mind
