This circus is falling down on its knees  
The big top is crumbling down  
It's raining in Baltimore fifty miles east  
Where you should be, no one's around  
  
I need a phone call  
I need a raincoat  
I need a big love  
I need a phone call  
  
These train conversations are passing me by  
And I don't have nothing to say  
You get what you pay for  
But I just had no intention of living this way  
  
I need a phone call  
I need a plane ride  
I need a sunburn  
I need a raincoat  
  
And I get no answers  
And I don't get no change  
It's raining in Baltimore, baby  
But everything else is the same  
  
There's things I remember and things I forget  
I miss you  
I guess that I should  
Three thousand five hundred miles away  
But what would you change if you could?  
  
I need a phone call  
Maybe I should buy a new car  
I can always hear a freight train  
If I listen real hard  
And I wish it was a small world  
Because I'm lonely for the big towns  
I'd like to hear a little guitar  
I think it's time to put the top down  
  
I need a phone call  
I need a raincoat
