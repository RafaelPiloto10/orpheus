Yeh, you must treat your lover girl right  
If you want to make lover's rock  
You must know a place you can kiss to make lovers rock  
'Cause everybody knows it's a crying shame  
But nobody knows the poor baby's name  
When she forgot that thing that she had to swallow  
  
You Western man, you're free with your seed  
When you make lovers rock  
But woops! there goes the strength that you need  
To make real cool lovers rock  
'Cause a genuine lover takes off his clothes  
And he can make a lover in a thousand go's  
An' she don't need that thing that she had to swallow
