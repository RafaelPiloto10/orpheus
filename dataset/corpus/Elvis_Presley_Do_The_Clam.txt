Hey, everybody, gather 'round  
Listen to that bongo sound  
Grab the first one in your reach  
Now we're going to shake the beach  
  
Do the clam, do the clam  
Grab your barefoot baby by the hand  
Turn and tease, hug and squeeze  
Dig right in and do the clam  
  
You can get your heart to spin  
On the outside looking in  
Moon ain't gonna last all night  
Well, let's work up an appetite  
  
Do the clam, do the clam  
Grab your barefoot baby by the hand  
Turn and tease, hug and squeeze  
Dig right in and do the clam  
  
Everybody's got that beat  
Well, listen to those happy feet  
Ain't you glad that you found out  
What the clam is all about?  
  
Do the clam, do the clam  
Grab your barefoot baby by the hand  
Turn and tease, hug and squeeze  
Dig right in and do the clam  
  
Do the clam, do the clam  
Grab your barefoot baby by the hand  
Turn and tease, hug and squeeze  
Dig right in and do the clam  
Dig right in and do the clam
