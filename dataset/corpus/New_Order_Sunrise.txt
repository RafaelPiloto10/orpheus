I've been waiting to hear your voice for too long now  
One way conversations do not work somehow  
Tell me how does one get your soul in touch with the one above  
When one way conversations pay a price for the use of love  
I tried so hard last night you would not talk to me  
I live with the fear of the few with the gift  
And I know what's going to be  
  
Why did you never speak my name in front of my family  
You gave me a gift that you then took away  
Like you never did before  
Your name might be God but you don't say that much to me  
Your name might be God but you don't say that much to me  
We might be your black sheep  
But you forgot us a long time ago  
We might be your lost sheep  
But it's time you remembered us now  
  
As we spend our days together, nothing can go wrong  
No one told the truth about it because it was so strong  
If you ever think of me, if you hear my name  
If you read between the lines, you'll hang your head in shame  
These? ears will never hear, the ice will never freeze  
Whatever I have done for you I did because you complained  
  
(Whatever you may think of me whatever you may say  
I've lived my whole life in danger,  
You've lived your life in hate)
