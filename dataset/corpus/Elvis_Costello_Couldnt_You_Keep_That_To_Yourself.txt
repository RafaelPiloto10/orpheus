The tiny slip at midnight  
A little sip at noon  
You're tired and torn approaching dawn  
My penitent buffoon  
Wouldn't you think I'd know by now  
I shouldn't have entertained it  
Couldn't you keep that to yourself  
You cried for my forgiveness  
You say it sets you free  
You summon dear the shameful tears  
That spill all over me  
Wouldn't you think I'd know by now  
I shouldn't have entertained it  
Couldn't you keep that to yourself  
  
The penny rides at evening tide  
The vain requests  
The blush of the night  
And the blooming bush  
Where you failed every test  
What should I believe of you?  
What should I forget  
Am I innocent yet  
  
Is it the wife you would have beaten  
Is it the child you couldn't bear?  
I fear you have mistaken me  
For somebody who cares  
The sophisticated victim  
That you skilfully request  
You can hide behind your wishes  
You can hide behind despair  
And all the wretched syndroms  
That carry away the blame  
Couldn't you keep you keep that to yourself  
And wouldn't you shouldn't you couldn't you  
Keep that to yourself
