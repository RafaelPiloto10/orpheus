It's a kind of magic  
It's a kind of magic  
A kind of magic - no way  
One dream, one soul, one prize  
One goal, one golden glance of what should be  
It's a kind of magic  
One shaft of light that shows the way  
No mortal man can win this day  
It's a kind of magic  
The bell that rings inside your mind  
Is challenging the doors of time  
It's a kind of magic  
The waiting seems eternity  
The day will dawn of sanity  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Is this a kind of magic?  
It's a kind of magic  
There can be only one  
This rage that lasts a thousand years  
Will soon be done  
This flame that burns inside of me  
I'm hearing secret harmonies  
It's a kind of magic  
The bell that rings inside your mind  
Is challenging the doors of time  
It's a kind of magic  
It's a kind of magic  
This rage that lasts a thousand years  
Will soon be, will soon be, will soon be done  
This is (this is) a kind (a kind) of magic (yeah)  
There can be only one one one one  
This rage that lasts a thousand years  
Will soon be done - done  
Magic - it's a kind of magic  
It's a kind of magic  
Magic magic magic (magic)  
Ha ha ha haa - it's magic  
Ha haa  
Yeah yeah  
Wooh  
It's a kind of magic
