Just a loud mouth Yankee I went down to Mexico.  
I didn't have much time to spend, about a week or so.  
There I lightly took advantage of a girl who loved me so.  
But I found myself a-thinkin' when the time had come to go  
  
[Chorus]  
What am I doin' hangin' round?  
I should be on that train and gone.  
I should be ridin' on that train to San Antone,  
What am I doin' hangin' round?  
  
She took me to the garden just for a little walk.  
I didn't know much Spanish and there was no time for talk.  
Then she told me that she loved me not with words but with a kiss.  
And like a fool I kept on thinkin' of a train I could not miss  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well it's been a year or so, and I want to go back again.  
And if I get the money, well I'll ride the same old train.  
But I guess your chances come but once and boy I sure missed mine.  
And still I can't stop thinkin' when I hear some whistle cryin'  
  
[Chorus]
