For you to think of me  
It would only take a minute of your time  
To spare one thought for me  
Would you miss just one minute of your time?  
  
When you are far away  
I'd like to be part of your time each day  
So think of me  
  
A minute of your time  
Is all it takes to bring us close  
When we are far apart  
  
And if I'm on your mind  
I know that there's a chance  
You'll find that I'm right there in your heart  
One minute ev'ry day  
May help to keep the wolf away  
Until that moment you are back to stay  
But better still I'd like to think you think of me  
Ev'ry minute of your time
