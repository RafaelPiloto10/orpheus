I'm a ne'er do well  
Runnin' off black and gold  
It's high time I pulled over  
And walked around a while  
  
I've seen that porcelain shell  
Erect some skeleton  
And I feel like we'd walk well together  
Because in the end, we are friends and lovers  
  
If asked of me I would  
Gobble them to bits  
The things that wall us off from  
Where we belong  
  
What's wrong with you is good  
For what's wrong with me  
And I think maybe we should stick together  
Because in the end, we are friends and lovers  
We are friends and lovers  
  
Abandon all the bold  
We've got to pick  
They only weigh us down and  
We're better than that  
  
If they all throw stones  
Start a collection  
Of everything we're not  
And what's because  
You should never have to defend  
Being friends and lovers  
  
Being friends and lovers  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
Being friends and lovers
