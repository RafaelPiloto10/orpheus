Oh everybody needs somebody, baby (every needs someone to love)  
Anytime I see you, I get crazy (anytime I kiss you, can't get enough)  
  
Tell me, is this love, a burning fire  
That's burning fast, but then it's gone away  
Oh tell me baby, do you feel desire  
I'll give you everything, I'm too shy to say  
I don't want to lose you girl  
I won't let you go  
Oh I don't want to lose you girl  
My love will show  
  
Oh everybody needs somebody, baby  
Everybody needs someone to love  
Anytime I see you, I get crazy  
Anytime I kiss you, can't get enough  
  
Oh you, you are a symphony  
Oh you, you are my destiny  
Girl you, you are the venus of my heart  
  
Tell me babe, do you find another  
Another man, who's breaking your heart?  
Oh tell me baby, is he your new lover  
And will you say, love will break apart  
Oh this is now the end of love  
I won't let you go  
Oh why'd you break this lonely heart  
Say it isn't so  
  
Oh everybody needs somebody, baby  
Needs someone to love  
I get crazy  
I can't get enough  
  
Oh you, you are a symphony  
Oh you, you are my destiny  
Girl you, you are the venus of my heart
