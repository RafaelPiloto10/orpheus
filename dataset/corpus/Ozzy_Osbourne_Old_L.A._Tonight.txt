Look into the future  
Look into my eyes and tell me everything's all right  
Tell me where we're going  
I'm so afraid 'cause I don't know what's going on with my life  
  
But it'll be all right tonight  
Will it be all right tonight?  
Are we doin' all right in old L.A. tonight?  
  
Sitting by the ocean  
Mapping out my plans of action, baby they include you  
I wish you'd send a message  
Maybe I'm just better off not knowing who knew  
  
But it'll be all right tonight  
I'm gonna be all right tonight  
Are we doin' all right in old L.A. tonight?  
  
Those summer nights when I look in your eyes  
I'm falling to pieces, pieces out of my mind  
And I'll never know why  
I'm falling to pieces, pieces  
  
Who could you imagine such a thing could happen to you?  
It's gonna be all right in old L.A.  
  
Those summer nights when I look in your eyes  
I'm falling to pieces, pieces out of my mind  
And I'll never know why  
I'm falling to pieces, pieces  
  
It's gonna be all right in old L.A. tonight
