You're making me wait like there's no tomorrow  
You're taking from me what I can't beg or borrow  
  
There's something that tells me that life has changed  
There's something that tells me this isn't a game  
There's something that tells me that you'll hit the floor  
There's something that tells me  
That you got everything you need but all you want is more  
  
You know there was dreams I had in my corner  
I made you a dollar, you gave a quarter  
  
There's something that tells me that life has changed  
There's something that tells me this isn't a game  
There's something that tells me that you'll hit the floor  
There's something that tells me  
That you got everything you need but all you want is more  
  
Yeah  
  
Yeah  
  
There's something that tells me that life has changed  
There's something that tells me this isn't a game  
There's something that tells me that you'll hit the floor  
There's something that tells me  
That you got everything you need but all you want is more
