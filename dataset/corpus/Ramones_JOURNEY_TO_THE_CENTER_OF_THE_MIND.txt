Leave your cares behind  
Come with us and find  
The pleasures of a journey to the center of the mind  
Come along if you care  
Come along if you dare  
Take a ride to the land inside of your mind  
Beyond the seas of thought  
Beyone the realm of what  
Across the streams of hopes and dreams where things are really not  
Come along if you care  
Come along if you dare  
Take a ride to the land inside of your mind  
But please realise  
You'll probably be surprised  
For it's the land unknown to man  
Where fantasy is fact  
So if you can, please understand  
You might not come back  
Come along if you care  
Come along if you dare  
Take a ride to the land inside and you'll see  
How happy life could be  
If all of mankind  
Would take the time to journey to the center of the mind  
Would take the time to journey to the center of the mind  
Center of the mind
