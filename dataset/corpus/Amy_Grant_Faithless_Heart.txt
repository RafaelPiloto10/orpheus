At times the women deep inside me  
Wanders far from home.  
And in my mind I live a life  
That chills me to the bone.  
A heart running for arms out of reach.  
But who is the stranger my longing seeks?  
I don't know,  
But it scares me through and through.  
Cause' I've a man at home  
Who needs me to be true.  
  
Oh, faithless heart  
Be far away from me.  
Playin' games inside my head  
That no one else can see.  
Oh, faithless heart  
You tempt me to the core,  
But you can't have a hold on me  
So don't come around anymore.  
  
God, you know the feelings here  
Can wipe my world away.  
Ravaging the promises  
A stronger heart once made.  
So hold me, I'm falling so fast.  
And tell me that the fighting inside will pass.  
As I walk away,  
And find the strength to choose  
The man who waits for me  
With a heart that's true.  
  
Oh, faithless heart  
Be far away from me.  
Playin' games inside my head  
That only I can see.  
Oh, faithless heart  
You tempt me to the core,  
But you can't have a hold on me  
So don't come around anymore.  
  
Faithless heart  
  
Oh, faithless heart  
Be far away from me.  
Playin' games inside my head  
That nobody else can see.  
Oh, faithless heart  
You tempt me to the core,  
But you can't have a hold on me  
So don't come around anymore.  
Oh, you can't have a hold on me  
So don't come around.
