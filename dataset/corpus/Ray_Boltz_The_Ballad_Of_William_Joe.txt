The Ballad Of William Joe  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
William Joe was the son of a farmer  
Who lived out on the plains  
William Joe never had too much  
Just a horse and his name  
Then one day  
He said goodbye to his mama  
Said, I've got to ride away  
I've got to find out  
What life is, papa  
I'm leaving home today  
Well, his mama ran and fetched him  
A sack of apples  
And she kissed him on the cheek  
She said, Son, we don't have much  
But these apples sure are sweet  
And as the young man  
Climbed upon his horse  
Silhouetted against the sky  
His papa nodded and his mama waved  
And they both had tears in their eyes  
As they watched him ride on  
Ride on, ride on  
William Joe rode for miles and miles  
As he went from town to town  
But each one seemed to be the same  
And peace he never found  
Well he'd seen the oceans  
He's seen the mountains  
And he'd seen the forests green  
He'd seen cities and he's seen deserts  
But he's never seen his dreams  
Then his mind went back  
To a sack of apples  
He reached down in one day  
And at the bottom of the sack of apples  
His papa's Bible lay  
And he could still remember the last words  
His papa said to him  
He said, Son, love will be here waiting  
Till you come home again  
You'll just ride on  
Ride on, ride on, ride on  
The evening sun was setting  
As he knelt down in the dirt  
And tears of repentance  
Began erasing all the hurt  
He closed his eyes  
And bowed his head  
And gave his heart to the Lord  
He finally found the freedom  
He'd been so long searching for  
Now it's tim
