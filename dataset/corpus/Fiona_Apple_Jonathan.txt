Jonathan, call again  
Take me to Coney Island  
Take me on the train  
Kiss me while I calculate  
And calibrate and heaven's sakes  
Don't make me explain  
  
Just tolerate my little fist  
Tugging on your forest chest  
I don't wanna talk about  
I don't wanna talk about anything  
I don't wanna talk about  
I don't wanna talk about anything  
  
Jonathan, anything  
And anyone that you have done  
Has gotta be alright with me  
If she's part of  
The reason you are how you are  
She's alright with me  
  
Just tolerate my little fist  
Tugging on your forest chest  
I don't wanna talk about  
I don't wanna talk about anything  
I don't wanna talk about  
I don't wanna talk about anything  
  
You like to captain  
A capsized ship  
But I like watching you live  
  
You like to captain  
A capsized ship  
But I like watching you live  
  
Jonathan, call again  
Take me to Coney Island  
Take me on the train  
Kiss me while I calculate  
And calibrate and heaven's sakes  
Don't make me explain  
  
Just tolerate my little fist  
Tugging on your forest chest  
I don't wanna talk about  
I don't wanna talk about anything  
I don't wanna talk about  
I don't wanna talk about anything
