Hey, look over yonder out in the rain,  
Soakin' wet fever in my brain.  
Now, I ain't certain which way to go,  
But I got to move, sure.  
  
[Chorus]  
Feelin' Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.  
Feelin' Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.  
Feelin' Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.  
I'm Feelin' Blue. I'm Feelin' Blue.  
  
Hey, look over yonder behind the wall,  
They're closin' in I'm about to fall.  
Now I'm no coward, but I ain't no cool  
Feel it in my bones, my book is due.  
  
[Chorus]  
Feelin' Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.  
Feelin' Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.  
Feelin' Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.  
I'm Feelin' Blue. I'm Feelin' Blue.  
  
Hey, look over yonder, up in the tree,  
There's a rope hangin' just for me.  
It has a warnin', It has a warnin',  
Things are pilin' up to break me down.  
  
[Chorus]  
Feelin' Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.  
Feelin' Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.  
Feelin' Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.  
I'm Feelin' Blue. I'm Feelin' Blue.  
  
Hey, look over yonder, out in the street,  
People laughin' by, walkin' easy.  
Now, I'm no sinner, but I ain't no saint.  
If it's happy, you can say I ain't.  
  
[Chorus]  
Feelin' Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.  
Feelin' Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.  
Feelin' Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.  
I'm Feelin' Blue. I'm Feelin' Blue.  
  
I'm Feelin' Blue (x6)
