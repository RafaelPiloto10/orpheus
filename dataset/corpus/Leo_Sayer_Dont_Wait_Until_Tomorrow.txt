Don't wait until tomorrow  
It may come too late  
Don't wait until tomorrow  
Only fools hesitate  
Take hold of every chance  
That's offered to you  
Don't say it can wait  
  
That never will do  
Don't wait until tomorrow  
''cause it won't wait for you  
Well I wonder sometimes  
What the future will be  
And all that it tells me  
Is wait and see  
  
Should I let the wind carry me  
Like a wave on the shore  
But I don't want my life  
To just pass me by  
When I think I'll grow old  
It just makes me cry  
There's too much to do and to say  
  
And I don't have the time  
It's all a waste of time  
Don't wait until tomorrow  
The waiting's no fun  
Don't wait until tomorrow  
Tomorrow never comes  
Take hold of every chance  
  
That's offered to you  
Don't say it can wait  
That never will do  
Don't wait until tomorrow  
'cause it won't wait for you  
  
And this is the time where my heart belongs  
I've waited in this town for much too long  
Feeling like a leaf on a tree  
I'm waiting to fall  
I think I've seen it all  
Don't wait until tomorrow  
It may come too late  
  
Don't wait until tomorrow  
Only fools hesitate  
Take hold of every chance that's offered to you  
Don't say it can wait that never will do  
Don't wait until tomorrow  
''cause it won't wait for tomorrow, no  
Don't wait until tomorrow  
It won't wait for you  
It won't wait for you
