Christmas bells in the steeple  
Ringing out on Christmas morn'  
But where are all the people  
Where has everybody gone?  
  
They're all busy with their presents  
Snug and warm behind their doors  
Thinkin' no one was forgotten  
Empty shelves in all the stores  
  
Doesn't anyone remember  
As they wake up Christmas morn'  
The 25th day of December  
Little Baby Jesus was born?  
  
Christmas bells in the steeple  
How their ringing seems to say  
O come all ye faithful, get down on your knees and pray  
Don't you know it's Christmas Day?
