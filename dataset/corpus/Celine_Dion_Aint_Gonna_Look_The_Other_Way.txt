Used to be easy, used to have truth hangin' round  
Never had secrets, always singing your praises now good and loud  
All I got is questions, and you left me wondering why  
Why you keep your distance, every lonely night  
  
When love was bound together  
We lived it by the letter  
Can't close my eyes forever  
'Cause everything has changed and now  
  
I ain't gonna look the other way, no more  
After all the clouds go by, its just another empty sky  
I ain't gonna wait to see the rain, no no  
Nothin's gonna make it right, look at me 'cause I choose life  
  
Its all about giving, its not about winning the game  
My mind was open, ready or not you closed it up again  
Still I keep asking, if you got something to hide  
I never stop learning, all the reasons why  
  
It took about a minute  
To find the point and hit it  
Gotta take this life and live it  
'Cause everything has changed and now  
  
I ain't gonna look the other way, no more  
After all the clouds go by, its just another empty sky  
I ain't gonna wait to see the rain, no no  
Nothin's gonna make it right, look at me 'cause I choose life  
  
When all the lights go out so suddenly, I loose my way  
So baby tell me  
Is something going on  
You gotta free me, this time I'm gonna be strong  
  
I ain't gonna look the other way, no more  
After all the clouds go by, its just another empty sky  
I ain't gonna wait to see the rain, no no  
Nothin's gonna make it right, look at me 'cause I choose life  
  
I ain't gonna look the other way, no more  
After all the clouds go by, its just another empty sky  
I ain't gonna wait to see the rain, no no  
Nothin's gonna make it right, look at me 'cause I choose life  
  
Gonna do it gonna make it alright  
Gonna do it gonna choose this life  
Nothing's gonna make it right  
Look at me 'cause I chose life (Oh baby)  
  
Nothing's gonna make it right  
Used to be easy, oh
