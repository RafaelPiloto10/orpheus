Each night, just about sunset  
I watch you passing my door  
It's all I can do  
Not to run to you  
Cause I don't want to cry anymore  
  
Nighttime, when there is moonlight  
The same old moon I knew before  
It's all I can do  
Not to run to you  
Cause I don't want to cry anymore  
  
All that I know about happiness  
I found just being with you  
Then I would find myself losing my mind  
Over some careless thing you would do  
  
Oh, why can't I forget you  
I know so well what is in store  
A moment or two  
Up in the clouds with you  
Then back where I was before  
  
No I don't want to cry anymore  
All that I've known about happiness  
I found just being with you  
Then I would find myself losing my mind  
Over some careless thing you would do  
  
Oh, why can't I forget you  
I know so well what is in store  
A moment or two  
Up in the clouds with you  
Then back where I was before  
  
No I don't want to cry anymore
