I remember when you were born  
I felt like one lucky  
Son of a gun  
  
And when you turned into two  
I was so happy  
When you said I love you  
  
Held you in my arms so tight  
I'd never forget  
The best years of my life  
  
[Chorus]  
Apple of your daddy's eye  
want to be the one to hold you in the night  
Apple of your daddy's eye  
Oh, oh sleep tight  
Don't you worry gonna be alright  
  
I remember when you were three  
You were so lovely  
So very pretty  
  
And when you turned into four  
I finally realized  
What God put her here for  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If I had my way  
Time would stand still  
You'd stay as sweet as you are  
But time waits for no one  
It never will  
Your gonna leave me soon enough  
I'm just sad 'cause you're growing up  
  
Held you in my arms so tight  
I'd never forget  
The best years of my life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't stop ever lovin' me because  
You're the apple of your daddy's eye
