Now blue ain't the word for the way that I feel  
And the storm's brewing in this heart of mine  
This ain't no crazy dream I know that it's real  
You're someone else's love now you're not mine  
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new  
While my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine  
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed  
But for now I'm just lonesome all the time  
  
So take all the treasured dreams I had for you and me  
And take all the love I thought was mine  
Someday these crazy arms may hold somebody new  
But for I'm just lonesome all the time  
Crazy arms that reach  
  
But for now I'm just lonesome all the time
