She owns a window to the ocean  
She has a pipeline to the sky  
But earthly creatures rarely notice  
When guardian angels pass them by  
  
Like a gecko behind a painting  
With hidden wisdom to impart  
In a world that needs more dancing  
She's a hula girl at heart  
  
Photograph shows, she is lovely  
Her bare feet are a work of art  
Her fragrance speaks of Frangipanni  
Yes, she's still a hula girl at heart  
  
With her pen and watercolors  
Drawing fish and butterflies  
Children always seem to conjure  
Images they recognize  
  
In the land beside the ocean  
Where romantics seem to dwell  
Destiny can set in motion  
Ripples that turn into swells  
  
She knows how to face the music  
She knows where the magic starts  
In a world that needs more dancing  
She's still a hula girl at heart  
  
Song sing slow  
Days gone by  
Time can't keep her  
Nor can I  
  
She has worn a wealth of costumes  
Hula skirts to wedding gowns  
Lived in cities walked through jungles  
Always sees the sun go down  
  
In this age of teeming tourists  
Fellow travelers know her well  
The darling of deserted beaches  
Adds her rhythms in a shell  
  
Her sensual and easy motion  
Seems impossible to chart  
In a world that needs more dancing  
She's still a hula girl at heart
