Maybe I didn't love you  
Quite as often as I could have  
And maybe I didn't treat you  
Quite as good as I should have  
  
If I made you feel second best  
Girl, I'm sorry I was blind  
But you were always on my mind  
You were always on my mind  
  
Maybe I didn't hold you  
All those lonely, lonely times  
And I guess I never told you  
I'm so happy that you're mine  
  
Little things I should have said and done  
I just never took the time  
You were always on my mind  
You were always on my mind  
  
Tell me  
Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died  
Give me  
Give me one more chance to keep you satisfied  
I'll keep you satisfied
