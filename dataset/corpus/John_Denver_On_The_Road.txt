Back in 1958 we drove an old V8 and when it'd gone a hundred thou' we got out
and pushed it a mile  
  
We didn't know who we were, we didn't know what we did  
We were just on the road  
  
Headin' down from Canada on a gravel road a mile from Montana  
Then my Daddy read a sign and took us in the wrong direction  
I asked my Daddy where are we goin', he said we'll just follow  
Our nose, so I looked out the window and dreamed I was a cowboy  
  
We didn't know who we were, we didn't know what we did  
We were just on the road  
  
I met a girl in a truck cafe, fell in love almost right away  
Then the Mercury was ready to go and I had to leave her  
  
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-Sh-doo  
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-Sh-doo-Sh-doo  
  
Go home said the man in the moon go home  
Go home said the man in the moon go home  
  
Because it's gettin' sorta late and I'll soon turn out my light  
Go home said the man in the moon  
Go home  
  
We didn't know who we were, we didn't know what we did  
We were just on the road  
  
We didn't know who we were, we didn't know what we did  
We were just a ridin' on  
We were just a ridin' on the road
