Looking around me,  
There's not so much in life I miss.  
Things that I can't see,  
I'll touch and I'll feel then I'll kiss.  
Then I saw you standing there  
With a smile I couldn't share,  
Just looking around ev'rywhere.  
  
All the things I've wanted to do  
Take so much time to get around to you.  
Just reach out and catch and hold on,  
Leaving trails of dust and lust,  
Never even ly'ng or try'ng, keep on moving, never dying.  
  
Tunes that I can't hear  
Would take me for a while my smile.  
Fares that are too dear,  
I'd rather walk out another mile.  
Then I heard a tune so right,  
It was in the dark of night,  
Just list'ning around ev'rywhere.  
  
All the things I've wanted to do  
Take so much time to get around to you.  
Just reach out and catch and hold on,  
Leaving trails of dust and lust,  
Never even ly'ng or try'ng, keep on moving, never dying.  
  
Smiles that I don't see,  
I'll make them up as I go on.  
Laughs that just can't be,  
I'll make and laugh at ev'ry one.  
Then I saw you in your place  
With a laugh upon your face,  
Just looking around ev'rywhere.  
  
All the things I've wanted to do  
Take so much time to get around to you.  
Just reach out and catch and hold on,  
Leaving trails of dust and lust,  
Never even ly'ng or try'ng, keep on moving, never dying.  
  
Looking around with my feet on the ground  
Full of words and of sound, bringing smiles all around.  
  
Satisfy me with your words that can be,  
Full of sound and I'll see I'm just looking around.
