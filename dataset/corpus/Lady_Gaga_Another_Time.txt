Lalalala  
Now ew aw  
But it's not the time  
To put around, and to play around  
Let the beat sink  
Let it make you sick  
  
I'm sorry cause I'm to late  
Oh maybe need some sleep  
I'm not attending because  
I lose my mind  
I lose my sense of control  
  
Mabey Another Time  
To Mess Around  
To rather die cause  
I make you cry  
I I'm  
Sorry to say  
I lose my mind  
Maybe Another Time  
Time- Tie the Time  
Another Time
