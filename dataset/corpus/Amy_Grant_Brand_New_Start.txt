When I think of all of the things He's doin' for me  
It makes me stand in wonder at what He's making me to be  
Tryin' to walk through straight but getting turned around  
Always makin' my Master take a backseat and wait around  
But I praise the Lord for giving me  
A brand new start each day  
And I praise His blessed name  
For guiding me all along the way  
If He didn't, I wouldn't even try  
Well maybe you can't see a change  
You know these things can take time  
But now that I've found Jesus  
Well He's given me peace of mind  
Now every day's just a chance  
To grow closer to Him  
I may not win all the battles  
But it's a victory in Him  
So I praise the Lord for giving me  
A brand new start each day  
And I praise His blessed name  
For guiding me all along the way  
If He didn't, I would surely die
