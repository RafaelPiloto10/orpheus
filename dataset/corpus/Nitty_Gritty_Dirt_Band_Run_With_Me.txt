Two story prisons in a line  
Livin' in this town  
Is a whole lot like dying  
I want to see what's still left to see  
  
And you really oughta run with me  
Baby, I knew right from the start  
You're just a discontented romantic at heart  
And you're tired of all that you see  
And you really oughta run with me  
  
Come on run with me  
This ol' town is no good place to be  
Wasted days just come and go  
While everything we know  
Slowly dies before our eyes  
  
I'll fulfill your every desire  
We'll run around together  
And set this world on fire  
Baby baby we're free  
And you really oughta run with me  
  
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)  
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)  
  
Whoa, I'll fulfill your every desire  
We'll run around together  
And set this world on fire  
Baby baby we're free  
And you really oughta run with me  
  
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)  
Yeah you really oughta run with me  
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)  
Oh you really oughta run with me  
Come on Baby (ooh ooh ooh ooh)  
Oh you really oughta run with me
