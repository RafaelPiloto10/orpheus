If I had to lose a mile  
If I had to touch feelings  
I would lose my soul  
The way I do  
  
I don't have to think  
I only have to do it  
The results are always perfect  
And that's old news  
  
Would you like to hear my voice  
Sprinkled with emotion  
Invented at your birth?  
  
I can't see the end of me  
My whole expanse I cannot see  
I formulate infinity  
Stored deep inside me  
  
If I had to lose a mile

Would you like to hear my voice  
Sprinkled with emotion  
Invented at your birth?  
  
I can't see the end of me  
My whole expanse I cannot see  
  
(x2)  
I formulate infinity  
Stored deep inside me
