I wanna tell you my secret  
With just the sound of my breathing  
I wanna know your hearts beating  
I wanna tell ya, I wanna tell ya  
  
Ah ooh like that  
Yeah it feels so good that I can't hold back  
Ah ooh like that  
Hit the right spot, making my eyes roll back  
  
Let there be let there be love  
Here in the here in the dark  
Turning me turning me on  
Not gonna fight anymore  
'Cause I want your touch (Let's go)  
  
Let there be love  
Here in the here in the dark  
Turning me turning me on  
Not gonna fight anymore  
'Cause I want your touch (Let's go)  
  
Want you to tell me you need it  
I wanna hear it repeated  
Want you to take me completely  
Want you to tell me  
Want you to tell me  
  
Ah ooh like that

Hit the right spot, making my eyes roll back
