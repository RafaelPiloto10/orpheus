[Verse 1:]  
I know you see us  
I know you hear us  
And you fill us when we pray  
You understand us, see deep inside us  
Translate tears and take them away  
I'm a be honest, there are times  
Your ways and method's, I don't understand  
It seems so far, tell me who you are  
I know your touch, but can't see your plan  
I'm lost in this thing called life,  
Left to me now feels right  
It's your turn now, I wanna be where you are  
  
[Chorus:]  
Hide me  
Let me live behind you  
Cause I need  
Shelter from the rain  
Remind me  
The only way my faith can grow  
Is when you let your winds blow  
You're making me stronger now, so rain,  
Don't go away  
Don't go away  
  
[Verse 2:]  
I'd admit  
It'd be nice  
To have some light shine down on me  
Especially,  
When, lord I shall be, you don't always let me see  
It ain't easy,  
But I'm trying hard to get out of your way  
To believe  
That what you say  
That my change begins today  
The road includes some pain,  
And to grow you need some rain  
And when it falls, I wanna be where you are  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Bridge:]  
Cause there's some much I see  
Needs to grow inside of me  
In the fire I realize  
Before I live, I have to die  
Please believe me when I say  
I can't waste another day  
It's so easy to complain  
But complain don't make a change  
Not the victim anymore  
All the things god has in store  
If I ain't ready don't let the rain  
Go away  
Don't go away  
  
[Chorus:]  
Hide me  
Cause I need  
Remind me  
The only way my faith can grow  
Is when you let your winds blow  
You're making me stronger now  
  
You're making me stronger now [x7]  
You made me stronger now [x4]  
  
[x2]  
He made me stronger now  
She made me stronger now  
They made me stronger now [x2]  
  
You made me stronger now [x8]
