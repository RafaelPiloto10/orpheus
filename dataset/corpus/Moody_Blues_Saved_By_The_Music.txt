When you're swallowing all your pride  
Do you need somewhere  
A place to hide?  
A smile from your face  
Where the light comes shining through  
All its strength - it came from you  
It's lost now, all that age before I knew you  
Is it that forever is hard to find?  
You made me recognize what I'd been leaving far behind  
Is it closing in on you like it was on me?  
This time I'm saved by the music  
Saved by the song that you bring  
  
When you're following all life's lies  
And find its meaning  
And truth still hides  
Don't cover your face  
Let the warmth come flowing through  
Welcome dawn, new morning dew  
  
This time I'm saved by the music  
Saved by the song we can sing  
This time I'm saved by the music  
Saved by the song that you bring  
  
When you're swallowing all life's lies  
This time we're saved by the music  
Saved by the song we can sing  
This time we're saved by the music  
Saved by the song we can sing  
This time we're saved
