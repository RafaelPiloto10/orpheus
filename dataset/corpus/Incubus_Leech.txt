Does it make you envy?  
Does it make you proud?  
To tuck the world into a paper bag  
This body's state of "I'm OK, you're not OK"  
Yes, men, too, could be on the rag  
  
I'm over my head I need a pick-me-up  
Its easy to get high when you're standing on our backs, man  
Would anything ever be good enough for you?  
Stand on your own, hold your water if you can  
  
The ride's over, did you enjoy yourself?  
The ride's over, fair thee well  
The ride's over, did you enjoy yourself?  
The ride's over, fair thee well  
Not on my time  
  
It isn't fair to mention, but it awes the crowd  
Your fictional, plastic alibi  
So take another hit, steal another line  
Did you ever meet a leech who was good at goodbyes?  
  
When you were down I always picked you up  
Why didn't I recognize that everything was never fine?  
I'm kicking myself that I shared spit with you  
So fuck yourself  
And fuck this bleeding heart of mine  
  
The ride's over, did you enjoy yourself?  
The ride's over, fair thee well  
The ride's over, did you enjoy yourself?  
The ride's over, fair thee well  
Not on my time  
  
When you were down I always picked you up  
Why didn't I recognize that everything was never fine?  
I'm kicking myself that I shared spit with you  
So fuck yourself and fuck this bleeding heart of mine  
  
The ride's over, did you enjoy yourself?  
The ride's over, fair thee well  
The ride's over, did you enjoy yourself?  
The ride's over, fair thee well  
  
The ride's over
