Don't look back, that'll get you nowhere  
A wall to wall suit and space circus hair  
One step forward, one step back  
That's what happens and that's a fact  
  
To tell the truth, you raise up your hand  
Don't write me no invitations in the sand  
And when you talk, say what you mean  
Just keep it dry, lord, and keep it clean  
  
[Chorus]  
Watch out for la booga rooga  
Some you win and some you loosa  
Watch out for la booga rooga  
Some you win and some you loosa  
  
I don't know why and I can't explain  
Why I'm lost on a street with no name  
But that's alright, that's okay  
I just feel like I'm slipping away  
Satellite mama, if you are near  
Hey, the party's over, now just get me outa here  
Silent night, watch over me  
See that nobody writes me into the dream  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm on fire, inside my head  
Someone put out the light  
And they sent the world to bed  
It's not too late, but I just can't stop  
I think this time I'm going over the top  
Hey, Mr. Dogface, please let me in  
Say, don't you think that I'm worth rememberin'  
Watch your step, watch what you do  
Cause you need me much more than I need you  
  
[Chorus]
