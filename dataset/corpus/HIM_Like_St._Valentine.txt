In the name of love lost  
I'm frozen to her and I want you  
To come build me a bridge soaked  
In gasoline and pass the torch  
  
Hey baby let me be your Valentine  
Saint Valentine  
Suck the sorrow out of you and try to keep a lie alive  
Like Saint Valentine  
  
Like the couple from Pompeii  
Our drama is put on display  
Along with a dove stuffed in a coffin of glass  
Entitled "Love lust and the holy ghost"  
  
Those were the days  
  
Hey, baby, let me be your valentine  
St. Valentine  
Suck the sorrow out of you and try to keep the lie alive  
  
Hey, baby, let me be your valentine  
St. Valentine  
Suck the sorrow out of you and try to keep the lie alive  
Like St. Valentine  
  
Love is the only war worth dying for  
Lift me up to knock me down I'm all yours for now  
  
Hey, baby, let me be your valentine  
St. Valentine  
Suck the sorrow out of you and try to keep the lie alive  
  
Hey, baby, let me be your valentine  
St. Valentine  
Suck the sorrow out of you and try to keep the lie alive  
Like St. Valentine  
  
Hey, baby, let me be your valentine, St. Valentine  
Hey, baby, let me be your valentine, St. Valentine  
Hey, baby, let me be your valentine, St. Valentine  
Hey, baby, let me be your valentine, St. Valentine  
Like St. Valentine
