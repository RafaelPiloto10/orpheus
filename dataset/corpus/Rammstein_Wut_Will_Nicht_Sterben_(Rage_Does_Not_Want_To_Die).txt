Tell me how far you want to go  
do you want to see him on the floor - "Yes"  
do you want him to kneel before you  
do you want him to beg for mercy  
  
Thoughts of vengeance whipped from humility  
you don't see or hear anything  
your sick feelings  
don't give him a chance  
your rage does not want to die  
and only that keeps you alive  
  
You can, you want and will never forgive  
and you condemn his life  
you drift in the insanity from  
excessive anger, destruction and vengeance,  
you were born to hate  
  
"My rage does not want to die"  
"My rage does not want to die"  
"my rage will never die"  
  
You ram your hatred like a stone  
into him "Ramming stone" -  
you have pursued, hunted, and cursed him  
and he has taken his heels, crawling  
  
You can, you want and will never forgive  
and you condemn his life  
you drift in the insanity from  
excessive anger, destruction and vengeance,  
you were born to hate  
  
"My rage does not want to die"  
"My rage does not want to die"  
"my rage will never die"  
  
You can, you want and will never forgive  
and you condemn his life  
you drift in the insanity from  
excessive anger, destruction and vengeance,  
you were born to hate  
  
"My rage does not want to die"  
"My rage does not want to die"  
"my rage will never die"
