I get along without you very well  
Of course I do  
Except when soft rains fall  
And drip from leaves  
Then I recall  
The thrill of being sheltered in your arms  
Of course I do  
But I get along without you very well  
I've forgotten you  
Just like I should  
Of course I have  
Except to hear your name  
Or someone's laugh that is the same  
But I've forgotten you  
Just like I should  
What a guy  
What a fool am I  
To think my breaking heart could kid the moon  
What's in store  
Should I fall once more  
No it's best that I stick to my tune  
I get along without you very well  
Of course I do  
Except perhaps in spring  
But I should never think of spring  
For that would surely  
Break my heart in two  
What's in store  
Should I fall once more  
No it's best that I stick to my tune  
I get along without you very well  
Of course I do  
Except perhaps in spring  
But I should never think of spring  
For that would surely  
Break my heart in two
