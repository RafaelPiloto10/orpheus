Well my father is a farmer  
A damn good one at his trade  
And he's always loved my mama  
Though we laid her in the grave  
  
I've been down, I've been down  
A hustler and a cheat  
I'll always love my father  
His kind heart can't be beat  
  
I'd spit in your face if you laughed at me  
Don't you know, don't you know  
I might be a dipper, but I ain't a thief  
Don't you know, don't you know  
  
Oh yeah  
Come on  
  
Well my father is a farmer  
Used to smack me on the ass  
Used to dress me up in my Sunday best  
Get down, get down to Sunday mass  
  
And I've been down, so down  
Don't you know, don't you know  
I'll always love my father  
I love him so
