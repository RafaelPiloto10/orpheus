Cross my heart and I swear the truth  
Love was dead to me til' i met you  
I spent, a lot of time building up these walls  
Then you come strutting in with your wrecking ball  
  
Just another girl defeated  
Til' you gimme what I needed  
  
Something I can feel  
Something I can feel deep down (Yeah)  
What did I do to deserve  
Someone who gives me love  
That gets better and better and better  
  
Sometimes I've gotta bite my tongue  
It even freaks me out the way I talk you up  
Your like a bad flip on the trampoline  
You just say my name I'm dizzy on my feet  
  
When my day goes numb and empty  
You know exactly how to give me  
  
Something I can feel  
Something I can feel deep down (Yeah)  
You know you're striking in love  
That keeps making this better and better and better  
Something I can feel  
  
I never ever need to ask for more (No)  
What did I do to deserve  
Someone who gives me love  
That gets better and better and better  
  
What did I, what did I do  
To find someone who gives me your love  
What did I, what did I do  
To find someone who gives me your love  
  
Something I can feel  
Something I can feel deep down (Yeah)  
You know you're striking in love  
That keeps making this better and better and better  
Something I can feel  
I never ever need to ask for more (No)  
What did I do to deserve  
Someone who gives me love  
That gets better and better and better  
  
What did I, what did I do  
To find someone who gives me your love (Something I can feel)  
What did I, what did I do  
To find someone who gives me your love (Something I can feel)  
What did I, what did I do  
To find someone who gives me your love
