I wanna tell you how it's gonna be,  
You're gonna give your love to me,  
I wanna love you night and day,  
You know my love not fade away.  
  
You know my love not fade away, not fade away!  
  
My love is bigger than a Cadillac,  
I try to show you but you drive me back,  
Your love for me has got to be real,  
You're gonna know just how I feel.  
  
Our love is real, not fade away, not fade away!
