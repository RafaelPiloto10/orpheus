ROCKABILLY FEVER  
Writer Carl Perkins  
Lord, it came rollin' out of Memphis  
Like a hurricane or Texas tornado  
It came rollin' out of Memphis  
Like a hurricane or a Texas tornado  
Yeah, it did...  
And they called us rockabillies  
Long before they called it rock 'n' roll  
We took a little country music  
Put some pop in and dressed it up in soul  
We took a little country music  
Put some pop in and dressed it up in soul  
That's all we did...  
And they called us rockabillies  
Long before they called it rock 'n' roll  
Yeah, rockabilly fever  
Looks like it's coming back again, mm-mm  
Ah, rockabilly fever  
Look out, it might get you my friend  
If that fever starts to get you  
Lay back son, you just might explode  
If that fever starts to get you  
Lay back son, you just might explode  
Look out...  
And they called us rockabillies  
Long before they called it rock 'n' roll  
That's what we were, play it guitar, here we go...  
Well, Elvis started shakin'  
And the whole world shook a little too  
I said Elvis started shakin'  
And the whole world shook a little bit too  
He said, that's all right mama  
Mama, don't you step on my blue suede shoes  
That's what the boy said...  
Oh, rockabilly fever  
Looks like it's coming back again  
Won't it be fun..  
Rockabilly fever  
Look out, it might get you my friend  
If that fever starts to get you  
Just lay back son, you just might explode  
If that fever starts to get you  
Just lay back son, you just might explode  
Well, they called it rockabilly  
Long before they called it rock 'n' roll, oh yeah  
Come on let's rock  
Come on let's roll  
Everybody let's rock  
Everybody let's rock
