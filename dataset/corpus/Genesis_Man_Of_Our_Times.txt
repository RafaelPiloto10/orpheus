I'm one of many, I speak for the rest but I don't understand  
Tonight, tonight, oh tonight, tonight  
He brings another day, another night, another fight  
Well there's another day done and there's another gone by  
He's a man of our times, a man of our times  
Tonight, tonight, oh he's burning bright  
  
He's a man of our times, he's a man of our times, ooh ooh ooh  
And in the beating of your heart there is another beating heart  
  
All at once I can see what we do  
Me into me and you into you  
Me into me and you into you  
Tonight, tonight, oh he's burning bright  
Everyone is on their feet 'cause he is out  
Out on the street  
There's another day done and there's another gone by  
No more me into e and you into you  
Tonight, tonight, oh he's burning bright  
  
He's a man of our times, he's a man of our times, ooh ooh ooh  
And in the beating of your heart there is another beating heart  
  
All at once I can see what we do  
Me into me and you into you  
Me into me and you into you  
Tonight, tonight, oh he's burning bright  
Everyone is on their feet 'cause he is out  
Out on the street  
There's another day done and there's another gone by  
No more me into e and you into you  
Tonight, tonight, oh he's burning bright  
  
Man of our times, he's a man of our times  
He's a man of our times, ooh ooh ooh  
And in the beating of your heart there is another beating heart  
  
Man of our times
