Words nothing but words  
For me to show  
How much my love for you unfolds  
Through trouble and fears  
This love feels so real  
And I need you to know  
  
Even though we're far apart  
You're right beside me in my heart  
  
Chorus:  
Don't you know my love is here?  
Don't you know my love is real?  
You should know by now  
This much is true  
My love is here for you  
  
Time, nothing but time  
To make up your mind  
I'll give you all that you need  
I want you to know  
I'll never let go  
'Til you come back to me  
  
Even though you're far away  
I'm right beside you day by day  
  
Chorus:  
Don't you know my love is here?  
Don't you know my love is real?  
You should know by now  
This much is true  
My love is here for you  
  
Even though we're far apart  
You're right beside me in my heart  
  
Don't you know my love is here?  
Don't you know my love is real for you?  
You should know by now  
This much is true  
My love is here for you
