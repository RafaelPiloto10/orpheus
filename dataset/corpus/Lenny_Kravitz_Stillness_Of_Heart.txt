I'm out here on the street  
There's no one left to meet  
The things that were so sweet  
No longer move my feet  
But I keep trying  
I keep on trying  
  
All that I want is  
Stillness of heart  
So I can start  
To find my way  
Out of the dark  
And into your heart  
  
I got more than I can eat  
A life that can't be beat  
Yet still I feel this heat  
I'm feeling incomplete  
What am I buying?  
My soul is crying  
  
All that I want is  
Stillness of heart  
So I can start  
To find my way  
Out of the dark  
And into your heart  
  
Where's the love?  
What is this world we live in?  
Where's the love ?  
We've got to keep on giving  
Where's the love ?  
What happened to forgiving ?  
Anyone ?  
  
All that I want is  
Stillness of heart  
So I can start  
To find my way  
Out of the dark  
And into your heart
