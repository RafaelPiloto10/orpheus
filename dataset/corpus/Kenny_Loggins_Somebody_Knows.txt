Out of my head and delighted, somebody knows how I feel  
If you ask me to play it, you won't have to say it twice  
Cause I'm goin' to the head of the line, I'm takin' my life away  
I'm so glad you made it, and now that you're ready  
I'll begin to tell you what you want, but I know  
(I feel, I feel) somebody knows, (I feel, I feel) somebody knows  
(I feel, I feel) somebody knows, (I feel, I feel)  
Somebody knows what you want and what you're tryin' to do  
Cause the same thing can happen to you  
A little smoke, a little drink, can make somebody start to think  
That he knows  
(I feel, I feel) somebody knows (I feel, I feel)  
Somebody knows what you want, when you want it  
(Somebody knows) when you're doin' it right  
Somebody sees with their feelings, and feels what they're being tonight  
And we're doin' it together, I know  
(I feel, I feel) somebody knows, (I feel, I feel) somebody knows  
(I feel, I feel) somebody knows, (I feel, I feel) God I know  
(I feel, I feel) somebody knows, (I feel) I feel somebody knows  
(I feel, I feel) somebody knows, (I feel, I feel)  
Got what you want on the run now, keep it on in sight  
Make me crazy, and you won't need me to tell you that you're doin' it right  
Cause I know  
(I feel, I feel) somebody knows, (I feel) I feel somebody knows  
(I feel, I feel) somebody knows (I feel, I feel)
