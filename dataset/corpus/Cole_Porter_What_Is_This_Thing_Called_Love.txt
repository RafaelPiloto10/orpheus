I was a humdrum person  
Leading a life apart  
When love flew in through my window wide  
And quickened my hum-drum heart  
Love flew in through my window  
I was so happy then  
But after love had stayed a little while  
Love flew out again  
  
What is this thing called love?  
This funny thing called love?  
Just who can solve its mystery?  
Why should it make a fool of me?  
I saw you there one wonderful day  
You took my heart and threw it away  
That's why I ask the Lord in Heaven above  
What is this thing called love?  
  
You gave me days of sunshine  
You gave me nights of cheer  
You made my life an enchanted dream  
'Til somebody else came near  
Somebody else came near you  
I felt the winter's chill  
And now I sit and wonder night and day  
Why I love you still?
