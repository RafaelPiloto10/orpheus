Well, I cannot be your lover and I will not be your friend  
Well, I know you say you need me but I have no time to spend  
We could talk like this for hours, I'd just end up getting bored  
'Cause no one needs a dealer just a day before a score  
  
Let me in, let me in  
Let me in, sweet darling, let me in, let me in  
Let me in, let me in  
Let me in, sweet darling, let me in, let me in  
  
Do you think that you could leave me?  
Could you leave and go away just for a little while?  
Do you think that I could leave you?  
Could I leave and go away just for a change of style?  
  
Well, the children up there dig my shit so I sell it to them cheap  
Better bring the scales and check the deal  
Getting scared that I might cheat  
Well, you're just a speck of polish on the fat man's shiny shoes  
And I think I hate them for it and I think they hate me too  
  
Let me in, let me in  
Let me in, sweet darling, let me in, let me in  
Let me in, let me in  
Let me in, sweet darling, let me in, let me in  
  
Well, you spend your whole life moaning down the telephone for bread  
You can't get your sleep for trying, darling, remember what you said  
You come around most any time, sell me what you can  
What you see is what you get, catch me if you can  
  
Let me in, let me in  
Let me in, sweet darling, let me in, let me in  
Let me in, let me in  
Let me in, sweet darling, let me in, let me in  
  
Do you think that you could leave me?  
Could you leave and go away just for a little while?  
Do you think that I could leave you?  
Could I leave and go away just for a change of style?  
  
Well, I cannot be your lover and I will not be your friend  
Well, I know you say you need me but I have no time to spend  
We could talk like this for hours, I'd just end up getting bored  
'Cause no one needs a dealer just a day before a score  
  
Let me in  
Let me in  
Let me in
