Old mister fun is back  
Wonder where he's been hiding at  
Hanging round the edge  
Walls unfortified, inside  
  
No different, patchwork hack  
Toil away on an unlaid track  
Falls closing in, got nowhere to hide  
This time  
  
Finding ceilings low  
I'm too big or this room's too small  
Why's my ceiling another's floor  
  
Past twisted, expected wrap  
Attention span increasingly short  
Hard to breathe, this altitude will get you high  
I've tried  
  
Finding ceilings low  
I'm too big or this room's too small  
Why's my ceiling another's floor  
  
And nobody can tell you  
It's a moment in time  
That defines and deforms you  
  
Finding ceilings low  
I'm too big or this room's too small  
Why's my ceiling another's floor  
  
And nobody can tell you  
It's your moment in time  
  
Write me over, false reporter  
Can't you let me shine  
Write me over, false reporter  
Can't you let me shine  
  
And nobody can tell you  
It's a moment in time  
That defines and deforms you
