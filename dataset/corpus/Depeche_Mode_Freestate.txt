I can hear your soul crying  
Listen to your spirit sighing  
I can feel your desperation  
Emotional deprivation  
Let yourself go  
Let yourself go  
Let your feelings show  
Picking up the conversations  
Deep in your imagination  
Tune in to the lonely voices  
Talking of their only choices  
Let yourself go  
Let yourself go  
Let your spirit grow  
Step out of your cage and onto the stage  
It's time to start playing your part  
Freedom awaits  
Open the gates  
Open your mind  
Freedom's a state  
I can taste the tears falling  
The bitterness that's inside you calling  
Yearning for a liberation  
Emotional emancipation  
Let yourself go  
Let yourself go  
Let your senses overflow  
Step out of your cage and onto the stage  
It's time to start playing your part  
Freedom awaits  
Open the gates  
Open your mind  
Freedom's a state
