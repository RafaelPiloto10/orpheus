You can tell everyone  
Love is over and done  
You can pack all your things and go  
  
You can lie to yourself  
And say that there's nothing left  
But there's something that I like you to know  
  
It's never really over  
Even though you say we're through  
You may be holding me  
But can't you see  
It's not over if I'm not over you  
  
There's not much I can do  
If it's over for you  
I'll just wish you the best  
When you leave  
But you played such a part  
In my life and in my heart  
You'll always be part of me  
  
It's never really over  
Even though you say we're through  
You may be holding me  
But can't you see  
It's not over if I'm not over you
