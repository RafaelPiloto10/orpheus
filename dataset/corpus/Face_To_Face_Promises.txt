What's the matter with my view?  
Is it something less than you think it should be?  
What's the matter with the truth?  
Is there any of it left for us to see?  
  
That's not the way it is supposed to be  
That's not the meaning of equality  
  
I don't want promises  
I don't want condescending words from you  
  
You can do most anything  
As long as it's exactly how I say  
Opportunity is free  
Just make sure that you have enough to pay  
  
So go on turn and walk away  
I guess there's nothing left to say  
I won't make the same mistakes  
Can't have it any other way  
  
I see no honesty in promises you make  
We've been too tolerant and something has to change
