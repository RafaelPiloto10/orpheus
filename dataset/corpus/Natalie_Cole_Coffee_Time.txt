[Chorus]  
Coffee time  
My dreamy friend  
It's coffee time  
Let's sing  
This silly  
Little rhyme  
And have  
A cup of coffee  
  
Java time  
My happy chum  
Let's have a time  
We'll celebrate  
For just a dime  
And have  
A cup of coffee  
  
Greetin' time  
The music box  
Is beatin' time  
It's good  
Old-fashioned  
Meetin' time  
We're in the pink  
So come and clink  
And let's drink  
A cup of coffee  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
And have  
A cup of coffee  
And have  
A cup of coffee
