We never say what we should say  
I guess it's just the english way  
We talk about the weather  
Stay polite and fun together and  
  
It's true, you keep it in your heart and  
If I gave you an inch for every time I was hurt  
I'd be pushing up daisies six feet under the dirt  
And if you gave me a flower for every broken vow  
We'd have a fabulous garden by now  
  
We know what never must be said  
And keep it locked inside our heads  
The feelings understated  
Overdosed and underrated  
  
It's true, you keep it in your heart and  
If I gave you an inch for every time I was hurt  
I'd be pushing up daisies six feet under the dirt  
And if you gave me a flower for every broken vow  
We'd have a fabulous garden by now
