Every night and every day my heart feels the pain  
I wake up to the thought of you and I call your name  
No one ever made me feel the way you do  
Nothing in this world I wouldn't do for you  
But now I've got to let go  
  
We don't stand a chance  
In this wild romance, my tender heart  
Maybe it's wiser to walk away and love again  
With my tender heart.  
We don't stand a chance  
In this wild romance, oh it hurts so bad  
Knowing that I'm not the one you want  
I can't hold on to my tender heart  
  
I never thought I'd be the one who would play the fool  
But I know love can feel so good and can be so cruel  
It's clear to me the writing is on the wall  
It's clear to me that you don't really love me at all  
And I can't go on this way  
  
We don't stand a chance  
In this wild romance, my tender heart  
Maybe it's wiser to walk away and love again  
With my tender heart.  
We don't stand a chance  
In this wild romance, oh it hurts so bad  
Knowing that I'm not the one you want  
I can't hold on to my tender heart  
  
I'm standing at the door  
Don't need this hurt no more  
I'm crying out in vain  
Cause you don't feel my pain.  
  
Maybe it was always going to be this way  
Maybe I'll look back and understand some day  
But now I've got to say  
We don't stand a chance  
In this wild romance, my tender heart  
Maybe it's wiser to walk away and love again  
With my tender heart.  
We don't stand a chance  
In this wild romance, oh it hurts so bad  
Knowing that I'm not the one you want  
I can't hold on to my tender heart  
My tender heart
