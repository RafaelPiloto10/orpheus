I'm so undemanding  
'Cause they so love is blind  
I've lived this life pretending  
I can bear this hurt deep inside  
The truth is that I'm longing  
For love that's so divine  
I've searched this whole world wishing  
She'll be there time after time  
  
Someone put your hand out  
I'm begging for your love  
'Cause all I do is hand out  
A heart that needs your love  
  
I've lived my life the lonely  
A soul that cries of shame  
And handicapped emotions  
Save me now from what still remains  
I'll be your story hero  
I'll serenade in rhyme  
I'm just needing that someone  
Save me now, am I the one?  
  
Someone put your hand out  
I'm begging for your love  
'Cause all I do is hand out  
A heart that needs your love  
Someone put your hand out  
I'm begging for your love  
'Cause all I do is hand out  
A heart that needs your love  
  
When you say we will dance 'till the light of day  
It's just like the children in Earth's joy  
When we pray will you promise me you'll always stay?  
It's because I'm needing that someone  
  
Someone put your hand out  
I'm begging for your love  
'Cause all I do is hand out  
A heart that needs your love  
Someone put your hand out  
I'm begging for your love  
'Cause all I do is hand out  
  
Someone put your hand out  
I'm begging for your love  
'Cause all I do is hand out  
Love
