Hang it up Sailor  
Your flag ship it burns  
And it burns and it burns  
You took the straight road  
You just missed the turn,  
You're out of gas out of gas  
Put on the red shoes  
A white knuckle ride  
She's been denied deep inside,  
And I've got a crack whores dreams upon my tail  
Sweet love for sale love for sale  
I just want to ride in your car  
I've got a back street style to pay the rent,  
I'm on my knees give me keys  
And I've got a gun but the rents already spent  
I'm out of cash out of cash  
And I've got a crackwhores dream upon my tail  
Sweet Love for sale love for sale  
I just want to ride in your car,  
She gets colder
