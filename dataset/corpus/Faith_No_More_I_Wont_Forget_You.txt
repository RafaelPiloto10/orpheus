It only tickles now,  
I used to kick and shout  
Now I just cling to the????  
Footprints gone,  
You never love someone  
Only what they leave behind And I won't forget you,  
And I won't forget you,  
And I won't forget you,  
And I won't when I'm in hell I'm taking all those things,  
The things that no one brings  
The packing of those memories  
And when I come up the Mountain of Needles  
And I swim in a Lake of Blood  
No!  
And I won't forget you  
When I'm in hell I won't forget you
