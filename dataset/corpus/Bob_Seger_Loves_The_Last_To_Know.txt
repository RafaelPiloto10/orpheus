There's a distant sound to the outward bound  
On a lonesome windy night  
A restless sigh as it fades away  
A longing at first light  
There's a sad resolve that it's all gone wrong  
Yet before you turn to go  
It comes to you  
It's really true  
It's your love that's last to know  
  
Well we take our time we're polite and kind  
To the strangers that we meet  
And the ones who share the ones who really care  
They don't seem to make us feel complete  
So we stand alone  
And we act so strong  
We're all such worldly souls  
Till we find one day  
We've lost our way  
And our love's the last to know  
  
So we stand alone  
And we act so strong  
We're all such worldly souls  
Then we find one day  
That we've lost our way  
And our love's the last to know  
Then we find one day  
That we've lost our way  
And our love's the last to know
