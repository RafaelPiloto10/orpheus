Blood's been spilled throughout all times  
We should know better since we've been around  
There's been changes there's no denyin'  
But in what direction is good sense flying  
This world so endless blue  
Is better for lovers  
You cry 'cause you don't know if it's true  
If all those years've been wasted time  
Evil strikes, you feel the fear  
The vision of the future is no longer clear  
In your mind you see yourself  
Running and hiding you're somebody else
