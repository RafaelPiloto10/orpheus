This is it  
It's time for you to go to the wire  
You will hit  
'Cause you got the burnin' desire  
It's your time (Time)  
You got the horn so why don't you blow it  
You are fine (Fine)  
You're filthy cute and baby you know it  
  
[Chorus]  
Cream  
Get on top  
Cream  
You will cop  
Cream  
Don't you stop  
Cream  
Sh-boogie bop  
  
You're so good  
Baby there ain't nobody better (Ain't nobody better)  
So you should  
Never, ever go by the letter (Never ever)  
You're so cool (Cool)  
Everything you do is success  
Make the rules (Rules)  
Then break them all 'cause you are the best  
  
Yes you are  
  
Cream  
Get on top  
Cream  
You will cop  
Cream  
Don't you stop  
Cream  
Sh-boogie bop  
  
Look up in the air, it's your guitar  
  
Do your dance  
Why should you wait any longer?  
Take a chance  
It could only make you stronger  
It's your time (It's your time)  
You got the horn so why don't you blow it (Go on and blow it)  
You're so fine (you're so fine)  
You're filthy cute and baby you know it (you know it)  
  
Cream  
Get on top  
Cream  
You will cop  
Cream  
Don't you ever stop  
Cream  
Sh-boogie bop  
  
Cream  
Cream  
Cream  
Sh-boogie bop  
  
Cream  
Cream  
Right there  
Cream  
Don't you stop  
Cream  
Sh-boogie bop  
  
Sh-boogie
