Fly through the glass of a window pane  
Fall through the sky feeling the rain  
Walk on broken glass your Tell-Tale Heart  
  
Look through the bars of a dirty jail cell  
Soar to heaven dive to hell, listen to your Tell-Tale Heart  
  
Setting fires in the ghost twilight  
We see you dress we bolt with fright  
You see an apparition disappear  
  
Ah, jump to the table jump up the stairs  
Stand on the rooftop looking out through the air  
Walk on broken glass your Tell-Tale Heart  
  
Lenore am I dreaming  
How can death keep us apart  
Lenore I see you burning...  
And I'd, walk on burning embers  
Walk on burning embers  
Walk on burning embers Tell-Tale Heart  
  
Walk on burning embers  
Walk on burning embers  
Walk on burning embers  
Tell-Tale Heart
