Sex is sex and love is love,  
Mix 'em both up, baby, that's the stuff  
I can't believe I'm seeing the world  
Come tumbling, crumbling down  
Yeah, this love the world's receiving, more chance of it on shutting down  
Shutting down, yeah, yeah  
  
Like it or not, love is the God  
Love is the, love is the God  
Like it or not, love is the God  
Love is the God  
  
So put your guns down on the ground, yeah,  
Peace, it makes such a pretty sound  
I can't believe I'm seeing the world  
Come tumbling, crumbling down  
You won't believe the feeling  
When it's all coming back around  
Coming 'round, yeah, yeah  
  
Love is the God, yeah, like it or not  
Love is the, love is the, yeah,  
Love is my God  
Like it or not,  
Love is God  
  
Love is my God,  
Yeah, yeah, like it not  
Love is the, love is the, yeah,  
Like it or not  
Love is the, yeah,  
Like it or not  
Love is the, love is the, yeah  
Come on, come on, come on, come on  
Yeah, love is the God  
Love is the, oh, like it or not  
Love is the, love is the, yeah  
Love is the God  
  
Love is God
