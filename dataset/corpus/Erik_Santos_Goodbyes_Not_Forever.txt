I never knew our love would end this way  
I though this love could make it to forever  
You said goodbye and you left me all alone  
How can I live without your love  
How can I carry on  
  
[Chorus:]  
Baby, I need your love  
I wish you were here to stay  
Cause here I am, please love me again  
Bring back our hearts together  
Don't let this love of mine  
Keep longing for all the time  
When you and I  
Can build a dream forever  
  
I asked myself why you turned and walked away  
Please tell me how so that I can make you stay  
But you said goodbye and you left me all alone  
How can I live without your love  
How can I carry on  
  
[Chorus:]  
Baby, I need your love  
I wish you were here to stay  
Cause here I am, please love me again  
Bring back our hearts together  
Don't let this love of mine  
Keep longing for all the time  
When you and I  
Can build a dream forever

[Chorus:]  
Baby, I need your love  
I wish you were here to stay  
Cause here I am, please love me again  
Bring back our hearts together  
Don't let this love of mine  
Keep longing for all the time  
When you and I  
Can build a dream forever  
  
[Coda:]  
When you and I can share the love forever
