If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me  
Ooohh no  
Baby please don't go  
And if you leave me now, you'll take away the very heart of me  
Ooohh no  
Baby please don't go  
Ooohh girl  
I just want you to stay  
  
A love like ours is love that's hard to find  
How could we let it slip away  
We've come too far to leave it all behind  
How could we end it all this way  
When tomorrow comes and we'll both regret  
The things we said today

Ooohh no  
Baby please don't go  
Ooohh girl  
I just got to have you by my side  
Ooohh no  
Baby please don't go  
Ooohh mama  
I just got to have your loving here
