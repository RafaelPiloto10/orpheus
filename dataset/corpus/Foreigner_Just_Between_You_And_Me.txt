Staring at each other with accusing eyes keep our voices low  
Don't act surprised  
If the word gets out, yeah, that's alright  
  
I know you're just looking for some sympathy  
but listen you don't know how it gets back to me  
You're getting reckless girl, but that's alright  
  
Don't you know that one cold word is going to lead to another  
and then we'll have nowhere to go  
  
Even if heaven and earth collide tonight  
we'll be all alone in a different light  
I don't care what the world can't see  
It's just between you and me  
  
I see telltale signs of a love in decline  
There should be something to say  
but we don't take the time  
and I don't understand, but that's alright  
  
Now you can turn the page or you can tear me apart  
Don't make an open book out of my private heart  
You should know better now, but that's alright  
  
Don't you know that one cold word is going to lead to another  
and then we'll have nowhere to go  
  
Even if heaven and earth collide tonight  
we'll be all alone in a different light  
I don't care what the world can't see  
It's just between you and me  
  
If we don't work this out we won't recover  
We'll loose this soulfful love for one another  
But with all I've heard and all I've seen  
I'm still lost in your mystery  
  
Staring at each other with accusing eyes keep our voices low  
Don't act surprised if the word gets out  
Yeah that's alright  
  
Don't you know that one cold word is going to lead to another
