No I never knew you  
We both went to different schools  
Me so scared of the rules  
You chasing all the girls  
  
But it seems to me  
We never grew up we just got ourselves free  
Inventing what we could be  
To buy all their curls  
  
Get up and dance  
Get up and smile  
Get up and drink  
To the ones who are gone in the shortest while  
  
She was just eighteen she collapsed  
And they took her away  
She didn't make it for more than an hour  
Then she was gone  
  
What do you say?  
When someone's been taken that way  
Before they've had a day to fly in the sun  
  
Get up and dance  
Get up and smile  
Get up and drink  
To the ones who are gone in the shortest while  
  
Get up and dance  
Get up and smile  
Get up and drink  
To the to the ones who are gone in the shortest while  
  
I'll sing my sorrow  
I'll sing my sorrow  
I'll sing my sorrow  
I'll sing my sorrow  
  
No I never knew you  
We both ended up as different fools  
Me so scared of the rules  
You chasing all the girls  
  
But it seems to me  
We never grew up we just got ourselves free  
Inventing what we could be  
To buy all their curls  
  
Get up and dance  
Get up and smile  
Get up and drink  
To the ones who are gone in the shortest while  
  
Get up and dance  
Get up and smile  
Get up and drink  
To the to the ones who are gone in the shortest while  
  
I'll sing my sorrow  
I'll sing my sorrow  
I'll sing my sorrow  
I'll sing my sorrow  
  
I'll sing my sorrow  
I'll sing my sorrow  
I'll sing my sorrow  
I'll sing my sorrow
