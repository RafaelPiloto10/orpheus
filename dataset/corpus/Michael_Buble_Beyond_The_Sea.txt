Somewhere, beyond the sea  
Somewhere, waiting for me  
My lover stands on golden sand  
And watches the ships  
That go sailing  
  
Somewhere, beyond the sea  
She's there, watching for me  
If I could fly like birds on high  
Then straight to her heart  
I'll go sailing  
  
It's far, beyond the stars  
It's near beyond the moon  
And oh, beyond a doubt  
My heart will lead me there soon  
We'll meet, beyond the shore  
We'll kiss just like before  
Happy we'll be beyond the sea  
And ever again, I'll go sailin'  
  
And oh, beyond a doubt  
My heart will lead me there soon  
Oh we'll meet and oh we'll meet beyond the shore  
We'll kiss just as before  
Happy we-will be beyond the sea  
And ever again, I'll go sailin'
