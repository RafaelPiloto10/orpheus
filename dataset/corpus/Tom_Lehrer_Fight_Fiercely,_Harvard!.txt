Now we come to that peculiar bit of Americana known as the football fight
song. I was reminded not too long ago, upon returning from my lesson with the
Scrabble pro at the Harvard club in Boston, of the days of my undergraduacy
long ago when there used to be these very long Saturday afternoons in the fall
with nothing to do - the library was closed - just waiting around for the
cocktail parties to begin. And on occasions like that, some of us used to
wander over to the...I believe it was called the stadium, to see if anything
might be going on over there. And one did come to realize that the football
fight songs that one hears in comparable stadia have a tendency to be somewhat
uncouth, and even violent, and that it would be refreshing, to say the least,
to find one that was a bit more genteel. And here it is, dedicated to my own
alma mater, and called Fight Fiercely, Harvard.  
  
Fight fiercely, Harvard, fight, fight, fight!  
Demonstrate to them our skill.  
Albeit they possess the might,  
Nonetheless we have the will.  
  
How we will celebrate our victory,  
We shall invite the whole team up for tea. (How jolly!)  
Hurl that spheroid down the field,  
And fight, fight, fight!  
  
Fight fiercely, Harvard, fight, fight, fight!  
Impress them with our prowess, do!  
Oh, fellas, do not let the crimson down,  
Be of stout heart and true.  
  
Come on, chaps, fight for Harvard's glorious name!  
Won't it be peachy if we win the game? (Oh, goody!)  
Let's try not to injure them,  
But fight, fight, fight!  
Let's not be rough, though!  
Fight, fight, fight!  
And do fight fiercely!  
Fight, fight, fight!
