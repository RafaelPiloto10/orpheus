Whenever I get down  
I look to someone else  
I need your love to bring me 'round  
And so I must confess  
I'm guilty  
Of believing you to be  
The better part of me  
I never thought to look around  
In times when more is less  
I'm guilty  
Guilty of lovin' you  
'Cause I need you  
Yes and I want you  
You know you always bring me through  
I'm guilty  
And if you want to know  
You really let me down  
But I won't never let you go  
There's something in my heart keeps sayin'  
There's something in my heart that's sayin'  
You're guilty of lovin' too  
And you need me  
Yes and you want me  
And I won't never let you down  
There's something in my heart keeps sayin'  
There's something in my heart that's sayin'  
You're guilty of lovin' too  
I'm guilty
