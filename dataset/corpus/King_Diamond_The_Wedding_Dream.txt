My Mother is entering My dream now  
She's wearing a wedding dress  
Something's wrong with the way she walks the aisle  
I think it's her legs  
  
Suddenly there is someone else beside her  
That man I recognize  
The Doctor intends to marry Mother  
It's got to be stopped  
  
Now what have I done  
My Mother's on the floor and the Doctor's gone  
Everything is wrong  
And as I keep the axe I wonder what's to come  
  
I'm caught within a dream there's no way out  
I can't escape  
If only I could see the light of day  
I might escape the dream  
The wedding dream  
Oh the dream  
  
Now everything turns to darkness  
Deep within I feel like I'm going blind  
There is a light at the end of this starless nightmare  
Someone's calling, guiding me back inside  
The dream  
No  
  
Get away from him Mother  
You better stop kissing, 'cause he's an enemy  
Take at look at his hand  
He's got the key to my house, the Doctor is the devil  
  
I'm caught within a dream there's no way out  
I can't escape  
If only I could see the light of day  
I might escape the dream  
The wedding dream  
Oh the dream  
  
Dream, the wedding dream  
Oh the dream  
  
Now everything turns to darkness  
Deep within I feel like I'm going blind  
There is a light at the end of this starless nightmare  
Someone's screaming: "Help me please" And it's Me  
  
At sunrise I woke up in a sweat  
The nightmare was gone  
The dream I was sent is fading slowly  
I do not understand
