Somewhere there's music, how faint the tune  
Somewhere there's heaven, how high the moon  
There is no moon above and love is far away too  
Till it comes true  
That you love me and I love you  
  
Somewhere there's music, how near how far  
Somewhere there's heaven, that's where you are  
  
[Chorus]  
The darkest night would shine if you would come to me soon  
Until you will, I'll still my heart, how high the moon  
  
Somewhere there's music, how faint the tune  
Somewhere there's heaven, how high the moon  
  
[Chorus: x2]
