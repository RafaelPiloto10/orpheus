Frank Sinatra died today  
I came home and found my mama crying  
The tv had so much to say  
Somehow I was thinking about dying  
I'm seventeen and thinking about dying  
I don't want to live forever  
Just want to know that I'm alive  
Don't want to live forever  
Just until the day I die  
I see my daddy in his chair  
He sits there night and day  
The tv still looks good as new  
Daddy's old and gray  
And it's scaring me to death  
I don't want to go that way  
I don't want to live forever  
Just want to know that I'm alive  
Don't want to live forever  
Just until the day I die  
Just because your heart's still beating  
It don't mean that you're alive  
Don't want to live forever  
Nobody lives forever  
Gonna live while I'm alive  
You can see the glass half-empty  
You can see the glass half-full  
But all I see are shattered dreams  
Around this neighborhood  
My brother's girlfriend's pregnant  
And today she's moving in  
My friends all play the lottery  
And swear one day they'll win  
I'm seventeen, I'm thinking about dying  
I'm seventeen, no way I'm dying  
Don't want to live forever  
Just want to know that I'm alive  
Don't want to live forever  
Just until the day I die  
Just because you're breathing  
It don't mean that you're alive  
Don't want to live forever  
Nobody lives forever  
I don't want to live forever  
Nobody lives forever  
Don't want to live forever  
I don't want to live forever  
Nobody lives forever  
I don't want to live forever  
Don't want to live forever  
I don't want to live forever  
Nobody lives forever  
I don't want to live forever  
Nobody lives forever  
I don't want to live forever
