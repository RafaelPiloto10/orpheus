I know you been runnin' around  
I know what you been sayin'  
I treat you wrong, keep lettin' you down  
I'm not giving what I'm taking  
So hurt...deep inside  
You say ther's nothin' to it  
But my eyes are open wide  
And I don't know why you do it  
You say I cheated, you say that I lied  
People tell ya I'm taking you for a ride  
Oh but baby they lied...  
  
Give you my love, I'll give you all of my time  
Just to keep you satisfied  
It's never enough until it's over the time  
So you're livin' on the wild side  
Undercover lovers late at night  
Won't take the pain away...  
Two wrongs don't make a right  
But you wanna make me pay  
I know, love can be real  
You're not the only one whose got a bad deal  
I know just how you, oh yeah  
Miss mistreated .. whose mistreatin' who...  
You think it's me...i think it's you...yes I do  
Miss mistreated  
Miss mistreated  
Miss mistreated  
Miss mistreated  
  
I wanna know...love can be real  
You're not the only one whose got a bad deal  
I know how you feel...ooh  
Miss mistreated...whose mistreatin who...  
You think it's me...i think it's you...yes I do  
  
Miss mistreated...  
Miss mistreated...so wrong...  
Miss mistreated...  
Miss mistreated...  
I never meant to hurt you baby  
Miss mistreated...  
I never meant to hurt you baby  
Miss mistreated...  
  
Repeat till fade
