I'm forgiven, because You were forsaken  
I'm accepted, You were condemned  
I'm alive and well, Your Spirit is within me  
Because You died and rose again  
  
I'm forgiven, because You were forsaken  
I'm accepted, You were condemned  
I'm alive and well, Your Spirit is within me  
Because You died and rose again  
  
Amazing love, how can it be  
That You my King would die for me  
Amazing love, I know it's true  
It's my joy to honor You  
Amazing love, how can it be  
That You my King would die for me  
Amazing love, I know it's true  
It's my joy to honor You  
In all I do I honor You  
  
I'm forgiven, because You were forsaken  
I'm accepted, You were condemned  
I'm alive and well, Your Spirit is within me  
Because You died and rose again
