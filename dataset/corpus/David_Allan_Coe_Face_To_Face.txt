Face to face, toe to toe  
Where we'll stop, heaven knows  
Arm in arm, cheek to cheek  
Whose to blame?  
  
Hand in hand, heart to heart  
We never should have let it start  
But it's too late, we shared it all  
Now it's time to share the blame  
  
I can feel your body tremble  
As I hold you in my arms  
For you know, another woman has my name  
Now she knows it's you and me  
But she don't want to set me free  
We've shared it all, now it's time to share the blame  
  
Face to face, toe to toe  
Where we'll stop, heaven knows  
Arm in arm, cheek to cheek  
Whose to blame?  
  
Hand in hand, heart to heart  
We never should have let it start  
But it's too late, we shared it all  
Now it's time to share the blame  
  
Face to face, toe to toe  
Where we'll stop, heaven knows  
Arm in arm, cheek to cheek  
Whose to blame?  
  
Hand in hand, heart to heart  
We never should have let it start  
But it's too late, we shared it all  
Now it's time to share the blame  
  
Face to face, toe to toe  
Where we'll stop
