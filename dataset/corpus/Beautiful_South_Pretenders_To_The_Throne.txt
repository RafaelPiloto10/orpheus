Is it Cologne with it's great cathedral? Milan with it's glamour and it's
pace? London with it's river and it's bridges? Lisbon with it's beauty and
it's grace? Funny looking buses Climb it's pot-bellied hills And a solitary
jogger Times the time he kills Do you know where I'm gonna go? None of you
have guessed, so none of you can know If you've been, that's not where I mean
It's got class and it's got excellence like you've never seen Your town is
dragging me down Dragging me down, down, down Your town is dragging me down
Dragging me down, down, down Is it Dublin with it's culture and it's wit?
Madrid with it's market square? Paris with it's bustling cafes? Hull with it's
musical flair? Do you know where I'm gonna go? None of you have guessed so
none of you can know If you've been, that's not where I mean It's got class
and it's got excellence like you've never seen Your town is dragging me down
Is dragging me down, down, down Your town is dragging me down Is dragging me
down, down, down As I watch them drop the grain into your fish tank brain How
can you like this place when it never even rains? Never even rains Your town
is dragging me down Is dragging me down, down, down Your town is dragging me
down Is dragging me down, down, down Is dragging me down, down, down Is
dragging me down, down, down Is dragging me down, down, down
