I'm so tired of workin' everyday  
Now the weekend's come, I'm gonna throw my troubles away  
If you've got the cab fare, Mister, you'll do alright  
I want to see the bright lights tonight  
  
Meet me at the station don't be late  
I need to spend some money and it just won't wait  
Take me to the dance and hold me tight  
I want to see the bright lights tonight  
  
There's crazy people runnin' all over town  
There's a silver band just marchin' up and down  
And the big boys are all spoilin' for a fight  
I want to see the bright lights tonight  
  
Meet me at the station don't be late  
I need to spend some money and it just won't wait  
Take me to the dance and hold me tight  
I want to see the bright lights tonight  
  
A couple of drunken nights rollin' on the floor  
Is just the kind of mess I'm looking for  
I'm gonna dream till Monday comes in sight  
I want to see the bright lights tonight  
  
Meet me at the station don't be late  
I need to spend some money and it just won't wait  
Take me to the dance and hold me tight  
I want to see the bright lights tonight  
  
Take me to the dance and hold me tight  
I want to see the bright lights tonight
