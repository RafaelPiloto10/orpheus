I'm standing, standing in for Joe  
  
Joe called round to ask me, Would I do a favor?  
While he's gonna be out of town  
He says his girl needs company, she gets so restless  
Would I keep her safe and sound?  
  
Softly, softly in the night  
Why, you can guess the rest...  
Now these shoes fit all too well  
  
Standing in for Joe  
Standing in for Joe  
I'm standing - in for Joe  
  
Joe said we've been friends so long  
That I would be the one he would trust with his life  
And now those words roll 'round my brain  
As darkness falls, as I turn out his bedroom light  
  
Who could resist her tender charms?  
So the story goes...  
This actor he plays all the parts  
  
Standing in for Joe  
Standing in for Joe  
I'm standing - in for Joe  
  
Love is like a river,  
You cannot stop its flow... Mmm hmm  
  
Joe called round to ask me, Would I do a favor?  
While he's gonna be out of town  
He says his girl needs company, she gets so restless  
Would I check that she's safe and sound?  
  
Softly, softly in the night  
Why, you can guess the rest...  
Now these shoes fit all too well  
Standing in for Joe  
  
I'm standing in for Joe - Oh yeah  
I'm standing in for Joe - Keep his sweetheart company, yeah  
  
Standing in for Joe - Just standing in for Joe, yeah  
Standing in for Joe - Until he gets back home, yeah  
Standing in for Joe - Gonna keep her insane, yeah  
Standing in for Joe - Gonna keep her safe and sound, yeah  
  
Standing in for Joe - Keep his sweetheart company, yeah  
Standing in for Joe - Almost full time, which is nice, yeah  
Standing in for Joe - Because she gets so restless  
Standing in for Joe - Always so restless  
  
Standing in for Joe - Keep his sweetheart company, yeah  
Standing in for Joe - Gonna keep her safe and sound, yeah  
Standing in for Joe - I'm standing in for Joe, yeah...
