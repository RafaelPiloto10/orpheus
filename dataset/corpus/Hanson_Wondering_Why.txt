I'm wondering why...  
  
Once again I'm playing  
Lies are all you're saying  
Got me wondering why  
Just wondering why  
While you're on the breaking  
Feel my spirit sinking  
Got me wondering why  
Just wondering why  
  
With all the time you're wasting  
Maybe you can just make up your mind  
  
There's nowhere to run  
There's nowhere to hide  
You're driving me crazy baby  
So you better decide  
You better decide  
  
There's nowhere  
  
What it takes to see there's something wrong  
You got me wondering why  
Just wondering why  
It was a sunny day but you brought all the rain  
You got me wondering why  
Just wondering why  
  
With all the time you're wasting  
Maybe you can just make up your mind  
  
There's nowhere to run  
There's nowhere to hide  
You're driving me crazy baby  
So you better decide  
You better decide  
  
There's nowhere to run  
So you better decide  
  
There's nowhere to run  
  
With all the time you're wasting  
Maybe you can just make up your mind  
  
There's nowhere to run  
There's nowhere to hide  
You're driving me crazy baby  
So you better decide  
  
There's nowhere to run  
There's nowhere to hide  
You're driving me crazy baby  
So you better decide
