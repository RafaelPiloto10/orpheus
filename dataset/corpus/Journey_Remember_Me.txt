Find myself all alone  
In darkness without you  
Now I can't turn away  
From what I must do  
You know I'd give my life for you  
More than words can say  
I've shown you how to love someone  
I know you'll find a way  
  
Say goodbye  
Close your eyes  
Remember me  
Walk away  
The sun remains  
Remember me  
  
I'll live on somewhere in your heart  
You must believe  
Remember me  
  
No way I can change my mind  
I don't have the answers  
If you could see through my eyes  
You'd let go of your fears  
And though I have to leave you now  
With the thought of each other  
I miss your touch  
You call my name  
I am with you forever  
  
Say goodbye  
Close your eyes  
Remember me  
Walk away  
The sun remains  
Remember me  
  
With the change we can't explain  
Remember me  
  
I'll live on somewhere in your heart  
You must believe  
Remember me  
  
You know I'd give my life for you  
More than words can say  
I showed you how to love someone  
I know you'll find a way  
  
Say goodbye  
Close your eyes  
Remember me  
Walk away  
The sun remains  
Remember me  
  
Be there to watch over you  
Remember me  
Feel I'm gone  
My heart lives on  
Remember me  
  
Don't you think of this as the end  
I'll come into your dreams  
Remember me  
  
Close your eyes....  
Say goodbye....  
Remember me  
Say you will  
Say you will  
Say you will  
  
Close your eyes  
Remember me  
Say you will  
Say you will  
Say you will  
  
Say goodbye  
Remember me
