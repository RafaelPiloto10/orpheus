If your heart is restless and you can't go on  
When you're tired and weary, but you can't go on  
Well a distant dream is a callin' you  
Then there's just one thing that you can do  
  
Yeah, you gotta follow that dream wherever that dream may lead you  
You gotta follow that dream wherever that dream may lead  
  
Now if I walk in dreams  
And if I talk in dreams  
I need someone with a love I can trust  
And together we'll search for the things that come to us  
Baby in dreams, in dreams  
  
Now every man has the right to live  
The right to a chance to give what he has to give  
The right to fight for the things he believes  
For the things that come to him in dreams  
  
Baby in dreams, I walk in dreams  
I talk in dreams  
I live in dreams
