Money just changed everything, I wonder how life without it would go  
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow  
Lookin' down from the top and its crowded below  
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago  
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant sh!t  
When I hear talkin', I just don't know what to make of it  
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it  
Doesn't come natural, bear with me it could take a bit  
Yeah, and my dreams who I'm racing with  
You can see I'm pacin' it so that I'm always chasin' it  
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with  
I hope that my success never alters our relationship  
Yeah, this life is something I would die for  
Octobers Own, but its lookin' like July 4th  
I just wish they'd let you try it first  
This time I'm really goin' off, fireworks  
  
Today it begins  
I missed them before, but won't miss them again  
I keep having the same dream  
And I think I just realized what it means.  
  
All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks  
Every night its fireworks every night its fireworks  
All I see is fireworks all I see is fireworks  
Taking off like fireworks takin' off like oh-ah-oh-oh  
  
I'm just such a gentleman you should give it up for me  
Look at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery  
I can tell it wasn't love I just thought you fuck with me  
Who coulda predicted love could strike now you stuck with me  
Damn I kept my wits about me luckily  
What happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me  
Now all of a sudden these gossip brags wanna cover me  
And you making it seem that it happened that way because of me  
But I was curious and I'll never forget it baby  
What an experience you coulda been the one but it wasn't that serious  
Their was smoke in the air before now its me clearing it  
That felt good, all and all I learned a lesson from it though  
You never see it coming you just get to see it go  
Yeah I shoulda looked up in the sky at first  
Now I can see it in her eyes, fireworks!  
  
Today it begins  
I missed them before, but won't miss them again  
I keep having the same dream  
And I think I just realized what it means.  
  
All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks  
Every night its fireworks every night its fireworks  
All I see is fireworks all I see is fireworks  
Taking off like fireworks takin' off like oh-ah-oh-oh  
  
Everything the same but it feels different  
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen  
And he's still got his foot out, guilt trippin'  
It's been years, though, I just learn to deal with it  
For real, me and my realtor we built up a better rapport  
Got my mother in a place with some better decor  
She searched the entire city I let her explore  
Ant now she's sayin' she's more lonely than every before  
How many of our parents' marriages lasted?  
I was only five, I bet I barely reacted  
I'm flying back home for the heritage classic  
Searchin' for that feeling, tell me where is the magic?  
Let's stay together 'til we're ghosts  
I want to witness love, I've never seen it close  
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first  
That's why I'm really going off, Fireworks  
  
Today it begins  
I missed them before, but won't miss them again  
I keep having the same dream  
And I think I just realized what it means.  
  
All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks  
Every night its fireworks every night its fireworks  
All I see is fireworks all I see is fireworks  
Taking off like fireworks takin' off like oh-ah-oh-oh
