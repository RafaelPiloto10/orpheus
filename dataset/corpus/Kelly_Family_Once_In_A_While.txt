Once in a while I see you  
Once in a while I don't.  
And when I when I see you  
I feel like flying over,  
Flying over the clouds oh yeah  
  
Oh, I want to do something for you,  
I could fix your broken shoe,  
I don't want to hide.  
Oh, I want to help you find the clue,  
So that we save our own few,  
I don't want to hide.  
  
I wanted to buy you some flowers,  
I went downtown, the shops were closed.  
But when I saw you smilin',  
I felt like flying over,  
Flying over the clouds. Oh, yeah!  
Oh, I want to do something for you  
Just tell me what to do.  
I don't want to hide.  
But I know that you'll be leaving soon  
But I never will forget you.  
I don't want to hide.  
  
Why will it take so long  
Until I can see you again. [Repeat: x 2]  
And you know  
It's just a dream. Oh, yeah! [Repeat: x 2]  
  
Oh, I want to do something for you...  
Why will it take so long...  
Eh yeah...
