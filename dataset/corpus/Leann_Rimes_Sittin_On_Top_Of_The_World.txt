Never seen a sky so blue  
I've never been happy with anyone  
Like I am when I'm with you  
Look at the sun shining up in the sky  
  
I feel a little closer to heaven baby  
When I'm looking into your eyes  
And as long as we're together boy  
I'm sitting on top of the world  
  
Want to feel this way forever boy  
I'm sitting on top of the world  
Last night I lay in the dark  
Tryin' to figure it out  
  
Tryin' to talk to my heart  
But now it's morning and I still don't know why  
All I know is that you got me feeling so good  
All I know is that it feels the way that true love should  
  
Ain't no one luckier than you and I  
And as long as we're together, boy  
I'm sitting on top of the world  
Want to feel this way forever, boy  
  
I'm sitting on top of the world  
And everybody's got an opinion 'bout how this should be  
But they don't understand it  
No, no they just can't see  
  
That I belong with you and baby Baby  
Baby, you belong with me  
And as long as we're together, boy  
I'm sitting on top of the world  
  
Want to feel this way forever, boy  
I'm sitting on top of the world
