[Chorus:]  
I care about you  
I don't want to push you  
Sharayah  
I care about you  
I don't want to lose you now  
I don't want to lose you now  
Come with me...sharayah.  
Sharayah  
Call his name that is all he's asking  
Let him come down to where you are  
You can have life that's everlasting  
Can't you see this is just the start.  
Tell me, tell me, where do you belong  
I guess you've no idea  
Tell me, tell me, where do you come from (yeah)  
Tell me, tell me, why do you pretend to know.  
Listen to me now  
He loves you  
Listen to me now  
He cares for you  
Listen to me now  
He wants you to come home  
(yeah) Sharayah  
(repeat chorus twice)  
Come with me...sharayah  
Come with me...sharayah  
Come with me...sharayah  
Come with me...sharayah  
Sharayah  
Sharayah.
