You can buy a diamond ring  
And slip it on my hand  
Put me on a big ol' plane  
And fly me to a foreign land  
  
Show me rows of fancy clothes  
Saying, Honey you can take your pick!  
Well, that would be mighty kind  
But it ain't gonna do the trick  
  
[Chorus]  
Give a little love  
A squeeze and a little kiss  
Give a little hug  
Mmm, I want some more of this  
Take a little time  
Yeah, make a little fuss  
That's what a woman wants  
So give a little love  
  
Get this, you can be some big hunk  
Handsome, dark and tall  
Talk to me in foreign tongues  
Or with a southern drawl  
  
Or be a man from old Siam  
Wear a pointed hat  
I don't care how you look  
'Cause that ain't where it's at  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, there are men who'll turn your head  
And knock you off of your feet  
Sweet talk and big blue eyes  
Make a poor heart skip a beat  
  
Drive you wild with a smile  
And then they'll treat you cruel  
Well, I ain't gonna fall for that  
'Cause Mama didn't raise no fool  
  
[Chorus]
