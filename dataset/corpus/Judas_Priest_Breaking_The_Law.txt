[Verse 1]  
There I was completely wasting  
Out of work and down  
All inside, it's so frustrating  
As I drift from town to town  
Feel as though nobody cares  
If I live or die  
So I might as well begin  
To put some action in my life!  
  
[Chorus]  
Breaking the law, breaking the law  
Breaking the law, breaking the law  
Breaking the law, breaking the law  
Breaking the law, breaking the law  
  
[Verse 2]  
So much for the golden future  
I can't even start  
I've had every promise broken  
There's anger in my heart  
You don't know what it's like  
You don't have a clue  
If you did you'd find yourselves  
Doing the same thing too!  
  
[Chorus]  
Breaking the law, breaking the law  
Breaking the law, breaking the law  
Breaking the law, breaking the law  
Breaking the law, breaking the law  
  
[Bridge guitar solo 1]  
You don't know what it's like!  
(Sirens blare)  
  
[Bridge guitar solo 2]  
  
[Chorus x2]  
Breaking the law, breaking the law  
Breaking the law, breaking the law  
Breaking the law, breaking the law  
Breaking the law, breaking the law
