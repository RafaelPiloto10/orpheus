I am a lonely painter  
I live in a box of paints  
I used 2 be frightened by the devil  
And drawn 2 those who weren't afraid  
Remember when you told me  
That love was touching souls?  
Well, surely you touched mine  
Part of you pours out of me from time 2 time in these lines  
U're in my blood like holy wine... U're so bitter and so sweet  
I could drink a case of you darling  
And still b on my feet... Still be on my feet
