In every life there are detours on dirt gravel roads,  
Sometimes it feels like there's just no right way to go,  
There'll be times you'll go crazy,  
And times you'll break down,  
Always something that stands in your way  
  
[Chorus]  
Just keep your eyes on me  
Never lose site of me  
This love  
Nothing can come between  
Us when we're following  
This love  
  
This love  
  
Everybody is bound to feel lost now and then,  
But I'll be the one thing, that'll be there For you 'til the end,  
Through good days and bad  
The ups and the downs  
Don't you ever let go of your dreams,  
Oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Bridge:  
I'll be your northern star  
When everything's dark  
I will shine for you  
Shine for you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just keep your eyes on me  
Never lose site of me  
This love  
Nothing can come between  
Us when we're following  
This love  
Oh uh-huh  
Oh  
This love
