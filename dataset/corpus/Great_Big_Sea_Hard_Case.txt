She goes down fast and comes up slow  
Gets in high and goes out low  
Turns up late or doesn't show  
She spends all her cash on letting go  
I'm never early  
I'm never late  
I'm in at 5 and out at 8  
Running just to keep the pace  
When I'm tired I put on my bravest face  
The sign said "Go Slow"  
And lord knows how I tried to follow  
Such a hard case with a soft face  
You gave me one taste,  
Now look at the shape I'm in  
I love her but I like you too  
My worst nightmare just came true  
We might be done but we're not through  
So drag me down just like you used to do  
Hold me down under the sea  
Drag me back to where we used to be  
With the morning comes the the sun  
The light of day just had to come  
Now I know you're not the one  
Should feel bad but baby we had fun
