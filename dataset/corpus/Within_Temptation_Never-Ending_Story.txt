Armies have conquered  
And fallen in the end  
Kingdoms have risen  
Then buried by sand  
The earth is our mother  
She gives and she takes  
She puts us to sleep and  
In her light we'll awake  
We'll all be forgotten  
There's no endless fame  
But everything we do  
It's never in vain  
  
We're part of a story  
Part of a tale  
We're all on this journey  
No one's to stay  
Where is it going  
What is the way  
  
Forests and deserts  
Rivers, blue seas  
Mountains and valleys  
Nothing here stays  
While we think we witness  
We're part of the scene  
This never-ending story  
Where will it lead to  
The earth is our mother  
She gives and she takes  
But she is also a part  
A part of the tale  
  
We're part of a story  
Part of a tale  
We're all on this journey  
No one's to stay  
Where is it going  
What is the way  
  
We're part of a story  
Part of a tale  
Sometimes beautiful  
Sometimes insane  
No one remembers how it began  
  
We're part of a story  
Part of a tale  
We're all on this journey  
No one's to stay  
Where is it going  
What is the way  
  
We're part of a story  
Part of a tale  
Sometimes beautiful  
Sometimes insane  
No one remembers how it began
