Stay with me only if your heart is free,  
There's no sense if we can't see beyond how we feel.  
Honestly, how do we know what we need?  
What can we believe?, help me to know this is real.  
(CHORUS)  
If I give it all, if I give it all away.  
We could have it all, we could have it all this way.  
I should have said what I was thinking  
Followed my heart, but it was sinking.  
If you love me say that you love me,  
I'll say I love you too.  
If you love me say that you need me,  
I'll give my love to you.  
Broken dreams are never really what they seem,  
Somewhere in between you can give all your troubles to me.  
I don't know how far we are meant to go,  
If you tell me so that is where I want to be.  
(CHORUS)  
If I give it all, if I give it all away.  
We could have it all, we could have it all this way.  
I should have said what I was thinking  
Followed my heart, but it was sinking.  
If you love me say that you love me,  
I'll say I love you too.  
If you love me say that you need me,  
I'll give my love to you.  
If you love me say that you love me,  
I'll say I love you too.  
If you love me say that you need me,  
I'll give my love to you.  
I'll give my love to you.
