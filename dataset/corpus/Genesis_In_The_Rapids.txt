Moving down the water  
John is drifting out of sight,  
Its only at the turning point  
That you find out how you fight.  
  
In the cold, feel the cold  
All around  
And the rush of crashing water  
Surrounds me with its sound.  
  
Striking out to reach you  
I can't get through to the other side,  
When you're racing in the rapids  
There's only one way, that's to ride.  
  
Taken down, taken down  
By the undertow  
I'm spiralled down the river bed,  
My fire is burning low.  
Catching hold of a rock that's firm,  
I'm waiting for John to be carried past.  
We hold together, hold together  
And shoot the rapids fast.  
  
And when the waters slow down  
The dark and the deep have no-one, no-one, no-one, no-one, no-one left to
keep.  
Hang on John! We're out of this at last.  
Somethings changed, that's not your face. It's mine - it's mine!
