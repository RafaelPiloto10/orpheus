Why the eagle flies  
When the wind blows in his eyes  
And he goes no where just to feel good  
  
You don't know the reason  
Our love is like a season  
Breaking down and building up again  
  
Why you hold me up  
When I feel like falling down  
Is the love you have that makes me feel good  
  
Ah  
You make it easy  
Take it slow  
Well, I was hurtin inside and you gave me a second chance  
  
Ah  
You take it easy  
When you let it go  
I was hurtin inside  
  
Time rides all alone  
When you're left back on your own  
But I know you're always there to lean on  
  
Look beyond the  
And you'll find my love in check  
It's all the love I have  
Love I give to you  
  
Ah  
You make it easy  
Take it slow  
Well, I was hurtin inside and you gave me a second chance  
  
Ah  
You take it easy  
When you let it go  
I was hurtin inside  
  
Why the eagle flies  
When the wind blows in his eyes  
And he goes no where just to feel good  
  
Time rides all alone  
When you're left back on your own  
But I know you're always there to lean on  
  
You don't know the reasons  
Our love is like the seasons  
Breaking down and building up again  
  
Ah  
You make it easy  
Take it slow  
Well, I was hurtin inside and you gave me a second chance  
  
Ah  
You take it easy  
When you let it go  
I was hurtin inside  
  
Ah  
You make it easy  
Take it slow  
Well, I was hurtin inside and you gave me a second chance  
  
Ah  
You take it easy  
When you let it go  
I was hurtin inside
