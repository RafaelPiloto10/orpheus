Driving all night too many miles to go  
Pedal tot he metal listenin' to the radio  
I got three days to get from Cheyenne to San Antone  
That's the life of a cowboy ridin' the rodeo  
  
My back side's sore and I'm movin' kinda slow  
But when I hit Okie City there's a barrel racer that I know  
A little home cookin' and some lovin' to heal my bones  
That's the life of a cowboy ridin' the rodeo  
  
Ride cowboy ride hold on for your life  
Eight seconds is a long long time when you're sitting on dynamite  
You can't make money buddy if get thrown  
That's the life of a cowboy ridin' the rodeo  
  
Well I might get lucky down in San Antone  
Find a little Texas girl I could call my own  
That lone star lovin's the best I've ever known  
That's the life of a cowboy ridin' the rodeo  
  
Ride cowboy ride hold on for your life  
Eight seconds is a long long time when you're sitting on dynamite  
You can't make money buddy if get thrown  
That's the life of a cowboy ridin' the rodeo  
  
That's the life of a cowboy ridin' the rodeo
