Hey have you ever tried  
Really reaching out for the other side?  
I may be climbing on rainbows  
But baby, here goes  
Dreams, they are for those who sleep  
Life is for us to keep  
And if you're wondering what this song is leading to,  
I wanna to make it with you  
  
I really think that we could make it, girl  
  
Though you don't know me well  
With every little thing only time will tell  
If you believe the things that I do,  
And we'll see it through  
Life can be short or long  
Love can be right or wrong  
And if I chose the one I'd like to help me through  
I'd like to make it with you  
  
I really think that we could make it, girl  
  
Baby you know that dreams their for those who sleep  
Life it's for us to keep  
And if I chose the one I'd like to help me through  
I'd like to make it with you  
  
I really think that we can make it, girl
