Fantine:  
Cosette, it's turned so cold  
Cosette, it's past your bedtime  
You've played the day away, and soon it will be night  
  
Come to me, Cosette the light is fading  
Don't you see the evening star appearing?  
Come to me, and rest against my shoulder  
How fast the minutes fly away and every minute colder.  
Hurry near, another day is dying  
Don't you hear, the winter wind is crying?  
There's a darkness which comes without a warning  
But I will sing you lullabies and wake you in the morning.  
  
Valjean:  
Oh Fantine, your time is running out  
But Fantine, I swear this on my life  
  
Fantine:  
Look M'sieur, where all the children play...  
  
Valjean:  
Be at peace  
Be at peace evermore  
  
Fantine:  
My Cosette...  
  
Valjean:  
Shall live in my protection  
  
Fantine:  
Take her now...  
  
Valjean:  
Your child will want for nothing  
  
Fantine:  
Good M'sieur, you come from God in heaven  
  
Valjean:  
And none will ever harm Cosette as long as I am living  
  
Fantine:  
Take my hand, the night grows ever colder  
  
Valjean:  
And I will keep you warm  
  
Fantine:  
Take my child, I give her to your keeping  
  
Valjean:  
Take shelter from the storm  
  
Fantine:  
For God's sake, please stay 'till I am sleeping  
And tell Cosette I love her, and I'll see her when I wake...
