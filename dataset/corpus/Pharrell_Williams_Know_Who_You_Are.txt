[Refrain x2: Pharrell]  
I know who you are, and I know what you're feelin'  
  
[Verse 1: Pharrell]  
Bad day, at work, crazy boss, crazy or worse  
Finger, pointin', but they, they depend on you  
Inhale, exhale, in and out, like a seal  
No no, aw yes, smile honey, no stress  
  
[Chorus: Pharrell]  
[?] seems to get brighter  
Now it's good  
And the situation doesn't seem that bad  
Now it's good  
Can you imagine this started with a lighter?  
Now it's good  
Perception that you never had  
Now it's good  
  
[Refrain: Alicia Keys]  
I know who you are, and I know what you're feelin'  
  
[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]  
Say your name, enclave, to live life, on the edge  
Want you to know, I see, the power, is in me  
No more, [?], standin' up, with no stress  
I will do, what I need, 'til every woman on the Earth is free  
  
[Chorus: Alicia Keys]  
  
[Refrain x2: Alicia Keys]  
  
[Bridge:]  
Let me tell you all one time  
I don't mind  
I know what you're feelin'  
Feelin', feelin'  
  
[Refrain: Alicia Keys]  
  
[Verse 3: Pharrell]  
And girl don't let them tell you that you don't deserve to unwind  
And if they don't want to join us, cool, but it's our time  
We just shake our heads, and dance, the moment so surreal  
Isn't it sad? There's people in this world that don't know how this feels  
  
[Refrain x4: Both]  
I know who you are, and I know what you're feelin'
