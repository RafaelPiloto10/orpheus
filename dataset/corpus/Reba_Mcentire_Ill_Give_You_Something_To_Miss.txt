Well there's a half moon starlit sky.  
All the conditions are just right.  
Our song's playing on the  
radio. Every beat of my heart is saying just let go.  
'Cause when you're holding me this way.  
It's all I can do to just think straight.  
A little voice in my head is saying not so fast.  
If you really want this love to last.  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm gonna catch my breath.  
I'm gonna count to ten.  
I'm gonna leave you wonderin' when you'll see me again.  
I'm gonna say goodnight with one passionate kiss.  
And leave you with the strongest feeling there is.  
I'll give you something to miss.  
  
I'm not doin' something I'll regret.  
I'm playing it just hard enough to get.  
I'm gonna give you a little space.  
And let you enjoy the thrill of the chase.  
  
[Chorus: x2]
