Wildcat kelley, lookin' mighty pale,  
Was standin' by the sherrif's side  
And when the sherrif said "i'm sendin you to jail,  
Wildcat raised his head and cried  
  
Oh, give me land, lots of land under starry skies above,  
Don't fence me in.  
Let me ride through the wide open country that i love,  
Don't fence me in.  
Let me be by myself in the evenin' breeze,  
Listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees,  
Send me off forever but i ask you please,  
Don't fence me in.  
  
Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle  
Underneath the western skies.  
On my cayuse, let me wander over yonder  
Till i see the mountains rise.  
  
I want to ride to the ridge where the west commences  
Gaze at the moon till i lose my senses  
I can't look at hobbles and i can't stand fences  
Don't fence me in.  
  
Wildcat kelley, back again in town,  
Was standin by his sweethearts side,  
And when his sweetheart said "come on let's settle down,  
Wildcat raised his head and cried  
  
Oh, give me land, lots of land under starry skies,  
Don't fence me in.  
Let me ride through the wide open country that i love,  
Don't fence me in.  
Let me be by myself in the evenin' breeze  
Listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees  
Send me off forever but i ask you please,  
Don't fence me in  
  
Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle  
Underneath the western skies  
On my cayuse, let me wander over yonder  
Till i see the mountains rise.  
  
I want to ride to the ridge where the west commences  
Gaze at the moon till i lose my senses  
I can't look at hobbles and i can't stand fences  
Don't..... fence me in.
