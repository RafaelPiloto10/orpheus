Precious memories, flood my soul  
  
Precious memories, unseen angels  
Sent from somewhere to my soul  
How they linger ever near me  
And the sacred past unfolds  
  
Precious father and loving mother  
Fly across the lonely years  
And old home scenes of my childhood  
In fond memories appear  
  
As I travel on life's pathway  
Know not what the years may hold  
As I ponder, hope grows fonder  
Precious memories flood my soul  
  
In the stillness of the midnight  
Echo's from the past I hear  
Old time singing, gladness bringing  
From that lovely land somewhere  
  
Precious memories, how they linger  
How they ever flood my soul  
In the stillness of the midnight  
Precious sacred seems unfold  
  
Precious memories, how they linger  
How they ever flood my soul  
In the stillness of the midnight  
Precious sacred seems unfold
