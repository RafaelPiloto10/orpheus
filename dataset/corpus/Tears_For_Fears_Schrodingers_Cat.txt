Last train to Norwich  
Summer days that blind your face will soon be dead and gone  
Better get it on  
Tuned to a day the babe against the world  
You took the best seat rather risk it when the chips were down  
Better make it long.  
Schrodinger's cat is dead to the world.  
  
You say your cat sees in the dark.  
You criticize the play and isolate the box.  
I always knew you were a scientist at heart.  
Just as the breeze with speed and build, you sat upon the fence,  
Clucking like a chicken making perfect sense.  
  
Pass that gun, hand me that knife,  
Man's little monster has been brought back to life.  
  
You say your cat sees in the dark.  
You criticize the flow and isolate the box.  
I always knew you were a scientist at heart.  
I always knew you were.
