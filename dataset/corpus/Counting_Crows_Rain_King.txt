When I think of heaven (Deliver me in a black-winged bird)  
I think of flying down into a sea of pens and feathers  
and all other instruments of faith and sex and God  
In the belly of a black-winged bird  
Don't try to feed me  
I've been here before and I deserve a little more  
  
I belong in the service of the Queen I belong anywhere but in between  
She's been crying I've been thinking And I am the Rain King  
  
Mama, why am I so alone?  
I can't go outside  
I'm scared I might not make it home  
I'm alive but I'm sinking in  
If there's anyone at home at your place  
Why don't you invite me in  
Don't try to bleed me  
I've been there before and I deserve a little more  
  
I belong in the service of the Queen  
I belong anywhere but in between  
She's been lying  
I've been sinking  
And I am the Rain King  
  
Hey, I only want the same as anyone  
Henderson is waiting for the sun  
Oh, it seems night endlessly begins and ends  
After all the dreaming I come home again...  
  
When I think of heaven (Deliver me in a black-winged bird)  
I think of dying Lay me down in a field of flame and heather  
Render up my body into the burning heart of God in the belly of a black-winged  
bird  
Don't try to bleed me  
I've been here before and I deserve a little more  
  
I belong in the service of the Queen  
I belong anywhere but in between  
She's been dying  
I been drinking and I am the Rain King.
