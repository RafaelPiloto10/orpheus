I'd wait for you  
I'd slave for you  
I'd be a beggar  
Or a knave for you  
If that isn't love  
It will have to do  
Until the real thing  
Comes along  
  
I'd gladly move  
The earth for you  
To prove my love, dear  
And its worth for you  
I that isn't love  
It will have to do  
Until the real thing  
Comes along  
  
With all the words  
Dear, at my command  
I just can't make  
You understand  
I'll always love you  
Darling  
Come what may  
My heart is yours  
What more can I say?  
  
I'd lie for you  
I'd sigh for you  
I'd tear the stars  
Down  
From the sky for you  
If that isn't love  
It will have to do  
Until the real thing  
Comes along  
  
With all the words  
Dear, at my command  
I just can't make  
You understand  
I'll always  
Love you baby  
Come what may  
My heart is yours  
What more can I say?  
  
I'd lie for you  
I'd cry for you  
I'd lay my body down  
And die tor you  
If that isn't love  
It will have to do  
Until the real thing  
Comes along
