Doctor, you ain't got a pill  
For whatever's making this world I'll  
You can't get forgiveness at the store  
And peace, it's a politician's war  
You won't find no resolution in the bottom of a bottle  
In the stars or Aristotle  
The only answer to the problem is  
  
People loving people  
That's the enemy of everything that's evil  
Ain't no quick fix at the end of a needle  
It's just people loving people  
  
Words aren't what they seem to be  
Talk is cheap and lies are free  
We fear what we don't understand  
And we've been scared since time began  
All the colors and the cultures  
Circle 'round us on a spindle  
It'd a complicated riddle  
But the solution is so simple  
  
It's people loving people  
That's the enemy of everything that's evil  
Ain't no quick fix at the end of a needle  
It's just people loving people  
  
You can pawn it off on kings and queens  
And those behind the curtain  
Say one can't make a difference  
In a world so full of hurting  
But I believe the remedy  
Starts right here with you and me  
  
People loving people  
That's the enemy of everything that's evil  
Ain't no quick fix at the end of a needle  
It's just people loving people  
It's just people loving people  
It's just people loving people
