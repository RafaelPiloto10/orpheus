We take a lot of things for granted  
One day it' ll be taken away  
That' s when you' ll realize  
How important it was  
You never miss your water  
Till your well runs dry  
Give thanks and praise all the time  
The wolf is always by the door  
  
[Chorus:]  
You don' t know what you' ve got  
Till you lose it all again  
You never miss your water  
Till your well runs dry  
  
He' s a hero, now that he' s dead  
Oh what a bull preacher man talks about him  
When he was alive  
He didn't even know his name  
When he was alive  
He didn't get this love  
You never miss your water  
Till your well runs dry  
  
[Chorus:]  
You don' t know what you' ve got  
Till you lose it again  
You never lose your water  
Till your well runs dry
