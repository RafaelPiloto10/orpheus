I've got a feeling, a feeling deep inside  
Oh yeah, oh yeah.  
I've got a feeling, a feeling I can't hide  
Oh no, oh no, oh no.  
Yeah, I've got a feeling.  
  
Oh please believe me, I'd hate to miss the train  
Oh yeah, oh yeah.  
And if you leave me I won't be late again  
Oh no, oh no, oh no.  
Yeah, I've got a feeling, yeah.  
  
All these years I've been wandering around,  
Wondering how come nobody told me  
All that I was looking for was somebody  
Who looked like you.  
  
I've got a feeling, that keeps me on my toes  
Oh yeah, oh yeah.  
  
I've got a feeling, I think that everybody knows  
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.  
Yeah, yeah, I've got a feeling, yeah.  
Yeah  
  
Ev'rybody had a hard year  
Ev'rybody had a good time  
Ev'rybody had a wet dream,  
Ev'rybody saw the sunshine  
Oh yeah, oh yeah.  
  
Ev'rybody had a good year,  
Ev'rybody let their hair down,  
Ev'rybody pulled their socks up,  
Ev'rybody put their foot down.  
Oh yeah, oh yeah.  
  
Yeah I've got a feeling  
A feeling deep inside  
Oh yeah, oh yeah.  
  
I've got a feeling, a feeling I can't hide  
Oh no  
Oh no no no  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
