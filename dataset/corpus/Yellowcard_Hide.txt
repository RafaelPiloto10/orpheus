Haven't heard from you in days  
I'm spreading thin what I've got taped.  
And I've come down from your highest ties.  
Now what the hell am I supposed to say.  
  
Whoa. I know it feels like I let you down.  
But I'm still around.  
  
If you can't find a way to reach me,  
Take your time I could be underneath you  
And looking up to see you from where we used to hide.  
From where we used to hide.  
  
Busy writing thoughts tonight.  
A message sent with no reply  
You used to hang on my every word.  
Now they never come out right.  
  
Whoa. I know it feels like I let you down.  
But I'm still a round.  
  
If you can't find a way to reach me,  
Take your time I could be underneath you  
And looking up to see you from where we used to hide.  
From where we used to hide.  
  
You are invisible in this. (so invisible in this)  
Your too caught up in what you missed. (caught in what you missed)  
So spend what I gave, I give you more.  
You are invisible in this.  
  
If you can't find a way to reach me,  
Take your time I could be underneath you  
And looking up to see you from where we used to hide.  
From where we used to hide.  
  
If you can't find a way to reach me,  
Take your time cause I am underneath you,  
Looking up to see you from where we used to hide.  
From where we used to hide.
