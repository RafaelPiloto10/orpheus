Well you're just seventeen and all you want to do is disappear  
You know what I mean there's a lot of space between your ears  
The way that you touch don't feel no nothing  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, it was the D.N.A.  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, that made me this way  
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel?  
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel?  
  
Sheer heart attack, Sheer heart attack  
Real cardiac  
  
I feel so in-are in-are in-are in-are in-are in-are in-are in-are-tic-you-late  
Gotta feeling gotta feeling gotta feeling like a paralyze  
It ain't no it ain't no it ain't no it ain't no surprise  
Turn on the TV let it drip right down in your eyes  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, it was the D.N.A.  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, that made me this way  
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel?  
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel?  
  
Sheer heart attack, Sheer heart attack  
Real cardiac  
  
I feel so in-are in-are in-are in-are in-are in-are in-are in-are-tic-you-late  
Just how I feel  
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel?  
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel?  
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel?  
  
Sheer heart attack, Sheer heart attack  
Real cardiac
