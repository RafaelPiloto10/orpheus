This train I'm on is right on time  
In the mornin' I'll be there  
It's been so long since I held her in my arms  
I'm goin' back where I belong  
Where a love will always keep me safe from harm  
This train I'm on is right on time  
Now I know I'm on my way  
I can hear that whistle blow all down the line  
And as the towns go rollin' by  
I can almost smell the wind blow through the pines  
And they'll all be out to meet me  
Cause there's no place where they treat you quite so fine  
  
Well I've been all around and I know there's no place better  
Sun is gonna shine again in my back door  
Each time the wheels go 'round  
I'm closer to the one I've waited for
