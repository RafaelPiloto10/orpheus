If there's a time  
When the tears should fill your eyes  
And you can't see past the shadows  
To the sun on the other side  
Don't despair  
Because there always will be someone there  
Don't lose faith  
Love won't let you lose your way, because you  
  
[Chorus]  
You'll never stand alone  
I'll be standing by  
I'll keep you from the cold  
I'll hold you when you cry  
I'll be there to be strong  
When you can't find the strength inside  
And you, you'll always have a home  
In these arms of mine  
And you'll never stand alone  
Love is standing by  
  
Oh yes it is, yes  
If there's a day when the rain should find your heart  
And you're cold and tired and lonely  
And this world has you in the dark  
Don't be scared  
You can just reach for me  
And I'll be there  
Don't lose hope  
Love will see you through you know  
I'll be, 'cause you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Standing by to life you above  
All the hurt and pain, oh yeah  
Standing by to carry you through  
All the tears and rain  
Oh reach for me  
(I'll be there for you)  
Reach for me babe, yeah  
(I'll see you through)  
See I'll be the one to hold you  
The one to show you that you  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Oh, love is standing by
