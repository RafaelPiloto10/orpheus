I'll be as strong as a mountain,  
Or weak as a willow tree,  
Anyway you want me,  
Well that's how I will be.  
  
I'll be as tame as a baby,  
Or wild as the raging sea,  
Anyway you want me,  
Well that's how I will be.  
  
In your hands my heart is clay,  
To take and hold as you may.  
I'm what you make me, you've only to take me,  
And in your arms I will stay.  
  
I'll be a fool or a wise man,  
My darling you hold the key,  
Yes, anyway you want me,  
Well that's how I will be,  
I will be.
