It can come from out of nowhere  
Hit you when you're safe and warm  
Take it easy my star  
Your time is gonna come  
Your time is gonna come  
  
You got those crazy blue eyes  
Yeah you got those crazy blues  
All those pretty smiles  
I can see them laughing at you  
Your time is gonna come  
Your time is gonna come  
  
I don't want to be your punching bag  
Your complacent little princess  
All tragic and sad  
I'm not going to let you  
Overwhelm me anymore  
No, not anymore  
  
Yeah you say you got this bad thing  
Yeah you say you got it bad  
You have broken every heart  
Of every friend you've ever had  
  
Someday the time is going to come  
When all your friends just go away  
  
I wonder why I stick around  
Sometimes I wish you would leave  
You'll say you'll love me forever  
Then you spit on me  
You time is going to come  
I swear your time is going to come  
  
I don't want to be your whipping boy  
Your pathetic little loser  
Someone you can ignore  
I'm not going to let you overwhelm me  
Anymore (aww)  
  
I'm not going to let you hurt me anymore  
I'm not going to let you hit me anymore  
I'm not going to let you kick me anymore  
  
I will not let you overwhelm me anymore (anymore)  
  
It can come from out of nowhere  
  
I don't want to be your simple saving grace  
Just another little victim with a happy face  
  
Oh, someday (someday)  
Someday (someday)  
Somebody's gonna come  
I hope they do this to you  
  
I'm not going to let you overwhelm me anymore  
  
I will not let you hurt me anymore  
  
I will not let you hit me anymore  
I will not let you twist me anymore  
  
No, I will not let you turn me inside out
