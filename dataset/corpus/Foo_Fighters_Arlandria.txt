Ain't that the way it always starts  
A simple round of conversation  
Became a shameful equation  
I flipped you station to station  
  
Hey, don't go and turn the other way  
Don't say there's nothing more to say  
Come on, hear me out, hush, hush, settle down  
Button up don't make a sound  
  
Shame, shame, go away  
Come again some other day  
You used to say I couldn't save you enough  
So I've been savin' it up, I started savin' it up  
  
And when you said I couldn't give you enough,  
I started givin' you up, I started givin' you up  
You are not me, Arlandria, Arlandria,  
You and what army, Arlandria, Arlandria  
Oh God you gotta make it stop  
  
Chase all of those memories away  
Save them all for another day  
Don't you remember it was rain that drowned you  
  
Wait, I wanna see if you can change  
I wanna keep all I can take  
I feel much better now  
Use me up, spit me out, let me be your hand-me-down  
Fame, fame, go away, come again some other day  
  
You used to say I couldn't save you enough  
So I've been savin' it up, I started savin' it up  
And when you said I couldn't give you enough  
I started givin' you up, I started givin' you up  
You are not me, Arlandria, Arlandria  
You and what army, Arlandria, Arlandria  
Oh God you gotta make it stop  
  
My sweet Virginia  
I'm the same as I was in your arm  
My sweet Virginia  
I'm the same as I was in your arm  
  
Shame, shame go away, come again some other day  
Memories keep haunting me, help me chase them all away  
Hush, now, settle down, button up, don't make a sound  
Close your eyes, turn around, help me burn this to the ground  
Come now, take the blame, that's OK I'll play the game  
I don't care it's all the same, watch it all go up in flames  
Use me up, spit me out, let me be your hand-me-down  
Fame, fame, go away, come again some other day  
  
You used to say I couldn't save you enough  
So I've been savin' it up, I started savin' it up  
And when you said I couldn't give you enough  
I started givin' you up, I started givin' you up  
You are not me, Arlandria, Arlandria  
You and what army, Arlandria, Arlandria  
Oh God you gotta make it stop  
  
My sweet Virginia  
Oh God you gotta make it stop  
My sweet Virginia  
Oh God you gotta make it stop
