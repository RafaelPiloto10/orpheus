[Verse 1]In the little village of Bethlehem  
There lay a child one day  
And the sky was bright  
With a holy light  
O'er the place where Jesus lay.  
  
Alleluia  
O how the angels sang!  
Alleluia  
How it rang!  
And the sky was bright  
With a holy light  
'Twas the birthday of a King.  
  
Twas a Humble birthplace  
But O  
How much God gave to us that day!  
From the manger bed what a path has led  
What a perfect holy way.  
  
Alleluia  
O how the angels sang!  
Alleluia  
How it rang!  
And the sky was bright  
With a Holy light  
'Twas the birthday of a King
