I feel heartbeat  
You feel heartbeat  
Keeping time  
Oh, yeah  
  
I feel your heart beat  
And it's true to this heart of mine  
Oh, yes it is  
With your big eyes  
You say more than a thousand words  
Oh, yes you do  
With your sweet kiss  
You thrill me with a holy kind of bliss  
  
So closer (closer)  
Closer (closer)  
Closer (closer)  
Closer to this heart of mine  
Oh, yeah  
  
Hear that heartbeat  
(Hear that heartbeat)  
Hear my heart beat  
(We hear your heart beat)  
I hear your heart beat  
(We hear your heart beat)  
Hear two hearts beat  
Hear two hearts beat  
Hear two hearts beat  
Baby, yeah, yeah, yeah, alright  
  
Ooh, I feel heartbeat
