[Verse 1]  
When December comes, I bet you want to  
Wrap me all up and take me home with you  
See what I look like under them lights  
We'll keep it quiet, whatever we do  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I'm just tryna keep my baby warm through the wintertime  
I'm just tryna give you something to remember through the summertime  
And whatever is on your list, I'll do it  
Boy, whatever it is, you know I'll do it  
  
[Chorus]  
Merry Christmas, here I am, boy  
Gonna love you, gonna give you all I can, boy  
Merry Christmas, here I am, boy  
I'm the present and you know it, here I am, boy  
Merry Christmas, here I am, boy  
Gonna love you, gonna give you all I can, boy  
Merry Christmas, here I am, boy  
I'm the present and you know it, boy  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'll give you the fire I keep inside  
Guide you all the way down, be your nightlight  
Give you the sweetest kiss that you'll taste  
Unwrap me now, been waiting since midnight  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I'm just tryna keep my baby warm through the wintertime  
I'm just tryna give you something to remember through the summertime  
And whatever is on your list, I'll do it  
Boy, whatever it is, you know I'll do it  
  
[Chorus]  
Merry Christmas, here I am, boy  
Gonna love you, gonna give you all I can, boy  
Merry Christmas, here I am, boy  
I'm the present and you know it, here I am, boy  
Merry Christmas, here I am, boy  
Gonna love you, gonna give you all I can, boy  
Merry Christmas, here I am, boy  
I'm the present and you know it, here I am, boy
