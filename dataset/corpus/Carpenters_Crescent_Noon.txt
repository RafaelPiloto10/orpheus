Green September  
  
Burned to October brown  
  
Bare November  
  
Led to December's frozen ground  
  
The seasons stumbled round  
  
Our drifting lives are bound  
  
To a falling crescent noon  
  
  
Feather clouds cry  
  
A vale of tears to earth  
  
Morning breaks and  
  
No one sees the quiet mountain birth  
  
Dressed in a brand new day  
  
The sun is on its way  
  
To a falling crescent noon  
  
  
Somewhere in  
  
A fairytale forest lies one  
  
Answer that is waiting to be heard  
  
  
  
You and I were  
  
Born like the breaking day  
  
All our seasons  
  
All our green Septembers  
  
Burn away  
  
Slowly we'll fade into  
  
A sea of midnight blue  
  
And a falling crescent noon
