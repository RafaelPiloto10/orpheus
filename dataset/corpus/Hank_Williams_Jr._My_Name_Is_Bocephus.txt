I just came in here to have some whiskey and beer  
And say howdy to you all  
You all know me, it's Hank Williams, Jr, you see  
Hat and shades, beard and all  
Now I have heard, mmm hmm, I've gotten the word  
About all these silly imposters runnin around  
Let me tell you somethin now they ain't real  
They got no scars, they got no feel  
Why they don't know nothin about whiskey bent and hellbound  
Now I'm looking for a lover and I'm looking for some fun  
My name is Bocephus  
I'm a son of a gun  
  
Some of us are born with it, some of us don't ever, ever get it  
Thank God I'm a guitar man, and it's true I love the money  
And it's true I love all the honeys  
But the thing I really love is to get down with the band  
  
Not everybody loves me  
But those that do will fight  
Right to the end they're guitar friends  
From legendary Saturday Nights  
I learned something from Lynyrd Skynyrd  
From my Daddy and Ernest Tubb too  
I do country rock, I do blues  
Now I'm looking for a lover  
And I'm going to have some fun  
Oh, my name is Bocephus  
And I'm a son of a gun  
  
Some of us are born with it  
Some of em don't ever, ever get it  
Thank God I'm a guitar man  
Oh, it's true I love the money  
And I really, really love the honeys  
But the thing I really love is to get down with the band
