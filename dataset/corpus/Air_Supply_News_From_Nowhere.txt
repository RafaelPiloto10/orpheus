(graham russell)  
I never saw it happen  
I never saw the flame  
I never new how much there was  
To lose and gain  
But when the sun was taken  
You never shone so bright  
And from a place we'd long forgotten  
The blind were given sight  
If there's one thing I must do  
It's to say I love you to  
It's the one thing I'm so sure of  
(chorus)  
If I hold you now from my point of view  
Will you show me how to be close to you  
If the dawn should break and you're  
Far away  
Can you ever know what I need to say  
I can see how much I was taking it all  
For granted  
Among the silent victims  
Only the wind would moan  
And for a time I felt us touch  
The great unknown  
For that eternal moment  
Oh what a price to pay  
With nothing left but all we have  
We slowly walked away  
If there's one thing I must do  
It's to say I love you too  
It's the one thing I'm so sure of  
  
(chorus)  
So give life to your dreams  
For there lies your survival  
And cast your heart beyond those  
Faded scenes  
And I'll bring you through that storm  
Yes I'll bring you back  
  
(chorus)  
News from nowhere  
News from nowhere  
News from nowhere...
