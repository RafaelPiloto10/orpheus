In the cool of the evening  
When I was a boy  
I would gaze at the wide open skies  
And I'd dream of a someday  
When I'd be a man  
And live with a lady with lights in her eyes  
Well, I searched for that dream  
Till my heart nearly broke  
Till my hopes turned to hopeless and died  
Until just this morning when I suddenly woke  
Looked at you sleeping there and cried  
  
This is what I dreamed  
This is what I wished for  
Now all at once I see  
Everything I've ever wanted  
Is here with me  
  
Yes, this is what I dreamed  
Like a miracle unfolding  
Holding you near me  
Just like this  
  
Every moment, every kiss  
Is exactly how I pictured it would be  
I swear I must be dreamin'  
For this is what I dreamed, ooh  
  
And it's everywhere around us  
Every cloud in the sky  
Every breeze that blows by  
Can't believe I've been so blind  
To this sweet bliss  
  
Yes this is what I dreamed  
And I just can't help but wonder  
If under those same magic skies  
You were closing your eyes  
And dreaming of this moment with me  
My life is wide awake now  
For this is what I dreamed ooh  
  
This is what I dreamed  
This is what I dreamed
