I can paint a sunset across the sky of blue  
Only with you, Only with you  
I can be a master at anything I do  
Only with you, Only with you  
  
I found the end of the rainbow my golden treasure too  
Only with you, Only with you  
The sun looks good in the morning and I love the night time too  
Only with you, Only with you  
  
All my world would end dear my rising star would fall  
If ever I should lose you I would be nothing at all  
  
All my world is heaven I'll be happy my whole life through  
Only with you, Only with you
