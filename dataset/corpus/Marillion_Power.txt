You carry me around  
Like loose change jingle janglin'  
At the bottom of your bag  
You don't seem to feel it though  
Because you swing down the street  
Walking that unique birthday candle glow  
In broad daylight, in broad daylight  
  
And you don't even know  
The way I love you  
  
You never knew power until you  
You thought that power was this scar  
People pass the laws in gold  
Seen our needs, emotional parts  
  
Oh baby, that's nothing  
  
You think it's kind of sweet  
The stammer and the tremble in my voice  
But don?t mistake it for weakness  
Or some kind of incompleteness  
'Cause round about now  
I can feel it tingle tanglin'  
It's coiled up inside me  
And it?s ready to blow  
  
You never knew power until you  
You saw it fizzed in the over-head lines  
Burning steel are borne to currents  
  
Satisfied the vertical pylons  
You never knew power until you  
Saw it roll like a head with thoughts  
Or melting stone, a new volcano  
Earthquake, thunder, lightning, stars  
  
The way I love you  
Is something you don't understand  
  
The way I love you  
Took more than I could imagine, even now  
You never knew how hard  
All the time you felt so strong  
  
But now you can't function  
The wave of a sleeve  
Is the meaningless slew  
Falls away from your feet  
And the Universe uses  
It's light, streaming free  
Life will scream in the meteor shower  
Of this guided light  
Where you sparkle and fail  
From heavens fell  
  
Take each guiding light  
In in every hour, in every hour  
I know the power, power  
  
Listen to me  
My feelings tremble  
Am I feeling?
