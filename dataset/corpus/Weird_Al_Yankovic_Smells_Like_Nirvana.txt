What is this song all about?  
Can't figure any lyrics out  
How do the words to it go?  
I wish you'd tell me, I don't know  
Don't know, don't know, don't know, oh no  
Dnn't know, don't know, don't know  
  
Now I'm mumblin' and I'm screamin'  
And I don't know what I'm singin'  
Crank the volume, ears are bleedin'  
I still don't know what I'm singin'  
We're so loud and incoherent  
Boy this oughtta bug your parents  
Yeah  
  
It's un-in-tel-ligible  
I just can't get it through my skull  
It's hard to bargle nawdle zouss(?)  
With all these marbles in my mouth  
Don't know, don't know, don't know, oh no  
Don't know, don't know, don't know...  
  
Well we don't sound like Madonna  
Here we are now, we're Nirvana  
Sing distinctly? We don't wanna  
Buy our album, we're Nirvana  
A garage band from Seattle  
Well, it sure beats raising cattle  
Yeah  
  
And I forgot the next verse  
Oh well, I guess it pays to rehearse  
The lyric sheet's so hard to find  
What are the words? Oh, nevermind  
Don't know, don't know, don't know, oh no  
Don't know, don't know don't know...  
  
Well, I'm yellin' and we're playin'  
But I don't know what I'm sayin'  
What's the message I'm conveyin'?  
Can you tell me what I'm sayin'?  
So have you got some idea?  
Didn't think so, well, I'll see ya!  
Sayonara, sayonara  
Ayonawa, adinawa  
Odinaya, yodinaya  
Yaddayadda, yaaahyaaah  
Ayaaaaah!
