It may be warm but the snow is going to fall,  
Enough to cover us all.  
We've gotta be strong men and follow a path again.  
  
We've got to have faith in something bigger,  
Faith in something bigger,  
Faith in something big inside yourself.  
  
It might be cold but the heat of our love will melt,  
The snow we never felt.  
We're young and hardy again, we bow to weaker men.  
  
We've got to have faith in something bigger,  
Faith in something bigger,  
Faith in something big inside yourself.  
  
The more we learn, the less we believe to be true.  
The more we prove, the more remains to be proved.  
We've gotta be strong men and follow a path again.  
  
We've got to have faith in something bigger,  
Faith in something bigger,  
Faith in something big inside yourself, inside yourself.  
  
Faith in something bigger (x 8)
