Amanda, I know what you're thinking,  
You and I have much to say,  
And you've been making me crazy,  
Trying to understand  
But it's impossible at your age.  
  
I know I said I'll always try,  
But you're going to bed alone again tonight,  
And you lie there in the dark and wonder why.  
  
I did it for you, and the boys,  
Because love should teach you joy,  
And not the imitation,  
That your momma and daddy tried to show you.  
I did it for you, and for me,  
And because I still believe,  
There's only one thing,  
You can never give up,  
Never compromise on,  
And that's the real thing you need in love.  
  
You're so afraid your life is over,  
And nothing I can say can change your mind.  
How can anybody be so selfish,  
And treat you all so cruel,  
The woman screamed at me and cried.  
I'll always hold you in my soul,  
And I'm never going to leave you all alone  
But your daddy doesn't live here anymore.  
  
I did it for you, and the boys,  
Because love should teach you joy,  
And not the imitation,  
That your momma and daddy tried to show you.  
I did it for you, and for me,  
And because I still believe,  
There's only one thing,  
That you can never give up,  
Never compromise on,  
And that's the real thing you need in love.  
  
Everybody's got a boat upon the ocean,  
Not everybody's sailing out to sea,  
And is there someone there for me?  
I'm ready to believe.  
  
I did it for you, and the boys,  
Because love should teach you joy,  
And not the imitation,  
That your momma and daddy tried to show you.  
I did it for you, and for me,  
And because I still believe,  
There's only one thing,  
That you can never give up,  
Never compromise on,  
And that's the real thing you need in love.
