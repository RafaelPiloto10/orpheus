Gentle Shepherd,  
Show us the way  
Keep us safe,  
On the journey  
Give us shelter,  
When the day is done  
Lead us out,  
Out of the darkness  
Open our eyes,  
When the morning comes  
Show us the sun  
  
Gentle Shepherd,  
Show us the way  
Grant us mercy,  
Hope for tomorrow, and  
Strength for a day  
Gentle Shepherd  
Show us your grace  
  
When we fall,  
Lift us up Lord  
When we wander,  
Bring us home again  
Give us love,  
For one another  
Show us your power,  
Help us understand  
Merciful friend  
  
Gentle Shepherd,  
Show us the way  
Grant us mercy,  
Hope for tomorrow, and  
Strength for a day  
Gentle Shepherd,  
Show us your grace  
Show us your face  
  
Blessed Jesus,  
Show us your face
