Wake the fuck up!  
Wake the fuck up!  
Wake the fuck up!  
Wake the fuck up!  
Wake the fuck up!  
Wake the fuck up!  
Wake the fuck up!  
Wake the fuck up!  
  
Each day, more frightening  
All of us wanna die  
The pressure's tightening  
I don't even want to try  
Should I take all this stupid bullshit?  
What makes them think they can get away with it?  
I'm not happy  
I wish they'd just...  
  
Wake the fuck up!  
Wake the fuck up!  
Wake the fuck up!  
Wake the fuck up!  
  
I can't take no more  
What are we fighting for?  
You are my brothers  
Each one I would die for  
Please just let it go  
All our heads have blown  
Let's take the stage  
And remember what we play for  
  
No more fighting!  
I swear I'm gonna leave  
Talking shit to spite me  
I wish we'd just...  
  
Wake the fuck up!  
Wake the fuck up!  
Wake the fuck up!  
Wake the fuck up!  
  
I can't take no more  
What are we fighting for?  
You are my brothers  
Each one I would die for  
Please just let it go  
All our heads have blown  
Let's take the stage  
And remember what we play for  
  
I can't take no more  
What are we fighting for?  
You are my brothers  
Each one I would die for  
Please just let it go  
All our heads have blown  
Let's take the stage  
And remember what we play for  
  
I can't take no more  
What are we fighting for?  
You are my brothers  
Each one I would die for  
Please just let it go  
All our heads have blown  
Let's take the stage  
And remember what we play for  
...Remember what we play for  
...Remember what we play for  
...Remember what we play for
