I stayed away so long Jo  
Don't think that I could come back  
You're doin' so well without me girl  
You'd laugh if you'd know'd where I'm at  
  
You knew me when it was all my world  
Somehow it's all passed me by  
But don't let on to my friends Jo dear  
That things ain't turned out as planned  
  
You bore my child then I left you aside  
I don't expect you to forgive  
But Jo I can say in a funny old way  
I was sure that I had it made  
  
I still possess a photograph  
My memory to refresh  
But fade it may Jo I can say  
I was sure that I had it made  
  
You bore my child then I left you aside  
I don't expect you to forgive  
But now I'm not so young and I'm so afraid  
To sleep alone for the rest of my days
