All you cares  
Now they seem  
Oh so far away  
All your fears  
I fear I once shared  
Now I know  
  
There's a future  
For all of us  
Not so long ago  
I was so scared  
You seemed so sad  
I could see  
  
Through your twisted smile  
So unsure  
Always confused  
Pale blue eyes  
Gazing down  
From your ivory tower  
Through the haze  
  
All broken and bruised  
Then: out of the blue  
Love came rushing in  
Out of the sky  
Came the sun  
Out of left field  
Came a lucky day  
Out of the blue  
No more pain  
I don't mind  
If it's only  
A passing craze  
Throwaway lines  
Often ring true  
If I were you  
  
I would stay  
For a little while  
I you were me  
Would you walk out  
In style?
