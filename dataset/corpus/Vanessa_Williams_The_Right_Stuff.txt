I was standin' at 7:15  
Waitin' for my baby's car  
Just when out stepped the driver of a limousine  
And asked if I was going far  
  
I said I've got my mind made up  
I don't want to leave here baby cause it's clear to me  
That it's just too tough to find another lover like mine  
  
With (I mean the) right stuff  
(I got to have) the right stuff baby  
I don't want to miss out on the right stuff  
(Ooh no with mister right stuff)  
  
I just found him a week ago  
He's gonna call me on the phone and say  
I live in Paris, don't you want to go  
I know you must be alone  
  
Well it's take more than a fancy trick  
Or chauffeured limousine for I have never seen  
No one who can give me lovin' like this  
The other fellas don't compare  
  
With (I mean the) right stuff  
(I got to have) the right stuff baby  
I don't want to miss out on the right stuff  
(Ooh no with mister right stuff)  
  
He's the only one to give me that lovin'  
Cause next to him there is no other one  
He' very sexy, oh so sweet  
Knocks me off my feet, sing  
Ooh yeah, let me sing it again  
  
With (I mean the) right stuff  
(I got to have) the right stuff baby  
I don't want to miss out on the right stuff  
(Ooh no with mister right stuff)
