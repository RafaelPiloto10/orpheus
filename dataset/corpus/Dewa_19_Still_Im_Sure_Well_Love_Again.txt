There was a piano  
We use to play And spend the time  
'Til we found it was love  
Hidding inside us Can not separate us  
  
There's a flame of love  
Searching in the dark It's there to guide us  
But through the days beyond the haze  
I can see you reaching out to hold me  
  
Reff :  
Still I'm sure we'll love again  
It's a matter of time  
I will belong to you, You belong to me  
How can I convince you girl  
That I'm stuck on you Can't find another heart  
I love you more each day (I love you more each day...)  
  
Never though never cross my mind  
You gave everything You ask me just holding on  
If I could just walk away  
To love again with somebody new  
  
Too many memories  
Release the passion inside And set them free  
But through the days beyond the haze  
I can see you reaching out to hold me  
Back to Reff :
