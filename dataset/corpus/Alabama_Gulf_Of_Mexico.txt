I live to work and work to live  
Oh but what i wouldn't give  
For a ray of sun and a little piece of beach  
Where the sand dollar is the only currency  
  
[Chorus:]  
I vote we go to the gulf of mexico  
You and me by the sea  
Palm trees call me, oh that's the place i want to be  
Down where the southern breezes blow  
On the Gulf of Mexico  
  
Right at five o'clock today  
I'll pick you up, we'll drive away  
And i can't wait to feel the sand beneath my toes  
And i can almost see the sunburn on your nose  
  
[Repeat chorus]  
Vamos we go... (repeat chorus again)  
Tag  
Down where the southern breezes blow  
On the Gulf of Mexico  
  
On the Gulf of Mexico  
That's the place i want to be  
  
Down where the southern breezes blow  
On the Gulf of Mexico
