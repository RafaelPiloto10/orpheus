The first noel  
The angels did say  
Was to certain poor shepherds  
In fields where they lay  
In fields where they  
Lay keeping their sheep  
On a cold winter's night  
That was so deep  
  
Noel, noel, noel, noel  
Born is the king of israel  
  
They looked up  
And saw a star  
Shining in the east  
Beyond them far  
And to the earth  
It gave great light  
And so it continued both day and night  
  
Noel, noel, noel, noel  
Born is the king of Israel  
  
And let us all  
With one accord  
Sing praises to our heavenly lord  
That hath in heaven and earth of naught  
And with his blood mankind hath bought  
  
Noel, noel, noel, noel  
Born is the king of Israel  
  
Born is the king  
Born is the king  
Born is the king
