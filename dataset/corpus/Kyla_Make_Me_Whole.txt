Darlin' I want you to listen  
I stayed up all night so I can get this thing right  
And I don't think there's anything missin'  
Coz a person like you made it easy to do  
I've waited for so long  
To sing to you this song  
  
[Chorus:]  
Coz your eyes are the windows to heaven  
Your smile could heal a million souls  
Your love completes my existence  
You're the other half that makes me whole  
You're the only other half that makes me whole  
  
I think the angels are your brothers, yeah  
They told about me, said "you're just what she needs"  
And I find myself thanking your mother  
For giving birth to a saint  
My spirit flies when I say your name  
If there's one thing that's true  
It's that I was born to love you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Coz your eyes are the windows to heaven  
Your smile could heal a million souls  
Your love completes my existence  
You're the other half that makes me whole  
You're the only other half that makes me whole  
  
You make my dreams come true over and over again  
And I honestly truly believe  
That you and me are written in the stars  
I'd live my whole life through  
Just giving thanks to you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Coz your eyes are the windows to heaven  
Your smile could heal a million souls  
Your love completes my existence  
You're the other half that makes me whole  
You're the only other half that makes me whole
