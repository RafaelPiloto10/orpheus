When you give your all and you're feeling small, don't you cry  
If you're crying loud you won't feel so proud, don't you cry  
  
There's a place to be, won't you stay with me, you can help us see,  
Here we are.  
  
Let yourself go by,  
You can touch the sky if you try.  
  
All you've got to show, you may never know, what you are  
If you ever try, can you tell me why, why you are  
Only you will know, and you picked your show,  
Can you tell me though, will you know?  
  
If you feel like me, you can't help but please, who you know  
If you're feelin' low, will you tell me though, who you are  
  
Only you will know, and you picked your show,  
Can you tell me though, will you know?  
  
If you feel like me, you can't help but please, who you know.
