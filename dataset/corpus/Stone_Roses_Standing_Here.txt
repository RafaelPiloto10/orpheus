I'm standing on a hilltop  
A hundred miles from home  
I can see the light surrounds me  
I want you to show me round  
I'm standing here  
I really don't think you could know  
That I'm in heaven when you smile  
  
I'm drifting through the city  
I'm swinging from a tree  
I can touch but you can't feel me  
You hear me as you sleep  
  
I'm standing here  
I really don't think you could know  
That I'm in heaven when you smile  
And I'm everywhere  
I really don't think you could know  
That I'm in heaven when you smile  
But I don't think you think like I do  
No matter how how hard I try  
I always thought I'd have the answer  
Let me tell you what I've got  
  
I'm looking through your window  
I might just have the key  
Over me my free-fall baby  
You hear me as you speak  
  
I'm standing here  
I really don't think you could know  
That I'm in heaven when you smile  
I'm standing here  
I really don't think you could know  
That I'm in heaven when you smile  
  
But I'm everywhere  
I really don't think you could know  
That I'm in heaven when you smile  
But I don't think you think like I do  
No matter how how hard I try  
I always thought I had the answers  
Let me tell you what I've got  
Oh let it rot I made them stop  
  
I could park a juggernaut in your mouth  
And I can feel a hurricane when you shout  
I should be safe forever in your arms  
I should be safe forever in your arms  
I could park a juggernaut in your mouth?  
And I can feel a hurricane when you shout  
I should be safe forever in your arms  
I should be safe forever in your arms
