Now talk about Hawaii I didn't know it was so grand  
I pick me out a hula hula girl before my boat could land everybody does it in
Hawaii  
Now she's got it here and she's got it there  
Her lips are red her little ole feet are bare  
She shy on close but I don't care cause everybody does it in Hawaii  
  
Now when I leave Hawaii when I leave ole Waikiki  
I'm goin' to take my hula hula girl and bring her back with me  
'Cause everybody does it in Hawaii  
She's got two pretty legs with dimple knees  
Two brown arms and they know how to squeeze  
A perfect form and I'm hard to pelase but everybody does it in Hawaii
