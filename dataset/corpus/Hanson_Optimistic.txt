Flies are buzzing round my head  
Vultures circling the dead  
Picking up every last crumb  
The big fish eat the little ones  
The big fish eat the little ones  
Not my problem, give me some  
  
You can try the best you can  
If you try the best you can  
The best you can is good enough  
If you try the best you can  
If you try the best you can  
The best you can is good enough  
  
This one's optimistic  
This one went to market  
This one just came out of the swamp  
This one dropped a payload  
Fodder for the animals  
Living on animal farm  
  
If you try the best you can  
If you try the best you can  
The best you can is good enough  
If you try the best you can  
If you try the best you can  
The best you can is good enough  
  
I'd really like to help you, man  
I'd really like to help you, man  
Nervous messed up marionettes  
Floating around on a prison ship  
  
If you try the best you can  
If you try the best you can  
The best you can is good enough  
If you can try the best you can  
If you try the best you can  
Dinosaurs roaming the earth  
Dinosaurs roaming the earth  
Dinosaurs roaming the earth
