Oh what a day is today  
Nothing can stand in my way  
Now that you've shipped out from under my skin  
I think I'm ready to win  
  
Oh what a night is tonight  
I think I'm ready to fight  
Now that my broken bones all have been healed  
I think I'm starting to feel  
  
Something good  
Something good  
Now that you're gone I can roll on to something good  
  
Oh what a way that we die  
Plenty of tears were supplied  
My eyes are wrung out and dry as a bone  
And I taste much better alone  
  
Something good  
Something good  
Now that you're gone I can roll onto something good  
  
Oh you know I moved away  
From the other side of the door  
I don't have to wait anymore for you to come home  
Something good  
Now that you're gone I can roll on to something good  
Something good
