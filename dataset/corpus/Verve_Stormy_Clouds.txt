I wanted to tell you my story  
How my life seemed to change in a matter of days  
The heavens break I am walking tall  
How come change always seems to bring the rain  
  
Stormy clouds, new horizons  
Come and get it, if you want to  
So hop on the train 'Cause it kills the pain  
Blues player going to another town  
Believe me this boy here is sinking  
Just drinking  
  
These streets, these times  
They tie me down through with you  
But I feel no pain  
Stormy clouds, new horizons
