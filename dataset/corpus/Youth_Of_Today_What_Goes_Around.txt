A half-ass commitment, a casual act  
Shows me the decency that you lack  
You're fucking with feelings and fucking with heads  
And live for the moment is all that you've said  
What goes around comes around  
So watch yourself cause you're falling down  
Abusing, misusing you're out of control  
Your mind, spirit and body will take their toll  
A slave to your senses, I see nothing more  
Cause temporary pleasure is what you strive for  
Taken what you've wanted, stepped on what's in your way  
But there will be a price that you'll have to pay  
Easy acquaintances, broken friends  
Happy now but the loser in the end  
Broken promises, broken hearts  
Walk away when the pain starts  
You take what's yours you still want more  
If you only knew what's in store
