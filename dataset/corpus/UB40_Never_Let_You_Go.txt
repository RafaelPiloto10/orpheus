I will never let you go  
I will never  
I will never let you go  
I will never  
I've got to hold on, every day  
In every way, but the things you will say  
Just couldn't be that way  
You'll never, ever reach  
If you don't try  
Instead you keep on telling all  
Those dreadful lies  
Just wait and see  
How things could be  
When I am free  
Don't worry 'bout me  
Don't worry 'bout me 'cus  
I will never let you go  
I will never  
I will never let you go  
I will never  
(repeat chorus)  
I've got to hold on, every day  
In every way, but the things you will say  
Just couldn't be that way  
You'll never, ever reach  
If you don't try  
Instead you keep on telling all  
Those dreadful lies  
Just wait and see  
How things could be  
When I am free  
Don't worry 'bout me  
Don't worry 'bout me 'cus  
I've never let you go  
I'll always try  
And I've got so much soul  
You'll wonder why  
It's just because  
I'm so true  
You'll be feeling blue  
When I get through  
There is nothing you can do  
(repeat last verse)
