I recall the time they found those fossilized mosquitoes  
And before long, they were cloning DNA  
Now I'm being chased by some irate veloceraptors  
Well, believe me, this has been one lousy day  
  
Jurassic Park is frightning in the dark  
All the dinosaurs are running wild  
Someone shut the fence off in the rain  
I admit it's kinda eerie  
But this proves my chaos theory  
And I don't think I'll be coming back again  
On no  
  
I cannot approve of this attraction  
'Cause getting disemboweled always makes me kinda mad  
A huge tyrannosaurus ate our lawyer  
Well, I suppose that proves, they're really not all bad  
  
Jurassic Park is frightening in the dark  
All the dinosaurs are running wild  
Someone let T. Rex out of his pen  
I'm afraid those things'll harm me  
'Cause they sure don't act like Barney  
And they think that I'm their dinner, not their friend  
Oh no  
  
Jurassic Park is frightening in the dark  
All the dinosaurs are running wild  
What a crummy weekend this has been  
Well, this sure ain't no E-ticket  
Think I'll tell them where to stick it  
'Cause I'm never coming back this way again  
Oh no, oh no
