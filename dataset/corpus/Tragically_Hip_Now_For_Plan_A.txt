Yeah, I know, I know, I know  
It's still not enough  
Nothing short of everything  
Nothing short of everything's enough  
No matter how wide or how tough  
Nothing short of everything's enough  
  
Yeah, I know, I know, I know  
Now for plan A  
I'll stay till the wisteria fades  
And falls on L.A.  
No matter how high or how rough  
Nothing short of everything's enough  
  
In your face the endless patience  
The fleeting nature of life on display  
(And nothing short of everything)  
(Nothing short of everything)  
I'll stay till the wisteria fades  
The way it falls all over L.A.  
(Nothing short of everything)  
(Nothing short of everything)  
(Nothing short of everything)  
(Nothing short of everything)  
(Nothing short of everything)  
No matter how wide or how rough  
(Nothing short of everything)  
(Nothing short of everything)  
Nothing short of everything's enough  
(Nothing short of everything)  
(Nothing short of everything)  
(Nothing short of everything)  
(Nothing short of everything)
