I stand at your gate.  
And the song that I sing is of moonlight.  
I stand and I wait  
For the touch of your hand in the June night.  
The roses are sighing a moonlight serenade.  
  
The stars are aglow.  
And tonight how their light sets me dreaming.  
My love, do you know  
That your eyes are like stars brightly beaming?  
I bring you, and I sing you a moonlight serenade.  
  
Let us stray 'til break of day  
In love's valley of dreams.  
Just you and I, a summer sky,  
A heavenly breeze, kissin' the trees.  
  
So don't let me wait.  
Come to me tenderly in the June night.  
I stand at your gate  
And I sing you a song in the moonlight.  
A love song, my darling, a moonlight serenade
