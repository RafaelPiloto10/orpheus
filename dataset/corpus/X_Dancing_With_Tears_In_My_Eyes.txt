Dancing with tears in my eyes  
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by  
Dancing with tears in my eyes  
Living out a memory of a love that died  
  
It's five and I'm driving home again  
It's hard to believe that it's my last time  
The man on the wireless cries again  
It's over, it's over  
  
Dancing with tears in my eyes  
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by  
Dancing with tears in my eyes  
Living out a memory of a love that died  
  
It's late and I'm with my love alone  
We drink to forget the coming storm  
We love to the sound of our favourite song  
Over and over  
  
Dancing with tears in my eyes  
Living out a memory of a love that died  
  
It's time and we're in each other's arms  
It's time but I don't think we really care  
  
Dancing with tears in my eyes  
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by  
Dancing with tears in my eyes  
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by  
  
Dancing with tears in my eyes
