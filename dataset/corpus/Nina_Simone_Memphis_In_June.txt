Memphis in June  
A shade veranda under Sunday blue sky  
Memphis in June  
And my cousin Miranda she's making a blueberry pie  
  
I can see the clock outside a ticking and a tocking  
Everything so peaceful and dandy  
I can see my grandmama 'cross the street still a rocking  
Watching all the neighbours go by oh my  
  
Memphis in June  
Sweet oleander blowing perfume in the air everywhere  
Up jumps the moon to make it so much grander  
It's paradise honey take my advice honey  
Cos there's nothing like old Memphis in June
