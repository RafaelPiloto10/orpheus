Raining again  
I ought to get out from under  
Sometimes I wonder  
Sometimes I don't wonder at all  
  
And as for loving again  
Somewhere, somebody might need me  
But where would it lead me?  
I'd just be rising to fall  
  
Love was easy to believe in  
When you wanted me yesterday  
But I couldn't feel the touch of time upon tomorrow  
  
After you  
What am I gonna be?  
You took a part of me  
As you were passing through  
  
After you  
How am I gonna find  
The me I left behind  
That I'll meet after you?  
  
Drifting again  
From place to place without reason  
Season to season  
I just keep running away  
  
And as for people again  
I'm just a girl who discovers  
Now and then lovers  
Who never ask me to stay  
  
Love was easy to believe in  
When I walked in the light of you  
Now I'm walking by myself  
And all I see is darkness  
  
After you  
What am I gonna be?  
You took a part of me  
As you were passing through  
  
After you  
How am I gonna find  
The me I left behind  
That I'll meet after you?  
  
Raining again  
I ought to get out from under  
Sometimes I wonder  
Sometimes I don't wonder at all  
  
After you  
How am I gonna find  
The me I left behind  
That I'll meet after you?  
  
After you  
What am I gonna be?  
You took a part of me  
As you were passing through  
  
Raining again  
Raining again  
Raining again  
  
After you  
What am I gonna be?  
Raining again
