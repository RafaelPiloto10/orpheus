Chasing your shadow,  
The senses together,  
Four-leafed and clever  
I come from behind.  
  
Chasing your shadow,  
I wander in circles,  
You're one in a million,  
We're two of a kind.  
  
It's you that I long for,  
It's you that I hunger,  
Oh you are the maker of waves in my mind.  
We dance in the moonlight,  
  
A run on the wire,  
Drawing a fine line,  
A neverending love.  
The fever turns slowly into a fire,  
  
Drawing a fine line,  
A neverending love.  
Chasing your shadow,  
Moon and the water,  
  
Field and the reaper,  
Star and the sky.  
Chasing your shadow,  
Hammer and heartbeat,  
  
Clay and new concrete,  
I follow the signs.  
It's you that I long for,  
It's you that I hunger,  
  
And you are the maker of waves in my mind.  
We dance in the moonlight
