Some day is finally come  
Open up your eyes to the truth  
You know it's a magic thing  
A man needs a woman like you  
You bring all the morning light  
Like a sun through the window  
You clear up the cloudy skies  
You're refreshing as a morning rain  
  
And I don't want nobody  
I don't want nobody but you  
And if I need anybody  
Darling, you're the one that I would choose  
  
I stumble down Canyon Road  
Just looking for the right way to love you  
Every time I felt your doubt  
And I hard the word from above  
Hold on, she's coming soon  
Woman, who would change your whole life  
And now that I have a choice  
Well I'm choosing you to be my wife  
  
Well I don't want nobody, nobody but you  
And if I need anybody  
Darling, you're the one that I would do  
  
Nobody, I don't want nobody but you  
And if I need anybody  
Darling, you're the one that I would choose
