I was a long way from home, on the streets of shame,  
Where the women in cages play any kind of game.  
That's when I saw her, and I looked into her eyes -  
I don't speak the language, but I sure see the merchandise.  
Oh, what could I say? I was hot for you.  
When you walk that way, what's a man supposed to do?  
Tell me where I draw the line, let me have it one more time.  
She was a sight, she had a ring right through her nose.  
A feeling came over me from my head right down to my toes.  
Must have been the voodoo, or that trickery,  
Like something in a movie by rico fellini.  
Oh, what could I say? I was hot for you.  
When you walk that way, what's a man supposed to do?  
Tell me where I draw the line, let me have it one more time.  
Black halter, walk the streets of shame. (repeat four times)  
Well, I think she knew by now that I was no saint.  
Is this the holy cow, waiting 'till I retain?  
Left her angel line-up - I was begging her for more.  
Standing on the concrete, I'm going to break down the door.  
Oh, what could I do? I was hot for you.  
When you walk that way, what's a man supposed to do?  
Tell me where I draw the line, let me have it one more time.  
Black halter, walk the streets of shame. (repeat and fade)
