Hey, this song is for Marilyn and every drag queen  
Oh brother, it's not like the past  
We're wearing stilettos and talking too fast  
Passing the mirror hung up in pose  
The boys they were fairest in immaculate clothes  
Lunch with Janet Street Porter and Marilyn's nose  
But this life is a baby, so sad when it grows  
Into you and me, ah, what the hell we're gonna be?  
Where will we go and what will we be?  
If we can't communicate intelligently  
There's a price on my head but I've never been free  
I said, "'How d'ya keep your credibility?"  
No more crying, no more trying  
Please, no more dying  
I just wanna be free  
I'm taking the trouble right to your door  
Why'd you do it, you bastard? Don't love you no more  
Sinners beside me, saints on the right  
And if you slow down, you'll be a turkey tonight  
c'mon let's go a little further, don't be uptight  
If you feel insecure, well, just turn off the light  
Where will we go and what will we be?  
If we can't communicate intelligently  
There's a price on my head but I've never been free  
I said, "'How d'ya keep your credibility?"  
I said, "'How d'ya keep your credibility?"
