Hands, don't let her go, 'cause then the midnight icy winds will blow  
Eyes, give every drop, this ain't the way that should've made her stop  
Arms, just let her know, no one fills the place she used to grow  
Smile, don't leave me now, 'cause you're the reason she's here anyhow  
  
Words, be gentle when you speak into her heart  
'Cause if it breaks, she may not come again  
  
[Chorus]  
I've been waitin' for your love and it's been here all the time  
Right in front of me  
I've been sittin', waitin' for your love, and all the time it's been here  
Right in front of me  
  
Look, forget your pride, she might kiss as you're like even tide  
Song, be in her heart, especially when we're apart  
Love, be by my side, 'cause if she leaves there ain't no place to hide  
Soul, be with her now, 'cause you're the first one she knew anyhow  
  
Words, be gentle when you speak into her heart  
'Cause if it breaks, she may not come again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Words be gentle when you speak into her heart  
'Cause if it breaks, she may not come again  
  
I've been sittin', waitin' for your love, and all the time it's been here  
Right in front of me  
Draw the line, I'll step across, even further I give in, you got me, yeah  
I've been sittin', waitin' for your love, and all the time it's been here  
Right in front of me, yeah  
Just separated by ten thousand miles, you're not alone, girl you got me, yeah  
Guess I needn't tell you that I'm not around, I'm inside, you got me, yeah  
I've been waitin' for your love, it's been here all the time  
Right in front of me
