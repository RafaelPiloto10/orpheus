Come on come on,  
I'm right, I'm wrong and when I'm wrong I say.  
We always had the good and bad  
And that will never change.  
This is the closest, I've ever been  
Oh yeah.  
  
The give, the take,  
The mend, the break,  
And so the cycle goes,  
We're doing well, we've been through hell,  
And only heaven knows,  
How far we get too,  
Thank god I met you ooh,  
And if you don't know.  
  
Just put your hand on my heart,  
Put your hand on my heart,  
And I don't have to say yeah,  
And I don't have to think yeah,  
Just put your hand on my heart  
Just put your hand on my heart.  
You know.  
  
Come on come on  
'cause you're the one that I want for myself  
The strength you give I wanna live,  
Inside our little shell.  
Nothing comes close too,  
Nothings supposed too yeah.  
  
You have your doubts the same way I do,  
When you're out safe in my love that's the truth.  
  
Just put your hand on my heart,  
Put your hand on my heart,  
And I don't have to say yeah,  
And I don't have to think yeah,  
Just put your hand on my heart  
Just put your hand on my heart.  
You know.  
  
When you don't feel that you're strong enough to make it,  
When life treats you hard and don't think you can take it,  
When you don't the way you stand you're close to breaking,  
Just put your hand on my heart,  
Put your hand on my heart  
  
Just put your hand on my heart,  
Put your hand on my heart,  
And I don't have to say yeah,  
And I don't have to think yeah,  
Just put your hand on my heart  
Just put your hand on my heart.  
You know.  
  
Just put your hand on my heart,  
Put your hand on my heart,  
And I don't have to say yeah,  
And I don't have to think yeah,  
Just put your hand on my heart  
Just put your hand on my heart.  
You know.
