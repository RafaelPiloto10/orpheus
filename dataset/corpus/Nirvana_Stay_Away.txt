Monkey see, monkey do  
(I don't know why)  
I'd rather be deal than cool  
(I don't know why)  
Every line ends in rhyme  
(I don't know why)  
Less is more, love is blind  
(I don't know why)  
  
Stay  
Stay away  
Stay away  
Stay away  
  
Give an inch, take a smile  
(I don't know why)  
Fashion shits, fashion stile  
(I don't know why)  
Throw it out and keep it in  
(I don't know why)  
Have to have poison skin  
(I don't know why)  
  
Stay  
Stay away  
Stay away  
Stay away  
  
I don't know why  
I don't know why  
  
Stay  
Stay away  
Stay away  
Stay away  
  
Monkey See, monkey do  
CI don't know why)  
I'd rather be deal than cool  
(I don't know why)  
Every line ends in rhyme  
(I don't know why)  
Less is more, love is blind  
(I don't know why)  
  
Stay  
Stay away  
Stay away  
Stay away  
  
I don't know why  
I don't know why  
  
Stay

Stay away  
Stay away  
Stay away  
God is gay
