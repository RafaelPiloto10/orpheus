I know your leaving is too long overdue  
For far too long I've had nothing new to show to you  
through dry eyes I watched your plane  
Fade off west of the moon  
And it felt so strange to walk away alone  
No regrets no tears goodbye  
Don't want you back we'd only cry again  
Say goodbye a-gain  
  
The hours that were yours echo like empty rooms  
The thoughts we used to share I now keep alone  
I woke last night and spoke your name  
Not thinking you were gone  
And it felt so strange to lie awake alone  
No regrets no tears goodbye  
Don't want you back we'd only cry again  
Say goodbye a-gain  
  
Our friends have tried to turn my nights to day  
Strange faces in your place can't keep the ghosts away  
Just behind the darkest hour just before dawn  
It still feels so strange to lead my life alone  
No regrets no tears goodbye  
Don't want you back we'd only cry again  
Say goodbye a-gain
