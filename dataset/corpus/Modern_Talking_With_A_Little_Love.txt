They said : Oh yeah, it's a tough world  
You're restless and you're young  
I said : Oh girl, it's a good twirl  
And your time will come, your time will come  
They said : you came from the wrong side  
He's a page from the end of the book  
I said : You came from the right side  
Took me just one look  
Then you understood  
  
With a little love  
You will survive  
With a little love  
You will get by  
Do what you want  
Go your own way  
'Cause its your life  
  
With a little love  
You'll make a start  
Yeah, why lovers break each other's heart  
Do what you want  
Go your own way  
'Cause it's your life  
  
They said : no future forget it  
You came from the wrong side of town  
I said : don't listen, don't let it  
Let it bring you down  
Make you wear a frown  
They said : Oh let him down easy  
Laugh at the heart you have won  
I said : that life is for living  
Like the morning sun  
It had just began
