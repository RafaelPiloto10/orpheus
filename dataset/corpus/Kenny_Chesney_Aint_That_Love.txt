I will always remember the first time that we met  
And the first time that I kissed your lips.  
Is a thing I wont forget.  
The special way you held me is the way you hold me still.  
And I knew right then you love me and I know you always will.  
  
Ain't that love  
Ain't that how it's suppose to be  
When two hearts come together as one.  
Just like you and me,  
Ain't that love,  
Shining in your eye's,  
Heaven sent from up above.  
Ain't that love.  
  
My grandpa and my grandma,  
My momma and my dad,  
Didn't have a lot of things.  
But love is what they had,  
Their love kept them together through the many years.  
Though life was hard,  
They shared it all through the laughter and the tears.  
  
Ain't that love  
Ain't that how it's suppose to be  
When two hearts come together as one.  
Just like you and me,  
Ain't that love,  
Shining in your eye's,  
Heaven sent from up above.  
Ain't that love.  
  
Baby your the sunshine that brightens up my day,  
And I will always stand by you.  
Darling come what may,  
And I will always love you,  
To have and to hold.  
And I'll keep my every promise to you with this band of gold.  
  
Ain't that love  
Ain't that how it's suppose to be  
When two hearts come together as one.  
Just like you and me,  
Ain't that love,  
Shining in your eye's,  
Heaven sent from up above.  
Ain't that love.  
  
Heaven sent from up above,  
Ain't that love.
