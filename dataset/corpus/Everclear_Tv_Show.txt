I walk around in the market  
Late at night  
I walk around in the empty aisles  
And I don't know why  
I need to be  
Close to the light  
So I walk around  
In the middle of the night  
  
I drive around in the neighborhood  
I want to lose my house  
Drive around on the freeway  
Guess I want to lose myself  
Turn the key  
Turn the dial  
Listen to the radio  
And just drive for a while  
  
Yeah, I got no place to go  
I wish I  
Could come home  
To a life that looks like a TV show  
Wish I  
Could see  
My television family waiting for me  
  
Where no one fights  
No one screams  
No one lies  
And no one leaves  
I don't care how the story ends  
I want to feel like I'm living again  
  
I drive away from the city  
Need to see the sky  
Drive away from the bad things  
That make me close my eyes  
Leave it all  
In the past  
Drive away  
Going nowhere fast  
  
Yeah, now I got nowhere to go  
I wish I  
Could go home  
To a life that looks like a TV show  
Wish I  
Could see  
My television family waiting for me  
  
Where no one fights  
And no one screams  
No one lies  
And no one leaves  
I don't care how the story ends  
I want to feel like I used to feel  
I want to feel like I'm living again  
  
Whoa  
I'm living again  
Whoa  
I'm living again  
Whoa  
Breathing out  
And breathing in  
Whoa  
I'm living again  
  
Walk away from the circles  
Need to find myself  
I think I need to start over  
Need to start making sense  
  
Breathe out  
Breathe in  
I wish I could start all over again  
  
I wish I could do it all over again  
  
I wish I  
Could come home  
To a life like the one that I used to know  
I wish I  
Could someday see  
Everything back the way it used to be  
  
Where no one cries  
No one screams  
No one hits you  
And no one leaves  
Everybody loves how the story ends  
All the bad guys lose  
And the good guys win  
  
I wish I could do it all over again  
  
I want to feel someday  
I can really start living again  
  
Whoa  
I'm living again  
Whoa  
I'm living again  
Whoa  
I'm living again  
  
Whoa  
I am living again  
  
Whoa  
I'm living again  
Whoa  
I'm living again  
  
Whoa  
Yes, I'm living again
