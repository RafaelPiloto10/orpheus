I'm a hawg for you, baby  
I'm gonna root all around your door  
I'm a dirty hawg for you, baby  
And I'm gonna keep on rootin'  
  
All around your door, baby, now now  
I'm gonna keep on rootin', baby  
Till I can't root no more  
  
I got rockin' pneumonia, asiatic flu  
I got something to tell you, baby  
I want to sock it to you  
Hawg for you, baby  
  
And I'm gonna rock all around your door  
Keep on rootin', rootin'  
Rootin', root, baby, yeah  
Till I just can't root no more  
  
Hawg for you, baby  
Hawg for you, honey  
  
They say I'm a dirty man  
But I'm doin'the best I can  
They say I don't do none right  
But I'm gonna make love all night, huh  
  
I'm a hawg for you, baby  
And I'm gonna root all around your door  
Keep on rootin', mama  
  
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord  
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord  
'Til I just can root no more  
Let's take it home, boys, oh yeah
