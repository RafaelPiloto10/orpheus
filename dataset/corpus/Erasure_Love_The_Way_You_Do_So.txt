On and on and on  
Here's the break of dawn  
Coming through the window, heart  
Pull yourself a chair up, love  
On and on and on  
Quiver like a reed  
Let yourself a go-go, old one  
Honor me a solo, young man  
Careful not to give yourself away  
There is still tomorrow and a heart-felt meaning  
When you get that feeling you'll recall a night of love in motion  
We shall lie warm inside  
Quite at ease, watch me slide  
Love the way you do so  
We shall lie side by side  
Here and now, talk in turn  
Love the way you do so  
Time is rolling on  
Blending with the mind  
Love the way you tease me, heart  
Tear another layer off, love  
Listen to the stillness of the day  
Drawing ever closer like your heart is beating  
And when I hear it beating I will recall a night of love in motion  
We shall lie warm inside  
Quite at ease, watch me slide  
Love the way you do so  
We shall lie side by side  
Here and now, talk in turn  
Love the way you do so  
We shall lie warm inside  
Quite at ease, watch me slide  
Love the way you do so  
We shall lie side by side  
Here and now, talk in turn  
Love the way you do so
