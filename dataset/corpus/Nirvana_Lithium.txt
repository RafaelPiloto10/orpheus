I'm so happy 'cause today  
I have found my friends  
They're in my head  
I'm so ugly, but that's okay, 'cause so are you  
We've broken our mirrors  
Sunday morning is everyday for all I care  
And I'm not scared  
Light my candles, in a daze  
'Cause I've found god  
  
[Repeat: x6]  
Yeah, yeah  
  
I'm so lonely, that's ok I shaved my head  
And I'm not sad  
And just maybe I'm to blame for all I've heard  
And I'm not sure  
I'm so excited, I can't wait to meet you there  
But I don't care  
I'm so horny, but that's okay  
My will is good  
  
[Repeat: x6]  
Yeah, yeah  
  
I like it, I'm not gonna crack  
I missed you, I'm not gonna crack  
I love you, I'm not gonna crack  
I kill you, I'm not gonna crack  
  
I like it, I'm not gonna crack  
I missed you, I'm not gonna crack  
I love you, I'm not gonna crack  
I kill you, I'm not gonna crack
