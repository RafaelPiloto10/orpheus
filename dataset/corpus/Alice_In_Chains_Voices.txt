Who am I, is this me?  
Am I one or thirteen?  
  
I've gone cold, hard to deal  
Used to stand where I kneel  
  
Everybody listen  
Voices in my head  
Everybody listen  
Does yours say what mine says?  
  
I want more, than I need  
I don't know what is real  
  
Everybody listen  
Voices in my head  
Everybody listen  
Does yours say what mine says?  
Anytime I listen  
Voices in my head  
Everybody listen  
Does yours say what mine says?  
  
Whispering of names, faces  
Uniforms I've worn  
And all that is gone  
Always climbing  
To fall down again  
Holding onto everything  
It's not what it seems  
  
I've been told, dreaming's free  
Think I'll go back to sleep  
  
Everybody listen  
Voices in my head  
Everybody listen  
Does yours say what mine says?  
Anytime I listen  
Voices in my head  
Everybody listen  
Does yours say what mine says?  
  
Calling out the names, faces  
Uniforms I've worn  
And all that is gone  
Always climbing  
To fall down again  
Holding onto everything  
It's not what it seems
