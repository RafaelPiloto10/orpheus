He never makes me feel ashamed  
He bounces me high up on his back  
He gives me the gold hat when I'm jump attacked  
  
My new boyfriend, my new boyfriend  
My new boyfriend  
Protects me  
He defends me  
He respects me  
He loves me more than you ever did  
My new boyfriend isn't just some kid  
My new boyfriend, ooh, my new boyfriend  
  
He call in the trumpets for a laugh  
He show me the way it was in Spain  
He give me the golly when I'm too insane  
  
My new boyfriend, my new boyfriend  
My new boyfriend  
Protects me  
He defends me  
He respects me  
He loves me more than you ever did  
My new boyfriend isn't just a baby  
My new boyfriend isn't just some kid  
My new boyfriend, ooh, my new boyfriend  
  
he loves the living daylights out of me  
He springs a ladder to the moon  
He sings the far side of the tune  
  
He's a driven, silver lover  
He can swim under the covers  
He's a high, gold bouncing lover  
  
He's a diver and a dreamer  
He's a dolphin in the ocean  
He's a rival of Orion
