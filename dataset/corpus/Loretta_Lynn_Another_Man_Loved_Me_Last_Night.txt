He doesn't know that I can't look him in the eyes  
For that I can't speak or I'll start tellin' lies  
I hope he thinks that I'm just moody and quiet  
But another man loved me last night  
Yes, another man loved me last night  
I'd almost forgotten what love was really like  
But I'm only human only a woman  
I let another man love me last night  
While he's sleepin', well, I'm cryin' here awake  
Not being loved was more than I could take  
Though it was wrong there in his arms it seemed so right  
When another man loved me last night  
Yes, another man loved me last night  
I'd almost forgotten what love was really like  
But I'm only human only a woman  
I let another man love me last night
