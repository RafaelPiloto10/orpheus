I want to tell all of you  
That ain't doin' nothin' for me  
And can't do nothin' for me  
You should tend to your business  
And leave mine alone  
Because as far as this man is concerned....  
  
I wanna tell you he's mine  
(You've been a fool too long)  
Now let me tell ya he's mine!  
(Wake up and be strong)  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
(We know how you will feel)  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah he's mine  
(But is his love for real?)  
  
I'm gonna shine  
(Oh yeah?)  
'Cause he's my man  
(Says who?)  
And he's mine  
(You've been a fool too long)  
Now listen!  
  
This man of mine is my every thought  
I'd give him Russia if it could be bought  
I'm not ashamed of nothing I do  
I'd guide a missile if he told me to  
'Cause he's mine!  
(Poor Fool!)  
I know he's mine!  
(Says who?)  
The man is mine!  
(You've been a fool too long)  
  
If I make my bed hard  
That's where I'm gonna sleep  
You people talking means nothing to me  
I work my fingers right down to the bone  
Do anything to please him, right or wrong  
  
'Cause he's mine!  
(Oh no)  
I know he's mine!  
(Oh yeah)  
The man is mine!  
(You've been a fool too long)  
Oh he's mine!  
(Oh no)  
I know he's mine!  
(Oh yeah)  
The man is mine!  
(You've been a fool too long)  
Now listen!  
  
I'm with my man in every way  
To keep him happy each and every day  
I'll never hurt him or make him frown  
I'm with my man if he's up or down
