Walkin' through time  
Reachin' for yesterday  
'Cause we're frightened of tomorrow  
Trying to find  
The feeling that's gone astray, far away  
I remember the look in your eyes  
Love we made unafraid  
Now we've opened the window  
So let's not close the shade  
  
(Chorus)  
Holdin' on  
'Cause the memory of you  
Is something I just can't erase  
Holdin' on  
I don't know what to do  
'Cause the pieces won't fit into place  
But no matter what happens  
We can't let it end this way  
So far away  
So close to something new  
But we're holdin' off tomorrow  
Maybe someday  
We'll find what we need to do, until then  
We'll be doing the best that we can  
Out of rhyme, out of time  
While we're hiding our feelings  
We're leaving love behind  
  
(Chorus)  
Far away  
Reachin' for yesterday  
So far away  
Something has gone away  
So afraid  
To find what we had  
  
(Chorus)
