Come a little closer  
Don't you tell me "no sir"  
Let's make a memory  
  
Come on now  
Come on and give me your kiss now  
What are you gonna miss now  
Let's make a memory, a memory  
Let's make a memory  
Make a memory  
  
Yes let's make a memory together  
One that will last and last forever  
  
Sweet baby  
Baby hold me tight then  
Squeeze with all your might then  
Let's make a memory  
  
Come on now  
Just have a little fun for  
What do you think we're young for?  
Let's make a memory  
Make a memory  
  
Yes let's make a memory together  
One that will last and last forever  
  
Come on now  
Let yourself let go now  
Don't let love grow cold now  
Let's make a memory  
  
Sweet baby  
Forget about the past now  
We've got a love that'll last for  
Now and forever we will be  
Making memories....  
Making memories
