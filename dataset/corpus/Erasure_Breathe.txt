Twenty-seven times I paint the city in lights  
Now I changed my mind  
I was living fast now I'm running on empty  
And I feel yeah I feel  
You're gonna go, let me go  
  
Breathe, and I breathe  
It's bitter without you I can't live without you  
And I'm in love with you  
  
Stood the test of time  
Though I treated you rough you were always kind  
I let my head rule my heart now I'm feeling so lonely  
And I feel it's the deal  
You're letting me go gonna go  
  
Breathe and I breathe  
Hollow without you I can't live without you  
And I'm in love with you  
  
Breathe I believe  
Empty without you I can't live without you  
And I'm in love with you  
  
Breathe, and I breathe  
It's bitter without you I can't live without you  
And I'm in love with you  
  
Breathe I believe  
Empty without you I can't live without you  
And I'm in love with you  
  
Breathe I believe  
I can't live without you I can't live with you  
And I'm in love with you
