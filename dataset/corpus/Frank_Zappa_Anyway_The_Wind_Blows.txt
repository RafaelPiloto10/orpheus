Anyway the wind blows is fine with me  
Anyway the wind blows, it don't matter to me  
'cause I'm through with the fussin' and fightin' with you  
I went out and found a woman who is gonna be true  
She makes me oh so happy now, I'm never ever blue  
Anyway the wind blows is fine with me  
Anyway the wind blows it don't matter to me  
'cause she treats me like she loves me  
And she never makes me cry  
I'm gonna stick with her till the day I die  
She's not like your baby, she would never ever lie  
Anyway the wind blows, is fine with me  
Anyway the wind blows, it don't matter to me  
Now I'm going to go away and leave you standin' at the door  
I'll tell you this baby, I won't be back any more  
'cause you don't even know what love is for  
Anyway the wind blows, anyway the wind blows  
Anyway the wind blows, anyway the wind blows
