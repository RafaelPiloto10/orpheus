Woke up this morning  
Drank some coffee  
Love in a big mail truck is all I need  
  
There's only one thing I should do  
  
Just smile like you mean it  
Smile like you mean it  
Smile (Smile) Smile (Smile)  
Let shine every morning  
Smile like you mean it  
Let me see you smile  
  
In a big world  
In a free country  
Anywhere you go show it off  
  
There's only one thing you should do  
  
Just smile like you mean it  
Smile like you mean it  
Smile (Smile) Smile (Smile)  
Let shine every morning  
Smile like you mean it  
Let me see you smile  
  
There's only one thing I should do  
  
Just smile like you mean it  
Smile like you mean it  
Smile (Smile) Smile (Smile)  
Let shine every morning  
Smile like you mean it  
Let me see you smile
