I'd like to build a house  
Without any walls  
An open paradise  
With a waterfall  
Life is quite detestable  
For some with feeble minds  
  
Who always make the mistake of being someone else  
I always make the mistake of being myself  
  
I'd like to make a friend  
Without any flaws  
Who takes me for what I am  
And nothing more  
Life must be incredible  
For those who stay out late  
  
And always make the mistake of being someone else  
I always make the mistake of being myself  
They always make the mistake of being someone else  
I always make the mistake of being myself  
  
Life must be incredible  
For those who stay out late  
  
And always make the mistake of being someone else  
I always make the mistake of being myself  
They always make the mistake of being someone else  
I always make the mistake of being myself
