I wanna live fast, love hard, die young  
And leave a beautiful memory  
  
I wanna live fast, love hard, die young  
And leave a beautiful memory  
Don't want slow walkin' or sad singin'  
Let 'em have a jubilee  
I wanna leave a lot of happy women  
A-thinkin' pretty thoughts of me  
I wanna live fast, love hard, die young  
And leave a beautiful memory  
  
I got a hot-rod car and a cowboy suit  
And I really do get around  
I got a little black book and the gals look cute  
And I know the name of ev'ry spot in town  
I wanna find 'em, fool 'em, leave 'em  
An' let 'em do the same to me  
I wanna live fast, love hard, die young  
And leave a beautiful memory  
  
I wanna live fast, love hard, die young  
And leave a beautiful memory  
I'm a wampus cat let me grab my hat  
And baby come aiong with me  
We're gonna do some fancy steppin'  
We're really goin' on a spree  
I wanna live fast, love hard, die young  
And leave a beautiful memory  
  
Now you may not approve of the things I do  
But it really don't bother me  
But don't ever think you can tie me down  
I'm gonna stay footloose and fancy free  
So jump back, make tracks, move out  
An' let the pretty gals at me  
I wanna live fast, love hard, die young  
And leave a beautiful memory
