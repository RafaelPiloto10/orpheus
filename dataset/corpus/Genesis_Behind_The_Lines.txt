I held the book so tightly in my hands,  
I saw your picture, heard you call my name  
There was something strange, I could not look away  
I wanted to be there, I wanted to go  
  
You gave me no warning  
You gave no reason  
But I was with you  
Right by your side  
Just give me the strength, and I will help you  
And they can try their hardest, 'cause they don't frighten me  
  
It is written in the book  
  
It is hotter than I've known before, but I feel so cold, and I don't  
know why  
But if the fire within your heart can beat the storm  
Then I really believe, you could make it right  
  
Ooh the time has come now  
We must show our feelings  
But I'm looking right through you  
And your heart is empty  
  
Whatever happened to you it's too late to change now  
There's nowhere you can run to, no place to hide  
Ah you let me down!  
  
But wait a minute, I don't understand  
It's getting stronger, so grab my hand  
Don't want to leave you, don't want to go  
But I'm losing all control  
Can't you see me? I'm slipping away  
I can only stay if you've the will to keep me here  
  
It is written in the book  
  
Oh so many times since I've read those words  
Just waiting to see you, can you see me?
