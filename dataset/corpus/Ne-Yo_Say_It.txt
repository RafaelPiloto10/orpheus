Close the doors  
Lay down  
No, no, no, not like that  
Like this  
Yeah, I like that  
Okay, now here's what I want you to do  
I want you to look me right in my eyes  
And I want you to tell me exactly  
What you want me to do to you  
You ready?  
  
Your body whispering from under the sheets  
I hear it moaning, begging loud and clearly  
I'm rather fluent in the language it speaks, yes  
But it's your mouth I want to tell it to me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Girl, why don't you  
Tell me what you want me to do to you?  
Say it, say it, say it  
Girl, why don't you  
Tell me what you want from me?  
Girl, won't you  
Say it, say it, say it?  
  
It's not as if I'm not totally aware  
That you want my hands right here and my mouth right there  
Girl, don't play shy, show me how bold you can be  
Open your mouth and tell me where you want me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tell me what you want  
Oh, you want that?  
Say the word  
Turn around  
  
Anything that you want, baby  
Tell me you want it  
I got it, babe  
Tell me what you want  
I'm hoping and wishing  
Name your position  
I got it, babe  
Tell me what you want, and I got it, babe  
Anything that you want, baby  
Tell me you want it  
I got it, babe  
Tell me what you want, and I got it  
I'm hoping and wishing  
Name your position  
I got it, babe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah  
  
Say it, say it  
  
Tell me how you want it, girl  
Tell me how you want it, girl
