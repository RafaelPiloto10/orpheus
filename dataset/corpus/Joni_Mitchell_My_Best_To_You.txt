So here's to you  
May your dreams come true  
May old father time  
Never be unkind  
And through the years  
Save your smiles and your tears  
They're just souvenirs  
They'll make music in your heart  
Remember this  
Each new day is a kiss  
Sent from up above  
With an angel's love  
So here's to you  
May your skies be blue  
And your love blessed  
That's my best to you  
  
Remember this  
Each new day is a kiss  
Sent from up above  
With an angel's love  
So here's to you  
May your skies be blue  
And your love blessed  
That's my very best to you
