Hello, my little pretty  
My, don't we look YUCK  
Come here!  
  
You spend all day picking out your dress  
I like you dirty, when you're hair is a mess  
You smell so sweet walking in the room yeah  
You don't have to try so hard to drown me in perfume  
  
Don't cry your heart out  
Don't tell your preacher  
Don't get ideas, this won't last forever  
Just want to touch you  
Just want to feel you  
Just want to taste you  
I never wanted, I never wanted love before

And a, I won't be calling you to go to the prom  
If you want to go, some cheap motel  
You can pick me up at eight, I'll never tell  
  
Don't cry your heart out  
Don't tell your preacher  
Don't get ideas, this won't last forever  
Just want to touch you
