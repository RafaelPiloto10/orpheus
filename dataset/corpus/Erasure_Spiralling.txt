I try hard to put you out of my mind  
Every night alone I'm thinking about you  
How can I avoid this pain without you?  
I won't cry, I wont be sorry no more  
I know that this is something I'll get over  
Maybe I could learn to love another  
It's just a matter of time, a matter of time.  
  
Just because I lock myself in my room  
It doesn't mean that I'm afraid to talk to  
Those people I know that might have seen you  
You'll return, I keep reminding myself  
I won't look back, won't regret a single moment  
I'm going to mend this heart inside you've broken  
It's just a matter of time, a matter of time  
It's just a matter of time, a matter of time.
