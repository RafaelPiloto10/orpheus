I can tell him his toy gun won't kill Indians  
And the towel around his neck don't make him strong  
I can tell him there's no Easter bunny  
But I don't know how to tell him that you're gone  
He still looks for you every morning he's cried every night we've been alone  
I can tell him there's no real Santa but I don't know how to tell him that
you're gone  
  
I can tell him his broomstick's not a pony  
And wearin' daddy's boots don't make him grown  
I can tell him there's no to ferry  
But I don't know how to tell him that you're gone  
Cause he still looks for you...  
I don't know how to tell him that you're gone
