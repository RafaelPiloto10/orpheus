The wind is coming up strong and fast  
And the moon is smiling on me  
Miles from nowhere so small at last  
In between the sky and the sea  
  
I'm bound for the island  
The tide is with me  
I think I can make it before dawn  
It's night on the ocean  
I'm going home  
And it feels like I've never  
I've never been gone  
  
Seagulls cry and the hills are green  
And my friends are waiting for me  
Freak ambition is all a dream  
Let me drown my pride in the sea  
  
I'm bound for the ocean  
The tide is with me  
I think I can make it by dawn  
It's night on the ocean  
I'm going home  
And it feels like I've never  
I've never been gone  
Oh it feels like I've never  
I've never been gone
