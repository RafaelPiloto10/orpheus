Baby, how could I have been so vain  
To make you think that you're the only one to blame.  
For all these distances and all of this pain  
Baby, how could I have been so blind  
To presuppose that your needs were just like mine  
You've been a prisoner for a long, long time.  
But now you run from me  
And I will set you freeIf that's the way it must be.  
I tried so hard to make you part of me  
That every time I looked at youI thought I'd see  
Someone that you could never ever be.  
So full of pride that I could not see straight  
I thought you'd changeIf I could only wait  
I see the truth now but it's much too late  
Cause now you run from me  
And I will set you freeIf that's the way it must be.  
Oh--oh--baby how'd it ever get so cold and mean  
Oh--oh.  
Is there nothing left but silence in between.  
Oh--oh--baby how'd it ever get so cold and mean  
Oh--oh.  
Is there nothing left but silence in between.  
Baby how'd we hold on so long  
To something both of us must have known was wrong  
We're either fools or must be terrible strong.  
Cause now you run from me.  
And I will set you freeIf that's the way it must be.  
Oh--oh--baby how'd it ever get so cold and mean  
Oh--oh.  
Is there nothing left but silence in between.
