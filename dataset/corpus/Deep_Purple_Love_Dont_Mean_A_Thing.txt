If I work hard every day  
For my money  
If I work my finger down to the bone  
That ain't funny  
Now if I see  
Something I can't buy  
I put a dollar down  
Then I try try try  
To get my money  
I need my money  
A woman who ain't got a dime  
I can't use her no  
If she ain't got no cash money  
I've got to refuse her  
I need a woman  
With a whole lotta will  
So she help me, baby  
Help me pay my bill  
I need my money  
I've got to have money  
  
I need lovin' to give me a livin'  
So don't ask me I don't need forgivin'  
I will stand up to count the cost  
But I know I won't stand the loss  
  
I need a woman  
With a whole lotta will  
She can help me pay my bill  
I need my money  
I want my money  
Before I say my prayers  
I count my money  
When I wake up  
It has to be there  
My money  
You see, love, it don't mean a thing  
When she loves you  
She can't bring, can't bring you no money  
I've got to have my money  
  
Lookin' for lovin'  
I need a livin'
