In this world - I am gonna walk  
Until my feet - refuse to take me any longer  
Yes I'm gonna walk - and walk some more  
And I will ask - everyone I meet  
  
Ask 'til they tell me - there's no answers anymore  
Yes I'm gonna ask - more and some more  
And I will love somebody somewhere  
'Til my heart breaks - until it's done  
  
Until it explodes - from out of nowhere  
Like the sun - like the sun  
In this world - I am gonna sing  
Until my voice - won't be singing any longer  
  
Yes I'm gonna sing - more and some more  
And I will love somebody somewhere  
'Til my heart breaks - until it's done  
Until it explodes - from out of nowhere  
  
Like the sun - like the sun  
I will be looking - at everyone  
Until my eyes - refuse to see them any longer  
And though it hurts me so - gonna keep on looking  
  
Looking looking at me  
And I will love somebody somewhere  
'Til my heart breaks - until it's done  
Until it explodes - from out of nowhere  
  
Like the sun - like the sun  
In this world - I will love no more  
So love can't hurt me - hurt me any longer
