The other night, dear  
As I lay sleeping  
I dreamed I held you  
In my arms  
When I awoke, dear  
I was mistaken  
And I hung my head and cried  
  
[Chorus]  
You are my sunshine  
My only sunshine  
You make me happy  
When skies are grey  
You'll never know, dear  
How much I love you  
Please, don't take my sunshine away  
  
I'll always love you  
And make you happy  
If you will only  
Stay the same  
But if you leave me  
To love another  
You'll regret it all someday  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You told me once, dear  
You really loved me  
And no one else could come between  
But now you've left me and love another  
You have shattered all of my dreams  
  
[Chorus]
