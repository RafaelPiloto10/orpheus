If you ever change your mind  
About leaving, leaving me behind  
Baby, bring it to me  
Bring your sweet loving  
Bring it on home to me, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
I know I laughed when I left  
But now I know I only hurt myself  
Baby, bring it to me  
Bring your sweet loving  
Bring it on home to me, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
I'll give you jewelry and money too  
That ain't all, all I'd do for you  
If you bring it to me  
Bring your sweet loving  
Bring it on home to me, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
You know I'll always be your slave  
Till I'm buried, buried in my grave  
Oh, honey, bring it to me  
Bring your sweet loving  
Bring it on home to me, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
