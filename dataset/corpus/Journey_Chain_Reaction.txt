I bet you, she's the one  
Who helped you, come undone  
Those changes  
She put you through  
Long long distance  
You're overdue  
I bet you, she'd like to say  
She's changed you, in every way  
She's so sure  
Now she's on the run  
She ran a red light  
You jumped the gun  
  
Chain reaction, shades of passion  
We surrender, lose control  
So now you, lived a mystery  
You won't be  
Just one more casualty  
You stumble, before you fall  
Won't be the last time  
No not at all  
In motion, it's on her way  
The red light  
Somebody's got to pay  
Those changes  
She put you through  
Long long distance  
You're overdue  
  
Chain reaction, shades of passion  
We surrender, lose control  
Chain reaction  
Strange attraction  
Love's a viper, steals your soul  
  
So now just where do we go  
Tell me where  
  
Chain reaction, shades of passion  
We surrender, lose control  
Chain reaction  
Strange attraction  
Love's a viper, steals your soul
