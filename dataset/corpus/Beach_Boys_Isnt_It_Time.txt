After it's all been said  
The music spinning in our head  
Can't forget the feeling of  
The magic of that summer love  
Ooh I wanna take you there  
Do you wanna turn back the pages  
Memories in photographs  
The world is changed  
And yet the game is still the same  
  
Isn't it time we danced the night away  
How about doing it just like yesterday?  
Every time I think of you  
All of those things we used to do  
  
Remember those nights we spent  
Little did we know how the time would fly  
Isn't it time, oh, oh  
Isn't it time, oh, oh  
  
The good times never have to end  
Now's the time to let them happen again  
We can have ourselves a blast  
Good times that aren't only in the past  
  
Isn't it time we danced the night away  
How about doing it just like yesterday?  
Every time I think of you  
All of those things we used to do  
  
Remember those nights we spent  
Little did we know how the time would fly  
Isn't it time, oh, oh  
Isn't it time, oh, oh  
  
And as the sun goes down we raise a glass to kindness  
To all the good times we share  
Isn't it time we get ready again  
Isn't it time we go steady again?  
  
Isn't it time we danced the night away  
How about doing it just like yesterday?  
Every time I think of you  
And all of those things we used to do  
  
Remember those nights we spent  
Little did we know how the time would fly  
Isn't it time, oh, oh  
Isn't it time, oh, oh  
  
Isn't it time we danced the night away  
How about doing it just like yesterday?  
Every time I think of you  
And all of those things we used to do  
  
Remember those nights we spent  
Little did we know how the time would fly  
Isn't it time, oh, oh  
Isn't it time, oh, oh
