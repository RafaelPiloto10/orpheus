Come on  
Lovin' you has got to be  
(take me to the other side)  
Like the devil and the deep blue sea  
(take me to the other side)  
Forget about your foolish pride  
(take me to the other side)  
Oh take me to the other side  
(take me to the other side)  
My mama told me there'd be days like this  
And man she wasn't foolin'  
'Cause I just can't believe the way you kiss  
Uh huh  
You opened up your mouth with baited breath  
You said you'd never leave me  
You love me, you hate me, I tried to take the loss  
You're cryin' me a river but I got to get across  
Lovin' you has got to be  
(take me to the other side)  
Like the devil and the deep blue sea  
(take me to the other side)  
Forget about your foolish pride  
(take me to the other side)  
Oh take me to the other side  
(take me to the other side)  
I'm lookin' for another kind of love  
Oh lordy how I need it  
The kind that likes to leap without a shove  
Oh honey, best believe it  
To save a lot of time and foolish pride  
I'll say what's on my mind, girl  
You loved me, you hate me, you cut me down to size  
You blinded me with love and yeah it opened up my eyes  
Lovin' you has got to be  
(take me to the other side)  
Like the devil and the deep blue sea  
(take me to the other side)  
My conscience got to be my guide  
(take me to the other side)  
Oh honey take me, take take take take take ow  
Take me to the other side  
I'm lookin' for another kind of love  
Oh lordy how I need it  
The kind that likes to leap without a shove  
Honey, you best believe it  
Now I ain't one for sayin' long goodbyes  
I hope all is forgiven  
You loved me, you hate me, I used to be your lover  
You know you had it comin' girl so take me to the other side  
Take me to the other side  
Take me to the other side  
Lovin' you has got to be  
(take me to the other side)  
Like the devil and the deep blue sea  
(take me to the other side)  
My conscience got to be my guide  
(take me to the other side)  
Oh honey take me to the other side  
(take me to the other side)  
Lovin' you has got to be  
(take me to the other side)  
Like the devil and the deep blue sea  
(take me to the other side)  
Forget about your foolish pride  
(take me to the other side)  
Honey take me take me take me take me to the other side  
(take me to the other side)  
(take me to the other side)...
