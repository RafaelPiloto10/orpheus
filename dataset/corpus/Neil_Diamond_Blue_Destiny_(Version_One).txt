How can I love  
If my love doesn't love only me?  
What have I done  
To deserve love that never can be?  
  
Once she was just mine alone,  
Now she's just someone I've known  
What can I do  
To change my blue destiny?  
  
First she decides  
That our love will always be true,  
Next thing I know,  
She's runnin' with somebody new  
I ask this heart every day  
Can there be some other way?  
What can I do  
To change my blue destiny?  
  
There were times  
When love was new  
And both our hearts were gay  
Now, the signs say we're through  
And bound for separate ways  
  
First she decides  
That our love will always be true  
Next thing I know,  
You're runnin' with somebody new  
I ask my heart every day  
Can there be some other way?  
What can I do  
To change my blue destiny?  
  
Once you were mine  
And wanted the whole world to know  
Now ev'ry time I'm around  
You got somewhere to go  
Still I 'd forgive all your lies darlin'  
I realize you, only you  
Can change my blue destiny
