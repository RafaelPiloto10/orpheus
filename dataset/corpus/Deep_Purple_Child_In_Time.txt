Sweet child in time  
You'll see the line  
The line that's drawn between  
Good and bad  
  
See the blind man  
Shooting at the world  
Bullets flying  
Ohh taking toll  
  
If you've been bad  
Oh Lord I bet you have  
And you've not been hit  
Oh by flying lead  
  
You'd better close your eyes  
Ooohhhh bow your head  
Wait for the ricochet  
  
Oooooo ooooooo ooooooo  
Oooooo ooooooo ooooooo  
Ooo, ooo ooo  
Ooo ooo ooo  
  
Oooooo ooooooo ooooooo  
Oooooo ooooooo ooooooo  
Ooo, ooo ooo  
Ooo ooo ooo  
  
Aaaahh aaaahh aaaahh  
Aaaahh aaaahh aaaahh  
Aahh, aahh aahh  
Aah I wanna hear you sing  
  
Aaaahh aaaahh aaaahh  
Aaaahh aaaahh aaaahh
