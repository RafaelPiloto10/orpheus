Headless  
Pulling the machine down  
Coming to the low sound  
Feeling like a real man  
  
Racing  
Flashing from down under  
Flesh and blood and thunder  
Trembling wheel in cold hand  
  
Faster, much faster  
wot a human speed disaster  
Deeper, much deeper  
on through the void I cast'er  
  
I'm a steel tormentor  
And I speed 'round every curve  
I'm a mean inperator  
Of my intimate machine  
  
Turkey  
Near to devastation  
losing all my patience  
Cannot make this kit fly  
  
Danger  
Muscular contraction  
Out for satisfaction  
Mere intoxication  
  
Nightride, it's nightride now-  
try to catch my tail lights  
So sad, I'm so sad  
But you won't ever suck my steel bride  
  
I'm a steel tormentor  
And I speed 'round every curve  
I'm a mean inperator  
Of my intimate machine
