Hey you know  
Baby don't care who's mad about her,  
Always got the boys hanging out to get her,  
Knows just when to smile  
But she can bite like a crocodile.  
Don't want to get heavy, don't ask me why,  
Got everything in place from her foot to her eyelash.  
Just might dance, but not for a while  
She don't want nobody cramping her style.  
Knows it when you think she's nice,  
But if you want her to be yours, boy,  
You got to pay the price.  
Better get ready for tears and sorrow -  
She'll be here today and she'll be gone tomorrow  
Waving her pretty hand.  
She's got a date with another man.  
Too busy to stay in one place too long,  
Got itchy feet, got to be moving on.  
See you again, out on the tiles,  
Your broken heart will mend, baby, up in a while.  
Now you know she's cold as ice  
And if you want her to be yours, boy,  
You got to pay the price.
