Every time you go  
This much I know  
That it didn't mean nothing  
'Cause I've closed the back door  
Every night apart  
You were in my heart  
So don't you worry  
'Cause I'm ready for this love to restart  
There is a reason  
We came together  
Rain or shine  
I'll love you all my life  
We'll weather the seasons  
We'll laugh and cry  
Rain or shine  
I'm yours, you're mine  
I'll love you all my life  
When I feel afraid  
In my own parade  
That marches through me  
And I don't recognize a single face  
You drew a line in the sand  
Then you took my hand  
And we crossed over  
Now I finally understand that  
There is a reason  
We came together  
Rain or shine  
I'll love you all my life  
We'll weather the seasons  
We'll laugh and cry  
Rain or shine  
I'm yours, you're mine  
I'll love you all my life
