If your blue and you don't know where to go to  
Why don't you go where fashion sits  
Puttin on the ritz.  
  
Different types of wear all day coat pants  
With stripes and cut away coats for perfect fits  
Puttin on the Ritz.  
  
Dressed up like a million dollar trooper  
Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper  
Super-Duper  
  
Come lets mix where Rockafellers  
Walk with sticks or umbrellas  
In thier mits  
Puttin on the Ritz.  
  
Have you seen the well to do  
Up and down Park Avenue  
On that famous thorough fare  
With thier noses in the air  
High hats and narrow collars  
White spats and lots of dollars  
Spending every dime  
For a wonderful time.
