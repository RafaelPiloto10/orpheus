I'll die before I get to sleep  
When screaming shadows haunt my dreams  
I'm cold and soaking wet when daylight shows its face  
This fear will always get in your way  
And I can hear so much  
That I miss it everyday  
It finds me deep in love and deeper down the lane  
I don't know too much but I know what I want to say  
I Just Need Myself  
Please leave me when you see me fall  
Oh please I have to climb that wall  
And from the top of it you can nearly see your face  
But don't let this ever get in your way  
And I can hear so much  
That I miss it everyday  
It finds me deep in love and deeper down the lane  
I don't know too much but I know what I want to say  
I Just Need Myself  
I'm not going to walk on sinking sand  
I'll sail this day to higher land  
And when the sun is high, and I'll let my music say  
These things will never get in your way  
And I can hear so much  
That I miss it everyday  
It finds me deep in love and deeper down the lane  
I don't know too much but I know what I want to say  
I Just Need Myself
