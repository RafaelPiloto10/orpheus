La, la, la, la, la.  
I only want to love you, please don't push me away,  
Let me in your life.  
I wasn't there when he hurt you, so why should I  
Have to pay, let me in your life.  
I want to share your tomorrows, so I must beg you  
Today, if he's the cause of your sorrows, be glad  
That he's gone away.  
I need someone, let me love you, please don't push  
Me away, Let me in your life.  
La, la, la, la, la.
