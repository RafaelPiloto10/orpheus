Well you're damned if you do  
You're damned if you don't  
Catch 22  
You're so very close, yet so far  
You gave your best shot  
Still no cigar  
  
Working your fingers  
Down to the bone  
Running with sinners  
Your life's just a loan  
  
Catch 22  
  
They say you can  
They say that you can't  
Catch 22  
  
The limit's the sky  
But they lock you inside  
You're livin' a lie  
You'll never know why  
  
Workin' your fingers  
Down to the bone  
Running with sinners  
Your life's just a loan  
  
Catch 22  
  
Catch 22  
You think you will win  
But you always lose  
Catch 22  
  
They think they're so strong  
They think they're so wise  
You know they are wrong  
They tread on thin ice  
  
Working your fingers  
Down to the bone  
Running with sinners  
Your life's just a loan  
  
Catch 22  
  
Catch 22  
You think you will win  
But you always lose  
Catch 22  
  
They think they're so strong  
They think they're so wise  
You know they are wrong  
They tread on thin ice  
  
Workin' your fingers  
Down to the bone  
Running with sinners  
Your life's just a loan  
Catch 22
