I'm dreaming and so it must be true  
Nothing else could look as good as you do  
And so in a rocket go  
Up to where the astros flow into space  
Don't hold me down  
  
Atom eyes, don't worry your brain  
Take a break from everyday  
Sell the house, the car, the pain  
(Just be sure to live again)  
Atom eyes  
  
I'm running away from your clues  
Atomizer sprinklers are spraying perfume  
Escape a lobotomy  
There's a million heartstrings ready to fly  
Let's pull them now  
  
Atom eyes, don't worry your brain  
Take a break from everyday  
Sell the house, the car, the pain  
(Just be sure to live again)  
Atom eyes  
  
Atom eyes, don't worry your brain  
Take a break from everyday  
Sell the house, the car, the pain  
(Just be sure to live again)  
Atom eyes
