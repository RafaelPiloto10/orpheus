What good is sitting, alone in your room?  
But come, hear the music play!  
Life is a cabaret, old chum! Come to the cabaret!  
  
Put down the knitting, the book and the broom  
It is time for a holiday  
Life is a cabaret, old chum! Come to the cabaret!  
  
Come taste the wine Come hear the band  
Come blow that horn Start celebrating  
Right this way your table's waiting  
  
What good's committing prophet of doom?  
To wipe every smile away  
Life is a cabaret, old chum! So come to the cabaret!
