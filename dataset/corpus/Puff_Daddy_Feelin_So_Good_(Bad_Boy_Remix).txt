Damn, you look good  
  
Rap by P. Diddy  
  
When I opened up my eyes today  
Felt the sun shining on my face  
It became so clear to me that everything is goin my way  
I feel like there's no limit to what I can see  
Got rid of fears that were holding me  
My endless possibilities  
Has the whole world opened up for me  
That's why I'm feeling...  
  
Chorus  
I'm feeling so good  
I knew that I would  
Been taking care of myself  
Like I should  
Cause not one thing  
Can bring me down  
Nothing in this world gonna turn me around...  
  
Now that day is turning into night  
And everything is still going right  
there's no way you can stop me this time  
Or break this spirit of mine  
Like the stars above I'm gonna shine  
Anything I want will be mine  
Tonight I'm gonna have a good time  
Call a few friends of mine  
cause I'm loving life  
and tonight's for feeling...
