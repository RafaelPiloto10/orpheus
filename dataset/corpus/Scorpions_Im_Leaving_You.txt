Ooh, girl, I'm leaving you  
Yes, I'm leaving you  
I've got to go tonight  
Ooh, girl, I'm leaving you  
Yes, I'm leaving you, I've got to go  
I can't stay  
  
You shouldn't feel so blue  
Shouldn't feel so blue  
When I go tonight  
Baby, you shouldn't feel so blue  
Shouldn't feel so blue, when I'm gone  
I can't stay  
  
Keep me in your mind till I  
Come back to love ya  
Keep me in your mind till I  
Come back to take you worlds away,  
To take you worlds away, baby  
  
Ooh, girl, I'm leaving you  
Yes, I'm leaving you  
I've got to go tonight  
Baby, you shouldn't feel so blue  
Shouldn't feel so blue, when I'm gone  
I can't stay  
  
Keep me in your mind till I  
Come back to love ya  
Keep me in your mind till I  
Come back to love ya  
Keep me in your mind till I  
Come back to love ya
