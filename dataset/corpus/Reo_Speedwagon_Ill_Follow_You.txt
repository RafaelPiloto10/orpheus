Late one night on a road in Texas  
I pulled into an all-night cafe  
What's my pleasure? Well ma'am the fact is, I don't know  
  
Sat down next to a "Rajun' Cajun"  
A black haired beauty from New Orleans  
Did my duty can I buy you a drink dear  
She said "Please"  
  
(So) we rolled right along,  
And the night got long  
So I said how would you like it to be?  
  
Then she sang her song  
Said "If I come along  
You must find a place in your heart for me"  
  
I was lost on a road to nowhere  
And asked if she was goin' my way  
She was late for a date with no one  
(So) please don't leave  
  
She'd just left a love that was dying  
And had no plans of goin back  
I caught her eyes as she was crying  
"Let's make tracks"  
  
She said, "I'll follow , I'll follow you on your dare  
Your eyes say something, your heart better care  
You're lost and you're lonely, I've been to long there  
So I'll follow, I'll follow you...anywhere
