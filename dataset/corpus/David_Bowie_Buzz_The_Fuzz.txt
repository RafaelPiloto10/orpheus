Once there was a fellow  
And his name was Buzz.  
He was just a rookie cop  
Just a baby fuzz.  
He patrolled the Sunset Strip  
In the land of the free  
And the home of the hip.  
He protected you and me  
From evil women like  
Poor Alice D  
Alice was the girl  
That all good hippies dread  
And they called her sweet Alice D'head  
Alice it was plain to see was  
Full of pot and STP  
She'd attract a great big crowd  
Because her inner peace was much too loud.  
Good Buzz did the thing  
That all the good fuzz must  
Stuck his gun in Alice's back  
And said 'This is a bust'  
Shone the flashlight in her eyes  
She began to hypnotize  
Buzz said 'What a wild sensation'  
Guess this must be hallu hallucina cina cina cination hmmm  
Love is so sensational  
When you fall in love with eyes dilational la la  
Now they're taking pills and shots  
And Buzz is not afraid of Watts  
Buzz and Alice D have shown  
The way of where the Fuzz might be some day  
Buzz is still a cop of course  
He's the pusher on the force  
He's protecting you and me  
From evil women like  
Poor Alice D
