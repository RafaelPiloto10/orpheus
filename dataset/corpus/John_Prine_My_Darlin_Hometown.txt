Far away over the sea  
There's a river that's calling to me  
That river she runs all around  
The place that I call my hometown  
There's a valley on the side of the hill  
And flowers on an old windowsill  
A familiar old picture it seems  
And I'll go there tonight in my dreams  
Where it's green in the summer  
And gold in the fall  
Her eyes are as blue  
As the sky I recall  
Far away over the sea  
There's a place at the table for me  
Where laughter and music abound  
Just waiting there in my hometown  
The river she freezes  
When there's snow on the ground  
And the children can slide  
To the far side of town  
Far away far away me  
Hung up on a sweet memory  
I'm lost and I wish I were found  
In the arms of my darlin' hometown  
With the evening sun sittin'  
On the top of the hill  
And the mockingbird answering  
The old chapel bell  
Far away over the sea  
My heart is longing to be  
And I wish I could lay myself down  
In the arms of my darlin' hometown
