You want to race  
If you insist  
At that price  
I can't resist  
That's right  
That's right  
That's right  
Tonight it ain't right  
I got to have me a week  
But I'll be back for you, Jack  
And I'll let the machine speak  
That's right  
That's right  
That's right  
Showdown, you bet  
And I haven't even saddled my pony yet  
Have mercy, Miss Percy  
I done put the coon tune on this bet  
That's right  
That's right  
That's right
