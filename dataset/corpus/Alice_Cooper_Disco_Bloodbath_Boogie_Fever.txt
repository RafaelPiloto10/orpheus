Yo yo yo, yo  
Yo yo yo, yo  
  
Here you are in the club, with your bottle full of blood  
You've got grill, you got bling but player you don't know a thing  
Put your hands in the air, stick 'em up like you don't care  
Face the wall, count to ten, we mow you down, reload again  
  
Oh no , here we go  
  
Disco who, disco what  
Get down on your knees, and keep your trap shut  
Disco this, disco that  
When disc-gos to hell, that's where we're at, where we're at  
  
Yo yo yo, yo  
Yo yo yo, yo  
  
Disco bloodbath  
(Disco bloodbath boogie fever)  
Boogie fever  
(Disco bloodbath boogie fever)  
Disco bloodbath  
(Disco bloodbath boogie fever)  
Boogie fever  
(Disco bloodbath boogie fever)  
  
Bodies here, bodies there, piles of bodies everywhere  
On the chairs, on the door, disco bloodbath on the floor  
Hear them yell, hear them scream, just like someones scary dream  
Dig a hole, push 'em in, tomorrow they'll be back again  
  
Oh no, here we go  
  
Disco who, disco what  
Get down on your knees, and keep your trap shut  
Disco this, disco that  
When disc-gos to hell, that's where we're at, where we're at  
  
Yo yo yo, yo  
Yo yo yo, yo  
  
Disco bloodbath  
(Disco bloodbath boogie fever)  
Boogie fever  
(Disco bloodbath boogie fever)  
Disco bloodbath  
(Disco bloodbath boogie fever)  
Boogie fever  
(Disco bloodbath boogie fever)  
  
We cleaned the house tonight (we cleaned the house tonight)  
We did our job (we did our job it's alright)  
We turned out all the lights okay  
  
We were sent to let them know (I think you really let 'em know)  
It was time to let them go (you know they really had to go)  
'Cause we're the ones who close the show okay
