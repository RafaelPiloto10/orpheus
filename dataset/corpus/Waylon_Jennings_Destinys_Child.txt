Surely you know by now my heart is wild I don't want to be tied down it ain't
my style  
Don't you think I know better world is kind of other too dis-selfish  
Well I can't help it I'm destiny's child  
I couldn't began to tell you if I try admit so much to love before a little
while  
  
Tried to remember all of the good love I wish you understood love  
I ain't no good love I'm destiny's child destiny's child destiny's child  
  
I could be on my way now please don't cry  
Gotta be somewhere else I don't know why  
Keep thinkin' of all I'm losin' I know your lips're soothin'  
I gotta be movin' I'm destiny's child  
  
I must wish you well and say goodbye I wish you moons and stars and sunny
skies  
You gave me so much to believe in my life has a little more meanin'  
Still I'm leavin' I'm destiny's child destiny's child destiny's child
