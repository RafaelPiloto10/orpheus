You ruin my day  
You ruin my night  
You ruin everything I do  
You're killing in my way  
You're killing in my life  
You're killing in everything I do  
  
You're hurting my heart  
You're hurting my pride  
You're hurting everything I own  
You're choking my head  
It's choking inside  
Why don't you leave my life alone  
  
I just want to do it like it used to be  
So, why don't you leave it up to me  
I want to tell you if you think it's right  
Baby, won't you do it right?
