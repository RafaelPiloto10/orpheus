My friend called just the other day  
Packed it up he won't be back this way  
  
It's not your heart but the spirit they break  
There's only so much a small town boy can take  
  
See the eyes of the countless masses  
Drinking life from the empty glasses  
  
Chorus:  
No more victims  
No more lies  
Ne sheer heart attacks  
No more empty promises  
No more lookin' back  
  
I came here loaded searching for the dream  
But nothing is ever easy as it seems  
  
I thought I got closer to it every day  
But every day it just got so far away  
  
See all the faces paled  
Shot to hell when the system failed  
  
Chorus  
  
I thought I could take all the shit in grind  
And stand much more pain  
But see all those dead end wishes  
Eats away at the brain  
  
Solo, chorus
