Silent night, holy night  
All is calm, all is bright  
Round yon virgin, mother and child  
Holy infant so tender and mild  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
  
Silent night, holy night  
Shepherds quake at the sight  
Heavenly hosts from Heaven above  
Guardian angels sing Alleluia  
Christ our savior is born  
Christ our savior is born  
  
Silent night, holy night  
All is calm, all is bright  
Round yon virgin, mother and child  
Holy infant so tender and mild  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
Sleep in heavenly peace
