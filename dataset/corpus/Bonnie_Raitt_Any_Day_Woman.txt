If you don't love her, you'd better let her go  
You'll never fool her, you're bound to let it show  
Love's so hard to take when you have to fake  
Everything in return, you just preserve her  
When you serve her a little tenderness  
If she's a woman, she'll try to make it last  
If you're a man now you'd better end it fast  
There's no reason here, no treason here  
Just the way a woman's mind, well she has no name  
She has no shame, she just loves you  
It's not easy to undo what's done  
Or to speak too freely to just anyone  
And if this takes more than you bargained for  
Boy it's time you learn, not to talk so loud  
Walk so proud when you're comin' on
