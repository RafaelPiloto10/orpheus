We heard the fireworks. Rushed out to watch the sky. Happy go lucky. Fourth of
July.  
How can you live in the Northeast? How can you live in the South? How can you
build on the banks of a river when the flood water pours from the mouth? How
can you be a Christian? How can you be a Jew? How can you be a Muslim, a
Buddhist, a Hindu?  
How can you?  
Weak as the winter sun, we enter life on earth. Names and religion come just
after date of birth. Then everybody gets a tongue to speak, and everyone hears
an inner voice. A day at the end of the week to wonder and rejoice.  
If the answer is infinite light, why do we sleep in the dark?  
How can you live in the Northeast? How can live in the South? How can you
build on the banks of a river when the flood water pours from the mouth? How
can you tattoo your body? Why do you cover your head? How can you eat from a
rice bowl, the holy man only breaks bread?  
We watched the fireworks, 'til they were fireflies. Followed a path of stars,
over the endless skies.  
How can you live in the Northeast? How can you live in the South? How can you
build on the banks of a river when the flood water pours from the mouth?  
I've been given all I wanted. Only three generations off the boat. I have
harvested and I've planted. I am wearing my father's old coat.
