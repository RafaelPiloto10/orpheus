Thought I could define it  
One look in your eyes would have proved me wrong.  
I find myself speechless  
This feeling of completeness is so strong  
And now as convinced that my heart had reached it's limit  
Till you created this new place in it  
  
Your touch wraps around  
In love that knows no boundaries  
Now there's nothing I wouldn't do for you  
You're the answer I've been needing  
Life doesn't hold no meaning  
Now... All because of you  
  
Everything is different,  
There's no frame of reference for the way I feel  
Would you look at your face  
I'm still amazed, I can't believe you're real  
I can lie here forever just watching you sleep  
Hanging on every breath that you breathe  
  
Your touch wraps around  
In love that knows no boundaries  
Now there's nothing I wouldn't do for you  
You're the answer I've been needing  
Life doesn't hold no meaning  
Now... All because of you  
  
All Because Of You...  
Mmmmmm
