The selfish, they're all standing in line  
Faithing and hoping to buy themselves time  
Me, I figure as each breath goes by  
I only own my mind  
  
The North is to South what the clock is to time  
There's east and there's west and there's everywhere lying  
I know I was born and I know that I'll die  
The in between is mine  
I am mine  
  
And the feeling it gets left behind  
All the innocence lost at one time  
Significant behind the eyes  
There's no need to hide...  
We're safe tonight  
  
The ocean is full 'cause everyone's crying  
The full moon is looking for friends at high tide  
The sorrow grows bigger when the sorrow's denied  
I only know my mind  
I am mine  
  
And the meaning, it gets left behind  
All the innocents lost at one time  
Significant behind the eyes  
There's no need to hide...  
We're safe tonight  
  
And the feelings that get left behind  
All the innocents broken with lies  
Significance, between the lines  
(We may need to hide)  
  
And the meanings that get left behind  
All the innocents lost at one time  
Significance, between the linesThere's no need to hide
