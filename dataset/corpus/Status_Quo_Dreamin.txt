I heard you cry tonight while you were sleeping tight  
What were you dreamin'?  
Was it another guy and did he make you cry  
While you were dreamin'?  
I don't find it easy to say  
But I think it's right that you have to know  
  
Why won't you understand you're being underhand  
About your dreamin'?  
I love you more and more, of that you can be sure,  
Even your dreamin'.  
I don't mind if you just say  
You dream of us both but I have to know  
You've got to understand you're being underhand about your dreamin'  
  
Dreams, dreams, dreams, some are never long enough  
Dreams, dreams, dreams, some are never good enough  
I wonder do, do, do you ever get to sleep at night?  
Who, who, who is it gonna be tonight?  
  
You've been a naughty girl, you've got me in a whirl  
I do believe it  
You know you can be sure I want you more and more  
Can you believe it?  
I don't find it easy to say  
But I think it's right that you have to know  
You've been a naughty girl, you've got me in a whirl  
I do believe it  
You are a naughty girl, you've got me in a whirl  
Can you believe it?  
You've been a naughty girl, you've got me in a whirl  
About your dreamin'  
About your dreamin'  
About your dreamin'
