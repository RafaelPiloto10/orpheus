[Hook: Chris Brown]  
Ooh she wildin', wildin'  
She do her thang thang (x4)  
She just wanna shake something  
Girl that ass gon' make money  
Ooh she wildin, wildin'  
She do her thang thang  
Said she like it raw beat that pussy up  
You ain't never fuck a thug  
You gon' fall in in love  
A bottle of that liquid courage on the way now  
All my ladies taking shots, under the vape now  
  
[Verse 1: Fabolous]  
I said ooh, she wildin' wildin', she do her thang thang  
Lames get shot down, she do a bang bang  
She attract rappers and the ones who who the same thang  
Playas in the league and dope boys who slang thangs  
All tryna pull up on her, all she do is lane change  
They be all in the air, 100 be the main thing  
Tryna lock her down, she ain't with the Chain Gang  
Wanna make her wifey, but no name change  
She be on that Brikin to Chanel type of name change  
She be stuntin', she be on her Jackie Chan thang  
Big chain Rollie in the sky, let your thang swang  
Mike with the iced out, Mike plain Jane  
Either way you know what time it is, gotta maintain  
Mr. Childs' girl, not a pimp chain thang  
Whole crew bad, it's a pretty gang thang  
Long hair, don't care, let it hang thang

[Verse 2: Fabolous]  
I said ooh, she pop a Molly and do her thang thang  
Take the grapefruit and do that brain thang  
Man, that ruby red, that shit done change things  
I'ma bout to bust, but before I go bang bang  
Hold up, she climb up on it like she King Kong  
Back and forth on that table, like she ping pong  
She tell me play the dirty version on the clean song  
She tell me fuck her in the dark, with my bling on  
And she do this thing to me, she know I like  
She need no one to check, she know that mic  
She like when Spider-Man climb up them walls  
She be so wet, feel like you in The Falls  
She like Niagara, man fuck your Viagra  
She make you cum fast and fuck up your swagger  
She make you come back, like that boomerrang  
Ooh she be wildin' when she do her thang

Ooh she be wildin' when she do her thang
