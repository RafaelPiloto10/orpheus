No one loves me better  
No one ever could  
I wish someone would have warned me  
That you would be so good  
  
Oh, you you you you've ruined me  
Oh, you you you you've ruined me  
Go on and take a bow  
I can't help loving how you've ruined me  
Yeah, you've ruined me  
  
Guess my hands are tied here  
How far do you want to take this  
If my mouth's done too much talking  
You should stop me with your kiss  
  
Oh, you you you you've ruined me  
Oh, you you you you've ruined me  
Go on and take a bow  
I can't help loving how you've ruined me  
Yeah, you've ruined me  
  
To me it's a revelation  
To you it's no surprise  
All the things that you do to me  
That make me come alive  
I could be the best thing  
That's ever happened to you  
Touch me, hold me, teach me, show me  
How to ruin you too  
  
Oh, you you you you've ruined me  
Oh, you you you you've ruined me  
Go on and take a bow  
I can't help loving how you've ruined me  
Yeah, you've ruined me
