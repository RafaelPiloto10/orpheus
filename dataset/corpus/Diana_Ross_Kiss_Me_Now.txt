Kiss me now  
While my lips are burning up for your sweet taste  
Kiss me now  
Long to feel the fiery aid of your embrace  
Kiss me now  
That you're someone very special in my life  
Kiss me now  
Love you, and I want you by my side  
Kiss me now  
  
Love me now  
I ain't had no loving on since yesterday  
Baby, tell me how  
You expect someone to live a life that way  
Each and every day, baby  
I've been hoping that you will give in  
Give in, give in, give in  
You mean more to me than just a friend  
  
Kiss me now  
I've been waiting too long  
Years, my dear, my dear, my dear  
I've been very lonely  
And I wish that you were here  
So I could hold you near  
  
I've been hoping that you will give in  
Give in, give in, give in  
You mean more to me than just a friend  
Kiss me now  
Kiss me  
  
Somebody, you gotta kiss me now  
Love me now  
I've been waiting too long  
Years, my dear, my dear  
I've been very lonely  
And I wish that you were here  
So I could hold you  
Hoping that you will give in  
You mean more to me than just a friend  
Kiss me now  
Kiss me now  
Kiss me now  
Kiss me now
