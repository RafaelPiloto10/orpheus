You must leave now  
Take what you need, you think will last  
But whatever you wish to keep  
You'd better grab it fast  
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun  
Crying like a fire in the sun  
Look out the saints are coming through  
And it's all over now, baby blue  
The highway is for gamblers  
Better use your sense  
Take what you have  
Gathered from coincidence  
The empty-handed painter from your streets  
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets  
This sky, too, is folding under you  
And it's all over now, baby blue  
All your seasick sailors  
They are rowing home  
Your empty-handed  
Armies are all going home  
The lover who just walked out your door  
Has taken all his blankets from the floor  
The carpet, too, is moving under you  
And it's all over now, baby blue  
Leave your stepping stones behind you  
Something calls for you  
Forget the dead you've left  
They will not follow you  
The vagabond who's rapping at your door  
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore  
Strike another match, go start anew  
And it's all over now, baby blue
