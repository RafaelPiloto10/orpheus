I don't want to be the kind to hesitate  
Be too shy, wait to late  
I don't care what they say other lovers do  
I just want to dance with you  
I got a feeling that you have a heart like mine,  
So let it show, let it shine  
Oh, if we have change to make one heart of two  
Then I just want to dance with you  
  
Chorus:  
I want to dance with you  
Twirl you all around the floor  
That's what they invented dancing for,  
I just want to dance with you  
I want to dance with you  
Hold you in my arms once more  
That's what they invented dancing for,  
I just want to dance with you  
  
I caught you lookin' at me when I looked at you  
Yes, I did, ain't that true  
You won't get embarrassed by the things I do  
I just want to dance with you  
Oh, the boys are playing softly and the girls are too  
So am I, and so are you  
If this was a movie then we're right on cue  
I just want to dance with you  
  
Repeat chorus:  
  
Repeat chorus:  
  
Ending:  
I just want to dance with you  
I just want to dance with you  
I just want to dance with you
