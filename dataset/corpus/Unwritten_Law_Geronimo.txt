Don't want to think about it anymore  
Lying curled and naked on the floor  
And I don't want to hear those words you say  
What were they anyway?  
  
[Chorus]  
Whoa-oh  
Whoa-oh  
So here I go  
(So here I go, so here I go)  
Whoa-oh  
Whoa-oh  
Geronimo  
  
Don't want to get up outta bed today  
It seems much harder than it was yesterday  
And I don't want to hear those words you say  
What were they anyway?  
What were they anyway?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let's leave today  
And forget everything  
Can't really take this place  
So what you say?  
  
Let's leave it all behind  
And don't look back  
We won't rewind this time  
Let's get away  
  
[Chorus: x2]
