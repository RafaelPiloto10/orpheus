I'm young in my camper van  
The world feels old and new  
I fear the future man  
As I take in the view  
Don't know where to head now  
Give up? Go back?  
My friends are all dead now  
Or stifled in the sack  
  
Sound round,  
Feel the ground  
Feel the pulse  
We have found  
  
Breathe in  
Feel the spin  
Where's the dream  
That we were in?  
  
Sound round,  
Feel the ground  
Feel the pulse  
We have found
