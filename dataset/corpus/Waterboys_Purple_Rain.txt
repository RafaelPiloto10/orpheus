I never meant to cause you any trouble  
I never meant to cause you any pain  
I only ever wanted to see you laughing  
Only want to see you laughing in the purple rain  
Purple rain, purple rain  
Purple rain, purple rain  
Purple rain, purple rain  
Only want to see you underneath the purple rain  
  
Honey, I never wanted to be your wicked lover  
Only wanted to be some kind of friend  
I could never leave you for another  
It's such a shame our friendship had to end  
Purple rain, purple rain  
Purple rain, purple rain  
Purple rain, purple rain  
Only wanted to see you underneath the purple rain  
  
Honey, I know, I know, I know times are changing  
This time we all reach out for something new  
That means you too  
You say you're looking for a leader,  
But you can't seem to make up your mind  
But you better open it up wide, let it guide you  
To the purple rain  
Purple rain, purple rain  
Purple rain, purple rain  
Purple rain, purple rain  
Only want to see you, baby, in the purple rain
