Holy man tiptoed his way across the Ganges  
The sound of magic music in his ears  
Videoed by a bus load of tourists  
Shinny shell suits and drinking lemonade  
Now I got a funny feeling  
Which I bought mail order  
From a man in a teepee in California  
Said he once was a great game show performer  
Then he blew all his money away  
Blew it all away  
  
So take me home  
Don't leave alone  
I'm not that good  
But I'm not that bad  
No psycho killer  
Hooligan gorilla  
I dream to riot  
Oh you should try it  
I'll eat parole get gold card soul  
My joy of life is on a roll  
And we'll all be the same in the end  
  
Then you're on your own  
  
Well we go happy day glow in the discos  
The sound of magic music in our brains  
Someone stumbles to the bathroom  
with the horrors  
Says lord give me time for I've jumped into space  
I'm in outer space  
  
So take me home  
Don't leave alone  
I'm not that good  
But I'm not that bad  
No psycho killer  
Hooligan gorilla  
I dream to riot  
Oh you should try it  
I'll eat parole get gold card soul  
My joy of life is on a roll  
And we'll all be the same in the end
