Seems they got a runaround, a runaround where they stand  
All over, yeah, all over you  
Think they got an underground, an underground where they plan  
Right under, yeah, right under you  
Think you get the left hand  
Backhand slap, then you're going to do your living on the downside  
  
God can't hear when I call  
And God can't know, just when I fall  
God can't see where I stand  
So God can't be my left hand man  
All I have is hatred when the fire fills my eye  
Right under, yeah, right under me  
And all I have is fate when the numbers fill the sky  
Right over, yeah, right over me  
Think I'll use the left hand  
  
Am I spent, laid-out got no more to see  
With a locked down, tight clamp all over me  
No love, just like before, am I one more, no more  
Have I crashed, crashed and burned  
Have I cashed in, not to return  
Have I taken, taken my last ride  
Do you feel what I feel inside  
Over, over and done  
Well I found something that I can't outrun  
Watching, waiting, open the door  
Am I one more, no more
