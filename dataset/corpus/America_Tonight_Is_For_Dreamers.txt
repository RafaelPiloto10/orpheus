Here i am, there you are  
Who would believe we could come this far  
We're beneath this magic moon  
The ocean plays it's own sweet tune  
The summer breeze it whispers low  
It tells us something we both know  
  
Tonight is for dreamers  
Tonight someone up there has seen us  
How we feel for each other  
There could be no other  
So he sent these words from above  
Tonight is for falling in love  
Oo, ah  
  
(oo, la, la ... ) tonight there's magic in the air  
Look around, it's everywhere  
Hear the sand birds bill and coo  
Actin' like they know it too  
Hear the wind pass through the trees  
Like it's tellin' everyone it sees  
  
Tonight is for dreamers  
Tonight someone up there has seen us  
How we feel for each other (ah)  
There could be no other  
So he sent these words from above  
Tonight is for falling in love  
  
There can't have ever been such a night  
I don't want it to end  
With you in my arms girl i feel so high  
Hell, i don't ever want to descend  
  
Tonight is for dreamers  
Tonight someone up there has seen us  
How we feel for each other (ah)  
There could be no other  
So he sent these words from above  
(i love you)  
  
Tonight is for dreamers  
Tonight someone up there has seen us  
And i can't hold you enough (oo)  
  
Tonight is for dreamers  
Tonight someone up there has seen us  
He sent these words from above  
Tonight is for falling in love
