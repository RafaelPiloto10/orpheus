Where I am, what I am  
You're the only reason  
Held me up, filled my cup,  
Had the faith in me and love....  
  
Owe it all to you, knowin' we're in love  
There's nothing I can't do  
And I'm not afraid to lose my way  
'Cause if I walk a crooked street  
You're there to lead me home  
  
I've been through bad times  
And some times worse  
And till I met you 'happy' was just a word  
But that all changed the day you came  
Now if I walk a crooked street  
You're there to lead me home  
  
[Guitar instrumental]  
  
And I'm not afraid to lose my way  
'Cause if I walk a crooked street  
You're there to lead me home  
If I walk a crooked street  
You're there to lead me home
