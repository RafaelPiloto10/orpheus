The stage is set tonight down in Nashville  
It's been a long, hard ride into town  
And thanks to some cowboys and heros  
My chance to sing has finally come around  
  
The first song I ever sang was haggard  
Momma sang to me I saw the Light  
I'd turn my radio up louder  
To hear Johnny Cash walk the line  
  
Waylon sang a song about Texas  
Willie's "Blue Eyes Crying In The Rain"  
Bocephus sings a song about dixie.  
Lefty taught us all how to sing.  
  
Hats off to hard riding cowboys  
Riding some where tonight  
Hats off to hard riding cowboys  
Wanted, dead or alive  
  
Charlie ran the devil out of Georgia  
Skynyrd sang sweet home Alabam  
The Ahlman brothers taught us how to ramble  
And to Tucker boys showed us how to jam.  
  
Hats off to hard riding cowboys  
Riding some where tonight  
Hats off to hard riding cowboys  
Wanted, dead or alive  
  
The stage is set tonight up in Heaven  
Rebas band is there with Patsy Cline  
And all around are cowboys and cowgirls  
And thanks to them the music's still alive  
  
Hats off to hard riding cowboys  
Flying somewhere tonight  
Hats off to hard fighting cowboys  
Wanted, dead or alive  
  
Hats off to hard riding cowboys  
Flying somewhere tonight  
Hats off to hard fighting cowboys  
Wanted, dead or alive
