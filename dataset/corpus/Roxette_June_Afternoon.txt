Didn't I tell you everything is possible  
In this deja vu?  
Try the river boat, the carousel,  
feed the pigeons, Barbeque.  
  
Look at all the people, happy faces all around  
Smiling, throwing kisses, busy making lazy sounds  
  
It's a bright June Afternoon, it never gets dark  
Wah-Wah! Here comes the sun  
Get your green green tambourine, let's play in the park  
Wah-Wah! Here comes the sun  
  
Some folks are on blankets, slowly daydreaming  
And reaching for their food  
Let's go buy an ice-cream  
And a magazine with an attitude  
  
And put on a cassette, we can pretend that you're a star  
'Cause life's so very simple, just like la-la-la  
  
It's a bright June Afternoon, it never gets dark  
Wah-Wah! Here comes the sun  
Get your green green tambourine, let's play in the park  
Wah-Wah! Here comes the sun, comes the sun  
  
There's a painter painting his masterpiece  
There's some squirrels jumping in the trees  
There's a wide-eyed boy with a red balloon  
All my life I've longed for this afternoon  
  
It's a bright June Afternoon, it never gets dark  
Wah-Wah! Here comes the sun  
Get your green green tambourine, let's play in the park  
Wah-Wah! Here comes the sun
