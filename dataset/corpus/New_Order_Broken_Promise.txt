Oh I don't know why people lie  
And I don't know why people die  
Every time I see you, you shout at me  
'Cause of all the things in the world that I can't see  
But what I think goes on in this world  
For a mother and a father and a boy and a girl  
Is that the more you earn, the less you learn  
There's a fire in life where we will burn  
  
And I never could believe it  
And I never could be true  
For the things that mean so much to me  
Don't mean that much to you  
And I never could believe  
The way you told me I was wrong  
If I'm right and you are sinful  
Then for God's sake I was wrong  
  
Oh, I don't know how I think this way,  
And yet you sit there looking at me all day  
There's more to you than I can see  
There's a shadow of another hanging over me  
But what I think goes on in this world  
For a mother and a father and a boy and a girl  
Is that the more you earn, the less you learn  
There's a fire in life where we will burn  
  
And I never could believe it  
And I never could be true  
For the things that mean so much to me  
Don't mean that much to you  
And I never could believe  
The way you told me I was wrong  
If I'm right and if you're sinful  
Then for God's sake I was wrong  
  
Oh, I'd tear you out of heaven  
And I'd tear you out of hell  
And I'd see your life in ruins  
Because mine lies there as well  
And I'd cry out in my loneliness  
While you sleep in your peace  
But you'll never see my face again  
While I need words like these
