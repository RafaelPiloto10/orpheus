When I'm on the road playin' in a town without a name,  
And I'm feelin' low an' everybody looks the same.  
Well, you catch my eye, and then you come on strong an' try to make your play.  
Just because we loved tonight, please don't you think it's gonna stay that
way.  
  
Don't you know that you're nothin' more than a one night stand.  
Tomorrow I'll be on my way, an' you can catch me if you can.  
Honey, take me by the hand and play that game again, yeah.  
  
Everywhere I go, the people want to make some time with me.  
That's okay, if the next day I can be free.  
Well, it's feelin' good and you're the one I'm lovin' tonight,  
Well, don't you go and spoil it, babe, by trying to get yourself all uptight.  
  
Don't you know that you're nothing more than a one night stand.  
I'll be on my way an' you can catch me if you can.  
Honey, take me by the hand and play that game again, yeah!!!
