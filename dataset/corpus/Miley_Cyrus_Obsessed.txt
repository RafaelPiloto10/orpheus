Why do I just lie awake and think of you?  
I need some sleep.  
Tomorrow I have things to do.  
Every time I close my eyes I see your face,  
So I try to read, but all I do is lose my place.  
  
[Chorus]  
Am I obsessed with you?  
I do my best not to want you.  
But I do all the time.  
I do all the time.  
  
I just had to call you up and say hello.  
I know it's three a.m.  
And I saw you awhile ago.  
But I still had this aching need to hear your voice  
To know your there  
I don't seem to have any choice.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh yeah.  
I'm so sorry I just had to wake you up.  
I feel so lonely by myself.  
Is this the way it feels when you're in love?  
Or is this something else?  
Yeah  
  
Yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh yeah  
But I do all the time, I want you all the time.  
Am I obsessed with you?
