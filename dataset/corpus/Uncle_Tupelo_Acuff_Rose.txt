Early in the morning, sometimes late at night  
Sometimes I get the feeling that everything's alright  
Early in the evening, sometimes in the day  
Sometimes I get the feeling everything's okay  
Because everything cuts against the tide  
When you're by my side  
Name me a song that everybody knows  
And I'll bet you it belongs to Acuff-Rose  
Children in the playground, the folks in the home  
Anybody anywhere who's ever been alone  
Because everything cuts against the tide  
When I hear that sound
