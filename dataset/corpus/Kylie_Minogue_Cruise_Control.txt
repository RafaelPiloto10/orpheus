Top down, get on the wheel  
Baby things are better when you just feel  
And you do you your own thing  
Ah, just let it swing  
Drive me to I don't care  
I'm enraptured take me anywhere  
I just want to fly  
I like this CD  
  
Turn the music up  
And baby don't slow down  
If you want me  
All you gotta do  
Is keep me going now  
Listen can you give me that  
Baby just hit that  
  
Cruise control  
Ready, get set, go  
You drive me crazy boy  
I like it racy boy  
On cruise control  
We've been on a roll  
Feels like the speed of light  
Sit back and enjoy the ride  
  
Oh no, the lights go green  
Time out, do you know what I mean?  
We're all on our own  
I ain't going home  
Out there I want to be  
No more bumper two bumper cars for me  
We're on the highway  
Put it on replay  
  
Turn the music up  
And baby don't slow down  
If you want me  
All you gotta do  
Is keep me going now  
Listen can you give me that  
Baby just hit that  
  
Cruise control  
Ready, get set, go  
You drive me crazy boy  
I like it racy boy  
On cruise control  
We've been on a roll  
Feels like the speed of light  
Sit back and enjoy the ride  
  
Driving on cruise control  
(Baby can you give me that, baby can you hit that)  
(Can you give me that, baby can you hit that)  
(Can you give me that, baby can you hit that)  
(Can you give me that)  
(Can you give me that)  
(Listen can you give me that, baby just hit that)  
  
Just hit that  
Cruise control  
Ready, get set, go  
You drive me crazy boy  
I like it racy boy  
On cruise control  
We've been on a roll  
Feels like the speed of light  
Sit back and enjoy the ride  
  
Just hit that  
Cruise control  
Ready, get set, go  
You drive me crazy boy  
I like it racy boy  
On cruise control  
We've been on a roll  
Feels like the speed of light  
Sit back and enjoy the ride  
  
Ready, get set, go  
You drive me crazy boy  
I like it racy boy  
On cruise control  
We've been on a roll  
Feels like the speed of light  
Sit back and enjoy the ride
