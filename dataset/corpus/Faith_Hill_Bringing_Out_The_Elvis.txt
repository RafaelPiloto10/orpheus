You're bringing out the Elvis in me  
You're bringing out the Elvis in me  
  
Just like a fossil  
Frozen in time I could not move  
My heart, my soul, my feet  
Then you unearthed me  
And put me in a hot pulsating groove  
Now I'm a slave to the beat  
  
You're bringing out the Elvis in me  
Making my hips want to swing  
You bring out the Elvis in me  
Making me burst out and sing  
  
When I'm with you  
I never have to feel like a sardine  
In a little metal can  
I'm more like a wild shark  
That travels in a pink limosuine, yeah  
Yeah, together with my fans  
  
You're bringing out the Elvis in me  
Making my hips want to swing  
You bring out the Elvis in me  
Making me burst out and sing, oh yeah  
  
People think I'm a silly fool  
Because I think you are so nice and cool  
And some people say  
You're so square  
But I don't care  
You're bringing out the Elvis in me  
You're bringing out the Elvis in me  
  
You're bringing out the Elvis in me  
Making my hips want to swing  
You bring out the Elvis in me  
Making me burst out and sing  
You're bringing out the Elvis in me
