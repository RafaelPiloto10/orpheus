Down at the arcade the defender is there  
Down off of Broadway he's there playing his games  
It's very dangerous putting money down on Robotron  
Oh, I'm the Great Defender  
And I really know just how to get along  
  
Down at the arcade  
Oh, I'm the Great Defender  
And I really think I've got it made  
  
A fistful of quarters, a fifty dollar stake  
Life is a gamble on Videotape  
I called a disc jockey to dedicate a song to Blair  
It's the 'Four Tops' singing 'I'll be there'  
  
Down at the arcade ...  
The president called to give me the news  
I've been awarded the Nobel Price in rhythm and blues  
And Stevie Wonder wants to record one of my songs  
Oh, I'm the Great Defender  
And I really know just how to get along  
  
Oh, I'm the Great Defender, listen to my song  
I really hope you like it, it isn't very long  
It's rooted in the fifties but its heart's in 1984  
And if you really like it  
Then I sing it for you once more  
  
Down at the arcade ...
