When you look to the past for life's long hidden meaning  
For the dreams and the plans made in your youth  
Does the thrill to achieve match the warm hidden feeling  
That lies so still and lives in you  
  
In the eyes of a child there is joy, there is laughter  
There is hope, there is trust, a chance to shape the future  
For the lessons of life there is no better teacher  
Than the look in the eyes of a child  
  
You've found the place to walk the path you've chosen  
You'll never miss the world you left behind  
When life gives life, it's happiness unbroken  
When you give love, it's love you'll find  
  
In the eyes of a child there is joy, there is laughter  
There is hope, there is trust, a chance to shape the future  
For the lessons of life, there is no better teacher  
Than the look in the eyes of a child  
  
In the eyes of a child, there is joy, there is laughter  
There is hope, there is trust, a chance to shape the future  
For the lessons of life, there is no better teacher  
Than the look in the eyes of a child  
  
In the eyes of a child, there is joy, there is laughter  
There is hope, there is trust, a chance to shape the future  
For the lessons of life, there is no better teacher  
Than the look in the eyes of a child
