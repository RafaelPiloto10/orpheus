You lead me through each day  
Your Love it covers me  
And when I feel afraid  
Your Love it covers me  
Restorer of my soul  
Your Love it covers me  
Your presence makes me whole  
Your Love it covers me  
You are the King of Glory  
Youre the Lord Strong and mighty  
King of Glory enter in  
I lift my hands to Heaven  
Shout aloud sing Your praises  
King of Glory enter in  
To You I life my soul  
My God I trust in You  
Show me Your ways O Lord  
My God I trust in You  
Let me not be ashamed  
My God I trust in You  
Ill serve You all my days  
My God I trust in You  
King of Glory  
King of Glory  
King of Glory enter in
