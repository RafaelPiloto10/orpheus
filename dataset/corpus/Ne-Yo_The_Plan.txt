How's everybody doin? Hope you enjoyin' The Truth, The Way, The problem thus
far. This is your friendly host Ne-Yo. I like to entitle this masterpiece here
The Plan. For all my folks in the club, Y'all know what it is rock wit me.  
  
Verse 1  
  
Well can I be honest baby (I don't know your name)  
And if you never told me (Wouldn't bother me just the same)  
I'm tryna get that, get that  
Drop you off somewhere and then get back  
To the club and do it all again  
But let's not focus on the future (Did you come here with your friends,
please, give one of them your keys, cause you comin' wit me)  
Sorry, if I'm bossin' you around but  
I like what I see and I get what I like  
So that's how it's goin' down girl  
  
Chorus  
  
You gon' finish that drink, I'm gon' finish this drink  
We gon' go and get in my ride  
Ok and then  
You gon' take yo clothes off, I'm gon' take my clothes off  
We gon' go somewhere and get right  
Alright hey  
Sound like the plan to me, little mama  
Sound like the plan to me yeah  
Sound like the plan to me, little mama  
Sound like the plan to me yeah  
  
Verse 2  
  
Well can you take me to the place where the grass is greener  
Ladies roll wit me because my whip is cleaner  
Than average come to my crib (hot sex) we havin it  
Slangin' baby, frontin baby, well, that could be handled it  
Can I get a witness, I like girls with thickness (head game insane)  
Stay up out our business  
Shawty, just shake that thang to the sound 'cause  
I like what I see and I get what I like  
And that's how it's goin' down girl  
  
Chorus  
  
You gon' finish that drink, I'm gon' finish this drink  
We gon' go and get in my ride  
Ok and then  
You gon' take yo clothes off, I'm gon' take my clothes off  
We gon' go somewhere and get right  
Alright hey  
Sound like the plan to me, little mama  
Sound like the plan to me yeah  
Sound like the plan to me, little mama  
Sound like the plan to me yeah
