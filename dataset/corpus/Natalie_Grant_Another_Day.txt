Been driving through the night  
I pull up and see the lights  
This is the place that I call home  
I watch you as you sleep  
Think of all you mean to me  
  
Touch your face  
Kiss you softly  
Before I go to sleep pray under the stars  
Search my soul and check my heart  
And thank God for  
  
[Chorus]  
Another day  
Another chance to love the ones I love  
To find my way  
To laugh, to dance  
Watch the sun come up  
Another day I get to live  
As if  
Every breath could be the last I take  
I get another day  
  
I've got a hand that I can hold  
Someone who knows my soul  
A safe place to lay my head at night  
So why do I forget  
How much I've been blessed in life  
Forget what means the most to me  
  
As I'm waking up I feel my beating heart  
So grateful that I've come this far  
And thank God for  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To make somebody smile  
Go the extra mile  
Take a wrong and make it right  
And try to touch somebody's life  
  
I get another day
