I've been away from you a long time  
I never thought I'd miss you so  
Somehow I feel, your love is real,  
Near you I long to be!  
  
The birds are singing, it is song time  
The banjos strummin' soft and low  
I know that you  
Yearn for me too,  
Swanee, you're calling me!  
  
Swanee!  
How I love you, how I love you  
My dear old Swanee!  
I'd give the world to be  
Among the folks in  
D-I-X-I-E ven now my Mammy's waiting for me,  
Praying for me  
Down by the Swanee  
  
The folks up north will see me no more  
When I go to the Swanee Shore!  
  
Swanee!  
How I love you, how I love you  
My dear old Swanee!  
I'd give the world to be  
Among the folks in  
D-I-X-I-E ven now my Mammy's waiting for me,  
Praying for me  
Down by the Swanee  
  
The folks up north will see me no more  
When I go to the Swanee Shore!  
Swanee, Swanee, I'm coming back to Swanee!  
Mammy, Mammy, I love the old folks at home!  
  
Swanee, Swanee, I am coming back to Swanee!  
Mammy, Mammy, I love the old folks at home!
