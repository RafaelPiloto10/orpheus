Fly by night (fly by night)  
Please pity me (fly by night)  
I fall in love so easily  
  
Oh, fly by night (fly by night)  
Don't fly away (from me)  
  
Take my heart (fly by night)  
It's yours alone (fly by night)  
Forever more to have and own  
  
Oh, fly by night (fly by night)  
Don't fly away (from me)  
  
Be my angel true  
Not my butterfly  
For though they both have wings  
Angels don't say goodbye  
  
In my arms (fly by night)  
There's love for you (fly by night)  
So, please say you love me true  
  
Oh, fly by night (fly by night)  
Don't fly away (fly ny night)  
Oh, fly by night (fly by night)  
Don't fly away (fly ny night)  
Oh, fly by night
