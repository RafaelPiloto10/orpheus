They took Your commandments off the schoolhouse walls  
They say, "It's a crime to even pray within the halls"  
But bless the child that lets You in and knows without a doubt  
Once you live inside a heart, they can't take You out  
We are soldiers of the Cross  
We've been found to reach the lost  
In city streets, down country roads  
We take You with us everyday and everywhere we go  
Here's to those across the land, working in a place  
Where the boss man and the government say they can't share their faith  
But they know all too well they'll lose their job if they get caught  
But to win a soul for Jesus, they will risk it all because  
We are soldiers of the Cross  
We've been found to reach the lost  
In city streets, down country roads  
We take You with us everyday and everywhere we go  
In the God of all creation, we put our faith and trust  
And give our lives to You 'cause You gave Your life for us  
We are soldiers of the Cross  
We've been found to reach the lost  
In city streets, down country roads  
We take You with us everyday and everywhere we go  
Everywhere we go
