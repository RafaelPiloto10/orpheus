I am here to tell you we can never meet again  
Simple really, isn't it, a word or two and then  
A lifetime of not knowing where or how or why or when  
You think of me or speak of me or wonder what befell  
The someone you once loved so long ago so well  
  
Never wonder what I'll feel as living shuffles by  
You don't have to ask me and I need not reply  
Every moment of my life from now until I die  
I will think or dream of you and fail to understand  
How a perfect love can be confounded out of hand  
  
Is it written in the stars, are we paying for some crime?  
Is that all that we are good for, just a stretch of mortal time?  
Is this God's experiment in which we had no say?  
In which we're given paradise but only for a day?  
  
Nothing can be altered, oh, there is nothing to decide  
No escape, no change of heart, no any place to hide  
You are all I'll ever want, but this I am denied  
Sometimes in my darkest thoughts, I wish I'd never learned  
What it is to be in love and have that love returned  
  
Is it written in the stars, are we paying for some crime?  
Is that all that we are good for, just a stretch of mortal time?  
Is this God's experiment in which we had no say?  
In which we're given paradise but only for a day?  
  
Is it written in the stars, are we paying for some crime?  
Is that all that we are good for, just a stretch of mortal time?  
Is this God's experiment in which we have no say?  
In which we're given paradise but only for a day?
