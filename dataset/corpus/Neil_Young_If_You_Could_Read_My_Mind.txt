If you could read my mind love  
What a tale my thoughts could tell  
Just like an old time movie  
About a ghost from a wishin' well  
In a castle dark or a fortress strong  
With chains upon my feet  
  
You know that ghost is me  
And I will never be set free  
As long as I'm a ghost, you can see  
  
If I could read your mind love  
What a tale your thoughts could tell  
Just like a paperback novel  
The kind the drugstore sells  
When you reach the part where the heartaches  
Come the hero would be me  
  
Heroes often fail  
And you won't read that book again  
Because the endings just to hard to take  
  
I'd walk away like a movie star  
Who gets burned in a three way script  
Enter number two, a movie queen  
To play the scene of bringing  
All the good things out in me  
But for now love let's be real  
  
I never thought I could act this way  
And I've got to say that I just don't get it  
I don't know where we went wrong  
But the feelings gone and I just can't get it back  
  
If you could read my mind love  
What a tale my thoughts could tell  
Just like an old time movie  
About a ghost from a wishing well  
In a castle dark or a fortress strong  
With chains upon my feet the story always ends  
  
If you read between the lines  
You'll know that I'm just trying to understand  
The feelings that you lack  
  
I never knew I could feel this way  
And I've got to say that I just don't get it  
I don't know where we went wrong  
But the feelings gone and I just can't get it back
