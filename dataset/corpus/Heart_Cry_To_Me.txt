Poor little dreamer  
Stand inside the door  
You can't find the easy rhymes  
Of time you had before  
  
It hurts my heart so bad  
Seeing you sigh and shake  
Broken down so low, so sad  
I can't let you break  
  
Cry to me, cry to me  
You better not hide it  
Let it come, let it bleed  
I ain't laughing, reach in and get it  
And set it free  
Cry to me, cry to me  
  
The glass is empty and the wine  
Is bitter on your tongue  
People don't seen wild and fine  
Like when you were young  
  
You're lonesome over a stormy ocean  
Lost in the rain and wind  
We can clear these clouds away  
And feel the sun again
