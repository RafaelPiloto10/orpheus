Oh, the weather outside is frightful  
But the fire is so delightful  
And since we've no place to go  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!  
  
Hey! It doesn't show signs of stopping  
And I've brought some corn for popping  
The lights are turned way down low  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!  
  
And when we finally kiss good night  
How I'll hate going out in the storm  
But if you really hold me tight  
All the way home I'll be warm.  
  
The fire is slowly dying  
Hey! and, Honey, we're still good-bying  
But as long as you love me so,  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!...
