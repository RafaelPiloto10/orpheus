Think of London, a small city  
  
It's dark, dark in the daytime  
The people sleep, sleep in the daytime  
If they want to, if they want to  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm checking them out  
I'm checking them out  
I got it figured out  
I got it figured out  
There's good points and bad points  
Find a city  
Find myself a city to live in.  
  
There are a lot of rich people in Birmingham  
A lot of ghosts in a lot of houses  
Look over there!...A dry ice factory  
A good place to get some thinking done  
  
Down El Paso way things get pretty spread out  
People got no idea where in the world they are  
They go up north and come back south  
Still got no idea where in the world they are.  
Did I forget to mention, to mention Memphis  
Home of Elvis and the ancient Greeks  
Do I smell? I smell home cooking  
It's only the river, it's only the river.
