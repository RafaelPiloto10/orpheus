Time keeps moving on,  
Friends they turn away,  
Well, I keep moving on  
But I never found out why  
I keep pushing so hard a dream,  
I keep trying to make it right  
Through another lonely day  
  
Whoa don't discover it lasts  
Twenty-five years, uh honey just one night, oh yeah  
Well I'm twenty-five years older now  
So I know it can't be right  
And I'm no better baby and I can't help you no more  
Than I did when just a girl  
  
But it don't make no difference babe, no, no,  
'Cause I know that I could always try  
It don't make no difference baby, yeah  
I'm gonna hold it now,  
I'm gonna need it yeah,  
I'm gonna use it till the day I die  
  
Don't, expect any answers, dear,  
Well, I know that they don't come with age, no, no,  
I ain't never gonna love you any better baby  
I'm never gonna love you right  
So you better take it now, right now, ohh  
  
It don't make no difference baby,  
I know that I could always try  
There's a fire inside of every one of us  
You'd better need it now,  
I get to hold it yeah,  
I'm gonna use it till the day I die  
  
Don't make no difference, babe, no, no, no,  
And it never ever will, eh,  
I wanna talk about a little bit of loving, yeah,  
I get to hold it, baby,  
I'm gonna need it now,  
I'm gonna use it, say, aaaah  
  
Don't make no difference, babe, yeah,  
Ah honey, I'd hate to be the one  
I said you're gonna live your life  
And you're better love your life  
Or babe, someday you're gonna have to cry.  
Yes indeed, yes indeed, yes indeed,  
Ah baby, yes indeed.  
  
I said you, you're always gonna hurt me,  
I said you're always gonna let me down,  
I said everywhere, every day, every day  
And every way, every way  
Ah honey won't you hold on to what's gonna move  
I said it's gonna disappear when you turn your back  
I said you know it ain't gonna be there  
When you wanna reach out and grab on  
  
Whoa babe,  
Whoa babe,  
Whoa babe,  
Oh but keep truckin' on  
Whoa yeah,
