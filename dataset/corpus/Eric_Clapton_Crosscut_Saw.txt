I'm a crosscut saw,  
Baby, drag me across your log.  
I'm a crosscut saw,  
Baby, drag me across your log.  
I cut your wood so easy for you,  
You can't help but say, "Hot Dog!"  
  
Some call me Woodcutting Sam,  
Some call me Woodcutting Jim.  
The last girl I cut wood for,  
She wants me back again.  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm a crosscut saw,  
Baby, drag me across your log.  
I cut your wood so easy for you,  
You can't help but say, "Hot Dog!"  
  
I got a double-bladed axe  
That really cuts good.  
Well, I'm a crosscut saw,  
Gonna bury me in your wood.  
  
[Chorus]
