Sing, sing a song  
Make it simple to last  
Your whole life long  
Don't worry that it's not  
Good enough for anyone  
Else to hear  
Just sing, sing a song  
  
Why do stars  
Fall down from the sky?  
Everytime you walk by  
Just like me  
They long to be  
Close to you  
  
Just like me  
They long to be  
Close to you  
  
Ooh-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, close to you  
Ooh-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, close to you  
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, close to you  
  
Let's take a lifetime to say  
I knew you well  
For only time will tell us so  
And love may grow for all we know  
  
He's got a ticket to ride  
He's got a ticket to ride  
He's got a ticket to ride  
And he don't care (Baby, baby)  
Don't care (Baby, baby)  
  
Baby, baby  
Feels like maybe things will be all right  
Baby, baby  
Your love's made me  
Free as a song singin' forever  
  
Only yesterday when I was sad  
And I was lonely  
You showed me the way to leave  
The past and all it's tears behind me  
Tomorrow may be even brighter than today  
Since I threw my sadness away  
Only yesterday  
  
(Guitar Solo)  
  
When there's no gettin' over that rainbow  
When my smallest of dreams won't come true  
I can take all the madness the world has to give  
But I won't last a day without you  
  
I don't wanna talk  
About the things we've gone through  
Though it's hurting me  
Now it's history  
I've played all my cards  
And that's what you've done too  
Nothing more to say  
No more ace to play  
  
I don't wanna talk  
If it makes you feel sad  
And I understand  
You've come to shake my hand  
I apologize  
If it makes you feel bad  
Seeing me so tense  
No self-confidence  
  
The winner takes it all, oh  
  
(Guitar Solo Continued)  
  
The winner takes it all  
The loser standing small  
Beside the victory  
That's her destiny, hee  
  
I can't live, if living is without you  
I can't live, I can't give anymore (The winner takes it all, oh)  
I can't live, if living is without you  
I can't live, I can't give anymore  
I can't live, if living is without you  
I can't live, I can't give anymore, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
(Guitar Solo Until End)
