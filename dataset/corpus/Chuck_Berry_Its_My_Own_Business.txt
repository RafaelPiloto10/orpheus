I am tired of you telling me what I ought to do  
Stickin' your nose in my business and it don't concern you  
It's my own business, it's my own business  
Seems like the ones that want to tell you  
They don't ever know as much as you  
If I go buy a Cadillac convertible coupe  
And all I got at home to eat is just onion soup  
It's my own business, it's my own business  
If I would rather ride around  
In my own Cadillac convertible coupe  
If I's a dignatary on Capitol Hill  
And up and married me a waitress in a hot dog grill  
It's my own business, it's my own business  
Because I am not a juvenile  
And I can go out at my own free wil  
After workin' on my job and then drawin' my pay  
If I want to go out and have a ball and throw it all away  
It's my own business, it's my own business  
'Cause I don't wait until tomorrow  
To do something I could do today
