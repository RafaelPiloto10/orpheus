Where do you stand  
What is your statement  
What is it you're trying to say  
What's in your hand  
What's in your basement  
What's in the cards you don't play  
Are you holding the key  
Or are you intending  
To pick the lock of heaven's gate  
It's confusing to me  
The message you're sending  
And I don't know if I can relate  
  
[Chorus]  
What's you line  
Tell me why you wear your cross of gold  
State of mind  
Or does it find a way into your soul  
  
Is it a flame  
Is it a passion  
A symbol of love living in you  
Or is it a game  
Religion in fashion  
Some kind of phase you're going through  
We all travel the extremes  
From cellar to rafter  
Looking for a place in the sun  
So I'm trying to see  
What you're headed after  
But I don't know where you're coming from  
  
For some it's simply something to wear around your neck  
Just a chain  
Jewelry  
Is it decoration?  
Is it an icon  
Or proclamation?  
An icon of what?  
What?  
For some it's simply something to wear around your neck  
Just a chain  
It means a lot more than that to me  
  
[Chorus]
