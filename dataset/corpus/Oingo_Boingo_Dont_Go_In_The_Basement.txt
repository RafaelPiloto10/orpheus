Oh..  
You can tell a dirty story  
In the old conservatory...  
  
But don't go in the basement!  
  
You can make a scene  
On the mezanene  
  
But don't go in the basement!  
  
You can fill yourself with static  
With the ghosts up in the attic  
  
But don't go in the basement!  
  
You can light yourself a torch  
On the old front porch  
  
But don't go in the basement!  
  
Oh you may think that it's real cool  
To ride down the bannister like some darn fool  
Oh don't go... Don't go!!  
Don't go in the basement!  
  
You can feel quite aloof  
Playing rummy on the roof  
  
But don't go in the basement!  
  
Where the cockroaches dance  
You can wallow in romance  
  
But don't go in the basement!  
  
You may think that it's deluxe  
To ride the elevator filled with ducks  
  
Oh don't go, don't go!  
Don't go in the basement!!!!
