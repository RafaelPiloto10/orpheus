I stand at your gate and the song that I sing is of moonlight  
I stand and I wait for the touch of your hand in the June night  
The roses are sighing a moonlight serenade  
  
The stars are a glow and tonight how their light sets me dreaming  
My love, do you know that your eyes are like stars brightly beaming?  
I bring you and sing you a moonlight serenade  
  
Let us stray till break of day in love's valley of dreams  
Just you and I a summer sky, a heavenly breeze kissing the trees  
So don't let me wait come to me tenderly in the June night  
I stand at your gate and I sing you a song in the moonlight  
A love song, my darling, a moonlight serenade  
We can stay, till break of day
