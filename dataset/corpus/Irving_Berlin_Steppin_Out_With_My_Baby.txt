Here he comes lookin' for his baby  
It's for sure, sure and not for maybe  
Don't ask when will the lucky day be  
Here he comes and let him tell you himself:  
  
If I seem to scintillate  
It's because I've got a date  
A date with a package of  
The good things that come with love  
You don't have to ask me  
I won't waste your time  
But if you should ask me  
Why I feel sublime  
I'm  
  
Steppin' out with my baby  
Can't go wrong 'cause I'm in right  
It's for sure, not for maybe  
That I'm all dressed up tonight  
  
Steppin' out with my honey  
Can't be bad to feel so good  
Never felt quite so sunny  
And I keep on knockin' wood  
  
There'll be smooth sailin' 'cause I'm trimmin' my sails  
With a bright shine on my shoes and on my nails  
[alternate line: In my top hat and my white tie and my tails]  
  
Steppin' out with my baby  
Can't go wrong 'cause I'm in right  
Ask me when will the day be  
The big day may be tonight
