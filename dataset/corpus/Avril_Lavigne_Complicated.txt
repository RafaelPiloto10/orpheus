Uh huh, life's like this  
Uh huh, uh huh, that's the way it is  
'Cause life's like this  
Uh huh, uh huh that's the way it is  
  
Chill out, what you yellin' for?  
Lay back, it's all been done before  
And if you could only let it be  
You will see  
I like you the way you are  
When we're drivin' in your car  
And you're talking to me one on one  
But you've become  
  
Somebody else 'round everyone else  
You're watching your back like you can't relax  
You're tryin' to be cool  
You look like a fool to me  
Tell me  
  
Why do you have to go and make things so complicated?  
I see the way you're  
Acting like you're somebody else, gets me frustrated  
And life's like this you,  
You fall and you crawl and you break and you take what you get and you turn it
into  
Honesty, you promised me I'm never gonna find you fake it  
No, no, no  
  
You come over unannounced  
Dressed up like you're somethin' else  
Where you are ain't where it's at you see, you're making me  
Laugh out when you strike your pose  
Take off all your preppy clothes  
You know, you're not fooling anyone  
When you've become  
  
Somebody else 'round everyone else  
You're watchin' your back like you can't relax  
You're tryin' to be cool  
You look like a fool to me  
Tell me  
  
Why do you have to go and make things so complicated?  
I see the way you're  
Acting like you're somebody else, gets me frustrated  
And life's like this you,  
You fall and you crawl and you break and you take what you get and you turn it
into  
Honesty, you promised me, I'm never gonna find you fake it  
No, no, no  
  
No, no, no (No)  
No, no, no (No)  
No, no, no (No)(No)  
  
Chill out, what you yellin' for?  
Lay back, it's all been done before  
And if you could only let it be  
You will see  
  
Somebody else 'round everyone else

into  
Honesty, you promised me, I'm never gonna find you fake it  
No, no  
  
Why do you have to go and make things so complicated? (Yeah, yeah)  
I see the way you're  
Acting like you're somebody else, gets me frustrated  
And life's like this you,  
You fall and you crawl and you break and you take what you get and you turn it
into

No, no, no
