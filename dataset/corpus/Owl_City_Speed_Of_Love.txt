I tried to disappear  
But your the only reason I'm floating here  
Eyes painted crystal clear  
I can see our future through the atmosphere  
  
Don't you go, no, don't you go  
Don't you know I'm up here alone  
Yeah, I am like a satellite  
Sending you a signal tonight  
  
Oh, oh, oh like a streak of light  
Oh, oh, oh watch the world fly by  
Oh, oh, oh rev your engine up  
Everybody's racing at the speed of love  
  
You were so hard to find  
With oh, so many clouds across my summer sky  
You, my constellation prize  
Yeah, every single star is sparkling in your eyes  
  
So, don't you go, no, don't you go  
'Cause don't you know I'm up here alone  
So high, like a satellite  
I'm sending you a signal tonight  
Oh, oh, oh like a streak of light  
Oh, oh, oh watch the world fly by  
Oh, oh, oh rev your engine up  
Everybody's racing at the speed of love  
  
Oh, oh, oh like a streak of light  
Oh, oh, oh watch the world fly by  
Oh, oh, oh rev your engine up  
Everybody's racing at the speed of love  
  
(One track, one mind, one race to win)  
(One start, one heart, one life to live)  
(One track, one mind, one race to win)  
(One start, one heart, one life to live)  
  
Oh, oh, oh like a streak of light  
Oh, oh, oh watch the world fly by  
Oh, oh, oh rev your engine up  
Everybody's racing at the speed of love  
  
Oh, oh, oh like a streak of light  
Oh, oh, oh watch the world fly by  
Oh, oh, oh rev your engine up  
Everybody's racing at the speed of love
