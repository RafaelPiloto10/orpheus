Yeah!  
  
Oh, sweet Mary, child of confusion, she runs the hills to cry  
Past the willows or an illusion, Lord, tell me the reason why.  
Tell me why, why is it all so hard ?  
Breathing in the air Breathe in the air  
Anyone to care.  
Oh!  
  
(Alright, yeah!)  
  
Oh, sweet Mary, in our story, have we nothing left to give ?  
But don't we all know, babe, if we're pressed to, that that's the way we live.  
Tell me why, why is it all so hard ?  
Breathing in the air Breathing in the air  
Anyone to care, oh, yeah!  
  
Hop now, hop now, hop now, hop now, hop now, hop now,  
Hop now, hop now, hop now, hop now, hop now, hop now, whoa, yeah!
