Mayan moon was burning  
We saw visions  
Of the past returning  
On the shore  
The band was playing  
We all heard  
What the moon was saying  
  
The world keeps closing in  
It has before  
It will again  
A voice beyond the wind  
Says we must go  
Beyond the end  
So follow  
Beyond the end  
  
A sea of friends are singing  
Vaya con dios  
Mis amigos  
We take their hopes and feelings  
To some new world  
We'll be revealing  
  
Old worlds keep closing in  
They have before  
They will again  
Voices call  
Beyond the wind  
Say we must go  
Beyond the end  
And follow  
Beyond the end
