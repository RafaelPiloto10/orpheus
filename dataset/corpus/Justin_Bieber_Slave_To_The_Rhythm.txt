[Verse:]  
She dances in the sheets at night  
She dances to his needs  
She dances 'til he feels just right  
Until he falls asleep...  
  
She dances at the break of dawn  
And quickly cooks his food  
She can't be late, can't take too long  
The kids must get to school  
  
[Chorus:]  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
She's a slave to the rhythm of  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
A slave to the rhythm of  
A rhythm of love, a rhythm of love  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
She's a slave to the rhythm of  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
A slave to the rhythm of  
A rhythm of love, a rhythm of love  
  
She dances for the men at work  
Who works her all the time  
She can't be rude as she says so  
"I must be home tonight"  
  
She dances to the kitchen stove  
Dinner is served by nine  
She sets his food an hour late  
She must be out of her mind...  
  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
She's a slave to the rhythm of  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
She's a slave to the rhythm of  
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love  
  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
She's a slave to the rhythm of  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
She's a slave to the rhythm of  
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love  
  
She works so hard, just to make her way  
For a man who just won't appreciate  
  
And don't know it takes  
And was all in vain.  
Still she could not stop,  
Couldn't break his chains  
  
She danced the night  
That they fell out  
She swore she'd dance no more  
But then she did, she did not quit  
And she ran out the door  
  
She danced through the night  
In fear of her life  
She danced to a beat of her own  
  
She let out a cry and  
Swallowed her pride  
She knew she was needed  
Back home, home  
  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
She's a slave to the rhythm of  
A slave to the rhythm  
A slave to the rhythm of  
The rhythm of love  
The rhythm of love  
  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
She's a slave to the rhythm of  
A slave to the rhythm  
A slave to the rhythm of  
The rhythm of love  
The rhythm of love  
  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
She's a slave to the rhythm of  
A slave to the rhythm  
A slave to the rhythm of  
The rhythm of love  
The rhythm of love  
  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
She's a slave to the rhythm of  
A slave to the rhythm  
A slave to the rhythm of  
The rhythm of love  
The rhythm of love  
  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
She's a slave to the rhythm of  
A slave to the rhythm  
A slave to the rhythm of  
The rhythm of love  
The rhythm of love
