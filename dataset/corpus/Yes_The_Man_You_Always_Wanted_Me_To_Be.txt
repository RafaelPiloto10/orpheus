What have I become?  
What am I running away from?  
I used to see  
Things in a very different way  
  
What am I to do?  
I have changed my point of view  
I was lost  
Now I've found myself in you  
  
From some other part of me  
I'll summon the strength to see me through  
From deep in the heart of me  
To be anything you want me to  
And that's when I start to be  
The man you've always seen in me  
The man you always wanted me to be  
  
What have we become?  
What are we running away from?  
We need to see  
Life in a very different way  
  
Learning what to do  
After all that we've been through  
No longer lost  
We have found ourselves anew  
  
From some other part of me  
I'll summon the strength to see me through  
From deep in the heart of me  
To be anything you want me to  
And that's when I start to be  
The man you've always seen in me  
The man you always wanted me to be  
  
Ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah  
  
The man you always wanted me to be  
The man you always wanted me to be  
  
Ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah
