What I must do to hold you in my hands  
Is give you all I have and be right here with you  
  
Something happened on the way  
Something I don't want to lose  
Stared my heart right in the face  
Telling me the truth, telling me it to you  
  
What I must do to hold you in my hands  
Is be right here with you  
I know that I need to give you all I am  
And this time we make it stand, stand right here with you  
  
Of all the things I wanted most  
Here you are, the one I need  
Now for all the times, I did not know  
So let my love go free, now I speak  
  
What I must do to hold you in my hands  
Is be right here with you  
I know that I, I need to give you all I am  
And this time make it stand, stand right here with you  
  
You are the sun, you are the rain  
You are the one I'd love again  
And I won't ever stop this chance to be with you  
No, I won't ever stop, I know what I must do  
There's one thing I must do  
  
What I must do to hold you in my hands  
Is give you all I am and be right here with you  
I know that I, I need to, I need to give this all I can  
And this time make it stand, stand right here with you  
  
I'm gonna do that  
I know what I must do  
I know what I must do  
You are the sun, you are the rain  
You are the one, I must do  
  
Cause you are my life, you are my love  
I know what I must do  
And this I must do for you, I must do that  
Said, I'ma gonna do that, baby  
I'm gonna stand right here with you
