Amazing how we all want this life a little more everyday.  
It's crazy how we pick ourselves up just to let us down anyway.  
The one thing that you're missing is loungin' on the log right next to you.  
So pick up that precious something and relax for a delicate few.

The one thing that you're missing is loungin' on the log right next to you.  
So pick up that precious something and relax for a delicate few.  
  
It's crazy how we all need this time a little more every way.  
It's wild how we stay up nights losing part of the day.  
The one time that you're loathing is there for you oh so well.  
So pick up that precious someone relax for a delicate spell.  
  
Rising up early the sun barely before me I could have sworn I just went to
bed.  
I smell the blizzard in the air, Winter's bitter love affair.  
I grab my coat, my hat, my jacks...I put my hat on my head and I was off again
as she said,  
Rising up early the sun barely before me, I could have sworn I just laid my
head to bed about an  
hour ago.  
  
Blizzard in the air, Winter's bitter love affair,  
I grab my coat again, hat on my head, lit my jack and I was off again she
said,  
Rising up early that sun rose barely before me, I could have sworn I just laid
my head to bed.  
I've got to, but it was so cold, I've got trouble keeping hold of my lady
sleeping next to me.  
  
But I swear today, I'm gonna go off in a delicate way and I'll have so much
fun I swear.  
No matter what goes wrong, I'll be moving on,  
I promise you, jack in my mouth, hat on my head, and I was off again she said,  
Relax for a delicate few.  
  
Just me and you.  
I swear to you true, I do.  
Relax for a delicate few.
