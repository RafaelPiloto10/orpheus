They wait to plead their case, unknown cast aside.  
I love to see their face, can we spare the light?  
Are we afraid to see the prisoners of history?  
These beautiful minds, trapped inside.  
Bring them back to life.  
  
Let 'em shine.  
Let 'em shine on.  
Let 'em shine.  
Let 'em shine on.  
  
So dark, but I see sparks, if we don't snuff them out.  
We gotta light them flame, let them speak their name.  
Let them reach up to the clouds.  
Can't eat if we don't feed them.  
Can't read if we don't teach them.  
There's no line if we just hide them.  
Don't just let 'em die.  
  
Let 'em shine.  
Let 'em shine on.  
Let 'em shine.  
Let 'em shine on.  
Let 'em shine.  
Let 'em shine on.  
  
Oh stars flicker in the distance, lonely out in space.  
They sing out when we're not listening, because we don't see their face.  
We can let them die, we can make them high.  
Hold the little miracles that live inside.  
Let 'em shine.  
  
Let 'em shine.  
Let 'em shine on.  
Let 'em live.  
Let 'em shine on.  
Let 'em read on.  
Let 'em shine on.  
Let 'em grow.  
Let 'em shine on.  
Come on, let them love.  
Come on, let them love.  
Come on, let them love.  
Yeah.  
Yeah (let them love)  
  
Hold them close, let them know they'll get through the night  
Ordinary people could be a hero, don't blow out the light.  
Let 'em shine.  
Let 'em shine on.  
Let 'em shine.  
Let 'em shine on.  
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
Let them shine on.
