Oh, a storm is threatening  
My very life today  
If I don't get some shelter  
Oh yeah, I'm gonna fade away  
War, children, it's just a shot away  
It's just a shot away  
War, children, it's just a shot away  
It's just a shot away  
Oh, see the fire sweepin'  
Our very street today  
Burns like a red coal carpet  
Mad bull lost its way  
War, children, it's just a shot away  
It's just a shot away  
War, children, it's just a shot away  
It's just a shot away  
Rape, murder, it's just a shot away  
It's just a shot away  
Rape, murder, it's just a shot away  
It's just a shot away  
Rape, murder, it's just a shot away  
It's just a shot away, shot away  
Oh the floods are threatening  
My very life today  
Come on gimme shelter  
Else I'm gonna fade away  
War, children, it's just a shot away  
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away  
It's just a shot away, it's just a shot away, it's just a shot away  
Tell me you love, sister, it's just a kiss away  
It's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away  
It's just a kiss away, it's just a kiss away  
Kiss away, kiss away  
Love, it's just a kiss away  
Just a kiss away  
Love, oh love  
Love, love, love  
Love
