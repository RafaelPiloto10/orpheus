When the time is right  
I will come back for you  
To hold you through the night  
Just like I always do  
  
Oh Jane, take me to your room again  
Why can't we learn how to love and let go  
One more time  
  
Oh Jane, hold me in your ams again  
Don't you feel the heat of the night deep inside,  
Oh Jane  
  
When the time is right  
And you reach out for me  
I'll run back to your side  
Just where I used to be, Oh Jane  
  
You can take the pain away  
Say we'll be together once more  
Please open the door, Oh Jane  
  
Oh Jane, hold me in your ams again  
Will we ever learn how to love  
Learn how to love and let go  
  
When the time is right  
I will come back for you  
With arms to hold you tight  
Just like I always do  
  
Oh Jane, take me to your room again  
Because I believe the heat of the night is still burning bright  
Deep inside  
  
Oh Jane, hold me in your ams again  
Tell me if you want me to go  
I'll leave you alone, Oh Jane.  
  
Oh Jane, take me to your room again  
Can't you feel the heat of the night is still burning bright  
Deep inside  
  
Oh Jane, hold me in your ams again  
Why can't we learn how to love,  
Learn how to love and let go.
