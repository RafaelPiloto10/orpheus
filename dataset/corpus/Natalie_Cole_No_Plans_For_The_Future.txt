Let the dishes wait, no need in dusting  
No reason to clean the dirty floor  
'Cause I'm sure it doesn't matter  
Now that he has gone away  
I have no plans for the future 'cause he's not here today  
Let them go to the park and I'll sit alone here in the dark  
No joy left in my heart anymore  
Let me hold on to my memories  
And if I die this way just let it be  
I have no plans for the future 'cause he's not here with me  
Why should I comb my head  
When I know, I'm not going anywhere?  
Why should I keep right on giving  
When I've lost my only reason for living?  
So go on, just go on and have yourself a ball  
I have no plans for the future 'cause he's not here  
I have no plans for the future 'cause he's not here at all
