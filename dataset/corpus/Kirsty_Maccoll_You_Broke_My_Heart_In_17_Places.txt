I cried, when you left me I nearly died  
You had just been along for the ride  
But now the show is over  
I'm glad 'cause you always made me so sad  
I thought I was going to go mad  
When you just ran for cover  
Now I'm going away to be on my own  
And I will forget all the things that you've done  
'cause you broke my heart in 17 places  
Shepherds bush was only one  
  
You say you won't walk out on me anymore  
But I remember you said that before  
And you won't get a chance now  
We're through  
So there's one thing I've gotta do  
I'm gonna go out with somebody new  
And find some true romance now  
So don't expect me to be hanging around  
When you get fed up with the other girls in town  
'cause you broke my heart in 17 places  
Shepherds bush was only one  
  
There's no point in us making any more dates  
Why don't you play football with some of your mates?  
If I stay in london I'll just want to cry  
So I'm leaving baby, this is my final goodbye  
(this is my final goodbye)  
  
Now I'm going away to be on my own  
And I will forget all the things that you've done  
'cause you broke my heart in 17 places  
Shepherds bush was only one  
You broke my heart in 17 places  
Shepherds bush was only one (only one)  
Only one (only one), only one (only one),  
Only one.
