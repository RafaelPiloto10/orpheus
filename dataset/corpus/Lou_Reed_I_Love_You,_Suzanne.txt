You broke my heart and you made me cry  
You said that I couldn't dance  
But now I'm back to let you know  
That I can really make romance  
You do what you gotta do  
You do everything you can  
You do what you want to do  
Hey, but I love you, Suzanne  
You do anything once  
You try anything twice  
You so what you gotta do  
Hey, but I love you, Suzanne, hey, hey  
Do what you want to do  
You do what you can  
You do what you want to do  
But I love you, Suzanne  
I love you when you're good  
Baby, I love you when you're bad  
You do what you gotta do  
Hey, but I love you, Suzanne  
Do what you want to do  
Hey, baby, do what you can  
You do what you want to do, baby  
But I love you, Suzanne  
I know you, try anything once, baby  
You try anything twice  
Do what you gotta do  
But I love you, Suzanne  
I love you when you're good, baby  
I love you when you're bad  
Do what you want to do  
Ooohhh, but I love you, Suzanne, hey, hey  
Hey, I love you, Suzanne  
I love you, Suzanne  
I love you, Suzanne  
Oh, sweet  
Do what you want to do  
Hey, you do what you can  
You do what you want to do  
Hey, but I love you, Suzanne  
You try anything once  
You do anything twice  
Do what you want to do  
You know that I love you, Suzanne
