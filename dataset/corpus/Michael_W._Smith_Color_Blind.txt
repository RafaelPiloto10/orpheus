There's not a world of difference  
Out in the world tonight  
Between this world of people  
Red, Yellow, Black and White  
But instead of riding a rainbow of love  
We still are fighting with prejudice gloves  
Of anger  
With something to claim  
But nothing to gain so  
  
[Chorus]  
Why can't we be color blind  
You know we should  
Be living together  
And we'd find a reason and rhyme  
I know we would  
Cause we could see better  
If we could be color blind  
  
Somebody's just assuming  
He's up to nothing good  
Cause he's not like the others  
There goes the neighborhood  
What kind of world are we living in  
When we judge a man by the tone of his skin  
It's crazy  
Cause he has a heart  
Like you have a heart and  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It'd be so fine  
To be color blind  
To open our eyes  
And see color blind  
  
I know this world would be a better place  
The only race would be the human race  
All of those barriers would be erased  
Why can't we be color blind  
  
[Chorus]
