It's so sweet  
In my daydreams  
  
Every night you creep into my dreams  
Fantasy  
It's so deep but it's a fantasy  
Every night you creep into my dream  
  
It's so real  
(In my daydreams)  
It's just a sweet  
It's just a sweet  
  
(In my daydreams)  
It seems so real  
You touch me  
You come into my room  
  
Come to me  
It's just a fantasy  
It feels so sweet  
But it's just not real  
Oh baby, it's just a sweet fantasy  
  
And daydream is all that I can do  
I feel raptured over you  
In silence, I keep it to myself  
Come take me  
I don't want nobody else  
  
And it's sweet  
I feel sweet  
And it's sweet  
I feel sweet  
And it's sweet  
I feel sweet  
  
And it's deep  
I feel really deep  
It's just a sweet  
It's just a sweet  
  
You're like the kiss of life  
You're like the kiss of life  
Beaming in the sky  
  
Oh you're just a fantasy  
Oh baby, you come into my room  
Yeah, but you're just a fantasy
