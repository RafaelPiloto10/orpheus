Ambush on her body, down by the dam  
She wasn't afraid of anybody until, down by the dam  
  
Criminal running from the law,  
Hiding in the high grass  
The lady saw death from a mescaline high  
High in the high grass  
And the police ain't never around  
When you need them,  
But the criminal's ready to pounce  
If you get near him  
  
Vigilante fires, the flames are gettin' higher  
Down by the dam  
Temper's gettin' hot oh there's blood for the pot,  
Down by the dam
