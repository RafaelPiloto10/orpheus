[Verse 1]  
Baby you smell good  
Cause they warned me bout your type girl  
I've been ducking left and right  
Baby you're no good  
Think I fell for you, I fell for you, I fell for you  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
You got me puttin' time in, time in  
Nobody got me feeling this way  
You probably think I'm lying, lying  
I'm used to bitches comin' right 'way  
  
[Chorus]  
You got me touchin' on your body  
You got me touchin' on your body  
To say that we're in love is dangerous  
But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted  
I get you touchin' on your body  
I get you touchin' on your body  
I know I'd rather be complacent  
But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted  
  
[Verse 2]  
Baby you're no good  
All my niggas think I'm crazy cause I'm thinkin' 'bout us lately  
But really if I could  
I'd forget about you, 'get about you, 'get about you  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
You got me puttin' time in, time in  
Nobody got me feeling this way  
You probably think I'm lying, lying  
I'm used to bitches comin' right 'way  
  
[Chorus]  
You got me touchin' on your body  
You got me touchin' on your body  
To say that we're in love is dangerous  
But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted  
I got you touchin' on your body  
I got you touchin' on your body  
I know I'd rather be complacent  
But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted, we're acquainted  
  
[Verse 3]  
Momma called me cryin', cryin', cryin', cryin'  
I won't find somebody that's real (she wants somebody that's real)  
Cause every time I try to, try to, try to run  
The fast life keeps gaining on me, shit  
But ever since I met you  
I couldn't believe what you did  
So comfort me babe, ain't no rush from me babe  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll keep on touchin' on your body  
I'll keep on touchin' on your body  
To say that we're in love is dangerous  
But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted  
I got you touchin' on your body  
I got you touchin' on your body  
I know I'd rather be complacent  
But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted, we're acquainted  
  
[Outro]  
I'm not trying to talk at all  
Cause I'm trying to love you crazy  
Put some more inside your cup  
And drink till you numb the pain  
I got you touchin' on your body  
These girls keep touchin' on their body  
They got accustomed to the life we live  
These girls born in the '90s are dangerous  
I got 'em thinkin' that they want me  
Although they know they not the only  
I got 'em wanting to embrace their sins  
These girls born in the '90s are dangerous
