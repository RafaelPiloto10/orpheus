  
I'm a one boy, one boy girl  
You know I'm a one boy girl  
  
1:  
Some girls, say in their world  
They couldn't bear to have just him  
But I, don't need a load of guys  
To pump up my self esteem  
  
Girl what you doin' with just one guy  
Given' all my lovin'  
What you gonna do when  
There's lipstick on his collar  
You're gonna get old before your time  
You can't tell me nothing,  
'bout this man of mine  
  
CHORUS:  
No other love could ever  
Compare to my lover  
I'm a one boy, one boy girl  
No other touch could mean half as much  
As my lover  
You know I'm a one boy girl  
  
2:  
Check it out  
  
Some guys never realise  
What a girl needs from a man  
But my guy always satisfies  
It's a love we understand  
  
Don't you want to go out and play  
I'm sorry but I'm busy  
What if you call and there isn't any answer  
You're gonna find him gone one day  
He'll always be with me no matter what you say  
  
CHORUS:  
  
No other kiss is the one that I miss  
With my lover  
I'm a one boy, one boy girl  
No other man could love like he can  
As my lover  
You know I'm a one boy girl  
  
RAP:  
Hey you kylie...mmm hmmm  
What's up with this one-boy-girl thing...well  
Let me break it down like this, yeah right  
It doesn't play to stay or be good  
You know how guys are, I don't think he good  
Be with just one, and what if he cheats ya  
Girl just have fun go out and meet ya  
Two or three more.. I don't think so  
You should see more..no I don't think so  
How could you be sure..I believe him  
You're in for heartbeat you don't need him  
What if he hurts you..he won't do that  
Are you sure...yeah that's a fact  
There's lots of guys in this world  
Not for me, I'm a one-boy-girl  
  
No other love (no other love)  
My lover, ohh  
One boy, one boy girl  
No other touch (no other touch)  
My lover, ohh  
One boy, one boy girl, yeah  
  
CHORUS
