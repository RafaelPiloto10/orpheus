You caught my eye and I'm tryin' to holler at 'cha  
You walk on by and I trip on the furniture

You got to own it own it  
To the beat of your own drum  
And you got it like that  
Burn it up like that  
To the beat of your own drum

It's like wow, I'm not backin' down  
My hearts pumpin' and it's workin' over time
