I know I stand in line until you think you have the time  
To spend an evening with me  
And if we go someplace place to dance I know that there's a chance  
You won't be leaving with me  
And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place  
And have a drink or two  
And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid like "I love you"  
  
I can see it in your eyes, that you despise the same old lies  
You heard the night before  
And though it's just a line to you, to me it's true  
It never seemed so right before  
  
I practice every day to find some clever lines to say  
To make the meaning come through  
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late  
And I'm alone with you  
  
The time is right your perfume fills my head, the stars get red  
And oh the night's so blue  
And then I go and spoil it all, by saying something stupid  
Like: "I love you"  
"I love you"  
"I love you"  
  
I've booked a small table down the road ...  
I wonder if we could maybe go there and have something to eat?  
  
No
