You're not the right one dumb damn rapper  
Not the right goddamn  
Who are you to rap shit take off  
And who says you're right  
On top you think you're bomb artista  
But you're bent out of oh right  
Suck my dick  
But don't you think that you're oh right  
Sometimes things might make me oh oh it makes me mad  
And when it happens fuck it  
Rugged in mind a hint by bite  
Why does it not exist in you?  
Right, shit, why hit in yet another day  
Woo ho right  
It's not woo ho right  
But you're wrong  
  
Twist Twist Twist Twist  
  
Put me in right now make mad  
Prove that you're right  
Somehow you're not right, huh  
But that doesn't make me mad  
Right now you're beggin' for a little brew  
All night  
Yeah it's so simple  
I had some Red Dog, you hand over it  
  
Twist Twist Twist
