Bar illuminations shiver  
Shadows on the street  
The Cypriot sailors  
Find the world back at their feet  
Endless days of tobacco nights by the radio  
I wonder if they'll ever go to heaven  
The beer mats are wading  
In a table of froth  
The bar girl is serving  
With a check drying cloth  
She'll bend over backwards even though she's knackered  
I wonder if there'll have her up in heaven  
  
Like the sailors I walk home, it's six a.m.  
Heaven's round the corner in a comfortable bed  
And I love her.  
  
The officers and seamen  
Elbow places at the bar  
Words that tempt the goddess  
Don't leave beats upon the heart  
But she'll service his pleasure  
And never know the treasure  
That his wife keeps forever up in heaven  
  
The first light of the morning  
Proves too much for the street  
No one sees each other  
Just their presence there to meet  
Your chin takes to stubble at the sight of a funnel  
And the gangplank is no trouble up to heaven
