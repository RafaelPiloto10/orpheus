If I have to cry, if I have to kill  
If I have to die, oh baby I will  
As long you stay, baby by my side  
If I have to beg, if I have to steal  
If I have to swim, through oceans, I will  
As long you stay, baby by my side  
I miss you forever, forever my love  
  
Oh baby, why does it always rain in my heart  
My sweet baby?  
Oh my lady, I can't live without you, oh no  
Oh baby, why does it always rain in my heart  
Tell me baby  
Oh my lady, I'm lonely and I'm blue  
  
If I have to climb, on the greatest hill  
If I have to fall, oh baby I will  
As long you stay, baby by my side  
If I have to lose, everything just for you  
If I have to fight, oh baby I'll do  
As long you stay, baby by my side  
I love you forever, forever my love
