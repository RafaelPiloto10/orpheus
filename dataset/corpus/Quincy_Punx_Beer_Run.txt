  
Ya get to the party and yell out,  
"Who's got the cups?"  
You're on a mission,  
A mission to get fucked up.  
Ya baby-sit the keg until  
It's spittin' out just foam.  
Yer just gettin' buzzed so  
There's no talk of goin' home  
Beer run! Beer run!  
The keg is fried, let's get  
Another one.  
Beer run! Beer run!  
It's way too early to end the fun.  
Beer run! Beer run!  
The kegs have run dry but we've  
Got money form the door.  
We got empties for deposit so we  
Can get a couple more.  
We've only got ten minutes  
To make it to the liquor store  
Get yer ass in gear or this night'll  
Be a fuckin' bore.  
Beer run! Beer run!  
The keg is fried, let's get  
Another one.  
Beer run! Beer run!  
It's way too early to end the fun.  
Beer run! Beer run!  
Hurry up and name yer poison  
I want another beer bong  
Any ball-tap keg'll do  
Fuck that leaky two-prong  
All of 'em have alcohol  
So just grab the cheapest one.  
Let's get back to the party and  
Roll out that barrel of fun!  
Beer run! Beer run!  
The keg is fried, let's get  
Another one.  
Beer run! Beer run!  
It's way too early to end the fun.  
Beer run! Beer run!  
You're on a mission,  
A mission to get fucked up.  
Head to the store,  
To get some more.  
Have no fear,  
There'll be more beer.  
The taps will flow  
We'll do some blow  
'cause we're not done,  
Can't end the fun.  
BEER RUN!!!
