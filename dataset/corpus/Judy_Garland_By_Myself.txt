I'll go, I'll go, I'll go my way by myself  
This is the end of romance  
I'll go my way by myself, love is only a dance  
  
I'll try to apply myself and teach my heart how to sing  
I'll go my way by myself like a bird on the wing  
I'll face the unknown, I'll build a world of my own  
No one knows better than I myself, I'm by myself alone  
  
I'm sure that love's an overrated past time  
It's the last time I'll ever be anything but fancy free  
For love is just a junior high version, one way excursion  
I'm sure that I am old enough to fly alone  
  
And I'll face the unknown, I'll build a world of my own  
No one knows better than I myself  
I'm by myself alone, I'll go, I'll go by myself alone
