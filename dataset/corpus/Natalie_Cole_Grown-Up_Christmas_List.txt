Do you remember me  
I sat upon your knee  
I wrote to you  
With childhood fantasies  
Well, I'm all grown up now  
Can you still help somehow  
  
I'm not a child  
But my heart still can dream  
So here's my lifelong wish  
My grown-up Christmas list  
Not for myself  
But for a world in need  
  
No more lives torn apart  
That wars would never start  
And time would heal all hearts  
Every man would have a friend  
  
That right would always win  
And love would never end  
This is my grown-up  
Christmas list  
What is this illusion called  
  
The innocence of youth  
Maybe only in their blind belief  
Can we ever find the truth  
There'd be no more lives torn apart  
And wars would never start  
  
And time would heal all hearts  
Every man would have a friend  
And right would always win  
And love would never end  
  
This is my grown-up Christmas list  
This is my only lifelong wish  
This is my grown-up Christmas list
