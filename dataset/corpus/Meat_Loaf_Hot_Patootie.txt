What ever happened to Saturday night?  
When you dressed up sharp and you felt alright  
It don't seem the same since cosmic light  
Came into my life, I thought I was divine  
I used to go for a ride with a chick who'd go  
And listen to the music on the radio  
A saxophone was blowing on a Rock and Roll show  
We climbed in the back seat, really had a good time  
  
Hot patootie, bless my soul  
Really love that Rock and Roll  
Hot patootie, bless my soul  
I really love that Rock and Roll  
Hot patootie, bless my soul  
I really love that Rock and Roll  
Hot patootie, bless my soul  
I really love that Rock and Roll  
  
(Saxophone solo)  
  
My head used to swim from the perfume I smelled  
My hands kinda fumbled with her white plastic belt  
I'd taste her baby pink lipstick and that's when I'd melt  
She'd whisper in my ear tonight she really was mine  
Get back in front and put some hair oil on  
Buddy Holly was singing his very last song  
With your arms around your girl, you try to sing along  
It felt pretty good, woo!  
Really had a good time  
  
Hot patootie, bless my soul  
Really love that Rock and Roll  
Hot patootie, bless my soul  
I really love that Rock and Roll  
Hot patootie, bless my soul  
I really love that Rock and Roll  
Hot patootie, bless my soul  
I really love that Rock and Roll  
  
(Saxophone solo)  
  
Hot patootie, bless my soul  
I really love that Rock and Roll  
Hot patootie, bless my soul  
I really love that Rock and Roll  
Hot patootie, bless my soul  
I really love that Rock and Roll  
Hot patootie, bless my soul  
I really love that Rock and Roll  
Hot patootie, bless my soul  
I really love that Rock and Roll  
Hot patootie, bless my soul  
I really love that Rock and Roll  
Hot patootie, bless my soul  
I really love that Rock and Roll  
Hot patootie, bless my soul  
I really love that Rock and Roll
