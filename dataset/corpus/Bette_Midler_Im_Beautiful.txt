"That's it, baby! When you got it, flaunt it, flaunt it!"  
  
"This is the Divine Miss M and I'm here to share with you some rare and
stimulating insight into my cosmic fabulosity. It's really very simple. I
smiply believe with all my heart:"  
  
I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, dammit!  
I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, dammit!  
I'm beautiful, so beautiful, I'm beautiful, dammit!  
I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, dammit!  
  
"Go away, little girl," they used to say.  
"Hey, you're too fat, baby, you can't play."  
"Hold on, miss thing, what you trying to do?  
You know you're too wack to be in our school."  
  
Too wack, too smart, too fast, too fine,  
Too loud, too tough, too too divine.  
I said you don't belong. You don't belong.  
Too loud, too big, too much to bear,  
Too bold, too brash, too prone to swear.  
I heard that song for much too long.  
  
Ain't this my sun? Ain't this my moon?  
Ain't this my world to be who I choose?  
Ain't this my song? Ain't this my movie?  
Ain't this my world? I know I can do it.  
  
I'm not too short, I'm not too tall,  
I'm not too big, I'm not too small.  
Ooh, don't lemme start lovin' myself!  
Ooh, don't lemme start lovin' myself!  
I'm not too white, I'm not too black,  
I'm not too this, I'm not too that.  
Ooh, don't lemme start lovin' myself!  
Ooh, don't lemme start lovin' myself!  
  
I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, dammit!  
I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, dammit!  
  
It's time to call it what it is. Don't play the naming game.  
Become what you were born to be and be it unashamed.  
"Go away, little boy," I can hear them say,  
"Everybody on the block says they think you're gay.  
Hold on, my friend, do you think we're blind?  
Take a look at yourself. You're not our kind."  
  
Too black, too white, too short, too tall,  
Too blue, too green, too red, too small.  
I said you don't belong. You don't belong.  
Too black, too white, too short, too tall,  
Too blue, too green, too red, too small.  
I heard that song for much to long.  
  
Ain't this my sun? Ain't this my moon?  
Ain't this my world to be who I choose?  
Ain't this my song? Ain't this my movie?  
Ain't this my world? I know I can do it.  
  
People always ask me,  
"Miss M, how did you get so far  
On so little?" Shut up!  
Well, I woke up one morning,  
Flossed my teeth and decided,  
"Damn, I'm fierce!" You look good!  
You can be just like me! A goddess? Yeah!  
Don't just pussy foot around and sit on your assets.  
Unleash your ferocity upon an unsuspecting world.  
Rise up and repeat after me: "I'm beautiful!"  
  
I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful!  
Can you say that?  
I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful!  
I don't hear you!  
I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful!  
Louder!  
I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful!  
Hey!  
  
That's it, baby, when you got it, flaunt it, flaunt it!  
  
Aaaaaah!  
Ain't this my sun? My sun! Ain't this my moon? My moon!  
Ain't this my world to be who I choose?  
Ain't this our song? Ain't this our song?  
Ain't this our movie? Ain't this our movie?  
Ain't this our world to be who we choose?  
  
I'm not too short, I'm not too tall,  
I'm not too big, I'm not too small.  
Ooh, don't lemme start lovin' myself!  
Ooh, don't lemme start lovin' myself!  
I'm not too white, I'm not too black,  
I'm not too this, I'm not too that.  
Ooh, don't lemme start lovin' myself!  
Ooh, don't lemme start lovin' myself!  
I'm beautiful, dammit!
