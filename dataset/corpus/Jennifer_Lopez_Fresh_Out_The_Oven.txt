[Jennifer Lopez sings]  
Break it off here  
Break-break it off there  
  
Now bounce your knees back  
Alternate back and forward  
And if you doing it right  
Your hips will be doing the same thing  
  
[Jenifer Lopez]  
Now don't tell me that you love me  
Get with this  
You say you stayed forever  
But it don't make sense  
Maybe I'm...  
Hope you don't miss  
  
Cuz if not you ain't gonna get none of this  
I only wanna hear swish  
Imma big girl and I know what it is  
Pick me up at 8 yeah don't you wish  
  
[Chorus]  
Love, fresh out the oven  
Straight sugar lovin  
To the beat a lovin  
Hey  
  
X3  
You wanna  
Break it off here  
Break-break it off there  
  
Be real you can say who you are  
Everybody say that you doctor at the bar  
  
You gotta look close to find the real superstart  
You won a national...  
Open up a jar  
  
Help yourself and take a look in the mirror  
Open up your mouth and stick your tongue down far  
Just a little more... okay say ahh.  
  
[Chorus]  
Love, fresh out the oven  
Straight sugar lovin  
To the beat a lovin  
Hey  
  
X3  
You wanna  
Break it off here  
Break-break it off there

Let's not mess around  
We both know what we need  
Now here is what I want  
Understand me what I say  
Make it less kay  
You say you want the cookie (yeah)  
You've gonna wait for the cookie  
No touchy touchy only looky looky  
  
[Pitbull]  
Mommy you S E X Y  
Lips ass, lips snazz

[Chorus]  
Love, fresh out the oven  
Straight sugar lovin  
To the beat a lovin  
Hey

You wanna  
Break it off here  
Break-break it off there
