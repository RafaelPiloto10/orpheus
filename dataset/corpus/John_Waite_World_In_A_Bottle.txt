Give your love away  
It's not the way you seem  
'Cause someone's just come in your life  
And broken up your dreams  
  
Look into my eyes and tell me what you see  
And if my eyes are empty  
Well that's the way I'm meant to be  
What I got  
  
Who am I  
I got the world in a bottle  
Oh oh  
Whatever I once was  
  
Is fading fast away  
My soul is like a shadow  
Growing fainter in the day  
I've never loved you more  
  
But you feel so out of reach  
My life is like a sun  
Sinking slowly in the beach  
What I got  
  
Who am I  
I got the world in a bottle  
Oh oh  
Come here  
  
I want you  
What I got  
Who am I  
I got the world in a bottle  
  
What I got  
Who am I  
I got the world in a bottle  
So give your love away  
  
It's not the way you seem  
Cause someone's just come in your life  
And broken up your dreams  
Look into my eyes and tell me what you see  
  
And if my eyes are empty  
Well that's the way I'm meant to be  
What I got  
Who am I  
  
I got the world in a bottle  
What I got  
Somebody  
Who am I  
  
I got the world in a bottle
