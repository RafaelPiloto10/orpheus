Well, I'm struttin' up and down  
Tryin' to get my face in town  
Wonderin' the hang where  
To turn each time around  
  
Look in your mirror just to see my face  
Two way time, baby, it's no disgrace  
Oh my, how the times have changed  
Oh my, how the times have changed  
  
Ladies used to dancin' but I move for real  
Lookin' for reaction, something you can feel  
When ya dance,  
I move and they look me in the eye  
Two way time, baby, it's no lie  
  
[Repeat: x 3]  
Oh my, how the times have changed  
Oh my, how the times have changed
