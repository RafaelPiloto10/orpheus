I've known about you for a while now  
When he leaves me he wears a smile  
Now as soon as he's away from me  
In your arms is where he wants to be  
  
Kelly:  
But you're the one he rushes home to  
Youre the one he gave his name to  
I've never seen his face in the early morning light  
You have his mornings his daytimes  
And sometimes I have his nights  
  
Both:  
But does he love you (does he love you)  
Like he loves me (like he loves me)  
Does he think of you (does he think of you)  
When he's holding me  
Does he whisper all of his fantasies  
Does he love you (does he love you)  
Like he's been loving me  
  
Kelly:  
But when he's with me  
He says he needs me  
And that he wants me  
That he believes in me  
  
Reba:  
And when I'm in his arms  
How he swears there's no one else  
Is he deceiving me  
Or am I deceiving myself  
  
Both:  
Does he love you (does he love you)  
Like he loves me(like he loves me)  
Does he think of you (does he think of you)  
When he's holding me  
And does he whisper all of his fantasies  
Does he love you (does he love you)  
Like he's been loving me  
  
Oooh shouldn't I loose my temper  
Oooh shouldn't I be ashamed  
'cause I have everything to loose  
I have nothing to gain  
  
Does he love you (does he love you)  
Like he loves me (like he loves me)  
Does he think of you (does he think of you)  
Whens he's holding me  
Does he whisper you all of his fantasies  
Does he love you (does he love you)  
Like he's been loving me  
  
Ooooh  
Does he love you?
