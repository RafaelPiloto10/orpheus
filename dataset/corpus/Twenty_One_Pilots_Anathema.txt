You will never know what's behind my skull,  
So won't you say goodnight so I can say goodbye.  
  
You will never know what's under my hair,  
So won't you say goodnight so I can say goodbye.  
  
You will never know what's under my skin,  
So won't you say goodnight so I can say goodbye.  
  
You will never know what is in my veins,  
So won't you say goodnight so I can say goodbye.  
  
Won't you go to someone else's dreams?  
Won't you go to someone else's head?  
Haven't you taken enough from me?  
Won't you torture someone else's sleep?  
  
And you will never know what I'm thinking of,  
So won't you say goodnight so I can say goodbye  
  
And you will never understand what I believe,  
So won't you say goodnight so I can say goodbye.  
  
Haven't you taken enough from me?  
Won't you torture someone else's sleep?  
Won't you go to someone else's dreams?  
Won't you go to someone else's head?  
Haven't you taken enough from me?  
Won't you torture someone else's sleep?  
  
I start to part two halves of my heart in the dark and I  
Don't know where I should go,  
And the tears and the fears begin to multiply.  
  
Taking time in a simple place,  
In my bed, where my head rests on a pillowcase  
And it's said that a war's lead but I forget  
That I let another day go by.  
  
I want to be afraid but it seems that these days  
I'm caught under water and I'm falling farther  
My heart's getting harder, I'm calling my Father  
Am I screaming to an empty sky?  
  
Empty sky, no way, that's me 'cause one half of my heart is free.  
Empty sky, no way, that's me 'cause the other half of my heart's asleep.
