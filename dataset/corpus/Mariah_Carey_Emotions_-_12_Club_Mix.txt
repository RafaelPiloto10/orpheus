You've got me feelin' emotions higher, higher  
I feel good, I feel nice  
I feel good, satisfied  
You've got me feelin' emotions  
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of  
You've got me feelin' emotions  
Higher than the heavens above  
I feel good, I feel nice  
I've never felt so satisfied  
I'm in love, I'm alive  
Intoxicated, flyin' high  
Feels like a dream  
When you touch me tenderly  
I don't know if it's real  
But I like the way I feel inside  
You've got me feelin' emotions  
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of  
You've got me feelin' emotions  
Higher than the heavens above  
In the morning, when I rise  
You are the first thing on my mind  
And in the middle of the night  
I feel your heartbeat next to mine  
It feels like a dream  
When you love me tenderly  
I don't know if you're for real  
But I like the way I feel inside  
You've got me feelin' emotions  
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of  
You've got me feelin' emotions  
Higher than the heavens above  
You've got me feelin' emotions  
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of  
You've got me feelin' emotions  
Higher than the heavens above  
You know the way  
To make me lose control  
When you're lookin' into my eyes  
You make me feel so high, oh baby  
Alright  
You've got me feelin' emotions  
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of  
You've got me feelin' emotions  
Higher than the heavens above  
You've got me feelin' emotions, yes you do  
Oh yeah, you've got me feelin' emotions  
Emotions, deeper than I've ever dreamed of  
Emotions, emotions  
You've got me feelin' higher
