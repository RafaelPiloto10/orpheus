Lead me to the river of love  
Pour a little water and wash my pain away  
Leave me in the ocean of joy  
Water from below I can feel your glow running through  
You know that I do I'm drowning in you  
  
Take me to the tide of your heart  
Take me to the shore, babe and hold me close to you  
Leave me when the sky's getting dark  
Water from behind I can feel a fine line from you  
You know that I do I'm drowning in you  
  
Say hello, there's no goodbye  
If you can't read between the lines  
Found a love that I can't hide oh I've been drowning in your eyes  
Honey, honey, honey yea!  
  
Lead me to the gate of your dreams  
Put me on a ship that will sail the lovers' seas  
Water from the brooks and the streams  
Water in my face I can taste the ocean of you  
You know that I do I'm drowning in you  
  
Say hello...  
  
It's the ocean of you  
You know that's it's true I'm drowning in you
