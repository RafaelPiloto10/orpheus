A lot of things occur each day  
We've got to live with on our way  
There's so much misery on the screen  
With commercials in between  
  
And the Russians won't be so late  
Uncle Sam don't want to wait  
No matter if you're black or white  
You never ever had a right  
  
And look up to the eternal skies  
See warfare even there  
What once has been a paradise  
Now destruction and despair  
  
In other worlds the children die  
Lacking food ill from a fly  
Oppressed by troops to tame their land  
It's all the same again  
  
If any man is free on earth  
Then tormentors steal his birth  
They slam gun butts in his face  
And leave his woman choked in mace  
  
So stand up for our human rights  
Push back this pest of hate  
Raise you voice pass on the light  
Unite! it's not too late  
  
[Chorus]  
How many tears flow away  
To become a sea of fears  
How many hearts are torn apart  
Till another torment starts  
  
But before the world  
Turns into a sun  
All cruelty and violence  
On earth will be dead and gone  
  
So stand up for our human rights  
Push back this pest of hate  
Raise you voice pass on the light  
Unite! it's not too late  
  
[Chorus]
