Now a country boy called shorty  
And a city boy named Dan  
Had to prove who could run the fastest  
To win miss Lucy's hand  
Now Dan had all the money  
And he also had the looks  
But shorty must have had something, boys  
That can't be found in books  
  
Well, a-cut across shorty, shorty cut across  
That's what miss Lucy said  
Cut across shorty, shorty cut across  
It's you I want to wed  
  
Now Dan had been in training  
A week before the race  
He made up his mind  
Old shorty would end in second place  
And Dan with his long legs a-flyin'  
Left shorty far behind  
And shorty heard him holler out  
Miss Lucy, you'll soon be mine  
  
But shorty wasn't worried  
There was a smile upon his face  
He knew that he was a-goin' to win  
'Cause Lucy had fixed the race  
And just like that old story  
About the turtle and the hair  
When Dan crossed over the finish line  
He found shorty waiting there
