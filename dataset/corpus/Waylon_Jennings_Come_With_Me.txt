If you're in a bind,with a troubled mind  
I'm a mountain,come on and climb  
Because you look so good,to be so down  
It won't take much girl,to turn it all around  
  
[Chorus]  
Come with me,come with me  
The feeling's free,just come with me  
Will get on a cloud girl,and ride it high  
Say hello sun,as we sail bye  
  
I'll take you where,you've never been before  
Once we're there,you'll cry for more  
If it's dark in your world,come walk in mine  
My love's a light babe,it's on all the time  
  
[Chorus: x 2]
