Well you done done me and you bet I felt it  
I tried to beat you but you're so hot that I melted  
I fell right through the cracks, now I'm trying to get back  
  
Before the cool done run out, I'll be giving it my bestest  
And nothings going to stop me but divine intervention  
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some  
  
But I won't hesitate no more, no more  
It cannot wait, I'm yours  
  
Well open up your mind and see like me  
Open up your plans and damn you're free  
Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love  
  
Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing  
We're just one big family, and  
It's our god-forsaken right to be loved, love, loved, love, loved  
  
So I won't hesitate no more, no more  
It cannot wait I'm sure  
There's no need to complicate, our time is short  
This is our fate, I'm yours  
  
D-d-do you, but you, d-d-do  
But do you want to come on  
Scooch on over closer dear  
And I will nibble your ear  
  
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror  
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer  
But my breath fogged up the glass  
And so I drew a new face and laughed  
  
I guess what I'm saying is there ain't no better reason  
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons  
It's what we aim to do, our name is our virtue  
  
But I won't hesitate no more, no more  
It cannot wait I'm yours  
  
Come on and open up your mind and see like me  
Open up your plans and damn you're free  
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours  
  
So please don't, please don't, please don't  
There's no need to complicated  
Cause our time is short  
This is, this is, this is our fate, I'm yours!
