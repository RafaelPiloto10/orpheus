Bless this house, O Lord we pray,  
Make it safe by night and day . . .  
Bless these walls so firm and stout,  
Keeping want and trouble out . . .  
Bless the roof and chimneys tall,  
Let thy peace lie overall . . .  
Bless this door that it may prove,  
Ever open,  
To joy and love . . .  
Bless these windows shining bright,  
Letting in God's Heavenly light,  
Bless the hearth, ablazing there,  
With smoke ascending like a prayer!  
Bless the people here within,  
Keep them pure and free from sin . . .  
Bless us all that we may be,  
Fit O Lord to dwell with thee . . .  
Bless us all that one day we may dwell,  
O Lord! With Thee!
