Pain!  
Buried so fly away  
Enter my life of nothing  
Sick of the same old thing, so I dig a hole, buried pain  
Sick of the same old thing, so I dig a hole, buried pain  
Hanging so high always  
Burying my life so slowly  
  
Sick of the same old thing, so I dig a hole, buried pain  
Sick of the same old thing, so I dig a hole, buried pain  
It opens my mind to feelings  
I can't face boredom without something  
  
Sick of the same old thing, so I dig a hole, buried pain  
Sick of the same old thing, so I dig a hole, buried pain  
Sick of the same old thing, so I dig a hole, buried pain  
Sick of the same old thing, so I dig a hole, buried pain  
  
Me entering my head  
Feeling like I'm God  
With the world around me  
Can't you feel this pain?  
Reaming through my heart!  
Screaming through my veins!  
Nothing I can kill!  
Screaming a Lie! Lie! Lie!  
Can't you feel this My! Eyes! Out!  
Can't you take my heart away  
Take my heart, Goodbye  
Sick of the same old thing, so I dig a hole, buried pain  
Pain! Pain! Pain! Pain! Pain!
