It's getting cold, it's getting dark, the nights are longer every day  
The air is heavy and the clouds will never burn away  
And we've been waitin' here so long that we've forgotten what it's like  
To turn into the fire, lookin' straight into the, straight into the light  
  
Your heart is tryin' to rock but it can barely beat at all  
Your soul is tryin' to run but all your body does is crawl  
You don't need any signal, you don't need any sign  
Nothin's gonna stop you once you cross over the line  
  
I want to tear it all apart and take the clothes right off your back  
We're tearin' down the highway and we're breakin' away, breakin' away  
Breakin' away, we're breakin' away from the pack  
We're breakin' away from the pack  
  
And if you don't have anywhere to go  
You go down on the pedal and you're ready to roll  
And even if you don't have anywhere to go  
You go down on the pedal and you're ready to roll  
And your speed is all you'll ever need, all you'll ever need to know  
  
[Chorus]  
You and me we're goin' nowhere slowly and we gotta get away from the past  
There's nothin' wrong with goin' nowhere baby  
But we should be goin' nowhere fast  
Everybody's goin' nowhere slowly  
They're only fighting for the chance to be last  
There's nothin' wrong with goin' nowhere baby  
But we should be goin' nowhere fast  
  
It's so much better goin' nowhere fast  
  
You shouldn't always see your world so clearly  
You shouldn't always know your place so well  
And all we're doin' here is hangin' around  
And goin' anywhere has gotta be heaven, 'cause stayin here is gonna be hell  
And goin' anywhere has gotta be heaven, 'cause stayin here has gotta be hell  
  
I'm getting lost, I'm getting found, I'm getting born again each day  
We're dyin' on the vine until we finally, 'til we finally get away  
The boundaries of this town are closin' in just like a noose  
The future's gonna rust if we don't put it to some, put it to some use  
  
Your heart is tryin' to rock but it can barely beat at all  
Your soul is tryin' to run but all your body does is crawl  
You don't need any signal, you don't need any sign  
Nothin's gonna stop you once you cross over the line  
  
[Chorus]
