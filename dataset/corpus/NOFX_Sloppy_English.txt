I play pool 'cause I'm no fool  
I play pool 'cause I'm cool  
I play pool after school  
I play pool all the time  
Cue in my left hand, beer in right  
I shout and drink all through the night  
That sloppy English does me just right  
I use that sloppy English all the time  
I hold my stick like I hold my dick  
Hustling beers from wetto that's the trick  
I use that sloppy English all the time
