My baby nothing but a ton of joy  
Children, yes she is one ton of joy  
My baby nothing but a ton of joy  
Love, love, love, love, love, lovely  
Lovely ton of joy  
  
The way she love me  
Makes me know I'm a man  
What she do for me  
You don't understand, children  
Baby, you're a ton of joy  
Lovely, lovely, lovely ton of joy  
  
She's got what all men  
Are trying to find  
Drives a strong man  
Practically out of his mind, children  
She gives a blind man eyes to see, y'all  
She knocks a preacher man  
Straight on his knees, y'all  
  
Baby, baby, you're a ton of joy  
Girl, I love, I love your ton of joy  
Children, the way she loves me  
Makes me want to learn  
You sets me on fire  
But I'm willing to burn, children, you  
Baby, you're a ton of joy  
A lovely, lovely, lovely ton of joy  
  
You love girl, I love you, baby  
No matter what you do, girl  
I'm gonna keep loving you  
No matter what you say  
You got one hundred tons of  
One hundred ton of joy, baby  
You don't weigh but a hundred  
But I just love you
