Realize you and I are in the same boat, same boat, yeah  
Kills me, how you love me, then you  
Cut me down, I'll do the same  
We been living like angels and devils, devils  
  
I'm loving the pain  
I never wanna live without it  
So why do I try  
You drive me insane  
Now we're screaming just to see who's louder  
So why do I try  
You got me like na na na na

Through it all you could still make my heart skip, heart skip  
Oh yeah

I still think you're beautiful  
Through it all you could still make my heart, skip, heart skip

So why do I try  
You drive me insane
