This is a time that we can live our dreams  
And a time so pure, at least it seems  
A simple life, a modest one  
Where money plays a minor role  
And I pray and I'll try to keep this spirit inside me  
As I start to grow old  
This is an era of creativity  
Good music and good friends  
And the dreams that we reach for  
Seem to be at the tips of our hands  
And it's getting too late to appreciate  
And it soon will be the past  
But I'll still have these memories  
But why can't they fucking last  
Maybe they can  
This is a time, this is a time we'll remember  
This is a time with lots of hope  
And very little fear  
And a time where every move we make seems so sincere  
But when the song is sung and the moment's gone  
Only you'll know all we've shared  
And I hope that you can rekindle too  
This same feeling in the air  
This is a time we can remember
