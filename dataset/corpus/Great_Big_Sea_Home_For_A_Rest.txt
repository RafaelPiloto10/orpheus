You'll have to excuse me,  
I'm not at my best  
I've been gone for a month  
I've been drunk since I left.  
These so-called vacations will  
Soon be my death  
I'm so sick from the drink  
I need home for a rest....  
We arrived in December  
And London was cold,  
We stayed in the bars  
Along Jarring cross road.  
We never saw nothing  
But brass-tops and nook.  
Kept a shine on the bar  
With the sleeves of our coats.  
You'll have to excuse me,  
I'm not at my best  
I've been gone for a week  
I've been drunk since I left.  
These so-called vacations will  
Soon be my death  
I'm so sick from the drink  
I need home for a rest....  
Take me home!  
Houston station  
The train's heading North,  
In the bucket car  
We looked back and forth.  
I stole crooked dice  
Through Yorkshire's green fields  
We were flung into dance  
As the train jigged and reeled.  
You'll have to excuse me,  
I'm not at my best  
I've been gone for a week  
I've been drunk since I left.  
These so-called vacations will  
Soon be my death  
I'm so sick from the drink  
I need home for a rest....  
Take me home!  
By the light of the moon,  
She drift through the streets,  
A rare old perfume  
So seductive and sweet  
She teases and flirts  
As the pubs all close down,  
Then walk us on home  
And deny us a round.  
You'll have to excuse me,  
I'm not at my best  
I've been gone for a month  
I've been drunk since I left.  
These so-called vacations will  
Soon be my death  
I'm so sick from the drink  
I need home for a rest....  
Take me home!  
The gas heat is empty  
It's damn past two  
The spirits we drank  
Left ghosts in the room  
I'm asking again  
Come on, please take me soon,  
And don't lift my head  
Til the twelve bells at noon!  
You'll have to excuse me,  
I'm not at my best  
I've been gone for a week  
I've been drunk since I left.  
These so-called vacations will  
Soon be my death  
I'm so sick from the drink  
I need home for a rest....  
Take me home!
