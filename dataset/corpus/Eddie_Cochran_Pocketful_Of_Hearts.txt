A pocketful of hearts, a-baby you collect 'em  
A pocketful of hearts, and then you go and wreck 'em  
A pocketful of hearts, 'cause you just neglect 'em  
For a love that's new  
A pocketful of hearts, crazy how you get 'em  
A pocketful of hearts, a-love 'em and forget 'em  
A pocketful of hearts, a-baby you condemn 'em  
One more fool, me too  
Play with fire and you'll get burned  
The story's always true  
You never dreamed a heart like yours  
Could ever be so blue  
A pocketful of hearts, one is gonna haunt you  
A pocketful of hearts, one is gonna taunt you  
A pocketful of hearts, when he doesn't want you  
You'll be cryin' too
