I am a passenger  
And I ride and I ride  
I ride through the city's backside  
I see the stars come out of the sky  
Yeah, they're bright in a hollow sky  
You know it looks so good tonight  
  
I am a passenger  
I stay under glass  
I look through my window so bright  
I see the stars come out tonight  
I see the bright and hollow sky  
Over the city's a rip in the sky  
And everything looks good tonight  
  
Singin'  
  
Get into the car  
We'll be the passenger  
We'll ride through the city tonight  
See the city's ripped insides  
We'll see the bright and hollow sky  
We'll see the stars that shine so bright  
The sky was made for us tonight  
  
Oh the passenger  
How how he rides  
Oh the passenger  
He rides and he rides  
He looks through his window  
What does he see?  
He sees the sided hollow sky  
He see the stars come out tonight  
He sees the city's ripped backsides  
He sees the winding ocean drive  
And everything was made for you and me  
All of it was made for you and me  
'Cause it just belongs to you and me  
So let's take a ride and see what's mine  
  
Singing  
  
Oh, the passenger  
He rides and he rides  
He sees things from under glass  
He looks through his window's eye  
He sees the things he knows are his  
He sees the bright and hollow sky  
He sees the city asleep at night  
He sees the stars are out tonight  
And all of it is yours and mine  
And all of it is yours and mine  
Oh, let's ride and ride and ride and ride  
  
Singing
