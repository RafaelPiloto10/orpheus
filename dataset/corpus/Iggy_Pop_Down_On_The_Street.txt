Ooh, ooh  
  
Down on the street where the faces shine  
Floatin' around on a real O-mind  
I see a pretty thing, ain't no wall  
I see a pretty thing, ain't no wall  
  
No wall, no wall  
No wall, ooh  
  
Yeah, deep in the night I'm lost in love  
Yeah, deep in the night I'm lost in love  
A thousand lights look at you  
Thousand lights look at you  
  
At you, at you, at you  
Yeah, come on, pow, pow, pow, ooh  
  
Yeah, yeah  
Ooh, no, ohh, no, ohh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no  
No, no, no, no, no, no  
  
Faces shine  
Real O-mind  
Real O-mind  
I'm the real O-mind, real O-mind
