The Maker of the sun and moon  
The Maker of our earth  
Lo! late in time, a fairer boon  
Himself is brought to birth!  
  
How blest was all creation then  
When God so gave increase  
And Christ, to heal the hearts of men  
Brought righteousness and peace!  
  
No star in all the heights of heaven  
But burned to see Him go  
Yet unto earth alone was given  
His human form to know.  
  
His human form, by man denied  
Took death for human sin  
His endless love, through faith descried  
Still lives the world to win.  
  
O perfect love, outpassing sight  
O light beyond our ken  
Come down through all the world tonight  
And heal the hearts of men!
