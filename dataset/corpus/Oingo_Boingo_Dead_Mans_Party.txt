I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go  
Walkin' with a dead man over my shoulder  
  
Waiting for an invitation to arrive  
Goin' to a party where no one's still alive  
  
CHORUS  
I was struck by lighting  
Walkin' down the street  
I was hit by something last night in my sleep  
It's a dead man's party  
Who could ask for more  
Everybody's comin', leave your body at the door  
Leave your body and soul at the door . . .  
(Don't run away it's only me)  
  
All dressed up with nowhere to go  
Walkin' with a dead man  
Waitin' for an invitation to arrive  
With a dead man . . . Dead Man . . .  
  
Got my best suit and my tie  
Shiny silver dollar on either eye  
I hear the chauffeur comin' to the door  
Says there's room for maybe just one more . . .  
  
CHORUS  
  
Don't run away it's only me  
Don't be afraid of what you can't see  
Don't run away it's only me . . .
