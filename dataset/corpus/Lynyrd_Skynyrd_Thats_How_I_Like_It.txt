Let me tell ya  
Where I come from its bix and gravy not champagne, caviar  
Got pickup trucks ain't no mercedes, that's who we are,  
Oh Yeah wouldn't change a thing.  
I ain't no saint, sometimes a sinner and I can't tell you why,  
But I get up every mornin' and thank the man above  
Oh, my life is good (lemme tell ya how good)  
  
[Chorus]  
Like my women hot and my beer ice cold, real fast car and my whiskey old,  
I can slow drive down an old dirt road that's how I like it  
I can turn my music way up loud, ain't nothin better than the sound of a
crowd,  
American flag it makes me proud, that's how I like it  
  
Listen now, ain't no cell phone towers, you won't catch me online,  
Workin with my hands for hours, that's how I spend my time,  
I won't stand in line for coffee it ain't my cup of tea,  
Out here in the country we got everything we need oh  
  
[Chorus: x2]
