There's a full time reservation  
Made in a bar at the railway station.  
And there's a story, a kind of fable,  
On a card at the corner table.  
On it is a message, been there some time.  
It starts off, "The coffee tasted so fine"  
It says, "One day, this may find you,  
These few words may just remind you.  
We sat here together just to pass time,  
You said how the coffee tasted so fine. "  
It goes on to say, "I love you.  
If you should find this I must hear from you. "  
It gives a number but the name has faded away.  
All that is left are just the words, "Maybe someday"  
That's the story and the fable,  
Never leave alone from a corner table.  
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo,  
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo, doo doo.
