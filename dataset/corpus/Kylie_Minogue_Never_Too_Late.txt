Why can't you see  
That I'm still mad about you  
Even though I've found out about you  
I'll always stay forever true  
  
[Bridge]  
And in my heart  
I will forgive you  
I've got so much love to give you  
  
[Chorus]  
It's never too late  
We've still got time  
It's never too late  
You can still be mine  
It's never too late  
To change your mind  
  
2:  
Why can't you try  
And be a man about it  
And if you stop and think about it  
You just can't keep walking out on me  
And even if it takes forever  
Your love's better late than never  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
It's never too late  
  
To change your mind  
  
Though I try  
I can never put you from my mind  
You just creep right back inside  
And there's no place I can hide  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus: Repeats]
