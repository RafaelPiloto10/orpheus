Why am I chained to a memory?  
Why does the thought of you still torture me?  
When will I find someone to set me free?  
So I won't be chained to a memory, mmm  
  
Why am I chained to the hurt I knew?  
Each day the thought of something so cruel to do  
Where in this world will I escape from you?  
So I won't be chained to a memory  
  
Your letters threw them on the fire  
Your pictures out the window  
All that I could find that reminded me of you  
I threw them all away  
  
I get up in the morning  
I'm pacing the floor  
Like I'm expecting you to walk in the door  
I keep forgetting I won't see you anymore  
Guess I'm doomed to be chained to a memory  
  
Oh, yes I am  
I get up in the morning  
I'm pacing the floor  
Like I'm expecting you to walk in the door  
I keep forgetting I won't see you anymore  
Guess I'm doomed to be chained to a memory  
Yes I am
