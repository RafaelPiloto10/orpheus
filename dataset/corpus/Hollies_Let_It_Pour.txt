Always there when I want you  
I know you'll answer my call  
We've got our own situations  
We don't get into small talk  
Let it pour  
Whoa oh, let it pour  
Whoa oh  
Fate brought us together  
We knew we'd both fall  
Shouldn't really have happened  
It caught us on the rebound, baby  
Let it pour  
Whoa oh, let it pour  
Whoa oh  
It always rains when I see you  
But we weather the storm  
We get on with the action  
So bring on the black clouds, baby  
Let it pour  
Whoa oh, let it pour  
Whoa oh  
You belong to somebody  
You ain't mine I ain't yours  
It doesn't really matter  
So let's close the door  
It's never easy to leave you  
Don't like you lockin' the door  
So raise your glass to the next time  
Though my cup's overflowing baby  
Baby, let it pour  
Whoa oh, let it pour
