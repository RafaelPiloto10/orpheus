Come with me  
I'll take you now,  
To a place that you feel,  
For no reason why, your heart is turned away from me  
  
And I will make you, understand  
  
Everything will become clear to you  
When you see things through, another's eyes  
Everything will become clear to you  
Whatever strengthens you, you will find  
  
Come with me  
I'll take you there  
To a place, where you'll see  
Everything you need  
To be the one, you need to be  
  
And of those things, that you fear  
  
Will sever  
From you  
In time  
  
Everything will become clear to you  
When you see things through, another's eyes  
Everything will becomes clear to you  
Whatever strengthens you, you will find
