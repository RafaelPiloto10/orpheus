One day I'll stop breathing  
My heart will stop beating  
I won't see your face again  
This flesh and blood is weak  
And life isn't ours to keep  
Sometime it has to end  
In time even memories fade away  
With time you might live  
To forgive and forget  
The mistakes that I made  
  
[Chorus]  
I broke some promises  
Sometimes I lied to you  
But one thing will always be true  
I'll never stop loving you  
  
Fall from your grace  
You'll never be replaced  
God knows how hard I've tried  
But it just ain't no use  
I thought I could shake you loose  
I'm still torn up inside  
In time even memories fade away  
With time you might live  
To forgive and forget  
The mistakes that I made  
  
[Chorus: x2]
