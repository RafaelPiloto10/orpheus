It's more than just a feeling  
When it gets inside and takes a hold of you  
You don't want to beat it  
'Cause the pain subsides and the hurt is gone from you, woah  
  
It makes you kinda wonder  
What are we supposed to do, woah  
When the fate of many  
Is guided by the hands of few  
  
Elevating, elevating  
  
No more hiding  
Love is elevating love  
Your light rising  
Love is elevating love  
  
You can't fight it  
The love gets higher  
The love gets higher  
You can't fight it  
The love gets high  
Always gets higher  
  
It's more than just a feeling  
And it's growing stronger, brighter by the day  
You just gotta feel it  
And you just can't doubt it, you can't hide the truth, woah  
  
All this light and this beauty  
And it's shining down all over you, woah  
When the fate of many  
Is guided by the hands of few  
  
No more hiding  
Love is elevating love  
Your light rising  
Love is elevating love  
  
You can't fight it  
The love gets higher  
The love gets higher  
You can't fight it  
The love gets high  
Always gets higher  
  
You can't fight it  
The love gets higher  
The love gets higher  
The love gets higher  
The love gets higher  
The love gets higher  
The love gets higher  
The love gets higher  
The love gets higher  
The love gets higher  
The love gets higher  
The love gets higher
