Don't give up,  
You're gonna see tomorrow  
That you'll be on your feet again  
Sometimes the world's gonna knock you over  
But you will see who are your friends  
  
Come on, stand, up again  
Come on, stand,  
Stand, you're gonna run again  
  
Your faith and patience will be your soldiers  
To guide you through your troubled times  
Just put one foot in front of the other  
The battles are inside your mind  
You have the power to face your demons  
No matter how big or what kind  
And rid yourself of your fear and weakness  
So you can start to live your life  
  
Come on, stand, up again  
Come on, stand,  
Stand, you're gonna run again  
  
Come on baby, stand, up again  
Stand yeah, come on, stand  
Come on you can make it  
Stand, you're gonna run again  
  
Pick up your will and put on your face  
If you need to, just take my hand  
It's time to demonstrate, don't hesitate  
Just get up and say "Yes, I can"  
  
Stand, up again  
Come on, stand,  
Stand, you're gonna run again  
  
Stand, oh stand, up again  
Stand up again, come on, stand,  
Oh come on baby  
Stand, you're gonna run again  
Stand  
Stand, you're gonna run again  
Come on  
Stand, you're gonna run again
