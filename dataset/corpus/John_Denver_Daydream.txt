Yes I've been dreaming about you every day  
Each and every day  
Had I been thinking about you all night long  
I even wrote a song  
  
Just to try to tell you how I really feel  
To make you understand my love is real  
That you're on my mind all the time  
I wish to God you were mine once again  
  
I remember talking to you  
I remember walking with you  
I remember laughing all the time  
And you were mine  
Now the days seem so long  
I can't face a night alone  
I beg you please won't you please come home  
  
I remember talking to you  
I remember walking with you  
I remember laughing all the time  
  
I remember singing to you  
I remember dreaming with you  
I remember loving you alone  
And now the days seem so long  
I can't face a night all alone  
I beg you please won't you please come home
