Sat here thinking about my heart  
All of the places it came apart  
There's just one thing that I need to know  
Why am I always chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it get it get it get it get it get it uh huh  
I ran through the meadow looking for a dream  
Truth is never like what it seems  
I guess there's always so far to go  
Why am I always chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it get it uh huh  
Where is the light  
Where is the love  
Where are the dreams that I once had  
Frittered away  
Gone in the time it takes to get from there to here  
Get it get it get it  
Get it get it get it uh huh  
Get it get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Why am I always chasing the rainbow  
I'd draw you a picture cause it just might help  
To point out the place where we went so wrong  
The only color I'd use is blue  
Why am I always chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it get it uh huh  
Get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Why am I always chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Why am I always chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it get it uh huh
