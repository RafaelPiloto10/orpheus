Well I gave you love, you know it  
So when did you outgrow it  
And decide that you would find another man?  
  
Well you've been out there shakin  
Tell the boys you're chansing  
When you get home, I'll be the bigger man  
  
I've been thinkin bout somethin  
I've been thinkin bout somethin other than you  
  
Well I know your reputation  
Cause you send my heart racing  
You think I would always be the fool  
  
Well I've run out of patience  
For this sticky situation  
You won't find me crying that we're through  
  
I've been thinkin bout somethin  
I've been thinkin bout somethin other you  
It's sad to say, but baby everyday  
I've been thinkin bout somethin  
I've been thinkin bout somethin other than you  
It's sad to say, hey  
  
Well if you're not too proud to beg  
I can give you some respect  
That tune you're humming is never gonna change  
  
You didn't have to do what you did  
I didn't think you'd end it like this  
Cause the love I've got it better than what you gave  
  
Well I've got girls in line  
Waiting for these arms of mine  
Listen up to what I say  
  
I've been thinkin bout somethin  
I've been thinkin bout somethin other than you  
It's sad to say, but baby everyday  
I've been thinkin bout somethin  
I've been thinkin bout somethin other than you  
  
Hey, hey, I took my best shot  
I've had enough of your tainted love you give me everyday  
I tried to limit the loney nights  
But darlin please, c'mon c'mon  
I'm not gonna make that same mistake  
  
You've been out there foolin, but I'm not thinkin bout you  
I've been getting the love that moves me, while you've been getting around  
  
You've been out there foolin, but I'm not thinkin bout you  
I've been getting the love that moves me, while you've been getting around  
  
You've been out there foolin, but I'm not thinkin bout you  
I've been getting the love that moves me, while you've been getting around
