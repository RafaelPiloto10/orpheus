Been driving all nite  
Just to get close to you?  
Babe Babe - I'm moving so fast  
You'd better come on.  
  
The moon is allright  
The freeway's heading south  
My heart is going Boom!  
There's strange taste in my mouth  
Baby Babe - I'm moving real fast  
So try to hold on  
Try to hold on!  
  
Sleeping in my car - I will undess you  
Sleeping in my car - I will caress you  
  
Staying in the back seat of my car making up.  
So come out tonight  
I'll take you for a ride  
This steemy ol' wagon  
The radio is getting wild  
Babe Babe - we're moving so fast  
I try to hang on  
Try to hang on!

Sleeping in my car - I will caress you  
  
Staying in the back seat of my car making love, oh yea!  
Sleeping in my car - I will possess you  
Sleeping in my car - certainly bless you  
Lying in the back seat of my car making up.  
  
The night is so pretty and so young  
The night is so pretty and so young  
So very young
