I wake up every morning with a smile on my face  
Everything in it's place as it should be  
I start out every morning just as free as the breeze  
My cares upon the shelf  
Because I find myself with  
  
No strings and no connections  
No ties to my affections  
I'm fancy free and free for anything fancy  
  
No dates that can't be broken  
No words that can't be spoken  
Especially when I am feeling romancy  
  
Like a robin upon a tree  
Like a sailor that goes to sea  
Like an unwritten melody  
I'm free, that's me  
  
So  
  
Bring on the big attraction  
My decks are cleared for action  
I'm fancy free and free for anything fancy
