(feat. Mark Knopfler)  
  
I didn't ask for much  
As maybe I ought've  
But I'm staying in touch  
With the one I love  
And I can see in the dials  
And in these headlights beams  
Beyond me wildest  
Beyond me wildest dreams  
Beyond me wildest dreams  
Beyond me wildest dreams  
I've been with you  
I've been with you  
  
These are the big playloads  
Hammer down on the floor  
These are the restless roads  
Every one a war  
But in the flashing lines  
I see a love supreme  
Beyond me wildest  
Beyond me wildest dreams  
Beyond me wildest dreams  
Beyond me wildest dreams  
I've been with you  
I've been with you  
  
They promised me some good home time  
And some layover pay  
The agent he's a friend of mine  
Says it's due my way  
I'd drive a thousand miles  
Haul a trailer of tears  
Just to see you smile  
And as the dawn appears  
At the edge of the night  
There's still a light that gleams  
Beyond me wildest  
Beyond me wildest dreams  
Beyond me wildest dreams  
Beyond me wildest dreams  
I've been with you  
I've been with you
