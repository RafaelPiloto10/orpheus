When you are old enough to read this words  
Their meaning will unfold  
These words all that's left  
And though we've never met, my only son  
I hope you know  
That I would have been there to watch you grow  
But my call was heard and I did go  
Now your mission lies ahead of you  
As it did mine so long ago  
To help the helpless ones who all look up to you  
And to defend them to the end  
  
Defender  
Ride like the wind  
Fight proud, my son  
You're the defender  
God has sent  
  
Father, father, father  
I look up to you and heed thy call  
This letter ends my search  
I'll live your dream now passed on to me  
And I now wait to shake the hand of fate  
Like the dusk awaiting dawn  
  
So wizards cast your spell  
With no heart to do me well  
So it's written, it shall be  
  
Defender  
Ride like the wind  
Fight proud, my son  
You're the defender  
God has sent
