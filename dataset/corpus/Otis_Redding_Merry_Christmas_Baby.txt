Merry Christmas baby

Merry Christmas baby  
Sure do treat me nice  
Bought me a diamond ring for Christmas  
I feel like I'm in paradise  
  
I feel mighty fine, y'all  
I've got music on my radio  
Feel mighty fine, girl  
I've got music on my radio, oh, oh, oh  
I feel like I'm gonna kiss you  
Standing beneath that mistletoe  
  
Santa came down the chimney  
Half past three, y'all  
Left all them good ole presents  
For my baby and for me, ha, ha, ha  
  
Merry Christmas baby  
Sure do treat me nice  
You bought me all those good ole presents  
I love you baby rest of my life  
  
Merry Christmas, girl  
Merry, merry, merry Christmas baby  
Sure do treat me nice  
Merry Christmas baby

You bought all those lovely things, yeah  
I feel like I'm in paradise  
  
I wish you a merry Christmas baby  
Happy new year, ha  
A merry Christams, honey  
Everything here is beautiful

For everything that you give me
