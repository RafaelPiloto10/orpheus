You suffer, you're human,  
You sin, you fail,  
You love, you hate, you ail,  
You hunger, you lust, you deceive,  
You trust, you disbelieve.  
  
Bless you for your weakness.  
Bless you for your strength.  
Bless you for that smile  
That is so hard to trace.  
Ooooh, bless you child, bless you child.

You deny, you admit,  
You start, you can't quit.
