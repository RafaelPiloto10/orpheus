Put your hand  
Put your hand  
  
True love never dies  
I'm falling when time is passing  
The world is pulling too fast  
Love thing is made to last  
Don't stop now and keep on trying  
Live like nothing last too long  
Don't give it up  
  
Put your hands up  
Dream until the morning  
Put your hands up  
Love is everything you've got  
  
'Cause the sun will keep on rising  
And every day the world will keep on shining  
'Cause the sun will keep on rising  
You get the way the world will keep on shining  
  
'Cause the sun will keep on rising  
And every day the world will keep on shining  
'Cause the sun will keep on rising  
You get the way the world will keep on shining  
  
The love is better than yours, better than yours  
Look in my eyes  
Better than yours, better than yours  
Look in my eyes  
  
Lalalalalalala  
Lalalalalalala  
  
Put your hands up  
Dream until the morning  
Put your hands up  
Love is everything you've got  
  
'Cause the sun will keep on rising  
And every day the world will keep on shining  
'Cause the sun will keep on rising  
You get the way the world will keep on shining  
  
'Cause the sun will keep on rising  
And every day the world will keep on shining  
'Cause the sun will keep on rising  
You get the way the world will keep on shining  
  
Lalalalalalala  
Lalalalalalala
