These things you keep  
You'd better throw them away  
You wanna turn your back  
On your soulless days  
Once you were tethered  
And now you are free  
Once you were tethered  
Well now you are free  
That was the river  
This is the sea!  
  
Now if you're feelin' weary  
If you've been alone too long  
Maybe you've been suffering from  
A few too many  
Plans that have gone wrong  
And you're trying to remember  
How fine your life used to be  
Running around banging your drum  
Like it's 1973  
Well that was the river  
This is the sea!  
Wooo!  
  
Now you say you've got trouble  
You say you've got pain  
You say've got nothing left to believe in  
Nothing to hold on to  
Nothing to trust  
Nothing but chains  
You're scouring your conscience  
Raking through your memories  
Scouring your conscience  
Raking through your memories  
But that was the river  
This is the sea yeah!  
  
Now I can see you wavering  
As you try to decide  
You've got a war in your head  
And it's tearing you up inside  
You're trying to make sense  
Of something that you just can't see  
Trying to make sense now  
And you know you once held the key  
But that was the river  
And this is the sea!  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!  
  
Now I hear there's a train  
It's coming on down the line  
It's yours if you hurry  
You've got still enough time  
And you don't need no ticket  
And you don't pay no fee  
No you don't need no ticket  
You don't pay no fee  
Because that was the river  
And this is the sea!  
  
Behold the sea!
