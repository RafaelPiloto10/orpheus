You make it all sound easy  
Now you've tasted all my wine  
I never wanted to hear the news  
That you'd found another man  
But it's hard to see  
What you want from me  
It's not easy to be in-between  
It's now up to you to  
Make the move this time  
  
But it ain't easy when you  
Don't know where to turn  
And it ain't easy  
But you take the chance  
The final chance to learn  
Yes, to learn  
That it ain't easy when you  
Don't know where to turn  
And it ain't easy, so you take a look  
Another look at life, look at life  
  
'cause it ain't what you've got  
In the palm of your hand  
And it's not what you'll get  
From another man  
That will last you  
The rest of your life my friend  
  
Monday morning's waiting  
Take a look at what you see  
Make the most of your life  
Don't keep the pages clean  
Baby, now you've got this chance  
Don't leave me out  
It's so hard when  
You're in-between  
What you need and  
What may never be  
  
It ain't easy
