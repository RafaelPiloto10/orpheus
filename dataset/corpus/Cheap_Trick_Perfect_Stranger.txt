I woke up kinda sick  
The air is getting kind of thick  
And I'm tired of everyone  
Like a book on a rainy day  
I'm the one left off the page  
Well it's too much time in the sun  
  
Have you ever wanted to try  
When everything's going right by  
  
Don't need another perfect stranger  
Driving me insane  
Constantly saying it's time for you to change  
(it's time for you to change)  
I don't need another perfect stranger  
To shout out from the sky  
Explaining the reasons, the meaning of my life  
(the meaning of my life)  
  
So when did yes turn into no  
Should you stay or should you go  
Well you're always stuck in between  
I tried to fake a laugh or two  
But my mistakes were all for you  
Too much pain, it's hard to swallow  
You'll be there and gone tomorrow  
  
I can't spend another night or day  
I can't hear another word you say  
The words you say  
  
Don't need another perfect stranger  
Driving me insane  
Constantly saying it's time for you to change  
(time for you to change)  
I don't need another perfect stranger  
To shout out from the sky  
Explaining the reasons, the meaning to my life  
(the meaning to my life)  
  
If not for you  
Oh, if not for you  
We all started strangers  
And I know I'm perfect without you  
We all started strangers  
My world is perfect without you  
  
Don't need another perfect stranger  
Driving me insane  
Constantly saying it's time for you to change  
(it's time for you to change)  
  
I don't need another perfect stranger  
Shout out from the sky  
Explaining the reasons, the meaning of my life  
(the meaning of my life)  
  
Don't need another perfect stranger  
Ringing in my ear  
Yelling and screaming, I don't wanna hear  
(don't wanna hear)  
  
I don't need another perfect stranger  
Trying to run my life  
Constantly pushing  
I don't want your advice  
  
I don't need another perfect stranger
