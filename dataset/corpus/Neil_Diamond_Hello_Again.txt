Hello again hello  
I just called to say hello  
I couldn't sleep  
At all tonight  
And I know its late  
I just couldn't wait  
  
Hello my friends hello  
I just called to let you know  
I think about you every night  
When I'm here alone  
And your there at home  
Hello  
  
Lately it's been crazy  
Maybe I'm to blame  
But I put my heart above your head  
We've been through it all and you love me just the same  
And when your not there  
I still need to hear  
  
Hello again hello  
Its good to need you so  
Its good to love you like I do  
I feel this way when I hear you say  
Hello  
  
Hello my friend hello  
Just called to let you know  
I think about you every night  
And I know it's late but I could't wait  
Hello.
