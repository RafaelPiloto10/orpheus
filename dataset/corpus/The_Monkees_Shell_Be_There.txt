When your dreams have died around you, she'll be there  
When you need a hand to guide you, she'll be there  
And when you feel rejected 'cause life is not what you expected  
I know that she'll be there  
If I hadn't lied and cheated, she'd be here  
If she wasn't so mistreated, she'd be here  
And if you don't abuse her, I know you'll never, ever lose her  
And she will always be there  
I was too late to discover  
How much I really did love her  
But now, her place is with you  
And I must face it, it's over with you  
She'll be there, she'll be there  
And if you don't abuse her, I know you'll never, ever lose her  
And she will always be there, she'll be there  
She'll be there, she'll be there
