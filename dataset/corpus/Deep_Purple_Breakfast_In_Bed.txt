Woke up this morning, rain coming down  
Washing the sin from the street  
Sometimes I feel like I'm losing ground  
Just trying to make ends meet  
Well I work every day to sweat out my dreams  
Won't you show me that you understand  
It's only my life, whatever that means  
And you've got it all in your hands  
  
I need someone to pull me through  
Won't you take the pain from my head  
Give me all your loving, the way you always do  
Give me breakfast in bed  
  
I feel like the good days are numbered  
And my nights are getting too long  
My hopes and my fears take their toll on the years  
And my willpower's almost gone  
Well it's a time full of trouble  
A time of desperate need  
Sometimes life don't make sense  
Fighting the anger, jealousy and greed  
One day I'll look back and wonder where it all went  
  
I need someone to pull me through  
Won't you take the pain from my head  
Give me all your loving, the way you always do  
Give me breakfast in bed  
  
It don't take much to please me  
I'm just a simple man  
Won't you please believe me  
I gotta tell you  
It don't take much, a tender touch  
So baby do the best that you can
