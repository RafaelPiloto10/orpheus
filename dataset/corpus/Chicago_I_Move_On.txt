Catherine Zeta-Jones: While truckin' down  
The road of life  
Although all hope seems gone...  
I just move on  
  
Renee Zellweger: When I can't find a single star  
To hang my wish upon  
I just move on...  
I move on  
  
Catherine Zeta-Jones: I run so fast!  
A shotgun blast  
Can hurt me not one bit!  
  
Renee Zellweger: I'm on my toes! 'Cause heaven knows  
A movin' target's hard to hit!  
  
Both: So as we play  
An ex-ballet  
We're not the dyin' swan  
We just move on...  
We move on  
  
Renee Zellweger: Just when it seems  
We're out of dreams  
And things have got us down...  
  
Catherine Zeta-Jones: We don't despair!  
We don't go there!  
We hang our bonnets out of town!  
  
Both: So there's no doubt  
We're well cut out  
To run life's marathon...  
We just move on...  
We just move on...  
  
So light of foot!  
We can't stay put!  
We just move on!  
  
Yes, we move on...
