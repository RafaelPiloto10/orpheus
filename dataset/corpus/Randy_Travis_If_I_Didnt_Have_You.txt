Well I lost my heart on the day we met.  
But I gained a lot, and that I don't regret.  
  
Then I hung around, till you said, "I do".  
  
I knew I wouldn't have nothing,  
If I didn't have you.  
  
Well it changed my thinking And it changed your name.  
And Neither one of us will ever be the same.  
  
And I swear I'm never gonna be untrue,  
Cause, I wouldn't have nothing,  
If I didn't have you.  
  
If I didn't have you.  
I'd long ago,  
Been left in the dark, out in the cold.  
  
Blowing around from town to town.  
Like a feather in the wind.  
  
If I didn't have you.  
I know I'd be.  
Floundering around like a ship at sea.  
Lost in the rain of a hurricane,  
And that's where I'd have been.  
  
  
But I didn't get lost cause I saw your light.  
Shining, like a beacon on a cold dark night.  
And, The sun came up and The skies turned blue.  
  
No I wouldn't have nothing,  
If I didn't have you.  
  
Well I count my blessings every night I pray.  
That the lord lets me keep you just one more day.  
And, Every day he does cause, God knows too.  
  
That I wouldn't have nothing,  
If I didn't have you.  
  
If I didn't have you,  
I'd long ago.  
Been left in the dark, out in the cold.  
Blowing around from town to town  
Like a feather in the wind.  
  
If I didn't have you,  
I know I'd be  
Floundering around like a ship at sea.  
Lost in the rain of a hurricane,  
And that's where I'd have been.  
  
But I didn't get lost cause I saw your light.  
Shining like a beacon on a cold dark night.  
And the sun came up and the skies turned blue.  
  
No I wouldn't have nothing,  
If I didn't have you.  
  
Well I've already said it but I swear its true.  
I know I wouldn't have nothing,  
If I didn't have you.
