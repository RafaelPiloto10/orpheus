There's a rumor of a midnight man  
So silent in disguise  
And every time he looks your way  
You see it in his eyes  
Like a window to the storm  
He just invades your paradise  
Don't you buy what he is selling  
It's just lies  
  
When he says, these hearts are willing  
Story goes, these dreams are free  
  
Only takes a moment  
But you must acclimatize  
Don't you buy what he is selling  
It's just lies  
  
Over your left shoulder I have seen the angry beast  
Heard the war horn screaming, as they gather for the feast  
Seen a star-crossed angel with the death-card and a shield  
  
We're walking through mindfields  
You see an angel and she takes you by the hand  
We're walking through mindfields  
Her lips are moving like she's praying  
We're walking through mindfields  
She speaks so softly and you want to understand  
What she's saying  
  
There's a stairway leading to the sun  
I walk it in my sleep  
And a ship of fools above the sky  
Who've gotten into deep  
With a doorway into nowhere  
And the path is way too steep  
Don't lose your angry soul  
It's yours to keep  
  
Where it ends, it's the beginning  
And it stays, right to the end  
  
The reason is unclear my friend  
It almost makes me weep  
So don't lose your angry soul  
It's yours to keep
