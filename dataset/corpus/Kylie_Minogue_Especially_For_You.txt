Especially for you  
I want to let you know what I was going through  
All the time we were apart  
I thought of you  
You were in my heart  
My love never changed  
I still feel the same  
  
Especially for you  
I want to tell you I was feeling that way too  
And if dreams were wings, you know  
I would have flown to you  
To be where you are  
No matter how far  
And now that I'm next to you  
  
No more dreaming about tomorrow  
Forget the loneliness and the sorrow  
I've got to say  
It's all because of you  
  
[Chorus:]  
And now we're back together, together  
I want to show you my heart is oh so true  
And all the love I have is  
Especially for you  
  
Especially for you  
I want to tell you, you mean all the world to me  
How I'm certain that our love was meant to be  
You changed my life  
You showed me the way  
And now that I'm next to you  
  
I've waited long enough to find you  
I want to put all the hurt behind you  
Oh,  
And I want to bring out all the love inside you  
Oh  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
You were in my heart  
My love never changed  
  
[Chorus:]
