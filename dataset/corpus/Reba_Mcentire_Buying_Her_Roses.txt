I took him for granted  
Now looking back at it  
He's not the only one to blame  
Between the jobs and the kids  
Wasn't much time for him  
We let the fire slip away from the flame  
  
Guess I shouldn't be surprised  
But as hard as I try  
I can't believe it's happened to me  
But I know where he's at  
And I know it's a fact  
I'd have to be blind not to see  
  
[Chorus]  
He's out buying her roses  
And where that leaves me God only knows  
I know I should tell him  
To leave me forever  
But what'll I do if he goes  
  
Should I put up a fight  
Does it matter who's right  
Should I ruin my life or my pride  
Can we save what we had  
And if he comes back  
Will I ever get it out of my mind  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
What'll I do if he goes  
What'll I do if he goes
