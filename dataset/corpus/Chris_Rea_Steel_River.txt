I was born and raised on steel river  
I see it all like it was yesterday  
The ships and bridges they were all delivered  
From Sydney harbour to the Cisco bay  
  
And I met my love down on steel river  
We served our dreams and spent our childhood days  
In rainy streets we'd kiss away the shivers  
And hide from fear inside the latest craze  
  
Dancing to Motown  
Making love with Carole King record playing  
And oh how I loved you  
Say goodbye steel river  
  
Ten thousand bombers hit the steel river  
And many died to keep her running free  
And she survived but now she's gone forever  
Her burning heart is just a memory  
  
And I ran away from life on steel river  
Luck or not I gladly took the break  
The odds were low the chances nearly zero  
A chance it was I had to take  
Say goodbye steel river  
  
They say that salmon swim in steel river  
They say it's good to see them back again  
I know it hurts to see what really happened  
I know one salmon ain't no good to them  
  
They were born and raised to serve their steel mother  
It was they taught and all they ever knew  
And they believed that she would keep their children  
Even though not a single word was true  
Say goodbye steel river
