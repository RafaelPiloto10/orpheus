Like the seasons you change your mind  
It seems like loving you is a crime.  
  
I remember those days  
Oh, so long ago  
Like the first time I took you  
To a picture show  
Or the first time I kissed you  
Beneath the moonlit sky  
I put my hand on my heart  
I thought I'd die  
Like the seasons  
  
Yes, you were for me  
It was plain to see  
I knew in my heart  
  
You were the one for me  
Though people used to try  
To get us down  
As time goes on  
We're still around  
Like the seasons  
  
We had our share  
Of ups and downs  
We had our share  
Of nights on the town  
The days were short  
But the nights were long  
My love for you  
It grew so strong  
Like the seasons  
  
But as we grew old  
Your love turned cold  
Gone are the days  
Of glitter and gold  
I work so hard  
To keep you mine  
Now all I have is  
Nothing but time  
  
Like the seasons you change your mind  
It seems like loving you is a crime.
