I've just got to find  
Find a way, back home to you girl  
  
Life's been Hell to pay  
I can't disobey,  
Gotta live in my world  
  
I hear voices calling  
From the faces never seen  
Darkness all around me  
I am falling in between  
  
You've been lookin' down  
Down to the ground  
On everything I say girl  
  
Hope just can't be found  
I'm so gagged and bound  
Because of you girl  
  
I hear voices calling  
From the places I have been  
Love and understanding  
Only flows from deep within  
Darkness that surrounds me  
I am falling in between
