I fell in love with a wind-up souvenir  
I bought it downtown as I was on my way to meet you  
She sounds the like the songs you used to sing to put me to sleep  
Now that you're gone, she's all that I've left to hold  
  
And I feel so all alone  
No one's gonna fix me when I'm broke  
How do you cry with inanimate eyes?  
You're never gonna smile with the way that you're wired  
  
And I feel so all alone  
  
I gave it to you.(I don't need a toy)  
I thought you might appreciate it (I don't like the way that it moves)  
The way that she dances  
The painted look upon her face (Someone must've thrown this away)  
She must have come from the sun (I've got too much stuff)  
I want to take her through the park  
Where she'd tell me I'm all (speaking of which)  
That she wants  
If she could even talk (I think we Need to talk)  
  
I feel so all alone  
No one's gonna fix me when I'm broke  
How do you cry with inanimate eyes?  
You're never gonna smile with the way that you are  
  
And I feel so all alone  
I feel so all alone  
  
And she sits on my shelf  
It makes me think of you  
The way she carries the things that remind me of who  
We used to be before we became antiques  
She's a lot like you  
But when I hold her too tight, I know she'll break  
She just takes some glue to stay  
  
And oI feel so all alone  
No one's gonna fix me when I'm broke  
How do you cry with inanimate eyes?  
You're never gonna smile with the way that you are  
  
And I feel so all alone  
I feel so all alone  
I feel so all alone
