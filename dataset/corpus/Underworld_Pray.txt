Pray for me  
As you would a child  
In a land of oppression  
  
Millions cry around the world  
But I cry in your back garden  
  
Pray for me  
And I'll pray for you  
It's no revolution  
But it's somethin' -  
Somethin' we can do!  
  
Pray all the day  
All the -  
All the day  
All the day  
  
Pray for me  
As you do for peace  
In a world of aggression  
Hear me!  
Must it make the news  
For us to show some affection  
  
Pray for me  
And I'll pray for you  
It's no revolution  
But it's somethin' -  
Somethin' we can do!  
  
Pray all the day  
All the -  
All the day  
All the -  
  
As it was in the beginning - so shall it be...  
Until next week!
