I was drivin' along at the end of the day  
I was weary and so all alone  
Looking ahead by the side of the road  
What I saw was the sign "Telephone"  
  
[Chorus]  
Talking to you is something I need  
More than I needed before  
If I ever get through won't you give me the time  
Won't you answer my call, won't you stay on the line  
  
It's a moment of truth then a shadow of doubt  
Now I need you to stay on the line  
It's never as bad when we're talkin' it out  
Now I need you to stay on the line  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Answer my call, won't you stay on the line  
  
I believe I have a right to say  
What I want to say  
And I believe it but I'm keeping it to myself  
I believe I have a right to do  
What I want to do  
  
All of my life, all of my life  
All of my life, all of my life  
  
I believe I have a right to be  
Where I want to be  
I believe it and I want to be there with you  
I believe I have a right to see  
Who I want to see  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
All of my life, all of my life  
All of my life, all of my life
