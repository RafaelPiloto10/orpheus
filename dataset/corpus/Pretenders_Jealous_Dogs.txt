Those jealous dogs, always on the alert  
Tattle tale rights  
They'll take your back and leave your shirt  
Like that jealous bitch  
Always wanting more  
The courts have made her rich  
And the click of high heels down the corridor  
Jealous, jealous, jealous dogs  
  
Those jealous dogs, detectives every one  
Don't be a sucker all your life  
She's gonna have you hung  
Evidence, evidence, evidence  
Suspicion invites treachery  
Oh you really got taken  
Bringing home the bacon  
Jealous, jealous, jealous dogs  
  
Bow wow wow, here come the dogs  
Grrrrrr, here come the dogs  
Don't lay down, here come the dogs  
Stand straight don't slouch  
Get down off the couch  
  
You're gonna wet on the couch  
Get down, get down  
  
Those jealous dogs, they get worse and worse  
Every time you turn around  
They're sniffin' at your purse  
Who do they think we are?  
What do they think we do?  
It's hard to get in the mood  
When you're treated like some kind of dog food  
Jealous, jealous, jealous dogs  
  
Bow wow wow, here come the dogs  
Oh ruff ruff, here come the dogs  
Get down, here come the dogs  
Mind your leg, roll over and beg  
  
Happy birthday  
Merry Christmas
