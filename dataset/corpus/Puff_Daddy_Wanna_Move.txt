(feat. Big Boi, Ciara, Scar)  
  
[Intro:]  
Atl Georgia  
To New York City  
The Kings have Arrived  
Let's Rock  
Let's Rock  
Uh huh  
Don't Stop  
Let's Rock  
Don't Stop  
Let's Rock  
Let's Rock  
Don't Stop  
  
[Scar]  
Hey Forever I'm on the grind  
My mind is already made up  
Sippin the finest wine  
To Jamaica  
Everyday that I wake up  
I look up at Christ and think  
Therefore he lifts me up  
So I don't see no haters  
  
[Diddy]  
Let me get shit in order  
I got sumthin' for ya  
You ever seen a black man  
Walk on water?  
Nigga talk shit to me  
And I'ma try to ignore ya  
Get Disrespectful  
And I'ma have to come for ya  
Keep ya gangsta with me now won't go get your lawyers  
Cause my combo quick  
They comin' like de la hoya  
Watch asses in the streets  
Cause they will come for ya  
  
[Ciara]  
[Chorus:]  
Don't ya wanna move  
Does this make you groove?  
Is the feelin good to you  
It matters  
Get ya Hot  
Our music our music  
Come enjoy the fun  
Don't ya wanna move  
Just make ya wanna groove  
Does this feelin' get to you  
Let Us get you Hot  
Our music our music  
Come enjoy the ride  
  
[Big Boi]  
Need I remind ya'll  
I started from the bottom  
But I'm destined for the top  
And I ain't stoppin'  
Till I got em  
Call me clumsy for the weight  
I'm droppin' records  
But they breakin'  
Still standin'  
Like the fuse on my cannon  
Blowin' weight kid  
Top shelf you gotta reach high to be the best  
I'm like Hennessey and coke and xo  
And nothin' less  
I'm the nigga like big I know you know the rest  
Suppose I was a toad  
And no I ain't gonna rest  
I'ma bang on  
And make this music that we sang on  
A skunk pussy nigga  
Always got my stink on  
Hang on  
You wasn't shit before we came on  
You know you lame holmes  
You do the same song  
Over and over again you bout to game holmes  
Nigga you don't want nuthin'  
Zero zitch  
Dolla eight Nathaniel  
That's how ya get ya collar poppin  
Now blow out ya candles  
You do it ya don't son  
  
[Ciara]  
[Chorus:]  
Don't ya wanna move  
Does this make ya wanna groove  
Is the feelin' good to you  
It matters  
Get ya hot  
Our music our music  
Come enjoy the fun  
Don't ya wanna move  
Just make ya wanna groove  
Does this feelin' get to you  
Let us get ya hot  
Our music our music  
Come enjoy the ride  
  
[Big Boi]  
Need I remind yall  
I started from the bottom  
But I'm destined for the top  
And I ain't stoppin'  
Till I got em  
Call me clumsy for the weight  
I'm droppin' records  
But they breakin'  
Still standin'  
Like the fuse on my cannon  
Blowin' weight kid  
  
[Diddy]  
Here we go back again  
Makin' that beat go bump bump bump bump  
I do you back so hard  
Why do niggas act so hard  
I don't give a damn about a broad  
I ain't gotta floss in the fastlane  
Ride right past lane  
I'ma in the atl  
Flyin' down cascade  
Still gettin' money  
Ain't nothin' change man  
Spend a couple mill  
Just to make my change rang  
  
[Big Boi]  
Nigga you don't want nuthin'  
Zero zitch  
Dolla eight Nathaniel  
That's how ya get ya collar poppin  
Now blow out ya candles  
You do it ya don't son

[Diddy]  
Hey yo Ciara  
Take us home baby  
  
[Ciara]  
I feel high on the music  
I feel  
I might lose it  
It's talkin' through the melody  
I can hear it tellin' me  
To move  
I feel high on the music  
I feel  
I might losin'  
It's talkin' through the melody  
I can hear it tellin' me to move  
Are you ready to press play?  
Are you ready to press play?  
  
[Diddy]  
Nah they ain't ready  
They don't believe me yet baby  
Y'all don't believe me yet?
