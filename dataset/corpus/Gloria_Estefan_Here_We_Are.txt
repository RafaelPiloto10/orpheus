Here we are  
Face to face  
We forget, time and place  
Hold me now  
Don't let go  
Though it hurts and we both know  
The time we spend together's gonna fly  
And everything you do to me  
Is gonna feel so right  
Baby when you're loving me  
I feel like I could cry  
'Cause there's nothing I can do  
To keep from loving you  
  
Here we are  
All alone  
Trembling hearts, beating strong  
Reaching out, a breathless kiss  
I never thought could feel like this  
I want to stop the time from passing by  
I want to close my eyes and feel your lips are touching mine  
Baby when you're close to me  
I want you more each time  
And there's nothing I can do, to keep from loving you  
  
There's nothing I can do  
I'm helpless in your arms  
Oh baby what you do  
I'm in love, this is it  
There's no turning back this time  
No no no  
  
Here we are  
Once again  
But this time we're only friends  
Funny world  
Sometimes lies  
Become the game, when loves the prize  
And though no one knows what's going on inside  
And all the love I feel for you  
Is something I should hide  
When I have you close to me  
The feelings so sublime  
That there's nothing I can do  
To keep from loving you
