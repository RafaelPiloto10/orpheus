In my mind I see a mirage on the wall,  
But unfortunately it's not there at all.  
So I guess I'll draw my mirage on the wall,  
Then it can be here to see and enjoyed by all.  
  
My mirage, I'll be drawing you soon.  
Then all of the beautiful people that come to our home,  
They'll be seeing you too.  
My mirage,  
I'll be drawing you soon,  
My mirage, I'll be seeing you soon.
