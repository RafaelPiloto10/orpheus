(Originally recorded by Sweet Savage)  
  
Sound of gunfire comes through the night  
Killing and hatred, it's a terrible sight  
Reports come in of the heavy attack  
Message is seen, we're moving back  
  
Preparations are made for the journey back  
It's a survival, supplies are packed  
No more nights in this eternal hell  
Destination is simple, we move out  
  
Killing time - you left from the line  
Killing time - your turn to kill  
Killing time - what do you say?  
Killing time - aha, killing time  
  
And he knew what he needed to keep us alive  
No time for cowardice, kill and survive  
Like a killer kid with a switchblade knife  
Nasty word, he'll take your life  
  
The silence is over, they attack again  
Killing and hatred drive me insane  
Reports come in of a heavy attack  
Message is seen, we're moving back  
  
Killing time - you left from the line  
Killing time - your turn to kill  
Killing time - what do you say?  
Killing time - aha, killing time
