And now the lonely days are done  
And with each rising of the sun, love begins anew  
And if you ever ask me why  
I know that my love will never die I'll say these words to you  
Of all the souls I've ever known  
Mine sings to yours and yours alone and yours sings just to me  
In all this world I'll never find  
A heart that could beat as close to mine and this time I can see  
A love like this is so hard to find  
And so many never do  
And loves like this, when they even exist  
Are precious and few, you know they're precious and few  
Down the miles, through the years  
Yours is the star by which I steer, the brightest star I've known  
And when I feel all hope is gone, yours is the love that leads me on  
The light that guides me home  
The light that guides me home  
Your light will guide me home
