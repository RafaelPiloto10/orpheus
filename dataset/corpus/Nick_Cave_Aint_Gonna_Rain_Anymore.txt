Ain't Gonna Rain Anymore  
  
Once there came a storm in the form of a girl  
It blew to pieces my snug little world  
Sometimes I swear I can still hear her howl  
Down through the wreckage and the ruins  
  
And it ain't gonna rain anymore  
Now my baby's gone  
And it ain't gonna rain anymore  
Now my baby's gone  
  
Now the storm has passed over me  
I'm left to drift on a dead calm sea  
And watch her forever through the cracks in the beams  
Nailed across the doorways of the bedrooms of my dreams  
  
And it ain't gonna rain anymore  
Now my baby's gone  
And it ain't gonna rain anymore  
Now my baby's gone  
  
Now I got no one to hold  
Now I am all alone again  
It ain't too hot but it ain't too cold  
And there is no sign of rain  
  
And it ain't gonna rain anymore  
Now my baby's gone  
And it ain't gonna rain anymore  
Now my baby's gone  
And I'm  
Here I'm on my own  
  
She ain't coming back no more  
She ain't coming back no more  
She ain't coming back no more  
Say what you will, I don't care  
  
And it ain't gonna rain anymore  
Now my baby's gone, yeah  
And it ain't gonna rain anymore  
Now my baby has gone
