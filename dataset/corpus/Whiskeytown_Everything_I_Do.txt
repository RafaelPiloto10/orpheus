She's got diamonds in her eyes  
That she likes to hide  
Seek and you'll find  
The hide and seeking kind  
She's got rings  
Wrapped around your precious things  
And what the day brings  
Oh, it's no surprise  
Don't you ask me how I'm doing  
When everything I do says I miss you  
Don't you ask me how I'm doing  
When everything I do when everything I do  
When everything I do says I miss you  
She's got diamonds in her eyes  
That she likes to hide  
Seek and you'll find  
The hide and seeking kind  
She's got rings  
Wrapped around your precious things  
What the day brings  
Oh, it's no surprise  
Don't you ask me how I'm doing  
When everything I do says I miss you  
Don't you ask me how I'm doing  
When everything I do when everything I do  
When everything I do says I miss you  
She's got diamonds in her eyes  
That she likes to hide  
Seek and you'll find  
The hide and seeking kind  
She's got rings  
Wrapped around your precious things  
What the day brings  
Oh, it's no surprise  
Don't you ask me how I'm doing  
When everything I do says I miss you  
Don't you ask me how I'm doing  
When everything I do when everything I do  
When everything I do
