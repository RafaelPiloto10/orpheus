Oh my mama told me  
'Cause she say she learned the hard way  
Say she wanna spare the children  
She say don't give or sell your soul away  
'Cause all that you have is your soul  
  
[Chorus: ]  
Don't be tempted by the shiny apple  
Don't you eat of the bitter fruit  
Hunger only for a taste of justice  
Hunger only for a world of truth  
'Cause all that you have is your soul  
  
I was a pretty young girl once  
I had dreams, I had high hopes  
I married a man he stole my heart away  
He gave his love but what a high price I paid  
And all that you have is your soul  
  
Why was I such a young fool  
Thought I'd make history  
Making babies was the best I could do  
Thought I'd made something that could be mine forever  
Found out the hard way one can't possess another  
And all that you have is your soul  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
I thought, thought that I could find a way  
To beat the system  
To make a deal and have no debts to pay  
I'd take it all, take it all I'd run away  
Me for myself first class and first rate  
But all that you have is your soul  
  
Here I am waiting for a better day  
A second chance  
A little luck to come my way  
A hope to dream a hope that I can sleep again  
And wake in the world with a clear conscience and clean hands  
'Cause all that you have is your soul  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
Oh my mama told me  
'Cause she said she learned the hard way  
She said she want to spare the children  
She said it don't give to sell your soul away  
All that you have is your soul  
All that you have  
All that you have  
All that you have  
All that you have is your soul
