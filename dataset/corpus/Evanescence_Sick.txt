Embrace the silence  
'Cause there's nothing that can change the way I feel  
Taken all that you wanted  
Now there's nothing that can change the way I feel  
  
Hold on, little girl  
The end is soon to come  
  
Sick of it all, sick of it all  
We will not follow  
Sick of it all, sick of it all  
They don't understand how  
Sick we are, sick we are  
Of this bottomless pit of lies behind closed eyes  
  
Oceans between us  
And there's nothing that can change the way I feel  
I can still taste the poison of every fall  
Every breath, our ways to heal  
  
Hold on, little girl  
The end is soon to come  
  
Sick of it all, sick of it all  
We will not follow  
Sick of it all, sick of it all  
They don't understand how  
Sick we are, sick we are  
Of this bottomless pit of lies behind closed eyes  
  
Someday you'll know the peace  
Someday the light will break through  
And nothing you tell yourself  
Will save us from the truth  
  
Screamin' out  
Sick of it all, sick of it all  
We will not follow  
Sick of it all, sick of it all  
They don't understand how  
Sick we are, sick we are  
Of this bottomless pit of lies behind closed eyes
