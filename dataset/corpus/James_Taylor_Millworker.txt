Now my grandfather was a sailor,  
He blew in off the water.  
My father was a farmer and I,  
His only daughter.  
Took up with a no good millworking man  
From Massachusetts  
Who dies from too much whiskey  
And leaves me these three faces to feed.  
  
Millwork ain't easy, millwork ain't hard,  
Millwork it ain't nothing  
But an awful boring job.  
I'm waiting for a daydream  
To take me through the morning  
And put me in my coffee break  
Where I can have a sandwich and remember.  
  
Then it's me and my machine  
For the rest of the morning,  
For the rest of the afternoon  
And the rest of my life.  
  
Now my mind begins to wander  
To the days back on the farm.  
I can see my father smiling at me,  
Swinging on his arm.  
I can hear my granddad's stories  
Of the storms out on Lake Erie  
Where vessels and cargoes and fortunes  
And sailors' lives were lost.  
  
Yes, but it's my life has been wasted,  
And I have been the fool  
To let this manufacturer  
Use my body for a tool.  
I can ride home in the evening,  
Staring at my hands,  
Swearing by my sorrow  
That a young girl  
Ought to stand a better chance.  
  
So may I work the mills  
Just as long as I am able  
And never meet the man  
Whose name is on the label.  
  
It be me and my machine  
For the rest of the morning  
And the rest of the afternoon,  
Gone for the rest of my life.
