Jumpin Jesus my oh my  
He's got a great big bottle of sunshine  
Jumpin Jesus why oh why  
Take the time to get inside  
To get inside  
  
So what's a wall with so much yellow for?  
I don't know what it's for  
So what's a wall has so much yellow for?  
I don't know what it's for  
  
Jumpin Jesus my oh my  
He's got a great big bottle of sunshine  
Jumpin Jesus why oh why  
Take the time to get inside  
To get inside get inside get inside get inside get inside  
  
Arm and hammer and Odessa lives with his wife  
And his child on a house boat  
He likes sunflowers and big picture frames and Van Gogh  
Jumpin Jesus my oh my  
He's got a great big bottle of sunshine  
Jumpin Jesus why oh why  
Take the time to get inside  
To get inside get inside get inside get inside get inside  
Na na na na na na na na  
Lala la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la laaaaa laaaa laaaa
