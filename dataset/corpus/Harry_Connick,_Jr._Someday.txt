Someday,  
You'll want me like I want you  
But I'll be gone  
With somebody new  
  
Someday,  
You'll cry the way I did  
You'll hang your head  
But tears cant begin  
  
You'll walk the floor day, and night  
Not a thing will be going right  
Your nerves will keep you in despair  
You'll be pulling out your hair  
  
Someday,  
Love will get you down, you'll see  
You're gonna suffer  
The way you done for me  
  
You'll walk the floor, day and night  
Not a thing will be going right  
Your nerves will keep you in dispare  
Girl, you'll be pulling out your hair  
  
Someday,  
Love will get you down, you'll see  
You're gonna suffer  
The way you done for me  
  
(you're gonna suffer)  
(the way you done for me)
