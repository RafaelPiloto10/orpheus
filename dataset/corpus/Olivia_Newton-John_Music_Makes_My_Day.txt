Music makes my day  
It warms an empty place when you're away  
Music makes my day  
Love you are my song  
Your melody's so soft  
Your love so strong  
Love you are my song  
  
And though good fortune seems a long time calling  
The sadness creeps into my song  
My pearly friend will gently soothe me  
And sing along  
  
Music makes my day  
It seems my waiting hours just fly away  
Music makes my day  
If I lost my friend  
His loving words no more  
My song would end  
If I lost my friend  
  
And though good fortune seems a long time calling  
The sadness creeps into my song  
My pearly friend will gently soothe me  
And sing along  
  
Music makes my day  
It warms an empty place when you're away  
Music makes my day  
You know it makes it
