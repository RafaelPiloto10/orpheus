I? do anything if you? just let me hold you  
I'd do anything to change your mind  
Climb the highest mountain or swim the deepest ocean  
Anything to make you mine  
  
Anything, anytime  
Day or night, rain or shine  
There ain't nothin' I won't do  
To get to you  
  
Is there anything I can say to make you love me  
Is there anything I haven't tried  
Well I? take you 'round the world  
Just to walk you down a dirt road  
Anything to make you mine  
  
Anything, anytime  
Day or night, rain or shine  
There ain't nothin' I won't do  
To get to you  
  
Well I give anything if I had you forever  
I'd give anything to see that time  
Well I walk upon my hands up the stairway to heaven  
Anything to make you mine  
  
Anything, anytime  
Day or night, rain or shine  
There ain't nothin' I won't do  
To get to you
