It won't be easy, it won't be hard  
To find the reason, to find the rhyme  
To get your feet back on the ground  
To get your feet back on the ground  
  
We'll be going home  
Where the passion finds the perfect love  
Finds the perfect love  
Finds the perfect love  
  
We'll be going home  
Where the passion covers me with love  
Covers me with love  
Covers me with love  
  
It won't be out there, it can't be far  
Falls like a teardrop to the star  
A wall of silence all around  
A wall of silence all around  
  
We'll be going home  
Where the passion finds the perfect love  
Finds the perfect love  
Finds the perfect love  
  
We'll be going home  
Where the passion covers me with love  
Covers me with love  
Covers me with love  
  
The miracle of love blinds me with your charms  
The miracle of love, take me in your arms  
  
We'll be going home  
Where the passion finds the perfect love  
Finds the perfect love  
Finds the perfect love  
  
We'll be going home  
Where the passion covers me with love  
Covers me with love  
Covers me with love
