This city's made of diamonds  
And tomorrow glass will grow  
On the freedoms that divide us  
They're coming after me  
Flashback nineteen eighty-four  
Now who's knock-knocking at your door?  
A thought that starts a riot  
They're coming after me now  
  
Life is not the same  
I am one but  
Sparks turn into flames  
  
Will you take what's in my head?  
And erase me when I'm dead?  
'Cause the future is now  
Now I'm disappearing  
  
The day has turned to night  
Can you save me from the light?  
'Cause the future is here  
This is how I disappear  
  
Running down a spiral  
With the light of better men  
Shouting progress is survival  
Take one last look and see me  
Now you see me, now you don't  
No vow to break  
No string of hope  
My hero, your pariah  
They're coming after me now  
  
Life is just God's game  
I am one but  
Sparks turn into flames  
  
And you get what you deserve  
When revenge is what you serve  
'Cause the future is now  
Now I'm disappearing  
  
I'll sink into the night  
And I'm turning off the lights  
'Cause the future is here  
This is how I disappear  
  
So the end's what you make it  
And that's what you're looking for  
This is the future  
The future is now  
  
Disappear, disappear  
Disappear, disappear  
  
Now turn off the lights  
The skies are blue inside you  
Turn off the lights  
They'll get inside of you  
  
Will you take what's in my head?  
And erase me when I'm dead?  
'Cause the future is now  
Now I'm disappearing  
  
The day has turned to night  
Can you save me from the light?  
'Cause the future is here  
This is how I disappear, disappear, disappear, disappear
