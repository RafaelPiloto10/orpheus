Street corners seem designed to lie in wait  
For a chance to get involved in lovers' fate  
And this one seems as good as any I've seen  
So wait here with me until six-fifteen  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm waiting for you  
But you're very late  
I know you'll come anyway  
And I can hardly wait  
Evidently  
There's a difficulty  
I know you'll come anyway  
And I can hardly wait  
Wait  
  
I see you approaching you're the eyes of the crowd  
The traffic and people, God they're all so loud  
But in a couple of moments they will all disappear  
Because we're ever so close when we're ever so near  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Punctuality  
Was never much to me  
Being yourself is the main thing  
Forget about the time  
Forget about the time  
Being yourself is the main thing  
The main thing  
The main thing love
