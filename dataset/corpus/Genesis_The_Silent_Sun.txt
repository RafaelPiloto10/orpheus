The silent sun that never shines  
She is the warmth of my lonely heart  
The motion of a turning wheel  
Can't you stop it and look around?  
  
Baby you feel so close  
I wish you could see my love  
Baby you've changed my life  
I'm trying to show you  
  
A tiny stone that hides from me  
Can't you see that I'm just outside?  
A mountain stream that chills the sea  
Can't you feel in your useless pride?  
  
Baby you feel so close  
I wish you could see my love  
Baby you've changed my life  
I'm trying to show you  
  
When night reveals a star-filled sky  
I want to hold it in my hands  
When snowflakes heal the ugly ground  
Your beauty hides the joy I've found  
  
Baby you feel so close  
I wish you could see my love  
Baby you've changed my life  
I'm trying to show you
