Ooh I promise not to do it again  
I promise not to do it  
  
You can't say I don't love you  
Just because I cheat on you  
'Cause you can't see all I do  
To keep you from knowing the things I do  
Like erase my phone  
And keep it out of town  
I keep it strapped up when I sleep around  
Well I should have known one say you'd find out  
But you can't go and leave me now  
  
You know that I love you  
There's no one above you  
I said it the last time  
But this is the last time  
Don't make me over  
'Cause I can be faithful  
Baby you're my number one  
You're my number one  
  
Now who is she?  
What's her name?  
You don't need to know about everything  
We fight about this  
We fight about that  
You hang up the phone and call me right back  
Well I'll never be something I'm not  
Please don't throw away what we've got  
'Cause we've been together for way too long  
I was playing around but I'm coming home  
  
You know that I love you (know that I love you)  
There's no one above you (no one above you)  
I said it the last time (hey, hey)  
But this is the last time  
Don't make me over (don't leave me baby)  
'Cause I can be faithful (you know I try)  
Baby you're my number one (baby)  
You're my number one  
  
I keep you laced up so you ain't gotta borrow nothing  
From them broke ass friends who be bargain hunting  
They say they shop on eBay - baby why is they frontin'?  
They be on the internet but they never cop nothin'  
I keep you in Girl what is those on your toes?  
And your neck staying froze off that rose colored gold  
I suppose you was told by them hoes I was cheatin'  
Thinkin' my heart don't got nothing to do with my penis  
He got a mind of his own and he just be seeing shit  
And I don't want to cheat but I don't be saying shit  
I try to jack off he ask me who is you playin' wit?  
But I know he love you he told me you was his favorite  
  
You know that I love you (know that I love you)  
There's no one above you (above you)  
I said it the last time (said it the last time)  
But this is the last time (hey hey hey yeah)  
Don't make me over (don't leave me baby)  
'Cause I can be faithful (you know I try)  
Baby you're my number one (oh baby)

You're making it hard for me  
You're messing up everything  
You tell me I gotta leave

Left with a hangover

Say we over
