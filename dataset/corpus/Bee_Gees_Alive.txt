Maybe you talk too high, man.  
Maybe I talk too slow.  
But you've got to live a little bit faster  
'cause you've got a little less time to go.  
  
I ain't lost and I ain't searching.  
But then you know me very well.  
And I can't change the wind and make it blow the other way.  
I'm a fool and I can tell .  
  
That I'm alive and that's all.  
That I can get up just as fast as I fall.  
And I can walk and run but I'll never crawl.  
And in the end it doesn't matter at all.  
I don't know about the people that I read about in books.  
And the Kings and Queens around my room with their quiet dirty looks.  
I know I should be going somewhere, I just can't arrive .  
There's a reason for believing that I've never been alive , alive.  
  
I ain't lost and I ain't searching.  
But then you know me very well.  
And I can't change the world and make it go the other way.  
I'm a fool and I can tell.  
  
That I'm alive and that's all .  
That I can get up just as fast as I fall.  
And I can walk and run but I'll never crawl.  
And in the end it doesn't matter at all.  
I don't know about those people that I read about in books.  
And the Kings and Queens around my room with their quiet dirty looks.  
I know I should be going somewhere, I just can't arrive.  
There's a reason for believing that I've never been alive.  
I know I should be going somewhere I just can't arrive.  
There's a reason for believing that I've never been alive, alive, alive.
