Something real smooth  
Yeah, yeah  
Yeah  
We'll get into the groove  
Power of God move  
Something real smooth  
Something you need to take heed to  
  
A base-head cleaned up his act  
He stopped smoking crack and took his soul back  
Decided, he could find a much better way to live  
You know the way, positive  
Without all the negative chemicals and drugs  
Without all the hanging with the envious thugs  
Never before was a man so far behind  
And came back to rule for a long time  
Positive will explode when you light me  
My enemies lurked, and they held the dagger tightly  
Wanted to taste my blood, but they got scarred  
When they felt the power of God  
  
Wickedness got crushed when the Lord came  
Down with the King, cause he's evil and vain  
He doesn't understand the power of a ?  
Doesn't realize I'm rolling with a team  
Avenging angels will come and burn  
All those who saw, but refused to learn  
He has no color, no shape, and no form  
And like I told you before, I'm just getting warm  
Get up, get down, get on it, it ain't that hard  
You can feel the power of God  
  
Money is small and the soul stands tall  
All those who don't realize this, fall  
The mind of a drunken fool is a useless tool  
And it's cool to be in school  
And overcome and overpower, but still uplift  
Your mind is a gift  
You're somebody, whether you know it or not  
Outside the weather is hot  
People walk around with their minds in a daze  
Never take the time to stop and give praise  
You're lucky to live in this world  
Even the starving boys and girls  
Cause life is a gift in itself  
And only certain people are blessed with good health  
I'm Uncle L, but you can call me Todd  
I can feel the power of God  
  
You know I'm sayin  
And G is the seventh letter made  
Yeah  
G is the seventh letter made  
  
The power of God  
Yeah  
The babies, we gotta teach em, and hold em  
Send em to school, so we can teach em, and mold em  
Shape em, and make em take form  
Cause their mind is like a ball of clay when it's wet and warm  
Harmless and innocent  
Until they're taught to be violent, and militant  
This mentality gotta be erased by faith  
The 12th hour is coming, we're close to the 8th  
Get a chapter, and gain some knowledge  
If not from the Bible or Koran, get a book from college  
It's not about being black or white  
It's about everybody being a right  
I pulled out my mic, and the devil got hit hard  
He felt the power of God  
  
And G is the seventh letter made  
Power of god  
G is the seventh letter made  
  
That was just a word to the wise  
Up rise  
Cause we definitely gotta unify  
And we need unity in times like these  
We got to stick together  
Cause we as a people  
All people  
Gotta make it to the promised land  
Peace
