Walked out, goodbye  
I swore I never would cry  
Tore a page of my heart  
She wants me to be her friend  
I'm lonely again  
Tore a page of my heart  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, tell me who wrote the book of love  
Was it somebody from above (ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...)  
Surely he must know all the rules (ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...)  
Knowledge not meant for mortal fools  
Must have been someone from above  
Tell me, who wrote the book of love (oh, oh, oh, oh...whoa...)  
In silence the lonely make  
All their mistakes  
Tore a page of my heart  
Someone in heaven above  
Shop me how to love  
Tore a page of my heart...  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
