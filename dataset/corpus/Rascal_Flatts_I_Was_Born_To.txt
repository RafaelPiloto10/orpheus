Well I guess its in my genes  
Not in horoscopes or cosmic things  
These feelings run in my blood  
Always was and always is  
Comes on strong and it never quiets  
Never had to work that hard at love  
It ain't magic, know it's automatic  
You walk in a room  
Girl I gotta have it  
Cupid didn't even have to let an arrow go  
There was no love potion  
No walking on the ocean  
No miracle hat to break through  
If you wonder why I love you like I do  
Baby I was born too  
What everybody else calls a mystery  
Sure comes easy to me  
Yeah you might say I'm natural  
Well its got nothing to do with me  
It's all about you and the way you set me free  
To be the man who has it all  
It ain't magic, know it's automatic  
You walk in a room  
Girl I gotta have it  
Cupid didn't even have to let an arrow go  
There was no love potion  
No walking on the ocean  
No miracle hat to break through  
If you wonder why I love you like I do  
Baby I was born to love (love), give (give)  
Share everything that I'm feeling only with you  
It ain't magic, know it's automatic  
You walk in a room  
Girl I gotta have it  
Cupid didn't even have to let an arrow go  
There was no love potion  
No walking on the ocean  
No miracle hat to break through  
If you wonder why I love you like I do  
Baby I was born too  
If you wonder why I love you like I do  
Baby I was born too  
Oh
