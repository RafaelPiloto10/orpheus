I was minding my business  
Lifting some lead off  
The roof of the Holy Name church  
It was worthwhile living a laughable life  
To set my eyes on the blistering sight  
Of a Vicar in a tutu  
He's not strange  
He just wants to live his life this way  
  
A scanty bit of a thing  
With a decorative ring  
That wouldn't cover the head of a goose  
As Rose collects the money in a canister  
Who comes sliding down the bannister ?  
The Vicar in a tutu  
He's not strange  
He just wants to live his life this way  
  
The monkish monsignor  
With a head full of plaster  
Said : "My man, get your vile soul dry-cleaned"  
As Rose counts the money in the canister  
As natural as rain  
He dances again  
My God!  
The Vicar in a tutu  
Oh yeah  
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Oh...  
The Vicar in a tutu  
Oh yeah  
Oh...  
  
The next day in the pulpit  
With freedom and ease  
Combatting ignorance, dust, and disease  
As Rose counts the money in the canister  
As natural as rain  
He dances again and again and again  
  
In the fabric of a tutu  
Any man could get used to  
And I am the living sign  
And I'm a living sign  
I am a living sign  
I'm a living sign  
I am a living sign  
I'm a living sign  
Sign  
I am a living sign
