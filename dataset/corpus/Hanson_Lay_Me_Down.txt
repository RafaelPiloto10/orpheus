I'll never walk away from this  
I'll pull you closely to my chest  
With a fathers breaking heart  
I'll walk you one last time into the dark  
  
There are no reasons to explain  
A silent killer bears no blame  
There are no answers though I pray  
I die though this is not my grave  
  
And I lay you down  
Lay you down  
  
I'll carry you child to a place where you can rest  
Sweet tears that seep into the linens  
As I put you down to bed  
It tears me into pieces  
Watching you fight to fill your lungs with breath  
There's no need to struggle  
There's no need to struggle  
  
I lay you down  
Lay you down  
Don't you cry no more  
I'll lay me down  
Lay me down  
  
Well I'm not ready  
I'm not ready for this  
I'm not ready, I'm not ready for this  
  
There are no branches from this soil  
My broken spirit steals my voice  
I have no secrets to my name  
Only the shadows hide my shame  
And so if I lift you upon my shoulder  
Inside a splintered wooden chest  
To Avalon we line the streets  
I only hope that you'll finally rest  
  
I'm not ready for this  
I'll lay you down  
Lay you down  
Don't you cry no more  
I'll lay me down  
Lay me down  
I'd gladly lay me down  
Lay me down
