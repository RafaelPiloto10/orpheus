It's never right or wrong with you and me  
We're pure unconscious energy  
And I freeze as your charging through my mind  
That's what it's like with you and me  
(Were?)  
  
Then the spark ignites again  
And I'm electric  
Cause you and I were connected  
And then the stadium lights go on  
And we get hectic  
Cause you and I were connected  
  
To the light that shines in our eyes  
To the beat that's running our lives  
To the sound that's bringing us back again  
(Repeat)  
  
And I know you in and out and you know me  
There's not a thing you got to be  
And I see how your glowing from inside  
That's what it's like with you and me  
(Were?)  
  
Then the spark ignites again  
And I'm electric  
Cause you and I were connected  
And then the stadium lights go on  
And we get hectic  
Cause you and I were connected  
  
To the light that shines in our eyes  
To the beat that's running our lives  
To the sound that's bringing us back again  
(Repeat 2x)
