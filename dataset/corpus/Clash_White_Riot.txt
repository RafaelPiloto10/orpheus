White riot - I want to riot  
White riot - a riot of my own  
White riot - I want to riot  
White riot - a riot of my own  
  
Black people gotta lot a problems  
But they don't mind throwing a brick  
White people go to school  
Where they teach you how to be thick  
  
An' everybody's doing  
Just what they're told to  
An' nobody wants  
To go to jail!  
  
All the power's in the hands  
Of people rich enough to buy it  
While we walk the street  
Too chicken to even try it  
  
Everybody's doing  
Just what they're told to  
Nobody wants  
To go to jail!  
  
Are you taking over  
Or are you taking orders?  
Are you going backwards  
Or are you going forwards?
