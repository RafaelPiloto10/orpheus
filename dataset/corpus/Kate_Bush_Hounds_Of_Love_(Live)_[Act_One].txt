[Intro: Bertie McIntosh]  
"It's in the trees  
It's coming"  
  
[Verse 1: Kate Bush]  
When I was a child, running in the night  
Afraid of what might be  
Hiding in the dark, hiding in the street  
And of what was following me  
Now hounds of love are hunting  
I've always been a coward  
And I don't know what's good for me  
  
[Chorus 1: Kate Bush]  
Here I go  
It's coming for me through the trees  
Oh, help me, someone, help me, please  
Take my shoes off  
And throw them in the lake  
And I'll be two steps on the water  
  
[Verse 2: Kate Bush]  
I found a fox, caught by dogs  
He let me take him in my hands  
His little heart, it beats so fast  
And I'm ashamed of running away  
From nothing real, I just can't deal with this  
But I'm afraid to be there  
Among your hounds of love  
And feel your arms surrounding me  
I've always been a coward  
And never know what's good for me  
  
[Chorus 2: Kate Bush]  
Here I go , don't let me go  
Never let me go, tie me to the mast  
It's coming for me through the trees  
Oh, help me, darling, help me, please  
Take my shoes off  
And throw them in the lake  
And I'll be two steps on the water  
  
[Bridge: Kate Bush]  
I don't know what's good for me  
I don't know what's good for me  
I need love, love, love, love, love, yeah  
Your love  
  
[Chorus 3: Kate Bush]  
Take your shoes off and throw them in the lake  
Do you know what I really need?  
Do you know what I really need?  
I need love, love, love, love, love, yeah
