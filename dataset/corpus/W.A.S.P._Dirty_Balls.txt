I wanna ride you  
Like the animal you are  
I wanna ride you til you're raw  
I wanna slide up all inside  
All over you  
I wanna do you like  
The wicked bitch you are  
Call me a bastard  
A real bad attitude  
Shove it in their faces  
Show my dirty ooh  
  
I'm gonna do you like  
The savages you are  
I wanna do ya til you die  
I'm gonna ride 'em cowboy style  
For all to see  
Make 'em all my bitches  
Take 'em all and make 'em cry  
Oh am I nasty?  
Do you think I'm rude?  
I just wanna see ya'  
Hold my dirty ooh  
  
Dirty balls, balls, balls  
Is all I need  
Hang 'em high oh tonight  
So the world can see  
Dirty - balls, balls, balls  
Is all I need  
So dirty oh Lord a' mercy  
All I want to see  
  
I'm gonna hold, gonna hold em'  
High, high, high  
So dirty, oh so dirty oh  
Til I die, die, die
