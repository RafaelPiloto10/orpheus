I don't want to put another thought  
In my head.  
  
The hummingbird is cleared for  
Maintenance,  
Evacuating long after it made no sense.  
It's not so much a load and stay any more  
As a gotta-get-down-the-road-before-the-  
Temperature-soars.  
  
I don't want to put a little thought  
In your head.  
  
Diplomacy goes even better with drinks  
(Until the big city trees began to shrink.)  
It's not so much a load out and stay  
Anymore  
It's gotta get down the road before the  
Snarling traffic roars.  
  
I don't want to ask you,  
'What you got in your head?'  
I'm not gonna ask you  
A whole bunch of questions.  
  
OK, we agree to disagree....  
Giving up....Giving Up the Embassy  
Is a whole lot better than,  
The Embassy's Surrendering.  
  
Flying home under the approval of the stars,  
I couldn't be more at home with the way  
Things are so hard.  
It's not so much a load-out  
And stay anymore  
Its a gotta get down the road before  
The confetti cannon blows  
With litigious force.  
  
I don't want to ask you,  
'What you got in your head?'  
I don't want to ask you,  
'Whatcha been thinking?'  
  
I don't want to put another  
Thought in my head.  
  
I don't want to put another  
Thought in my head.
