I hit the highway  
Touch life barely sixteen  
No angel of mercy  
Coming down to save the soul of me  
  
I took a Greyhound limousine  
Straight to grand central NYC  
It was ass, gas, or grass, living fast  
Nobody rides for free  
  
[Chorus]  
Living it up, giving it up  
Living in the valley of lost souls  
Wanting it all, taking the fall  
Living in the valley of lost souls  
  
Miss Misery come ride me  
How I love her company  
She did Boston justice  
And wronged all the right out of me  
  
The devil wears a black suit  
He says I'm livin' like a bum  
So what I'm looking like I'm half dead  
A gypsy on the run  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Feels like time's running out on me  
But I wasn't born to play nobody's fool  
Ain't nobody gonna hold me down to play nobody's fool  
Ain't nobody gonna hold me down  
I've gotta roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll  
  
Somebody save me
