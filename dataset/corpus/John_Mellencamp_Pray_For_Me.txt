Written by John Mellencamp  
  
God gave Moses a few little rules  
And he said I want you to pass them around  
Take a look at those old tools  
I can't believe the shit that's going down  
You're supposed to have a good time  
But I think you take it a little too far  
Watchin' your life in vista-vision  
A monkey on your back, a brand new car  
  
Well Shakespeare threw down his pencil,  
Said I think I'm gonna start layin' brick  
Too much of this Romeo stuff enough to make  
Anybody sick  
"To be or not to be," I mean what's that supposed to mean  
I'm changin' my image tomorrow  
Be a groupie, make the scene  
  
Chorus:  
Pray for me if you want to  
If you don't want to don't stay  
Somebody shot the Vicar and the minister's on his way  
Sellin' open legs on the corner  
Punchin' Judy workin' uptown  
Pray for me if you want to  
Before some fool shoots you down  
  
The man in the cage is always for freedom  
The way of the transgressor is hard  
Cain and Abel and their old man  
Playin' croquet in the back yard  
Two guys beat up the sole survivor  
Up beat on the back street  
I don't really want to get involved  
Won't someone help me to my feet.  
Chorus
