Like a blue bird with his heart removed, lonely as a train  
I've run just as far as I can run  
If I never see the good old days shinin' in the sun  
I'll be doin' fine and then some  
  
[Chorus]  
How long, how long  
Woman will you weep  
How long, how long  
Rock yourself to sleep  
  
Well I been doin' time in lonesome prison, where the sun don't shine  
Just outside, the freedom river runs  
Out there in that shiny night, with blood hounds on your mind  
Don't you know it's the same sad situation?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everybody feels alright you know, I heard some poor fool say (Somebody Ooooo)  
Everyone is out there on the loose  
Well I wish I lived in the land of fools, no one knew my name  
But what you get is not quite what you choose  
  
Tell me, how long, how long  
Woman will you weep  
How long, how long  
Rock yourself to sleep  
  
How long, how long (long and drawn out)  
Muddy River runs so deep  
How long, how long (long and drawn out)  
Good night baby, rock yourself to sleep,  
Sleep tight baby, rock yourself to sleep,  
Be-be-be Bye bye baby, Rock yourself to sleep
