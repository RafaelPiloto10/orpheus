You've seen him leaning on the streetlight  
Listening to some song inside  
You've seen him standing by the highway  
Trying to hitch a ride  
  
Well, they tried so hard to hold him  
Heaven knows how hard they tried  
But he's made up his mind  
He's the restless kind  
  
He's the wild age  
He's the wild age  
He's the wild age  
Wild age  
It's the wild age  
And the law can't stop 'em  
No one can stop 'em  
At the wild age  
  
Mostly when the reckless years end  
Something's left to save  
Some of them keep running  
'Til they run straight in their graves  
To stay the wild age  
Stay the wild age  
Stay the wild age  
Wild age...
