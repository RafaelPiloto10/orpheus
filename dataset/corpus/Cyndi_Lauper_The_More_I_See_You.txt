Each time I look at you is like the first time  
Each time you're near me the thrill is new  
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for  
The rare delight of the sight of you for  
  
The more I see you, the more I want you  
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows  
With every sigh I become more mad about you  
More lost without you and so it goes  
  
Can you imagine how much I love you?  
The more I see you as years go by  
I know the only one for me can only be you  
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try  
  
I know the only one for me can only be you  
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try
