If you love somebody  
Better tell them why they're here 'cause  
They just may run away from you  
  
You'll never know what went well  
Then again it just depends on  
How long of time is left for you  
  
I've had the highest mountains  
I've had the deepest rivers  
You can have it all but not til you move it  
  
Now take it in but don't look down  
  
'Cause I'm on top of the world, 'ey  
I'm on top of the world, 'ey  
Waiting on this for a while now  
Paying my dues to the dirt  
I've been waiting to smile, 'ey  
Been holding it in for a while, 'ey  
Take it with me if I can  
Been dreaming of this since a child  
I'm on top of the world  
  
I've tried to cut these corners  
Try to take the easy way out  
I kept on falling short of something  
  
I coulda gave up then but  
Then again I couldn't have 'cause  
I've traveled all this way for something  
  
Now take it in but don't look down  
  
'Cause I'm on top of the world, 'ey  
I'm on top of the world, 'ey  
Waiting on this for a while now  
Paying my dues to the dirt  
I've been waiting to smile, 'ey  
Been holding it in for a while, 'ey  
Take it with me if I can  
Been dreaming of this since a child  
I'm on top of the world  
  
'Cause I'm on top of the world, 'ey  
I'm on top of the world, 'ey  
Waiting on this for a while now  
Paying my dues to the dirt  
I've been waiting to smile, 'ey  
Been holding it in for a while, 'ey  
Take it with me if I can  
Been dreaming of this since a child  
  
And I know it's hard when you're falling down  
And it's a long way up when you hit the ground  
Get up now, get up, get up now  
  
And I know it's hard when you're falling down  
And it's a long way up when you hit the ground  
Get up now, get up, get up now  
  
'Cause I'm on top of the world, 'ey  
I'm on top of the world, 'ey  
Waiting on this for a while now  
Paying my dues to the dirt  
I've been waiting to smile, 'ey  
Been holding it in for a while, 'ey  
Take it with me if I can  
Been dreaming of this since a child  
I'm on top of the world
