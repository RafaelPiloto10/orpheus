Beyond the sunset, O blissful morning  
When with our Saviour heaven's begun  
Earth's toiling ended, O glorious dawning  
Beyond the sunset when day is done.  
  
Beyond the sunset, no clouds will gather  
No storms will threaten, no fears annoy  
O day of gladness, O day unending  
Beyond the sunset eternal joy.  
  
Beyond the sunset, a hand will guide me  
To God the Father whom I adore  
His glorious presence, His words of welcome  
Will be my portion on that fair shore.  
  
Beyond the sunset, O glad reunion  
With our dear loved ones who've gone before  
In that fair homeland we'll know no parting  
Beyond the sunset forever more...
