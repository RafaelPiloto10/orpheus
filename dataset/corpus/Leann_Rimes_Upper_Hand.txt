Honey on a teaspoon  
Sugar in a bowl  
An eager man's always an easy catch  
Butter on the skillet  
Whiskey in a glass  
To start a flame you've got to light a match  
  
Ooh you got what he wants  
You got what he wants  
ooh  
  
[Chorus:]  
Got to get a hold, got to get a hold get a hold of your man  
Better get him while, better get him while better get him while you can  
Good to be a lion, good to be a lion instead of a lamb  
Use what you got take the upper hand  
  
Always be a lady  
But tease him like a tramp  
A temptation that's hard to resist  
Treat him like a hero  
  
Let him long to be your slave  
Take advantage of your God given gift  
  
Ooh you know what he wants  
You know what he wants  
ooh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Generations before will testify it's true  
Girl your gonna see how much he really loves you  
  
[Chorus]
