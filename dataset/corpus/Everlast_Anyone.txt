[Verse 1]  
I got my pick up truck, and I got my gun, and I got a taste for whiskey and
pills.  
I know I'm kinda far, cause I'm my father's son and I got a hole in my heart I
cant fill  
Turn off the parking light, down by the rivers end.  
This is my darkest night girl you're swimming in my head  
  
[Chorus 1]  
It happens all the time, I blow it every time  
People change with time  
Call me anytime girl  
I miss you oh so often  
Whats been said is done  
Its my only option girl ill be anyone for you.  
Anyone.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Out on the interstate, I play my radio  
And I confess to all my sins  
Been driving seven hours, still got 3 to go  
Where it always ends, the road begins  
You've got your broken wings  
I've got mine sewn apart  
Girl all these fucked up things  
They keep us torn apart  
  
[Chorus 2]  
It happens all the time  
I blow it every time  
People change with time  
Call me anytime you like  
I miss you oh so often  
Whats been said is done  
Its my only option  
Ill kill anyone for you.  
  
Anyone  
Anywhere  
Anytime  
  
For you
