Ah ah ah  
Ah ah human  
  
I been lookin' in the mirror somethin's  
Gettin' clearer wonderin' who am I  
Just a chemical solution caught in evolution  
Only livin' to survive  
  
Or am I just another lifetime lookin' for a lifeline  
Cryin' when the sun don't shine  
Am I runnin' through the ghetto maybe I should  
Let go of all the dreams inside  
  
But who am I to reach so high  
And who am I to raise my eyes  
Want to live I want to die  
I can't do anything I'll tell you why  
  
I'm the one who took a walk on the moon  
And I made the seven wonders too  
There is nothin' that I cannot do  
Cause I am human  
  
There is nothing that I cannot be  
I'm the one who sailed the seven seas  
And I know that it is all in me  
Cause I am human  
  
The blood that's runnin' through my veins  
It tells me I'm the same as  
All the other ones gone by  
In the air that I am breathin'  
Emotions that I'm feelin'  
Underneath the same blue sky  
  
And I know if I believe it, then I can achieve it  
Nothin's standin' in my way  
Then maybe history will make a place for me  
And I'll be livin' for that day  
  
But who am I to reach so high  
And who am I to raise my eyes  
Want to live I want to die  
I can't do anything I'll tell you why  
  
I'm the one who took a walk on the moon  
And I made the seven wonders too  
There is nothin' that I cannot do  
Cause I am human  
  
There is nothing that I cannot be  
I'm the one who sailed the seven seas  
And I know that it is all in me  
Cause I am human  
  
Not born to make mistakes, not born to fade away  
Not only livin' to survive  
Don't tell me I am nothin'  
Know that I am somethin'  
Brother, don't ya realize  
  
I'm the one who took a walk on the moon  
And I made the seven wonders too  
There is nothin' that I cannot do  
Cause I am human  
  
There is nothing that I cannot be  
I'm the one who sailed the seven seas  
And I know that it is all in me  
Cause I am human  
  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
I'm the one, I am human  
  
Oh, yeah  
Ah ah ah  
Ah ah human
