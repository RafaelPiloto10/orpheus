Check out some memories I don't recognise  
Another country and another life  
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
I find I'm strolling on a distant shore  
To meet someone I've never seen before  
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh  
Chorus:  
I'm wearing someone else's clothes again  
Walking in the streets I know again  
Back in the old familiar glow again  
I'm wearing someone else's clothes  
Painting quiet pictures in my ear  
We're driving past without a wish to steer  
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
Driving underneath the deep blue sea  
I'm always surfacing in summer sheets  
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh  
(Chorus)  
(Chorus)  
Transfer me into a Saturday crowd  
Or merge me back into a factory town  
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
I'm opened up for such a splendid move  
I'm making ??? with someone, I don't know who  
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh  
(Chorus)
