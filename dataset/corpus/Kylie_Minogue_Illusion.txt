A situation's taken over me  
Can't you see  
I'm in trouble?  
Infatuation's got a hold on me  
A little jealously  
I'm not myself at all  
  
I'm surrounded by confusion  
And I'm lost in this illusion  
  
You serenade me at the ball  
Hiding from it all  
Behind a disguise  
Who's the man who's at the masquerade?  
Wish I hadn't stayed  
Just to drown in lies  
  
Like the headline of a magazine, are you what you seem  
Because I'm losing my belief?  
Can I make it when there's so much doubt  
Someone, help me out 'cause I'm in too deep  
  
I'm surrounded by confusion  
And I'm lost in this illusion  
  
Follow my dreams into distant lands  
Blowing in the winds over shifting sands  
  
I'm in too deep  
  
I'm surrounded by confusion  
And I'm lost in this illusion  
I'm surrounded by confusion  
I'm so lost in this illusion
