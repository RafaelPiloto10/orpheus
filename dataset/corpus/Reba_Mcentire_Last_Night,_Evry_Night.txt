I watch you as you wake and rub your eyes and try to hide them from the  
  
Morning sun  
I whisper how ya doing and you smile and say so tenderly good morning  
Hun  
  
[Chorus]  
Last night you made his memory fade a little  
You helped me see how love can still be right  
I wish you didn't have to leave  
If you just knew how much I need  
Last night, ev'ry night  
  
I know you have to catch a plane to Memphis  
And you mentioned it's an early flight  
You start to pack  
And while I comb my hair  
I stare at you and think about last night  
  
Cause [Chorus]  
  
I slip into my robe to go make coffee  
You come in and pull me close to you  
And as I feel your tender kiss  
I whisper can't Memphis wait a day or two  
Cause [Chorus]  
  
Cause [Chorus]
