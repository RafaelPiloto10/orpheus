Strange, the view from here  
Words we spoke, forgotten at the time  
Now replay in my mind  
What went wrong, what was right  
Looking back, I never was there for you  
You didn't say, but I know it's true  
  
I can't find the real world alone  
Every time I think I've won  
I hear your voice inside, questioning  
Where have you gone  
Can't you remember feeling so alone  
You always had the answer that I could not see  
  
I can't find the real world  
I can't find the real world  
I can't find the real world alone  
I can't find the real world  
I can't find the real world  
I can't find the real world alone
