I keep my secrets locked up tight  
I keep my emotions out of sight  
But you got me memorized  
What's in my heart, what's behind my eyes  
You hold me tight, you hold me fast  
Won't let go until the storm has passed  
When I finally break down I'm so in love  
I ain't afraid to ask, I am not afraid, no  
Baby, love me out, love me out of this world  
No alibis, no more regrets  
You're my wayward angel  
You're my saving grace  
Sanctify my crazy head  
You're there inside me, in my dreams  
Sexy poems, cinematic scenes  
Shattered lullabies unfold  
Sweet suggestions I have never known  
Pull down the shade, turn off the light  
Oh, my love were all alone tonight  
Shadow dancing in slow-mo  
For your eyes I will let it show  
You can feel me glow  
Oh, baby, love me out, love me out of this world  
No alibis, no more regrets  
You're my wayward angel  
You're my saving grace  
Sanctify my crazy head  
Maybe it's heaven or your sweet suggestion  
Holding me in your sway  
Carried away in the arms of an angel  
You are my saving grace  
Baby, love me out, love me out of this world  
No alibis, no more regrets, oh  
You're my wayward angel  
You're my saving grace  
Sanctify my crazy head  
Oh, baby, love me out now, love me out of this world  
No alibis, no more regrets, no more regrets  
You're my wayward angel  
You're my saving grace  
Sanctify my crazy head, oh, ooh
