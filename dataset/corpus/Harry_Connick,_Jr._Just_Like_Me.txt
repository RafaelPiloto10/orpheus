It's three o'clock in the morning  
I'm wonderin' what to do to save the sun  
The space that I take  
Is more than I can give  
And Lorelei's song has just begun  
  
I'm gonna turn my head  
Time eternity  
I'm gonna find somebody  
Just like me  
  
Everybody's pretty  
My brother won't rest 'til he knows I'm home  
The choices I make  
Are easier supposed  
As my surviving striving not to roam  
  
I'm gonna stand my ground  
Make my guarantee  
I'm gonna find somebody  
Just like me  
  
The world keeps spinning  
Mountains vary but the valley's the same  
The confidence I feel  
As I balance on the ridge  
Comes from the trueness of my aim  
  
I'm gonna walk this road  
As far as I can see  
I'm gonna find somebody just like me  
I'm gonna find somebody just like me
