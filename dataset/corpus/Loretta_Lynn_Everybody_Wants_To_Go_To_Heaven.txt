Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die  
Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die  
Once upon a time there lived a man and his name was Isaac  
He walked with God both day and night but he didn't wanna die  
He cried oh Lord please let me live death is close I know  
God smiled down on Isaac and gave him fifteen years to go  
Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die  
Lord I wanna go to heaven but I don't wanna die  
So I long for the day when I'll have new birth still I love the livin' here on
earth  
Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die

When Jesus lived here on this earth he knew his father's plan  
He knew that he must give his life to save the soul of men  
When Judas had betraied him her father heard him cry  
He was brave until his death but he didn't wanna die  
Everybody wants to go to heaven...  
Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die
