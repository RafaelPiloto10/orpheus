They're really rockin' in boston, pittsburgh, pa,  
Deep in the heart of texas and 'round the frisco bay.  
All over st. louis, 'way down in new orleans,  
All the cats gonna dance with sweet little sixteen.  
Sweet little sixteen, she's just got to have  
About a half a million signed autographs.  
Her wallet's filled with pictures, she gets 'em one by one,  
She gets so excited, watch her, look at her run.  
Oh mommy, mommy, please may I go ?  
It's such a sight to see somebody steal the show.  
Oh daddy, daddy, I beg of you,  
It's all right with mommy, it's all right with you.  
'cause they'll be rockin' on bandstand, in pittsburgh, pa  
Deep in the heart of texas, 'way down in frisco bay.  
All over st. louis, 'way down in new orleans,  
All the cats gonna dance with sweet little sixteen.
