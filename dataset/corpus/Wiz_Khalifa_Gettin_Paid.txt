We blowin' money bitch  
I go hard, I go hard, gettin' paid  
I go hard, I go hard, gettin' paid  
  
We don't even count the money no more we just blow it  
(We spend it all up)  
We don't even count the money no more we just throw it  
And make 'em pick it all up  
  
Money strapped to my waist  
Somewhere in the whip I'm in with no bass  
Flooded the trap I need a new place?  
Money got to go I told 'em there's no space  
Never love hoes, hoes I don't chase  
Only wear loc's the same as my race  
All I know is stunt, make a hater feel like shit to the point  
That he in another place? Real talk  
I-I-I ain't the one but I lean on haters, looking so clean on gator  
Try to jack me, I guarantee I'll put the beam on haters  
Hood nigga, when I come to this I'm stocked up  
Shit on my wrist tryna light this block up  
Nigga said I got a dope man swag, take a look at these jewels  
Every one of 'em rocked up  
And we still on the corner packed in  
Ace town president somethin' back then  
Hope the slut that I'm with got insurance so  
She know I'm about to run up on her back end  
Like I set of bad, she was gettin' plugged  
Can take it to the streets, take it to the club  
I don't rubber band shit I got trash bags  
Niggas make it rain, I'ma make it flood  
I ain't gonna talk shit I'ma talk bread  
I f a hater don't like it, tell 'em drop dead  
I'm in the hood like a fresh set of projects  
Where they either rock blue or they rock red  
I'm the king of the streets  
Ain't nobody finna take away what I came to get  
Audi R8 that I came is sick, with interior the color of a all white?  
  
We don't even count the money no more we just blow it  
(We spend it all up)  
We don't even count the money no more we just throw it  
(And make 'em pick it all up)  
We don't even count the money no more we just blow it  
(We spend it all up)  
We don't even count the money no more we just throw it  
(And make 'em pick it all up)  
  
Big weed in my joint, diss me there's no point  
Lil guy but still all my n-ggas got big heat they on point  
Rollin up while I drive, engine be in the trunk  
Decided in 2005 that I can fuck any bitch that I want  
Ooh, and, and and I ain't trying to stunt  
This a two seater my bitch can't help but ride up in the front  
Ballin' most n-ggas wont try to pick 'em up  
Throwin' so much money you even try to pick some up  
You tryin' different stuff look at how I block 'em out  
Smoke like a Cali nigga even when I'm in the south  
And when when my car come out the whores come out  
Don't even get on twitter no more  
'cause I'm what your bitch talkin' 'bout  
  
We don't even count the money no more we just blow it  
(We spend it all up)  
We don't even count the money no more we just throw it  
(And make 'em pick it all up)  
We don't even count the money no more we just blow it  
(We spend it all up)  
We don't even count the money no more we just throw it  
(And make 'em pick it all up)
