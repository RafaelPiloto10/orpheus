My eggs in one basket, but she threw me a bone  
She was dealt a full deck, but she likes to live alone  
Ain't just talkin' to myself, need a reason to stop (oh yeah)  
With a flower in her teeth, she drained the last drop  
I said girls love money like bees the honey  
  
But lonely is the hunter, you're my one and only, and lonely is the hunter  
  
Asked her for a refill, sweat flew off my face (oh yeah)  
She's a legendary figure, kept me in a cage  
She's a torture chamber, when I seduced her in my bed (ooh yeah)  
She gave a cold reading, success went to her head  
  
In the heat of the battle the heart cannot rule, I'm such a fool  
  
But lonely is the hunter, you're my one and only, and lonely is the hunter  
Lonely is the hunter, you're my one and only, and lonely is the hunter  
  
Lonely is the hunter, you're my one and only, and lonely is the hunter  
Lonely is the hunter, you're my one and only, and lonely is the hunter
