This old house is fallin' down around my ears  
I'm drowning in the river of my tears  
When all my will is gone, hold me sway  
I need you at the dimming of the day  
  
You pulled me like the moon pulls on the tide  
You know just where I keep my bad side  
  
For days have come to keep us far apart  
A broken promise or a broken heart  
Now all bonny birds have wheeled away  
I need you at the dimming of the day  
  
Come the night, you're only what I want  
Come the night, you could be my confidant  
  
I see you on the street and company  
Why don't you come and ease your mind with me?  
I'm living for the day we steal away  
I need you at the dimming of the day  
I need you at the dimming of the day
