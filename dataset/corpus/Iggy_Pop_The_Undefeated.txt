I was gently raised  
Fussed over r in school  
Fed and housed and entertained  
Wanting to be cool  
Summers in the grass  
Winters warm and slow  
Until the one thing on my mind was to just  
Get up and go  
  
We're the undefeated  
We got what they want  
We're so bored and spoiled  
Life is just a bag of pot  
We're the undefeated  
TV in the shade  
Girls at all our parties  
We have really got it made  
  
There's a real mean world outside  
Where many lives are lost  
But struggle builds character  
And we are growing soft  
I don't want to sit and watch no TV show  
I want to roam and be challenged  
I want to grow and grow  
  
We're the undefeated  
We got what they want  
We're so fucking spoiled  
Life is just a bag of pot  
We're the undefeated  
TV in the shade  
Girls at all our parties  
We have really got it made  
What have we made?  
A giant jail  
A bunch of walls  
That's all that we've made  
Oh, my  
  
We're the undefeated we got what they want  
We're so bored and spoiled life is just a bag of pot  
We're the undefeated we got what they want  
We're so bored and spoiled life is just a bag of pot  
  
We're the undefeated  
Always undefeated  
We're the undefeated  
We're the undefeated,  
Now
