Whoa, I need you.  
Baby, baby, baby don't you know

You knew my lips were lonely for, the kisses you could give to me.  
Ever since the first day, baby, that we met.  
  
So if you say you're mine and let our hearts combine.  
I swear I'll never let you forget how much  
  
I love you.

Darling, darling  
Oh, darling  
  
Whoa, whoa  
Come home, come home, come home, come home.  
Can't you see that I need it.  
Bring it home to me, baby.  
Come home, come home, come home, come home.
