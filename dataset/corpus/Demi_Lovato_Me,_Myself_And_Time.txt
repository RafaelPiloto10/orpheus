I can make the rain stop if I wanna,  
Just like my attitude  
I can take my laptop record a snapshot  
And change your point of view  
  
I just entered this brand new world  
And I'm so open hearted  
I know I've got a long way to go but I  
I'm I'm just getting started  
  
I'm over my head, and I know it, I know it  
I'm doing my best not to show it, to show it  
Whatever it takes to be what I was meant to be, I'm going to try  
'Cause I'm living the dream and I know it, I know it  
I'm trying my best not to blow it, to blow it  
And I know everything will be fine  
With me, myself and time.  
  
I go where life takes me,  
But some days it makes me want to change my direction  
Sometimes it gets lonely,  
But I know that it's only a matter of my perception  
I just entered this brand new world  
And I'm so open hearted  
I know I've got a long way to go but I'm  
I'm just getting started  
  
I'm over my head, and I know it, I know it  
I'm doing my best not to show it, to show it  
Whatever it takes to be what I was meant to be, I'm going to try  
'Cause I'm living the dream and I know it, I know it  
I'm trying my best not to blow it, to blow it  
And I know everything will be fine  
With me, myself and time.  
  
And baby there is nothing like this moment  
To just be real and let the truth be spoken  
Whatever's broke I can make it unbroken  
Turn the lead in my hand into something golden  
Just try more love, if I try more love then I'll find  
Myself and time.  
  
I'm over my head, and I know it, I know it  
I'm doing my best not to show it, to show it  
Whatever it takes to be, what I was meant to be, I'm going to try  
  
I'm over my head, and I know it, I know it  
I'm doing my best not to show it, to show it  
Whatever it takes to be, what I was meant to be, I'm going to try  
'Cause I'm living the dream and I know it, I know it  
I'm trying my best not to blow it, to blow it  
And I know everything will be fine  
With me, myself and time.  
  
I'll find myself in time,  
I know I'll find myself in time
