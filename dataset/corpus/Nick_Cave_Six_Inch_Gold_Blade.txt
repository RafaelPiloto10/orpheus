I stuck a six inch gold blade inside the head of a girl  
She: lying through her teeth  
Him: lying on his back  
Hands of this one,hands off she cried  
Grinning at me from hip to hip  
Hands off, pretty baby, tough blood then so soft to slip  
Ooohh yeah  
I stuck a six inch gold blade in the head of a girl  
Sharks fun slices suger-bed slices that pretty red-head  
I love you! now me! I love you!  
Laughter, laughter  
Oh baby, those skinny girls, they're so quick to murder  
Ooohhh yeah.  
Shake it baby, c'mon, shake, shake it baby
