We came from the far North  
Summered in Crimea  
Deserted the armed forces  
Had to disappear  
Made it to the free West  
On a chartered flight  
So we could see what  
We trained to fight  
  
We were in London  
Lets do it, lets break the law!  
We were in London  
Tell it like it is  
We were in London  
Tell it like it is  
  
Looking for hard work  
Or credit card fraud  
What do you expect from us?  
We come from abroad  
To get ourselves a new job  
On a building-site  
They work you so hard  
But we trained to fight  
  
We were in London  
Lets do it, lets break the law!  
We were in London  
Tell it like it is  
We were in London  
Lets do it, lets break the law!  
We were in London  
Tell it like it is  
  
My father fought in Afghanistan  
His widows pension ain't worth a damn  
My mother works and goes home to cry  
I want to live before I die  
  
We were in London  
Lets do it, lets break the law!  
We were in London  
Tell it like it is  
We were in London  
Tell it like it is
