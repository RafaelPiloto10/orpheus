Lay still, Steven, and I'll tell you a bedtime story.  
I'll tell you a bedtime story that's not for all  
Children. It's a very special story, that only special  
Children will understand. It's a half-awake story, and  
It will be better if you close your eyes. It's a  
Story that takes place in a dream, like other  
Nightmares you have known. It's a dream that Alice has  
Dreamed. You can dream along with him. You can follow  
Alice down the staircase, deep, down the stairs to the  
Pit where he doesn't want to go, but he has to.  
  
If you go to sleep now, Steven, you can go down the  
Long and endless stairway and sing sweet songs to Alice  
And free him. And if you can't get to sleep, Steven,  
And in the middle of the night you get out of bed, when  
Everything is quiet and the trees are still and the  
Birds are hiding from the dark, you can lie down on  
Your bedroom floor and press your ear tightly to the  
Boards. If you listen very carefully you can hear  
Alice searching for a way out, forever chasing  
Rainbows.  
  
Sleep tight, Steven. And have a good night.
