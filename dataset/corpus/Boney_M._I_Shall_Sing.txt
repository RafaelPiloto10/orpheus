I shall sing, sing my song  
Be it right, be it wrong  
In the night, in the day  
Anyhow it's out a sight  
  
I shall sing  
La la la la la la la la  
With my heart, with my soul  
For the young, for the old  
  
When I'm high, when I'm low  
When I'm fast, when I'm slow  
I shall sing  
I shall sing, sing my song  
  
Be it right, be it wrong  
In the day, in the night  
Anyhow it's out a sight  
I shall sing  
La la la la la la la la  
  
I shall sing, sing my song  
I shall sing, sing my song  
I shall sing, sing my song  
  
Be it right, be it wrong  
In the day, in the night  
Anyhow it's out a sight  
I shall sing  
La la la la
