I see all the snowflakes, falling down around me  
Falling down, lovely and wide  
And all of these snowflakes, falling down around me  
Seem so perfect, so right  
Look at them tambling down, each one is a flame  
All of them spining me, daslinly the same  
See how they flow and bend  
Swirling in neverending harmony  
They glisten as they decent,  
Sparkling like diamonds all the way  
To me it is crystal clear  
I'm not how they appear, shivering out here at my own  
See how different I am, I'm not one of them  
I'm alone
