Starlit night  
The moon is shining bright  
You are the one I need  
Up at your window  
I see a shadow  
Silhouette of your grace  
Here's this flower  
I picked for all the hours  
That you've spent with me  
The one I love  
That I've been dreaming of  
Sailing across the sea  
  
[Chorus]  
Let my hands flow through  
Your hair, moving closer  
A kiss we'll share  
Passionate love to be all night long  
We'll never break, as one too strong  
  
Nothing's more  
Than what our love is for  
As I kiss your cheek  
Oh so softly  
Hands flowing down my back  
One thousand hours, I'll never leave  
Our romance  
Is a love trance  
And now we'll never part  
One thousand hours  
Of such a love shower  
We'll never stop once we start  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Strong
