Girl, before you go now  
There's one thing I wanted to do  
That's get you to come back  
Because I want to make love to you  
  
Got me real turned on  
Yes, you have  
  
But there's something in your eyes  
Telling me you have to go  
Something in your eyes  
But you're trying not to let it show  
  
Got me real turned on  
  
Next time you come over  
I'll buy you a bottle of wine  
Just take a little drink  
And everything will turn out fine  
Yes, it will  
  
Whoa baby, do you know  
What I've got in mind  
Can you guess what it is  
Or do you want it on the line  
  
Got me real turned  
Got me real turned  
Got me real turned  
Got me real turned on
