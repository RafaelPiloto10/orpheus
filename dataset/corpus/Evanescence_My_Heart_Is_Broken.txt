I will wander 'til the end of time, torn away from you  
  
I pull away to face the pain  
I close my eyes and drift away  
Over the fear that I will never find  
A way to heal my soul  
And I will wander 'til the end of time  
Torn away from you  
  
My heart is broken  
Sweet sleep, my dark angel  
Deliver us from sorrow's hold  
Or from my hard heart  
  
I can't go on living this way  
And I can't go back the way I came  
Shamed of this fear that I will never find  
A way to heal my soul  
And I will wander 'til the end of time  
Half a life without you  
  
My heart is broken  
Sweet sleep, my dark angel  
Deliver us, change, open your eyes to the light  
I denied it all so long, oh so long  
Say goodbye, goodbye  
  
My heart is broken  
Release me, I can't hold on  
Deliver us, my heart is broken  
Sweet sleep, my dark angel  
Deliver us, my heart is broken  
Sweet sleep, my dark angel  
Deliver us from sorrow's hold
