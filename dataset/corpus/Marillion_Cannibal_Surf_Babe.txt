(Let's meet up and get beat up)  
  
Well she tied me to the headboard with a surf leash  
And her wet hair hugged her body like a long-lost friend  
And I really tried my best to get across to her  
But nothing she would say could be defended  
  
Well her birthday suit it was her only present  
When I looked into her eyes - no history  
And I told her eating people wasn't pleasant  
But she laughed a snake eye laugh and walked away from me  
  
And I watched her as she walked across the coals  
I watched her as she walked across the coals  
  
Singing: I was born in nineteen sixty weird  
And I'm your nightmare surfer babe  
Mr. Wilson where's your sandbox and your beard  
'You still looking for the perfect microwave?  
  
So I really did my best to get across to her  
I said: "One day every pebble hits the beach"  
And I kissed her face and held her like a long-lost friend  
But she was too far out there to be reached  
To be reached  
She was too far out there  
  
She was singing: I was born in nineteen sixty weird  
I'm your nightmare surfer babe  
Mr. Wilson where's your sandbox and your beard  
'You still looking for the perfect microwave?  
  
And the sun came up over the mountain  
And the waves rolled in across the bay  
And the fabulous brightly-coloured birds flew up out of the forest  
And she said "Well we're all heaven's beautiful children living together in
paradise  
Lie down my dear... you're going to enjoy this"  
  
And she looked like she'd had sex  
With a Tyrannosaurus Rex  
  
Singing: I was born in nineteen sixty weird, old man  
I'm your nightmare surfer babe  
Mr. Wilson where's your sandbox and your beard  
'You still looking for that perfect microwave?  
Perfect microwave  
  
And I watched her as she walked across the coals...  
  
And the sun came up over the mountain  
And the waves rolled in across the bay  
And the fabulous brightly-coloured birds flew up out of the forest  
And she said "Well we're all heaven's beautiful children living together in
paradise  
Lie down my dear... you have enjoyed this"
