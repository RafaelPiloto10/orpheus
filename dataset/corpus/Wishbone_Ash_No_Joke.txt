Blue skies in my rear-view mirror,  
Well, I've got you on my mind.  
Road sign says I'm getting nearer,  
And now it's just a matter of time.  
Well, now I get to wonder,  
Do you take me for a fool?  
Do I have to take a number  
And wait in line  
Just to get to you?  
You got the time, I got the money -  
This ain't workin' at all.  
It's no joke, and it ain't funny -  
I think I'm losing control.  
Like tumbleweed that's blowin' free  
You change direction with the wind.  
We both know that this may never be  
Nothing more than someplace to begin.
