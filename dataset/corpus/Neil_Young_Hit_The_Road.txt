She looks so beautiful, with the top down  
Let's jump inside and take a trip to town  
  
(Let's hit the road) Let's make some miles and spend a little time  
(And go to town) And when we get there we'll stop our only dime  
  
(Let's hit the road) And go to town  
(Let's hit the road) And go to town  
  
On the freeway in the middle of the commute  
Bumper to bumper in a giant cloud of fumes  
  
(Let's hit the road) From city to city everyone is on the move  
(And go to town) Try to find the energy to stay in the groove  
  
(Let's hit the road) And go to town  
(Let's hit the road) And go to town  
  
When I'm rolling on those big round wheels  
Puts me in heaven that's exactly how I feel  
  
Just jump inside and turn the key  
Your satisfaction is guaranteed  
  
(Let's hit the road) And go to town  
(Let's hit the road) And go to town  
  
Someone's tryin' to find the peoples fuel  
No fear of failure for that crazy fool  
  
(Let's hit the road) (And go to town)  
(Let's hit the road) (And go to town)  
  
(Let's hit the road) And go to town
