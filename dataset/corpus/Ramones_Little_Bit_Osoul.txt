Now when you're feelin' low  
And the fish won't bite  
You need a little bit o' soul  
To put you right  
You gotta make like you  
Want to kneel and pray  
And then a little bit o' soul  
Will come your way  
  
Now when your girl has gone  
And you're broke in two  
You need a little bit o' soul  
To see you through  
And when you raise the roof  
With you rock and roll  
You'll get a lot more kicks  
With a little bit o' soul  
  
And if your party falls  
Cause there's nobody groovin'  
A little bit o' soul and  
It really starts movin', yeah!  
  
Now when you're in a mess  
And you feel like cryin'  
Just remember this little  
Song of mine  
And as you walk through life  
Tryin' to reach your goal  
Remember what I say 'bout  
A little bit o' soul  
  
And if your party falls  
Cause there's nobody groovin'  
A little bit o' soul and  
It really starts movin', yeah!  
A little bit o' soul  
A little bit o' soul  
A little bit o' soul
