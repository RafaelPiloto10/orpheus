(just born to be your baby. ..  
Just born to be. ..)  
  
Some people are born to be doctors,  
Some are born to be lumber jacks  
Some are born just to take life easy  
Others are born to break their backs!  
  
But I'm just born to be your baby  
Just born to love you baby,  
It's true. ..  
Nobody else will do!  
  
(just born to be your baby. ..  
Just born to be. ..)  
  
Some people will kiss and nothin' happens  
Other hearts are made of stone  
But whenever I feel our lips meet  
Somethin' starts crawlin' all through my bones!  
  
'cause I'm just born to be your baby  
Just born to love you baby,  
It's true. ..  
Nobody else will do!  
  
(just born to be. ..)  
  
If now an' then you start to wonder  
Will I be the perfect mate?  
Don't you worry my purdy little darlin'  
It was all arranged by fate!  
  
'cause I'm just born to be your baby  
Just born to love you baby,  
It's true. .. (it's true, it's true!)  
Nobody else will do!  
  
(just born to be your baby. ..  
Just born to be. ..)  
  
Some people will search for love a lifetime  
Some never feel love in their hearts  
But I was born with a silver spoon  
I had your love'a right from the start!  
  
Yes! I'm just born to be your baby  
Just born to love you baby,

Just born to be your own!)

Yes! I'm just born to be your baby  
Just born to love you baby,  
It's true. .. (it's true, it's true!)  
Ah. .. Nobody else will do!
