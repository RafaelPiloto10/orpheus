It's too late  
This model's out of date  
Got every spare part  
But there ain't much heart inside here  
Not like the start  
I was good at the art of survival  
I've always tried  
To keep my troubles deep inside  
Where I can hide them  
now I'm open wide  
  
When it ends  
Again I'll see my friends  
They'll give me a lift  
I've been running adrift, so easy  
Shifting the gear  
I got nothing to fear from the showdown  
I'll go down quiet  
And kids downstairs making a hell of a din  
I'm all alone  
Getting a quote for the wages of sin  
  
Beyond the indigo, indigo  
Where the chilly winds, winds will blow  
My time is running low  
Going to cross the dark dark river  
Going to see my good life-giver  
Better cover my yellow liver  
  
Alright,  
I'm giving up the fight  
I didn't know when  
I'd be a stranger again  
In my own land  
The days are O.K.  
But oh how I hate those long nights  
You understand  
Darling please, just hold my hand  
You feel so warm  
In the eye of the storm  
I'm going away, I'm going away, I'm going away  
See you again someday  
Darling, I'm going away  
Feel like I'm going away, this time I'm going away
