Praise god I say, praise god each day.  
He helped me to overcome  
I remember once I couldn't get out of bed  
So I sing and say, yeah.  
  
Lying in bed got nothing to do  
No one to rub my head  
Playing my guitar my only friend  
Its gonna last me till the end  
Don't wanna land it  
Wanna get out instead  
I wanna feel free with activity.  
  
Above my bed bob face us all  
Looking at me so passionately  
Well in his eyes I saw the truth  
The truth of a rastaman  
The truth of a higher man.  
  
To the bridge  
Don't wanna land it  
Wanna get out instead  
I wanna feel free with activity  
Well I got lots and lots of company yeah  
Alot of good vibes flowing around me  
Nurses coming and wondering, o god  
Is this really Ziggy Marley.  
  
Lying in bed got nothing to do  
No one to rub my head  
Strumming my guitar my only friend  
Its gonna last me till the end  
  
Above my bed bob face us all, my daddy  
Looking at me so passionately, lil brother  
Well in his eyes I saw the truth, my name  
The truth of a rastaman  
The truth of a higherman.  
  
Rastafari no, I n I give praises  
I n I thank jah for, his health  
If it was not for him  
What would I, what would I've done  
So I say amen.  
  
Don't wanna land it  
Wanna get out instead  
I wanna feel free with activity  
Don't wanna land it  
Wanna get out instead  
I wanna feel free with activity  
Don't wanna land it  
Wanna get out instead  
I wanna feel free with activity
