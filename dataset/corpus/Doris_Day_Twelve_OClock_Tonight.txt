Twelve o'clock tonight  
(Twelve o'clock tonight)  
Meet me at the door  
(Meet me at the door)  
  
I'll kiss you goodnight  
(I'll kiss you goodnight)  
Once more (once more)  
  
Then I'll go to bed  
(Gotta go to bed)  
Busy day ahead  
(Busy day ahead)  
  
But I know instead  
(But I know instead)  
I'll walk the floor  
(Walk the floor)  
  
Since I've been with you  
Can't concentrate  
Want to stay up light  
Baby, I'll wait for you  
  
Then I'll hold you tight  
(Then I'll hold you tight)  
Til the sun is bright  
(Til the sun is bright)  
  
Meet me at the door (for sure)  
At twelve o'clock tonight  
(Twelve o'clock tonight)  
  
Twelve o'clock tonight  
Mmm, middle of the night  
Not a soul in sight  
To interfere with our love  
  
Teacher may scold  
Mama may call  
But if we're quiet  
Down in the hall  
  
I'll be hugging you tight  
(I'll be hugging you tight)  
Twelve o'clock tonight  
  
Twelve o'clock tonight  
Twelve o'clock tonight  
Twelve o'clock tonight
