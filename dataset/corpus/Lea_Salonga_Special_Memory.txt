You will always be a special part of me  
You will always be a special memory  
I'll always cherish wonderful moments  
You have given me  
You are in my heart wherever I may be  
  
All the times we shared will always be to me  
Songs my heart will sing refreshing melodies  
I'll put together all of your laughter  
Like a symphony  
I'll remember you wherever I may be  
  
I'll put together all of your laughter  
Like a symphony  
I'll remember you wherever I may be  
  
I'll remember you wherever I may be  
I'll remember you wherever I may be
