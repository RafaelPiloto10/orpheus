You call me from a phone booth with tears in your voice  
Tell me you've been out all night runnin' with the boys  
You say you're cold and tired and lonely  
And you got no place to go  
There wasn't any phonebook  
Mine's the only number that you know  
  
Well call yourself a taxi and I'll pay 'I'm at the door  
If you don't mind sleepin' on the sofa or on the floor  
And I spend an hour hatin' you  
'Til the cab pulls in  
My heart has found another way  
To be loving you again  
  
And every time is the last time  
And every time is the first  
Everytime is the last time with you  
Oh it never gets no better  
And it couldn't get no wore  
  
Then I hear the footsteps the driver's at the door  
He says I look familiar has he made this run before  
And I tell him I don't think so  
What's it matter anyway  
Just tell me what the meter reads  
And I'll go and get your pay  
  
Well now it's down to you and me though it don't seem right  
We both know where we'll be and what we'll do tonight  
And after an hour or two  
When the night comes to an end  
My heart has found another way  
To be lovin' you again  
  
And every time is the last time  
And every time is the first  
Everytime is the last time with you  
Oh it never gets no better  
And it couldn't get no worse  
  
I know that there should be more to say I'll just reed your mind  
Let's save what's left unsaid for another time  
'Cause I know there'll be another time  
So until then  
My heart has found another way  
To be lovin' you again  
My heart has found another way  
To be lovin' you again  
Oh, my heart has found another way  
To be lovin' you again
