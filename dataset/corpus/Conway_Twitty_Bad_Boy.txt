Everyday your husband goes to work from nine to five  
Wakes up in the morning and puts on his coat and tie  
Sits down at the table with some coffee and the news  
"Two eggs over easy," girl, that's all he says to you  
The kids are all in school now and you sit home alone  
Spendin' all your time down it the basement a-washin' clothes  
Somehow this just ain't the way you dreamed love would be  
I can look into your eyes and tell just what you need.  
  
You need a bad boy  
To love you up and down  
A bad boy  
To take you on the town  
It's plain to see what you need's  
A little bit of mystery  
You need a bad boy  
A bad boy like me.  
  
Every night at six o'clock he walks on through the door  
Lays down on the couch and throws his shoes off on the floor  
Tonight was gonna be the night he took you to a show  
Now he's much too tired and he doesn't wanna go  
Once again you spend the night in front of the TV  
In bed you turn to touch him but he's already asleep.  
  
You need a bad boy  
To love you up and down  
A bad boy  
To take you on the town  
It's plain to see what you need's  
A little bit of mystery  
You need a bad boy  
A bad boy like me  
Bad boy
