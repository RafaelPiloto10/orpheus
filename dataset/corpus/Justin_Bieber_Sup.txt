Verse 1:  
I'm in the club, shaking it up  
And I see your face  
I get a drink, hope it's luck Hope  
I'm not a disgrace  
A little word is all I gotta say  
So say it now, go on then  
Because he's getting away  
  
Bridge: I'm looking at you But is this right?  
Maybe I'm in for a treat  
Or a surprise Should  
I say it or not  
Oh my gosh  
  
Chorus:  
I just wanna say sup, sup, sup, sup  
You represent a dove, dove, dove, dove  
Say how you doing  
Let's get to it  
I just want to say sup, sup, sup, sup  
You represent a dove, dove, dove  
As nice as sugar  
You are my lover  
I just wanna say sup, sup, sup  
  
Verse 2:  
I talk to my friends  
He is cute  
Well go on then, talk to him  
But I'll probably mute  
Walk over  
I'm waiting This game  
When am I gonna start playing?  
  
[Bridge:]  
[Chorus:]  
Verse 3: Go say it now I'm waiting

Go say it now, go say it  
Go say sup now, yeah
