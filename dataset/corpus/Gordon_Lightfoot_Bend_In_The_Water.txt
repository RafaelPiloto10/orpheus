Come on Pearl, come on Kitty,  
If you feel inclined  
Down around the bend in the water,  
Bring your fishin' line  
Come on Pearl, I'm rough and ready,  
Got my fishin' pole  
Down around the bend in the water  
To the fishin' hole  
  
It's a fine July on a beautiful night  
With a heavenly sky and moonlight on the bay  
  
Down around the bend in the water,  
If you feel inclined  
Come on Pearl, come on Kitty,  
I'm gonna make you mine  
  
All around the world tonight  
What a beautiful scene below  
Too fine a time to stand in line  
I'm gonna take my love to go  
It's a fine July and a beautiful way  
For a boy and a girl to pass the time of day  
  
Come on Pearl, come on Kitty,  
If you feel inclined  
Down around the bend in the water,  
Bring your fishin' line  
  
All around the world tonight  
What a beautiful sight below  
Too fine a time to stand in line  
I'm gonna take my love to go  
It's a fine July on a beautiful light  
With a heavenly sky and moonlight on the bay  
  
Down around the bend in the water,  
If you feel inclined  
Come on Pearl, come on Kitty,  
Bring your fishin' line  
Come on Pearl, I'm rough and ready,  
Got my fishin' pole  
Down around the bend in the water  
To the fishin' hole
