This world doesn't need no opera, we need it for the operation  
We don't need a bigga knife (a bigga knife)  
Cuz we got guns, we got guns, we got guns (we got guns)  
We got guns, you betta run (Ya betta run, ya betta run, ya betta run)  
  
We're killin' strangers, we're killin' strangers  
We're killin' strangers, so we don't kill the 1s that we love  
We're killin' strangers, we're killin' strangers  
We're killin' strangers, so we don't kill the 1s that we love  
  
We pack demolition, we can't pack emotion  
Dynamite? We just might...  
So blow us a kiss, blow us a kiss  
Blow us a kiss, we'll blow you to pieces  
  
We're killing strangers, we're killing strangers  
We're killing strangers, so we don't kill the ones that we love  
We got guns,  
We got guns,  
  
Mother fuckers  
better, better, better run  
We got guns, we got guns  
Mother fuckers better run  
We got guns, we got guns  
Mother fuckers better, better, better run  
We got guns, we got guns  
Mother fuckers better run  
  
We're killing strangers, we're killing strangers  
We're killing strangers, so we don't kill the ones that we love  
We're killing strangers, we're killing strangers  
We're killing strangers, so we don't kill the ones that we love, love, love,
love  
  
You better run  
Cause we got guns! Cause we got guns! We got guns!
