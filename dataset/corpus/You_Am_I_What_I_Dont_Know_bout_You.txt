This whole day was useless  
Next one's gonna be worse  
'cause I'm wearing this badge of fortune like  
A criminals wears a curse  
I want to chase that rabbit right off the rails  
And rip this metal keeping my mouth in check  
But I need that muzzle like a razor and a stubble  
Cuttin all this history from my neck  
Do you remember the gear I first saw you in  
Eating Mexican in '92?  
In between your folks and a birthday toast  
It was black from your fringe to your shoes  
I'm picking apples out of paintings  
And making record covers in the sky  
I missed my boat sitting here imagining  
Your face when you cry  
  
Don't be cruel, come on be sugar in my tooth  
I think I like what I don't know about you  
  
This whole day threw up some tickets  
None I'd ever choose  
The sky's so heavy it hangs like a beer gut  
Spilling stuff on my shoes  
Don't get me wrong, I ain't complaining  
I still got my legs like an old Christmas tree  
But if I got faith why am I so scared  
Everybody's dying on me  
  
Don't be cruel, come on be sugar in my tooth  
I think I like what I don't know about you  
Don't be cruel, come on be champagne in my shoe  
I think I like what I don't know about you  
  
Fish and chips stall down the south coast ready  
I can show you what I'm worth  
So set me up a bottle and salt and vinegar  
If you get there first  
I said if you get there first  
  
Don't be cruel, come on be sugar in my tooth  
I think I like what I don't know about you  
Don't be cruel, come on be champagne in my shoe  
I think I like what I don't know about you
