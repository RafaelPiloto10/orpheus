While I'm far away from you my baby  
I know it's hard for you my baby  
Because it's hard for me my baby  
And the darkest hour is just before dawn  
  
Each night before you go to bed my baby  
Whisper a little prayer for me my baby  
And tell all the stars above  
This is dedicated to the one I love  
  
Life can never be  
Exactly like we want it to be  
It makes me happy  
Just knowing that you love me  
There's one thing I want you to do  
Especially for me  
And it's something that everybody needs  
  
Each night before you go to bed my baby  
Whisper a little prayer for me my baby  
And tell all the stars above  
This is dedicated to the one I love
