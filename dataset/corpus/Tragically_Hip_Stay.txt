You did the best that you could do.  
You were a great crew,  
Who tried to nurture and preserve your faith in you.  
And with the bureau chiefs and the shrugging spies  
You could stay, but why.  
  
You see a light and then another  
And everything you fought for naught's uncovered.  
You're not a fighter, you're a lover.  
You got no business in here, brother  
So, stay.  
Stay.  
  
Is it the worst that you could do?  
You were a great you,  
Who tried to nurture and preserve your faith in you  
And with the bureau chiefs and the shrugging spies  
You could stay and why.  
Cause you see a light and then another.  
Everything you thought you sought's uncovered.  
You're a fighter and a lover  
And there's no one up above her  
So, stay.  
Stay.  
  
All things being balanced, it's balanced and called balancing  
Somewhere beyond everything it's being balanced  
Not for the sake of balance  
But balancing between the throes of learning  
And the entire thing  
Entirely  
Balancing.
