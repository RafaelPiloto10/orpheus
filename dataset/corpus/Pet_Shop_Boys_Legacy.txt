That's it, the end  
But you'll get over it, my friend  
  
Time will pass, governments fall  
Glaciers melt, hurricanes bawl  
High-speed trains take us away  
North or south and back the same day  
  
And you, you'll get over it  
You do, you get over it  
  
Seasons will change, more or less  
Species vanish, art perplex  
Resentment remain both east and west  
Police expect an arrest  
  
For now, you'll get over it  
Somehow, you'll get over it  
  
You'll be there, the king over the water  
In despair, recoiling from the slaughter  
  
They're raising an army in the North  
From York Minster to the Firth of Forth  
A pilgrimage of grace, you won't believe it  
Such a human face when you receive it  
  
And you will get over it  
With time to kill, you'll get over it  
  
There's a cruiser waiting at Scapa Flow  
To take you away from all you know  
The old man agonised  
He really has compromised  
  
Public opinion may not be on your side  
There are those who think they've been taken for a ride  
You'll get over it, I'm on your side because  
You'll get over it, and what a ride it was!  
  
Tout les artistes dans le monde  
Chantent pour toi ce soir  
Tout les artistes dans le monde  
Chantent pour toi c'est noir  
  
It's dark, but you'll get over it  
On your mark, you'll get over it  
  
That Carphone Warehouse boy has been on the phone  
He wants to upgrade the mobile you own  
Have you realized your computer's a spy?  
Give him a ring, he'll explain why  
  
The bourgeoisie will get over it  
Look at me, I'm so over it  
And you, you'll get over it!  
You do, you get over it in time
