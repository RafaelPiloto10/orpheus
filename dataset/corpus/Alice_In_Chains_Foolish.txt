I can't believe that once again  
I can't believe I under  
Stand  
I can't believe that once again  
I can't believe I almost  
Stand  
  
I felt the fool  
Shamed by the truth  
  
I see the ones I took alive  
I see the hate within my  
Life  
I breed the ones I knew I could  
I breed the ones who always  
Knew  
  
I felt the fool  
Shamed by the truth  
And I see (I see)  
Reasons for feeling your rules  
  
I felt the fool  
Shamed by the truth  
And I see (I see)  
Reasons for feeling your rules  
  
I can't believe it once again  
I can't belive I under  
Stand  
I can't believe it once again  
I can't believe I almost
