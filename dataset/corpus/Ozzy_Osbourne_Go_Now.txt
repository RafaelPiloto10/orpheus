We've already said goodbye  
Since you gotta go, oh you better  
Go now, go now, go now, go now  
Go, before you see me cry  
I don't want you to tell me just what you intend to do now  
'cause how many times do I have to tell you darlin',  
I'm still in love with you now  
Whoa-oh-oh-oh  
  
We've already said so-long  
I don't wanna see you go, oh you better  
Go now, go now, go now, go now  
Don't you even try  
Tellin' me that you don't want me to end up this way  
'cause darlin', darlin', can't you see I want you to stay, stay  
  
We've already said goodbye  
Since you gotta go, oh you better  
Go now, go now, go now, go now  
Go, go!  
  
I don't want you to tell me just what you intend to do now  
'cause how many times do I have to tell you darling,  
I'm still in love still in love with you now  
  
I don't wanna see you go but darling, you better go now
