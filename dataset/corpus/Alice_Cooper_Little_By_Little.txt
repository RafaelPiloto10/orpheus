Black leather gloves and your lipstick shines  
Bright as moonlight glows  
My wildest rose cuts so fine and deep  
It hurts but never shows  
You're bad, you're so hardcore  
Pull me down here on the killing floor  
  
[Chorus:]  
Little by little we cross the line  
Little by little the ties that bind  
Little by little by little by little  
Little by little tonight  
  
Your sugar tongue speaks hot and sweet  
Lying just for fun  
Push and shove  
Sex is sex  
But honey, love is love  
We're not sick insane  
Just another lovers' game  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm all undone  
My pretty one  
Don't slap my face  
Unless you kiss me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You beg and you cry for more  
You pull me down here on the killing floor  
  
[Chorus]
