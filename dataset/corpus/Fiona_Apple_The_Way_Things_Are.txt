I wouldn't know what to do with another chance  
If you gave it to me  
I couldn't take the embrace of a real romance  
It'd race right through me  
I'm much better off the way things are  
Much much better off, better of by far, by far  
I wouldn't know what to say to a gentle voice  
It'd roll right past me  
And if you chalk it up you'll see  
I don't really have a choice  
So don't even ask me  
I'm much beter off, the way tings are  
Much much better off, better by far  
  
So keep on calling me names, keep on , keep on  
And I'll keep kicking the crap 'til it's gone  
And I'll keep on killing,  
You could get me to settle  
And as soon as I settle,  
I bet I'll be able to move on  
  
How can I fight, when we're on the same side  
How can I fight beside you  
  
So keep on calling me names, keep on, keep on  
And I'll keep kicking the crap 'til its gone  
If you keep on killing  
You could get me to settle  
And as soon as I settle  
I bet I'll able to move on
