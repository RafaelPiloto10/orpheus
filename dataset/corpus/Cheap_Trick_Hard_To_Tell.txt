I've had enough, I'm tired of waiting  
The time has come to pass  
Why do you do what you do to me  
Why can't you say what you want to say  
  
Is it not worth investigating  
I thought (i'd been harassed)  
Why do you go if you want to stay  
How will I know what you mean to say  
Undoubtedly I'm all over you  
  
[Chorus]  
It's not that easy baby  
It's not that hard to tell  
It's not that easy baby  
Life is hell but I'm doing fine.  
It's hard to tell  
  
I'm not good at contemplating  
The odds are it won't last  
Why do you do what you do to me  
When will I hear what I want to hear  
  
Been so long anticipating  
You put me to the test  
Why won't you say what you want to say  
How will I know if you mean to stay  
Undeniably I'm all over you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We'll now preside to file  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
It's hard to tell  
I do it well  
It's hard to tell  
Hard to tell
