And the man who would be Santa slips into the room  
And the hour of daylight's yet to come, but he hopes they don't wake too soon  
All the presents wrapped in paper and tied with a bow  
The children sleep upstairs and Santa works below  
And he can hear the children dreaming  
  
Oh, la la la, la la la  
Ah, la la la, la la la  
  
[Chorus]  
And he says  
All I want is for you to have  
A life you love and live  
Take from me all I have to give  
Because you are in my heart  
  
And the man who would be Santa tells his son to write  
And to call him if he needs him in the middle of the night  
Don't you worry don't you cry now you'll do just fine  
Your mother and I love you  
We think about you all the time  
And he can see the train is leaving  
  
Oh, la la la, la la la  
Ah, la la la, la la la  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now the old man sits and tells of days when time stood still  
The hours always seem to fade but the memory never will  
And all the love that you gave me  
And all the dreams in the night  
And I just want to thank you while the day's still light  
But I can see the sun is setting  
  
Oh, la la la, la la la  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
You are in my heart
