Way back, and if you find out again  
I'll never leave you home  
If I could well I'd be there breathing in  
What you need is home  
Noooo! I meant when it counted all to play  
I don't care  
But I can see  
That underneath  
Your building right in front of me, I  
Might - take - you - home  
But if I could, well I'll know you're not afraid  
Of what you hear in the tone  
If you heard of the church not following,  
That I'll never take you home  
Noooo! I will, while you're calling out to me  
But l don't fly  
But what I can see  
Could help be  
You'll build it up, you'll fall in free, I  
Might - take - you - home  
But if you could, why I know you're not alone  
But if what you need is home  
But if I could well I'd be there for yet again  
I'll never take you home  
Noooo! I left you with calling out to me  
But I don't see  
But I can't breathe  
Lower than  
Your building right in front of me, I  
Might - take - you - home
