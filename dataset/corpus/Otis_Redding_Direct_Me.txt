I done cried a river of tears  
This you may not believe  
But I've been crying for five long years  
Afraid of all my fears  
  
Love has got me now  
In a terrible bet  
I done lost the best little woman  
That I ever had  
  
So direct Me  
Straight to my baby's love  
Direct Me  
Straight to my woman's love  
  
Shame on me shame on me  
I made a big mistake  
When I see my babe again  
I'm gonna bake me her favorite cake  
  
Ten thousand dollar reward  
For the first the one that finds her  
When I get my hands on her, y'all  
I'm gonna just chain and bound her  
  
Somebody direct Me  
Straight to my baby's love  
Direct Me  
Straight to my woman's love, ou, ou  
  
Deputy sheriff On your trail  
The FBI, I know,  
They won't fail, they can't fail  
They gonna bring you back  
  
Somebody direct Me  
Straight to my baby's love  
Direct Me  
Straight to that woman's love  
  
I got the feeling  
I want to feel it, y'all  
Say I gotta feeling girl  
Lord, I want to feel it, now, now  
I really do, really do, really, really  
I really do  
Ou wi, I need your love, now  
Needda your lovin' now  
Somebody direct me, now
