Laugh with me, buddy  
Jest with me, buddy  
Don't let her get the best of me, buddy  
Don't ever let me start feeling lonely  
If I ever needed you, buddy  
You know how I really do, buddy  
Don't ever let me start feeling lonely  
  
I cry at the least little thing, buddy  
And I'll die if you mention her name, buddy  
Talk to me, buddy  
Stay with me, buddy  
Let's don't let her get away, buddy  
Don't ever let me start feeling lonely  
  
Let's talk about things as they were, buddy  
Before I got mixed up with her, buddy  
Laugh with me, buddy  
Jest with me, buddy  
Let's don't let her get the best of me, buddy  
Don't ever let me start feeling lonely
