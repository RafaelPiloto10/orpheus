I'm goin out on the highway  
Listen to them big trucks whine  
I'm goin out on the highway  
Listen to them big trucks whine  
  
White freight liner  
Won't you steal away my mind  
Ah, New Mexico ain't bad, Lord  
And the people there they treat you kind  
And the people there they treat you kind  
  
Well, it's bad news from Houston  
Half my friends are dying  
Well, it's bad news from Houston  
Half my friends are dying  
  
Ah, Lord, I'm gonna ramble  
Till I get back to where I came  
Ah, Lord, I'm gonna ramble  
Till I get back to where I came  
  
I'm goin out on the highway  
Listen to them big trucks whine  
I'm goin out on the highway  
Listen to them big trucks whine
