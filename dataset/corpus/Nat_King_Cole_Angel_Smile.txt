I never thought that I could find  
(Angel smile) Heaven on Earth  
And peace of mind (angel smile)  
Someone to love me all the time  
(Angel smile) oh, whoa, oh, oh  
  
And then I saw your angel smile  
It made my heart start jumping  
And my nerves start running wild  
(You made my nerves start running wild)  
  
I been to dances by the score  
(Angel smile) I never cared  
To dance before (angel smile)  
But there I was on the ballroom floor  
(Angel smile) oh, oh, whoa, oh  
  
It only took your angel smile  
To make the music move me  
And my feet start running wild  
(You made my feet start running wild)  
  
What chases the blue  
When I am low (angel smile)  
What gives me that tender  
Loving glow (angel smile)  
And what will I always cherish so  
(Angel smile) oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
And when I see your angel smile  
I dream of you there beside me  
As we both walk down the aisle  
(You make me feet walk down the aisle)  
  
What chases the blue  
When I am low (angel smile)  
What gives me that tender  
Loving glow (angel smile)  
And what will I always cherish so  
(Angel smile) oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
And when I see your angel smile  
I dream of you there beside me  
As we both walk down the aisle
