The firt step to heaven  
I will take in my life  
I am not afraid when  
I can hold you tight  
If there must be an answer  
Then there must be a prayer  
And you must be the angel  
When you're standing there  
So I lean on you, I lean on you  
  
My life is such a statement  
Of my hopes and despairs  
But nothing really matters  
Just as long as you're there  
You love me such honesty,  
You love with no gain  
You speak to me so tender  
And you never explain  
So I lean on you, I lean on you  
My baby she cares  
It's so easy to do  
My baby she tells me what to do  
She always tells me the truth  
My baby she cares  
It's so easy to do  
My baby knows what I'm gonna do  
That's why I lean on you  
  
I dream of an island,  
Of a fantasy place  
Where I can go to sometimes  
And no one can trace  
Well such is the nature,  
The nature of love  
That when we dream it  
Sometimes means that we need love  
So I lean on you, I lean on you  
My baby she cares  
It's so easy to do  
My baby she tells me what to do  
She always tells me the truth  
My baby she cares  
It's so easy to do  
My baby knows what I'm gonna do  
That's why I'm gonna lean on you  
  
So I lean on you, I lean on you  
I lean on you, so I lean on you  
my baby she cares, it's so easy to do  
my baby knows what I'm gonna do,  
that's why I'm gonna lean on you  
whooo oooh oooh oooh(repeat chorus)  
my baby she loves me  
whooo oooh oooh
