I thought I felt you touch my cheek this mornin'  
But I must'a been dreamin'  
And in the middle of the night with out a warnin'  
I thought I heard you breathin'  
Me and my so-called independence  
I've got this loneliness that's so relentless  
  
[Chorus]  
I guess you get used to somebody  
Kind of like havin' them around  
I guess you get used to the way they make you happy  
Bring you up when you're feelin' down  
I never dreamed when I was letting you go  
That I would wake up and miss you this much  
I guess you get used to somebody  
I guess you get used to bein' loved  
  
I kinda miss those ramblin' conversations  
Where we talked about nothin'  
The way you always made me laugh at my frustrations  
Baby, that was somethin'  
I should've been careful what I wished for  
Cause I've got my freedom and so much more  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I never dreamed when I was letting you go  
That I would wake up and miss you this much  
I guess you get used to somebody  
I guess you get used to bein' loved
