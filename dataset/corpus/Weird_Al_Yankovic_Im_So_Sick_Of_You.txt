You tell a joke and forget the punchline  
Why you always wastin' my time?  
Hey baby, trust me, you just disgust me  
Your hair's a mess and your make-up's crusty  
  
I don't know too many females  
Who make a habit of biting their toenails  
Wo, every time you call, you drive me up the wall  
Honey, just the sight of you makes my flesh crawl  
  
I'm sure we'd be happy together  
If only one little thing weren't true  
Oh baby, I yi yi yi yi  
I'm so sick of you  
  
You drink the milk right from the carton  
What are you, in kindergarten?  
You're belchin' everywhere, foulin' up the air  
Then you use my razor to shave your back hair  
  
You don't have an ounce of class  
You're just one big pain in the neck  
How much more can I take now  
Give me a break now  
  
You even snore when you're wide awake now  
You tell all your friends we're the perfect couple  
Well, maybe you should get a clue  
'Cause baby, I yi yi yi yi  
  
I'm so sick of you  
Baby, you're so nauseatin'  
I yi yi yi yi  
I'm so sick of you  
  
And when you softly call my name  
It's like I'm listenin' to a squeaky chalk sound  
And when you look at me that special way  
It's hard for me to keep my lunch down  
  
And when you ask me what I'm thinkin', honey, usually I'm thinkin'  
How I'd really like to tie your head completely up in duct tape  
So I wouldn't have to listen to you asking me those stupid questions  
Over and over again  
  
Well, that disgusting noise you make when you laugh  
Gives me a throbbing migraine  
(Can't stand you, I just can't stand you)  
Until you came along, I never dated anyone this low on the food chain  
  
(Can't stand you, I just can't stand you)  
You've got inhuman body odor  
You've got the hair of a boxing promoter  
Yeah, your teeth are all yellow, your butt's made of Jell-O  
  
You wake up in a puddle, droolin' on your pillow  
I hate the way you crack your knuckles  
I hate your whiny loser girlfriends too  
But mostly I yi yi yi yi  
  
I'm so sick of you  
Really now, you're aggravatin'  
I yi yi yi yi  
I'm so sick of you  
  
Not to mention irratatin'  
I yi yi yi yi  
I'm so sick of you  
Well, now won't you give my best regards to Satan  
  
I yi yi yi yi  
I'm so sick of you  
  
I'm so sick of you  
I'm so sick of you  
I'm so sick of you  
You make me sick  
I'm so sick of you, now....
