I live a perfect lie  
All I ever want lies forgiven  
Took away all of those chains and say  
They broke away, they broke away  
  
Do you lead a better life  
Even when the sweet turns to bitter  
Took away all of our chains and said  
They broke away, they broke away  
  
Walking round outer space  
Knowing that you've had a taste  
Walking round and out of place  
And knowing what you're gonna do  
To break down those chains  
I can't tell you  
Took away all of our chains and say  
Broke away, they broke away  
  
Got away with my ambition  
Only if I want it  
Only if I don't  
Took away all of those chains and say  
They broke away, they broke away  
  
Walking round and out of place  
Knowing that you've had a taste  
Walking round out of place  
Nothing what you're gonna do  
To break out on me  
I can't tell you  
Took away all of your chains and say  
They broke away, they broke away  
  
And knowing what you're gonna do  
To break down those chains  
I can't tell you  
Take away all of those chains and say  
They broke away, they broke away
