It came on like a hurricane  
And I don't understand  
And it moved me  
Like a slow dance  
  
Still I don't understand  
It pushed me like a tailwind  
And I don't understand  
And it came in  
  
Through the back door  
And I don't understand  
Still I don't understand  
You're all that I could need  
And I'm falling on my knees  
  
Hurricane  
You pulled me out of the past  
And landed me in today  
Hurricane  
  
You pulled me out of the past  
And walked me into tomorrow  
Hurricane  
  
It picked me like a cherry  
And I don't understand  
And it killed me with the craving  
Still I don't understand  
It thrilled me to starvation  
  
And I don't understand  
And it stripped me ugly naked  
And I don't understand  
Still I don't understand  
  
You're all that I could be  
And I'm falling on my knees
