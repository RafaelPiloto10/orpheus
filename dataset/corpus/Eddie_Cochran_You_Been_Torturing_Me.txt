I'm gonna stomp you on the top of your foot  
And hang you from a big long fishing hook  
And drop you plunge to the bottom of the sea, hey-hey  
Let the sharks eat you all up  
If them mean old whales don't interrupt  
Cos baby you know how you been torturing little ol' me  
Hey-hey  
  
I'm the judge, the jury too  
Judgement has been brought upon you  
You been convicted for the crime you've done  
You made me feel like a little ol' crumb  
You know it's wrong to torture me  
You love my friends the same way you love me  
And like Tom, I don't wanna hang from a big oak tree over you  
When I say hop, I mean make like a frog  
And when I say bark, you better sound like a dog  
Cos I'm gonna torture you  
The same way you been torturing little ol' me, hey-hey  
Stop torturing me baby
