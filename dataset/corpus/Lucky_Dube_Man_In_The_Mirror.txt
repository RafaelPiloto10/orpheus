When I look in the mirror  
It' s your face I see  
Even when I go to sleep at night  
It' s your face I see  
You are the one to congratulate me  
When I' ve done right  
You are the last to criticize me  
When I' ve done wrong  
You are the star of my show  
Oh...man...oh...man  
I don' t know where to start to thank you  
Everything I own I owe it to you  
  
[Chorus:]  
The man in the mirror  
  
When there' s decisions  
To be made  
You leave it up to me  
I leave it up to you  
And whatever you decide is alright with me  
Some people say you' re so difficult to live with  
Oh my, oh my  
But I know different  
Follow me I' m right behind you  
I don' t know where how to thank you  
This happiness I have  
I owe it all to you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Man in the mirror...
