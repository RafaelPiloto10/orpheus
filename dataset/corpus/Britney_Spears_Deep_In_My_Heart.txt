Oh, I want you for the rest of my life  
  
Walking through time  
Looking for an answer  
How can it be this way?  
What have I done?  
I just can't help but wonder  
How everything could change  
  
[Bridge]  
'Cause you've turned my world around  
Since you came along, know  
After this love is found  
It seems like we can't go wrong  
  
[Chorus]  
Deep in my heart I know there's only you  
And right from the start I always knew  
I'll never let go, cause I love you so  
Oh, I want you for the rest of my life  
(uh huh)  
(oh yeah)  
  
Some people search  
What seems to be a lifetime  
To find a love like this (oh yeah)  
And here we are  
With everything we've wished for  
I've never felt such bliss (oh no)  
  
Bridge:  
'Cause you've turned my world around  
Since you came along  
After this love is found  
It seems like we can't go wrong  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There comes a chance  
In everyone's life  
And I believe it won't happen twice  
Now since I've felt the glory of love  
I want to spend forever  
And ever with you  
  
[Chorus]  
Deep in my heart I know there's only you (only you)  
And right from the start I always knew  
I'll never let go, cause I love you so (I love you so)  
Oh, I want you for the rest of my life  
  
Deep in my heart I know there's only you (only you, only you, oh oh)  
And right from the start I always knew  
I'll never let go, cause I love you so (oh oh, I want you in my life)  
Deep in my heart  
Deep in my heart  
  
Oh, I want you for the rest of my life  
I want your love forever  
  
Oh, I want you for the rest of my life
