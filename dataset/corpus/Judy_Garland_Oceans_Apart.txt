Oceans apart and with only the blue between  
Since we're apart  
I'm yearning  
I tell my heart  
We must wait for another dawn  
When he may be returning  
How I regret the night he sailed for another shore  
Will he come into sight to leave my arms no more?  
I'll kiss him again  
He'll know right from the very start  
That we were never meant to be oceans apart  
Oceans apart and with only the blue between us  
Since we're apart  
I'm yearning  
I'll kiss him again  
He'll know right from the very start  
That we were never meant to be oceans apart.
