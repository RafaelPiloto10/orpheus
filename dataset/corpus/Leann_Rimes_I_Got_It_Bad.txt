Six a.m. came way to early  
But Friday means it's over soon  
Life gets boring in a hurry  
But I got somethin' that gets me goin'  
And I'm already gone  
  
I got it bad  
Feel that rumble  
tough and tumble under my feet  
I got it bad  
round and round, we've all gone mad  
Scream it - I got it bad  
  
I'm addicted to the fast life  
I cut my teeth on concrete dreams  
The rush of no control gets me high  
You know what I think  
too much of a bad thing  
Is exactly what I need  
  
I got it bad  
Feel that rumble  
tough and tumble under my feet  
I got it bad  
round and round, we've all gone mad  
Scream it - I got it bad  
  
Bad for speed and burnin' candles  
At both ends till I'm unraveled  
Bad for jumpin' off the edge  
Without a net because I can  
  
But I got somethin' that gets me goin'  
And I'm already gone  
  
I got it bad  
Feel that rumble  
tough and tumble under my feet  
I got it bad  
round and round, we've all gone mad  
Scream it - I got it bad
