I'm lost in paradise you will see it in my eyes  
Come rescue me  
'cause I need you here with me  
Lost in paradise  
Lost in paradise  
You gave me your love  
You gave me your sweet lil' lips  
You showed me everything I need  
A 'lil girl liking you  
Last fragrant flowers, dining with candles  
Kissing and talking every night, is all we did  
I wish it will never end, with all the love we shared  
Wishing those memories will last forever  
And now I see, what you're doing to me  
And I start to cry, just like listening to a sad lullaby  
You left me all alone, I feel foolish I'd have known  
What's this all about  
Don't know what to do, O babe but still I love you  
And I know inside my mind, how I wish that you will always be there  
I'm lost in paradise you will see it in my eyes  
Come rescue me  
'cause I need you here with me  
I still remember, that you will always be there  
You'd stay here with me, 'til the river runs dry  
Last fragrant flowers, dining with candles  
Kissing and talking every night, is all we did  
I wish it will never end, with all the love we shared  
Wishing those memories will last forever  
And now I see, what you're doing to me  
And I start to cry, just like listening to a sad lullaby  
You left me all alone, I feel foolish I'd have known  
What's this all about  
Don't know what to do, O babe but still I love you  
And I know inside my mind, how I wish that you will always be there  
I'm lost in paradise you will see it in my eyes  
Come rescue me  
'cause I need you here with me  
Lost in paradise  
Lost in paradise  
Lost in paradise  
Lost in paradise  
And now I see, what you're doing to me  
And I start to cry, just like listening to a sad lullaby  
You left me all alone, I feel foolish I'd have known  
What's this all about  
Don't know what to do, O babe but still I love you  
And I know inside my mind, how I wish that you will always be there  
I'm lost in paradise you will see it in my eyes  
Come rescue me  
'cause I need you here with me
