If we tell you that you've got two days to live  
Then don't complain, cause that's one more than you'd get in Zaire  
  
So don't hang around and be foolish  
Do something constructive with your weekend  
  
From Monday morning I work for Friday nights  
Collect my wages, then try to paint on the smell of soap  
  
Cause tonight I get ready early  
Score what I need and go pick a girl up  
It seems like ages since we had some fun  
  
Here comes the weekend, I get to see the girls  
Long live the weekend, the weekend is here  
(The weekend starts here)  
Everything feels right now  
I know why I'm alive now  
Everything else is a lie now  
Now I know why I'm here  
Here comes the weekend, I'm gonna do my head  
Long live the weekend, the weekend is dead
