The hands of the wicked  
They lie and they wait for you  
Servants remember  
The torture you put us through  
Living in fear  
Thoughts that never knew.  
Your day has come and  
Time has caught up with you!!!  
  
There's no tomorrow  
There's no tomorrow for all of you  
  
You wish forever  
The life you have will last  
You can not deceive us  
Remember your evil past.  
We're! gonna get you  
Destined for the other side  
Nowhere to run.  
No place to hide!!!  
  
There's no tomorrow  
There's no tomorrow for all of you  
Your life is through  
  
There's, no tomorrow, beginning or end  
No choice of life, it lies in the hands  
Their minds are made, in the end  
No tomorrow, cause you are dead!!!  
  
Then caught alive, your soul set us on fire  
You scream for mercy, the flames and they burn you higher  
Wished with hope not the truth that you would find  
But its hard to live when life is so blind!  
  
There's no tomorrow  
There's no tomorrow for all of you
