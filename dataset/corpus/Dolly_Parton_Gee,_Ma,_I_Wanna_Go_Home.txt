Gee, Ma, I wanna go, but they won't let me go  
Gee, Ma, I wanna go home  
Oh, the soldiers in the army, we know they're mighty fine  
And the Navy, Air Force and Marines keep us all in line  
But I don't want no more of this military life  
Gee, Ma, I wanna go, but they won't let me go  
Gee, Ma, I wanna go home  
Oh, the viddles in the mess hall, they say they're mighty fine  
But that She-Ite on a shingle, why, I think I'll give you mine  
Oh, I don't want no more of this military life  
Gee, Ma, I wanna go, but they won't let me go  
Gee, Ma, I wanna go home  
  
Oh, I wanna go back home, back where civilians roam  
Gee, Ma, I wanna go home  
  
Well, now, I tried to join the army, they said my feet were flat  
And since I can not see them, I'll take their word for that  
Oh Gee, Ma, I wanna go home  
  
Oh, I wanna go back home, back where civilians roam  
Gee, Ma, I wanna go home  
  
Oh, the mother of all battles is what Sadam had planned  
Well, he shoulda sent his Mother 'cause his troops all turned and ran  
Oh, I don't want no more of this military life  
Gee, Ma, I wanna go, but they won't let me go  
Gee, Ma, I wanna go home  
  
Oh, I wanna go back home, back where civilians roam  
Where my rules are all my own  
Gee, Ma, I wanna go home
