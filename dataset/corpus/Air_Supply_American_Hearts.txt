They were married in September back in 1969  
They travelled, these two Indians,  
To find some peace of mind  
They stood for love and freedom  
They were children of their time oh oh  
  
They lived in a world that was cold and uncaring  
They swore they would change it  
with loving and shareing  
They'll never live like their parents have done  
Their innocence shone like the sun  
  
American hearts, so filled with emotion  
American hearts, so easily broken  
  
Now they've got a family and a cottage in the hills  
He's always working late to pay the mortgage and the bills  
And she has trouble sleeping  
So the doctor gives her pills oh oh  
  
Who are these strangers who used to be lovers  
Now they've got nothing to say to each other  
Too far apart to discuss their mistakes  
They filed for divorce and it breaks their  
  
American hearts, so fiIled with emotion  
American hearts, so easily broken  
  
Ah - American hearts  
Ah - American hearts, American hearts  
  
Now that it's over they'll each go on living  
Never forgetting but somehow forgiving  
They'll care for their children protect them with pride  
And that's how their dream will survive in  
  
American hearts, so filled with emotion  
American hearts, so easily broken  
  
American hearts, so filled with emotion  
American hearts, so easily broken
