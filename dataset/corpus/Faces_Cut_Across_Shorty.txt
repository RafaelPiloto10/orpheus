Now a country boy named shorty  
And a city boy named dan  
Had to prove who could run the fastest  
To wed miss lucy's hand  
  
Now dan had all the money  
And he also had the looks  
But shorty musta had that something boys  
That can't be found in books  
  
Cut across shorty, shorty, cut across  
That's what miss lucy said  
Cut across shorty, shorty, cut across  
You know it's you that I want to wed  
  
Wait a minute  
Now dan had been in training  
About a week before the race  
He made up his mind old shorty  
  
Would end in second place  
You know dan with his long legs flying  
He left shorty far behind  
Shorty heard him holler out  
  
Miss lucy that you'll soon be mine  
Cut across shorty ... but shorty wasn't worried  
There was a smile upon his face  
'Cause old lucy had fixed the race  
  
And just like that old story  
About the turtle and the hare  
You know that thing  
When danny crossed over the finish line  
  
He found shorty waiting there  
Cut across shorty ...  
It's you that I want to wed, no no  
And oh lord it's you I want to wed  
It's you that I want to wed
