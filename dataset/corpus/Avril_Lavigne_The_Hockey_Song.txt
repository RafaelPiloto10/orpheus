Hello out there, were on the air  
It's hockey night tonight!  
Tension grows,  
As the whistle blows,  
And the puck goes down the ice.  
The goalie jumps,  
And the players bump,  
And the fans all go insane.  
Someone roars:  
"Bobby Scores!"  
At the good old hockey game!  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh!  
The good old hockey game!  
It's the best game you can name!  
And the best game you can name,  
Is the good old hockey game!  
  
Second Period.  
Players dash,  
With skates a-flash,  
The home team trails behind.  
But they grab the puck,  
And go bursting up,  
And they're down across the line.  
They storm the crease,  
Like bumblebees,  
They travel like a burning flame.  
See them slide the puck inside,  
It's a one one hockey game!  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh!  
The good old hockey game!  
It's the best game you can name!  
And the best game you can name,  
Is the good old hockey game!  
  
Third Period.  
Last game in the play-offs too.  
Oh take me where, the hockey players,  
Face off down the rink,  
And the Stanley Cup,  
Is all filled up,  
For the champs who win the drink!  
Now the final flick,  
Of a hockey stick,  
And a one gigantic scream:  
"THE PUCK IS IN! THE HOME TEAM WINS!"  
At the good old hockey game  
  
(chorus- repeat 3 times)  
Oh!  
The good old hockey game!  
It's the best game you can name!  
And the best game you can name,  
Is the good old hockey game!
