LH cause 714 is the area  
Everybody grab a friend and jump on in  
Get a new view and a message to send  
Look for the truth and hand you can lend  
But you Got something to prove  
A turn of your back and you're on the move  
And me I get to see  
  
All of the things that you had and all you could be  
When the world is all about you  
Can't you make your way through  
And all I can do is say  
Hey man, where ya going  
Going real far and I won't stop for nothing  
Hey man, what ya thinking  
What I see is me, don't you see me shining  
Why do you think you can make the world yours  
No way today  
  
So your a big shot now, still don't know who you are and  
Everything you want and need is at your feet, so what  
Good times  
Drink your red wine  
Try not to think of things left behind  
You're a star  
  
And you've made it this far  
Strange how you really don't know who you are  
Divide All your time and your pride  
Take all the names that you've learned in stride  
When the world is all about you  
Can't you make your way through  
And all I can do is say  
Hey man, where ya going  
Going real far and I won't stop for nothing  
Hey man, what ya thinking  
What I see is me, don't you see me shining  
Why do you think you can make the world yours  
No way today  
God damn  
  
Here it comes again  
My friend, I'll stay to the end  
But I need some room so that I can get in This place  
It's all a waste  
Your energy spent on just getting a taste  
  
And me  
I get to see  
All the things that you had and all you could be  
When the world is all about you  
Can't you make your way through  
And all I can do is say  
Hey man, where ya going  
Going real far and I won't stop for nothing  
Hey man, what ya thinking  
What I see is me, don't you see me shining  
Why do you think you can make the world yours  
  
No way today  
So ideal  
Your time is running but you don't know why  
And nothing comes for free when you don't want to try  
So unreal  
Your time is running and I see it  
All of your life did you really want to be it  
Your time is running out
