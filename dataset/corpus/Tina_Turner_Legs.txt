She's got legs  
She knows how to use them  
She never begs  
She knows how to choose them  
She's holdin' legs  
Wonderin' how to feel them  
Would you get behind them?  
If you could only find them  
She's my baby  
She's my baby  
Yeah, it's alright  
It's alright  
It's alright  
Alright  
She's got hair  
Down to her fanny  
She's kinda jet set  
Try undo her panties  
Every time she's dancin'  
She knows what to do  
Everybody wants to see  
To see if she can use it  
She's so fine  
She's all mine  
Girl, you got it right  
So right  
You got it right  
Alright  
[Incomprehensible]  
She's got legs  
She knows how to use them  
She never begs  
She knows how to choose them  
She's got a dime  
All of the time  
Stays out at night movin'  
Through time  
Oh, I want her  
So, I got to have her  
That girl's alright  
She's alright  
She's alright  
Right, right, right, girl  
Baby, alright  
[Inaudible]
