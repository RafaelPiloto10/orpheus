Rain rain  
Go away  
I couldn't take you  
One more day  
There's broken glass here  
On the floor  
And I can't take this anymore  
  
Stay stay  
Don't leave now  
I'll do anything  
But let you go  
My hands are cold  
My eyes can't see  
You can't do this  
Not to me  
  
Rain rain  
Go away  
I can't stand this one more day  
I'll close my eyes  
I'll shut my brain  
I can't stand this  
Fucking rain  
  
I can't stand the rain  
Close my eyes
