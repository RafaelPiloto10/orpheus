Wear something warm when it's wet  
Oh, I know you hate to be told  
I'm so afraid you'll forget  
You know how easy you catch cold  
Don't stay out late at a party  
You feel bad next day when you do  
And leave on a light when you're home alone at night  
I still care what happens to you  
I guess I shouldn't be concerned  
I guess I still haven't learned  
I can't worry about you after all we're through  
But I still care what happens to you  
I still care what happens to you
