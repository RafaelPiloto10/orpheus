Are you waiting on something profound in your life?  
Something to touch your core?  
Making up for what seems millions of years  
Reaping the goods, but not sure...  
  
Come along, come along  
Can you see there's more?  
Not just defeat vain attempts to do things right  
More than the toil to endure each day  
Or the ache you forget and leave behind  
  
If creatures roamed the space in heaven  
They're angels, beasts, or supermen  
Do they ease attaining things  
No one believed you'd achieve?  
So once you may ascend to heaven  
Someone there has made it so  
You could be the one they've been waiting for  
  
Still running about seeking sense in your life  
What you couldn't make count before  
Taking much of your time is grieving about things  
Well, you could care less, what's that for...  
  
Come along, come along  
Can you see there's more?  
Not just defeat vain attempts to do things right  
More than the toil to endure each day  
Or the ache you forget and leave behind
