Maybe light a candle  
Don't say a prayer for me  
Feel alone  
'cause I'm gone  
I left you  
Make Christmas your own  
  
You throw the thought of us away  
You'll be alone this holiday  
  
Said, It's cold in this town  
And there's snow on the ground  
Far from home  
Not alone  
I left you with nothing  
And that's what you own  
  
You throw the thought of us away  
You'll be alone this holiday  
  
Maybe light a candle  
Don't say a prayer for me  
Feel alone  
'cause I'm gone  
I left you the best time  
Make Christmas your own  
  
You throw the thought of us away  
You'll be alone this holiday
