I?m a master of disguise,  
Mystery in your eyes,  
Travelling the backroads of your country.  
Well, you think you?ve got my number  
And then again, you wonder  
Will you ever get to find the real me.  
  
Things are not always  
As they first may seem  
It?s like living in a dream.  
  
So you?d like me to reveal  
All that I know and feel  
At the risk of causing panic and destruction.  
Well, there?s a method to this madness.  
I don?t mean to cause you sadness  
My course is strictly governed by instruction.  
  
Things are not always  
As they first may seem  
It?s like living in a dream.  
  
I?m a master of disguise  
Not about to compromise  
My position in this scheme of worldly values.  
Ah, they?re calling out my name.  
I?ve promised to remain  
Ever faithful to the memory of what is true.  
  
Things are not always  
As they first may seem  
It?s like living in a dream.  
  
Oh, I?m living in a dream,  
I?m high, I?m high.  
In the cold, cold night, I?m high.
