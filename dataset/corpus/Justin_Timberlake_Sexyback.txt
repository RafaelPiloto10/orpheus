I'm bringin' sexy back  
Them other boys don't know how to act  
I think it's special, what's behind your back  
So turn around and I'll pick up the slack  
  
Dirty babe  
You see these shackles, baby  
I'm your slave  
I'll let you whip me if I misbehave  
It's just that no one makes me feel this way  
  
[Chorus]  
Come here, girl (Go 'head, be gone with it)  
Come to the back (Go 'head, be gone with it)  
VIP (Go 'head, be gone with it)  
Drinks on me (Go 'head, be gone with it)  
You see what you're twerking with (Go 'head, be gone with it)  
Look at those hips (Go 'head, be gone with it)  
You make me smile (Go 'head, be gone with it)  
Go 'head, child (Go 'head, be gone with it)  
And get your sexy on (Go 'head, be gone with it)  
Get your sexy on (Go 'head, be gone with it)  
Get your sexy on (Go 'head, be gone with it)  
Get your sexy on (Go 'head, be gone with it)  
Get your sexy on (Go 'head, be gone with it)  
Get your sexy on (Go 'head, be gone with it)  
Get your sexy on (Go 'head, be gone with it)  
Get your sexy on  
  
I'm bringin' sexy back  
Them other fuckers don't know how to act  
Girl, let me make up for all the things you lack  
Because you're burning up, I got to get it fast  
(Take it to the bridge)  
  
Dirty babe  
You see these shackles, baby  
I'm your slave  
I'll let you whip me if I misbehave  
It's just that no one makes me feel this way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(You ready? You ready? You ready?)  
  
I'm bringin' sexy back  
You mother fuckers watch how I attack  
If that's your girl, better watch your back  
'Cause you're burning up for me, and that's a fact  
(Take it to the chorus)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Are you ready, yes? Are you ready, yes?)
