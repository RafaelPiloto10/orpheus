Yeah, sing the song, Bro'  
  
If the sun refuse to shine,  
I don't mind, I don't mind,  
If the mountains fell in the sea,  
Let it be, it ain't me.  
Alright, 'cause I got my own world to look through,  
And I ain't gonna copy you.  
  
Now if six turned out to be nine,  
I don't mind, I don't mind,  
Alright, if all the hippies cut off all their hair,  
I don't care, I don't care.  
Dig, 'cause I got my own world to live through  
And I ain't gonna copy you.  
  
White collared conservative flashing down the street,  
  
Pointing their plastic finger at me.  
They're hoping soon my kind will drop and die,  
But I'm gonna wave my freak flag high, high.  
Wave on, wave on  
Fall mountains, just don't fall on me  
Go ahead on Mr. Business man, you can't dress like me.  
Sing on brother, play on drummer.
