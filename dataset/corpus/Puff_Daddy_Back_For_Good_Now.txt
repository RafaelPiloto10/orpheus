[P. Diddy)  
Uhh, yeah, you know what it is  
  
[Black Rob]  
Hey , back on the scene  
Ain't nuthin' changed  
Still doin' wild things  
Whippin' something mean  
The whole shorts in the Rolls Royce is off  
For sure, bouncin' the bar on my next world tour  
When we hit the sick, I'm the cure  
We 'bout to pop it off so wild, hit the floor  
Ain't nobody botherin' you  
All I'm thinkin' 'bout is clobberin' you  
Immigration always sayin' I'm harboring a few  
Illegal aliens  
Females, mostly Latins and Israeli-ans  
The top story, evening news  
I'm the shit, they been deceiving you  
Drop the roof on the Coupe D'Ville  
Shoot to kill  
Ask niggas, Duke is real  
Stay lookin' for the loot to steal  
He determined  
Don't try to touch Bad Boy, cause we burnin'  
I want my glory  
Duke is not a joke, and I ain't gotta story  
Every time I grab the mic it's with the sole intent  
To rip shots and give you 2OO percent  
Man, I'm tired of doin' dirt  
Tired of being on the the run from Wyatt Earp  
Rather be somewhere in a quiet church, sayin' prayers  
Not only sayin' mine, but sayin' theirs  
That's cause my dogs ain't there  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
The more hits we make, more money to burn  
The more fame we get, niggas get concerned  
It don't matter who's hot, who's out  
Bad Boy is Back For Good Now  
  
[Loon]  
Hey yo, I'm fresh off the plane  
Trying to get a little bit of stress off my brain  
M-I-A  
Dom P., palm trees, 9O degrees  
Arm freeze, mom please, ain't nothin' but cheese  
Caribbean Sea, Malibu breeze  
Watchin' DVDs on 5O inch screens  
So cut it out, you ain't now Don Juan, please  
I stay spillin' Dom on my Sean John jeans  
I hit the bar, yo, it's all on me  
Pop bottles, models, be all on me  
You all goin' see how it's all gon' be  
Front on me and see where you all gon' be  
Six feet deep  
When the heat seek, niggas be misty  
From 155th to 11Oth Street  
Harlem bound, Bad Boy, who the fuck want a problem now?  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
[P. Diddy]  
See this is the part I like right here  
I like when I see everybody on the dance floor  
Yeah, I see why y'all, just shakin' your asses  
See man, hold on, I need to break it down  
Yeah  
One time like this  
  
Now would you clap your hands  
Your hands you clap  
If your girl's outta place then your girl get tapped  
Niggas keep thinkin' Diddy ain't on it like that  
But you never see me standing on the corner like that  
Cause, I'm talented, yes I'm gifted  
Never boosted, never shoplifted  
Forget get the cash, the money ain't nothin'  
Cause everything I talk about, you know I ain't fronting  
I rock Sean John everyday  
Boutiques from France to the USA  
And I make all the chips off the hits I invent  
So it really doesn't matter how much I spent  
Cause, I'm droppin' hits  
Daily  
You burn me?  
Really?  
Think Bad Boy been played a million times  
And I don't care if niggas write a billion rhymes  
Damn, we still payed!  
  
We still payed!  
Yeah, we got it made!  
  
[Loon]  
Hey yo, this game ain't stoppin'  
We champagne poppin'  
Girl, I got shit that your man ain't coppin'  
You could hop in when your man ain't watchin'  
Give you one option, temperature's droppin'  
Gettin' cold, control your soul when I'm locked in  
You the type of chick that fold when you boxed in  
Signals my watch and givin' you more reasons to hop in  
This is a Bentley, not a Datsun  
Don't confuse me with dude, I'm not him  
Your man got a lot to learn  
But you could leave with the cat if you that concerned  
One day you goin' actually learn  
But not now cause, girl, I got tracks to burn  
I stay on my J-O-be  
Nigga, me, P. Diddy, B. are-O-be  
  
[P. Diddy]  
The fam baby, Bad Boy  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
[P. Diddy]  
Yeah, I want to dedicate this to everybody that been down with us  
From day one  
Shakin' them asses on the dance floor  
That's all we're tryin' to do  
Mo' money, no mo' problems  
2OO1, Bad Boy forever
