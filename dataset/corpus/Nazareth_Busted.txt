My bills are all due and the baby needs shoes  
And I'm busted  
Cotton is down to a quarter a pound  
But I'm busted  
I got a cow that went dry and a hen that won't lay  
A big stack of bills that gets bigger each day  
The county's gonna haul my belongings away  
'Cause I'm busted.  
  
I went to my brother to ask for a loan  
'Cause I was busted  
I hate to beg like a dog without his bone  
But I'm busted  
My brother said there ain't a thing I can do  
My wife and my kids are all down with the flu  
And I was just thinking about callin' on you  
And I'm busted.  
  
Well I am no thief but a man can go wrong  
When he's busted  
The food that we packed that last summer is gone  
And I'm busted  
The fields are all bare and the cotton won't grow  
Me and my fam'ly got to pack up and go  
But I'll make a living just where I don't know  
'Cause I'm busted.
