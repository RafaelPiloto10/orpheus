I'm a pretty, pretty rebel,  
I know you'll never find another girl like me!  
I want it on another level,  
No you'll never find a girl who rides like me!  
I called you on the phone and you're hiding, oh!  
I know you locked the door, boy let me in! Oh!  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm gonna crawl in your window  
And no one is ever gonna know,  
I'm gonna come and take control  
You can't leave!  
I'm gonna start from down bellow  
And I'll be done before you know,  
I'm gonna come and take control  
You won't breathe!  
Oh, I'll eat you up alive,  
Swallow all your pride!  
I'm gonna crawl in your window  
And no one is ever gonna know,  
I'm gonna come and take control  
That's the deal!  
I'm a black widow!  
I'm a black widow!  
  
With my eight hands I can hold you,  
There's no way I will ever let you go!  
All your friends tried to warn you,  
Boy, you had to take a chance and now you know!  
Just another name crossed off the list, oh!  
And when it's over there's no goodbye kiss  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm gonna crawl in your window  
And no one is ever gonna know,  
I'm gonna come and take control  
You can't leave!  
I'm gonna start from down bellow  
And I'll be done before you know,  
I'm gonna come and take control  
You won't breathe!  
Oh, I'll eat you up alive,  
Swallow all your pride!  
I'm gonna crawl in your window  
And no one is ever gonna know,  
I'm gonna come and take control  
That's the deal!  
I'm a black widow!  
I'm a black widow!  
  
No, there's no time for rescuing,  
Know you were just a fling, yeah.  
Now that the dark, is settling,  
You can go, you can go, you can,  
You can go, you can go!  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm gonna crawl in your window  
And no one is ever gonna know,  
I'm gonna come and take control  
You can't leave!  
I'm gonna start from down bellow  
And I'll be done before you know,  
I'm gonna come and take control  
You won't breathe!  
Oh, I'll eat you up alive,  
Swallow all your pride!  
I'm gonna crawl in your window  
And no one is ever gonna know,  
I'm gonna come and take control  
That's the deal!  
I'm a black widow!  
I'm a black widow!
