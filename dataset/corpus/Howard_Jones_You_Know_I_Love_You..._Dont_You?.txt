You got the socket and I got the plug  
I am the floor and you are the rug  
I got the rhythm you got the beat  
We feel it shake us from our souls to our feet  
And you know I Love you  
You know I Love you...don't you  
You got the metal and I got the die  
We make a structure that no one can deny  
I need you and you need me  
I need your honey like a flower needs a bee  
You know I Love you  
You know I Love you...don't you  
No one is an island on that you can depend  
A person on his own is a sinking ship  
It will be that way til the time will end  
Now don't you worry when things get tough  
We'll stick together through the smooth and the rough  
Your the steam engine and I am the tracks  
Roll over me I'll be rolling right back 'cause
