Did anybody notice, over marmalade and eggs  
In between the princess' legs  
What with wars and floods and beggars  
Not to mention stocks and shares  
If you have a moment to spare  
Can you write and reassure me that I have seen  
They're constructing a time machine  
There will be no need for the obituary pages  
We can have any hero from the bygone ages  
'Til the truth emerges, the argument rages  
  
[Chorus:]  
The major and the minor  
Turn from tallow into tar  
Should we leave them in their place?  
Down in damnation's cellar  
  
When any form of deity that you might enjoy  
Can be conjured with a test-tube and a flame  
If it's out there then science can explain it  
Or at least remove the blame  
And if there's is anyone you'd like to see again  
The speak up quickly  
  
Send us back Da Vinci then we don't have to ponder  
The maddening smile of "La Giaconda"  
The critics say Nijinsky, the dancer, of course  
While the punters would probably prefer the horse  
You'll find it's quicker than history, cheaper than divorce  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Bring back Liberace or Ollie and Stan  
Shakespeare will have to wait his turn  
Elvis Presley and Puccini shall return  
I suppose we live and learn, though it's hard to believe as we  
Cheerfully burn  
It's curious  
Some will call for justice.  
There are murders to solve  
What about Hitler? or at least lee Harvey Oswald  
Give us this day and everything we squander  
Anyone beautiful  
Somebody blonder  
They'll never please mankind, so lie back and enjoy it  
Stop press: they've just decided to destroy it  
  
[Chorus:]
