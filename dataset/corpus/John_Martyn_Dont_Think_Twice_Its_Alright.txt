It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe  
If you don't know by now  
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, baby  
It just don't matter anyhow  
When the rooster crows at the break of dawn  
Look out of your windown, I'll be gone  
You're the reason that I'm travelling on  
Don't think twice it's alright  
It ain't no use you calling out my name, girl  
Like you never done before  
It ain't no use you calling out my name, girl  
I just can't hear you any more  
I wish there was something you might do or say  
To make me change my mind and stay  
We never did too much talking anyway  
Don't think twice it's alright  
It ain't no use you turning on your light, babe  
The light that I never knowed  
It ain't no use you turning on your light, baby  
'Cause I'm on the dark side of the road  
Well, I'm not saying that you treated me unkind  
You could have done better, I just don't mind  
You just kinda wasted my precious time  
Don't think twice it's alright  
I'm walking down my long lonesome road, babe  
Where I'm bound I can't tell  
'Goodbye' is too good a word, baby  
So I'll just say ''Fare thee well''  
I'm thinking and I'm wondering all the way down the road  
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told  
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul  
Don't think twice  
Don't think twice  
Don't think twice it's alright
