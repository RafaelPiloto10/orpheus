Hey,  
Uh-huh,  
Well, alright  
  
How y'all doing? Yes Ma'am!  
Lookin' mighty fine.  
  
I've been around the world,  
Seen so many pretty girls.  
But I still get overwhelmed,  
When I look in your eyes.  
  
Been from Maine to Spain,  
But everything seems the same,  
I only feel a change,  
When I look in your eyes.  
  
I know you're upper class,  
I know you've got pizzas.  
Every man wanna kiss yo'  
And I do, too!  
  
Sometimes, I'm just a clown,  
And everybody puts me down.  
I guess I'll come around,  
When I look in your eyes.  
  
Tell me, what's a man to do,  
To get close to you.  
I'm just a lonely fool,  
When I look in your eyes.  
  
Don't tell me "no" this time,  
If you do, it'll blow my mind.  
Have you ever seen a grown man cry?  
It's an awful thing.  
  
I guess it's time to say goodbye,  
But I've gotta give it one more try.  
I'm only satisfied,  
When I look in your eyes.  
  
Oh please come home with me,  
Oh don't you wanna marry me?  
I'm even goin' rub your feet when they stank (how can i)  
How can I let you down,  
I guess I'm always goin' be around.  
I'm simply astounded,  
When I look in your eyes.
