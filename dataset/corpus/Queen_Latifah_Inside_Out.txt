Uh huh, well the name is Latifah, you hear me coming through  
the spreaker. Hit it Mark, 45 king  
I am a bill, yes I'm only a bill when  
It's time to ill I get ill and time to chill  
I chill, my homeboy said this was the D.A.I.S.Y. age  
I take it as meaning you have to get crazy paid  
You hope I'm from your borough, because I'm thorough  
You want me to be down with you, to be seen walking around with you  
Go to the store and buy a brew and rock a rhyme or two  
So you can bite it, you taste it, you like it  
You think I'm sleeping on you? Please, don't even try it  
The name is Latifah, the scene, it is mine  
The 45 King keeps the beat and the time while I  
Rock to the rhythm and keep it blowing out  
So don't try to turn me inside out  
Latifah is the name you love  
Flying through rhymes like a dove  
Slapping suckers with a glove  
Challenge me and you will burn  
Yes in the fire you will burn  
It's so so simply done  
When I find that I have to run  
Lyrics to music by the King of Swing, The 45 King  
The words we bring I write, and sing  
Cause I am Latifah, the Queen of course  
Don't try to get yours off, because the cause is lost  
Mark conducts the beat, I watch it hit them  
Won't you chill? I don't need another victim  
To add to the list of aggrivation  
Subtracting suckers like a math computation  
We are not teaching pupils and subjects with no scruples  
This is a King and Queen creation  
So hello hello hello and how ya doing?  
Forget the smalltalk now, it's time for me to ruin  
Those who don't believe in what I'm saying  
When I put up the wall of words ain't no way into my Queendom  
Controlled by me, the heir to the throne is the Ruler Lord Ramsey  
The Ruler Lord, to him there is no equal  
He grabs it and starts bombing people  
Don't listen to me to figure me out  
Because you can't turn my mind inside out  
Latifah is the name you love  
Flying through rhymes like a dove  
Slapping suckers with a glove  
Challenge me and you will burn  
Yes in the fire you will burn  
Rhyming's not a question of one superiority  
But rather how you delegate the use of your authority  
I know who you are, and I know who you are to me  
But I came here just to party  
If it's a show you want, the show it live  
And if it's trouble you seek, I have arrived  
When Mark requests my approval, I nod  
And after each and every single rhyme I thank God  
although a taste of my body would soothe you  
I give you just my voice and watch the rhythm move you  
The method of my lyrics makes the funky people feel it  
And Lord have mercy on those that try to steal it  
Latifah is a name meaning "delicate and sensitive"  
But I have no problem formulating sentences  
To break you down to the ground  
I won't use violence, the color of this is brown  
And I am down, but never ever down and out  
So don't try to turn me inside out  
Latifah is the name you love  
Flying through rhymes like a dove  
Slapping suckers with a glove  
Challenge me and you will burn  
Yes in the fire you will burn  
Jah know? Cause ah...  
Music, 45 King, music Latifah the Queen  
Music, domination to bring the world  
Irie, say in the fire you will burn (Repeats to fade)
