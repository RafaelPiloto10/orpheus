Well grab your shoes, and grab your balls  
And lets head to those heavenly halls  
Sit on down and grab a beer  
Because bowling time is pretty near  
  
Tortured men forget their pain  
When they head to the bowling lane  
Let's go bowling

Because Wrestlemania's fine by me  
Monster trucks are a sight to see  
A cultured life, that's nice and all  
But there ain't nothing better than a bowling ball  
  
You know the sport that God would choose  
Is the one with the three-tone leather-sole shoes  
Let's go bowling

Yes bowling! The sport of kings! The sport of queens!  
The sport of dukes...Earls...Bos...Johns...anything that  
Looks good when it's embroidered on a polyester shirt.  
And you know, bowling takes on this almost religious  
  
Significance because it's so much like a religion.  
I mean the ball is round, like the earth, and it's got  
The holy trinity: the Father, the Son, and the..  
Thumbhole. And as you roll the ball down the alley of  
  
Life...Striking out the pagan religions of the past...  
Sparing them the anguish of their lives in the gutter...  
Framing their existence in an eternal metaphysicalness  
Something like a 7-10 split!
