Soon it will be the phase of the moon  
When people tune in  
Every girl know about the punctual blues  
But who's to know the power  
Behind our moves  
  
A day of coincidence with the radio  
And a word that won't go away  
We know what they're all going to say  
"G" arrives, funny, had a feeling he was on his way  
  
We raise our hats to the strange phenomena  
Soul birds of a feather flock together  
We raise our hats to the hand a-moulding us  
Sure 'nuff, he has the answer  
He has the answer  
He has the answer  
Na na, na na  
On mani padme  
On mani padme  
On mani padme hum  
  
You pick up a paper, you read a name  
You go out, it turns up again and again  
You bump into a friend you haven't seen  
For a long time  
Then into another you only thought about last night  
  
You hear your sister calling for you  
But you don't know where from  
You know there's something wrong  
But you don't want to believe in a premonition  
  
We raise our hats to the strange phenomena  
Soul birds of a feather flock together  
We raise our hats to the hand a-moulding us  
Sure 'nuff, he has the answer  
He has the answer  
He has the answer  
Na na, na na  
On mani padme  
On mani padme  
On mani padme hum
