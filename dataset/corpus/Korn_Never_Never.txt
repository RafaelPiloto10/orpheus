I'll never love again  
I would ever have to pretend  
I would never love again, damn!  
  
I don't even wanna have to try  
Draw a line  
Never flies  
I don't even wanna have to die  
But deep inside  
The dead rehearse  
And I never wanna clarify  
And justify  
So I run and hide  
And I never wanna sleep my fights  
So I crucified  
All my hate inside  
  
(No)  
I'll never love again (no)  
I will ever have to pretend (no)  
I'll never gonna love again  
Never gonna have to try to pretend  
Never, never, never  
  
I don't never wanna satisfy  
'Cause it's inside  
I'll do it fine  
I don't never wanna multiply  
'Cause deep inside  
I'm not qualified  
And I never wanna clarify  
And justify  
So I run and hide  
And I never wanna sleep the fight  
So I classify  
All my hate inside  
  
(No)  
I'll never love again (no)  
I will ever have to pretend (no)  
I'll never gonna love again  
Never gonna have to try to pretend  
Never, never, never  
I'll never love again  
I will never gonna love again  
  
Never, never  
  
(No)  
I'll never love again  
I will ever have to pretend  
I'll never gonna love again  
Never gonna have to try to pretend  
Never, never, never  
(No) never, never, never  
(No) never, never, never  
(No) I'll never gonna love again  
Never gonna have to try to pretend  
Never, never, never
