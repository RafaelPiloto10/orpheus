I can take anything cause I'm different from the rest  
Your lying lips don't bother me they still bring me happiness  
And I don't see all the things other people say you do  
I can take anything but losing you  
I can take anything cause I'm living for that day  
You get tired of running round and come back in my arms to stay  
I don't care how long you treat me like you do I can take anything but losing
you  
I can take anything cause my heart's learned to live  
Oh what you used to be and the love you used to give  
How do I take it now knowing I'm just a fool I can take anything but losing
you
