I'm sure that he could give you everything  
Stability and diamond rings  
All the things I do not have  
I understand you can't handle that  
But for everything that I lack  
I provide something you almost had  
Hot flesh that you yearn to grab  
Pit of your stomach you're still so sad  
  
So oh, what you gonna do.  
I'm in love with you  
Don't you wanna dance  
This might be the last chance  
That I get, to love you, oh oh oh  
  
Out of sight, not out of mind  
You want the world, I'll give you mine  
'Cause you're the girl I'll never find  
And I'm the boy you left behind  
I know you think you're satisfied  
And God knows how hard we tried  
But if you showed up at my door  
I could give you so much more oh  
  
Oh, what you gonna do  
I'm in love with you  
Don't you wanna dance  
This may be the last chance  
That I get, to love you, oh oh oh  
  
Oh, what am I gonna do  
I don't have to lose  
You're not making sense  
This might be the last chance  
That you get to love me, oh  
  
You sure don't make it easy  
To get myself to safety  
You tell me that I'm crazy  
But you're the one who makes me this way  
You call me so impulsive  
But that's what makes us so explosive  
  
So as I burn these photographs  
I wonder if you kept the ones you have  
Keep them locked up safe  
Since it's the only place you'll see my face  
  
Oh, what you gonna do  
I'm in love with you  
Why don't you wanna dance  
'Cause this might be the last chance  
That I get to love you, oh oh oh  
Oh, what am I gonna do  
I don't like to lose  
You're not making sense  
'Cause this may be the last chance  
That you get to love me, oh  
  
This may be the last chance that I get to love you, oh  
This may be the last chance that I get to love you, oh oh oh  
To love you, oh oh oh
