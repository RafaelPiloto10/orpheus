Don't cry for me my baby  
Don't say a word  
Everyone knows you're a dangerous bird  
  
Fly like a golden eagle  
Sleek like the snow  
Ticking your time bomb where ever you go  
  
You're sinking a line without a trace  
With elegant crimes against the state  
  
Killing with kindness yeah  
Making the most of the mess oh yeah  
You're mother and childless yeah, yeah  
Just kill them with kindness yeah, yeah  
  
Bye cruel politician  
Now you've been caught  
Came from behind  
It's a dangerous spot  
  
Green are the seeds of envy  
Watch how they grow  
Everyone knows there's a fire down below  
  
You're sinking a line without a trace  
With elegant crimes against the state  
  
Killing with kindness yeah  
Making the most of the mess oh yeah  
You're mother and childless yeah, yeah  
Just kill them with kindness yeah, yeah  
  
Killing with kindness  
Raising the ghost from the flesh oh yeah  
Don't blind them with science yeah, yeah  
Just kill them with kindness yeah, yeah  
  
Turn your back  
And you might understand  
Become your destiny  
And you'll be a lucky man  
Don't let anything stand in your way
