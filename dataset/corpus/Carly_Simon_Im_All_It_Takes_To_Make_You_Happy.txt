I would be much obliged  
To hear about  
Your lonesome childhood  
And the way  
You were done in  
By the folks back home  
But that's all over now  
You know  
The future looks good  
And I'm all  
It takes  
To make you happy  
  
Sing  
A little song for me  
The one about  
The day you gave up  
Everything else  
Everything else  
Everything else  
  
You know the reason  
That I know  
You just can't live  
Without me  
Is the way  
You fall apart  
When I'm not there  
Your hair gets snarled  
And you cannot tie  
Your shoes  
My pretty baby  
And I'm all it takes  
To make you happy  
  
Sing  
A little song for me  
The one about  
The day you gave up  
Everything else  
Everything else  
Everything else  
  
Sing  
A little song for me  
The one about  
The day you gave up  
Everything else  
Everything else  
Everything else  
  
Just delight  
In what you do not know  
The rest is hazy  
And you know  
You're much too old  
To be free  
  
If you tried  
To look beyond the deal  
It would amaze me  
Cause I'm all  
It takes  
To make you happy  
I'm all  
It takes  
To make you happy
