Too much time thinking about all of my mistakes  
My heart, my mind, my soul, my body ache  
A hunger for the loving arms of your embrace  
I walk along the lonely road  
I walk along the lonely road  
My back is strong girl, I carry the load  
All the grinding time, I pay the debt that's owed  
I walk along the lonely road  
Too much time thinking about everything that went wrong  
I cry my eyes out every time I hear your song  
I hope this path brings me back where I belong  
I walk along the lonely road  
I walk along the lonely road  
My back is strong girl, I carry the load  
All the grinding time, I pay the debt that's owed  
I walk along the lonely road  
Too much pride for me to up and take the blame  
Deep inside, girl it's killing me with pain  
Every night I sleep, I call your name  
I walk along the lonely road  
I walk along the lonely road  
My back is strong girl, I carry the load  
All the grinding time, I pay the debt that's owed  
I walk along the lonely road  
I walk along the lonely road  
My back is strong girl, I carry the load  
All the grinding time, I pay the debt that's owed  
I walk along the lonely road  
I walk along the lonely road, I walk along the lonely road
