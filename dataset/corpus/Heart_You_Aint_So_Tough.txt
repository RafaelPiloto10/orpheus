What in the world did I do to deserve you  
I don't understand why you treat me that way  
You knew you were everything that I ever wanted  
You had your own ways of makin' me pay  
  
Then you took it just a little to far  
Now I see you for what you are  
I don't need the heartache anymore  
  
Lovin' you was an endless fight  
I was wrong and you were always right  
But look what happened when I called your bluff  
When the truth comes out  
You aint' so tough - no  
  
You turned me into an emotional prisoner  
You hit me with words that cut to the bone - oh  
Then you kissed me and made me believe that I needed you  
And think I could never survive on my own - oh no  
  
Never thought that I would break away  
Now I see right through your power play  
And I don't feel so helpless after all  
  
Lovin' you was an endless fight  
I was wrong and you were always right  
But look what happened when I called your bluff  
When the truth comes out  
Hey, you aint' so tough  
  
You took me too far to forgive it  
That was your last mistake  
That was your last mistake  
  
Lovin' you was an endless fight  
I was wrong and you were always right  
But look what happened when I called your bluff  
When the truth comes out  
You aint' so tough  
You take it all but you don't give back  
You feel strong when the odds are stacked  
There comes a time when enough's enough  
When the truth comes out  
You aint' so tough  
You aint' so tough
