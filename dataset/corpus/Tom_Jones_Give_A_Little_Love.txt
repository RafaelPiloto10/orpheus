I got myself  
By an obsession  
It's on  
Another dimension  
Don't need a whole  
At protection  
Cause it give me  
All I've been getting  
It give me life, hope,  
Dreams, golds, you know  
  
[Chorus]  
You've got to give  
A little a love,  
Give a little a love  
Go on just do it,  
You can't confuse it  
Give a little a love give  
A little a love  
Go on and do it, Go!  
  
Leaving in a world  
When is plenty  
So how  
I come running and empty  
When we been touch  
By so many  
And still  
There's more without many  
Without any life, hope,  
Dreams, golds, you know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You know you got to do  
What you can  
You know you got  
To try to understand  
  
[Chorus]
