Silent night, holy night  
All is calm, all is bright  
Round yon virgin mother and child  
Holy infant so tender and mild  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
Silent night, holy night  
Shepherds quake at the sight  
Glories stream from heaven afar  
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia  
Christ the savior is born  
Christ the savior is born  
  
Peace, joy, love  
Was sent to all of us from Heaven up above  
To every man, woman, boy, and girl  
To all God's children, all of our world  
It's our hope that your dreams may come true  
Like ours have, thanks to all of you  
Now we have just one more wish  
That you all remember this  
The true meaning of Christmas  
Christ the savior is born  
Christ the savior is born
