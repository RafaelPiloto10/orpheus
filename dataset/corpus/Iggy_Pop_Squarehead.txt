You can kick me out of a real good jive  
You can use my friendship like a doorknob  
You can make me super Styrofoam  
You can make me feel all alone  
You can stuff hamburger in my head  
But I ain't gonna be no squarehead  
  
You can tempt me with a pretty girl  
You can call on me in fancy fur  
You can say, "Just do it, everyone is"  
You can tell me that it's just showbiz  
You can turn my life from green to red  
But I ain't gonna be no squarehead  
  
You can burn my bridges down for laughin', ha ha ha ha  
You can call me a fool for crashin', woh  
You can make me stare down at the floor  
You can make me listen while you snore  
You can do all these things that I have said  
But I ain't gonna be no squarehead  
Let's go!  
  
You can make my position low as a dog  
You can trick me with your social fog  
You can criticize my very bag  
You can call my treasures a heap of slag  
But you might as well eat lunch instead  
Cause I ain't gonna be no squarehead  
I ain't gonna be no squarehead  
I ain't gonna be no squarehead  
I ain't gonna be no squarehead  
No, I ain't gonna be no squarehead  
No, I ain't gonna be no squarehead  
No, I ain't gonna be no squarehead  
No, I ain't gonna be no squarehead  
I ain't gonna be no  
I ain't gonna be no
