I got so tired of meaningful looks  
I got so tired of comin' up tame  
I was so bothered by those balmy breezes  
I was side swiped by smoke fever  
They was a crawlin'  
Oh down beneath my skin  
Til mama come a runnin'  
A mama came a runnin'  
Mama came a runnin'  
Lord said she got a recipe  
Oh and she don't need no fancy sauce  
Yah those devil eyes  
Lord they stare right through me  
Those devil eyes  
Look right through me  
Aww melt my soul down  
Long for those devil eyes
