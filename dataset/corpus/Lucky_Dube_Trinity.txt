I'm sleeping with my one eye open  
Cause I think you gonna come for me  
You're sleeping with your gun in hand  
Cause you think I'm gonna make  
Me move  
  
I've been chasing white people all my life  
You've been chasing black people all  
Your life  
Now that we know where we went  
Wrong, it's time some truth came out here  
  
You going to educate me  
About white people  
I will educate you about Black people and we'll unite  
That's why they call me trinity  
And my game is unity  
  
[Chorus]  
Trinity, unity  
  
My brothers have been chasing racists all the time  
Your brothers have been chasing freedom fighters all the time  
But at the end of the day  
We didn't know much about each other yeah  
  
When you saw a black man  
You saw a criminal,  
When I saw a white man  
I saw an oppressor  
But now that we know where we went wrong  
Let's unite  
  
You will educate me about white people  
I will educated you about black people  
  
That is why they call my trinity  
Cause my game is unity  
  
[Chorus: Repeats]
