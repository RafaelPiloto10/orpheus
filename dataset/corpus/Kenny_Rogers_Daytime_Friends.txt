And he'll tell her, he's working late again  
But she knows to well there's something goin' on.  
She's been neglected, and she needs a friend  
So her trembling fingers dial the telephone.  
  
And Lord, it hurts her, doin' this again  
He's the best friend that her husband ever knew.  
When she's lonely, he's more than just a friend  
He's the one she loans her body to.  
  
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers  
Hoping no one else discovers  
Where they go, what they do  
In their secret hideaway  
  
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers  
They don't want to hurt the others  
So they love, in the nighttime  
And shake hands in the light of day.  
  
And when it's over, there's no peace of mind  
Just a longin' for the way things should have been.  
And she wonders, why some men never find  
That a woman needs a lover and a friend.  
  
Daytime friends and nighttime lovers
