Well it's almost nightfall  
And there's no forecast of rainfall  
And I'm in the mood for a party  
So I'm gonna go out to a club  
And give the dancefloor body  
So I jump in the car and go to the venue  
Walk in the door and now I'm on the menu  
Guys in the house they're wacthing me  
They're clocking me there's no stopping me  
  
(Desire) I know you want me  
(You're fine) thank you  
But I'm not the type of girl that you think I am  
I don't jump into the arms of every man  
(But I'm paid) I don't need your money  
(I love you) you must be mad  
Easy lover is something that I ain't  
Besides, I don't know you from a can of paint  
  
Tell me why is it when I walk past the guys  
I always hear, yo, baby?  
I mean like what's the big idea?  
I'm a queen, nuff respect  
Treat me like a lady  
And, no, my name ain't yo and I ain't got your baby  
I'm looking for a guy who's sincere  
One with class and savoir faire  
I'm looking for someone who has to be  
Perfect for the queen latifah me  
  
Fly girl, fly girl  
Come here, 'cause you're sexy and you're fine  
And I want you to be mine  
Fly girl, fly girl  
Have no fear, your heart is in good hands  
Won't you let me be your man?  
  
All my friends are in relationships  
Some of then good ones and some of them bad ones  
Some of the bad ones took a turn for the better  
And some of the good ones ended up sad ones  
You see? loving, it ain't hard to get  
I want a friend not just a lover  
Someone who is dedicated only to me  
Not to me and two or three others  
One who will not lie to me or think  
He can get my love by buying me  
I know I'll find him some day  
And when I find him  
He sure won't say  
  
Fly girl, fly girl  
Come here, 'cause you're sexy and you're fine  
And I want you to be mine  
Fly girl, fly girl, have no fear  
Have no fear, your heart is in good hands  
Won't you let me be your man?  
  
Lounging, sitting in the house  
And I'm cooling, first day of the week  
So there's nothing to do  
And I'm in the mood for a real soft kiss  
Momma never said there'll be days like this  
So I called her and we talked for a while  
Hang up the phone feeling better  
With a smile  
  
It's cool, 'cause 91 is my year  
And this time I know I'm gonna hear  
  
Fly girl, fly girl, come here  
Come here, 'cause you're sexy and you're fine  
And I want you to be mine  
Fly girl, fly girl  
Have no fear, your heart is in good hands  
Won't you let me be your man?  
  
(Desire) I know you want me  
(You're fine) thank you  
But I'm not the type of girl that you think I am  
I don't jump into the arms of every man  
(But I'm paid) I don't need your money  
(I love you) you must be mad  
Easy lover is something that I ain't  
Besides, I don't know you from a can of paint  
  
Fly girl, Fly girl, Fly girl  
Fly girl, Fly girl, Fly girl  
Fly girl, Fly girl, Fly girl  
Fly girl, Fly girl, Fly girl  
Fly girl, Fly girl
