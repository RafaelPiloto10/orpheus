May I take you higher  
Feed well your desire  
We won't be forgotten  
Foes left slain and rotten  
I will have my way  
As once before  
Others stand in awe  
Can't scorn at all  
I can, I can, I can  
Make it all again  
I don't want to lose  
I don't want to get drowned  
I can, I can I can  
Heed the call again  
Fulfill my dreams until I'm cured  
Some will leave here shattered  
Wish us tarred and feathered  
Show me anyone who doubts our ways  
I will laugh out loud and I will say  
I can, I can, I can  
Make it all again  
I don't want to lose  
I don't want to get drowned  
I can, I can I can  
Make the call again  
Can attain everything to leave you sure  
I can  
I can, I can, I can  
Make it all again  
I don't want to lose  
I don't want to get drowned  
I can, I can I can  
Heed the call again  
Fulfill my dreams until I'm cured
