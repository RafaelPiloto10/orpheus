I used to be content to frown  
But anything for money now  
I'd rather be a mannish kind of girl  
  
I used to get drunk on spanish wine  
Well now I'm drunk most all the time  
I guess I've been too grateful for too long  
So I sit around and wait  
And watch the grass grow green  
And count the cars  
Feeling lost, alone, misunderstood  
So I wait, hey hey  
Yes I wait, hey hey  
  
Well I had a girl in London town  
She picked me up and she spun me round  
I guess she was a mannish kind of girl  
  
I went away and I still don't know why  
Six feet under is where my bloody heart lies  
I'm just afraid I can't forget her now  
So I sit around and wait  
And watch the grass grow green  
And count the cars  
Feeling lost, alone, misunderstood  
So I wait, hey hey  
So I wait, hey hey  
Hey hey  
  
I used to be too big to crawl  
Now I don't give a damn at all  
I'd rather be a mannish kind of girl  
  
Yeah I used to get drunk on that Spanish wine  
But now I'm drunk most all the time  
I guess I'm just afraid I can't forget her now  
And so I'll sit around and wait  
And watch the grass grow green  
And count the cars  
Feeling lost, alone, misunderstood  
So I wait, hey hey  
Yeah I wait, hey hey  
Yes I wait, hey hey  
Yeah I wait, hey hey  
Hey hey
