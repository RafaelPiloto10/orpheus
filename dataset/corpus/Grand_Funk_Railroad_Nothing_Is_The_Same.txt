When I was feeling 'bout sixteen, I never had no idea.  
Listen to me if you want to know what I mean, your expression will let me see.  
I never knew what I was looking for, I never had the time.  
And now that time has opened up my door, now I'm looking forward just to see
what, just what's mine.  
  
When I was feeling 'bout eighteen, it's then when I began to see.  
No matter how hard you push on the door, it won't open without the key.  
Opportunity only knocks once, if you shut it out it's a sin.  
And when something keeps right on poundin', then, my friend, you'd better let
it in.  
  
Now I feel just a little bit old and, sadness fills my brain.  
I can flash to future years and nothing is the same.  
Nothing is the same.  
Nothing is the same.  
Nothing is the same.
