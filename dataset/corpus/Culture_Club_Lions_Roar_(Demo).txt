Dirty Babylon  
You're nasty  
  
Everyone said you are the don  
Respected, rejected, down trodden and stunned  
Hold up your head like the innocent one  
Threaten my life, tell me my time will come  
  
Babylon boy with the honey and gold  
Robbing the black men, stories of old  
Why tell the truth? I cannot be  
I am the light that you never see  
  
Oh, nothing more than the lion's roar  
Gimme truth and understanding  
Oh, nothing more than the lion's roar  
  
The voice in your head said I am a thief  
You stand on the land and you lie through your teeth  
Babylon boy with the honey and gold  
Robbing the black men, stories of old  
Why tell them truth? I cannot be  
I am the light that you never see  
  
Oh, nothing more than the lion's roar  
Gimme truth and understanding  
Oh, nothing more than the lion's roar  
  
Oh, nothing more than the lion's roar  
Gimme truth and understanding  
Oh, nothing more than the lion's roar  
Gimme truth and understanding  
  
You're nasty  
  
I know you want to see me dead  
You come on upon my head  
I know you want to see me dead  
You come on upon my head  
  
Oh, nothing more than the lion's roar  
Gimme truth and understanding  
Oh, nothing more than the lion's roar  
Oh, nothing more than the lion's roar  
Gimme truth and understanding  
Oh, nothing more than the lion's roar
