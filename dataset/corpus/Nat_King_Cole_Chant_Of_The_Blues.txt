I don't know why I'm so doggone unlucky today.  
Just got the news that my best gal has left me to stay.  
Things were pretty rosy,  
We got along so fine.  
Until another guy moved in  
And handed her a line.  
I don't know why I'm so doggone unlucky today.  
  
  
So I decided to try and get her off my mind.  
Started to walkin', to see what enjoyment I'd find.  
Was invited to a party,  
Then there was a fight.  
A fella got a whippin'...  
You guessed it right.  
I don't know why I'm so doggone unlucky today.
