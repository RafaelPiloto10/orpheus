I got to have you baby  
Don't you say that you don't care  
I got to have you baby  
Don't you say that you don't care  
Any way you want it baby  
I'll settle for a back door love affair  
I call you on the telephone  
The party says that you ain't there  
I call you on the telephone  
The party says that you ain't there  
When a man asked who's callin'  
I said, ?Just tell 'em it's a back door love affair?  
I got to have you baby  
Don't you say that you don't care  
I got to have you baby  
Don't you say that you don't care  
Any way you want it baby  
I'll settle for a back door love affair
