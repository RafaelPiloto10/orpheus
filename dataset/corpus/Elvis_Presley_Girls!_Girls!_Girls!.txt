Girls, goin' swimming,  
Girl, in bikinis,  
A walkin' and wigglin' by, yay, yay, yay  
Girls, on the beaches,  
  
Girls, oh, what a peaches,  
So pretty, lord I could cry  
I'm just a red blooded boy  
And I can't stop thinkin' about  
  
Girls, sailin' sailboats,  
Girls, water skiin',  
They'll drive me out of my mind, yay, yay, yay  
Girls, big and brassy,  
Girls, small and sassy,  
Just give me one of each kind  
  
I'm just a red blooded boy  
And I can't stop thinkin' about  
Girls! girls! girls! girls!  
  
And when I pick up a sandwich too much  
A crunchy crunchety  
A crunchety crunch  
I never ever get to finish my lunch  
Because there's always bound to be a bunch of  
  
Girls, in tight sweaters,  
Girls, in short dresses,  
A walkin' and wigglin' by, yay, yay, yay  
Girls, out boatin'  
Girls, just a floatin'  
So pretty, lord I could cry.  
  
I'm just a red blooded boy  
And I can't stop thinkin' about  
Girls! girls! girls! girls! girls! girls!
