I'm free as a wondering breeze  
I'm free to wander any place I please and yet  
I can't escape from you  
I'm free as the birds in the trees  
I'm even free to sail the seven seas and yet  
I can't escape from you  
I could ride away and hide away,  
Where we were miles apart  
But when I got there I'd find you there  
Right in my heart  
And so you see that I'm really not free  
I'm so afraid you might escape from me  
And yet I can't escape from you
