Lately, I've been forgetting  
To keep your memory Every day  
It's so long  
Since last time I saw you  
And sometimes the present  
Gets in the way  
But now and then  
You just walk right in  
Ask me how it's been  
Since you've been still  
And if I cry  
You just smile and sigh  
I never said goodbye  
I never will  
Lately things have been so good  
I with that you could  
Be here to see  
The beauty of all your grandchildren  
By your children  
Your legacy  
But now and then  
You just walk right in  
Ask me how it's been  
Since you've been still  
And if I cry  
You just smile and sigh  
I never said goodbye  
I never will  
Lately, I've been forgetting  
To keep your memory Every day
