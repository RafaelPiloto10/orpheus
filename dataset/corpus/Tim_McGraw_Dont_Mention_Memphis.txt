Mister can you take me into Little Rock  
I'll buy the coffee and I'll fill your truck  
I'll listen all night if you want to talk  
Just don't mention Memphis  
We can talk about your family  
Politics, music and philosophy  
Any ol' subject's alright with me  
Just don't mention Memphis  
  
[Chorus:]  
Or blue eyes, and light brown hair  
An angel waving to me from the top of the stairs  
The hardest thing I did was leave her standing there  
So don't mention Memphis  
  
Pass me the thermos and I'll fill your cup  
We'll make Texas with a little luck  
And I'm hanging with you till the sun comes up  
So don't mention Memphis  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I don't wanna talk about Memphis  
And the hardest thing I did was leave my baby there  
So don't mention Memphis  
I don't wanna talk about Memphis
