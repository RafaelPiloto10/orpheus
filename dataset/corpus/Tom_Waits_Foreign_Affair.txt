When traveling abroad in the continental style,  
It's my belief one must attempt to be discreet,  
And subsequently bear in mind your transient position  
Allows you a perspective that's unique  
  
And though you'll find your itinerary a blessing and a curse,  
Your wanderlust won't let you settle down  
And you'll wonder how you ever fathomed that you'd be content  
To stay within the city limits of a small midwestern town  
  
Most vagabonds I knowed don't ever want to find the culprit  
That remains the object of their long relentless quest  
The obsession's in the chasing and not the apprehending  
The pursuit, you see, and never the arrest  
  
Without fear of contradiction, bon voyage is always hollered  
In conjunction with a handkerchief from shore,  
By a girl who drives a Rambler and furthermore is overly concerned  
That she won't see him anymore  
  
Planes and trains and boats and buses characteristically  
Evoke a common attitude of blue  
Unless you have a suitcase and a ticket and a passport  
And the cargo that they're carrying is you  
  
A foreign affair, juxtaposed with a stateside  
And domestically approved romantic fancy,  
Is mysteriously attractive due to circumstances,  
Knowing it will only be parlayed into a memory
