Wise men say only fools rush in  
But I can't help falling in love with you  
Shall I stay  
Would it be a sin  
If I can't help falling in love with you  
  
Like a river flows surely to the sea  
Darling so it goes  
Some things are meant to be  
So take my hand, and take my whole life too  
Cause I can't help falling in love with you  
  
Like a river flows so surely to the sea  
Oh my darling so it goes  
Some things are meant to be  
So won't you please take my hand, and take my whole life too  
Cause I can't help falling in love, in love with you  
Cause I can't help falling in love, falling in love,  
I keep falling in love with you
