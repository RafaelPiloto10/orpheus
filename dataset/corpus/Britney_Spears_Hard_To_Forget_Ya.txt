[Verse 1]  
All my life they told me bout a creature so hypnotic  
But I guess I never thought it was true (Yeah)  
And now that I've seen you I've turned into a believer  
Baby so much for what I thought I'd do (Yeah)  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Since I tasted you I got a craving  
Shaking in the heat of the night  
Oh, yeah, baby you got me misbehaving  
And I don't even know what is right  
[Chorus]  
It's just so hard to forget ya  
It's just so hard to forget ya  
It's just so hard to forget ya  
It's just so hard to forget ya  
It's just so hard to forget ya  
It's just so hard to forget ya  
There's just something about ya  
Something about ya  
It's hard to forget ya  
We're stuck here forever  
Something about ya, 'bout ya  
Something about ya  
It's hard to forget ya  
We're stuck here forever  
Something about ya  
  
[Verse 2]  
Eyes locked on your body, sexy features, so iconic  
And I just can't keep my fingers away (no)  
Your love got me faded  
Keep it going, let's get wasted  
Baby, so much for my poker face (oh)  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Since I tasted you I got a craving  
Shaking in the heat of the night  
Oh, yeah, baby you got me misbehaving  
And I don't even know what is right  
  
[Chorus]  
It's just so hard to forget ya  
It's just so hard to forget ya  
It's just so hard to forget ya  
It's just so hard to forget ya  
It's just so hard to forget ya  
It's just so hard to forget ya  
There's just something about ya  
Something about ya  
It's hard to forget ya  
We're stuck here forever  
Something about ya, 'bout ya  
Something about ya  
It's hard to forget ya  
We're stuck here forever  
Something about ya, 'bout ya  
It's just so hard to forget ya  
It's just so hard to forget ya  
It's just so hard to forget ya  
  
[Bridge]  
Ah, there's something 'bout you  
There's something 'bout you  
(When I think about it)  
Nobody can do it as good  
(When I think about it)  
I keep running right back to you  
(When I think about it)  
A lifetime just won't be enough  
I need more, more, more  
It's hard to forget ya  
  
[Chorus]  
Something about ya  
It's hard to forget ya  
We're stuck here forever  
Something about ya, 'bout ya  
Something about ya  
It's hard to forget ya  
We're stuck here forever  
Something about ya, 'bout ya (something about you)  
It's just so hard to forget ya  
It's just so hard to forget ya  
It's just so hard to forget ya  
Something about ya, 'bout ya (oh)  
It's just so hard to forget ya  
It's just so hard to forget ya  
It's just so hard to forget ya  
Something about ya, 'bout ya
