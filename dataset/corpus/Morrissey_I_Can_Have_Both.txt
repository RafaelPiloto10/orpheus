Staring in the window of the shop that never opens  
Planning my selection from all the treats inside  
Should I take as I desire - oh shall I, oh shall I ?  
Or should I hang around to be enticed inside ?  
  
I'm trying to explain to myself  
I can have both  
I'm trying to explain to the voice inside  
I can have both  
I can have both  
There's nobody around to say no  
Who've brain-washed the small shy boy inside  
He doesn't know he can have both  
  
Smiling through the window to the one who never serves you  
I've not been feeling myself tonight  
Should I take as I feel like it - well shall I, oh shall I ?  
Or should I wait and hope to be dragged inside ?  
Oh...  
  
I'm trying to explain to myself  
I can have both  
I'm trying to explain to the voice inside  
I can have both  
I can have both  
There's nobody around to say no  
Who've brain-washed the small shy boy inside  
He doesn't know he can have both  
  
I can have both  
There's no need to choose  
Because  
I can have both  
There's no need to choose  
I can have both  
There's no need to choose  
Because  
I can have both  
There's no need to choose  
I can have both  
There's no need to choose
