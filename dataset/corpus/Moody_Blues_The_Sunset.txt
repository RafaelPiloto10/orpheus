When the sun goes down,  
And the clouds all frown,  
Night has begun for the sunset.  
See it with your eyes,  
Earth re-energized  
By the sun's rays every day.  
Take a look out there,  
Planets everywhere.  
When the sun goes down  
And the clouds all frown,  
Night has begun for the sunset.  
Shadows on the ground  
Never make a sound,  
Fading away in the sunset.  
Night has now become  
Day for everyone.  
  
I can see it all  
From this great height.  
I can feel the sun  
Slipping out of sight  
And the world still goes on  
Through the night.
