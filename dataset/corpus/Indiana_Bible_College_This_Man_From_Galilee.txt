Chorus  
There will never be another man like Jesus  
There will never be another man like Him  
There will never be one who can save us  
Like the man from Galilee  
  
Verse 1  
He was the Savior  
The Lord and Mighty King  
Creator of the universe  
Ruler of everything  
But He came so lowly  
That this world could not believe  
I tell you He's the one  
He's the Son of God  
This man from Galilee  
  
Verse 2  
He had all power  
This man from Galilee  
With a mighty voice  
He just spoke the word  
And calmed the raging sea  
Never has there been a man  
With such divine authority  
I tell He's the one  
He's the only one  
This man from Galilee  
  
Bridge  
You ought to know the man called Jesus  
The Lamb of God who was sent to free us  
Mighty and righteous is He  
This man from Galilee  
  
Vamp  
He wasn't just a man He was Lord and King  
The Savior of the world  
He was deity  
His name is Jesus  
This man from Galilee
