How many times do I have to say  
To get away-get gone  
Flip your shit past another lasses  
Humble dwelling  
You got your game, made your shot  
And you got away with a lot  
But I'm not turned on  
So put away that meat your selling  
'Cause I do know what's good for me  
  
And I've done what I could for you  
But you're not benefiting, and yet I'm sitting  
Singing again, sing, sing again  
How can I deal with this,  
If he won't get with this  
Am I gonna heal from this  
He won't admit to it  
Nothing to figure out  
I gotta get him out  
It's about time the truth was out  
That he don't give a shit about me  
  
How many times can it escalate  
'Til it elevates to place I can't breathe  
And I must decide, if you must deride  
That I'm much obliged to up and go  
I'll idealize ,  
Then realize that it's no sacrifice  
Because the price is paid  
And there's nothing left to grieve  
Fuckin' go  
  
'Cause I've done what I could for you  
But you're not benefiting, and yet I'm sitting  
Singing again, sing, sing again  
How can I deal with this,  
If he won't get with this  
Am I gonna heal from this  
He won't admit to it  
Nothing to figure out  
I gotta get him out  
It's about time the truth was out  
That he don't give a shit about me
