Watching raindrops, slowly falling  
Painting pictures on the window pane  
Feelings my heart cannot explain  
Oh the silence, sounds like music  
Seems like I can hear a melody  
Baby that's what you do to me  
  
(chorus):  
One thing I'm sure of  
Whether it's wrong or it's right  
I only want to be with you, tonight  
And if you want me to  
Baby ask me to stay  
Heaven's just a whisper away  
  
Feel the magic, taking over  
Please don't stop before we lose control  
Baby just let your feeling go  
Soft and tender, like the morning  
We get closer than we've ever been  
We're almost to the rainbow's end  
  
(chorus):  
I heard the winds of forever  
Calling out my name  
It's paradise, when I'm with you  
I will never be the same  
  
Please don't wake me if I'm dreaming  
'cause this time, this one is coming true  
So glad to share my dreams with you  
  
(chorus
