Kenny:  
You know that restaurant on highway 1  
With the key lime pie that song the sand and the sun  
Where we ran in our barefeet  
Built a castle on the beach  
Just the wind, the rocks, the waves and you and me  
  
Chorus:  
I can't go there  
'cause that's just too much us  
I can't go there  
I still feel your touch  
There's places in my heart and here that feel as empty  
As our bed  
So most nights I don't even walk upstairs  
'cause I can't go there  
  
Remember San Francisco on that cable car  
Our reflection in the window of that store  
How we danced the night away  
With the lights out on the bay  
Then wound up in a blanket on the floor  
  
Chorus:  
I can't go there  
'cause friscos too much us  
I can't go there  
I still feel your touch  
Now there's places in my heart and here that  
Still feel as empty as our bed  
So most nights I don't even walk upstairs  
'cause I can't go there  
  
If it was only florida or California  
Maybe I could let myself move on  
But it's everywhere we've been  
And everywhere I turn  
I can't love again  
'cause I've learned  
  
That I can't go there  
Its somethin I can't do  
I can't go there  
I'll run into you  
I can't go there  
  
Tim Mcgraw:  
When the sun shines, when it rains  
Christmas partys, football games  
  
Kenny: I can't go there  
  
Tim: Winter, summer, fall or spring  
I see you in everything  
  
I can't go there..  
Its too much us  
I can't go there
