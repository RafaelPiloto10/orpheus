Sometimes it hurts clear to the core  
When we lose all we've cared for  
The hunger and thirst for love that endures is never ending.  
  
What will I do with my life?  
Try to share it with somebody new?  
And how can I learn to disguise that I'm lost without you.  
  
All I have left is a heart full of mirrors  
A heart full of voices reminding me that it's over... girl it's over  
I'll hear it echo deep inside  
'Til the other end of time  
The other end of time.  
  
Left over dreams fade in my mind  
And I'm counting on this love to die  
'cause all that I need is to give my whole life a new beginning.  
  
But something is holding me down  
Like I'm under a mountain of stone  
And all I can hear is the sound of my own heart breaking.  
  
'Cause all I have left is a heart full of mirrors  
A heart full of voices reminding me that it's over, girl it's over  
I'll hear it echo deep inside  
'Til the other end of time.  
'Til the other end of time.  
  
'Cause all I have left is a heart full of mirrors  
A heart full of voices reminding me that it's over, girl it's over  
I'll hear it echo deep inside.  
  
All I have left is a heart full of mirrors  
A heart full of voices reminding me that it's over, girl it's over  
I'll hear it echo deep inside  
'Til the other end of time  
'Til the other end of time.
