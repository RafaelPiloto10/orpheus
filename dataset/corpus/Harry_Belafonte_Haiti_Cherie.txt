Haiti Cherie, says Haiti is my beloved land  
Oh I never knew that I have to leave you to understand  
Just how much I miss the gallant Citadel,  
Where days long ago, brave men served this country well.  
Where sun is bright, or evening with soft moonlight  
Shading tree, Creole maiden for company  
A gentle breeze, a warm caress if you please  
Work, laughter and play, yes we'll always be this way  
Haiti Cherie, now I've returned to your soil so dear  
Let me hear again, the things that give music to my ear.  
The lone shepherd's horn that welcomes the rising morn  
When roads overflow as crowds to Iron market go.  
Where sun is bright, or evening with soft moonlight  
Shading tree, Creole maiden for company  
A gentle breeze, a warm caress if you please  
Work, laughter and play, yes we'll always be this way
