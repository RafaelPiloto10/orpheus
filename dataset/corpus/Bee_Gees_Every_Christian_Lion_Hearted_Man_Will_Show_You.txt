Oh solo Dominique [Repeat: x4]  
  
Take this in hand  
Said he who stands  
Behind the chair  
A broken table there  
  
Every christian lion hearted man will show you  
Every christian lion hearted man will show you  
  
Oh solo Dominique [Repeat: x4]  
  
Don't walk so tall  
Before you crawl  
  
For every child  
Is thinking of something wild  
  
Every christian lion hearted man will show you  
Every christian lion hearted man will show you  
  
Oh solo Dominique [Repeat: x3]  
  
Every christian lion hearted man will show you  
Every christian lion hearted man will show you (will show you)  
  
Oh solo Dominique [Repeat: x3]
