Who? S she  
Blowing kisses from the catwalk  
Tell me  
I really gotta - know!  
  
Since when  
Did you need another girlfriend?  
Since when?  
I really gotta - know!  
  
She? S been fakin? Since day one  
A friendly kiss includes no tongue  
Who? S she - Tell me  
Now she? S sleeping in my bed  
Oh God I wish that she was dead  
I need to know - who? S the Bimbo?  
  
Who? S she  
Looking goofy in a Gucci-dress  
What? S that  
I really gotta - know!  
  
Wich bone  
In her body should I break first?  
Wich one?  
The Bimbo? S gotta - go!  
  
I know - it? S sad  
Sometimes I just loose my head  
Boy I am getting so mad
