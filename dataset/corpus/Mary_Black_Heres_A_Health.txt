Kind friends and companions, come join me in rhyme  
Come lift up your voices in chorus with mine  
Let us drink and be merry, all grief to refrain  
For we may and might never all meet here again  
  
Here's a health to the company and one to my lass  
Let us drink and be merry all out of one glass  
Let us drink and be merry, all grief to refrain  
For we may and might never all meet here again  
  
Here's a health to the dear lass that I love so well  
Her style and her beauty, sure none can excel  
There's a smile upon her countenance as she sits on my knee  
Sure there's no one in in this wide world as happy as we  
  
Our ship lies at harbor, she's ready to dock  
I hope she's safe landed without any shock  
If ever we should meet again by land or by sea  
I will always remember your kindness to me
