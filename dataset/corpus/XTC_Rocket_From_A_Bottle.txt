Birds beware, expect me up there  
Me and air are feeling light today  
Jets should hide, I'll fly alongside  
Me and pride are bolted tight today  
  
I've been set off by a pretty little girl  
  
I'm like a rocket from a bottle shot free  
I've been just explosive since you lit me  
I've been up with the larks  
I've been shooting off sparks  
  
And I'm feeling in love  
  
I'm a rocket from a bottle shot free  
I've been just explosive since you kissed me  
I've been up in the clouds  
I've been shrugging off shrouds  
  
And I'm feeling in love  
  
Hate step back, my smile might just crack  
Can't stop grins from going wide today  
Hell look sharp, angels play your harp  
I feel strong like the tide today
