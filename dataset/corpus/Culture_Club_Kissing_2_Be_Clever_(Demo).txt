Saved by this parade of passion was my company  
Gave my life for next to nothing a sane artillery  
Is one that kisses 2 be clever, who is the enemy?  
It's not me, not me, not you, not me  
  
Saved by this persuade like passion, sexuality  
Gave my heart like fate was nothing, a sane reality  
Is one that wishes never, never, what is reality  
Show me, show me, show me  
  
Sail on a sea of Pepsi Cola shaken at sunrise  
Kiss the boy and then employ a very white disguise  
Who had asked you to consider, you are not so fly  
In the city they will snigger, ask them why  
  
Saved by this parade of passion was my company  
Gave my life for next to nothing, a sane artillery  
Is one that kisses 2 be clever, who is the enemy?  
It's not me, not me, no, not you, not me  
It's not you, not me, no, not you then who?
