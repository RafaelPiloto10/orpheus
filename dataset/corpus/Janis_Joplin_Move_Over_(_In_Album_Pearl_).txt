You say that it's over baby, Lord,  
You say that it's over now,  
But still you hang around me, come on,  
Won't you move over.  
You know that I need a man, honey Lord,  
You know that I need a man,  
But when I ask you to you just tell me  
That maybe you can.  
Please dontcha do it to me babe, no!  
Please dontcha do it to me baby,  
Either take this love I offer  
Or honey let me be.  
I ain't quite a ready for walking, no no no no,  
I ain't quite a ready for walking,  
And whatcha gonna do with your life,  
Life all just dangling ?

Oh yeah, make up your mind, honey,  
You're playing with me, hey hey hey,  
Make up your mind, darling,  
You're playing with me, come on now!  
Now either be my loving man,  
I said-a let me honey, let me be, yeah!  
You say that it's over, baby, no,  
You say that it's over now,  
But still you hang around me, come on  
Won't you move over.  
You know that I need a man, honey, I told you so.  
You know that I need a man,  
But when I ask you to you just tell me  
That maybe you can.  
Hey! Please dontcha do it to me, babe, no!  
Please dontcha do it to me baby,  
Either take this love I offer,  
Honey let me be.  
I said won't you, won't you let me be ?  
Honey, you're teasing me.  
Yeah, you're playing with my heart, dear,  
I believe you're toying with my affections, honey.  
I can't take it no more baby,  
And furthermore, I don't intend to.  
I'm just tired of hanging from the end of a string, honey,  
You expect me to fight like a goddamned mule.  
Wah, wah, wah, wah, honey...
