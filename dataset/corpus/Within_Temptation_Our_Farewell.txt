In my hands a legacy of memories  
I can hear you say my name  
I can almost see your smile  
Feel the warmth of your embrace  
But there is nothing but silence now  
Around the one I loved  
Is this our farewell?  
  
Sweet darling you worry too much  
My child, see the sadness in your eyes  
You are not alone in life  
Although you might think that you are  
  
Never thought this day would come so soon  
We had no time to say goodbye  
How can the world just carry on?  
I feel so lost when you are not by my side  
But there is nothing but silence now  
Around the one I loved  
Is this our farewell?  
  
So sorry your world is tumbling down  
I will watch you through these nights  
Rest your head and go to sleep  
Because my child this is not our farewell  
This is not our farewell
