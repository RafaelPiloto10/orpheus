No promises, no guarantees  
When you come down here  
You're already on your knees  
You want to ride White Lightnin'  
Then sign your name  
If you want to dance with the devil  
You gotta play his way, play the game  
You gotta taste that sweetness  
Cause you can't say no  
But are you ready for the nightmare  
When you can't let go  
Like a soldier of fortune  
When the money runs dry  
You got rivers of bitter tears, in your eyes  
  
You want to leave but you can't let go  
You want to stop but you can't say no  
You'll never laugh about it  
You just can't live without it  
You had enough but you just want more  
You never get what you're lookin' for  
You'll never laugh about it, never  
  
You got both ends burning  
You're like a moth to a flame  
You're going off the rails  
Like a runaway train  
It's a no-win situation  
And there's no way out  
And no one will ever hear you, scream and shout  
  
You want to leave but you can't let go  
You want to stop but you can't say no  
You'll never laugh about it  
You just can't live without it  
You had enough but you just want more  
You never get what you're lookin' for  
You'll never laugh about it, never  
  
Run, he's coming to claim you  
Run, nowhere to hide away  
Run, oh, you dance with danger  
Run, oh, you gotta ride the  
  
[Chorus]  
White Lightnin'  
On a dead end street  
White Lightnin'  
Where the deadbeats meet  
White Lightnin'  
It's a one-way ride  
White Lightnin'  
Oh, there's nowhere to hide  
Such a lonely road you ride  
It's not easy when you don't know why  
Such a heavy load you hide  
You never leave no matter how you try  
  
Run, he's coming to claim you  
Run, nowhere to hide away  
Run, you dance with danger  
Run, oh, you gotta ride the  
  
[Chorus]  
  
White Lightning  
Can you feel it, can you feel it?  
White Lightning  
It's so dangerous  
White Lightning  
No promises, no guarantees  
White Lightning  
When you come down here  
You're already on your knees
