Uh, Good morning  
  
Wake up, Mr. West, Mr. West, Mr. Fresh  
Mr. by-his-self-he-so-impressed  
I mean, damn, did you even see the test  
You got D's motherfucker, D's, Rosie Perez  
And yes, barely pass any and every class  
Lookin' at every ass  
Cheated on every test  
I guess this is my dissertation  
Homie, this shit is basic  
Welcome to graduation  
  
Good morning  
Good morning  
Good morning  
Good morning  
  
Good morning  
  
On this day we become legendary  
Everything we dreamed of  
I'm like a fly Malcolm X  
Buy any jeans necessary  
Detroit wear cleaned up  
From the streets of the league  
From an eighth to a key  
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets  
From the moments of pain  
Look how far we done came  
Haters sayin' ya changed  
Now ya doin' ya thang  
  
Good morning  
Good morning  
  
Good morning  
Good morning  
  
Good morning  
Look at the valedictorian scared of the future  
While I hop in the Delorean  
Scared-to-face-the-world complacent career student  
Some people graduate, but we still stupid  
They tell you read this, eat this, don't look around  
Just peep this, preach us, teach us, Jesus  
Okay, look up now, they done stole your streetness  
After all of that, you receive this  
  
Good morning  
Hustlers, that's if you're still livin'  
Get on down  
Every time that we hear them  
Good morning  
Hustlers, that's if you're still livin'  
Get on down  
Every time that we hear them  
Good morning  
Hustlers, that's if you're still livin'  
Get on down  
Every time that we hear them  
Good morning  
Hustlers, that's if you're still livin'  
Get on down  
  
Get on down  
Get, get on down  
Get on down  
Get, get on down
