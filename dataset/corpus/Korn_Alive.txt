I cannot ever find a way  
To throw these darkened thoughts away  
Need a place to hide  
It's thrown in my face everyday  
Guess that's the price I have to pay  
For what's inside my mind  
  
Alive!  
Alive!  
Alive!  
Alive!  
Alive!  
Alive!  
Alive!  
Alive!  
  
I am alive  
I will never run away  
Places inside  
My heart screams inside with pride  
Once I cried  
Now I wipe away the tears  
Once I died  
Now I'm alive  
  
Alive!  
Alive!  
Alive!  
Alive!  
Alive!  
Alive!  
Alive!  
Alive!  
  
Little things tempt me everyday  
Contemplating's how I like to play  
Better not cross that line  
What's this in my head I didn't say  
It's something I can't throw away  
What's inside my mind  
  
I am alive  
I will never run away  
Places inside  
My heart screams inside with pride  
Once I cried  
Now I wipe away the tears  
Once I died  
Now I'm alive  
  
I bide my time  
I'm intertwined  
I'm falling in this place  
I thought I left behind x2  
  
I bide my time  
I'm intertwined  
I'm falling in this place  
I thought I left behind  
(Feeling so alive)  
(Feeling so alive)  
  
Alive!  
Alive!  
Alive!  
Alive!  
  
I am alive  
I will never run away  
Places inside  
My heart screams inside with pride  
Once I cried  
Now I wipe away the tears  
Once I died  
Now I'm alive
