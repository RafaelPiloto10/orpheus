I really, I really  
Oh, I really need to know  
I really, I really  
Oh, or else you gotta let me go  
I really, I really  
  
This time I really need to do things right  
Shivers that ya give me keep me freezing all night  
You make me, shudder, oh yeah  
I can't believe it,  
I'm not myself,  
Suddenly I'm thinkin' of 'bout no one else  
You make me shudder  
  
I really  
Oh I really need to know  
Or else you gotta let me go  
  
Your just a fantasy girl  
It's an impossible world  
All I want is just you and me always  
I'll give you everything  
Give some attention to me  
All I want is just you and me always  
  
Give me affection  
I need your perfection  
'Cause you feel so good  
You make me stutter, stutter, oh  
  
If I could touch you, I'd never let go  
Now ya got me screaming and I cannot shut up, oh, shut up, yeah  
Now I am lying on the bedroom floor barely even speaking  
And I cannot get up  
Oh I really, I really, I really need to know  
Or else you gotta let me go  
  
Your just a fantasy girl  
It's an impossible world  
All I want is to be with you always  
I'll give you everything  
Give some attention to me  
All I want is just you and me always  
Give me affection  
I need your perfection  
'Cause you feel so good  
You make me stutter, stutter, stutter  
  
You knock me down, I can't get up, I'm stuck  
Gotta stop shaking me up  
I can't eat, can't sleep, can't think,  
Sinking under  
Sinking under  
  
Your just a fantasy girl  
It's an impossible world  
All I want is to be with you always  
I'll give you everything  
Give some attention to me  
All I want is just you and me always  
  
Your just a fantasy girl  
It's an impossible world  
All I want is to be with you always  
  
Give me affection  
I need your perfection  
'Cause you feel so good  
You make me stutter  
  
You make me stutter (I really, I really)  
You make me stutter (I really, I really)  
You make me stutter (I really, I really)
