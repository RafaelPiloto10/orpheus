Feelings  
Nothing more  
Than feelings  
Trying to forget my  
Feelings of love  
Teardrops  
Rolling down on my face  
Trying to forget my  
Feelings of love  
  
Feelings  
For all my life  
I'll feel it  
I wish  
I've never met you, girl  
You'll never come again  
  
Feelings, feelings  
Feel you  
Again in my arms  
  
Feelings  
Feelings  
Like I've never lost you  
And feelings  
Like I've never have you  
Again in my heart  
  
Feelings  
For all my life  
I'll feel it  
I wish  
I've never met you, girl  
You'll never come again  
  
Feelings  
Feelings  
Like I've never lost you  
And feelings  
Like I've never have you  
Again in my life  
  
Feelings, feelings  
Feelings  
Again in my arms  
Feelings
