I gotta get myself far, far away  
I gotta tell myself that anyway  
I can't forget the way that we used to be  
And all in all it seems so different to me  
  
I said whoa oh Rosalie, I said whoa my Rosalie  
Oh every time I see her I have to stop  
And everybody says you are the cream of the crop  
But if you're looking angry in any way  
I don't believe I?d stand in your way  
I want a lonely carriage with roses on  
A funny love affair, a funny way to go home  
I won't change for you, you haven't changed for me  
I don't suppose you'd have an answer for me?  
  
I've been around this place for quite a time  
I've been around just feeling really fine  
I can't believe I feel like nothing today  
And I don't feel too much anyway
