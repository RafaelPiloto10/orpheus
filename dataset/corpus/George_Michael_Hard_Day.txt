Don't bring me down  
Don't bring me down  
Don't bring me down  
  
I've never been one for playing games  
You can move your mouth forever  
But the words sound just the same  
Something like  
Bang bang you're dead  
Couldn't we just make love instead  
Say yes 'cause it's what we do best  
And I've had such a hard day  
  
Take me where their eyes can't find us  
Without you I may as well just  
  
How much do I have to say  
What more do you have to see  
What will it take to make you love me  
Oh well you're not the first  
You're not the last  
You're not even the one who loves me the best  
But all I think about is you  
  
Take me where their eyes can't find us  
Without you I may as well just  
  
Take me where their eyes can't find us  
Without you I may as well just  
  
Don't bring me down  
Don't bring me down  
Don't bring me down  
  
Please don't wander from my door  
I've never been one for playing games  
You can move your mouth forever  
But the words sound just the same  
Ow  
Bang bang you're dead  
Couldn't we just make love instead  
Say yes because it's what we do best  
And I've had such a hard day  
  
So don't bring me down  
Won't you give me break  
Somebody give me a break now!  
  
Don't bring me down  
Don't bring me down  
Don't bring me down  
  
Sweet little boy with oh such a big mouth  
Harsh words can get you into hot water  
When people don't understand you baby  
I'm always here for you  
And I  
And I will never bring you down, down, down, down  
Down my baby  
  
Trust me  
I want you to trust me  
Oh, oh trust me  
'Cause I won't bring you down  
(Don't bring me down)  
I won't bring you down  
Do you trust me  
Yeah
