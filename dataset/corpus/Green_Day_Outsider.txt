I'm an outsider  
Outside of everything  
I'm an outsider  
Outside of everything  
I'm an outsider  
Outside of everything  
Everything you know  
Everything you know  
It disturbs me so  
Everybody tried to push me  
Push me around  
Everybody tried to put me  
Try to put me down  
All messed up, hey everyone  
I've already had all my fun  
More troubles are gonna come  
I've already had all my fun  
Everybody tried to push me  
Push me around  
Everybody tried to put me  
Try to put me down  
I'm an outsider  
Outside of everything  
I'm an outsider  
Outside of everything  
I'm an outsider  
Outside of everything  
Everything you know  
Everything you know  
  
It disturbs me so
