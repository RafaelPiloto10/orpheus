We're living in the land of make-believe  
And trying not to let it show  
Maybe in that land of make-believe  
Heartaches can turn into joy.  
We're breathing in the smoke of high and low  
We're taking up a lot of room  
Somewhere in the dark and silent night  
Our prayer will be heard, make it soon.  
So fly little bird  
Up into the clear blue sky  
And carry the word  
Love's the only reason why, why.  
OPen up the shutters on your windows  
Unlock all the locks upon your doors  
Brush away the cobwebs from your day-dreams  
No secrets come between us any more  
Oh say it's true  
Only love will see you through  
You know what love can do to you.
