Don't spend your life like a dime  
I thought you are not for hire  
Stand for your rights - don't look at the past  
I don't know - I don't care - my brain's  
spinning 'round like a wheel  
  
Don't feel like a stranger  
Don't feel like a stranger  
  
So turn around leave your feelings behind  
Just calm down keep the devil inside  
It's like a stone lying in your head  
You never know - this time it could be real  
  
And then you'll realize  
Maybe you're wrong this time  
Do something in your life  
And then it'll work out  
  
Don't feel like a stranger  
Everything can be real  
Don't feel like a stranger  
Move on like a wheel  
  
So you don't know - what is the reason  
It's up to you to sell your life so easy  
I thought you were learning from the past  
Can't you feel deep inside when you're breaking the chains  
  
And then you'll realize  
Maybe you're wrong this time  
Do something in your life  
And then it'll work out  
  
Don't feel like a stranger  
Everything can be real  
Don't you know you're in danger  
Move on like a wheel  
  
And when it works out  
Don't turn around  
Something is in your heart  
So let it free - oh yeah  
  
Oh yeah  
Don't feel like a stranger  
Listen to me - everything can be real  
Don't feel like a stranger  
Move on like a wheel  
  
Don't feel like a stranger  
Everything can be so real  
Don't you know you're in danger  
Move on like a wheel  
  
Don't feel like a stranger...
