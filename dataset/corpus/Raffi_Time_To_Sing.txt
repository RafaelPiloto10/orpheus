It's time to sing a song or two  
You with me and me with you  
Time for us to sing a while  
Hey hey hey  
  
It's time for us to clap our hands  
In rhythm with the beat  
Time for hands to clap awhile  
Hey hey hey  
  
And it's time for saying hi and hello (Hi Raffi)  
Let's all sing a song that we know  
  
It's time for us to tap our toes  
Together with our feet  
  
Time for toes to tap awhile  
Hey hey hey  
  
And it's time for saying hi and hello (Hi Raffi)  
Let's all sing a song that we know  
  
It's time to make a sound you like  
Brr brr brr brr brr brr brr  
Scootily yop bob be ba ba  
Bop bop diddly dee  
  
It's time to sing a song or two  
You with me and me with you  
Time for us to sing a while  
Hey hey hey  
  
I'm singing hey hey hey  
We're singing hey, hey hey hey
