Congratulations  
And celebrations  
When I tell everyone that you're in love  
With me  
Congratulations  
And jubilations  
I want the world to know I'm happy as can be.  
  
Who could believe that I could be happy and  
Contented  
I used to think that happiness hadn't been  
Invented  
But that was in the bad old days before  
I met you  
When I let you  
Walk into my heart  
  
Congratulations  
  
I was afraid that maybe you thought you  
Were above me  
That I was only fooling myself to think you  
Loved me  
But then tonight you said you couldn't live  
Without me  
That round about me  
You wanted to stay  
  
Congratulations  
Congratulations  
And jubilations  
I want the world to know I'm happy as can be  
I want the world to know  
I'm happy as can be
