Cheers  
Thanks for everything  
You hung me out by my heart  
You're just so selfish jean  
Yes you are  
  
Hey you  
Threw it all away  
By holding everything in  
Hey Jean don't rock the boat  
When you can't swim  
  
With a perfect understanding of the finer things in life  
A quite alarming knack of knowing when to twist the knife  
Ooh  
Selfish Jean  
  
Here's to you  
Who read everything  
Left it out on the shelf  
There's no one else to blame  
Except yourself  
  
Well a perfect combination of good etiquet and charm  
You keep the chocolate biscuits wired to a car alarm  
Ooh  
Selfish Jean  
  
Well I'm standing on my own  
And this house is not a home  
It's so sad to see you go  
Things are high, things are low  
And it's good to know you know  
If you've got nowhere to go  
Well you could spend the night with me  
There will be no guarantee that I'll be here  
  
In the morning  
Or any time that you call  
I hear you snoring Jean  
Through the wall  
  
So hey  
Here's to everything  
To peace and love in our time  
Ah Jean the slate is clean  
I guess we're fine  
  
Well I don't expect a miracle  
Not asking you to change  
If you can see me happy  
Well just look the other way  
Ooh  
Selfish Jean  
  
Heah  
Selfish Jean  
  
Jean  
Oh yeah  
Jean
