I see a red door and I want it painted black,  
No colors anymore I want them to turn black.  
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes,  
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes.  
  
I see a line of cars and they're all painted black,  
With flowers and my love, both never to come back.  
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away,  
Like a new born baby it just happens ev'ry day.  
  
I look inside myself and see my heart is black,  
I see my red door and I want it painted black.  
  
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts,  
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black.  
  
No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue,  
I could not forsee this thing happening to you.  
  
If I look hard enough into the setting sun,  
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes.  
  
I see a red door and I want it painted black,  
No colors anymore I want them to turn black.  
  
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes,  
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes.  
  
I want to see your face painted black, black as night.  
Don't want to see the sun flyin' high in the sky.  
I want to see it painted, painted, painted, painted black, yeah!
