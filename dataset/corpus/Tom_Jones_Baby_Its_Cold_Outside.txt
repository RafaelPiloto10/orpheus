I really can't stay  
But baby, it?s cold outside  
I've got to go away  
Ahh, baby, it?s cold outside  
  
This evening has been  
Been hoping that you'd drop in  
So very nice  
I?ll hold your hands, they're just like ice  
  
My mother will start to worry  
Beautiful, what's your hurry  
My father will be pacing the floor  
Listen to that fireplace roar  
  
So really I?d better scurry  
Oh beautiful, please don't hurry  
Maybe just a half a drink more  
Why don't you put some records on while I pour  
  
The neighbors might think  
Oh baby, it?s bad out there  
Say, what's in this drink  
There's no cabs to be had out there  
  
I wish I knew how  
Your eyes are like starlight now  
To break this spell  
I?ll take your hat, your hair looks well  
  
I ought to say no, no, no, sir  
Mind if I move a little closer  
At least there'll be, oh, that I tried  
What's the sense of hurting my pride  
  
I really can't stay  
Baby, don't hold out  
Ahh, but it?s cold outside  
Yeah  
  
I simply must go  
Oh, baby, it?s cold outside  
The answer is no  
You know it?s cold outside  
  
This welcome has been  
I'm lucky that you dropped in  
So nice and warm  
Look out the window at that storm  
  
My sister will be suspicious  
Oh, your lips look delicious  
My brother will be there at the door  
Like waves upon a tropical shore  
  
My maiden aunt?s mind is vicious  
Eww, your lips are delicious  
Well maybe just a cigarette more  
Never such a blizzard before  
  
I've got to go home  
Ahh, baby, you would freeze out there  
Say, lend me a comb  
You know it?s up to your knees out there  
  
You've really been grand  
I thrill when you touch my hand  
But don't you see?  
How can you do this thing to me  
  
there's bound to be talk tomorrow  
Making my life long sorrow  
At least there will be plenty implied  
If you caught pneumonia and died  
  
I really can't stay  
Get over and hold out  
Ahh, but it?s cold outside, yeah  
  
Bloody, freezin' ain't it
