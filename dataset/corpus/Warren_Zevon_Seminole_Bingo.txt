I'm a junk bond king  
And I'm on the run  
Me and a friend of mine  
We were headed for the sunshine  
I got my hands on the wheel  
I got gas in the tank  
I got a suitcase full of money  
From a Luxembourg bank  
We didn't stop 'til we got to Big Cypress  
Wandered in to the Legion Hall  
The sign outside said "Seminole Bingo"  
Fell in love with the ping pong balls  
And the SEC is far behind  
Down in the swamp with the gators and flamingos  
A long way from Liechtenstein  
I'm a junk bond king playing Seminole Bingo  
And my Wall Street wiles  
Don't help me even slightly  
'Cause I never have the numbers  
And I'm losing nightly  
I cashed in the last of my Triple be bonds  
Bought a double-wide on the Tamiami Trail  
I parked it right outside the reservation  
Fifteen minutes from the Collier County Jail  
And the SEC is far behind  
Down in the swamp with the gators and flamingos  
A long way from Liechtenstein  
I'm a junk bond king playing Seminole Bingo  
Well, the SEC is far behind  
Down in the swamp with the gators and flamingos  
A long way from Liechtenstein  
I'm a junk bond king playing Seminole Bingo
