When I told my baby  
Do what you wanna do  
Well I had no idea  
Just what she'd put me through  
  
Every night she's runnin' 'round  
Singin' songs in your hometown  
There ain't no one to love me  
When the sun goes down  
  
[Chorus]  
Well, she's everybody's sweetheart  
Everybody's sweetheart but mine  
I shoulda kept her barefoot  
Barefoot and pregnant all the time  
I used to be the first in line  
Now I've fallen way behind  
She's everybody's sweetheart  
Everybody's sweetheart but mine  
  
All that country club money  
Lord it sure looked good to me, yeah it did  
Playin' golf with those fat cats  
How much better could life be  
They all think I've got it made  
They see your face on every page  
Of every magazine  
Across the USA  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you see her tell her hi  
And everything will be all right  
Tell her that I love her  
'Til the day I die  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Come on home
