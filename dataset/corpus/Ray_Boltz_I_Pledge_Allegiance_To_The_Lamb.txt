I pledge allegiance to the Lamb  
With all my strength, with all I am  
I will seek to honor His commands  
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb  
  
I have heard how Christians long ago  
Were brought before a tyrant's throne  
They were told that he would spare their lives  
If they would renounce the name of Christ  
But one by one they chose to die  
The Son of God they would not deny  
Like a great angelic choir sings  
I can almost hear their voices ring  
  
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb  
With all my strength, with all I am  
I will seek to honor His commands  
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb  
  
Now the years have come, and the years have gone  
But the cause of Jesus still goes on  
Now our time has come to count the cost  
To reject this world, to embrace the cross  
And one by one let us live our lives  
For the one who died to give us life  
Till the trumpet sounds on the final day  
Let us proudly stand and boldly say  
  
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb  
With all my strength, with all I am  
I will seek to honor His commands  
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb  
  
To the Lamb of God who bore my pain  
Who took my place, who wore my shame  
I will seek to honor His commands  
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb  
  
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb  
With all my strength, with all I am  
I will seek to honor His commands  
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb
