I'm tired out, my head is aching  
I want to shout, but I feel I'm goin' nowhere  
Yeah, I feel I'm goin' nowhere  
I've run about in a fit of madness  
To work it out in the hope of goin' somewhere  
Yeah I hope I'm goin' somewhere  
  
And I know it must be time for me making up my mind  
Does it matter if I'm fine? It'll change my tune in time  
If I'm really goin' nowhere  
  
I'm better now, I've thought about it  
Can't figure out, but I'm looking for it somewhere  
All I know is that it's somewhere  
It's closer now than I've ever had it  
Much closer now, so I must be getting somewhere  
Yeah, I hope I'm getting somewhere  
  
'Cause you never know, in time with the changing of my mind  
I could turn around and say that was just another day  
Am I really goin' nowhere?
