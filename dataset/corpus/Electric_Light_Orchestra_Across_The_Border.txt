In the heat of the day many miles away  
When the sun is beating down upon the main street  
I'll be waiting here at the station,  
I gotta move down the line.  
  
They'll be dancin' and singin' and doin' their thing  
And they'll be rockin' and rollin' until the day is done.  
You know I got to make the deadline.  
  
I gotta get that southbound train tonight,  
If I don't get to the border then I'll write.  
  
The Mardi Gras will be blowing strong  
And the people dancing all across the city.  
I'm leaving here tonight,  
Gotta move down the line.  
  
I'm gonna catch a ride on the 9:05,  
I'm gonna ride the rails until we reach the morning,  
maybe three or four hundred miles.  
  
I gotta get that southbound train tonight,  
If I don't get to the border then I'll write.  
  
When the wind is blowing  
Softly through the streets  
Of a little town and the music's playin  
You're waiting somewhere over the horizon.  
  
I gotta get that southbound train tonight, ooh.  
If I don't get to the border then I'll write.
