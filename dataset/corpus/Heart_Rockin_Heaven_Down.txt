Step into the light  
Your on  
Hook into the night  
That look from eye to eye  
A flash gets passed around  
A band of wild angels  
Rockin' heaven down  
  
Roll, roll, roll  
Roll out the soul  
You get that feel  
And everybody knows  
You're moving their minds  
Moving their minds around  
Rockin' heaven  
Rockin' heaven down  
  
You step into the night  
On your way back home  
What a scene it was tonight  
I'm so glad I'm not alone  
  
That look in your eye  
Makes me come unwound  
Come on baby let's go  
Rockin' heaven down  
  
Roll, roll, roll  
Roll out the soul  
You get that feel  
and everybody knows  
  
You're moving their minds  
Moving around  
Rockin' heaven down  
Rockin' heaven down  
  
Rock me home  
Rock me home
