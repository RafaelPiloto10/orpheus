God only knows this isn't heaven.  
The promises made, we never keep them.  
  
Chorus:  
We're walking on air, we're taking our time.  
But God only knows this isn't reason or rhyme.  
  
I've had this feeling I don't believe in.  
It's happened before, I just reject it.  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
These are the feelings, I know their outcome.  
It's useless pretending, I'd like to beat them.  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
We're walking on air, we're taking our time, this time.  
But God only knows, this isn't reason or rhyme.  
  
We're walking on air...
