Let there be love, so I can be loved by you  
In Paradise Avenue  
Let there be life, so everyone lives to love  
Let it happen to me and you  
  
I am a man, so take me for what I am  
I'll never have everything, but let there be love  
Let there be love, let there be love  
  
I can be nothing, I can be something  
I've got to give you my life  
I'm tired of living without your giving  
I've got to get you for my wife  
  
Feeling's getting stronger  
Can't hold on much longer  
I never begged, but I'm begging now  
  
Let there be love, so I can be loved by you  
On Paradise Avenue, oh yo  
Let there be life, so we can live to love  
And let it be both of us  
  
I am a man, so take me for what I am  
I'll never have everything, but let there be love  
Let there be love, let there be love
