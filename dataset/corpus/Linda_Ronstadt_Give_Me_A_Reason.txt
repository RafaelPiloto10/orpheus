Just give me a reason why we fuss and fight  
Give me a reason why I have to spend these lonely nights  
Is there a reason why you fall for other girls  
When I thought I was the number one, baby, in your world  
  
Give me a reason why you make me cry  
Is there a reason why I have to spend these lonely nights  
Tell me the reason why you tour around the world  
And why in God's name you want to make me into your clown  
  
Even though, baby, you did me wrong now, baby  
The feeling inside of me, baby is, oh, so strong  
I've tried in a million ways to make you happy  
But I keep on wondering, do you love me  
  
Give me a reason  
I need a reason  
Is there a reason  
  
If I give you the chance I know you would leave me now, baby  
After all we've been through, our plans about tomorrow  
You've broken my heart, baby, you've ruined my soul  
Is there a chance for me, tell me or let me go  
  
Give me a reason why we fuss and fight  
Is there a reason why I have to spend these lonely nights  
Tell me the reason why you fall for other girls  
When I thought I was the number one, baby, in your world  
  
Just give me a reason why you make me cry  
Is there a reason why I have to spend these lonely nights  
Tell me the reason why you tour around the world  
And why in God's name do you make me into your clown
