There's a chill on this evening, nights right for greaving,  
Darkness surrounds him as he wanders alone  
He walked past the dim lights, the pathways and street lights  
They remind him, of nights long ago,  
When his love was strong and his muscles hard, His whiskey throat was barley
marred,  
Seeking misfortune in the lies that he told, Then a brokin heart bought him to
his knees,  
In the hour of his greatest need, Lost and forsaken by the love, he could not
hold  
[Chorus:]  
On the Border line of love again, Its bound to make you pay  
On the Border line, we'll make our stand, Then watch it fall away  
And he stands in quiet solitude, The nights reflects upon his mood,  
Seeking the vision that had once been so clear, When he felt the touch of his
women's love  
His pounding heart was warm and young, Now locked inside him with his anger
and fear  
As he moves on slowly, past the trees, Down the path way home through fallen
leaves  
He can't believe, how he'd sunken so low, So he learned to live with his
injured pride  
His purple heart hidden, deep inside, The only reward, for a love he could not
hold  
[Chorus 2x]
