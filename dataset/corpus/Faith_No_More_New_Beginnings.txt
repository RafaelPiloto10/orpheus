A glow in her eye  
As he waved goodbye  
That's where it all began  
She was a loving girl  
He was a caring guy  
Together they had plans  
They were married and had a baby  
His name was Johnnie  
  
Wait a minute, that's me  
Why am I only three years old again  
Spinning and spinning and spinning  
  
There was no gleam in your eye  
When you passed us by  
In the parade this time  
You had nothing to say  
And you're always on your way somewhere  
But today you just stood still  
You were a quiet kind of person  
Who asked for nothing and got just that  
So they sent you away to kill for your country  
  
Could you blame him?  
Could you blame them?  
No. And in the end  
When we meet again we're friends  
Will we ever learn that we are always God's children  
And gods never made moral decisions  
They made love
