Tears streaming down, her heart is broken  
Because her life is hurting, so am I  
He wears a frown, his dreams are choking  
And because he stands alone, his dreams will die  
So, humbly I come to you and say  
As I sound aloud the warfare of today  
Hear me, I pray  
  
CHORUS  
What about the children  
To ignore is so easy  
So many innocent children would choose the wrong way  
So what about the children  
Remember when we were children  
And if not for those who loved us and who cared enough to show  
us  
Where would we be today  
  
Sir, where is your son  
Where lies his refuge  
And if he can't come to you, then where can he run  
Such a foolish girl, yet still, she's your daughter  
And if you will just reminisce your days of young  
You see, it's not where you've been, nor what you've done  
Because I know a friend who specializes in great outcomes  
See His love overcomes  
  
CHORUS (2 times)  
  
Where would we be today  
Where would we be today  
Where would we be today  
What about the the children
