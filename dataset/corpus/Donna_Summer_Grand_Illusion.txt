Oh grand illusion, like to fade away  
Take me and go out and play, oh yeah  
It's no intrusion, it's like a rainy day  
That can wash the clouds away of this pain inside  
  
Harmony, we need harmony  
Find the melody that puts our hearts in tune  
Harmony, we need harmony  
Simple symphony that makes us feel brand new  
  
Oh grand illusion, like to fade away  
Take me and go out and play, Oh yeah  
It's no intrusion, it's like a rainy day  
That can wash the clouds away of this pain inside  
  
Harmony, we need harmony  
Find the melody that puts our hearts in tune  
Harmony, we need harmony  
Simple symphony that makes us feel brand new  
  
Harmony, harmony  
Oh grand illusion, like to fade away  
Take me and go out and play, Oh yeah  
It's no intrusion, it's like a rainy day  
  
That can wash the clouds away of this pain inside  
Come on now, boy, put it on the line  
Take some space just to ease your mind  
And to think it through
