I watch the leaves falling to the ground  
I'm walking up and down  
The streets of my hometown  
You're here with me like it used to be  
I look around and then I'm on my own again  
  
Can't stop loving you  
Can't stop wanting you  
Can't stop now that you  
Made me part of you  
I've heard some people say  
I'm dreaming my life away  
But what else can I do  
Can't stop loving you  
  
Your face I see in my memory  
I close my eyes and then  
I start to live again  
You're holding me like it used to be  
I open my eyes and then  
I'm on my own again  
  
Can't stop loving you  
Can't stop wanting you  
Can't stop now that you  
Made me part of you  
I've heard some people say  
I'm dreaming my life away  
But what else can I do  
Can't stop loving you  
  
Can't stop loving you  
Can't stop wanting you  
Can't stop feeling blue  
Can't stop loving you  
I can't stop loving you  
Oh I can't I can't I can't...
