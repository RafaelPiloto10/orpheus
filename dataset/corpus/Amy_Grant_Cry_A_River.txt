Who knew love would come walking through' my door  
Turn a light on somewhere down inside  
And give me a feeling I'd never had before  
It was a long wait  
It was just the wrong time  
  
But I hope you'll hold me now  
Somewhere within  
And when you think about  
What might have been  
  
[Chorus:]  
Cry a river  
Flood the sea  
Cry a river over me  
Take the bitter  
With the sweet  
And cry a river over me  
  
How can you argue with a feeling in your bones  
'Bout what is and what isn't meant to be  
Some things you live with  
But you never let it show  
Like the pain I felt  
The day I watched you leave  
  
But I hope you'll think of me  
When tender winds blow  
Sit on the shores of love  
And just let it go  
  
[Chorus:]
