Everywhere I go  
They're staring at her  
Every man I know  
He wants to have her  
I guess I ought to be a jealous man  
I'd look the other way  
They're hittin' on her  
Every night and day they telephone her  
They try to get to her but I know they can't  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause she never lets it go to her heart  
She never lets it go that far  
When they start talking  
She starts walking  
Right back to my arms  
She can turn every head  
But she never lets it go to her heart  
  
She walks into the room  
And everybody watches every move  
Hoping she don't love me  
I know it by the way they hang around  
But they don't realize  
There's more to her than what meets the eye  
That's why I'm certain  
No matter what they do to reach her now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When they start talking  
She starts walking  
Right back to my arms  
She can turn every head  
But she never lets it go (never lets it go)  
To her heart
