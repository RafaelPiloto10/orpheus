I Got You  
But it's the craving for the good life  
That sees me through troubled times  
When the mind begins to wander to the spoon  
  
And I got you  
Because your there to bend and nurture me through these  
Troubled times  
'Cause the fix begins to twist my troubled mind  
  
And I Got You to paint the sorrow on my day  
And I Got You to paint the roses on my grave  
And I Got You  
  
I Got You  
But it's the feeling that I get when your away  
Twist my mind 'cause I'm all alone and cold, gone I feel like dyin'  
And I Got You to fill the craving that I get inside my mind  
When you're there to fill the space I have inside, I feel like crying  
  
And I Got You to paint the sorrow on my day  
And I Got You to paint the roses on my grave  
And I Got You  
  
All the slippin' that I slap me  
I Got You, I Got You  
All the slippin' that I slap me
