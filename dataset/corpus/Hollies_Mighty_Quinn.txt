(Dylan)  
Come all without, come all within  
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn  
Come all without, come all within  
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn  
  
Everybody's building ships and boats  
Some are building monuments, others jotting down notes  
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy  
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here  
Everybody's gonna jump for joy  
  
Chorus  
  
I like to go just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet  
But jumping queues and making haste  
Just ain't my cup of meat  
Everyone's beneath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb  
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here  
All the pigeons gonna run to him  
  
Chorus  
  
Let me do what I want to do, I can't decide 'em all  
Just tell me where to put 'em, and I'll tell you who call  
Nobody can get no sleep, there's someone on everyone's toes  
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here  
Everybody's gonna want to doze  
  
Chorus
