There's a fork in the road  
On my way home  
Temptation waits  
Wine, women, and song  
Lord my will breaks  
Where that road bends  
And tonight I took a turn for the worse again  
  
Left was home  
Right was wrong  
You can bet by now she knows  
Which road I'm on  
It's a road I know  
Like the back of my hand  
But tonight I took a turn for the worse again  
  
My old truck  
Pulls a little to the right  
Seems to get a lot worse  
On Friday nite  
Things are bad at home  
Lord I'm sick of work  
So tonight I took a turn for the worse  
  
Left was home  
Right was wrong  
You can bet by now she knows  
Which road I'm on  
It's a road I know  
Like the back of my hand  
But tonight I took a turn for the worse again  
  
Lord tonight I took a turn  
For the worse again
