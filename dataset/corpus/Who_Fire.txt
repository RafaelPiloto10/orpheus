Fire! I'll take you to burn  
Fire! I'm gonna take you to learn  
I'll see you burn!  
  
You fought hard and saved and earned  
Now all of it's going to burn  
In your mind, your tiny mind  
You know you've been completely blind  
Don't you dream of what you left so far behind?  
  
Fire! To destroy all you've done  
Fire! To end all you've become  
I'll see you burn!  
  
You were living your life just like a little girl  
Spreading your wings in the middle of your little world  
And in your mind, your tiny mind  
You know you've fallen far behind  
Now you're gonna burn  
  
Fire! You're gonna burn!
