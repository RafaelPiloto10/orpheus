[Verse 1]  
Surrounded by the cares of Life  
Situations rise, they press against my soul  
Desperate thoughts have blocked me in  
Feels like I may lose control  
  
A voice from somewhere inside of me  
Brings comfort and fills my heart with courage  
And lets me know that everything will be alright  
  
[Chorus]  
(I hear Him say)  
Be still my soul and know that He is God  
(He is God)  
Stand quitely - He is the Lord  
If God is for me who can be against me?  
(He is God)  
Be still my soul, He is the Lord  
  
[Verse 2]  
Teach me Lord, to stay with You  
When my emotions try to rule me  
Remind me Lord, of who I am  
Show me, what You want me to be  
  
In His great strength and confidence  
Knowing that You are with me  
I'm not afraid of tomorrow  
What waits ahead  
  
[Chorus]  
(I hear Him say)  
Be still, my soul, and know that He is God  
(He is God)  
Stand quitely - He is the Lord  
If God is for me who can be against me?  
(He is God)  
Be still my soul, He is the Lord  
  
Be still my soul, He is the Lord  
He is the Lord.
