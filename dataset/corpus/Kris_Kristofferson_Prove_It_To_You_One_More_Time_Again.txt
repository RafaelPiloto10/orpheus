Nobody's blamin' you.  
Don't get me wrong.  
I know so many things you done for me.  
But you got your life that you gotta live  
And I'll get along.  
I just wonder who you wanted me to be.  
And I just can't believe that you still don't believe in me  
Or hold a clue to who I am.  
I just hope to God that I still got the heart to take it  
And prove it to you one more time again.  
So many lies we've told so many times  
Maybe it's too late to make it love again  
If we got a choice then we gotta chance  
We gotta try  
And do the story true right to the end.  
And I can't believe that you still don't believe in me  
And you still don't understand me  
I just hope to God that I still got the heart to take it  
And prove it to you one more time again.
