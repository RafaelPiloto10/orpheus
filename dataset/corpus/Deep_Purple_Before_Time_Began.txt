The daylight fades and the stars comes out  
But there's never much to talk about  
Another day goes rushing by and here we are just wondering why  
We have to belong with a sense of purpose  
That's all we need, without them we're worthless  
Ah, we've come so far, hm, but then again  
All we see is more of the same  
It's getting crowded here we agree no doubt  
Oh dear brother what's it all about?  
  
Hey you over there why don't you throw down your spear?  
We all need some help right now  
Where are we going from here?  
The way things are working out  
It won't be too long before we have to move  
Better start thinking about it  
While there's still time to choose  
  
Every day of my life I discover  
Someone murdering my sisters and brothers  
In the name of some god or another  
What do you know  
  
For the first precious few it's time to go  
What might have been we'll never know  
All those bad ideas became the law  
Oh yes, we've forgotten what we're looking for  
All of you angels it's time to gather your wings  
Leave it all behind you won't need any of those things  
We're going on through the darkness hand in hand  
To step into the future  
Before time began  
  
And for those who remain with your chosen gods  
May your prayers be answered.
