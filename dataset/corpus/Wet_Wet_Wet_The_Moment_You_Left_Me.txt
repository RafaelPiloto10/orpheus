Paying dues and learning vices  
  
When the big guns start to shooting  
With the bullets of deception, honey  
With a smile upon your face  
You're going from second hand to almost new  
  
Well I try to live life eye to eye, to eye to eye  
But I say, I find it far too tall, tall, tall, tall, tall  
  
Show me one more sign  
Gimme one more time  
Cause you gimme, gimme

Show me one more sign  
Gimme one more time  
Cause you gimme, gimme  
You gimme gimme gimme temptation, baby  
  
Sing along sing along baby  
Sing along for the love of the children  
  
And if this was to be true  
Say I'd give all the tea in China  
And maybe all the tulips  
In Amsterdam  
  
Well I try to live life eye to eye,  
But I say, I find it far too tall, tall, tall, tall, tall  
  
Show me one more sign  
Gimme one more time  
Cause you gimme, GIMME

First you make me move  
Until I'm so damn close  
Take me back again, take me back again  
They'll say I'm mighty thankful  
But it's much too easy, good god y'all  
Paying dues and learning vices  
But no, but no, but oh no
