One, two.  
  
O'oh, Central Park,  
O'oh, evening skyline,  
O'oh, helicopter,  
O'oh, firecrackers,  
O'oh, July 4th in New York City.  
  
O'oh, trees are laughing,  
O'oh, windows smiling,  
O'oh, water shining,  
O'oh, people rolling,  
O'oh, July 4th in New York City  
  
I never knew we could be so nice to each other.  
I never thought we'd be laughing together.  
I never knew life could be sweet and simple.  
I never thought that was possible.  
  
O'oh, dogs are chasing,  
O'oh, clouds are dreaming,  
O'oh, people dancing,  
O'oh, July 4th in New York City.  
  
I never knew we could be so kind to each other.  
I never thought we'd be singing together.  
I never knew life could be so sweet and simple.  
I never thought that was possible.  
  
O'oh, Central Park,  
O'oh, evening skyline,  
O'oh, helicopter,  
O'oh, firecrackers.  
  
O'oh, O'oh, O'oh, O'oh, O'oh,  
O'oh, O'oh, O'oh, O'oh,O'oh,  
O'oh, O'oh, O'oh, O'oh, O'oh,  
O'oh, O'oh, O'oh, O'oh.
