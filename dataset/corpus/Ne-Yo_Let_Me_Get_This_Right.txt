Misunderstand anyone but I think baby you

Feeling this thing changing (yea)  
  
Feelings I got for you couldn't dry its the truth but  
You want something new baby(baby)  
We got a simple thing but its about to change  
Or will it stay the same maybe(maybe)  
No matter what the road I pass still as a load  
Of loves and lust and that much trust  
But I am saying this can't be us
