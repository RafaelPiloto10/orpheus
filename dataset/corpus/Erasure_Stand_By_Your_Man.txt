Sometimes it's hard to be a woman  
Givin' all your love to just one man  
You have the bad times and he'll have good times  
Doin' things that you don't understand  
But if you love him, you'll forgive him  
For doin' things that you don't understand  
And if you love him, well be proud of him  
'Cause after all, he's just a man  
Stand by your man  
Give him two arms to come to  
And something warm to cling to  
When nights are cold and lonely  
Stand by your man  
And show the world you love him  
And give him all the love you can  
Stand by your man  
Stand by your man  
And show the world you love him  
And give him all the love you can  
Stand by your man
