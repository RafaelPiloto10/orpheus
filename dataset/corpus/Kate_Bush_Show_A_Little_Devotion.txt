Everything that you wanted  
Everything that you love, yeah  
Will run away from you  
  
Everything that you care for, yeah, yeah  
Show a little devotion  
In my devotion  
  
No, the minute I saw your face  
Is there anything that I can do?  
Anything at all?  
  
You'd tell me about it won't you?  
Any way that I can help?  
Just tell me about it, won't you  
  
So that I can do it  
Anything at all  
Just tell me what it is that you want
