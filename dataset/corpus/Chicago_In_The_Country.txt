Oh my reasons  
And my ways  
Keep on changing  
From day to day  
As I grow  
It becomes so clear  
Why I'm here  
It's all here  
For you and me  
The beauty of life  
Someday you'll see  
Then you'll join in  
And sing along  
And you'll understand why I sing this song  
Let me tell you now  
I do love you  
I do love you  
I do love you  
Well I'm talkin' bout life  
And livin'  
And the beautiful earth  
And givin'  
Talkin 'bout the natural things we've had since birth  
That's lovin'  
Well I'm talkin' 'bout a walk in the country  
Mother nature's sweet charm  
The smell of her perfume  
As we walk arm in arm  
Let me tell you now  
I do love you  
I do love you  
I do love you  
Well it's a beautiful day  
And I'm on my way  
Oooh, thank you lord, for the country  
Well my thoughts  
Are like ripples in a stream  
I see myself so free  
My eyes and spirit say hello  
My soul goes dancing by, oh hello  
The clean fresh air  
Goes jumping through my head  
The sun is smilin' down  
If you have ever lived out here  
Then you know why I say  
I do love you  
I do love you  
I do love you  
So come on let's move  
Out to the country  
Yeah, let's go live out there  
Come on people  
Come on people  
Yeah, let's be free  
We got to be free  
In the country  
You and me  
Come on people  
Come on people  
Better have a good time  
We'll have a good time  
We got to be free
