Born and raised in the windy city  
I moved west to kick start a dream  
What I found was a town without pity  
That'll chew you up and swallow you clean  
  
I'm amazed at the life I'm livin'  
Don't want to seem like I'm rockin' the boat  
But it ain't all about taking but giving  
I feel something tugging at my coat  
No one ever told me it would be like this  
That there'd be something called home that's too hard to miss  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm saying goodbye to the glamor  
Back to the old neighborhood  
All that I need is a place that I can breathe  
I'm saying goodbye to Hollywood  
  
Done my time in the Hoodoo Jungle  
Tired of waking up in another man's dream  
I've got the ball and I ain't gonna fumble  
Gonna make a winner of this team  
All that ever mattered were the goals I chased  
Now, I'm ready to run in the human race  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Me and the Mrs. done made up our minds  
We're gonna give our boys a little less sunshine  
Call it runnin' say what you like  
I've got my own definition of paradise  
I'd rather be knee deep in snow than knee deep in jive  
I may be cold but my soul is alive  
  
[Chorus]
