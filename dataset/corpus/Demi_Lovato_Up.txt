[Intro]  
If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up  
If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up  
  
[Verse 1]  
I'd say hold up  
Broken out of nowhere, showed up  
I'm in love  
This heist got me skipping a heart beat  
I'm giving up  
  
[Pre Chorus]  
I want to run, run, run away  
In your getaway car, make a gateway  
  
[Chorus]  
If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up  
If you're going to take me down, I surrender  
I'll give you anything you want  
Just don't leave me alone  
This is a hold up, this is a hold up  
If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up  
  
[Verse 2]  
Hey, stranger  
I'm addicted to the danger of the touch  
Now you're wanted  
Better keep me as your hostage  
Tie me up  
  
[Pre Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]  
If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up  
If you're going to take me down, I surrender  
I'll give you anything you want  
Just don't leave me alone  
This is a hold up, this is a hold up  
  
[Verse 3]  
Everybody get down  
Get down on the floor, floor  
Everybody get down  
Nobody gets hurt, hurt  
  
[Chorus]  
[X2]  
  
[Outro]  
If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up  
If the weapon is your love, I got my hands up
