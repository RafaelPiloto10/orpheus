I can't stop this feeling  
Deep inside of me  
Girl, you just don't realize  
What you do to me  
  
Your lips are sweet as candy  
The taste stays on my mind  
You just keep me thirsty  
For another cup of wine  
  
When you hold me  
In your arms so tight  
You let me know  
Everything's all right  
  
I, I'm hooked on a feeling  
I'm high on believing  
That you're in love with me  
  
I've got it bad for you, darling  
But I don't need a cure  
I'll just stay addicted  
And hope I can endure  
  
All the good love  
When we're all alone  
Keep it up boy  
Yeah, you turn me on  
  
I, I'm hooked on a feeling  
I'm high on believing  
That you're in love with me  
  
When you hold me  
In your arms so tight  
You let me know  
Everything's all right  
  
I, I'm hooked on a feeling  
I'm high on believing  
That you're in love with me  
  
I said I'm hooked on a feeling
