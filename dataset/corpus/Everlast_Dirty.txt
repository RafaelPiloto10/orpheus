And I'm so dirty  
Call me daddy  
You're so sexy  
You can be my bad girl  
If someone hurt you  
And you tried to hide it  
I'll cut you deeper  
'Cause I know you like it  
The pain I got girl  
Can satisfy you  
But I can't love you  
I won't even try to  
And that junkie urge  
Deep down inside you  
Couldn't keep my secret  
But I know you'd like to  
  
Girl you never gon' get love from a heart of stone  
Some of us were just plain meant to be alone  
I'm all out of secrets  
I'm running out of lies  
And I can see the end girl  
When I look into your eyes  
  
And I'm so nasty  
And I'm so greedy  
And I'm so lonesome  
Girl, I'm so needy  
I want to take you  
And make you my girl  
My willing hostage  
My favorite prisoner  
I'll be your owner  
And I'll be your jailer  
I'll be your lover  
Girl, I'll be your savior  
I'll be your alpha  
And your omega  
I'll break your heart girl  
And you'll call me later  
  
Girl you never gon' get love from a heart of stone  
Some of us were just plain meant to be alone  
I'm all out of secrets  
I'm running out of lies  
And I can see the end girl  
When I look into your eyes  
  
And I'm so dirty  
Call me daddy  
You're so sexy  
You can be my bad girl (4x)
