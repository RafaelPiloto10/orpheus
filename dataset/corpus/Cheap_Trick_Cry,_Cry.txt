There ain't no one in the world who can stop you  
You work hard, you went hungry

And he'll steal your shit and think that it's funny  
Like the Beatles he ain't human  
Now the tax-man is out to get you  
  
You worked hard  
And slaved and slaved for years  
You played  
And you played and played for years  
Tax-man, Mr. Heath (He's a thief)
