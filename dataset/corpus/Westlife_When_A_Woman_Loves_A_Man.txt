When the stars are in her eyes  
And the sun is in her smile  
The only moment in a life  
That happens the same time  
Is when a woman loves a man  
  
She'll be a mother and a child  
Sacrifice her days and nights  
And no other will exists  
She'll put life in every kiss  
When a woman loves a man  
  
And you'll be amazed how when  
You're stumbling  
She'll fight for you  
And won't let you give in  
She'll do all that she can  
When a woman loves a man  
  
A soothing breeze always blows  
Somebody understands another soul  
It's like the planets have aligned  
Every sentence has a rhyme  
When a woman loves a man  
  
Oh, you'll be amazed how when  
You're needing it  
She'll fight for you  
From the beginning to the end  
And she'll do all that she can  
When a woman loves a man  
  
It's the greatest gift of all  
Knowing that unconditionally  
She'll catch you when you fall  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Oh, yeah  
When a woman loves a man  
  
When the stars are in her eyes  
And the sun is in her smile  
She'll be a mother and a child  
But all at the same time  
When a woman loves a man  
  
She'll be your air,  
She'll bring you life  
She'll make me sacrifice  
When a woman loves a man
