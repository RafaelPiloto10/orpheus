Take away any desire in me that hurts you  
Take away anything that stands between you and me  
I want to be what you created me to be  
It's my desire that you find favor in me  
Lord  
Take away anything that displeases you  
  
Take away any evil thought within me  
Take away anything that proves to break your heart  
I want to be in sweet communion with you  
It's my desire to do everything you want me to do  
Lord  
Take away anything that displeases you  
  
Remove all doubt  
All insecurity  
Erase all hate  
All iniquity  
Discard all the fear  
Found deep within me  
Lord  
Take away anything that displeases you  
  
Take away lord  
Take away  
  
Take away any desire in me that hurts you  
Take it away
