Don't you know  
It always happens  
Same time every year.  
Snow flakes and heartaches  
And that lonesome Christmas chill  
  
I keep going through emotions  
Hiding from the truth  
Don't you know that Chritmas  
Just ain't christmas  
Without you  
  
You know Christmas  
Hasn't been the same  
Since the day you left.  
I still send you  
Real tight greetings  
Hoping someday  
You might forget  
  
I try to hold up tradition  
Do all the things we used to do  
But you know that Christmas  
Just ain't Chritmas without you.  
  
Cause all are having Silent night  
Memories of how we used to be  
And all would come back to my world  
If you just let Santa bring  
Your sweet love home to me.  
  
There's a season  
To be happy  
But Lord I feel so blue  
Cause girl Christmas  
Just ain't Christmas without you
