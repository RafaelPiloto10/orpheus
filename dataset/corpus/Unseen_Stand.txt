He's seen it all before, he's been there and back  
Lived his life with scum on the wrong side of the track  
He can't take it any more, got nothing at all  
Realizes that he's got nowhere to fall  
Stand on your feet and fight to take it back  
Stand up again get yourself on the right track  
Stand for yourself, don't fall over the edge  
Stand, I'll be there 'till the very end  
Wants to clean himself around but old habits, they die hard  
He fought through it all, he found through it all, he fought to keep his head
straight  
But he'll never escape
