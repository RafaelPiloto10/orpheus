I'll never forget that feeling,  
When I watched you disappear,  
And you made me stop believing,  
I could fight away the fear.  
  
Now the smoke has cleared and the end is near,  
It was my illusion.  
Like a broken dream, I was incomplete,  
But your love was never the missing key.  
  
I feel like I'm breathing again,  
I feel like I'm seeing again,  
I feel like I'm breathing again,  
I got it under control, oh, oh,  
I got it under control, oh, oh,  
I got it under control, oh, oh.  
  
All that's real is faded,  
Like a car into the night.  
Like a painkiller, I take it,  
And I watch the world ignite.  
  
Now the smoke has cleared and the end is near,  
It was my illusion.  
Like a broken dream, I was incomplete,  
But your love was never the missing key.  
  
I feel like I'm breathing again,  
I feel like I'm seeing again,  
I feel like I'm breathing again,  
I got it under control, oh, oh,  
I got it under control, oh, oh,  
I got it under control, oh, oh,  
I got it under control, oh, oh.  
  
I got it under control.  
I got it under control.  
  
I got it under control, oh, oh,  
I got it under control, oh, oh,  
I got it under control, oh, oh.  
  
I feel like I'm breathing again,  
I feel like I'm seeing again,  
I feel like I'm breathing again,  
I got it under control, oh, oh,  
I got it under control, oh, oh,  
I got it under control, oh, oh,  
I got it under control, oh, oh.  
  
I got it under control, oh, oh,  
I got it under control, oh, oh,  
I got it under control, oh, oh,  
I got it under control, oh, oh.  
  
I got it under control.  
I got it under control.
