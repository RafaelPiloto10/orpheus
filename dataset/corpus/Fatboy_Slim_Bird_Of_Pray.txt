Bird of pray, bird of pray  
Fly in high. Fly in high  
Bird of pray, bird of pray  
In the summer sky, fly in high  
Fly in high, fly in high  
Take me on your fly, fly in high  
Fly in high  
  
Bird of pray, bird of pray  
Fly in high, fly in high  
Bird of pray, bird of pray  
In the summer sky, fly in high  
  
Bird of pray, bird of pray  
Jump me pass apart, fly in high  
Fly in high  
  
Bird of pray, bird of pray  
Fly in high, fly in high  
Bird of pray, bird of pray  
Jump me pass apart, fly in high  
Fly in high, fly in high  
Fly in high, fly in high  
Fly in high, fly in high  
Take me over side, fly in high
