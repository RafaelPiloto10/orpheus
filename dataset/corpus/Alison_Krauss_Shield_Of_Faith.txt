Sometimes I'm battle weary  
I forget to use my shield  
The arrows pierce my armor  
And I stumble in the filed  
A shield won't do much good if it's hangin' by your side  
Keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive  
I'll think my life is over  
But the Lord he comes to me  
He heals my wounded spirit  
And he sets me on my feet  
A shield won't do much good if it's hangin' by your side  
Keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive  
Sometimes your battle weary  
But the war's already won  
Keep your head and hold your shield high  
'Til your days of life are done  
A shield won't do much good if it's hangin' by your side  
Keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive  
Keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive
