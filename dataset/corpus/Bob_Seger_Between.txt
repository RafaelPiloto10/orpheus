You're old enough to know better as soon  
As you can see  
This world is out to get you the way it's gotten me  
It starts out in the morning then moves to afternoon  
By the time you reach the evenin' you're  
Barkin' at the moon  
Between what you're told and what you've seen  
You'll know that it's just another show  
Everybody sells somethin'everybody's got game  
We all keep believin' no one is to blame  
The world keeps getting hotter, ice falls in the sea  
We buy a bigger engine and say it isn't me  
Between what we say and what we mean  
It's clean far away from that machine  
We talk on the phone because we're alone  
And everyone knows it  
We feel overdue, we want something new  
And everyone knows it  
It's time to join with the living, time to understand  
We're all in this together, we've got to have a plan  
We're facing an extinction every other day  
There's got to be an answer, we've got to find a way  
Between what is dead and what is green  
We learn what to keep and what to burn  
Between what is fair and what's obscene  
It's clean far way from that machine
