Hello and welcome, at your risk.  
You're always welcome, without guarantee  
If you're so brave to face this tide  
There is no mercy in this life  
Now it's time to feel that it's here  
What is fiction and what's reality  
  
Hello and welcome, just look at me  
Think about the future, its still traveling  
Too much confidence on what you have  
They ain't are dear to feel this safe  
Overload your destiny and you'll wake up behind it  
  
Hello and welcome (welcome, welcome)  
But its your risk  
Your always welcome (welcome)  
To win your reality (hello hello hello and welcome)  
Just look at me  
Think about the future  
It's still traveling (hello)  
Hello, Just look at me  
Just look at me  
Its your destiny  
(Hello and welcome,Hello and welcome) oh  
Just look at me (hello hello) [Repeats]
