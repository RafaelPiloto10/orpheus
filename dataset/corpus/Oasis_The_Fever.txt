I'm tired of my life but my heads alright  
I got the fever off a man I know  
I can feel it comin' in the air tonight  
And I know, I know, I know  
  
Swear I heard a song on the radio  
My heart is laughing back at me  
I can see it comin' but I just don't know  
If it's gon' , it's gon, it's gonna let me be  
  
As I saw, on the breeze  
I can see the sons of those who came before me  
And it's got me on my knees  
What you say, anyway  
Will not last, it'll pass, it'll flash right there before me  
And it's got me on my knees  
  
Cos I got the fever  
Yeah I got the fever  
Cos I got the fever  
  
I'm tired of my life but my heads alright  
I got the fever off a man I know  
I can feel it comin' in the air tonight  
And I know, I know, I know  
  
Swear I heard a song on the radio  
My heart is laughing back at me  
I can see it comin' but I just don't know  
If it's gon' , it's gon, it's gonna let me be  
  
As I saw, on the breeze  
I can see the sons of those who came before me  
And it's got me on my knees  
What you say, anyway  
Will not last, it'll pass, it'll flash right there before me  
And it's got me on my knees  
It's got me on my knees  
It's got me on my knees  
It's got me on my knees  
  
As I saw, on the breeze  
I can see the sons of those who came before me  
And it's got me on my knees  
What you say, anyway  
Will not last, it'll pass, it'll flash right there before me  
And it's got me on my knees  
It's got me on my knees  
It's got me on my knees  
It's got me on my knees  
It's got me on my knees
