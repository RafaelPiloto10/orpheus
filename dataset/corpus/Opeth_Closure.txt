Heal myself, a feather on my heart  
Look inside, there never was a start  
Peel myself, dispose of severed skin  
All subsides, around me and within  
  
There's nothing painful in this  
There's no upheaval  
Redemption for my pathos  
All sins undone  
  
Awaiting word on what's to come  
In helpless prayers a hope lives on  
As I've come clean I've forgotten what I promised  
In the rays of the sun I am longing for the darkness
