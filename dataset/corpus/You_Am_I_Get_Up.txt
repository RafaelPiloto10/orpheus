Got a kiss on the neck from a mornin' cartoon  
Pullin' out the knot, I just can't lose  
Grabbin' my shoulder, turned out the night  
Like a smile after you've cried  
  
The lady out walkin' with her popcorn pup  
To get out and smoke before her husband wakes up  
Eyes to the asphalt, plastic bag hands  
Just get on outta there, just get away from that man  
  
Well I'm all thumbs and toes  
With the way that it comes and the way that it goes  
  
(Get up, get up)  
I gotta loosen this load  
(Get up, get up)  
Get some fire in my throat  
(Get up, get up)  
  
See the man in the corner tryin' to make em all smile  
And missin' the one who matters all the while  
And she'll beat him senseless but he just can't see  
It ain't for the crowd that you bleed  
  
So be good to your barkeep man  
Its more than yer drink, he's got his hand  
Can see that your nervous and it shits him to tears  
Yeah he just don't want to wait and he don't care about your band  
  
Well I'm all thumbs and toes  
With the way that it comes and the way that it goes  
  
(Get up, get up)  
I gotta loosen this load  
(Get up, get up)  
And put some fire in my throat  
(Get up, get up)  
  
I need a life dedicated  
Not this endless parading  
Help me, alright  
  
(Get up, get up)  
Yeah I gotta loosen this load  
(Get up, get up)  
And get some fire in my throat  
(Get up, get up)  
  
I want a life dedicated  
Not this endless parading  
Help me, alright  
  
I need to do more, but I ain't been sleeping  
For the longest time  
For the longest time  
For the longest time  
  
If I could live for one day without being sorry I know  
One day without being sorry, I know  
One day without being sorry, I know  
One day without being sorry
