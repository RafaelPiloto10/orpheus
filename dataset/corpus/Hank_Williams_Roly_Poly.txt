Roly Poly eatin' corn and taters  
He's hungry every minute of the day  
Roly Poly gnawin' all the biscuit  
As long as he can chew it it's okay  
  
He can eat an apple pie  
Before a cat can wake his eye  
He likes everything from a soup to hay  
Roly Poly daddy's little fatty  
I'll bet he's gonna be a man someday  
  
Roly Poly scrambled eggs for breakfast  
Had bread and jelly twenty times a day  
Roly Poly will eat a hardy dinner  
It takes lotta strength to run and play  
  
Well he bowls up weeds and he does the chores  
He runs both ways to all the stores  
He works up an appetite that way  
Roly Poly daddy's little fatty  
I'll bet he's gonna be a man someday  
  
Roly Poly eatin' corn and taters  
He's hungry every minute of the day  
Roly Poly gnawin' all the biscuit  
And as long as he can chew it it's okay  
  
He can eat an apple pie never even bat his eye  
He likes everything from a soup to hay  
Roly Poly daddy's little fatty  
I'll bet he's gonna be a man someday
