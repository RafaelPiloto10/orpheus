Sometimes things just seem to fall apart  
When you least expect them to  
Sometimes you want to pack up and leave behind  
All of them and all their smiles  
  
I don't know  
What to think anymore  
Maybe things will get better  
Maybe things will look brighter  
Maybe, Maybe, Maybe  
  
Sometimes people surprise you  
And people surprise me  
But I guess that's the price we pay  
For wanting so badly  
  
I don't know  
What to think anymore  
Maybe things will get better  
Maybe things will look brighter  
Maybe, Maybe, Maybe  
  
I don't know  
What to think anymore  
Maybe things will get better  
Maybe things will look brighter  
Maybe, Maybe, Maybe  
  
I don't know  
What to think anymore  
Maybe things will get better  
Maybe things will look brighter  
Maybe, Maybe, Maybe  
  
Sometimes...Sometimes...Sometimes
