Yell with the wind, though the wind won't help you fly at all  
Your back's to the wall  
Then chain the sun, and it tears away and it breaks you as you run,  
You run, you run!  
  
Behind the smile, there's danger and a promise to be told:  
You'll never get old  
Life's fantasy, to be locked away and still to think you're free  
You're free, we're free!  
  
So live for today  
Tomorrow never comes  
Die young  
  
Die young, die young  
Can't you see the writing on the wall?  
Die young, gonna die young  
Someone stopped the pain  
  
Goto the wind, though the wind won't help you fly at all  
Your back's to the wall  
Then chase the sun, and it tears away and it breaks you as you run,  
You run, you run!  
  
So live for today  
Tomorrow never comes  
  
Die young, young!  
Die young, die young!  
Die young, die young, young!  
Die young, die young, die young, die young, die young!
