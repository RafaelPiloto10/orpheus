I think it's turning back around  
And I think I like it  
I think it's turning back around  
Though I don't know why it is  
I think it's turning back on me  
I'm down on the upside  
I think it's turning back on me  
Now I'm the good ride  
  
And nothing's gonna put me out  
It's backing down and under  
I'm down on the upside now  
It's turning back around  
Turning back around  
  
I think it's coming on the wind  
Just like you said it  
I think it's coming on the wind  
And I'm gonna let it  
  
I think it's turning back on me  
Everything's easy  
I think it's turning back on me  
Everything's real to me
