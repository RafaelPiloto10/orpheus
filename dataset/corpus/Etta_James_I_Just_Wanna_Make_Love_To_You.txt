I don't want you to be no slave  
I don't want to work all day  
But I want you to be true  
And I just wanna make love to you  
  
Love to you  
Ooh-ooh  
Love to you  
  
All I want to do is wash your clothes  
I don't want to keep you indoors  
There is nothing for you to do  
But keep me making love to you  
  
Love to you  
Ooh-ooh  
Love to you  
  
[Chorus]  
And I can tell by the way  
That you walk that walk  
I can hear by the way  
You talk that talk  
And I can know by the way  
You treat your girl  
That I could give you all the loving  
In the whole wide world  
  
All I want to do is bake your bread  
Just to make sure you're well fed  
I don't want you sad and blue  
And I just wanna make love to you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All I want to do is bake your bread  
Just to make sure you're well fed  
I don't want you sad and blue  
And I just wanna make love to you  
  
Love to you  
Ooh-ooh  
Love to you  
  
Ooh-ooh  
Love to you
