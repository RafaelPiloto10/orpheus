Come, they told me pa rum pa pum pum  
Our newborn King to see pa rum pa pum pum  
Our finest gifts we bring pa rum pa pum pum  
To lay before the King pa rum pa pum pum  
Rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum  
So to honor Him, pa rum pa pum pum  
When we come  
  
Baby Jesus pa rum pa pum pum  
I am poor boy too pa rum pa pum pum  
I have no gift to bring pa rum pa pum pum  
That's fit to give our King pa rum pa pum pum  
Rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum  
Shall I play for you pa rum pa pum pum  
On my drum  
  
Mary nodded par rum pa pum pum  
The ox and lamb kept time pa rum pa pum pum  
Iplayed my drum for him pa rum pa pum pum  
Iplayed my best for him pa rum pa pum pum  
Rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum  
Then he smiled at me pa rum pa pum pum  
Me and my drum, me and my drum
