Well, if you want someone to tear your world apart  
Someone who will give it everything she's got  
If you wanna learn to cry, I recommend her  
If you want someone who's really qualified  
Guaranteed broken heart every time  
If you wanna learn to cry, don't let this chance pass you by  
I recommend this girl to you, I recommend this girl to you  
she's had plenty of experience along this line, oh, so many times  
She's torn apart this heart of mine, it's fascinating  
The way she operates  
She'll put you down when you think you're finally getting someplace  
I recommend this girl to you, I recommend this girl to you, yes I do  
If you want your dreams to end before they begin  
Someone who will ruin your life and then laugh while you cry  
Don't let this chance pass you by  
I recommend this girl to you, I recommend this girl to you  
I recommend her, I recommend her  
I recommend her, I recommend her
