On again  
No I newer knew we could go on and on  
They never thought we would be rockin' on  
No we never thought we - could be rockin' on  
  
Home again  
And it won't be very long before I'm gone again  
Now I'm gone again  
And it's never really long before I'm home again  
If you like what I like come rock with me  
If you like what I like - oh, I'm on again  
No I never knew we could go on and on  
They never thought we would be rockin' on  
No we never thought we - could be rockin' on  
  
Take a look again  
Is it really very hard to see the signs again  
Were you listening  
When I said that I was giving up my worryin'  
If you like what I like come rock with me  
If you like what I like - oh, I'm on again  
No I never knew we could go on and on  
They never thought we would be rockin' on  
No we never thought we - could be rockin' on  
  
Oh, I'm on again  
No I never knew we could go on and on  
They never thought we would be rockin' on  
No we never thought we - could be rockin' on
