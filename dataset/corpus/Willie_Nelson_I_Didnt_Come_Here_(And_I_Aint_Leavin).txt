I built a big pile of peanut shells on the sawdust floor  
I winked at every pretty girl comin' in and out the door  
Yellin', 'Hey bartender, how 'bout two more''  
  
Bottle by bottle I'm clearin' off that shelf  
And I feel so good that I'm not quite myself  
Now, they're tellin' me that I gotta find someplace else  
Well, guess what  
  
I didn't come here and I ain't leavin'  
I've been thrown into better places than this  
I didn't come here and I ain't leavin'  
If you wanna pucker up, I got just the place for you to kiss  
  
Well, I spent my dollar and drank up my last dime  
Now, they're actin' like havin' fun is some kind of crime  
If it'll make you feel better mister, I'll tell you one more time  
  
I didn't come here and I ain't leavin'  
I've been thrown into better places than this  
I didn't come here and I ain't leavin'  
Why don't you pucker up, I got just the place for you to kiss  
  
Now, you can call me a taxi  
And you can call me a cab  
I know you're gonna call me something  
When I can't pay this tab  
  
I didn't come here and I ain't leavin'  
I've been thrown into better places than this  
I didn't come here and I ain't leavin'  
If you wanna pucker up, I got just the place for you to kiss  
Why don't you pucker up, I got just the place for you to kiss
