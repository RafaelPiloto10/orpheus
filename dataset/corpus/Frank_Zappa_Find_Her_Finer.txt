Find her finer, sneak up behind her  
Wrapped like a mummy 'till you finally unwind her  
Find her blinder, see who designed her  
Act like a dummy 'till you finally grind her  
  
If you should see a girl on the street  
Now maybe you might think she is sweet  
But if you wanna tickle her treat  
Now really, what should you do?  
(Rat-tat-tat-tat ta-da!)  
  
Don't never let her know you are smart  
The universe is no place to start  
You gotta play it straight from the heart  
She gwine renunciate you  
(That's why you gotta)  
  
Find her finer, sneak up behind her  
Wrapped like a mummy 'till you finally unwind her  
Find her blinder, see who designed her  
Act like a dummy 'till you finally grind her  
  
Now maybe you might think this is crude  
And maybe you might think I am rude  
And maybe this approach I have spewed  
Is not the one for you  
(Rat-tat-tat-tat ta-da!)  
  
But believe me later on you'll find  
As you impress her with your mind  
That you would just be left behind  
For a wiser fool  
(So you might as well)  
  
Find her finer, sneak up behind her  
Wrapped like a mummy 'till you finally unwind her  
Find her blinder, see who designed her  
Act like a dummy 'till you finally grind her  
  
Find her finer, sneak up behind her  
Wrapped like a mummy 'till you finally unwind her  
Find her blinder, see who designed her  
Act like a dummy 'till you finally grind her  
  
Find her finer, sneak up behind her  
Wrapped like a mummy 'till you finally unwind her  
Find her blinder, see who designed her  
Act like a dummy 'till you finally grind her  
  
Find her finer, sneak up behind her  
Wrapped like a mummy 'till you finally unwind her  
Find her blinder, see who designed her  
Act like a dummy 'till you finally grind her  
  
Find her finer, sneak up behind her  
Wrapped like a mummy 'till you finally unwind her  
Find her blinder, see who designed her  
Act like a dummy 'till you finally grind her
