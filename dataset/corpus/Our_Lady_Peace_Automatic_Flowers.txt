And Sara thinks she's died here once before  
She's crazy  
A pop-up book of flowers from grade four  
Are driving her insane  
  
No-one knows why  
She's sad tonight  
No-one can help her find  
Crying, she couldn't afford the view  
Crying, these automatic flowers won't do  
  
Another brick  
Another window frames the confusion  
Her garden blooms but Sara can't see straight  
She's drinking herself blind  
  
No-one knows why  
She's stares outside  
No-one can help her find  
Crying, she couldn't afford the view  
Crying, these automatic flowers won't do  
These automatic flowers won't do
