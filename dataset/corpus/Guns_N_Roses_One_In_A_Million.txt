Yes I needed some time to get away  
I needed some peace of mind  
Some peace of mind that'll stay  
So I thumbed it. Now it's six in L.A.  
Maybe a greyhound could be my way  
  
Police and niggers, that's right  
Get outta my way  
Don't need to buy none of your  
Gold chains today  
Now don't need no bracelets  
Clamped in front of my back  
Just need my ticket 'till then  
Won't you cut me some slack  
  
You're one in a million  
Yeah that's what you are  
You're one in a million babe  
You're a shooting star  
Maybe some day we'll see you  
Before you make us cry  
You know we tried to reach you  
But you were much to high.  
Much too high...  
Much too high...  
Much too high...  
  
Immigrants and fagots  
They make no sense to me  
They come to our country  
And think they'll do as they please  
Like start some mini-Iran  
Or spread some fucking disease  
And they talk so many God damn ways  
It's all Greek to me  
  
Well some say I'm lazy  
And others say that's just me  
Some say I'm crazy  
I guess I'll always be  
But it's been such a long time  
Since I knew right from wrong  
It's all the means to and end I'm  
I keep it moving along  
Hey, hey, hey, yeah  
  
You're one in a million  
You're a shooting star  
You're one in a million babe  
You know that you are  
Maybe some day we'll see you  
Before you make us cry  
You know we tried to reach you  
But you were much to high  
Much too high  
Much too high  
  
Radicals and racists  
Don't point your finger at me  
I'm a small town white boy  
Just tryin' to make ends meet  
Don't need your religion  
Don't watch that much TV  
Just makin' my livin' baby  
Well that's enough for me  
  
You're one in a million  
Yeah that's what you are  
You're one in a million babe  
You're a shooting star  
Maybe some day we'll see you  
Before you make us cry  
You know we tried to reach you  
But you were much too high  
Much too high  
Much too high
