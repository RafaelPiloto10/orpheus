It's my time, It's my life, I can do what I like  
For the price of a smile,  
I got a ticket to ride,  
So I keep living, 'cause it feels right  
And it's so nice,  
And I'd do it all again  
This time, it's forever  
It gets better, and I, I, I like how it feels  
  
I like how it feels, I like how it feels  
I like how it feels, I like how it feels  
I like how it feels,  
  
So just turn it up, let me go  
I'm alive, yes you know, never stop  
Give me more, more, more  
'Cause I like how it feels  
Oh yeah, I like how it feels  
You know I like how it feels  
Oh yeah I like how it feels  
  
Show me love, make us one,  
Let's make a beautiful world  
Take my hand, it's alright  
'Cause tonight we can fly  
  
So we keep living, 'cause it feels right  
And it's so nice, and I'd do it all again  
This time, it's forever  
It gets better, and I, I, I like how it feels  
  
I like how it feels, I like how it feels  
I like how it feels, I like how it feels  
I like how it feels,  
  
So just turn it up, let me go  
I'm alive, yes you know, never stop  
Give me more, more, more  
'Cause I like how it feels  
Oh yeah, I like how it feels  
You know I like how it feels  
Oh yeah I like how it feels  
  
What you consider the best, I consider mediocre,  
I want my bank account like Carlos slim's, or at least mini Oprah  
Baby just close your eyes and imagine any part in the world, I've been there  
I'm like global warming, anything I just start to heat the things up, but I've
been here  
Time traveler, two time zones, give me some of my vodka any zone,  
Enrique Iglesias, and translation, Enrique Churches, confession  
Dale mamita, dimelo todo, alante tu hombre, yo me hago el bobo  
No te preocupes, baby for real  
Because you gonna like how it feels  
  
'Cause I like how it feels  
Ooh yeah, I like how it feels  
You know I like how it feels  
Oh yeah I like how it feels  
  
I like how it feels  
I like how it feels
