Force yourself to use your brain,  
The only way to gain,  
A lot of things are just a lie.  
This world we love comes down in pain  
With hate and bloody games  
A question-mark up in the sky.  
  
Look, you can't keep away  
And you can't hide  
Tomorrow, yesterday, today ...  
  
Some people say, we'll do it better  
Some people say, everything's good  
Some people sing, let's come together  
But nobody has ever brought it through  
Maybe you and me ...
