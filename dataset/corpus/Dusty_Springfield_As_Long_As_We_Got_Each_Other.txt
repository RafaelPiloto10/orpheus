Show me that smile again  
Oh, show me that smile  
Don't waste another minute on your cryin'  
We're nowhere near the end  
We're nowhere near  
The best is ready to begin  
  
All in a cloudy daze  
I look into your eyes and see them shining out  
Holding you close this way  
Holding you this way  
Is like having summer everyday  
Ooh, ooh  
  
As long as we got each other  
We got the world spinnin' right in our hands  
Baby, you and me  
We gotta be  
The luckiest dreamers who never quit dreamin'  
  
As long as we keep on givin'  
We can take anything that comes our way  
Baby, rain or shine  
All the time  
We got each other  
Sharin' the laughter and love  
  
Promise me here and now  
Nothing but jokes  
Will never come between us  
You can depend on me  
'Cause I need you like the air I breathe  
Oh, oh  
  
As long as we got each other  
We got the world spinnin' right in our hands  
Baby, you and me  
We gotta be  
The luckiest dreamers who never quit dreamin'  
  
As long as we keep on givin'  
We can take anything that comes our way  
Baby, rain or shine  
All the time  
We got each other  
Sharin' the laughter and love  
  
As long as we got each other  
We got the world spinnin' right in our hands  
Baby, you and me  
We gotta be  
The luckiest dreamers who never quit dreamin'  
  
As long as we keep on givin'  
We can take anything that comes our way  
Oh, baby, rain or shine  
All the time  
We got each other  
Sharin' the laughter and love
