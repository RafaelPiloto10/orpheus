My head's in a jam can't take you off my mind  
From the time we met I've been beset by thoughts of you  
And the more that I ignore this feeling  
The more I find my self believin'  
That I just have to see you again  
  
Refrain  
I can't let you pass me by  
I just can't let you go but I know  
That I am much too shy to let you know  
Afraid that I might say the wrong  
Words and displease you  
Afraid for love to fade  
Before it can come true  
  
Like a child again  
I'm out and lost for words  
How does one define a crush combined with longing  
Longing to posses you oh so dearly  
I'm obsessed by you completely  
I'll go mad if I can't have you  
  
I can't let you pass me by  
I just can't let you go but I know  
That I am much too shy to let you know  
Afraid that I might say the wrong  
Words and displease you  
Afraid for love to fade  
Before it can come true  
  
I can't let you pass me by  
I just can't let you go  
Let me say the things and say the words to let you know  
I would rather say the awkward words than lose you  
Or for love to fade  
Before it can come true
