The only place where you can dream, living here is not what it seems.  
Ship of white light in the sky, nobody there to reason why.  
Here I am, I'm not really there, smiling faces ever so rare.  
A let's walk in deepest space, living here just isn't the place.  
  
Stalks of light come from the ground, when I cry there isn't a sound.  
All my feelings cannot be held, I'm happy in my new strange world.  
Shades of green grasses twine, girls drinking plasma wine.  
A look at love, a dream unfolds, living here, you'll never grow old.  
  
Don't you hear me call? Oh
