Let's start in style, let's dance for a while,  
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies.  
Hoping for the best, but expecting the worst,  
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?  
  
Let us die young or let us live forever  
We don't have the power, but we never say never  
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip  
The music's for the sad man.  
  
Can you imagine when this race is won?  
Turn our golden faces into the sun,  
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune  
The music's played by the madman.  
  
Forever young,  
I want to be forever young.  
Do you really want to live forever?  
Forever, and ever  
  
Forever young,  
I want to be forever young  
Do you really want to live forever?  
Forever young.  
  
Some are like water, some are like the heat  
Some are a melody and some are the beat  
Sooner or later they all will be gone  
Why don't they stay young?  
  
It's so hard to get old without a cause  
I don't want to perish like a fading horse  
Youth's like diamonds in the sun,  
And diamonds are forever  
  
So many adventures couldn't happen today,  
So many songs we forgot to play  
So many dreams swinging out of the blue  
Oh let them come true  
  
Forever young,  
I want to be forever young.  
Do you really want to live forever,  
Forever, and ever?  
  
Forever young,  
I want to be forever young.  
Do you really want to live forever,  
Forever young?  
  
Forever young  
I want to be forever young  
Do you really want to live forever,  
Forever, and ever?  
  
Forever young,  
I want to be forever young.  
Do you really want to live forever?
