It's Wu motherfuckers, ah Wu-Tang motherfuckers  
  
Reunited, double LP, world excited  
Struck a match to the underground, industry ignited  
From metaphorical parables to fertilize the Earth  
Wicked niggas come, try to burglarize the turf  
Scattin' off soft-ass beats them niggas rap happily  
Tragically, that style, deter-iate, rapidly  
Uncompleted missions, throwin' your best known compositions  
You couldn't add it up, if you mastered addition  
Where I come from, gettin' visual is habitual  
De-mon-strate walkin' on hot coal, in rituals  
I splash the paint on the wall, it formed the mural  
He took a look, saw the manifestation of it, was plural  
Rhymin' while impaired, dart hit your garment  
Pierced your internal, streamlined compartments  
Just consider the unparallel advantage  
Of a natural disaster that's impossible to manage  
  
Bitch ass niggaz counterfeit the funk  
I smoke the feet of the skunk, tree top of the trunk  
Moonshine drunken monk, Ya head, get shrunk  
The touch of skunk, I be fuckin' bitches by the chunk  
My name black, do words wanna play in my dirt?  
Bitch stop my momma serve, free lunch from the church  
I come like a thousand doves  
Bitch you quiet at the bus, makin' the fuss, I gots tough love  
Unglove the news, watch a nigga transfuse  
Dirty add to the fuse, heavy at the booze  
I don't walk, I get carried  
Gold and platinum frisbee's on my wall, lookin' properly  
But come-ly, I U.F.O. you Wright Brothers  
The Indian that sold Manhattan to the white man  
My grandfather, step up and get knocked right the fuck out  
Come to the cook-out, Dirty bitch at the mouth  
You scared? Run around like a plane about to crash  
  
Wu-Tang motherfuckers  
Wu-Tang motherfuckers  
Yeah, and RZA  
  
Yo, yo, The Riddler, funny bone tickler, freak Caligula  
Bigger dick sex enigma pistol fertilize your stigma  
Stink box, order from pink dot  
MC's get stuck on ink blots as I plug to the sink box  
Wu-Tang Incorp. take your brain on spacewalk  
Talk strange like B-jork, great hero Jim Thorpe  
How can I put it? Life is like video footage  
Hard to edit, directors, that never understood it  
I'm too impulsive, my deadly corrosive dosage  
Attack when you least notice through explosive postage  
I don't play, the rap souflee saute for the day  
Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig A, Leg Leg Arm Head  
Spread like plague, we drink Hennessee by the jig  
I got the golden egg plus the goose  
Eighty proof, Absolut, mixed with cranberry fruit juice  
Ginseng boost, I got yo' neck in a noose  
Keep my money wrinkled, the rap star twinkle killer instinct  
Sixteen bar nickle sell more copies than Kinko  
Grow like a fetus with no hands and feet to complete us  
And we return like Jesus, when the whole world need us  
  
Is it appetite for destruction  
Slap a murder rap on this production, I touch somethin' trust nothin'  
Iron Lung, Twisted Metal  
I see em duckin' my dart gun, bustin', from every angle  
Worldwide total carnage, the sickest flow  
That be code named Agent Orange, killin' you slow  
It's only right you pay homage  
To those that's bout to blow like that shit up your nose, solid  
As a rock when I strike target, verbal  
Be screamin' on you like a drill sergeant, her-bals  
Got me where I wanna be right now, don't know the time  
Check the hour on your sundial, watch me shine  
Drunk off of cheap wine  
Each line be on point when I speak mine  
On behalf of my crew, Su, enter the Wu  
Thirty-Six more deadly Chambers, to take you through  
  
It's Wu motherfuckers, Wu-Tang motherfuckers
