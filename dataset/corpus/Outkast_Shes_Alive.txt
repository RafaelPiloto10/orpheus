[Bridge: Andre 3000]  
A boy  
To raise  
At a  
Young age  
No help  
From him  
But she's alive  
To be  
Made strong  
But all  
Alone  
Must be  
A pain  
But she's alive  
  
[Andre 3000]  
The year was 1975  
That night crickets cried  
They knew what was going down  
Three girls travel a long country road  
And one said she thinks it's time  
This baby wants to come right now  
  
[Bridge]  
  
I was scufflin' going to school  
I was scufflin' working at night  
And you know what  
I truly believe  
And that's why I tell a lot of parents  
Single parents, don't tell me what God can't do.  
I made sure you had  
I never felt like you should be deprived of anything  
If a man didn't want to take care of his child  
You move on  
And that's what I did  
I moved on

A boy  
To raise  
At, at a  
Young age  
No help  
From him  
But she's alive  
  
He always wanted to be a father  
But he never took care of you  
He ain't have no money  
He ain't have nothin'  
How can you care about somebody  
And you never give the welfare of them

A boy  
To raise  
At a  
Young age  
No help  
From him  
But she's alive  
To be  
Made strong  
But all  
Alone  
Must  
  
And I knew I had to go that road by myself  
  
[Andre 3000]  
She's alive
