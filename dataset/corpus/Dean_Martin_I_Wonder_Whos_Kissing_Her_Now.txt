I wonder who's kissing her now  
I wonder who's teaching her now  
I wonder who's looking right smack in the eyes  
Oh breathing sighs and telling lies  
  
Well I wonder who's buying the wine  
For the lips that I used to call mine  
Well I wonder if she ever tells him of me  
Wonder who's kissing her now  
  
Oh I wonder who's buying the wine  
For the lips that I used to call mine  
Well I wonder if she ever tells him of me  
I wonder who's kissing her now
