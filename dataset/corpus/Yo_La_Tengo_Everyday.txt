I want summer's sad songs behind me.  
I want a laugh a minute, without fail  
Want to be Paul Le Mat in 1980  
Looking to forget tomorrow, looking everyday.  
  
I want to see you put your hands together.  
I want to cross my heart  
I want to hope to die  
I hear Kate Moss talk, she talks to me  
She's looking for a new beginning everyday.  
  
When Monday comes I want nothing  
Come Tuesday morning I want the same  
The days and nights fly by  
Looking to embrace the nothing, of the everyday
