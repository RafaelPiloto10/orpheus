One thing I remember  
I was headed for the door  
Then I felt an anger  
Like never before  
I guess you had your reasons  
For makin up your lies  
But when I saw you later  
You had tears in your eyes  
Hey, hey, hey, I'm gonna make it all right now  
Hey, hey, hey, I'm gonna take it all the way  
Stranded, Stranded  
Though you left me standing there alone  
Stranded, Stranded  
I always will believe that life goes on  
The next thing I remember  
I pretended I was strong  
I asked you to surrender  
But the words came out wrong  
You know I feel mistreated  
Wounded deep within  
I'll never stand defeated  
No I'll never give in  
Nothin can stop me now
