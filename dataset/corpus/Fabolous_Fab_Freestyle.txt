Fabolous,  
Funk flex, volume 4, niggas, c'mon...  
  
Yo, it's gettin' hard to dodge the women, but I'm still pitchin' hard white  
Balls faster than Roger Clemens  
Y'all know the kid with the "O"s that's as large as linens, when it comes to  
Selling trees--I'm as large as Timberland  
My lawyer got my charges slimin', he said the only way you going upstate, if  
Its along with women  
Pull out the garage like Gremlins, a rockford fos. System in it, that'll have  
The projects tremblin'  
Yall know nothin' bout lettin' a few sprays go off, yall only reach for your  
Hip when your 2-way goes off  
Shots'll fly by your head, your tupee blow off, I aint Crip, I'm just a  
Blue-grey show-off,  
Ghetto Fab, I more than rap for my bucks, keep two nines on me like Warren  
Sapp from the Bucs'  
The word I'm ballin', be flowin' til my jet shakes, and I keep chicks in my  
Lap--throwin' me head fakes  
Nigga, I walk around with them grands you stackin', and me and Flex don't  
Roll unless they Andrew Jacksons  
It's Brooklyn by me, the crook that I be, y'all even look or eye me, y'all  
Gettin' hooked to an I. V., mutherfuckers
