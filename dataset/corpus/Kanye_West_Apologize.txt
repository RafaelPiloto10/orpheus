[Verse 1]  
There must be more good women than men percentage wise  
So her chance of having a husband just minimize  
That's why a lot of girls claim they ain't into guys  
And mess with other girls part time to improvise  
I knew she wouldn't vibe  
No I seen her inner eyes  
But I'm like any other guy trying to get in her thighs  
She telling me about how black people should enterprise  
And I'm like, if you don't get your ass in this ride from enterprise  
That I rented yesterday and gotta have in by 5  
With the gas fully filled up like I didn't drive  
Told her I had a girl, nah fuck it I didn't lie  
Told her this rap game is alright. I'm just getting by.  
She had a lil weed and we get a lil high  
And I'm looking in her eyes and I'm loving her vibe  
Told me back in 95' she fell in love with the tribe  
Boo back in 92' I was just like you  
Please don't be confused by the ice and jewels  
I'm like any other nigga buy ice to stay cool  
Like any other nigga that claim they hate school  
And think yeah Free's banging but she's no Rachel  
  
[Chorus](x2)  
We ball til we fall  
Hit the mall  
After we  
Hit don't call  
We fill your lives  
With nothing but lies  
And I would like to  
Apologize  
  
But you can't stand right here  
And tell me everything is going to be alright  
Cause until the day a real man stands up  
I'm going to have to improvise  
  
[Verse 2]  
Was it something I did wrong?  
Yeah I know I'm wrong  
She's at home alone and I'm always gone  
Hate it when she mad but more when she passive  
Now she on the internet looking for classes  
Out of state though, man that hurt yo  
But I got work though, and I'm at work yo  
And she don't call a lot  
And when she do she pouring out her heart  
You never listen to me then the call drop hmmm  
And I promised her everything  
Told her when I get a deal I'll get her a wedding ring  
But when I got my deal I was back in the ring  
Fighting my urges, strip club splurges  
Never had money so I feel like a virgin  
And I'm trying to break the bank's cherry  
Trying to see can I afford Canaries, with a Ferrari, and a dinner date with
Halle Berry?  
When from 50 g's to fifteen hundred in a week  
Now I'm trying to call..one ring...two rings...seven rings...eight rings  
Her mother picked up the phone  
Like she in school and she don't stay here no more  
I guess there's more good women than men percentage wise  
So her chance of having a husband just minimize  
I guess that's why she says she ain't into guys  
And focus on school full-time to improvise  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No no, you can't stand right here  
And tell me everything is gonna be alright  
Cause until that real man stands up  
I'm going to have to improvise (x3)
