Ryder:  
My love must be a kind of blind love  
I can't see anyone but you  
Are the stars out tonight?  
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright  
  
Ryder with Finn, Artie, Sam and Joe:  
I only have eyes for you, dear  
  
Ryder:  
The moon maybe high  
But I can't see a thing in the sky  
  
Ryder with Finn, Artie, Sam and Joe:  
I only have eyes for you  
  
Ryder:  
I don't know if we're in a garden  
Or on a crowded avenue  
You are here  
So am I  
Maybe millions of people go by  
  
Ryder:  
But they  
  
Ryder with Finn, Artie, Sam and Joe:  
All disappear from view  
  
Ryder:  
And I only have eyes for you (Finn, Artie, Sam and Joe: Only have eyes)  
  
Ryder with Finn, Artie, Sam and Joe:  
I only have eyes for you
