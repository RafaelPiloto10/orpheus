Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant, the livest one  
Representing BK to the fullest  
Gats I pull it, bastards ducking when Big be bucking  
Chickenheads be clucking in my bathroom fucking  
It ain't nothing, they know Big be handling  
With the mac in the Ac' door paneling  
Damagin MC's, oxygen they can't breathe  
Mad tricks up the sleeve, wear boxers so my dick can breathe  
Breeze through in the Q-45 by my side, lyrical high  
And those that rushes my clutches get put on crutches  
Get smoked like dutches from the master  
Hate to blast you, but I have to, you see I smoke a lot  
Your life is played out like Kwame, and them fucking polka dots  
Who rock the spot? Biggie  
You know how the weed go, unbelievable  
  
B-I-G, G-I-E, AKA, B.I.G  
Get it? Biggie  
Also known as the bon appetit  
Rappers can't sleep need sleeping Big keep creeping  
Bullets heat-seeking, casualties need treating  
Dumb rappers need teaching  
Lesson A - don't fuck with B-I, that's that  
Oh I, thought he was wack. Oh come come now  
Why y'all so dumb now - hunt me or be hunted  
I got three hundred and fifty-seven ways  
To simmer saute, I'm the winner all day  
Lights get dimmer down Biggie's hallway  
My forte causes Caucasians to say  
He sounds demented, car weed scented  
If I said it, I meant it  
Bite my tongue for no-one  
Call me evil, or unbelievable  
  
Buck shots out the sun roof of Lexus Coupes  
Leave no witnesses, what you think this is?  
Ain't no amateurs here, I damage and tear  
MC's fear me, they too near not to hear me  
Clearly, I'm the triple beam dream  
One thousand grams of uncut to the gut  
It seems fucked up, the way I touched up the grill  
Trying to play gorilla, when you ain't no killer  
The gat's by your liver, your upper lip quiver  
Get ready to die, tell God I said hi  
And throw down some ice, for the nicest MC  
Niggas know the steelo, unbelievable
