I could find another girl to kiss me  
I could find another girl to miss me  
I could find another girl who wants to be true  
But I'll never get over you  
I got over Marie Lou, I got over Suzie Q  
I got over Connie too  
I got over losing you to somebody new  
But I'll never get over you  
No, I'll never get over you  
Ah, ah, oh no, ah, ah  
No, I'll never get over you  
Oh no, my heart tells me so  
I don't know just what there is about you  
But I know that I can't live without you  
I could find another girl to flirt with  
I could find another girl to hurt with  
I could find another girl almost like you  
But I'll never get over you  
I got over Linda Lou, I got over Peggie Sue  
I got over Betty too  
I got over losing you to somebody new  
But I'll never get over you  
No, I'll never get over you  
Oh no, ah, ah, oh no  
No, I'll never get over you  
Oh no, my heart tells me so  
No, I'll never get over you  
Ah, ah, oh no, ah, ah  
No, I'll never get
