It's over before it starts  
Oh don't you know  
So on your marks, stand by, ready go  
From london to new york  
Montreal to tokyo  
I see visions of her  
Everywhere I go  
  
What have I become  
Now that I'm alone  
I'm just looking for a way to break  
Free of these walls and  
And I'm just looking for a place that  
I can call I can call my home yeah  
Has anybody out there got a soul  
Cause I'm just looking for a girl  
The girl with a heart of gold  
  
She always comes once  
Again with her champagne taste  
She goes straight down the rat hole  
With her total recklessness  
And tomorrow will come on through  
And I got nothing but a silhouette girl  
Met her in the darkness  
  
And I say...  
What have I become  
Now that I'm all alone  
And I just looking for a way to break free of these walls and  
And I'm just looking for a place  
That I can call my home  
Has anybody out there got a soul  
Cause I'm just looking for a girl  
The girl with a heart of gold  
You know I'm just lookin for a girl  
The girl with a heart of gold  
  
Yeah I'm in a corner  
I'll start over  
Start the whole slate clean  
All the pain and heartache and all the years  
I was always to blame  
I dream of this girl  
??????  
Met her in my neighborhood  
I'm a downtown member in a dark lot  
Don't let me be misunderstood  
I'm a downtown member in a dark lot  
Don't let me be misunderstood  
  
Don't let me be misunderstood  
  
I'm just looking for a way to break free of these walls yeah  
I'm just looking for a place I can call my home  
Has anybody out there got a soul  
I'm just looking for a girl  
The girl with a heart of gold
