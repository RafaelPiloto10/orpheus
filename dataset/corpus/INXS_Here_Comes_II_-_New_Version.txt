Here comes the rationalization  
Here comes the song I know  
There's a change of weather comin'  
There's a change in me and you  
  
I found some questions to the answers  
The dancing flames of romances  
  
Freedom is intoxicatin'  
It's a lizard in your hand  
Don't you worry about the future  
I need some in my plan  
  
I found some questions to the answers  
The dancing flames of romances  
  
I found some questions to the answers  
The dancing flames of romances  
  
Here comes my kamikaze  
Here comes God's top ten  
Nothin' to be done to stop it  
Nothin' to get in its way  
  
Here comes the rationalization  
Here comes the song we know  
There's a change of weather comin'  
There's a change in me and you  
  
I found some questions to the answers  
The dancing flames of romances  
  
I found some questions to the answers  
The dancing flames of romances  
  
Flames of romances  
I found some questions
