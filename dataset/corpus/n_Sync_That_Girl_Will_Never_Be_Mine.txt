That girl will never be mine  
First time  
I saw her at the front door  
That girl  
Her face on every billboard  
Hands down  
You won't believe the way she laid her eyes on me  
Six feet  
What was I thought I got I'd get for  
So fly  
We got into a small talk  
Too bad  
She had to move along  
One smile and she was gone  
  
Can't explain  
I never thought that I was gonna loose my head  
Call me insane  
There's got to be a way  
  
How can I get next to her?  
Now, tell me how it's gonna be done  
Will I win or lose this one?  
Don't care about the fact  
She's in a different league  
They say it's no use that I try  
That girl will never be mine  
  
Next thing  
She's livin' in my TV  
And that girl  
Is stealin' every daydream  
Tough love  
She had to be the one for me  
When I just sing away  
Last night ran into a big thing  
Guess what  
She didn't want to see me  
They said I was outta line  
Who's wrong, who's right this time?  
  
Can't explain  
I never thought that I was gonna lose my head  
Call me insane  
There's got to be a way  
  
How can I get next to her?  
Now, tell me how it's gonna be done  
Will I win or lose this one?  
Don't care about the fact  
She's in a different league  
They say it's no use that I try  
That girl will never be mine  
  
That girl  
Is freakin' me out  
Don't care about the fact  
That she's all that  
That girl  
Is pullin' out the down  
There's no way for me to stop  
  
That girl  
Tearin' up the big screen  
That girl  
Stealin' every daydream  
Tough love  
She had to be the one for me  
She will be mine  
No matter what they try to say  
There's got to be a way  
  
How can I get next to her?  
Now, tell me how it's gonna be done  
Will I win or lose this one?  
Don't care about the fact  
She's in a different league  
They say it's no use that I try  
They say it's no use that I try  
That girl will never be mine
