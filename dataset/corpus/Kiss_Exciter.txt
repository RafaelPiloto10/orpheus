Oh, deep in the night I am waiting, sent from above, power of love in my hand  
And I know what you want, I know what you need and I know what you feel  
Lose all your fears and live out your dreams  
I'm the one who's gonna make it real  
Passion and fire, lust and desire, exciter  
Pleasure and pain, this is my name, exciter  
  
Oh, heaven is yours for the taking, power of love, sent from above in your
hand  
And I'll give you more than ever before, so take all you need  
When you open your arms, open your eyes, I'm the one who's gonna make you see  
  
[Chorus:]  
Passion and fire, lust and desire, exciter  
Pleasure and pain, whisper my name, exciter  
Surrender to me and I'll guarantee, you'll pray that the night never ends  
Come play the game, this is my name, exciter  
  
And I'll show you a world where you've never been, it's time that you knew  
There's no time for waiting, it's time to begin, I'm the one's gonna take you
