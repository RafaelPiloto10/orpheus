[Verse 1]  
Tell me what you want  
What you like  
It's okay  
I'mma little curious too  
Tell me if it's wrong  
If it's right  
I don't care  
I can keep a secret could, you?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Got my mind on your body  
And your body on my mind  
Got a taste for the cherry  
I just need to take a bite  
Don't tell your mother  
Kiss one another  
Die for each other  
We're cool for the summer  
(Ha)  
  
[Chorus]  
Ooh  
Ooh  
Take me down into your paradise  
Don't be scared cause I'm your body type  
Just something that we wanna try  
Cause you and I  
We're cool for the summer  
  
[Verse 2]  
Tell me if I won  
If I did  
What's my prize?  
I just wanna play with you, too  
Even if they judge  
Fuck it all  
Do the time  
I just wanna have some fun with you  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Got my mind on your body  
And your body on my mind  
Got a taste for the cherry  
I just need to take a bite  
Don't tell your mother  
Kiss one another  
Die for each other  
We're cool for the summer  
(Ha)  
  
[Chorus]  
Ooh  
Ooh  
Take me down into your paradise  
Don't be scared cause I'm your body type  
Just something that we wanna try  
Cause you and I  
We're cool for the summer  
(Ha)  
We're cool for the summer  
We're cool for the summer  
  
[Bridge]  
Shhhh...don't tell your mother  
Got my mind on your body  
And your body on my mind  
Got a taste for the cherry  
I just need to take a bite  
  
[Chorus]  
Take me down into your paradise  
Don't be scared cause I'm your body type  
Just something that we wanna try  
Cause you and I  
We're cool for the summer  
  
[Outro]  
(Take me down) We're cool for the summer  
(Don't be scared) Cause I'm your body type  
Just something that we wanna try  
Cause you and I  
We're cool for the summer  
(Ha)  
Ooh  
We're cool for the summer
