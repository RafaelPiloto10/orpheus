Wishing on a shooting star  
But dreams alone won't get you far  
Can't deny your feeling anymore  
The world is waiting right outside your door  
What are you waiting for  
Come on heres your chance  
Don't let it slip right through your hands  
Are you ready for the ride of your life  
Your dreams arive on the wind  
Just reach out and pull them in  
Get ready for the ride of your life  
The ride of your life  
In your heart you know what you must do  
You only got yourself to answer to  
Don't let fear of falling hold you down  
Your spirts flying high above the clouds  
You go right there  
Come on heres your chance  
Don't let it slip right through your hands  
Are you ready for the ride of your life  
Your dreams arive on the wind  
Just reach out and pull them in  
Get ready for the ride of your life  
Your on your way no looking back  
And there's no future living in the past  
Your free at last  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Your free at last  
Come on heres your chance  
Don't let it slip right through your hands  
Are you ready for the ride of your life  
Your dreams arive on the wind  
Just reach out and pull them in  
Get ready for the ride of your life  
The ride of your life  
Come on

Get ready  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Your dreams arvie on the wind  
Just reach out and pull them in  
Get ready for the ride of your life
