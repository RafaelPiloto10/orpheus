In pitch dark  
I go walking in your landscape  
Broken branches  
Trip me as I speak  
  
Just 'cause you feel it  
Doesn't mean it's there  
Just 'cause you feel it  
Doesn't mean it's there  
  
There's always a siren  
Singing you to shipwreck  
(Don't reach out, don't reach out  
Don't reach out, don't reach out)  
  
Stay away from each rocks  
We'd be a walking disaster  
(Don't reach out, don't reach out  
Don't reach out, don't reach out)  
  
Just 'cause you feel it  
Doesn't mean it's there  
(Someone on your shoulder  
Someone on your shoulder)  
  
Just 'cause you feel it  
Doesn't mean it's there  
(Someone on your shoulder  
Someone on your shoulder)  
  
There there!  
  
Why so green and lonely?  
Lonely, lonely?  
  
Heaven sent you to me  
To me, to me?  
  
We are accidents waiting  
Waiting to happen  
  
We are accidents waiting  
Waiting to happen
