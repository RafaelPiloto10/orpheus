Pictures building in my head  
Nothing done and nothing said  
Talking to me with your eyes  
What they say is no surprise  
Things are so much different now  
But nothing lasts forever  
You, looking at me, looking at you  
I wanna talk to you  
You, looking at me, looking at you  
Carry on from day to day  
Even when we touch it seems miles away  
I know you know I know too  
Is it me or is it you?  
Things are so much different now  
But nothing lasts forever  
I had a dream that we were through  
I can't imagine nights without you, yeah  
Looks and fixes can we repair  
Talking good and we just stare  
Waste of love is waste of life  
Save our love from the final knife  
Things would be so different then  
Our love would last forever
