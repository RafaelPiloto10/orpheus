Hot summer streets and the pavements are burning  
I sit around  
Trying to smile but the air is so heavy and dry  
Strange voices are saying (ah, what did they say)  
Things I can't understand  
It's too close for comfort  
This heat has got right out of hand  
  
It's a cruel, (cruel) cruel summer  
Leaving me here on my own  
It's a cruel, (it's a cruel) cruel summer  
Now you're gone  
You're not the only one  
It's a cruel  
  
The city is crowded, my friends are away, and I'm on my own  
It's too hot to handle so I gotta get up and go, and go  
  
It's a cruel, (cruel) cruel summer  
Leaving me here on my own  
It's a cruel, (it's a cruel) cruel summer  
Now you're gone  
You're not the only one  
  
It's a cruel, (cruel) cruel summer  
(Leaving me) Leaving me here on my own  
It's a cruel, (it's a cruel) cruel summer  
Now you're gone  
You're not the only one  
It's a cruel  
  
Now don't you leave me  
Now don't you leave me  
Now don't you leave me  
Come on, come on  
  
Now don't you leave me  
Now don't you leave me  
Now don't you leave me  
Come on, come on  
  
It's a cruel, (cruel) cruel summer (cruel summer)  
Leaving me here on my own (leaving me here all alone)  
  
It's a cruel (it's a cruel) cruel summer (cruel summer)  
(Don't leave me, leave me in this summer)  
You're not the only one (you're not the only one)  
  
It's a cruel, (cruel) cruel summer (cruel summer)  
(You're not the only one at home)  
Leaving me here on my own  
It's a cruel, (it's a cruel) cruel summer (cruel summer)  
Now you're gone  
You're not the only one (it's a cruel summer)  
Cruel summer (cruel summer)  
It's a cruel summer (it's a cruel)  
Cruel summer (cruel summer)  
It's a cruel summer
