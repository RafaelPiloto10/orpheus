Warm and lovely mystery,  
Fire smiling through  
Before this moment fades away  
I want to know you  
I've got lightening in my pocket,  
Thunder in my shoe  
Have no fear I've got something here  
I want to show you  
  
Low, under the falling sky  
Easily we will lie  
While I bring it to you  
  
It's a low road, a high wire  
Going from me to you  
And in your eyes  
The distance left is closing  
I've got a feeling in my oceans  
Blood underneath my skin  
That into your bright fields  
This prison is opening  
  
Low, under the falling sky  
Easily we will lie  
While I bring it to you  
  
Our shadows wake each day  
Though they don't know why  
They hope and try -- live and die  
So leave them in their frozen world  
Come and be my lover  
If only for one stolen moment  
We will live forever  
  
Warm and lovely mystery,  
Can you hear the choir?  
Voices can no longer hold my desire  
Abandon your sad history  
And meet me in the fire  
Our angels wait  
To take us higher and higher  
Higher and higher  
  
Low, under the falling sky  
Easily we will lie  
While I bring it to you
