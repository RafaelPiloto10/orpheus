Well he caught his first whiff in the jungles  
Of'nam  
That slant-eyed catfish tasted better than mom  
Now every single night she drops her big bomb  
Cause he's a bamb00 bimbo  
Those hook marks really show  
Cause he's a bamboo bimb0  
He went for it now everyone knows  
He's a bamboo bimb0  
He caught his first glance in "field and stream"  
That salt water taffy was a fisherman's  
Wet dream  
Now every single night he's still gettin'  
That big ream  
Cause he's a bamboo bimb0  
He fell it and everyone knows  
He's a bamboo bimbo  
Just a monkey with a ring in his nose  
He's a bambo0 bimbo  
Can't say i never told ya so  
He's a bamboo bimb0  
It go on and on and on
