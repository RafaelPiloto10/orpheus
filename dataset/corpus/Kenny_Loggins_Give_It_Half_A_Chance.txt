I wake up  
In the middle of a dream  
To an unfamiliar scene  
Wonder what I fell into  
Who knows why  
People look for alibis  
In a passing stranger's eyes  
What am I supposed to do  
So tonight  
Tell her that you love her tonight  
The only way to know is to try  
tonight  
Give it half a chance  
And the glow  
From the bathroom down the hall  
Lights a mirror on a wall  
Where a stranger stares at me.  
"Hello, stranger,  
Where you been?  
Do you still remember when?  
Well, every heartache has an end  
'N maybe yours is on the way"  
One by one  
Let the nights go on  
And you won't need yesterday  
Beside you  
See yourself in love again  
And believe in the arms you're in  
Tonight.  
[CHORUS]
