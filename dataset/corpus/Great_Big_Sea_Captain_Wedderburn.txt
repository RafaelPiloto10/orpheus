A noblemen's fair daughter  
Came down a narrow lane.  
And met with Captain Wedderburn,  
The keeper of the game  
Now my pretty fair miss  
If it wasn't for the law,  
You and I in the bed might lie  
Roll me over next to the wall  
Roll me over next to the wall  
  
Now, my dear good man, she said  
Do not be perplexed  
Before that you might bed with me  
You must answer questions six.  
Six questions you must answer me,  
And I will ask them all  
And you and I in the bed might lie  
Roll me over next to the wall  
Roll me over next to the wall  
  
What is rounder than a ring,  
And higher than the trees?  
And what is worse than a woman's curse,  
And what is deeper than the sea?  
What bird sings first, which one's best?  
Where does the dew first fall  
And you and I in a bed might lie  
Roll me over next to the wall  
Roll me over next to the wall  
  
The earth is rounder than a ring,  
And heaven is higher than the trees,  
The devil curse is worse than a woman's curse,  
And hell in deeper than the sea  
The lark sings first, the thrush sings best,  
Earth is where the dew falls  
And you and I in a bed might lie  
Roll me over next to the wall  
You and I in the bed might lie  
Roll me over next to the wall  
Roll me over next to the wall  
  
He takes her by her lily-white hand  
And leads her down the hall  
And he takes her by her slender waist  
For fear that she might fall  
And he lays her on a bed of down  
Without a doubt at all  
And he and she lie in one bed  
Roll me over next to the wall  
And she and he lie in one bed  
Roll me over next to the wall  
Roll me over next to the wall  
Roll me over next to the wall
