Breakin' rocks in the hot sun  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
I needed money 'cause I had none  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
  
Well I miss my baby and I feel so bad  
I guess my race is run  
She's the best girl I've ever had  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
  
Robbin' people with a six-gun  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
  
Well I miss my baby and I feel so bad  
I guess my race is run  
She's the best girl I've ever had  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won
