If I had just one tear running down your cheek  
Maybe I could cope maybe I'd get some sleep  
If I had just one moment at your expense  
Maybe all my misery would be well spent  
  
Could you cry a little? Lie just a little?  
Pretend that you're feeling a little more pain?  
I gave, now I'm wanting something in return  
So cry just a little for me  
  
If your love could be caged, honey I would hold the key  
And conceal it underneath the pile of lies you handed me  
And you'd hunt and those lies, they'd be all you'd ever find  
That'd be all you'd have to know for me to be fine, yeah  
  
And you'd cry a little  
You'd die just a little  
And baby I would feel just a little less pain  
I gave, now I'm wanting something in return  
So cry just a little for me  
  
Give it up baby  
I hear you're doing fine  
Nothing's gonna save me  
I can see it in your eyes  
Some kind of heartache  
Honey, give it a try  
I don't want pity  
I just want what is mine  
  
Could you cry a little? Lie just a little?  
Pretend that you're feeling a little more pain?  
I gave, now I'm wanting something in return  
So cry just a little for me  
Yeah  
Cry just a little for me  
Whoa whoa  
Could you cry a little for me?
