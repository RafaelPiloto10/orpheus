I ask you to hold me,but you don't want to hold me-It don't work like  
that  
I want you to love me-I'm losing patience now  
Oh leave me alone(Oh leave me alone)  
Stop asking for more  
I'm goin' home on my own  
Oh leave me alone(Oh leave me alone)  
I'm walkin' out of the door  
I'll make it on my own  
Leave me alone  
Leave me alone  
Leave me alone  
Just leave me alone  
You like me to stroke you  
Careful I don't choke you,did you read my mind?  
You say don't be blue  
Is that the best you can do?  
I've lost my patience now  
(CHORUS)
