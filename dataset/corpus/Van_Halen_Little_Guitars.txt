Senorita I'm in trouble again and I can't get free  
(Senorita) You're exactly what the doctor ordered, come on talk to me  
(Ah) Can't crow before I'm out of the woods  
But there's exceptions to the rule  
(Ah-ah) Senorita, do you need a friend? I'm in love with you  
  
Catch as catch, catch as catch can  
Anybody in their right mind could see, it's you and me  
Oooh-ooo-ooh  
Oooh-oooh  
  
You say you're lonesome, just getting by  
But you turn your eyes from me  
Be sure you're hurting long before you fly 'cause, you've got me  
  
Catch as catch, catch as catch can  
Anybody in their right mind could see, you and me  
Catch as catch, catch as catch can  
When I see you, all your little guitars sing to me  
  
I can see you don't know which way to turn  
But the sun still shines  
(Senorita) Don't you know that you can dance with me, anytime?  
(Ah) Can't crow before I'm out of the woods  
There's exceptions to the rule  
(Ah-ah) Senorita, do you need a friend? I'm in love with you  
  
Oooh-ooo-ooh  
Oooh-oooh  
Oooh-ooo-ooh  
Oooh-oooh  
Oooh-ooo-ooh  
Oooh-oooh
