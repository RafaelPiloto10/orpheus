I came to you and never asked too much  
Wondering what you would say  
Hoping you'd understand  
It's not a role I usually play  
Don't speak too much of what's been going on  
The past is over and gone  
Give me your troubled mind  
You know it's due  
I can do so much for you  
  
I want you  
Having you near me, holding you near me  
I want you to stay and never go away  
It's so right  
Having you near me, holding you near me  
I'll love you tonight, it feels so right  
Feels so right  
  
You're brave to say that you get lost in love  
But you opened your heart to me  
Underneath all you feel you know  
How deep our love could be  
Tonight we'll touch until it's time to go  
Then I'm leaving it up to you  
Even a fool would know that I'm not through  
I can do so much for you  
  
I want you  
Having you near me, holding you near me  
I want you to stay and never go away  
It's so right  
Having you near me, holding you near me  
I'll love you tonight, it feels so right  
Feels so right
