Enter my mind can you stop the rage  
No one shall mourn or pity my grave  
Fighting the world without remorse  
Searching for blood to never grow old  
A personal hell is where I reside  
Taunting death sounds cadavers in pain  
Judging my soul I am not his son  
Screaming God's name I want some more  
  
[Chorus]  
You love to hate me  
But you won't kill me  
Suicidal surge  
Desensitize the world  
  
Take what I want primordial ground  
Humanity bleeds from inside my veins  
Losing all grasp an evil so old  
Vengeance it breeds driving you insane  
Exhaust all will hanging by the neck  
Anguish within let it blind the eyes  
Better off dead us your epitaph  
Apathy feeds the human demise  
Absolute reign a malevolent mind  
Conceptions so vile in this bottomless soul  
Total addicting, corrupt and profane  
Force-fed lies in this chapel of lust  
Dancing in blood disciples enslaved  
Putrefied walls adorned with your flesh  
Coating this shrine of the ungodly cross  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Pessimistic dreams  
Realistic screams  
Crucify creation  
Magnify damnation  
Enter my mind can you stop the rage  
No one shall mourn or pity my grave  
Fighting the world without remorse  
Searching for blood to never grow old  
Conceptions so vice in this bottomless soul  
Putrefied walls adorned with your flesh  
Coating this shrine of the ungodly cross  
  
[Chorus]
