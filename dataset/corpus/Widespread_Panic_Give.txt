Rain kept pourin' down  
We had places to be  
No funnin' around  
Curiosities  
There were plenty for our heads  
You were somethin' to see  
Do you remember what he said  
  
I know it may sound funny but  
How dare you show up on time  
I can hear you been hidin' in the closet  
I think we better give before we  
Take our lives  
  
Jokers blowin' around  
Ten-minutemen  
Wasn't nowhere to be found  
Curiosities  
There were plenty for our head  
You were listen' to me  
Do you remember what he said  
  
I know it may sound funny but  
How dare you show up on time  
I can hear you laughin' in the closet  
I think we better give before we  
Take our lives  
  
I know it may sound funny but  
How dare you show up on time  
I can hear you laughin' in the closet  
I think we better give before we  
Take our lives  
  
Wasn't slowing down  
Fillin' all our needs  
Circus comin' to town  
Generosities  
There were plenty for our heads  
We were something to see  
Remember what he said  
  
I know it may sound funny but  
How dare you show up on time  
I can hear you hidin' in the closet  
I think we better give before he  
Take our life  
  
He said he's in it for the money but  
I guess there's truth in lies  
'Cause it's your favorite charity  
I think we better give before we  
Take our lives
