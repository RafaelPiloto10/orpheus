There she goes, the one that I love  
The one I've been waiting for  
The one I've been dreaming of  
There she goes, but she'll never be mine  
Wasted all of my chances  
Run clean out of time  
  
There she goes with the wind in her hair  
And a smile on her face  
She doesn't know what I'd give just for one moment  
To be in his place  
Anyway  
Take a look, there she goes  
Take a look, there she goes  
  
There she goes with the wind in her hair  
And a smile on her face  
She doesn't know what I'd give just for one moment  
To be in his place  
  
Anyway  
Take a look, there she goes  
Take a look, there she goes
