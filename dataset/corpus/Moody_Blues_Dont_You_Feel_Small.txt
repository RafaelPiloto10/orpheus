Ask the mirror on the wall  
Who's the biggest fool of all,  
Bet you feel small,  
It happens to us all.  
  
See the world  
Ask what's it for,  
Understanding, nothing more,  
Don't you feel small,  
It happens to us all.  
  
Time is now to spread your voice,  
Time's to come there'll be no choice,  
Why do you feel small,  
It happens to us all.  
  
Look at progress,  
Then count the cost,  
We'll spoil the seas  
With the rivers we've lost.  
  
See the writing on the wall,  
Hear the mirror's warning call.  
That's why you feel small,  
It happens to us all.  
  
Ask the mirror on the wall  
Who's the biggest fool of all,  
Bet you feel small,  
It happens to us all.
