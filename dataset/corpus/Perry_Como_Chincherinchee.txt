Where the jungle trees are tall  
Grows a flower sweet to see  
It's a purdy flower they call "Chincherinchee!"  
There a boy sang all day long  
To a maiden tenderly  
And he called her in his song "Chincherinchee!"  
While the tom toms played  
He sang his serenade  
In the moonlight:  
"Sweet Chincherinchee, you're divine,  
Sweet Chincherinchee say you're mine!  
Say you'll be mine my whole life through!  
Sweet Chincherinchee, I love you!"  
Everyone will agree  
She's as sweet as can be  
She's so kissable and caress-able "Chincherinchee!"  
Everybody can see  
How exciting is she  
She's embraceable, irreplaceable "Chincherinchee!"  
While the tom toms played  
He sang his serenade . . .  
  
Every night they used to meet  
By a tall banyan tree  
Where he sang his heart to sweet "Chincherinchee!"  
While the tom toms played  
He sang his serenade  
In the moonlight:  
"Sweet Chincherinchee, you're divine,  
Sweet Chincherinchee say you're mine!  
Say you'll be mine my whole life through!  
Sweet Chincherinchee, I love you!"  
"Sweet Chincherinchee, you're divine,  
Sweet Chincherinchee say you're mine!  
Say you'll be mine my whole life through!  
Sweet Chincherinchee, I love you!"
