How can I help it if I'm not neat  
If there were creeps before you  
How can I help you if I am weak  
If I don't know how to help me  
But I love you  
I love you  
  
imperfect [x2]  
Imperfectly, I love you  
Imperfect [x2]  
Imperfectly  
  
how can I help it if I'm high strung  
If I was born with a sharp tongue  
Will you marry me if I stay sweet  
If I am the one with the cold feet  
But I love you, I love you  
  
imperfect [x2]  
Imperfectly, I love you  
Imperfect [x2]  
Imperfectly, I love you  
Imperfect [x2]  
Imperfectly (yeah yeah yeah) [x8]
