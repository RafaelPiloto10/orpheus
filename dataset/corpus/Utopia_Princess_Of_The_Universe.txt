Well, I want to shake that thing wit'cha all night long  
Yeah, you're a princess baby, you can do no wrong  
Said you're a beacon of light when the sun is gone  
Yeah, you're a princess baby, you can name that song  
  
Well, they just couldn't touch you with a ten foot pole  
And they just couldn't  
You got so much juice, you make the telephone ring  
You make me jump right up, I want to shake that thing  
  
Wit'cha all night long  
You're the princess of the universe  
You're a princess baby, you can do no wrong  
You're the princess of the universe  
  
Well, I ain't seen nothing like it since the Sha got the rope  
You got a legion of liggers that would shame the Pope  
You just say the word and they run like hell  
You gotta take a cold shower, so your head don't swell  
  
But you can do no wrong  
You're the princess of the universe  
You're a beacon of light when the sun is gone  
You're the princess of the universe  
  
Well, you ain't got a man who can touch what you got  
But you're looking for a subject that can fill that slot  
When the count is down, I want to step in time  
And when your fingers pop, I want to tow that line
