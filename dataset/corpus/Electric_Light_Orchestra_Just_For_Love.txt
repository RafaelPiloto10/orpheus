Falling through the endless sky  
The signals dance upon the twilight  
Calling out to reach someone  
Who waits there in the lonely night  
  
Just for love  
Just for love  
  
Soon beyond the melting clouds  
The light will shine on everyone  
That waits there in the silver rain  
To meet the golden sun  
  
Just for love  
Just for love  
Just for love  
Just for love  
  
I came a long way 'cross the water  
Came a long way to get here  
Round and round in great big circles tryin' to ease my fear  
Out in all the mysteries and distant new tomorrows  
There goes another one don't know which way the wind blows  
  
Just for love  
Just for love  
Just for love  
Just for love  
  
Love ... we're gonna get it right  
Just for love  
We're gonna get it together  
We're gonna get it right  
Just for love  
We're gonna get it together  
We're gonna get it right
