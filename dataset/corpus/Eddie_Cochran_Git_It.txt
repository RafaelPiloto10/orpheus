(Well-oh, well-oh, whap-whip-whip-whip)  
Once there was a girl  
Oh-oh, what a girl  
She said to me, where can it be?  
Where's your Cadillac car?  
A Cadillac car? (Cadillac car)  
Where can I get me a Cadillac car  
I don't have it now but I can get it (git it)  
I don't have it now but I can get it (git it)  
I don't have it now but I can get it (git it)  
I'll do the best I can  
(Git it, git it, git it)  
Once there was a girl  
Oh, she was so sweet  
She said to me, where can it be?  
Where's your diamond ring?  
Diamond ring? (diamond ring)  
Where can I get me a diamond ring?  
I don't have it now but I can get it (git it)  
I don't have it now but I can get it (git it)  
I don't have it now but I can get it (git it)  
I'll do the best I can  
(Git it, git it, git it)
