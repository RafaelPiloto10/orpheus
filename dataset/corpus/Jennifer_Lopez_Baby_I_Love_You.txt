Baby I never knew I could feel  
The way I felt when I felt the way  
You were feeling me baby I'm so out of control, yeah  
  
Every time you look my way  
I realize more and more  
How much I adore those pretty eyes  
Of yours I'm helpless baby  
  
What I want to know is  
Are you willing to try  
Can you love me for a lifetime  
In just one night  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Baby I love you (love you)  
Baby I need you (need you)  
I gotta have you (gotta have you babe)  
Can't be without you  
  
Blessed and cursed on the same day  
The day that I first felt the power of you  
Inside of me, such a strong feeling  
There comes a time in everyones life  
When you know, and everyone around you knows  
That everything is changed,  
You're not the same, it's a new day  
  
Oh what I want to know is,  
Are you willing to try  
There's gotta be more meaning to this  
Than what meets the eye  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, I love the way you kiss me  
Oh, baby please  
I'm about to lose my mind  
0h talk to me, cause I'm begging for you  
And I'm down on my knees  
Baby, I know you're the one that I need  
  
[Chorus]
