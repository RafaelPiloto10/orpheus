Each day just goes so fast  
I turn around, it's past  
You don't get time to hang a sign on me  
  
Love me while you can  
Or I'll get a plan  
  
A lifetime is so short  
A new one can't be bought  
But what you've got means such a lot to me  
  
Make love all day long  
Make love singing songs  
  
Make love all day long  
Make love singing songs  
  
There's people standing round  
Who screw you in the ground  
They'll fill you in with all the things you see  
  
I'll make love to you  
If you want me to
