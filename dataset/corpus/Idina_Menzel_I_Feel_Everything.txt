Like a prima ballerina  
I tip toe, tip toe around you constantly  
I hear the water running  
Will it wash your tears or leak through the ceiling?  
Make my way up a spiral staircase  
Hope to God you had a good day  
  
[Chorus]  
When you're furious  
When you start to freeze  
When you can't be touched  
I feel everything  
And when you despair  
When you cannot breathe  
When you wouldn't dare  
I feel everything  
When you're in ecstasy  
But you're not with me  
I feel everything  
  
On a tightrope  
On a wire  
I'll attempt to jump through a ring of fire  
I am waiting all the while  
For a glimpse of something to bring us higher  
One little foot in front of the other  
Don't you know I'm afraid of thunder  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh  
  
There's a fine line between love and hurting  
And knowing just when to walk away  
  
Like a prima ballerina  
I will tiptoe tiptoe around you constantly  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When you can't be touched  
When you can't be loved  
When you fall apart  
When you have no heart  
I feel everything
