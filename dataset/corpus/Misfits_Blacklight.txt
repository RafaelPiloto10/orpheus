A pounding pulse stirs anxious feelings inside  
Sick breaths of undead life  
  
"Help me angel evil" cried  
The children of the night  
Take this wasted mortal life  
Melt me into blacklight  
  
Lie on the floor and let the body die  
Become the beasts in which you fear  
  
"Help me angel evil" cried  
The children of the night  
Take this wasted mortal life  
Melt me into blacklight  
  
"Help me angel evil" cried  
The children of the night  
Take this wasted mortal life  
Melt me into blacklight  
  
On  
Go
