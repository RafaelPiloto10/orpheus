Seen the man?  
New disease  
Everybody's infected.  
Seen the man?  
He'll storm your heart  
Everybody believes.  
Seen the man?  
Sly new game  
Kiss another cute baby.  
Seen the man?  
No war machine  
So everybody wants peace?  
Everybody's infected  
Everybody believes.  
I've been looking for something  
But it just gets harder  
I could look for ever  
What am I going to do.  
Storm the heart  
Boy threw up  
Everybody's disgusted.  
Storm the heart  
Girl went down  
Everybody looked shocked.  
Storm the heart  
New young thing  
Everybody's obsession.  
Storm the heart  
'Levi' jeans  
Think it's cool to kill.  
Everybody's infected  
Everybody believes.  
One more reason  
One more lie.  
Dreams are cruel  
This is life  
It replaced religion.  
Change your mind  
Make it mine  
Everybody looks sad.  
Dirty film  
Ten years old  
This is Russia infected.  
Party time  
Time runs out  
Everybody go home.  
Everybody's infected  
Everybody believes.
