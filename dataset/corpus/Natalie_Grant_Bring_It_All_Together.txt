I hear you say that you can't go on  
'Cause you had it all and watched it fall away  
You feel betrayed 'cause everything's gone wrong  
Can't find the strength to hope for a better day  
  
We may not understand the reasons  
But I know His promise will never change  
  
He's gonna take your pain  
He's gonna take your doubt  
He's gonna bring it all together  
Bring it all together  
  
Gonna make you happy  
He's gonna make you laugh out loud, yeah  
He's gonna bring it all together  
Bring it all together for good  
  
You say, you're living your life, doing the best you can  
Wondering if the struggle means anything  
If you realized that it's in His hands  
You'll find the peace that sweet surrender brings  
  
Well, we may not understand the reasons  
But I know His promise will never change  
  
He's gonna take your pain  
He's gonna take your doubt  
He's gonna bring it all together  
Bring it all together  
  
Gonna make you happy  
He's gonna make you laugh out loud  
He's gonna bring it all together  
Bring it all together for good  
  
I know there will come a day of healing  
Oh, we will see the master plan  
We will celebrate His faithfulness  
And we'll sing and we'll shout, praise His name  
  
He's gonna take your pain  
He's gonna take your doubt  
He's gonna bring it all together  
Bring it all together  
  
Gonna make you happy  
He's gonna make you laugh out loud
