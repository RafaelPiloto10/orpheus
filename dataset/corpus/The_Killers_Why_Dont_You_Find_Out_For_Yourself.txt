The sanest days are mad  
Why don't you find out for yourself?  
Then you'll see the price  
Very closely  
  
Some men here,  
They have a special interest in your career  
They wanna help you to grow  
And then siphon all your dough  
Why don't you find out for yourself?  
Then you'll see the glass hidden in the grass  
You'll never believe me so  
Why don't you find out for yourself?  
Sick down to my heart  
Well that's just the way it goes  
  
Some men here,  
They know the full extent of your distress  
They kneel and pray  
And they say:  
"Long may it last"  
Why don't you find out for yourself?  
Then you'll see the glass hidden in the grass  
Backseats come and go  
For which you must allow  
Sick down to my heart  
That's just the way it goes  
  
Don't rake up my mistakes  
I know exactly what they are  
And what do you do?  
Well, you just sit there  
I've been stabbed in the back  
So many, many times  
I don't have any skin  
But that's just the way it goes
