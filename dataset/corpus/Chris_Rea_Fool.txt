A dying flame, you're free again  
Who could love and do that to you  
All dressed in black, he won't be coming back  
Save your tears, you've got years and years  
The pains of seventeen's  
Unreal they're only dreams  
Save your crying for the day  
  
Fool if you think it's over  
cause you said goodbye  
Fool if you think it's over  
I'll tell you why  
New born eyes always cry with pain  
At the first look at the morning sun  
You're a fool if you think it's over  
It's just begun  
  
Miss teenage dream, such a tragic scene  
He knocked your crown and ran away  
First wound of pride and how you cried and cried  
But save your tears you've got years and years  
  
Fool if you think it's over  
cause you said goodbye  
Fool if you think it's over  
I'll tell you why  
New born eyes always cry with pain  
At the first look at the morning sun  
You're a fool if you think it's over  
It's just begun  
  
I'll buy your first good wine  
We'll have a real good time  
Save your crying for the day  
That may not come but anyone  
Who had to pay would laugh at you and say  
  
Fool if you think it's over  
cause you said goodbye  
Fool if you think it's over  
I'll tell you why
