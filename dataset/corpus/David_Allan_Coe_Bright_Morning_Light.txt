She was a waitress in a west Texas dance hall  
I was a cowboy with a throat full of sand  
I called her Honey when she brought my whiskey  
And later I left there holding her hand  
Then we walked down the street to a tumble down hotel  
Where she had a room on a cold second floor  
And that room looked like hell just a bed and a table  
A shade on the window and a lock on the door  
I said to myself she's cheap and she's easy  
But she don't look half bad I'll stay for the night  
But I'll leave when it's early cause I've got this feeling  
She won't look so good in the bright morning light  
[ harmonica ]  
I've known some devils and I've known some angels  
I once had a woman on the Mexico line  
But I've never been touched like that woman touched me  
She lay there beside me and crawled in my mind  
And we talked and we smoked and made love till mornin'  
The sun come a streamin' through a hole in the shade  
And it fell like a spotlight on her face and her body  
And it hung like a halo round the bed where we lay  
I said to myself she's cheap and she's easy  
But she don't look half bad I guess I'll stay for the night  
But I'll tell you boys that was five years ago and Lord God what a woman  
She still looks as good in the bright morning light
