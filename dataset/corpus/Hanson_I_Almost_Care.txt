I Almost Care  
Even though I hurt you all the time  
You're on my mind, I won't deny  
Everything I did I take it back  
I'll make it right, at least I'll try  
Now there's only one thing on my mind  
It's taken me some time girl  
I'm ready now to lay it on the line  
I hope you want to try still, you know I will  
Don't give up when you're so close  
Don't give up when you're almost there  
Don't give up when you're so close  
I almost care, I almost care  
I admit I don't know why you'd stay  
I've tried so hard to push you away  
I'm saying all the words you used to say  
It's turned around, you've turned away  
Now there's only one thing on my mind  
It's taken me some time girl  
I'm ready now to lay it on the line  
I hope you want to try still, you know I will  
Don't give up when you're so close  
Don't give up when you're almost there  
Don't give up when you're so close  
I almost care  
Don't give up when you almost care  
Now there's only one thing on my mind  
I hope you want to try still, you know I will  
Don't give up when you're so close  
Don't give up when you're almost there  
Don't give up when you're so close  
I almost care
