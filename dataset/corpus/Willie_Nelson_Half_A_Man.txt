If I only had one arm to hold you  
Well better yet if I had none at all  
Then I wouldn't have two arms that ache  
For you there'd be one less mem'ry to recall  
If I only had one ear to listen to  
The lies that you told to me  
Then I more closely resemble  
The half a man that you've made of me  
If I only had one leg to stand on  
Then how much how much truer picture you'd see  
'Cause then I more closely resemble  
The half a man that you've made of me
