Start off with a hug, lead into embrace  
Oh girl, I'm glad to see you, oh face-to-face  
Not a day of age, oh and by the way  
I forgot to say how much I missed you, baby  
And just like deja vu, I say  
Running into you this way  
I wanna keep you here  
I gotta have you near  
Can I have a kiss from you  
Can I have a kiss from you  
For old times' sake, oh baby  
Can I have a kiss from  
(Can I have a kiss)  
Can I have a kiss from  
(Can I have a kiss)  
For old times' sake, no  
Been a long time since I've called you mine  
Sure would love to see us back together like we used to be  
So let me take you out, so much to talk about  
Like things we used to share and how to get it back, my dear  
Just like deja vu, I say  
Running into you this way  
I wanna keep you here  
I gotta have you near  
Can I have a kiss from  
(Can I have a kiss)  
Can I have a kiss from  
(Can I have a kiss)  
For old times' sake, oh baby  
Can I have a kiss from  
(Can I have a kiss)  
Can I have a kiss from  
(Can I have a kiss)  
For old times' sake  
Oh yeah, well yeah, well, well  
Well, well, well, well  
Can I, can I, can I, can I
