Valerie please believe  
It never could work out  
The time to make plans  
Has passed, faded away  
Oh the way you look  
Makes my starry eyes shiver  
Then I look away  
Too much for one day  
One thing we share  
Is an ideal of beauty  
  
Treasure so rare  
That even devils might care  
Your swimming-pool eyes  
In sea breezes they flutter  
The coconut tears  
Heavy-lidded they shed  
Swaying palms at your feet  
You're the pride of your street  
While you worship the sun  
Summer lover of fun  
Gold number with neighbours  
Who said that you'll go far  
Maybe someday be a star  
A fast mover like you  
And your dreams will all come true  
  
All of my hope, and my inspiration  
I drew from you  
Our life's pattern's drawn in sand  
But the winds could not erase  
The memory of your face  
Deep in the night  
Plying very strange cargo  
Our soul-ships pass by  
Solo trips to the stars, in the sky  
Gliding so far  
That the eye cannot follow  
Where do they go  
We'll never know
