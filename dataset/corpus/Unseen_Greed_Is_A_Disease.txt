If you're sick and disease stricken  
The system's got a cure that you're not getting  
Getting unless you're one of the elite  
And that's the only way that your illness can be beat  
With a nice insurance policy their eyes will light up  
These rich bastard doctors are shady and corrupt  
  
To make a million dollars off of someone's pain  
Those heartless fuckin' bastards have no fuckin' shame  
Medicines and treatments they should all be free  
But that will never happen in our society  
  
If your broke, unhappy they take you in  
If your heavily insured you should see their fuckin' grin  
As you pop your pills, they pop their champaigne  
As your paying off your debt, they're boarding a plane  
Your misfortune pays for their vacation  
And the million dollar homes they resign in  
They don't care about your health, only their wallets  
Their greed is a disease and we gotta stop it  
  
Greed is a disease
