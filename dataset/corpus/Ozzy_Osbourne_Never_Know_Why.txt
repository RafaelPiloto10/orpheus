If we're offensive and pose a  
Threat  
You fear what we represent is  
A mess  
You've missed the message  
That says it all  
And you'll never know hy  
Oh no you'll never know why  
  
We rock  
  
It's just a feeling how we  
Excite  
You cannot rule everybody in  
Sight  
But you condemn don't  
Understand  
And you'll never know why  
Oh no you'll never know hwy  
  
We rock rock rock  
We rock rock rock  
We rock rock rock  
You'll never know why  
We rock  
  
I leave you cold and in disgust  
Don't try to tame me you'll eat  
My dust  
I know that you know not what  
You do  
That's why you'll never know  
Why  
Oh no you'll never know why  
We rock rock rock  
We rock rock rock  
We rock rock rock  
You'll never know why  
We rock rock rock  
We rock rock rock  
We rock rock rock  
You'll never know why  
We rock
