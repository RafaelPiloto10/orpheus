I can give a hundred million reasons  
To build a barricade  
I blame it on the changing of the seasons  
The thoughts that I've conveyed  
  
Does it make it all right?  
It doesn't make it all right  
  
To roll it over my soul and leave me here  
Roll it over my soul and leave me here  
  
Look around at all the plastic people  
Who live without a care  
Try to sit with me around my table  
But never bring a chair  
  
And in your head do you feel  
What you're not supposed to feel  
You take what you want  
But you won't get it for free  
You need more time  
'cause your thoughts and words won't last forever more  
But I'm not sure if it ever works out right  
But it's ok. It's all right  
  
And in your head do you feel  
What you're not supposed to feel  
When you take what you want  
You don't get hope for free  
You need more time  
'cause your thoughts and words won't last forever more  
And I'm not sure if it'll ever, ever, ever work out right  
Will it ever, ever, ever work out right?  
'cause it never, never, never works out right
