Tonight feels like we can do anything we like, oh  
Tonight feels like the best night of my life  
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in  
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in, in in in in  
  
(Put your, put your hands up)  
  
It's 'go' time, press my button yeah blow the stage, grenade  
Oh my, tonight we gon' ring the tank, bananas  
No hold, there ain't no stopping us tonight  
I'm on my crazy, she on a crazy, we on this crazy  
We are amazing  
  
Tonight feels like we can do anything we like, oh  
Tonight feels like the best night of my life  
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in  
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in, in in in in  
  
(Put your, put your hands up)  
  
Take it to the head  
Take it off the edge  
Nothing but the best  
Feeling like a million, million people everywhere  
Put it in the air  
We don't give a damn  
Feeling like a billion, billion  
  
No hold, there ain't no stopping us tonight  
I'm on my crazy, she on a crazy, we on this crazy

(Put your, put your hands up)  
  
Hey you hands on the ceiling  
Nobody move, nobody get shot  
Lip pounds on me  
I love it how a mami went around on me  
So I never get enough of yelling, ven aqui  
Officer on duty, j.lo what they call her  
Take me to jail, cause I wanna be your robber  
Put me in a cell if you really need to holler  
Put me in a cell feed down Flo Rida, hey  
To the sky, put your hands on rock  
Plus nobody telling please that the club is mi casa  
So they wanna freak, on the way you call papa  
Gotta make them sing high notes like Oprah  
When the ego, I got four Leo  
Even the DJ, wanna rep Puerto Rico  
Got it on replay, like you just broke a needle  
Whatever that he say, better listen up people  
  
Tonight, feels like, Tonight, feels like, the best night of my life  
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in, hey!
