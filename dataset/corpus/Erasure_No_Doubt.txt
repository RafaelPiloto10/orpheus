Where it is you wont say, but it hurts  
Put your lips next to mine and apart  
Why wont you open your heart?  
I feel it coming it grows up my spine  
  
I'm dying to show you what love is about  
The tears that are falling  
There's no room for doubt  
For all the changes we've been through  
  
It's an art just to give, will I learn?  
To visualize what you want from my life  
It's more than enough just to gaze in your eyes  
I'm dying to show you what love is about  
  
To tease you and please you  
We must work it out  
I know all your secrets so sad  
For all the changes we've been through
