Well I've been lost in this town  
Even though I know my way around  
Didn't take me long until I found the devil  
With just one word I knew his voice  
Is the one I heard in every choice I made  
Just trying to be a rebel  
In a small town, in a small town  
  
If you jumped off of our front porch  
You'd land right where the Civil War was fought  
And it's never been forgotten  
It's twenty miles to the interstate  
There's a Burger King and a Motel Eight  
And the only thing between here and there is cotton  
  
And Jeffrey prays to Jesus asking him please just help us through one more day  
Jenny gets high, she wastes her life, but me I just ran away  
From a small town, from a small town  
  
Sometimes it was heaven, sometimes hell  
Kinda like church, kinda like jail  
There's a water tower says 'Welcome to nowhere'  
As soon as I could I was long gone  
My jeans were torn and my hair was long  
Now I can't believe I wanna go back there  
To a small town, to a small town  
  
Jeffrey prays to Jesus asking him please just help us through one more day  
Jenny gets high, she wastes her life, but me I just ran away  
But I knew I'd come back some day  
To a small town, to a small town  
Oh to a small town, to a small town
