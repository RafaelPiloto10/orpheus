Didn't know 'till today  
That you would love for me to say  
All of the things I feel  
Though you don't doubt they're real  
  
Insecure, very shy  
Are the only reasons I have why  
I never say the things that  
You would love to hear  
All the words I try  
Disappoint me and I cry  
So they're words I don't often say  
  
But it's in my love, it's in my feeling  
It's in the very same heart  
That loved you from the start  
It's in my heat, it's in the spirit  
And it's got me totally high  
It's just hard me to say why  
  
Kind of sad, kind of blue  
Because I wanted to tell you  
That you are in my heart  
Though we are far apart  
Didn't know how to say  
All the little things to make you stay  
And not to keep assuming  
You could read my mind  
  
You're the one I love  
Though it's hard for you to know  
'Cause the words I don't always say  
  
But it's in my love, it's in my feeling  
It's in the very same heart  
That loved you from the start  
It's in the heat, it's in the spirit  
And it's got me totally high  
It's just hard me to say why  
  
It's hard for me
