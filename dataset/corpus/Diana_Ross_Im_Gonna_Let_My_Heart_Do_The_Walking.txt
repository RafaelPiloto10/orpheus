Goodbye my love, happy life, my love  
I'm tired and I just can't take no more  
Tired of being tough 'cause enough is enough  
This time I'm really headed for the door  
  
You better believe, I'm gonna let my heart do the walking  
Walk me into something good  
(So good, so good)  
I'm gonna let my heart do the walking  
(Do the walking)  
Oh, it ain't no make believing, my heart's set on leaving  
  
You take my very best and give me less  
I'm tired and I just can't take no more  
Your love is unstable and darling I'm unable  
Gonna ease on out the door  
  
You better believe, I'm gonna let my heart do the walking  
Walk me into something good  
(So good, so good)  
I'm gonna let my heart do the walking  
(Do the walking)  
Oh, I never thought I could but I'm leaving for good  
  
Gonna let it do the walking, baby  
(Do the walking)  
I'm gonna let it do the walking baby  
(Do the walking)  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
Walk on heart, walk on, walk on heart, tip on out the door  
Walk on heart, walk on, walk on heart, tip on out the door  
Walk on heart, walk on, walk on heart, walk on out the door  
With your bad self  
  
I'm gonna let my heart do the walking  
Walk me into something good  
(So good, so good)  
I'm gonna let my heart do the walking  
(Do the walking)  
I never thought I could but I'm leaving for good  
  
I'm gonna let it do the walking, baby  
(Do the walking)  
Walk me into something good  
(So good, so good)  
  
Let my heart do the walking
