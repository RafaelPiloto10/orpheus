Are we breathing out  
Or breathing in  
Are we leaving life  
Or moving in  
Exploding out  
Imploding in  
Ingrained in good  
Or stained in sin  
  
Are we breathing out  
Or breathing in  
Are we leaving life  
Or moving in  
Are we breathing out  
Or breathing in  
Are we breathing in  
  
We are a billion fragments  
Exploding outward  
Like broken glass, we damage  
Even in defeat  
We are tiny peices  
Falling now and settling  
Like snowflake crystal  
Building on the city street  
  
Snowflakes falling  
Snowflakes falling  
Snowflakes falling  
Snowflakes falling  
  
Are we the parts  
Are we the whole  
Are we the thoughts  
Are we the soul  
The parts of me  
And this is true  
The parts of me  
Belong to you  
  
Are we breathing out  
Or breathing in  
Are we leaving life  
Or moving in  
Exploding out  
Imploding in  
Ingrained in good  
Or stained in sin  
  
Are we the parts  
Are we the whole  
Are we the thoughts  
Are we the soul  
The parts of me  
And this is true  
The parts of me  
The parts of you  
Belong to you  
And you  
And you  
And you...
