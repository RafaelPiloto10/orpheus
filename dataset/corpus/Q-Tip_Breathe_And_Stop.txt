Get up  
Come on  
  
A hard time if your motion is still  
Let me move some things around because the lyrics is ill  
Abstract, you know my stiggidy in here (yeah)  
Niggaz get on and swear it's they fucking year  
But yo your girl just moved  
To the joint in the club, in the car if it groove  
Broad look, the movement is on  
Mild mannered mami's in Victoria thongs, uh  
I give my rhyme a bless  
Guaranteed to make it right if your night is a bust (yeah yeah)  
You Vivrant and you fresh and all  
Original to say the least and you've impressed Kamal (come on)  
Rappers start then they stall  
Finding it very hard to make it over the wall  
Hey, get your weight up, my motto you heard?  
And I grown a deaf ear to felonious words, uh  
So girls move it around  
If you see your main dog give a brother a pound  
And just  
  
Breathe and Stop, for real and give it what you got, and just  
Breathe and Stop, for real and give it what you got  
Give it what you got, give it what you got  
If you on the block then give it what you got  
  
A thug, a thrill, you as mean as the eyes (say word)  
I want to feel you, them big ass thighs  
Your Prada dress or your Gucci bag  
With the Polo jeans over doobi-bag, uh  
Yo hold the door alright?  
We coming through, Tribe beef, hold it down for the night  
Big Moon got the fifth  
D-Lyfe he got the deally and girl you got the gif (yeah for real love)  
Turn it over the page  
Ushering all of y'all to a brand new age, where (yeah)  
Status really don't matter  
Everybody get right to the pitter the patter (come on0  
Making moves, setting precedence  
Entering your residence, the whole scene is decadence  
And the feeling is true  
I'm seeing me and my crew, you seeing black and blue, uh (yeah)  
So let's go for the ride  
Strap yourself in tight and if you bonafied then just uh  
  
Breathe and Stop, for real and give it what you got, and just  
Breathe and Stop, for real and give it what you got  
Give it what you got, give it what you got  
If you on the block then give it what you got  
  
Dunn what what bring it, bring it  
A-bring it give it bring it give it  
Bring it give it bring it give it  
A-where we bring it to?  
Right here, right where? Right here, right where?  
Right here, right where? Right here, right where?  
Right here, right where? Right here, here here  
Right here, take it home home, take it home, right here  
  
Millennium, on your mind, are you running out of time?  
Hope you skipping every line because I'm getting mine  
Move it around a bit again  
Every block every town we starting a trend (for real for real)  
Eye to eye ma and toe to toe (toe to toe)  
Who concentrating on killing the show?  
Penetration is methodically slow  
Mountain high valley low gonna find the dough (yo for real for real)  
All my peoples, no matter the creed  
We gonna satisfy the urge and discover the need  
You feel, you feel the bite in this  
If you think I'm type real then invite me miss  
And let me say a rhyme in your ear  
Dancing close you the most and you fit in here (yeah)  
You feel the rhythm is right  
You know the spitting is tight  
You think you won't but I think you might, uh  
  
Breathe and Stop, for real and give it what you got, and just  
Breathe and Stop, for real and give it what you got  
Give it what you got, give it what you got  
If you on the block then give it what you got
