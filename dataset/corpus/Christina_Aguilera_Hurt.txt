Seems like it was yesterday when I saw your face  
You told me how proud you were, but I walked away  
If only I knew what I know today  
Ohhh ohhh  
  
I would hold you in my arms  
I would take the pain away  
Thank you for all you've done  
Forgive all your mistakes  
There's nothing I wouldn't do  
To hear your voice again  
Sometimes I want to call you, but I know you won't be there  
  
I'm sorry for blaming you for everything I just couldn't do  
And I've hurt myself by hurting you  
Some days I feel broke inside, but I won't admit  
Sometimes I just want to hide 'cause it's you I miss  
You know it's so hard to say goodbye when it comes to this  
  
Would you tell me I was wrong?  
Would you help me understand?  
Are you looking down upon me?  
Are you proud of who I am?  
There's nothing I wouldn't do  
To have just one more chance  
To look into your eyes and see you looking back  
  
I'm sorry for blaming you for everything I just couldn't do  
And I've hurt myself  
  
If I had just one more day, I would tell you how much that  
I've missed you since you've been away  
  
Oh, it's dangerous  
It's so out of line to try to turn back time  
  
I'm sorry for blaming you for everything I just couldn't do  
And I've hurt myself  
  
By hurting you
