I've got a smile  
That I put on  
When I'm not at home  
When I'm not alone  
  
But it is so hard  
To make that smile  
'Cause I know I'll be at home  
And alone in a while  
  
And if I look in a mirror  
I see my eyes start to tear  
I can't help but cry  
Since you said goodbye  
  
I've got to hide  
What I'm feelin' inside  
Can't let them see  
How you're hurtin' me  
  
So I guess that's what I'll do  
Won't let them see through  
Won't let them know  
That you could hurt me so  
  
I've got a laugh  
That I put on  
When I'm not at home  
When I'm not alone  
  
But it is so hard  
To fake that laugh  
When my insides are cryin'  
And my heart's torn in half  
  
And all the music I hear  
And things I valued so dear  
Make me feel so blue  
They all remind me of you  
  
(Now) What can I do  
(Now) That our love is through  
And my purpose is gone  
Still I got to live on  
  
I guess that's what I'll do  
I won't let them see through  
I won't let them know  
That you could hurt me so
