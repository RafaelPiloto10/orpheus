(M. Greaves)  
  
You're so near  
We could touch  
You're so sad  
You cry too much  
You're so warm  
To hold on to  
We don't do  
The things we want to  
  
We can fly to the moon  
So why can't I reach you?  
Oh, oh why can't I reach you?  
  
Future's bright  
For me alright  
I close my eyes  
You saw the light  
Here it's dark  
And I'm so blue  
Here it's cold  
Wanting you  
  
I love you  
Oh, I love you so  
God, give me  
Some control
