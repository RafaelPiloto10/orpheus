[Nicki Minaj - Chorus]  
Wave Ya Hand if you look good  
Throw some shade if you look good  
Wave Ya Hand if you look good  
Anyway but you look good  
Wave Ya Hand if you look good  
Those them shade, if you look good  
Wave Ya Hand if you look good  
Anyway but you look good  
  
[Verse:]  
I tell them bitches anyway  
'Cause we don't care what none of them galopies say  
You can't stop me, I'mma fulfil my prophecy  
I do it, I did it, the proper way  
I might pop-a-tay, now watch how we operate  
Bottles on ice, the bottles is on ice  
The vip light is hitting us just right  
So if you getting money just throw it up in the air  
Your hands in the air, like I was your puppeteer  
'Cause I, I, I, I'm am Zolanski  
Some call me Barbie yes I'm life size  
Yes I'm humble yes, but why lie  
I am the reason why these girls go bye bye  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Ok, now this right here can get me in trouble  
'Cause when I say I ball I don't mean in a huddle  
I'm always in a Lam, never do nothing subtle  
Cause it's Pink Friday hoe, that's there rebuttal  
My 2 guns up, lets blaze it, lets go  
I keep a lot of money up in the Escrow  
And when I'm at the game I'm in the best row  
I am the baddest bitch up in the pet store  
'Cause I, I, I am Onika  
And these shoes here me, Fashionista  
'Cause these don't come out til it's Easter  
I'm vip bound with Leighton Meester  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Nicki Minaj]  
Ya Ya Ya Ya Ya Ya  
Ya Ya Ya Ya Ya Ya  
Yahhh  
  
(Gibberish)  
  
Ya Ya Ya Ya Ya Ya Ya Ya Ya Ya Yahhh  
  
[Chorus:]
