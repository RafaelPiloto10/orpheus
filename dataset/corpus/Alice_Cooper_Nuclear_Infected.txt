I'm nuclear infected  
I really don't mind  
I just go out when the sun goes down  
And have a real good time  
  
I can clear out any ballgame  
In a minute and a half  
Just show up - glow up  
And have a real good laugh  
  
When I'm happy I glow yellow  
When I'm sad I glow blue  
And I glow red hot when I'm in bed with you  
  
I'm nuclear infected  
Really ain't that bad  
In fact it's about the best time  
I guess I ever had  
  
I'm nuclear infected  
Looking for a mate  
So slip on something lead, babe  
And go out on a date  
  
When I'm happy I glow yellow  
When I'm sad I glow blue, yeah  
And I glow red hot when I'm in bed with you  
  
Nuclear infected --- don't make me angry  
Nuclear infected --- don't make shake  
Nuclear infected --- don't get me to sneeze  
Nuclear infected --- that's a big mistake  
  
I want to live on Three Mile Island  
Where things are clean and neat  
'ause we don't have no health freaks  
Clutterin up our streets  
I'm nuclear infected, I need something to eat  
A China Syndrome Salad with plutonium and cheese  
  
When I'm happy I glow yellow  
When I'm sad I glow blue  
And I glow red hot when I'm in bed with you
