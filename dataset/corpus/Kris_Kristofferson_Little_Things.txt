[ Dolly Parton ]  
  
You never send me flowers or ever buy me candy  
You never bring me pretty things when you come to see me  
And you forgot my birthday oh I wish you could see  
How I miss the little things that you don't do for me  
  
You never say that I look nice or that you're proud of me  
You overlook the little things that you should see  
These little things are big enough to hurt but too small to make me want to
leave  
But I do miss the little things that you don't do for me  
  
Now how can I miss flowers that never reached my door  
How can I taste candy that's still at the candy store  
These little things mean a lot to me to you they may be silly  
But I do miss the little things that you don't do for me  
Yes I miss the little things that you don't do for me
