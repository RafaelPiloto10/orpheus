She was a good witch  
She was a bad witch  
But all I really wanted was a mother fuckin' sandwich  
A bandit left handed  
The woman drove me crazy  
But I couldn't understand it  
You could try to break me, take me  
But you'll never understand  
You could funnel, tunnel  
But you'll never truly comprehend  
That's what I say  
You could bleed me, feed me  
But you'll never truly be my friend  
You could move me, move me, move me  
But you'll never see the end  
That's what I say  
A fish over here, a fish over there  
Here a fish, there a fish  
Everywhere a mother fuckin'  
Fish over here, a fish over there
