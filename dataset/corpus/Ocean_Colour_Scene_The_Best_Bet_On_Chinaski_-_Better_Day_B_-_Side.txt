Henry took out all the wrong and never thought  
Do you know what he'd say, it's a beautiful day  
Henry took out all his money and found he had none  
Do you know what he'd say, it's a beautiful day  
  
And he would not buy the things that you were handing down  
And he would not clear it off for you and leave you lying down  
  
Henry found the love and he found it just today  
Do you know what he'd say, it's beautiful day  
Put my face in all the things that I've never done  
Do you know what he'd say, it's beautiful day  
  
And he would not follow things that others said or done  
And he would not follow things that you call everyone  
  
'cause henry found the note and he found it hard to give away  
Do you know what he'd say, it's a beautiful thing  
Bottled up a ticket to God knows where  
Do you know what he said to the driver, it's a beautiful day  
  
And he would not follow things that you were handing down  
And he would not buy the alternate news when the dogs were being drowned  
  
'cause henry found the love and he found it today  
Do you know what he'd say, it's a beautiful thing  
And you know what he knows, that it's a beautiful day  
And you know what he'd say, that it's a beautiful day  
  
'cause henry got it all and he found it just today  
Do you know what he'd say, it's a beautiful day...
