I fell by the wayside  
I fell on my knees  
Cryin' "why was I so hard to please"  
I stood at the crossroads  
Took a long look at me  
Sometimes you don't know where  
You're from 'til you leave  
  
[Chorus]  
And I've been out there searching  
For a place where I belong  
And on my way I heard my song  
Let it sing me home  
  
The sun on my shoulders  
And the wind at my back  
I'm bound and determined  
To get back on track  
  
To where the heart is  
Where it's been all along  
Sometimes you don't know what you've  
Got 'til it's gone  
Gone, gone, gone  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (3x)  
  
[Chorus]
