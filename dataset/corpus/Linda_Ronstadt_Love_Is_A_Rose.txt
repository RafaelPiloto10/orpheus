Love is a rose but you better not pick it  
Only grows when it's on the vine  
Handful of thorns and you'll know you've missed it  
Lose your love when you say the word mine  
  
I want to see what's never been seen  
I want to live that age-old dream  
Come on boy let's go together  
Let's take the best right now  
  
Love is a rose but you better not pick it  
Only grows when it's on the vine  
Handful of thorns and you'll know you've missed it  
Lose your love when you say the word mine  
  
I want to go to an old hoedown  
Long ago in a western town  
Pick me up 'cause my feet are dragging  
Give me a lift and I'll hay your wagon  
  
Love is a rose but you better not pick it  
Only grows when it's on the vine  
Handful of thorns and you'll know you've missed it  
Lose your love when you say the word mine  
  
Love is a rose but you better not pick it  
Only grows when it's on the vine  
Handful of thorns and you'll know you've missed it  
Lose your love when you say the word mine  
  
Mine  
  
Love is a rose  
Love is a rose  
Love is a rose  
Love is a rose  
  
Love is a rose  
Love is a rose  
Love is a rose  
Love is a rose  
Love is a rose  
Love is a rose  
Love is a rose  
Love is a rose  
Love is a rose  
Love is a rose
