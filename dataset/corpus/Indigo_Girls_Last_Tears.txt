These are the last tears I'm gonna cry for you.  
My cryin's through, I'm moving on.  
I don't regret and won't forget  
A single thing that we went through,  
But these are the last tears I'm gonna cry for you.  
You take things so much easier than I do  
And you could live your life without me if you had to  
And you believe that in the end it all works out right  
And I might if not for you  
And if you ask one which one lives just alone for love  
I do.  
These are the last tears I'm gonna cry for you  
My cryin's through, I'm moving on.  
I don't regret and won't forget  
A single thing that we went through  
But these are the last tears I'm gonna cry for you.  
There was a time when all signs pointed to the warm south  
The planets all lined up and built a new house  
And everything we talked about felt like a prophecy  
And when you looked at me they all came true  
And if you asked which one wants to go the distance  
I do.  
But these are the last tears I'm gonna cry for you.  
My cryin's through, I'm moving on.  
I don't regret and won't forget  
A single thing that we went through  
But these are the last tears I'm gonna cry for you.  
I'm gonna rack my mind one last time until I cannot think  
I'm gonna dip into your memory and take a good stiff drink  
And when I'm drunk on the last drop of sadness about how we went wrong  
I'm gonna play this song  
Make some coffee black and strong  
Give thanks for healing time  
Finally make up my mind  
These are the last tears I'm gonna cry for you.  
Baby my cryin's through, I'm moving on.  
I don't regret and won't forget  
A single thing that we went through,  
But these are the last tears I'm gonna cry for you  
These are the last tears?I?m gonna cry for you.
