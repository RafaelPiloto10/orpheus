I know you're going away  
I take my love into another day  
In my thoughts you're with me  
I fell in love with your ways  
  
I know you're going away  
Lead my heart into a daze  
I know you're going away  
Leaves a void in my heart and soul  
Wherever you are  
Whatever you do  
I feel the walls surrounding you  
  
Wherever you are  
Whatever you do  
I know you are independent  
But I'm trying to get through to you  
  
Wherever you are  
Whatever you do  
Don't you know, it depends on you
