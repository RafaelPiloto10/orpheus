Timbo  
Hey, Ne-Yo  
Say what? Lo-So  
Hey, hey  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm a movement by myself  
But I'm a force when we're together  
Mami, I'm good all by myself  
But, baby, you, you make me better  
(You make me better)  
You make me better  
(You make me better)  
You make me better  
(You make me better)  
You make me better  
(You make me better)  
You make me better  
  
[Fabolous]  
You plus me - it equal better math  
Ya boy a good look, but she my better half  
I'm already bossin', already flossin'  
But why I have the cake if it ain't got the sweet frostin'? (Yep, yep, yep,
yep)  
You're keepin' me on my A-game (what, what, what, what)  
Without havin' the same name (that, that, that, that, that)  
They may flame (but, but, but, but)  
But, shawty, we burn it up  
The sag in my swag, pep in my step  
Daddy do the Gucci, mami in Giuseppe's  
Guess it's a G thing, whenever we swing  
I'm a need Coretta Scott if I'm gonna be king  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Ne-Yo]  
First thing's first, I does what I do  
But everything I am, she's my improve  
I'm already boss, I'm already fly  
But if I'm a star, she is the sky (ah, ah, ah)  
And when I feel like I'm on top (she, she, she)  
She give me reason to not stop (eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)  
And though I'm hot (to, to, to)  
Together, we burn it up  
  
[Fabolous]  
The caked-up cut, the cleaned-up ice  
When shawty come around, I clean up nice  
Dynamic duo - Batman and Robin  
Whoever don't like it, it's that man problem (eh, eh, eh)  
And when I feel like I'm tired (ma, ma, ma)  
Mami be takin' me higher (ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)  
I'm on fire (but, but, but)  
But, shawty, we burn it up  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Inside every great man you can find a woman, like a soldier, holdin' him down  
  
[Fabolous]  
And she treats me like a Don, watches for the hit  
Checks where I go, even watches who I'm with  
The right when I'm wrong, so I never slip  
Show me how to move, that's why I never trip  
And, baby girl, you so major they should front-page ya (front-page ya)  
God bless the parents who made ya (who made ya)  
Middle-finger anybody who hate the  
Way that we burn it up  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Fabolous]  
Yeah, baby, them lames you playin' with  
They gon' put you down  
We tryin' to compliment you, you know?  
Make it better  
Top-notch Tim  
Nice-look Ne-Yo  
Livin' good Lo-So  
They ask you how you doin', now  
Tell 'em better than them  
  
[Chorus]
