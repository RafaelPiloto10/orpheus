No, I don't want no 'Jack n Coke'  
Please sit me where there ain't no smoke  
Don't want nothin' cloudin' up my eyes  
But you see that girl all over there  
Actin' like she's on thin air  
There got to be a secret to her smile  
Well, I think that I just found him  
And he's twirlin' her around  
I'd like to place my order  
You might want to write this down  
  
I'll have what she's havin'  
I want what she's got  
Someone sweet as he can be  
And by the way, that hot  
A tall order, I suppose  
But if you could find me one of those  
I'll have what she's havin'  
  
Well, I like the way he looks at her  
It's plain to see, he knows the words  
That makes her shine from 40 feet away  
If there's any justice in this world  
He's got a twin who wants a girl  
Who looks like me, excuse me while I pray  
So if you could slip my number  
In that pocket on his hip  
It would be appreciated  
And reflected in your tip  
  
I'll have what she's havin'  
I want what she's got  
Someone sweet as he can be  
And by the way, that hot  
A tall order, I suppose  
But if you can find me one of those  
I'll have what she's havin'  
  
A tall order, I suppose  
But if you can find me one of those  
I'll have what she's havin'  
  
Well, I know it's wrong to think of it  
But why should she have all of it  
I'll have what she's havin'  
  
Oh, I'll have what she's havin'
