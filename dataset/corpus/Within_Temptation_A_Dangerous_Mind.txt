I'm searching for answers  
'Cause something is not right.  
I follow the signs,  
I'm close to the fire.  
  
I fear that soon you'll reveal  
Your dangerous mind.  
  
[Chorus]  
It's in your eyes, what's on your mind.  
I fear your smile and the promise inside.  
It's in your eyes, what's on your mind.  
I fear your presence, I'm frozen inside.  
  
I'm searching for answers  
Not questioned before.  
The curse of awareness,  
There's no peace of mind.  
As your true colors show  
A dangerous sign.  
  
It's in your eyes, what's on your mind.  
I see the truth that you've buried inside.  
It's in your eyes, what's on your mind.  
There is no mercy just anger I find.  
  
I just have know, while I still have time.  
Do I have to run, or hide away from you?  
  
It's in your eyes, what's on your mind.  
I see the truth that you've buried inside.  
It's in your eyes, what's on your mind.  
There is no mercy just anger I find.
