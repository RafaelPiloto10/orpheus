Though men may strife to go  
Beyond the reap of space  
To walk beyond the distance shining stars  
This world's a room so small  
Within my master's house  
The open sky's but a portion of his yard  
How big is God how big and wide is his domain  
To try to tell these lips can only start  
He's big enough to rule the mighty universe  
Yet small enough to live within my heart  
  
As winter chill may cause the tiny seed to fall  
To lie asleep till wake by summer's rain  
The heart grown cold will warm  
And trod with life anew  
The Master's touch will bring the glow again  
How big is God
