Across the miles, it's funny to me  
How far you are but how near you seem to be  
I could talk all night just to hear you breath  
I could spend my life just living this dream  
You're all I'll ever need  
  
You give me strength  
You give me hope  
You give me someone to love, someone to hold  
When I'm in your arms, I need you to know  
I've never been, never been  
This close  
  
With all the loves I used to know  
I kept my distance, I never let go  
But in your arms I know I'm safe  
'Cause I've never been held and I've never been kissed  
in this way  
You're all I'll ever need, you're all I'll ever need  
  
You give me strength  
You give me hope  
You give me someone to love, someone to hold  
When I'm in your arms, I need you to know  
I've never been, never been  
This close  
  
Close enough to see it's true  
Close enough to trust in you  
Closer now than any words can say  
  
And when, when I'm in your arms, I need you to know  
I've never been, I've never been  
This close  
  
You give me strength  
You give me hope  
You give me someone to love, someone to hold  
When I'm in your arms, I need you to know  
I've never been, I've never been  
This close
