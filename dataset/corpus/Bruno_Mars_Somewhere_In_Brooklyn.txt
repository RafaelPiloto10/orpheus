She was covered in leather and gold  
Twenty one years old  
I lost her in the cold  
It's unfair, she's out there  
  
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn  
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn  
  
Little miss perfect sitting at the train stop  
Red Nike high tops listening to hip-hop  
While we were waiting started conversating  
Before I got her name along came a train  
  
(uh) next stop Brooklyn  
(uh) now I'm lookin'  
  
She was covered in leather and gold  
Twenty one years old  
I lost her in the cold  
It's unfair, she's out there  
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn  
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn  
  
On the street kickin' rocks circling the same block  
Green farm flat bush checking every corner shop  
Tappin' people's shoulders askin' if they know her  
Everyday's the same back to the train  
  
(uh) next stop Brooklyn  
(uh) I'm still lookin'  
  
She was covered in leather and gold  
Twenty one years old  
I lost her in the cold  
It's unfair, she's out there  
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn  
She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn  
  
Oh-oh-oh-oh  
I wonder if we'll ever meet again  
Oh-oh-oh-oh  
I wonder we we'll ever meet again  
Yeah I wonder if we'll meet again  
I hope we do somewhere in Brooklyn
