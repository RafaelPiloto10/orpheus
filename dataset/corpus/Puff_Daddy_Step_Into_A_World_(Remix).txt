Verse One: Puff Daddy, krs-One  
  
Hear the sound of my money machine  
See the 600 Benz see the chrome rims gleam  
See the teacher krs and the Puff Daddy  
See the young black and famous Rich like Matty

With a style make the ladies wanna lick they lips, shake they hips  
Shake they rumps, bass thump  
Believin they could fly by the way you jump, player, uhh  
Hip-Hop mayor, fat rhyme sayer  
From the Boogie Down to the Himilayas I'm  
  
Comentating (say what?) illustrating (yeah)  
Descriptions given, adjective expert (I hear you)  
Let's work, til your neck hurt (oooh)  
Like Bedwork I Rock Steady, you ain't really ready  
For the teacher, just when you thought you had me licked  
I come equipped with another hit, oh shit!  
(I hear you, I hear you, I hear you, I hear you)  
  
Chorus:  
  
And we won't stop, cause we can't stop (repeat 4X)  
Step into a world, where there's no one left  
But the very best, no mc can test  
  
Step into a world, where there's no one left  
But the very best, no mc can test

Young black and educated, that's how we made it (oh yeah)  
Study and bring the money in, you can't fade it  
This scholar, gets the dollars  
While these other scholars just holler (remix)  
With no dinero, your zero (remix)  
You think I care what you whisper  
You got the wrong picture (remix)  
I'm chillin with G. Simone eatin dinner (haha)  
The 1997 winner, of your respect  
High tech, you get the album or cassette (that's right)  
And don't forget, while you listenin, skills I flaunt it  
That Boogie Down Bronx shit, we on it  
  
[Puffy]  
Scott Larock rest in peace, Biggie Smalls rest in peace  
Step into a world  
We love y'all, always and forever, and we won't stop  
Where there's no one left  
Cause we can't stop, and we won't stop  
Where the very best  
Bdp, Bad Boy  
No mc can test  
  
Cause we can't stop, and we won't stop (repeat 4X)
