My way was the hard way  
Didn't know it at the time  
I could've made it by now  
But I 'as too busy trying  
Your way was too easy  
Thank God you came along  
You took me to a special place  
Where nothing can go wrong  
  
Easy, on easy street  
You're the one who gave me love  
That made my love complete  
Easy, on easy street  
The dream I pictured in my mind  
Could never be this sweet  
Everything I'll ever need  
Is here with you on easy street  
  
I know you're up to something  
What's on your little heart  
It really doesn't matter, 'cause  
I know I'll love my part  
  
Easy, on easy street  
You're the one who gave me love  
That made my love complete  
Easy, on easy street  
The dream I pictured in my mind  
Could never be this sweet  
Everything I'll ever need  
Is here with you on easy street  
  
Is here with you on easy street  
The dream I pictured in my mind  
Could never be this sweet  
Everything I'll ever need  
Is here with you on easy street
