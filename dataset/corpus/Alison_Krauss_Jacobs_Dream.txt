In the spring of 1856, with the snow still on the ground  
Two little boys were lost in the mountains above the town  
The father went out hunting, the boys had stayed behind  
While mother tended to her chores, they wandered from her side  
  
The two had gone to follow him and lost their way instead  
By dusk the boys had not been found and fear had turned to dread  
Two hundred men had gathered there to comb the mountainside  
The fires were built on the highest peak in hopes they'd see the light  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh mommy and daddy, why can't you hear our cries?  
The day is almost over, soon it will be night  
We're so cold and hungry, and our feet are tired and sore  
We promise not to stray again from our cabin door  
  
Now Jacob Diverd woke one night from a strange and eerie dream  
He saw a path between two hills near a dark and swollen stream  
He told his wife he saw the boys huddled close beside a log  
For two more nights the dream returned this vision sent from God  
  
[Chorus]  
  
A thousand men had searched in vain the west side of pop's creek  
But Jacob's wife knew of this place and said to travel east  
With a guide to take him there Jacob came upon the scene  
And found the boys cold and still beneath the old birch tree  
  
Oh mommy and daddy, look past the tears you cry  
We're both up in Heaven now, God is by our side  
As you lay us down to rest in the presence of the Lord  
Know that we will meet you here at Heaven's door  
  
Oh mommy and daddy, look past the tears you cry  
We're both up in Heaven now, God is by our side  
And as you lay us down to rest in the presence of the Lord  
Know that we will meet you here at Heaven's door
