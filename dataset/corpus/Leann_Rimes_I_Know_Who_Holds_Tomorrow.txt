I don't know about tomorrow,  
I just live from day to day.  
And I don't borrow from the sunshine  
'Cause the skies might turn to gray.  
  
And I don't worry about the future,  
'Cause I know what Jesus said,  
And today I'm gonna walk right beside him  
'Cause he's the one who knows what is ahead.  
  
There are things about tomorrow  
That I don't seem to understand  
But I know who holds tomorrow  
And I know who holds my hand.  
  
And each step is getting brighter  
As the golden stairs I climb.  
And every burden is getting lighter  
And all the clouds, they're silver lined.  
  
And, I'll bet the sun it's always shining  
There no tears will ever dim the eye  
And the ending of the rainbow  
Where the mountains, they touch the sky.  
  
There are many things about tomorrow  
I don't seem to understand  
But I know who holds tomorrow  
And I know who holds my hand.
