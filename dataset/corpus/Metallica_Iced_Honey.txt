You can't put a butterfly in a jar  
If the effort's too high no matter who you are  
You can't catch the moon, or the sun or the stars  
It doesn't matter who you are  
Iced honey, iced honey  
  
Now me I've tried a million tricks  
To make life cold and make it stick  
Not running heat that flames then out  
But the proud piece of ice that always floats  
Iced honey, iced honey  
  
If I can't trap a butterfly or a bee  
If I can't keep my heart where I want it to be  
If no matter how much soul and heart  
I put to the wood  
If a flaming heart is not that good  
Iced honey, iced honey  
  
If you can't put a butterfly in a jar  
If violence mars your final hour  
If you make others feel like jam  
Poured on a piece of charbroiled lamb  
  
If it's all mixed up and you cannot shout  
And your oxygen starts to run out  
If your final gasp has the recipe wrong  
And instead of hello you say so long  
If your energy starts to leak out  
And people wonder what you're all about  
A heartbreaker with an unattached heart  
The story of love gives them all a start  
  
And me, I've always been this way  
Not by choice, just this way  
I can't put my honey pot in a jar  
Or a heart or a fist of some young boy  
  
If you can't put a butterfly in a jar  
No wonder no need to wonder where you are  
It might seem like hell, the River Styx  
Your affection never sticks  
  
No matter what you say, no matter what you do  
A butterfly heart flies right past you  
There's nothing to say, nothing to do  
See if the ice will melt for you  
See if the ice will melt for you  
See if the ice will melt for you  
See if the ice will melt for you  
See if the ice will melt for you  
Iced honey, ah ah ah iced honey  
Iced honey, iced honey  
See if the ice will melt for you  
See if the ice will melt for you  
See if the ice will melt for you  
See if the ice will melt for you  
Iced honey, iced honey  
Oh iced honey  
See if the  
See if the ice will melt for you  
Iced honey  
Iced honey
