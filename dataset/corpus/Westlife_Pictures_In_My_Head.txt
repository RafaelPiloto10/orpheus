Thank you for tomorrow  
When you gonna call me (call me)  
Thank you for the weekend  
When you gonna see me (see me)  
Thank you for the memories  
We haven't made yet  
You've always been a part of me  
Even before we met (we met)  
Yeah  
  
Thank you in advance for the love you give me  
I've had a glance of the good life (good life)  
You'll be there when nobody believes me  
I've gone through it all in my mind  
  
[Chorus]  
I can see me looking at you  
At the start of the day for all my life  
I can see me dying to hold you  
On the way when  
I'm driving home at night  
  
I've got these pictures in my head  
These pictures in my head, yeah  
I've got these pictures in my head  
These pictures in my head  
  
Thank you for tomorrow  
When you gonna call me (call me)  
Thank you for the weekend  
When you gonna see me (see me)  
Thank you in advance  
For the time you'll notice  
I'm all you've wanted all of your life  
Thank you for every single moment  
I've gone through it all in my mind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've got these pictures in my head  
These pictures in my head, yeah  
I've got these pictures in my head  
These pictures in my head  
Pictures in my head  
  
Thank you for the best times  
Thank you for the journey  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I've got these pictures in my head  
These pictures in my head, yeah  
Pictures in my head, yeah
