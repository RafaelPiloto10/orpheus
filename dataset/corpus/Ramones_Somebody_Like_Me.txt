Tired of naggin' nothin's ever happenin'  
That's the attitude that isn't fun  
A bottle of wine, a tube of glue  
I don't know what to do  
  
I am just a guy who likes to rock and roll  
I am just a guy who likes to get drunk  
I am just a guy who likes to dress punk  
Get my kicks an' live up my life  
  
Tired of complaints I am ready for fun  
But I'll make friends with anyone  
Are you out there somebody like me  
If you are, I hope that you can see  
  
I am just a guy who likes to rock and roll  
I am just a guy who likes to get drunk  
I am just a guy who likes to dress punk  
Get my kicks an' live up my life  
  
Don't go to school don't make me laugh  
Can't hardly spell, can't do math  
In the bar or out on the street  
At the concert at the boutique
