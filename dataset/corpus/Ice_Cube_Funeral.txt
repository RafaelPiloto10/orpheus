Niggaz are in a state of emergency  
The death side, mirror damage of where we are today  
The life side a vision of where we need to go  
So sign your death certificate  
Fuck all, y'all  
Lisa got him  
Alright, on three, one, two, three  
Get all folks together, walk this way  
Can't believe it though  
The homeboy, hey, open that door  
Open it, alright 'right  
We've come together by God's demand  
Whether it be for life or death  
Well, this morning, it's over the mourning  
Of one of our little brothers  
This brother was a good brother  
He didn't get into an excessive amount of trouble  
But it's one thing, it's one thing, it's one thing  
He was the wrong nigga to fuck with
