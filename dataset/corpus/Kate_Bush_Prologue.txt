We're gonna be laughing about this  
We're gonna be dancing around  
It's gonna be so good now  
It's gonna be so good  
  
Oh so exciting, go on and on  
Every time you leave us  
So summer will be gone  
So you'll never grow old to us  
  
It's gonna be so good now  
It's gonna be so good  
Can you see the lark ascending?  
  
Oh so romantic, swept me off my feet  
Like some kind of magic  
Like the light in Italy  
Lost its way across the sea  
  
Roma Roma mia  
Tesoro mio, bella  
Pieno di sole luce  
Bali cozi bene, bene  
Pianissimo  
Pianissimo  
  
What a lovely afternoon  
What a lovely afternoon  
Oh will you come with us  
To find the song of the oil and brush
