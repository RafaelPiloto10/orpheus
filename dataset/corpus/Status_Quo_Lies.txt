I had another drink after another drink and then I tried to crawl to the door  
I had another smoke after another joke and then I couldn't take any more  
It didn't change a thing, not any single thing, when someone tried to tell me
for sure  
I heard another voice that said I wasn't in a dream  
I read a word or two about everything  
I never knew the way that it oughta have been  
They never told me a thing about it  
I never did know a thing about it  
And the lies in the eyes of a thousand eyes they won't go away  
And the times that I tried are the times that I find they don't show today  
But you make me feel so good  
  
I woke up after four, still lying on the floor, and waiting to be carried away  
I woke up once again, a little after ten, will things be any better today  
It doesn't change you see, it only changes me, well someone tried to tell me
I'm sure  
I'm gonna hear a voice and know it isn't in a dream  
I'm gonna read the lines and get a look between  
I never knew the way that it oughta have been  
They never told me a thing about it  
I never did know a thing about it  
And the lies in the eyes of a thousand eyes, they won't go away  
And the times that I tried, are the times that I find they don't show today  
But you make me feel so good  
  
I'm going back to school, I'm gonna check the rule, and see if I get carried
away  
I'm going back again, I'm gonna try again, don't listen what the people might
say  
It doesn't change a thing, not any single thing, well someone tried to tell me
for sure  
I'm gonna hear a voice and know it isn't in a dream  
I'm gonna read the lines and get a look between  
I never knew the way that it oughta have been  
They never told me a thing about it  
I never did know a thing about it  
And the lies in the eyes of a thousand eyes, they won't go away  
And the times that I tried, are the times that I find they don't show today  
And the lies in the eyes of a thousand eyes, they won't go away  
And the times that I tried, are the times that I find they don't show today  
And the lies in the eyes of a thousand eyes, they won't go away  
And the times that I tried, are the times that I find they don't show today  
And the lies in the eyes of a thousand eyes, they won't go away  
And the lies in the eyes of a thousand eyes, they won't go away
