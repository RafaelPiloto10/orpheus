She's screaming into his collar  
Beating him on the chest  
He's showing her no emotion  
Their love's put to the test  
He thinks that he makes her happy  
By simply being there  
As the silences get longer  
The more she pulls her hair  
Love can be damaged by silence  
Tied to a ball and chain  
Love can be driven to violence  
From what once seemed so tame  
Wearing his dinner this evening  
Jolly comes home again  
  
The mule's sitting by the fire  
The house at his control  
He hops around the channels  
His eyes on film patrol  
She's driven from her senses  
Her mundane life erupts  
She leaps out of the sofa  
And jumps upon her lump  
  
The room was all dark and quiet  
In bed there side by side  
There in the small of her back  
An olive branch tonight  
He wants to say that he's sorry  
She wants to make him beg  
For all the pain that she's suffered  
In her heart and in her head
