I got to Kansas City on a Firday  
By Saturday I learned a thing or two  
Cuz up to then I didn't have an idy  
Of whut the modern world was comin' to!  
  
I counted twenty gas buggies goin' by their sels  
Almost every time I took a walk  
Then I put my ear to a bell telephone  
And a strange woman started in to talk  
  
To you?  
  
What next?  
  
Yeah what?  
  
What next?  
Gather round!  
  
Everythin's up to date in Kansas City  
They've gone about as fur as they can go  
They went and built a skyscraper seven stories high  
About as high as a buildin' oughta grow  
Everythin's like a dream in Kansas City  
It's better than a magic lantren show  
You can turn the radiator on  
Whenever you want some heat  
With every kind of comfort  
Every house is all complete  
You can walk to privies in the rain  
And never wet your feet!  
They've gone about as fur as they can go  
  
Yes sir!  
They've gone about as fur as they can go  
  
Everythin's up to date in Kansas City  
They've gone about as fur as they can go  
They've got a big theyater they call a burleeque  
For fifty cents you can see a dandy show  
  
Gals?  
  
One of the gals was fat and pink and pretty  
As round above as she was round below  
I could swear that she was padded  
From her shoulder to her heel  
But latter in the second act  
When she began to peel  
She proved that everyhin' she had was absolutely real!  
She went about as fur as she can go  
  
Yes sir!  
She went about as fur as she can go!
