One look at you  
And just look at me  
Held under your spell  
So helplessly  
Yes I'm still your fool  
Any fool can see  
One look at you  
And just look at me  
  
I thought I'd be over you by now  
But I guess it's too soon  
The truth was so plain to see  
Tonight when you walked in the room  
I just couldn't control the tears  
When I saw you again  
My love is still as strong for you  
As it's ever been  
  
One look at you  
And just look at me  
Held under your spell  
So helplessly  
Yes I'm still your fool  
Any fool can see  
One look at you  
And just look at me  
  
I'm still your fool  
Guess I'll always be  
One look at you  
And just look at me
