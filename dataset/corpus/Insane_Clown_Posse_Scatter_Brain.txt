Panic) Oooo (um)  
Fucking Concentrate. (scatterbrain) Unorganized Cluster Fuck. [laughing] You
Need To Think  
About What The Fuck You're Doing (noises In The Background) I'm Working On
Something.  
Miscellaneous (i'm Not Quite All There) If You Just Put Some Effort (scary Not
A Nice Guy) If  
You Cared (i'm Trying To Fucking Concentrate) What The Fuck Is Wrong With You  
([mumbling:] And Of Course... The Circus)  
  
Where My Swim Suit At  
The Soups On In Argentina  
Convalescent Home Patients Serving Me With Subpoenas  
Make Sure You Tell The Fuckin' Captain His Legs Are Made Of Rubber  
I Got An Apple For Your Forehead If I'm Cleaning The Shutters  
Give Me My Turkey Pass  
Tradin' Chops Sticks With The Hooligans  
Snakes Are In A Submarine  
I'll Never Go To School Again  
I Stole You A Porsche 'cause Your Mama's A Fox  
I'm Selling Footwear Insoles And I'm Running Three Shops  
Horrified Jelly Worms With Electric Infantago  
Dinosaur Crybabies Cookin' Shrimp In San Diageo  
Full Moons Mean Nothing Without Your Roller Skates  
When The Water Runs Dry And Blood Fills The Great Lakes  
I'm A Hired Assassin But Ice Sculpture Is Art  
And So I Ride A Horse Everywhere Returning Shopping Carts  
It's Raining Fish Flies On The East Side And I'm Rappin'  
Slutty Ass Skanks Get Slapped For Nappin' (umph)  
  
I Don't Wanna Know About The Shit That Matters  
Skip-switch Forget Shit I Scatter My Brain (i Scatter My Brain) [2x]  
  
Throw Your Hands Up  
Kamikazes Don't Tell Lies  
With That Watermelon Foot Bath They Minds Collide  
Bitch, My Knees Been Bald Headed So Download That  
Ridin' On A Zamboni In My Danny Kaye Hat  
I'm The Number One Contender For A Shot At The Bible Belt  
I Swam Between Piranhas And Assaulted A Patty Melt  
The Red Planet Still Remains In Orbit  
Leavin' Trash Piles Cleaned Up By A.j. Styles, Me, And J. Giles  
Leopard Shit In My Yard  
I Took The Yellow Pill  
I Once Stabbed A Flamingo But It Was Only A Fire Drill  
Meet Me At The Market For Your Kung Fu Prize  
With That Frozen Ice Firecracker (everybody Rise)  
Get Your Panties Off Ho This Ship Is Ready To Attack  
Somebody Get On The Piano I'm Calling John Cusack  
And Put Ten On Pump Seven If Your Skills Are Tight  
Make Sure You Bring A Wet Mitten 'cause Its Col Col Col Cold At Night  
  
I Don't Wanna Know About The Shit That Matters  
Skip-switch Forget Shit I Scatter My Brain (i Scatter My Brain) [4x]  
  
[laughter]  
  
I Scatter My Brain  
  
I I I Scatter My Brain  
  
I Don't Wanna Know About The Shit That Matters  
  
I I I Scatter My Brain  
  
I Don't Wanna Know About The Shit That Matters  
  
My Brain  
  
I Scatter My Brain (i Scatter My Brain)  
  
I Don't Wanna Know About The Shit That Matters  
Skip-switch Forget Shit I Scatter My Brain (i Scatter My Brain) [2x]
