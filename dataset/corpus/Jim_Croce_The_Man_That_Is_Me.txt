I'm a dreamer by nature  
And I've always been tryin'  
To dream myself out of this world that I'm in  
In my dreams I escape all the troubles around  
And it hasn't cost a penny  
For the pleasures I've found  
  
What is the part  
That I'll play today  
Beggar, a business man, king for a day?  
I've played many parts  
And I'm the first to agree  
That I'm still lookin' round for the man that is me  
  
I'm a dreamer by nature  
And I've always been  
Looking for something not there  
My financial position  
Don't bother my dreams  
'Cause in fairy tale money  
I'm my own millionaire  
  
What is the part  
That I'll play today  
Beggar, a business man, king for a day?  
I've played many parts  
And I'm the first to agree  
That I'm still lookin' round for the man that is me  
  
I'm a rich man in dreams  
But in real life I've hid  
From the fact that I've got me a wife and a kid  
If I lose what I've got  
Then they lose it too  
Tell me what in this world's a poor dreamer to do  
  
What is the part  
That I'll play today  
Beggar, a bus'ness man, king for a day?  
I've played many parts  
And I'm the first to agree  
That I'm still lookin' round for the man that is me
