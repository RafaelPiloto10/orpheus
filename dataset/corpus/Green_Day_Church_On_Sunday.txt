Today is the first day of the rest of our lives  
Tomorrow is too late to pretend  
Everything's all right  
I'm not getting any younger as long as you don't get any older  
I'm not going to state that yesterday never was  
  
Bloodshot deadbeat and lack of sleep  
Making your mascara bleed  
Tears down your face  
Leaving traces of mistakes  
  
If I promise to go to church on Sunday  
Will you go with me on Friday night?  
If you live with me, I'll die for you  
And this compromise  
  
I hereby solemnly swear to tell the whole truth  
And nothing but the truth is what I'll ever hear from you  
"Trust" is a dirty word that comes only from such a liar  
But "respect" is something I will earn...  
If you have faith
