Can't you see, this is me  
Can't you see, this is me  
  
Don't walk crowded streets  
Choose every dream from a magazine stand  
I don't buy into that  
All-day TV shows  
Sell their souls just to make living easy  
I don't buy into that  
I don't need satin and lace, no no no  
I'll bring a smile to your face  
  
I'll never be a fire but I will be the flame  
I'll never be a diamond but I'll never be fake, no  
I've never been a winner but I still play the game  
Can't you see that this is me  
I'm all the woman that I want to be  
  
Can't you see, this is me (a woman)  
Can't you see, this is me  
  
Good times can't get enough  
Life can be tough but it's all for a reason  
I sure buy into that  
Life goes around and around  
We seek what we found 'cause it's all an illusion  
I sure buy into that  
I know the waters of fate, yeah, yeah  
Will keep on flowing my way  
  
I'll never be a fire but I will be the flame  
I'll never be a diamond but I'll never be fake, no no  
I've never been a winner but I still play the game  
Baby can't you see that this is me  
I'm all the woman that I want  
  
I've never been affraid of myself  
I don't buy into that, I don't buy into that  
I don't want to be nobody else  
I don't buy into that, I don't buy into that, I don't buy into that  
  
I'll never be a fire but I will be the flame (be the flame)  
I'll never be a diamond but I'll never be fake (oh no no no)  
I've never been a winner but I still play the game  
Baby baby can't you see that this is me  
I'm all the woman that I want (all I want to be)  
I'll never be a fire but I will be the flame (be the flame)  
I'll never be a diamond but I'll never be fake (oh no no no)  
I've never been a winner but I still play the game  
Can't you see this is me  
And I'm all the woman that I want to be
