I can feel the turning of the tides  
Pulling away the night  
Like a sheet from over me  
In summer time  
I dissolve to a beach  
And everywhere seems to be  
Just a flicker on a silent screen  
Because I  
I can't stay long  
Let the sky roll on  
Just a flicker and the crowd moves on  
In winter  
Overcoats close in  
And the snow tastes of tin  
On the steps of any station  
I'd like to glide in the long green light  
Of a July afternoon  
Sliding down a vague conversation  
Because I  
I can't stay long  
When the moment comes  
Just a glance and the glance is gone  
Watch closely  
As a man with a hat  
And a girl with a map  
Synchronise with the track  
And they go away  
I need to drift through all the walls  
And let the scenery dissolve  
Into some other life  
Because I  
I can't stay long  
Let the sky roll on  
Just a glance and the glance is gone  
I  
I can't stay long  
When the right time comes  
I'll dissolve
