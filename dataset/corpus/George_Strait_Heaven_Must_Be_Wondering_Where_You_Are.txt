Some where up there beyond the blue  
Surely by now somebody's missin' you  
I found the angel they must be lookin' for  
Heaven must be wondering where you are  
  
When I look into your eye's  
It's so plain to see  
Nothin' here on earth describes what you mean to me  
Out of this world when I hold you in my arms  
Heaven must be wondering where you are  
  
Lucky me to be the one to find  
Someone like you this side of paradise  
I know how lost I'd be without here sweetheart  
Heaven must be wondering where you are  
  
Some where up there beyond the blue  
Surely by now somebody's missin' you  
I found the angel they must be lookin' for  
Heaven must be wondering where you are  
  
I found the angel they must be lookin' for  
Heaven must be wondering where you are
