There's a fog upon L.A.  
And my friends have lost their way  
We'll be over soon they said  
Now they've lost themselves instead.  
  
Please don't be long  
Please don't you be very long  
Please don't be long  
For I may be asleep.  
  
Now it only goes to show  
And I told them where to go  
Ask a policeman on the street  
There's so many there to meet.  
  
Please don't be long  
Please don't you be very long  
Please don't be long  
For I may be asleep.  
  
Now it's past my bed I know  
And I'd really like to go  
Soon will be the breath of day  
Sitting here in Blue Jay Way.  
  
Please don't be long  
Please don't you be very long  
Please don't be long  
For I may be asleep  
  
Please don't be long  
Please don't you be very long  
Please don't be long  
  
Please don't be long  
Please don't you be very long  
Please don't be long  
  
Please don't be long  
Please don't you be very long  
Please don't be long  
  
Don't be long, don't be long, don't be long  
Don't be long, don't be long, don't be long
