We poison our hearts  
We poison our seas  
We burn down the paradise  
  
We're stoppin' good waves  
We're losin' our trees  
The future looks bright ahead  
I don't wonder we'll go under in this river of lies  
  
We're lost in this time--we create so fine  
The future we already fear  
Seems like no way out, seems like there's no doubt  
The future looks bright ahead  
  
We're the kids of the century--we're lost in our games  
No time for the memories we look in the haze  
We're the kids of the century it wasn't our fault  
Everything's done mum, we fall  
Let's keep on crying  
But sometimes I don't want to fall  
  
Everytime when you look around things will smile at you  
Everytime when you turn around you smell the truth  
But you run away from the lies you can't say  
Don't run away from the lies you can't say  
  
We're the kids
