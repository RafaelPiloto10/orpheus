Here it is  
One more glass for these broken hands  
Goes down for you  
I'm falling in  
I sink then swallow  
I never meant  
To see this through  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm taking them all  
Taking them all back for good  
To a place where I know that I'm safe  
Then I can fall  
Then I could fall where I should  
In this bottle with all my mistakes  
  
All the days  
Since I've landed  
I've lost the way  
To find my truth  
You float away  
And leave me stranded  
What's left to say  
I'll hurt for you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I could sleep  
But when I wake here  
You'll still be gone  
And you're my air  
I could breathe  
If you would stay here  
Another song  
So I could stare  
  
I could sleep  
But when I wake here  
You'll still be gone  
And you're my air  
I could breathe  
If you would stay here  
Another song  
So I could stare  
  
[Chorus]
