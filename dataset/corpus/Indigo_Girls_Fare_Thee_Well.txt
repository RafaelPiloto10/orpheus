Fare thee well my bright star  
I watched your taillights blaze into nothingness  
But you were long gone before I ever got to you  
Before you blazed past this address  
  
And now I think of having loved and having lost  
But never know what it feels like to never love  
Who can say what's better when my heart's become the cost  
A mere token of a brighter jewel sent from above  
  
Fare thee well my bright star  
The vanity of youth the color of your eyes  
And maybe if I'd fanned the blazing fire of your day-to-day  
Or if I'd been older I'd been wise  
  
Too thick the heat of those long summer evenings  
For a cool evening I began to yearn  
But you could only feed upon the things which feed a fire  
Waiting to see if I would burn  
  
Fare thee well my bright star  
It was a brief brilliant miracle dive  
That which I looked up to and I clung to for dear life  
Had to burn itself up just to make itself alive  
  
And I caught you then in your moment of glory  
Your last dramatic scene against a night sky stage  
With a moment so clear that it's as if you're still before me  
My once in a lifetime star of an age  
  
So fare thee well my bright star  
Last night the tongues of fire circled me around  
And this strange season of pain will come to pass  
When the healing hands of autumn cool me down
