[Verse 1]  
What can I give  
What can I bring  
That would be pleasing to my King  
I'll give my heart not just a part  
I'm lifting up my everything  
Well it's all I have to offer  
And it's all I have to give  
  
[Chorus]  
Two hands one heart  
One life to offer You  
Two hands one heart  
That's what I give to You  
  
[Verse 2]  
Use me today I know You can  
Lord I surrender to Your plan  
You made this heart  
You made these hands  
Take me and use me as I am  
Well it's all I have to offer  
And it's all I have to give  
  
[Chorus]  
Two hands one heart  
One life to offer You  
Two hands one heart  
That's what I give to You  
  
[Bridge]  
Little becomes a lot  
When it's in Your hands  
Take me and make me more like You  
Well it may not seem like much  
But with the Master's touch  
I know that I'll be more like You  
  
[Chorus]  
Two hands one heart  
One life to offer You  
Two hands one heart  
That's what I give to You  
  
[Chorus]  
Two hands one heart  
One life to offer You  
Two hands one heart  
That's what I give to You  
  
[Outro]  
That's what I give to You
