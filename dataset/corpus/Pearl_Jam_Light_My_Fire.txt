You know that I won't be untrue  
You know that I won't be a liar  
If I were to say to you, girl we couldn't get much higher  
Come on, baby, light my fire [Repeat x2]  
Try to set the night on fire  
The time to hesitate is through  
No time to wallow in the mire  
Try now, we could only lose  
And our love become a funeral pyre  
Come on, baby, light my fire [Repeat x2]  
Try to set the night on fire  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah [Repeat x4]  
Yeah  
The time to hesitate is through  
No time to wallow in the mire  
Try now we could only lose  
And our love become a funeral parlor  
Come on, baby, light my fire [Repeat x2]  
Try to set the night on fire, yeah  
You know that I would be untrue  
You know that I would be a liar  
If I were to say to you, girl we couldn't get much higher, yeah  
Come on, baby, light my fire [Repeat x2]  
Try to set the night on fire [Repeat x4]
