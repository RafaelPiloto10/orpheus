We've spent a long time side by side  
Guess I've loved your forever  
Sometimes we laughed, sometimes we cried  
Still we made it together  
I don't know what I'd do without you  
Girl you make me smile  
You know I can't stop thinkin' about you  
Oh you drive me wild  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby our love is still comin' on strong  
You give me strength that I needed so long  
I can't explain how I feel in my heart  
But the love we got goin' will never fall apart  
  
Now here you are still in my arms  
After so many years have gone  
It seems we both were meant to be  
Now that all of the tears have gone  
And when it's time to settle down  
And get ourselves a home  
I'll be beside you all the way  
Never again will you be alone  
  
[Chorus]
