'Neath the stars, at bazaars  
Often I've had to caress men  
Five or ten, dollars then, I'd collect from all those yes-men  
Don't be sad, I must add, that they meant no more than chess-men  
  
Darling, can't you see?  
'Twas for charity?  
Though these lips have made slips, it was never really serious  
Who'd have thought, I'd be brought to a state that's so delirious?  
  
I could cry salty tears  
Where have I been all these years?  
Little wow, tell me now  
How long has this been goin' on?  
  
There were chills up my spine  
And some thrills I can't define  
Listen sweet, I repeat  
How long has this been goin' on?  
  
Oh, I feel that I could melt  
Into heaven I'm hurled  
I know how columbus felt  
Finding another world  
  
Kiss me once, then once more  
What a dunce I was before  
What a break, for heaven's sake  
How long has this been goin' on?  
  
Kiss me twice, once more, thrice, make it four  
  
What a break, for heaven's sake  
How long has this been goin' on?
