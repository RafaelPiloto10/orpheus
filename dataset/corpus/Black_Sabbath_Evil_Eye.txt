Something about the way that you look on me,  
You watch every move, every word, every fantasy,  
Got no time for love, there's something on your mind,  
Got the face of an angel but the stare of a devil inside.  
  
Got hell looking up, heaven looking down,  
People say the woman's got an evil eye.  
Got hell looking up, heaven looking down,  
Free me from the woman with the evil eye.  
  
I turn away but still I see that evil stare,  
Trapped inside my dreams I know you're there.  
Thoughts of happiness you destroyed them all,  
First inside my head, then inside my soul.  
  
Got hell looking up, heaven looking down,  
People say the woman's got an evil eye.  
Got hell looking up, heaven looking down,  
Free me from the woman with the evil eye.
