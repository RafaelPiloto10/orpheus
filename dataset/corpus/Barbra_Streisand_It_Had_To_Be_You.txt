Seems like dreams like I always had  
Could be, should be making me glad  
Why am I blue?  
It's up to you to explain  
  
I'm thinking maybe, baby, I'll go away  
Someday, some way, you'll come and say it's you I need  
And you'll be pleading in vain  
It had to be you, had to be you  
  
I wondered around, finally found somebody who  
Could make me be true, could make me be blue  
And even be glad just to be sad  
Thinking of you  
  
Some others I've seen  
Might never be mean, might never be cross  
I tried to be boss, but they wouldn't do  
'Cause nobody else gave ma a thrill  
  
With all your faults I love you still  
Had to be you, crazy old you, had to be you
