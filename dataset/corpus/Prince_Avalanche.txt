He was not or never had been in favor  
Of setting are people free  
If it wasn't for the thirteenth Amendment  
We woulda been born in slavery  
He was not or never had been in favor  
Of letting us vote so you see...  
Abraham Lincoln was a racist who said  
"You cannot escape from history"  
  
Like the snow comin' down the mountain  
That landed on Wounded Knee  
Nobody wants to take the weight  
The responsibility  
  
Hear the joyous sound of freedom  
The Harlem Renaissance  
Hear Duke Ellington and his band  
Kick another jungle jam  
Ooh, do you wanna dance?  
Who's that lurking in the shadows?  
Mr. John Hammond with his pen in hand...  
Sayin' "Sign you're kingdom over to me  
And be known throughout the land!"  
But, you ain't got no money, you ain't got no cash  
So you sign yo name and he claims innocence  
Just like every snowflake in an avalanche...  
  
Like the snow comin' down the mountain  
That landed on Wounded Knee  
Nobody wants to take the weight  
The responsibility
