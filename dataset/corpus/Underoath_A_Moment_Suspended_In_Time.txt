Held captive, I'm a prisoner  
In the back room where the water leaks and I'm oh, so cold  
Command me on what to do, but we both know neither you or I are in control  
  
There's nothing left for me here  
I'm grabbing on to what's left of this hole.  
It's all too real this can't be happening  
  
Never again, ever again, will I say I'm OK  
I'm scared of the fate that will become mine  
  
No time to talk you know the drill  
  
Under my desk this can't be it  
I'm only dreaming, I've got to be dreaming  
But I can't get up. No time to talk, not this time, this is my place  
This is where I arrange  
  
It's so funny how we see things so clear when we have no time left to live  
  
So lay back now and take it in  
I won't say a word. I won't say anything  
  
I can't believe how it feels  
To stand here in this room  
And feel like it's going to blow  
I think we're all going to blow  
  
I've got to be dreaming  
We've got to be dreaming  
Please don't wake me up  
This is the end.
