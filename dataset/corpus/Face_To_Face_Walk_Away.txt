don't want to hear what you said  
don't want to kick in your head  
don't want to live my life that way  
don't want to give in but I don't want to be victimized  
don't want to know anything  
don't want to live my life that way  
  
walk away  
try to see things in a different way  
  
don't want to tell you your place  
don't want to get in your face  
don't want to live my life that way  
don't want to know what you think  
don't want to know anything  
don't want to live my life that way  
  
walk away  
try to see things in a different way
