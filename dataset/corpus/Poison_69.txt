Dick meets jane and a fire starts  
Jane leaves dick and it breaks his heart  
Dick asked jane, "why'd you leave me? "  
"cause you're not dangerous, rough or sleazy"  
  
Now dick's dangerous  
Now dick's rough  
Now dick's sleazy  
Nice guy dick don't live here anymore  
Dick bought a swanky love pad down by the shore  
  
Chorus  
He's going prime time  
Online  
69  
  
All the girls come around to get dick  
They all adore him now 'cause he acts like a prick  
Each one tries to tie dick down  
Dick never falls in love, on the girls start coming 'round  
Dick don't fall for their sweetness  
He knows their weakness  
Dick knows a secret  
Secret is dick leased himself a nice car  
Girls like car  
Girls like dick  
Dick scores  
  
Chorus  
Solo  
  
Suddenly jane wants back in dick's life  
'cause jane hears dick's a popular guy  
Jane looks good, dick takes her home  
Dick kicks hers out after he gets his bone  
  
Now jane wants him  
Now jane needs him  
Now jane loves him  
Jane loves dick now that she got the heave ho  
Jane got what she wanted  
Dick ain't a nice guy no more  
  
Chorus  
  
Spoken by woman: but I want dick!  
  
Solo
