Crazy game  
I never should have started to play  
But now you couldn't tear me away  
Love is sweet sweet baby  
So good to you  
And so bad  
And I fear  
The situations clear before my eyes  
Confusion wants to break me and it tries  
I've been a little bit stronger from the start  
Listen to my heart  
  
Cause if you're ever believing  
I'm thinking of leaving  
Look to the moon  
Cause it's a fact  
She may go wandering about  
But she always comes shining back  
And it's true  
I'll wait for you  
  
You dry your tears  
Don't be thinking grey is here to stay  
Sometimes everything is in the way  
You're wanting to look at it  
Turn your view around  
Dry your eyes  
Eyes like yours should carry a smile  
I haven't seen them sparkle in a while  
Give it one more try  
Dry your eyes  
  
Cause if you're ever believing  
I'm thinking of leaving  
Look to the moon  
Cause it's a fact  
She may go wandering about  
But she always comes shining back  
And it's true  
I'll wait for you
