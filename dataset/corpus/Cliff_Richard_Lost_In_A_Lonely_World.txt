Tomorrow never comes when you are looking foward to it  
You try so hard to live the day your way  
But what a life if you could live the way you want it  
You tried it once before but it didn't work out  
You know you need someone to bring out the best in you  
To be a light to you is what I intend to do  
To show the way you know you ought to go  
You'll see a world that will surely come into view  
So take the hand that I offer to you  
To see the truth that you will be no longer  
Lost, lost in a lonely world (lost and lonely)  
'cause I can see that there's life in your eyes  
If only you would realise  
That now you don't have to settle for this  
(you don't have to settle for this)  
You don't have to say "there's nowhere to go"  
You can find out anything you really wanna know
