I've seen it on your face  
Tells me more than any worn out old phrase  
So now we'll go separate ways  
Never again we two  
Never again, nothing I can do  
  
Like an image passing by, my love, my life  
In the mirror of your eyes, my love, my life  
I can see it all so clearly  
Answer me sincerely  
Was it a dream, a lie  
Like reflections of your mind, my love, my life  
Are the words you try to find, my love, my life  
But I know I don't posses you  
So go away, God bless you  
You are still my love and my life  
Still my one and only  
  
I've watched you look away  
Tell me is it really so hard to say  
Oh, this has been my longest day  
Sitting here close to you  
Knowing that maybe tonight we're trough  
  
Like an image passing by, my love, my life  
In the mirror of your eyes, my love, my life  
I can see it all so clearly  
Answer me sincerely  
Was it a dream, a lie  
Like reflections of your mind, my love, my life  
Are the words you try to find, my love, my life  
But I know I don't posses you  
So go away, God bless you  
You are still my love and my life  
  
Yes, I know I don't posses you  
So go away, God bless you  
You are still my love and my life  
Still my one and only
