You're not meant to be alone I'll share your dream  
I'll show you love you've never know-ow-own  
Two flames together in the deep of the night  
Up in your love  
  
Close by you, when you call, I'll take my stand  
One chance to make or lose it a-a-all  
This time my journey to wherever you are-are-are  
I sail on your river, so far my love we'll never be found  
  
If you believe we got eyes, that see in the dark  
And the power of love lives for making you mine  
And in the light of close investigation  
Is it only my imagination, I got you, I got you  
  
Moonlight shining on your face. my bridges burned  
With all my tears that you replaced  
Two hearts together is a beautiful sight  
I'll take you to heaven, so far my love will follow you there-ere  
  
If we believe we got eye-eyes that see in the dark  
And the power of love lives for making you mine  
Am I the light of someone you need more of  
Let me be that love you can be sure of  
Is it only my imagination, I got you  
  
Like the eagle that flies in the sun  
I'll be lost in your fire before we are do-o-one  
And the view from my window is brighter  
Born to be all you need  
  
We got eye-eyes that see in the dark  
And the power of love lives for makin' you mine  
Am I the light of someone you need more of  
Let me be that love you can be sure of  
Is it only my imagination, I got you  
  
We got eyes that see in the dark  
And the power of love lives (fade)
