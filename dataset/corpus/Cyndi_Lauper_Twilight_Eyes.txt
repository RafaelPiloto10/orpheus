I have carried all my hopes and dreams  
To this new land with my own two hands  
I have followed the sun away from ireland,  
Now like the red man, here I stand.  
  
You hear whispers of the homeland call,  
Love is less kind than the twilight.  
And the passion for me once in your green eyes,  
Like the sunlight fades from sight.  
  
Twilight eyes, I can taste the salty tears of goodbye.  
I can feel the cold north sea,  
You'll be sailing with the tide  
To the island in your emerald twilight eyes.
