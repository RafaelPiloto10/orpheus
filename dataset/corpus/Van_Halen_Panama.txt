Jump back, what's that sound  
Here she comes, full blast and top down  
Hot shoe, burnin' down the avenue  
Model citizen zero discipline  
  
Don't you know she's coming home with me?  
You'l lose her in the turn  
I'll get her!  
  
[Chorus:]  
Panama, Panama  
Panama, Panama  
  
Ain't nothin' like it, her shiny machine  
Got the feel for the wheel, keep the moving parts clean  
Hot shoe, burnin' down the avenue  
Got an on-ramp comin' through my bedroom  
  
Don't you know she's coming home with me?  
You'll lose her in the turn  
I'll get her!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, we're runnin' a little bit hot tonight  
I can barely see the road from the heat comin' off of it  
Ah, you reach down, between my legs  
Ease the seat back  
  
She's blinding, I'm flying  
Right behind the rear-view mirror now  
Got the feeling, power steering  
Pistons popping, ain't no stopping now!  
  
[Chorus]
