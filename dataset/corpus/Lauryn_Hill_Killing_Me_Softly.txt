Stromin my pain with his fingers  
Singin my life with his words  
Killing me softly with his song x2  
Telling my whole life with his words  
Killing me softly with his song  
  
Yea yea yea do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do  
  
I heard he sang a good song,  
I heard he had a style,  
And so I came to see him and listen for a while  
And there he was this young boy  
Stranger to my eyes  
  
Chorus:  
Stromin my pain with his fingers (one time, one time)  
Singin my life with his words (two times, two times)  
Killing me softly with his song x2  
Telling my whole life with his words  
Killing me softly with his song  
  
I felt all flushed with fever  
Embarrased by the crowd,  
I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud,  
I pray that he would finish  
But he just kept right on  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Wooooooaaaa ohhhhhhhhhh laaaa la la la la la la ohhh la laaa woaaa laa  
Aaaalaaaaaa  
  
Repeat chorus until fade
