I'm so grateful for everything you've ever given me  
How can I explain what it means to be loved by you  
By you, loved by you, loved by you  
  
Show my gratitude, gratitude, show my gratitude  
I wanna show my gratitude, gratitude, yeah  
  
Well, I was lonely, I was living with a memory  
But my cold and lonely nights ended when you sheltered me  
Loved by you, I was loved by you, yeah, I was loved by you  
  
I wanna show my gratitude, gratitude, show my gratitude to you  
Gratitude, show my gratitude to you, oh yeah  
  
I should stop loving you  
Think what you put me through  
But I don't want to lock my heart away  
I will look forward to  
Days when I'd be loving you  
Until then, gonna wish and hope and prey  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!  
  
I wanna show my gratitude, gratitude  
I wanna show my gratitude, show my (Gratitude)

To be loved by you, be loved by you  
Loved by you, to be loved by you
