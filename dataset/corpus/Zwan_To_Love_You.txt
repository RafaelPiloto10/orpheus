In overdrive  
I search for life and feeling  
No other ride  
'cause baby, I've tried  
Baby, I've tried to reach you  
To reach you so  
To love you  
To love you  
Your figure cuts the shape  
In the embrace of my will  
There's no mistake  
Baby, I've tried  
Baby, I've tried to love you  
To love you so  
To reach you  
To reach you  
To reach you  
All secrets all the time  
Are wishing more than fine I'm waiting  
Still no one on the lines out here  
I rode my horse  
Who ride in bliss  
She showed the course  
But baby, I've tried  
'cause baby, I've tried  
To love you  
To love you so  
Just to reach you
