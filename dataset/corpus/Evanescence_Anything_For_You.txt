I'd give anything to give me to you  
Can you forget the world that you thought you knew?  
  
If you want me  
Come and find me (I'm here for you)  
Nothing's stopping you  
So please release me  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll believe all your lies  
Just pretend you love me  
Make believe, close your eyes  
I'll be anything for you  
  
Nothing left to make me feel anymore  
There's only you and everyday I need more  
  
(If you want me) If you want me  
(Come and find me) Come and find me  
(Anything you want me to be) I'll do anything (anything) you say  
(For you) Just tell me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Anything for you  
  
I'll become your earth and sky  
Forever never die  
I'll be everything you need  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]
