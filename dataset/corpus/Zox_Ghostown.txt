Hey!  
  
Well I live in this ghost town  
The whispers from the walls will fall like feathers to the ground  
And I walk upon these cemetery streets  
I don't speak the language of the skeletons I meet  
  
I live in this ghost town  
The acid in the architecture is burning the place down  
And I look out on these solitary streets  
Empty as an afterthought in purple pools of gasoline  
Purple pools of gasoline  
  
Olie olie olie ah  
The river's all in flames  
Olie olie olie ah  
I can't go home again  
Olie olie olie ah  
This city speaks in rain  
  
Well I live in this ghost town  
The coffee burns like kerosene and the color of my world is brown  
I wander through these melancholy streets  
Quiet as a photograph and lonely as my vanity  
Yeah, lonely as my vanity  
  
Olie olie olie ah  
The river's all in flames  
Olie olie olie ah  
I can't go home again  
Olie olie olie ah  
City's rearranged  
  
Heh!  
  
Olie olie olie ah  
The river's all in flames  
Olie olie olie ah  
I can't go home again  
Olie olie olie ah  
City feels so strange  
  
And I'm never gonna to leave this ghost town  
And I'm never gonna to leave this ghost town  
No I'm never gonna to leave this ghost town  
No I'm never gonna to leave the ghost town, yeah
