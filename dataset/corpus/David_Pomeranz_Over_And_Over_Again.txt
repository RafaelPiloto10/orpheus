I was walking through the world alone  
Unknown  
Afraid to try again  
All I ever wanted was to feel  
Somethin' real  
And not say goodbye again  
Ev'ry night beneath the moon I'd pray  
Show me the way  
Though this loneliness  
Then you came into view  
And from that night I knew  
I'll love you over and over again  
I'll hold you close to my heart  
For every lifetime  
Now and forever I promise you  
To the end  
I'll love you over and over again  
  
Ev'ry time I look into your eyes  
And you smile  
It just amazes me  
How two people made of flesh and bone  
Get to be shown  
Such sweet eternity  
  
Let the mountains tumble, let 'em fall  
Through it all  
I'll be by your side  
And until time grows old  
With all my heart and soul  
  
I'll love you over and over again  
I'll hold you close to my heart  
For every lifetime  
Now and forever I promise you  
To the end  
  
I'll love you over and over again  
I'll love you over and over again  
I'll hold you close to my heart  
For every lifetime  
Now and forever I promise you  
To the end  
I'll love you over and over  
And over and over again  
  
I'll love you over and over again  
I'll hold you close to my heart  
For every lifetime  
Now and forever I promise you  
To the end  
I'll love you over and over again
