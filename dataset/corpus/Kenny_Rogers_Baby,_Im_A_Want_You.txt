Baby, I'm-a want you  
Baby, I'm-a need you  
You the only one I care enough to hurt about  
Maybe I'm-a crazy  
But I just can't live without  
Your lovin' and affection  
Givin' me direction  
Like a guiding light to help me through a darkest hour  
Lately I'm a-prayin'  
That you'll always be a-stayin' beside me  
  
Used to be my life was just emotions passing by  
Feeling all the while and never really knowing why  
  
Lately I'm a-prayin'  
That you'll always be a-stayin' beside me.  
  
Used to be my life was just emotions passing by  
Then you came along and made me laugh  
And made me cry  
You taught me why  
  
Baby, I'm-a want you  
Baby, I'm-a need you  
  
Oh, it took so long to find you, baby  
  
Baby, I'm-a want you  
Baby, I'm-a need you
