Confusion  
Desillution  
No Time  
No time for revolution  
No time for revolution  
Elutions for dath romance could breakup the bugs  
You go on makin' sense  
Back in the sixties: they standed there  
"Fight, fight for the dreams, fight for the right"  
In the seventies: follow, follow to go over to the place  
So went to San Francisco, somewhere far out the space  
In the eighties: I don't know, some did it for the money,  
Some did it for the showthere's no time  
No time to remember these days  
No time to hold back in that size  
We don't have no time, no time, no time...  
No time for revolution (4 times)In the nineties: there's a soul called those
generation  
For who is in charge for this situation and this station  
About politicians, no embitions - tell me what's the vision  
To be a winner, is never ever mather of how,  
Political correctness is the word of now  
The spirit of the money is the sound of the time  
There's something coming up to change your mindthere's no time...
