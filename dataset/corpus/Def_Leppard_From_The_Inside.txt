I am bad, I am evil  
I am winter, I am pain  
I'll mess up your life  
I'll beat up your wife  
I'll lose all your friends  
And I'll win in the end  
  
So you play the Joker  
And I'll play the clown  
And I'll laugh while you're up there  
And I'll laugh when you're down  
Though your screams break the silence  
Oh, they won't make a sound  
Na na na na na na na  
  
I will rise, I will take you  
I will break you, never let you go  
I'll shoot through your veins  
I'll drive you insane  
I'll poison your breath  
And I'll love you to death  
  
So you be the joker  
And I'll be the clown  
And you'll laugh when you're up there  
But you'll cry when you're down  
Though your screams break the silence  
Oh, they won't make a sound  
Na na na na na na na  
  
So you be the joker  
And I'll be the clown  
And you'll laugh when you're up there  
But you'll cry when you're down  
Though your screams break the silence  
Oh, they won't make a sound  
Na na na na na na naaa
