One life, is like one prayer, one love to share.  
One thought, one dream. One world, one meaning.  
A man that's lost everything holds his faith in his heart.  
Speaks to god of broken dreams,  
Never wondering why when nothing's heard, one prayer.  
  
A woman cries in frustration, her man holds it inside.  
They forgot what got them here,  
The vows they promised to stand by, one love.  
  
One life is like one prayer, one love to share.  
One thought, one dream.  
One world, one meaning.  
  
It don't cost much for you to get to heaven,  
You just got to say your prayers.  
If you want to stand with your saviors,  
You better learn how to bow your head.  
Now bend your knees and bruise the earth and pray.  
  
Heed the cries of the war child.  
Mothers hold them to their breasts.  
Fathers fight an enemy and fear breeds unto itself, one world.  
  
One life, is like one prayer, one love to share.  
One thought, one dream.  
One world, one meaning.  
One life, one
