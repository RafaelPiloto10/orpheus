[Verse 1]  
The chicks in the town been runnin' around  
Their on the loose  
Legs are spread for freedom for bread  
Their on the loose  
Can't get enough to satisfy their lust  
On the loose  
  
[Chorus]  
Killer girls waitin' in line for me  
Blood thirsty, get home in time for tea  
Killer girls for all you boys to see  
Easy action, get what you want for free  
  
[Verse 2]  
Never easy, got a stick shift disease  
Turn me loose  
I'll hypnotized when they give me the eye  
Turn me loose  
In their disguise I see murder and lies  
Turn me loose  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
Killer girls in a frenzy on me  
I got no more juice  
Take my advice, you'd better think twice  
No more juice  
They'll hump and bump you, forget your name  
Ya got more juice  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Alright  
Killer girls  
Killer girls  
Killer girls  
Killer girls  
Alright  
Killer girls (oh)  
Killer girls  
Killer girls  
Alright  
Killer girls
