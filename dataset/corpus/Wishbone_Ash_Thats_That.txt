What can I say?  
My position is clear  
When it comes to you  
I got the right idea.  
I just can't stand you  
For one more day -  
When daylight breaks  
I'll be miles away.  
'Cause I know what I want  
And I know you do too  
So that's that.  
  
This is the day I stand up and fight.  
There's no price on my head  
I know I'm right.  
The debt is all yours  
Now I'm going away  
I got a feeling someday you'll repay.
