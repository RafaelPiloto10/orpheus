It's easy to love when I love someone like you  
It's easy to feel when you feel the way I do  
You know love don't come easy and love don't come fast  
But when love comes to you, you gotta make it last  
On the day that I met you I knew it could be  
So easy for you and so easy for me  
  
It's easy to love when I love someone like you, babe  
It's easy to feel when you feel the way I do, babe  
Like the stars in the night seem to shine from above  
But that's the way that you shine when you give me your love  
And your love satisfies me like a natural high  
From the sole of my feet to the top of the sky  
  
It's easy to love when I love someone like you  
It's easy to feel when you feel the way I do  
You know love don't come easy and love don't come fast  
But when love comes to you, you gotta make it last  
On the day that I met you I knew it could be  
So easy for you and so easy for me  
  
It's easy to love when I love someone like you, babe  
Oh and I do, babe  
It's easy to feel when you feel the way I do, babe  
Oh and I do, babe  
It's easy to love when I love someone like you, babe  
It's easy to love  
It's easy to love
