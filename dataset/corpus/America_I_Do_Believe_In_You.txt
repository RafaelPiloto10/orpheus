They tried to catch us dancin' on the line  
They say we took it way too far this time  
They gave us no breaks here  
But we made our own I swear  
  
I do, I do believe in you  
After all that we've been through  
I do, I do believe in you  
And everything that we do  
  
We used to run with the dangerous crowd  
Where the flame was hot and burnin' out  
We knew we'd have to give  
It hit us where we lived  
  
I do, I do believe in you (I do believe in you)  
After all that we've been through together  
You took away my darkest nights (nights)  
No one else could see the light  
  
Runnin' blind day after day  
Some things never want to change, oh, oh  
We knew we'd have to give  
It hit us where we lived  
  
I do, I do believe in you (I do believe in you)  
After all that we've been through  
You took away my darkest nights (nights)  
No one else could see the light  
  
I do, I do believe in you (I do believe in you)  
After all that we've been through  
You took away my darkest nights (nights)  
No one else could see the light ...
