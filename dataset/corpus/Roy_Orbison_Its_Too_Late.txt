It's too late, she's gone  
It's too late, my baby's gone  
Wish I had told her she was my only one  
But it's too late, she's gone  
  
It's a weak man that cries  
So I guess I'd better dry my eyes  
Guess I will miss her more than anyone  
But it's too late she's gone  
  
She's gone yeah she's gone  
She's gone my baby's gone  
She's gone yeah she's gone  
Where can my baby be?  
  
I wonder does she know  
When she left me it hurt me so  
I need your lovin'  
Please don't make me wait  
And tell me it's not too late
