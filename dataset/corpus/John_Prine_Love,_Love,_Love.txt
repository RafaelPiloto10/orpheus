He stumbled through the alley with his long coat on  
Nothing but a bottle in his hand  
She sat in her apartment lonesome to the bone  
Wondering what had happened to her man  
  
[Chorus:]  
Love, love, love, love  
Nobody ever understands  
All the things that go,  
Between a woman and a man.  
  
When they'd walk down the sidewalk the street would shine  
With the kind of love no human heart can fake  
And they vowed to stay together till the end of time  
Like the couple that stands on top of the wedding cake  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If I should live to a ripe old age  
The only lesson I may ever learn  
Is to not stand so close to the flame of love  
Unless you are willing to get burned  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All the things that go,  
Between a woman and a man.
