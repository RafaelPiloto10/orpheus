I'm insane in the brain  
You're not ready to get caught  
Feel the pain rushing through my vain  
Don't you piss me off, pretentious, ostentatious  
Other words are spring to my head  
... Emolicious, for the shoot posses no spine  
  
And you want me to respect you  
And have none for yourself  
You're out of control with nobody around to help  
Help, help oh oh.  
  
Chorus:  
This time you're on your own  
Running back to mommy hoping that she's home  
But if she's not there and you're on your own  
To whom shall you then go  
Call it a fiasco, call it a fiasco  
1 2 3 4.  
  
Hustle mind, testify, you remain oblivious  
Wanna try to testify in the hope of happiness  
Be the best, have success,  
Doesn't mean you're Hollywood  
  
Feel blessed not impressed  
By the glamour if you think you could.  
  
And you want me to respect you  
And have none for yourself  
You're out of control with nobody around to help  
Help, help oh oh.  
  
Chorus:  
This time you're on your own  
Running back to mommy hoping that she's home  
But if she's not there and you're on your own  
To whom shall you then go  
Call it a fiasco, call it a fiasco  
1 2 3 4.  
  
Fiasco, fiasco  
  
[Chorus:]  
1 2 3 4  
I'm calling, I'm calling, I'm calling this a fiasco,  
I'm calling, I'm calling, I'm calling this a fiasco,  
I'm calling, I'm calling, I'm calling this a fiasco.
