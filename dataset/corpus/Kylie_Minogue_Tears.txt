Never would say  
I never need anyone  
Not now I have knowing  
Of the real love  
And I need to have you  
I could never give it up  
'Cause the hurt would be too much  
And the feeling I'm feeling  
Is a feeling I like  
It's only when I'm with you  
That I feel all right  
I'm amazed that it's come to this  
I love you to tears  
I love you to tears  
Ooh, falling into you  
I've fallen on my feet  
My world was only turnin'  
So that we could meet  
And I want you always  
I could never run away  
Workin' destiny today  
And the givin' I'm givin'  
Is a givin' I like  
It's easy when I'm with you  
To give into life  
I'm amazed that it's come to this  
I love you to tears  
I love you to tears  
I love you to tears  
I love you to tears  
Happier than high, this is happening  
So cool to have this salt water on my skin  
It's not a pool of sorrow that I'm harbouring  
These are tears of joy that I'm swimming in  
Happier than high, this is happening  
So cool to have this salt water on my skin  
It's not a pool of sorrow that I'm harbouring  
These are tears of joy that I'm swimming in  
Happier than high  
I'm happier than high  
I'm happier than high  
I'm happier than high  
I love you to tears  
I love you to tears  
I love you to tears  
I love you to tears  
I love you to tears  
I love you to tears  
I love you to tears
