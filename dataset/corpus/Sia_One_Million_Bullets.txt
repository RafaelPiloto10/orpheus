[Verse 1]  
Under the moonlight  
Weathering with your warm embrace  
Oh-oh-oh-oh  
I feel so safe here  
Baby we're worth the wait  
Oh-oh-oh-oh  
Yeah I picked the wrong kind  
Time after time  
I drank from the poisoned wine  
Yeah I picked the wrong kind  
Oh-oh-oh-oh  
But baby you're alright  
Yeah baby I seen the light  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I got a feeling, I got a feeling  
Danger is coming, a danger is coming  
A danger is coming  
I got a feeling, I got a feeling  
The war has been won here, the war has been won here  
  
[Chorus]  
Under the moonlight, under your moonlit gaze  
I know that I'd take one million bullets babe  
Yeah, one million bullets can come my way  
But I want you to know that, I'd take a million babe  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
How many will you take?  
How many will you take?  
How many will you take?  
How many will you take?  
Cause I'd take, one million bullets babe  
  
[Verse 2]  
If you were a poet and I was a faultless muse  
If you were the hero, yeah, I'd take a bullet for you  
So take me in your arms, take me for all I have  
Cause I'd give my life for one of your belly laughs  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I got a feeling, I got a feeling  
Danger is coming, a danger is coming  
A danger is coming  
I got a feeling, I got a feeling  
The war has been won here, the war has been won here  
  
[Chorus]  
Under the moonlight, under your moonlit gaze  
I know that I'd take one million bullets babe  
Yeah, one million bullets can come my way  
But I want you to know that, I'd take a million babe  
  
[Post-Chorus]  
How many will you take?  
How many will you take?  
How many will you take?  
How many will you take?  
Cause I'd take, one million bullets babe
