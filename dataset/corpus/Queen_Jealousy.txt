Oh how wrong can you be?  
Oh to fall in love  
Was my very first mistake  
How was I to know  
I was far too much in love to see?  
Oh jealousy look at me now  
Jealousy you got me somehow  
You gave me no warning  
Took me by surprise  
Jealousy you led me on  
You couldn't lose you couldn't fail  
You had suspicion on my trail  
  
How how how all my jealousy  
I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride  
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy  
  
Oh how strong can you be  
With matters of the heart?  
Life is much too short  
To while away with tears  
If only you could see  
Just what you do to me  
Oh jealousy you tripped me up  
Jealousy you brought me down  
You bring me sorrow you cause me pain  
Jealousy when will you let go?  
Gotta hold of my possessive mind  
Turned me into a jealous guy  
  
How how how all my jealousy  
I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride  
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy  
But now it matters not  
If I should live or die  
'Cause I'm only left with my own jealousy
