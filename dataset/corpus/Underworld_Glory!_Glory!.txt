Hey when that look is in your eyes  
I can see my fate  
Yes I see my fate  
  
Hey when that look is in your eyes  
I can see my fate  
Yes I see my fate  
Hey got the sun up in the sky  
But it comes too late  
Yes it comes too late  
  
I'm like a dog  
When I come crawlin' back-to-you  
Crawlin' back-to-you  
You want to play God  
I can see it in your eyes  
See it in your eyes  
Huh! Glory! Glory! Glory! Glory! GLORY!  
  
Hey I bring you joy - I bring you love  
But you walk away  
Always walk away  
Hey you look down on me from above  
And I see my fate  
And I'm not enough  
  
But - like a dog, I come crawlin' back to you  
Crawlin' back to you  
You want to play God  
I can see it in your eyes  
See it in your eyes  
Huh! Glory! Glory! Glory! Glory! GLORY!  
  
Take it from the rich  
And give it to the poor  
Oh yeah you want to take it from the rich  
And give it to the poor  
Take it from the rich and somehow  
Give it to the poor  
Ha! But you want - Glory! Glory! Glory! Glory! Glory!  
Well you got - Glory! Glory! Glory! Glory! Glory!  
Ch-ch-ch-woo-hoo!  
  
Take it from the rich  
Give it to the poor  
All you want is glory  
From the boy next door!
