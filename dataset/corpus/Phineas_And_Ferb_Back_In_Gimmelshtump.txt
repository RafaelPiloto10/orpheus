Dr. Doofenshmirtz: Back in Gimmelschtump  
I always had to keep it real  
Cause when you grow up in Gimmelshtump  
Young Heinz: Your childhood is less than ideal!  
Dr. Doofenshmirtz: So I don't dwell on how I'll crawled my way out of the
gutter  
No I don't!  
When people ask me what I mean, I say  
D-D-D-Do I stutter!  
  
Dr. Doofenshmirtz: But I'm no longer a hater  
Cause I got an Inator  
And a over-complicated scheme  
I get a couple of checks  
Every month from my Ex  
So I can finance my coming regime!  
  
And though my past was a wreck  
I won't let it affect  
My aspirations to cause mass hysteria  
Cause I'm as sure as can be  
That it's my destiny  
To be the ruler of the Tri-State Area!
