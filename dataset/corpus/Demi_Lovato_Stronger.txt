The night is getting darker  
And soon the stars will be falling down to rescue us,  
Sing a song for me,  
Lift me higher with your words,  
Sing that cold melody.  
  
So follow me  
Onto the moonlit sidewalk  
And take my hand  
Grip it tighter, and don't let it go  
  
Passions taking over skies  
Leaving sand behind for them to choke on  
And they'll try to speak  
Negatively about us,  
But they can't say another word  
But they'll realize,  
Jealousy has taken over their minds  
And the words they try to break me down with  
They only make us stronger.  
  
Did you feel that breeze?  
A tide of chills just swept over me  
It must of been from the brush of your hand  
Pull me into your arms  
A little closer baby  
I wanna see you standing  
Next to me  
  
So take a walk with me,  
But keep the pace down  
I don't want this night to end  
Can't we runaway together?  
  
Passions taking over skies  
Leaving sand behind for them to choke on  
And they'll try to speak  
Negatively about us,  
But they can't say another word...  
  
Passions taking over skies  
Leaving sand behind in the wind for them to choke on  
And they'll try to speak  
Negatively about us  
But they can't say another word  
But they'll realize,  
Jealousy has taken over their minds  
And the words they try to break me down with  
They all make us stronger  
  
The night is getting darker  
And soon the stars will be falling down to rescue us.
