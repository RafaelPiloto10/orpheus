She said she didn't understand  
And so she guessed he was deep  
She swore he'd never been to college  
And was too tall to be  
So as she led him to the slaughter  
Thinking she'd be laughing last  
Now the lady in the question is his better half  
She's gotta be the stupidest girl I've ever seen  
She don't care who, why, where I've been  
She's got a right to be  
With all that's wrong with me  
But she doesn't want to understand  
That she's a girl, and I'm a man  
He thought that women and drink would make a man out of him  
But the extent of his studies left a jaded man  
So as she led him to the altar, he was easily led  
And when they asked him if he did  
Wwell then this is what he said  
She's gotta be the stupidest girl I've ever seen  
She don't care who, why, where I've been  
She's got a right to be  
With all that's wrong with me  
But she doesn't want to understand  
That she's a girl, and I'm a man  
Well she's a girl, and I'm a man  
She's a girl, and I'm a man  
She's a girl, and I'm a man  
She's a girl, and I'm a man  
She's a girl, and I'm a man  
She's a girl  
She's gotta be the stupidest girl I've ever seen  
She don't care who, why, where I've been  
She's got a right to be, with all that's wrong with me  
But she doesn't want to understand  
That she's a girl, and I'm her man  
Every time she's near me  
She gives me any reason to be alive  
Try to get right  
Yeah, she looks right through me  
She says you're not cool  
You're just like me  
You're a stupid man  
Get over here, hold my stupid hand  
She's all right, yeah  
You wouldn't understand  
Sister is a man fan  
She's gotta be the stupidest girl I've ever seen  
She don't care who, why, where I've been  
She's got a right to be  
With all that's wrong with me  
But she doesn't want to understand  
That she's a girl, and I'm a man
