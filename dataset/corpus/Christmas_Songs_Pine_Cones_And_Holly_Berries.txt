Pine cones and Holly Berries  
Popcorn for you, apples for me  
Red striped candy, nut cracker handy  
Kettle a-bubbleing hot as can be.  
Snow clouds hang low and threatening  
Maybe in won't, praying it may  
The brightest fireplace glows in every face  
Waiting for Christmas day.  
  
There'll be walk-a-round songs and  
Talk-a-round songs  
Songs of the inn and stable.  
There'll be morning time songs and  
Evening time songs  
And grace at every table.  
And Jingle bells will jingle all the way all day.  
  
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
Everywhere you go
