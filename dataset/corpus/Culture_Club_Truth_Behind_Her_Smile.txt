Just see how she makes them love her  
Twisting the world around her finger  
Sensing weakness in a stranger  
With one kiss she'll re-arrange ya  
But I know the truth behind her smile  
Keep me warm tonight, never satisfy  
If you meet again she may pass you by  
No apologies, never compromise  
It's the truth behind her smile  
Just see how she makes them want her  
Oh, if I could be her for one day  
Sensing weakness in a stranger  
See them run, no sense of danger  
But I know the truth behind her smile  
Keep me warm tonight, never satisfy  
If you meet again she may pass you by  
No apologies, never compromise  
It's the truth behind her smile  
She'll let you down  
Keep me warm tonight, never satisfy  
If you meet again she may pass you by  
No apologies, never compromise  
It's the truth behind her...  
Truth behind her smile
