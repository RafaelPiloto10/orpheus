Scream thy last scream old woman with a casket  
Blam blam your pointers point your pointers  
What'll be to crunch in your sisters  
She'll be scrubbing bubbles on all fours  
Scream thy last scream old woman with a casket  
Fling your arms madly old lady with a daughter  
Flack chap chau fauses, mouses, houses  
Flittin and hittin and fittin quack quack  
Watching the teley till all hours big time  
Fling your arms madly old lady with a daughter  
Scream thy last scream old woman with a casket  
Blam blam your pointers point your pointers  
What'll be coming to crunch in your sisters  
She'll be scrubbing bubbles on all fours  
Scream thy last scream old woman with a casket
