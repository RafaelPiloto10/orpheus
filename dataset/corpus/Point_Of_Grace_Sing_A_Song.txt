When you feel down and out  
Sing a song, it'll make your day  
Here's a time to shout  
Sing a song, it'll make a way  
Sometimes it's hard to care  
Sing a song, it'll make your day  
A smile so hard to bear  
Sing a song, it'll make a way  
  
Singasong  
Singasong  
Singasong  
Singasong  
  
Bring your heart to believing  
Sing a song, it'll make your day  
Life ain't about no retrieving  
Sing a song, it'll make a way  
Give yourself what you need  
Sing a song, it'll make your day  
Smile, smile smile and believe  
Sing a song, it'll make a way  
  
Singasong  
Singasong  
Singasong  
Singasong
