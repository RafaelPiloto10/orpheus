Voodoo Lady  
Shakin' that stick and drivin' me crazy  
Your eyes look red and hazy  
Doin' that stuff that you do  
Messin' me up with your voodoo  
  
You drive me crazy with that  
Boogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie  
You drive me crazy with that  
Boogie boogie boogie  
  
Your lips are hot and spicy  
Servin' up red beans and rice  
At midnite she's a-howlin' and stompin'  
Makin' love to the gators in the swampin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I feel you now inside me  
Never once did you deny me  
Doin' that stuff that you do  
Knockin' me out with your voodoo  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Voodoo lady, shakin' that stick, drivin' me crazy  
Voodoo lady, oh yeah  
  
Boogie boogie boogie boogie  
  
[Repeat first verse]  
  
[Chorus]
