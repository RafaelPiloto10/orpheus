This is your wake up call, young hearts be free  
Get up, get on, get out about and shout it  
Tell 'em all you're dressed and on your way  
Oh there's absolutely no doubt about it  
This is your wake up call  
You're gonna miss it all  
Am I the only one out there that's listening  
Cause it's such a lovely noise that I can hear  
Eyes are opening up to all around them  
This is their wake up call  
They're gonna miss it all  
Can you feel what's happening here  
Everything is changing all around you  
It's in the air, electricity  
Everybody, yes everybody's waking up  
Good morning to you  
You're not the only one out there who's running  
But the man who's sitting next to you's asleep  
So pick him up and shake him till he hears you  
This is his wake up call  
He's gonna miss it all  
Can you feel what's happening here  
Everything is changing all around you  
It's in the air, electricity  
Everybody, yes everybody's waking up  
Good morning to you  
Those who've done all they can do sleep easy  
Those that turn away, they sleep alone  
But there's no doubt about it absolutely  
This is a wake up call  
We 're gonna miss it all  
This is your wake up call  
This is your wake up call  
This is your wake up call  
You're gonna miss it  
You're gonna miss it all
