The mood I'm in  
I can't explain  
Is black and white  
Much worse than pain  
The fear of this  
Se clear tonight  
Is next to me  
But not exactly  
  
It's obvious  
So plain to see  
That I'm not as dumb as  
You'd like me to be  
I'll take my chance  
On your will tonight  
But I won't fall off  
So don't act tough  
It's not enough  
  
No footsteps on the stair tonight  
No cigarettes for me to light  
No heavy scented clothes to fall to the floor  
But I'll hear you calling  
When you're not there  
You're walking on air  
  
Don't shame me now  
Just let me down  
Because I've bled enough  
To paint this town  
From east to west  
North to south  
The leeches crawl from hand to mouth  
And now my strength  
Is almost out  
It's running out  
  
No footsteps on the stair tonight  
No cigarettes for me to light  
No heavy scented clothes to fall to the floor  
But I'll hear you calling  
When you're not there  
You're walking on air  
  
No footsteps on the stair tonight  
No cigarettes for me to light  
No heavy scented clothes to fall to the floor  
But I'll hear you calling  
When you're not there  
You're walking on air
