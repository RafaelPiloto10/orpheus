He is the king  
Of all the land  
In the Kingdom of the sands  
Of a time tomorrow  
He rules the sandworms  
And the Fremen  
In a land amongst the stars  
Of an age tomorrow  
He is destined to be a king  
He rules over every thing  
In the land called planet Dune  
Body water is your life  
And without it you would die  
In the deserted planet Dune  
  
Without a stillsuit  
You would fry  
On the sands so hot and dry  
In a world called Arakis  
It is a land  
That's rich in spice  
The sandriders and the 'mice'  
That they call the 'Muad'Dib'  
He is the Kwizatz Haderach  
He is born of Caladan  
And will take the Gorn Jabbar  
He has the power to foresee  
Or to look into the past  
He's the ruler of the stars  
  
The time  
Will come for him  
To lay claim his crown  
And then the foe  
Yes they'll be cut down  
You'll see  
He'll be the best  
That there's been  
Messiah supreme  
True leader of men  
And when the time  
For judgement's at hand  
Don't fret he's strong  
And he'll make a stand  
'Gainst evil the fire  
That spreads  
Through the land  
He has the power  
To make it all end
