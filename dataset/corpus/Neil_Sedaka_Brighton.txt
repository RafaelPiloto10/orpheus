Walking alone, along the board walking Brighton  
The sun is high and so am I, I feel enlightened  
Mother nature's taking care of me  
Rocks me gently, naturally  
Seems like the sea was put there  
Just for me  
  
Running upon the beaches of my childhood  
I should have stayed forever, if only I could  
Coney Island on a Sunday night  
Rollercoaster rides, neon lights  
  
Me and my Brighton, baby, used to do alright  
  
La-la-la la-la-la la-la-la la-la-ran-da-a-da  
  
La-la-la la-la-la la-la-la la-la-ran-da-a-da  
  
Comes a time when eventually  
I'll have to leave here, permanently  
Now that old Brighton has become  
A part of me  
  
La-la-la la-la-la la-la-la la-la-ran-da-a-da  
  
La-la-la la-la-la la-la-la la-la-ran-da-a-da  
  
Comes a time when eventually  
I'll have to leave here, permanently  
  
Now that old Brighton has become a part of me  
Now that old Brighton has become a part of me
