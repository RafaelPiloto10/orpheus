Looking into your eyes I know I'm right  
If there's anything worth my love it's worth a fight  
We only get one chance  
But nothing ties our hands  
You're what I want  
Listen to me  
Nothing I want  
Is out of my reach  
  
Chorus  
(I'm free)  
Heaven helps the man who fights his fear  
Love's the only thing that keeps me here  
You're the reason that I'm hanging on  
My heart's staying where my heart belongs  
(I'm free)  
  
Running away will never make me free  
And nothing we sign is any kind of guarantee  
But I wanna hold you now  
And I won't hold you down  
  
I'm shaking the past  
Making my breaks  
Taking control  
If that's what it takes  
  
Chorus
