[Verse 1: see-Bo]  
Check, my uzi weigh a ton I hits 'em up an I run  
I'm loco, I keep a guns caulked in the lo-lo  
I'm King Tut of the hood  
'cause everytime I drop a record dog  
Shit I bring it to the gut of the hood  
An I ain't never backed down, so don't test me dog  
Cause I'm a nut, an keep a Smif-N-Wesson pressed in pause  
All these faggot ass rappers keep yappin they jaws  
Yeah they the shit 'cause when they see me they just crap in they drawers  
Yeah that nigga 50 he hot, but I heard he's a snitch  
And he ran up under that white boy, I heard he's a bitch  
An I ain't seen him in the hood, no where in the Valley  
No House of Blues, or Peanuts, he scared of them alleys  
Heard he copped his rims and 'Big O' tires in the hood  
Surrounded by police, wearin wires in the hood  
Heard they ran him outta New York, and he's comin to Cali  
No glocks and cigs, just lots of pigs  
Eh nig, your rap career will not outlast Pac and Big's  
Yeah you fuckin wit some kids that ain't scared of the bricks  
You in there, four-fifth kick dead in the bricks  
Thug Lordz'll have ya hit, split dead in a 6, c'mon  
[Chorus: see-Bo]  
THUG... LORDZ!  
Gettin this money like a motherfucker ready for war  
We'll never snitch  
Never flip  
Never quit my click was heaven sent wit Mac-11's to  
Hit when we dip they holla..  
THUG... LORDZ!  
Gettin this money like a motherfucker ready for war  
We'll never snitch  
Never flip  
Never quit my click was heaven sent wit Mac-11's to  
Hit when we dip they holla..  
[Verse 2: Yukmouth]  
Yeah..  
If the boss wants you dead, then it's off wit ya head  
'specially a bitch nigga that talk to the feds

To award shows cause niggaz bout to toss him some lead  
You niggaz think the West coast is just Dre an Xzibit  
They aiight, but pay attention Thug Lordz handle they business  
We the realest from the Gardens to the Village  
Make the hardest niggaz feel this  
Make the sargent want to kill us  
Regardless Godzilla will murda you nigga  
I twist ya cap like a Slits malt liquor for that slick talk nigga  
If ya nigga gang bang, don't crip walk nigga  
Wearin a big chain will get ya ripped off quicka  
We the only Thug Lordz bitch  
After all big faces like Mount Rushmore, you don't want war bitch  
That'll get you pistol whipped an extorted  
You lucky I wasn't on Face shit, I woulda destroyed it  
You better run like Forrest Gump in Air Forces  
Cause our guns look like torches, bustin from drop Porsches  
Or the drop Ferrari, hotter than a hot tamale  
The T-H-you-G-L-O-are-D'z holla..  
[Chorus]  
THUG LORDZ!  
Gettin this money like a motherfucker ready for war

Hit when we dip they holla..  
THUG LORDZ!  
Gettin this money like a motherfucker ready for war  
We'll never snitch  
Never flip  
Never quit my click was heaven sent wit Mac-11's to  
Hit when we dip they holla (they holla)
