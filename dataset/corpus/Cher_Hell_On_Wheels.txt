Well I'm hell on wheels I'm a roll on mama  
I can slide down places that you never knew  
Try me on for size at the roll-a-rama  
If you tie my laces and I'll follow you  
Follow you follow you  
  
[Chorus]  
See something I like, gonna go for it  
See something I want, I'm gonna go after it  
See something I like, gonna go for it  
See something I want  
Let's roll hell on wheels let's roll  
Come on and roll with me  
I roll at a quarter till three yeah  
And let's rock hell on wheels let's rock  
Come on and rock it with me  
I'll make you feel so free yeah, Look out  
  
Well I'm hell on wheels say I'm roller crazy  
I won't go too fast no I won't go too far  
We'll be high on wheel if the room gets hazy  
Just look out for me I'm your guiding star  
guiding star, guiding star  
  
See something you like, better go for it  
See something you want, better get down on it  
See something you like, better go for it  
See something you want  
  
Let's roll hell on wheels let's roll  
Come on and roll with me  
I roll at a quarter till three yeah  
And let's rock hell on wheels let's rock  
Come on and rock it with me  
I'll make you feel so free yeah, look out  
  
If you see something you like, you better go for it  
If you see something you want, you better get down on it  
If I see something I like, I'm gonna go for it  
If I see something I want  
You know I'm gonna get down on it  
  
Well I'm hell on wheels I'm a roll on mama  
I can slide down places that you never knew  
Try me on for size at the roll-a-rama  
If you tie my laces and I'll follow you  
Follow you follow you  
  
[Chorus]
