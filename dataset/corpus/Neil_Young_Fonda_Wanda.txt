Well, I went with Mary Lou  
Tried Peggy Sue  
Had a date with Donna  
And Barbara Ann too  
But I'm kinda fonda Wanda.  
Kinda fonda Wanda.  
Yeah, I'm kinda fonda Wanda.  
'Cause Wanda always  
Wanna, wanna, wanna.  
  
Well, I went out with Jenny  
Took out skinny Minnie  
Long tall Sally  
And short fat Fanny.  
But I'm kinda fonda Wanda.  
Kinda fonda Wanda.  
Yeah, I'm kinda fonda Wanda.  
'Cause Wanda always  
Wanna, wanna, wanna.  
  
Did the bop with Miss Ann  
The swim with Mary Ann,  
The stroll with Betty Lou  
Screwed runaround Sue  
But she wasn't  
As good as Wanda,  
No, she'll never be  
As good as Wanda.  
I'm kinda fonda Wanda.  
'Cause Wanda always  
Wanna, wanna, wanna.  
Wanna, wanna, wanna,  
Wanna, wanna, wanna.  
  
Kinda fonda Wanda.  
Kinda fonda Wanda.  
Yeah, I'm kinda fonda Wanda.  
'Cause Wanda always  
Wanna, wanna, wanna.  
Wanna, wanna, wanna,  
Wanna, wanna, wanna.  
Wanna, wanna, wanna,  
Wanna, wanna, wanna.
