Well I feel better all over more than anywhere else baby when I'm out with you  
Well I feel better all over more than anywhere else when you kiss me like you
do  
Well am as wild as a buck every time you cause me up  
You sure make me feel like a wheel  
Well I feel better all over more than anywhere else that's exactly how I feel  
  
Oh I feel better all over more than anywhere else  
When you whisper sweet nothings in my ear  
Oh I feel better all over more than anywhere else honey anytime that you're
near  
Well my heart beats double time when you hold your hand in mine  
You sure is a wonderful deal  
Well I feel better all over more than anywhere else that's exactly how I feel  
Oh that's exactly how I feel
