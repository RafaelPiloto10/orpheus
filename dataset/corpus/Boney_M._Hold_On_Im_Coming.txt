Don't you ever feel sad  
Lean on me when the times are bad  
When the day comes  
And you are down  
  
In a bit of trouble  
And you bite the ground  
Just hold on, I'm coming  
  
Hold on, I'm coming  
Hold on, I'm coming  
Hold on, I'm coming  
  
I'm on my way your lover  
If you get cold I'll be your cover  
Don't have to worry, cause I'm here  
You don't have to suffer, baby  
  
'Cause I'm here  
Just hold on, I'm coming  
  
Hold on, I'm coming  
Hold on, I'm coming  
Hold on, I'm coming  
  
You talk to me for satisfaction  
Call my name for reaction
