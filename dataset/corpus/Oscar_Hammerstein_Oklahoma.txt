They couldn't pick a better time to start in life!  
It ain't too early and it ain't too late  
Startin as a farmer with a brand new wife  
Soon be liv-in in a brand new state!  
  
Brand new state  
Gonna treat you great!  
  
Gonna give you barley, carrots and per-taters  
Pasture for the cattle  
Spinach and ter-may-ters  
Flowers on the prairie where the June bugs zoom!  
Plen'y of ao air and plen'y of room  
Plenty o' room to swing a rope  
Plen'y of heart and plen'y of hope!  
  
Oklahoma where the wind comes sweeping down the plain  
And the wavin' wheat can sure smell sweet  
When the wind comes right behind the rain  
Oklahoma ev'ry night my honey lamb and I  
Sit alone and talk, and watch a hawk  
Makin lazy circles in the sky  
  
We know we belong to the land  
And the land we belong to is grand  
And when we say  
Yeow! A-YIP-I-O-EE-AY  
We're only sayin "You're doing fine Oklahoma!"  
Oklahoma, OK

Where the wav-in wheat can sure smell sweet
