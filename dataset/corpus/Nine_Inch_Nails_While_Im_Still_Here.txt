Only thing I've ever done  
Ticking time is running out  
  
Closest I've ever come  
Ticking time is running out  
  
Oh so tired on my own  
Ticking time is running out  
  
Best days I've ever known  
Ticking time is running out  
  
Yesterday I found out the world was ending  
Yesterday I found out the world was ending  
  
A little more  
Every day  
Falls apart and  
Slips away  
  
I don't mind  
I'm okay  
Wish it didn't  
Have to end this way  
  
These four walls are closing in  
Ticking time is running out  
  
Of all the things that might have been  
Ticking time is running out yeah  
  
Watch young love is fucking back  
Ticking time is running out yeah  
  
God forgive me if I cry  
Ticking time is running out  
  
A little more  
Every day  
Falls apart and  
Slips away  
  
I don't mind  
I'm okay  
Nothing ever  
Stays the same  
  
While we can  
Remember when  
Always running  
Even then  
  
Stay with me  
Hold me near  
  
And I'm still here
