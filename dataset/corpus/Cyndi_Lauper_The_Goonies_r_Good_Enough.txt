Here we are  
Hanging onto strains of greed and blues  
Break the chain then we break down  
Oh it's not real if you don't feel it  
Unspoken expectations  
Ideals you used to play with  
They've finally taken shape for us.  
  
What's good enough for you  
Is good enough for me  
It's good enough  
It's good enough for me  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Now you'll say  
You're startin' to feel the push and pull  
Of what could be and never can  
You mirror me stumblin' through those  
  
Old fashioned superstitions  
I find too hard to break  
Oh maybe you're out of place  
  
What's good enough for you  
Is good enough for me  
It's good enough  
It's good enough for me  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
(good enough) for you  
Is good enough for me  
It's good, it's good enough  
It's good enough for me  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Old fashioned superstitions  
I find too hard to break  
Oh maybe you're out of place  
  
What's good enough for you  
Is good enough for me  
It's good enough  
It's good enough for me  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
(good enough) for you  
Is good enough for me  
It's good, it's good enough  
It's good enough for me  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
(scat)
