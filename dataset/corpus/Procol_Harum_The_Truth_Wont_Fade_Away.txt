We were young, we were brave, we were true, we were strong  
Far away the bombs an' the buildings explodin'  
there was no way out  
It was black, it was white, we had so much to say  
Right or wrong... The truth won't fade away  
  
We had our hopes, we had our dreams, we were young, we were old  
We saw our future self-destructing: there were roles that we played  
Some were good, some were bad: there was so much to say  
Right or wrong... The truth won't fade away
