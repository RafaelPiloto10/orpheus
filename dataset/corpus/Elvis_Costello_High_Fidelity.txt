Some things you never get used to  
Even though you're feeling like another man  
There's nothing that he can do for you  
To shut me away as you walk through  
Lovers laughing in their amateur hour  
Holding hands in the corridors of power  
Even though I'm with somebody else right now  
  
High fidelity  
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?  
Can you hear me?  
  
High fidelity  
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?  
Can you hear me?  
  
There's a new kind of dedication  
Maybe you'll find it down the tunnel  
Maybe I got above my station  
Maybe you're only changing channel  
  
Even though you're nowhere near me  
And I know you kiss him so sincerely now  
Even though the signal's indistinct  
And you worry what silly people think  
Who just can't wait to feel so frozen out  
I bet he thinks that he was chosen out of millions  
I suppose he'll never know about  
  
High fidelity  
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?  
Can you hear me?  
  
High fidelity  
Can you hear me? Can you hear me?  
Can you hear me?  
Can you hear me?
