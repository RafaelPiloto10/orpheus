They tried to tell us we're too young  
Too young to really be in love  
They say that loves a word  
A word we've only heard  
But can't begin to know  
The meaning of  
  
And yet we're not too young to know  
This love will last though years may go  
And then some day they may recall  
We were not too young at all  
  
And yet we're not too young to know  
That this love will last though years may go  
And then some day they may recall  
We were not too young at all
