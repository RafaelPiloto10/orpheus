Long ago the brothers fought  
But still the tears are shed  
So here we stand no wiser than before  
Still the hunter rules the hearts of men  
  
Whether I'm right or I'm wrong  
Too weak or strong  
Sure seems plain to me  
Too young or old  
Too shy or bold  
We all need help  
Just to move the stone  
  
Those special favors to light the road  
Songbird when you comin' home  
On the highway the going's tough  
It's harmony that splits the dark  
  
How long (Sha-la-la-la-la-lala)  
Sing it sweet need the harmony  
Brother it's taken too long  
(Sha-la-la-la-la-lala)  
What makes it shine is the harmony  
  
If I'm right or I'm wrong  
Too weak or strong  
Whether I flop or I steal the show  
If we sink or we swim  
We lose or win  
What's yours and mine is the harmony  
  
Those special favors you're on your own  
Songbird when you comin' home  
On the highway the going's rough  
It's harmony that splits the dark  
  
How long (Sha-la-la-la-la-lala)  
Sing it sweet need the harmony  
Brother it's taken too long  
(Sha-la-la-la-la-lala)  
What makes it shine is the harmony  
  
It's the harmony  
Sweet harmony  
What makes it shine is the harmony  
It's the harmony  
(Sha-la-la-la-la-lala)  
Swee-e-e-e-e-et harmony  
Harmony  
It's taken too long (Sha-la-la-la-la-lala)  
What makes it shine is the harmony  
It's the harmony (Sha-la-la-la-la-lala)  
Harmony  
Swee-e-e-e-e-et harmony
