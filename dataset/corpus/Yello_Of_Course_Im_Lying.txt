Her name was Julie  
When she took me on a ride in her old Chevrolet  
Straight into a dusty sundown  
I knew she was gonna make up one of her stories  
And then she couldn't believe that I told her  
How much I love her lies and how much I love her games  
  
Riding on the highway  
You're going much too far  
You're lying so much better  
When you drive a car  
You're lying 'til the sundown  
So look into my face  
You're lying (I love it)  
You're lying (I love it)  
You're lying (I love it)  
You're lying (I love it)  
You're lying  
  
I love your games  
I love your lies  
I love your games  
Look in my eyes  
Don't believe I'm worried  
When you're playing all these games  
I love your lies just hold me tight  
I got no one to blame  
You're lying, I'm buying  
I'm buying every word  
I love your lies  
I love your games  
  
Take me to the ballroom  
We're dancing through the night  
I'm in your arms, I love your lies  
They make me feel so light  
You're lying to your shadow  
So look into my face  
You're lying (I love it)  
You're lying (I love it)  
You're lying (I love it)  
You're lying (I love it)  
You're lying  
  
Julie stopped her car  
The sun had gone and left one of these dark red skies  
She looked in my eyes and with a smile in her face she said  
"Of Course I'm Lying.  
But I think I love you."  
  
Take me on the highway  
You're going much too far  
You're lying even better  
When you drive a car  
You're lying 'til the sundown  
So look into my face  
You're lying (I love it)  
You're lying (I love it)  
You're lying (I love it)  
You're lying (I love it)  
You're lying  
  
I love your games  
I love your lies  
I love your games  
Look in my eyes  
Take me in your arms and hold me tight just for tonight  
I need no drugs I love your lies  
You hide me from the night  
You're lying, I'm buying  
I'm buying every word  
I love your lies  
I love your games
