Go aheah and build a better messiah, we can dig another grave  
This is your calling.  
If you are hearing this, there is nothing I can do  
Something has grown in my chest.  
And I have seen it.  
It is hard and cold.  
It's been dormant for many years.  
I have tried to save you, but I cannot come to save you  
But this is what you deserve  
This is whta we deserve  
This is something that we have brought upon ourselves  
We are not a victim, you are not a victim  
We are not a victim, you are not a victim  
God will grovel before me.  
God will crawl at my feet.  
These are the dying years.  
These are the dying years.  
When you are suffering, know that I have betrayed you.
