[Harry:]  
Written in these walls  
Are the stories that I can't explain  
I leave my heart open  
But it stays right here empty for days  
  
[Liam:]  
She told me in the morning  
She don't feel the same about us in her bones  
It seems to me, that when I die  
These words will be written on my stone  
  
[Zayn:]  
And I'll be gone, gone tonight  
The ground beneath my feet is open wide  
The way that I've been holdin' on too tight  
With nothing in between  
  
[Harry:]  
The story of my life, I take her home  
I drive all night to keep her warm  
And time is frozen (the story of, the story of)  
  
[All:]  
The story of my life, I give her hope  
I spend her love until she's broke, inside  
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)  
  
[Niall:]  
Written on these walls are  
The colors that I can't change  
I leave my heart open  
But it stays right here in it's cage  
  
[Liam:]  
I know that in the morning,  
I'll see us in the light upon a hill  
Although I am broken,  
My heart is untamed, still  
  
[Louis:]  
And I'll be gone, gone tonight  
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright  
The way that I've been holdin' on so tight  
With nothing in between  
  
[Harry:]  
The story of my life, I take her home  
I drive all night to keep her warm  
And time is frozen (the story of, the story of)  
  
[All:]  
The story of my life, I give her hope  
I spend her love until she's broke, inside  
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)  
  
[Zayn:]  
And I've been waiting for this time to come around  
But baby running after you is like chasing the clouds  
  
[Niall:]  
The story of my life, I take her home  
I drive all night to keep her warm  
And time is frozen  
  
[All:]  
The story of my life I give her hope (give her hope)  
I spend her love until she's broke (until she's broke inside)  
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)  
The story of my life  
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)  
  
[Harry:]  
The story of my life
