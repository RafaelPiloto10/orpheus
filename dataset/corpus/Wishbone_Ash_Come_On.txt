Everything is wrong since me and my baby parted,  
All day long I'm walkin', 'cause I can't get my car started.  
Laid off from my job, and I can't afford to check it -  
I wish someone would come along right into it and wreck it!  
Come on! I can't get started,  
Come on! since me and my baby parted,  
Come on! I can't afford to check it,  
I wish someone would come along right into it and wreck it!  
Come on!  
  
Everything is wrong, since I've been without you.  
Every night I lie awake, thinking about you.  
Every time the phone rings, it sounds like thunder -  
Some stupid jerk tryin' to reach another number!  
  
Come on! since I've been without you,  
Come on! steady thinkin' about you,  
Come on! phone sounds like thunder -  
Some stupid jerk tryin' to reach another number!  
Come on!  
  
Now everything is wrong since I last saw you baby,  
I really want to see you, and I don't mean maybe.  
I'm doin' everything to try to make you see  
That I belong to you, and you belong to me.  
  
Come on! I want to see you baby,  
Come on! I don't mean maybe.  
Come on! I'm tryin' to make you see  
That I belong to you, and you belong to me!  
Come on!  
  
Come on, come on, come on.....
