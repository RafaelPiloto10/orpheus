Bring 'em all in, bring 'em all in, bring 'em all in,  
Bring 'em all in, bring 'em all into my heart  
Bring 'em all in, bring 'em all in, bring 'em all in  
Bring 'em all in, bring 'em all into my heart  
  
Bring the little fishes  
Bring the sharks  
Bring 'em from the brightness  
Bring 'em from the dark  
  
Bring 'em from the caverns  
Bring 'em from the heights  
Bring 'em from the shadows  
Stand 'em in the light  
  
Bring 'em out of purdah  
Bring 'em out of store  
Bring 'em out of hiding  
Lay them at my door  
  
Bring the unforgiven  
Bring the unredeemed  
Bring the lost, the nameless  
Let 'em all be seen  
Bring 'em out of exile  
Bring 'em out of sleep  
Bring 'em to the portal  
Lay them at my feet  
  
Bring 'em all in, bring 'em all in, bring 'em all in,  
Bring 'em all in, bring 'em all into my heart  
Bring 'em all in, bring 'em all in, bring 'em all in  
Bring 'em all in,bring 'em all in to my heart
