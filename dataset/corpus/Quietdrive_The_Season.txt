I'm feeling mixed up.  
A little bit confused  
About the time I hit it up again.  
I'm feeling left out.  
A little bit concerned about  
The space between last night and Monday.  
  
But I'm still afraid  
That you haven't  
Changed  
(Given me a reason)  
(To pull of your t-shirt)  
But I'm still ok,  
And I don't know why  
(Tell me your secret)  
(I won't tell your boyfriend now)  
When you say that  
  
You're mixing me up now  
You're pulling my teeth out  
You're wishing my argument away  
I'll follow directions  
I'll stick to your reasons  
This isn't the season to go running away  
Oh oh oh. Oh oh oh. Oh oh oh.  
  
I'll leave you untouched.  
I never once said  
I would be the one to tie you down forever.  
I haven't missed you much.  
I never once said  
I would be the one to lose this love forever.  
  
But I'm still afraid  
That you haven't  
Changed  
(Given me a reason)  
(To pull of your t-shirt)  
But I'm still ok,  
And I don't know why  
(Tell me your secret)  
(I won't tell your boyfriend, now)  
When you say that you don't need me to feel  
  
You're mixing me up now  
You're pulling my teeth out  
You're wishing my argument away  
I'll follow directions  
I'll stick to your reasons  
This isn't the season to go running away  
Oh oh oh. Oh oh oh. Oh oh oh.  
  
You don't understand  
You don't  
You don't understand  
You don't  
( I can't tell you how to feel)  
You don't understand  
(When I'm on the outside)  
You don't  
(And you are in)  
You don't understand  
  
You're mixing me up now  
You're pulling my teeth out  
You're wishing my argument away  
I'll follow directions  
I'll stick to your reasons  
This isn't the season to go running away  
Oh oh oh. Oh oh oh. Oh oh oh.  
Oh Oh.  
  
You don't understand  
You don't  
You don't understand  
You don't  
You don't understand  
You don't  
You don't understand
