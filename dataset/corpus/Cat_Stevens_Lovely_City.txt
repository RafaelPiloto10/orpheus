Lovely city, when do you laugh?  
Stoney people, what do you have?  
  
Well, you ride around on a bright shiny cloud  
And you think that you've found true happiness  
There's no method in your mind  
And your tempers are kind  
Is it too much to ask to give it a rest?  
  
Lovely city, when do you laugh?  
Stoney people, what do you have?  
  
I'm a part of you, you don't wanna be  
I'm an unexpected visitor who's dropped in for tea  
But I'm not so low you don't even know that I'm here  
You can't even see  
  
Lovely city, when do you laugh?  
Stoney people, what do you have?
