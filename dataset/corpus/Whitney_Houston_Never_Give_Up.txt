Till you get it right, tell 'em you will never quit  
Tell 'em you will never quit until they day you get it right,  
Till you get it right, hold your hand to the sky  
Look 'em right in the eye, tell 'em you will never quit  
Until the day you get it right  
Till you get it right  
Tell 'em you will never quit, until the day you get it right  
Till you get it right, hold your hand to the sky  
Look 'em right in the eye, tell 'em you will never quit  
Until the day you get it right  
  
Single mother, two jobs, workin' her fingers to the bone  
Putting her daughters mouth before her own  
She's gotta do it, but she's still feeling  
Like there's something deep inside that she can't leave behind  
  
She won't let go of it, no matter how many times  
She hears it over with, it's all fixed in her mind  
That it's gonna get better and she won't ever  
Hang her head again, break a sweat again, never again  
  
[Chorus]  
Never, never give up, never, never give up,  
No matter how many times, somebody tells you it ain't working  
Never, never give up, never, never give up,  
Hold your head tot he sky, look them right in the eyes  
Tell you will never quit until the day you get it right  
Never, never give up, never, never give up,  
Even though some days you'll have to cry,  
Shake it off and know that everything will be alright  
As long as you never, never give up, never, never give up.  
  
College student, paying her own way,  
Working the club at night  
Look what she go through, to stay in law school  
So maybe one day, she can make her way in a man's world  
And never be called just another girl  
  
It ain't nothing like a dream you can't see  
Even when the people round you don't believe  
But in the twelfth round, when you're against the ropes,  
Here comes your last minute miracle,  
You've got to know to  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The sky is the limit, for whatever you want to do  
Don't let anyone tell you, it ain't possible  
No matter how low you feel, keep going higher, higher  
See I've been holding on, to my dreams too long  
To watch it get away from me,  
This hand is mine to win, and I promise you that  
I'll never, never give up  
  
[Chorus: x2]
