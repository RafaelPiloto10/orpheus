Sparkling angel I believed  
You were my savior in my time of need.  
Blinded by faith I couldn't hear  
All the whispers, the warnings so clear.  
I see the angels,  
I'll lead them to your door.  
There's no escape now,  
No mercy no more.  
No remorse cause I still remember  
The smile when you tore me apart.  
  
You took my heart,  
Deceived me right from the start.  
You showed me dreams,  
I wish they would turn into real.  
You broke the promise and made me realize.  
It was all just a lie.  
  
Sparkling angel, I couldn't see  
Your dark intentions, your feelings for me.  
Fallen angel, tell me why?  
What is the reason, the thorn in your eye?  
  
I see the angels,  
I'll lead them to your door  
There's no escape now  
No mercy no more  
No remorse cause I still remember  
The smile when you tore me apart  
  
You took my heart,  
Deceived me right from the start.  
You showed me dreams,  
I wished they would turn into real.  
You broke the promise and made me realize.  
It was all just a lie.  
Could have been forever.  
Now we have reached the end.  
  
This world may have failed you,  
It doesn't give you reason why.  
You could have chosen a different path in life.  
  
The smile when you tore me apart.  
  
You took my heart,  
Deceived me right from the start.  
You showed me dreams,  
I wish they would turn into real.  
You broke the promise and made me realize.  
It was all just a lie.  
  
Could have been forever.  
Now we have reached the end.
