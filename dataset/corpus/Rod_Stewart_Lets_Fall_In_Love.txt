We might have been meant for each other  
To be or not to be, let our hearts discover  
I have a feelin', it's a feelin' I'm concealin', I don't know why  
It's just a mental, incidental, sentimental, alibi  
But I adore you, so strong for you  
Why go on stallin', I'm fallin', love is callin', why be shy?  
  
Let's fall in love  
Why shouldn't we fall in love?  
Our hearts are made of it  
Let's take a chance, why be afraid of it?  
  
Let's close our eyes  
And make our own paradise  
Little we know of it  
Still we can try to make a go of it  
  
Now, we might have been meant for each other  
To be or not to be, let our hearts discover  
  
Let's fall in love  
Why shouldn't we fall in love?  
Now is the time for it, while we are young  
Let's fall in love  
  
Let's fall in love  
Let's fall in love
