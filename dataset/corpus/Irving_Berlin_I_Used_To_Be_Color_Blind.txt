Strange  
How a dreary world can suddenly change  
To a world as bright as the evening star  
Queer  
What a difference when your vision is clear  
And you see things as they really are  
  
I used to be color-blind  
But I met you and now I find  
There's green in the grass  
There's gold in the moon  
There's blue in the skies  
  
That semi-circle that was always hanging about  
Is not a storm cloud, it's a rainbow  
And you brought the colors out  
  
Believe me it's really true  
Till I met you I never knew  
A setting sun could paint such beautiful skies  
  
I never knew there were such lovely colors  
And the big surprise  
Is the red in your cheeks  
The gold in your hair  
The blue in your eyes
