No apology necessary shut your mouth  
You've closed your mind  
We've been walking this road forever  
It don't lead to paradise  
  
In the mirror your sad reflection haunting you  
Now I see mine  
Yes I see mine  
And you just don't get it  
  
But you just might regret it, you might regret it  
Shooting the rainbows from the sky  
Throwing your love to passers by  
Begging forgiveness for your crime  
  
Never prepared to do your time  
It's always them and never you  
'Cause you're so see through, I see through you  
('Cause you're so see thru)  
  
Ain't no use in demanding justice  
You're a victim of your sight  
I held you up when your heart was heavy  
Now you never give me mine  
  
In the mirror my sad reflection haunting me  
One more time, one more time  
And you just don't get it, do ya?  
But you just might regret it, yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Shooting the rainbows from the sky  
Throwing your love to passers by  
Begging forgiveness for your crime  
Never prepared to do your time  
  
It's always them and never you  
'Cause you're so see through, I see through you  
('Cause you're so see thru)  
Shooting the rainbows from the sky  
  
Throwing your love to passers by  
Begging forgiveness for your crime  
Never prepared to do your time  
It's always them and never you  
  
Boy you're so see through, I see through you  
('Cause you're so see thru)  
You just don't get it, no you just don't get it  
You just don't get it but you might regret it  
  
You might regret it  
Shooting the rainbows from the sky  
Throwing your love to passers by  
Begging forgiveness for your crime  
  
Never prepared to do your time  
It's always them and never you  
'Cause you're so see through, I see through you  
('Cause you're so see thru)  
  
Shooting the rainbows from the sky - you're so see through  
Throwing your love to passers by  
Begging forgiveness for your crime - throwing your love to passers by, you're
so see through  
Never prepared to do your time  
  
It's always them and never you - never prepared to do your time, you're so see
through  
'Cause you're so see through, You're so see through, yeah yeah  
Shooting the rainbows from the sky  
Throwing your love to passers by  
  
Begging forgiveness for your crime  
Never prepared to do your time  
It's always them and never you  
'Cause you're so see through, 'Cause you're so see through
