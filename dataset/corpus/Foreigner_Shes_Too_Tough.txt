My girl, everybody says she's alright  
And I know that she's more than alright  
Well, she's a hard headed woman  
Got a mean attitude  
I may have bitten off more than I can chew  
I get a little light headed  
At her altitude  
But she goes one step higher  
  
If I'm going to spend the rest of my life  
With a woman like that, I better think twice  
  
She's too tough  
I said she's too tough  
From the moment she wakes up  
Her mind is made up  
She's too tough, she's too tough  
  
My girl, she's got a way about her  
I know I can never live without her  
She's a hard headed woman  
So hard to please  
She's got her own way of dealing with me  
I'm out on a limb, I'm a cat up a tree  
But this tree's on fire  
  
I want that woman for the rest of my life  
I don't know if I'm up to payin' the price  
  
She's too tough  
I said that she's too tough  
From the moment she wakes up  
Her mind is made up  
She's too tough  
  
You hear she's too tough  
Well I don't believe  
I'll ever leave her  
She's too tough, she's too tough  
  
Well if I'm gonna spend the rest of my life  
With a woman like her, I'd better think twice  
  
She's too tough  
I said she's too tough  
From the moment she wakes up  
Her mind is made up  
She's too tough, that's right  
  
She's too tough  
If I do what I'm told  
She's gooder than gold to me  
She's too tough  
  
I said she's too tough  
When push comes to shove  
This must be love  
She's too tough  
  
Yeah she's too tough  
Well I don't believe  
I'd ever leave her, never leave her  
She's too tough, she's too tough
