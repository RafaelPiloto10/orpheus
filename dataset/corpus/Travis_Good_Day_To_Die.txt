Where is your mother,  
Where is your father,  
Two little children,  
Locked in the cupboard,  
Into the wide world,  
High on the high wire  
  
What would you give to fly away,  
Away, away, away, away,  
Girl with the flower,  
Boy with the hammer,  
Lost in a forest,  
On another planet,  
Find me the exit,  
Find them the way home  
  
Find all the love they took away,  
Away, away, away, away,  
'Cause your head is a brick wall,  
And your heart is a football,  
And your eyes broken windows,  
When you cry,  
It's a good day to die  
  
And your head is a brick wall,  
And your heart is a football,  
And your eyes broken windows,  
When you cry it's a good day  
  
'Cause your head is a brick wall,  
And your heart is a football,  
And your eyes,  
It's a good day to die,  
To die,  
To die,  
To die
