Look at me,  
I will never pass for a perfect bride,  
Or a perfect daughter.  
Can it be, I'm not meant to play this part.  
Now I see,  
That if I were truly to be myself, I would break my family's heart  
  
Who is that girl I see  
Staring straight, back at me  
Why is my reflection someone I don't know  
Somehow I cannot hide, who I am  
Though I've tried.  
When will my reflection show who I am inside.  
  
When will my reflection show who I am inside.
