Now blue ain't the word for the way that I feel  
And a storm is brewing in this heart of mine  
This ain't no crazy dream I know that's it real  
You're someone else's love now, you're not mine  
  
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new  
But my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine  
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed  
That's why I'm lonely all the time  
  
Please take these treasured dreams I had for you and me  
And take all the love I thought was mine  
Someday my crazy arms will hold somebody new  
But right now I'm so lonesome I could die  
  
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new  
But my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine  
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed  
You're someone else's love now, you're not mine  
Well you're someone else's love now, you're not mine
