How would you feel, if I took you away  
To a place I know, a place where we could stay  
Called Joppa Road, a pretty place I know  
Where we can go, called Joppa Road  
  
The things I feel on Joppa Road  
Can make me stay, and make me go  
This old road where I long to go  
Called Joppa Road, where we can go  
  
Put your best dress on, there's a place I know  
Where we can go, called Joppa Road  
It's a little ways where the sun shines down  
Where we drive real slow, on Joppa Road

Where we can go, called Joppa Road  
  
Hey, yo bro, that's a dude I know  
Works on Joppa Road, at the Sunoco  
If we drive by slow, with the top down low  
We'll heel and toe on Joppa Road  
  
How would you feel, if I took you away  
To a place I know, a place where we could stay  
Called Joppa Road, a pretty place I know
