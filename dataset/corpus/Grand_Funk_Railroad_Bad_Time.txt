I'm in love with a girl that I'm talking about  
I'm in love with a girl I can't live without  
I'm in love but I sure picked a bad time  
To be in love, to be in love  
  
Well, let her be someone else's queen  
I don't want to know about it  
There's too many others that know what I mean  
And that's why I've got to live without it  
I'm in love with a girl I'm talking about  
I'm in love with a girl I can't live without  
I'm in love but I feel like I'm wearing it out  
I'm in love but I must have picked a bad time to be in love  
A bad time to be in love, a bad time to be in love  
A bad time to be in love  
  
Well, the stories crawling back to me  
From my friends and the people that I want to see  
The things they say I know just couldn't be true  
At least not until I hear it from you  
'Cause I still the little girl, I'm talking about  
I'm in love with a girl I can't live without  
I'm in love but I feel like I'm wearing it out  
I'm in love but I must have picked a bad time to be in love  
A bad time to be in love, a bad time to be in love  
  
You know that I love the little girl I'm talking about  
I'm in love with a girl I can't live without  
I'm in love but it feels like I'm wearing it out  
I'm in love but I must have picked a bad time to be in love  
A bad time to be in love, a bad time to be in love  
A bad time to be in love
