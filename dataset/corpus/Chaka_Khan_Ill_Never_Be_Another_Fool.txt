I'll never open my legs again  
To a man who's insecure  
I'll never open my legs again  
Unless I'm really sure  
  
No, I'll never, never  
Never be another fool  
  
Sad but true, I slept with you  
I thought we were in love  
I even got me a rose tattoo  
But that was not enough  
  
No, I'll never, never  
Never be another fool  
  
Never, no  
Never, never, never  
  
Nothing but the best of me  
I gave with open arms  
Alive and well, I'm back from hell  
Released from your charms  
(It's time to go)  
  
Scene 23, exit, fade to black  
Tell me, why'd you have to come back?  
  
This love you need to fade  
Leave the best to yesterday  
If this only one thing is true  
I ain't gonna be another fool  
  
Never be another fool  
  
You think about callin'? Don't
