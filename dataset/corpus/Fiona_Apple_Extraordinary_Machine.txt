I certainly haven't been shopping for any new shoes,  
And I certainly haven't been spreading myself around.  
I still only travel by foot and by foot it's a slow climb.  
But, I'm good at being uncomfortable,  
So I can't stop changing all the time.  
  
I noticed that my opponent is always on the go,  
And won't go slow so as not to focus and I notice.  
You're trying with any guy as long as they go fast,  
From whence he came.  
But, he's no good at being uncomfortable,  
So he can't staying exactly the same.  
  
If there was a better way to go, then it would find me.  
I can't help it the road just rolls out behind me.  
Be kind to me, or treat me mean.  
I'll make the most of it,  
I'm an extraordinary machine.  
  
I sing to you to seek a new disaster every day.  
You deem me duped to clean my view and be at peace and lay.  
I'm in the loop, I'm into moving my own way.  
And say I've been getting along for long before you came into the play.  
I am the baby of the family, it happened so  
Everybody came and wears the sheep's clothes while they chaperone.  
Curious, you're looking down your nose at me while you appease,  
Courteous to try and help but let me set your mind at ease.  
  
If there was a better way to go, then it would find me.  
I can't help it the road just rolls out behind me.  
Be kind to me, or treat me mean.  
I'll make the most of it,  
I'm an extraordinary machine.  
  
Do I so worry you?  
No need to hurry to my side.  
That's very kind,  
But it's to no avail,  
I don't want the veil,  
Everything will be just fine.  
  
If there was a better way to go, then it would find me.  
I can't help it the road just rolls out behind me.  
Be kind to me, or treat me mean.  
I'll make the most of it,  
I'm an extraordinary machine.  
  
If there was a better way to go, then it would find me.  
I can't help it the road just rolls out behind me.  
Be kind to me, or treat me mean.  
I'll make the most of it,  
I'm an extraordinary machine.
