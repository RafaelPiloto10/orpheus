Well, I met this old woman  
She was hard as nails  
I think that she just come out  
Of the County jail  
  
But I loaned her some money  
Just to pay her rent  
If I would, she would put me  
In her last will and testament  
  
Well, I got lots of children  
An ex-wife or two  
I never hear from them  
Till the bills are due  
  
The money I gave her  
They already spent  
If I could just help 'em out  
They would put me in their last will and testament  
  
You know I'm goin' over sixty  
I'm older than most  
It won't be long now  
I'll be nothin' but a ghost  
  
My intentions  
It's my intent  
To live on a little deeper  
Havin' my last will and testament  
  
And when it's all over  
They put you in the ground  
Send my belongings  
To the 'Lost And Found'  
  
My intent  
To leave all the little people  
Out of my last will and testament
