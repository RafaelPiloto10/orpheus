Can't I cry a little bit?  
There's nobody to notice it  
Can't I cry if I want to?  
No-one cares  
  
Why can't I pretend  
That you'll love me again?  
All I had has been taken from me  
Now I cry tears that never become me  
  
Just one smile means forgiving  
Just one kiss, the hurt's all gone  
Just one smile to make my life worth living  
A little dream to build my world upon  
  
How I wish I could say  
All the things I want to say  
If some way, you could see what's in my heart  
Oh, baby  
  
I don't ask for much  
A look, a smile, a touch  
Try to forget  
Lord knows, I'm trying  
It's so hard to forget  
When your whole world you know is dying  
  
Just one smile means forgiving  
Just one kiss, the hurt's all gone  
Just one smile to make my life worth living  
A little dream to build my world upon  
  
Just one smile please forgiving  
Just one kiss, hurt's all gone  
Just one smile to make my life worth living  
A little dream to build my world upon  
Just one smile
