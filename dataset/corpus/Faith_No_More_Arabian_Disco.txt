Has it been so long?  
Do you think we know?  
Do you think we care?  
Die, for the here and now  
Do you remember why?  
Do you remember how?  
  
Face, out  
Stick your chest, out  
Stomach, in  
That's right  
  
Do you really know  
Where the harems go  
In the desert snow? Hail,  
An oasis dream doesn't really seem  
To mean a thing when you're out, cold  
  
So, hands, up  
Put your guards, up  
Feet, down  
Up, down  
Forward, march  
Left, right  
Cold, cold  
I feel cold
