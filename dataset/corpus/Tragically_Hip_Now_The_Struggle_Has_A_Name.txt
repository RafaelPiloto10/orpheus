Now, the apology done  
Applause can begin  
Now, the apologies done  
Applause begins  
  
If it bleeds it leads  
If it cries it flies  
If it feeds a need  
If it dies, it dies  
  
Now the struggle has a name  
It doesn't fade, it hasn't changed  
I still feel the same  
Now the struggle has a name  
  
And Honey Watson  
I struggle on  
  
Oh, Honey Watson  
We were born with sin  
Some truth, some reconciliation  
And gone with the wind  
  
If it feeds the need  
If it dies, it dies  
  
Now the struggle has a name  
We are the same, it hasn't changed  
I still feel the same  
Now the struggle has a name  
  
Honey Watson  
I struggle on  
  
Gone, like an attraction  
Like the sun in a mirror  
Gone, like it was destined  
To simply disappear  
  
Gone, like Honey Watson  
Applause can begin  
The song is almost done  
Applause begins  
  
Now the struggle has a name  
It doesn't fade, it hasn't changed  
I still feel the same  
Now the struggle has a name  
  
Now the struggle has a name  
We are the same, it hasn't changed  
I still feel the same  
Now the struggle has a name  
  
And Honey Watson  
I struggle on
