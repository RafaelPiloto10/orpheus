How many bullets can your back hold, suckin' from the H-K  
The red dot's on your dome, from the light ray  
Boom bam bust oh shit kid, your head is a pile of puss  
I'm kickin' up much dust, the nigga ya can't trust  
This is my shit, my hood, my turf  
My gold, my grip, whatever the fuck it's worth  
I don't need nobody comin' in my territory  
tryin' to rip a nigga off and fuck your fuckin' sob stories  
  
Take a good look at my motherfuckin' jacker  
About to feel the wrath, of a greedy ass cracker  
Pale as snow, so you know the hoe stand out  
Comin' in my hood with his hand out  
Tryin' to get over on the black, but the motherfuckin' mack  
will put a fuckin' slug in his back  
And with the boom ping ping, it ain't no thing to blast  
on greedy motherfuckers that trespass  
  
[Chorus]  
Olly olly outcome free, here come the G  
I'm saggin', and Enter the Dragon like Bruce Lee  
I gots to get mo' money mo' money  
Can't get pussy with no money  
See I'm kind of greedy, cause all my heroes  
got zeroes in back of a one  
Here's my gun, about to get paid at last  
But now I'm gettin' covered, in dirt and grass, kick it  
  
The madder I get, the higher the debt, the deeper you get  
The thicker the sweat  
Cause I'm a nigga with fat clout  
But ya in, but ya gotta get back out  
No easy job, for some suckers is out to rob  
Cross hair on your dome and your mind's blown  
You want to go home, ain't that a bitch?  
Cube, dig the ditch (yep)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I got a full time job of takin' suckers out  
Breakin' 'em off, yea word, I love revokin' clout  
Test me, stress me, who could the best be?  
The Teflon nine go through vests G  
But when you're greedy you don't care about life itself  
You're chasin' extreme wealth  
You can't be trusted cause trust ain't in the fuckin' game  
Scandalous is your fuckin name  
  
I'm the motherfucker you're stuck wit  
Ice Cube "Wrong nigga to fuck wit!"  
I'm rich, pitchin' a bitch about gettin' mo'  
The big fish, swimmin' in big dough  
The G backstabber, I got ta have a  
Lexus Coupe, when I troop  
with the ski mask, gotta get the cash  
My homeboy ain't home, so fuck it I'll trespass
