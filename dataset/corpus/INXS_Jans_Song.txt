There's Jan calling from the rooftops  
She says she wants to world to hear  
Her peoples needs their basic rights  
  
She shouts I'll make you understand  
What it is we're striving for  
A better deal across this land  
  
She puts her hat on  
Looks in the mirror  
Says to herself  
You've nothing to fear  
  
Her friends won't argue  
Her friends don't care  
Now is the moment to get out of here  
  
Jan's friends they're marching in the streets  
The anger in their hearts  
Provides a steady beat  
On an on an on an on  
  
Generosity  
Noble word to me  
Our democracy  
Noble words to me
