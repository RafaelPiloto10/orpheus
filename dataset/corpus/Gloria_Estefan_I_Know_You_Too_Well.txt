Baby, it's nothing that you've said  
But I know it's not just in my head  
You're changing, baby, and you don't think I see  
I feel you drifting away, a little bit further every day  
Don't tell me, baby, don't tell me it's just me  
I see it in the look that's on your face  
Something's not the same inside  
You can't keep it from me, no matter how you try  
'Cause I know you too well, for you to ever think  
You could tell me a lie, yes, I know you too well  
No one knows you like I do and it's so easy to tell  
When you look away, there's something you're hiding  
I know you too well, too well  
Maybe the timing isn't right  
Maybe I see the end in sight  
Is it over baby, is it hurting you to stay?  
Maybe you don't know what to do  
You can't find a way to break the news  
Think it over, baby, it hurts me more this way  
I'd rather have you tell me to my face  
Than tell me every thing's all right  
What you don't wanna say is there in black and white  
'Cause I know you too well, for you to ever think  
You could tell me a lie, yes, I know you too well  
No one knows you like I do and it's so easy to tell  
When you look away, there's something you're hiding  
I know you, too well, too well  
I'd rather have you tell me to my face  
Than tell me every thing's all right  
What you don't wanna say is there in black and white  
'Cause I know you too well, for you to ever think  
You could tell me a lie, yes, I know you too well  
No one knows you like I do and it's so easy to tell  
When you look away, there's something you're hiding  
I know you, too well, too well, know you  
'Cause I know you too well, for you to ever think  
You could tell me a lie, yes, I know you too well  
No one knows you like I do and it's so easy to tell  
When you look away, there's something you're hiding  
I know you, too well, too well
