Played a wedding for the money and I wish I could have told the bride and
groom  
Just what I think of marriage, what's in store after the honeymoon.  
I was rumbling through the verses about how men and women ought to live apart,  
How a promise never made could not be broken and would never break a heart.  
  
Suddenly from out of nowhere this little girl came spinning across the floor  
Her crinolines were billowing beneath the skirt of calico she wore.  
As her joy fell on the honored guests each one of them was drawn into her
dream  
And they laughed and stamped and clapped their hands and hollered at her,
dance little jean!  
  
They said:  
Dance little jean, this day is for you,  
Two people that you love stood up to say 'i do.'  
Dance little jean, the prayer that you had was answered today-  
Your momma's marrying your dad.  
  
Well this cynic's heart just melted as I figured what this get together meant  
And how it ended years of tears and sad confusions that the little girl had
spent.  
They told the band to pack it up about the time the couple cut the cake  
But we stayed and we played all night long for love and laughs and little
jeanie's sake  
  
We played:  
Dance little jean, this day is for you,  
Two people that you love stood up to say 'i do.'  
Dance little jean, the prayer that you had was answered today-  
Your momma's marrying your dad.  
  
We sang:  
Dance little jean, this day is for you,  
Two people that you love stood up to say 'i do.'  
Dance little jean, the prayer that you had was answered today-  
Your momma's marrying your dad.
