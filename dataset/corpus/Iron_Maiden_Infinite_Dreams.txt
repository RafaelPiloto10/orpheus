Infinite dreams I can't deny them  
Infinity is hard to comprehend  
I couldn't hear those screams  
Even in my wildest dreams  
  
Suffocation waking in a sweat  
Scared to fall asleep again  
Incase the dream begins again  
Someone chasing I cannot move  
Standing rigid nightmare's statue  
What a dream when will it end  
And will I transcend?  
  
Restless sleep the minds in turmoil  
One nightmare ends another fertile  
Getting to me so scared to sleep  
But scared to wake now, in too deep  
  
Even though its reached new heights  
I rather like the restless nights  
It makes me wonder it makes me think  
There's more to this I'm on the brink  
It's not the fear of what's beyond  
It's just that I might not respond  
I have an interest almost craving  
But would I like to get too far in?  
  
It can't be all coincidence  
Too many things are evident  
You tell me you're an unbeliever  
Spiritualist? well me I'm neither  
But wouldn't you like to know the truth  
Of what's out there to have the proof  
And find out just which side you're on  
Where would you end in Heaven or in Hell?  
  
Help me, help me to find my true  
Self without seeing the future  
Save me, save me from torturing  
Myself even within my dreams  
  
There's got to be  
More to it than this  
Or tell me why do we exist  
I'd like to think that when I die  
I'd get a chance another time  
And to return and live again  
Reincarnate, play the game  
Again and again and again and again
