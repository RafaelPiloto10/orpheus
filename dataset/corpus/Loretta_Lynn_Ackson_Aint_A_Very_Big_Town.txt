Tonight at night we get married my friends all say it's a shame and disgrace  
And he's loved every woman in Jackson oh but Jackson ain't a very big place  
Tomorrow we'll go walkin' I count each one with a tear on her face  
Then I'll know just how many think I'm lucky cause Jackson ain't a very big
place  
Jackson is a mighty small town where the gossips and the rumors go round  
But the gossips are the ones he turned down and Jackson ain't a very big town  
[ steel ]  
Jackson is a mighty small town...
