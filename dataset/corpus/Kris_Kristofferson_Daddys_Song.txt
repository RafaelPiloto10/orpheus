I got a day without nothing to do  
And a "do not disturb" on my door  
I sorta looked for some mess that she'd made  
Or her sweet little socks on the floor  
But all that she left here was too many rooms  
And just enough silence to break  
And I can't look at her picture right now  
Time's about all I can take.  
Last night I sewed up her toys that were torn  
And packed her suitcase again  
She looked so sweet as she lay there asleep  
Smiling and holding my hand  
We didn't talk all the way to the plane  
But she's too big now to cry  
Then when I kissed her, she held me so tight  
I couldn't tell her goodbye.  
Chorus:  
She said, "I wish that we lived together again  
It gets so lonesome apart  
I'm missing somebody all of the time  
Daddy, it's breaking my heart"  
It's not so bad out here living alone  
Comfort's a stranger away  
And there's a freedom you find on your own  
That's nearly worth what you pay  
It's just a shame she still wants us to be  
All that we seemed to before  
But we can't blame her for making believe  
Something we don't anymore.  
Chorus:  
She said, "I wish that we lived together again  
It gets so lonesome apart  
I'm missing somebody all of the time  
Daddy, it's breaking my heart"
