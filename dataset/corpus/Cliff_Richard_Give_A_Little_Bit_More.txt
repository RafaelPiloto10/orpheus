Well i can see - that you weren't givin' enough  
That you weren't givin' as much as me  
With all your small talk - bendin' the rules  
Are you runnin' before you can walk  
I've got the feelin' you've been runnin' around  
You've gone and left behind the feelin' we'd found  
Too much too soon too much too soon  
Too much too soon  
  
Well can you get excited by what you see  
You've been takin' my love  
You should be giving it back to me  
Give a little bit of love like you did before  
Give a little bit more (give a little bit more)  
Give a little bit more (like you did before)  
Give a little bit more  
  
In a photograph you didn't put me in the picture  
My lovin' just made you laugh i was wide eyed  
Taken right in i can't understand why you lied  
I've got the feelin' you've been runnin' around  
You've gone and left behind the feelin' we'd found  
Too much too soon too much too soon  
Too much too soon  
  
Well can you get excited by what you see  
You've been taking my love  
You should be giving it back to me  
Give a little bit of love like you did before  
Give a little bit more (give a little bit more)  
Give a little bit more (like you did before)  
Give a little bit more  
-solo-  
I've got the feelin' you've been runnin' around  
You've gone and left behind the feelin' we'd found  
Too much too soon too much too soon  
Too much too soon  
  
Key change  
Well can you get excited by what you see  
You've been taking my love  
You should be giving it back to me  
Give a little bit of love like you did before  
Give a little bit more (give a little bit more)  
Give a little bit more  
(like you did before)  
Give a little bit more
