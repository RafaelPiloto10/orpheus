Oh, oh  
Yeah, yeah yeah  
  
How can I refuse your body laying next to me  
I wanna know if you see the same thing that I see  
Listen baby  
Laying right here in your bed is where I wanna be  
Making love to your body with your body on top of me  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, how I wanna love you babe  
Just like this, just like this  
Oh, how I wanna touch you babe  
Just like this, just like this  
Oh, how I wanna feel you babe  
Just like this, just like this  
Oh, how I wanna love you babe  
Just like this, just like this  
  
I wanna try something new baby  
That we never tried before  
I wanna do something to you babe  
Wait a minute, come back here on the floor  
Oh tell me how do you like Mr. Bigg's cashmere rug baby  
Does it feel good to your body baby  
Make you feel right  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, keep on pushing babe  
Don't stop now  
Slow it down  
Make it go round and round  
And round and round and round  
It's time to go down  
Don't stop what you doing babe cuz  
I'm going down  
  
[Chorus]
