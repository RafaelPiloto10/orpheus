He's a devil, Mama, he's a lover  
And I know that I should run for cover  
He's a looker and, Mama, he's lookin' at me  
  
Well, I know he's a real heart breaker  
A great pretender and a real love faker  
But I'm gonna bring him to his knees  
  
[Chorus]  
I can read your mind by the words that you don't say  
You think I'm thrown' my young love away  
Well, I was already gone when he called me today  
We're gonna meet at the Blue Nun Cafe  
  
Well, the lights are low and it's kinda hazy  
The music's loud and it's kinda crazy  
But on Saturday night it's the place to be  
  
Well, I'll be there and I'll be his baby  
And I'll remember how to be a lady  
So, Mama, don't you worry about me  
  
[Chorus]
