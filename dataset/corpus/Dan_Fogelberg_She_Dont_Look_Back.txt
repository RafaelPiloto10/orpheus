She's got a way of getting so inside you  
That you think she's gonna steal your soul  
She's got a way of making sure that you can't let go.  
She's got a trail of broken hearts behind her  
Like a shadow where no shadow's cast  
I ain't the first one and I doubt that I'll be the last.  
Too long--too late  
You're wrong  
To ever think she'd wait.  
  
She don't look back.  
She don't look back.  
The lady don't look back  
  
And when she's gone she's gone.  
You can never tell just what she's after  
You can never read it in her eyes  
And in her laughter there's no hint of compromise.  
You can stare into the fire forever  
You can squeeze a stone until it bleeds  
But you will never find the kind of love she needs.  
Too much--too late  
You're such a fool to think she'd wait.  
  
She don't look back.  
She don't look back.  
The lady don't look back  
  
She don't look back.  
She don't look back.  
The lady don't look back
