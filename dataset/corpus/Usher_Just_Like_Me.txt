Huh, what what  
You got it goin' on (what what)  
Huh, wha wha  
You got it goin' on (what what, come on)  
  
Strictly fuck with those six digit niggaz  
If the first one is a nine, they a buck behind  
I live my rhyme, at the same time  
Can't find myself layin' up, if you ain't payin' up  
  
Bullets start sprayin' up, you know my niggaz is sick  
The game ain't enough for you to run up in this  
I need stacks of chips, you know dream house money  
Shit, you just like me  
So don't start actin' funny  
  
You're the kind of girl that makes  
Everybody feel that you're just so damn good, so damn good  
But your secrets I found out  
So don't deny what you're about  
I know the truth and you know I do, I do, cuz  
  
I know you get lonely  
Just like me  
And you want it  
Just like me  
But act like you don't  
And you know you're just like me  
  
I know you get lonely  
Just like me  
And you want it  
Just like me  
But act like you don't  
And you know you're just like me  
  
Quiet as kept, you cry out for help  
When no one else is there I bet you touch yourself  
Does it feel good?  
Late night calls, I bet you do it all  
Anything to get it off but you still persist to front on me  
Baby tell me  
  
Why do we play this game of chase  
When you know we both feel the same way  
And why do you put me through all these changes  
When you know you're just a freak like me (you're just like me)  
  
If I had one wish in the world, I swear to God  
It would be for girls to rock pearls, straight out the oyster  
Voice yo' opinion, Queen B made a million  
Got mirrors on my ceiling, so I can see it  
  
When yo' head be in between it, if I had a penis  
I'd be heartless for real though, niggaz start shit  
I'd just flash out my dildo, ya'll move too quick  
Thought I'd be mesmorized by ya cocaine bricks  
  
And ya smoke gray six, nigga I thought you was a groupie  
Obsessed fan with my picture in ya hooptie-doo  
Heard my record now ya know I'm freaky  
So ya wanna wreck it and ya wanna see me  
  
How your dreams be, you want me sexual  
In a gun fight, two on three  
I'm next to pull, and I love life  
Something you never could imagine, then you woke the fuck up  
It's just rappin' (ahhh)  
  
I know you get lonely  
Just like me  
And you want it  
Just like me  
But act like you don't  
And you know you're just like me  
  
Just like me  
Just like me  
Just like me  
Come on  
Just like me  
Put your hands together  
Just like me
