The folks - they just can't take no more  
Throw you in the back seat, slam the door  
No stoppin' as down the road you go  
Got not time to lose  
  
Gigantic one-way gate ahead  
You're thinkin', man, I'd as soon be dead  
They decided to give you life instead  
The sanitarium blues  
  
Big ol' nurse all dressed in white  
Slaps you on a table in the middle of the night  
Then he straps you down real tight  
You're wonderin', what'd I do?  
  
They hose you down, make sure you're clean  
Wrap you up in hospital green  
Shoot you full of Thorazine  
The sanitarium blues  
  
Could be TB or maybe a tumor  
Eavesdropping on the doctors, listening to the rumors  
Can't see your friends, hear the hum of the wheels  
Hey, my man, you know how it feels  
Like the sanitarium blues  
  
Then upon some sunlit day  
They figure there's no need for you to stay  
They're pretty sure you can't be cured  
So they send you on your merry way  
  
You hit the pavement, hang around  
Nobody's on the outside to be found  
You're just tryin' to stay above the ground  
You start to thinkin', what's the use?  
The sanitarium blues
