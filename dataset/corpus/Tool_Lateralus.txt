Black then white are all I see in my infancy.  
Red and yellow then came to be, reaching out to me.  
Lets me see.  
As below, so above and beyond, I imagine  
Drawn beyond the lines of reason.  
Push the envelope. Watch it bend.  
  
Over thinking, over analyzing separates the body from the mind.  
Withering my intuition, missing opportunities and I must  
Feed my will to feel my moment drawing way outside the lines.  
  
Black then white are all I see in my infancy.  
Red and yellow then came to be, reaching out to me.  
Lets me see there is so much more  
And beckons me to look through to these infinite possibilities.  
As below, so above and beyond, I imagine  
Drawn outside the lines of reason.  
Push the envelope. Watch it bend.  
  
Over thinking, over analyzing separates the body from the mind.  
Withering my intuition leaving all these opportunities behind.  
  
Feed my will to feel this moment urging me to cross the line.  
Reaching out to embrace the random.  
Reaching out to embrace whatever may come.  
  
I embrace my desire to  
Feel the rhythm, to feel connected  
Enough to step aside and weep like a widow  
To feel inspired, to fathom the power,  
To witness the beauty, to bathe in the fountain,  
To swing on the spiral  
Of our divinity and still be a human.  
  
With my feet upon the ground I lose myself  
Between the sounds and open wide to suck it in,  
I feel it move across my skin.  
I'm reaching up and reaching out,  
I'm reaching for the random or what ever will bewilder me.  
And following our will and wind we may just go where no one's been.  
We'll ride the spiral to the end and may just go where no one's been.  
  
Spiral out. Keep going, going
