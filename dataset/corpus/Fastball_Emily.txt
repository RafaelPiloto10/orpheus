Emily shrugs and drags her heels as she takes the guided tour  
It seemed like such an amazing deal  
When she was looking at the brochure  
  
Stuck on a bus with strangers  
Wishing she could be ay home  
With me poor little emily  
How does it feel to be free?  
  
Lyin' in bed  
The pain in my head  
From running around all day  
Tryin' to find what was rightfully mine  
But I ran out of things to say  
  
Runnin' around with strangers  
Wishing she could run away with me..  
Poor little emily,  
How does it feel to be free  
  
From familiar fingertips  
To a persecuted grip?  
From the pan into the fire  
Now a thread becomes a wire  
Under which you must crawl  
Through a ditch and over the wall  
  
Emily works her fingers  
Right down to her aching bones  
While my aching head's got me stuck  
In bed working on being alone  
  
Working around the clock  
Wishing she had worked it out with me  
Poor little emily  
How does it feel to be free?  
Poor little emily  
How does it feel to be free?  
Poor little emily  
How does it feel to be free?
