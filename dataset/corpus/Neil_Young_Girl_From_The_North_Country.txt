[Chorus:]  
If you're traveling in the north country fair  
Where the winds hits heavy on the borderline  
Remember me to one who lives there  
Cause she once was a true love of mine  
  
[Verse:]  
If you're goin' when the snowflakes storm  
When the rivers freeze and the summer ends  
Please see for me she has a coat so warm  
To keep her from the howling wind  
  
Please see for me if her hair hangs long  
If it rolls and flows all down her breasts  
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long  
That's the way I remember her best  
  
I'm a-wondering if she remembers me at all  
Many times I've often prayed  
In the darkness of my night  
In the brightness of my day  
  
[Chorus:]  
If you're traveling in the north country fair  
Where the winds hits heavy on the borderline  
Remember me to one who lives there  
Cause she once was a true love of mine
