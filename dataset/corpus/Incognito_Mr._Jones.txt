You've gotta be out of your mind  
If you think that I am the kind  
To sit around and wait  
Say you've got me all wrong  
If you think that I am gonna be here  
Should your plans not escalate  
  
Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones  
Didn't I give you so much more  
Was it all for nothing  
Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones  
I can't give you any more  
Was it all for nothing  
  
Well I know she's got you hypnotised  
Cos you're sitting right here next to me  
But your heart is not around  
I wished that I had you all wrong  
But I know that it's time to step aside  
Hitch another ride  
I still got my pride  
  
You must be losing your mind  
If you think that I am the kind  
To sit around and wait
