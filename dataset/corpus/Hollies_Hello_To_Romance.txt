She walked into the room just like a dream  
I was spellbound into silence  
Do you know the way it feels  
The rock'n'roll changed to a symphony  
Appearing just like magic  
But I knew that she was real  
Then something deep inside of me  
Said go ahead and try  
Ain't no use in holdin back  
Don't kiss the chance goodbye  
Hello to romance  
Is it goodbye to those one night stands  
Where you get what you want  
Such a crazy steal  
Hello to romance  
Hello to romance  
I walked across the room to say hello  
She raised her head and smiled at me  
I knew which way to go  
Once she spoke sweet music filled my ears  
For hours and hours and hours we talked  
Time seemed to disappear  
verse 2  
chorus  
When you see the chance to win romance  
Act before it slips away  
Don't wait until tomorrow  
To hear yourself say  
I should've done it yesterday  
Should've done it yesterday  
verse 2  
chorus
