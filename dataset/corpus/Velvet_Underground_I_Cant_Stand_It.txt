It's hard being a man  
Living in a garbage pail  
My landlady called me up, oh  
She tried to hit me with a mop  
  
I can't stand it any more more  
I can't stand it any more more, oh  
I can't stand it any more more  
  
But if baby would just come back, it'd be all right  
Yeah, if baby would just come back, it would be all right  
Come on, baby  
  
I live with thirteen dead cats  
A purple dog that wears spats  
They're all living out in the hall  
And I can't stand it any more  
  
I can't stand it any more more  
I can't stand it any more more  
I can't stand it any more more  
  
But if baby would just come back, it'd be all right  
Oh, if baby would just come back, it would be all right  
Be all right, now  
  
Come on, baby  
  
I'm tired of living all alone, yeah  
Nobody ever calls me on the phone  
But when things are getting better  
I just play my music louder  
  
I can't stand it any more more  
I can't stand it any more more  
I can't stand it any more more  
I can't stand it, I can't stand it  
I can't stand it, I can't stand it ...
