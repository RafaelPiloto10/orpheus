I can't run  
In your eyes there's no place left to hide  
You've seen my every mystery just show itself and die  
So I will fly before you  
And all is all to see  
  
Take my hand, understand, there're no more foolish dreams  
So many things we just can't share  
Are standing in between  
So I will fly before you  
And all is all to see  
  
I will always want you near in the shallow lights of day  
No-one else will share my nights is all that I can say  
And I will always want you  
But I will always fly like a seabird  
  
And I will always love you  
But I will always fly
