It comes from the depths  
Of a place unknown to the  
Keeper of dreams  
If it could then it would steal  
The sun and the moon from the sky  
Beware  
  
Human at sight, monster at heart  
Don't let it inside it could  
Tear you right apart  
  
No guilt, it feeds in plain sight  
Spirit Crusher  
Stay strong and hold on tight  
Spirit Crusher  
  
Speaking in killing words  
  
The vicious kind that crush and kill  
No mercy, its pleasure to taste  
The blood that it bled.  
  
When it's time to feed to fulfill  
The need to consume a breath  
Some will rise standing tall  
Breathing out all the breath from  
The voice of a soul.
