Your way  
No way  
Do it my way  
Or hit the highway  
Your way  
No way  
Do it my way  
Or hit the highway  
  
I respect your point of view  
You've got your thoughts  
I've got mine too  
But you'll be out of here  
If I don't hear the words I want to hear  
  
Your way  
No way  
You do it my way  
Or you can hit the highway  
  
I've watched you  
Backsliding  
Then there's trouble  
You, your always hiding  
  
Now if I was in your shoes  
I might look at me and think  
"There's a fool"  
But I'm not in your shoes  
And I don't have to play  
By your set of rules no no  
  
Your way  
Let me tell you that there's no way  
No way you do it my way  
Or you can hit the highway  
Hit it again  
  
Your way  
No way  
Do it my way  
Or hit the highway  
I'm stating, not negotiating  
You want more  
There's the door
