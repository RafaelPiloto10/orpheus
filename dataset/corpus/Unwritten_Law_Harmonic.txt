Well I'll see you around  
I don't want to stay and drown  
The drama got too thick  
Makes me sick  
And I don't want to talk about it  
I already thought about it  
Stripped down of my pride  
Well I shed them tears and dried these eyes  
  
It was fun at the start  
But maybe we're worlds apart  
Facing different ways  
Different plains  
And I don't want to drag it out and  
I just gotta get on out and  
Leave it all behind  
It's time so don't deny it  
  
I want to know  
Does it show on my face  
I'm sick of this place  
I want to move on  
Coz the feeling is gone yeah  
I want to see  
Is it me out the door  
I told you before  
I want to have fun and it's just begun  
  
I've seen the light  
Tried to talk about it  
If you were ever down for me  
Just stop  
And you'd see  
You know I'm right  
And it showed in your eyes  
What we had shared had run empty  
So let it be  
Let it be  
  
I want to know  
Does it show on my face  
I'm sick of this place  
I want to move on cause the feeling is gone yeah  
I want to see  
Is it me out the door  
I said it before  
I want to move on and it's just begun
