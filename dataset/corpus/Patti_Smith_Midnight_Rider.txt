Well, I got to run to keep from hiding  
And I'm bound to keep on riding  
And I have one more silver dollar  
But I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no  
Not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider  
And I don't own the clothes I'm wearing  
And the road goes on forever  
And I've got one more silver dollar  
But I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no  
Not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider  
And I've gone past the point of caring  
Some old bed I'll soon be sharing  
But I ain't got one more silver dollar  
But I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no  
Not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider  
But I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no  
Not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider  
But I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no  
Not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider  
Not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider  
Not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider
