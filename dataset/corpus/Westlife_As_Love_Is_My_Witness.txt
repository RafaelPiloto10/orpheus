Mark:  
Once in a lifetime  
You look in someone's eyes  
And it feels like the world stops turning at once  
That's what it felt like for me  
I knew knew right away this day would be  
Standing together, believing forever  
Is there in our reach  
Chorus (Mark)  
'cause love is my witness  
I swear  
I'll be with you till the end  
Nothing in tear this love apart  
I'll put my hand upon my heart  
This is the promise I'll make to you  
Whatever comes we'll see it through  
Nothing can break it  
This feeling's too strong  
'cause love is my witness  
Shane:  
We've both known sorrow  
We've known heartache  
When our dreams for tomorrow  
Seem so far away  
But that brought us closer - yeah  
It brought us together  
So that we'd know the real thing  
That's why I can yeah - ye-eh-yeah  
Chorus: (Shane)  
'cause love is my witness  
I swear  
I'll be with you till the end  
Nothing in tear this love apart  
I'll put my hand upon my heart  
This is the promise I'll make to you  
Whatever comes we'll see it through  
Nothing can break it  
This feeling's too strong  
'cause love is my witness  
I know whatever comes to be  
Together we'll face the mystery  
Here in my heart, deep in my soul  
Somehow I know, I know  
'cause love is my witness  
I swear  
I'll be with you till the end  
Nothing in tear this love apart  
I'll put my hand upon my heart  
This is the promise I'll make to you  
(This is the promise I'll make to you)  
Whatever comes we'll see it through  
Nothing can break it  
This feeling's too strong  
'cause love is my witness  
Nothing can break it  
This feeling's too strong  
'cause love is my witness
