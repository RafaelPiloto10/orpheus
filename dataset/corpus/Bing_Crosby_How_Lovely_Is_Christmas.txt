How lovely is Christmas  
With boughs in the hall  
When bells ringle jingle  
And friends come to call  
  
How lovely is Christmas  
With joy on the wing  
While under your window  
The carolers sing  
  
God rest ye, be merry  
Give peace while you may  
Remember the child  
Who was born on this day  
  
How lovely is Christmas  
With songs in the air  
A bright merry Christmas  
Dear friends everywhere
