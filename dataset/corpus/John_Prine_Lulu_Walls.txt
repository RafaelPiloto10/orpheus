One evening getting dark  
We first met at the park  
Just sitting by the fountain all alone  
I lifted up my hat  
And then began to chat  
She said she'd allow me to see her at her home  
Chorus:  
Such a star I've never seen  
She's as pretty as the queen  
She's as perfect as an angel from above  
If she'd only be my wife  
I'd live happy all me life  
With that aggravating beauty lulu walls.  
If she were only mine  
I'd build a house so fine  
And around it so many fences tall  
It would make me jealously  
To think that none but me  
Could gaze upon that beauty lulu walls.  
Repeat chorus:  
One evening getting late  
Well, I met her at the gate  
I asked her if she'd wed me in the fall  
But she only turned away  
And nothing would she say  
That aggravating beauty lulu walls.  
Repeat chorus:  
With that aggravating beauty lulu walls.
