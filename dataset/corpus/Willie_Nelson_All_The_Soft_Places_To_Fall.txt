Most of my lfe I've been runnin' around  
Playin' and havin' a ball  
And maybe I've been on a party too long  
These mem'ries are fond to recall  
You see we've got this thing  
About women smokin' and good alcohol  
Now I'm lookin' for a homelife  
And clean smellin' sheets  
And all the soft places to fall  
  
The women we've known have been many  
But they don't understand us at all  
Though we've spent many a long hours  
Hopin' some old love would call  
Surely somebody somewhere still wants us  
Or don't nobody wants us at all  
We're lookin' for a homelife  
And clean smellin' sheets  
And all the soft places to fall  
  
Most of our lives we've been outlaws  
Slept with our backs to the wall  
I'm a rambler I'm a seeker  
And we're gettin' weaker  
A whole lot more likely to fall  
We're tired of the rocks and brambles  
Those barbed wire fences and all  
We're lookin' for a homelife  
And clean smellin' sheets  
And all the soft places to fall  
  
Most of our lives we've been outlaws  
Slept with our backs to the wall  
I'm a rambler I'm a seeker  
And we're gettin' weaker  
A whole lot more likely to fall  
We're tired of the rocks and brambles  
Those barbed wire fences and all  
We're lookin' for a homelife  
And clean smellin' sheets  
And all the soft places to fall
