'tis the last rose of summer, left blooming all alone  
All her lovely companions are faded and gone.  
No flower of her kindred, no rose bud is nigh  
To reflect back her blushes and give sigh for sigh.  
  
I'll not leave thee, thou lone one! to pine on the stem  
Since the lovely are sleeping, go sleep thou with them  
'thus kindly I scatter thy leaves o'er the bed  
Where thy mates of the garden lie scentless and dead.  
  
So soon may I follow, when friendships decay  
And from love's shining circle the gems drop away  
When true hearts lie wither'd and fond ones are flown  
Oh! who would inhabit this bleak world alone!
