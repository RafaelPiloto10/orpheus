Check it out, so though  
No more, not this time, not again  
  
You told me everything would get along  
But everything is falling apart  
Now if you understand me don't get me wrong  
'cause there's something dark inside my heart  
  
Better get it off my back  
Get it on with the check  
Temptations and vibrations  
Keeps me falling  
What I need, yeah  
That's what I got  
  
Now boy we can keep it loud  
So please don't turn it out  
Whispers sweet, get mine  
Laying over the base-line  
  
Whatever it is, I'm no affraid  
To whoever listen to this  
I don't fear you  
To all your fellas  
Go back to your girlfriends  
Bounce it, twist it  
Better dip that thing!  
  
Better get it off my back  
Get it on with the check  
Temptations and vibrations  
Keeps me falling  
What I need, yeah  
That's what I got  
  
Better get it off my back  
Get it on with the check  
Temptations and vibrations  
Keeps me falling  
What I need, yeah  
That's what I got  
  
I have my satisfaction  
So I can live my life,  
On the right track  
  
Better get it off my back  
Get it on with the check  
Temptations and vibrations  
Keeps me falling  
What I need, yeah  
That's what I got
