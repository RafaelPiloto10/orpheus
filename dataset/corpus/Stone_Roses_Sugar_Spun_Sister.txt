Her hair  
Soft drifted snow  
Death white  
I'd like to know  
Why she hates  
All that she does  
But she gives  
It all that she's got  
Until the sky turns green  
The grass is several shades of blue  
Every member of parliament trips on glue  
Until the sky turns green  
And the grass is several shades of blue  
Every member of parliament trips on glue  
T takes all these things and all that time  
Till my sugar spun sister's happy  
With this love of mine  
It'll take all these things and oh much more  
I've paid  
For fifteen or more  
But my guts  
Can't take many more  
My hands are stuck  
To my jeans  
And she knows she knows  
What this must mean  
She wakes up with the sun  
She asked me what is all the fuss  
As she gave me more than she thought she should  
She wakes up with the sun  
I think what have I done  
As I gave her more than I thought I would, ohhh  
At takes all these things and all that time  
Till my sugar spun sister's happy  
With this love of mine  
Yeah yeah yeah  
The candy floss girl  
The sticky fingered boy  
Oh that sister of mine  
Yeah
