Sometimes I feel my life is going 'round in circles  
Beneath my eyes are bluish black  
There's nothing new, no one I want to talk to  
Nothing I want to think about, I got soul doubt  
  
I stick my head out of the window, it's closed  
Instead of air, I get glass stuck into my head  
The city's sounding I can't seem to stop the pounding  
Can't keep my thoughts from flying 'round  
Can't keep my thoughts from flying 'round  
Not sure what I'm thinking about, I got soul doubt  
  
A shameless display, wearing a smile full of pain  
A frameless Erte, a painting without a signature  
She's waiting for someone to save her  
As I pass her by I see Cinderella  
  
She doesn't fit into a slipper  
Like she fits in a bottle of liquor  
There's no one to take her away  
  
Her eyes meet mine, she sees right through me  
The question is asked, Whatcha' gonna do for me?  
I don't want nothin', just a connection  
I gotta know what she's all about  
Cause I know she's been there -  
Soul doubt  
  
I stick me head outside the window once again  
This time I see a thousand faces all too clear  
They wear the same expression, I've seen in my face  
So many times, I know exactly how they feel  
I know exactly how they feel  
I know just what they think about  
They've got soul doubt
