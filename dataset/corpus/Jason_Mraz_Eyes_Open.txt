Keep your eyes open as if  
Love could come a walkin as if  
Everything else is meaningless, meaningless  
And that's the way it oughta be  
Mysteries, especially she  
Oh everything else  
Is almost meaningless, meaningless  
Oh say  
Well I will always feel that way  
And if a time a change should come  
You'd remember my name  
Oh say  
Well I will always feel that way  
And if a time a change should come  
You'd remember my  
You'd remember my name  
  
Keep your eyes open as if  
Everyone's a poet as if  
Everything else is meaningless, meaningless  
And that's the way it oughta be, yea  
Mysteries, including me  
Oh well everything else  
Is almost meaningless, meaningless  
Oh yea, oh say  
Well I will always feel that way  
And if a time a change should come  
You'd remember my name  
Oh say  
Well I will always feel that way  
And if a time a change should come  
You'd remember my  
You'd remember my  
You'd remember my name  
  
To be a little bit advanced  
You gotta take a little bit of a second chance  
On life  
You gotta get on up and dance  
You better throw all your precious plans  
Better wave them goodbye  
A buh bye, buh bye, bye bye bye  
Ya gotta keep your eyes open  
As if everything else is just along  
Come along on it's way  
And that's the way it oughta be  
Well mysteries in everything  
Well I say, I say  
Well I, i will always feel that way  
And if a time a change should come  
You'd remember my name  
Oh say  
Well I will always feel that way  
And if a time a change should come  
You'd remember my  
You'd remember my  
You'd remember my name
