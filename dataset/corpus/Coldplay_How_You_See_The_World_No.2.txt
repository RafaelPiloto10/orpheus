Anything we should know about your change?  
They put the world in a tin can,  
Black market, contraband,  
And it hurt just a little bit, when they sliced and packaged it.  
In a long black trench coat,  
Two hands around the throat,  
Ooh you want to get it right sometimes  
  
There's so much to be scared of,  
And not much to make sense of,  
How did the clowns ever get control?  
If your hear can you let me know,  
How can they invade it, when it's so complicated?  
Ooh you just want to get it right sometimes  
You just want to get it right sometimes  
  
That's how you see the world,  
How many times can you say, you can't believe what you learn,  
That's how you see the world, don't you worry yourself,  
You're not gonna give up.  
  
And there's something missing, seems like there's nobody listening,  
If you're running in a circle, how can you be too careful?  
We don't wanna be man trapped, we don't wanna be shrink wrapped  
Ooh, we just want to get it right sometimes,  
Just want to get it right sometimes,  
  
That's how you see the world,  
How many times have you heard, but you can't believe a word,  
That's how you see the world, but don't you worry yourself,  
'Cause nobody can hurt you  
  
That's how you see the world  
That's how you see the world
