Josephina, there's so much I want to know  
I've known you for all of mine  
But not all of yours  
You're not a stranger  
No, nothing could be further  
I look back and I wonder  
What you were like, long before  
Josephina, if I asked you, would you tell me?  
The fact from the fancy  
And the dreams in between  
Tell me a story  
All about yours truly  
Photographs from the past  
Imagine the mystery  
  
Didja get your head lost in a daydream?  
Cinderella, waiting for her charming  
Did ya break a heart, like little girls often do?  
Pigtails and painted toes  
All dressed up in your mother's clothes  
Can you shine the light?  
Ah, can you shine the light?  
Oh, please can you shine some light?  
Yeah, can you shine the light?  
Shine the light on a shadow  
  
Josephina, would you lay down your defenses?  
So I can make sense of  
Those colors fading to grey  
It's not that you're hiding  
Something, I'd never imply  
Yesteryear I may be gone  
Can't say the same for today  
  
Yeah, Josephina!  
  
Ah, Josephina!  
  
How else am I to know, that all the while  
There was a mischievous look, behind that smile?  
It's hard to tell, when innocence comes and goes  
I'm sure that there were times, life could be unkind  
Without a shoulder to cry on  
Can you shine the light?  
Ah, can you shine the light?  
Yeah, please can you shine some light?  
Yeah, can you shine the light?  
Yeah, can you shine the light?  
Shine the light on a shadow  
  
(Ah-ah-ah)  
(Ah-ah-ah)  
(Ah-ah-ah)
