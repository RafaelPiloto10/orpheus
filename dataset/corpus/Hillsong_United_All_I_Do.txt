I wanted to find  
Where I was going  
Everything I tried  
It took me nowhere  
I was so tired of just living my life  
Waiting for a sign  
You came to my side  
Gave me direction  
Strong on the inside  
I shine for You Lord  
Now it's my time  
Now I've made up my mind  
To be all You want for me  
All I do  
Is live my life for You  
I know it's true  
I'll never let You go  
All I do  
I'd anything for You  
Everything is in Your Hands  
So I get up  
Get up and praise You  
And I know where I'm going  
I know where I'm going
