Blessing and honor,  
glory and power,  
be unto the Ancient of Days.  
From every nation,  
all of creation,  
bow before the Ancient of Days.  
  
CHORUS-  
Every tongue in heaven and earth,  
shall declare Your glory,  
every knee shall bow at Your throne,  
in worship.  
You will be exalted O God,  
and Your Kingdom shall not pass away.  
Oh Ancient of Days.  
  
BRIDGE-  
Your Kingdom shall reign over all the earth,  
sing unto the Ancient of Days.  
For none can compare to Your matchless worth,  
sing unto the Ancient of Days.
