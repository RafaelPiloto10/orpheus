Chorus:  
There's no song like a love song  
(love song)  
No love like true love  
(true love)  
No smile  
Like the smile of a child  
  
  
Be like a child  
Welcome each day one at a time  
Don't be a afraid  
(do be do do be do)  
To say you're sorry when you're wrong  
Be a better you  
Be like a child  
  
  
Be like a child  
Don't loose yourself in a world of cares  
Let yourself go  
(do be do do be do)  
Oh, be happy and be loved  
Be a better you  
Be like a child  
  
  
Chorus  
  
  
Be like a child  
Welcome each day...  
And, don't loose yourself...
