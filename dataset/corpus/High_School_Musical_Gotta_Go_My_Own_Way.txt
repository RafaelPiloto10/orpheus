Gabriella  
I gotta say what's on my mind  
Something about us  
Doesn't seem right these days  
Life keeps getting in the way  
Whenever we try, somehow the plan  
Is always rearranged  
  
It's so hard to say  
But I've gotta do what's best for me  
You'll be ok...  
  
I've got to move on and be who I am  
I just don't belong here  
I hope you understand  
We might find our place in this  
World someday  
But at least for now  
I gotta go my own way  
  
Don't wanna leave it all behind  
But I get my hopes up  
And I watch them fall everytime  
Another colour turns to grey  
And it's just too hard to watch it all  
Slowly fade away  
I'm leaving today 'cause I've  
Gotta do what's best for me  
You'll be ok...  
I've got to move on and be who I am  
I just don't belong here  
I hope you understand  
We might find our place in this  
World someday  
But at least for now  
I gotta go my own way  
  
Troy  
What about us?  
What about everything we've been through?  
  
Gabriella  
What about trust?  
  
Troy  
You know I never wanted to hurt you  
  
Gabriella  
And what about me?  
  
Troy  
What am I supposed to do?  
  
Gabriella  
I gotta leave but I'll miss you  
  
Troy  
I'll miss you  
  
Gabriella  
So  
I've got to move on and be who I am  
  
Troy  
Why do you have to go?  
  
Gabriella  
I just don't belong here  
I hope you understand  
  
Troy:  
I'm trying to understand  
  
Gabriella  
We might find our place in this  
World someday  
But at least for now  
  
Troy  
I want you to stay  
  
Gabriella  
I wanna go my own way  
I've got to move on and be who I am  
  
Troy  
What about us?  
  
Gabriella  
I just don't belong here  
I hope you understand  
  
Troy  
I'm trying to understand  
  
Gabriella  
We might find our place in this  
World someday  
But at least for now  
I gotta go my own way  
I gotta go my own way  
I gotta go my own way
