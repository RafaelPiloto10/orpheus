Druscilla Penny what a name.  
Are you sure you didn't make it up yourself.  
You're very pretty, yes you are, but with all the junk you wear it's hard to
tell.  
  
Man you must work hard to get your hair to look like that.  
I don't need a horoscope to tell me where you're at.  
Your family's probably given up on you  
Since you began to follow groups of long - haired rock and rollers.  
I can hear your mother crying for her daughter  
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah  
  
Druscilla Penny what a girl.  
Where's the purpose to the crazy life you lead.  
It doesn't matter after all you're so sure that instant love is all you tell.  
  
I've seen your face at least a thousand times,  
You're always standing there behind the stages at the concerts.  
Waiting for an offer to be with someone after.  
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah  
  
Druscilla Penny how's your head.  
Do you ever wake up lonely in the night.  
It isn't easy, for a girl when she can't decide if love is wrong or right.  
I hope I live to see a change.  
Could you ever really love, ever really care?  
Ever really get it together?  
No!
