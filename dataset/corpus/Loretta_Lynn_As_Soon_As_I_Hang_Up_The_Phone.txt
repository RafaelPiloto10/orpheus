Hello (hello Loretta) darlin' I knew it was you  
(Loretta there's something I just got to tell you)  
Oh please tell me what to do  
(I don't really know how to say this but I want to tell you that I)  
  
You gave me the will to go on as soon as I picked up the phone  
(No no you don't understand Loretta I'm trying to tell you that I)  
The talk is around that we're through (yeah I know I've heard it too)  
Oh darling tell me what to do  
  
(But that's just it that's what I'm trying to tell you I want to tell you
that)  
I knew you'd tell me they were wrong as soon as I picked up the phone  
(Oh but it's true they're not wrong)  
Oh no (I'm sorry Loretta) oh no I can't believe that it's true  
  
(I'm sorry Loretta I'm really really sorry)  
Oh no oh no I can't believe that we're through  
(I know you know that I never thought it would come to this)  
You tell me it's over and done  
  
(I really thought that I loved you and you know that)  
You say that you've had all your fun  
(You've just got to believe me that I never meant to hurt you)  
But I can't believe you've been gone  
  
(This is the hardest thing that I've ever had to do and it hurts me too)  
As soon as I hang up the phone (yeah I'll be gone)  
As soon as I hang up the phone (goodbye Loretta)
