You just can't smile it away  
It's much more than passion it's love  
And I've heard some people say  
They've seen love move mountains  
  
You just can't laugh it away  
It's too deep inside it's love  
Not just some game you can play  
For a laugh then go on your way  
  
Let's sit and talk it over  
And work it out I love you so  
And can't we just talk it over  
And see what we can do  
  
You can't just pass it away  
Like some silly fashion no it's love  
And love comes eager to stay  
It won't just leave you that way  
  
You can't just pass it away  
Like some silly fashion no it's love  
And I've heard some people say  
They've seen love move mountains no it's love  
And I've heard some people say  
They've seen love move mountains
