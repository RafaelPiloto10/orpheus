POGUES - LORELEI  
  
You told me tales of love and glory  
Same old sad songs, same old story  
The sirens sing no lullaby  
And no-one knows but Lorelei.  
  
By castles out of fairytales  
Timbers shivered where once there sailed  
The lovesick men who caught her eye  
And no-one knew but Lorelei.  
  
River, river have mercy  
Take me down to the sea  
For if I perish on these rocks  
My love no more I'll see...  
  
I've thought of you in far-off places  
I've puzzled over lipstick traces  
So help me god, I will not cry  
And then I think of Lorelei.  
  
I travel far and wander wide  
No photograph of you beside me  
Ol' man river's not so shy  
And he remembers Lorelei.  
  
River, river have mercy  
Take me down to the sea  
For if I perish on these rocks  
My love no more I'll see.  
  
If I should float upon this stream  
And see you in my madman's dream  
I'd sink into your troubled eyes  
And none would know 'cept Lorelei.  
  
River, river have mercy  
Take me down to the sea  
For if I perish on these rocks  
My love no more I'll see.  
  
But if my ship, which sails tomorrow  
Should crash against these rocks,  
My sorrows I will drown before I die  
It's you I'll see, not Lorelei
