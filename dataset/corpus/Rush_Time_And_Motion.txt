Time and motion  
Wind and sun and rain  
Days connect like boxcars in a train  
  
Fill them up with precious cargo  
Squeeze in all that you can find  
Spontaneous elation  
And the long-enduring kind  
  
Time and motion  
Flesh and blood and fire  
Lives connect in webs of gold and razor wire  
  
Spin a thread of precious contact  
Squeeze in all that you can find  
Spontaneous relations  
And the long-enduring kind  
  
The mighty ocean  
Dances with the moon  
The silent forest  
Echoes with the loon  
  
Time and motion  
Live and love and dream  
Eyes connect like interstellar beams  
  
Superman in super nature  
Needs all the comfort he can find  
Spontaneous emotion  
And the long enduring kind
