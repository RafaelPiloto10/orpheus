Fanny  
I often wonder why he came to me  
Brought such a flame to me  
Then let it die  
  
And if another love should find my heart  
It will remind my heart of your goodbye  
With every new love  
You'll come back to me  
  
In other eyes it's you I see  
If I love again  
Though it's someone new  
If I love again  
  
It will still be you  
In someone else's firm embrace  
I close my eyes but see your face  
If I love again  
I'll find another charms  
But I'll make believe  
  
You are in my arms  
And though my lips whisper "love me!"  
My heart will not be true  
I'll be loving you  
Every time i love again...
