Someone, I'm searching for someone  
Who'll be true, who'll change my life of blue  
Into a dream of golden rainbows, where are you?  
  
It seems I've been searching,  
Searching more than just one lifetime.  
My heart is a magnet all for you,  
I'll know you when I see you.  
Within my heart is carved  
A sculpture of your love.  
  
Life is worth less than nothing without love.  
Love is the force from which all beings live.  
Don't you see?  
It's the purpose of living to love  
And be loved again and again.  
Where are you?  
My heart cries for you.  
My eyes long to see you.  
My soul is all for you.  
Oh, where are you, someone?  
  
Don't you see?  
It's the purpose of living to love  
And be loved again and again.  
Where are you?  
My heart cries for you.  
My eyes long to see you.  
My soul is all for you.  
Oh, where are you, someone?
