Someday, you will seek me and find me  
Someday, of the days that shall be  
Oh, surely you will come and remind me  
Of a dream that is calling, for you and for me  
And someday, when the winter is over  
Someday, in the flush of the spring  
My soul shall discover  
The soul born for my lover  
The girl who can make me a king  
  
And someday, when the winter is over  
Someday, in the flush of the spring  
My soul shall discover  
The soul born for my lover  
The girl who can make me a king
