I can see in your eyes  
That you're tired of the talk  
You're tired of the lies  
Every time you let a day pass you by  
A part of you dies  
Yeah  
  
Take a chance, win or lose  
Don't ever give up on the life that you choose  
  
You've gotta hit 'em like a freight-train comin'  
You drop the pedal with the motor runnin'  
  
Right here right now  
Yesterday's gone, tomorrow's always in doubt  
Right here right now  
The only time that matters anyhow  
  
You were born, got it all  
The rest is all up to you  
You stand or you crawl  
Gotta chase to break  
And run with the fall  
Get up when you fall  
Yeah  
  
There's one thing (there's one thing)  
You can bet (you can bet)  
I'll give'em something  
That they'll never forget  
  
You've gotta hit 'em like a freight-train comin'  
You drop the pedal with the motor runnin'  
  
Right here, right now  
Yesterday's gone, tomorrow's always in doubt  
Right here, right now  
The only time, the only time  
That matters is now  
  
Live out every day  
Doing whatever's right for you  
Live out every day  
Any way that you dare  
Is anyone ready to fight for you?  
Hell yeah  
You're on your own  
Hell yeah  
But not alone  
Hell yeah  
Any way that you go  
  
Right here, right now  
Yesterday's gone, tomorrow's always in doubt  
Right here, right now  
The only time that matters anyhow  
Yeah  
Is right now
