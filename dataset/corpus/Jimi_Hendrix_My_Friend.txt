Hey, look out for my glass up there man!  
That's my drink man that's my drink alright  
Make it a double or eh  
Somebody has to sing  
Somebody will sing  
Somebody will sing right?  
I don't know  
  
Y'all pass me that bottle  
And I'll sing you all a real song  
Yeah!  
Let me get my key ahum  
  
Well I'm looking through Harlem  
My stomach squealed just a little more  
A stagecoach full of feathers and footprints  
Pulls up to my soap-box door  
Now a lady with a pearl-handled necktie  
Tied to the driver's fence  
Breathes in my face  
Bourbon and coke possessed words  
Haven't I seen you somewhere in hell  
Or was it just an accident?  
You know how I felt then  
And so a...  
  
Before I could ask was it the east or west side?  
My feet they howled in pain  
The wheels of a bandwagon cut very deep  
But not as deep in my mind as the rain  
And as they pulled away I could see her words  
Stagger and fallin' on my muddy tent  
Well I picked them up brushed them off  
To see what they said  
And you wouldn't believe  
'Come around to my room with the tooth in the middle  
And bring along the bottle and a president'  
  
And-eh sometimes it's not so easy, baby  
Especially when your only friend  
Talks sees looks and feels like you  
And you do just the same as him  
Gets very lonely out this road baby  
Yeah hmm yeah  
  
Got more to say  
  
Well I'm riding through L.A. ha  
On a bicycle built for fools  
And I seen one of my old buddies  
And he say 'you don't look the way you usually do'  
I say ' well some people look like a coin-box'  
He say 'look like you ain't got no coins to spare'  
And I laid back and I thought to myself, and I said this  
I just picked up my pride form underneath the pay phone  
And combed this breath right out of my hair  
And sometimes it's not so easy  
Especially when your only friend  
Talks sees looks and feels like you  
And you do just the same as him  
  
I just got out of a Scandinavian jail  
And I'm on my way straight home to you  
But I feel so dizzy I take a quick look in the mirror  
To make sure my friend's here with me too  
And you know good well I don't drink coffee  
So you fill my cup full of sand  
And the frozen tea leaves on the bottom  
Sharing lipstick around the broken edge  
And my coat that you let your dog lay by the fire on  
And your cat he attacks me from his pill-box ledge  
And I thought you were my friend too  
Man, my shadow comes in line before you  
I'm finding out that it's eh not so easy  
Specially when your only friend  
Talks, looks, sees, and feels like you  
And you do the same just like him  
  
Lord it's so lonely here hmm yeah  
Yeah!  
Pass me that bottle over there  
Yeah yeah o.k.
