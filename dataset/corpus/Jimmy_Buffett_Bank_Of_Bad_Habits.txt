Jimmy Buffett, Russ Kunkel, Jay Oliver, Roger Guth, and Peter Mayer  
THE RUMORS AND THE STORIES OF MY PAST I CAN'T DENY  
I'M NO ST. IGNATIUS BUT AGAIN I'M NO BAR FLY  
THE WRONG THING IS THE RIGHT THING UNTIL YOU LOSE CONTROL  
I GOT THIS BANK OF BAD HABITS IN A CORNER OF MY SOUL  
  
Chorus  
BANK OF BAD HABITS  
THE PRICE OF VICE FORETOLD  
ONE BY ONE THEY'LL DO YOU IN  
THEY'RE BOUND TO TAKE THEIR TOLL  
  
THE WRONG THING IS THE RIGHT THING  
UNTIL YOU LOSE CONTROL  
I GOT THIS BANK OF BAD HABITS  
IN A CORNER OF MY SOUL  
  
Verse 2  
LAST NIGHT I SAID GOOD BYE TO A DEAR OLD FRIEND OF MINE  
JUST A THROWBACK SHELL BEACH PARTY NOTHING REALLY ASININE  
RUM AND COOKED ANIMALS AND BULLSHIT BY THE TON  
THAT PARTY LASTED WAY TOO LONG AND I HAD TOO MUCH FUN  
  
Chorus  
BANK OF BAD HABITS  
THE PRICE OF VICE FORETOLD  
ONE BY ONE THEY'LL DO YOU IN  
THEY'RE BOUND TO TAKE THEIR TOLL  
  
THE WRONG THING IS THE RIGHT THING  
UNTIL YOU LOSE CONTROL  
I GOT THIS BANK OF BAD HABITS  
IN A CORNER OF MY SOUL  
THAT BANK OF BAD HABITS  
IT'S WORTH IT'S WEIGHT IN GOLD

Verse  
A PICTURE'S WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS JUST ASK A CAMERA MAN  
AND IT'S NO SIN TO STOP AND LOOK I DO IT WHEN I CAN  
BUT YOU HAVE TO PURGE THAT URGE TO MERGE

TROUBLE IS WHAT YOU WILL FIND INSIDE SOME STRANGER'S BED
