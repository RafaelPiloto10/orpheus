Every time I look down on, this timeless town  
Whether blue or gray be her skies  
Whether loud be her cheers or whether soft be her tears  
More and more do I realize that  
  
I love Paris in the spring time  
I love Paris in the fall  
I love Paris in the summer when it sizzles  
I love Paris in the winter when it drizzles  
  
I love Paris every moment  
Every moment of the year  
I love Paris  
Why, oh, why do I love Paris?  
Because my love is here
