Now I greet you from the other side of sorrow and despair, with a love so vast  
And so shattered, it will reach you everywhere.  
  
And I sing this for the captain whose ship has not been built, for the mother
in  
Confusion, her cradle still unfilled.  
  
For the heart with no companion, for the soul without a king. for the prima  
Ballerina who cannot dance to anything.  
  
Through the days of shame that are coming, through the nights of wild
distress,  
Though your promise count for nothing, you must keep it nonetheless.  
  
You must keep it for the captain whose ship has not been built. for the mother
in  
Confusion her cradle still unfilled.  
  
For the heart with no companion, for the soul without a king, for the prima  
Ballerina who cannot dance to anything.
