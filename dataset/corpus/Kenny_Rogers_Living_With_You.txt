You've been teaching me a lesson  
That I've never learned  
You never make it through a lifetime  
Without being burned  
Everything I ever thought you were  
You turned out to be  
Since you gave your love to me.  
  
When I met you on a Monday  
My life just stood still  
I belong in every moment  
That your love can fill  
Let me be the only heart you can mend  
Turn out the light and take it right to the end  
  
[Chorus]  
Living with you  
In the madness of my mind  
In a world I could not find  
But you knew what to do  
Living with you  
There's a full moon on the rise  
There?s a fire in your eyes  
And I was born to be.  
  
Loving you under my skin  
You?re everything to me  
I could not love you more  
And you know that you are mine  
And that?s what I?m living for  
  
There will never be a question  
Of somebody new  
I could make it through a lifetime  
With someone like you  
Let me be the only heart ?
