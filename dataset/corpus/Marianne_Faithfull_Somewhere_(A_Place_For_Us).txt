There's a place for us  
Somewhere a place for us  
Peace and quiet and open air  
Wait for us somewhere  
  
There's a time for us  
Some day a time for us  
Time together with time to spare  
Time to look, time to care  
Someday, somewhere  
  
We'll find a new way of living  
We'll find there's a way of forgiving  
Somewhere  
  
There's a place for us, a time and place for us  
Hold my hand and we're halfway there  
Hold my hand and I'll take you there  
Somehow, someday, somewhere  
  
We'll find a new way of living  
We'll find a way of forgiving  
Somewhere  
  
There's a time for us, a time and place for us  
Hold my hand and we're halfway there  
Hold my hand and I'll take you there  
Somehow, someday, somewhere, somewhere  
  
Somewhere
