Though folks with good intentions  
Tell me to save my tears  
Well I'm so mad about him  
I can't live without him  
  
Never treats me sweet and gentle  
The way he should  
I've got it bad  
And that ain't good  
  
My poor heart is so sentimental  
Not made of wood  
I've got it so bad  
And that ain't good  
  
But when the fish are jumpin'  
And Friday rolls around  
My man an' I, we gin some  
We pray some, and sin some  
  
He don't love me like I love him  
The way he should  
I've got it bad  
And that ain't good  
Yes I've got it bad  
And that ain't good
