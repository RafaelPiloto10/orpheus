In the country lies a meadow  
In the meadow stands a tree  
'Neath the tree flows a river  
But my fondest memory.  
  
Is the tree in the meadow  
With a stream drifting by  
And carved upon that tree  
I see "I'll Love You Till I Die".  
  
I will always remember the love  
In your eyes the day you carved  
Upon that tree "I'll Love You Till I Die".  
  
And farther on down lovers' lane  
A silhouette I see, I know you're  
Kissing someone else  
I wish that it were me.  
  
By the tree in the meadow  
My thoughts always lie  
And wherever you go  
You'll always know "I'll Love You Till I Die"...
