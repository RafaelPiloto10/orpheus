When the snowman brings us snow  
Well he just might like to know  
He's put a great big smile, on someone elses face  
If you jump into your bed  
Quickly cover up your head  
Don't you lock the doors  
You know that sweet Santa Claus in on the way  
  
Well I wish it could be Christmas, every day  
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play  
Oh, I wish it could be Christmas, every day  
Let the bells ring out for Christmas  
  
When we're skating in the park  
If the snow cloud makes it dark  
Then your rosy cheek's gonna light my merry way  
Now the frosty paws appear  
And they've frozen up my beard  
So we'll lie by the fire  
'Til the heat simply melts 'em all away  
  
Well I wish it could be Christmas, every day  
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play  
Oh, I wish it could be Christmas, every day  
So let the bells ring out for Christmas  
  
When the snowman brings the snow (when the snowman brings the snow)  
Well he just might like to know (well he just might like to know)  
He's put a great big smile on somebody's face  
So if Santa brings that sleigh (Santa brings that sleigh)  
All along the Milky Way (along the Milky Way)  
I'll sign my name on the rroftop in the snow  
Then he may decide to stay  
  
Well I wish it could be Christmas, every day  
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play  
Oo-oh, I wish it could be Christmas, every day  
So let the bells ring out for Christmas  
  
Okay you lot - take it!  
  
Well, I wish it could be Christmas, every day (Christmas day)  
When the kids start singing and the band begins to play (Oh-oh)  
Oh, I wish it could be Christmas, every day  
Let the bells ring out for Christmas  
  
Why don't you give your love for Christmas?
