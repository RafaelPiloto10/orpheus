I don't see me in your eyes anymore,  
oh why can't I make them shine as before?  
I don't see you or your heart in your kiss,  
when you should sigh that your mine, you resist!  
  
There was a time life was fine, love was ecstasy  
but now I doubt what the outcome will be!  
I pray you'll say I'm the one you adore  
then I'll see me in your eyes as before!  
  
I pray you'll say I'm the one you adore  
Then I'll see me in your eyes as before!
