If I'm not the one you want  
Take your time to figure out  
I'm staring at your picture every night  
The scent of you still lingers in my mind  
I wonder if you'll only feel alright  
And the sun has come out of the clouds  
And sometimes when I listen to our song  
The night seems so cold and far too long  
I want to call you up 'cause in the end  
I keep writing letters to my garbage can  
Lately it feels like I'm goin' crazy  
Baby come and lay down beside me  
If I'm not the one you want  
Who's he  
Take your time to figure out  
You'll see  
If I'm not the one you want  
Then maybe  
I'll be the one you need  
I feel like it's on you I can depend  
Wish I could turn back the hands of time  
Enough of building castles in the sand  
Why can't we be forever  
Lately it feels like I'm goin' crazy  
Baby come and lay down beside me  
If I'm not the one you want  
Then who's he  
Take your time to figure out  
You'll see  
If I'm not the one you want  
Then maybe  
I'll be the one you need  
If I'm not the one you want  
Then who's he  
Take your time to figure out  
You'll see  
If I'm not the one you want  
Then maybe  
I'll be the one you need  
  
Somewhere, in the back of my mind  
I know that you will be mine  
Somehow, I wish I could rewind  
Leave all the worries behind  
  
If I'm not the one you want, I'll be the one you need  
Take your time to figure out  
I'll be the one you need  
  
If I'm not the one you want  
Then who's he  
Take your time to figure out  
And you'll see  
If I'm not the one you want  
Then maybe  
I'll be the one you need  
  
I'll be the one you need
