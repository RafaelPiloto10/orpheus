Your poor witness  
Crying so loudly on the floor  
Oh, well, she's only trying to tell you  
What it was that she saw  
She is only trying to tell you  
What it was that she saw  
  
Now see her standing on the table  
With her small arms flailing  
And you feel such compassion  
In your soul for  
Your mute witness  
Still testing the strength  
Of our patience  
  
Oh, well she's only trying to tell you  
What it was that she saw  
She is only trying to tell you  
What it was that she saw  
  
Now see her pointing to the Frisbee  
With a memory so fuzzy  
And her silent words  
Describing the fright of last night  
Four A.M. Northside, Clapham Common  
Oh, god, what was she doing there?  
Will she sketch the answer later?  
Well, I will ask her  
  
"Now dry your tears, my dear"  
Now see her mime in time so nicely  
It would all have been so clear  
If only she had never volunteered  
"Your taxi is here, my dear"  
  
La, la, la-la...
