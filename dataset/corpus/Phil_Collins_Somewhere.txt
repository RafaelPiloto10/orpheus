There's a place for us  
Somewhere a place for us  
Peace and quiet and open air  
Wait for us  
Somewhere  
  
There's a time for us  
Some day a time for us  
Time together with time spare  
Time to learn, time to care  
Some day!  
  
Somewhere  
We'll find a new way of living  
We'll find a way of forgiving  
Somewhere...  
  
There's a place for us  
A time and place for us  
Hold my hand and we're halfway there  
Hold my hand and I'll take you there  
Somehow  
Some day  
Somewhere!
