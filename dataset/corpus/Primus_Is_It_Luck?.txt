My socks and shoes always match  
Is It Luck?  
There's a foot at the end of each of my legs  
Is It Luck?  
I can play my bass for you  
Is It Luck?  
Some girls like to kiss my face  
Is It Luck? Is It Luck?  
  
There's food inside your mouth today  
Is It Luck?  
The barber cuts your hair just so  
Is It Luck?  
When the taste of sex is on your lips  
Is It Luck? Is It Luck? Well Ler  
  
These songs always sound so fast  
Is It Luck?  
Polyester makes you sweat  
Is It Luck?  
If a graham cracker gets you off  
Is It Luck?  
Love, love,  
Is It Luck? well Herb  
  
She said she wanted my body and not my mind  
so I showed her my dictionary to show the  
words that I know and from not what I examined

no no no no no no no  
no no no no no no no  
no no no no no  
  
She wasn't impressed at all.  
She whispered in my ear!  
  
She whispered in my ear  
she said, "You want to get lucky little boy?"  
  
Oh I smiled  
  
I smiled and I said, "Is It Luck"
