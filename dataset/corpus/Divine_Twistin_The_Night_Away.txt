"Hey, where are you going?"  
"Out."  
"Out where?"  
"Out to have a good time"  
"Oh, can I go?"  
"Only if you're into it."  
"Into what?"  
"Twistin'!"  
  
Let me tell you about a place  
Somewhere out in New York way  
Where the people are so gay  
Twistin' the night away  
  
Here they have a lot of fun  
Putting trouble on the run  
Man you'll find the old and young  
Twistin' the night away  
  
Chorus  
Twistin', twistin', everybody's feeling great  
Twistin', twistin', twistin' the night away  
  
Hit a man in evening clothes  
How he got here I don't know  
But man you oughta see him go  
Twistin' the night away  
  
He's dancing with the chick in slacks  
She's mvoing up and back  
Man there ain't nothing like  
Twistin' the night away  
  
(chorus 2x)  
  
Lean up, lean back  
Lean up, lean back  
Walk two steps, take five  
Now turn, now twist!  
  
Lean up, lean back  
Lean up, lean back  
Push in, pull out  
Now thrust, now twist!  
  
Here's a fellow in blue jeans  
Who's dancing with an older queen  
Who's younger than her diamond rings  
Twistin' the night away  
  
Man you oughta see her go  
Twistin' to the rock 'n' roll  
Here you'll find the young and old  
Twistin' the night away  
  
(chorus 2x)
