Fine place for a day full of breakdowns  
Takes more than a meltdown to show us how  
Throw a tack on the road stop the meat plow  
Got a bullet but it ain't mine  
  
They got these pictures of everything  
To break us down, yeah to break me down  
They make us hate and we make it bleed  
  
But I got a lover and yeah  
She shows me how,  
To understand it, yeah to understand  
I got a brother and well  
He shows me how,  
To make amends, yeah to make amends with it  
  
Take a break from the mousetrap we call home  
Takes more than a message to make me smile  
I can feel when she kisses me sleeping  
But not when the news is on
