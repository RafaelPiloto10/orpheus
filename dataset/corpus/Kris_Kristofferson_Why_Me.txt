Why me Lord what have I ever done to deserve even one of the pleasures I've
known  
Tell me Lord what did I ever do  
That was worth loving you or the kindness you've shown  
Lord help me Jesus I've wasted it so help me Jesus I know what I am  
Now that I know that I've needed you so help me Jesus my soul's in your hand  
  
Try me Lord if you think there's a way I can try to repay all I've taken from
you  
Maybe Lord I can show someone else what I've been through myself  
On my way back to you  
Lord help me Jesus...  
Lord help me Jesus...  
Jesus my soul's in your hand
