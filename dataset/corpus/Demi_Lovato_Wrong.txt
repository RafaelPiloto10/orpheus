Sometimes I don't know whether I should wish for a new one  
Sometimes I wanna be alone  
Yet others I wanna be with you  
And I hear those things you say about me  
And I know just who's gonna get in trouble this time  
  
I need you to know tomorrow I'll throw you away  
And I want you to know I won't be crying for that long  
Cuz the world around me is pulling me strong  
And I thought I could love you once more  
Well I was wrong I was wrong  
  
Sometimes I want you to know that I'd wish you away  
Sometimes I don't know yeah  
Yet others I know just what I want and what I need yeah  
And I hear all the names you call me  
And I know just who's gonna get in trouble this time  
  
I need you to know tomorrow I'll throw you away  
And I want you to know I won't be crying for that long  
Cuz the world around me is pulling me strong  
And I thought I could love you once more  
Well I was wrong I was wrong  
  
Sometimes I can't see  
At others it all comes so clearly  
Yeah sometimes I can't breath like when you are next to me  
I know just who is gonna get in trouble this time  
  
I need you to know tomorrow I'll throw you away  
And I want you to know I won't be crying for that long  
Cuz the world around me is pulling me strong  
And I thought I could love you once more  
Well I was wrong I was wrong  
  
I was wrong ooooh yeah
