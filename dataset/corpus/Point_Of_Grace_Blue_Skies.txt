On days of gray  
When doubt clouds my view  
It's so hard to see past my fears  
My strength seems to fade  
And it's all I can do  
To hold on, 'til the light reappears  
Still, I believe though some rain's bound to fall  
That you're here next to me  
And you're over it all  
  
[Chorus]  
Lord, the sky's still blue  
For my hope is in you  
You're my joy  
You're the dream that's still alive  
Like the wind at my back  
And the sun on my face  
You are life  
You're grace  
You are blue skies  
You're my blue skies  
  
When nights are long  
Seems the dark has no end  
Still we walk on in light of the truth  
For waiting beyond  
Where the morning begins  
Is the dawn, and you're mercy anew  
Oh, to believe we're alive in you're love  
There is so much to see  
If we keep looking up  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You fill the heavens with hope and a higher love  
A picture, a promise for life
