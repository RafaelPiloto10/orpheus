I got rhythm....I got music....I got my gal  
Who can ask for anything more  
I got daisies....In green pastures....I got my gal  
Who could ask for anything more  
Old man trouble....I don't mind him.  
You won't find him.... 'round my door  
I got starlight...I got sweet dreams...I got my gal  
Who could ask for anything more  
  
I got rhythm....I got music....I got my gal  
Who can ask for anything more  
Who could ask for anything more
