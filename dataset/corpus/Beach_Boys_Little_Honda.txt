Go!  
I'm gonna wake you up early cause I'm gonna take a ride with you.  
We're goin' down to the Honda shop, I'll tell you what we're gonna do.  
Put on a ragged sweatshirt, I'll take you anywhere you want me to.  
  
[Chorus:]  
First gear, it's all right (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)  
Second gear, I'll lean right (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)  
Third gear, hang on tight (Honda, Honda, go faster, faster)  
Faster, it's all right.  
  
It's not a big motorcycle,  
Just a groovy little motorbike.  
It's more fun than a barrel of monkeys,  
That two-wheeled bike.  
We'll ride on out of the town  
To anyplace I know you like.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It climbs the hills like a Matchless,  
Cause my Honda' built really light.  
When I go in to the turns  
Better hang on tight.  
I'd better turn on the lights  
So we can ride my Honda tonight.  
  
[Chorus]
