Spendin' my vacation in the summer sun  
Gettin' lots of action, havin' lots of fun  
Scorin' like a bandit till the bubble burst  
Suddenly it got to be September first!  
Woe is me.... All summer long I was happy and free  
Save my soul, the board of education took away my parole  
  
I gotta go back, back, back to school again  
You won't find me, till the clock strikes three  
I'm gonna be there till then  
I gotta go back, back, back to school again  
Whoa whoa, I gotta go, Back to School...... Again!  
  
Geometry and History it's just a pain  
Biology and Chemistry destroys my brain  
don't they know that I deserve a better fate  
I'm really much too young to matriculate  
Mama please, your child's come down with a fatal disease  
mama said: "C'mon you lazy bum and get your butt outta bed!"  
  
You gotta go back, back, back to school again  
It's bye bye fun, get your homework done, and better be in by ten  
I gotta go back, back back to school again  
Whoa whoa, I gotta go... Back to School..... Again!  
  
I got my books together and I dragged my feet  
And then I saw this angel boppin' down the street  
I said hey pretty baby, "How's about a date?"  
She said "I'm goin to school and I can't be late!"  
I could see, the look in her eyes was sayin' follow me  
And I was caught... I thought of playin' hooky but on second thought  
  
I gotta go back, back, back to school again  
You won't find me, till the clock strikes three  
I'm gonna be there till then  
I gotta go back, back, back to school again...  
Whoa whoa, I gotta go.... Back to School.... Again!
