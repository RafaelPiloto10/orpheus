Medium, medium.  
  
Waking up I smell the scent of coffee on the brew,  
And I think about the amount of the sweet,  
I'd like to have in my cup today.  
One for the two lump, three lump, four.  
No half of one, no less no more.  
  
Just give me a chance, let me make it mine.  
I'd like a medium blend of that piece of pie.  
Not too bitter, not too sweet  
Medium.  
Just enough to ?  
Medium.  
Not too bitter, not too sweet  
Medium.

Dinner time just rolls around,  
And I think I crave a steak but,  
I'm not too partial to the meat,  
When it's cooked too long and I'm made to wait.  
  
Not too much of the parsony,  
And just enough of the spice.  
I think I'd enjoy a medium-rare dish with a side of fries.  
Not too tender, not too tough  
Medium.  
Not too little, just enough  
Medium.  
Not too tender, not too tough  
Medium.  
Not too little, just enough  
Medium.  
Medium. Medium. Medium. Medium. Just a medium. Medium.  
  
? and I smell the pits but ?  
I could've sworn a ? last week and scrubbed like ?  
I like to stink just a little bit,  
Just to keep you on your toes yes.  
The more I stink the more I think,  
That you smell like a rose.  
  
Not too pleasant, not too bad  
Medium.  
Just enough to hold my ?  
Medium.  
Not too pleasant, not too bad  
Medium.  
Just enough to hold my ?  
Medium.  
Medium. [Repeat: x6]
