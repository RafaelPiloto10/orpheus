Ain't gonna ride that whisky train  
Ain't gonna burn up no more flame  
Throw away my bottle down the drain  
Ain't gonna ride that whisky train  
To think that i could be so wrong  
To be so sick and still go on  
The way i drink it's been too long  
Don't see much point in carrying on  
I'm gonna lose these drinking blues  
  
I'm gonna find a girl to make me choose  
Between lovin' her and drinking booze  
I'm gonna lose these drinking blues  
Ain't gonna ride that whisky train  
I'm tired of burning in the flame  
Throw away my bottle down the drain  
Ain't gonna ride that whisky train
