Baby-O  
You I dig  
Like-a the most  
Ooh, really big  
Love the shape  
Of your brow  
Love your ooh  
Love your ah, love your wow  
Baby-O  
Tell me true  
Could you go  
For me too?  
Cross your heart  
If it's so  
That you're my  
Hope to die baby-O  
Baby-O  
You won't quit  
Like I mean  
This is it  
Love your mad  
Swingin' pad  
You know what  
You're a nut and I'm glad  
Ah baby-O  
May I fly  
In a plane  
Through the sky?  
Writing words  
Just to show  
That you're my  
Ten mile high baby-O  
Baby-O  
Sugarplum  
You are so  
Yummy yum  
Plus to wit  
And whereas  
Tres Jolie E.T.C.  
And all o' that jazz  
Ah, baby-O  
There are laws  
So I wrote  
To old Santa Claus  
Under my  
Mistletoe  
Just for one, please leave one  
Baby-O  
O-baby, O-baby  
Baby-O  
Nobody honey, yeah
