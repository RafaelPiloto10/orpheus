Your skin attached is a fragile cliche  
Of my broken heart attack  
You should swallow your teeth and hang out  
Stay for a while  
If your heart's still beating, it must be blood  
If your lungs's still working, it must be mud  
If its still light, then a kick in the ribs  
Today's worth living?  
  
I don't see anything now  
So just say what you want to say  
It's kind of funny how you're not listening anyway  
  
Lights out, I can't stand to hear you scream while  
We're making love, I was fast asleep  
And the night sky better give something up  
  
I don't see anything now  
So just say what you want to say  
It's kind of funny how I'm not listening anyway  
  
Lights out  
Lights out, I can't stand to hear you scream while  
We're making love, I was fast a sleep  
  
If your heart's still beating, it must be blood  
If your lung's still working, it must be mud  
If its still light out, then a kick in the ribs  
Today's worth living? Then it probably is..  
  
I don't see anything now  
So just say what you want to say  
It's kind of funny how I'm not listening anyway  
I don't see anything now  
So just say what you want to say  
It's kind of funny how I'm not listening anyway  
I'm not listening anyway  
I'm not listening anyway  
I'm not listening  
  
Listening, I'm not listening  
I'm not listening  
I'm not listening  
I'm not listening
