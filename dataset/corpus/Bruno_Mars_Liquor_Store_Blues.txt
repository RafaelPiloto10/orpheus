Now greetings to the world!  
  
Standing at this liquor store,  
Whiskey coming through my pores,  
Feeling like I run this whole block.  
Lotto tickets cheap beer  
That's why you can catch me here,  
Tryna scratch my way up to the top.  
  
'Cause my job got me going nowhere,  
So I ain't got a thing to lose.  
Take me to a place where I don't care,  
This is me and my liquor store blues.  
  
I'll take one shot for my pain,  
One drag for my sorrow.  
Get messed up today,  
I'll be ok tomorrow.  
One shot for my pain,  
One drag for my sorrow.  
Get messed up today,  
I'll be ok tomorrow.  
  
Me and my guitar tonight,  
Singing to the city lights,  
Tryna live on more than what I got.  
'Cause '68 cents ain't gonna pay the rent,  
So I'll be out here 'til they call the cops.  
  
'Cause my job got me going nowhere,  
So I ain't got a thing to lose.  
Take me to a place where I don't care,  
This is me and my liquor store blues.  
  
I'll take one shot for my pain,  
One drag for my sorrow.  
Get messed up today,  
I'll be ok tomorrow.  
One shot for my pain,  
One drag for my sorrow.  
Get messed up today,  
I'll be ok tomorrow.  
  
Here comes Junior Gong, I'm flying high like Superman  
And thinking that I run the whole block,  
I don't know if it's just because pineapple kush between my jaws  
Has got me feeling like I'm on top  
  
Give me this one shot for my pain,  
One drag for my sorrow.  
Get messed up today,  
I'll be ok tomorrow.  
One shot for my pain,  
One drag for my sorrow.  
Get messed up today,  
I'll be ok tomorrow.  
  
Now greetings to the world!  
  
You best believe!
