I got a friend who loves the music  
He got a red hot groove  
But he don't use it  
I get so afraid, he's gonna lose it  
If you gotta gift - man, don't abuse it  
  
Keep on dancing  
  
The experts say they really care  
They don't have a clue what's out there  
The teachers tell the children not to swear  
And the drunken lawyes  
Leaves the kid  
To pop something in  
To kill the fear... it's not fair  
  
Keep on dancing  
  
I'm a frightened Dad, worried sick  
Hear what I say?  
I could put something in here  
You know what rhymes with it  
The whole world seems to end  
In c.k.e.d  
You ain't fooling me anyway  
  
Keep on dancing  
  
Are you ready here comes  
Steve Gadd  
  
Keep on dancing  
  
See em run for the books, 'cause  
They just don't get it  
They throw it at me  
But I've already read it  
Before they speak,  
Some-one already said it  
  
We can't be friends  
'cause Karl Marx don't rhyme  
With Mercedez-Benz  
I need credit  
You can shove it  
You know why?  
'cause I love it!  
  
Keep on dancing
