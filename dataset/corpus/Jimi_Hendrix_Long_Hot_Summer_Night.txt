Show us a long  
Long, long hot summer night  
As far as my eyes could see  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Well my heart was way down  
Cold cold winter stone  
Well my darlin' where can you be  
Where can you be baby  
Where can you be  
  
There were three sugar walls  
And two candy cane windows  
But the silliest move melted all those inside  
Well everybody's on fire, but its  
A snowin' in a cold blizzard  
  
Where are you in this a hot cold summer?  
Where are you in this a hot cold summer?  
Where are you in this a hot cold summer?  
God, god, god  
  
Around about this time the telephone  
Blew its horn across the room  
Scared little Annie  
Clean out of her mind  
Out of her mind  
  
Roman the Candle he peeps out of his peekaboo hide and seek  
And grabbed little Annie from the ceiling just in time  
And the telephone keeps on screamin'  
Yeah yeah yeah!  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!  
  
Hello said my shakey voice, well how you doin'  
I start to stutter  
ah can't cha tell I'm ah doin' fine  
There was my baby talkin' she's way down 'cross the border.  
  
She says I'm gonna hurry to ya I've been a fool  
And I'm tired of cryin'  
Said I'm tired of cryin'  
  
Yeah a long long long hot summer night  
As far as my eyes could see  
But I can ah feel the heat comin' on as my baby's gettin' closer  
  
I'm so glad that my baby's comin' to rescue me  
So glad that my baby's comin' to rescue me  
So glad my baby's comin' to rescue me  
Rescue, rescue, rescue  
Rescue, rescue  
Rescue, rescue, What'd I say  
Rescue me, rescue me  
Rescue, rescue me, rescue me  
Rescue
