Gonna put the world away for a minute  
Pretend I don't live in it  
Sunshine gonna wash my blues away  
Had sweet love but I lost it  
She got too close so I fought it  
Now I'm lost in the world tryin' to find me a better way  
  
Wishin' I was  
Knee deep in the water somewhere  
Got the blue sky, breeze and it don't seem fair  
The only worry in the world  
Is the tide gonna reach my chair  
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky  
Never been so happy  
Never felt so high  
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise  
  
Wrote a note, said "Be back in a minute"  
Bought a boat and I sailed off in it  
Don't think anybody's gonna miss me anyway  
Mind on a permanent vacation  
The ocean is my only medication  
Wishin' my condition ain't ever gonna go away  
  
'Cause now I'm knee deep in the water somewhere  
Got the blue sky breeze blowin' wind through my hair  
Only worry in the world  
Is the tide gonna reach my chair  
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky  
Never been so happy  
Never felt so high  
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise  
  
This champagne shore watchin' over me  
It's a sweet sweet life livin' by the salty sea  
One day you can be as lost as me  
Change your geography and maybe you might be  
  
Knee deep in the water somewhere  
Got the blue sky breeze blowin' wind through my hair  
Only worry in the world  
Is the tide gonna reach my chair  
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky  
Never been so happy  
Never felt so high  
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise  
  
Come on in  
The waters nice  
Find yourself a little slice  
Grab a backpack  
Otherwise you'll never know until you try  
When you lose yourself  
You find a key to paradise
