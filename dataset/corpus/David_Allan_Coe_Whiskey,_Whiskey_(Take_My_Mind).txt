[Chorus]  
Whiskey, whiskey take my mind  
Let me leave it all behind  
Take me somewhere I can find  
Someone to believe  
  
Whiskey, whiskey be my friend  
Don't you let me fall again  
You can help me to pretend  
She won't ever leave  
  
Whiskey, whiskey tell me lies  
You know she can hypnotize  
If I look into her eyes  
I'll be lost again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Whiskey, whiskey keep your cool  
Don't you let me be no fool  
I'll be sitting on this stool  
'Til the very end  
  
[Chorus]
