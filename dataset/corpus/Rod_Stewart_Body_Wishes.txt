The night closes in on another day  
As the oldest game's gettin' underway  
On the minds of a million people  
Body wishes  
  
So you climb on the carousel and then take a chance  
The same old ritual, the same old dance  
The hardest thing to resist is  
Body wishes  
  
If the fire down below's gettin' worse and worse  
You're so close to shootin' that you want to burst  
Somebody's sponge needs squeezin'  
Body wishes  
  
What do I say?  
Nobody gonna tell ya  
Where do I go?  
Somewhere someone'll have ya  
  
Who do I tell?  
Anybody that'll listen  
No one should know  
Won't solve the problem  
  
Body wishes  
Body wishes  
  
Away in the distance a baby cries  
But you know somebody's by her side  
The night drags on forever  
Body wishes  
  
You can hear the tickin' of a lonely clock  
The howlin' wind that just won't stop  
Somebody's cherries need pickin'  
Body wishes  
  
What do I say?  
Nobody gonna tell ya  
Where do I go?  
Somewhere someone'll have ya  
  
Who do I tell?  
Anybody that'll listen  
No one should know  
Won't solve the problem  
  
It'll tear you apart like an angry sea  
Keep you warm like a summer breeze  
It's all we've got in a cold cold world  
Is to love someone  
  
Body wishes  
Body wishes  
  
Somethings happenin' in the air  
It feels so close but you don't know where  
The poorest people's riches  
Body wishes  
  
And the cheatin' hearts never learn  
Someday somewhere's gonna be your turn  
Don't start what you can't finish  
Body wishes  
  
What do I say?  
Nobody gonna tell ya  
Where do I go?  
Somewhere someone'll have ya  
  
Who do I tell?  
Anybody that'll listen  
No one should know  
That won't solve the problem  
  
Where do I run?  
Anywhere that'll hide ya  
Who'll be the one?  
Yeah  
  
Body wishes  
Body wishes  
Body wishes  
Body wishes  
Body wishes  
Body wishes  
Body wishes
