Dais a de start and not the finish na go deal it with ace  
I like to ride up in the ridim wid de treble and the base  
Not a courtroom could a hold me cause they wouldn't have a case  
  
So don't you hurry don't rush me no in a no haste  
Me na go chat dais one fast ca a no race me a race  
Cas Sis V de pan de mike I beg you keep up the pace  
And who a star wid Mr T it's Hannibal, Murdock and face  
I'm sure you noticed on the mike that I am in the right place  
  
I'm gonna chat it in a style and chat it in a grace  
Eat good food drink good you know that's to my taste  
Now make sure eat it drink it all off na make none go to waste  
And who's aeoberti upon Falcon Crest you know him a chase  
  
Se that the top of the crew Sis V I may seem  
See that me deal wid realism get guided by all my dream  
Now raspberry ripple as you know it is my favorite ice-cream  
  
So when me step in a de dance in my gear I just gleam  
I am the top mile women that's why I'm standing so keen  
Don't wa fe hear no pirate chat ca dem no in a my team  
Se dat me de pan level vibes so chatting this I'm the queen  
  
Why don't you shake a leg why don't you rock and come in  
Don't bother fight in a de dance don't want police an the scene  
To sparkle all the polishing you'll have to use Mr Sheen  
Incredible Hulk transformation gigantic and green  
  
So when you look in a him face he stares at you really mean  
I like to eat up my steak better make sure it lean  
Just add some rice add some dumplin' but leave out the bean  
Me na go to restaurant sit down and eat three course meal  
Me a chat it verbally don't want it signed stampedor sealed  
  
In a de old avengers starred steed and Mrs Peel  
Who Robbie Box that gambler on the programme Big Deal  
This one is live and direct so you know it's for real  
I don't respect dais ya system don't expect me to kneel  
Cause Jesus Christ worked his miracle many man ham did heal  
  
Ca man dem make out a flesh and robots made our of steel  
They might can operate like man unlike man they can't feel  
Don't bother mix with no informer cause on you they might squeal  
  
Cas me se when you have a spliff you must kark it  
And when you have a dog you must walk it  
Cause it might just do a number two upon your carpet  
You have to get down on your knee and begin to clean it  
Well in a de white house Mr Reagen a sit  
And when me go a nasa dema launch rocket  
  
So when a got a needle save myself nine stitch  
While Joan Collins she's starring as the super bitch  
Now I'm not exactly poor but I'm certainly ain't rich  
I'm gonna preach it right don't bother call me hypercrit  
  
Don't want hear Tony Butler me no check fe critic  
Ca when I get a curly perm Jahman just use a home kit  
And if I'm forced to hear a pirate dash dem down a snake pit  
  
Mak pirina knam dem tear them flesh bit by bit  
Ca sister de pan de mile and I have got nough lyric  
Jim Davidson teasing Plice with his catch phrase nick nich  
Upon my wrist I wear a watch how does it go tock tick  
And who is starring with Magnum Higgins TC and Rick  
Ca Tony labour S-D-P Jahman dem all make me sick  
Because dem na go get my vote ca me no vote for politic  
A me a Sister V upon the mike coming through
