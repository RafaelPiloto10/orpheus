Last night when I went to bed  
With tangled hair upon my head  
In every way I really was a kid  
It happened without warning  
When I woke up in the morning  
I can't tell you just what happened but it did  
  
I grew six inches in one day  
It's painful when it goes that way  
And now my skinny body's really achin'  
And my skin just exploded  
With an inch of oil it's loaded  
It's so greasy you could fry a pound of bacon  
  
My voice is changing  
Out of thin air  
And body parts that once were smooth  
Are growing bits of hair  
My voice is changing  
What does it mean?  
I guess I'll be a real man  
Before I turn 13  
  
I buy two pairs of jeans a week  
I'm such a tall and awkward geek  
I fall down when I try to play a grounder  
At dinner every night I eat  
A giant heaping plate of meat  
Then go out with my friends for quarter pounders  
  
And weird emotions come alive  
My hormones are in overdrive  
I've turned into a girl-watching creature  
And all my friends their marks are shot  
But they don't care because they're hot  
For Mrs. Smith the mathematics teacher  
  
My voice is changing  
I hate to hear it crack  
I pray to God I won't inherit  
Dad's hairy back  
My voice is changing  
When will it end?  
And when will mom stop kissing me  
In front of all my friends?  
  
Pretty soon I bet I'll  
Be right into heavy metal  
But my parents say at least it isn't rap  
I'll start wearing stupid clothes  
And threaten that I'll pierce my nose  
And tell my parents all they like is crap  
  
The first girl that I ever kiss  
Will be the one and who could miss  
Our love forever written in the stars?  
But I don't think our love will last  
Unless the four years go by fast  
Till I can use the backseat of the car  
  
My voice is changing  
Out of thin air  
And body parts that once were smooth  
Are growing bits of hair  
My voice is changing  
What does it mean?  
I guess I'll be a real man  
Before I turn 13  
  
My voice is changing  
I hate to hear it crack  
I pray to God I won't inherit  
Dad's hairy back  
My voice is changing  
When will it end?  
And when will mom stop kissing me  
In front of all my friends?  
  
Cha-cha-cha!
