You had your chance to show affection  
You had your chance to give me more  
And now that she's found new direction  
You make your way to my back door  
What makes you think the whole world wants you  
Give steel a kiss and it will bend  
The flesh is weak and when it's all been said and done  
The spirits all that's left in the end  
  
If you have to saddle your high horse  
Go on and ride out of my sight  
(ride out of my sight)  
You never had the time of day for me you know  
And now you want to spend the night  
Youre big with the come-on like it's no big deal  
No big deal to you  
You let the wild wind blow your course  
(wild wind blow your course)  
I do not want the dirt from your shoes  
Or from the hooves of your high horse  
  
The way I see it there are few things left  
To hold on to and keep your head yeah  
When it's your sense of humor and integrity  
There's nothing funny about what's being said  
  
There was a day when I would let myself be trampled  
As long as it was done by you  
(as long as it was done by you)  
But I took so much abuse now I've had ample  
There's no way that you'll break through  
  
If you have to saddle your high horse  
Go on and ride out of my sight  
(ride out of my sight)  
You never had the time of day for me you know  
And now you want to spend the night  
Youre big with the come on like it's no big deal  
No big deal to you  
You let the wild wind blow your course  
(wild wind blow your course)  
I do not want the dirt from your shoes  
Or from the hooves of your high horse  
  
You had your chance to show affection  
(you had your chance to show me some affection)  
You had your chance to give me more  
(you had your chance to give me more baby)  
And now that she's found new direction  
You make your way to my back door  
What makes you think the whole world wants you  
Give steel a kiss and it will bend  
The flesh is weak and when it's all been said and done  
The spirits all that's left in the end  
  
If you have to saddle your high horse  
Go on and ride out of my sight  
(ride out of my sight)  
You never had the time of day for me you know you didn't  
And now you want to spend the night  
Youre big with the come on like it's no big deal  
No big deal to you  
You let the wild wind blow your course  
(wild wind blow your course)  
I do not want the dirt from your shoes  
Or from the hooves of your high horse  
I do not want the dirt from your shoes  
Or from the hooves of your high horse  
From your high horse  
From your high horse  
Yeah
