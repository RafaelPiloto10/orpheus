When the rain comes,  
They run and hide their head,  
Might as well be dead,  
When the rain comes,  
When the rain comes.  
  
When the sun shines,  
They slip into the shade,  
Drink their lemonade,  
When the sun shines,  
When the sun shines.  
  
Rain, I don't mind, I don't mind.  
Shine, the weather is fine.  
  
I can show you,  
When I starts to rain,  
Everything's gonna be the same, yeah,  
I can show you, I can show you.  
  
Rain, I don't mind, I don't mind.  
Shine, the weather is fine.
