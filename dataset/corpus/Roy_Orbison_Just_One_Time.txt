Oh, oh, oh how I miss you so  
Mmm, I need you so  
I, I, I'd give this heart of mine  
If I could see you just one time  
If I could see you just one time  
Oh, how it'd ease my troubled mind  
If I could hold you just one time  
And then pretend that you're still mine  
Oh, oh, oh how I miss you so  
Mmm, I need you so  
I, I, I'd give this heart of mine  
If I could see you just one time  
Wish I could really one more time  
Turn back the pages in there I'd find  
That same old love that once was mine  
Wish I could see you just one time  
Oh, oh, oh how I miss you so  
Mmm, I need you so  
I, I, I'd give this heart of mine  
If I could see you just one time  
Oh, oh, oh how I miss you so  
Mmm, I need you so  
I, I, I'd give this heart of mine  
If I could see you just one time
