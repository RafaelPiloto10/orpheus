My eyes may see the coming King in all his majesty  
In company all dressed in white  
But meanwhile here at the world's dark end  
The dragon draws the iron curtain round against the light  
And souls grow weary in his war of love  
and seek their solace strolling down the sweet civilian ways  
But meanwhile back at the world's dark end  
The nations see no future waiting for the serpent to strike  
CHORUS: Where have all the Christian soldiers gone  
Where is the resistance, will no-one be strong  
When will we stand up tall and straight, rise up and storm the gate  
How can we fail to get excited  
The battle is ours, why don't we fight it  
Battalions of darkness rise above me  
But God put a fighter in me, put a fighter in me  
So we will sing songs of victory  
We will rise and set men free  
We will applaud your majesty  
We will proclaim your kingdom come  
We will announce the battle done  
We will lift up the righteous one  
Listen and you're going to hear the sweetest sound you ever heard  
It's the spirit blowing across the land  
It's the voice of one who calls his bride to come and to be ready  
Gentle as a dove he comes with fire  
CHORUS:
