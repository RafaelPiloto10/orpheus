No smiles, not a single word at the breakfast table  
Though I would have liked to begin  
So much that I want to say, but I feel unable  
You leave and you slam the door  
Like you've done many times before  
And I cry and I feel so helpless  
  
One man, one woman  
Two friends and two true lovers  
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times  
One man, one woman  
One life to live together  
One chance to take that never comes back again  
You and me 'till the end  
  
Outside I can see the sun trough the open window  
Inside everything feel so cold  
What's wrong, what is happening, where did all our love go  
Somethimes when I just can't cope  
I cling to a desperate hope  
And I cry and I feel like dying  
  
One man, one woman  
Two friends and two true lovers  
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times  
One man, one woman  
One life to live together  
One chance to take that never comes back again  
You and me 'till the end  
  
Daydreams of a better life, but I have to wake up  
The sound of a key in the door  
You smile and I realize that we need a shake up  
Our love is a precious thing  
Worth the pain and the suffering  
And it's never too late for changin'  
  
One man, one woman  
Two friends and two true lovers  
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times  
One man, one woman  
One life to live together  
One chance to take that never comes back again  
You and me 'till the end  
  
You and me till' the end
