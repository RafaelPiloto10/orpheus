The wall is high, the black barn  
The babe in my arms, in her swaddling clothes  
And I know soon that the sky will split  
And the planets will shift  
Balls of jade will drop and existence will stop  
Little sister, the sky is falling  
I don't mind, I don't mind  
Little sister, the fates are calling on you  
Ah, here I stand again in this old 'lectric whirlwind  
The sea rushes up my knees like flame  
And I feel like just some misplaced, Joan of Arc  
And the cause is you lookin' up at me  
Oh baby, I remember when you were born  
It was dawn and the storm settled in my belly  
And I rolled in the grass and I spit out the gas  
And I lit a match and the void went flash  
And the sky split and the planets hit  
Balls of jade dropped and existence stopped  
Stopped, stop, stop  
Little sister, the sky is falling  
I don't mind, I don't mind  
Little sister, the fates are calling on you  
I was goin' crazy, so crazy, I knew  
I could break through with you  
So, with one hand I rocked you  
And with one heart I reached for you  
I knew you're a youth, was for the takin', fire on a mental plane  
So, I ran through the fields as the bats with their baby vein faces  
Burst from the barn and flames in a violet, violent sky  
And I fell on my knees and pressed you against me  
You're soul was like a network of spittle  
Like glass balls movin' in like cold streams of logic  
And I prayed as that lightning attacked  
That something will make it go crack  
Something will make it go crack  
Something will make it go crack  
Something will make it go crack  
The palm trees fall into the sea  
It doesn't matter much to me  
As long as you're safe, Kimberly  
And I can gaze deep into your starry eyes, baby  
Looking deep in your eyes, baby  
Looking deep in your eyes, baby  
Looking deep in your eyes, baby  
Into your starry eyes, oh  
Oh, oh, in your starry eyes, baby  
Looking deep in your eyes, baby  
Looking deep in your eyes, oh oh  
Oh, oh, looking deep in your eyes, baby  
In your starry eyes, baby  
Looking deep in your eyes, baby
