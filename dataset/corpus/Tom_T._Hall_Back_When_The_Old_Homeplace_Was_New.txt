Well the children come back to see the old home-place  
They don't see a thing that they like  
The old well out back with its cool clear water don't fit into their style of
life  
The old gravel road that leads to the old home-place gets dust on their new
shiny cars  
Well they didn't complain about nothing to do back when the old home-place was
new  
Back when the old home-place was new there was plenty to see and to do  
But they can't remember and I ain't gonna tell 'em  
Back when the old home-place was new

There's an old swimming hole about a half mile away  
An old tire still swings from a tree  
I've got an old jar full of lightening and bugs and a dogfishin' weren't just
today  
They can't get on line from my old telephone and I ain't got no cable TV  
Oh we used to tell stories and some of them true  
Back when the old home-place was new  
Back when the old home-place...  
  
[Harmonica]  
  
Well the toys they treasured are stashed in the attic except for a rusty old
bike  
There's a big ball of string in a drawer in the kitchen  
They used to use flying their kites  
There's a battered old can out there by the tool-shed  
An old can that they used to kick  
They sit on the porch and they stare down the driveway  
They just can't see living like this  
Back when the old home-place...
