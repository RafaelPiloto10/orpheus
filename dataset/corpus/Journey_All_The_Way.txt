I kiss you and I feel you pull away  
It hurts me when I feel you hesitate  
Mistakes I've made wish I could take them back  
Say it's not too late to hear you  
  
[Chorus]  
Speak your heart and I will listen  
Don't hold back we'll find what's missing  
I'll take you all the way  
Close your eyes and think forever  
If you believe we go together  
I'll take you all the way  
  
Sifting through the memories we have known  
Looking back at places we have gone  
Let's not leave behind what so few have found  
Love ain't always easy so  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll take you all the way  
I'll take you all the way  
  
From the miles that come between us  
To have faith in love and where it leads us  
  
I'll take you all the way  
I'll take you all the way  
  
From the miles that come between us  
To have faith in love and where it leads us  
  
I'll take you all the way  
I'll take you all the way
