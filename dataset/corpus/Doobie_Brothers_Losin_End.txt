There aren't enough words to say  
When all I mean is I no longer love you  
I'd like to leave it lie right there  
For the rest ain't kind  
I'm pickin' up my pride, and I'll be on my way  
If you no longer need me  
I only had a word or two that I care to say  
Listen, baby  
If you should ever find your spirit start to breaking  
When your heart is aching  
Remember me  
I was your fool for really quite a long time  
'Til I found out how it feels to play  
On the losing end  
  
When you finally turn and find  
No one around to catch you when you're falling  
To hear you when you're calling  
Oh, remember me, oh, darlin'  
When you finally turn and find  
  
No one around  
To catch you when you're falling  
To hear you when you're calling  
From down on the losin' end  
Oh, ain't it just the losin' end
