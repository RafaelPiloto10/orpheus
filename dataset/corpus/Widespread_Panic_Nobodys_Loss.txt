And we're rolling down the windows for this ride  
And there's not much time to take things slow  
We will turn our heads into the sunrise  
As the storms rage in the west  
And we're goin' down to see my lady luck  
  
Now I'm not really interested in telling you my mind  
Just let me drag another before for you go, I'm a broken wire  
Yeah, nobody knows where to find us cause it ain't nobody's loss  
  
And I can't decide if this place is make believe  
And worked all my life to turn sleet to snow  
We will turn our heads into the sunset  
As the storms rage in the east  
And we're goin' down to see my lady luck  
  
Now I'm not really interested in telling you my mind  
Just let me drag another before for you go, I'm a broken wire  
Yeah, nobody knows where to find us cause it ain't nobody's loss  
  
Well, it's nobody's loss  
Nobody's loss  
Nobody's loss  
Nobody's loss
