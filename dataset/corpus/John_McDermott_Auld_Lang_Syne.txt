Should Auld acquaintance be forgot  
And never brought to mind?  
Should Auld acquaintance be forgot,  
And days o' auld lang syne?  
  
For Auld Lang Syne, my dear,  
For Auld Lang Syne  
We'll tak' a cup o' kindness yet  
For days of Auld Lang Syne  
  
And here's a hand, my trusty friend  
And gie'd a hand o' thine  
And we'll tak' a cup o' kindness yet  
For Auld Lang Syne  
  
For Auld Lang Syne, my dear,  
For Auld Lang Syne,  
We'll take a cup o' kindness yet  
For days of Auld Lang Syne
