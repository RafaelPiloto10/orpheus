I love a piano, I love a piano.  
I love to hear somebody play upon a piano, a grand piano.  
It simply carries me away.  
I know a fine way to treat a Steinway.  
I love to run my fingers o'er the keys, the ivories.  
And with the pedal I love to meddle.  
When Padarewski comes this way.  
I'm so delighted if I'm invited to hear a long haired genius play.  
So you can keep your fiddle and bow.  
Give me a p-I-a-n-o o o.  
I love to stop right beside an upright,  
Or a high toned baby grand.  
I love to stop right beside an upright,
