Hey, excuse me  
  
Hi, my name is Bob, and I work at my job  
I make forty-something dollars a day  
I used to be the man in my hometown  
Till I started to lose my way  
  
It all goes back to when I dropped out of school  
Having fun, I was living the life  
But now I got a problem with that little white rock  
See, I can't put down the pipe  
  
And it's breaking me down  
Watching the world spin 'round  
While my dreams fall down  
Is anybody out there?  
  
It is breaking me down  
No more friends around  
And my dreams fall down  
Is anybody out there?  
  
[Bridge]  
Can anybody out there hear me?  
'Cause I can't seem to hear myself  
Can anybody out there see me?  
'Cause I can't seem to see myself  
There's gotta be a heaven somewhere  
Can you save me from this hell?  
Can anybody out there feel me?  
'Cause I can't seem to feel myself  
  
[Chorus]  
Losing my way  
Keep losing my way  
Keep losing my way  
Can you help me find my way?  
Losing my way  
Keep losing my way  
Keep losing my way  
Can you help me find my way?  
  
Now you gotta understand I was a family man  
I would have done anything for my own  
But I couldn't get a grip on my new found itch  
So I ended up all alone  
I remember where I was when I got my first buzz  
See, I thought I was living the life  
And the craziest thing is  
I'll probably never know the color of my daughter's eyes  
  
And it is breaking me down  
Watching the world spin 'round  
While my dreams fall down  
Is anybody out there?  
  
It is breaking me down  
No more friend around  
And my dreams fall down  
Is anybody out there?  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh my god, please forgive me  
(Father, hear my prayer)  
'Cause I know I've done some wrong in this life  
If I could do it all again  
Have just one more chance  
To take all those wrongs and make them right  
  
[Bridge: x2]  
  
[Chorus]
