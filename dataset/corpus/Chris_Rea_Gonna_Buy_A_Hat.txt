She talks like thunder  
She really lets you know  
She keep changing the rules  
And leave you nowhere to go  
She bore you rigid with the party line  
She's so far left she's gonna get left behind  
  
He wants six pretty white spots on each side of the dice  
He wants it all to be equal but he needs to throw twice  
Now there's a guy in the corner with a smiling gaze  
He turns to me and says  
I'm gonna buy a hat  
'cause I think it's gonna rain  
Got caught out coming here  
Ain't gonna get caught again  
I'm gonna buy a big one  
Like that Mr Gorbachov  
And when it's raining all this crap  
Oh my hat will keep it off  
  
Now take a look at all them leaders  
Desperation in their eyes  
The tight faces smiles that cannot hide it  
They know no more than you or I  
  
So I'm gonna buy a hat  
'cause here they come again  
And when the start to blah-blah  
It's you and me that gets the rain
