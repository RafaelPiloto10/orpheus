This is the room  
This is the wall  
This is the body  
I've been hoping for  
These are the words  
I've been longing just to say  
  
So this is my goal  
The aim of my life  
This is the feeling  
They warned me about  
  
Oh my god,  
What have I done this time  
Oh my god,  
What have I done his time  
  
The things that you've done  
You don't understand  
The feeling the longing  
The failing that's gone  
  
(real heart, stop in  
The arms to be  
Everything shouting  
In the new stone age)  
  
Of my god,  
What have we done this time  
Oh my god,  
What have we done this time  
  
(we'll start living  
In the real stone age)
