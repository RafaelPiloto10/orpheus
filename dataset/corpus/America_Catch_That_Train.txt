Well, I'm drivin' onward  
Through the pourin' rain  
There's a ticket waitin'  
I gotta catch that train  
The yellow racin' dreamboat  
On California air  
Single engine cowboy  
Out in county fair  
So, oh baby, hurry here to me  
Oh baby, come see me  
Oh baby, let the hours flee  
Oh baby, come see  
The silver clouds in August  
Lover's names on trees  
Imagine running water  
You wadin' in knee deep  
So, oh baby, hurry here to me  
Oh baby, come see me  
Oh baby, let the hours flee  
Oh baby, come see  
There's a world waitin'  
Just for you to unfold  
How are you to know  
If you don't see, if you don't see  
Those yellow racin' dreamboats  
On California air  
There's a ticket waitin'  
I guess I'll catch you there  
I guess I'll catch you there  
So, oh baby, hurry here to me  
Oh baby, come see me  
Oh baby, let the hours flee  
Oh baby, come see  
(If you don't come) Oh baby, hurry here to me  
Oh baby, come see me  
(If you don't come) Oh baby, let the hours flee  
Oh baby, come see  
(If you don't come) Oh baby, hurry here to me  
Oh baby, come see me  
(If you don't come) Oh baby, let the hours flee  
Oh baby, come see  
(If you don't come)
