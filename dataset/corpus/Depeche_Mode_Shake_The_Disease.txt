I'm not going down on my knees,  
Begging you to adore me  
Can't you see it's misery  
And torture for me  
When I'm misunderstood  
Try as hard as you can, I've tried as hard as I could  
To make you see  
How important it is for me  
Here is a plea  
From my heart to you  
Nobody knows me  
As well as you do  
You know how hard it is for me  
To shake the disease  
That takes hold of my tongue  
In situations like these  
Understand me  
Some people have to be  
Permanently together  
Lovers devoted to  
Each other forever  
Now I've got things to do  
And I've said before that I know you have too  
When I'm not there  
In spirit I'll be there  
Here is a plea  
From my heart to you  
Nobody knows me  
As well as you do  
You know how hard it is for me  
To shake the disease  
That takes hold of my tongue  
In situations like these  
Understand me
