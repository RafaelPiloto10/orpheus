Full of emptiness  
Broken promises  
And love turned out so sad  
The hurt goes on and on  
  
Full of emptiness  
Hello loneliness  
Good friends will mind  
The sands of time  
Have slipped through my hands  
  
From the bottom to the top  
Why he had me feeling fine  
Then i took a long long drop  
When he walked out of my life  
My world  
  
Full of emptiness  
That and something less  
And memories of him  
Have never seemed to be
