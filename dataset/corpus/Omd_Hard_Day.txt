What I say  
Is what I know  
And all I can say  
Is all I've seen  
Nobody knows  
As well as me  
That safety in numbers  
Is just what it seems  
  
It's been a hard, hard day  
In my life  
It's been a hard, hard day  
For me  
  
And when I walk I walk  
The walk of a tired man  
Talk, I talk about nothing at all  
And when I see, I say it's hard to explain  
What I mean  
  
And when I walk I walk  
The walk of a tired man  
Talk, I talk about  
Nothing at all  
See, I say it's hard to explain  
What I mean  
To say  
  
All I know  
Is all I've seen  
And what I say  
Is what I mean  
How can I explain  
What I know  
When all I know  
Is all I've seen  
And when I walk  
I walk the walk of a tired man  
Talk, I talk about  
Nothing at all  
  
See, I say  
It's hard to explain what I mean  
And when I walk  
I walk the walk of a tired man  
See I say nothing at all  
Talk I talk about nothing  
That's all I do  
  
It's been a hard, hard day  
For me  
It's been such a hard day  
For me  
It's been a hard, hard day  
In my life  
But it's not a day  
I'd choose to forget
