Countin the cows every day

Oh I'm just a cowboy, an old hired hand  
Never seen nothin majestic or grand  
I just received a great big tax return  
Now I'm off to las vegas with money to burn  
  
Its been a while since I last left this town  
Bought a new suit and I'm nevada bound  
Gonna make it, gonna break it, I've been there before  
Nothins gone wrong, this towns such a bore  
  
Chorus:  
Aw, the train leaves at seven, all go to heaven  
Nothin here to make me stay  
Cause that las vegas glitter sure beats kitty litter  
Countin the cows every day  
  
Chorus:  
Yeah, the train leaves at seven, on up to heaven  
Nothin here to make me stay  
Cause that las vegas glitter sure beats kitty litter  
Countin the cows every day  
And countin the cows every day
