I listen to the wind, to the wind of my soul  
Where I'll end up, well I think only God really knows  
I've sat upon the setting sun...  
But never, never, never, never  
I never wanted water once  
No never, never, never  
  
I listen to my words but they fall far below  
I let my music take me where my heart wants to go  
I swam upon the Devil's lake...  
But never, never, never, never  
I'll never make the same mistake  
No - never, never, never
