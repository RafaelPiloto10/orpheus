Gonna get into it, babe  
Down where it's tangled and dark  
Way on into it, baby  
Down where your fears are parked  
Gonna tell the truth about it, babe  
Honey, that's the hardest part  
When we get through it, baby  
You're gonna give up your heart  
Gonna get into it, baby  
Gonna give them demons a call, babe  
Way on into it, baby  
Gonna find out once and for all  
Gonna get a little risky, baby  
Honey, that's my favorite part  
When we get through it, baby  
Gonna give up our hearts  
Gonna give up our hearts  
Well, there's no turnin' back  
No turnin' back this time  
Well, there's no turnin' back  
No turnin' back  
No use in runnin'  
It's always the same  
You can count on the panic  
It's the faces that change  
We might have a chance  
To get this love off the block  
So take a deep breath  
Let's look under that rock, now baby  
Gonna get into it, baby  
Down where it's tangled and dark, no, no, baby  
Way on into it, baby  
Down where your fears are parked  
Gonna tell the truth about it, baby  
Honey, that's the hardest part  
When we get through it, baby  
You're gonna give up  
If we get through it, baby  
You're gonna give up, you're gonna give up  
When we get through it, baby  
You're gonna give up your heart  
Gonna give up your heart  
Gonna give up your heart  
Ooh babe, gonna give up  
You're gonna give up, you're gonna give up  
Gonna give up, gonna give up your heart  
Hey baby, gonna give up, gonna give up  
Gonna give up, gonna give up  
Gonna give up your heart
