Yeah,

There goes my baby  
(ooh girl look at you)  
You don't know how, good, it,  
Feels to call you my girl  
There goes my baby  
Loving everything you do  
Ooh girl look at you  
  
Bet you ain't know that I be checking you out  
When you be putting your heels on  
I swear your body's so perfect baby  
How you work it baby yea  
I love the way that you be poking it out  
Girl give me something to feel on  
So please believe we gone be twerking it out  
By the end of the night baby  
  
I've been waiting all day to wrap my hands  
Around your waist and kiss your face  
Wouldn't trade this feeling for nothing  
Not even for a minute  
And I'll sit here long as it takes  
To get you all alone  
But as soon as you come walking my way  
You gon' hear me say  
  
There goes my baby (there she goes, there she goes, there she goes)  
(ooh girl look at you)  
You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl (you dont know)  
There goes my baby  
(there she goes, there she goes, there she goes, no, no, no)  
Loving everything you do  
Ooh girl look at you  
  
I get the chills whenever I see your face  
And you in the place girl  
Feel like I'm in a movie baby  
I'm like ooh wee baby, oh  
Like waterfalls your hair falls down to your waist  
Can I get a taste girl  
No need to keep this baby  
I ain't ashamed of calling your name girl  
  
I've been waiting all day to wrap my hands  
Around your waist and kiss your face  
Wouldn't trade this feeling for nothing  
Not even for a minute  
And I'll sit here long as it takes  
To get you all alone  
But as soon as you come walking my way  
You gon' hear me say  
  
There goes my baby (that's my baby)

You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl

There goes my baby

Loving everything you do  
Ooh girl look at you  
  
And girl I feel like it's our first time  
Every time we get together  
Baby loving you feels better than  
Everything, anything  
Put on my heart you don't need a ring  
And I promise our time away won't change my love  
  
There goes my baby (there she goes)

You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl  
There goes my baby

Loving everything you do  
Ooh girl look at you  
  
There goes my baby  
(ooh girl look at you)  
You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl

There goes my baby  
Loving everything you do  
Ooh girl look at you
