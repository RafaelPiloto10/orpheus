You feel bad, let me tell you, we all get the blues  
Sometimes life is a burden, weighed down in your shoes  
When it's bad, worse, worst  
(And when you're feeling so bad)  
And you think you're cursed  
(And you've got it sad)  
Well, if there's one thing for the better that can turn you loose  
  
It's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
  
My friend Sam is a chauffeur, Annie goes to school  
Jerry works at the office, Sue lies by the pool  
But on all weekends  
(Together again)  
When I meet my friends  
(I'm gonna see them now)  
And we're lookin' round for the action we sure play it cool  
  
It's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
  
You paint your world and use all colors  
And then you find it all comes out too bright  
You know it's only a lie  
The songs you sing are too romantic  
And when you want the truth  
They only spit in your eye  
Oh yeah, they're only telling you lies  
Oh yeah, there's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
  
You feel bad, let me tell you, we all get the blues  
Sometimes life is a burden, weighed down in your shoes  
When it's bad, worse, worst  
(You know you're feeling so bad)  
And you think you're cursed  
(And you've got it sad)  
Well, if there's one thing for the better that can turn you loose  
  
It's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul
