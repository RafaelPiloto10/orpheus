Seven in the evening grabbed the phone and started calling  
All my friends coz it's saturday night  
I got this funky feelin' before I start on leavin' that tonight i'll meet the
man of my life  
Pre chorus:  
Give me time so I can think about  
All those days that we have to go away  
If you feel a little insecure  
Come with me baby I will be your cure  
Chorus 2x:  
Bounce come turn it up  
Bounce to the music  
Come shake it up  
Bounce until you drop  
Ain't nobody gonna stop me  
I got this party movin'  
Everybody start on groovin'  
I feel the sound coz I know your around  
You can scream if you want to  
Jump around if it makes you  
Feel alright while you dance through the night  
Repeat pre chorus  
Repeat chorus
