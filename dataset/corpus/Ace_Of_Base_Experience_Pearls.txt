Give me all your tears  
Let me turn them into pearls  
Let me turn all the tears  
That you've cried into pearls  
Hand them to me, I'm gonna keep  
  
Keep them for you  
I want to hold you,  
I want to kiss you  
I want to mend what is broken.  
  
Love me the way that you loved her, please  
Cause now I'm giving it all,  
And so I've made up my mind, I'm gonna be  
Yours this time, I'm gonna give what I've got,  
And get your love in return.  
And so I've made up my mind, I'm gonna be  
Yours this time, I'm gonna teach you to trust  
And learn how to burn,  
Experience pearls  
Pearls of experience  
When sand strikes up in your eyes  
I will cover your face.  
  
I'll plant your desert with roses,  
And I'm gonna keep, keep them for you.  
And so I've made up my mind  
  
I'll wear your pearls more precious than silver  
I'll wear your pearls so close to my skin.  
I'd tear myself apart just to get you,  
And so I've made up my mind  
  
And so I've made up my mind
