[Chorus]  
How blue can you make me  
How long till I heal  
How can I go on loving you when you're gone  
How blue can I feel  
  
Oh honey why did you leave me  
Ain't you got a heart left in your chest  
I swear to you that I'm dying  
Cause my mind won't let my body rest  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If I sink any lower I'll go under  
If I cry anymore I'll go blind  
Oh there ain't no relief for this missing you grief  
How long can you torture my mind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
How can I go on loving you when you're gone  
How blue can I feel
