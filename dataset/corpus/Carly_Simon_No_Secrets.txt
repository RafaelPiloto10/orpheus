We have no secrets  
We tell each other everything  
About the lovers in the past  
And why they didn't last  
We share a cast of characters from a to z  
We know each others fantasies  
And though we know each other better when we explore  
Sometimes I wish  
Often I wish  
That I never knew some of those secrets of yours  
  
The water was cold  
The beach was empty but for one  
Now you were lying in the sun  
Wanting and needing no-one  
Then some child came, you never asked for her to come  
She drank a pint of your rum  
And later when you told me  
You aid she was a bore  
Sometimes I wish  
Often I wish  
That I never knew some of those secrets of yours  
  
In the name of honesty, in the name of what is fair  
You always answer my questions  
But they don't always answer my prayers  
And though I know you say that it's me that you adore  
Sometimes I wish  
Often I wish  
That I never, never, never knew  
Some of those secrets of yours  
Some of those secrets of yours  
Some of those secrets of yours  
We have no secrets  
Telling each other most everything now
