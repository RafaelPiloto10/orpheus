There's a little cafe' on the corner of town  
Lucy works there 'til the sun goes down  
It ain't very much but she brings home the bacon and the bread  
  
We got a mortgage we pay just a little bit on  
But it seems like all of our money is gone  
Before we get a chance to get ahead  
That's small stuff, we don't sweat the small stuff  
  
Why worry about the mortgage and the minimum wage  
Traffic and the taxes and the coming of age  
Small stuff  
There's a comfort in the knowing there's a spirit in us  
Giving us the courage and the wisdom to trust  
In a love that's so much greater than all the small stuff  
So we don't sweat the small stuff  
  
There's a little bitty hole in the ceiling above  
Sometimes the rain drips down on our temple of love  
We have to put a pot smack dab in the middle of the bed  
Somebody hit my car at the diner last night  
Had to drive it home with one taillight  
When I went out this morning, the engine was dead  
That's small stuff, we don't sweat the small stuff  
  
Why worry about the mortgage and the minimum wage  
Traffic and the taxes and the coming of age  
Small stuff  
There's a comfort in the knowing there's a spirit in us  
Giving us the courage and the wisdom to trust  
In a love that's so much greater than all the small stuff  
So we don't sweat the small stuff  
  
There's a little cafe' on the corner of town  
Lucy works there 'til the sun goes down  
And she don't sweat the small stuff
