Your eyes seek conclusion  
In all this confusion of mine  
Though you and I both know  
It's only the warm glow of wine  
That's got you to feeling this way,  
But I don't care,  
I want you to stay  
And hold me and tell me  
You'll be here to love me today  
  
Children are dancin',  
The gamblers are chancin' their all  
The window's accusing  
The door of abusing the wall  
But who cares  
What the night watchmen say  
The stage has been set for the play  
Hold me and tell me  
You'll be here to love me today  
  
The moon's come and gone  
But a few stars hang on on to the sky  
The wind's runnin' free  
But it ain't up to me ask why  
The poets are demanding their pay  
They've left me with nothin' to say  
'cept hold me and tell me  
You'll be here to love me today  
Just hold me and tell me that  
You'll be here to love me today
