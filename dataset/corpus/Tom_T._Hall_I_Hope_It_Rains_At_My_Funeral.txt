A man with forty acres plowed and planted  
Can't send no fourteen year old boy to no school  
The only thing I learned in the years I worked on my daddy's farm, was  
"Son, you better get them crops in when it turns cool"  
  
In the magazines, I saw the naked women  
I heard about the drinkin' and the bars  
If my daddy could've caught me, he'd a-killed me  
He said, "You might run, boy, but you ain't gonna get far"  
  
I hit town or you might say that it hit me  
Next mornin' there were things, I knew more about  
The woman who had taken me in said, "Country boy, you're all right"  
The same way, I turned her on, she turned me out  
  
The first law I broke, right away they got me  
I helped them build the country roads for awhile  
They fed me, two times a day and knocked me down about four  
For thirty days I didn't even crack a smile  
  
I met a nice girl and she said I was her baby  
She let me go and would never tell me why  
I learned what it means, to be somebody's baby  
They let you lie in your bed by yourself and cry  
  
The miles were good but the mileage is turnin' my hair gray  
I've met some people that knew me and call me friend  
Ain't no sense in wantin' my life to live over  
I'd find different ways to make those mistakes again  
  
So let me say this, I never tried to hurt anybody  
Though I guess there's a few, that I still couldn't look in the eye  
If I've got one wish, I hope it rains at my funeral  
For once, I'd like to be the only one dry
