Love, soft as an easy chair  
Love, fresh as the morning air  
One love that is shared by two  
I have found with you  
Like a rose under the April snow  
I was always certain love would grow  
Love ageless and evergreen  
Seldom seen by two  
So you and I will make each night a first  
Everyday a beginning  
Sprits rise and their dance go unrehearsed  
They warm and excite us  
Cause we have the brightest love  
Two lights, two lights that shine as one  
Morning glory and a midnight sun  
Time we learned to sail above  
Time the world changed the meaning of  
Oh, ooh one love  
Ageless and ever,  
Evergreen.
