Drifting, drifting, drifting away  
I got myself a mansion, then I gave it away  
It's not the world that's heavy, it's just the things that you save  
And I'm drifting, drifting away  
Drifting, drifting, drifting along  
I rid myself of worries, and my worries were gone  
I only run when I want to and I sleep like a dog  
I'm drifting, drifting along  
The suit coats say, "there is money to be made"  
They get so excited, nothing gets in their way  
My road it may be lonely just because it's not paved  
It's good for drifting, drifting away  
All the suit coats say, "there is money to be made"  
They get so excited, nothing get's in their way  
My road it may be lonely just because it's not paved  
It's good for drifting, drifting away  
Drifting, drifting, drifting, uh huh  
I feel like going back there, but never for long  
I sometimes wonder if they know that I'm gone  
I'm drifting, drifting along  
Drifting, drifting along, drifting, drifting along.
