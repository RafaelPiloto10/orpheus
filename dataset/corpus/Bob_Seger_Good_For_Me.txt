She's no good at being phony  
She never tells a good lie  
She knows just when to let me be  
She always knows when I'm too high  
She's never out in front of me  
Or way too for  
Too for behind  
She's always right beside me  
Right in the good place all the time  
She's so good for me  
So good for me  
She's so good for me  
  
Good for me yeah  
Oh, and when I call her at midnight  
Oh, the lady she knows just what to say  
She says the words I long to hear  
Oh yeah, 'couse that's her way  
She knows just what to say  
To make me want to stay 'cause that's her way  
  
She's good for me  
Oh, so good for me  
She's sure enough good for me yeah  
So good so good so good she's so good for me oh yeah  
She's so good for me  
Oh the lady  
She's so good for me  
Good for me
