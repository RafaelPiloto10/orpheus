I don't know why you're,  
Looking at those other girls,  
I'm delicious.  
  
They're disgusting, I'm delicious,  
They disgust me, I'm delicious,  
Let's discuss this, I'm delicious,  
Delicious.  
  
They're disgusting, I'm delicious,  
They disgust me, I'm delicious,  
Let's discuss this, I'm delicious,  
Delicious.  
  
My, my, apple of my eye,  
Think you're really hot,  
And I want you to me mine.  
I like the way the brain,  
On your pinky ring shine,  
Aye, aye, aye!  
  
Keep them other girls at bay,  
Oh, I would blow them all away.  
Keep them other girls at bay,  
Oh, I would blow them all away.
