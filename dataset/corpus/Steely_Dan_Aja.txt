Up on the hill  
People never stare  
They just don't care  
Chinese music under banyan trees  
Here at the dude ranch above the sea  
Aja  
When all my dime dancin' is through  
I run to you  
  
Up on the hill  
They've got time to burn  
There's no return  
Double helix in the sky tonight  
Throw out the hardware  
Let's do it right  
Aja  
When all my dime dancin' is through  
I run to you  
  
Up on the hill  
They think I'm okay  
Or so they say  
Chinese music always sets me free  
Angular banjoes  
Sound good to me  
Aja  
When all my dime dancin' is through  
I run to you
