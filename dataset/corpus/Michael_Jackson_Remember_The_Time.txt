Do you remember  
When we fell in love  
We were so young and innocent then  
Do you remember  
How it all began  
It just seemed like heaven so why did it end?  
  
Do you remember  
Back in the fall  
We'd be together all day long  
Do you remember  
Us holding hands  
In each other's eyes we'd stare  
(Tell me)  
  
Do you remember the time  
When we fell in love  
Do you remember the time  
When we first met girl  
Do you remember the time  
When we fell in love  
Do you remember the time  
  
Do you remember  
How we used to talk  
(Ya know)  
We'd stay on the phone at night till dawn  
Do you remember  
All the things we said like  
I love you so I'll never let you go  
  
Do you remember  
Back in the Spring  
Every morning birds would sing  
Do you remember  
Those special times  
They'll just go on and on  
In the back of my mind  
  
Do you remember the time  
When we fell in love  
Do you remember the time  
When we first met girl  
Do you remember the time  
When we fell in love  
Do you remember the time  
  
Those sweet memories  
Will always be dear to me  
And girl no matter what was said  
I will never forget what we had  
Now baby!  
  
Do you remember the time  
When we fell in love  
Do you remember the time  
When we first met  
Do you remember the time  
When we fell in love  
Do you remember the time  
  
Do you remember the time  
When we fell in love  
Do you remember the time  
When we first met  
Do you remember the time  
When we fell in love  
Do you remember the time  
  
Remember the times  
Ooh  
Remember the times  
Do you remember girl  
Remember the times  
On the phone you and me  
Remember the times  
Till dawn, two or three  
What about us girl  
  
Remember the times  
Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you  
Remember the times  
In the park, on the beach  
Remember the times  
You and me in Spain  
Remember the times  
What about, what about  
  
Remember the times  
Ooh, in the park  
Remember the times  
After dark  
Do you, do you, do you  
Remember the times  
Do you, do you, do you, do you  
Remember the times  
Yeah yeah
