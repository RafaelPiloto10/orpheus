Verse one: ice cube  
  
Peace. Haha don't make me laugh!  
All I hear is muthafucker's talkin' sucotash  
Livin' large, tellin' me to get out the gang  
I'm a nigga, gotta live by the trigger  
How the fuck do you figure?  
That I can say peace and the gunshots won't cease  
Every cop killin' goes ignored  
They just send another nigga to the morgue  
A point scored- they could give a fuck about us  
They rather catch us with guns and white powder  
If I was old, they'd probably be a friend of me  
Since I'm young, they consider me the enemy  
They kill ten of me to get the job correct  
To serve, protect, and break a niggas neck  
'cause I'm the one with the trunk of funk  
And 'fuck tha police' in the tape deck  
You should listen to me 'cause there's more to see  
Call my neighborhood a ghetto 'cause it houses minorities  
The other color don't know you can run but not hide  
These are tales from the darkside...  
  
Verse two:  
  
You wanna free africa, I stare at yuh  
'cause we ain't got it too good in america  
I can't fuck with them overseas  
My homeboy died over a key of cocaine  
It was plain and simple  
The 9mm went to the temple  
Was the sound I put the bitch down  
And ran to the schoolyard bathroom  
Looked in the trash can yo it had room  
So I ducked my ass in it for a minute  
Covered with sweat I had the layback  
Mad as fuck, thinkin' about the payback  
Tonite the crew gonna have a little fun  
I went home and cocked the barrel of my shotgun  
It's gettin' critical - I start the five point o  
There they go - drive real slow  
I yelled out 'ice cube sucka'  
Shot gun hit - and murder mutahfuckers  
I told you last album, when I got a sawed off, bodies are hard off  
Its a shame, that niggas die young  
But to the light side it don't matter none  
It'll be a drive by homicide  
But to me it's just another tale from the darkside...  
  
Verse three: chuck d  
  
Standing in the middle of war  
The middle we flex  
When we die, they won't make check  
Ebony can't see to the darkside  
The term they apply to us is a nigga  
Call it what you want, 'cause I'm comin' from the coroner  
Same applies with a phd  
Who'z black - don't wanna role - sells his soul  
Watch his head go rollin'  
Who the fuck are they foolin'?  
Nobody knows, but I suppose the color of my clothes  
Matches the color of the one on my face as they wonder what's under my waist  
[standin on the verge] of them gettin' brown  
That's a fact got a fear on their bozack  
Run, run, run, their ass off, they can not hide  
Yet cube, they can't fuck with the darkside!
