If you ever want to taste it  
Go down to the wishing well  
Poison in the well won't make it  
Keep yourself as strong as can be  
  
All men I'll take you  
Take you down and tell you why  
I said woman gonna take you  
Take you down a well that's wide  
  
Take it to the river  
Take it to the world  
I say loving heart  
Gonna show the way  
  
All men  
What ya seeing  
Living it all for the life  
Say all men  
What ya seeing  
Gonna change your ways  
Gonna change your ways  
Gonna change your mind  
  
If you're ever gonna taste it  
Never look right or left  
Look ahead  
I'm the healer  
You're believing  
  
Gonna carry ya to the end  
Gonna carry ya to the end  
  
I'm a healer  
I'm a healer
