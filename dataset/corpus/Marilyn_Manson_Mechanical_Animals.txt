We were neurophobic and perfect  
The day that we lost our souls  
Maybe we weren't so human  
But If we cry we cry we will rust  
And I was a hand grenade  
That never stopped exploding  
You were automatic and as hollow as the "o" in god  
  
I never gonna be the one for you  
I never gonna save the world from you  
They'll never be good for you  
Bad to you  
They'll never be anything  
Anything at all  
  
You were my mechanical bride  
A Phenobarbidoll  
A manniqueen of depression  
With the face of a dead star  
And I was a hand grenade  
That never stopped exploding  
You were automatic and as hollow as the "o" in god  
  
I am never gonna be the one for you  
I never gonna save the world from you  
They'll never be good for you  
Bad to you  
They'll never be anything  
Anything at all  
They'll never be good for you  
Bad to you  
They'll never be anything  
Anything at all  
I am never gonna be the one for you  
I never gonna save the world from you  
  
  
This isn't me I'm not mechanical  
I'm just a boy playing the suicide ki ng [ 5x ]
