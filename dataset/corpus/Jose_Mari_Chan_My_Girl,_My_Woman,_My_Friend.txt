Jose Mari Chan:  
When my work is through at the end of the day  
There's nothing else that I'd rather do  
Than to be with you at the end of the day  
To be right by your side makes me feel brand new  
'Cause you're my girl, my woman, my friend  
And that's how it's gonna be till the end.  
Loving you is what I live for  
And I can't ask for anything more  
You're my woman, my girl, and my friend  
Rolled into one.  
  
Janet Basco:  
You're my man and I'm at the prime of my life  
To you I give myself, all my heart  
All of what I am at the prime of my life  
I'll never let a thing come to break us apart  
'Cause I'm your girl, your woman, your friend  
And that's how it's gonna be till the end.  
Loving you is what I live for  
And I can't ask for anything more  
Than to be your woman, your girl, and your friend.  
  
Jose Mari Chan:  
Being with you, my love, just makes my day complete  
  
Janet Basco:  
Holding you close my love, creates a wondrous treat.  
  
Jose Mari Chan:  
No need to say the words  
No fancy places for me.  
  
Janet Basco:  
Love is anywhere  
As long as you are there with me.  
  
Both:  
We'll be free  
Our love will make us free to be you and me.  
  
Janet Basco:  
('Cause) I'm your girl, your woman, your friend  
And that's how it's gonna be till the end.  
Loving you is what I live for  
And I can't ask for anything more  
Than to be your woman, your girl, and your friend  
(Both) Rolled into one
