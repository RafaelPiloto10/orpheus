Well she gets up in the morning  
With the roosters and the hens  
Get ready for school before the class begins  
Oh little Lou, can I walk to school with you  
The bells are ringin', if we are late what shall we do  
Well if the teachers in the classroom ask us why we been  
Late today, oh, it is late again  
Oh little Lou, why did you make me hesitate  
You know the teacher will say  
There's no excuse for bein' late  
Well the lunchbell's a-ringin' and it's time for us to eat  
The dean keeps us shovin', all this steppin' on my feet  
Oh little Lou, I'll save a place in line for you  
Now that luch has passed, can I walk you back to class  
Well the last class is over and I'm standing all alone  
A football star walks my little Lou home  
Oh little Lou, child this is more than I can bear  
I'll try tomorrow, hope to hear you say you care
