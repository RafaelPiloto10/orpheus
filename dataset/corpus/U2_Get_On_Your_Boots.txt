The future needs a big kiss  
Winds blow with a twist  
Never seen a moon like this  
Can you see it too?  
  
Night is falling everywhere  
Rockets hit the fun-fair  
Satan loves a bomb scare  
But he won't scare you  
  
Hey! Sexy boots  
Get on your boots yeah!  
  
Free me from a dark dream  
Candy floss, ice cream  
All the kids are screaming but the ghosts aren't real  
Here's what we gotta be  
Love and community  
Laughter is eternity if joy is real  
  
You don't know how beautiful  
You don't know how beautiful you are  
You don't know  
You don't get it do you?  
You don't know how beautiful you are  
  
If some have stuff to blow it up  
Well, we are into growing up  
Women are the future  
All the big revelations  
I got a submarine  
You've got gasoline  
I don't wanna talk about wars between nations  
Not right now  
  
Sexy boots  
No! no no no  
Get on your boots yeah!  
Not right now!  
Foxy boots  
  
You don't know how beautiful  
You don't know how beautiful  
You are  
You don't know  
You don't get it do you?  
You don't know how beautiful you are  
  
Sexy boots  
I don't wanna talk about wars between the nations  
Sexy Boots yeah!  
  
Let me in the sound  
Let me in the sound  
Let me in the sound sound  
Let me in the sound sound  
Let me in the sound  
Let me in the sound  
Let me in the sound now  
Oh God I'm going down  
I don't wanna drown now  
Meet me in the sound
