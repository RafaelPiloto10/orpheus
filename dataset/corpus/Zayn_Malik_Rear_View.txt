[Verse 1]  
Can your heart be mine in search?  
Cause I have no time to help you find all the words  
Melodies and memories, stories that sound absurd  
I will tell no lies  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
As long as you look me in the eyes  
I'll go wherever you are, I'll follow behind  
  
[Chorus]  
Heard about all the things you've done  
And all the wars that you've been in  
Heard about all the love you lost  
It was over before it began  
Heard about all the miles you've gone  
Just to start again  
Heard about all that you've been through  
And it sounds like you need a friend, a friend  
  
[Verse 2]  
Please don't wait, I'm not coming home tonight  
I wanna love you but I can't  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
As long as you look me in the eyes  
I'll go wherever you are, I'll follow behind  
  
[Chorus]  
Heard about all the things you've done  
And all the wars that you've been in  
Heard about all the love you lost  
It was over before it began  
Heard about all the miles you've gone  
Just to start again  
Heard about all that you've been through  
And it sounds like you need a friend, a friend  
  
[Bridge]  
I never doubted myself  
But I doubted you  
I'm tired of looking at myself  
In my rear view  
  
[Chorus]  
Heard about all the things you've done  
And all the wars that you've been in  
Heard about all the love you lost  
It was over before it began  
Heard about all the miles you've gone  
Just to start again  
Heard about all the that you've been through  
And it sounds like you need a friend, a friend
