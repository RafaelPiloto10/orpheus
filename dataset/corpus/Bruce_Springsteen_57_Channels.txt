I bought a bourgeois house in the hollywood hills  
With a truckload of hundred thousand dollar bills  
Man came by to hook up my cable tv  
We settled in for the night my baby and me  
We switched 'round and 'round 'til half-past dawn  
There was fifty-seven channels and nothin' on  
  
Well now home entertainment was my baby's wish  
So I hopped into town for a satellite dish  
I tied it to the top of my japanese car  
I came home and I pointed it out into the stars  
A message came back from the great beyond  
There's fifty-seven channels and nothin' on  
  
Well we might'a made some friends with some billionaires  
We might'a got all nice and friendly if we'd made it upstairs  
All I got was a note that said " bye-bye john  
Our love is fifty-seven channels and nothin' on"  
  
So I bought A. 44 magnum it was solid steel cast  
And in the blessed name of elvis well I just let it blast  
'til my tv lay in pieces there at my feet  
And they busted me for disturbing the almighty peace  
Judge said " what you got in your defense son?"  
" fifty-seven channels and nothin' on"  
  
I can see by your eyes friend you're just about gone  
Fifty-seven channels and nothin' on...
