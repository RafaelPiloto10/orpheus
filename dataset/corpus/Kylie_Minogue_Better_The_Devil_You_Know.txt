Better the devil you know  
Better the devil you know  
Woah Better the devil you know  
Better the devil you know  
Woah woah woah  
  
Say you won't leave me no more  
I'll take you back again  
No more excuses no, no  
'Cause I've heard them all before  
A hundred times or more  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll forgive and forget  
If you say you'll never go  
'Cause its true what they say  
It's better the devil you know  
  
Woh woh woh  
Our love wasn't perfect I know  
I think I know the score  
If you say you love me, oh boy  
I can't ask for more  
I'll come if you should call  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll be here every day  
Waiting for your love to show  
Yes it's true what they say  
It's better the devil you know  
  
Woh woh woh  
I'll take you back I'll take you back again  
I'll take you back I'll take you back again  
  
[Chorus until fade]
