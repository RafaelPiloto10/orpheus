She's stone cold bush yea  
And baby that's alright  
She's stone cold bush yea  
And that's alright with me  
Get up off your knees, come on walk with me  
Tell me what you need to get along  
  
A statue come to life  
I cut you with my knife  
Bleeding to the tune of dolly dagger  
She's stone cold bush  
Haight Street got nothing to show  
Except the skirt on your ass  
When you're livin' on the streets  
You've got to let it roll  
Get on with what you've got  
Awe everybody knows that it's alright  
You've got no secrets to tell  
But when you smoke that rock and suck that cock  
  
You do it oh so well  
She's stone cold bush  
She's got marble eyes  
Sweet china doll her thighs  
And animal in pain she starts to cry  
  
Her pipes are open wide  
She blows more than my mind  
Echo sounds of soul  
Time after time  
She's stone cold bush
