The sun has fallen  
  
Another day gone without you  
  
My heart keeps calling  
  
And I don't know just what to do  
  
When you're near me  
  
I seem to forget my lonely days  
  
It's more than a feeling  
  
It's something that can't be explained  
  
Chorus:  
  
I wish that I was there  
  
I wish that I was there  
  
When you're not here,  
  
I wish that I was there.  
  
(repeat)  
  
You were falling  
  
Now I'm coming around again  
  
I was calling  
  
Cause without you it's the end  
  
I just want to see you a little more  
  
I just want to dream of you some more  
  
I just want to see you a little more  
  
I just want to be with you some more.  
  
Chorus  
  
And you make me feel  
  
Won't you take me when you're not here  
  
It's been raining here  
  
And I just want you to be near.  
  
I just want to see you a little more.  
  
I just want to dream of you some more.  
  
I just want to see you a little more.  
  
I just want to be with you some more.  
  
Chorus
