Passing through air.  
You mix the stars with your arms.  
Walking through there.  
The doom of eternity balms.  
Skies of gray are not today.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh! Don't you throw my love away,  
I need your loving, I need your loving.  
Oh! Don't you pour down rain today,  
I need your love, I need your care  
So much, so much, so much!  
  
Laughing through smiles.  
You lick my love with the years.  
Walking for miles.  
You cool my brow with your tears.  
Skies of gray are not today.  
  
Oh! Don't you throw my love away,  
I need your loving, I need your loving.  
Oh! Don't you pour down rain today,  
I need your love, I need your care  
So much, so much, so much!  
  
[Chorus: x2]
