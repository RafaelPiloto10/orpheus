Ah, what happened to our little girl?  
She doesn't sing like she used to do  
Ah, why won't she say it to the world?  
She doesn't want us anymore. She is gone  
  
In a private heaven  
They may try  
But nobody can find you  
In a private heaven  
  
Close your eyes  
It's waiting right behind you  
Ah, when did her laughter fly away?  
She doesn't smile like she used to do  
  
Ah, where is her happy yesterday?  
She doesn't want us anymore. She is gone  
In a private heaven  
They may try  
  
But nobody can find you  
In a private heaven  
Close your eyes  
It's waiting right behind you  
  
You can't take our love away - no you can't  
You can't take our love away - please don't take  
You can't take our love away - no you can't now  
You can't take our love away - please don't take it  
You can't take our love away - no you can't  
You can't take our love away - please don't take  
You can't take our love away - can't take it away  
You can't take our love away - can't take it away  
You can't take our love away - you can't take it away  
  
Ah, will you be coming home again?  
She doesn't have somewhere else to go  
Ah, who will become your special friend?  
I will be taking her away. She is gone  
In a private heaven  
They may try  
But nobody can find you  
In a private heaven  
Close your eyes  
It's waiting right behind you
