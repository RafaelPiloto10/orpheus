You know that everybody has a voice  
And how they use it is their own free choice  
In your glory I will not rejoice  
If you choose the ways of war  
If you choose the ways of war  
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust  
My country 'tis of thee, in God we trust  
But how much longer will he shelter us  
While we choose the ways of war  
While the winds of war rage on  
Let mine "oh let my small voice" be a voice for peace  
Oh let mine "oh let my small voice" be a voice for peace  
Oh let mine "oh let my small voice" be a voice for peace  
Let it start here with me, oh let mine be a voice for peace  
The good book tells us thou shalt not kill  
The truth came shining and it's shining still  
But how much blood upon this earth must spill  
Before we lay our weapons down  
Let us lay our weapons down  
Let mine "oh let my small voice" be a voice for peace  
Oh let mine "oh let my small voice" be a voice for peace  
Oh let mine "oh let my small voice" be a voice for peace  
Let it start here with me, oh let mine be a voice for peace  
And in the face of the beast, oh let mine be a voice  
Until the breaths in me cease, oh let mine be a voice for peace  
Let mine "oh let my small voice" be a voice for peace  
Oh let mine "oh let my small voice" be a voice for peace  
Oh let mine "oh let my small voice" be a voice for peace  
Let it start here with me, oh let mine be a voice for peace  
Raise your voice up, raise your voice up  
Raise your voice up and sing for the promise
