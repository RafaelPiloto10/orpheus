This is just another town that I painted  
You're just another girl that were not too well equated  
I'm a drifter at this time and we parted oh but why am I so heavy hearted  
It's just another town on the highway  
Just like a thousand others I passed her goin' my way  
I just came to say goodbye why do I want to cry after all it's just another
town  
That's just another door why can't I open it and go  
If I told you what's in my heart I'm sure that you'd say no  
It's just another town that won't miss me  
You're just another girl that was kind enough to kiss me  
My mind says walk away why does my heart say stay  
After all it's just another town after all it's just another town
