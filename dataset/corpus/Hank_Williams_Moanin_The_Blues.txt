When my baby moved out and the blues moved in  
There wasn't nothin' I could do  
But mosey around with my head in my hands  
Lord what am I comin' to  
I just keep moanin'  
Moa-oanin' the blues.  
  
I wrote a nice, long letter  
Sayin' mama please come home  
Your dad-ad-dy is lon-one-some  
And all I [am] do is moan,  
I been lovin' that gal for so doggone long  
I can't afford to lose her now  
I thought I was right but I must of been wrong  
'Cause my head is startin' to bow  
And now I'm moanin'  
Moa-oanin' the blues.  
  
If you want a good gal to stay around  
You gotta treat her nice and kind  
If you do her wrong she'll leave this town  
And you'll almost lose your mind  
Then you'll moanin' moa-oanin' the blues.  
  
Aw! baby, baby, baby  
Honey baby, please come home  
Your dad-ad-dy is lon-one-some and all I do is moan  
I promise you baby that I'll be good  
And I'll never be bad no more  
I'm sittin' here waitin' for you right now  
To walk through that front door  
Then I'll stop moanin' moa-oanin' the blues.
