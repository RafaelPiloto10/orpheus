[Verse 1]  
This love is tainted, I need you and I hate it  
You're caught between a dream and a movie scene  
In a way, you know what I mean  
When the darts just miss, I just can't resist it  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause I'm a fool for you and the things you do  
I'm a fool for you and the things, the things you do  
The things you do  
The things you do  
  
[Verse 2]  
When you're looking like this, I just can't resist it  
I know sometimes I hide it  
But I can't this time cause it's gonna defeat me  
But you won't believe me, believe me  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause I'm a fool for you and the things you do  
I'm a fool for you and the things, the things you do  
  
[Bridge]  
I know, I know given the chance I'd do it again  
Cause I can't help myself  
Cause I can't stop myself  
I just love being a fool for you  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause I'm a fool for you and the things you do  
I'm a fool for you and the things, the things you do  
  
[Outro]  
This love is tainted
