In my darkness  
I hear Jesus crying  
In my darkness  
I see children savage and blind  
In my darkness  
I see dead men kneel before the cross  
In my darkness  
I hear the voice of evil  
  
Disciples, dark angels  
This is dominion day  
'My demons, come to me  
This is dominion day'  
  
In his darkness  
I can feel the storm come  
In his darkness  
Holy water burns my soul  
In his darkness  
A grave waits for you at heaven's gate  
In his darkness  
I hear screams that hide the voice of God  
  
'Come children of Eden  
Pray to me on dominion day'  
'Pray for your salvation  
Sanctuary on dominion day'  
My soul save me  
  
In his mercy  
He will bring the disease  
In his mercy  
He will burn the oceans  
In his mercy  
He will tear the sky down  
In his mercy  
He will make pain eternal  
  
'Your nightmare is breathing  
This is dominion day'  
Welcome to your saviour  
This is dominion day  
'This is my new kingdom  
This is dominion day'  
'Creation bleeds for me  
This is dominion day'
