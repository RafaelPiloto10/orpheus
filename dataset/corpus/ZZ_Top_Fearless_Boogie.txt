Call me a pretty boy, they call me a saint  
They call me a sinner, well it's gonna be the same  
'Cause I'm not afraid, and I'm not a-feared  
I ain't gonna lose it, and I'm not scared  
  
To do the fearless boogie, and do the fearless boogie  
Smokin' fearless boogie until it's gone  
  
They call me a Pontiac, the red in my neck  
Well they call me a Cadillac - they call me a wreck  
I'm not afraid,and I'm not scared  
I ain't gonna lose it, and I'm not a-feared  
  
To do the fearless boogie, and do the fearless boogie  
Smokin' fearless boogie until it's gone  
  
They call me a lover  
They call me a fool  
They call me a winner  
The call me a mule  
  
I do the fearless boogie - I do the fearless boogie  
Smokin' fearless boogie until it's gone  
  
Yeah, smoke it up boys  
It's all about the fearless boogie  
  
Good God good God almighty  
Good God good God almighty  
Good God good God almighty
