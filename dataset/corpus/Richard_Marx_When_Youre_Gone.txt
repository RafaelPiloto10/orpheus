Well look at me, the guy who's got it all  
Tryin' to read my own writing on the wall  
Not happy 'til the sadness comes  
To keep me company  
Oh, but what becomes of fools who love like me  
  
Who's gonna dry my tears  
When I'm crying?  
Who's gonna hold my hand  
When I'm dying?  
Who's gonna set me right when  
Everything is wrong  
Who's gonna love me  
When you're gone?  
  
Sure as winter goes and comes around again  
I will be my own undoing in the end  
I'll find the answers I've been searching for  
In your goodbye kiss  
Cause I don't deserve you and you don't deserve this  
  
Who's gonna dry my tears  
When I'm crying?  
And who's gonna hold my hand  
When I'm dying?  
Who's gonna set me right when  
Everything is wrong  
Yeah, who's gonna love me  
When you're gone?  
  
Never happy 'til the darkness comes  
And rains down on me  
Down on me  
  
And who's gonna dry my tears  
When I'm crying?  
And who's gonna hold my hand  
When I'm dying?  
Who's gonna set me right when  
Everything is wrong  
Who's gonna love me  
When you're gone?  
  
Who's gonna love me when you're gone?  
Baby when you're gone  
Yeah, who's gonna love me  
When you're gone?  
Who's gonna love me when you're gone?  
Who's gonna love me?
