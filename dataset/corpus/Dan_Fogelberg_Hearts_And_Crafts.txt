Handing me a looking glass  
You asked me who it was I saw  
But if I was to answer you  
You know I'd surely answer wrong  
  
'Cause I've loved you too long  
I've loved you too long  
  
Turning halfway toward the sun  
You asked me to become your shade  
But why should I be made to run  
At the end of the parade?  
  
Love is not that way at all  
Love is not that way  
  
Looking back now toward the start  
You said you thought I'd lost my path  
And I asked if you still considered love an art  
And you said, "No, I think it's more a craft"  
  
And I just turned and laughed  
I just had to turn and laugh
