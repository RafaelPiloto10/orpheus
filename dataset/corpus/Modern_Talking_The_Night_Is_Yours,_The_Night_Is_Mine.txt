The night is yours, the night is mine  
I beg you baby, take your time  
It's like paradise  
See your magic eyes  
Feel the need in me  
The night is yours, the night is mine  
I beg your baby, take your time  
Heaven in your eyes  
Takes me to the sky  
I'm in love with you  
  
Love takes time, it's hard to find  
That's true  
Not a game you play - a night or two  
Take my heart  
Let's make it real tonight  
We'll be dancin' to the pale moonlight  
Your dreams are real today  
And now you gonna stay  
  
I will try to make your dreams come true  
Trust me baby, nothing else will do  
There's no need for you to be so cool  
Love takes time just like the golden rule  
Your dreams are real today  
And now there gonna stay  
  
Girl, when I see you smile  
Imaginations running wild  
Love makes me feel alright  
Help me through the night  
Sometimes you're weak  
Sometimes you're wild  
You're a woman  
You're a child  
Love makes me feel alright, tonight
