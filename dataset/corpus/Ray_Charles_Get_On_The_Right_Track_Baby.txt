Get on the right track, baby  
Get on the right track, baby  
Get on the right track, baby, yeah  
Come on home and treat me wrong again  
Get on the right track, baby  
Get on the right track, baby  
Get on the right track, baby, yeah  
Come on home and treat me wrong again  
Yeah, I've been so blue and lonely  
I've tried both night and day  
But I'm beggin' you just one more time  
Come back if you don't stay  
Get on the right track, baby  
Get on the right track, baby  
Get on the right track, baby, yeah  
Come on home and treat me wrong again  
Yeah, I know you know I love you  
And yet you broke my heart in two  
But it's because I love you  
That I don't care what you do  
Get on the right track, baby  
You better come on, now  
Get on the right track, baby, yeah  
Come on home and treat me wrong again, oh yeah  
Well, I'm beggin' you one more time, baby  
Down on bended knees  
Please, please come back home  
And give my poor heart ease  
Get on the right track, baby  
Get on the right track, baby  
Get on the right track, baby, yeah  
Come on home and treat me wrong one more again  
That's what I say now
