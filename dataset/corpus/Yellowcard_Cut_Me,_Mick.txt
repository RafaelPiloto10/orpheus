I can't keep this together  
And I might lose this year  
I can't get through December  
And you know all my fears  
Some place somewhere behind me  
I walked right through the truth  
The truth is that you're the one thing  
That always pulls me through  
This troubled life I choose  
  
[Chorus:]  
You are the one that I need  
You know that I can still bleed  
Bring me back to life  
Bring me back to life  
You bring me down from my cloud  
You keep my feet on the ground  
Bring me back to life  
Bring me back to life  
  
When I thought that I might be invincible  
It wasn't long before I was invisible  
To your eyes, and I swear  
There's nothing left in here  
And the more you say you don't care  
The more I know you're there  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can't keep this together  
(You are the one that I need)  
I can't stay sick forever  
(You know that I can still bleed)  
I can't stop this disaster  
(You bring me down from my cloud)  
I can't fall any faster  
  
You are the one that I need  
You know that I can still bleed  
Bring me back to life  
Bring me back to life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You are the one that I need  
You know that I can still bleed  
You bring me down from my cloud  
You keep my feet on the ground
