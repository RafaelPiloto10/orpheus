You left him standing in the pouring rain.  
There's every chance he'll go insane.  
And someone comes along and takes his hand.  
He must have love, can't you understand, that  
  
[Chorus:]  
He needs his woman,  
He needs his woman,  
And he needs his woman,  
He needs his woman to love.  
  
His hands are shaking and his head hangs down.  
No peace of mind for him is found.  
Break his heart and then you'll set him free.  
Someone must save him, just you wait and see, but  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What will it take till you believe his love is real?  
Nobody said he had to love you, now he always will.  
  
He'll walk that lonely road again today.  
The love he gave you, you threw away.  
When all he wanted was a hand to hold.  
His lonely world has grown so cold, and  
  
[Chorus: x2]
