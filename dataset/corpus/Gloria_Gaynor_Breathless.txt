Intro:  
I'm short of breath I'm sweating cold.  
My hands are trembling I can't keep a hold.  
My knees are weak and they are shakin.  
My heart is hopelessly pounding.  
My mouth is dry my body s trembling.  
I'm feeling so breathlees.  
  
Chorus:  
You take my breath away.  
You take my breath away.  
You take my breath away.  
You are the magic that has come to me.
