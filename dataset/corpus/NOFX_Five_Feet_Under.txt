Five feet under, he's got one foot in the grave  
Would you look at him I think he's lost it  
I don't think that he can be saved  
  
He's got a down payment on his tombstone  
He's not alone his whole life has been out  
On a limb. Just look at him, watch  
Him get smashed and race bikes so fast  
Just don't laugh, what will it say on his epitaph  
Here he lies may he rest in peace  
Hung on to life by the skin of his teeth  
Pushing his luck through the bottle he drinks  
  
He's got a date with his maker and he  
Doesn't want to be late and make no mistake  
He's a good friend so why might his life  
Have to end, my friend I don't want to  
See you dead  
I don't want to see him dead!  
I don't want to see him dead!  
I don't want to see him dead!
