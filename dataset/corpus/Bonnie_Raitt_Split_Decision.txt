It was more than just any old Friday night fight  
With your mean left hook and my roundhouse right  
We were both goin' for the heavyweight crown  
T-K-O in the very first round  
  
Thought you were gettin' the best of me  
Floatin' like a butterfly, stingin' like a bee  
Thought a good fight would get it out of our system  
But we walked away with a split decision  
  
Well, when we first met, you were a real knockout  
I was head over heels, I was down for the count  
But gettin' along got harder and harder  
'Til we were nothin' more than sparrin' partners  
  
I did my best to roll with the punches  
You wore me out with fakin' and a-duckin'  
Almost put me outta commission  
But we walked away with a split decision  
  
Split decision  
Split decision  
Everybody lose and nobody winnin'  
Just too tough, I had enough  
Nobody oughta hafta fight for love  
We took a split decision

Whoa baby
