I wonder how I ever made it through a day  
How did I settle for a world in shades of gray  
When you go in circles all the scenery looks the same  
And you don't know how, then I looked into your eyes  
And the world stretched out in front of me and I realized  
  
[Chorus]  
I never lived before your love  
I never felt before your touch  
I never needed anyone to make me feel alive  
But then again, I wasn't really living  
I never lived, before your love  
  
I wanted more than just an ordinary life  
All of my dreams seemed like castles in the sky  
I stand before you and my heart is in your hands  
And I don't know how I survived without you kiss  
'Cause you've given me a reason to exist  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I don't know why  
Why the sun decides to shine  
But you breathed you love into me, just in time  
  
[Chorus]
