Don't ask me why  
You feel the need to cry  
Stop  
We don't need your sad, sad eyes  
I've been up, I've been down  
I've been wandering all around  
But it's all right  
I found out the hard way  
Is it love that makes  
Your world go 'round and 'round?  
Is it love that brings  
You to my lost and found?  
Around, around, around  
Around, around, around  
Around, around  
Is it you? Is it me?  
I'm my own worst enemy  
Got a start on the road  
To self-destruction, ooh, whoa  
Don't stop, but don't go,  
'Cause I really need to know  
What it takes just to make  
[Unverified] this world go, ooh  
Is it love that makes  
The world go 'round and 'round?  
Is it love that brings  
You to my lost and found?  
Around, around, around  
Around, around, around  
Around, around, around, around  
Ohh, is it love that makes  
Your world go 'round and 'round?  
Is it love that brings  
You to my lost and found?  
Around, around, around  
Around, around, around  
Around, around, around, around  
Is it love that makes  
The world go 'round and around?  
Is it love that brings  
You to my lost and found?  
Around, around, around  
Around, around, around  
Around, around, around, around  
Come around, come around  
Come around, around  
Come around, come around  
Come around, around  
Come around, come around  
Come around, around
