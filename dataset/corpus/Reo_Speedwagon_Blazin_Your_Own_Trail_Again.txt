Sooner or later you will find a way  
To feel like sunshine even on a cloudy day  
To feel like morning in the dead of night  
Sooner or later it's gonna be all right.  
  
Now don't go thinking your life's a mess  
Rather start thinkin' in terms of happiness  
  
And it's gonna happen  
Just decide were you're goin'  
Get out in the open  
And start blazin' your own trail again  
  
It takes time sometimes to figure out  
That there's nothing to worry about  
And that there's plenty to be thankful for  
It takes time sometimes to know the score  
  
See everybody's got a smile inside  
So put it upon your face and wear it with pride  
  
And it's gonna happen  
Just decide were you're goin'  
Get out in the open  
And start blazin' your own trail again
