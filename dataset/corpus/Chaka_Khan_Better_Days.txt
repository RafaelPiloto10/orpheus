It's not the way you smile that makes me realize  
I think I love you  
It just might be that all my life I've been searchin' for  
Someone just like you  
  
Takin' my time  
Everything's fine  
I call you by the phone  
Nobody's home  
  
We've got better days  
There'll be better days  
We've got better days  
Yeah  
  
I don't know why but I wanna cry  
Every time you touch me  
I've givin' up, just can't help it  
In your arms is where I'd rather be  
  
I just can't hide it  
So I decided to give  
Stored away, I've got the strength to live  
  
There'll be better days  
We've got better days  
There'll be better days  
Yeah  
  
Better days, better days  
(repeat)
