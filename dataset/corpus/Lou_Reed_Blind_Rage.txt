Who's that peeping through my door  
Sneaking up and down the hall  
I can't stand it anymore  
I can't stand it anymore  
Who's that peeping through my door  
Sneaking up and down the hall  
I can't stand it anymore  
I can't stand it anymore  
Blind rage, I'm in a blind rage  
Blind rage  
Blind rage  
Blind rage  
  
Who's that creeping in my room  
Blocking out the stars and moon  
I fear you will attack me soon  
Who goes there!!!
