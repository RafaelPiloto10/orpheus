If you want something to play with  
Go and find yourself a toy  
Baby, my time is too expensive  
And I'm not a little boy  
  
If you are serious  
Don't play with my heart, it makes me furious  
But if want me to love you  
Then, baby, I will, girl, you know I will  
  
Tell it like it is  
Don't be ashamed to let your conscience be your guide  
But I-I-I-I-I know deep down inside of me  
I believe you love me, forget your foolish pride  
  
Life is too short to have sorrow  
You may be here today and gone tomorrow  
You might as well get what you want  
So go on and live, baby, go on and live  
  
Tell it like it is  
I'm nothin' to play with, go and find yourself a toy  
But I-I-I-I-I  
Tell it like it is  
My time is too expensive  
And I'm not your little boy  
  
Mm mm, tell it like it is
