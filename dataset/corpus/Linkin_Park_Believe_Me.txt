(Yeah)  
  
[Chorus:]  
I guess,  
That this is where we've come to,  
If you don't want to,  
Then you don't have to,  
Believe me,  
But I, won't be there when you go down,  
Just so you know now,  
You're on your own now, believe me.  
  
(Yeah)  
  
I don't wanna be the one to blame,  
You like fun and games,  
Keep playin' them,  
I'm just sayin',  
Think back then,  
We was like one and the same,  
On the right track,  
But I was on the wrong train,  
It's like that,  
Now you've gotta face the pain,  
And the devil's got a fresh new place to play,  
In your brain, like a maze, you could never escape the rain,  
Every damn day's the same shade of grey,  
  
(Hey)  
  
I used to have a little bit of a plan,  
Used to, have a concept of where I stand,  
But that concept slipped right outta my hand,  
And now, I don't really even know who I am, yo,  
What do I have to say,  
Maybe, I should do what I have to do, to break free,  
And, whatever happens to you, we'll see,  
But it's not gonna happen with me,  
  
[Chorus:]  
I guess,  
That this is where we've come to (yeah),  
If you don't want to,  
Then you don't have to,  
Believe me,  
But I, won't be there when you go down (yeah),  
Just so you know now,  
You're on your own now, believe me.  
  
Back then, I thought you were just like me,  
Somebody who could see all the pain I see,  
But you proved to me, unintentionally,  
That you would self-destruct, eventually,  
Now I'm thinking like a mistake I made doesn't hurt, but,  
It's not gonna work,  
''cause it's really much worse than I thought,  
I wished you were something you were not,  
And now this guilt is really all that I've got, (all)  
  
You turn your back and walk away in shame,  
All you got is a memory of pain,  
Nothing makes sense if you stare at the ground,  
I hear my voice in your head when no-one else is around(else is around)  
So what do I have to say,  
Maybe, I should do what I have to do, to break free,  
And, whatever happens to you, we'll see,  
But it's not gonna happen with me,  
  
[Chorus:]  
I guess,  
That this is where we've come to (yeah),  
If you don't want to,  
Then you don't have to,  
Believe me,  
But I, won't be there when you go down (yeah),  
Just so you know now,  
You're on your own now, believe me.  
  
(Yeah!)  
  
(yeah)  
  
(Yo!)  
  
[Chorus:]  
I guess,  
That this is where we've come to (yeah),  
If you don't want to,  
Then you don't have to,  
Believe me,  
But I, won't be there when you go down (yeah),  
Just so you know now,  
You're on your own now, believe me.  
  
(I'll do what I have to do)  
You're on your own now, believe me.  
(Whatever happens to you)  
You're on your own now, believe me.  
(What do I have to say)  
You're on your own now, believe me.  
(It's not gonna happen to me)  
You're on your own now, believe me.
