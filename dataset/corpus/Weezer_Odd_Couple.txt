I got a PC, you got a Mac  
I'm giving you flak for your airport  
I read books and you watch TV  
You wanna be free to relax more  
  
But when I think about the other people I could see  
Nobody else out there could ever make me happy  
I wonder how we came to be  
  
The odd couple is what we are in reality  
But we are so happy in everything we do  
The odd couple is what they're saying of you and me  
But we know the feeling that we share is true  
  
Sometimes I want to strangle your neck  
Or write you a check to get going  
There's only so much more I can take  
I made a mistake without knowing  
  
But when I think about the way you little heart beats  
When I am holding you and you are holding onto me  
I wonder how we came to be  
  
The odd couple is what we are in reality  
But we are so happy in everything we do  
The odd couple is what they're saying of you and me  
But we know the feeling that we share is true  
  
I hope you know that I don't mean you disrespect  
I'm just pointing out, although the facts I double-checked  
Everyone can see that we ain't two peas in a pod  
But maybe that's our chemistry that takes us to the top  
  
I think it's working baby, that's the point I'm trying to make  
If I said something else to you then I would be a fake  
I wonder how we came to be  
I wonder how we came to be  
I wonder how we came to be  
  
The odd couple is what we are in reality  
But we are so happy in everything we do  
The odd couple is what they're saying of you and me  
But we know the feeling that we share is true  
The odd couple  
The odd couple  
The odd couple  
The odd couple  
  
Yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah
