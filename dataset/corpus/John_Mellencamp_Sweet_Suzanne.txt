Now, Right now,  
Look at the place I' m in,  
When I think about things that I could have done  
It's impossible for me tp pretend.  
But I see it now as the lights grow dim  
And the world starts to close it's eyes.  
I just wanted to say goodnight,  
Sweet Suzanne.  
I hear the music playin'  
But I no longer understand,  
Around the corner, down the street  
I'ts got to be better than where I am.  
I see it all now, as the light grows dim  
And the world starts to close it's eyes.  
I just wanted to say goodnight,  
Sweet Suzanne.  
I just wanted to say goodnight,  
Just wanted to see if everything was all right,  
Just wanted to say goodnight,  
Sweet Suzanne.  
Time goes by  
Oh, so quietly,  
Hazy days and memories  
And in the end there was only me.  
Wouldn't have been, I ask sometimes,  
But I see myself inside this rhyme.  
Enjoyed what I had back then,  
Would I do it again?  
Well, I see it now  
As the lights grow dim  
I just wanted to say goodnight,  
Sweet Suzanne.  
I just wanted to say goodnight,  
I just wanted to see if everything's all right  
Just wanted to say goodnight,  
Sweet Suzanne.  
I just wanted to say goodnight,  
I just wanted to see if everything' s all right,  
I just wanted to say goodnight,  
Sweet Suzanne.
