[Eddie:] "Hey, Sarge . . .  
Sing him a song, honey. He's earned it! Ha ha!"  
  
I'm gonna love you like nobody's loved you,  
Come rain or come shine.  
High as a mountain, deep as a river,  
Come rain or come shine.  
  
And I guess when you met me  
It was just one of those things.  
But don't ever bet me,  
'cause I'm gonna be true if you let me, let me.  
  
You're always gonna love me like nobody's loved me,  
Come rain or come shine.  
Happy together, unhappy together,  
And won't it be fine?  
  
Days may be cloudy or sunny.  
We're in or we're out of the money.  
But I'm with you always.  
I'm with you rain or shine.  
  
Days may be cloudy or sunny.  
We're in or we're out of the money.  
But I'm with you always.  
I'm with you rain or shine.  
Rain or shine.
