Oh! Mama, Mama look there!  
Your children are playing in that street again  
Don't you know what happened down there?  
A youth of fourteen got shot down there  
The Kokane guns of Jamdown Town  
The killing clowns, the blood money men  
Are shooting those Washington bullets again  
  
As every cell in Chile will tell  
The cries of the tortured men  
Remember Allende, and the days before,  
Before the army came  
Please remember Victor Jara,  
In the Santiago Stadium,  
Es verdad - those Washington Bullets again  
  
And in the Bay of Pigs in 1961,  
Havana fought the playboy in the Cuban sun,  
For Castro is a color,  
Is a redder than red,  
Those Washington bullets want Castro dead  
For Castro is the color...  
...That will earn you a spray of lead  
  
For the very first time ever,  
When they had a revolution in Nicaragua,  
There was no interference from America  
Human rights in America  
  
Well the people fought the leader,  
And up he flew...  
With no Washington bullets what else could he do?  
  
'N' if you can find a Afghan rebel  
That the Moscow bullets missed  
Ask him what he thinks of voting Communist...  
...Ask the Dalai Lama in the hills of Tibet,  
How many monks did the Chinese get?  
In a war-torn swamp stop any mercenary,  
'N' check the British bullets in his armory  
Que?  
Sandinista!
