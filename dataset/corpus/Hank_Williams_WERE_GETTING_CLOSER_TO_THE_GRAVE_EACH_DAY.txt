Oh, don't you know that  
Jesus died to wash your sins away  
Oh, please heed His call, in sin don't fall  
We're getting closer to the grave each day  
we're getting closer to the grave each day  
Mortal man, won't you stop now and pray  
Leave the road of sin alone, let Jesus lead you home  
We're getting closer to the grave each day  
They nailed His hands, they pierced His sides  
On His head the thorns did lay  
Be prepared to go, one thing we know  
We're getting closer to the grave each day  
On the judgment day, when the book is read  
There'll be no use to pray  
So each day you live, love and forgive  
We're getting closer to the grave each day
