I've taken so many down  
I've helped them all to dismount  
I've followed so many down  
I take their hand me downs  
All with hope  
All with hope  
That emptiness brings fullness  
And loss of love brings wholeness  
All with hope  
All with hope  
That emptiness brings fullness  
And loss of love brings wholeness  
To us all  
  
Everything that I believe  
Crawls from underneath the streets  
Everything I truly love  
Comes from somewhere far above  
Everything that I believe  
Is wrong with you is wrong with me  
Everything I truly love  
I love in you and I love in me  
So give me hope  
Give me hope  
That emptiness brings fullness  
And loss of love brings wholeness  
To us all  
  
You swear you can't swim the river  
(I've become the beggar now)  
(you've become the saint somehow)  
But I saw you running to jump in  
(I've become the beggar now)  
(you've become the saint somehow)  
I swore I'd never be your sinner  
(I've become the beggar now)  
(you've become the saint somehow)  
Til I held your sin  
Hand me downs  
  
Now you ask me why I'm here  
The same as you  
I'm scared, it's fear  
I've become the beggar now  
And you've become the saint somehow  
Twist the words and place the blame  
And tell me now aren't we the same  
Tripping in our yellow feet  
Checking underneath our sheets  
For some hope  
Give me hope  
That emptiness brings fullness  
And loss of love brings wholeness  
Give me hope  
Give me hope  
That emptiness brings fullness  
And loss of love brings wholeness  
To us all
