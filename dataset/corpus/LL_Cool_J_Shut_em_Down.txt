I can shut a nigga down so quick my sounds so sick  
My talents spread around while I'm holdin' my dick  
My dingling shit flip emaculate  
Evolutionary flows y'all want more dough  
Make wit the best get the best all the rest hit 'em less  
Rip a nigga from the East to the West  
Just a lyrical maze lyrical days  
God works in mysterious ways  
I'm the warlord of war relieve the raw dog  
Niggas ain't even comin' close to my low score  
Niggas fleein when I'm rippin' on the hard core beat  
That's slammin' through your jeep like a 44 Mack to your back  
Nigga L never got rip by a track  
I don't fuck around, always come back  
For the lyrical miracle day one platinum plaque right off the back  
Looked at every nigga wit the mic on my arm  
A time-bomb blowin' up ring the alarm  
Cool double O flow well to the LL  
I'm leave the world looking hard as hell  
  
I shut 'em down  
(Get off me! You can't hold me!)  
I shut 'em down  
(Get off me! You can't hold me!)  
I shut 'em down  
(Get off me! You can't hold me!)  
I shut 'em down  
(Get off me! You can't hold me!)  
I shut 'em down  
(Get off me! You can't hold me!)  
I shut 'em down  
(Get off me! You can't hold me!)  
I shut 'em down  
(Get off me! You can't hold me!)  
I shut 'em down  
(Get off me! You can't hold me!)  
  
To the next plateau niggas bet my flow  
Betta bet I role wit more control  
Gotta bring the heat that eliminate who can't compete  
Spit razors to rip the beat  
Relentless endless friendless when it comes to the lyrical mack  
Now off my back stack 'em drag 'em now feds waggin'  
Hear you fassen place on the blood of my veins without passion  
Mashin' take a little time to think the rhyme out  
How to find out  
Bump and grind out  
Pump the lines out  
I'ma show what the microphone is all about without doubt  
See to the double O bounce in the bubble eye limo  
No I ain't checkin' for you bull shit demo  
Every time you hear me in a battle I'm lethal  
Nigga too sweet 'n low you ain't equal  
  
I shut 'em down  
I shut 'em down  
I shut 'em down  
I shut 'em down  
I shut 'em down  
I shut 'em down  
I shut 'em down  
I shut 'em down (Get off me!, You can't hold me!)  
  
I can take you to the level if I let my phantom  
Nigga bout to rule the world wit one anthem  
Kidnapped rap for a handsome ransom  
Smoke a little Branson on the side of the mansion  
Keep it thugged out even when a nigga dancing  
Branson make that trans and keep it dancing  
I'ma murder every nigga in the game  
Can't stand the rain  
Fuck a maintain  
Gotta leave the world in flames  
Nigga want to live life stay out of my lanes  
Tryin' to read my name  
Here's a murderous combo wit you on your pain  
Sideways stimulator bringin' the flames  
Niggas want to feel me spit the whole clips  
Sing along it will split your lip  
45 wit' an name on the grip  
Niggas said you want to battle  
Nigga now talk shit  
  
I shut 'em down  
(Get off me! You can't hold me!)
