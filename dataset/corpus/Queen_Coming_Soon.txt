Ooh  
Oh Oh Oh  
I get some headaches when I hit the heights  
Like in the morning after crazy nights  
Like some mother in law in her nylon tights  
They're always  
They're always  
They're always  
They're always  
Coming soon  
Coming soon on the outside of the tracks  
You take 'em  
The same old babies with the same old toys  
The neighbors screaming when the noise annoys  
Somebody naggin' you when you're out with the boys  
They're always  
They're always  
They're always  
They're always  
Coming soon  
Coming soon on the outside of the track  
  
They're always  
They're always  
They're always  
They're always  
Coming soon  
Coming soon on the outside of the track  
Coming soon  
Coming soon on the outside of the track  
Yeah yeah yeah
