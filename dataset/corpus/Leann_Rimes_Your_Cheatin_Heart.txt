Your cheatin' heart  
Will make you weak  
Your cryin' crimes  
Try to sleep  
But sleep won't come  
The whole night through  
Your cheatin' heart  
Will tell on you  
  
When tears come down  
Like fallin' rain  
You'll toss around  
And call my name  
You'll walk the floor  
The way I do  
Your cheatin' heart  
Will tell on you  
  
Your cheatin' heart  
Will pain some day  
And crave the love  
You threw away  
The time will come  
When you'll be blue  
But your cheatin' heart  
Will tell on you  
  
When tears come down  
Like fallin' rain  
You'll toss around  
And call my name  
You're gonna walk the floor  
The way I do  
Your cheatin' heart  
Will tell on you  
  
Your cheatin' heart  
Is gonna tell on you
