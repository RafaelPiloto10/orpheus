I love the aspects of another city  
The representatives are alright  
In circulation the snake and the tiger  
Waking up and shaving in industrial life  
  
I broadcast  
Closing on another day now  
All for a cold sore  
Something out of nothing  
  
I love the aspects of another city  
It's got your number and your blood type  
They been intentious so need some focus  
The apparitions of another prodigal night, right?  
  
I broadcast  
Closing on another day now  
All for a high score  
Something out of nothing  
  
I broadcast  
  
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running  
  
I broadcast  
Closing on another day now  
All for a cold sore  
Something out of nothing  
  
I broadcast  
Closing on another day now  
All for a cold sore  
Something out of nothing
