Baby, won't you let me rock 'n' roll you  
Baby, won't you let me, let me stroll you  
Baby, won't you let me rock 'n' roll you now  
  
Baby, won't you let me, let me shake you  
Baby, won't you let me, let me break you  
Baby, won't you let me really take you now  
  
Well, you remember, baby, how it used to be  
I used to rock 'n' roll you around my knee  
Well, I tell you, honey, gonna be alright  
Gonna rock 'n' roll you all through the night  
  
Baby, won't you let me, let me shake you  
Baby, won't you let me, let me break you  
Baby, won't you let me really take you now  
  
I tell you, baby, gonna be alright  
I'm gonna rock you all through the night  
Well, you [Incomprehensible] how it's gonna be

Baby, won't you let me sock it to you  
Baby, won't you let me sock it to you  
Baby, won't you let me rock 'n' roll you now
