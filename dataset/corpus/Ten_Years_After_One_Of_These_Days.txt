One of these days, boy  
Gonna see my baby  
Gonna see my baby  
Coming down the road  
She'll have my pardon  
Pardon in her apron, oh, Lord  
Gonna see the governor  
Who said release my man  
  
She's coming down the road, boy  
She's coming down the road  
Red dress on, yeah  
She's got her red dress on  
She's coming down the road, boy  
She's coming down the road  
Her bags down low  
She's got her bags down low  
  
One of these days, boy  
Gonna see my woman  
She'll have my children  
Children on her knee  
I'll run up to my woman  
And hold her in my arms  
Tears in her eyes  
She says I'm glad you're free
