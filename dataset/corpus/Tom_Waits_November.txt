No shadow  
No stars  
No moon  
No care  
November  
It only believes  
In a pile of dead leaves  
And a moon  
That's the color of bone  
  
No prayers for November  
To linger longer  
Stick your spoon in the wall  
We'll slaughter them all  
  
November has tied me  
To an old dead tree  
Get word to April  
To rescue me  
November's cold chain  
  
Made of wet boots and rain  
And shiny black ravens  
On chimney smoke lanes  
November seems odd  
You're my firing squad  
November  
  
With my hair slicked back  
With carrion shellac  
With the blood from a pheasant  
And the bone from a hare  
  
Tied to the branches  
Of a roebuck stag  
Left to wave in the timber  
Like a buck shot flag  
  
Go away you rainsnout  
Go away, blow your brains out  
November
