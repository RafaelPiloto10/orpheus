Phone calls and taxi-rides  
And somebody's leaving  
Misunderstandings get out of control  
And the right words get left  
And the wrong words get spoken  
He's gone but not your pride  
Chorus  
Not much can help  
The full heart that's breaking  
Can't find the words  
And you can't hide the feelings  
And it's down to the bone  
To the heart of the matter  
You're free free as stone  
Look at you now  
You're the picture of sorrow  
Head in your hands  
Like a scene from a movie  
And all of the things  
That seemed so important  
Are leaves and are blowing away  
Chorus  
Nothing can help  
The full heart that's breaking  
You can't find the words  
And you can't hide the feelings  
And it's down to the bone  
To the heart of the matter  
You're free free as stone  
Walk through this town  
On a cold Sunday morning  
Soldiers in uniforms  
Guns in their hands  
The world all caught up  
With barbed wire fences  
I'm free I'm free as stone  
Chorus  
Oh nothing can help  
The full heart that's breaking  
Won't find the words  
And you can't hide the feelings  
And it's down to bone  
To the heart of the matter  
You're free free as stone  
You're free free as stone
