You take a stroll into the morning sun  
You make a Happy Meal a portion for one  
  
You steal the wallet of a man with a gun  
You make this seem like a whole lot of fun  
Yeah you do  
  
You'll make new shapes with your hands on a wall  
You're driving a nail while you're taking a call  
You wouldn't care if you had nothing at all  
Instead of chasing the dream  
You're just chasing a ball  
Yeah you are  
  
You're just dodging all the friendly fire  
You're never dressed in the right attire  
You miss the start of every game  
You're my flame  
  
You make hay when the sun don't shine  
You don't need a dollar, you don't need a dime  
You burn at both ends yet still you're fine  
You're my flame  
  
Teach me to haggle  
I'll teach you to swim  
Get right back on the saddle  
Push me on a swing  
  
Take me to Rio  
I'll take you to Berlin  
I'll give you some yarn  
And you'll give it some spin  
Yes you will  
  
Now you're sitting sure, yes, in an old tree  
You've tied our legs, and so now we have three  
You dip your toes into the ice cold sea  
I see your reflection, your reflection is me  
Yes I am  
  
You're just dodging all the friendly fire  
You're never dressed in the right attire  
You miss the start of every game  
You're my flame  
  
You make hay when the sun don't shine  
You don't need a dollar, you don't need a dime  
You burn at both ends yet still you're fine  
You're my flame  
  
You're my flame  
You're my flame  
You're my flame  
  
You're my flame  
You're my flame  
You're my flame
