American pride something you feel inside  
Something you can't describe American pride  
Dad said, "Son I'm proud you won  
But the game is more than any toy"  
Mama said, "Now Son say sir and say ma'am  
And be proud you're southern born"  
You play when you're hurt and you work when you're tired  
'Cause that was Grandpa's way  
And the biscuits are better at Granny's house  
And the gravy taste great all day  
American pride yes it is something you feel inside  
Something you can't describe, something you cannot hide  
American pride something you feel inside  
Traditions run deep and wide with American pride  
When a baby is born we all celebrate  
With tears of joy in family eyes  
'Cause we all know the baby will grow up with American pride  
Yeah we work and we play and we have our own ways  
And we don't all look alike  
But if the cause is right we stand up and fight  
To protect our American pride  
Sing it, sing it, sing it  
American pride yes it is something you feel inside  
It's something you can't describe, it's something you can't hide  
American pride something you feel inside  
Traditions run deep and wide with American pride  
With American pride, it's American pride
