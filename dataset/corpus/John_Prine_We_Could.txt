If anyone could find the joy  
That true love brings a girl and boy  
We could  
We could you and I  
  
If anyone could ever say  
Their true love was here to stay  
We could  
We could you and I  
  
When you're in my arms  
I know you're happy to be there  
And just as long as I'm with you  
I'm happy anywhere  
  
If anyone could pray each night  
To thank the lord that all is right  
We could  
We could you and I  
  
When you're in my arms  
I know you're happy to be there  
And just as long as I'm with you  
I'm happy anywhere  
  
If anyone could pray each night  
To thank the lord that all is right  
We could  
We could you and I  
We could  
We could you and i
