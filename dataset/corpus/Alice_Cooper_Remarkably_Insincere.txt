Yeah, I'm such a liar  
One time I told you  
You were the highlight  
Of all of my sexual life  
  
While I'm confessing  
When you're undressing  
I was picking the lock  
On your safe with my knife  
Einstein  
  
If you're so naive  
That you believe  
Everything I said to you  
Well, I got your sex  
And wrote you rubber checks  
Well, what did you think  
I was gonna do  
  
My reputation for exaggeration  
It never got to you  
That's why I left Duluth  
Sometimes I stretch the truth  
  
My dearest darling  
You know that luggage  
It belonged to the blond  
With the really nice pair  
And incidentally  
I sorely missed you  
The pain was so hard to bear  
  
If I would rate you  
Not that I hate you  
But you would end up  
Eighth, maybe ninth in your class  
  
Your build is hot now  
If you could use your  
Brain like you use your ass  
  
Oh, you're so naive  
How could you believe  
Everything I said to you  
  
My reputation for exaggeration  
It never got to you  
Sometimes I'm so uncouth  
Sometimes I stretch the truth  
  
Hey, I'm such a liar  
One time I told you  
You were the highlight  
Of all of my sexual life  
  
I'm remarkably insincere  
Incredibly insincere  
Totally insincere  
Oh don't take it so hard, my dear  
I'm consistently insincere
