I gave my love a cherry  
That had no stone  
I gave my love a chicken  
That had no bone  
I told my love a story  
That had no end  
I gave my love a baby  
With no crying.  
How can there be a cherry  
That has no stone?  
And how can there be a chicken  
That has no bone?  
And how can there be a story  
That has no end?  
And how can there be a baby  
With no crying?  
  
A cherry when it's blooming  
It has no stone  
A chicken when it's pippin'  
It has no bone  
The story that I love you  
It has no end  
A baby when it's sleeping  
It's no crying.
