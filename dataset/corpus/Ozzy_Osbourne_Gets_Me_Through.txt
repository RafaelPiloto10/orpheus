I'm not the kind of person you think I am,  
I'm not the anti-christ or the iron man...  
I have a vision that I just can't control...  
I feel I've lost my spirit and sold my soul....  
  
Got no control!  
  
I try to entertain you the best I can  
I wish I'd started walking before I ran  
But I still love the feeling I get from you,  
I hope you'll never stop 'cause' it gets me through yeah...  
It gets me through yeah...  
  
The feelings that I hide behind  
Sometimes reality's unkind  
The nightmares stalk for me at night  
I dread the long and lonely nights  
  
I'm not the kind of person you think I am,  
I'm not the anti-christ or the iron man...  
But I still love the feeling I get from you...  
I hope you'll never stop 'cause' it gets me through yeah...  
  
I'm... just trying live yeah  
I'm... just trying live yeah  
I'm... just trying live yeah  
I'm... just trying live yeah
