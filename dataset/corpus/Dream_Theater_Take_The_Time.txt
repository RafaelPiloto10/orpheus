(Hold it now)  
(Wait a minute)  
(Come on! whew)  
Just let me catch my breath  
I've heard the promises  
I've seen the mistakes  
I've had my fair share of tough breaks  
I need a new voice, a new law, a new way  
Take the time, reevaluate  
It's time to pick up the pieces  
Go back to square one  
I think it's time for a change  
  
There is something that I feel  
To be something that is real  
I feel the heat within my mind  
And craft new changes with my eyes  
Giving freely wandering promises  
A place with decisions I'll fashion  
I won't waste another breath  
  
You can feel the waves coming on  
(It's time to take the time)  
Let them destroy you or carry you on  
(It's time to take the time)  
You're fighting the weight of the world  
But no one can save you this time  
Close your eyes  
You can find all you need in your mind  
  
The unbroken spirit obscured and disquiet  
Finds clearness this trial demands  
And at the end of this day sighs an anxious relief  
For the fortune lies still in his hands  
If there's a pensive fear, a wasted year  
A man must learn to cope  
If his obsession's real  
Suppression that he feels must turn to hope  
  
Life is no more assuring than love  
(It's time to take the time)  
There are no answers from voices above  
(It's time to take the time)  
You're fighting the weight of the world  
And no one can save you this time  
Close your eyes  
You can find all you need in your mind  
  
I close my eyes  
And feel the water rise around me  
Drown the beat of time  
Let my senses fall away  
I can see much clearer now I'm blind  
  
(Ora che ho perso la vista)  
(Ci vedo di piu)  
  
You can feel the waves coming on  
(It's time to take the time)  
Let them destroy you or carry you on  
(It's time to take the time)  
You're fighting the weight of the world  
But no one can save you this time  
Close your eyes  
You can find all you need in your mind  
  
Find all you need in your mind  
If you take the time  
Find all you need in your mind  
If you take the time
