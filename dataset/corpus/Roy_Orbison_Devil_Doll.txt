Devil Doll..........Devil Doll  
We went steady in the fall,  
We broke up in the spring  
Your young lovin blinds,  
And you gave me back my ring  
Well I see now what my friends saw then,  
That you're just not the one  
To love someone true  
The way I love you,  
Oh devil doll  
Now I'm not the first one  
And I won't be the last,  
You'll make my heart  
Just another heart you've broken in the past  
Don't play a game with another guy,  
Don't make me feel so blue,  
I'm a guy that's true and I love you  
Oh devil doll  
Now I'm not the first one  
Don't let me be the last,  
Don't make my heart  
Just another heart you've broken in the past,  
Don't play a game with another guy,  
Don't make me feel so blue,  
I'm a guy that's true and I love you  
Oh devil doll (devil doll)
