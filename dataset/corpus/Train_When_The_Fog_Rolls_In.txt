Driving over the bridge to give you my kiss  
I know you don't love me, I know it ain't easy!  
Friends become lovers, and lovers lose friends  
That's when the fog rolls in!  
Oh, oh, oh  
I'm losing you!  
Oh, oh, oh  
You're losing me too!  
  
In through the kitchen where we used to laugh,  
Smells of your cooking, sounds of the past  
Somehow we got older, the air just got colder  
That's when the fog rolls in!  
Oh, oh, oh  
I'm losing you!  
Oh, oh, oh  
You're losing me too!  
  
So much for sowing up  
So this is growing up  
Everything is going up for sale  
The fog kept on rolling in  
The time came to sink or swim  
They say it's better to try and fail  
And we tried like hell  
  
I take a deep breath with my hand on the door  
Afraid cause I'm not gonna see you anymore  
These were our tender years, this was our street  
All of our stop lights and all our concrete  
Now it's all somebody else's to take  
Until the fog rolls in
