High climbs the summer sun  
High stands the corn  
And tonight when my work is done  
We will borrow your father's carriage  
We will drink and prepare for marriage  
Soon my darling, soon my darling  
  
[Chorus:]  
Shilling for the fellow who brings the sheep in  
Shilling for the fellow who milks the herd  
Shilling for the fellow with a wife for keeping  
How can we feed love on a farmboy's wages?  
  
Deep under winter snow  
Deep lay the lambs  
And tonight by the full moon's glow  
Flask of wine on my feather bedding  
We will drink and prepare for wedding  
Soon my darling, soon my darling  
  
[Chorus]  
  
People think that I'm no good  
Painting pictures carving wood  
Be a rich man if I could  
But the only job I do well is here on the farm  
On the farm  
And it's breaking my back  
  
We will borrow your father's carriage  
We will drink and prepare for marriage  
Soon my darling, soon my darling  
  
[Chorus]
