Gotta talk to you baby  
Talk to you now  
Maybe it's too late  
You're slamming the door  
You're walking out  
  
[Chorus]  
I got a feeling  
Feelings don't lie  
Don't let the words escape me now  
Escape me now  
Escape me now  
  
Gotta talk to you baby  
Talk to you now  
Say it isn't too late  
You'll see me again  
We'll work it out  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Gotta talk to you baby  
Talk to you now  
Say it isn't too soon  
You'll see me again  
We'll sort it out  
  
[Chorus]
