By Woody Guthrie  
Ramblin' around your city  
Ramblin' around your town  
I never see a friend I know  
As I go ramblin' 'round boys  
As I go ramblin' 'round  
My mother hoped that I might be  
A man of some renown  
But I am just a refugee  
As I go ramblin' 'round boys  
As I go ramblin' 'round  
The peach trees they are loaded  
The branches bending down  
I pick 'em all day for a dollar boys  
As I go 'ramblin 'round  
As I go 'ramblin' 'round  
Sometimes the fruit gets rotten  
And falls on to the ground  
There's a hungry mouth for every peach  
As I go ramblin' 'round boys  
As I go ramblin' 'round
