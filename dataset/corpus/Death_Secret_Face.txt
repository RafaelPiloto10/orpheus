There is a mask  
That covers up one's true intentions  
Once removed, things become very clear  
Analyze behavior patterns to see beneath  
  
The person that is presented to you  
Vulnerable through trust  
Life is a twisted maze of obstacles  
Presented by people with a secret face  
  
What's on the outside  
Is not always all that is real  
Live by caution, what I feel  
When things are reversed  
  
People are shown for what they are  
The truth is revealed  
Banish the false  
Pacifying moments with an acquired disguise to obtain  
  
The things they want  
By the anguish of someone else  
Materialistic motives are fulfilled  
Cherish the true  
  
Vulnerable through trust  
Life is a twisted maze of obstacles  
Presented by people with a secret face
