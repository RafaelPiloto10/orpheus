Dreadful Thunder  
The storms moving in  
And Judgment day is calling  
My soul has been healed  
By the power of steel  
And the sound of glory  
  
I will send into the ground  
All that are found  
By the sign of the hammer falling  
Yes Heathens will fall  
I will strike down them all  
Then you will know my calling  
  
Bravery calls my name  
In the sound of the wind in the night  
My sword will drink blood  
And I will fight  
Yes I will fight  
In the dawn of battle  
Dawn of Battle  
  
I will rise up from the chaos  
I will rise up from the grave  
A brother to the darkness  
A master to the slaves  
  
I am the soul descendent  
Of the fire and the rage  
I was wrought upon the earth  
Born to rule and battle wage  
  
By the total domination  
Of the world in my command  
By the Air and the water  
By the Fire and the land  
  
I give no explanation  
I was branded by the will  
Bringer of Death and Destruction  
To all that I now kill  
  
Bravery calls my name  
In the sound of the wind in the night  
My sword will drink blood  
And I will fight  
Yes I will fight  
In the dawn of battle  
Dawn of Battle  
  
I long to be free  
So I wait for a sign  
I wait for a star  
To fall from the sky  
From the dust of sleep  
A promise to keep  
Then all who see shall believe  
Deliver into my hand  
The sword of the land  
Let my journey begin  
So all shall understand  
That if I fall  
I will live again  
  
I will rise up from the chaos  
I will rise up from the grave  
A brother to the darkness  
A master to the slaves  
  
I give no explanation  
I was branded by the will  
To bring of Death and Destruction  
To all that I now kill  
  
Bravery calls my name  
In the sound of the wind in the night  
My sword will drink blood  
And I will fight  
Yes I will fight  
In the dawn of battle
