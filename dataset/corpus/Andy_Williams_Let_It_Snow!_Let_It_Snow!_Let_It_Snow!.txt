Oh, the weather outside is frightful  
But the fire is so delightful  
Since we've no place to go  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
It doesn't show signs of stoppin'  
And I brought some corn for poppin'  
The lights are turned down low  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
When we finally kiss good night  
How I'll hate goin' out in the storm  
But if you really hold me tight  
All the way home I'll be warm  
  
The fire is slowly dying  
And, my dear, we're still good-bye-in'  
But as long as you love me so  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
(When we finally kiss good night)  
How I'll hate goin' out in the storm  
(But if you really hold me tight)  
All the way home I'll be war-are-arm  
  
The fire is slowly dying  
And, my dear, we're still good-bye-in'  
But as long as you love me so  
Let it snow, let it snow  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
Let it snow
