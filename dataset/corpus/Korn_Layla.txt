Once more the pain is thrown my way  
Can't she stay away  
Every single time  
She's fucking with my mind  
Built up all this rage  
I'm trapped inside some cage  
While she sits and smiles  
Layla  
Layla  
Once more [incomprehensible] face  
Why am I the one to blame  
Every single time  
She's screwing up my mind  
A pest in a locked up cage  
In your life born and aged  
Why can't I stand up and just say "good bye"  
Layla  
Layla  
Pain and rage and fear I feel  
Pain and rage and fear I feel  
Pain and rage and fear I feel  
Pain and rage and fear I feel  
Pain and rage and fear I feel  
Pain and rage and fear I feel  
Pain and rage and fear I feel  
Pain and rage  
Once more pain is thrown my way  
Can't she stay away  
Every single time  
She's fucking with my mind  
Built up all this rage  
Trapped inside some cage  
Life's not meant this way!  
Layla  
Layla  
Inside I'm afraid  
Afraid of who I am  
Can't you even feel?  
You've taken who I am  
I have fought to find a way  
I am afraid  
To feel who I am  
Fuck!  
Layla  
Layla  
That's why I cry  
This lie I drown
