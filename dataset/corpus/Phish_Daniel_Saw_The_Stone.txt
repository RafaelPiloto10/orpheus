Oh Daniel saw the stone that was hewed out the mountain  
Daniel saw the stone that came rolling through Babylon  
Daniel saw the stone that was hewed out the mountain  
Coming down to redeem a mighty world  
[repeat above 4 lines]  
  
Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me  
Meet me in the middle of the air  
'Cause now if these wings should fail me  
Lord, I want to hitch on another pair  
  
Oh Jesus was the stone that was hewed out the mountain  
Jesus was the stone that came rolling through Babylon  
Jesus was the stone that was hewed out the mountain  
Coming down to redeem a mighty world  
[repeat above 4 lines]  
  
Oh, well the tree it was bending  
Up in the heavenly land  
Well, my God spoke unto the Holy Ghost  
He said, "Come on and let's make man"  
  
I'm looking for the stone that was hewed out the mountain  
I'm looking for the stone that came rolling through Babylon  
I'm looking for the stone that was hewed out the mountain  
Coming down to redeem a mighty world  
[repeat above 4 lines]  
  
Well, now, early in the morning the trumpet's gonna sound  
The dead and Christ is gonna rise  
Well, if you ain't got good religion  
Lord, then hell you'll open your eyes  
  
I found that stone that was hewed out the mountain  
I found the stone that came rolling through Babylon  
I found the stone that was hewed out the mountain  
Coming down to redeem a mighty world  
[repeat above 4 lines]  
  
Well, I saw a weary traveler  
He was walking on down the road  
Well, I saw him later that evening  
He was walking on down that road  
  
"walk, walk, walk..."
