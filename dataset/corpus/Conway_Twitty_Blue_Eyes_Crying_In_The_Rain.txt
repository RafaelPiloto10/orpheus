Just two kids from the country, far from any town  
And wherever I played Rose could always be found  
Life was hard but we made it and as everyone knows  
I was there when she needed me, a playmate of Rose  
  
Now years have passed, things have changed  
Since we moved into town  
The little girl I grew up with is your woman now I found  
  
And now the sidewalks of the city where  
Wild temptation flows  
Is her new playground and the playmates of Rose  
  
So if you're the one that's holdin' her tight  
Somewhere out there tonight  
Please don't treat her as if she's just another girl  
From off the street  
  
And please, don't do her wrong  
For her pride is almost gone  
For you see Rose means the world to me  
  
I love the girl you found out in the world  
The girl that every man knows  
But I love her today so different from your way  
For you see, I'm the brother of Rose
