You came 'round today  
You never even knocked on my door  
Your note tried to say  
That you don't love me no more  
  
Bridge:  
I want you by my side cause  
I want to be your man  
I'm burning up inside cause  
I want to be your man  
  
I had to be told  
From people that I meet in the street  
They are turning cold  
Without you I would not be complete  
  
I want you by my side cause  
I want to be your man  
I'm burning up inside cause  
I want to be your man  
  
Why did you write me in a letter  
A word from you would be much better  
  
I want you by my side cause  
I want to be your man  
I'm burning up inside cause  
I want to be your man  
  
Don't cast me aside  
Without you I could never survive  
Why did you decide  
To kill the love that keeps me alive  
  
I want you by my side cause  
I want to be your man  
I'm burning up inside cause  
I want to be your man
