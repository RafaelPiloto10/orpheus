You said, "Young man, don't rely on a sword,  
Cause your words will outlive even time."  
I've counted my blessings. The rest are for you.  
Please listen close for a while,  
And breathe, breathe, deep for me James.  
Don't you feel that you're free now from pain?  
I've heard about heaven for years.  
Can't be sure where you are, wander on blessed James.  
I'm fine with you here.  
  
I made the mistake once of fearing an end.  
Is this life that we live just the world's accident?  
Not a chance, so I move on with a smile.  
Are you surprised where you are?  
So breathe, breathe, deep for me James.  
Don't you feel that you're free now from pain?  
I've heard about heaven for years.  
Can't be sure where you are, wander on blessed James.  
I'm fine with you here.  
  
I grew up slow on the heels of the rest.  
Left my heart back at home, carried you in my chest.  
And I don't feel like crying today.  
Why can't we talk for awhile?  
And breathe, breathe, deep for me James.  
Don't you feel that you're free now from pain?  
I've heard about heaven for years.  
Can't be sure where you are, wander on blessed James.  
I'm fine with you here.  
  
You said, "Son, just listen to me."  
But I'm doing fine, James.  
So you can sit back and just breathe.  
And it's time now to let yourself go.  
Hold us close, spin the dream,  
The curtain will fall but behind it I see that you're here.
