This is the most unusual story  
Of a most unusual girl  
She's the paint in my picture  
Of a most unusual world  
  
She can crawl out a frame  
While she's hanging on the wall  
And she's calling my name  
She's not so usual  
  
She's most unusual  
She's not so usual  
She's so unusual  
  
She's mostly a ghost  
The way she watches over me  
She complains when I smoke  
But then you do the same to me  
  
She's controlling my brain activity  
Knowing when I go to sleep  
She'll catch me when I'm falling hard  
She's so unusual  
  
She's not usual  
She's not usual  
She's so unusual  
  
She's not so  
Hooked on the drugs like I thought she was  
And never suckin' on the lime and hardly sippin' on the wine  
And despite  
Of her bi-polar roller coastering  
I think I can trust she'll keep me singing differently  
  
And that's fine  
'Cause she's with me now most all of the time  
  
Trying and savin' the light  
Thinking not of her own  
And always kissing me goodnight  
When I just need to be alone  
She's so sweet  
So discrete  
-She's exactly what I need  
Not even make believe...  
  
She's not so usual...  
  
She's so unusual  
She's not so usual  
So unusual  
  
Oh, Not so usual  
And not too practual either,  
  
What's that, she's  
Not so mystical  
But not too magical neither,  
  
I said she's  
Not so out of control  
And not so used to the full  
  
She's not so usual  
  
Now she's a natural  
  
Oh she's not so  
Usual  
  
Shes most usual  
  
She's not so usual  
  
Shes so unusual  
  
Shes gonna use me up  
  
Shes not so you  
Shes not so you  
Not so you  
Not so"
