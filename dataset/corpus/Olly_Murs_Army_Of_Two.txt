I came, I saw, tore down these walls  
Block one way, I'll find another  
You know you'll always be discovered  
If it's me, you choose, I can't lose  
I'm in love with you if you love me too, yeah  
  
Don't ever change, and I'll stay the same  
We'll be swimming in the same direction  
And we'll never lose this connection  
Nothing they can do can stop this army of two  
We're marching to the future, yeah, it's me and you  
  
So just follow my lead, repeat after me  
Our faith is the bullet, hope is the gun  
And love is all we need  
Now fear's on the run  
We've already won  
Now march with the band, raise your right hand  
We've only just begun  
  
I took a vow to never let you down  
When it's us, there ain't no competition  
I can be the star on which you're wishing  
I never doubted for a moment it's true  
I love all of you if you love me too, yeah  
  
Don't ever change, and I'll stay the same  
We'll be swimming in the same direction  
And we'll never lose this connection  
Nothing they can do can stop this army of two  
We're marching to the future, yeah, just me and you  
  
So just follow my lead, repeat after me  
Our faith is the bullet, hope is the gun  
And love is all we need  
Now fear's on the run  
We've already won  
Now march with the band, raise your right hand  
We've only just begun  
  
Only just begun, only just begun, only just begun  
  
So don't ever change, and I'll stay the same  
We'll be swimming in the same direction  
And we'll never lose this connection  
Nothing they can do can stop this army of two  
'Cause we're marching to the future, it's me and you  
  
So just follow my lead, repeat after me  
Our faith is the bullet, hope is the gun  
And love is all we need  
Now fear's on the run  
We've already won  
Now march with the band, raise your right hand  
We've only just begun  
  
It's the moment of truth, I'm counting on you  
This army of two I've only just begun  
It's the moment of truth, I'm counting on you  
This army of two I've only just begun
