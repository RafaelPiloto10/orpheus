With my ego in my gut  
My babbling mouth would wash it up  
(But now I've started learning how)  
I keep it shut  
  
My door was never locked  
Until one day a trigger come, cocking  
(But now I've started learning how)  
I keep it shut  
  
Wide eyes would clean and dust  
Things that decay, things that rust  
(But now I've started learning how)  
I keep 'em shut  
I keep 'em shut  
  
Harm is in us  
Harm is in us, but power to arm  
Harm is in us  
Harm in us, but power to arm  
Harm is in us  
("Leave it open!")  
Harm is in us, but power to arm  
  
Narrow mind would persecute it  
Die a little to get to it  
(But now I've started learning how)  
I leave it open  
  
I kept it in a cage  
Watched it weeping, but I made it stay  
(But now I've started learning how)  
I leave it open  
I leave it open  
  
Harm is in us  
Harm in us, but power to arm  
Harm is in us  
Harm in us, but power to arm  
  
Harm is in us  
("Leave it open!")  
Harm in us, but power to arm  
Harm is in us  
Harm in us, but power to arm  
Harm is in us  
("Leave it open!")  
Harm in us, but power to arm  
Harm is in us  
Harm in us, but power to arm  
Harm is in us  
Har in us, but power to arm  
Harm is in us [Repeat: x6]  
Harm in you and in me!  
  
What you letting in?  
Tell me what you're letting in.  
Say what we're gonna let in!  
  
"We let the weirdness in.  
We let the weirdness in.  
We let the weirdness in.  
We let the weirdness in.  
We let the weirdness in."
