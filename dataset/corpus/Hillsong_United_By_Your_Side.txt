Oh dear God we ask for your favour  
Come and sweep through this place  
Oh we desire You  
  
I just want to be with You be where You are  
Dwell in your presence oh God  
Oh I want to walk with You  
  
And I will climb this mountain  
And I'll step of the shore  
And I have chosen to follow  
And be by Your side forever more  
  
Tell me what You want me to do Lord God  
Tell me what You want for my life  
Its Your's Oh God it's Yours  
Do your will  
Have Your way  
Be Lord God in this place  
Oh I want Your will to be done
