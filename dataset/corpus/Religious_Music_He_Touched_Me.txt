Shackled by a heavy burden  
'Neath a load of guilt and shame  
Then the hand of Jesus touched me  
And now I am no longer the same.  
  
He touched me, oh He touched me  
And oh the joy that floods my soul  
Something happened and now I know  
He touched me and made me whole.  
  
Since I've met the blessed Savior  
Since He's cleansed and made me whole  
I will never cease to praise Him  
I'll shout it while eternity rolls.  
  
He touched me, oh He touched me  
And oh the joy that floods my soul  
Something happened and now I know  
He touched me and made me whole.
