You ask me if I've met your baby  
I have to say  
It's been some time now  
Seems like yesterday  
He was mine  
For a while  
We had good times  
We went in style  
But now he's yours  
Treat him kind  
Yes I remember well when  
He was mine  
You say he means the world to you  
Well yes I can tell  
You'll make each other happy  
I wish you well  
He was mine  
For a while  
We had good times  
We went in style  
But now he's yours  
Treat him kind  
Yes I remember well when  
He was mine  
Yes I remember well when  
He was mine  
He was mine  
He was mine  
He was mine  
He was mine
