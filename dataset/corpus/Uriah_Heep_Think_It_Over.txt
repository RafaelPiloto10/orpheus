I've had all I can take  
I've taken just too much  
I've made a big mistake  
That put me out of touch  
I don't think I can face  
Another single day  
Without a call from you  
To take this pain away  
  
So many tears ago  
You turned and walked away  
It could've been the end  
But I knew better  
I had to tell myself  
There'll be another day  
She wants to call it quits  
But don't you let her  
  
Can't you see  
There's a chance for you and me  
Think it over  
Don't believe  
In the things that may not be  
Think it over  
  
Why don't you think it over  
Forgetting you is out  
I ain't givin' in  
The fuss was down to you  
But it's not over  
You have to face the truth  
I'm still in love with you  
I have to make you see  
That it's not over  
  
Why don't you think about it, babe
