Sittin' in your front yard, drinkin' lemonade  
Suburban life, a pretty wife, you think you've got it made  
But you don't know, what's in store, for you and your family  
I'm movin' in, right next door, won't you welcome me?  
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood  
And I hope I didn't ruin your day  
Won't you be my neighbor?  
  
I brought my life, my ugly wife, my dirty dog with fleas  
My kid's a punk, and I'm a drunk, this I'm sure you'll see  
Yeah you don't know, what it's like, to live in misery  
Welcome to, home sweet hell, dissatisfaction guaranteed  
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood  
And if I could I surely would  
Invite you in and say  
Won't you be my neighbor?  
Won't you be my neighbor?  
Won't you be my neighbor?  
Won't you be my neighbor?  
  
C'mon I don't think you'll find  
A place to live in peace of mind  
You're gonna live in misery  
When you're livin' next to me  
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood  
Won't you be my, won't you be my fuckin' neighbor?  
  
Well I drink, and I stink, I smoke, yeah I'm a joke  
I try all night and day to get a piece of the action, a-haa  
And you should know by now you're never gonna forget, a-aaa  
Now I know just what you're thinkin'  
It could be out 'n' you're drinkin'  
So don't you knock it until you try it  
It could be you in a little while  
I hope I didn't ruin your day  
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood  
And I dig your wife, she sure is good  
It's a beautiful day in the neighboorhood
