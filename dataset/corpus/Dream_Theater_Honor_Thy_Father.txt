We're taught unconditional love,  
That blood is thicker than water,  
That a parent's world would revolve,  
Always around their son or their daughter.  
You pretend I was your own,  
And even believed that you loved me.  
But were always threatened by some  
Invisible blood line that only you could see.  
  
You took advantage of an outreached hand  
And twisted it to meet your every need  
"Gimme time to recharge my batteries,  
I'll see her when she's older  
And I'll bounce her on my knee"  
  
Well listen to me you ungrateful fool,  
Here comes a dose of reality.  
You'll go to your grave a sad and lonely man,  
The door is now closed on your  
Pathetic little plan.  
  
On and on and on an don it goes,  
It's so easy to run away with  
Nothing in tow.  
  
How can you ever sleep a wink at night,  
Pretending that everything is alright,  
And have the nerve to blame this mess on me?  
Never in my life have I seen someone  
So Ignorant to the damage he has done.  
You're the rotted root in the family tree.  
  
I tried your 4 bill therapy,  
I tried to make amends.  
But nothing could lure you out of your  
Selfish shell again.  
Expecting everyone  
To bow and kiss your feet.  
Don't you see respect is not a  
One way street?  
Blaming everyone,  
For all that you've done wrong.  
I'll get my peace of mind when you  
Hear this song.  
  
On and on and on and on it goes,  
And with every passing day  
True colors show.  
  
How can you ever sleep a wink at night,  
Pretending that everything is alright,  
And have the balls to blame this mess on me?  
Never in my life have I seen someone  
Oblivious to the damage he has done,  
You're the rotted root in the family tree.  
  
Watch where you walk,  
Don't you dare cross the crooked step.  
Watch the way you talk,  
  
Don't cross the crooked step.  
  
On and on and on and on it goes.  
Chauvinistic, heartless, selfish,  
Cold.  
  
How can you ever sleep a wink at night,  
Pretending that everything is alright,  
And have the balls to blame this shit on me?  
  
Never in my life have I seen someone  
So fucking blind to the damage he has done,  
You're the rotted root in the family tree.
