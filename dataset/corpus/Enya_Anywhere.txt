I walk the maze of moments  
But everywhere I turn to  
Begins A new beginning  
But never finds A finish  
I walk to the horizon  
And there I find another  
It all seems so surprising  
And then I find that I know  
You go there youre gone forever  
I go there ill lose my way  
If we stay here were not together  
Anywhere is  
The moon upon the ocean  
Is swept around in motion  
But without ever knowing  
The reason for its flowing  
In motion on the ocean  
The moon still keeps on moving  
The waves still keep on waving  
And I still keep on going  
You go there youre gone forever...  
I wonder if the stars sign  
The life that is to be mine  
And would they let their light shine  
Enough for me to follow  
I look up to the heavens  
But night has clouded over  
No spark of constellation  
No vela no orion  
The shells upon the warm sands  
Have taken from their own lands  
The echo of their story  
But all I hear are low sounds  
As pillow words are weaving  
And willow waves are leaving  
But should I be believing  
That I am only dreaming  
You go there youre gone forever...  
To leave the thread of all time  
And let it make A dark line  
In hopes that I can still find  
Thw way back to the moment  
I took the turn and turn to  
Begin A new beginning  
Still looking for the answer  
I cannot find the finish  
Its either this or that way  
Its one way or the other  
It should be one direction  
It could be on reflection  
The turn I have just taken  
The turn that I was making  
I might be just beginning  
I might be near the end
