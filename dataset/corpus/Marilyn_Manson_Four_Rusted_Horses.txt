Who'll ride this dying carousel?  
Four rusting horses strangled by their own rope  
What children love a singing wheel  
Now that their tight hearts it broke  
That their tight hearts it broke  
  
Everyone will come, everyone will come to my funeral  
To make sure that I stay dead  
Everyone will come, everyone will come to my funeral  
To make sure that I stay dead  
  
I can see the coffin shining through my tinted window  
Must've missed the sign that said it was a fire sale  
I can see the coffin shining through my tinted window  
Must've missed the sign that said it was a fire sale  
  
Everyone will come, everyone will come to my funeral  
To make sure that I stay dead  
Everyone will come, everyone will come to my funeral  
To make sure that I stay dead  
  
You can't take this from me  
(forbidden in Heaven and useless in Hell)  
You can't take this from me  
(forbidden in Heaven and useless in Hell)  
Useless in Hell
