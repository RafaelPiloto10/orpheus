Baby oh baby tell the man at the ticket stand that you've changed your mind  
Let me run outside and tell the cab to keep his meter flyin'  
Cause if you say goodbye to me babe you're gonna break my mind  
Break my mind break my mind  
No I just can't stand to hear them big jet engines whine  
Break my mind break my mind oh Lord  
If you leave you're gonna leave a babblin' fool behind  
  
Oh baby oh baby let me keep your suitcase off of the scales in time  
Tell the man that you've suddenly developed a thing about flyin'  
Cause if you say goodbye to me girl you're gonna break my mind  
Break my mind break my mind  
Break my mind break my mind  
Baby break my mind break my mind
