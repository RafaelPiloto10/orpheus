Hank, let's talk about your daddy  
Tell me how your mama loved that man  
Well, just break out a bottle, hoss  
I'll tell you bout the driftin' cowboy band  
  
We won't talk about the habits  
Just the music and the man, that's all  
  
Now Hank, you just got to tell me  
Did your daddy really write all them songs? Did he?  
That don't deserve no answer, hoss  
Let's light up and just move along  
  
Do you think he wrote 'em about your mama  
Or about the man who done her wrong, you know that  
  
Yeah, back then they called him crazy  
Nowadays they call him a saint  
Now the ones that called him crazy  
Are still ridin' on his name  
  
Well, if he was here right now, Bocephus  
Would he think that we were right? Do you think he might?  
Don't you know he would Watasha  
Be right here by our side  
  
If we left for a show in Provo  
  
He'd be the first one on the bus and ready to ride, [Incomprehensible]  
  
Wherever he is I hope he's happy  
You know I hope he's doin' well, yes I do  
He is 'cause he's got one arm around my mama now  
And he sure did love Miss Audrey and raisin' hell  
  
I won't ask you no more questions  
To the stories only Hank could tell  
[Incomprehensible]  
  
Back then they called him crazy  
Nowadays they call him a saint  
Most folks don't know that they fired him from the Opry  
And that caused his greatest pain  
  
I loved to tell you about lovesick  
How Miss Audrey loved that man  
You know I've always loved to listen  
To the stories about that driftin' cowboy band and the man  
  
You know when we get right down to it  
Still the most wanted outlaw in the land, yeah, woh
