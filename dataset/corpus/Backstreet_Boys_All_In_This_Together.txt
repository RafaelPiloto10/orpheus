All In This Together  
  
Let me tell you what I see through my eyes  
Apathy is all around and on the rise  
We channel so much energy through our greed  
Which leads us to become absolved of those in need  
Lemme tell you  
  
Money can't buy lives  
Sunny days for you  
Living is more than profits accrued  
We need to love and be loved  
And brought in the things we are thankful of  
Remember your brothers and sisters  
Because we are all in this together  
  
It's funny how we took a prayer out of schools  
After the 9-11 scare that's all we do  
We compromise our liberties for security  
We can become so self in dosed that we can't see  
Lemme tell you  
  
Money can't buy lives  
Sunny days for you  
Living is more than profits accrued  
We need to love and be loved  
And brought in the things we are thankful of  
Remember your brothers and sisters  
Because we are all in this together  
  
Don't throw in the towel  
Let's overcome the test for now  
Together (together) we last, divided we fall  
Love will conquer all  
  
Money can't buy lives  
Sunny days for you (Sunny days for you)  
Living is more than profits accrued  
(We gotta change, we gotta change right now)  
We need to love and be loved  
And brought in the things we are thankful of  
Remember your brothers and sisters  
Because we are all in this together  
  
Money can't buy lives  
Sunny days for you  
Living is more than profits accrued  
We need to love and be loved  
And brought in the things we are thankful of  
Remember your brothers and sisters  
Because we are all in this together
