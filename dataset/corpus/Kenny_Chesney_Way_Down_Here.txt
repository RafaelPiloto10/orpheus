Put off the mail and I  
Left on a light and I  
Locked up the house and I  
Jumped on a flight and I'm  
Still by myself but I'm  
Thinking more clear if I'm  
Gonna be down, gonna be down way down here  
  
[Chorus]  
Where no one will ask cause nobody knows  
That you're not in my life anymore  
And no one can tell the salt water from my tears  
No the pull of the tide or the crash of the waves  
Ain't gonna wash your memory away  
But there's a beautiful view of the end of the world from the pier  
If I'm gonna be down, I'm gonna be down way down here  
  
Untied my lines and I  
Slid through the sound and I  
Mixed me a drink now I  
Sit on the bow and I'm  
Watching the sun just like you'll disappear  
If I'm gonna be down, I'm gonna be down way down here  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No the pull of the tide or the crash of the waves  
Ain't gonna wash your memory away  
But there's a beautiful view of the end of the world from the pier  
And if I'm gonna be down, I'm gonna be down  
If I'm gonna be down, I'd rather be down way down here  
Way down here  
  
If you want me back now  
I can be found  
Way down here  
If I'm gonna be down  
If I'm gonna be down  
Way down here
