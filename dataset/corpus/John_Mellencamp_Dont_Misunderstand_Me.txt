Written by John Mellencamp  
  
I bring you renegade stories  
And you tell me I'm crazy and wild  
You say that I lack maturity  
Stop actin' like a child  
But you know I am a liar  
And my promises only get in my way  
You feel so good, when you're in my arms  
Ain't there one right thing I can say  
To make oyu want to stay  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, oh baby, baby  
Don't misunderstand me  
Oh, oh baby, baby  
  
You tell me that you love me but  
This ain't no way for you to live  
You hold so tight your fingers are broken  
I take more than I care to give  
But it's heartbeat to heartbeat  
It's push and shove and steal and prove  
It's hand to mouth sometimes  
If we run hard enough someday baby  
Gonna find some room to move  
  
Chorus  
  
All of this showin' and provin'  
Is nothing but fear  
Everybody can do what they want  
But they just can't do it here  
Girl hold on to my childishness  
I'm gonna break on through  
Out of this mess  
  
Chorus
