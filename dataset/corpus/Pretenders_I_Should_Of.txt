If I'd known then  
If only I had known  
What, where or when  
I would of kept you on the phone  
Hindsight is tough  
It's so obvious  
Never enough for the two of us  
  
I would of tried a little harder  
I would have cried a little louder  
I would have lied with more aplomb  
I, I, I, I, I, I, I should have known  
  
When we made love  
Sometimes it was great  
Just once or twice  
I would have called it second rate  
Anyway the days passed by in peace  
I never though you needed  
More release  
  
I would of tried a little harder  
I would have cried a little louder  
I would have lied with more aplomb  
I, I, I, I, I, I, I should have known  
  
If I had...if, if, if  
I should have, I should have  
I could have, I could have  
Oh fuck, I really miss you  
I really miss you  
  
I should have tried a little harder  
I should have cried a whole lot louder  
I should have lied  
With more aplomb  
I, I, If only I, I should have known
