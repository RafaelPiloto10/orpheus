I'll be your builder, skilled at the tasks you ask  
I'll be you sinner baby, allowing my soul to be sold  
But I'm drawing the line there woman  
I ain't takin' no more abuse  
I'll be puttin' my foot down and then  
Throw the chains away  
  
Locked in your prison, much too late for escape  
Your walls are closin' in, let's tie the knot while we're hot  
  
Bells are ringing, but my ears won't hear  
And you're comin' for me, with the chains and the key
