As we search for black people and white people  
Seeking the world of the four horsemen facing  
John, henry, the robot, dr. smith, and will Robinson  
Come in please -- on track for the remix  
  
[kool keith]  
Adjusting our systems the horsemen are ready to go  
Our jets, should be ready for take off, any second  
  
Aheheheheheheheh!  
I probe for evidence, movin, positive beams  
Incite the first gadget, my atom explodes  
Just hit the fifth planet, the x reload  
Take a brother on a flight for the alpha, omega  
I kick lyrics on earth, you think I'm cosmic  
A spacewalker, dippin in my spacecraft  
Through molecules, a steel wall interphase  
The fourth horseman, legendary universe  
Dark shadow human rhymin on a funky verse  
I'm level 7, optimus pull back  
Feeding the world of gamma data, to locate  
You interlock, power 7 warp speed  
Negative charge, biochemically crush  
My own nucleus bomb, the great menudo  
Yo wolverine I'm down, cyclops, rhythm x  
X we can back up the four horsemen  
Toronto blue jays, field, just like dave winfield  
Pick up your bat and go to third  
I see that man at the plate, he's waitin home  
  
We are the horsemen -- enter your spaceship! (3x)  
We are the horsemen -- enter!  
  
While, returning back to my spaceship  
On my galactic horse, this is what happened..  
  
[ced gee]  
I get super bionic  
No my name's not mantronix, but I'm 4-h-m  
Kickin flavor so steadily, so wickedy wicked  
Can I switchedy switch it, I saw my troops last night  
They said, "ced could you kick it?"  
I got mega in concert  
Then I wrote a deposit, I hit my mega-mini  
Zoom back to outer space, ten nine eight seven six  
Five four three - the chain reaction  
Triggered the mad flows, then the rhymin got hyper  
Plus I knew what they like-a, so I ripped it and rock it  
Frequencies in the pocket, one blast two blast  
Yes approximate, green in the chambers  
The lights came on, infrared and exciting  
Most don't know what I'm saying, galactic come beams  
Beams beams beams beams beams beams  
Beams beams beams...  
Now it's classic the atom, no I don't mean the phantom  
Molecules in the mix, with lots of protons to hand them  
Plus I'm billin the workers, secret charts led to persia  
When they're reachin their pick-up, I'ma crossover bezerker  
We turn to the galaxy, the universe bothers me  
From the wild wild west, I have a spaceship mentality  
When I chill at the planet, magnesium flip  
So I shake up the myolex, so what's left?  
  
We are the horsemen -- enter your spaceship! (5x)  
Yee-hah, ride em silver, we out!  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, check it out, yeah..  
Jimmy cliff down with the horsemen  
Ron bordett down with the horsemen  
Doc doc down with the horsemen  
Kevvy kev down with the horsemen  
Kleptor down with the horsemen  
Drew love down with the horsemen  
Old maid down with the horsemen  
Chuck beats down with the horsemen  
Jazz down with the horsemen  
Kevvy kev down with the horsemen  
Cut cut down with the horsemen  
The whole world down with the horsemen  
All the honies down with the horsemen  
And we're out (yeahhhh) check it out  
  
We are the horsemen -- enter your spaceship! (7x)
