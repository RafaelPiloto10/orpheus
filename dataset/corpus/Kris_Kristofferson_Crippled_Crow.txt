Beggar standin' on the corner sing your song  
Sing it for a dime  
Bring them all the pain you carried down the line  
Your music's flyin' post their ears  
Goin' through your troubles for the herd to follow  
The out of tune ravings of the crippled crow  
Movin' down the ladder slow  
Where your friends on knee will help you  
And the cup-o tin you carry  
Is just a ticket to get you in  
  
Beggar standin' on the corner dry your eye  
You're tiring now  
The tears you're tastin' now are only salty time  
Your music's lasted through the year  
Goin' through your troubles for the herd to follow  
The out of tune ravings of rhe crippled crow  
Movin' down the ladder slow  
Where your friends on knee will help you  
And the crown of thorns you're wearing  
Is just a ticket to get you in  
  
The out of tune ravings of the crippled crow  
Moving down the ladder slow  
Where your friends on knee will help you  
The out of tune ravings of the crippled crow  
Moving down the ladder slow  
Where your friends on knee will help you
