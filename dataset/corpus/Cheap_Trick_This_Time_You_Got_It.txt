Yeah  
Yeah  
  
If I knew what I wish I knew  
I could've seen what I'm going through  
When I first laid eyes on you  
You blew me away, yeah yeah  
  
If the timing's oh so right  
I'd fear for you every night  
It blew me away, yeah yeah  
  
Innocence seems to fade away  
Disappear, poof you're gone  
Thought I'd lost the key to you  
Looking for notes in the song  
  
[Chorus]  
This time we got it  
Yeah, what I've been looking for  
Reached out and got it  
I shouldn't ask for anymore  
If you could ask for anything more  
You could be king for a day  
You could be queen for a day  
'Bout time you got it  
(This time we got it)  
This time we got it  
Let's take it away  
  
Now I tried for something new  
Wasn't rich enough to pay my dues  
Was I in the right direction?  
I was aiming at you, yeah yeah  
  
If the timing's oh so right  
I'd fear for you every night  
It just blows me away, yeah yeah  
  
Thought I'd lost the key to you  
Looking for notes in the song  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Can't lose it  
Can't have enough  
Won't lose it  
Can't get enough  
Don't lose it  
Don't have enough  
Won't lose it  
I can't get enough  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This time we got it  
Yeah, what I've been looking for  
Reached in and got it  
I shouldn't ask for anymore  
If you could ask for anything more  
You could be king for a day  
You could be queen for a day  
This time you got it  
(This time we got it)  
'Bout time we got it  
Let's take it away  
This time we got it  
(This time we got it)  
'Bout time we got it  
Let's take it away  
  
Take it away  
Yeah, yeah, yeah
