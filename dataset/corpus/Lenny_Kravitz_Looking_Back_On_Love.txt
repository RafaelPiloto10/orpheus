Looking back on love  
Through a broken old TV  
Looking back on love  
But it's kinda hard to see  
  
I'm just try to find  
The place where I should be  
Yeah yeah, oh oh oh  
Looking back on love  
Oh yeah  
  
Oh looking back on love  
Thought the players have all changed  
Looking back on love  
Even though we're off the stage  
  
Now again we do with the  
Feelings we've exchanged  
Oh oh yeah, looking back on love  
Oh, come on  
  
Looking back on love  
And the bad things on the wall  
Looking back on love  
It is cracked and about to fall  
  
I should be running  
Like a a baby has to crawl  
Oh yeah yeah, looking back on love  
Oh, uh  
  
Looking back on love  
Like a rerun in my mind  
Looking back on love  
But it seems as if I am blind  
  
Holding memories  
Like a sun that always shine  
Now I need to find a love I can call mine  
Oh oh, looking back on love  
  
Oh, yeah  
  
Looking back  
Looking back on love  
  
Looking back on love  
Wonder if I will survive  
Looking back on love  
It is time for me to dive  
  
Once I go beneath  
Will I finally be alive?  
Yeah, looking back on love  
Oh oh  
  
Looking back on love
