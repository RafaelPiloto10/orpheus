On another world by another star at another place and time  
In another state of consciousness in another state of mind  
Everything was almost perfect, everything fell into place,  
That you may reach a different verdict,  
If all the judges missed the case  
  
In a parallel universe that's happening right now  
Things between us must be worse but it's hard to see just how  
  
And everything could have been perfect  
Everything in the right place  
Then I wouldn't have to play the suspect  
Accused, abandoned and disgraced  
  
I didn't choose, i didn't pull the trigger  
It wasn't me, i'm just a plain and simple singer  
I heard the sound, i turned my head around  
To watch our love shot down  
  
In another lonely universe, we're laying side by side  
Well no-ones hurt and no-ones cursed and no one needs to hide  
  
And everything is almost perfect  
Everything is almost right  
There are never any conflicts  
There are never any fights
