Hey, I can see that smile on your face  
Tonight memories will never erase  
And I feel like our time has come  
Our hearts are beating wild as one  
True love I know is hard to find  
But you tonight you're mine  
Didn't we have the time of our life tonight  
Didn't we have the time of our life tonight  
Hey, I hope you feel the same way I feel  
'Cause tonight the moon, the stars  
This moment so real  
To once we have everything  
Our hearts have a song to sing  
We now know that dream's come true  
'Cause now there's me and you  
Didn't we have the time of our life tonight?  
I'm saying, didn't we have the time of our life tonight?  
I'm saying, didn't we have the time of our life tonight?  
Oh yeah, didn't we have the time of our life tonight?  
Didn't we dance the night away  
What can I say to you?  
You make life a holiday  
Let's go and play  
Let's go and play  
Didn't we have the time of our life tonight?  
I'm saying, didn't we have the time of our life tonight?  
I'm saying, didn't we have the time of our life tonight?  
I'm saying, didn't we have the time of our life tonight?  
Come on and sing the song  
Come on and sing along  
Didn't we have the time of our life tonight?  
Oh yeah, didn't we have the time of our life tonight?
