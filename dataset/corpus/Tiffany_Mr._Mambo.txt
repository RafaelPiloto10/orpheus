Mr. Mambo (repeat)  
I've been waiting for the weekend  
To go out and have some fun  
Well the stars shine just like sequins  
And my heart beats like a machine gun  
All my friends all need to party  
Most of them are on the floor  
Well I feel like I'm in heaven  
As that boy walks through the door  
Ooh I hope he notices  
And when he looks me in the eye  
Gotta have a beat now  
That's why I'm countin' on you  
Please Mr. Mambo  
Strike up the combo  
And let the music sway  
Please Mr. Mambo  
Just one more song now  
So we can shake the night away  
Here he comes so clean and ready  
As he's rockin' to the beat  
As he gets closer I'm breathin' heavy  
Lookin' down at my own feet  
An in a second he's right before me  
Askin' me for a dance  
I look up slowly, feelin' the glory  
As he takes me by the hand  
Ooh I wanna feel the rhythm  
Ooh I've gotta feel the groove now  
I know it's your decision  
That's why I'm countin' on you  
Please Mr. Mambo  
Just on sambo  
And let the music sway  
Please Mr. Mambo  
Just one more song so  
We can swing the night away  
  
Like it was Mardi Gras Night at the mall and everyone who was anybody was
there.  
There was some kind of like Limbo contest.  
Oh no, it was Mr. Natural Brazil, you know, no steroids.  
Oh and then like this gorgeous guy come up and asked me to dance.  
Well like I got so nervous I split my diet soft drink on him.  
Well that kind of bummed the evening out for us.  
And just as I was trying to dry him for off, the music started.  
Like I had never heard this type of music before.  
I had no experience with this strange beat.  
It sounded like they stole it from like the "I Love Lucy" show.  
And then like this guy came out.  
He was like so for sure, for sure.  
He had like wing tip shoes on and like this funny little red hat on.  
Like oh wow, that was the night Mr. Mambo changed my life.  
Mr. Mambo (repeat and fade with following)  
Please Mr. Mambo  
Strike up the combo  
And let this music sway  
Please Mr. Mambo  
Just one more song now  
So we can dance the night away  
Please Mr. Mambo  
Strike up the combo  
So we can shake the night away
