Are you ready to lose?  
Are you ready to win?  
Well I've been losing for so long  
I can't begin  
  
I'm a man on the moon  
I'm a man on the edge  
Well I'm the words you never knew were in your head  
To be read  
  
You can't help you're so insecure  
Your hurt right down to the core  
You're only stuck in your pain today  
Welcome to Breaktown  
  
For the first time  
It's a great town  
For your worst time  
When you freak out  
There's a road sign  
Welcome to Breaktown  
  
Are you ready to quit?  
Are you ready to learn?  
Are you ready to find the spark inside and let it burn?  
I'm the walls that close in  
I'm the words you won't say  
I'm the voice you choose to keep inside  
And lock away  
Everyday  
  
You keep it all to yourself  
You're just like everyone else  
So take a good look around  
Now.... Welcome to Breaktown  
  
For the first time  
It's a great town  
For your worst time  
When you freak out  
There's a road sign  
Welcome to Breaktown  
  
When you're driving through  
There's a room with a view  
Just hanging around  
Yeah!  
Woahhhhhh  
Yeah!  
  
Welcome to Breaktown  
Welcome to Breaktown  
Welcome to Breaktown  
  
For the first time  
It's a great town  
For your worst time  
When you freak out  
There's a road sign  
Welcome to Breaktown  
  
Welcome to Breaktown  
Welcome to Breaktown  
Welcome to Breaktown, Breaktown
