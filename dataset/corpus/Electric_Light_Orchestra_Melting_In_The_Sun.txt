There's no way out and there's no way back  
Sailing forever out along your path  
Some troubles dare to lose you sleep  
I started thinkin' that I'm in too deep  
  
The wheels of life will stretch your face  
Squeeze you flat without a trace  
But when I was in trouble I never heard you speak  
I got the message that I'm in too deep  
  
Blows my mind  
Melting in the sun, sun  
Starts to shine, shine  
Then suddenly it's gone  
Melting in the sun  
  
Stayed up and wondered what was goin' on  
Shifted and pissed up and silent and gone  
Reasons for promises that no one could keep  
I got the picture and I'm in too deep  
  
Blows my mind  
Melting in the sun, sun  
Starts to shine, shine  
Then suddenly it's gone  
Melting in the sun  
  
There's no way out, the only way is in  
Don't matter who you are  
Don't matter where you've been  
You can buy your freedom  
But it don't come cheap  
No doubt about it, now I'm in too deep  
  
Blows my mind  
Melting in the sun, sun  
Starts to shine, shine  
Then suddenly it's gone  
Melting in the sun  
  
Yeah  
  
Suddenly it's gone  
Melting in the sun  
  
Suddenly it's gone  
Melting in the sun
