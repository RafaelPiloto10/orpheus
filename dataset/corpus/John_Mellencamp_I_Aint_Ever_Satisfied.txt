I love the things that scare most folks to death  
But I ain't ever satisfied  
I'll stay till the end or till I'm gasping my last breath  
But I ain't ever satisfied  
No, I am never satisfied  
  
I can pretty much come and go as I like  
But I ain't ever satisfied  
Hey, with no bottom-line it's hard to know wrong from right  
But I ain't ever satisfied  
I'll try anything once but then do it to death  
But I ain't ever satisfied  
I expect the worst, but I hope for the best  
Oh, I ain't ever satisfied  
No, I ain't ever satisfied  
No, no, no, no, I am never satisfied  
  
Can't get enough, no, of nothing  
I've got seven of everything and more in the till  
But I ain't ever satisfied  
You think this is dangerous stuff?  
It ain't even a thrill  
I ain't ever satisfied  
Oh, I am never...  
No, I am never...  
I don't know why I ain't ever satisfied
