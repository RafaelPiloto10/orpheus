[Man:] "All right! She's gonna sing!"  
[Rose:] "All right, we all turn to page 438.  
Now, you know we all gonna sing along.  
Oh, I do love a revue."  
  
Ohhhhhh!  
You know, women don't like this woman,  
'cause I always speak my mind.  
But the men ain't crazy about me,  
'cause I love to take my time.  
  
If you're gonna love this woman,  
Gotta love me with a thrill,  
'cause, baby, if you don't,  
I gotta find a man who will.  
  
Love me with a feeling.  
You got to love me with a feelin'.  
You got to love me with a feelin',  
Or you don't love me at all.  
  
You know, I'm the kind of woman,  
I don't want no halfway stuff.  
If you're gonna turn me loose, baby,  
Be sure I had enough.  
  
You know, the cops once took me in,  
But I did not need the bail.  
I just shook it for the judge and he,  
He put that cop in jail.  
  
You got to love me with a feeling.  
You got to love me with a feelin'.  
You got to love me with a feelin',  
Or you don't love me at all.  
  
"All right, Milledge, this one's for you."  
There was one cat who could not make it,  
And Milledge was his name.  
The only cat I ever knew  
Who left before he came.  
  
There he's a-standing,  
Drinkin' pop from a paper cup.  
But when it's time for gettin' down,  
Milledge can not get it up!  
  
You gotta love me with a feelin'.  
Yeah, love, love me with a feelin'.  
You got to love me with a feelin',  
Or you can't love me at all.
