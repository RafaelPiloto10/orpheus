I had my rent-a-car flyin' down a two-lane road  
Late for my plane again  
Had to stop for some gas at this country store  
That's when I saw the old man  
He was kicked back workin' on a big RC  
Watchin' Gomer Pyle on his little TV  
Took him awhile to even notice me  
Sittin' there I thought to myself  
Old man (Old man)you got one up on me  
I'm still lookin' for my shady tree  
With your two gas pumps and your color TV  
Your satisfied as you can be  
Old man (Old man)I guess you got one up on me  
Well he finally strolled over with a big 'ol smile  
Said "How ya doin, son?"  
I said "Give me five dollars worth as fast as you can...  
'cause I'm really in a run."  
He said "What's your hurry on a day like this?  
If you move too fast, there's a lot you'll miss  
If you want to see what the good life is  
Just get out and visit awhile."  
Old man (Old man)you got one up on me  
I'm still lookin' for my shady tree  
With your two gas pumps and your color TV  
Your satisfied as you can be  
Old man (Old man)I guess you got one up on me  
Don't remember just what it was the old man said to me  
But I forgot about catchin' the plane and opened up the big RC  
Old man (Old man)you got one up on me  
I'm still lookin' for my shady tree  
With your two gas pumps and your color TV  
Your satisfied as you can be  
Old man (Old man) you got one up on me  
Old man  
Old man  
Old man  
Old man  
Old man you got one up on me
