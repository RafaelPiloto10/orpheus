Don't you ever doubt my love cause you fit me like a glove  
And I could never give you up for someone else  
Honey I won't do you wrong and I've been loving you too long  
And I could never give you up for someone else  
When it comes to lovin' honey you can sure put out the flame  
No other woman ever could now ain't that a shame  
You lay heavy on my mind you're the best love I could find  
And I could never give you up for someone else  
  
If you ever have to go honey please don't let me go  
Cause I could never give you up for someone else  
When it comes to lovin' honey  
  
If you ever have to go
