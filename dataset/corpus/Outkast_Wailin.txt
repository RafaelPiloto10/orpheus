[Big Boi]  
In the zone like Keyser Soze, always the Usual Suspect  
No check, all I got in this game is my respect  
And Southern pride I be, checking my fucking head  
Scared, looking up in your face, boi I see dead  
If you test like SAT, then I guess that we may be, enemies  
In the P's freestyles be freebies  
I be that wrong nigga to fuck with, wouldn't I  
Wouldn't I be the wrong one to try, never eating chicken thighs  
Only the twenty piece mojo, flow zone like Flo Jo  
I wanted to figure out, just how low could yo' hoe go  
The beat hit like Beat Street, Krush Groove and Breaking  
Never baking, rebuking Satan, we had you waiting  
For the Second Coming funny how time flies when you're rhyming  
La-Fa-Ce records, I think they got that perfect timing  
To be doper than Sadaam believe the Nation of Islam  
Fuck the police and the dogs, sniffing that dope up out your car  
I think they overstep they boundaries  
O.J., not guilty, that's how they found he  
  
[Andre]  
I felt the pressure like sun shining, while raining at the same time  
I kept on rhyming, not complaining  
Storm bringing cats and dogs my catalog be the size of golf balls  
Throw up your Daisy Dukes I'm Hazzard-ous to all you Boss Hoggs  
And Roscoe P. Col' people, who could boost my locomotive  
But enough of that everyone can rap unless they ain't supposed ta  
I use my gift of gab to boast and brag in every rhyme I  
Compose won't y'all get sick of that, cause I know I do when I hear those  
Flows that ain't hip-hop, you find that shit in the gift shop  
But to each his own, my speech is goin', keep that shit up outta my zone  
Long as you happy then I'm happy  
Even if you just hate my fucking guts go 'head and dap me  
Cause I'm goin' dap you anyway and then go home and pray for yo' ass later  
Cause we might need you in this war I'm wailing on you traitors  
Like that
