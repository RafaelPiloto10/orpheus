I'm the man on the mountain  
Come on up  
I'm the plowman in the valley  
With a face full of mud  
Yes I'm fumbling  
And I know my car don't start  
Yes I'm stumbling  
And I know I play a bad guitar  
Give me little drink  
From your loving cup  
A just one drink  
And I'll fall down drunk  
I'm the man who walks the hillside  
In the sweet summer sun  
I'm the man that brings you roses  
When you ain't got none  
Well and I can run and jump  
And fish, but I won't fight  
You if you want to push  
And pull with me all night  
Give me little drink  
From you loving cup  
A just one drink  
And I'll fall down drunk  
I feel so humble  
With you tonight  
Just sitting  
In front of the fire  
I see your face dancing in the flame  
Feel your mouth kissing me again  
What a beautiful buzz, what a beautiful buzz  
What a beautiful buzz, what a beautiful buzz  
Come with that  
Oh, what a beautiful buzz  
What a beautiful buzz  
Yes, I am nitty gritty  
And my shirt's all torn  
But I would love to spill the beans  
With you till dawn  
And give me little drink  
From your loving cup  
A just one drink  
And I'll fall down drunk  
Give me little drink  
Give me little drink  
Give me little drink  
...
