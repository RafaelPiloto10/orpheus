I don't want you to be no slave  
I don't want you to work all day  
I don't want you to be true  
I just want to make love to you  
  
I don't want you to wash my clothes  
I don't want you to keep my home  
I don't want your money too  
I just want to make love to you  
Love to you, love to you  
  
Well I can see by the way that you switch and walk  
And I can tell by the way that you, baby talk  
And I can know by the way that you treat your man  
I wanna love you darlin', it's a cryin' shame  
  
I don't want you to bake my bread  
I don't want you to make my bed  
I don't want you 'cause I'm sad and blue  
I just want to make love to you, love to you  
  
Well I can see by the way that you switch and walk  
And I can tell by the way that you, baby talk  
And I can know by the way that you treat your man  
I wanna love you darlin', it's a cryin' shame  
  
I don't want you to bake my bread  
I don't want you to make my bed  
I don't want you 'cause I'm sad and blue  
I just want to make love to you, love to you  
Love to you, love to you
