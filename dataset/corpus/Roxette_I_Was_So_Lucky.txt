It's no secret I've been waiting  
But I didn't expect this  
Nothing will remain  
Nothing stays the same  
After you came  
  
It's no secret I've been starving  
I never felt anything for years  
I sat up all night  
Just to watch your smile  
When you're sleeping  
  
I was so lucky you came by  
And turned a different corner  
I could've been somewhere else  
You could've passed by, could've passed by  
  
Come on and sail the sea with me  
Come on, let's go around the world  
Maybe find a flat  
Or a canyon house  
For the season  
  
I was so lucky you came by  
And turned a different corner  
It could've been someone else  
You had in mind  
I was so lucky you found me  
My rags turned gold and silver  
I could've been somewhere else  
You could've passed by, could've passed by  
  
What would you make of this, my baby?  
The sun through the trees  
Is there a better place to be?  
  
I was so lucky you came by  
And turned a different corner  
It could have been someone else  
You had in mind, oh my  
I was so lucky you picked me  
My trash turned to silver  
Yea, I could have been somewhere else  
You could've passed by, could'be passed by
