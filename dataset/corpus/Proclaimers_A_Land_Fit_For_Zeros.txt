Hold hands with the person to your right  
Hold hands and try to look sincere-o  
Tell them, though you don't know their name  
That you still can feel their pain  
Yeah you still can feel their pain  
We'll sing "Jerusalem" now boys  
As we build a land fit for zeros  
It's all that I can do to stop  
Fake tears from welling up  
Fake tears from welling up  
  
If you thought this was your country  
You can just forget it  
You're too old, you're too poor  
You're too posh  
You'll never get in here wearing that my dear  
  
Don't smoke, don't smack  
Don't eat red meat  
This is a tolerant land fit for zeros  
And if you're lost just hear my call  
"Mediocrity is all. Mediocrity is all"  
  
If you thought this was your country  
You can just forget it  
You're too old, you're too poor  
You're too posh  
You'll never get in here wearing that my dear  
  
The past is all forgotten now  
This is a young, modern land  
Fit for zeros  
And if we fight, it's only when  
We're guaranteed to win  
And should you, just stray  
Just hear my call  
"Mediocrity is all.  
Mediocrity is all"
