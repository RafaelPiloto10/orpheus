Louie, Louie, me gotta go.  
Louie, Louie, me gotta go.  
  
A fine little girl, she wait for me.  
Me catch the ship across the sea.  
I sailed the ship all alone  
I never think I'll make it home.  
  
Louie, Louie, me gotta go.  
Louie, Louie, me gotta go.  
  
Three nights and days we sailed the sea.  
Me think of girl constantly.  
On the ship I dream she there.  
I smell the rose in her hair.  
  
Louie, Louie, me gotta go.  
Louie, Louie, me gotta go.  
  
Me see Jamaican moon above.  
It won't be long me see me love  
Me take her in my arms and then I tell her  
I never leave again.  
  
Louie, Louie, me gotta go.  
Louie, Louie, me gotta go.
