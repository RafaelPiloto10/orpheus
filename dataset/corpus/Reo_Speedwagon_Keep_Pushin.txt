I used to be lonely till I learned about livin alone  
I found other things to keep my mind on  
And I'm gettin to know myself a little bit better  
Whoa , I keep pushin on  
Keep pushin on, yeah  
  
Goin through all the changes I made so many mistakes, oh yes I did  
Tryin to leave behind the heartaches  
And sometimes I think I was a little bit crazy, oh yeah  
Whoa, I keep pushin on  
  
Keep pushin, keep pushin, keep pushin, keep pushin on  
Keep pushin, keep pushin, you know you have got to be so strong  
Keep pushin, keep pushin, well even if you think your strength is gone  
Keep pushin on  
  
Well it's comin together I finally feel like a man, oh yes I do  
I never thought that I'd be where I am, oh  
Everyday I wake a little bit higher  
Whoa I keep pushin on, oh yeah
