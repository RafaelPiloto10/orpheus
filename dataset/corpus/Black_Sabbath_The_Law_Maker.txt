The horizon breaks, where a figure stands  
Close your eyes and pray it's a vision of God's command  
  
He's evil and mysterious  
People fear his name  
He's not here for deliverance, no  
He's the Lawmaker  
  
He never speaks, but his task we're told  
To seek out souls of the sinners, he'll trade for gold  
  
He's evil and mysterious  
People fear his name  
He's not here for deliverance, no  
He's the Lawmaker  
  
Silver mountains won't save you from hell  
The prince of darkness inside you will dwell  
Oh your weakness your past  
The Lawmaker comes  
  
He's evil and mysterious  
People fear his name  
He's not here for deliverance, no  
He's the Lawmaker  
He's the Lawmaker
