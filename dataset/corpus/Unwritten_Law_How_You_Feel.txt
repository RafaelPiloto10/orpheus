I want  
I know  
I see just how you feel  
But baby  
You got a ticket to ride  
  
And if you want me  
Got's to let me know  
'cause it's so hard to let you go  
  
Well, I've been around this block  
Ten thousand times  
So just patch me  
Just one more time  
  
But if you want me  
Gots to let me know  
'cause it's so hard to let you go  
  
I've got one life to live in  
So won't you stop and listen?  
Can't keep my head from spinning all around you  
  
I want  
I know  
I've seen just how you been  
And your livin' and sinnin' starts runnin' thin  
  
But if you want me  
Got's to take it slow  
'cause it's so hard to let you go  
  
I've got one life to live in  
So won't you stop and listen?  
Can't keep my head from spinning all around you  
And if you see me slippin'  
Just keep my head from hittin'  
I'd stop the world from spinning all around you  
  
But I'm frustrated  
So frustrated  
Seems like I've been here before  
But I'm frustrated  
So frustrated, yeah  
Seems like I've been here before  
  
So as the story goes  
You know it well  
And motherfuckers  
It's one to tell  
  
But if you want me  
Got's to let me know  
'cause it's so hard to let you go
