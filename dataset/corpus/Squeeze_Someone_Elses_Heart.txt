I got nosy and I read her letters  
I read her diary it's the same story and nothing better,  
The words remind me of someone else's heart  
Has gone and left a mark.  
And the pop music plays  
On the local radio,  
There's people on the streets but no one that I know  
And like my heart is now  
I know not where they go.  
  
Same words different meaning  
Same heart different feeling,  
So much for him so much for her 'cause that's past,  
Now I know about that someone else's heart.  
  
She got nosy and read my letters too  
And my notebook surprised to find that  
Love is not so new,  
So we both took  
Someone else's heart  
And walked it through the dark.  
  
A feeling so rich  
I turned around to laugh,  
We had both indulged in each other's past  
To find out that our love  
Was true enough to last.
