Down in the warm dark part of my heart you stay  
I've been on my own for so long as I stand here today  
I'd never leave you, I'll do anything that you say  
I've been around some walking on the down the street  
Feeling as low as the shoes on the soles of my feet  
Taking dead aim on fortune and fame you might say  
Playing guitar doesn't make you a star anyway  
Many's the time I've wished that I were free  
But my love for you was too deep for my eyes to see  
I'd never leave you, I'll do anything that you say  
Whenever the thought seems better off left alone  
I think of you then in a way that is ten times as strong  
Taking dead aim on fortune and fame you might say  
Playing guitar doesn't make you a star anyway  
I'd never leave you, I'll do anything that you say  
Try to believe me, I'll do anything that you say  
Though it might grieve me, I'll do anything that you say  
Please understand me, I'll do anything that you say
