Samson and Delilah they made it known that a man is weak  
For a woman's thrown use your power like Delilah

You know god made man all muscles and strength  
But what he gave to woman no man can resist  
Use your power like Delilah even Samson couldn't deny

Even Samson couldn't deny Delilah's power.  
King of the jungle the lion he roars but the lioness calmly  
Soothes his soul use your powers like Delilah  
Even Samson couldn't deny Delilah's power.  
  
Delilah's power I said Delilah's power

Cause in every land there's a woman for every man.  
Use your powers like Delilah even Samson couldn't deny  
Delilah's power  
Delilah's power I said Delilah's power
