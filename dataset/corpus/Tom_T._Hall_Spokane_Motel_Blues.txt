I don't know what I'm doing here, I could be someplace else  
Like in Atlanta drinkin' wine, wine, wine  
I don't know what I'm doing here, I should be someplace else  
Like in Kentucky drinkin' 'shine, 'shine, 'shine  
The dogs are running down in Memphis  
And them nags are running in LA  
I'm stuck in Spokane in a motel room  
And there ain't no way to get away  
Willie Nelson's picking out in Austin  
And Waylon's hanging out in Mexico  
I'm stuck in Spokane in a motel room  
And Kris is making movin' picture shows  
Hey, I don't know what I'm doing here, I could be someplace else  
Like in Atlanta drinkin' wine, wine, wine  
I don't know what I'm doing here, I should be someplace else  
Like in Kentucky drinkin' 'shine, 'shine, 'shine  
Well I know they're dancing in New Orleans  
And old Chicago's bright as day  
I'm stuck in Spokane in a motel room  
Lord, I wish I had a Dolly Parton tape  
Well Hill and Bare and Billy Joe they're gambling  
And ol' TP's frying croppie all night long  
They're down at Tootsie's eating chili  
I'm stuck in Spokane a-writing songs  
Hey, I don't know what I'm doing here, I could be someplace else  
Like in Atlanta drinkin' wine, wine, wine  
I don't know what I'm doing here, I should be someplace else  
Like in Kentucky drinkin' clear moonshine
