[Verse 1: Rihanna]  
I think I've had enough,  
I might get a little drunk  
I say what's on my mind,  
I might do a little time  
Cause all of my kindness,  
Is taken for weakness  
  
[Chorus: Rihanna]  
Now I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'  
And we got three more days 'til Friday  
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday, mornin'  
I swear I wish somebody would tell me  
Ooh that's all I want  
  
[Verse 2: Kanye West]  
Woke up an optimist  
Sun was shining I'm positive  
Then I heard you was talkin' trash  
Hold me back I'm bout' to spaz  
  
[Chorus: Rihanna and Kanye West]  
Yeah, 'bout FourFiveSeconds from wildin'  
And we got three more days 'til Friday  
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday, mornin'  
I swear I wish somebody would try me  
Ooh that's all I want  
  
[Bridge: Rihanna]  
And I know that you're up tonight  
Thinkin' how could I be so selfish  
But you called bout a thousand times  
Wondering where I been  
Now I know that your up tonight  
Thinkin' how could I be so reckless  
But I just can't apologize,  
I hope you can understand  
  
[Bridge: Kanye West]  
If I go to jail tonight,  
Promise you'll pay my bail  
See they want to buy my pride,  
But that just ain't up for sale  
See all of my kindness,  
Is taken for weakness  
  
[Chorus: Rihanna and Kanye West]  
Now I'm FourFiveSeconds from wildin'  
And we got three more days 'til Friday  
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday, mornin'  
I swear I wish somebody would tell me  
Ooh that's all I want  
  
[Chorus: Rihanna and Kanye West]  
FourFiveSeconds from wildin'  
And we got three more days 'til Friday  
Just tryna make it back home by Monday, mornin'  
I swear I wish somebody would tell me  
Ooh that's all I want
