Some say that we should not be together,  
And that I deserve so much better.  
But they are just blind,  
I would choose to be with you or simply die.  
You would be blind to not see how I feel,  
And that my love is strong and real.  
  
Baby can you see,  
How much you mean to me...  
Can you see that I would die for you  
Or are you just blind too?  
  
Some people don't see very much,  
But they can see I love your every touch.  
Every now and then...  
I feel your touch upon my skin.  
It sends chills down my spine,  
I'm going to love you till the end of time.  
  
Baby can you see,  
How much you mean to me...  
Can you see that I would die for you  
Or are you just blind too?  
  
Those who can see it all,  
Can see that it is for you I'm going to fall.  
You make me feel so happy, you make me smile.  
You make my whole life worth while.  
Sometimes baby we fight,  
But its because I love you, and its going to be alright.  
  
Baby can you see,  
How much you mean to me...  
Can you see that I would die for you  
Or are you just blind too?
