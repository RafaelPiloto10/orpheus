Well, I've heard it, I've heard it all  
I've heard it all before  
I don't need no gypsy  
I don't need no crystal ball  
  
Since you started messin' round on me darlin'  
Now the phone's ringing off the wall  
And everybody says it's so  
I got a broken heart comin' and they want me to know  
  
And I've heard it all  
I don't need a crystal ball.  
I got a lady across the hallway  
I got another one way across town  
  
All the people at your birthday party  
You should hear the way they're puttin' me down?  
It seems the whole world's out to spy  
It's like the CIA meets the FBI  
  
And I've heard it all  
I don't need a crystal ball  
Well I've heard it all  
I don't need a crystal ball  
  
Well I've heard it all  
It ain't no surprise to me  
I don't watch no television  
I don't read the daily news  
  
I'm afraid if I listen to the radio  
I'll hear about the latest things you do  
I don't want no explanation  
Nothin' you could say could be a revelation  
  
And I've heard it all  
I don't need a crystal ball.
