[Intro:]  
Who wanna bet us that they can't fuck wit us?  
Stack cheddar forever, live treacherous, solely etceteras  
Til the death of us, me and my confidents  
We shine, we make the ambiance, you niggas just rhyme  
  
You lil niggas need guidance, you barkin up the wrong trees  
Pissin on the wrong hydrants, I'm a high fence  
I grew up round violence, you grew up playin violins  
In yo hood silence, where I'm from silence  
  
[Verse:]  
They just killed this vibe, they just killed this vibe  
There's something bout killing shit that makes us feel alive  
We feed off yo energy, we see you on that Kenny G  
Just do in yo own harm, do yo thing my nig  
Whenever you will not keep to that mighty nyc  
We gon check that name you claim  
Bring yo job and id  
We take it the wrong way, all gold everything  
One gold watch, two gold chains, give me all those, everything  
Yall don't wanna pump heads, ocho, Evelyn  
Them boys will leave you butt naked  
And the mall closed and everything  
The streets is watchin aksin if you gon reply to them  
Seem like yall woke up sleeping giants, Eli and Em  
  
[Hook:]  
A major comeback but from a minor setback  
But still they know we livin, was thinkin bout to get back  
The get back, the get back, the get back, the get back  
The get back, the get back, the get back, the get back  
I crack a smile knowing God has a day for me  
Until that day comes I slay these niggas faithfully  
The get back, the get back, the get back, the get back  
The get back, the get back, the get back, the get back  
  
[Verse:]  
I'm like Nino with the uzzi back of the motorcycle head  
Until you're back at them Italians who killed Keisha at the wedding  
I'm like dope boy lookin for Ricky's killer  
One last soldier, niggas who turn they backs on me  
Turn yo punk ass over  
Yall smoke my smoked my cousin Harold  
Now I'm in a Camaro  
Love and happiness playing, me and my dog with a double barrel  
38, 40 belows, live or die motherfucker  
I'm Pac, ride or miss, riverside motherfucker  
Get back, everybody better get back  
To my niggas in the jet black  
For the seats let back on yo jet back  
If you're a gambling man you could bet that  
It's a sure thing, not just a New York thing  
A rich or a poor thing  
It's a lace yo boots, pull yo draw string, who wanna go to war thing?  
It's a who gon protect your thing?  
Who really wanted morphine?  
Put legends in coffins  
It's a bullet holes in the door thing  
It's a nobody, sure things  
Street cold, not a Lord thing  
It's kids that wasn't taught things, old ladies like poor thing  
Poor thing, to get back is important  
Poor thing, for the dead homies we pour pain  
Like what you sayin while it's cocked back to em  
Guess what goes around comes around, got back to em  
  
[Hook:]  
A major comeback but from a minor setback  
But still they know we livin, was thinkin bout to get back  
The get back, the get back, the get back, the get back  
The get back, the get back, the get back, the get back  
I crack a smile knowing God has a day for me  
Until that day comes I slay these niggas faithfully  
The get back, the get back, the get back, the get back  
The get back, the get back, the get back, the get back
