I have often told you stories  
About the way  
I lived the life of a drifter  
Waiting for the day  
When I'd take your hand and sing you songs  
Then maybe you would say  
Come lay with me and love me  
And I would surely stay  
  
But I feel I'm growing older  
And the songs that I have sung  
Echo in the distance  
Like the sound  
Of a windmill going round  
Guess I'll always be  
A soldier of fortune.  
  
Many times I've been a traveler  
I looked for something new  
In days of old when nights were cold  
I wandered without you  
But those days I thought my eyes  
Had seen you standing near  
Though blindness is confusing  
It shows that you're not here.  
  
Now I feel I'm going older  
And the songs that I have sung  
Echo in the distance  
Like the sound  
Of a windmill going round  
Guess I'll always be  
A soldier of fortune  
  
Yes, I can hear the sound  
Of a windmill going round  
I guess I'll always be  
A soldier of fortune.  
  
I guess I'll always be  
A soldier of fortune.
