Out in the city strees  
Alone and weak from the cold and hunger,  
Trembling hands unfold a photograph.  
Mom and Dan and Ann Marie,  
Smiles from a distant sunrise,  
The only smile you've seen in days.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Come back to me  
Come back my darlin'  
Come back to me  
Or I will fade away  
Come back to me  
Come back my darlin'  
I still believe in you  
My runaway.  
  
Jesse and Willy Lee  
Play in the street while their mother wonders,  
"Why won't they listen to a word I say?"  
I sing a lullaby  
To the baby in my arms  
And the laughter fades away.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Come back to me  
Come back my darlin'  
I'm sending hope  
For the runaway  
Somewhere a flash of light  
Cuts through the night  
Like a lighthouse callin'  
All of the lost and forgotten.  
I made a vow I will continue  
'Til I find you.  
  
I'll never stop, I'll never stop believin'  
I will wait for you forever  
Sending you hope, for the runaway.
