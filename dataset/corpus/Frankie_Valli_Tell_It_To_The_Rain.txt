You're cryin' now just like I used to cry before (rain, rain, rain)  
Turn off the tears, girl, I don't care anymore  
You can save all your lies 'cause I've heard them all before  
  
Tell it to the rain and the stars that shine above  
That it's me you're thinking of  
And I'm your love [3: Forget him, love]  
  
Tell it to the rain  
  
I gave you love, girl, and got nothing in return (rain, rain, rain)  
How does it feel to feel what I had to learn  
Baby don't say you're sorry 'cause I'm just not concerned  
  
(Tell it baby) yeah  
(Tell it baby) yeah  
(Tell it baby)  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
