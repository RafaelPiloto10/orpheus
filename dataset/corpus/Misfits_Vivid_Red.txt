Deep inside me  
A demon's inside me  
Vision blurs  
  
Vivid red  
  
The horrors that I see  
The hell that surrounds me  
And it burns  
  
Vivid red  
  
No matter how I try to hide  
There's no disguise  
Pursuing, it breaths its life in me  
  
Vivid red  
  
Deep inside me  
A demon's inside me  
Vision blurs  
  
Vivid red  
  
The horrors that I see  
The hell that surrounds me  
And it burns  
  
Vivid red  
  
The voices that I hear  
Come out of nowhere  
So clear  
  
Vivid red  
  
Words that consume me  
The monster works through me  
It returns  
  
Vivid red  
  
No matter how I try to hide  
There's no disguise  
Pursuing, it breaths its life in me  
  
Vivid red  
Vivid red  
Vivid red  
Vivid red  
Vivid red  
  
No matter how I try to hide  
There's no disguise  
Pursuing, it breaths its life in me  
  
Vivid red  
Vivid red  
Vivid red  
Vivid red  
Vivid red
