A police car and a screaming siren  
A pneumatic drill and ripped up concrete  
A baby waiting and stray dog howling  
The screech of brakes and lamp lights blinking  
  
That's entertainment  
A smash of glass and the rumble of boots  
An electric train and a ripped up 'phone booth  
Paint splattered walls and the cry of a tomcat  
Lights going out and a kick in the balls  
  
That's entertainment  
Days of speed and slow time Mondays  
Pissing down with rain on a boring Wednesday  
Watching the news and not eating your tea  
A freezing cold flat and damp on the walls  
  
That's entertainment  
Waking up at 6 a.m. on a cool warm morning  
Opening the windows and breathing in petrol  
An amateur band rehearsing in a nearby yard  
Watching the tele and thinking about your holidays  
  
That's entertainment  
Waking up from bad dreams and smoking cigarettes  
Cuddling a warm girl and smelling stale perfume  
A hot summers' day and sticky black tarmac  
Feeding ducks in the park and wishing you were faraway  
  
That's entertainment  
Two lovers kissing amongst the scream of midnight  
Two lovers missing the tranquility of solitude  
Getting a cab and traveling on buses  
Reading the graffiti about slashed seat affairs  
  
That's entertainment
