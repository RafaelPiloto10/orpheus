Big bad insane Strong Arm Steady gang  
Way beyond the days of rockin' them stupid rapper chains  
Comin' through clear the lane, send a bullet through your brain  
Number one with a bullet, faster than the bullet train  
Pop it if you pull it mayne, hang with orangutans  
I live for my soldiers, ask them, they gon' say the same  
My gauge rings your bells like the Hunchback of Notre Dame  
Ain't even gotta say it, you motherfuckers know the name  
Legendary classic, niggaz be punk pussy and plastic  
Wastin' the time and the minds of the masses (yeah!)  
But look how strong we are, man I'm a motherfuckin' star  
Every week I cop a house and a car  
The mini-mansion off in Vegas with the vanquish  
That's where I mastermind my situations, determination and patience  
We don't speak the same language (no) I got a translator  
Spittin' twenty five times, see your bitch ass later, see'mon!  
  
[Chorus]  
That nigga X to the Z, that boy is somethin' to see, cause he a G  
I got the whole world waitin' on me!  
I'm about that grind so motherfucker don't waste my time  
I got the whole world waitin' on me!  
If you ready to ride, c'mon, get in my ride and let's slide  
I got the whole world waitin' on me!  
Yeah! I got the whole world waitin' on me!  
  
Niggaz screamin' they the shit but that shit ain't real  
I don't need to be the shit cause shit roll downhill  
I'm escalatin' aggressively, millions built up in equity  
Corporations invest in me, bangin' shit 'til the death of me (yeah!)  
Cooked coke recipe, money come back so thick  
My kid's kids couldn't spend this shit  
Get a grip, pop a clip, chop down that brick  
No amount of fame gon' change this gangsta spit  
Quick to roll out the backwood (yeah) smoke out your buildin'  
We soldiers devoted dressed down like civilians  
Niggaz wanna kill me because I make millions (that's weak!)  
That's weak like gangstas that hide behind children (hahaha, yeah!)  
Novocain the game, no shame  
No feelings, no names, no numbers, naw bitch  
You can't hang with us (no!)  
Ashes to ashes and you can't bust  
You so popcorn and fake industrious, yeah!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, yeah, whattup Key?  
I'm liftin' plates you'll never find in the weight room  
So stay tuned my platoon finna touch down soon  
Cancun to St. Thomas, St. Thomas to the Bahamas  
Most niggaz ain't really honest so I'm watchin' my step  
I'm the hardest cold-hearted artist, the coast is clear  
Dubai, Australia to Africa, this is the year!  
Let the alcohol you sippin saturate in yo' system  
I be swimmin' through these women, man, fuck 'em and flip 'em  
I know you hopin' I would fall to the side, or go to Way Side  
It ain't a motherfucker alive to come and take mine (no!)  
Don't procrastinate, don't waste time  
Never faced time, Houdini with crime, traffic over state lines  
Military minded, stickin' to the base lines  
Intellectually brighter than California sunshine  
Yeah, I got my bars up, go pull my cars up (yeah)  
I love my struggle, never cover my scars up (c'mon)  
Nigga  
  
[Chorus]
