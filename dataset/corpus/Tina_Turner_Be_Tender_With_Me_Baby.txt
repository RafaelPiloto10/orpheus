You got the right to tell me it's all over  
It isn't like me to be begging you  
Don't let go, don't let go  
Just stay with me another day  
When I'm not myself please understand me  
I'm so confused I don't know what to do  
But don't give up, don't give up  
It just may take a little time  
  
Be tender with me baby  
I'm so afraid you'll go away  
Be tender with me baby  
Always, for always  
  
I know that you've been patient with my weakness  
And that you hate to see me cry  
But I know, yes I know  
I doesn't have to be this way  
But I'm so lonely I could die  
  
Be tender with me baby  
I'm so afraid you'll go away  
Be tender with me baby  
Always, for always  
  
Why does my heart keep hurting  
Why do I feel like I do  
I hope you see this is not really me  
That it's just a phase that I'm going through
