There's a warm wind tonight  
And the moon turns the tide  
When the stars take their ride  
She'll be leavin'  
Where she goes, I don't know  
She won't tell me what it is  
Makes her act like this  
But I've got a funny feelin' that it's me  
It's worth believin'  
Should I ask  
"Do you like to go walking on the shore  
And listen to the sea?"  
Or could it be someone kind?  
Could it be that I'm the fool?  
There's somethin' wrong with you  
I've got a funny feelin' that it's me  
It's worth believin'  
There's a breeze from the shore  
And the waves overlap  
When I've called in the cat  
She'll go walkin'  
And she cries to herself  
In the night when I'm asleep  
She lies awake and weeps  
Could it be something new  
Some one old who has returned?  
Or is it just a game?  
But I've got a funny feelin' that it's me  
It's worth believin'  
There's a warm wind tonight  
And the moon turns the tide  
When the stars take their ride  
She'll be leavin'  
Where she goes, I don't know  
She won't tell me what it is  
That makes her act like this  
Should I ask  
"Do you like to go walking on the shore  
And listen to the sea?"  
Or could it be someone kind?  
Could it be that I'm the fool?  
There's somethin' wrong with you  
I've got a funny feelin' that it's me  
It's worth believin'
