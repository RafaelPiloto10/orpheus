Enjoy it or get out the game  
It's such a shame to lose a game  
So use your brain and play it sane  
It's just a game in another plane  
And when I call you on the phone  
Then show me that you're really home  
Let's share this thing and I will sing  
Live life like a diamond ring  
I can tell you something  
(Shoop shark)  
That you oughta know, know  
Feel my feeling  
(Shoop shark)  
Go to let it show show show  
Got to shake your tail to break away  
(Fish)  
Got to shake your tail to make a wave  
(Shark)  
Got to shake your tail to break away  
(Fish)  
Got to shake your tail to make a wave  
Shark  
Get hot, red hot  
Everybody create  
Create your bait  
Everybody create  
Before it's too late  
Live life like a diamond ring  
Live life like a diamond ring  
Everybody create  
Create your bait  
Everybody create  
Before it's too late  
Got to shake your tail to break away  
(Fish)  
Got to shake your tail to make a wave  
(Shark)  
Got to shake your tail to break away  
(Fish)  
Got to shake your tail to make a wave  
(Shark)
