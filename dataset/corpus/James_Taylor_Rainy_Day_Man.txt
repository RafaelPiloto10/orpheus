What good is that happy lie  
All you wanted from the start was to cry  
  
It looks like another fall  
Your good friends they don't seem to help at all  
When you're feeling kind of cold and small  
Just look up your rainy day man  
  
It does you no good to pretend child  
You've made a hole much too big to mend  
And it looks like you lose again, my friend  
Call on your rainy day man  
  
Now rainy day man he don't like sunshine  
He don't chase rainbows  
He don't need good times  
Grey days rolling  
Then you'll see him  
Empty feeling  
Now you need him  
  
All those noble thoughts they just don't belong  
You can't hide the truth with a happy song  
And since you knew where you stood all along  
Just look up your rainy day man  
  
Now simple pleasures they all evade you  
Store-bought treasures none can save you  
Look for signs to ease the pain  
Ask again  
Go on and pray for rain  
  
It looks like another fall  
Your good friends they don't seem to help at all  
When you're feeling kind of cold and small  
Just look up your rainy day man  
All I need to do is look up my rainy day man  
  
Now what good is that happy lie  
All you wanted from the start was to cry
