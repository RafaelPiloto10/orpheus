You and I are like oil and water  
We've been trying, trying, trying  
To mix it up  
  
We've been dancing on a volcano  
We've been crying, crying, crying  
The oh blackened souls  
This wouldn't be the first time  
It will not be the last time  
There is no better soul that can shelter this weather  
  
I've been smiling with birds on my shoulder  
I've been dying, dying, dying  
To let them go  
  
Well this wouldn't be the first time  
It will not be the last time  
There is no better soul that could shelter this weather  
Babe this wouldn't be the first time  
It will not be the last time  
We tried to believe everything could get better  
  
We've been  
Lying to each other, hey babe  
Let's just call it, call it, call it  
What it is  
  
Oil and water, wouldn't be the first time  
Oil and water, wouldn't be the first time  
Oil and water, wouldn't be the first time
