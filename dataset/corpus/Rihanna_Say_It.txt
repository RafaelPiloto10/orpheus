You should tell me what's buggin' you  
And I'm a tell ya 'bout me ('bout me)  
You should tell me your deepest thoughts  
And I'm a make it easy (easy)  
You should tell me what's buggin' you  
And I'm a tell ya 'bout me ('bout me)  
You should tell me your deepest thoughts  
And I'm a make it easy (easy)  
  
Emotions running wild  
I could feel it when I'm next to you  
Something's on ya mind  
You wanna stay but won't tell me  
It's about ya secrecy  
So what are you tryin' to hide?  
I know what the look means  
You hold my hand so tightly  
Whenever we say goodbye  
Standing by the door  
I can tell you can't take no more  
Blow your secret open wide  
  
[Chorus:]  
So, baby, if you say it (say it)  
Tell me what it is you like (like)  
Baby, baby, don't be shy  
Maybe you can spend the night  
If you say it  
But if you playin' (oh baby)  
'Cause you know what I wanna hear (hear)  
Say it, that'll make it more clear (clear)  
I need to know how you feel  
So, baby, won't you (say it), say it, (say it), say it?  
  
Won't, won't you tell me what, what's going on?  
Why, why you waitin' on it, what you waiting for?  
Soon you should tell me or I might be gone  
But I'm here for you, baby, you should put me on  
  
I won't shoot you down  
Make you feel some kinda way  
If you'll be honest with me  
Put away your pride  
I can see it in your face  
You want me permanently (uh)  
Like how I whine when we dancing  
I know how it happened  
And I'm right there wit' you  
But I won't be the first to put myself out there  
The feeling is mutual  
But I bet if you...  
  
Say it (say it)  
Tell me what it is you like (like)  
Baby, baby, don't be shy (shy)  
Maybe you can spend the night (night)  
If you say it  
But if you playin' (oh baby)  
'Cause you know what I wanna hear (hear)  
Say it, that'll make it more clear (clear)  
I need to know how you feel  
So, baby, won't you (say it), say it (say it) say it?  
  
Your eyes steady talking  
And you're tryin' to fight it  
But some things, baby, are not worth hiding  
And we can find heaven  
If we go look together  
So why won't you tell me  
And get it off your chest?  
Your eyes steady talking  
And you're tryin' to fight it  
But some things, baby, are not worth hiding  
And we can find heaven  
If we go look together  
So why won't you tell me  
And get it off your chest?  
  
So, baby, if you say it (say it)  
Tell me what it is you like (what it is you like, like)  
Baby, baby, don't be shy (shy)(oh, no, no)  
Maybe you can spend the night (night)  
If you say it  
But if you playin' (oh baby)  
'Cause you know what I wanna hear (you know what I wanna hear, hear)  
Say it, that'll make it more clear (so, boy, say it loud and clear)  
I need to know how you feel  
So, baby, won't you (say it), say it (say it), say it?  
  
Your eyes steady talking  
And you're tryin' to fight it  
But some things, baby, are not worth hiding  
And we can find heaven  
If we go look together  
So why won't you tell me  
And get it off your chest?  
Your eyes steady talking  
And you're tryin' to fight it  
But some things, baby, are not worth hiding  
And we can find heaven  
If we go look together  
So why won't you tell me  
And get it off your chest?  
  
[Chorus]
