I took my baby on a Saturday bang  
Boy is that girl with you  
Yes we're one and the same  
  
Now I believe in miracles  
And a miracle has happened tonight  
  
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby  
It don't matter if you're black or white  
  
They print my message in the Saturday Sun  
I had to tell them I ain't second to none  
  
And I told about equality and it's true  
Either you're wrong or you're right  
  
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby  
It don't matter if you're black or white  
  
I am tired of this devil  
I am tired of this stuff  
I am tired of this business  
Sew when the going gets rough  
I ain't scared of your brother  
I ain'ts scared of no sheets  
I ain't scared of nobody  
Girl when the goin' gets mean  
  
Protection  
For gangs, clubs, and nations  
Causing grief in human relations  
It's a turf war on a global scale  
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale  
See, it's not about races  
Just places  
Faces  
Where your blood comes from  
Is were your space is  
I've seen the bright get duller  
I'm not going to spend my life being a color  
  
Don't tell me you agree with me  
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye  
  
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby  
It don't matter if you're black or white  
  
I said if you're thinkin' of being my baby  
It don't matter if you're black or white  
  
I said if you're thinkin' of being my brother  
It don't matter if you're black or white  
  
Ooh, ooh  
Yea, yea, yea now  
Ooh, ooh  
Yea, yea, yea now  
  
It's black, it's white  
It's tough for them to get by  
It's black, it's white, (x3) whoo
