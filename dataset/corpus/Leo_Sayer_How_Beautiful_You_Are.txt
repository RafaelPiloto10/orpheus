From the window of our honeymoon  
The night looks a might bizarre  
They're burning us in effigy  
And smoke's blots out the stars  
  
They're torturing our servants  
By the light of an armoured car  
Please don't ask if it's the end of the line  
As I never could see that far  
  
Tonight I'd rather look at you  
How beautiful you are  
If they ask you "what are lovers"  
Tell them "lovers are  
  
Set against the order  
We live outside the law"  
I'm no hero under torture  
I'll tell them all I heard and saw  
  
I saw everything in you, my love  
How beautiful you are  
  
Through a broken telescope  
We focus on the stars  
I don't want my vision magnified  
I don't need to see that far  
  
From the window of our honeymoon  
Draw the curtains cross the bars  
Let's spare ourselves the spectacle  
The problem's theirs not ours  
Tonight I'd rather look at you  
  
How beautiful you are  
How beautiful you are  
How beautiful  
How beautiful  
How beautiful you are  
You are
