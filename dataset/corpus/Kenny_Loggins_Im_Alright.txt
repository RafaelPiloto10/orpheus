I'm alright  
Nobody worry 'bout me  
Why you got to gimme a fight?  
Can't you just let it be?  
  
I'm alright  
Don't nobody worry 'bout me  
You got to gimme a fight  
Why don't you just let me be  
  
Do what you like,  
Doing it nat'rally  
But if it's too easy  
They're gonna disagree  
  
It's your life  
And isn't it a mystery  
If it's nobody's bus'ness  
It's everybody's game  
  
Gotta catch you later  
No, no, cannonball it right away  
  
Some Cinderella kid  
  
Get it up and get you a job  
(Dip dip dip dip dip dip dip dip)  
  
I'm alright  
Nobody worry 'bout me  
Why you got to gimme a fight?  
Can't you just let it be?  
  
I'm alright  
Don't nobody worry 'bout me  
You got to gimme a fight  
Why don't you just let me be  
  
Who do you want?  
Who you be today?  
And who is it really  
Makin' up your mind?  
  
You want to listen to the man?  
Pay attention to the magistrate  
And while I got you in the mood  
Listen to your  
  
Own heart beatin'  
Own heart beatin'  
Own heart beatin'  
Own heart beatin'  
  
Don't it get you movin'  
  
mmmmm-man  
  
It make me feel good  
  
(Wow, Cinderella kid)  
  
Then give it up and give it the job  
  
(dip dip dip dip dip dip dip dip)  
(Boom, boom, boom, boom)  
  
I'm alright  
Nobody worry 'bout me  
Why you got to gimme a fight?  
Can't you just let it be?  
  
I'm alright  
Don't nobody worry 'bout me  
You got to gimme a fight  
Why don't you just let me be  
  
I'm alright  
Nobody worry 'bout me  
Why you got to gimme a fight?  
Can't you just let it be?
