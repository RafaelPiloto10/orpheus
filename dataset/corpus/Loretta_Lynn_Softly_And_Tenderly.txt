Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling calling for you and for me  
See on the portal he's waiting and watching watching for you and for me  
Come home come home ye who are weary come home  
Earnestly tenderly Jesus is calling calling oh sinner come home  
  
Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading pleading for you and for me  
Why should we linger and heed not his mercies mercies for you and for me  
Come home come home
