Streets alive  
Something in the air  
We're writing up a brand new constitution  
  
Don't want to grow old  
Age is in your head  
Another boy has soul  
His soul for rock and roll  
  
(We were) Born to rock  
Pull out all the stops  
And we scream  
We're the voice  
Cause we made our choice  
And that is  
(We were) Born to rock  
  
Yeah  
Rock and roll  
Yeah  
  
Look out  
  
All alone  
The party's just begun  
No boss to guard your shoulder generation  
  
Running out of time  
With us there's no control  
Rockin' is a crime  
Boss man says, "No more."  
  
(We were) Born to rock  
Pull out all the stops  
And we scream  
With the voice  
Cause we have the choice  
(We were) Born to rock  
  
Rock on!  
Watch out!  
Ooh-ooh-ooh  
Ooh-ooh  
Ooh-ooh-ooh  
Ooh-ooh  
Ooh-ooh-ooh  
  
(We were) Born to rock  
Pull out all the stops  
  
(We were) Born to rock  
Pull out all the stops  
  
(We were) Born to rock  
  
We were born to rock!
