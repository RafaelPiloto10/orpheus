Take a listen through the window  
Take a lover on the radio  
Ask her if she's got an answer  
Do you know  
  
Time enough to get a good one  
Though they never seem to get done  
I am standing for a reason  
Do you know  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause I don't know how  
And I don't know where  
We are we are  
  
And I don't know why  
I don't know if  
We are we are  
  
Seven days and not a return  
Seven lives and not a thing learned  
Take a lover on the highway  
Do you know?  
  
'Cause I am sleeping on a time bomb  
And I am waiting for the light to come  
You and I could get away now  
Do you know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I get up sometimes  
Like somebody else  
Am I just wasting time  
For somebody else  
  
Take a listen through the window  
Another lover on the radio  
Ask her if she's got an answer  
Do you know?  
  
[Chorus]
