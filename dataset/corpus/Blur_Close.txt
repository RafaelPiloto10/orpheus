You put me together, break my bones  
I wish that I'd never seen you now.  
So happy together, would break my bones.  
I wish that I'd never seen you now.  
  
I, I've got to get you close to me.  
I've got to get you close to me.  
  
Spinning together, watch us go.  
I wish that I'd never seen you now.  
  
I, I've got to get you close to me.  
I've got to get you close to me.  
I, I've got to get you close to me.  
I've got to get you close to me, to see through me.  
I've got to get you close to me (x2)
