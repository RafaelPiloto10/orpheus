It started in Roanoke a little whiles ago  
A friend knew a dance that you ought to know  
They call it flat footin' and it sure looks fine  
Right now it's flat footin' it time  
  
And you'll be flat footin' it, flat gettin' it  
You don't know just how good it is until you hear that guitar pickin' it, pick
it  
  
Just let your arms hang right where they are  
Then you'll start flat footin' it ? to the bar  
Turn yourself loose all the law will allow  
And you're doing that flat footin' it now  
  
You'll be flat footin' it, flat gettin' it  
You don't know just how good it is until you hear that drummer pickin' it,
pick it  
  
It started in Roanoke and came a long way  
Now it's a flat footin' it USA  
Good for your spirits and good for your health  
You oughta try a little flat footin' yourself  
  
And you'll be flat footin' it, flat gettin' it  
You don't know just how good it is until you hear that bass fiddle pickin' it,
pick it  
  
Well, all of the students at the University  
Shocked and amazed the existing faculty  
Some dropped Biology and some cut their math  
To enroll in a flat footin' it class  
  
Flat footin' it, flat gettin' it  
You don't know just how good it is until you hear that band a' pickin' it,
pick it
