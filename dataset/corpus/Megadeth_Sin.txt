He had an unfamiliar face  
Complete life in disarray  
A simple man, power drunk  
No worries of living, no more anything  
Deep inside I've seen it rise  
Actions progress to no end  
Mirror, mirror please look inside  
Do you see the reasons that we sin  
Not one to be forgot  
Spoiled rotten, so they say  
Once burned, forever marked  
Hurt by just a few but so many have to pay  
Pressure coming down  
Down on me, gonna break  
Broken fingernails  
Digging in, scratch my face  
Nervous, like a cat  
Gonna jump through my skin  
Shadows on the wall  
Stretching out, grope for me  
Reasons, deep in me  
Let me be  
Let me bleed  
Set me free  
The reasons that we sin
