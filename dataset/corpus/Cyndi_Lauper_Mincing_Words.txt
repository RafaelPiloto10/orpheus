sometimes when I lose my head  
I can't make sense of what you said  
but you don't mean it  
or that's what you say  
all the conversation seems to slip away  
  
oh maybe you can say it better (you can say it better...better)  
I can listen  
people do it all the time, baby  
we can make it better (we can make it better)  
cause mincing words (mincing words) will never rhyme  
they never rhyme  
  
same excuses that go round and round  
push them up just to knock them down  
confuse the issue to shift the blame  
and lose the picture like a puzzle game  
  
you never notice if you're right or wrong (right or wrong)  
it becomes a contest of the weak and the strong  
(weak and the strong, baby)  
there is no reason for you to pick a fight (no, no)  
when we lose heart its time to shut out the light  
  
mmmm hmmm  
  
oh maybe you can say it better  
(you can say it better...better)  
I can listen  
people do it all the time, baby  
we can make it better (we can make it better)  
cause mincing words (cause mincing words)  
Will never rhyme  
baby never rhyme  
will never rhyme
