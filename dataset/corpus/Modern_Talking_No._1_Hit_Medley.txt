Deep in my heart - there's a fire - a burning heart  
Deep in my heart - there's desire - for a start  
I'm dying in emotion  
It's my world in fantasy  
I'm living in my, living in my dreams  
  
You're my heart, you're my soul  
I keep it shining everywhere I go  
You're my heart, you're my soul  
I'll be holding you forever  
Stay with you together  
  
You're my heart, you're my soul  
Yeah, a feeling that our love will grow  
You're my heart, you're my soul  
That's the only thing I really know  
  
You packed your things in a carpetbag  
Left and never looking back  
Rings on your fingers, paint on your toes  
Music wherever you go  
You don't fit in a smalltown world  
But I feel you're the girl for me  
Rings on your fingers, paint on your toes  
You're leaving town where nobody knows  
  
You can win if you want  
If you want it, you will win  
On your way you will see that life is more than fantasy  
Take my hand, follow me  
Oh, you've got a brand new friend for your life  
  
You can win if you want  
If you want it you will win  
Oh, come on, take a chance  
For a brand new wild romance  
Take my hand for the night  
And your feelings will be right  
Hold me ti-i-i-i-ight  
  
Oh, I cannot explain  
Every time it's the same  
Oh, I feel that it's real  
Take my heart  
I've been lonely too long  
Oh, I can't be so strong  
Take the chance for romance, take my heart  
I need you so  
There's no time I'll ever go  
  
Cheri, cheri lady  
Going through a motion  
Love is where you find it  
Listen to your heart  
Cheri, cheri lady  
Living in devotion  
It's always like the first time  
Let me take a part  
  
Cheri, cheri lady  
Like there's no tomorrow  
Take my heart - don't lose it  
Listen to your heart  
Cheri, cheri lady  
To know you is to love you  
If you call me, baby, I'll be always yours  
  
Deep love is a burning fire  
Stay, 'cause then the flames grow higher  
Babe, don't let him steal your heart  
It's easy, easy  
Girl, this game can't last forever  
Why, we cannot live together?  
Try, don't let him take your love from me  
  
You're no good, can't you see  
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie  
I'm in love - set you free  
Oh, she's only looking to me  
Only love breaks her heart  
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie  
Only love's paradise  
Oh, she's only looking to me  
  
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie  
Oh, she's only looking to me  
Oh, let it Louie  
She is undercover  
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie  
Oh, doing what he's doing  
So, leave it Louie  
'Cause I'm her lover  
  
Lady, I know it was hard  
But it's much harder to ignore  
There's a chance and I'll promise  
I won't hurt you anymore  
Hollywood nights we're romancin'  
You can trust me anytime  
Somewhere, oh, babe, there is someone  
Oh, you're dancing in my mind  
  
Ohoho, little queenie  
I'm your fool  
Come on, teach me the rules  
And I will send a S. O. S. For love  
Ohoho, little queenie,  
I'm your fool  
You need love, like I do  
And I will send a S. O. S. For love  
  
Atlantis is calling, S. O. S. For love  
Atlantis is calling, from the stars above  
Atlantis is calling, S. O. S. For love  
Atlantis is calling, it's too hot to stop
