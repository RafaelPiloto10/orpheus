I want to see what people saw  
I want to feel like I felt before  
I want to see the kingdom come  
I want to feel forever young  
I want to sing  
To sing my song  
I want to live in a world where I belong  
I want to live  
I will survive  
And I believe that it won't be very long  
  
If we turn, turn, turn, turn, turn  
Then we might learn  
So where's the stars?  
Up in the sky  
And what's the moon?  
A big balloon  
We'll never know unless we grow  
There's so much world outside the door  
  
I want to sing  
To sing my song  
I want to live in a world where I'll be strong  
I want to live  
I will survive  
And I believe that it won't be very long  
  
If we turn, turn, turn, turn  
And if we turn, turn, turn, turn  
Then we might learn  
Turn, turn, turn, turn  
Turn, turn, turn  
And if we turn, turn, turn, turn  
Then we might learn  
Learn to turn
