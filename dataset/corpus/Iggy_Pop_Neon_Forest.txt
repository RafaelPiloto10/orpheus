I'm sliding like a lizard on my belly and back  
It's a miracle I haven't fallen through any cracks  
The life on display is trouble for sure  
The drugs that I took have made me impure  
  
The neon forest is lighting up  
The neon forest is lighting up  
My brain  
  
I've learned some nasty lessons so I'm shutting  
My mouth  
A fury in my gut is spinning me round  
And round  
To be a total phony is the winning design  
When the fabric of life is a horny goldmine  
  
The neon forest is my home  
And like a cartoon cat I roam  
Where only kids are still alive  
And anyway they're gonna fry  
My brain  
  
You can get a weird prize for being adored  
You can join the "in crowd" for being a whore  
Although you are lonely you wish for a fence  
America takes drugs in psychic defense  
You can say what you want but nobody's there  
Have you got any money?  
Are you anybody?
