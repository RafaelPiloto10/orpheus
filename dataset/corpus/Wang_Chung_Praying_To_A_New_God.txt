What got into you got into me too  
What came over you is coming over me  
I've had enough of all the old stuff  
I saw the writing on the wall on my TV  
It's another second coming, like it or not, yeah, oh yeah  
It's another second coming, like it or not  
You better start praying to a new God  
Start praying, praying to a new God  
Start praying to a new, new God  
They're saying the Devil's got a new job  
Start praying to a new  
A lot of Babel came down the cable  
Everybody can be famous for a day  
From shore to shore, a big department store  
Is all that's left of the American way  
It's another second coming, like it or not, yeah, oh yeah  
Well, it's another second coming, like it or not  
You better start praying to a new God  
Start praying, praying to a new God  
Start praying to a new, new God  
Start praying, what are you afraid of  
Start praying to a new  
There's a big world  
In the street outside  
In their uniform of pride  
And they've all come  
To see a star from the east  
Is he man or beast? Decide  
Feel like I'm crucified, still I'm not satisfied  
The second coming is coming anyway  
I see them pray for more on every dance floor  
I hear the word go out across the milky way  
It's another second coming, like it or not, yeah, oh yeah  
It's another second coming, like it or not  
You better start praying to a new God  
Start praying, praying to a new God  
Start praying to a new, new God  
Success and money's what he's made of  
Start praying to a new God  
Start praying, praying on the airwaves  
Start praying to a new, new God  
Start praying, praying on the freeway  
Start praying to a new God  
Start praying, praying at the back door  
Start praying to a new, new God  
Start praying, praying on the dance floor  
Start praying to a new God  
Start praying, praying to a new God  
Start swaying to a new, new God  
Start praying, praying to a new God  
Start swaying to a new God  
Start praying, praying to a new God  
Start praying
