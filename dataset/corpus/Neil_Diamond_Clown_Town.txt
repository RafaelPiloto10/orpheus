When a guy's been made a fool of  
By a gal who only wants to play  
He goes to a lonely place where lovers  
Who are broken hearted stay  
They call it  
Clown town, clown town  
No joy around town and you see  
That's just where I've been stayin'  
Since you made a clown out of me  
Baby, won't you come and get me  
I can't take it here another day  
It's not very hard to find  
It's no more than a broken heart away  
They call it  
Clown town, clown town  
No joy around town and you see  
That's just where I'll be stayin'  
Baby, till you set me free  
They call it  
Clown town, clown town  
No joy around town and you see  
That's just where I'll be stayin'  
Baby, till you set me free  
They call it  
Clown town, clown town  
No joy around town and you see  
That's just where I'll be stayin'  
Baby, till you set me free  
They call it  
Clown town, clown town,  
Come and get me baby
