Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey?  
Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?  
Don't ya know that I have really never loved nobody, but you? X2  
I'll do my hair up all high and wild, wild flowers tied  
Green swimming pool pink flamingos, high christmas lights  
Blue bedspread and silver tinsel, my hearts delight  
Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey?  
Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?  
Don't ya know that I have really never loved nobody, but you? X2  
Do you like my fake nails daddy?  
Black palmtree pink tiger-stripes  
Used to go to the kamfreena  
Will you buy me a slice of cherry pie?  
We didn't know much, just worked at night  
Sweet trailer light  
1, 2...  
Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey?  
Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?  
Don't ya know that I have really never loved nobody, but you?  
Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey?  
Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?  
Don't ya know that I have really never loved nobody, but you  
He said: Lana-Ray, will you serve me lemonade?  
And I said: yes Bill I will, it's the day of the parade  
  
And you look even more handsome than you did  
The day that I left you  
How do you spend your nights, honey?  
Still watchin' tv? I long to be in your arms, honey,  
Come back to me  
Please  
Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey?

All I want is to feel good  
All I want is to feel good  
All I want is to feel good, you know?  
Come on now if you want to  
If you want to if you want to  
It's been a long time  
Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey?  
Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?  
Don't ya know that I have really never loved nobody, but you?
