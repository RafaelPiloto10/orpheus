See that mountain I'm gonna have to climb  
Well there's a river waitin' on the other side  
And the road leading nowhere I'll take it for I must  
He's somewhere tomorrow or I'll bust  
You can go along with me and be my friend  
Or you can stay and wish you'd gone alone  
And you can follow me in postcard that I'll send  
But by the time you enter I'll be gone  
Life is a circle spinning round  
Searching for what you haven't found  
I leave today to look for my tomorrow  
Tomorrow I'll come searching for today  
[ ac.guitar ]  
See that mountain I'm gonna have to climb...  
I don't know that I'd be coming back this way  
But if you stay and I'd come back someday  
Then I'll teach you the lessons that I've learned  
And I'll build back the bridges that I've burned  
Life is a circle spinning round...  
Yeah tomorrow I'll come searching for today
