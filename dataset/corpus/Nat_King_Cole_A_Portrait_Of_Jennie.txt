A Portrait of Jennie  
More precious to me  
than a masterpiece how ever famous it be  
  
The portrait of Jennie  
is etched on my heart  
where her features have been sketched from the start  
  
Ah, the color and beatuy of life  
and the glow of her sprit divine  
all cast in heaven's own design  
  
With a portrait of Jennie  
I never will part  
for there isn't any portrait of Jennie  
except in my heart  
  
for there isn't any portrait of Jennie  
except in my heart
