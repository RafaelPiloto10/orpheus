Well, I know y'all look as if you need some  
  
But I just got some  
I surely got some  
The doctor prescribed some  
I surely need some  
Have to, have to have some, baby  
Oh, I just went out and got some  
  
My pockets ain't jinglin' and I'm gettin' fat  
You know you can't hide it, I know where it's at  
My pockets are as heavy as a chunk of lead  
I just got a taste of her meat and veg  
  
I had to have some  
Sure did need some  
Doctor prescribed some  
Had to, had to, had to have some baby  
Y'all know I look as if I need some  
Oh, I just went out and got some, oh  
  
Yeah  
  
You would not help me when you really could  
But right now baby, you can't do me no good  
Cause I just got some  
Had to, had to, have some  
Doctor prescribed some  
Had to, had to, had to have some baby  
Y'all know I look as if I need some  
Oh, I just went out and got some, oh  
  
Yeah  
  
You would not help me when you really could  
But right now baby, you can't do me no good  
Cause I just got some  
Had to, had to, have some  
Doctor prescribed some  
You all know I look as if I need some  
  
I just got some  
Had to had to have some, baby, oh

Everybody knows that I need some  
The doctor even prescribed me some  
Oh, yeah
