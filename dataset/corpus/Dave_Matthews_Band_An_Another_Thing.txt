Rain for me oh you but called me  
It's my broken heart just where you leave me  
Now I say to you, "ooooh boy."  
  
Weight on my head  
You won't go up, oh  
Weight on my head  
Oooh ooh my babe...  
  
Stay a minute just to hear you waitin',  
And no one confine her  
Sweet and tender won't you go out again?  
  
Oh, rain on my head  
Wouldn't you  
Rain on my head?  
Oh, someone take off a  
Weight all alone  
  
Ahh, I met a girl recently.  
All in a sudden, all a suddenly  
Nobody deal for the woe of the world  
Wait, all a sudden, all a suddenly  
It will all would be, all would be over  
  
Wait, come on rain on my head.  
Water water!  
  
Dates,  
Many, many dates how you all die.  
  
Oh rain money,  
Grow a war at heart  
And in the fire,  
One out of a million.  
  
.. wait a minute,  
Touch your look on me  
Denial, denial  
Touch your work with me  
Do not deny  
Rain on my head  
Rain on my head  
Rain on my head  
Rain on my head
