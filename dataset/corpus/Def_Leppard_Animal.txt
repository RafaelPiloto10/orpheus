A wild ride, over stony ground  
Such a lust for life, the circus comes to town  
We are the hungry ones, on a lightning raid  
Just like a river runs, like a fire needs a flame  
I burn for you  
  
[Chorus]  
I gotta feel it in my blood, whoa oh  
I need your touch don't need your love, whoa oh  
And I want, and I need,  
And I lust, animal  
And I want, and I need,  
And I lust, animal  
  
Cry wolf, given mouth to mouth  
Like a movin' heartbeat in the witching hour  
I'm runnin' with the wind, a shadow in the dust  
And like the drivin' rain, yeah, like the restless rust  
I never sleep  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Huh!  
Ah!  
  
Cry wolf, baby cry tough  
Gonna hunt you like an, an, an, an, an animal  
Gonna take you love 'n' run  
  
Cry wolf, given mouth to mouth  
Like a movin' heartbeat in the witching hour  
I'm runnin' with the wind, a shadow in the dust  
And like the drivin' rain, yeah, like the restless rust  
I never sleep  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I want, and I need,  
And I lust, animal  
Take me, tame me  
Make me your animal  
Show me, stroke me  
Let me be your animal  
I want, ooh yeah, animal
