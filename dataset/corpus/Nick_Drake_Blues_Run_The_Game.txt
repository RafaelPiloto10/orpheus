Catch a boat to England, baby  
Maybe to spain  
Wherever I have gone  
Wherever I've been and gone  
Wherever I have gone, the blues I'd to sing  
Go bring me whiskey, baby  
Go bring me gin  
Me and room service, honey  
Me and room service  
Me and room service, well we're living like a sin  
When I'm not drinking, baby  
You are on my mind  
When I'm not sleeping  
When I'm not sleeping  
When I'm not sleeping, well you know, you'll find me crying  
Try another city, baby  
Try another town  
Wherever I have gone  
Wherever I've been and gone  
Wherever I have gone, the blues run the game  
Well maybe someday, baby  
Somewhere down the line  
I'll wake up older, honey  
So much older  
I'll wake up older and just stop all my trying  
Catch a boat to England, baby  
Maybe to spain  
Wherever I have gone  
Wherever I've been and gone  
Wherever I have gone, the blues run the game
