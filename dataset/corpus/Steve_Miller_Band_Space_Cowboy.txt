I told you 'bout living in the U.S. of A.  
Don't you know that I'm a gangster of love  
Let me tell you people that I found a new way  
And I'm tired of all this talk about love  
And the same old story with a new set of words  
About the good and the bad and the poor  
And the times keep on changin'  
So I'm keepin' on top  
Of every fat cat who walks through my door  
  
I'm a space cowboy  
Bet you weren't ready for that  
I'm a space cowboy  
I'm sure you know where it's at  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
I was born on this rock  
And I've been travelin' through space  
Since the moment I first realized  
What all you fast talkin' cats would do if you could  
You know, I'm ready for the final surprise  
There ain't no way around it  
Ain't nothing to say  
That's gonna satisfy my soul deep inside  
All the prayers and surveyors  
Keep the whole place uptight  
While it keeps on gettin' darker outside  
  
I'm a space cowboy  
Bet you weren't ready for that  
I'm a space cowboy  
I'm sure you know where it's at  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
I see the show downs, slow downs, lost and found, turn arounds  
The boys in the military shirts  
I keep my eyes on the prize, on the long fallen skies  
And I don't let my friends get hurt  
All you back room schemers, small trip dreamers  
Better find something new to say  
Cause you're the same old story  
It's the same old crime  
And you got some heavy dues to pay  
  
I'm a space cowboy  
Bet you weren't ready for that  
I'm a space cowboy  
I'm sure you know where it's at  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
