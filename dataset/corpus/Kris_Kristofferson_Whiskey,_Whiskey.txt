She's a little bit of the sunshine  
Just before the rain  
A little like this quiet night  
Before the cold winds came  
She's a little bit like the weather  
I never know when she's gonna change  
She's a part of my heart  
And a whole lot of my pain  
  
[Chorus:]  
Whiskey, whiskey my old friend  
I've come to talk with you again  
Milk of mercy please be kind  
Drive this feeling from my mind  
  
Don't you know, somehow her smile  
Can make the day begin  
She'd take away this mask of grey  
And let the sun shine in  
Now I find I've been blinded  
By the cold and wintery wind  
She disguised behind her eyes  
Oh what a fool I've been  
  
[Chorus x 2]
