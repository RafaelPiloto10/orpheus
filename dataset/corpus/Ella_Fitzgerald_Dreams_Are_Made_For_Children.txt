Dim the light, little man  
And tonight, little man  
On a ship of dreams you'll sail  
  
Dreams are made for children  
And a dream is a fairytale  
  
You don't need a magic wand  
To see all that lies beyond  
If you just believe in fairyland  
Fairyland appears  
  
Dream away, little man  
Dream as long as you can  
Don't grow up, I beg of you  
  
Dreams are made for children  
And for children dreams come true
