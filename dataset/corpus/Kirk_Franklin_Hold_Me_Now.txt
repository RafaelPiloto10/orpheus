The spring of April's gone  
The leaves have all turned brown.  
The children are all grown up and there's no one around.  
I'm looking over my life  
and all the mistakes, I've made.  
And I'm afraid afraid.  
  
See, somebody told me that - You would wash all my sins.  
And cleanse me from the scars - that are so deep within.  
So I'm calling to You. If You can hear me - I don't how.  
  
I was wonderin'  
Can You hold me now?  
  
You are the only one that patient when I fall.  
Your angels come to save me, everytime I call.  
You don't laugh at me, when I make mistakes and cry.  
You're not like man. You understand me.  
  
See, people change one day, they don't like you, the next they do.  
I wish that everyone could love me just like You.  
  
So here I am, this sinful man, peace won't allow.  
  
I was wonderin'  
Can You hold me now?  
I was wonderin'  
Can You hold me now?  
  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
  
Oh-oh-oh-oh  
  
To every broken person that may hear this song.  
To every boy or girl that feel their smile is gone.  
I know exactly how it feels to lay in the bed at night.  
And cry. And cry.  
  
Don't you worry, God is faithful and He cares.  
About the tears you drop and the pain you feel - He's there.  
  
When you are weak, that's when He's strong even though you don't know how.  
  
Yeah-yeah-yeah  
Yeah-yeah-yeah  
Yeah-yeah!  
  
God can, and He will - hold you now.  
God can, and He will - hold you now.  
God can, and He will - hold you now.  
  
Don't you worry - He can hold you now.  
  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
  
Oh-oh-oh-oh
