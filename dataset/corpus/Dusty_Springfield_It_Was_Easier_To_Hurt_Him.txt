I should have told him that I needed him  
When I had the chance  
And now he's left me, and it's all over  
Goodbye romance  
  
I should have told him then  
Over and over again that I love him  
  
But it was easier to hurt him, ooh  
It was easier to hurt him, ooh  
It was easier to hurt him  
That's what I thought was being so smart  
  
The way I cheated him and mistreated him  
How could I forget?  
I was so sure that he would always trust in me  
Oh, that I'd take a bet, no, no, no  
  
He'd never say goodbye but here all alone am I  
He is gone now  
  
'Cause it was easier to hurt him, what could I do?  
It was easier to hurt him, I should have known better  
It was easier to hurt him  
That's what I thought was being so smart, oh, oh  
  
It was easier to hurt him, I need him so bad  
It was easier to hurt him, what did I do?  
It was easier to hurt him, I should have known better  
It was easier to hurt him, I need him so bad
