I got to say it and it's hard for me  
You got me crying like I thought I would never be  
Love is believing but you let me down  
How can I love you when you ain't around  
And I  
  
Get to the morning and you never call  
Love should be everything or not at all  
And it don't matter whatever you do  
I made a life out of loving you  
  
Only to find any dream that I follow is dying  
I'm crying in the rain  
I could be searching my world for a love everlasting  
Feeling no pain  
When will we meet again  
  
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker  
Is it a lesson that I never knew?  
Gotta get out of the spell that I'm under  
My love for you  
  
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker  
When I was being what you want me to be?  
Suddenly everything I ever wanted has passed me by  
This world may end  
Not you and I  
  
My love is stronger than the universe  
My soul is crying for you  
And that cannot be reversed  
You made the rules and you could not see  
You made a life out of hurting me  
  
Out of my mind  
I am held by the power of you love  
Tell me when do we try  
Why should we say goodbye?  
  
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker  
When I was being what you want me to be?  
Suddenly everything I ever wanted has passed me by  
  
Oh  
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker  
Is it a lesson that I never knew?  
Suddenly everything I ever wanted  
My love for you, ooh  
  
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
