I ain't got nobody since she left me.  
And I don't know why, but I'm startin' to cry.  
I ain't got nobody since she left me.  
And I can't figure out how I'm gonna' get by.  
I ain't got nobody since she left me.  
I don't know why, I been down all season,  
I ain't got nobody since she left me.  
'cause there ain't no reason for the girl to be leavin' me.  
  
Chorus  
I don't know how I'll ever get by without you.  
Nobody, no ... nobody.  
I'm startin' to realize my fate.  
Nobody, no ... nobody.  
I'm ready to make up and give another try to live with you.  
Nobody, no ... nobody.  
I hope for our love and us, it's not too late ... too late.  
Nobody, nobody.  
  
I ain't got nobody since she left me.  
Oh, and I don't really think that she'll ever come back.  
I ain't got nobody since she left me.  
If she don't come back, I'll have a love attack.  
I ain't got nobody since she left me.  
And my tears are like rain, fallin' down on my face.  
I ain't got nobody since she left me.  
'cause I know she's the girl that I'll never replace.
