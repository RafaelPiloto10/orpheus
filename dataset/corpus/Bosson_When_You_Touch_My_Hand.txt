Lyrics:bosson, music: bosson  
You're close to me, still so far away  
Wanna take my hand, but something's in the way  
Sometimes I get the feeling that you don't care  
I know you've got it tough, but it's just not fair  
What about me...you see...  
Chorus:  
When you touch my hand  
I wanna fly to wonderland, with you  
When you look at me  
With the cutest smile man can see your dignity  
The show goes on, I am used to the scene  
It's the same old song, love can be so mean  
Honey stop playing the silly game  
I know you've got another but he'll never be  
What I'll be...for you...  
Chorus  
Come on baby why can't you see  
We could run this thing together just you and me  
I beg you please I'm down on my knees  
One day you will understand how much  
You mean to me  
Chorus
