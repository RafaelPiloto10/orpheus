Wake up here I go  
Cram it all down my throat  
Stomach so full that I wish I could choke  
  
Seven a.m. my heads already in a spin  
As soon as I'm out the door  
Bam it hits me like a ton of those red bricks  
Can't dig myself out of this highest ditch  
This madness  
  
I swear sometimes I can't tell  
Which way is up  
Which way is down  
It's all up in my face  
I need to push it away  
Somebody push it away  
So all I can hear  
Is a simple song  
Sing along now  
La la la la la  
La la la la  
La la la la la  
La la la la  
  
Mid day sun beating on the concrete  
Burning up my feet  
To many cars in the street  
The noise  
The red  
The green  
It makes me wanna scream  
  
Five o'clock knocks  
Bumper on bumper on bumper  
Horns honking  
Nobody's looking  
But everyone's talking  
It's another day  
On this highway  
  
I swear sometimes I can't tell  
Which way is up  
Which way is down  
It's all up in my face  
I need to push it away  
Somebody push it away  
Cause all I wanna here  
Is a simple song  
Sing along now  
La la la la la  
La la la la  
La la la la la  
La la la la  
  
Hey!  
  
Sing along now  
Sing along  
  
What I'd give  
To turn it off  
And make it stop  
Make it stop  
Gotta make it stop  
So all that I can here  
Is a simple song oh  
  
Sing along now  
La la la la la  
La la la la  
La la la la la  
La la la la  
La la la la la  
La la la la  
La la la la la  
La da da da
