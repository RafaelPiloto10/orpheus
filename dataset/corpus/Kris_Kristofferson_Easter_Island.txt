Guarding the carcass, we stripped and divided  
To carve up and covet they wait there alone  
Keeping the secret the rest have forgotten  
And staring in silence from sockets of stone  
Built and obeyed with the best of intentions  
Stranger than truth and as lost and alone  
Stranded like dogs in a star-spangled manger  
No good to nothing not even their own  
Holy-O-my God-I  
Can't see the stars in the sky  
For the sun in my eye  
She's like a dream that a world quit believin'  
Caught in the action back to the sea  
How many more might have come from that mountain?  
Barely the creatures they struggled to be  
Surely the death of so grand an illusion  
Left us with legends too great to ignore  
Stone-cut survivors of ancient dimensions  
Lost in the wonder they came to explore.  
Holy star light far brighter  
Than the sun in your eye  
Singing thy will be done  
Holy-O-my God-I  
Can't see the stars in the sky  
For the sun in my eye  
Holy star light far brighter  
Than the sun in your eye  
Singing thy will be done
