I really can't stay  
Baby it's cold outside  
I've got to go away  
Baby it's cold outside  
This evening has been  
Been hoping that you'd drop in  
So very nice  
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice  
My mother will start to worry  
Beautiful, what's your hurry  
My father will be pacing the floor  
Listen to the fireplace roar  
So really I'd better scurry  
Beautiful, please don't hurry  
Well Maybe just a half a drink more  
Put some music on while I pour  
  
The neighbors might think  
Baby, it's bad out there  
Say, what's in this drink  
No cabs to be had out there  
I wish I knew how  
Your eyes are like starlight now  
To break this spell  
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell  
I ought to say no, no, no, sir  
Mind if I move a little closer  
At least I'm gonna say that I tried  
What's the sense in hurting my pride  
I really can't stay  
Baby don't hold out  
Ah, but it's cold outside  
  
C'mon baby  
  
I simply must go  
Baby, it's cold outside  
The answer is no  
Ooh baby, it's cold outside  
This welcome has been  
I'm lucky that you dropped in  
So nice and warm  
Look out the window at that storm  
My sister will be suspicious  
Man, your lips look so delicious  
My brother will be there at the door  
Waves upon a tropical shore  
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious  
Gosh your lips look delicious  
Well maybe just a half a drink more  
Never such a blizzard before  
  
I've got to go home  
Oh, baby, you'll freeze out there  
Say, lend me your comb  
It's up to your knees out there  
You've really been grand  
Your eyes are like starlight now  
But don't you see  
How can you do this thing to me  
There's bound to be talk tomorrow  
Making my life long sorrow  
At least there will be plenty implied  
If you caught pneumonia and died  
I really can't stay  
Get over that old out  
Ah, but it's cold outside  
  
Baby it's cold outside  
  
Brr its cold  
It's cold out there  
Cant you stay awhile longer baby  
Well, I really shouldn't, alright  
  
Make it worth your while baby  
Ah, do that again
