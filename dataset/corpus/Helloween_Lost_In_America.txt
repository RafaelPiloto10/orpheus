We are stranded in belize  
Ten hours we must wait  
They started with a flight show  
So the airport opens late  
Nobody really told us  
Nobody seems to know  
Now we're sitting here all drinking  
We hope to catch the show  
  
Finally they make the call  
We toddle to the boarding  
In the plane we're drunk and loud  
When the captain gives a shout  
  
We are high  
We are far  
But we wonder where we are  
We are lost  
Lost in america  
There's a cloud  
There's a star  
We should plunder the sky bar  
We are lost  
Lost in america  
  
Now the captain says the gauges  
Don't really seem to be  
In the best trustworthy status  
As far as he could see  
Some ridiculous disturbance  
Or a simple full breakdown  
Makes it hopeless to impossible  
To measure where we're bound for  
  
Finally they make the call  
We toddle to the boarding  
In the plane we're drunk and loud  
When the captain gives a shout  
  
We are high  
We are far  
But we wonder where we are  
We are lost  
Lost in america  
There's a cloud  
There's a star  
We should plunder the sky bar  
We are lost  
Lost in america  
  
We are high  
We are far  
But we wonder where we are  
We are lost  
Lost in america  
There's a cloud  
There's a star  
We should plunder the sky bar  
We are lost  
Lost in america  
  
We are high  
We are far  
But we wonder where we are  
We are lost  
Lost in america
