You're kissing me  
And saying I'm the one you need  
To keep you warm  
And lay with you tonight  
Baby I feel the same way  
I don't want to leave  
want to hold you close  
And feel your love inside  
But I don't want to play myself  
Cause I know you're with someone else  
And I don't need complications in my life  
And I don't want to fall back in  
And get caught up in you again  
Boy I'm so conflicted in my mind  
  
[Chorus]  
You keep saying stay the night  
Just let me rock you till the morning light  
It's cold outside  
And much too late to drive  
You know I need you baby  
I'm so lost without your love  
  
Obviously, procrastinating just to be  
Close to you a little longer now  
It's hard for me to break away from you baby  
Never could resist you  
And I still haven't learned how  
And I don't want to be a fool  
But it's hard when it comes to you  
And I'm feeling vulnerable tonight  
Cause I don't want to miss the chance  
Of reliving our sweet romance  
Boy I'm so confused down deep inside  
  
[Chorus]
