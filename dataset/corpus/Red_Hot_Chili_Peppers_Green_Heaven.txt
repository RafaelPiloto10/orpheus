About this planet, there is something I know  
There's a very big difference between above and below  
A friend foe, or bro, leave your body on the floor  
Let your spirit fly away like the soul of a crow  
Here, above land, man has laid his plan  
And yes, it does include the Ku Klux Klan  
We got a government so twisted and bent  
Bombs, tanks and guns is how our money is spent  
We got V.D., heroin, greed and prostitution  
Tension, aggravation, L. Ron Hubbard solution  
Not to mention hard-core chemical pollution  
If you think you're just away, you're in a mental institution  
And that's a heart felt shame  
'cause everyone's crazy, everyone's the same  
So, why should only Larry, Curly and Moe be to blame?  
Time now to take you to a different place  
Where peace lovin' whales flow through liquid outer space  
A groovin' and a gliddin' as graceful as lace  
A never losing touch with the ocean's embrace  
Diviner than the dolphin, that there is none  
'Cause dolphins just-a like to have a lot of fun  
No one tells 'em how their life is run  
And no one points at them with a gun  
They have a lot of love for every living creature  
The smile of a dolphin is a built in feature  
They be movin' in schools but everyone's the teacher  
Someday mister dolphin, I know I'm go'n to meet you  
Back to the land of the police man  
Where he does whatever he says he can  
Including hating you because you're a Jew  
Or beating black ass, that's nothing new  
Trigger happy cops, they just like to brawl  
They use guns, clubs, gas, but that's not all  
They got puke, ridden prisons and sex sick jails  
Fuck the poor, if you're rich you pay the bail  
So support your police, support your local wars  
That's the way to open economic doors  
Why do we do it? 'Cause the president's a whore  
We assume the position to sell the ammunition  
What the fuck? It's the american tradition  
Along with going fishin' apple pies in the kitchen  
Isn't it bitchin' seeing dead men in ditches?
