I'm the living result  
I'm a man who's been hurt a little too much  
And I've tasted the bitterness of my own tears  
Sadness is all my lonely heart can feel  
I can't stand up for falling down  
I can't stand up for falling down  
Simple though love is  
Still it confused me  
Why I'm not loved the way I should be  
Now I've lived with heartaches  
And I've roomed with fear  
I've dealt with despair  
And I've wrestled with tears  
I can't stand up for falling down  
I can't stand up for falling down  
The vow that we made  
You broke it in two  
But that don't stop me from loving you  
I can't stand up for falling down  
I can't stand up for falling down
