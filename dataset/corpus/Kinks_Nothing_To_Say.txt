Remember walking with you by my side  
You were my papa and I was your pride  
Now I've got children and I'm going grey  
No time for talking I got nothin' to say  
Those Sunday dinners that we had at home  
Now I've got a house and I've got friends of my own  
We can't do tomorrow what we did yesterday  
It's best that we're going our separate ways, ok  
How is your rheumatism (nothing to say)  
How are your chillblains (nothing to say)  
How's Aunty Mabel (nothing to say)  
So far papa, I got nothin' to say, ok  
Those happy days we spent together  
We thought our world would never change  
How the days go by  
And things will never be the same  
You keep pretending that everything's fine  
So you make small talk to help pass the time  
But all the words that you spit from your face  
Add up to nothin' you got nothin' to say  
How are those noisy neighbors next door  
I'll have to go soon ''cause I'm getting bored  
I gotta be home early to see a good play  
So far papa, I got nothin' to say  
How is your life insurance (nothing to say)  
How is your trade union (nothing to say)  
How is your independence (nothing to say)  
So for papa, I got nothin' to say
