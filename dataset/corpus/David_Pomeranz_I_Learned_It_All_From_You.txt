I was a man of convinction  
Itchin' in pure over-drive  
Burning both ends of the candle  
Searching for meaning in life  
Until that one night when it happened  
You took my soul by surprise  
And suddenly I knew the answer  
There in the blue of your eyes  
I learned it  
  
I learned it all from you  
I learned it all from you  
I heard it all ring true  
Everything I ever knew  
I learned it all from you  
  
My body flew back through the ages  
Where sages all wrote in stone  
You showed me what I was missing  
You helped me to find my way home  
I learned it  
  
I learned it all from you  
I learned it all from you  
I heard it all ring true  
Everything I ever knew  
I learned it all from you  
  
I learned it all from you  
I learned it all from you  
I heard it all ring true  
Everything I ever knew  
I learned it all from  
I learned it  
  
I learned it all from you  
I learned it all from you  
I heard it all ring true  
Everything I ever knew  
I learned it all from you
