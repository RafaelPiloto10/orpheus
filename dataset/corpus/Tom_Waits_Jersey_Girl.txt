Got no time for the corner boys,  
Down in the street makin' all that noise,  
Don't want no whores on eighth avenue,  
Cause tonight I'm gonna be with you.  
  
'Cause tonight I'm gonna take that ride,  
Across the river to the jersey side,  
Take my baby to the carnival,  
And I'll take you on all the rides,  
Sing sha la la la la la sha la la la.  
  
Down the shore everything's alright,  
You're with your baby on a Saturday night,  
Don't you know that all my dreams come true,  
When I'm walkin' down the street with you,  
Sing sha la la la la la sha la la la.  
  
You know she thrills me with all her charms,  
When I'm wrapped up in my baby's arms,  
My little angel gives me everything,  
I know someday that she'll wear my ring.  
  
So don't bother me cause I got no time,  
I'm on my way to see that girl of mine,  
Nothin' else matters in this whole wide world,  
When you're in love with a jersey girl,  
Sing sha la la la la la la.  
  
And I call your name, I can't sleep at night,  
Sha la la la la la la.
