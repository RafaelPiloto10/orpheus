There was a time  
When I could breath my life in you  
One by one  
Your pale fingers started to move  
And I touched your face  
And all life was erased  
You smiled like an angel  
(falling from grace)  
  
We've been slaves to this love  
From the moment we touched  
And keep begging for more  
Of this resurrection  
  
We've been slaves to this love  
From the moment we touched  
And keep begging for more  
Of this resurrection  
  
You kissed my lips  
With those once cold fingertips  
You reached out for me  
And oh how you missed  
You touched my face  
And all life was erased  
You smiled like an angel  
(Falling from grace)  
  
We've been slaves to this love  
From the moment we touched  
And keep begging for more  
Of this resurrection  
  
We've been slaves to this love  
From the moment we touched  
And keep begging for more  
Of this resurrection
