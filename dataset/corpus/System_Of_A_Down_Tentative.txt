Who wants to come with me and melt in the sun?  
Superstition taking all of us for a ride  
Bombs overtaken by the signs of the light  
The bombs are falling overhead with no sight  
While you talking all detached, so tell us  
  
Where you going,  
To the bottom?  
Do you hear us?  
We are rotting  
  
We're going down  
In a spiral to the ground  
No one, No one's gonna save us now  
  
Ceremonies have killed religions for they provide  
The masked comforts to delusional,  
They're all in fright  
The true believer's head was bathed in sunlight  
While you are walking all detached, so tell us  
  
Where you going,  
To the bottom?  
Do you hear us?  
We are rotting  
  
We're going down  
In a spiral to the ground  
No one, No one's gonna save us now  
  
Not even God  
No one saved us  
No one's gonna save us  
  
Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall?  
  
Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall?  
  
Where do you expect them to go when the bombs fall?  
  
Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall?  
  
Superstition taking all of us for a ride  
Mimes overtaken by the signs of the Right  
The bombs are falling overhead with no sight  
While you are talking all detached, detached, detached, detached, detached  
  
We're going down  
In a spiral to the ground  
No one, No one's gonna save us now  
  
Not even God  
No one saved us  
No one saved us  
No one saved us  
No one's gonna save us now  
  
Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall
