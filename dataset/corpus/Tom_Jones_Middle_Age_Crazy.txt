Today he traded his '98 Oldsmobile  
He got a heck of a deal on a new Porsche car  
He isn't wearing his usual gray business suits  
He's got jeans and high boots with an embroidered star  
'Cause today he's forty years old, going on twenty  
But don't look for the gray in his hair  
'Cause he ain't got any  
He's got a young thing beside him  
That just melts in his hands  
And he's middle aged crazy  
Trying to prove he still can  
He's got a woman he's loved for a long, long time at home  
But the thrill is all gone, when they turn down the lights  
And today he's forty years old, going on twenty  
And don't look for the gray in his hair  
'Cause he ain't got any  
And that young thing beside him, you know she understands  
He's just middle aged crazy  
Trying to prove he still can  
Yes, he's middle aged crazy  
Trying to prove he still can
