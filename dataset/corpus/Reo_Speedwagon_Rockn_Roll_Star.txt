I was just a boy when the river ran dry  
And I can still remember my mama cry  
She said "Son leave as fast as you can  
But don't waste your life in this rock 'n' roll band"  
I saw the light and left as fast as I could  
I knew deep down it was gonna do me good  
So I threw my Fender in an old friend's car  
I knew I'd come home a rock n'roll star  
  
So we hit the road but the road hit back  
We thought we'd take the world with a hit and run attack  
Now I'm center stage but it feels bizarre  
Despite new cars and caviar  
  
An overnight success created by the press  
But they'll eat you up if you show them any stress  
So I lick my wounds and I hide my scars  
The whole world thinks I'm a rock n' roll star  
  
Rock 'n' roll star, rock 'n' roll star  
That's what they call you  
That's not what you are  
Rock 'n' roll star, rock 'n' roll star  
I still wanna be a rock 'n' roll star  
  
So we got a break in our whirlwind tour  
I called home said I'm comin' home for sure  
I'm tired of hurry up, make the plane, jump in the car  
I'm home on loan, I'm a rock 'n' roll star
