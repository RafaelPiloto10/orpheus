There've been so many girls that I have known  
I've made so many cry, yet I still wonder why  
Here comes a little girl, I see her walking down the street  
She's all by herself, I try to knock her off her feet  
But, she'll never break, never break, this heart of stone  
Whoa this heart of stone darling  
  
What's different about her? I don't really know  
No matter how I try, I just can't make her cry  
  
Well don't keep on looking, that same old way  
If you try acting sad, oh you'll only make me glad  
  
You better listen here little girl, you go on walking down the street  
I ain't got no love, I ain't the kind you wanna meet  
'Cause you'll never, no, never break, this heart of stone  
Whoa this heart of stone darling  
This heart of stone  
  
Oh you'll never break it baby  
No, this heart of stone  
No, never try and break it darling  
No, no, never break, this heart of stone  
Whoa, whoa, this heart of stone  
This stone
