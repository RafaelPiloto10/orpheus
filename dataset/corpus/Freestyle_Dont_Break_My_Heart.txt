You, you keep on trying  
Trying to tear me apart  
and I knew from the very start  
that you, you steal my heart  
Because of you I'm crying  
I never know that you when you're lying  
What we have must be  
You can't hide what you really feel  
  
You had my heart  
Your my dream from the start  
You know I need you baby  
You touch my soul  
Do you want me to go  
I thought I loved you baby  
  
Chorus:  
So don't break my heart  
Finish what you started baby  
Don't break my heart  
I can't live without you  
Don't break my heart  
My love was so true baby  
Don't break my heart  
Don't break my heart  
Don't break my heart  
  
You, you keep denying  
Denying that you really cared  
Stop, Stop Playing this game  
Show me your love is still there  
The love, the love I have inside me ever grows  
for ever stronger  
What we have must be  
You can't hide what you really feel  
  
You had my heart  
Your my dream from the start  
You know I need you baby  
You touch my soul  
Do you want me to go  
I thought I loved you baby  
  
Chorus:  
So don't break my heart  
Finish what you started baby  
Don't break my heart  
I can't live without you  
Don't break my heart  
My love was so true baby  
Don't break my heart  
ohhh ohhh  
So don't break my heart  
Finish what you started baby  
Don't break my heart  
I can't live without you  
Don't break my heart  
My love was so true baby  
Don't break my heart  
Don't break my heart  
Don't break my heart  
  
You had my heart  
Your my dream from the start  
You know I need you baby(you know I need you baby)  
You touch my soul  
Do you want me to go  
I thought I loved you baby(i loved you baby  
  
Chorus:  
So don't break my heart  
Finish what you started baby  
Don't break my heart  
I can't live without you  
Don't break my heart  
My love was so true baby  
Don't break my heart  
Don't break my heart  
Don't break my heart
