Every single heart needs a home  
Everybody needs a touch of human kindness  
It's no wonder we feel alone  
'cause all in all we need each other  
  
Everybody has a day  
When it seems that everything is going no where  
Looking for a touch from above to find god's love  
And in it all you know we need each other  
Let's understand that we're in it together  
  
(chorus) 1  
Take a ride through the streets of gold  
On a train that's going to set us free  
Hand in hand we will share the load  
We're strong together as a family tree  
Just reach out and you know i'll be there  
In your time of need  
That's the way it's meant to be  
  
If somebody lets you down  
Don't you want to turn away and run for cover?  
Don't let it steal your joy don't let it destroy  
'cause in it all you know we need each other  
It's by design that we're in it together  
  
(chorus) 2  
Take a ride through the streets of gold  
On a train that's going to set us free  
Hand in hand we will share the load  
We're strong together as a family tree  
Just reach out and you know i'll be there  
You can count on me  
That's the way it's meant to be  
We're brothers and sisters  
We're in it together  
'cause that's the way he meant it to be
