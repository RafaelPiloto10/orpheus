Last thing I remember  
Is the freezing cold water  
Reaching up just to swallow me whole.  
Ice in the rigging and howling wind,  
  
Shock to my body  
As we tumbled in, mercy from God.  
My brothers and the others  
Are lost at sea,  
  
I alone am returned to tell thee.  
Hidden in ice for a century to walk  
The world again, Lord have mercy  
On the frozen man.  
  
Next words that were spoken to me,  
Nurse asked me what my name might be.  
She was all in white  
At the foot of my bed,  
  
I said angel of mercy  
I'm alive or am I dead?  
My name is William James McPhee,  
I was born in 1843.  
  
Raised in Liverpool by the sea  
But that ain't who I am,  
Lord have mercy  
On the frozen man.  
  
It took a lot of money  
To start my heart,  
To peg my leg and to buy my eye.  
The newspapers call me  
  
The state of the art,  
And the children,  
When they see me, cry.  
I thought it would be nice  
  
Just to visit my grave,  
See what kind of tombstone I might have.  
I saw my wife and my daughter  
And it seemed so strange,  
  
Both of them dead and gone  
From extreme old age.  
See here, when I die  
Make sure I'm gone,  
  
Don't leave 'em nothing to work on.  
You can raise your arm,  
You can wiggle your hand,  
Not unlike myself,  
  
And you can wave goodbye  
To the frozen man.  
  
I know what it means  
To freeze to death,  
To lose a little life  
With every breath.  
  
To say goodbye to  
Life on earth  
And come around again,  
Lord have mercy  
  
On the frozen man,  
Lord have mercy  
On the frozen man.
