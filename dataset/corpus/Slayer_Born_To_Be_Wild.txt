Get your motor running  
Head out on the highway  
Looking for adventure  
And whatever comes our way  
  
Ya' darling go make it happen  
Leave the world in a dull disgrace  
Fire all your guns and once in  
Explode into space  
  
I like smoke and lightning  
Heavy metal thunder  
Racing with the wind  
And the feeling that I'm under  
  
Ya' darling go make it happen  
Leave the world in a dull disgrace  
Fire all your guns and once in  
Explode into space  
  
Like a true metal child  
We were born, born to be wild  
We can climb so high  
I never want to die  
Born to be wild  
Born to be wild  
  
Get your motor running  
Head out on the highway  
Looking for some danger  
And take whatever comes our way  
  
Ya' darling go make it happen  
Leave the world in a dull disgrace  
Fire all your guns and once in  
Explode into space  
  
Like a true metal child  
We were born, born to be wild  
We can climb so high  
I never want to die  
Born to be wild  
Born to be wild
