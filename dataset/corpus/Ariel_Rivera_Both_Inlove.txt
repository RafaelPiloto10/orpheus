You may not show it  
I may not know it  
But it's real as it can be  
You need no season  
I need no reason  
When it's your heart singin'  
This was meant to be  
  
When you're both in love  
Both in love...  
Seein' eye to eye and feelin'  
Heart to heart  
Yes, we're both in love  
Both in love  
With each other from the start  
Ev'rythin's magic  
When we're together  
In this wonderland for two  
There's nothing like it  
Won't try to hide it  
Anyone can tell there's nothin' you can do  
  
There's no need to worry  
Which starts we're under  
We've got all we need to know  
We have the answer  
Forever after  
You're the one for me  
And I'm the one for you  
(Instrumental)
