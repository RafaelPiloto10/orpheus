Chestnuts roasting on an open fire  
Jack Frost nipping at your nose  
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir  
And folks dressed up like Eskimos  
  
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe  
Will help to make the season bright  
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow  
Will find it hard to sleep tonight  
  
They know that Santa's on his way  
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh  
And every mother's child is gonna spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly  
  
And so I'm offering this simple phrase  
To kids from one to ninety-two  
Though it's been said many times, many ways  
Merry Christmas to you  
  
They know that Santa's on his way (he's on his way)  
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh  
And every mother's child is gonna spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly  
  
And so I'm offering this, this simple phrase  
To kids from one to ninety-two  
Although it's been said many times, many ways  
Merry Christmas yeah-yeah  
Merry Christmas  
Merry Christmas oh no-oh-whoa-whoa yeah oh  
Oh yeah-yeah  
To you (merry Christmas, Merry Christmas)  
Oh yeah-yeah  
Merry Christmas
