You are my strength when I am weak  
You are the treasure that I seek  
You are my all in all  
  
Seeking You as a precious jewel  
Lord, to give up I'd be a fool  
You are my all in all  
  
Jesus, Lamb of God  
Worthy is Your name  
Jesus, Lamb of God  
Worthy is Your name  
Oh, Your name is worthy  
  
Taking my sin, my cross, my shame  
Rising again I bless Your name  
(I bless Your name)  
You are my all in all  
(Oh yes you are, yes you are)  
  
When I fall down You pick me up  
When I am dry You fill my cup  
(You fill my cup)  
You are my all in all  
(My all, Lord, hallelujah)  
  
Jesus, Lamb of God  
Worthy is Your name  
(Oh, Your name, Your precious name is worthy, Lord)  
Jesus, Lamb of God  
Worthy is Your name  
  
You're my everything  
The beginning and the end  
The first, the last You are  
The great I am  
  
Jesus, Lamb of God  
Worthy is Your name  
Jesus, Lamb of God  
(Oh, my Jesus, my precious Jesus)  
Worthy is Your name  
  
Worthy is Your name  
Worthy is Your name
