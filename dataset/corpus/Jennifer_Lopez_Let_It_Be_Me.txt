If the day comes that you must leave  
Let me be the ground to your feet  
If the day comes that you feel weak  
Let me be the armor you need  
Oh, if you falling in love is a crime  
And the price to pay is my life  
Give me sword, bring all the knives  
Hand me the gun, I will not run  
And when they spare everything but my pride  
Don't you worry, boy, don't you cry  
But when they ask  
Who was the one, who got you love  
Let it be me  
  
If you ever make your last breath  
Let me be the last word you say  
And if right comes, but you choose left  
I will be the first to forgive  
Oh if heaven is a beautiful place  
But those gates have enough space  
And they lock you out  
Spare you no flame  
I will come down  
If they're on my wings  
And when the angels call me a fool  
For giving all grace up for you  
I won't look back  
But when they ask, who did you love  
Let it be me  
  
Let it be me  
That you think of when everything tells you to give it up  
Let it be me that will ankle your soul  
Until the clouds fall out of the sky  
And the snow fall out in July  
Let it be me that you think of  
Let it be the one that you love  
Until the flowers don't blow in May  
And forever until the days  
Let it be me  
Let it be me  
The one that you love  
Let it be me  
Let it be me  
Let it be me  
Let it be me  
Let it be me  
Thank you for crediting me, dl  
Only be me
