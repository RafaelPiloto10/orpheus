I won't go away  
Right here I'll stay  
  
Stand silent in flames  
Stand tall 'till it fades  
  
Shoot me again  
I ain't dead yet (x4)  
  
Shoot me again  
Shoot me again  
Shoot me!  
Shoot me again  
Shoot me again  
C'mon! (x2)  
  
All the shots I take  
I spit back at you  
All the shit you fake  
Comes back to haunt you  
  
All the shots...  
All the shots...  
  
All the shots I take  
What difference did I make?  
All the shots I take  
I spit back at you  
  
I won't go away  
With a bullet in my back!  
Right here I'll stay  
With a bullet in my back!  
  
Shoot me...  
Take a shot  
Shoot me...  
Take a shot  
Shoot me...  
Take a shot  
Shoot me...  
Take a shot  
  
I'll stand on my own  
With a bullet in my back!  
I'm stranded and sold  
With a bullet in my back!  
  
Shoot me again  
I ain't dead yet (x4)  
  
Shoot me again  
Shoot me again  
C'mon!  
Shoot me again  
Shoot me again  
C'mon! (x2)  
  
All the shots I take  
I spit back at you  
All the shit you fake  
Comes back to haunt you  
  
All the shots...  
All the shots...  
  
All the shots I take  
What difference did I make?  
All the shots I take  
I spit back at you  
  
I bite my tongue  
Trying not to shoot back  
No compromise  
My heart won't pump the other way  
  
Wake the sleeping giant  
Wake the beast  
Wake the sleeping dog  
No, let him sleep  
  
I bite my tongue  
Trying not to shoot back...  
  
All the shots I take  
I spit back at you  
All the shit you fake  
Comes back to haunt you  
  
All the shots...  
All the shots...  
  
All the shots I take  
What difference did I make?  
All the shots I take  
I spit back at you
