[Chorus]  
Legalize it don't criticize it,  
Legalize it yea-ah-yea-ah,  
And I will advertise it  
Some call it tamjee,  
Some call it the weed,  
Some call it marijuana,  
Some of them call it ganja,  
Never mind, got to.  
  
Singers smoke it,  
And players of instrument, too  
Legalize it, yea-ha, yea-ah  
That's the best thing you can do,  
Doctors smoke it,  
Nurses smoke it,  
Judges smoke it,  
Even la wyer, too  
So you've got to  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's good for the flu  
Good for asthma,  
Good for tuberculosis,  
Even numara thrombosis  
Go to  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Birds eat it,  
Ants love it,  
Fowls eat it,  
Goats love to play with it  
So you've got to  
  
[Chorus]
