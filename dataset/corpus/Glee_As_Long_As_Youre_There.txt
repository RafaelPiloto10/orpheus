All my life  
I've waited for the right  
Moment to let you know  
I don't wanna let you go  
But now I realize  
There's just no perfect time  
To confess how I feel  
This much I know is real  
So I refuse to  
Waste one more second without you  
Knowing my heart  
  
Baby cause I don't  
Need anything else but your love  
Nothing but you means a thing to me  
I'm incomplete  
When you're not there  
Holding me touching me  
I swear  
All of the risk would just disappear  
And I wouldn't even care  
As long as you're there  
  
Take these words  
Don't let them go unheard  
This is me reaching out  
I hope you can hear me now  
This pain in my heart stands stay  
Taking is yours to break  
Having to try and lose  
Then keep this love from you  
So I refuse to  
Waste one more second  
Without you  
Knowing my heart  
  
Baby cause I don't  
Need anything else but your love  
Nothing but you means a thing to me  
I'm incomplete  
When you're not there  
Holding me touching me  
I swear  
All of the risk would just disappear  
And I wouldn't even care  
As long as you're there  
  
Each day  
And Night  
That I  
Kept it a secret  
And it killed me  
It's time  
To share what I feel inside  
  
I don't  
Need anything else but your love  
Nothing but you means a thing to me  
I'm incomplete  
When you're not there  
Holding me touching me  
I swear  
All of the risk would just disappear  
And I wouldn't even care  
As long as you're there  
As long as you're there
