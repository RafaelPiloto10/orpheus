There's a picture that I carry,  
One we made some time ago  
If they ask who's in the picture with me,  
I say just a girl, I used to know  
  
Just a girl, I used to go around with  
Just a friend, from long ago,  
I don't tell them how lost I am without her  
I say she's just a girl, I used to know.  
  
I say, she's just another girl now  
Just a flame, that's lost it's glow  
And I say, her name has slipped my mind now,  
And she's just a girl, I used to know  
  
Just a girl, I used to spend some time with  
Just a friend, from long ago,  
I don't talk about the nights I cry without her  
I say she's just a girl I used to know  
  
Just a girl I used to know
