Ah, such sweet sound  
The Fiddler on the Fuckin' Roof  
Is that Mr. Bentley Fonzworth?  
  
Indeed it is Sir  
  
Good day, good sir  
How do you do? Look fine  
  
Fantastically well  
I am certainly not fine by far  
But you could say  
I'm close to spectacular  
  
Close to spectacular? How so?  
  
Open your eyes  
Spectacular's right in front of you  
  
Whatever you say, you're spectacular  
  
No I'm fantastically well  
  
Come on man make up your mind  
A minute ago you said you were fine  
  
No I said I'm close to spectacular  
But I'm meeting fine in a minute  
  
Close to spectacular?  
You said you were fantastically well  
  
Exactly  
  
Exactly?? Which one are you?  
Close to spectacular or Fantastically well?  
  
I am certainly and without a doubt  
Fantastically well and was close to Spectacular but I must say  
You just pissed spectacular off  
And don't even mention exactly  
But here comes fine right now  
  
Oh lord, she is fine  
  
Gentlemen  
  
Behold  
  
A lady
