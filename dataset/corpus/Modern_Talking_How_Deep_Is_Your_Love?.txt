You make the morning and you make the night  
You can make darkness turn into light  
How deep is you love  
Is it love  
Whatever you needed I gave you the best  
But you left me bleedin' takin' the best of me  
Is your love  
Is it love  
Is it love  
  
How deep is your love  
Is it deeper than the blue blue sea  
Tell me how deep is your love my friend  
Makin' me believe  
How deep is your love  
Is it deeper than the blue blue sea  
Tell me how deep is your love my friend  
Makin' me believe  
  
When I remember the time that we had  
Feelin' so easy, never forget that night  
Was your love  
Was it love  
Was it love  
  
How deep is your love  
Is it deeper than the blue blue sea  
Tell me how deep is your love my friend  
Makin' me believe  
How deep is your love  
Is it deeper than the blue blue sea  
Tell me how deep is your love my friend  
Makin' me believe  
  
Tell me how deep is your love  
Deeper than the blue blue sea  
How deep is your love
