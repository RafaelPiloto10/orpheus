"One big room full of bad bitches" x8  
  
[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne]  
Fu got the weed, Marl got the gun  
They say numbers don't lie  
Bitch, I'm not the one  
Hammers in ya face, this is not a dream  
And you get in every page in this magazine  
Bumping ugk, talking about a murder  
We roll a Dr. Jay and then we light that Julius Erving  
I got p-ssy on the way and p-ssy on the way out  
Life is a beach and these hoes trying to lay out  
Tunechi, Tunechi, toaster, tooly  
F-ck around and pop ya  
My homies got that white girl  
Call it Lady Gaga  
Glock for Tini, nina colada  
Suck, swallow, semen, saliva  
I'm going at your collar  
F-ck you hoe niggas!  
Weezy go hard, you bitches go figure  
Diamonds in my teeth like I'm a f-cking dope dealer  
You're a dead man walking: Michael Jackson Thriller  
I'm in one big room, full of bad bitches...  
  
(I'm in one big room, full of bad bitches)  
  
It goes: Tunechi, Tunechi  
Toaster, tooly, f-ck around and pop ya  
My homies got that white girl  
Call it Lady Gaga  
It goes: Tunechi, Tunechi  
Toaster, tooly, f-ck around and pop ya  
  
[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]  
Back where I started on my set, in black  
All chrome Glock looking like a platinum plaque  
We don't pack extra clips, we pack extra Gats  
And all my hoes dirty like welcome mats  
Til the wheels fall off: I can fix a flat  
If you're scared go to church and get a scripture tat  
Guns the size of children, now don't be childish  
Be with wild-ass niggas and I am the wildest.  
I'm a motherf-cker, call me Weezy baby  
And on the end of the barrel I got a sweet potato  
My life is a movie, I got a leading lady  
My rooftop drop back like Tom Brady  
I got the world in my hands, skateboard n' my vans  
And all my boys stay strapped like we live in Iran  
I know what I can do, so bitch I do what I can  
Drop the Sorry 4 the Wait, man  
I'm just saying...  
  
I'm in one big room, full of bad bitches...
