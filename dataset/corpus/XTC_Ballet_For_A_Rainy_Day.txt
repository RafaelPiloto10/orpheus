Orange and lemon  
Raincoats roll and tumble  
Together, just liked fruit tipped from a tray  
Pineapple wet heads  
Watch new hairdos crumble  
As scenery sunlight shifts away  
  
Ballet for a rainy day  
Silent film of melting miracle play  
  
Apples and cherries  
Are varnished in water  
Despite, striped awnings bright dismay  
I push my paintbrush  
To conjure a new world  
While this one is slowly washed away  
  
Ballet for a rainy day  
Silent film of melting miracle play  
Dancing out there through my window  
To the backdrop of a slow descending grey  
  
When it rains it rains  
All the colors in my paintbox  
When it rains it rains  
Tickets for the front row seats  
Up on the rooftops  
  
Orange and lemon  
Raincoats roll and tumble  
Together, dropped in diamond disarray  
  
Ballet for a rainy day  
Silent film of melting miracle play  
Dancing out there through my window  
Behind the curtain silver falling  
Ballet for a rainy day  
Silent film of melting miracle play  
Dancing out there through my window  
To the backdrop of a slow descending grey
