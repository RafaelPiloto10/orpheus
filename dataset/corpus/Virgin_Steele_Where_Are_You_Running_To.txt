Hold me, take me in your arms one last time  
I can't bear the thought of your leaving  
This night oh so black  
The starts don't shine  
And you're never, never coming back...  
  
[Chorus]  
Where are you running to now  
Where are you running to now  
Oh babe  
Where are you running to now  
Where are you running to now  
Oh yeah  
  
Silence,  
I'll never hear your sweet voice in my ear  
Just a lonely sound as you disappear  
In the night, the clouds are black  
The starts have died  
And you're never, never coming back  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't you know that it's not easy?  
Don't you know that it's so hard to take?  
Where are you now, is someone with you?  
I'll have to accept that you're not coming back  
No, no more, no more, no more, no more...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Goodbye babe, so long darlin  
I'm never gonna see you again  
Goodbye babe, goodbye babe
