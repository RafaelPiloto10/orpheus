Cheri:  
  
Sing me a song again, Daddy  
Sing me a happy verse.  
Teach me those clever lines you sang  
As you carried me on your shoulders.  
Sing me that hymn that you so loudly  
Sang in church with mom.  
Sing it again to me and fill me  
With all your words of wisdom.  
  
Comforting words of love when I  
Would get home from school in tears.  
Somehow your songs have stayed within me  
Down through all the years.  
Once when my younger heart was broken  
Your shoulder was there to cry on.  
Sing me those songs I know will linger  
Long after you have gone.  
  
I am standing at the threshold  
Of a chapter in my life  
I am asking for your blessing  
As I'm about to be the wife  
Of a man I know who loves me  
And I'm proud to be his bride.  
Dad the time has come for me to leave your side.  
  
So, sing me a song again, Daddy.  
Sing me a lullaby.  
Wrap me inside your arms, Daddy,  
'Though this is not goodbye.  
Your songs will live forever  
In my heart. When times get rough  
The ones I'll most remember  
Are your songs of love.  
  
Jose:  
  
Your songs will live forever  
In my heart. When times get rough  
  
Cheri:  
  
The ones I'll most remember  
Are your songs of love.
