Seen you round I know your face  
Watched you try to grow up with grace  
Seen that heart out on your sleeve  
Like it's so much life you're dying to feel dying to feel  
  
'Cause if you got to steal you've got to steal the show  
It's the spirit of the underdog  
And if you got to break you've got to break the mould  
It's the spirit of the underdog  
  
I've seen you reach that main event  
And make it look like an accident  
Your need for love can't be replaced  
Just put away at least for today at least for today  
  
'Cause if you got to steal you've got to steal the show  
It's the spirit of the underdog  
And if you got to break you've got to break the mould  
It's the spirit of the underdog
