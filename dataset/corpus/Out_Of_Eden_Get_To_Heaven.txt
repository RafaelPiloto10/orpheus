I'd say I'm always happy if you want me to  
But sometimes it's not the case  
My life is not as perfect as it seems to be  
It's simply God's amazing grace  
I'm here to finally let you know  
What keeps me hanging on  
What keeps me going strong  
I'm here to share His love with you  
There is no need to fear to live this life of love  
  
[Chorus:]  
With a little faith, with a little love  
I know we can make it  
I know we can make it  
With a little help sent from God above  
I know we can make it  
I know we can make it through  
  
I know what it takes to be yourself  
Instead of when they put you down  
I can't understand why you choose to hide  
When you should run to the strength I found  
If only you'd see for yourself  
Then you could know the one  
Who loves you so much more  
If only I could help you out  
But God's the only one  
  
What are you waiting for  
  
[Repeat chorus]  
  
It seems to wash away  
Can't find a will to go on  
But I am here to say there's hope  
You must carry on  
Jesus will light your way  
He'll give you all that you need  
No need to be afraid all you've got to do is believe
