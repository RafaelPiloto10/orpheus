I remember sayin'  
She came out of nowhere  
Like the devil in disguise  
I believed it when she told me  
  
That she loved me  
... tellin' lies  
  
Everybody knows her name  
Mona Mona  
Everybody knows her game  
Mona Mona  
  
She's gonna break your heart  
Mona Mona  
(She) Cut you right down  
Then she'll tear you apart  
Mona Mona  
  
You know you'd better try to forget it  
You know you're gonna live to regret it  
I'd really hate to be the one  
To tell you so (I told you so)  
  
Let me take the time to remind you  
You're better off leavin' her behind you  
I really think it's something  
That you ought a know  
You better let her go  
  
Yeah yeah, let her go

Don't you think you'd better let her go  
Let her go
