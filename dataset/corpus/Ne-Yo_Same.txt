(Verse)  
She be playin me music  
That I don't really like  
But it makes her feel sexy  
So it's alright  
  
(Verse)  
She be wantin to go to restaurants  
Where they serve shit I would never eat  
But she say it's an aphrodisiac  
So I tried a lil bit yea  
  
(Pre-Chorus 1)  
We don't got a lot in common  
We don't like a lot of the same things  
More than most of the time  
I find myself compromising  
  
(Pre-Chorus 2)  
She's up when I'm down  
She's on when I'm off  
But when it come to love  
We're cut from the same freaky piece of cloth  
  
(Chorus)  
So we're so different when it come to everything  
But when it come to love we're the same  
Same same  
So we're so different when it come to everything  
But when it come to love we're the same  
Same same  
When it come to love we're the same, yea  
So when it come to love we're the same, yea  
So when it come to love  
  
(Verse)  
I don't like the furniture  
But I let her go and pick it out  
(Let her go and pick it out)  
Really I don't mind the love seat  
Cus that's where she like to get down  
(Get down)  
  
(Verse)  
So we can either watch a movie  
She gon talk through the whole thing  
(Whole thing)  
But all during the previews  
She give me that good  
(Think about it)  
  
(Pre-Chorus 1)  
We don't got a lot in common  
We don't like a lot of the same things  
More than most of the time  
I find myself compromising  
  
(Pre-Chorus 2)  
She's up when I'm down  
She's on when I'm off  
But when it come to love  
We're cut from the same freaky piece of cloth  
  
(Chorus)  
So we're so different when it come to everything  
But when it come to love we're the same  
Same same  
So we're so different when it come to everything  
But when it come to love we're the same  
Same same  
When it come to love we're the same, yea  
So when it come to love we're the same, yea  
  
(Bridge)  
I like it how she like it  
She likes it fast, I take it slow  
I have a guess, she wanna know  
And that's the way it go  
I like the hot, she like the low  
But when it come to sexual  
Baby we're so compatible  
  
(Chorus x2)  
We're so different when it come to everything  
But when it come to love we're the same  
Same same  
So we're so different when it come to everything  
But when it come to love we're the same  
Same same  
When it come to love we're the same, yea  
So when it come to love we're the same, yea
