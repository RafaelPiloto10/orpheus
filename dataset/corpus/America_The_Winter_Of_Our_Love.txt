Found on Heard.  
  
Snow is falling  
Evening calling  
On knees, a calling friends  
Can't you see  
Doesn't help to be  
The end  
  
Strolling through lost times with you  
What were we thinking of  
Could it be they jumped the queue  
In the winter of our love  
  
Baby, we should've known  
Where we were going  
Should've known  
Where we were going  
We're in the sea of destiny  
In the winter of our love  
  
Do you know we're alone out here  
What am I thinkin' of  
Did this come to the time of year  
Called the winter of our love  
  
Baby, we should've known  
Where we were going  
We should've known  
Where we were going  
We're in the sea of destiny  
In the winter of our love  
  
Oh, I needed you so  
Ah, you know, I never, never want to let you go
