Tell me one more time, with your hand in mine, that you love me like you used
to do  
Tell me one more time, that you want me one more time, break my heart in two  
Tell me one more time, with your hand in mine, that you need a love so sweet
and true  
Tell me one more lie, I'll cry you one more cry, tell me that you love me one
more time  
One more time, tell me that you care, one more time, honey I'll be there  
Tell me just once more, like you did before, that you need a love so sweet and
true  
Tell me one more lie, I'll cry you one more cry, tell me that you love me one
more time
