I woke up this morning and the sun was gone  
Turned on some music to start my day  
I lost myself in a familiar song  
Closed my eyes and I slipped away  
Ooh, ooh, ooh  
  
(More than a feeling)  
(More than a feeling)  
Well it's more than a feeling  
(More than a feeling)  
When I hear that old song they used to play  
(More than a feeling)  
And I begin dreaming  
(More than a feeling)  
Till I see Mary Ann walk away  
  
When I'm tired and I think I'm cold  
I hide in my music and forget the day  
And dream of a girl that I used to know  
Close my eyes and she slipped away  
Ooh, ooh, ooh  
  
(More than a feeling)  
(More than a feeling)  
Well it's more than a feeling  
(More than a feeling)  
When I hear that old song they used to play  
(More than a feeling)  
And I begin dreaming  
(More than a feeling)  
Till I see Mary Ann walk away  
  
Well it's more than a feeling  
(More than a feeling)  
When I hear that old song they used to play  
(More than a feeling)  
And I begin dreaming  
(More than a feeling)  
Till I see Mary Ann walk away  
  
Close my eyes and slip away
