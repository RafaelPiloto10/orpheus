Here we are in this big old empty room, staring each other down  
You want me just as much as I want you, let's stop fooling around  
Take me baby, kiss me all over, play with my love  
Bring out what's been in me for far too long  
Baby, you know that's all I've been dreaming of  
Do me baby, like you never done before  
Give it to me till I just can't take no more  
Do me baby, like you never done before  
I want you now, I just can't wait no more, can't wait  
  
Here we are looking for a reason for you to lay me down  
For a love like ours is never out of season, so baby please stop teasing me  
What ya do, I can never love no other, you're the best I ever had  
Whenever we're not close to one another, I just want you so bad  
  
So do me baby, like you never done before  
Give it to me till I just can't take no more  
C'mon, do me baby, like you never done before  
I want you now, I just can't wait no more  
  
I said...  
Do me baby, do me baby, give it to me  
Do me baby, I want you now  
Do me baby, give it to me  
Do me baby, do me baby, don't want to do it all alone  
I want your love.  
Do me baby, give it to me  
Do me baby, this feeling is too strong, make me wait 2 long, I want you now  
  
You're leaving me no choice  
OK, what are you gonna do, you just gonna sit there and watch? alright,  
Are you sure you don't want to close your eyes?  
Well, isn't it supposed to take a long time?  
I'm not gonna stop till the war is over  
Help me! there, OK, OK  
I'm so cold, just hold me
