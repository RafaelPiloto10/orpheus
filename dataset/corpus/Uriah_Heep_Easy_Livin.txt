This is a thing I've never known before  
It's called easy livin'  
This is a place I've never seen before  
And I've been forgiven  
  
Easy livin' and I've been forgiven  
Since you've taken your place in my heart  
  
Somewhere along the lonely road I had tried to find ya  
Day after day on that windy road I had walked behind ya  
  
Easy livin' and I've been forgiven  
Since you've taken your place in my heart  
  
Waiting, watching  
Wishing my whole life away  
Dreaming, thinking  
Ready for my happy day  
And some easy livin'  
  
Somewhere along the lonely road I had tried to find you  
Day after day on that windy road I had walked, walked behind you  
  
Easy livin' and I've been forgiven  
Since you've taken your place in my heart  
Easy livin' and I've been forgiven  
Since you've taken your place in my heart
