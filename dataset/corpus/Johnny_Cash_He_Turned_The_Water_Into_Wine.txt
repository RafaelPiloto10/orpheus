He turned the water into wine he turned the water into wine  
In the little Canan town the word went all around that he turned the water
into wine  
Well he walked upon the Sea of Galilee he walked upon the Sea of Galilee  
Shouted far and wide he calmed the raging tide and walked upon the Sea of
Galilee  
He turned the water into wine he did my lord now, he turned the water into
wine  
In the little Canan town, the word went all around that he turned the water
into wine  
He fed the hungry multitude, he fed the hungry multitude.  
With a little fish and bread, they said every one was fed, 5000  
He fed the hungry multitude.  
He turned the water into wine.  
He did, just a carpenter from Nazareth,  
He turned the water into wine,  
In the little Cana town, the word went all around,  
He turned the water into wine.  
He turned the water into wine
