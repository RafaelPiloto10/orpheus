This is for all the women  
That have been stripped of their innocence  
(She was daddy's little girl)  
But no matter what,  
They kept their head up,  
And this is my way of saying thank you.  
(All alone in the world)  
  
Confused, and don't know what to think,  
Cause she thought that she was  
(She was daddy's little girl)  
Confused, and don't know what to think,  
Cause she thought that she was  
(She was daddy's little girl)  
To find for herself cause she thought that she was,  
(Daddy's little girl)  
(Daddy's little girl)  
She thought that she was,  
She was daddy's little girl  
(Daddy's little girl)  
She was daddy's little girl  
  
I was raised by women,  
A women made me a man,  
It's just to bad that a man,  
Took her innocence.  
And god knows that I,  
I would finish him,  
Diminish him,  
End up killing him.  
Blame it on the ignorance,  
That's where her childhood went,  
New country,  
New language,  
That's how seven years were spent.  
Time you can't buy it,  
And someone, they don't hear  
I know that we bumped heads,  
Just know mum that I'm here.  
  
Cuba peter pan,  
The revelation was great,  
I wanna thank you mum,  
For the way you raised me,  
All your life you wanted  
Only one thing,  
And that was to say  
(She was daddy's little girl)  
  
Confused, and don't know what to think,  
Cause she thought that she was  
(She was daddy's little girl)  
Confused, and don't know what to think,  
Cause she thought that she was  
(She was daddy's little girl)  
To find for herself cause she thought that she was,  
(Daddy's little girl)  
(Daddy's little girl)  
  
She thought that she was,  
She was daddy's little girl  
(Daddy's little girl)  
She was daddy's little girl  
  
Took care of me,  
Just like a mother,  
Till you got pregnant,  
Then you was off to Georgia,  
It was tough how we,  
How we were brought up,  
Tougher for you,  
Cause you had no father,  
Now I understand,  
Now that I'm a man,  
How much a woman needs,  
Someone to call dad,  
You cut through the pain,  
You walked through the rain,  
The game ain't playin' you,  
Baby you play the game.  
Now your in search of,  
That father figure,  
And if you find him,  
He denies you,  
Jenny fuck that niggaare,  
Come as a bitch,  
Even though I know she wish  
  
(She was daddy's little girl)  
  
Confused, and don't know what to think,  
Cause she thought that she was  
(She was daddy's little girl)  
Confused, and don't know what to think,  
Cause she thought that she was  
(She was daddy's little girl)  
To find for herself cause she thought that she was,  
(Daddy's little girl)  
(Daddy's little girl)  
She thought that she was,  
She was daddy's little girl  
(Daddy's little girl)  
She was daddy's little girl  
  
This is for all the women that stayed strong,  
And beat all the odds  
(She was daddy's little girl)  
The ones that have been raped,  
The ones that grew up fatherless  
(All alone in the world)  
Ooooohooo  
But still found a way to raise their kids,  
To do the right thing  
(She was daddy's little girl)  
This is for y'all,  
I love y'all  
(All alone in the world)
