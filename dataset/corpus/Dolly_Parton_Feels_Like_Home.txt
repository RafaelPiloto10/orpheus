Something in your eyes makes me want to lose myself  
Makes me want to lose myself in your arms  
There's something in your voice makes my heart beat fast  
Hope this feeling lasts the rest of my life  
If you knew how lonely my life has been  
And how long I've felt so low  
If you knew how I wanted someone to come along  
And change my life the way you've done  
Feels like home to me  
Feels like home to me  
Feels like I'm all the way back where I come from  
Feels like home to me  
Feels like home to me  
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong  
A window breaks down a long dark street  
And a siren wails in the night  
But I'm alright cause I have you here with me  
And I can almost see through the dark there's light  
If you knew how much this moment means to me  
And how long I've waited for your touch  
If you know how happy you are making me  
I've never thought I'd love anyone so much  
Feels like home to me  
Feels like home to me  
Feels like I'm all the way back where I come from  
Feels like home to me  
Feels like home to me  
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong  
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong
