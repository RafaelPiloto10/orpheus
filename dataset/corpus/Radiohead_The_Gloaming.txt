Genie let out the bottle  
It is now the witching hour  
Genie let out the bottle  
It is now the witching hour  
  
Murderers you're murderers  
We are not the same as you  
  
Genie let out the bottle  
Funny ha ha funny how  
  
When the walls bend  
When the walls bend  
With your breathing  
With your breathing  
  
When the walls bend  
When the walls bend  
With your breathing  
With your breathing  
With your breathing  
  
They will suck you down  
To the other side  
They will suck you down  
To the other side  
They will suck you down  
To the other side  
They will suck you down  
To the other side  
  
To the shadows blue and red  
To the shadows blue and red  
Your alarm bells  
Your alarm bells  
  
To the shadows blue and red  
To the shadows blue and red  
Your alarm bells  
Your alarm bells  
  
Should be ringing  
This is the gloaming
