Well, it won't be long now  
Til that 'ol sun goes down  
And darkness helps me hide my shameful tears  
My wife works all night long  
For a man who's halfway gone  
She's the barmaid in the honky-tonk downstairs  
  
It's a shame she wears the name  
Of a man who's locked and chained  
To a bottle that's destroyin' all hopes and cares  
To the men with hungry eyes  
She works and hides her pride  
She's the barmaid in the honky-tonk downstairs  
  
It's a shame she wears the name  
Of a man who's locked and chained  
To a bottle that's destroyin' all hopes and cares  
To the men with hungry eyes  
She works and hides her pride  
She's the barmaid in the honky-tonk downstairs
