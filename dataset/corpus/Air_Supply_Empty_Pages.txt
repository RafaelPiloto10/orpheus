When you're out in front and your life is unsure  
What have you got goin' for you after every road you turn  
It's magic when you tell me and run your fingers through my hair  
I don't need your persuasion, 'cause I'm already there  
I've just read it through and I said to myself  
That's not really you, I'll keep myself to myself  
It's magic when you tell me, and write the words I want to see  
When I reach the last line, it's just empty for me  
I've been learning so long, about the things you do  
I've been learning so long about you, about you  
  
[Chorus]  
Empty pages I've read you all through  
Empty pages filled with spaces I fell in and I fell in  
Empty pages I've read you all through  
Empty pages filled with spaces I fell in and I fell in.
