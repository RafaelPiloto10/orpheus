I've been away from home  
Was outta sight  
No other change has come  
Who let the boredom in  
  
We got our rockin' rights  
We'll overcome  
The mirror never lies  
We'll show 'em how it's done  
  
We always dress in black  
To be unkind  
We always dress in black  
With you in mind  
  
It's the way of life we live, you know where we are coming from  
It's the way of life we live in, and we're not wrong  
'cause it's the way of life we live, you know where we are coming from  
It's the way of life we live in, we are the strong  
  
We never will deceive  
Take no double-talk  
And all the fat cats bull  
Don't like the way we walk  
  
They spit behind our backs  
Unwelcomed class  
But it's way down deep  
They want to be like us  
  
We always dress in black,  
It's the way of life we live,  
Time is ticking by  
For you life is such a lie  
You clipped your wings to fly  
You could have had it all, but!  
  
Work nine to five  
Finish fifty-five  
Only born to die  
You ever been alive?  
  
We always dress in black,  
It's the way of life we live,
