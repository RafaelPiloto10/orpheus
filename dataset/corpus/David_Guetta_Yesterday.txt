Black hearts, black days  
Raindrops on my window pane  
Streetlights, street life  
Hot blood burning in my veins  
  
History won't drag me down  
I say no, no, no, I say no, no, no  
It's buried six feet underground  
Let it go, go, go, let it go  
  
Hey, hey, what you say?  
I've got no use for yesterday  
I'm gonna live, I'm gonna love  
Right now  
And if tomorrow never comes  
I'm gonna stay forever young  
These lungs of mine  
Were made to scream and shout  
I said hey, hey, what you say?  
It seems like trouble's on the way  
I'm gonna live, I'm gonna love  
Right now  
It's singing oh, oh oh oh  
I said hey, hey, what you say?  
I've got no use for yesterday  
  
Tonight I've got a new life  
I gotta get right and get it moving  
White lies left me snowblind  
But now this time, I see right through it  
  
History won't drag me down  
I say no, no, no, I say no, no, no  
It's buried six feet underground  
Let it go, go, go, let it go  
  
Hey, hey, what you say?  
I've got no use for yesterday  
I'm gonna live, I'm gonna love  
Right now  
And if tomorrow never comes  
I'm gonna stay forever young  
These lungs of mine  
Were made to scream and shout  
I said hey, hey, what you say?  
It seems like trouble's on the way  
I'm gonna live, I'm gonna love  
Right now  
It's singing oh, oh oh oh  
I said hey, hey, what you say?  
I've got no use for yesterday
