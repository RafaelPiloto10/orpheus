True lovers never take it slowly  
When they've found the one and only  
Nothing can replace this feeling  
Knowing someone loves you  
  
It's painted with the pain and glory  
Taking from a known sad story  
Laying out my life before me  
Fearing the unknown  
  
Sharing never showed me much appeal  
And now I'm only praying it's for real  
  
So how does it feel  
When I hold you in my arms  
And you're lying next to me  
Never wanting you to leave  
Until I'll tell you how it feels  
To be cradled like my dreams  
And to know that you love me  
No more wasting time in asking other people  
How does it feel  
  
How does it feel  
  
Forever taken you for granted  
You give me everything I wanted  
I'm so afraid that I might lose you  
But time will let us see  
If everything is real I'm feeling  
Well maybe we've been only dreaming  
And if it's gonna die to save it  
'cause baby I believe  
  
Nothing in the world could make it right  
'cause baby loving you brings me to life  
  
And how does it feel  
When I hold you in my arms  
And you're lying next to me  
Never wanting you to leave  
Until I'll tell you how it feels  
To be cradled like my dreams  
And to know that you love me  
No more wasting time in asking other people  
How does it feel  
  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
  
Nothing in the world could feel this right  
'cause baby you're the best thing in my life  
  
How does it feel  
When I hold you in my arms  
And you're lying next to me  
Never wanting you to leave  
Until I'll tell you how it feels  
To be cradled like my dreams  
And to know that you love me  
No more wasting time in asking other people  
  
How does it feel
