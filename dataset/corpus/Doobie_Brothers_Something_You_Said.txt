I didn't stand a chance  
I heard a voice within  
With just a passing glance  
You made the walls cave in  
  
You were gone baby, without a word  
I got the message loud and clear  
Couldn't help but hear  
As you were walkin' away  
It was somethin' you said  
  
Now I wake up in the night  
Strange things in my head  
Oh, you did it with your eyes  
It must'a been something  
Must'a been something you said  
So say it again  
  
I'm just delirious  
Caught in a waking dream  
Did you mean what you said  
An' did you say what you mean  
  
Mere words, fade away  
You had a language I couldn't miss  
It was on your lips, but  
You didn't get me that way  
It was something you said  
  
Now I wake up in the night  
Strange things in my head  
Oh, you did it with your eyes  
It must'a been something  
Must'a been something you said  
So say it again  
  
In the middle of the night  
All alone in my bed  
It was nothin' you could write  
It must'a been something  
Must'a been something you said
