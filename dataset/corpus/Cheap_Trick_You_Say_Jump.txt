You say jump, I said how high  
You say no, I don't ask why  
You treat me like a fool, like you do  
Kick me when I'm down and out  
Out with you I wish I was  
Instead I'm sittin' all alone tonight, well  
  
You've got a one track mind  
Wish you could just read mine  
I hope you will in time  
  
You say jump, I said how high  
Love you but I don't know why  
Don't say no, not tonight  
You call me or I'll call you  
Just as long as we get through  
I'll do anything for you tonight  
  
Second verse  
All dressed up no place to go  
I say yes and you say no  
What's goin' on  
I really want to know  
You've got a one track mind  
Wish you could just read mine  
I hope you will in time  
  
You say jump, I said how high  
Love you but I don't know why  
Don't say no, not tonight  
You call me or I'll call you  
Just as long as we get through  
I'll do anything for you tonight  
  
I've loved you from the start  
You only broke my heart  
I think I'm losing my mind  
I've felt this way for years  
I'm the one who really cares  
Don't leave me here on my own  
You say jump, I said how high  
Love you but I don't know why  
Don't say no, not tonight  
  
I've loved you from the start  
You only broke my heart  
I'm sittin' all alone tonight  
  
Kick me when I'm down and out  
Out with you I wish I was  
Instead I'm sittin' here on my own  
You've got a one track mind  
Wish you could just read mine  
I hope you will in time  
  
You say jump, I said how high  
Love you but I don't know why  
Don't say no, not tonight
