I was somewhere on the open road,  
Between the east and the west -  
It was a no man's land,  
And rumor says that it was a wilderness.  
Forty days it took me, forty nights,  
I've done some wrong,  
But I've done some right.  
There's no turning back,  
'cause the lights are burning up ahead.  
Lead me to an open road  
And put me on the freeway.  
Lead me to an open road  
And put me on the freeway.  
  
I was traveling twice the speed of sound,  
Down a white line  
Trying to be in the right place  
At the right time.  
You can't stop me making tracks  
Now I'm on the run,  
'cause I set my sights on this road I ride  
It's the only one.  
Lead me to an open road  
And put me on the freeway.  
Lead me to an open road  
And put me on the freeway.  
I can read the signs that I left behind  
Like an open book,  
And I can't forget the things that you said  
And the way you looked.  
I still hold the keys to the memory of the times we've seen,  
So when I look back,  
Things are not as black as they might have been.
