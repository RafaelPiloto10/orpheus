(Traditional, Arr. The Alabama Singers)  
  
Jesus met the woman at the well  
Jesus met the woman at the well  
And he told her, everything that she'd done, that she'd done  
  
And he said, woman, look-a here woman,  
Tell me where is your husband?  
She said whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, I don't have one  
  
He said, woman, look-a here woman,  
They tell me you have five husbands  
And that man you have now sure ain't one  
  
She went running, crying, God help me  
She said whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you must be the prophet  
Because you told me everything that I've done
