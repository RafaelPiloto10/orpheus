Love it's not I who didn't try  
Hard enough, hard enough  
And this is why I'm saying goodbye  
I've had enough, I've had enough  
  
Love you don't see  
The pain in me  
That's plain enough, plain enough  
You're never here to catch the tears  
I cried for us, I cried for us  
  
I'll take my share but I'll be fair  
There's not much stuff  
Easy enough  
And if you choose I'll break the news  
This part is tough, so very tough  
  
I've tried and tried to put aside  
The time to talk, but without luck  
So I'll just pin this note within your coat  
And leave the garden gate unlocked  
  
And this is why I'm saying goodbye  
I've had enough, I've had enough
