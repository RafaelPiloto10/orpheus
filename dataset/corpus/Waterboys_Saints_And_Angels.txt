This is a wide world we travel  
and our paths rarely cross  
And we do a whole lot of living  
in between  
So come and share  
more than time  
We'll put our cares  
far behind  
While we sail  
the ship that never goes to sea  
  
It could be months  
it could be years  
Before we find each other  
once again standing here  
So until then my friend  
I have a wish for you  
Many hearts  
to keep you warm  
Many lights  
to guide you through the storm  
And may the saints and angels  
watch over you  
  
And may the saints and angels  
watch over you  
And may the saints and angels  
watch over you
