If you're gonna rip my heart out,  
Could you use a knife that's dull and rust in color  
(Once I die) there will be no way that you can cover, that scar  
It's hard, I know  
  
And if I get a little blood on you  
Finally the world will know you're guilty  
(Know you're wrong)  
Of taking everything you've gotten from me no heart  
Its hard, I know  
  
[Chorus:]  
Mighty King of Avondale  
I just can't let this go  
Real life ain't no fairy tale  
I just thought you should know  
  
When you're finished with the surgery  
I really hope that you will turn to me  
And tell me all about the fun you had  
When you were cutting up, you were cutting up  
  
[Chorus]  
Mighty King of Avondale  
I just can't let this go  
Real life ain't no fairy tale  
I just thought you should know  
  
Living like a fairy tale  
The mighty King of Avondale  
It all went to his head, this royalty  
I stuck a knife into his back  
Inventiveness is what I lack  
He's always hanging up on loyalty  
  
[Chorus]  
Mighty King of Avondale  
I just can't let this go  
Real life ain't no fairy tale  
I just thought you should know
