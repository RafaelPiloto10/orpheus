One love, one heart  
Let's get together and feel all right  
Hear the children crying (One love)  
Hear the children crying (One heart)  
Sayin', "Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will  
Feel all right. "  
Sayin', "Let's get together and feel all right."  
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa  
  
Let them all pass all their dirty remarks (One love)  
There is one question I'd really love to ask (One  
Heart)  
Is there a place for the hopeless sinner  
Who has hurt all mankind just to save his own?  
Believe me  
  
One love, one heart  
Let's get together and feel all right  
As it was in the beginning (One love)  
So shall it be in the end (One heart)  
Alright, "Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will  
Feel all right. "  
"Let's get together and feel all right."  
One more thing  
  
Let's get together to fight this Holy Armageddon (One  
Love)  
So when the Man comes there will be no, no doom (One  
Song)  
Have pity on those whose chances grow thinner  
There ain't no hiding place from the Father of Creation  
  
Sayin', "One love, one heart  
Let's get together and feel all right. "  
I'm pleading to mankind (One love)  
Oh, Lord (One heart) Whoa.  
  
"Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all  
Right. "  
Let's get together and feel all right.  
(Repeat)
