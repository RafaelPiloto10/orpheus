In the ocean  
Cut, swim, deep the sky  
Like there, I don't know why  
In the forest, there's a clearing  
I run there towards the light  
Sky...  
It's a blue sky  
  
In the earth a hole dig deep, decide  
If I could, I would  
Up for air to swim against the tide  
Hey, hey, hey  
Up toward the sky  
It's a blue sky  
  
To lose along the way  
The spark that set the flame  
To flicker and to fade  
On this the longest day  
  
So wind blow through to my heart  
So wind blow through my soul  
So wind blow through to my heart  
So wind blow through my soul  
So wind blow through to my heart...  
  
You give yourself to this the longest day  
You give yourself, you give it all away  
Two rivers run too deep  
The seasons change and so do I  
The light that strikes the tallest trees  
Will light a way for I  
Will light a way  
Up toward the sky  
It's a blue sky  
  
To lose along the way  
The spark that set the flame  
To flicker and to fade  
On this the longest day  
  
So wind go through to my heart  
So wind blow through my soul  
So wind go through to my heart  
So wind blow through my soul  
So wind go through to my heart  
So wind blow through my soul  
So wind go through to my heart...  
  
You give yourself to this the longest day  
You give yourself, you give it all away
