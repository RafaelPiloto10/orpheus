So take your time  
I wonder if you're here just to use my mind  
Don't take it slow  
You know I've got a place to go  
You always do that  
Something I'm not sure of  
But just for today  
Let go and slide away  
  
I was thinking maybe we could go outside  
Let the night sky cool your foolish pride  
Don't you feel alive  
These are your times and our highs  
  
So take your time  
I wonder which cup you'll drink from  
I hope it's mine  
Beause you always do that something  
Something I'm not sure of  
But just for today  
Let go and burn away  
'Cause I read your mind  
I need it because it takes me where I can't find  
Because you always do that something  
Something I'm not sure of  
But just for today  
Let go and burn away  
  
Repeat  
  
Slide away burn away  
Slide away burn away  
I read your mind  
I read your mind  
'Cause it takes me to where I can't find...
