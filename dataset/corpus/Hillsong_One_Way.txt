I lay my life down at your feet,  
'Cause your the only one I need.  
I took to You and You are always there...  
  
In troubled times it's You I seek,  
I put You first that's all I need.  
I humble all I am all to You...  
  
[Here we go! ]  
  
One Way, Jesus, You're the only one that I could live for...  
One Way, Jesus, You're the only one that I could live for...  
  
You are always always there,  
Everyhow and everywhere.  
Your grace abounds so deeply within me...  
  
You will never ever change,  
Yesterday today the same.  
Forever till forever meets no end...  
  
[Here we go! ]  
  
One Way, Jesus, You're the only one that I could live for.  
One Way, Jesus, You're the only one that I could live for. (x2)  
  
You are the way the truth and the life.  
I live by faith and not by sight for You.  
We're livin' all for You... (x4)  
  
One Way, Jesus, You're the only one that I could live for.  
One Way, Jesus, You're the only one that I could live for. (x2)
