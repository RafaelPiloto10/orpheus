Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree for me  
I've been an awful good girl  
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight  
  
Santa baby, a fifty-four convertible too light blue  
I'll wait up for you, dear  
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight  
  
Think of all the fun I've missed  
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed  
Next year I could be just as good  
If you'd check off my Christmas list  
  
Santa baby, I wanna yacht and really that's not a lot  
I've been an angel all year  
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight  
  
Santa honey, one little things I really do need  
The deed  
To a platinum mine  
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight  
  
Santa cutie, so fill my stocking with a duplex  
And checks  
Sign your X on the line  
Santa cutie, so hurry down the chimney tonight  
  
Come and trim my Christmas tree  
With some decorations bought at Tiffany  
I really do believe in you  
Let's see if you believe in me  
  
Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing  
A ring  
I don't mean on the phone  
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight  
Hurry down the chimney tonight  
Hurry tonight
