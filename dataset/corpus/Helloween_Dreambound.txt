I'm running on a dusty road  
The evil one behind me  
I hear his breath and turn around  
There's no place left to hide here  
  
Wanna break the chains of fear  
There's no way back  
Your whisper in my ear  
Your touch will save me again  
  
You'll change my dream  
You'll guide my way to be  
You are the light  
You turn black into white  
  
You'll change my dream  
You'll bring reality  
You shine so bright  
You turn black into white  
  
I've lost my soul in the game he plays  
No doubt that he won't spare me  
Hunting me, trapped in his chase  
Subject to violation  
  
I'm afraid to fall asleep  
Whether day and night  
But once I'm there in my dreams  
You'll come to save me again  
  
You'll change my dream  
You'll guide my way to be  
You are the light  
You turn black into white  
  
You'll change my dream  
You'll bring reality  
You shine so bright  
You turn black into white  
  
You'll change my dream  
You'll steer my way to be  
You are the light  
You turn black into white  
  
You'll change my dream  
You'll bring reality  
You are the light  
First star I see tonight
