No sleep, no sex for you from your ex-girlfriend  
I was too deep can't let you go and just jump in  
At times i would push my feelings aside to let you feel  
I'm novocaine i'm numb and nothing's real  
  
Like the coldest winter  
I am frozen from you  
  
I was weak before now you've made me  
So numb i can't feel much for you anymore  
I gave you my all my baby  
I'm numb numb numb  
  
But the tears were silent inside you see  
But the tears were silent inside you see  
  
I laid there quiet  
And watched you have your way with me  
I might have cried  
But the tears were silent inside you see  
You called me names  
Made me feel like i was dumb  
I didn't feel a thing  
And now im gone gone gone  
  
Like a battered child  
I got used to your pain but you know it's cause  
  
I was weak before now you've made me  
So numb i can't feel much for you anymore  
I gave you my all my baby  
Im numb numb numb  
  
I was weak before now you've made me  
So numb i can't feel much for you anymore  
I gave you my all my baby  
Im numb numb numb numb numb numb  
  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Uhm da dum dum  
I don't feel a thing  
I don't feel the pain  
Numb

So numb i can't feel much for you anymore  
I gave you my all my baby  
Im numb numb numb numb numb numb
