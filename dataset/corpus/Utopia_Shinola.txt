I have been ringing your doorbell,  
But you left me standing in the hall  
And you make love by the numbers,  
That doesn't mean there's any love at all  
Now there you go with a big explanation  
Why do you waste your time?  
And there you go, under estimation  
Of the thoughts that cross my mind  
This is your promise that you put up for sale  
It's done like a picture from a fairy tale,  
But still there's a difference, let me show it to you,  
This is crapola, this is shinola  
I see you're still in the headlines  
You pegged the latest trend again this week  
I'm not impressed by the outfit,  
Or your revolutionary chic  
And here it comes,  
I see you forming the words, you're performing the exercise  
And here it comes,  
It's the feeling that I heard the same speech a hundred times  
This is the jabber of a chimpanzee  
The motion of your mouth looks much the same to me  
The differentiation might be hard to see,  
But this is crapola, this is shinola  
Everyone's talking, few of them know  
The rest are pretending, they put on a show  
And if there's a message I guess this is it  
Truth isn't easy, the easy part's shit  
And here it comes,  
Now I'm forming the words, I'm performing the exercise  
And here it comes  
It's the feeling that I've made the same speech a million times  
These are your leaders, come on take a look  
They'll lie and cheat and steal then sell the rights to the book  
And these are your neighbors who have swung to the right,  
But you don't have to worry just as long as you're white  
And my generation is just waiting to die  
We'll swallow anything if it would just get us high  
I don't know who's a bigger fool,  
But one thing I know  
This is crapola, this is shinola
