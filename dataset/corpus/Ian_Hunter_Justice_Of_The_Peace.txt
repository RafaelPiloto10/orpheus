It's such a terrible shame it was only a game  
Then her brothers found out seven Johnny be Goode's  
We was only pretending at mummys and daddys  
They totally misunderstood  
Oh what a terrible plight what a terrible fight  
It was too much to bear her father said 'ere  
I think you better sign it's a letter designed  
To have you married by the first of the year  
Get the Justice of the Peace  
Get the Justice get the Justice of the Peace  
Oh get the Justice of the Peace  
Get the Justice get the Justice of the Peace  
  
If you want to play with fire  
You'll get yourself burned  
I was messing with the ashes  
But look at how it turned out  
Get the Justice of the Peace  
Get the Justice get the Justice of the Peace  
  
Oh what a terrible waste such a shocking disgrace  
To give me away I'm too young to die  
A shotgun wedding heading straight for the sky  
And I'm shy Mary Ellen I'm shy why why why  
Get the Justice of the Peace  
Get the Justice I'll get the Justice of the Peace  
Come on!  
Get the Justice of the Peace  
Get the Justice I'll get the Justice of the Peace  
  
When your chips go down  
You came on the dice  
Forget the Mississippi  
Take some friendly advice  
  
Get the Justice of the Peace  
I'll get the justice I'll get the Justice of the Peace  
(Give it to me old chum)  
Get the Justice of the Peace  
Get the Justice I'll get the Justice of the Peace  
Get the Justice of the Peace  
Get the Justice I'll get the Justice of the Peace  
If you want to play with fire  
You'll get yourself burned  
And I was messing with the ashes  
And look at how it turned out  
  
I'll get the Justice get the Justice of the Peace  
I'll get the Justice I'll get the Justice of the Peace  
I'll get the Justice get the Justice of the Peace  
I'll get the Justice I'll get the Justice of the Peace
