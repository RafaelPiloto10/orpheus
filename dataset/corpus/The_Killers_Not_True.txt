Memories erased, not forgotten.  
Rewond and recorded over.  
Gone so no one will see, gone so I can never be.  
The same!  
  
Waters all over these pages.  
It's not true, there locked in cages.  
I see how but to blind to see why.  
Now it's gone.  
  
Summer won't stop chewing my blanket.  
Can you stop the pain from into the night?  
  
Waters all over these pages.  
It's not true, there locked in cages.  
I see how but to blind to see why.  
Now it's gone.  
  
The silence just hurts, the silence just hurts.  
Take it away, away, away.  
Can you stop the pain from into the night?  
  
Waters all over these pages.  
It's not true, there locked in cages.  
I see how but to blind to see why.  
Now it's gone.
