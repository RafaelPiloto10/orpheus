Farewell, farewell to you who would hear  
You lonely travelers all  
The cold north winds will blow again  
The winding road does call.  
  
And will you never return to see  
Your bruised and beaten sons  
Oh I would, I would if welcome I were  
For they loathe me every one.  
  
And will you never cut the cloth  
Nor drink the light to be  
And can you never swear a year  
To anyone but he.  
  
No I will never cut the cloth  
Nor drink the light to be  
But I'll swear a year to he who lies  
Asleep alongside of me.  
  
Farewell, farewell to you who would hear  
You lonely travelers all  
The cold north winds will blow again  
The winding road does call.
