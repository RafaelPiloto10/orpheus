Today I faced  
A world of compromise  
I had to fight to stand my ground  
One day I'll leave these struggles  
Far behind  
I will gladly lay them down  
  
[Chorus]  
When we get there  
His voice we'll hear  
Slowly each name He'll call  
When He calls to me  
I will fall to my knees  
And He'll see  
The last time I fall  
  
I only dream  
Of how it's going to be  
But I'll keep fighting until then  
When every loss  
And every victory  
Will be offered unto Him  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Truth has conquered every lie  
Love demands no alibis  
Life has loved us  
Loved enough to die  
  
[Chorus]
