Pity the fool  
It's hard, but he broke a rule  
And that isn't done  
Somehow, someday, brother will use a gun  
Just walking the town  
Just painting it sad  
It's bringing me down  
It's driving me mad  
Woman is away from me  
  
[Chorus]  
We will be strong, we will be strong  
I know we have the strength to carry on  
We have the strength  
I know my rights from wrong  
I know you've lost, I've won  
We will be stronger  
We will be strong  
And getting stronger every day  
Believe me when I say it  
There is no other way to convey it  
  
No other way, you clown  
Your thoughtfulness has brought us down  
And that isn't right  
That we should walk alone on the streets at night  
Just checking the time  
Walking that very fine line  
The humor is black  
The plan is attack  
Now woman is away from me  
But we will be strong  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Down on your luck  
The shock, it has struck  
The weak ones will die  
The questions are "Why? Why?"  
Does anybody hear?  
Does anybody understand?  
Let me make it clear  
Now's the time to take a stand  
Now woman is away from me  
But we will make it strong  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We will be strong  
We will,  
We will be strong  
We will be,  
We will be strong  
We will,  
We will be strong  
We,  
We will,  
We,  
We will be,  
We,  
We will,  
We will be strong  
We will be strong
