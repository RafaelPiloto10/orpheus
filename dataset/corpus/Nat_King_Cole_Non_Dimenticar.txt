Non dimenticar means  
Don't forget you are my darling  
Don't forget to be  
All you mean to me  
Non dimenticar, my love  
Is like a star, my darling  
Shining bright and clear  
Just because you're here  
  
Please do not forget  
That our lips have met  
And I've held you tight, dear  
Was it dreams ago  
My heart felt this glow?  
Or only just tonight, dear?  
  
Non dimenticar  
Although you travel far, my darling  
It's my heart you own,  
So I'll wait alone  
Non dimenticar  
  
Se ci separ, se ci allontan  
L'ala del destino  
Non ne ho colpa, no,  
E mi sentiro sempre a te vicino  
  
Non dimenticar  
Although you travel far, my darling  
It's my heart you own,  
So I'll wait alone  
Non dimenticar
