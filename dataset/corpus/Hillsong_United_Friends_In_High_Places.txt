Well I was in need and I needed a friend  
I was alone and I needed a hand  
I was going down  
But someone rescued me  
  
Chorus:  
My God cares too much to say  
His mercies are new everyday  
I get down to pray  
And then help is on its way  
  
I walk by faith and not by sight  
If things go wrong, it'll be alright  
'Cause someone greater  
Is watching over me  
[Chorus:]  
  
Now in faith, I believe  
I've got everything I need  
I walk by faith and not by what I see  
I've got friends in high places  
I've got someone I can call  
And I've got someone watching over me
