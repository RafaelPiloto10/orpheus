Lady, you need a lover  
Someone to take you and love you all the way  
I know you long for that feelin'  
For a man to be stealin' your heart away  
You need a hero for a day.  
  
You'll never be missin' the moments when we're kissin'  
I'll never steal your love away  
Just let me borrow one memory for tomorrow  
I'll be your hero for a day.  
  
Lady, you need a lover  
Someone to take you and love you all the way  
Let me be the hero  
A place where you can go  
Let me be your hero for a day  
Lady, I'll be your hero...
