Julie through the glass  
Lookin' up at me  
You've just got to be  
The sweetest thing I've ever seen.  
  
Julie through the glass  
Just born a day ago  
And who knows where you've been  
And where you're gonna go.  
  
We want you to love the world  
To know it well and play a part  
And we'll help you to learn to love yourself  
'Cause that's where loving really starts.  
  
Julie through the glass  
I'm looking forward to  
Doing things with you  
For many years to come.
