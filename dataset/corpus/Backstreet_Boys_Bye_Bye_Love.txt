Yeah, yeah, oh,  
Yeah, yeah,  
  
You should be right here laying next to me  
But baby you chose to love the hard way  
You could be right here getting the best of me  
But baby you decided he was your man  
  
And now that you're finding out  
He's playing little games, you calling me again  
You say you want me around  
But I'm not sure now if I wanna be down  
So  
  
I think I wanna stay single  
Maybe we're better apart  
See I don't want a girl  
That, only wanna come back  
'Cause, some other man broke her heart  
  
So bye bye love  
Bye love  
So bye bye love (Bye love)  
Bye love  
Yeah  
  
Crazy how the tables turn  
It wasn't long ago that you turned your back, no.  
Saying there's no way that we can work (We can work)  
And you were quick to move on to the next thing  
Yeah.  
  
And now that you're finding out  
He's playing little games, you calling me again  
You say you want me around  
But I'm not sure now if I wanna be down  
So  
  
I think I wanna stay single  
Maybe we're better apart  
See I don't want a girl  
That, only wanna come back  
'Cause, some other man broke her heart  
  
So bye bye love (Bye love)

I'm not the one you really wanted before  
Sorry, that I let you go (Let you go)  
This time I think it's best to do it alone!
