You have a cup of coffee and another cigarette  
You're waiting for your baby but she hasn't shown yet  
And if she doesn't make it, well you've got no regrets  
Because you can't win or lose if you ain't made no bets  
And then she comes in walkin' lookin' fine as you please  
You wanna stop and drop right down on your knees  
And say baby  
Whoa  
You say you never worry cause you don't need a home  
Don't need an address, don't need a phone  
And you don't have to worry 'bout bein' alone  
Cause you can make your music on a ten cent comb  
And then she comes in walkin' lookin' fine as you please  
You wanna stop and drop right down on you knees  
And say baby  
Whoa
