You ask me why  
Why I'm so different  
Why I'm not the same as everybody else  
Well something changed  
It just happened  
When I opened up my heart and let Him in  
Jesus came in he came into my life  
And I know I never felt so good.  
Causeeverythings changed Everything is different  
Everythings changed Everything is different  
Everythings changed Everything is different  
Everythings changed Everything is different  
Now  
You ask me how  
How I can be sure  
How I know it's not just something else for fun  
Cause he's so real  
So real in my life  
He picked me up and turned my universe around  
Everything, everything, everything in my lifes changed  
Everything, everything, everything in my lifes different
