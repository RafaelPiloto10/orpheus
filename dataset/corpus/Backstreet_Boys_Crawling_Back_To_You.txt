Everybody knows that I was such a fool to ever let go of you  
And baby I was wrong  
And yeah I know I said we'd be better off alone  
It was time that we moved on  
I know I broke your heart, I didn't mean to break your heart  
  
But baby here I am, banging on your front door  
My pride spilled on the floor  
My hands and knees are bruised and I'm crawling back to you  
I'm begging for a second chance  
Are you gonna let me in?  
I was running from the truth and now I'm crawling back to you.  
  
I know you aren't there and you can make me wait, but I'm not gonna wait  
It's the that least I could do, just to tell you face to face  
I was lying to myself, now I'm dying in this hell  
Girl I know you're mad  
I can't blame you for being mad  
  
But baby here I am, banging on your front door  
My pride spilled on the floor  
My hands and knees are bruised and now I'm crawling back to you  
I'm begging for a second chance  
Are you gonna let me in?  
I was running from the truth and now I'm crawling back to you  
  
If you could see these tears I'm crying  
Touch these hands that can't stop shaking  
Hear the heart that's barely beating, you would see a different man  
  
But baby here I am, banging on your front door  
My pride spilled on the floor  
My hands and knees are bruised and I'm crawling back to you  
I'm begging for a second chance  
Are you gonna let me in?  
I was running from the truth and now I'm crawling back to you
