Appliances have gone berserk  
I cannot keep up  
Treading on people's toes  
Snot-nosed little punk  
  
And I can't face the evening straight  
And you can't offer me escape  
Houses move and houses speak  
If you take me there you'll get relief  
Believe, believe, believe, believe  
  
And if I'm gonna talk  
I just wanna talk  
Please don't interrupt  
Just sit back and listen  
  
Cause I can't face the evening straight  
And you can't offer me escape  
Houses move and houses speak  
If you take me there you'll get relief  
Believe, believe, believe, believe  
  
It's too much  
Too bright  
Too powerful  
  
Too much  
Too bright  
Too powerful  
  
Too much  
Too bright  
Too powerful  
  
Too much
