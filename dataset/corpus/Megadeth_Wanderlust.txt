As sure as the sun rises in the east  
Another gunman will come seeking my defeat  
Will he be as fast as me, are his nerves quiet and still  
Will he fall like all the rest ending his days upon boothill  
I'm an outcast riding into town alone  
I got wanderlust branded deeper than the bone  
I'm an outcast riding into town alone  
I got a lust for wandering branded deeper than the bone  
As I ride into the sunset to take another town  
Thank you for the invite, but I just can't settle down  
The dust that coats my hat is from a dozen towns  
Dust from shooting down another dozen clowns  
I'm an outcast riding into town alone  
I got wanderlust branded deeper than the bone  
I'm an outcast riding into town alone  
I got a lust for wandering branded deeper than the bone  
A drum beats for me, it's louder every day  
The cadence tells me that soon I'll meet my judgment day  
Life's an endless showdown never knowing when they'll come  
I sleep with one eye open lying with my smoking gun  
The game I play has caused a lot of grief  
They were dying for fame, so I obliged them some relief  
I'm an outcast riding into town alone  
I got wanderlust branded deeper than the bone  
I'm an outcast with lightning in my hand  
I got wanderlust lost in no man's land  
I got a lust for wandering lost in no man's land  
I got wanderlust
