The child in me again, he plays the fool  
Cry for joy, amen  
For after all, it's only love  
And the way you stir your coffee  
Like an angel in the morning  
  
Still you dare to change your mind  
You'll be sorry when it's over  
When you've had your taste of freedom  
Don't come crying on my shoulder  
  
Save your tears, don't mean much  
Is the guilty party me? I don't think so  
And it, it's no bed of roses lying here  
Tossing and turning  
  
Still you dare to change your mind  
You'll be sorry when it's over  
When you've had your taste of freedom  
Don't come crying on my shoulder  
  
And these, these years of love and giving surely  
Must be something to you  
  
Still you dare to change your mind  
You'll be sorry when it's over  
When you've had your taste of freedom  
Don't come crying on my shoulder  
  
Dare to change your mind  
You'll be sorry when it's over  
When you've had your taste of freedom  
Don't come crying on my shoulder  
  
Dare to change your mind  
You'll be sorry when it's over  
When you've had your taste of freedom  
Don't come crying on my shoulder
