A thousand stars fill the summer sky,  
tonight, my love, the beach belongs to you and I.  
And here we are lying in the sand,  
I hear the sound of music when you touch my hand.  
  
Just like the waves crashing on the shore,  
the echo of our love will last forevermore.  
Tonight, my love, hold me tight, my love,  
as our hearts compose a summer symphony.  
  
The symphony of a summer night.  
The echo of our love will last forevermore.  
  
But when morning comes and you go away,  
I'll close my eyes and I'll still hear the music play.  
The symphony of a summer night  
will last until the end of time.  
The symphony of a summer night.
