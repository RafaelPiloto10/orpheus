tell me, tell me  
is life just a play ground  
think your the real deal honey  
and someone will always look out for you  
  
but wake up baby  
you're so totally deluded  
you'll end up old and lonely  
if you dont get a bullet in your head'  
  
(oooooowwwww, ooooooowwwww)  
(ooooowwwww, ooooooowwwww)  
  
good luck, good luck,  
good luck in your new bed  
enjoy your nightmares honey  
when your resting away  
  
good luck, good luck,  
good luck in your new bed  
enjoy your nightmares honey  
when your resting away  
  
you sold me, sold me  
you sold me down the river now  
i hope you feeling happy now  
now you always have a sneer in your smile  
  
but wake up baby  
your so totally deluded  
you'll end up old and lonely  
if you dont get a bullet in your head  
  
(oooooowwwww, ooooooowwwww)  
(ooooowwwww, ooooooowwwww)  
  
good luck, good luck,  
good luck in your new bed  
enjoy your nightmares honey  
when your resting away  
  
good luck, good luck,  
good luck in your new bed  
enjoy your nightmares honey  
when your resting away  
  
"and im glad, so glad that im done with you  
no more crying crying leaving me so black and blue  
you backed me up against the wall  
but i stand tall dont give a damn no more!  
  
no more lies  
no more lies  
without you  
  
good good luck  
in your new bed with your nightmares honey  
resting your way
