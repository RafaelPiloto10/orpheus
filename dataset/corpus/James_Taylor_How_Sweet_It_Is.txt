How sweet it is to be loved by you  
How sweet it is to be loved by you  
For I needed the shelter of someones arms  
Darlin', there you were  
When I needed someone to understand my ups and my downs  
Oh, baby, there you were  
With sweet love and devotion  
Deeply touching my emotion  
I just can't stop, just to thank you, baby  
I just want to stop, just to thank you, baby, yes I do  
How sweet it is to be loved by you  
How sweet it is to be loved by you  
Well I'm gonna close my eyes at night now  
Wondering where would I be without you in my life  
And everything I was into which was just a bore  
And everywhere I went I'd think I've been here before  
But you brighten up for me all of my days  
With a love so sweet in so many ways  
I want to stop just to thank you, baby  
I just want to stop just to thank you, baby, thank you baby  
How sweet it is to be loved by you  
How sweet it is to be loved by you  
You were better to me than I was to myself  
For me, there's you, baby, there ain't nobody else  
I gotta stop so I can thank you, baby  
I just want to stop like to thank you baby, yeah now  
How sweet it is to be loved by you  
How sweet it is to be loved by you  
Let's bring it on now  
Well I just gotta stop and thank you, baby get down  
And I think so strong, the feeling's so right  
Stop and thank you, baby, baby  
Love thing, love thing  
Love thing, love thing  
Gotta stop and thank you, baby  
I say well now, well now, well now  
Well now, well now, well now  
Well now, well now, well now  
Well now, well now, well now baby  
To be loved be you  
It's like a honey to the bee, baby  
Sugar to the sugarcane  
Jelly to the don't love  
It's like a walk to a lonely man  
Over and over  
To be loved, to be loved, to be truly, truly loved  
To be loved, to be loved, to be truly, truly loved  
To be loved, to be loved, to be truly, truly loved  
To be loved, to be loved, to be truly, truly loved  
To be loved, to be loved, to be truly, truly loved, yeah  
How sweet it is to be loved by you

And it feels just about right
