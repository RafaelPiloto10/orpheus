Look at us, ain't it funny  
Is it just beginner's luck, maybe...  
Ooh with just one touch  
Two different people  
From such different worlds apart  
Has touched each other's heart  
Like candle's in the dark  
So if it's time for us we gotta take it  
Take the chance, the chance to make it  
  
Now Let the love begin  
Let the light come shining in  
Who knows where the road will lead us now  
Look at what we've found  
Make this moment turn our hearts around  
It may never come again let it in  
Let the love begin  
  
Ooh here we are so close together  
I can feel the fire starts between us  
Ooh we've come this far  
Too far to stop it now  
If this is meant to be (it's meant to be)  
A chance for you and me (for you and me)  
We've found our destiny  
Now we're looking at a new forever  
Make this dream come true together  
  
Now let the love begin  
Let the light come shining in  
Who knows where the road will lead us now  
Look at what we've found  
Make this moment turn our hearts around  
It may never come again let it in  
Let the love begin 2x
