A buzzard took a monkey for a ride in the air,  
The monkey thought that everything  
Was on the square.  
The buzzard tried to throw the monkey  
Off his back,  
The monkey grabbed his neck and said,  
"Now listen, Jack..."  
  
Straighten up and fly right,  
Straighten up and fly right  
Straighten up and fly right  
Cool down, papa, don't you blow your top.  
Ain't no use in divin',  
What's the use in jivin'?  
Straighten up and fly right  
Cool down, papa, don't you blow your top.  
  
The buzzard told the monkey,  
You're chokin' me.  
Release your hold and I'll set you free.  
The monkey looked the buzzard right  
Dead in the eye and said,  
Your story's so touching, but it sounds  
Jes' like a lie.  
  
Straighten up and fly right  
Straighten up and stay right  
Straighten up and fly right  
Cool down, papa, don't you blow your top.  
  
Straighten up and fly right  
Straighten up and stay right  
Straighten up and fly right  
Cool down, papa, don't you blow - your - top.  
  
Fly right!
