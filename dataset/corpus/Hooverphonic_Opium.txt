Why  
I wonder why you sigh  
There's no reason  
There's no reason for you to cry  
Don't  
Don't believe your own lies  
There's no reason  
There's no reason for you to sigh  
  
Music  
Music is opium for free  
Try a little, try to consume me  
Music is Prozac for free  
Don't get stuck in greed  
  
Why  
Why don't you dare to speak?  
Silence  
Silence will tighten our leash  
Happy  
Happiness is not for lease  
Silence  
Silence will tighten our leash  
  
Music  
Music is opium for free  
Try a little, try to consume me  
Music is Prozac for free  
Don't get stuck in greed  
  
Music  
Silence  
Happy  
There's no reason  
  
Music  
Silence  
Happy  
There's no reason  
  
Don't
