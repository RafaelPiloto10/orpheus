Sometimes I wake up  
And drag my sorry ass out of bed  
Sometimes I don't  
And I just lay there instead  
I'm going down to the store today  
And hope my cold sores all go away  
Sometimes I just put on my socks  
  
[Chorus:]  
Well, I'm Ramblin' in my shoes  
I'm ramblin' in my shoes  
I'm a-ramblin' in my shoes  
'Cause I got a hole in my socks  
  
Sometimes I wet the bed  
And lie in my own filth  
Sometimes I don't  
I get up and go to the bathroom  
I'm going down to the store today  
And hope my cold sores all go away  
Sometimes I just go barefooted  
  
[Chorus 4x]
