Everyday I hear a different story,  
People saying that you're no good for me,  
"Saw your lover with another and she's making a fool of you"  
  
If you loved me baby you'd deny it,  
But you laugh and tell me I should try it,  
Tell me I'm a baby, and I don't understand  
  
But you know that I'll forgive you,  
Just this once, twice, forever,  
'Cause baby, you could drag me to hell and back,  
Just as long as we're together.  
And you do  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't want your freedom,  
I don't want to play around,  
I don't want nobody baby,  
Part time love just brings me down.  
I don't want your freedom,  
Girl, all I want right now is you.  
  
Like a prisoner who has his own key  
But I can't escape until you love me  
I just go from day to day knowing all about the other boys  
You take my hand and tell me I'm a fool to give you all that I do  
I bet you someday baby someone says the same to you  
But you know that I'll forgive you  
Just this once twice forever  
'cause baby, you could drag me to hell and back  
Just as long as we're together  
And you do  
  
[Chorus]
