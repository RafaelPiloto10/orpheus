Those rhinestones turned to diamonds and those diamonds soon got old  
I had everything that you could buy to have but not to hold  
But all that glitters is not gold and when love's lost it's shine  
I had million dollar memories down to my last dime  
Million dollar memories down to my last dime  
Honky tonks and whiskey Lord they'll do it every time  
The day she found another I almost lost my mind  
And my million dollar memories are down to my last dime  
(Play it pig)  
  
Those limousines and chauffeurs they soon fell by the way  
Like that mansion down in Dallas Lord I lost the other day  
Happiness is gone now there's nothing left but time  
And my million dollar memories are down to my last dime  
Million dollar memories  
Yes my million dollar memories are down to my last dime  
(Think about that honey)
