Super animation, turning on a nation  
And they're saying:  
"All moving parts stand still"  
Since he was elected  
Adrenaline injected  
Hear him saying:  
"All moving parts should kill"  
Just like the hero  
He's got them all on the run  
Yes, he's won, yeah, yeah  
Since he passed the motion  
They're building in the ocean  
And he's saying all men  
Should all be free  
What a combination, peace and radiation  
And he's saying free men  
Should fight for me  
Just like his mammal  
He seems to get his pleasure  
From pain and the rain  
Ain't that strange?  
Very strange, yeah!  
I like choking toys  
You've got to see me before  
You meet the boys  
Teacher's burnt the school  
He's had enough of sticking  
To the rules, alright  
People stop and see  
He's got to be more decadent than me  
Just to pass the time  
He gets his kicks from  
Licking off the wine  
Pretty silly ladies  
All Cynthia's and Sadie's  
Call him on and he  
Takes their numbers down  
Says he is a woman  
I should have seen it coming  
And she's saying  
She's married to a clown  
Just like a lady  
She'll keep guessing  
Through the night  
Not tonight, well, I might, oh, alright, yeah!
