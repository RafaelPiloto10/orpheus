Sticky hands and a crooked hook in his stride  
Walking wonderland, are you taking me for a ride?  
I know it's on again, I guess some friends are hard to eye  
I can't deny, I can't see why  
Smell blood in the water so attack, attack  
Didn't know how far things feel off track  
You wanna string me up, let me hang slash to slack  
Attack, attack, stab me in the back  
Bail out, go on, bail out  
He never was a friend of mine  
Try and try and never turn your back  
As they are right behind you  
Lying down as you fall  
And all the true friends stab you in the front  
And never take it back if you have what they want  
So all for none and none for all  
History and time are all we got  
Dissecting lies and rumors in the thick of the plot  
'Cause you're fucking up on purpose and that means a lot  
These ties that rot, come and take a shot  
You really need it bad so attack, attack  
And what's a bust is our trust is fading to black  
'Cause the heart inside your chest beats eroded and cracked  
Attack, attack, stab me in the back  
Bail out, go on, bail out  
He never was a friend of mine  
Try and try and never turn your back  
As they are right behind you  
Lying down as you fall  
And all the true friends stab you in the front  
And never take it back if you have what they want  
So all for none and none for all  
Bail out, go on, bail out  
You let me down  
Jumping off the third floor  
Trust is out the back door  
What are these friends for?  
What are these friends for?  
What are these friends for?  
Try and try and never turn your back  
As they are right behind you  
Lying down as you fall  
And all the true friends stab you in the front  
And never take it back if you have what they want  
So all for none and none for all  
So all for none and none for all
