Oh, sweetheart, put the bottle down  
You've got too much talent  
I see you through those bloodshot eyes  
There's a cure, you've found it  
Slow motion, sparks, you've caught that chill  
Now don't deny it, but boys will be boys, oh, yes, they will  
They don't wanna define it  
Just give up the game and get into me  
If you're looking for thrills then get cold feet  
  
Oh, no, I do not hook up, up, I go slow  
So if you want me, I don't come cheap  
Keep your hand in my hand, your heart on your sleeve  
Oh, no, I do not hook up, up, I fall deep  
'Cause the more that you try the harder I'll fight to say goodnight  
  
I can't cook, no, but I can clean  
Up the mess she left  
Lay your head down and feel the beat  
As I kiss your forehead  
This may not last but this is now  
So love the one you're with  
You wanna chase but you're chasin' your tail  
A quick fix won't ever get you well  
  
Oh, no, I do not hook up, up, I go slow  
So if you want me, I don't come cheap  
Keep your hand in my hand, your heart on your sleeve  
Oh, no, I do not hook up, up, I fall deep  
'Cause the more that you try the harder I'll fight to say  
  
'Cause I feel, the distance  
Between us, could be over  
With the snap of your finger, Oh, no!  
  
Oh, no, I do not hook up, up, I go slow  
So if you want me, I don't come cheap  
Keep your hand in my hand, your heart on your sleeve  
Oh, no, I do not hook up, up, I fall deep  
'Cause the more that you try the harder I'll fight  
To say, 'cause the more that you try the harder I'll fight, to say goodnight  
  
Oh, sweetheart, put the bottle down  
'Cause you don't wanna miss out
