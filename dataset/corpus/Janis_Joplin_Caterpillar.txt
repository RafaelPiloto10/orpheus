I'm a caterpillar  
I'm a caterpillar  
Crawling for your love  
Crawling for your love  
Crawling for your love,  
For your love.  
I'm a butterfly  
I'm a butterfly  
Flying for your love  
Flying for your love  
Flying for your love,  
For your love.  
Well, I'll be anything that you want me to be.  
Baby, I'd even would be climbing up your tree.  
I'm a pterodactyl  
I'm a pterodactyl  
Dying for your love  
Dying for your love  
Dying for your love  
For your love.  
I'm an abominable snowman  
I'm an abominable snowman  
Calling for your love  
Calling for your love  
Calling for your love  
For your love.  
Well now baby, I'll be anything that you want me to be,  
Baby, a big monkey, a little monkey, a chimpanzee.  
Oh now,  
I'm a caterpillar  
I'm a caterpillar  
Falling for your love  
Falling for your love  
Falling for your love  
For your love.  
Oh baby,  
Falling for your love  
Falling for your love  
Falling for your love  
For your love.  
Falling for your love  
Falling for your love  
Falling for your love  
For your love.
