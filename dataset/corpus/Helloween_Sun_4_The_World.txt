Forty million years ago  
There was a boy called Leif  
His skin was grey, his eyes were red  
The tentacles counted five  
  
Grown up in a normal house  
His parents beloved son  
There never was the slightest sign  
He'd be the chosen one  
  
Leif (No!)  
Help us (No!)  
Shelter us  
  
He turns into the Sun for the world  
Sun for the world  
What would I say (what would I say)  
Would it be me, my friend  
  
Down on earth we see a star  
Dying in it's light  
Then suddenly it all explodes  
A new sun shines with Leif  
  
Leif (No!)  
Help us (No!)  
Shelter us  
  
He turns into the Sun for the world  
Sun for the world  
What would I say (what would I say)  
Would it be me  
  
Sun for the world  
Sun for the world  
What would you do (what would you do)  
Would it be you, my friend  
  
Leif  
Help us  
Shelter us  
  
He turns into the Sun for the world  
Sun for the world  
What would I say (what would I say)  
Would it be me  
  
Sun for the world  
Sun for the world  
What would you do (what would you do)  
Would it be you, my friend
