Look around  
Where do you belong  
Don't be afraid  
You're not the only one  
  
Don't let the day go by  
Don't let it end  
Don't let a day go by, in doubt  
The Answer Lies Within  
  
Life is short  
So learn from your mistakes  
And stand behind  
The choices that you make  
  
Face each day  
With both eyes open wide  
And try to give  
Don't keep it all inside  
  
Don't let the day go by  
Don't let it end  
Don't let a day go by, in doubt  
The Answer Lies Within  
  
You've got the future on your side  
You gonna be fine now  
I know whatever you decide  
You're gonna shine  
  
Don't let the day go by  
Don't let it end  
Don't let a day go by, in doubt  
You're ready to begin  
  
Don't let a day go by, in doubt  
The Answer Lies Within
