Yeah yeah yeah  
Julie was a long way from home  
She can make alone look pretty  
Her attitude made a part of her landscape  
Riding her bike through alphabet city  
  
She likes to party in the backseat, under the bridge on the Brooklyn side  
Smoking cigarettes in the afterglow, taking bets till the sun won't rise  
She said "what good is tomorrow without a guarantee?"  
She can lick her lips and smile and make you want to believe  
  
That the consequences of your actions really are just a game  
That your life is just a chain reaction, taking you day by day  
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world  
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl  
(Right now right now ooh ooh ooh)  
  
Julie likes to shop lift in stores  
Right alongside the rich and famous  
Get in elevators, press emergency stop  
And make love on the floor until the camera made us  
  
And no woman in the world ever made me feel like my heart's on fire  
When she walked, I followed, when she laughed, I cried,  
"What good is tomorrow without a guarantee?"  
And I was wrapped around her finger, and I began to believe  
  
That the consequences of your actions really are just a game  
That your life is just a chain reaction, taking you day by day  
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world  
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl  
  
That the consequences of your actions really are just a game  
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day  
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world (crazy world)  
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl  
  
Tell me what you want from me  
I've got everything you need  
It's getting hard for me to breathe  
Let me be your guarantee  
  
That the consequences of your actions really are just a game (a game)  
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day (by day)  
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world  
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl (poster girl)  
  
That the consequences of your actions really are just a game (just a game)  
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day  
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world (crazy world)  
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl  
  
Right now, right now  
Right now, oh oh oh  
Poster girl  
Poster girl  
Come on, come on
