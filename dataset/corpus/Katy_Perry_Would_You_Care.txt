Get used to it, Katy  
Everyone trashes you under the table  
As they're smiling at your face  
Cruel words like a stun gun  
Life can be hum drum  
Knock to the ground, oh  
  
But if you got them talking  
Staring and stalking  
You know it's working  
But you only get a minute or two  
  
'Cause nobody hates you  
Are you aware  
You're just one note in a symphony  
Nobody needs you  
Nobody's there  
Your name won't go down in history  
Live on in infamy  
But to the point  
Would you care  
Would you care, would you care  
  
Get used to it, Katy  
People's attention  
Sure is focused on you  
Your the subject of the day  
They need something to speak about  
No need to freak out  
Tomorrow is over  
Today you got them talking  
Staring and stalking  
You know it's working  
But you only get a minute or two  
  
'Cause nobody hates you  
Are you aware  
You're just one note in a symphony  
Nobody needs you  
Nobody's there  
Your name won't go down in history  
Live on in infamy  
But to the point  
Would you care  
  
Mean worlds, mean words, mean thoughts, meanwhile  
Don't let it get to you  
Girl, don't cry  
They lie  
Don't let it get to you  
Get used to it  
  
Nobody hates you  
Are you aware  
You're just a note in a symphony  
Nobody needs you  
Nobody's there  
Nobody, nobody, nobody  
  
'Cause nobody hates you  
Are you aware  
You're just a note in a symphony  
Nobody needs you  
Nobody's there  
Your name won't go down in history  
Live on in infamy  
But to the point  
Would you care  
But to the point  
Would you care  
Would you care, would you care
