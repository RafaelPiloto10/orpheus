I've spent close on sixteen years  
Watching your pretty flower grow  
Little girl, little girl, now tell me  
Everything you know  
About the oceans and the skies,  
The mountains and the trees,  
And then I'm tell you about  
The birds and the honey bees  
  
'cause I'm a love man, yeah, yeah, yeah,  
I'm a love man  
I'm a hootchie cootchie man  
And I'm doing all I can  
I just love to tease,  
I would do anything to please you, baby  
  
Sweet little angel, give me your hand,  
Feel for my heartbeat, baby,  
Then you'll understand  
About the bees and the honey,  
The bluebirds in the trees,  
And you'd know, just to get close to you  
I would get down on my knees  
  
I am a love man, yeah, yeah, yeah,  
I am a love man That's what I am  
I'm a hootchie cootchie man  
And I'm doing all I can  
I could love to squeeze,  
I would do anything to please you, baby  
  
Baby, I am a love man, yeah, yeah, yeah,  
I am a love man That's what I am  
I'm a hootchie cootchie man,  
Doing all I can  
I just love to tease,  
I would get down on my knees  
  
So come a little closer,  
Let me whisper in your ear  
How the good Lord in His wisdom  
Made you so, and put you here  
  
He played a little game  
Called The Apple and the Snake,  
When the lady took her first sweet bite  
The Snake made no mistake  
  
He was a love man, yeah, yeah, yeah,  
And I am a love man  
I'm a hootchie cootchie man  
And I'm doing all I can,  
'Cause a love man needs his loving everyday  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I am a love man
