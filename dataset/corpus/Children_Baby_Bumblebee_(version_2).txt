Oh, I'm bringing home a baby bumble bee  
Won't my mommy be so proud of me  
'Cause I'm bringing home a baby bumble bee --  
Buzzy, buzzy, buzzy --  
(spoken): OOOOH, it bit me!  
  
Oh, I'm bringing home a baby rattlesnake  
Won't my mommy shiver and shake  
'Cause I'm bringing home a baby rattlesnake --  
Rattle, rattle, rattle --  
(spoken): OOOOH, it bit me!  
  
Oh, I'm bringing home a baby turtle  
Won't my mommy really pop her girdle  
'Cause I'm bringing home a baby turtle  
Snappy, snappy, snappy --  
(spoken): OOOOH, it bit me!  
  
Oh, I'm bringing home a baby dinosaur  
Won't my mommy fall right through the floor  
'Cause I'm bringing home a baby dinosaur --  
Gobble, gobble, gobble --  
(spoken): OOOOH, it ate me!
