The snow makes teardrops on my window  
The wind blows memories through my hall  
And I am all alone on New Year's eve  
The time I need you most of all  
  
The gay ones don their silly paper hats  
And blow their stupid little horns  
At midnight they will all be singing Auld Lang Syne  
But the sad ones sit alone before the fire and sip a glass of lonely wine  
  
I wish you a Happy New Year darling  
May your new love be bright and fair  
I hope he'll do those special things for you  
That I would do if I were there.  
  
I love the days we spent together  
Before the old year lost it's shine  
I'll keep that memory locked within my heart  
That Happy New Year you were mine
