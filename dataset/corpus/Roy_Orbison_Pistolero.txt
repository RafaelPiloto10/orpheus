One of brothers five one day vowed to try to make his way,  
Joined the cattle drive to Mexico.threw in with some bandidos,  
Here he learned the lingo. killed the man they call him Pistolero.  
Five thousand pesos they put on your head.  
Five thousand pesos to get you alive or dead.  
Ride on ride hard in vaquero, fast as you can to her side.  
Ah, but por mucho dinero, el noveno por nada have died.

Everytime a candle burns, waiting there for your return.  
The candle is out Pistolero.I see the cabin down below.  
Pistolero let her go.tonight you're mine Pistolero.  
Five thousand pesos they put on your head.  
Five thousand pesos to get you alive or dead.  
Ah Pistolero Look around you.your son has set in the sky.  
Oh Pistolero I found you, kiss Maria tell Maria goodbye.  
Pistolero Pistolero, lay your head down.
