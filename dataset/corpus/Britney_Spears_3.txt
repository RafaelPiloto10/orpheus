One, two, three  
Not only you and me  
Got one eighty degrees  
And I'm caught in between  
Countin'  
One, two, three  
Peter, Paul and Mary  
Gettin' down with 3P  
Everybody loves me  
Oh  
  
Babe, pick a night  
To come out and play  
If it's alright  
What do you say?

Triple fun that way  
Twister on the floor
