I don't want to say goodbye  
I don't want to be alone  
I give you one more chance to say how much you want me back  
Oh, I'll give you one more chance to say that this time it will last until  
That death will do us part  
  
So we can find peace in our hearts  
Oh, I give you one more chance to say you're sorry  
And that you love me, cause  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't want to be alone  
I don't want to be apart again  
I don't want to say goodbye, again  
I don't want a broken heart  
I don't want to be hurt again  
I don't want to say goodbye,again  
  
I give you one more chance to prove that you're the one for me  
I give you one more chance but this time you will have to  
Work hard for a man with dignity  
You'll have to earn my trust you see  
I give you one more chance to say you're sorry  
And that you love me  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Do you understand  
All the pain you caused  
When you cheated on me  
Baby  
So swear to god  
And promise me  
That it will never ever  
Happen again  
Cause I still love you  
  
[Chorus: x2]
