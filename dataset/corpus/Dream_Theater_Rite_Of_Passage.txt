Since the new world order  
Plagued upon our fears  
Spreading accusations  
Of radical ideas  
  
The brotherhood of wisdom  
Strength and dignity  
Its rituals and secrets  
Remain a mystery  
  
Beneath the ever watchful eye  
The angels of the temple fly  
  
Turn the key walk through the gate  
The great ascent to reach a higher state  
A rite of passage  
  
The final stage a sacred home  
Unlock the door and lay the cornerstone  
A rite of passage  
  
Men of wealth and power  
Influence and fame  
Philosophers and leaders  
All members of the trade  
  
Bound by oath honor  
Like the rose and cross  
An enigmatic union  
An esoteric thought  
  
Beneath the ever watchful eye  
The angels of the temple fly  
  
Turn the key walk through the gate  
The great ascent to reach a higher state  
A rite of passage  
  
The final stage a sacred home  
Unlock the door and lay the cornerstone  
A rite of passage  
  
Turn the key walk through the gate  
The great ascent to reach a higher state  
A rite of passage  
  
The seven stars the rising sun  
A perfect world the new life has begun  
A rite of passage
