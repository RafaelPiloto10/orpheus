You know, tomorrow I'll be out of town  
Baby, before the sun goes down  
There's an agent and he's made a bet  
That I'll be sitting on a jumbo jet  
Baby, I'd like to stay here  
Baby, I'd like to play here  
But I made a deal  
And though it don't seem real  
Just another day  
I'll be three thousand miles away  
I got to pay my dues  
You know I sing the blues  
Got to do my thing  
All I do is sing rock and roll  
  
You know, tomorrow I'll be on my way  
Flying through an other day  
Places turn into a dream  
I can't remember where I've been  
Baby, I'd like to stop here  
Baby, I'd like to drop here  
But in a month or so  
Then I will have to go  
But it does no good  
Still it's in my blood  
I got to pay my dues  
You know I sing the blues  
Got to do my thing  
All I do is sing rock and roll  
  
Man must do what a man must do  
No time to sit and wait  
One day he's gonna realize  
That it is too late  
  
You know, tomorrow I'll be on my own  
Flying through an other zone  
Faces turn into a dream  
I can't remember who I've seen  
Baby, I'd like to lay here  
Baby, I'd like to stay here  
But there's an other show  
And I just have to go  
Still keep coming through  
Don't know how I'll do  
I got to pay my dues  
You know I sing the blues  
Got to do my thing  
All I do is sing rock and roll
