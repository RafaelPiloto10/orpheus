Do you think about the moon?  
Made you feel real special 'cause  
It followed you everywhere  
Do you think about the sun showers?  
The way you like to run naked in them and  
Shampoo your hair  
Do you think about why we sneeze in the sun?  
Wish my freckles would just leave us alone  
Do you think about when you're older  
Will they make a Sunday night movie  
About your life?  
You think you got tattoos  
Your grandkids are gonna like?  
  
[Chorus:]  
Well is your cup half empty?  
Is your cup half full?  
Whatcha gonna be  
When you grow up?  
Are you a gym teacher,  
Rock star, or superhero  
In a major motion picture  
Action feature, creature?  
Over and over figure it out  
Maybe today we'll find the message in the clouds  
Maybe tomorrow we'll crush a  
Nickel on a railroad track  
Time is running out, I think I think too much  
  
Do you think about the guy  
That you first kissed?  
Yeah his tongue went in circles  
Practically missed your lips  
Do you think he's now the world's greatest lover?  
Or sitting at home  
Watching CNN on TNT or TV?  
Do you think about your past life?  
Were you a countess, or  
A vagabond or James Bond or  
Yeah, but bisexual  
Do you think I should care what you think?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Do you think about all the books  
You haven't read?  
Are you a street smart cat  
Or are you just an intellect?  
Do you think about this now,  
The girl who made you miserable  
In junior high, made you cry?  
Do you thinks she's smoking  
Like five packs of cigarettes a day  
And going to therapy...  
Wait I wasn't finished  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Do you think it's normal  
For white people to wear dreadlocks?  
Are you a barefoot earthling  
Or a hermit in socks  
Guys in tuxedos are  
Kind of deceiving  
But you know, you see them in the park, jogging along  
It's a little more revealing  
  
Do you think about your funeral?  
If you died how many people  
Are gonna show up?  
Do you think we're capable of change  
Or we're just gonna, oh screw up our children?  
Do you think about fires,  
Who do you rescue first  
Your kids or your sleeping husband?
