And baby here got tha mean stark got me frownin  
And we bout it like them niggaz from orleans  
And puts it down like we court grime from green to green  
Make ya scrilify any means, fuckin up any sceams  
Or any plots that you got, you best had get rocks  
We gets knots, 40 ain't tha lots fuck a mule  
My lil nigga hit tha fuel, and traffic bitches bust you  
To get used by the cliq with tha bomb dick like tha fuse

In tha double tree up 40 flights.

We can see that you fuck wit too many stars  
We can tell em how u fuckin up that miny bar

Fly bitches ain't impressed by a lil gold  
But soakin wet off the power that a nigga hold  
All ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? that a nigga fold  
Bust a load, just as soon as we get u blowed  
Get ya purse and ya pager don't forget ya coat

I know this is a gang a bitches by tha silhouette  
Niggaz ran through a few and ain't finished yet  
'cause when it come to tha hoes and time to get it wet  
We only keep tha startin 5 like tha pinatech  
They hit us off wit tha tongue fo tha nut licks  
And follow through to duck6 and butt licks  
Nigga fuck tricks, they in tha back wit they legs up  
And I'm gon tell u how I want it whether head or guts  
Im spread nuts, set it up, I show you how to wet it up

Up to bat the 3rd time, nigga struck out  
Blamed it on tha bitch and told her "get the fuck out"  
  
(people say it's dirtyyy, people say it's wrong  
They look at out music like it's a nasty song, it's nasty!!)  
  
Nasty girl nasty girl in ya own lil nasty world (x2)  
  
(people say it's dirtyyy, people say it's wrong  
They look at out music like it's a nasty song, it's nasty!!)  
  
Nasty girl nasty girl in ya own lil nasty world (x4)
