I don't drink as much as I used to  
'Cause lately that just ain't my style.  
And the hard times don't hurt like they ought'a  
They pass quickly like when I was a child.  
  
And lately I've learnt how to listen  
To a sound like the sun going down  
In the magic that morning is bringing  
There's a song for the life I have found  
  
It keeps my feet on the ground  
  
Now the midsummer days ain't so heady  
They just drift like a breeze through my mind.  
And nothing appears in a hurry  
As if to make up for some old long-lost time  
  
And lately I've learnt how to listen  
To a sound like the sun going down  
In the magic that morning is bringing  
There's a song for the friends I have found  
  
They keep my feet on the ground  
They keep my feet on the ground  
They keep my feet on the ground
