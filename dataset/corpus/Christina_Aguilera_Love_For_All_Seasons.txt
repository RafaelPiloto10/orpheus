Hey there boy did ya happen to know  
Wherever you go I'll follow  
Ooh babe you're like a cool breeze  
On a summer day  
When you're near me  
I don't know what to do  
I feel like a fool  
Like a schoolgirl  
True blue girl  
Who wants to know  
Can you come out and play  
You make me feel the way  
A woman is supposed to feel  
Show you that my love's for real  
  
I'll be the rain in your summer  
The chill in your fall  
I'll be what ya want  
Anything at all  
I've got a love for all seasons  
A love for all time  
I'll be the fire in your winter  
The sun in your spring  
I'll do what you want  
Give ya everything  
I've got a love for all seasons  
A love for all time  
  
I'll be there for you  
Keeping you warm  
Through the storm  
I'll guide you  
Stand by you until the stars fall from the sky  
When you call me  
I never hesitate  
Making you wait for my love  
Never lie love  
It's something that I just can't deny  
I'll read your each and every feeling  
When you need me to  
So now I gotta let you know  
This love's for you  
  
You don't have to search no more  
Baby you don't have to dream  
Cause what I've got inside for you  
It's all that you'll ever need  
You don't have to search no more  
My heart is yours  
For real for sure  
You don't have to wonder why  
I'll never leave  
I'll never lie
