[Verse 1]  
Tall tale, such a damn shame  
Hindsight, I can see it all so plain  
Kamikaze fire come down  
Fire come down, fire-fire come down  
Left, right, nowhere to turn  
Collecting the ash from the bridges you burned  
Kamikaze fire come down  
Fire come down, fire-fire come down  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
(Ah) It's too late for apologies  
(Ah) Nothing you can offer me now  
(Ah) I'm looking at you on your knees  
(Ah) And I'm all listened out  
[Chorus]  
Call, call, call  
But I'm never gonna come  
Baby cry, cry, cry  
You ain't fooling anyone  
You know I know that you know I know  
That you're a liar, a liar  
You can crawl, crawl, crawl  
You can beg and you can plead  
Baby talk, talk, talk  
Keep on lying through your teeth  
You know I know that you know I know  
That you're a liar, a liar  
  
[Verse 2]  
I hear you all night, talk in your sleep  
Saying all kinda names but none of them me  
Keeping secrets under your sheets  
Under you sheets, under-under your sheets  
You can cry wolf  
But you know I ain't gonna be here tomorrow, oh no  
I ain't fucking with your dirty, dirty, dirty laundry  
Dirty laundry, dirty-dirty laundry  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
(Ah) It's too late for apologies  
(Ah) Nothing you can offer me now  
(Ah) I'm looking at you on your knees  
(Ah) And I'm all listened out  
  
[Chorus]  
Call, call, call  
But I'm never gonna come  
Baby cry, cry, cry  
You ain't fooling anyone  
You know I know that you know I know  
That you're a liar, a liar  
You can crawl, crawl, crawl  
You can beg and you can plead  
Baby talk, talk, talk  
Keep on lying through your teeth  
You know I know that you know I know  
That you're a liar, a liar  
  
[Bridge]  
So here we go  
Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo  
Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo  
So here we go  
Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo  
Here we go (You're a liar, liar)  
  
[Chorus]  
You can call, call, call  
But I'm never gonna come  
Baby cry, cry, cry  
You ain't fooling anyone  
You know I know that you know I know  
That you're a liar, a liar  
You can crawl, crawl, crawl  
You can beg and you can plead  
Baby talk, talk, talk  
Keep on lying through your teeth  
You know I know that you know I know  
That you're a liar, a liar  
  
[Outro]  
So here we go  
Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo  
Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo  
Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo  
You're a liar, a liar
