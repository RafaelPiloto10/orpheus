I wanna make you happy  
  
It's a hundred dollar cash  
Give your hundred percent  
You can do the math  
20 20 vision  
  
But you just don't see it  
  
[Nicki Minaj]  
Laze up guisseppi boot, I'm more good  
Keys in that thing, interior or wood  
Now ending hills is on the rearview  
But piece of mon is what I don't got  
You make a girl hit up the dope spot  
White line, is a thin line  
Prenup, been signed, so quit playing, pinch time  
  
[Mary J Blige]  
I wanna make you happy  
But you just don't see it  
I wanna be around babe  
Baby I'm so tired up comprehend  
We say all the wrong things til we make each other cry  
What are we doing? Will it ever get better?  
  
I gave you eveything that I've got  
Watch my feelings walk on by  
Every guess, simple try  
This is how I feel inside, feel inside  
  
[Nicki Minaj]  
Guess who used to say yes boo  
Now when you say baby is fake  
Test tube, jet white, we on to jet blue  
Skinny tight on that thing, we're the fresh blue  
Super star, you know I'm in the press room  
That's where I'm shitting on these bitches, restroom hahaha  
That's ca ca ca ca, Get the fuck up out my face  
Blow that rah rah rah rah  
You been wack, Might send some Brooklyn niggas, get ya kidnapped  
With ya bitch ass, Hit the dryer cause ya washed, splish splash  
  
[Mary J Blige]  
I never thought that I would have this feeling  
But you think for once, but you could truly mean it  
Wasting so much time at disagreeing  
See I'm to the part where I don't know what, I'll believe it  
  
Won't you make up your mind  
Boy decide (decide, decide)  
We can't go on like this, this ain't right  
I'm feeling really bad, feeling kinda low  
Think it's time to go  
  
I gave you eveything that I've got  
Watch my feelings walk on by  
Every guess, simple try  
This is how I feel inside, feel inside  
  
[Nicki Minaj]  
Yo, this is a Mary J Blige, Nicki Minaj  
Knock-out, collab
