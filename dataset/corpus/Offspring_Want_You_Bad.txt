If you could only read my mind  
You would know that things between us  
Ain't right  
I know you're arms are open wide  
But you're a little on the sraight side  
I can't lie  
  
Your one vice  
Is you're too nice  
Come around now can't you see  
  
I want you  
All tattooed  
I want you bad  
  
Complete me  
Mistreat me  
I want you to be bad  
  
If you could only read my mind  
You would know that I've been waiting  
So long  
For someone almost like you  
But with attitude, I'm waiting  
So come on  
  
Get out of clothes time  
Grow out those highlights  
Come around now can't you see  
  
I want you  
In a vinyl suit  
I want you bad  
  
Complicated  
X-rated  
I want you bad, bad, bad, bad, bad  
Bad  
  
Don't get me wrong  
I know you're only being good  
But that's what's wrong  
I guess I just misunderstood  
  
I want you  
All tattoed  
I want you bad  
  
Complicated  
X-rated  
I want you bad  
  
I mean it  
I need it  
I want you bad, bad, bad, bad, bad  
Bad  
Really really bad
