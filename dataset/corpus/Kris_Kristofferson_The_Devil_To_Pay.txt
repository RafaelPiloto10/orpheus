Go on girl take your chances see how long you can go on from man to man  
I can read the lines between your stolen glances  
And I know it's time to fold this loosin' hand  
Cause you're drawn to the flame by the thrill and the shame  
Of the cheatin' game they taught you how to play  
That's the price of the high life you're livin' and you still got the devil to
pay  
Join your friends while you got 'em cause you know you're gettin' older every
day  
You can't wait to let them take you to the bottom  
And I'm gettin' tired of standin' in your way  
But when you hit the ground don't come lookin' around  
For the pieces of the love you threw away  
That's just part of the high cost you're leavin' and you still got the devil
to pay  
Now you've been flyin' so high for so long and you lie to yourself now most of
all  
Baby all that you needed from me was the freedom to fall  
When the bright lights are gone you'll be standin' alone  
Forsaken in the naked light of day  
Then you'll know that it's all over but the dying and you still got the devil
to pay
