All the boys are wearing blue tonight.  
We'll thrive, we'll dive, how can we lose?  
All the strangers walk like you tonight.  
So tall, we fall for every move.  
  
We'll laugh and talk,  
Don't stop for breath,  
In these our private lives.  
We dance 'til dawn,  
As they beat the drums,  
For all our private lives.  
  
Close your eyes and use the melody,  
Who cares who stares under the light?  
See the shadow tailing me again,  
It shows, it glows, and it grabbed so bright.
