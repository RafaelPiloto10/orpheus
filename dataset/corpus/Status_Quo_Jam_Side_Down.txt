What's a boy to do, when fate is cruel?  
Keep on keepin' on try to bend the rules  
I'll do anything to find a way to your heart  
  
I got a rabbit's foot but luck don't come  
Got my fingers crossed and they go numb,  
I can hold my breath and wish for you  
I need a miracle to make it true  
  
Life is hard, I need a remedy  
For the way I feel  
My bread keeps landing jam side down  
Say you'll be there to spread love around  
  
I was sweet on you that's how I felt  
Got a butter heart, you made it melt  
Like a big eyed kid in a candy store  
I had a little sugar now I want some more  
  
Life is hard, I need a remedy  
For the way I feel  
My bread keeps landing jam side down  
Say you'll be there to spread love around  
  
My bread keeps landing jam side down  
Say you'll be there to spread love around  
  
You are my destiny you  
Bring out the best in me you  
You made me feel so lucky  
  
So lucky to have you  
And I need you  
Yeah I need you  
  
Life is hard, I need a remedy  
For the way I feel  
My bread keeps landing jam side down  
Say you'll be there to spread love around  
  
Life is hard, I need a remedy  
For the way I feel  
My bread keeps landing jam side down  
Say you'll be there to spread love around  
  
My bread keeps landing jam side down  
Say you'll be there to spread love around
