I'm the latest apparition  
Cutting slices in the night  
I come through without permission  
Moving in and out of human sight  
I'm the tapping on your shoulder  
I am the raving in the storm  
I'll take shelter in you rafters  
I'm the shiver when you're warm  
I'm the gold in california  
I am the well in mexico  
Like the vultures in the valley  
I will wait for you to go  
I'm the gypsy in you pocket  
I am the horseman in your dreams  
I'm the reason dogs are barking  
I am the hand that stops the scream  
I am the baby's cry that isn't  
I am the distant relative  
I'm the scratching in the ceiling  
I am advice you shouldn't give  
I'm the ghost of a travelling salesman  
My foot will be there in your door  
Though I can walk through walls and windows  
I will knock just like before  
I am the darkness in your daughter  
I am the spot beneath the skin  
I am the scarlet on the pavement  
I am the broken heart within  
I won't take a train to nowhere  
I will not touch just anyone  
Ask a stranger why I'm waiting  
In the chamber of a gun
