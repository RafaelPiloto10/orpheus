Beautiful flyaway  
Somewhere like Holy Days  
Wonder what brought me down to earth  
Haven't I always been here  
Let's have another nibble  
Later I think I'll disappear into the bishop's mall  
And take a look at what we offer  
DDT poisoning me changing my relativity  
What's it going to be  
  
Da da da da d-da  
Later I think I'll disappear into another room  
And take a look inside the till  
Lovely days, human ways, journeys that take us to the end  
Ah  
  
Haven't we always been here  
Sharing one love and one fear  
Some day you'll know that life is really, really all about you  
So come and look inside  
You'll be surprised to find  
Later I think I'll disappear into another womb  
And take a look inside the mens' room  
Haven't I given you everything that I could give  
Where do you live  
Ah  
  
You are the only censor.  
If you don't like what I say, you have a choice.  
You can turn me off  
  
You are the only censor  
If you don't like what I say, you have a choice.  
You can turn me off
