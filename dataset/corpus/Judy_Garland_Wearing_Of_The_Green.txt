Oh, paddy dear and did you hear  
The news that's going 'round  
The shamrock is forbid by law  
To grow on Irish ground  
  
Saint Patrick's name no more you'll hear  
His colors can't be seen  
They've gone and passed a law against  
The wearing of the green  
  
Sure I looked to neighbor Tandy  
And he took me by the hand  
And he said how's dear old Ireland  
And how does she stand?  
  
It's a most distressful country  
That ever you have seen  
They're hanging men and woman  
For the wearing of the green  
  
Repeat first two verses  
Men and women,  
For the wearing of the green.
