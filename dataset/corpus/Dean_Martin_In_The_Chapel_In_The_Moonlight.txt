How I'd love to hear the organ  
In the chapel in the moonlight  
While we're strolling down the aisle  
Where roses entwine  
  
How I'd love to hear you whisper  
In the chapel in the moonlight  
That the love light in your eyes  
Forever will shine  
  
'Til the roses turn to ashes  
'Til the organ turns to rust  
If you never come I'll still be there  
'Til the moonlight turns to dust  
  
How I'd love to hear the choir  
In the chapel in the moonlight  
As they sing "Oh Promise Me"  
Forever be mine
