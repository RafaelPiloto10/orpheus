Green fields where we used to wander  
Purple valleys , near my home  
We would play there , beneath the sky  
And then I kissed you , butterfly  
Young girl , you came restless  
And you left me here to cry  
My big teardrops, in red pastures  
For I loved you , butterfly  
Butterfly , yeah  
I dream about you , lonely without you , butterfly  
Butterfly , yeah  
Each night I'm sleeping, your face goes creeping, butterfly  
Green fields where we used to wander  
Purple valleys, near my home  
We would play there beneath the sky  
And I kissed you , butterfly  
Butterfly, yeah  
I dream bout you , lonely without you , butterfly  
Butterfly , yeah  
Each night I'm sleeping, your face goes creeping, butterfly
