I talked with a stranger, so sad and forlorn  
His garments were sackcloth, all tattered and torn  
He told me a story, of sorrow and woe  
His heart went to heaven, at the first fall of snow  
He spoke of his angel, a dear baby girl  
He loved ev'ry footstep, he loved ev'ry curl  
But she went to heaven, just one year ago  
The angels came for her, at the first fall of snow  
He still had the dolly that she used to love  
He held and caressed it and gazed up above  
He whispered, ?My baby, you're waiting, I know  
I'll bring you, your dolly at the first fall of snow?  
And there as I listened, my eyes filled with tears  
I knew she was part of his happier years  
His frail body trembled, he spoke soft and low  
I'll be with my baby at the first fall of snow  
I patted his shoulder, my feelings to hide  
He couldn't know I was crying inside  
He smiled as we parted, 'cause he didn't know  
That we lost our baby at the first fall of snow
