[Chris Brown]  
My bad, I'm sorry  
I'm double parked  
Yah that's my Bugatti  
And that's my Ferrari next to my Ducati  
Call my old school Big Bertha that I be got it  
Boy I get exotic  
My car need a pilot  
Get free drinks to party  
Your nigga need his wallet  
No limit to what I'm spending so you know she's about bout it  
And who in the hell is smoking in here cuz it's super cloudy  
Goons with me dressed like skaters  
Getting bruised kidneys  
Stretch you later  
Man my house so big  
To the escalator to the elevator  
Take the elevator to the private jet  
Then that jet niggas see you later

But them haters go down and we just get to watch.  
Amazing, I'm blazing. look over here, said that I'm amazing.  
Nobody's facing, what I'm facing. set a pace, so I can race without pacing.  
Lace my shoes off, start racing. you can taste it, without facting,  
I mean fasting, start blasting. call up warren hill do-op that thing  
Swagger jacking, is not what I do. jb is the man, yeah he's a true.  
He's a beast when he steps up in the booth. I just landed, I did too.  
Ima gentleman, yes ima gentleman, ima on my element, but I'm still elegant.
