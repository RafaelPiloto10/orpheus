Been wrong all along  
I've been wrong all along  
You never hit me more than lightenin'  
I can't understand it myself  
I guess I was wrong  
Now that you're gone  
I have to get it on with somebody else  
I've been wrong all along  
I've been wrong all along  
  
Like a death at the party's alright?  
It's hard to survive on a Saturday night  
I've been wrong all along  
I've been wrong all along  
  
So you're feelin' alright now  
I'm not feelin' too good  
You put me on ice  
You better think twice  
Takin' it out on a Saturday night  
I've been wrong all along  
I've been wrong all along  
  
Like a death at the party's alright?  
You ruin my fun on a Saturday night  
I've been wrong all along  
I've been wrong all along  
  
Heaven's fallin'  
I keep callin'  
You keep stallin'  
You're more than lucky if you get out alive  
  
I've been wrong all along  
I've been wrong all along  
Like a death at the party's alright?  
It's hard to survive on a Saturday night  
I've been wrong all along  
I've been wrong all along  
  
Well it's Saturday night  
It's hard to survive  
I'm gettin' it on with my baby tonight  
It's hard to tell  
It's all in your mind  
Seems to be all my life it's really gone to hell
