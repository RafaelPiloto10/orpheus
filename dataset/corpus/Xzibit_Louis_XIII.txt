Never has it been so brightExplain  
Gotta tail bitches, get outta my sight  
Bitch, you blocking my light  
I'm in Vegas front seat at the fight  
I'm a alcoholic so you know I'm getting it right  
Louis the 13th  
Hennessy black when I'm thirsty  
I like my liquor dark milk chocolate Hershey)  
But first we  
Gotta bang loose for the niggas that's been waiting on it  
Patiently debating, even hating on it, bitch  
I started this gangsta shit  
House shoes and the shotgun, check the pinks)  
The hangover is over, Tila created the lynx  
(So tell the whole world to suck my dick, real shit  
The addiction that you can't deny  
Twelve steps to recovery, or else you die)  
Yeah, this is for you and I  
Fly, pelican, fly  
Fuck trying to get by  
Or we can put that bullshit aside and kill 'em  
L-B Cool S  
Put a (?) out in Sweden out in (?)  
So what makes a motherfucker so damn fresh?  
We on the coast, yeah, you know to the left  
Louie the 13  
Back down original, pack-town originiator  
I'm full of 40's like the g-thang refrigerator  
Getting paper with my neighbor like that Clippers and the Lakers  
Drinking Jac' next to Jack, courtside at the Staples  
Affiliation is vital for survival, we rolling  
(?) pull it up with a million bucks  
(And I'm feeling like a million bucks  
A all-star nigga still in shucks  
Louis the 13th  
You can say what you say, just spell (?) right  
Still got a lot of Louie's leftover from last night  
We alcoholic minded, DJ rewind it  
Bitches in liquor, we only fuck with the finest  
King-T your higness  
I'm timeless, y'all niggas is spineless  
Drinking everything on the wine list  
So yeah, nigga, come and catch this fade  
Or break bread and we can all get paid  
Louis the 13th  
I got 14 courts, all sorts of imports  
Premium spirits, mixed with marked lyrics  
Don't fuck with Xzibit, I will crush your frame  
Say my name, I will hunt you down like Saddam Hussein  
I'm crown royal  
Coming out the Compton soil  
Niggas in the kingdom stay loyal  
It's the old English, linguist, distinguished genius  
Always got a cup in my hand  
Louis the 13th  
Lets have a conversation on my present situation  
I don't need to be a star, I got my own constellation  
Professional inebriation, we having a celebration  
A live nation and heavy rotation  
Patience  
Hold more information than a free mason  
It's a secret society, never try sobriety  
SS Bugatti, live with the Illuminati  
(?) picking up the bodies  
We crash the party  
(?) and Harley's mixed with Bacardi  
Man, fuck everybody
