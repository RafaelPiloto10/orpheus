It's not true  
  
You say I've been in prison  
You say I've got a wife  
You say I've had help doing  
Everything throughout my life  
  
[Chorus]  
It's not true, it's not true  
I'm telling you  
Cause I'm up here and you're nowhere  
It's not true, so there  
  
I haven't got eleven kids  
I weren't born in Baghdad  
I'm not half-Chinese either  
And I didn't kill my dad  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you hear more rumors  
You can just forget them too  
Fools start the rumors  
None of them are true  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You say I've been in prison  
You say I've got a wife  
You say I've had help doing  
Everything throughout my life  
  
I haven't got eleven kids  
I weren't born in Baghdad  
I'm not half-Chinese either  
And I didn't kill my dad  
  
[Chorus: x2]
