You say that you're misunderstood  
But you like it that way  
Then you say you're lonely  
Well that's the price you pay  
And I don't think I love you  
That's the cruelest game we play  
But I love you that way  
You're a perfect lover  
Why don't you stay?  
You're a perfect lover  
Ain't it always that way  
You feel a little twisted  
You feel a little pain  
You're a little hateful  
Don't worry, you'll feel that way again  
Cry, don't  
Cry don't cry for me  
You say that you're not beautiful  
But you are in my eyes  
You say my love's too heavy  
Well that comes as no surprise  
It's already over  
There's nothing to say  
It's already over  
But you need to love to show you your way
