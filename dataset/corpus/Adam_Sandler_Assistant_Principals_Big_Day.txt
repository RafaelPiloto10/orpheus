[Speaking through a microphone]  
"Good morning students and faculty, If I could have your attention please. As
you may, or may not know, Principal Cambell  
will not be here for the rest of the week due to a throat infection. Leaving
me, assistant principal Dunbar, as the school's lone  
administrator for the next few days."  
  
"Though the policies set forth by Principal Cambell will remain the same,
there will be some additional regulations you must also  
follow."  
  
"Number one - smoking outside the administration building will only be allowed
during lunch periods."  
  
"Number two - the girls' showering facilities will be moved from the locker
room into my inner office where I can watch the girls  
wash their breasts and buttocks while I play with myself."  
  
"Number three - while showering, none of the girls will be allowed to snicker
or laugh at the size of my genitalia. Eye contact  
with me is also prohibited."  
  
"Number four - girls are encouraged to wash each other freely as I build
towards orgasm."  
  
"Number five - while i am ejaculating, the boys gymnastic team must undress
each other spread eagle in front of me and satify  
each other orally until I have completed ejaculating."  
  
"Finally, rule number six - any student caught writing graffiti or defacing
school property will be automatically suspended, unless  
they are masturbating."  
  
"If you have any questions about these new regulations, I will be in my office
spanking it with a thumb up my ass."  
  
"Good day"
