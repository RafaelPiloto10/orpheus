When by the phone  
In vain you sit  
You very soon in your mind realize that it's not just  
An ordinary pain in your heart  
  
When you by chance  
Go knock on her door  
Walkin' away you're convinced that it's much more  
Than just an ordinary pain in your heart  
It's more than just  
An ordinary pain in your heart  
  
Don't fool yourself  
But tell no one else  
That it's more than just  
An ordinary pain  
In your heart  
  
When you catch up  
But she says goodbye  
Hold back your tears and before you start to cry  
Say you feel unnecessary pain in your heart  
  
Tell her you're glad  
It's over in fact  
Can she take with her the pain she brought you back  
Takin that ordinary pain from your heart  
It's more than just  
An ordinary pain from your heart  
  
Don't fool yourself  
But tell no one else  
That it's more than just  
An ordinary pain  
In your heart  
In your heart  
In your heart  
  
You're just a masachistic fool  
Because you knew my love was cruel  
You never listened when they said  
Don't let that girl go to your head  
But like a play boy you said no  
Ordinary pain  
This little girl mind you will blow  
Ordinary pain  
But then I blew you out the box  
Ordinary pain  
When I put my stuff on key and lock  
Ordinary pain  
It makes me feel kind of sick  
Ordinary pain  
To know love put you in a trick  
Ordinary pain  
I knew our love would have to end  
Ordinary pain  
The day I made it with your friend  
Ordinary pain  
Giving your love to one unreal  
Ordinary pain  
Like a big fool I know you feel  
Ordinary pain  
But in this lovie-dovie game  
Ordinary pain  
With all its joy there must be pain  
Ordinary pain  
But now the time has surely come  
Ordinary pain  
This game don't seem like so much fun  
Ordinary pain  
You're cryin big corcodile tears  
Ordinary pain  
Don't match the ones I've cried for years  
Ordinary pain  
When I was home wainting for you  
Ordinary pain  
You were out somewhere doing the do  
Ordinary pain  
You know I'd really like to stay  
Ordinary pain  
But like you did I've go to play  
Ordinary pain  
You're dumb to think I'd let you be  
Ordinary pain  
Scott free without some pain from me  
Ordinary pain  
I heard your song and took a chance  
Ordinary pain  
But to your music I can't dance  
Ordinary pain  
Go tell your story 'sob-sad'  
Ordinary pain  
About you blowin what you had  
Ordinary pain  
Since one ain't good enough for you  
Ordinary pain  
Then do yourself see how you do  
Ordinary pain  
  
Ordinary pain
