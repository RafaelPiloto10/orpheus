Well he lit you up  
Like amber waves in his movie show  
He fixed you up real good  
Till I don't know you anymore  
From ballet class to a lap dance  
Straight to video  
And the pool side news  
Was that he would be  
Launching you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Into every young man's  
Bedroom - you gave it up  
On Dvd and magazine  
You gave it up  
A private right of passage  
You gave it up  
To every boy's sweet dream  
With their paper cuts  
  
You said "he's got a  
Healing machine  
It glows in the dark  
Glows in the dark:  
You say "there's not a lot  
Of me  
Left anymore  
Just leave it alone.  
But if you're buy, and you have  
The time, tell the Northern  
Lights to keep shining - Lately it seems like they're drowning"  
  
He cold light you up  
And summon every swan  
Or the Lakesie  
Off to Cabo San Lucas  
For some optical stimulus  
Then you started to guess  
There was someone else  
Though his flint glass  
Seeing all of you  
Immersed in his sepia  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So I went by  
Cause I had the time,  
And told the Northern Lights  
To keep shining  
They told me to tell you  
They're waving
