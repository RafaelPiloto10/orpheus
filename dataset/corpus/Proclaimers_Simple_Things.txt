You and I, we are simple things.  
Oh, simple things we are.  
Feel the sun and all the joy it brings  
To the simple things we are.  
Water rushing from a spring  
Is the simple thing we are.  
  
But any hour of any day there is wonder  
In all our striving and our courage and our thunder.  
  
You and I, we are simple things.  
Oh, simple things we are.  
  
At any hour of any day there is wonder  
In all our skiving and our cowardice and our lying and our blunders.  
  
You and I, we are simple things.  
Oh, simple things we are.  
  
Simple things we are.
