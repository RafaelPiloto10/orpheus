A pistol shot at five o'clock  
The bells of heaven ring  
Tell me what you done it for  
No I won't tell you a thing  
Yesterday I begged you  
Before I hit the ground  
All I leave behind me  
Is only what I found  
If you can abide it  
Let the hurdy gurdy play  
Stranger ones have come by here  
Before they flew away  
I will not condemn you  
Nor yet would I deny  
I would ask the same of you  
But failing, will not die  
Take up your china doll  
It's only fractured  
And a little nervous from the fall  
La la la la la la la
