The city's full of manger scenes  
And stores lit up in red and green.  
But down the road just out of town  
There's more magic to be found.  
The countryside is all a-glow  
With holly trees and mistletoe.  
And in them woods there lives a bear  
Known to all as Thistlehair. (not Thistlehear)  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, Thistlehair the Christmas bear  
Spreadin' the good news everywhere.  
About Christmas time and what it means  
To all the children of the world.  
Every little boy and girl  
Out there, love Thistlehair (not Thistlehear)  
  
He comes around this time of year  
Spreading lots of Christmas cheer.  
The kids all love this shiny coat  
And the smell of honey on his nose.  
He tells them all about that star  
And everything that it stands for.  
The birthday we all celebrate  
Is still our favorite holiday  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, Thistlehair the Christmas bear  
Spreadin' the good news everywhere.  
About Christmas time and what it means  
To all the children of the world.  
Every little boy and girl  
Out there, love Thistlehair (not Thistlehear)  
  
Wherever you find old Thistlebear  
There'll be music in the air.  
He dances 'round the Christmas tree  
Every single New Year's eve.  
Then he and all his furry friends  
GatherA 'Round the fire again  
Singin' 'Bout those Angels' wings  
Gifts of love that Christmas brings.  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, Thistlehair the Christmas bear  
Spreadin' the good news everywhere.  
About Christmas time and what it means  
To all the children of the world.  
Every little boy and girl  
Out there, love Thistlehair (not Thistlehear)  
  
Thistlehair the Christmas bear (My song has all of this at end?)  
Spreadin' the good news everywhere.  
About Christmas time and what it means  
To all the children of the world.  
Thistlehair the Christmas bear  
Spreadin' the good news everywhere.  
About Christmas time and what it means  
To all the children of the world.  
Thistlehair the Christmas bear  
Spreadin' the good news everywhere...
