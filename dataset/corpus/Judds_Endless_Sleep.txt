The night was dark, rain fallin' down.  
Look for my baby, he's nowhere around.  
I traced his footsteps down to the shore,  
Afraid he's gone forever more.  
  
[Chorus]  
I looked at the sea, and it seemed to say,  
"I took your baby from you, away."  
I heard a voice, cryin' in the deep,  
"Come join your baby in my endless sleep."  
  
Why did we quarrel? Why did we fight?  
Why did I leave him alone tonight?  
That's why his footsteps ran to the sea.  
That's why my baby is gone from me.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ran in the water, heart full of fear.  
There, in the breakers, I saw him near.  
Reached for my baby, held him to me,  
Stole him away from the endless sleep.  
  
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say,  
"You took your baby from me, away."  
My heart cried out, "He's mine to keep!"  
I saved my baby from that endless sleep.  
I saved my baby from that endless sleep.  
I saved my baby from that endless sleep.
