Nothing is real in cardboard California  
Just waking up brings you down  
One lousy deal is cardboard California  
You just can't survive in a make believe town  
  
Lost in a city of little tin gods  
Cold plastic people with phony facades  
How can you win when you look at the odds  
  
You're running down a one way street  
Nobody cares if you survive  
Sometimes you beg or you don't eat  
You gotta fight to stay alive  
Hey, you're never gonna get away  
  
Where 's the world you used to know  
Where did all the good times go  
Look around your hopes and dreams are gone  
But like a fool you still keep hanging on  
  
Come and be a movie star  
Come and drive a fancy car  
Come and see, what you really are  
  
Look in the mirror, mirrors don't lie  
You're getting older, your time's past you by  
You lost your shot to some younger guy  
  
You're running down a one way street  
Nobody cares if you survive  
Sometimes you beg or you don't eat  
You gotta fight to stay alive  
Hey, you're never gonna get away  
  
Nothing is real in cardboard California  
Just waking up brings you down  
One lousy deal is cardboard California  
You just can't survive in a make believe town
