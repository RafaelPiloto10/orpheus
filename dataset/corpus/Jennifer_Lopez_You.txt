You are the one who makes me happy  
When everything else turns to grey  
Yours is the voice that wakes me mornings  
And sends me out into the day  
You are the crowd that sits quiet  
Listening to me  
To all the mad sense I make  
You are one of the few things worth remembering  
And if it's all true  
How can anyone mean more to me  
Than you  
Sorry if sometimes I look past you  
There's no one beyond your eyes  
Inside my head the wheels are turning  
Hey, sometimes I'm not so wise  
You are heart (you are my heart, you're my, my inspiration)  
Just like the old love song goes (just like a love song)  
You are one of the few things worth remembering  
And if it's all true  
How can anyone mean more to me  
Than you  
(You are my heart, you're my, my inspiration)  
Just like the old love song goes (just like a love song)  
You are one of the few things worth remembering  
And if it's all true  
How can anyone mean more to me  
Than you  
(You're the one) you  
(You're the one, you're the one, ooh..., you're the one for me)
