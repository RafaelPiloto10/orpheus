Front rooms  
Back rooms  
Slide into tables  
Crowd into bathrooms  
Joke around  
Cheap talk  
Deep talk  
Talk, talk, talk around the clock  
Crawl home  
Lie down  
Teeth chatter  
Heart pounds  
I don't feel so good  
I don't feel so good  
Push a button to escape  
Preacher on the tube crying "Lord!"  
There's evil in this land  
  
"Rock and roll music!"  
"Cast down these dope-fiends  
And there noisy bands!"  
"Damn their souls!"  
  
Preacher preaching love like vengeance  
Preaching love like hate  
Calling for large donations  
Promising estates  
Rolling lawns and angel bands  
Behind the pearly gates  
You know, he will have his in this life  
But yours will have to wait  
He's immaculately tax free  
  
"Multiple hundreds of thousands of"  
Tax free  
"Hundreds and millions of dollars"  
Tax free  
"A hundred billion dollars!  
And who is paying the price?  
Who, who  
"Your children are"  
  
Pissed off  
Jacked up  
Scream into the mike  
Spit into the loving cup  
Strut like a rooster  
March like a man  
God's hired hands and the devil bands  
Packing the same grandstands  
Different clothes  
"Pot in their pockets!"  
Different hair  
"Sexually active"  
Raise a screaming guitar or a bible in the air  
Theater of anguish  
Theater of glory  
God's hired hands and the devil bands  
Oh come let us adore me!  
Lord, there's danger in this land  
You get witch-hunts and wars  
When church and state hold hands  
  
Fuck it!  
Tonight I'm going dancing  
With the drag queens and the punks  
Big beat deliver me  
From this sanctimonious skunk  
We're no flaming angels  
And he's not heaven sent  
How can he speak for the Prince of Peace  
When he's hawk-right militant  
And he's immaculately tax free  
  
"Our nation has lost its guts!"  
Save me  
"Our nation has lost its strength"  
Tax free  
"Our nation has whimpered and cried"  
Save me  
"And petted the Castros"  
Tax free  
"The Khomeinis' and the Kaddafis'"  
Save me  
"For so long"  
Tax free  
"That we don't know how to act like a man"  
Save me  
"I think that we should turn the United States Marines  
loose on that little island south of Florida and  
stop that problem!"  
"I am preachin' love, I am!"
