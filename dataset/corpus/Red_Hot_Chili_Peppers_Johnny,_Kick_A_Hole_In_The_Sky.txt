I cry, I cry  
I was born in a land, I don't think you understand  
God damn what I am  
I'm a native of this place, please don't kick me in my face  
My race has been disgraced  
  
Won't somebody testify, kick a hole right in the sky  
Testify testify kick a hole right in the sky  
Slap a liar in his eye, kick a hole right in the sky  
Testify testify kick a hole right in the sky Johnny,  
Johnny, Johnny  
Puts us in a pumpkin shell where you keep us very well  
It's hell, where I dwell  
When history books are full of shit, I become the anarchist  
I'm pissed at this  
What this country claims to be  
It's a lie  
No place for me  
I bleed  
Kill my trust if you must  
But in my blood there is lust  
For life  
That's right  
Apache blood is in my heart thrashing though me like a shark  
Crashing though the dark  
What am I supposed to do  
I feel like I'm cut into confused  
By rules  
Do these cultures clash or am I living in the past  
I ask please tell me fast  
To what do I belong and if I change will I be wrong  
I took my foot kicked a hole in the sky  
I proceeded to plead fathers help me decide  
A jagged flash of light struck me in the eye  
I turned around and found that I was still alive  
Snakes rise high from the purple black sky  
The red cloud rains and the black horse rides  
Then it dawned on my like the mornin' sun  
I'm a part of two worlds and the mornin' comes  
Glowing embers tend to remember when  
The power that is peace was treated as a friend  
I am a master of and I've got to take action  
I'm a man, the animal man
