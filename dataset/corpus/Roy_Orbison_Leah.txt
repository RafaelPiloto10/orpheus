Le-Leah, Leah! Le-Leah, Leah!  
Here I go,  
From the hut to the boat, to the sea  
For Leah.  
  
Ah-hah, I gotta go diving in the bay,  
Gotta get a lot of oysters, find some pearls today,  
To make a pretty necklace for Leah,  
Le-e-ah.  
  
I've gotta go deep and find the ones just right,  
I'll bet my Leah'll be surprised tonight.  
I'll place the pearls around the only girl for me,  
Le-e-ah.  
  
But something's wrong, I cannot move around,  
My leg is caught, it's pulling me down,  
But I'll keep my hand shut tight, for if they find me,  
They'll find the pearl for Leah.  
  
And now it's over, I'm awake at last,  
Old heartaches and memories from the past.  
It was just another dream about my lost love,  
'Bout Le-e-ah.  
  
Le-Leah, Leah! Le-Leah, Leah!  
Here I go,  
Back to sleep, and in my dreams, I'll dream  
With Leah, Leah, Le-ah!
