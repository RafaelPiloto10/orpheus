It's knowing that your door is always open and your path is free to walk  
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag rolled up and stashed behind your
couch  
And it's knowing I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds  
And the ink stains that have dried up on some line  
That keeps you in the back roads by the rivers of my memory  
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind  
  
It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy planted on their columns now that binds
me  
Or something that somebody said because they thought we fit together walking  
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing or forgiving when I walk
along some railroad track by the rivers of my memory  
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind  
  
Well I dip my cup of soup back from the gurgling crackling caldron in some
train yard  
My beard a roughening coal pile and a dirty hat pulled low across my face  
  
Cupped hands 'round a tin can  
I pretend I hold you to my breast and find that you're waving from the back
roads by the river of my memory  
Ever smiling ever gentle on my mind
