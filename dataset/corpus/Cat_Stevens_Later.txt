Later,  
I want to talk it out with you  
Try to get my message through  
That's not all i want to do  
Later  
  
Later,  
I want to feel your body close  
From your head down to your toes  
Maybe help you fold your clothes  
Later  
  
I want to spread the news, don't want to soft soap you  
We're meant to live and love together girl . . . oh babe  
There's nothing i can do, oh darling  
I love you  
There's no way you can stay home, alone, babe  
Later  
  
I want to talk it out with you  
Try to get my message through  
That's not all i want to do  
Later  
Later...
