I never saw you before  
I never sound strained before  
Now I'm at your door  
And I hope you're unusual  
Very unusual  
  
Now I'm at your door  
And when you nicely ask me in  
I'm staring at your shoes  
And I don't wonder why  
I feel like a horse  
We can stray out on the open range  
Missing me every day with its hidden claws  
Spring snow  
  
And when you brush me  
Brush me with your eyes  
I think you've noticed that  
I don't want to be a bad guy anymore  
I never saw you before  
But you're unusual  
And now I'm at your door  
  
I feel safe and warm  
I feel  
I feel  
I feel  
I feel  
Like a horse  
Ha ha ha ha  
What's this?
