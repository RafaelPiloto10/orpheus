Things were all good yesterday  
And then the devil took your memory  
And if you fell to your death today  
I hope that heaven is your resting place  
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain  
But then that could have been the medicine  
And now you're lying in the bed again  
Either way I'll cry with the rest of them  
  
And my father told me, son  
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face  
And you're not the only one  
Although my grandma used to say, he used to sing  
  
Darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night  
And we'll lie inside, a little while here, oh  
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up  
And we're wrapped in light, in life, in love  
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut  
For they're designed to be together oh  
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one  
And we're set alight, we're afire love, love, love oh  
  
And things were all good yesterday  
Then the devil took your breath away  
And now we're left here in the pain  
Black suit, black tie standin' in the rain  
And now my family is one again  
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend  
Came to my mind I should paint it with a pen  
Six years old I remember when  
  
And my father told me, son  
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face  
And you're not the only one  
Although my grandma used to say, he used to sing  
  
Darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night  
And we'll lie inside, a little while here, oh  
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up  
And we're wrapped in light, in life, in love  
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut  
For they're designed to be together oh  
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one  
And we're set alight, we're afire love, love, love oh  
  
And my father and all of my family  
Rise from the seats to sing hallelujah  
And my mother and all of my family  
Rise from the seats to sing halellujah  
And my brother and all of my family  
Rise from the seats to sing hallelujah  
(And all of my brothers and my sisters, yeah)  
And my father and all of my family  
Rise from the seats to sing hallelujah  
Hallelujah
