Well, you've always been too slow  
And you've always been too late  
You should have known oh so long ago  
That your life is at stake  
  
'Cause you never could keep up  
And you never read the signs  
Now you are turning dust to dust  
You are running out of time  
  
Cracking the whip  
It's a new kind of pain  
Cracking the whip  
Don't try in vain  
  
You were always in despair  
Seems like you were born to lose  
Now you're dying, no one cares  
Cannon on the loose  
  
Looks like you missed the boat  
And you didn't catch that train  
Now you're crying and trying, in vain  
Can't take the pain  
  
Cracking the whip  
It's a new kind of pain  
Cracking the whip  
Don't try in vain  
  
Cracking the whip  
It's a new kind of pain  
Cracking the whip  
Don't try in vain  
  
Cracking the whip  
Cracking the whip  
Cracking the whip  
It's a new kind of pain  
Cracking the whip  
Don't try in vain
