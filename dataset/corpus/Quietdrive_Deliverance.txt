Make believe  
If you're sick of everything  
All the time before us  
Doesn't taint my memory  
  
When the walls they put around us  
Can't stop what we believe  
When the love we share forgets us  
This dream will set us free  
  
(So please don't tell me)  
Deliver me, deliver me  
(So please don't tell me)  
If it's up to me, if it's up to me  
I've had it once and now I want it again  
(I've had it once and now I want it again)  
I've had it once and now I want it again  
(I've had it once and now I want it again)  
  
When the walls they put around us  
Can't stop what we believe  
When the love we share forgets us  
This dream will set us free  
  
(So please don't tell me)  
Deliver me, deliver me  
(So please don't tell me)  
If it's up to me, if it's up to me  
I've had it once and now I want it again  
(I've had it once and now I want it again)  
I've had it once and now I want it again  
(I've had it once and now I want it again)  
  
When the walls they put around us  
Can't stop what we believe  
When the love we share forgets us  
This dream will set us free  
  
(So please don't tell me)  
Deliver me, deliver me  
(So please don't tell me)  
If it's up to me, if it's up to me  
I've had it once and now I want it again  
(I've had it once and now I want it again)  
I've had it once and now I want it again  
(I've had it once and now I want it again)
