Today there's no salvation band's packed up and gone  
I'm left standing with my penny in my hand  
Down at railroad station a blind man sings his song  
I think he sees things I don't understand  
It's the 33rd of August and I'm finally touching down  
Eight days from Sunday finds me Saturday bound  
I stumbled through the darkness tumble to my knees  
A thousand voices screaming in my brain  
Wound up in a squad car busted down for vacancy  
Outside my cell it's sure as hell looks just like rain  
It's the 33rd of August...  
I've put my dangerous feelings under lock and chain  
Killed my violent nature with a smile  
Let the demons danced and sang their songs within my fevered brain  
Not all my God like thoughts were defiled  
It's the 33rd of August...
