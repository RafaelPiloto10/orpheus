Well, I could search from now to the end of the time  
Never find another you  
I'm so glad because I know you're mine  
  
Someone to give my love to  
Well, I believe, my love, that you're one of the kind  
For there's no one else like you  
You're the light of my life, so let it shine  
  
Someone to give my love to  
Well, I find happiness is lovin' you  
And I'll do my best to make your dreams come true  
Now I will follow you to the end of the earth  
For my place will be with you  
Well, I have taken you for better or worse  
  
Someone to give my love to  
Well, I find happiness is lovin' you  
And I'll do my best to make your dreams come true  
Days of man-and-wife-time are precious few  
I will spend them all with you  
Then beyond forever I'll wait for you  
  
Someone to give my love to  
Mm, mm, mm, mm  
Well, you're the light of my life, so let it shine  
Shine on me my whole life through  
Well, you're the light of my life, so let it shine  
I need someone like you
