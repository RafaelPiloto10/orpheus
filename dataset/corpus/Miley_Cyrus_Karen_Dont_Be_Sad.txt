[Verse 1]  
Oh, Karen  
You take it all too hard  
You been talking to those fools again  
And they'll tear your world apart  
Oh, Karen  
You gotta try to understand  
Gotta hold on to your soul  
Cause they'll crush it if they can  
  
[Chorus]  
So, Karen don't be sad  
They're just a bunch of fools  
And you can make them powerless  
Don't let them make the rules  
So, Karen don't be sad  
You know the truth is true  
The world can still be beautiful  
That part's up to you  
So, Karen don't be sad  
  
[Verse 2]  
Oh, Karen  
You know you're only letting 'em win  
By letting all their lies and hate  
Destroy you from within-in  
Oh, Karen  
They've taken away your smile  
But you can give it back to us  
Just fake it for a while  
  
[Chorus]  
So, Karen don't be sad  
They're just a bunch of fools  
And you can make them powerless  
Don't let them make the rules  
So, Karen don't be sad  
You know the truth is true  
The world can still be beautiful  
That part's up to you  
So, Karen don't be sad  
  
[Outro]  
So, Karen don't be sad  
Don't let 'em win  
Oh, don't let 'em win  
Don't let them win  
Don't let them win  
Oh, don't let them win  
Oh, don't let them win  
Don't let them win
