Well they all said Louise was not half bad  
It was written on the walls and window shades  
And how she'd act a little girl  
A deceiver, don't believe her, that's her trade  
Sometimes a bottle of perfume  
Flowers and maybe some lace  
Men brought Louise ten cent trinkets  
Their intentions were easily traced  
Yes and everybody knew at times she cried  
Ah but women like Louise well they get by  
  
Yes and everybody thought it kinda sad  
When they found Louise in her room  
They'd always put her down below their kind  
Still some cried when she died this afternoon  
  
Louise rode home on the mail train  
Somewhere to the south I heard her say  
Too bad it ended so ugly  
Too bad she had to go this way  
  
Ah but the wind is blowing cold tonight  
Well goodnight Louise goodnight
