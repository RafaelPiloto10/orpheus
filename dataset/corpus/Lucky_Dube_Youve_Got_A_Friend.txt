I still believe in a little bit of magic  
Even though the world has gone crazy  
So good to know we still have a friend  
You came to me last night and whispered in my ear  
Told me not to worry about anything, yeah  
You said you are still my friend  
And the feeling is mutual  
Right here  
  
Thabo, Thabo, my friend Thabo  
Thabo, Thabo, your friend Thabo  
Thabo, Thabo, your friend Thabo  
Thabo, Thabo, our friend Thabo  
  
I believe  
  
You've got a friend in me  
You've got a friend  
Don't have to worry no more  
  
Go! Go! Thabo  
Go! Go! Thabo  
  
Your fears will be my fears  
Your dreams will be my dreams too  
Even your joys will be my joys too  
'Cause a friend in need is a friend indeed  
  
I love Thabo  
You love Thabo  
Thabo, we love you  
Go! Go! Go! Thabo  
  
You've got a friend  
Don't have to worry no more
