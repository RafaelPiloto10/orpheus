You can change the way you live  
You can make it ?  
You can turn it up or down  
You can change the things you're told  
You can crucify the word on a cross of gold  
You can crucify the word on a cross of gold  
Oh oh oh  
You can lie to every face  
You can use a stranglehold  
You can lose or win the chase  
You can sell your very soul  
You can crucify the word on a cross of gold  
You can crucify the word on a cross of gold  
Oh oh oh  
You can steal the things you need  
You can keep the people down  
You can take the best there is  
To the shelters underground  
You can crucify the word on a cross of gold  
You can crucify the word on a cross of gold
