I don't want to hear you say you're sorry  
I don't want to hear you say we can start all over again  
I think you must think that I'm stupid  
Well, I might be stupid for the rest of my life  
But, ill never be stupid to you again  
  
I just want it all to go away  
Yeah  
Just go away  
Yeah  
  
I can see the light above me  
I hear the sound of a brand new song  
I don't want to hear your reasons  
Because I know what's right  
I know what's wrong  
  
I can see the light above me  
I hear the sound of a brand new day  
I'm not going to settle for less  
And I don't think things are ever going to change  
  
I just want it all to go away  
  
I don't want to hear about your damage  
I don't want to hear you say  
That you think I'm damaged too  
Because I know you know that the damage in me  
Is from the horrible things  
You say and do  
I know that the damage in me  
Comes from the damage in you  
  
I just want it all  
To go away  
  
I can see the light above me  
I hear the sound of a brand new song  
I don't want to hear your reasons  
Because I know what's right  
I know what's wrong  
  
I can see the light above me  
I hear the sound of a brand new day  
I'm not going to settle for less  
And I don't think things are ever going to change  
  
I just want it all to go away  
  
Yeah  
  
Just go away  
  
Yeah  
  
I don't want to talk about it  
I don't want to hear your lies  
I don't want to talk about it  
And I don't understand why you just do not realize  
  
I don't want to hear you say you're sorry  
I don't want to hear you say we can start all over again  
  
Whoa  
(Whoa)  
  
I can see the light above me  
I hear the sound of a brand new song  
And I don't want to know your reasons  
Because I know what's right  
I know what's wrong  
  
I can see the light above me  
I hear the sound of a brand new day  
I can picture our lives without you  
And I don't think things are ever going to change  
  
I just want it all to go away  
  
I can see the light above me  
Hear the sound of a brand new song  
I don't want to know your reasons  
Because I know what's right  
I know what's wrong
