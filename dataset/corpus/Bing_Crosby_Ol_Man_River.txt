Ol' man river  
That ol' man river  
He don't say nothing  
But he must know something  
Cause he just keeps rolling  
He keeps rolling along  
Rollin' along  
He don't plant tators  
He don't plant cotton  
Them that plants 'em is soon forgotten  
But ol' man river  
He keeps rolling along  
You and me  
We sweat and strain  
Body all aching  
And wracked with pain  
Tote that barge  
Lift that bale  
Get a little drunk  
And you land in jail  
I gets weary  
Sick of trying  
I'm tired of living  
Feared of dying  
But ol' man river  
He's rolling along
