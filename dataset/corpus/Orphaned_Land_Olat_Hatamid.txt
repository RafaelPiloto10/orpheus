Judge of the earth, who wilt arraign the nations at thy judgment seat, with
life and favor bless again thy people prostrate at thy feet.  
And mayest thou our morning prayer receive, O lord, as though it were the
offering that was wont to be brought day by day continually.  
O thou, whose mercy faiteth not, to us thy heavenly grace accord:  
Deal kindly with thy people's lot, and grant them life, our king and lord.  
Let thou the mark of life appear upon their brow from year to year, as when
were daily want to be the offerings brought continually.
