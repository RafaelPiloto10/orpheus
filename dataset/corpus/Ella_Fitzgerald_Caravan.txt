Night and stars above that shine so bright  
The mystery of their fading light  
That shines upon our caravan  
  
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep  
Across the sand so I may keep  
The memory of our caravan  
  
This is so exciting  
You are so inviting  
Resting in my arms  
As I thrill to the magic charms  
  
Of you beside me here beneath the blue  
My dream of love is coming true  
Within our desert caravan!
