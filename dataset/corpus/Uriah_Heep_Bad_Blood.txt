Desperate man, desperate times  
Desperate heart  
Once she was mine  
Bad blood, cold sweat  
The more I give, the less I get  
She picked clean to the bone  
Black ice, danger zone  
  
Bad blood runs through her veins  
She's got bad blood  
She'll never change  
I held on long as I could  
But that girl, bad blood  
  
Perfect crimes, no clues  
That girl's just bad news  
I held on long as I could  
Bad girl, bad blood  
She cut clean to the bone  
Tight jeans, danger zone  
  
Girl's got bad blood  
  
Glass heart, fools gold  
Her blood is stone cold  
Held on long as I could  
But that girl's just no good  
She picked clean to the bone  
Black ice, danger zone
