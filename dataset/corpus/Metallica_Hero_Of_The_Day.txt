Mama, they try and break me.  
The window burns to light the way back home  
A light that warms no matter where they've gone.  
They're off to find the hero of the day  
But what if they should fall by someone's wicked way?  
Still the window burns, time so slowly turns  
Someone there is sighing  
Keepers of the flames  
Do you feel your names?  
Do you hear your babies crying?  
Mama they try and break me  
Still they try and break me  
'Scuse me while I tend to how I feel  
These things return to me that still seem real  
Now deservingly this easy chair  
But the rocking stops by wheels of despair  
Don't want your aid  
But the fist I've made for years won't hold or feel  
No I'm not all me  
So please excuse me while I tend to how I fell  
But now the dreams and waking screams that ever last through the night (echoed
between James and Jason)  
  
So build the wall behind it crawl and hide until it's light  
Can you hear your babies crying now?  
Still the window burns  
Time so slowly turns  
And someone there is sighing  
Keepers of the flames, can't you feel your names?  
Can't you hear your babies crying?  
But now the dreams and waking screams that  
Ever last the night  
So build a wall behind it crawl  
And hide until it's light  
So can't you hear your babies crying now?  
Mama they try and break me  
Mama they try and break me  
Mama they try and break me  
Mama they try mama they try  
Mama they try and break me  
Mama they try and break me  
Mama they try and break me  
Mama they try and break me  
Mama they try and break me  
Mama they try and break me  
Mama they try Mama they try
