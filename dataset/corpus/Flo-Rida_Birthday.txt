I dont want no cake on my birthday, I want my cake errday [x4]  
  
I gone be honest tomorrow aint promised thats why I say this  
Here today then you gone like rentin' a car from Avis  
Hurts but its the truth you ?? out that Mercedes  
That's why I be on point, I'm never procastinatin'  
You better be dodgin' saten, that ??? be hatin'  
Want his cake and eat it too  
Then do you greasy like bacon  
Everyday money chasin'  
I'm so in love with the fragrance  
So what I'm a little impatient  
[?] got no patience  
I'm actin like I'm racin'  
Before I become a rasin'  
Strippers hotter then cajun  
My ?? be in rotation  
The daily birthday occasion  
I'm rarely off of vacation  
I'm rarely out of the nation  
And nelly dollars ??  
  
I dont want no cake on my birthday, I want my cake errday [x4]  
  
I ain't talkin' next year  
I ain't talkin' in a month  
I ain't talkin' in a week  
Every day I wanna stunt  
Every day I want sum candles  
Every day a hundred bones  
Every day I pull up in lambos, filet meion for lunch  
What my birthday  
You got my birthday  
When my birthday  
You better say my birthday  
I get emotional  
That's what c-notes will do  
Them penny lofer shoes help me cop a Bentley coupe  
Now my string of wemen hotter than Campbells soup  
Boy that cake will make them peps turn to animals  
I'm King Kong and it's your trainin' day  
Denzel with the ice and I'm pushin' weight  
I ain't tryin' [?] 'em all  
  
I ain't tryin' ???  
But Biggie got a wife she ain't with him not a day  
Ain't no body here to stay  
You can try and get away  
I'll [?] pray  
My advice still the same
