Flesh 'n' blood  
A human fascination  
Acuired the taste  
Right on my face  
Naughty  
Lost in lust  
A hopeless situation  
Let the game begin  
I'm shirts you're skins  
Naughty  
  
There hunger pains  
Growing inside me every day  
I feel it in my veins  
Burning inside me every day  
  
Chorus:  
I wanna eat your body  
Eat your body  
Naughty, naughty, naughty  
Talkin' 'bout your body  
Flesh, Blood  
I think I'm in love  
Naughty, naughty, naughty  
Eating up your body  
  
Driving down  
A sticky occupation  
I need another shot  
Of some foor for thought  
Naughty  
  
These hunger pains  
Growing inside me everyday  
I feel it in my veins  
Buring inside me every day  
  
CHORUS  
  
Everybody's got a need  
Everybody's got to feed  
On everybody else's body  
Everybody's got a need  
Everybody's got to feed  
On everybody  
  
Vegetarians eat your heart out
