Hello cowgirl in the sand  
Is this place at your command?  
Can I stay here for a while?  
Can I see your sweet, sweet smile  
  
Old enough now, to change your name  
When so many love you is it the same?  
It's the woman in you that makes you want to play this game  
  
Hello ruby in the dust  
Has your band begun to rust?  
After all the sin we had  
I was hopin' that we'd turn bad  
  
Old enough now, to change your name  
When so many love you is it the same?  
It's the woman in you that makes you want to play this game  
  
Hello woman of my dreams  
Is this not the way it seems?  
Purple words on a gray background  
To be a woman and to be turned down  
  
Old enough now, to change your name  
When so many love you is it the same?  
It's the woman in you that makes you want to play this game
