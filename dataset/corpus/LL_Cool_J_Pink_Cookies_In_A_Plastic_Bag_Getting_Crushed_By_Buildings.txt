[Chorus]  
Pink cookies in a plastic bag, getting crushed by buildings  
Pink cookies in a plastic bag, getting crushed by buildings  
  
I'll take 30 electric chairs  
And put 'em in a classroom  
30 MC's  
And set'em free from their doom.  
Just like a tomahawk cuts through the wind  
When we begin  
The wheel of fortune it spins  
Holdin'  
The rhythm like elastic  
Moldin'  
Your whole body like plastic  
So why try to deny what ya already know ya love  
Up above  
Cause the mania  
Hysteria  
In the streets  
While ya lovers getting merrier  
In the sheets  
I met this lady named  
Sweet young thing and  
She gave me that feeling  
That sunshine bring in.  
Hordable  
Sportable  
Totally affordable  
Silky smooth  
Voice was real audible.  
I said your cool as Ice Cuba  
She said, "your that Public Enemy  
I seen on the tuba."  
No  
I'm like your Uncle baby.  
The style of your beautiful face  
Drives me crazy.  
Well can we do ya so Heavy ah D?  
She said, "You tried to play me  
Like Big Dad-dy."  
I said, "I know your Tribe,  
I Called and re-Quested  
For you to be manifested."  
She said, "You know the Same Gang and my Flava Unit too?"  
I said, "You only knew the certain things I wanna do, do you?"  
Rub ya down with warm Ice-T  
Make ya feel Bran Nubian  
Instantly.  
Boogie Down  
And check this Production.  
Gimme them lips  
They look good for suction.  
She said, "Sweet tease  
Cool with a little almond joy  
On the side  
Just doin' the fly"  
You like pound cake?  
Comin' to my house  
Turn on the lights  
And see me on the couch.  
I said, "Do the jingle  
And your from around the way.  
I like your earrings  
L's  
But anyway,  
Your grand-daddy is  
Here to spread cheer.  
Something nice and smooth  
With my tongue in your ear.  
Give me a snack  
Some Salt And Pepper on a burger.  
Ice Cube T  
Or if you prefer the  
Taste of honey Kid  
Ride in my Capri and  
That's the joint  
They got the real clear CD in.  
She said, "Stars couldn't get me in a car.  
I don't know what type of man ya are.  
You might know karate  
Do me and get away  
I got a glimpse of your license plate  
N-W-A."  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
She was Chubby and  
Ready to Rock  
Naughty By Nature and  
Part of my private stock and  
Riding in the relax  
Frame of mind and  
Hammer timing  
Incredible.  
So edible  
And unforgettable.  
Soft like a Q-Tip  
I'd love to get with you  
Cause I'm the type of guy that got props do  
Feel it in mo and more,  
When I get ready for a showcase  
Put together well  
I go deep  
And have an oil well  
Show and tell.  
I said, "Yo-Yo!  
You're so intelligent  
And elegant."  
I n-I never Run to be D  
With another MC  
I got what I want  
Right in front of me.  
I know a kid named K  
He's a MD.  
Last time I heard  
Yo, was getting real friendly.  
Belly to belly and  
Chest to chest  
Thigh by thigh  
Leg by leg and  
I guess.  
Ain't no way to get ya out  
Your so caught up S-E-X-U-A-L - sort  
Of a freaky situation  
With a peppermint twist  
Ricky or Mike is next on the list.  
Nastified and all-funkified  
Come'on  
Come'on  
Come'on  
Ride.  
Can you hear?  
Never fear  
Whatcha hear.  
What ya hear  
Is it clear?  
Understand  
And love ya big dear  
And I will appear  
My dear  
With a beer  
And bags full of cheer  
And waterbed,  
Yeah!  
Cause I rumble and groan.  
She said, "You got to be bad to  
Make the moanie moan."  
Ain't no reason to front  
On the way your life shown.  
Boo-ya!  
How I'm jumpin' your bones  
Like a Grand  
Master in a Flash.  
Put out your cigarette  
And rest your tired ash.  
All I wanna do  
Is make woopie  
Your my pink cookie.  
Not a wookie  
When you take it off  
I'd love a lookie.  
Cause I'ma mix it up toss style.  
Peace out  
You got the sexual profile.  
  
[Chorus]
