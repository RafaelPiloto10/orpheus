Love is beautiful, love is swell  
Love is as sweet as a nut  
Love is grander than tongue can tell  
Love is remarkable, but  
Look at what it did to Antony  
It made a fool out of Antony  
If love could do that to Antony  
What chance have I with love?  
Look at what it did to Romeo  
It dealt poor Romey an awful blow  
If love could do that to Romeo  
What chance have I with love?  
Look at what it did to Samson  
'Til he lost his hair he was brave  
If a haircut could weaken Samson  
They could murder me with a shave  
Look at what it did to Bonaparte  
He lost his head when he lost his heart  
If he kicked over the apple cart  
What chance have I  
An ordinary guy  
What chance have I with love
