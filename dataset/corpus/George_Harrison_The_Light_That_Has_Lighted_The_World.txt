I've heard how some people, have said  
That I've changed  
That I'm not what I was  
How it really is a shame  
The thoughts in their heads,  
Manifest on their brow  
Like bad scars from ill feelings  
They themselves arouse  
So hateful of anyone that is happy  
Or 'free'  
They live all their lives,  
Without looking to see  
The light that has lighted the world  
It's funny how people, just won't  
Accept change  
As if nature itself - they'd prefer  
Re-arranged  
So hard to move on  
When you're down in a hole  
Where there's so little chance,  
To experience soul  
I'm grateful to anyone,  
That is happy or 'free'  
For giving me hope  
While I'm looking to see  
The light that has lighted the world
