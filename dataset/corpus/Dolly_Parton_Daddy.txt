Mama never seemed to miss the finer things in life  
If she did, she never did say so to daddy  
She never wanted to be more than mother and a wife  
If she did, she never did say so to daddy  
The only things that seemed to be  
Important in her life  
Was to make our house a home and make us happy  
Mama never wanted any more than what she had  
If she did, she never did say so to daddy  
  
He often left her all alone  
She didn't mind the stayin' home  
If she did, she never did say so to daddy  
And she never missed the flowers  
And the gifts he never gave her  
If she did, she never did say so to daddy  
  
Being took for granted  
Was a thing that she accepted  
And she didn't need those things to make her happy  
She didn't even seem to notice  
That he didn't kiss and hold her  
If she did, she never did say so to daddy  
  
One morning we awoke, just to find the note  
That mama carefully wrote and left to daddy  
And as he began to read it  
Our ears could not believe it  
The words that she had written there to daddy  
  
She said, "Our kids are old enough  
And they don't need me very much  
So I've gone in search for love I need so badly  
I have needed you so long  
But I just can't keep holdin' on"  
She never meant to come back home  
If she did, she never did say so to daddy  
  
Mama's gone  
Goodbye to daddy
