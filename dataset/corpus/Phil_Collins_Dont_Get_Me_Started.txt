Don't get me started on politicians  
And the lies they spread  
Don't even mention sex and religion  
And who they take to bed  
But if you see me running down the street  
Know where I'm running to  
I'm tired of honesty being denied us  
I'm coming looking for you  
  
Don't hold me down, I'm on my way  
And nothing's gonna turn me round  
Don't turn around, give it to me straight  
I'm on my way and nothing's gonna shake me  
I'll hold my ground  
Wild horses won't make me  
  
Don't get me started on information  
Magazines and t.v.  
There's one man under his big umbrella  
While it's raining on you and me  
Everyday it's getting harder to judge  
Fiction from fact  
I'm tired of truth being denied me  
It's mine and I want it back  
  
Don't hold me down, I'm on my way  
And nothing's gonna turn me round  
Don't turn around, give it to me straight  
I'm on my way and nothing's gonna shake me  
I'll hold my ground  
Wild horses won't make me  
  
Business as usual in our pressure steamer  
Where reality slips from view  
They say that we can't take it  
I think I can, can you?  
  
Don't get me started on blood and thunder  
With people flying blind  
Not caring what or who they take with them  
Or what they leave behind  
It's one mans God against another  
While the river of tears roll by  
The things they do in the name of their father  
Can someone tell me why  
  
Don't hold me down, I'm on my way  
And nothing's gonna turn me round  
Don't turn around, give it to me straight  
I'm on my way and nothing's gonna shake me  
I'll hold my ground  
Don't get me started
