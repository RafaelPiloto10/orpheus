[Chorus:]  
Eve never pleases me and Kitty can  
Eve never pleases me and Kitty can  
  
When Kitty smiles, the world stands still  
I see a thousand golden daffodils  
But when she cries, the world just dies  
I see a million tears in Kitty's eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now Eve is bad and treats me cruel  
She loves to see me looking like a fool  
I find a way with words I say  
To be in love in such a lonely way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now they are two and I am one  
I cannot fall in love with everyone  
So I must choose between the two  
Made up my mind, now I am choosing you  
  
[Chorus]
