Imagine  
The dreams we had since we were children  
Are real  
It's magick  
To see their minds filled with the music  
We feel  
Well here's your message from above  
And if you want to push come to shove  
Alright  
This ain't no lullaby  
We're right at home in the California sky  
  
Illusions  
Are taking part of the confusion  
In me  
Tomorrow  
There'll be no heroes left to follow  
You'll see  
Bright lights that flash across the sky  
May be the reason why we're all insane and I  
I don't want to get away and  
We're right at home in the California sky  
  
Live from the mansion on the hill  
Reminds me of the way we used to feel right  
Orion's aligned now  
Turn back the time  
The California sky
