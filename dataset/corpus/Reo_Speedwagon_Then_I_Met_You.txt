I thought I had all I could ask for  
Only a fool would think there was more  
I would never have believed  
That anything could feel brand new  
Then I met you  
  
I'd been around the world, and then some  
Anything I wanted I could get some  
But I had not been anywhere  
I could not share the things I knew  
Then I met you  
  
Oh then I met you  
  
I never thought I would ever say  
That I need you the way I do  
But then I never felt what I'm feeling today  
I just never knew, then I met you  
  
I've heard my songs over the radio  
They follow me wherever I go  
I wold listen to my own words  
And wonder why they'd never ring quite true  
Then I met you, and I knew
