Alarm clock, ding-dong, pants up, boots on  
Coffee, cigarette, blue-collar breakfast  
Hard hat, fork lift, dragging through a swing shift  
Stacking up the boxes, watching that clock  
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock  
Working for the man sure makes a man thirsty  
Need a little neon, get a little drink on  
Friday can't come fast enough y'all  
  
Na-na, na-na-na, na  
Na-na, na-na-na, na  
Let the good times roll when the guitars play  
Here's to another week gone  
Raise 'em up and sing along  
Friday can't come fast enough  
  
Baby's on the cell phone, calling from a tanning bed  
Hit the mall, got a dress, nails done, hair did  
Running through my money, like a water through a faucet  
Well so dry you can here those dollars  
Drip drop, drip drop, drip drop, drip drop  
Payin' them bills sure make a man thirsty  
Need a little neon, time to get a drink on,  
Friday can't come fast enough  
  
Na-na, na-na-na, na  
Na-na, na-na-na, na  
Let the good times roll when the guitars play  
Here's to another week gone  
Raise 'em up and sing along  
Friday can't come fast enough  
  
Na-na, na-na-na, na  
Na-na, na-na-na, na  
Na-na, na-na-na, na  
  
We need a little neon  
Time to get your drink on  
Friday can't come fast enough  
Here's to another week gone  
Raise 'em up and sing along  
Friday can't come fast enough  
(Yeah, friday can't come fast enough)
