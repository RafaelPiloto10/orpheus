Just that sweet little mystery that breaks my heart  
Just that sweet little mystery makes me cry  
O that sweet little mystery that's in your heart  
It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me try.  
  
My friends all tell me that I look so sad  
They don't need to ask me why  
They know the reason that I feel so bad  
Since the night you said goodbye  
It's not the letters that you just don't write  
It's not the arms of some new friend  
It's not the crying in the dead of the night  
That keeps me hanging on, waiting for the end.  
  
Just that sweet little mystery that's in your heart  
Just that sweet little mystery makes me cry  
Oh that sweet little mystery that's in your heart  
It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me try.  
  
I watch the street, I watch the radio  
I don't need to turn it on  
Another friend comes by and tries to say hello  
Another weekend's almost gone  
It's not the letters that you just don't write  
It's not the arms of some new friend  
It's not the crying in the depth of the night  
That keeps me hanging on, just waiting for the end.  
  
It's that sweet little mystery that's in your heart  
It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me cry  
Oh that sweet little mystery that's in your heart  
It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me try.  
  
The time is flying fast, and I don't care  
To spend another night alone  
I want to see you, but I don't know where  
Till then I'm walking on my own  
It's not the letters that you just don't write  
It's not the arms of some new friend  
It's not the crying in the depth of the night  
That keeps me hanging on, just waiting for the end.  
  
It's that sweet little mystery that's in your heart  
It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me cry  
Oh that sweet little mystery that's in your heart  
It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me try.  
  
That sweet little mystery that's in your heart  
It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me cry  
Oh that sweet little mystery that's in your heart  
It's just that sweet little mystery that makes me try.  
  
Sweet mystery, sweet mystery  
Sweet mystery, sweet mystery, sweet mystery  
Sweet mystery, sweet mystery, sweet mystery  
Sweet mystery, sweet mystery, sweet mystery.
