There's no reason to look at me that way  
Old memories won't let my love stay  
Your touch just leads me to an open door  
And when he touches me, I can't feel you anymore  
When he touches me, I can't feel you anymore  
He touches me with so much love, I never felt before  
Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue  
And now that leaving you has come  
And when he touches me, I can't feel you anymore  
You're so late with your new plans for two  
He had lots of nights to love me away from you  
But the first time that he touched me, I was sure  
When he touches me, I can't feel you anymore  
When he touches me, I can't feel you anymore  
He touches me with so much love, I never felt before  
Goodbye's on the tip of my tongue  
And now that leaving you has come  
And when he touches me, I can't feel you anymore  
Anymore
