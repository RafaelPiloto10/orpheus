This vacation's useless  
These white pills aren't kind  
I've given a lot of thought on this 13 hour drive  
I miss the grinding concrete where we sat past 8 or 9  
And slowly finished laughing in the glow of our headlights  
I've given a lot of thought to the nights we use to have  
The days have come and gone  
Our lives went by so fast  
I faintly remember breathing on your bedroom floor  
Where I laid and told you but you swear you loved me more  
  
Do you care if I don't know what to say  
Will you sleep tonight, will you think of me  
Will I shake this off pretend it's all okay  
That there's someone out there who feels just like me  
There is  
  
Those notes you wrote me  
I've kept them all  
I've given a lot of thought of how to write you back this fall  
With every single letter in every single word  
There will be a hidden message about a boy that  
Loves a girl  
  
Do you care if I don't know what to say  
Will you sleep tonight or will you think of me  
Will I shake this off  
Pretend it's all okay that there's someone out there who feels just like me  
There is  
  
Do you care if I don't know what to say?  
Will you sleep tonight or will you think of me  
Will I shake this off  
Pretend it's all okay that there's someone out there who feels just like me  
  
Do you care if I don't know what to say?  
Will ou sleep tonight or will you think of me  
Will I shake this off  
Pretend it's all okay that there's someone out there who feels just like me  
There is
