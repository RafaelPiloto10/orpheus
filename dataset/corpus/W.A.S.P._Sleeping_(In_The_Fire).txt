Touch, touch in the flame's desires  
Feeling the pain's denial  
And your fingers in the fire  
  
Look, look in the candlelight  
See in the flame of life  
And my spell is our lie  
  
(Chorus):  
Taste the love  
The Lucifer's magic that makes you numb  
The passion and all the pain are one  
You're sleeping in the fire  
Taste the love  
The Lucifer's magic that makes you numb  
You feel what it does and you're drunk on love  
You're sleeping in the fire  
  
I gaze and the flame and fire burn  
And cry out the name of which I yearn  
  
(Chorus)  
  
Taste the love  
The Lucifer's magic that makes you numb  
The passion and all the pain are one  
You're sleeping in the fire
