Janine - what's going on  
Janine - I know that something sure is wrong  
there's lights out on the road  
And they're searchin' for you  
Janine - life wasn't fair  
Janine - when you got home and no-one cared  
But running from your life  
You let the vultures get through  
And they feed on you, they feed on you  
Chorus:  
So what you gonna do when the lights burn out Janine  
What you gonna do when your light burns out  
Janine - you want the truth  
Janine - you'll find the pressure's now on you  
You wanted all the world  
But they've taken it all  
And they're bleeding you, they're bleeding you  
So, what you gonna do when the lights burn out Janine  
What you gonna do when your light burns out  
Heh Kid, don't hesitate  
Don't stick around now  
I bet you can hardly wait  
Oh what a time I'll give to you  
But it's never true  
Janine - you'll soon be there  
Janine - you're on a wing and a prayer  
But Angels love their own  
And they're reaching out for you  
Janine ..... Oh Janine
