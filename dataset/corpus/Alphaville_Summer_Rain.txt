World without a breeze  
Heartbeat of the heat above the harbour  
Lazy day lies dazed upon the shelf  
Atomic lizards lick at the blaze of the  
Light that is forever  
No move in the solid skies  
No gleaming metal out of the  
Breathtaking blue  
  
My golden circus girls all sailed away  
The lion tamers are no longer due to play  
Whoever breaks the seven seals and lets  
The angry angels free  
I do not know  
Just waiting here  
For summer rain  
For summer rain  
Or anything else  
  
Prophet hold your head up  
Into a cluster of bees and listen  
"Love of my life  
Here is all our honey  
Yes, we can change the world, together"  
And if we're still invited to walk  
In this party  
I'd go for a saucerful of secrets or more  
But last thing I heard of was that GOD had  
Left the lines  
For a brandnew universe  
He was supposed to say  
  
My golden circus girls all sailed away  
The lion tamers are no longer due to play  
Whoever breaks the seven seals and lets  
The angry angels free  
I do not care just waiting over there  
For summer rain  
For summer rain  
  
What a glorious feeling  
I'm happy again  
Cool Rain
