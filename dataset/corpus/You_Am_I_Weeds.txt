Well who'd of thought and who could know?  
That time was ever gonna go this darn slow  
And she's late and you just don't know  
If you're ever gonna get on through this year alone  
It was the way she put her hand on her hip  
The sparkle in her eye  
But you wonder if its gonna be there all the time  
Leaves they fall  
You know you're never gonna sweep em all  
And weeds they grow  
And peeking out all through the grass and snow  
And he's a fake yeah  
From his smile to the tatts right there on his toes  
But you're just not sure if you're ever  
Gonna get through this year alone  
He don't hold your hand just when you need  
And you're sure that twinkle in his eye  
Ain't just there for you  
but you can't ignore that  
He sure looks like your dad  
When can still look straight at night  
When he tucks you in and kisses your belly  
And strokes your hair so you just don't cry  
Leaves they fall  
You know you're never gonna sweep em all  
And weeds they grow  
And peeking out all through the grass and snow  
You sure wish you knew who was on the halfback flank  
About twenty years  
When you took those flags onback to back  
Would sure make the stand offs and make more sense  
If you could stand toe to toe  
And who took the bench  
But not this silent treatment  
That leaves you wondering if this baby's heaven sent  
It was the way she put her hand on her hip  
The sparkle in her eye  
But you wonder if it's gonna be there all the time  
Leaves they fall  
You know that you can never sweep em all  
And weeds they grow  
And peeking out all through the grass and snow
