Well we were gettin' ready just the other night  
When a knock on the dressing room door  
Gave way to a leather jacket little girl  
Who we'd never ever seen before  
  
In her red satin dress  
And her high heeled shoes  
She took us all by surprise  
And when she asked us what we wanted to do  
  
She said it with her eyes  
Just getcha rocks off  
Whoah  
Well when we finally took the stage  
  
There she was but she wasn't on her own  
'Cause she'd brought some friends maybe 5 or 6  
Yeah, she must have been on the phone  
And when they started dancing and jumping around  
  
Well we couldn't believe our eyes  
'Cause they'd got the whole damn audience rockin'  
And they'd got us paralyzed  
Just get ya rocks off  
Thank you  
Goodnight  
Whoah
