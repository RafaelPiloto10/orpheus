Put the red lights on  
Don't tell them that you're gone  
Leave behind your fears  
You know they can't be wrong  
Kill the pain you feel  
Kill the pain you feel  
  
I know you've seen some things  
That hurt you in your dreams  
Your face it tells the story  
The pages stained with tears  
  
Kill the pain you feel  
Kill the pain you feel  
Keep the heart  
You feel within  
  
Take the curtains down  
The sun is what you found  
It leads you far from here  
And takes you to high ground  
  
Find a way  
Keep the heart  
You have within
