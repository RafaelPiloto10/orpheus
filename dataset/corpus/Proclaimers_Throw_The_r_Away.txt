I've been so sad  
Since you said my accent was bad  
He's worn a frown  
This Caledonia clown  
I'm just going to have to learn to hesitate  
To make sure my words  
  
On your Saxen ears don't grate  
But I wouldn't know a single word to say  
If I flattened all the vowels  
And threw the 'are' away  
  
You say that if I want to get ahead  
The language I use should he left for dead  
It doesn't please your ears  
  
And though you tell it like a leg pull  
I think your still full of John Bull  
You just refuse to bear  
  
Some days I stand  
On your green and pleasant land  
Now dare I show face  
When my diction is such a disgrace  
  
Oh what can I do  
To be understood by you  
Perhaps for some money  
I could talk like a bee dripping honey.
