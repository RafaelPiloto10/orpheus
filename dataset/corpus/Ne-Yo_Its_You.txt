It's you, it's you, it's you.  
It's you (Ooh)  
  
I'm at a lost, don't know what to say to you. (Mm)  
Throwing me off, I know what I feel but I can't tell you I do.  
See now I know my fights not for myself, my fight's for you.  
  
You're everything I never wanted to want, it's true.  
Said you're everything I never wanted to want, it's you.  
It's you, it's you, it's you.  
It's you, it's you. (Mm) (Ey)  
  
I'll write a song three times a day but I can't talk to you. (Ooh)  
I know what's wrong, I never meant for me to feel like I do (Oh)  
If this is love, it sucks cause I don't want it but I do.  
  
You're everything I never wanted to want, it's true.  
Said you're everything I never wanted to want, it's you.  
It's you, it's you, it's you.  
It's you, it's you. (Mm) (Ey)  
  
Just walk away (ay), wipe that smile off your face. (Hey)  
I just wish I could say that to you.  
But I need you tonight.  
Need you tonight...  
I need you for life.  
Need you for life, life, life.  
  
Said you're everything I never wanted to want, it's true.  
Said you're everything I never wanted to want, it's you.  
It's you, it's you, it's you.  
(Oh woah woah)  
It's you, it's you. (Mm) (Ey)
