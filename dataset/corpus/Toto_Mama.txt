I don't love you anymore  
Money's  
Got me crawlin' on the floor  
  
Lover  
I'm so ashamed that I must go  
Funny  
Somehow I thought by now you'd know  
  
[Chorus]  
Girl you'd better take my hand  
And say what you mean to say  
(And she said)  
"Stay as long as you can  
But don't wait till you're thrown away."  
  
Mama  
Please throw me out in the cold  
Woman  
The love you bought was never sold  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mama  
I don't love you anymore  
Sorry  
I'm not the boy you're looking for  
  
(See the girl with they eyes on fire  
Now he know she's the one he desires)
