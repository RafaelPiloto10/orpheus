Walls start closing in around you  
My twins of evil  
They shake you by the collarbone  
Then snap your ribcage  
  
And broken bodies in a death rock dance hall  
Please be my partner  
Eyeballs pop, accellerated blood beat  
Veins 'a' shaking  
  
And all hell breaks loose  
Yea, evil is as evil does and who  
Yea, who but me could write this book of cruel  
  
I send my murdergram  
To all these monster kids  
It comes right back to me and it's  
Signed in there parents' blood  
  
And all hell breaks loose  
Yea, my heart is a-breaking loose  
Yea, my whole world's breaking loose  
Yea, and evil is as does and who  
Yea, but who but me could write this book of cruel  
  
I send my mudergram  
To all these monster kids  
It comes right back to me and it's  
Signed in their parents blood  
And broken bodies in a death rock dance hall  
Please be my partner  
And eyeballs pop, accellerated blood beat  
Veins a-shaking  
  
And all hell breaks loose  
Yea, my heart is a-breaking loose  
Yea, my whole world's breaking loose  
Yea, evil is as evil does and who  
Yea, but who but me could write this book of cruel  
  
I said my whole world's breaking loose  
Yea, my whole world's breaking loose  
Yea, my whole world's breaking loose  
Yea, my whole world's breaking  
All hell breaks loose
