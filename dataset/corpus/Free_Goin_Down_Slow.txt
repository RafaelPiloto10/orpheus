ODEN  
  
Yes I've had my fun  
If I don't get well no more  
Yes I've had my fun, baby  
If I don't get well no more  
You see I have this pain in me  
An I'm goin down slow  
Won't somebody write my mother  
Tell her the shape I'm in  
Please write my mother  
Tell her to pray for me  
Tell her to forgive my sin  
Tell her don't send no doctor  
Yes a doctor can do me no good  
Yes no doctor mama  
Doctor can do me no good  
But you see through all of my trials  
I never did all the things I could  
On the next train south  
Baby you can look for my...  
On the next train south  
Mama, you can look for...  
Yes now if you see my baby baby  
Yes you know I'm dead and gone
