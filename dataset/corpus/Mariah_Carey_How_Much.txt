The way I feel for you  
I can't describe  
lt's almost too intense  
To verbalize  
Essentially you're all  
I'm living for  
And basically each day  
I need you more and more  
  
[Chorus]  
Have you even been so enamored baby  
That's how much I love you  
All I need in this life you see  
Is me and my boyfriend  
Have you ever feint lost  
When you know you gotta leave me  
That's how much I love you  
  
Love is yours and mine  
Till the very end  
Just me and my boyfriend  
  
Don't underestimate the love in me  
It's obvious these feelings run so deep  
I fall and fall for you day after day  
Nobody else could ever take your place  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You don't gotta waste your time and worry  
You don't gotta look for reassurance  
'Cause clearly you're the only one that's getting this and  
Sugar I don't need nobody else  
But you  
And honey I ain't letting go too soon  
Because 1 can't get enough  
Why you asking how much?  
It's more than you can handle baby  
  
[Chorus]
