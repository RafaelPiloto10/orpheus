And all I see is little dots  
Some are smeared and some are spots  
Feels like a murder but that's alright  
Somebody said there's too much light  
Pull down the shade and it's alright  
It'll be over in a minute or two.  
  
I'm charged up...don't put me down  
Don't feel like talking...don't mess around  
I feel mean...I feel o.k.  
I'm charged up...electricity  
  
The boys are making a big mess  
This makes the girls all start to laugh  
I don't know what they're talking about  
The boys are worried, the girls are shocked  
They pick the sound and let it drop  
Nobody know what they're talking about  
  
I'm charged up...I'm kinda wooden  
I'm barely moving...I study motion  
I study myself...I fooled myself  
I'm charged up...it's pretty intense.  
I'm charged up...don't put me down  
Don't feel like talking...don't mess around  
I feel mean...I feel o.k.  
I'm charged up...electricity.
