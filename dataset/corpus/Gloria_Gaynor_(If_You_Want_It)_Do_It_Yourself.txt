Many years ago my dad said: "Sonny  
Lady luck may never come your way.  
If it's love you want or only money."  
This is what my daddy used to say.  
  
Well  
If you want it  
Oh  
  
Co out and get it  
Oh  
You gotta do it yourself  
  
You gotta do it yourself  
Well  
If you want it  
Oh  
  
Go out and get it  
Oh  
You gotta do it yourself  
  
You gotta do it yourself.  
  
Waitin' round for someone who can help you.  
Someone who can help you find your way  
  
If you think there's no one  
You can turn to  
There's someone just a looking glass away.  
  
Well  
If you want it  
Oh  
  
Go out and get it  
Oh  
  
Wishin' and a-hopi.n' for your fortune  
Prayin' that you'll see your lucky dayIf you're lookin' for some inspiration,  
This is what my daddy liked to say.  
  
Well  
If you want it  
Oh  
  
Go out and get it  
Oh
