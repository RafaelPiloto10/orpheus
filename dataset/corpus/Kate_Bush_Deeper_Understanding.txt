As the people here grow colder  
I turn to my computer  
And spend my evenings with it  
Like a friend.  
I was loading a new program  
I had ordered from a magazine  
"Are you lonely, are you lost?  
This voice console is a must"  
I press Execute.  
  
Hello, I know that you've been feeling tired.  
I bring you love and deeper understanding.  
Hello, I know that you're unhappy.  
I bring you love and deeper understanding.  
  
Well I've never felt such pleasure  
Nothing seemed to matter  
I neglected my bodily needs  
I did not eat, I did not sleep  
The intensity increasing  
'Til my family found me and intervened.  
But I was lonely, I was lost  
Without my little black box  
I pick up the phone and go Execute.  
  
Hello, I know that you've been feeling tired.  
I bring you love and deeper understanding.  
Hello, I know that you're unhappy.  
I bring you love and deeper understanding.  
  
I turn to my computer like a friend.  
I need deeper understanding.  
Give me deeper understanding.
