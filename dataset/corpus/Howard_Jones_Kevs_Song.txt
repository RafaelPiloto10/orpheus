Did we fail to see you crumble  
Did we watch you fade to black  
Jaw hanging brain aching no one can handle  
Did we forget?  
To understand  
Did you have it planned?  
We all thought that we knew you so well  
  
So much love to give and take  
Many dreams and plans to make  
Can't believe it we knew you so well  
  
Hardly bare to think what you went through  
As your feet fell through the air  
Hanging in a void of hopeless darkness  
Way beyond despair  
But you made us doubt  
We would've heard your cry  
Of desolation  
We went there as well  
  
So much love to give and take  
Must go on to celebrate  
What you gave us  
You knew us so well  
  
Rippling through a generation  
Aftershocks for years to come  
The angry final step is taken  
Never to be undone  
On the other side  
Was a wave to ride  
Through the storm cloud  
To bring you to shore  
  
So much love to give and take  
Must go on to celebrate  
What you gave us  
You knew us so well
