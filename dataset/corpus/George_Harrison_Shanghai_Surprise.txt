I can't understand how I've gone astray  
I should be sailing away on a liner  
I was knocked on my back on a dock at Yangtse  
It's a hell of a way to see China but I'm ready  
You must be crazy  
And you got no money  
And you're a liar  
My straits are dire from the, the wok into the fire  
I'd like to trust you but I've broken my rickshaw  
Sometimes there's no hope in, in chasing opium  
I'd like to love you but I'm not sure what's in your eyes  
Mm, Shanghai surprise  
Whatever you're saying, I want it anyway in  
Been hanging 'round like a kid at your back door  
(Ooh, babe)  
You could be kinder, and show me Asia minor  
I'll let you love me, let you see what's here in my eyes  
Shanghai surprise  
You must be crazy  
(Crazy)  
And you got no money  
(Money)  
And it seems like madness  
Back streets so crowded that no room to swing a cat  
I'd like to know you but you're acting so coolie  
I'm finding out pursued by evil looking dudes it's  
Getting hot for me like tofu when it deep fries  
Oh, Shanghai surprise  
But baby you look like any common crook  
That's hanging 'round in those real shady places  
(Ooh, babe)  
While you assess me, why not try to impress me?  
Step over here, let me see what's there in your eyes  
Oh, Shanghai surprise  
I don't understand how I got delayed  
I should be sailing today on a liner  
Was kicked in the ass on a dock at Yangtse  
It's no way for a man to see China but I'm ready  
You must be crazy  
(Crazy)  
And you got no money  
(Money)  
But you're a trier  
My straits are dire from the, the wok into the fire  
I'd like to meet you but I've broken my chopstick  
Sometimes there's no hope in, in chasing promises  
I wanna love you though it could prove to be unwise  
Shanghai surprise  
Whatever you're saying, I want it anyway in  
Been hanging 'round for a ride on your rickshaw  
(Ooh, babe)  
You may correct me, now that you've inspected me  
Come over here, let me feel you cut down to size  
Oh, Shanghai surprise  
My straits are dire from the, the wok into the fire  
I'd like to know you but I'm not really social  
Sometimes it's no joke, can't cope with opium  
I'd like to love you but I'm not sure what's in your eyes  
Shanghai surprise  
Shanghai surprise, Shanghai surprise  
And you got no money  
But you're a trier
