So many years gone  
Still I remember  
How did I ever let my heart believe  
In one who never gave enough to me  
  
And so many years gone  
And love that was so wrong  
I can't forget the way it used to be  
And how youve changed the test of love for me  
  
Chorus  
You were my one more chance  
I never thought I'd find  
You were the one romance  
I've always had in my mind  
  
No one will ever touch me more  
And I only hope that in return  
I might of saved the best of me for you  
  
And well have no ending, no, no  
If we can hold on  
And I think I've come this far because of you  
Could be no other love but ours will do  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
No one will ever touch me more  
I only hope that in return  
No matter how much we have to learn  
I saved the best of me for you
