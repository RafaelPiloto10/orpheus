Stuck here  
In the middle of no where  
With a headache  
And a heavy heart  
  
Oh well nothing  
Was going quite right here  
And I'm tired  
I can't play no part  
  
Come on come on  
Oh what a stake  
I'm in  
Come on come on  
Why won't it just  
Sake in  
The help is just around the corner  
For us  
  
Oh my head  
Just won't stop achin'  
I'm sat here lickin' my ruins  
I'm shattered  
But I really doesn't matter  
'Cause my rescue is gonna be here soon  
  
Come on come on  
Oh what a stake  
I'm in  
Come on come on  
Why won't it just  
Sake in  
The help is just around the corner  
For us  
The help is just around the corner  
For us  
Oh the help is just around the corner  
For us
