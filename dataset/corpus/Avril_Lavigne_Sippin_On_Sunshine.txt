Boy, you get me so high  
Buzzin' like a beehive  
It's just a little kiss  
But when It hits my lips  
I'm sippin' on sunshine  
Boy you're looking so fly  
Hotter than July  
I just wanna stay  
Forever and today  
Sippin' on sunshine  
  
Down at the beach, you holding my hand  
Got an umbrella stuck in the sand  
Watching the waves crash into the shore  
Baby, I want some more  
  
Hey  
What a beautiful day  
All I need is a taste  
Nothin' but a good time  
Sippin' on sunshine  
No, don't got nowhere to go  
So we'll go with the flow  
Yeah, we're living the life  
Sippin' on sunshine  
  
Sippin' on sunshine  
  
Boy, you blow my mind  
You got me up on cloud nine  
Just a little taste  
I wouldn't wanna waste  
A sip of that sunshine  
  
We can kick it all night  
Underneath the moonlight  
But when the party ends  
We'll do it all again  
Sippin' on sunshine  
  
Down at the beach, you holding my hand  
Got an umbrella stuck in the sand  
Watching the waves crash into the shore  
Baby, I want some more  
  
Hey  
What a beautiful day  
All I need is a taste  
Nothin' but a good time  
Sippin' on sunshine  
No, don't got nowhere to go  
So we'll go with the flow  
Yeah, we're living the life  
Sippin' on sunshine  
  
Sippin' on sunshine, sippin' on sunshine...  
Sippin' on sunshine, sippin' on sunshine...  
  
Hey  
What a beautiful day  
All I need is a taste (a taste so good)  
Nothin' but a good time (good time)  
Sippin' on sunshine  
No, don't got nowhere to go (do, don't)  
So we'll go with the flow (hell yeah)  
Yeah, we're living the life  
Sippin' on sunshine  
  
All day all night  
Yeah, good time  
Everybody just sippin' on sunshine  
  
Woah, woah, woah,  
Sippin' on sunshine
