Jolly old Saint Nicholas lean your ear this way  
Don't you tell a single soul what I'm going to say  
Christmas Eve is coming soon now you dear old man  
Whisper what you'll bring to me, tell me if you can  
  
When the clock is striking twelve, when I'm fast asleep  
Down the chimney broad and black with your pack you'll creep  
All the stockings you will find hanging in a row  
Mine will be the shortest one you'll be sure to know  
  
What's it gonna be, Santa  
Underneath the tree, Santa  
What's it gonna be, Santa  
Be this year for me  
  
Jolly old Saint Nicholas now you dear old man  
Whisper what you'll bring to me, tell me if you can  
  
What's it gonna be, Santa  
Underneath the tree, Santa  
What's it gonna be, Santa  
Be this year for me  
  
Jason wants a Fender bass, Walt a saxaphone  
Lee he needs a fluglehorn, Jimmy a trombone  
Robert wants a baby grand, Bill a new B3  
Tris, he wants a dolly, but  
What are you gonna bring to me, Santa  
  
What's it gonna be, Santa  
Underneath the tree, Santa  
What's it gonna be, Santa  
Be this year for me  
  
What's it gonna be, Santa  
Underneath the tree, Santa  
What's it gonna be, Santa  
Be this year for me  
How about a shiny electric guitar, Santa
