[Hook: Verse Simmonds]  
It's not a day that goes by  
(Ahhhhhh)  
That I don't wanna look in your eye  
(Ahhhhhh)  
Girl you so fine, I might try  
(Ahhhhhh)  
To fuck around and lick you dry  
(Ahhhhhh)  
It's not a day that goes by  
(Ahhhhhh)  
That I don't wanna look in your eye  
(Ahhhhhh)  
Girl you know you got that fye  
(Ahhhhhh)  
If you don't give it to me I'll die  
(Ahhhhhh)  
  
[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]  
She so fine it'll make you cry  
Make you smile, even make you lie  
Make me cum and I don't know why  
Got me acting dumb and I don't know why  
Some say I'm sprung and I'm young  
And I'm dumb, full of cum  
I'm a fiend, you the drug  
I'm high  
Baby so fly, [?]  
Baby drive,  
I'm too drunk to drive  
Sliding down Ocean Drive  
Driving a Lambo like New Jersey [?]  
There's two freaks inside  
Pull up in a [?] suicide  
I propose a toast  
Got a bitch so bad I wanna boast  
"Bae let's get sum to smoke"  
Everywhere I go my youngin wanna go  
She wanna go  
The hoes with the most from coast to coast  
A whole brick just a host  
Baby let's elope  
I buy you a stone bigger than a cantaloupe  
Girl you dope as cancer smoke  
And I think I'm a overdose  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]  
I'll be a lie, if didn't say that you fly  
And I ain't lying  
Louie carrier, carry on bag,  
When we flying  
I'm supplying all this shit I'm buying  
I can keep you high  
Private jet, I'm passing Kush out to the pilot when we flying  
Ferrari jet, you my copilot when I wanna drive  
I do the [?], then you do the [?]  
Let's take a ride  
You got that wet wet  
That water slide, and I wanna slide  
We smoking jet fuel  
The Kush came in darker this time  
[?]  
And hit from behind  
And damage the [?]  
And she came and I came in  
That's perfect time  
That pussy wet, man it's too wet  
It got me sliding  
I'm a vet  
Got a a mean chick  
But shawty riding
