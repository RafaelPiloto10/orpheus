(Do you love me? Do you love me?)  
In the still of the night, as I gaze from my window,  
At the moon in it's flight, my thoughts all stray to you  
  
In the still of the night, while the world is in slumber,  
Oh the times without number, Darling when I say to you,  
"Do you love me, as I love you?  
Are you my life to be, my dreams come true? ( Will you be my dream come true?)  
Or, will this dream of mine fade out of sight?"  
Like the moon growing dim, on the rim of the hill,  
In the chill, still of the night (Do you love me?)  
  
(Do you love me?)
