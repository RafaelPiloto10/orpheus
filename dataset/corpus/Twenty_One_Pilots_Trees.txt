I know  
Where you stand  
Silent  
In the trees  
And that's  
Where I am  
Silent  
In the trees  
  
Why won't you speak?  
Where I happen to be  
Silent  
In the trees  
Standing cowardly  
  
I can feel your breath  
I can feel my death  
I want to know you  
I want to see  
I want to say  
Hello  
Hello  
Hello  
Hello  
  
I know  
Where you stand  
Silent  
In the trees  
And that's  
Where I am  
Silent  
In the trees  
  
Why won't you speak?  
Where I happen to be  
Silent  
In the trees  
Standing cowardly  
  
I can feel your breath  
I can feel my death  
I want to know you  
I want to see  
I want to say  
Hello  
Hello  
Hello  
Hello
