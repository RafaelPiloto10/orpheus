Monday morning and you tell me:  
Waking up beside you is living in style  
I feel the sun caressing, softly through the shades, and  
For no particular reason, I think I' m gonna smile!  
  
Wake up, sweety, wake up!  
(That' s just what you tell me)  
Sleepy, sleepyhead,  
Your eyes are still afloat  
And the radio carries on in the holy language  
About a million traffic jams from Rishon to Ganot  
  
There' s a little song playing as the day begins  
Bright and clear  
Any minute now the news  
God I hope today well hear  
Good morning, good morning, yeah..  
  
Listen, I' ve decided  
(That' s just what you tell me)  
Both of us are going, but not to work, hurrah!  
We could check the water level of the sea of Galilee  
Or make a run for chocolate-milk  
Down in Yotvata  
  
There' s a little song playing as the day begins  
Bright and clear  
Any minute now the news  
God I hope today well hear  
Good morning, good morning  
  
Let' s take the dusty charade  
Our heartache and longing still stuck on her glass  
We can take it slowly, for history' s before us  
What good would it do us to speed by the past?  
  
There' s a little song playing as the day begins  
Bright and clear  
Any minute now the news  
God I hope today well hear  
Good morning, good morning, yeah!  
Good morning!
