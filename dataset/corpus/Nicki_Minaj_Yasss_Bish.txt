Me I'm just me  
Me I'm just real  
Me I'm that bitch  
That be footing the bill  
Only a real nigga could cop a feel  
Credit Card blacker than that nigga Seal  
24 million I brokered a deal  
Jewish my lawyer he Kosher than Dill  
And I am still, poppin' them pills  
I don't give a fuck how you bitches feel  
Jealousy, jealousy that's how you feel?  
I am still living in Beverly Hills  
Tell 'em to chill  
Tell 'em to chill  
Tell all them people my wrists is on chill  
Bitches can't beat me they ain't got the skill  
Eye of the tiger they ain't got the kill  
Look up to Jada I love her and Will  
Bitches my sons but they ain't in my will  
The fuck be wrong with these bitches?  
The fuck be wrong with these niggas?

Tell 'em give a bad bitch a proper due  
What they say ain't never what they gon' do  
It say 250 on that fucking sticker  
Pink Print hot should be in some slippers  
  
I don't fuck with you niggas  
I own the Clippers  
I own some homes  
I own my own liquor  
Bitches is bitter  
My titties is bigger  
You bitches my sons I need a babysitter  
I am the dream, on the dream team  
I am Olajuwon I am Hakeem  
Abdul Jabbar, I am Kareem  
I am the Queen because I'm a machine  
You not ready, you not seasoned  
Go against me I say "Fix it Jesus"  
Thinking they hot, talk shit a lot  
But when they shit drop I say "Fix it Jesus"  
Oh, your shit ain't gold!  
Word to my bank roll  
Real niggas ain't sold  
Dropping my single in two weeks  
The Pink Print album a movie  
Bitches be thinkin' they hot  
But these bitches be using that term so loosely
