They say the neon lights are bright on Broadway  
They say there's always magic in the air  
But when you're walking down that street  
And you ain't had enough to eat  
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere  
  
They say the girls are something else on Broadway  
But looking at them just gives me the blues  
Cause how ya gonna make some time  
When all you got is one thin dime?  
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes  
  
Ha! They say that I won't last too long on Broadway  
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home, they all say  
But oh! They're dead wrong, I know they are  
Cause I can play this here guitar  
And I won't quit till I'm a star on Broadway  
  
Oh, they're dead wrong, I know they are  
Cause I can play this here guitar  
And I won't quit till I'm a star on Broadway (on Broadway)  
On Broadway (on Broadway)
