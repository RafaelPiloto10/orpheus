I'm every man here in disguise  
Lie cheat and give you a spoonful of lies  
I'm a high toned mother with an axe to grind  
Come a little closer honey, see what you find  
Your worst nightmares all rolled in one  
I'll find you sure as the rising sun  
Don't make a noise it's understood  
'Cause this ain't no story like red riding hood  
I'm your back door man, I'm your back door man oh yeah  
I'm your back door man, come on babe  
And I'll take you where I can  
Systematically I choose at will  
But with you there's an obscene thrill  
It's funny now how you can't say no  
It's the smell of fear that you love so  
I'm your back door man, I'm your back door man, oh yeah,  
I'm your back door man baby, Just take it where you can  
This first kiss has a touch of ice  
Now how's that feel, it ain't so nice  
Blackhearted mamma I've something new  
Oh Lord look what I've turned into  
  
I'm your back door man, I'm your back door man  
I'm your back door man, I'm your back door man
