(repeat 2X)  
The weak or the strong  
Who got it goin on  
You're Dead Wrong  
  
(Verse One)  
  
Relax and take note  
While I take totes of the marijuana smoke  
Throw you in choke  
Gun smoke gun smoke  
Biggie Smalls for mayor  
The rap slayer the hooker layer  
Muthafucka say your prayers  
(Hail Mary full of grace)  
Smack the bitch in her face  
Take her Gucci bag and the North Face off her back  
Jab her if she act  
Funny wit the money  
Oh you got me mistakin honey  
I don't wanna rap ya  
I just want the paper  
The Visa capisha  
I'm out like the vapors  
Who's the one the call mister macho  
The head honcho  
Swift fist like camacho  
I got so  
Much style I should be down wit the stylistics  
Make up to break up  
Niggas need to wake up  
Smell the indonesia beat you to a ceasure  
Then fuck your mom hit them skins to amnesia  
She don't remember shit just the two hits  
Her hittin the floor and me hittin the clit  
Suckin on her tit  
Had the hooker beggin for the dick  
And your moms ain't ugly love my dick got rock quick  
I guess I was a combination of House of Pain and Bobby Brown  
I was humpin around and jumpin around  
Jacked her then I asked her who's the man  
She said B-I-G then I bust in her E-Y-E  
  
Yo Big your dead wrong  
(I don't care what nobody say)  
Your dead wrong  
(I don't care what nobody say)  
Your dead wrong  
(I don't care what nobody say)  
We gotta do things right  
  
(X2)  
The weak or the strong  
Who got it goin on  
You're dead wrong  
  
(Verse Two)  
  
The pain I inflict  
Like a convict  
????????????????? vigor  
Jump in my Acura Vigor after I stick ya  
Rip ya like razor straight up henny wit no chasa  
Watch me erase ya misplace ya  
Put ya in the back wit the derelects  
Yeah I pop plenty shit  
Chump i'm makin hits  
No time for that crack rockin shit  
Took you to another level  
Now i'm gettin crazy pates  
Gettin paid from the devil  
Another amatuer tryna damage the pedigree  
Of the B-I-G-G-I-E you know it's me  
Hoes I thought you knew i'm smooth as a baby's ass  
Smooth as Teddy Pentergras  
Smoke the grass get in ya ass  
The Brooklyn born teflon don  
Reckin shop  
Gettin props provin nobody drops  
Words as potent as the blunt smokin Bed Stuy bandit  
And niggas just can't understand it  
I bust a cap for my brothers in Nappmack,Comstock,and Clinton  
You know my shit is hittin  
Yeah ya'll the fly nigga Biggie Smalls  
Kickin flavor make a nigga dig up in they draws  
For the burn that catch your body  
I got styles like karate  
Jujitsu when I hit you  
Then I split you like a cantaloupe  
Hope you gotta rope to hang yourself  
I rhyme for self  
From Brooklyn where else  
Back like a Lexus coop i'll rip your troup  
Not even Lois Lane could get the scoop  
What you think i'm stupid muthafucka  
My crew is mad deep  
I hope you niggas sleep  
  
(Chorus)
