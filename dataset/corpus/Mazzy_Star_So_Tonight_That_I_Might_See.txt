Come up crash with the muses fells dust into ash  
Come so close that I might see the light inside me, I might see  
Let me hold you tight and arms tight and arms you lost your chance  
Come so close that I might see the crash of light come down on me  
With good luck I'll find the dark, stop me now  
Find me to your heart  
Let me hold you tight like rain and sunshine on a rainy day  
See the lights  
Come so close that I might see, see the light come down on me  
Searching like the fresh goes by small like wind refuse to die  
Free me now so I can see the taste of wind who lock me  
Does the wind indeed like me  
Does the wind indeed like me  
With good luck I find the dark stop me now  
Find me to your heart  
Let me hold you tight like rain and sunshine on a rainy day  
Let me hold you tight and arms tight and arms you lost your chance  
Come so close that I might see the crash of light come down on me  
The crash of light come down on me  
The crash of light come down on me  
Let me hold you tight and arms tight and arms you lost your chance  
Come so close that I might see the crash of light come down on me  
With spin luck I'll find the dark stop me now find me to your heart  
The crash of light come down on me  
So tonight the crash goes by  
Small like wind and refuse to die  
The crash of light come down on me  
Come so close that I might see, see the light come down on me  
I hold you tight like rain  
Sunshine on a rainy day  
Sunshine on a rainy day
