Angel, angel  
Don't take your life tonight  
I know they take  
And that they take in turn  
And they give you nothing real  
For yourself in return  
  
But when they've used you  
And they've broken you  
And they've wasted all your money  
And cast your shell aside  
  
And when they've bought you  
And they've sold you  
And they've billed you for the pleasure  
And they've made your parents cry  
I will be here  
Oh, believe me  
will be here  
...believe me  
  
Angel, don't take your life  
Some people have got no pride  
They do not understand  
The urgency of life  
But I love you more than life  
I love you more than life  
I love you more than life  
I love you more than life
