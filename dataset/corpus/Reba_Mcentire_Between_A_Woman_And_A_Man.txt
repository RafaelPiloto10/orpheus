(ruby hice, danny hice)  
  
Some folks say that a mother's love is sweeter than the rest  
When her baby's nestled in her arms and feeding at her breast  
But i can't explain the feeling when you reach and touch my hand  
Because there' nothing like the love between and woman and a man  
  
Chorus:  
It's a miracle from heaven  
That it fills me through and through  
Like a feeling that surrounds us  
Touching me touching you  
When you wrap your love around me it's not hard to understand  
Why there's nothing like the love between and woman and a man  
  
Well the father's love is quiet  
But it's there for all to see  
When a little boy is laughing bouncing on his daddy's knee  
Then those great big hands reach down to tuck his little cowboy in  
But there's nothing like the love between a woman and a man  
Repeat chorus 4 times
