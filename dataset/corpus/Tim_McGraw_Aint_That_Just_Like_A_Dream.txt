I popped the clutch on that old red ford  
Her daddy would holler and run to the door  
Dust would fly as we flew down that old gravel driveway  
And lookin' back I can't believe he let her run with a boy like me  
He said "you better get her back by ten or there'll be hell to pay"  
I can still feel her lips on mine  
It's all so real but lost in time  
  
Ain't that just like a dream  
Runnin' wild and runnin' free  
We were rebels chasin' time against the wind  
Sometimes I long for just one night  
Of the way I felt back then  
But ain't that just like a dream  
It always ends  
  
Saturday nights we could all be found  
Radios up and our windows rolled down  
Hearts on fire and holdin' hands sights set on forever  
We never thought those days would end we'd never be the same again  
Summer would be the last time we would ever be together  
I never knew I'd wake up some day  
In a brand new world so far away  
  
Ain't that just like a dream  
Runnin' wild and runnin' free  
We were rebels chasin' time against the wind  
Sometimes I long for just one night  
Of the way I felt back then  
But ain't that just like a dream  
It always ends  
Sometimes I long for just one night  
Of the way I felt back then  
But ain't that just like a dream  
It always ends  
Ain't that just like a dream  
It always ends
