Life should be like a game of cards  
You make a mistake  
Shuffle the deck and start over  
It should be just like drivin' in your car  
Get lost and your navigation system  
Gets you closer  
  
But there ain't no handbook  
You're on your own  
Got no instructions  
When it comes to love  
Cause once you do something  
Can't be undone  
Wish I could take back  
Letting you go  
  
If I knew then  
What I know now  
I wouldn't have said  
I don't need you around  
Alone in this bed  
Silence is so loud  
So I would treat you the best  
Baby if I knew then  
What I know now (What I know now)  
What I know now (What I know now)  
What I know now (What I know now)  
Yeah I would treat you the best  
Baby if I knew then  
What I know now  
  
Wish I come with remote controls  
Then I just rewind into  
The time it was better  
It should have a restart button  
So, I could travel right back  
To the day that I met her  
  
But there ain't no handbook  
You're on your own  
Got no instructions  
When it comes to love  
Cause when you do something  
Can't be undone  
Wish I could take back  
Letting you go  
  
If I knew then  
What I know now  
I wouldn't have said  
I don't need you around  
Alone in this bed  
Silence is so loud  
So I would treat you the best  
Baby if I knew then  
What I know now (What I know now)  
What I know now (What I know now)  
What I know now (What I know now)  
Yeah I would treat you the best  
Baby if I knew then  
What I know now  
  
Oh, oh, oh yeah  
Cause there ain't no handbook (handbook)  
You're on your own (your own)  
Got no instructions (instructions)  
When it comes to love (to love)  
See once you do something (you do)  
Can't be undone (undone)  
Wish I could take back  
Letting you go  
  
If I knew then  
What I know now  
I wouldn't have said  
I don't need you around  
Alone in this bed  
Silence is so loud  
So I would treat you the best  
Baby if I knew then  
What I know now (What I know now)  
What I know now (What I know now)  
What I know now (What I know now)  
Yeah I would treat you the best  
Baby if I knew  
  
If I knew then  
What I know now  
I wouldn't have said  
I don't need you around  
Alone in this bed  
Silence is so loud  
So I would treat you the best  
Baby if I knew then  
What I know now (What I know now)  
What I know now (What I know now)  
What I know now (What I know now)  
Yeah I would treat you the best  
Baby if I knew then  
What I know now
