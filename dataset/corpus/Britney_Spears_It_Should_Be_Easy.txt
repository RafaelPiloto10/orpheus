I've been thinking  
Just sitting thinking  
On why I love you  
And all my reasons  
And if I lost you  
Boy, if I lost you  
I'd lose myself  
And I wouldn't feel the way I feel now  
  
You bring me sin  
Yes, you bring me sin  
You make me feel like a million, billion  
I'll let you in  
But don't you break my heart  
Don't you rip me apart  
No, don't you rip me apart  
  
Baby, love, it should be easy  
It shouldn't be complicated  
It should be easy  
I don't know how else to say it  
  
(You don't know how to)  
  
I've got visions  
Boy, I've got visions of me and you  
Happily just living  
Now go there out there  
Them beautiful men  
But you my future  
Baby, you my right now  
If there was a scale from 1 to 10  
Then my love for you is a million, billion  
Boy, I'll love you till the day I'm dead  
So please, don't mess with my head  
Please, don't mess with my head  
  
Baby, love, it should be easy  
It shouldn't be complicated  
It should be easy  
I don't know how else to say it  
  
(You don't know how to)  
  
La da di  
La di da  
It's the only way to love  
La da di  
La di da  
It's the only way to love (To love)  
  
I don't know how, baby love, it should be easy  
It shouldn't be complicated  
It should be easy  
I don't know how else to say it  
  
La da di  
La di da  
It's the only way to love  
La da di  
La di da  
  
(You don't know how to)
