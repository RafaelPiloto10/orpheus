Baby, won't you please come home  
Cause your daddy's all alone  
I have tried in vain  
Never no more to call your name  
  
When you left, you broke my heart  
Because I never thought we'd part  
Every hour in the day you'll hear me say  
Oh, baby come home  
  
Baby won't you please come home  
Cause your daddy's all alone  
I have tried in vain  
Never no more to speak your name  
  
When you left, you broke my heart  
Because I never thought we'd part  
Every hour in the day you'll hear me say  
Oh baby, yeah baby, come on home
