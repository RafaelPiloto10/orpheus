My eyes burn naked,  
My black cold numbers,  
My insecurities,  
My devious nature,  
Make it go away.  
  
My rest between rubber,  
My spider shadow,  
My shattered [shadow] dancer.  
  
Beautiful, broken,  
My crystal fingers.  
Beautiful, broken,  
My crystal fingers.  
  
My glass like rain,  
My illumination,  
My cracks are sliding,  
Shaker, feather,  
Rubber, duster,  
Cold, cold,  
Your fingers, broken.  
  
Beautiful, wonderful,  
Paper flaps,  
How you love,  
Love to love,  
Love and stitch,  
Shaker, rubber, striper.  
  
Beautiful, broken,  
My crystal fingers.  
Beautiful, broken,  
My crystal fingers.
