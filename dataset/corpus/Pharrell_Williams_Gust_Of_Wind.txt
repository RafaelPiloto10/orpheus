My heart is filled, with love and care  
Not an ounce of gas, I would get up there  
The answer's simple  
You lift me up  
The view up here, I see all the stars  
There go Venus, and there go Mars  
Somethin' you been through  
You're from above  
  
Hey, when I first saw you, I got excited  
Tried to keep my composure, tryna hide it  
But I didn't know  
I didn't let go  
Then it occurred to me while tryna fight it  
Just like a kite, you learn to ride it  
But I didn't know  
You're s'posed to let it go  
  
Like a gust of wind  
You hit me off sometimes  
Like a gust of wind  
You push me back every once in a while  
Like a gust of wind  
You remind me there's someone up there  
Who whooshes in  
The air I need to power myself  
  
When I open the window  
I wanna hug you  
'Cause you remind me of the air  
I said yeah  
'Cause when I'm feelin' real low  
I remember I love you  
I put my hands in the air  
And you were there  
  
With your love, I can board the skies  
Finding a way that electrifies, mother's your other  
Cannot stow away  
Telephone winds of the northern sky  
Is the closest thing, and here is why  
'Cause we're color  
You blow me away  
  
I need you, like I'm breathing  
Music umbrellas can make one cover  
Who cares if they don't see you?  
Don't you know that they're the same?  
I need it like I'm breathing  
If you never discover, forever you'll suffer  
Who cares if they don't see you?  
You got until then to learn the way  
  
Like a gust of wind  
You hit me off sometimes  
Like a gust of wind  
You push me back every once in a while  
Like a gust of wind  
You remind me there's someone up there  
Who whooshes in  
The air I need to power myself  
  
When I open the window  
I wanna hug you  
'Cause you remind me of the air  
I said yeah  
'Cause when I'm feelin' real low  
I remember I love you  
I put my hands in the air  
And you were there  
  
When I first saw you, I got excited  
Tried to keep my composure, tryna hide it  
But I didn't know  
I didn't let go  
Then I realized I'm tryna fight it  
Just so they can learn to ride it  
But I didn't know  
I had to let it go
