Your just too good to be true  
Can't take my eyes off of you  
You'd be like heaven to touch  
I want to hold you so much  
At long last love has arrived  
And I thank God I'm alive  
You're just too good to be true  
Can't take my eyes off of you.  
  
Pardon the way that I stare  
There's nothing else to compare  
The site of you leaves me weak  
There are no words left to speak  
But if you feel like I feel  
Please let me know that it's real  
Your just too good to be true  
Can't take my eyes off of you.  
  
I need you baby and if it's quite alright  
I need you baby to warm the lonely nights  
I love you baby trust in me when I say, oh yay  
Oh pretty baby don't let me down I pray  
Oh pretty baby now that I found you stay  
And let me love you love you oh baby.
