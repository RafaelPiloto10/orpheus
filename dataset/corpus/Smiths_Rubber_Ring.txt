A sad fact widely known  
The most impassionate song  
To a lonely soul  
Is so easily outgrown  
But don't forget the songs  
That made you smile  
And the songs that made you cry  
When you lay in awe  
On the bedroom floor  
And said : "Oh, oh, smother me Mother..."  
No...  
Rubber ring, rubber ring, rubber ring, rubber ring  
La...  
  
The passing of time  
And all of its crimes  
Is making me sad again  
The passing of time  
And all of its sickening crimes  
Is making me sad again  
But don't forget the songs  
That made you cry  
And the songs that saved your life  
Yes, you're older now  
And you're a clever swine  
But they were the only ones who ever stood by you  
  
The passing of time leaves empty lives  
Waiting to be filled (the passing...)  
The passing of time  
Leaves empty lives  
Waiting to be filled  
I'm here with the cause  
I'm holding the torch  
In the corner of your room  
Can you hear me?  
And when you're dancing and laughing  
And finally living  
Hear my voice in your head  
And think of me kindly  
No ...  
Rubber ring, rubber ring, rubber ring, rubber ring  
La...  
No...  
Rubber ring, rubber ring, rubber ring, rubber ring  
  
Do you  
Love me like you used to?  
Oh...  
Rubber ring, rubber ring, rubber ring, rubber ring  
La...  
  
You're clever  
Everybody's clever nowadays  
You're clever  
Everybody's clever nowadays  
  
You are sleeping  
You do not want to believe  
You are sleeping  
You do not want to believe  
You are sleeping  
You do not want to believe  
You are sleeping
