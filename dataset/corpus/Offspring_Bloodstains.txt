They can make things worse for me  
Sometimes I'd rather die  
They can tell me tons of things  
But I can't see eye to eye  
Well I know they know the way I think  
I know they always will  
Someday I'm gonna change my mind  
Sometimes I'd rather kill  
  
Bloodstains speed kills  
Fast cars cheap thrills  
Rich girls fine wine  
I've lost my sense  
I've lost control  
I've lost my mind  
  
All things seem so much different now  
The scene hasn't died away  
I haven't got a steady job  
And I've got no place to stay  
Well it's a futuristic modern world  
But things aren't what they seem  
Someday you better wake up  
From this fucked up fantasy  
  
Bloodstains speed kills  
Fast cars cheap thrills  
Rich girls fine wine  
I've lost my sense  
I've lost control  
I've lost my mind  
  
Bloodstains speed kills  
Fast cars cheap thrills  
Rich girls fine wine  
I've lost my sense  
I've lost control  
I've lost my mind
