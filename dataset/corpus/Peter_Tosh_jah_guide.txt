Here though I trod through this valley  
I will fear no evil  
Here though I trod through this valley  
I will fear no evil  
  
'Cause I know  
Jah guide, Jah guide, Jah guide  
Jah guide, Jah guide I through this valley  
And I know he will  
When I'm trodding through this valley  
I know he will  
  
Though my enemies fight me everyday  
I will fear no evil  
Though my enemies set traps in my way  
Still I will fear no evil  
  
'Cause Jah guide, Jah guide, Jah guide  
Jah guide, Jah guide I through this valley  
And I know he will  
When I'm trodding through this valley  
I know he will  
  
Many pretty workers dig pits every day  
But I don't fear no evil  
Oh the pretty workers fight me everyday  
Still I will fear no evil  
  
'Cause Jah guide, Jah guide, Jah guide  
Jah guide, Jah guide I through this valley  
And I know he will  
When I'm trodding through this valley  
I know he will  
  
Pestilence lurks in dark places  
And I fear no evil  
Destruction walk with smiling faces  
Still I will fear no evil  
  
'Cause Jah guide, Jah guide, Jah guide  
Jah guide, Jah guide I through this valley  
And I know he will  
When I'm trodding through this valley  
I know he will  
  
When I'm walking the streets, I know he will  
When I'm smoking my pipe, I know he will  
When I'm trodding the earth, I know he will  
When I'm driving the road, I know he will  
When they dig pits in my way, I know he will  
When they fight me everyday, I know he will  
When they try to keep me down, I know he will
