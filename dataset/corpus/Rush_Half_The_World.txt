Half the world hates  
What half the world does every day  
Half the world waits  
While half gets on with it anyway  
  
Half the world lives  
Half the world makes  
Half the world gives  
While the other half takes  
  
Half the world is  
Half the world was  
Half the world thinks  
While the other half does  
  
Half the world talks  
With half a mind on what they say  
Half the world walks  
With half a mind to run away  
  
Half the world lies  
Half the world learns  
Half the world flies  
As half the world turns  
  
Half the world cries  
Half the world laughs  
Half the world tries  
To be the other half  
  
Half of us divided Like a torn-up photograph, Half of us are  
Trying To reach the other half  
  
Half the world cares  
While half the world is wasting the day  
Half the world shares  
While half the world is stealing away
