I'm gonna suture up my future  
I ain't jaded, I just hate it  
See, I've been down too long  
It's kinda hard to explain  
Gone and buried all I carried  
All my evil through a needle  
As it pulled through the eye what was  
What went on around gone  
  
Don't sweat  
Thread to forget  
To feel like you've already gone on  
To the rest of, the rest of the life that you've got  
Take a picture and bury it all away  
Bury it all away  
  
Tried to fake it, I just can't take it  
I don't care if it hurts  
Just so long as it's real  
I won't waste it, turned to face it  
I'd sharpened a knife, then used it till bone made it dull  
Tried explaining, done explaining  
I got caught in a plant  
Of all this talking at once  
I've been giving my love away  
To the things that tear it apart  
I'm gonna suture up my future  
  
Thread to forget  
To feel like you've already gone on  
To the rest of, the rest of the life that you've got  
Tie the loose ends and bury it all away  
It's like this, it's like this
