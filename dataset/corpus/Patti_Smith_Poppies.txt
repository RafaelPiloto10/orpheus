He's delighted to love me, but you know,  
I just don't know what to say to him. I just don't know.  
  
Heard it on the radio, it's no good  
Heard it on the radio, it's news to me  
When she gets something, it's understood  
Baby's got somethin' she's not used to  
  
Down, down, poppy, yeah  
Down, down, poppy, yeah  
  
Goin' on the corner, I'm gonna score  
Baby wants somethin', she's in the mood to  
Baby wants somethin', I want more  
When I don't get it, I get blue, blue  
  
Down, down, and it's really comin', really comin',  
Down, down, poppy, yeah  
  
Goin' on the corner, I'm gonna score  
Baby's got somethin', gonna get through, through  
When I want somethin' I want more,  
Heard it on the radio, there's nothin' I can do do  
  
I'm in the mood to and I'm a woman and an individual  
And I want rockin' real slow I wanna hear it on the radio  
I wanna hear it, I wanna score (poppies) I wanna hear  
It on the radio baby got it but baby want more  
On the radio, heard it on the radio  
Baby got it but baby want more  
[babble]  
Heard it on the radio won't be no need for layin' in the road  
Tonight I'm goin' out, oh yeah baby got it but baby want more  
She won't need it any more [babble]  
Although she was tense and lean in the sun splintered like a country  
Gently pulled his finger  
Everything is soakin' and spread with butter  
Their flowers on an average [on the seed? ]  
  
And then they laid her on the table  
She connected with the inhaler  
And the needle shiftin' like crazy,  
She was, she was completely still.  
It was like a painting of a vase,  
She just lay there and the gas traveled fast  
Through the dorsal spine and down and around  
(I want more)  
The anal cavity, her cranium  
(I wanna score)  
Just, it was really great, man,  
The gas had inflicted her entire spine  
With the elements of a voluptuous disease  
With a green vapor, made her feet light  
  
Baby want more  
  
Baby was it in the closet.  
Baby get it there, baby tag it,  
Baby got it and baby begged for it, baby  
  
I don't think (after station) there's any station  
(I remember when)  
Quite as interesting to me  
(baby worship something)  
As the 12th station  
(laughin' at the flowers)  
I tuned in (to the tower) too many centuries  
Were calling to me  
And I spin, come down thru time  
Oh, watch them say you're too high  
  
And I swim through  
  
Hear it on the radio, goddamn in my radio,  
Hear it on the radio, hear it on the radio  
[babble]  
One long ecstatic pure sensation  
Restriction started excreting, started excreting, ah exhilarating  
Bottomless pit  
  
Hey sheba, hey salome, hey venus eclipsin' my way ah.  
Her vessel, every woman is a vessel, is evasive, is aquatic.  
Everyone, silver ecstatic, platinum disk spinning
