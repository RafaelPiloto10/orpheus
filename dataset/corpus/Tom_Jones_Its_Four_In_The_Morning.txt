It's four in the morning and once more the dawning  
Just woke up the wanting in me  
Wishin' I'd never met her, knowing if I forget her  
How much better off she would be  
  
The longer I hold on, the longer this goes on  
The harder that it's going to be  
But it's four in the morning and once more the dawning  
Just woke up the wanting in me  
  
I'd never desert her, God knows when I hurt her  
That's the last thing that I want to do  
She tries, but she can't tell how she feels  
But I know, too well, just what she's going through  
  
If I love her so much, I don't know why I can't do  
The right thing and just let her be  
But it's four in the morning and once more the dawning  
Just woke up the wanting in me  
  
Last night I told her, "This time it's all over"  
Making two times I've told her goodbye  
Last night, we broke up, this morning I woke up  
And for the fifth time, I'm changing my mind  
  
I saw more love in her eyes when I left her  
Than most foolish men will ever see  
An' it's four in the morning and once more the dawning  
Just woke up the wanting in me  
  
It's four in the morning and once more the dawning  
Just woke up the wanting in me  
Wishin' I'd never met her
