That I will keep you  
Safe from harm)  
  
(You're all I need  
Humbly, I plead  
Give me your love)  
  
Come vous voulez  
Give me your lips  
Give me your heart  
  
Come vous voulez  
Please tell me now  
We'll never part  
  
Surely you know  
That I will keep you  
Safe from harm
