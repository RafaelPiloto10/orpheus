I love it, love it  
When you touch on me  
And I love it, love it  
Can't be enough for me  
  
I just love it, love it  
When your love is strong  
You see I love it, love it  
The tight that you hold on  
  
I love it, love it  
Girl it could not be any better  
I love it, love it  
I was thinkin' about you  
And trippin' on you  
  
I love it, love it  
Girl it's time we talk in forever  
And I love it, love it  
And I am hooked right here  
Since you came in  
  
I can't believe it  
I don't never get excited  
So how in this world  
Could I end up so delighted?  
  
I'm just hooked on your love  
And I'm takin' it to the street  
And tell the world  
All about you  
  
Let me prove it  
I can do it  
Anything you can ever want it  
Hold on  
  
I don't see why not  
We can give it less than we got  
With our hearts on fire  
Love and desire  
It's gonna take it higher  
  
I love it, love it  
Girl it could not be any better  
I love it, love it  
I was thinkin' about you  
And trippin' on you  
  
I love it, love it  
Girl it's time we talk in forever  
And I love it, love it  
And I am hooked right here  
Since you came in  
  
Let me show you girl  
I wanna know you any way you could ever please  
Hold on  
  
I don't see how we could love endlessly  
With our hearts on fire  
Love and desire  
Will always take it to you  
  
I love it, love it  
Girl it could not be any better  
I love it, love it  
I was thinkin' about you  
And trippin' on you  
  
I love it, love it  
Girl it's time we talk in forever  
And I love it, love it  
And I am hooked right here  
Since you came in
