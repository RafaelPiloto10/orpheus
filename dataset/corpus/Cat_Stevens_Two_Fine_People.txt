Now that I've passed your test  
How can I prove to you baby I'll never let you down  
If I led you around, I'm sorry  
But I never meant to worry you...no  
Now that I've kissed your breast  
How can I prove to you baby I'll never make you sad  
If I ever had , do believe your tears tears won't come back again  
I love you, though the stars may fade  
And mountains turn into sand. I love you  
'Til my body changes into an old man. I love you  
And the song that I sing is the only way that I can explain  
La la la la la la  
You know I wish for you baby nothing but good times ahead  
Anything that heaven can give you, I can give you instead  
La la la la la la  
How could I lie to you baby, I'll never lead you around  
I'll take care of everything you need, darling  
Every little need'll be found. I love you  
Thought the time may change and snowmen sleep in the sea  
And I really only want you to want me. I love you  
And the song that I sing is the only way that I can explain  
Now that you've shown your heart  
I'll be right with you baby, I'll never leave you alone  
Anywhere you want me to be honey, I'll be there to have and to hold  
And now that the clouds roll back, hold on to me baby  
We're going never to land, flying on the power of love  
Flying on the power of love. I love you  
Though time may fade and mountains turn into sand  
I love you, 'til the very same come back to the land  
I love you and the song that I sing is the only way that  
I can explain  
Two fine people should love each other  
Two fine people should help each other
