Wish you were here  
Me oh my country man  
Wish you were here  
  
I wish you were here  
Don't you know the snow is getting colder?  
And I miss you like hell  
And I'm feeling blue  
  
Wish you were here  
Me oh my country man  
Wish you were here  
(Wish you were here)  
  
Wish you were here  
Don't you know the snow is getting colder?  
And I miss you like hell  
And I'm feeling blue  
  
I've got feelings for you  
Do you still feel the same?  
From the first time I laid my eyes on you  
Felt the joy of living  
I saw heaven in your eyes  
In your eyes  
  
Wish you were here  
Me oh my country man  
Wish you were here  
(Wish you here)  
  
I wish you were here  
Don't you know the snow is getting colder?  
And I miss you like hell  
And I'm feeling blue  
  
I miss your laugh  
I miss your smile  
I miss everything about you  
Every second is like a minute  
Every minute's like a day  
When you're far away  
  
(The snow is getting colder and I wish you were here)  
(A battlefield of love and fear, and I wish you were here)  
  
I've got feelings for you  
From the first time I laid my eyes on you  
  
Wish you were here  
Me oh my country man  
Wish you were here  
(Wish you were here)  
  
I wish you were here  
Don't you know the snow is getting colder?  
And I miss you like hell  
And I'm feeling blue  
  
(Wish you were here)  
(I wish you were here)
