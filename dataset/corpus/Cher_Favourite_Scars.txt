Best jump why do we feel we're going nowhere 'less we're falling  
We're not ready to give up until we're crawling  
Don't make it easy on ourselves  
Climbing risk it all if you ain't living you're surviving  
Tell me why you dip you're toes when you could dive in  
Don't be scared to hurt yourself  
Take your heart back off the shelf  
  
Love covers you up in a landslide  
Love pulls you under like a riptide  
Loves when you crash trying to handglide  
Loves when you're running and there's no light  
Love is a song when you've got no defense  
Love is a rock we throw ourselves against  
Love is the healing of a broken heart  
The story behind all of my favorite scars  
All of my favorite scars  
I love my favorite scars  
  
High wire don't look down because below you is a raging fire  
But love is waiting for you on the other side  
We're not easy on ourselves  
So take your heart back off the shelf  
  
Love covers you up in a landslide  
Love pulls you under like a riptide  
Loves when you crash trying to handglide  
Loves when you're running and there's no light  
Love is a song when you've got no defense  
Love is a rock we throw ourselves against  
Love is the healing of a broken heart  
The story behind all of my favorite scars  
All of my favorite scars  
I love my favorite scars
