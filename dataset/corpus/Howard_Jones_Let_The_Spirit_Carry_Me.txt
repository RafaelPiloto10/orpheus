People come together it's time for a union  
C'mon c'mon c'mon lets do it right  
When the darkness takes control and we lose the reason  
C'mon c'mon c'mon lets see the light  
Well let the faith shine down on me and let the spirit carry me  
To a place where the stars don't know your name  
To a town where the children fly  
To a city where love comes naturally  
In a country where devils die  
I want to be there one more time  
When my brain is on the floor I need you to help me  
C'mon c'mon c'mon don't watch me die  
And a friend is someone that you allow to help you  
Carry me back carry me back hear me cry  
Well let the faith shine down on me and let the spirit carry me  
And I dreamt of a love that knows no gain  
And our guilt didn't paralyse  
Men and women and children can walk free  
In the world where our devils die  
I want to be there one more time  
I want to be there one more time, I want to be there one more time  
To a place where the stars don't know you're name  
To a town where the children fly  
To a city where love comes naturally  
In a country where devils die  
I want to be there one more time  
Well let the faith shine down on me and let the spirit carry me
