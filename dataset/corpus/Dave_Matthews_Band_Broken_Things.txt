Sometimes the road is crystal  
And sometimes I feel like I'm losing my mind  
Tell me what it is what you think you're missing  
And I will see what I can find  
  
You want to be so sure of  
Every step you take  
You cant always know what's coming  
You cant always trust the twist of fate  
  
Oh my love my heart is set on you, set on you  
Oh my love my heart is set on you, set on you  
  
Stars shine down from the black  
And we're picking though this broken glass  
Well how could we know that our lives  
Would be so full of beautifully broken things  
  
Oh my love my heart is set on you, set on you  
Oh my love my heart is set on you, set on you  
  
War is the most vulgar madness  
And winters can be so cruel  
You can't always change the way things are  
Like I can't change the way I think of you  
  
Oh my love my heart is set on you, set on you  
Oh my love my heart is set on you, set on you  
Oh my, love my, love my love  
Oh my love my heart is set on you, set on you
