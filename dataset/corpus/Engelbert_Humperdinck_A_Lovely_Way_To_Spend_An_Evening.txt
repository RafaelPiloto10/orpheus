Some like a night at the movies, some like a dance or a show  
Some are content with an evening spent home by the radio  
Some like to live for the moment, some like to just reminisce  
But whenever I have an evening to spend.  
Just give me one like this  
This is a lovely way to spend an evening.  
Can't think of anything I'd rather do  
This is a lovely way to spend an evening, can't think of anyone as lovely as
you  
A casual stroll through a garden.  
A kiss by a lazy lagoon  
Catching a breath of moonlight, humming our favorite tune  
This is a lovely way to spend an evening  
I want to save all my nights and spend them with you  
Catching a breath of moonlight, humming our favorite tune  
This is a lovely way to spend an evening  
I want to save all my nights and spend them with you
