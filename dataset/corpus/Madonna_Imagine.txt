Imagine there's no heaven, it's easy if you try  
No people below us, above it's only sky  
Imagine all the people  
Living for today  
  
Imagine there's no countries, it isn't hard to do  
No need to kill or die for and no religions too  
Imagine all the people  
Living life in peace  
  
You may say I'm a dreamer  
But I'm not the only one  
I hope someday you'll join us  
And the world will live as one  
  
Imagine no possessions I wonder if you can  
No need for greed or hunger a brotherhood of man  
Imagine all the people  
Sharing for the world  
  
You may say I'm a dreamer  
But I'm not the only one  
I hope someday you'll join us  
And the world will live as one  
  
You may say I'm a dreamer  
But I'm not the only one  
Take my hand and join us  
And the world will live, will live as one
