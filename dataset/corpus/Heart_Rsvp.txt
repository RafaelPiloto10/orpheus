I got an invitation for you  
A little temptation for you  
A night in your honor  
A secret rendezvous  
  
I can almost see your face at my door  
I don't want to have to wait anymore  
I know my offer might be long overdue  
Rsvp  
  
It's a private affair  
I just won't believe that you don't care  
Rsvp  
  
Only you and me  
I'll be waiting till you answer me  
Please don't hesitate I'm waiting for you  
You can't have nothing more important to do  
  
Deep in the nighttime  
Hear me talk to you  
Rsvp  
  
It's a private affair  
I just won't believe that you don't care  
Rsvp  
  
Only you and me  
I'll be waiting 'til you answer me  
Rsvp  
  
It's a private affair  
I just won't believe that you don't care  
Rsvp  
  
Only you and me  
I'll be waiting till you answer me
