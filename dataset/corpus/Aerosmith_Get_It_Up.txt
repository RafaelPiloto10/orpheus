Take me on your rocking horse  
Hit the lights and shut your doors.  
Grab your ankles , everyone.  
Ain't my way of having fun.  
Can't give it up, gotta give it up,give it up, c'mon Nancy.  
Can't give it up, get it up, for your fancy.  
Gotta get it up, get it up, c'mon Nancy.  
Can't get it up, gotta get it up, get it up,  
For your fantasies  
My ass don't speculate.  
I'm just your slave, your master's bait.  
And lots of luck into the night.  
Just waitin' for the bright light fright.  
Can't give it up, gotta give it up, get it up, c'mon Nancy.  
Really have a good time  
Really have a good time  
Suckin' up the moonshine.  
Up underneath her clothesline.  
Really have a good time.  
Love me til the sun...  
Can't get it up, gotta get it up,  
Gotta get it up, get it up, c'mon Nancy.  
Can't give it up, gotta get it up, get it up, get it up,  
For your fancy.  
Gotta get it up, get it up, get it up, c'mon Nancy.  
Can't get it up, gotta get it up, get it up,  
Get it up and down and all around.  
Take a ride and paint the town.  
Slow me down and make it fast.  
Scream almost and make it last.  
You know you gotta really have a good time.  
You know your really gonna, really have a good time.  
Suckin' up the moonshine.  
Up underneath the her clothesline.  
You know your really gonna, really have a good time.  
You know you really want to love me till the sun can't get it up. Get it up.
