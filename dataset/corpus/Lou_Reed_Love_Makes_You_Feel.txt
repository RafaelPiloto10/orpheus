Life isn't what is seems, I'm forever drifting into dreams  
Such a sad affair, to always be drifting into air  
  
But it's not what you say or you do  
That makes me feel like I am falling  
It's things that we've both been through  
That makes me feel like I am upside down  
  
And love makes you feel ten foot tall  
Yes, love makes you feel ten foot tall  
  
Just a funny thing, I'm forever drifting into dreams  
Just not the proper thing, to always be drifting into dreams  
  
But it's not what you say or you do  
That makes me feel like I am falling  
It's things that we've both been through  
That makes me feel like I am upside down  
  
And love makes you feel ten foot tall  
Yes, love makes you feel ten foot tall  
  
And it sounds like this
