The rain slammed hard as bars  
It caught me--by surprise  
Mutts of the planet  
And shook me down for alibis  
I'm waiting  
For the keeper to release me  
Debating this sentence  
Biding my time  
In memories  
Of old friends of mine  
  
In daydreams of Birdland  
I see my soul on fire  
Burning up the bandstand  
Next time  
I'll be bigger!  
I'll be better than ever!  
I'll be happily attached  
To my cold hard cash!  
But now Manhattan holds me  
To a chair in the sky  
With the bird in my ears  
And boats in my eyes  
Going by  
  
There are things I wish I'd done  
Some friends I'm gonna miss  
Beautiful lovers  
I never got the chance to kiss  
  
Daydreamin' drugs the pain of living  
Processions of missing  
Lovers and friends  
Fade in and they fade out again  
In these daydreams of rebirth  
I see myself in style  
Raking in what I'm worth  
Next time  
I'll be bigger!  
I'll be better than ever!  
I'll be resurrected royal!  
I'll be rich as standard oil!  
But now, Manhattan holds me  
To a chair in the sky  
With the bird in my ears  
And boats in my eyes  
Going by
