I call you up, you pick up.  
You call my bluff, on the cards of love.  
  
You hold too close, your hands to your chest.  
I can read your eyes, but I confess.  
  
It's lonely far from you, even when you're right by me.  
It's only while I wait for you, to take my hand  
  
Why do I beg like a child for your candy? Why do I come after you like I do?  
I love you. Whatever you are, I swear. You'll be my angel.  
You.  
  
I play my cards as best I can. But I lose my luck when you're not here.  
My darling heart, won't you please give in?  
I may be strong but I want you back again.  
  
When you're not here, oh, it's hard to pretend  
It's all alright again.  
  
When you're not here, love, it's hard to pretend It's all alright, still  
Why do I beg like a child for your candy?  
Why do I run after you like I do? I love you.  
Whatever you are I swear, you'll be my angel.  
You.  
  
Watch the day, count your cards.  
It makes no sense that I'm always losing when you're gone.  
Why do I beg like a child for your candy  
Why do I come after you like I do? I love you.  
Whatever you are I swear, you'll be my angel.  
You.  
When you're gone.
