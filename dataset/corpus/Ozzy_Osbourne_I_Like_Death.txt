Cheese is good  
It makes me smile  
But then I watch it fade away  
And I cry  
And I want to die  
Because I like cheese  
But it's not there anymore  
And I realize  
That I like death  
But not as much as cheese  
  
Chorus: I like death, but not as much as cheese  
I like death, but cheese puts me at ease  
I like death, but cheese is better  
Oh oh oh oh yeah cheese cheese cheese  
  
I saw you yesterday  
I'm so misunderstood  
You don't believe that I like cheese  
As much as I say I do  
You think I like death better  
But your wrong  
Satan told me so  
Satan likes cheese  
We like cheese together  
Me and satan  
Eating cheese  
Feeding each other cheese in the moonlight  
  
[Chorus: X2]  
  
I'm not the kind of person you think I am  
I'm a very cheesey old man  
I like death, but cheese is better  
Oh yeah yeah yeah  
Cheese is the anti-christ  
But not as much as me  
Or satan  
Because he's more anti-christ than me  
And we like cheese  
  
(chorus repeats over and over again and slowly fades intil song ends)
