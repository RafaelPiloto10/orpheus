Under the endless sky  
Beneath a million stars  
Within the course of a lifetime  
How very young we are  
  
As I stumble on this journey  
Along the road to what is real  
I'm not made of steel  
I'm not made of steel  
  
With all the lessons of my learning  
And the strength that I possess  
Still there are mountains I wish I was moving  
That take much more than my best  
  
There are plans beyond my power  
There are dreams beyond my reach  
  
Oh, these eyes deceive the words I speak  
Don't tell the story inside  
So don't believe the face you see  
It's only the face of my pride  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm not made of steel  
I'm not made of stone  
I can't be anything more than I'm made of  
Move heaven and earth on my own  
  
I'm only a man  
Flesh and blood is all I am  
You think I can carry the world on my shoulders  
That don't mean that I can  
I can bend, I can break, I can feel  
I'm not made of steel  
  
They teach you well to wear your armor  
But what you've learned is just a lie  
And there's a price to be paid for denying  
With every tear you never cry  
Don't ever show, don't let them know  
The heart you never reveal  
Don't ask me why, don't make me hide  
The pain you don't think I can feel  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm only a man  
Flesh and blood is all I am  
You think I can carry the world on my shoulders  
That don't mean that I can  
I can bend, I can break, I can feel  
I'm not made of steel  
  
Oh, don't believe the face you see  
It's only the face of my, only the face of my pride  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm only a man  
Flesh and blood is all I am  
You think I can carry the world on my shoulders  
That don't mean that I can  
I'm not made of steel  
I'm not made of stone  
I'm not made of steel  
I'm not made of stone
