Please take a long hard look through your text book  
'Cause I'm history  
When I strap my helmet on I'll be long gone  
Cause I've been dying to leave  
Yeah, I'll ride the range and hide all my loose change  
In my bedroom  
'Cause riding a dirt bike down a turnpike  
Always takes it's toll on me  
  
I've had just about enough  
Of quote, "diamonds in the rough"  
Because my backbone is paper thin  
Get me out of this cavern  
Or I'll cave in (I'll cave in, I'll cave in)  
  
If the bombs go off  
The sun will still be shining (the sun will still be shining)  
Because we've heard it said that every mushroom cloud  
Has a silver lining  
(Though we're always undermining too deep to know)  
Swallow a drop of gravel and blacktop  
'Cause the road tastes like wintergreen  
The wind and the rain smell of oil and octane  
Mixed with stale gasoline  
I'll soak up the sound trying to sleep on the wet ground  
I'll get ten minutes give-or-take  
'Cause I just don't foresee myself getting drowsy  
When cold integrity keeps me wide awake  
  
Get me out of this cavern  
Or I'll cave in (cave in, cave in, cave in, cave in, cave in)  
Get me out of this cavern  
Or I'll cave in  
  
I'll keep my helmet on just in case my head caves in (in case my head caves
in)  
'Cause if my thoughts collapse or my framework snaps  
It'll make a mess like you wouldn't believe  
Tie my handlebars to the stars so I stay on track (so I stay on track)  
And if my intentions stray I'll wrench them away  
Then I'll take my leave and I won't even look back  
  
I won't even look back
