She called up the doctor  
To see what's the matter  
He said: "Come on over."  
  
[Bette]  
I said: "Do I have to?"  
My knees started aching  
My wrists started shakin'  
When the doctor said to me...  
  
"Whoa," he said  
"Oh, my, my, oh, my, my,  
Can you boogie? Can you slide?  
Oh, my, my, oh, my, my,  
You can boogie if you try  
Oh, my, my, oh, my, my,  
You know it's guaranteed to keep you alive."  
  
"Whoa, no, no, no, no, no!  
Now don't make me go!"  
  
[Harlettes]  
The head nurse - she blew in  
Just like a tornado  
When they started dancin'...  
  
[Bette]  
I jumped off the table  
I felt myself reeling  
And as I was healing  
This is what he said to me:  
  
"Ow! Oh, my, my, oh, my, my  
Can you boogie? Can you slide?  
Oh, my, my, oh, my, my  
You can boogie if you try  
Oh, my, my, oh, my, my  
You know it's guaranteed to keep you alive"  
  
[Harlettes]  
Can you boogie?  
  
[Bette]  
Whoa, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my  
Can I boogie? Can I boogie?  
Can I boogie? Can I boogie woogie?  
  
[Harlettes]  
Can you boogie?  
  
[Bette]  
Yes, I can  
Yes, I can  
Yes, I can  
  
[Harlettes]  
Can you boogie?  
  
[Bette]  
Yes, I can  
Yes, I can  
Yes, I can  
  
[Harlettes]  
Can you boogie?  
  
[Bette]  
Yes, I can  
Yes, I can  
Yes, I can  
  
"Can I boogie?  
Can I boogie?  
What kind of asshole question is that?"
