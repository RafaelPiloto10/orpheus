Never thought I'd fall, but now I hear love call  
I'm getting sentimental over you  
Things you say and do, just thrill me through and through  
I'm getting sentimental over you  
  
I thought I was happy, I could live without love  
Now I must admit, love is all I'm thinking of  
Won't you please be kind, and just make up your mind  
That you'll be sweet and gentle, be gentle with me  
Beause I'm sentimental over you
