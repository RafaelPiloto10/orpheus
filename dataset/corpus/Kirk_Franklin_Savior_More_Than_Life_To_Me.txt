Savior more than life to me  
You are the joy and air I breathe  
No other lover shall there be  
That makes my spirit sang  
  
Hold me close  
Don't let me go  
You're the only friend I'll ever know  
That is why I love You so  
More than life to me  
More than life to me  
  
Repeat 3x  
  
More More I've been searching and You are  
  
More More More Yes You are  
  
You are more than life to me Yes You are  
  
That is why I love You so  
  
More than life to me
