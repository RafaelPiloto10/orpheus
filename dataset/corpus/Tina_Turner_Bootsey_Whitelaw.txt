Mama died when I was born  
So all I ever knew was my mom  
I tell you that I, I never ever went to school  
My mama told me all about street rules  
Mama told me everything about  
Not about Mr. Bootsey Whitelaw  
  
He was tall, big and tan  
I tell you he was a hell of a good looking thing  
Between his eyes he had two frown  
He never laugh or play around  
Mama told me everything about  
But not about Mr. Bootsey Whitelaw  
  
Bop along, bop along, bop along, Mr. Bootsey Whitelaw  
Bop along, bop along, bop along, Mr. Bootsey Whitelaw  
Mama told me everything about  
But not about Mr. Bootsey Whitelaw  
  
He lived way up across town  
Women love him, bop around  
Ooh, I loved him right from the start  
I didn't even care if he broke my heart  
Mama told me everything about  
But not about Mr. Bootsey Whitelaw  
  
Sing along, bop along, bop along, Mr. Bootsey Whitelaw  
Sing along, bop along, bop along, Mr. Bootsey Whitelaw  
Mama told me everything about  
But not about Bootsey Whitelaw  
  
I beg and pose along  
'Cause I want him more this time  
Nobody promised me all along  
He told me that he could never be bad along  
And so I smiled mama, what can I do'  
Well, she told me she love Mr. Bootsey too  
  
Bop along, bop along, all along, Mr. Bootsey Whitelaw  
Bop along, bop along, bop along, Mr. Bootsey Whitelaw  
Mama told me everything about  
But not about Mr. Bootsey Whitelaw  
  
[Incomprehensible], bop along, bop along, Mr. Bootsey Whitelaw  
Bop along, bop along, bop along, Mr. Bootsey Whitelaw  
Mama told me everything  
But not about Bootsey Whitelaw
