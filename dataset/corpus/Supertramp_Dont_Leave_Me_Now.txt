Don't leave me now  
Leave me out in the pouring rain  
With my back against the wall  
Don't leave me now  
Don't leave me now  
Leave me out with nowhere to go  
And the shadows start to fall  
Don't leave me now  
Don't leave me now  
Leave me out on this lonely road  
As the wind begins to howl  
Don't leave me now  
Don't leave me now  
All alone on this darkest night  
Feeling old and cold and grey  
Don't leave me now  
  
Don't leave me now  
Leave me holding an empty heart  
As the curtain starts to fall  
Don't leave me now  
Don't leave me now  
All alone in this crazy world  
When I'm old and cold and grey and time is gone
