The bitter taste of rotten fruit is vomit in the mouth  
The taste is sour and is spit upon the ground  
And left to rot, decay and spoil  
Rotten apple forbidden fruit  
Rotten apple forbidden fruit  
  
Repent!!  
Repent!!  
  
Watch the insects eat the rotten apples on the ground  
Watch the insects eat the rotten apples on the ground  
Watch the insects eat the rotten apples on the ground  
Watch the insects eat the rotten apples on the ground  
  
Repent!!  
Repent!!  
  
Watch the insects eat the rotten apples on the ground  
Watch the insects eat the rotten apples on the ground  
Watch the insects eat the rotten apples on the ground  
Watch the insects eat the rotten apples on the ground!  
  
Repent!!  
  
Repent...
