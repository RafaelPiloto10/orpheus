Christmas in the Caribbean  
Snowbirds fill the air  
Christmas in the Caribbean  
Lots of presents everywhere  
We don't live in a hurry  
Send away for mistletoe  
Christmas in the Caribbean  
We got everything but snow.  
  
Lights are glowing in the palm trees  
Stockings hanging from mast  
Santa's riding on a dolphin  
Don't you want to make it  
Don't you want to make it last.  
  
Christmas in the Caribbean  
Snowbirds fill the air  
Christmas in the Caribbean  
Lots of presents everywhere  
We don't live in a hurry  
Send away for mistletoe  
Christmas in the Caribbean  
We got everything but snow.  
  
Sun-tanned children sleeping  
Hoping Santa will come through  
Christmas morning boy they're leaping  
Oh, it's Bubba's Birthday  
Mr Buffett's birthday too!  
  
Christmas in the Caribbean  
Snowbirds fill the air  
Christmas in the Caribbean  
Lots of presents everywhere  
We don't live in a hurry  
Send away for mistletoe  
Christmas in the Caribbean  
We got everything but snow.
