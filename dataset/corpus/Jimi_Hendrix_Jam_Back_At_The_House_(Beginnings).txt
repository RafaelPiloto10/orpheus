Jimi:  
"yeah well a like I said before we only ran up a few numbers so let  
Me try and do this one like we were just jammin' at the house we don't have  
A name for yet it's just like an instrumental so we'll just go along with it.  
It goes somthin' like this."  
  
No lyrics. it's an insturmental like jimi said, but a great instrumental.  
  
Jimi:  
"before we go any further we'd like to say that you all really had a lot of
pashents  
Three days worth. you've prooved to the world what can happen with a little
bit of  
Love and sounds. oh, I left my girlfriend at home I'm sorry. I'd like to do a
thing  
That a new american anthem until we get another on together. this is called
'voodoo  
Child (slight return)'."
