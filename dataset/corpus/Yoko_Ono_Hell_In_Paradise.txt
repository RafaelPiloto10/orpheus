Ah -  
Ah -  
  
This is hell in paradise,  
We're all asleep or paralyzed.  
Why are we scared to verbalize  
Our multicolor dreams?  
  
When will we come to realize,  
We're all stoned or pacified,  
While the boogie men organize  
Their multilevel schemes?  
  
Underqualified for love,  
Overqualified for life,  
Sticking our heads in slime,  
Thinking we're in our prime.  
  
Mesmerized by mythology,  
Hypnotized by ideology,  
Antagonized by reality,  
Vandalized by insanity,  
Desensitized by fraternity,  
Sanitized by policy,  
Jeopardized by lunacy.  
  
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh....  
This is hell!  
Penalized by apathy  
And living in the world of fantasy.  
Dancing on hot coal, waiting for the last call,  
It's adam's ball, eve's call.  
  
Wake up, shake up, check out, work out, speak out,  
Reach out, it's time to, time to, time to,  
To, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to.  
  
This is hell in paradise,  
None of us wish to recognize.  
But do we want them to materialize  
An endangered species?  
  
Mobilize transition,  
With inspiration for life.
