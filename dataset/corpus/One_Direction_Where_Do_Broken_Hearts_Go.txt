[Verse 1: Niall Horan]  
Counted all my mistakes and there's only one  
Standing out from the list of the things I've done  
All the rest of my crimes don't come close  
To the look on your face when I let you go  
So I built you a house from a broken home  
And I wrote you a song with the words you spoke  
It took me some time but I figured out  
How to fix up a heart that I let down  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now I'm searching every lonely place  
Every corner calling out your name  
Tryin to find you but I just don't know  
Where do broken hearts go?  
Where do broken hearts go?  
  
[Verse 2: Liam Payne]  
Yeah, the taste of your lips on the tip of my tongue  
Is at the top of the list of the things I want  
Mind is running in circles of you and me  
Anyone in between is the enemy  
  
[Verse 3: Harry Styles]  
Shadows come with the pain that you're running from  
Love was something you never heard enough  
Yeah it took me some time but I figured out  
How to fix up a heart that I let down  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now I'm searching every lonely place  
Every corner calling out your name  
Tryin to find you but I just don't know  
Where do broken hearts go?  
  
Are you sleeping baby by yourself  
Or are you giving it to someone else  
Tryin to find you but I just don't know  
Where do broken hearts go?  
Where do broken hearts go?  
  
[Bridge: Harry Styles]  
Tell me now, tell me now  
Tell me where you go when you feel afraid  
Tell me now, tell me now  
Tell me will you ever love me again, love me again  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now I'm searching every lonely place  
Every corner calling out your name  
Tryin to find you but I just don't know  
Where do broken hearts go?  
  
Are you sleeping baby by yourself  
Or are you giving it to someone else  
Tryin to find you but I just don't know  
  
(Louis Tomlinson)  
Where do broken hearts go?  
Tell me where you're hiding out  
Where do broken hearts go  
  
Come on baby, cause I need you now  
  
(Louis Tomlinson)  
Where do broken hearts go  
Tell me cause I'm ten feet down  
  
Where do broken hearts go  
Come on baby, come and get me out  
Come on baby, come and get me out  
Come on baby, cause I need you now  
  
Where do broken hearts go  
Where do broken hearts go  
Where do broken hearts go  
Where do broken hearts go
