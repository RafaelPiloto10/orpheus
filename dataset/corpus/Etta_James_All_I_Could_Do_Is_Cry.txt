I heard church bells ringing,  
I heard a choir singing.  
I saw my love walk down the aisle.  
On her finger, he placed a ring, oh, oh.  
  
I saw them holding hands  
She was standing there with my man.  
I heard them promise 'til death do us part.  
Each word was a pain in my heart.  
  
Oh. All I could do, all I could do was cry.  
All I could do was cry.  
I was losing the man that I loved,  
and all I could do was cry.  
  
And now the wedding is over,  
rice has been thrown over their heads.  
For them, life has just begun but mine is at an end  
  
Oh. All I could do, all I could do was cry.  
All I could do was cry.  
I was losing the man that I loved,  
And all I could do was cry.
