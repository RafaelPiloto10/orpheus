I don't care if it takes some time  
I'm gonna make it right  
I'm gonna make it right  
  
Turn the head three hundred and sixty degrees  
Bite the hand that feeds  
I don't care if it tasted like Poisson  
Rip the legs from the thighs  
Feed the prison, open the eyes  
I don't care if it tastes like poison  
I'm gonna feed the prison, feed the prison  
  
Color in the lakes of red  
Pile of bones for my bed  
I'm gonna take some time, I'm gonna take some time  
[mystery scream]  
Feed the prison  
Not a tear will be shed  
The only color is red, red  
I don't care if it takes some time  
I'm gonna make it right, I'm gonna make it right  
Turn the head three hundred and sixty degrees  
Bite the hand that feeds  
I don't care if it tastes like poison  
Feed the prison and open the eyes  
  
Not a tear will be shed  
The only color is red  
I don't care if it tastes like poison  
I'm gonna feed the prison  
I'm gonna feed the prison  
I'm gonna feed it
