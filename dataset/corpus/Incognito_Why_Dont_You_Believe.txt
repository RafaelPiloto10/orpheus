(girl you love, take a chance)  
(give romance let's dance)  
  
  
Stop wondering where  
And wondering when  
Your love and emotion should show  
  
  
Chorus:  
Why don't you believe  
(why don't you believe)  
There is no mystery  
Oh, why can't you see  
(why can't you see)  
It's just for you and me  
  
  
(girl you love, take a chance)  
(give romance let's dance)  
  
  
Let your love desire  
Put time and the place  
All your emotions  
Go flow
