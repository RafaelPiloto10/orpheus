I drove through the park  
And I searched all the bars  
Where I made out with love  
Too many times  
  
It was always so easy to find and unhappy woman  
Till I started looking for mine  
Some beer drinking devil is holding my angel  
And I know what he'll do if he's my kind  
It was always so easy to find an unhappy woman  
Till I started looking for mine  
  
The note on the door  
Said I warned you before  
What I'd do if you cheated  
One more time.  
  
It was always so easy to find and unhappy woman  
Till I started looking for mine  
Some beer drinking devil is holding my angel  
And I know what he'll do if he's my kind  
It was always so easy to find an unhappy woman  
Till I started looking for mine
