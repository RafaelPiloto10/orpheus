Hey there Mr. Taxi Driver  
Take me to the station  
I've been around for too long  
  
You said I lack understanding  
That I don't know right from wrong  
But oh no  
  
There's a road that a man has to take  
There's a road and it's filled with my mistakes  
Ooh baby! Don't misunderstand me  
  
How long will it take  
How long can you wait  
Tell me how long  
When we are living in a world  
Of love's imagination  
  
Senorita plays for the people who bother  
Outside those old department stores  
She's singing out loud for no reason  
About a traveling man she's been hanging around  
But oh no  
  
There's a road that a man has to take  
There's a road and it's filled with my mistakes  
Ooh baby, Don't you misunderstand me  
  
How long will it take  
How long can you wait  
Tell me how long  
When we are living in a world  
Of loves imagination  
  
So I should beg for some forgiveness  
Borrowed time  
'Cause someone else can wait that long again  
If only you'll be leavin'  
Tell me just  
How long
