This is my one chord song  
It's easy to sing along  
'Cause there ain't much in the way it changes  
But sometimes life can be that way.  
  
Yeah, there aint to much  
That I can do with the melody  
'Cause I'm stuck within the confines  
Of the single key of G.  
  
This is my one chord song  
I can't go on too long  
'Cause I've said all I've got to say  
And you probably won't hear this anyway.  
  
Yeah, now here's the same thing  
That you heard 8 bars before  
And if your just like me  
I'm sure that you are bored with this chord.  
  
But if I can make you stop and think  
About the life your living in  
'Cause you and I, we dont have long  
So make the most before it's gone.  
  
'Cause this is my one chord song.  
  
Now I can make it sound  
Like there's another chord  
But you'd be fooled  
'Cause there is only one.  
  
This is my one chord song.  
This is my one chord song.  
  
This is my one chord song...
