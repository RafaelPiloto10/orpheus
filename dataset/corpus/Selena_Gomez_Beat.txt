It's a big bad world but I ain't ashamed to like the lights in my hand  
And the beat in my face  
It's a big bad world but I ain't ashamed to like the lights in my hand  
And the beat in my face  
  
Beat in my face, beat in my face,  
The lights in my hand, and the beat in my face  
  
Beat in my face, beat in my face,  
The lights in my hand, and the beat in my face  
  
Imma make you bend your back  
Oh my god this beat is crack  
When I do this, you do that  
  
I feel like dancing when I hear that sound  
Just wanna do it, eh, just wanna do it, eh  
I feel like dancing when I hear that sound  
Just wanna do it, eh, just wanna do it, eh  
  
It's a big bad world but I ain't ashamed to like the lights in my hand  
And the beat in my face  
It's a big bad world but I ain't ashamed to like the lights in my hand  
And the beat in my face  
  
Beat in my face, beat in my face,  
The lights in my hand, and the beat in my face  
  
Beat in my face, beat in my face,  
The lights in my hand, and the beat in my face  
  
Imma bring the party back  
We gon' blow the thermostat  
When I do this, you do that  
  
I feel like dancing when I hear that sound  
Just wanna do it, eh, just wanna do it, eh  
I feel like dancing when I hear that sound  
Just wanna do it, eh, just wanna do it, eh  
  
It's a big bad world but I ain't ashamed to like the lights in my hand  
And the beat in my face  
It's a big bad world but I ain't ashamed to like the lights in my hand  
And the beat, beat, beat, beat  
  
Automatic, dance-natic, I can't get enough  
I can't get enough, I can't get enough, of that beat in my face  
  
Beat in my face, beat in my face,  
The lights in my hand, and the beat in my face  
Beat in my face, beat in my face,  
The lights in my hand, and the beat in my face
