(Written By Cohen, Performed In "Night Magic")  
  
(Everyone) The whole work holds it's breath again  
The marriage ring it shines  
The billionth trillionth walk begins  
As another world sighs  
  
Sights and best of wishes and  
A silence you can hear  
The vow that breaks the world are spoke  
And the whole world sheds a tear  
  
(Beggar) Out of the joy of your marriage feast  
O brother be good to me  
The way is long and the shrine is far  
Where my weary feet would be  
And feasting is always somewhat sad  
To those outside the door  
Still love is only a dream  
And life itself is hardly more  
  
(Everyone) The human company draws close  
And lends an ear  
The vows that break the world are spoke  
As the whole world sheds a tear  
  
The vows that break the world  
And the whole world sheds a tear
