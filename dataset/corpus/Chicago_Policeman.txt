Everyday he wakes up  
As his bare feet hit the floor  
Grabs a cup of coffee  
Straps his Magnum on once more  
Feeds the cat he lives with  
Since his wife walked out the door  
In nine years he'll retire with a pension  
Everyday he suffers  
'Cause he sees all kinds of pain  
Sometimes feels helpless  
In a world that's gone insane  
Then he wins a battle  
It restores his faith again  
It's only human kindness he is after  
He is a policeman, you know  
All the years and nothing to show  
He is a policeman, you know  
Every night he comes home  
With a sixpack all alone  
Feeds the cat he lives with  
He picks up the telephone  
Needs to talk with someone  
But the only love he's known  
Was lost forever, he is a policeman  
He is a policeman, you know  
All the years and nothing to show  
He is a policeman, you know  
All the years and nothing to show
