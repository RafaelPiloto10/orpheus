We always stick together  
Like we're something made of glue  
And justify the passion  
Saying one is more than two  
  
But if you don't believe the words  
They're surely to come true  
There's one thing that's so obvious  
But it's something you won't do  
  
Because you stand above me  
But I know you don't  
You say you love me  
But I know you won't  
  
We always say we're happy  
  
When you know it's never true  
But I was just so frightened  
Of the things you'd say and do  
  
But if you don't believe the words  
They're surely to come true  
It's starting to be so obvious  
That it's something you won't do  
  
Because you stand above me  
But I know you don't  
You say you love me  
But I know you won't  
  
But if you don't believe the words  
They're surely to come true  
There's one thing that's so obvious  
But it's something you won't do  
  
Because you stand above me  
But I know you don't  
You say you love me  
But I know you won't
