Say yeah, yeah  
(Yeah, yeah)  
Say ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah  
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah)  
Say yeah, yeah  
(Yeah, yeah)  
Say ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah  
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah)  
  
I got a spoonful of sugar  
That I think you'd like  
No, I don't wanna preach  
But I think you might  
Wanna cup  
(Sip it up, sip it up)  
(Sip it up, sip it up, sip it up)  
  
I might be young  
But I know my mind  
I'm sick of being told  
What's wrong or right  
So give it up  
(Give it up, give it up)  
(Give it up, give it up, give it up)  
  
Uh-oh, now there you go  
Out of your comfort zone  
'Cause I'm breaking out  
Not breaking down, down, down, down  
Ain't got nothing to prove  
Walk a mile in my shoes  
I know the one thing that counts  
  
I got the right  
To make up my mind  
Say it loud and clear  
For the whole wide world to hear  
We're marching for love  
So turn up the drum  
Say it loud and clear  
For the whole wide world to hear  
  
Yeah, we must have different shoes on  
We're marching to a different beat  
Yeah!  
So baby put your boots on  
Keep marching to a different beat  
Yeah  
  
Never in the slow lane  
'Cause I like it fast  
No time you waste  
So I keep our feet on the gas  
(I live it up, live it up)  
(Live it up, live it up, live it up)  
  
I might be young  
I know who I am  
So I don't follow like a marching band  
So give it up  
(Give it up, give it up)  
(Give it up, give it up, give it up)  
  
Uh-oh, now there you go  
Out of your comfort zone  
'Cause I'm breaking out  
I'm breaking down, down, down, down  
  
Ain't got nothing to prove  
Walk a mile in my shoes  
I know the one thing that counts  
  
I got the right  
To make up my mind  
Say it loud and clear  
For the whole wide world to hear  
We're marching for love  
So turn up the drum  
Say it loud and clear  
For the whole wide world to hear  
  
Yeah, we must have different shoes on  
We're marching to a different beat  
Yeah!  
So baby put your boots on  
Keep marching to a different beat  
Yeah  
  
I got my head up  
Shoulders back  
I'm doing me  
So they can see  
I'm marching to a different beat  
I take a look in the mirror  
And I like what I see  
So baby, I keep marching  
To a different beat  
  
I got the right  
To make up my mind  
Say it loud and clear  
For the whole wide world to hear  
We're marching so loud  
So turn up the drum  
Say it loud and clear  
For the whole wide world to hear  
  
Yeah, we must have different shoes on  
We're marching to a different beat  
I'm marching to a different beat  
So baby put your boots on  
Keep marching to a different beat  
  
Yeah
