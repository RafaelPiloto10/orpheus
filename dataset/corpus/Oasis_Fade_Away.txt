When I was young  
I thought I had my own key  
I knew exactly  
What I wanted to be  
Now I'm sure  
You've boarded up every door  
  
Lived in a bubble  
Days were never ending  
Was not concerned  
About what life was sending  
Fantasy was real  
Now I know much about the way I feel  
  
I'll paint you the picture  
'Cause I don't think  
You live round here no more  
I've never even seen  
The key to the door  
We only get what we will settle for  
  
While we're living  
The dreams we have as children fade away  
While we're living  
The dreams we have as children fade away  
While we're living  
The dreams we have as children fade away  
While we're living  
The dreams we have as children fade away away away  
They fade away away away  
  
Now my life has turned  
Another corner  
I think it's only best  
That I should warn you  
Dream it while you can  
Maybe someday I'll make you understand  
  
I'll paint you the picture  
'Cause I don't think  
You live round here no more  
I've never even seen  
The key to the door  
We only get what we will settle for  
  
While we're living  
The dreams we have as children fade away  
While we're living  
The dreams we have as children fade away  
While we're living  
The dreams we have as children fade away  
While we're living  
The dreams we have as children fade away away away  
They fade away away away  
They fade away away away  
Fade away away away
