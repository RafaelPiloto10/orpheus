All the king's horses and all the king's men Couldn't put us back together
again.  
We huffed and we puffed  
And we blew this house down.  
Well, we tried.  
Yeah, we tried.  
  
The sticks and the stones  
Were breakin' my bones,  
And the names that were said kinda hurt us.  
Riddle me this and riddle me that.  
What went wrong?  
What went wrong?  
  
When did the sun stop shinin'?  
When did we turn into two divided?  
I guess we will never really know why,  
But I remember once upon a time.  
  
Sometimes I wih upon a star  
To give you a reason to give me your heart.  
Rockaby baby, you rocked me goodbye.  
Tell me why.  
Tell me why.  
  
When did the sun stop shinin'?  
When did we turn into two divided?  
I guess we will never really know why,  
But I remember once upon a time.
