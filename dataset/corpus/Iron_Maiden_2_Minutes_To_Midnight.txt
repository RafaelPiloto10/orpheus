Kill for gain or shoot to maim  
But we don't need a reason  
The Golden Goose is on the loose  
And never out of season  
Some blackened pride still burns inside  
This shell of bloody treason  
Here's my gun for a barrel of fun  
For the love of living death.  
  
[Chorus]  
The killer's breed or the demon's seed,  
The glamour, the fortune, the pain,  
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain,  
But don't you pray for my soul anymore.  
Two minutes to midnight  
The hands that threaten doom.  
Two minutes to midnight  
To kill the unborn in the womb.  
  
The blind men shout let the creatures out  
We'll show the unbelievers  
The napalm screams of human flames  
Of a prime time Belsen feast, yeah!  
As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat and lick the gravy,  
We oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babies.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The body bags and little rags of children torn in two  
And the jellied brains of those who remain to put the finger right on you.  
As the madmen play on words and make us all dance to their song,  
To the tune of starving millions to make a better kind of gun.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Midnight, all night
