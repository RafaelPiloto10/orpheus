I woke up wednesday morning  
Sometime wednesday evening  
Just looking for a piece of something  
Easy to believe  
  
When you live out on the border  
Of everything and nothing  
There's nothing but waking  
And then dreaming  
  
Barely out of tuesday  
No one to receive me  
And nothing is changin  
  
Maybe you could leave a light on  
Maybe you could leave a light on  
Maybe you could leave a light on..  
For me  
Ohh  
Can you see her  
Waiting there,  
Down by the sea?  
  
See look, I know theres a light on  
Theres no one there for me  
Oh if you see me you see me coming home  
Just turn me away  
  
Cause everybody tries to go back somewhere some day  
So just leave a light on  
Everybody tires to go back somewhere some day  
  
Just leave a light on  
For me  
So that I can see  
Just leave a light for me  
So that  
So that  
Maybe I can see  
  
Cause there's a girl in a car out in the parking lot  
And she says man, c'mon,  
Just take a shot  
  
She says  
Can't you see me?  
Can't you see me?  
Can't you see my walls come tumbling down?  
Said can't you see them crumbling down on me?  
Can't you see?  
Can you see?
