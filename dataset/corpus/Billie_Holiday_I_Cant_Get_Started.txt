I've been around the world in a plane  
Settled revolutions in Spain  
The North Pole I have charted  
But can't get started with you  
And at the golf course I'm under par  
Metro-Goldwyn wants me to star  
I've got a house and a show place  
But can't get no place with you  
  
You're so supreme  
The lyrics I write of you  
Dream, dream, day and night of you  
Scheme just for the sight of you  
Baby but what good dose it do  
I've been consulted by Franklin D.  
Even Gabel had me to tea  
But now I'm broken hearted  
Can't get started with you  
  
You're so supreme  
The lyrics I write of you  
Dream, dream, day and night of you  
Scheme just for the sight of you  
But what good does it do  
I've been consulted by Franklin D.  
Even Basic had me to tea  
But now I'm broken hearted  
Can't get started with you
