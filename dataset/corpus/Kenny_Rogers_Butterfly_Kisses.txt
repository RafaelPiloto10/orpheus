There's two things I know for sure  
She was sent here from heaven and she's Daddy's Little Girl  
As I drop to my knees by her bed at night  
She talks to Jesus and I close my eyes  
And I thank God for all of the joy in my life  
Oh, but most of all  
  
  
For butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer  
Sticking little white flowers all up in her hair  
"Walk beside the pony, Daddy,  
It's my first ride"  
"I know the cake looks funny, Daddy,  
But I sure tried"  
Oh, with all that I've done wrong, I must have done something right  
To deserve a hug every morning and butterfly kisses at night  
  
  
Sweet sixteen today  
She's looking like her momma a little more every day  
One part woman, the other part girl  
To perfume and make-up, from ribbons and curls  
Trying her wings out in a great big world  
But I remember  
  
  
Butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer  
Sticking little white flowers all up in her hair  
"You know how much I love you, Daddy,  
But if you don't mind,  
I'm only gonna kiss you on the cheek this time"  
Oh, with all that I've done wrong, I must have done something right  
To deserve her love every morning and butterfly kisses at night  
  
  
All the precious time  
Oh, like the wind the years go by  
Precious butterfly  
Spread your wings and fly  
  
  
She'll change her name today  
She'll make a promise and I'll give her away  
Standing in the brideroom just staring at her  
She asks me what I'm thinking and I said "I'm not sure -  
I just feel like I'm losing my baby girl"  
Then she leaned over and gave me  
  
  
Butterfly kisses with her momma there  
Stickin' little white flowers all up in her hair  
"Walk me down the aisle, Daddy,  
It's just about time"  
"Does my wedding gown look pretty, Daddy?  
Daddy, don't cry!"  
Oh, with all that I've done wrong I must have done something right  
To deserve her love every morning and butterfly kisses  
I couldn't ask God for more, man, this is what love is  
I know I've got to let her go  
But I'll always remember  
Every hug in the morning and butterfly kisses
