HA AZI NO NO  
HA AZI NO KOL SHAW OTI

Oh no one knows  
How many dreams  
I'm crying for you  
Oh no one knows  
How many dreams  
I'm crying for you  
I'm crying for you  
Step by step  
A way of life  
Sorrow by happiness  
Step by step  
Hand by hand  
To the lost Holyland  
  
Oh no one knows  
How many dreams  
I'm crying for you  
Oh no one knows  
How many dreams  
I'm crying for you

Oh no one knows  
How many dreams
