Kept warm by the light of the lantern  
Lost sight of everything tonight  
My presence blackens their pattern  
A pock in the healthy and calm  
  
Their scorn behind your back  
My promise would put them down  
No trace of reverence left  
Immemorial fire in their eyes  
  
I would perish at the given signal  
At the slightest touch from my soul  
Tainted prophet in flesh  
For all the plagued and lost  
  
Dripping sin  
Decision in stalemate  
Dare to feel death at hand  
Surprised me with its voice  
Through the forest came the morn  
  
Across the leafy pathway  
Their deeds smeared in blood  
For all to behold  
The council of the cross  
Must have sensed my coming  
The pest through the air  
With despise for squalor  
Lashing out at the poor  
  
I turned away my eyes  
In pallor escape from the end  
Fading time to leave from here  
And less to fulfill my task  
She would be safe and firm  
Nothing of this is in vain  
Taken away from stifling grace  
And saved from the past
