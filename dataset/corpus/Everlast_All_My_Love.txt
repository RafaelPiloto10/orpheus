Gets all my love (4x)  
Pick up the pace, keep it, freak it  
Can ya keep a secret, so can I  
Why ask why, try Bud dry  
I get fly smokin' a thai, puffin' a blunt  
Tokin' a spliff, stoppin' any crew that tries to rip  
The House of Pain, Cypress Hill, Funkdoobiest  
My girl's on the pill, so I can drill, and not have to kill  
An unborn child cause that's just wild  
I felt the pain, I built the house  
All respect due to Mickey Mouse  
Club, I'm rhymin' on the dub  
Switch off the track so I can shout out my love
