Note: Like "Morei Sky" and a couple of other submitted songs, this is a Grey
Daze song, Chester Bennington's band before Linkin Park..  
  
I want to pick up the pieces, so that  
There's less complication, so that  
There's less conversation, and  
Less aggravation  
  
I want to go out alone, man, so that  
There's less confrontation, and man,  
There's less association, and  
Less company, yeah  
  
I was so frustrated, man, that  
I was all confused, man, and that  
I was disillusioned, and  
sick of your friends  
  
[Chorus:]  
Run, don't walk my way  
Don't look my way  
Cause I don't care, oh, no  
So why are you still here  
Why don't you disappear  
And spin out of my life, oh  
  
Why do we have limitation, and man  
Why do we have limitation, so that  
We don't get very far, and so that  
We don't climb very high  
  
I can't handle the indecision, and  
I can't watch no more television, and  
I won't miss you when you're gone  
Cause I know my life will go on  
  
[Chorus:]
