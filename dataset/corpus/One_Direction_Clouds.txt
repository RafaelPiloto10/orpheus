[Verse 1: Harry Styles]  
I know you say  
That you don't like it complicated  
That we should try to keep it simple  
But love is never ever simple, no  
  
[Verse 2: Louis Tomlinson]  
Someday, you're gonna see the things that I see  
You're gonna want the air that I breathe  
You're gonna wish you never left me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Here we go again  
Another go-round for all of my friends  
Another non-stop, will it ever end  
Here we go again  
Another go-round for all of my friends  
Another non-stop, will it never end  
We're never coming back down  
Yeah, we're looking down on the clouds  
  
[Verse 3: Liam Payne]  
I know you said, that you don't like it complicated  
That you are tired of all the changes  
Well love is always, always changing, oh  
  
[Verse 4: Zayn Malik]  
Someday, you're gonna see the things that I see  
You're gonna want the air that I breathe  
You're gonna wish you never left me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Here we go again  
Another go-round for all of my friends  
Another non-stop, will it ever end  
Here we go again  
Another go-round for all of my friends  
Another non-stop, will it never end  
We're never coming back down  
Yeah, we're looking down on the clouds  
  
[Bridge: Niall Horan x2]  
And we go, and we go, and we go  
And we don't stop  
But we don't, no we don't  
No we don't ever grow up  
  
[Outro: All Members x3]  
Here we go again  
Another go-round for all of my friends  
Another non-stop will it ever end
