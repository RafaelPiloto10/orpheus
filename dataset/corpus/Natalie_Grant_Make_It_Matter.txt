Pack my bags and my regrets,  
Every moment that I've wasted,  
Chasing after my pursuit of happiness,  
Has only left me searching,  
There must be more,  
  
Take my life,  
And lift me up to the sky,  
Take my dreams,  
And help me to fly,  
On the wing of the stability,  
Come re-write the history,  
To which only you are chasing after,  
Take this life and make it matter,  
  
Help me give more than I take,  
And let me see into somebody else's heartache,  
And be the difference love can make,  
My heart is finding out, there's gotta be more  
  
Take my life,  
And lift me up to the sky,  
Take my dreams,  
And help me to fly,  
On the wing of the stability,  
Come re-write the history,  
To which only you are chasing after,  
Take this life and make it matter,  
  
Only one life to live,  
Only one love to give,  
Only one life,  
Only one love,  
So make it matter  
  
Only one life to live,  
Only one love to give,  
Only one life,  
Only one love,  
So make it matter  
  
Only one life,  
Only one love,  
Here's my life,  
Take it, make it matter,  
  
Pack my bags, and my regrets...  
  
Take my life,  
And lift me up to the sky,  
Take my dreams,  
And help me to fly,  
On the wing of the stability,  
Come re-write the history,  
To which only you are chasing after,  
Take this life and make it matter,  
  
Make it, make it, matter,  
  
Only one life,  
Only one love,  
Only one life,  
Only one love,  
Make it matter,  
Make it matter
