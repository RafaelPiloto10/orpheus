Sailin' around, sailin' around, sailin' around,  
I've been out sailin' around again  
I've been sailin' around  
But I can't get back to you.  
Hangin' around, hangin' around, hangin' around  
I've been out hangin' around again  
I've been hangin' around  
But I can't get back to you.  
  
[Chorus]  
So tell where you been so long (sailin' around)  
What have I done so wrong? (sailin' around)  
Well, I'm so glad I finally found you  
I can't wait to put my arms around you  
Sailin' around, but I can't get back to you  
  
Shoppin' around, shoppin' around, shoppin' around,  
I've been shoppin' around again  
I've been shoppin' around  
But I can't get back to you.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sailin' around, sailin' around, sailin' around,  
I've been sailin' around again  
I've been sailin' around but I can't get back to you.  
I've been sailin' around but I can't get back to you.  
I've been sailin' around but I can't get back to you.
