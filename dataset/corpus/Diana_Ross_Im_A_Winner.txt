I roll the dice  
Seven eleven  
You'll either take me down  
Or you'll take me to heaven  
And I'm so glad  
I took the chance on you baby  
I said I'm so glad  
I took the chance on you baby  
My friends all say  
He don't play by the rules  
So listen  
Don't you be no fool  
Don't you know, you're just a beginner  
So look at me now  
I'm a winner  
I'm a winner  
Yes, I am  
She's a winner  
Yeah, yes I am  
She's a winner  
Like a roulette wheel  
Spinning around in my head  
I put my chips on nine  
Gamblin' you'd be mine  
And I'm so glad  
I took a chance on you baby  
Say I'm so glad  
I took the chance on you baby  
My friends all say  
We just don't understand it  
You play this game  
You'll come out empty handed  
'Cause here we arrange her  
And then shortchange her  
But I fooled them, y'all  
I'm a winner  
I'm a winner  
Yes I am  
She's a winner  
Yes I am  
Put that money down  
And put 'dem chips on nine  
I'm a gambling girl  
And I give all I got  
So I am at your love  
And I hit the jackpot  
And I'm so glad  
I took a chance on you baby  
I'm so glad  
I took the chance on you baby  
I'm a winner  
Yes I am  
I'm a winner  
Yes I am
