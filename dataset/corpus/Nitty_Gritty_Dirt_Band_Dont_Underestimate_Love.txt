Baby it's no mystery  
You don't have to tell me  
What you're doing here  
With all the stars in your blue eyes  
Washed away by disappointed tears  
  
You say another love has left you  
Feeling sad and insecure  
You'd like to think that it's all worth it  
But now you're not so sure  
Baby just because it's painful  
It doesn't mean it's real  
Sometimes we're simply desperate  
For something to feel, uh-huh  
Don't underestimate love  
  
It's the same old bedtime story  
The same old dreams of glory  
We all hold on to  
It's all so beautifully tragic  
So painfully romantic  
But so far from the truth  
  
Baby I could slay your dragons  
But I'd rather set them free  
All I'm really asking is a chance to make you see  
There doesn't have to be a struggle  
There doesn't have to be a fight  
Before you taste the victory  
Before you feel it's right, uh-huh  
Don't underestimate love  
  
Oh we all look for love in our lives  
But sometimes all you've gotta do is just open up your eyes  
But does there have to be a reason  
Or does there have to be a storm  
Before we we look for shelter in each others arms  
Baby leave behind this madness  
I'll give you tenderness  
I don't wanna see you have to settle for less, uh-huh  
Don't underestimate love  
Don't underestimate love
