I got up this morning  
And without a word of warning  
I knew for sure I had to change my way  
Dusted my mind to clear it  
My body and my spirit  
But it's okay, I'm gonna start today, hey  
Emotions disappearing  
I call out but you're not here and  
I question why I have this debt to pay  
But I'll do my best believing  
That I'll get that lovin' feeling  
I mean to say, I'm gonna start today  
  
Start today to turn this love around  
I know for sure I'll never let you down baby 'cause  
No longer do I think it's all in your mind  
I get the point and I've got nothing but time  
To be the way I know I really should be  
And find a way for love to rescue me, ooh  
  
I'm gonna start today  
Working on loving you better  
I'm gonna start today  
Working on leaving you never  
I'm gonna start today  
So baby dry your tears away, it's okay  
I'm gonna start today, hey yeah  
  
Still dream of you returning  
My pilot light is burning  
I mention you every time that I pray  
I sleep with one eye open  
'Cause in my heart I'm hoping  
You'll believe what I say  
I'm gonna start today  
And from this moment on  
Even though you'll be gone  
I'm gonna do everything that I say  
I wanna be your best man  
I'll let time do the rest  
And I'll sweep you away  
I'm gonna start today  
  
I am here, but since your love is gone  
The day's so lonely and the night's so long baby 'cause  
I want that love I knew, no less no more  
I want you back the way you loved me before  
'Cause yesterday is how tomorrow should be  
I'll start today if you will rescue me-Ooo  
  
The night's so long, so long without you baby  
And I can't stand it no more  
Come here 'cause I want to prove my love for you baby  
Come back this is where you belong  
  
I'm gonna start today  
Working on it, love has the power  
I'm gonna start today  
I'm working on it every, every, every hour  
I'm gonna start today  
So baby dry those tears away, it's okay  
I'm gonna start today  
  
Start today to turn this love around  
I know for sure I'll never let you down baby 'cause  
No longer do I think it's all in your mind  
I get the point and I've got nothing but time  
To be the way I know I really should be  
And find a way for love to rescue me  
  
Now I know how to make love real  
You don't know how till you know how to feel  
I've been picking up the pieces of my broken past  
But it's okay, your baby's gonna start today
