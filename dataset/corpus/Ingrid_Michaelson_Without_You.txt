I did what I did for you I did what I could  
I did what I don't know how  
You did what you did for you you did what you would  
I don't know I don't know now  
  
My life will grow my love will go  
My life will go, my love will grow  
  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you  
  
Everything moves save for me everything will move  
I just don't know how to know  
But somebody will make me fall somebody will try  
Then I will just go and go  
  
My life will grow my love will go  
My life will go, my love will grow  
  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you  
Go, go, go, just go go go  
Go, go, go, just go go go  
  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you
