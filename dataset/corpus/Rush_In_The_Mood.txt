Aw, hey now, baby,  
Well, I like your smile  
Won't you come and talk to me  
For a little while  
  
Well, you're making me crazy  
The way you roll them eyes  
Won't you come and sit with me  
I'll tell you all my lies  
  
Hey baby, it's a quarter to eight  
I feel I'm in the mood  
Hey baby, the hour is late  
I feel I've got to move  
  
Well, hey now, baby  
Don't you talk so fast  
I'm just trying to make these good times,  
I'm trying to make it last  
  
Every thing's getting hazy  
Now honey, where'd you go?  
I just want to find out, baby  
Where'd you learn what you know?  
  
Hey baby, it's a quarter to eight  
I feel I'm in the mood  
Hey baby, the hour is late  
I feel I've got to move  
  
Well, hey now, baby  
Said, I like your style  
You really got me, baby  
Way down deep inside  
  
Oh, you drive me crazy  
Baby, you're the one  
I just want to rock-and-roll you woman  
Until the night is gone  
  
Hey baby, it's a quarter to eight  
I feel I'm in the mood  
Hey baby, the hour is late  
I feel I've got to move
