I made a rock' n 'roll sin  
When I tried givin' in to  
make money had to turn down low.  
They said, "why be proud, don't play so loud,  
be like us and get a sound that's real thin.  
Wear a polyester suit, act happy look cute,  
get a haircut and buy small gear"  
That's when I turned to them and said,  
"hold it, right there!"  
  
Well it's more to me than just a job,  
and while I'm playin' you won't get robbed.  
Nobody tells a man how to play,  
It just ain't that way hey, hey, hey,  
Can you hear me say  
  
All men play on ten,  
never gonna turn down again.  
All men play on ten,  
never gonna turn down.  
  
I'm jet fuel honey, plug me into 220  
Step back and let my fingers fly  
While I'm burning up my gear  
There's a fire in your ear  
That won't stop until the day you die.  
  
I really put it to the floor when I hear the crowd roar  
Oh it's music to my ears when they scream  
Then I run back to the power rack  
and deck all of my gear.  
  
Well it's more to me than just a job,  
and while I'm playin' you won't get robbed.  
Nobody tells a man how to play,  
It just ain't that way hey, hey, hey,  
can you hear me say
