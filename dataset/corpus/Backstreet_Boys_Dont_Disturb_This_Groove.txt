Ooh that sounds good, why don't you turn that up  
Baby  
  
(Listen) Pay attention are you listening  
Hey you're my favorite girl  
Excuse me for a moment, I'm in another world  
On a mountain, by a fountain, flowers blooming everywhere  
With Venus and with Cupid, the pictures very clear  
  
Chorus:  
Hang the sign up on the door  
I say don't disturb this grove  
All I need is just me and you  
Just a way to say that I'm so into you  
Just someone who understood  
And the feelings so real  
Don't disturb this grove  
  
Erotic whispers for the listener  
Let the music fill the air  
Excuse me for a moment I'm at a loss for words  
By election you're perfection  
And as if these eyes would care  
Your heart is in the right place so don't you go and change  
  
Baby over and over the passion starts again  
And the lollipops and everything with a little taste of sin  
Causing fire and desire in this mortal soul to live  
'Till the angels fall from heaven and the day the earth stands still  
  
Chorus:  
Hang the sign up on the door  
It says don't disturb this grove  
All I need is just me and you  
Just a way to say that I'm so into you  
Just someone who understood  
And the feelings so real  
Don't disturb this grove  
All I need is just me and you  
Cause I want to say that I'm so into you  
Just someone who understood  
And the feelings so real  
Don't disturb this grove  
  
Bridge:  
Close your eyes and let the music put you in the mood  
Oooh baby just lock the door and turn the phone off  
It's time for me and you  
  
Chorus:  
Hang the sign up on the door  
It says don't disturb this grove  
All I need is just me and you  
Just a way to say that I'm so into you  
Just someone who understood  
And the feelings so real  
Don't disturb this grove  
All I need is just me and you  
Cause I want to say that I'm so into you  
Just someone who understood  
And the feelings so real  
Don't disturb this grove  
  
It's the feeling girl (repeat)
