Weather man says it's rainin' again  
Perfect night for stayin' in  
Lookin' at you I don't doubt that it's true  
And did I hear you say  
Baby put on a smile  
Kick your shoes off  
And stay a while  
Well since you asked me to  
I don't mind if I do  
  
That ol' clock can just tick off the wall  
I ain't worried 'bout the time at all  
Long as I'm makin' time with you  
And holdin' you tight  
Dim light  
Opry radio  
I'll whisper baby I love you so  
And since you want me to  
I don't mind if I do  
  
That ol' clock can just tick off the wall  
I ain't worried 'bout the time at all  
Long as I'm makin' time with you  
And holdin' you tight  
Dim light  
Opry radio  
I'll whisper baby I love you so  
And since you want me to  
I don't mind if I do  
  
Just as long as it's you baby  
I don't mind if I do
