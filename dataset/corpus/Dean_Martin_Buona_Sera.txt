Buona sera signorina buona sera  
It is time to say goodnight to Napoli  
Though it's hard for us to whisper buona sera  
With that old moon above the Mediterranean sea  
In the morning signorina we'll go walking  
Where the mountains help the moon come in to sight  
And by the little jewelry shop we'll stop and linger  
In the meantime let me tell you that I love you  
Buona sera signorina kiss me goodnight  
Buona sera signorina kiss me goodnight  
(Buona sera signorina buona sera)  
(It is time to say goodnight to Napoli)  
Though it's hard for us to whisper buona sera  
With that old moon above the Mediterranean sea  
In the morning signorina we'll go walking  
Where the mountains help the moon come in to sight  
And by the little jewelry shop we'll stop and linger  
And in the meantime I buy a wedding ring for your finger  
Buona sera signorina kiss me goodnight  
Buona sera signorina kiss me goodnight
