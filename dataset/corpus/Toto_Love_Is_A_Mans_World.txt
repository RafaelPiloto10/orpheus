Don't you know that the girl left a long time ago  
And I find that she took half the blood that I own  
And it pains me to think about wasting way the years  
So I'll just wash this dirty whiskey glass with my tears  
  
Love is a man's world  
Love is a man's world  
Love is a man's world  
  
It's a crime the way we've been treatin' each other  
And a maze in between the real me and the lover  
I'm tired of believing that I lost all my senses  
I never though my imaginary dream would be so expensive  
  
Love is a man's world  
Love is a man's world  
Love is a man's world  
  
Love is a man's world (etc fade)
