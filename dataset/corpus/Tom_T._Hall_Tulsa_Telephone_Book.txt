Have you read any good telephone books lately?  
If you ain't then let me recommend one  
I've already read that Tulsa telephone book through thirteen times  
If you don't know any last names it ain't much fun  
  
Readin' that Tulsa telephone book, can drive a guy insane  
Especially if that girl you're lookin' for has no last name  
I gotta find her and tell her, I don't want our love to end  
So I'm readin' that Tulsa telephone book again  
  
Well, I was in Tulsa and didn't have anything goin'  
She lived in Tulsa and didn't have anything on  
She said, "My name is Shirley," and I said, "My name is T."  
I woke up the next mornin' and she was gone  
  
All of the Tulsa operators know my voice now  
And they gotta know how long I've been alone  
If you meet a girl named Shirley with some ribbons in her hair  
Would you tell her that she's wanted on the phone  
  
Readin' that Tulsa telephone book, can drive a guy insane  
Especially if that girl you're lookin' for has no last name  
I gotta find her and tell her, I don't want our love to end  
So I'm readin' that Tulsa telephone book again  
  
I'm readin' that Tulsa telephone book again
