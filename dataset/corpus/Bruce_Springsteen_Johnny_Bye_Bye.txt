Well she drew out all her money from the southern trust  
And put her little boy on the greyhound bus  
Leaving memphis with a guitar in his hand  
With a one way ticket to the promised land  
Hey little girl with the red dress on  
There's party tonight down in memphis down  
I'll be going down there if you need a ride  
The man on the radio says elvis presley's died  
We drove to memphis the sky was hard and black  
Up over the ridge came a white cadillac  
They drawed out all his money and they laid him in the back  
A woman cried from the roadside "oh he's gone, he's gone"  
They found him slumped up against the drain  
With a whole lotta trouble running through his veins  
Bye bye johnny  
Johnny bye bye  
You didn't have to die  
You didn't have to die
