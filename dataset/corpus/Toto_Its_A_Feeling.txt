It's a feeling, I don't belong here  
But a man's on the outside looking in, wondering who's in his old armchair  
  
It's a feeling, you never belonged to me  
First you're on the up 'n up, I only look down and see  
Only look down and see  
  
You're fighting me, you knew me, all desires  
No lock or key can hide the truth you're keeping from me  
  
You're fighting me, you knew me, all desires  
No lock or key can hide the truth you're keeping from me  
  
It's a feeling
