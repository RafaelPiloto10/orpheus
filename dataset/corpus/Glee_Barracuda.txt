So this ain't the end, I saw you again today  
Had to turn my heart away  
You smiled like the Sun, kisses for everyone  
And tales, it never fails!  
  
You lying so low in the weeds  
Bet you gonna ambush me  
You'd have me down, down, down to my knees  
Wouldn't you, Barracuda?  
  
Back over time when we were all trying for free  
Met up with porpoise and me  
No right no wrong you're selling a song, a name  
Whisper game  
  
If the real thing don't do the trick  
You better make up something quick  
You gonna burn it out to the wick  
Aren't you, Barracuda?  
  
"Sell me sell you" the porpoise said  
Dive down deep to save my head  
You, I think you got the blues too.  
  
All that night and all the next  
Swam without looking back  
Made for the western pools, silly fools!
