Wake up everybody  
Take a good look around  
There's far too many reasons  
For all the troubles goin' down.  
Jesus is watchin',  
And the devil is alive.  
Buddha is cryin',  
And Allah is mystified.  
Brothers killin' brothers,  
And our children in the streets.  
We gotta change the times  
We gotta change the times.  
The world is watchin', just look at the shape we're in.  
There ain't no doubt about it, people gotta love again.  
Down on every corner  
We got children sellin' dope.  
Who's gonna send a message  
And try to give 'em hope.  
Jesus is watchin',  
And the devil is alive.  
Buddha is cryin',  
And Allah is mystified.  
Brothers killin' brothers,  
And our children in the streets.  
We gotta change the times  
We gotta change the times.  
The world is watchin', just look at the shape we're in.  
There ain't no doubt about it, people gotta love again.  
I said, Oh what a shame when they try to pretend.  
All my brothers and sisters, people gotta love again.  
Can't buy love with a paycheck,  
It means nothin' to a boy and girl.  
You need universal love of all mankind  
To change what's wrong with the world.  
The world is watchin', look at the shape we're in.  
There ain't no doubt about it, people gotta love again.  
I said, Oh what a shame when they try to pretend.  
All my brothers and sisters, people gotta love again.  
The world is watchin', look at the shape we're in.  
There ain't no doubt about it, people gotta love again.  
I said, Oh what a shame when they try to pretend.  
All my brothers and sisters, people gotta love again.
