Chico Fernandez, sleepin' on his gun  
Dreams of Santa Anna  
Fighting in the sun  
Drums so loud from both sides  
Makes it hard to dream  
A bluish fall on an orange fast  
Makes that hard to seems reason  
  
Mornin', calm mornin'  
Ah, Chico's gonna have his share  
Mornin', sad mornin'  
Sad it must be Aahahahahahahahahahaha...  
Mornin', sad mornin'  
Me-xi-ca-an!!!  
  
Seniorita panned in:  
Chico, come-on-home!  
Santa Anna's losing  
You'll be the first to go  
Sam Whosman's laughin'  
Davy Crocket too  
Whenn Anna takes the Alamo  
The first to go is you  
  
Mornin', calm mornin'  
Ah, Chico's gonna have his share  
Mornin', sad mornin'  
Heaven will be there  
Aahahahahahahahahahaha  
Mornin', sad mornin'  
Me-xi-ca-an!!!
