My eyes are closed and I've nothing more to say  
But I was so willing to give it all away  
  
And what a show  
I've loved you all I could  
  
When will I see you  
Is nothing understood?  
  
You thought I was stupid  
But now I stop (stop!) at nothing (I stop at nothing)  
I thought you were better  
But love's gonna take a man  
Yeah love's gonna take a man  
  
Don't say your love is killing me  
You know how much it means to me  
I too have feelings deep inside  
But would not hurt your foolish pride  
  
Heaven only knows  
At your every turn a scandal  
But how's it suit you  
When it's all too much to cope with?  
  
You thought I was nothing  
Before you stepped [stepped] into my life (stepped into my life)  
I thought you were clever  
But love's gonna take a man  
And you haven't got it in you  
  
Don't say your love is killing me  
You know how much it means to me  
I too have feelings deep inside  
But would not hurt your foolish pride  
  
Don't say your love is killing me  
You know how much it means to me  
I too have feelings deep inside  
But would not hurt your foolish pride  
  
Don't say your love is killing me  
You know how much it means to me  
I too have feelings deep inside  
But would not hurt your foolish pride  
  
Don't say your love is killing me  
You know how much it means to me  
I too have feelings deep inside  
But would not hurt your foolish pride  
  
Don't say your love is killing me [Don't say your love]  
You know how much it means to me [Is killing me]  
I too have feelings deep inside  
But would not hurt your foolish pride  
  
Don't say your love is killing me [Don't say your, your love is]  
You know how much it means to me [Your love is killing me]  
I too have feelings deep inside  
But would not hurt your foolish pride
