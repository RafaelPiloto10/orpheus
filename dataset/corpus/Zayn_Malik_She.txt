[Verse 1]  
She puts her spirit in a nightcap  
She always knows where the crowd's at  
She puts her mouth round the cigarette  
I put it out cause she likes that  
She always dance when it's raining  
Hey when's it startin', baby  
She looks at me like she's waiting  
Making time go slow when they show her the table  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Bright lights, but she's fading  
Feels right, she's crazy  
Bright lights, but she's fading  
Feels right, she's crazy  
  
[Chorus]  
She wants somebody to love, to hold her  
She wants somebody to love in the right way  
She wants somebody to love, to kiss her  
She wants somebody to love in the right way  
  
[Verse 2]  
She's crying out that she loves me  
Holding my hands so I won't leave  
Cause baby don't wanna be lonely  
She says "I just want you to hold me"  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Bright lights, but she's fading  
Feels right, she's crazy  
Bright lights, but she's fading  
Feels right, she's crazy  
  
[Chorus]  
She wants somebody to love, to hold her  
She wants somebody to love in the right way  
She wants somebody to love, to kiss her  
She wants somebody to love in the right way  
In the right way, in the right way  
  
[Bridge]  
In the right way, in the, in the right way  
In the right way, in the right way  
In the right way, in the, in the right way  
In the right way, in the right way  
In the right way, in the, in the right way  
In the right way, in the right way  
In the right way, in the, in the right way  
In the right way  
  
[Chorus]  
She wants somebody to love, to hold her  
She wants somebody to love in the right way  
She wants somebody to love, to hold her  
She wants somebody to love in the right way  
She wants somebody to love, to kiss her  
She wants somebody to love in the right way
