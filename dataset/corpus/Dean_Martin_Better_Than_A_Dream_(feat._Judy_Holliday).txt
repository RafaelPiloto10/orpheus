with Judy Holliday  
  
  
  
Judy Holiday:  
  
  
  
So that's what you look like  
  
At last I know  
  
You're better better than a dream  
  
What you are is better far better than a dream  
  
Well I tried to picture your face  
  
But now I see you you're out of this world you're out of this sphere you're
out of that outer space  
  
Better better than a dream  
  
What is real is more ideal than a dream  
  
To see and hear you to be so near you is better better than a dream  
  
  
  
Dean:  
  
  
  
Can this be a dream  
  
Can I still be asleep on the couch there  
  
Can this girl be really here  
  
She seems to know by sheer intuition how I landed in this condition  
  
Or does she know me the way I think the way that I drink the fact that I slept
all year  
  
But it's not a dream 'cause look I've got some words on the paper  
  
Steady boy don't faint or scream  
  
Don't ask who sent you this angel it's better better than a dream
