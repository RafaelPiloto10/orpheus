Life in the city gets all closed in  
When you stand in a crowd all alone  
Wishing that someone would call out your number  
Hoping that someone might phone  
  
Nights in the city can drive you crazy  
There's so very much going on  
Try to get quiet, you'll miss out on something  
Like someone who's looking for  
Someone who's looking...  
  
There, I almost got caught again  
Lost in the night all alone  
With nowhere to hide, crying inside  
A wild heart looking for home  
  
Sleeping without you is always cold  
The nights are so dark and so long  
Dreaming of touching your face in the moonlight  
Filling the silence with song  
  
Living without you the days are endless  
The clock winding steadily down  
Imagining footsteps, your hand at the gatepost  
The wind shuts the open door  
the wind shuts the open...  
There, I almost got caught again  
Lost in the night all alone  
With nowhere to hide, crying inside  
A wild heart looking for home  
  
The songbird, she trembles all day long  
She sings as if her poor heart must break  
Watching the freedom that flies past her window  
Dreaming won't fit in a cage  
  
Fly away songbird, the wind she loves you  
Your prison is forsaken at last  
Follow your dreaming, you're bound up to heaven  
You're reaching for something more  
Reaching for something...  
  
There, I almost got caught again  
Lost in the night all alone  
With nowhere to hide, crying inside  
A wild heart looking for home  
  
There, I thought of your face again  
A vision to have and to hold  
My spirit still sings, I'm flying again  
A wild heart looking for home  
A wild heart looking for home
