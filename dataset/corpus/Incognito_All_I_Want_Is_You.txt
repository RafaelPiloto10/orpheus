Used to be too carefree  
I wish that I knew then what I know now  
Cos I wasn't on the ground the first time around  
So caught up in me that I missed you baby  
  
No there's no forgetting, everyday regretting  
All I think about is you, it drives me crazy  
  
I want you (All I want is you baby)  
All I want is you  
I want you (All I want is you)  
  
Thinkin' about Sunday walks with you baby and bedroom talks  
My imagination's wild, takes over me  
Let's go on a ride, find a place to hide  
I know, no one does it better than you baby  
  
No there's no forgetting, everyday regretting  
Oh when I think about is you, drivin' me crazy  
  
I want you (All I want is you baby)  
All I want is you  
I want you (All I want is you)  
I want you (Yes you know what I want baby)  
All I want is you  
I want you (All I want is you)  
  
No there's no forgetting, everyday regretting  
(No there's no forgetting)  
  
I want you (All I want is you baby)  
All I want is you  
I want you (All I want is you)  
  
If I could make time last forever  
I would turn the seconds into years  
And I promise you one thing for sure  
I would spend them all with you  
  
I want you baby yes I do  
All I want is you  
You're all that I want baby  
I want you
