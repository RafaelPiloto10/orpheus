Deliver me  
To the bad I was born  
I'm a sinner in flames  
I was schooled by Lucifier's horn  
And bad religion all along the way  
Play with me  
I won't do you no harm  
No - I ain't been a saint  
If I  
Do the time - then I'll do the crime  
I'll be raising hell in flames  
  
If there's a hell  
Then I'll buy a round  
Cause I'm going anyway  
No don't let  
Five minutes with the Devil fool ya'  
Oh yeah ya' got some hell to pay  
  
Damnation angels  
Yeah I'm going  
Down with the angels  
Into the fire  
Damnation angels  
Yeah I'm going  
Down with the angels  
To the flames I'm bound  
Ooh I'm on the road to hell you see  
The road to terror dome is calling me
