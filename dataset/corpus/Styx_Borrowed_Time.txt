Yeah yeah!  
Don't look now, but here come the eightees!  
  
I was so cool back in sixty-five  
I had it made 'cause I understood what to do to survive  
I had my car, and I made the scene  
Didn't give a damn about no gasoline  
They can go to hell  
My friend we never thought about the world  
And its realities  
The promised land was ours  
We were the Great Society  
  
I'm so confused by the things I read, I need the truth  
But the truth is, I don't know who to believe  
The left say yes, and the right says no  
I'm in between and the more I learn  
Well, the less that I know  
I got to make a show  
  
Livin' high, living fine  
Livin' high on borrowed time  
  
Yes! No!  
Yes! No!  
No! Yes!  
No! Yes!  
  
Faith be with me now  
I'm just a dreamer in a dreamland  
Faith be with me now  
I'm just a dreamer in a dreamland  
  
'Cause we're  
Livin' high  
Livin' fine (You know I'm livin' fine)  
Livin' high (Yes I'm livin' high)  
On borrowed time (On borrowed time)  
Livin' high (Whoohoo!)  
Livin' fine (Ahhh!)  
Livin' high  
On Lake Shore Drive (Midnight ride)  
Livin' high (We're livin' high)  
On Leslie Lane (Let's go back and play it again!)  
Livin' high (We're livin' high)  
On Red Bud Trail (On Red Bud, Red Bud Trail!)  
Livin' high  
On Central Drive (He's on Central Drive!)  
Livin' high (We're livin', livin' high)  
On Prestwick Drive (Catch me on Prestwick Drive  
Livin' high (...gettin' in and drivin' my Mercedes  
Livin' fine (...up and down and up and down - shit! I don't)
