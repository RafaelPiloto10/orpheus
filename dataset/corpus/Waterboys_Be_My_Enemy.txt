Well the dawn is howling and the mainframe shakes  
Feel like I've been sleeping in a cellar full of snakes  
My wings have been clipped my shoes have been stuck with glue  
Well if you'll be my enemy I'll be your enemy too  
  
Now I've got goons on my landing thieves on my trail  
Nazis on my telephone willing me to fail  
They were all sent by someone (obviously well I know it was) you!  
Well if you'll be my enemy I'll be your enemy too  
  
I've a bucketful of Babylon I got a handful of lead  
I'm gonna put them in a gun man point it at your head  
Because you stole all my friends and you gave me the buffalo blues  
Well if you'll be my enemy I'll be my enemy too  
  
Now from the slime on your tongue to the nails on your toes  
From the scales on your skin to the stains on your clothes  
You're gonna have to make me do something that I do not want to do  
But if you'll be my enemy I'll be your enemy too  
  
My hands are tied I'm nailed to the floor  
Feel like I'm knocking on the unknown door  
There's a gun at my back a blade at my throat  
I keep finding hate mail in the pockets of my coat  
Well I've been trying to grow I been cooling my heels  
I've have been working the treadmill I've been working in the fields  
And I can't get to sleep I can't catch my breath  
I can't stop talking and I look like death  
But I will put right this disgrace I will rearrange you  
If you'll be my enemy I'll be your enemy too  
If you'll be my enemy I'll be your enemy too  
Be my enemy!
