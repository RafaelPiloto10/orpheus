It's none of my business  
But if I may  
Remind you of the time  
When you did something you knew was wrong  
It wasn't called a crime  
And I'm not saying that you should give  
A sucker an even break  
I'm talking about the time  
That you were cruel for cruelty's sake  
I'm talking about the time  
That you were cruel for cruelty's sake  
  
[Chorus]  
How you gonna pay for  
How you gonna pay for  
How you gonna pay for the sin?  
How you gonna pay for  
How you gonna pay for  
How you gonna pay for the sin?  
  
Maybe you went and stuck your key  
In somebody else's door  
Maybe you went and helped yourself  
To something that wasn't yours  
Maybe you simply criticized  
Someone you hardly knew  
You ruined part of their life for them  
Part of your own life, too  
  
How you gonna pay for  
How you gonna pay for  
How you gonna pay for the sin?  
How you gonna pay for  
How you gonna pay for  
How you gonna pay for it then?  
  
If and when you feel an ill wind  
Don't be too surprised  
Remember when you should have  
Picked on somebody your own size  
  
[Chorus]  
  
How am I gonna pay for  
How am I gonna pay for  
How am I gonna pay for the sin?
