Back in 1957  
We had to dance a foot apart  
And they hawk-eyed us from the sidelines  
Holding their rulers without a heart  
And so with just a touch of our fingers  
I could make our circuitry explode  
All we ever wanted  
Was just to come in from the cold  
  
Come in  
Come in from the cold  
(we were so young)  
Oh come in  
Come in from the cold  
  
We really thought we had a purpose  
We were so anxious to achieve  
We had hope  
The world held promise  
For a slave to liberty  
Freely I slaved away for something better  
And I was bought and sold  
And all I ever wanted  
Was just to come in from the cold  
  
Come in  
Come in from the cold  
(we were so sure)  
Oh come in  
Come in from the cold  
  
I feel your leg under the table  
Leaning into mine  
I feel renewed  
I feel disabled  
By these bonfires in my spine  
I don't know who the arsonist was  
Which incendiary soul  
But all I ever wanted  
Was just to come in from the cold  
  
Come in  
Come in from the cold  
(you were so warm)  
Oh come in  
Come in from the cold  
  
I am not some stone commission  
Like a statue in a park  
I am flesh and blood and vision  
I am howling in the dark  
Long blue shadows of the jackals  
Are falling on a pay phone by the road  
Oh all they ever wanted  
Was just to come in from the cold  
  
Come in  
Come in from the cold  
(I was so low)  
Oh come in  
Come in from the cold  
  
Is this just vulgar electricity  
Is this the edifying fire  
(it was so pure)  
Does your smile's covert complicity  
Debase as it admires  
(just a flu with a temperature)  
Are you just checking out your mojo  
(oh oh)  
Or am I just fighting off growing old  
(just a high fever)  
All I ever wanted  
Was just to come in from the cold  
  
Come in  
Come in from the cold  
(it was so pure)  
Oh come in  
Come in from the cold  
  
I know we never will be perfect  
Never entirely clear  
(when the moon shines)  
We get hurt and we just panic  
And we strike out  
Out of fear  
(you were only being kind)  
I fear the sentence of this solitude  
200 years on hold  
(for my loving crime)  
Oh and all we ever wanted  
Was just to come in from the cold  
  
Come in  
Come in from the cold  
(when the moon shines)  
Oh come in  
Come in from the cold  
  
When I thought life had some purpose  
Then I thought I had some choice  
(I was running blind)  
And I made some value judgments  
In a self-important voice  
(I was outa line)  
But then absurdity came over me  
And I longed to lose control  
(into no mind)  
Oh all I ever wanted  
Was just to come in from the cold  
  
Come in  
Come in from the cold  
(you were so kind)  
Please come in  
(so kind)  
Come in from the cold  
Come in come in  
Come in from the cold, etc.
