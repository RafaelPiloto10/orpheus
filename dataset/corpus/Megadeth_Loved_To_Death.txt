Your bodies empty now  
As I hold you  
Now gone I miss you  
But I told you  
I remember bad times  
More than good  
There's no coming back  
Even if we could  
I loved you to deth  
If I can't have you  
Than no one will  
And since I won't  
I'll have to kill  
My only love, something  
I've never felt  
Now you've gone to heaven  
And you'll burn in hell  
I loved you to deth  
  
Solo-Mustaine  
  
And now I'm down below  
And what do I see  
You didn't go to heaven  
Your down here with me  
And now coming back,  
Baby, take me, please!  
I really think I would  
If you weren't such a sleaze  
I loved you once before  
You kept me on a string  
I'd rather go without  
Than take what you would bring  
I loved you to deth
