I met a little girl  
She on her way to school  
I met a little girl  
She ain't nobody's fool  
Well, go on baby  
And I'll see you on your way to school  
Got the readin' and a writin' and arithmetic  
Know those teachers 'bout to make you sick  
Now go on baby, don't be nobody's fool  
I'll see you in the mornin' on your way to school  
Well, you know they got you standin' at the head of your class  
And the kids don't like it, try to make you bad  
Go on baby, don't be nobody's fool  
I'll see you in the mornin' on your way to school  
Well, I met a little girl  
She on her way to school  
I met a little girl  
She ain't nobody's fool  
Well, go on baby  
And I'll see you on your way to school
