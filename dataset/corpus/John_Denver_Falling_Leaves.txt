Are  
  
Thank you for this precious day  
These gifts you give to me  
My heart so full of love for you  
Sings praise for all I see  
Oh sing for every mother's child  
For every childhood tear  
Oh sing for all the stars above  
The peace beyond all fear  
  
This is for the refugees  
The ones without a home  
A boat out on the ocean  
A city street alone  
Are they not some dear mother's child  
Are they not you and I  
Are we the ones to bear this shame  
And they this sacrifice  
  
Or are they just like falling leaves  
Who give themselves away  
From dust to dust from seed to shear  
And to another day  
If I could have one wish on earth  
Of all I can conceive  
T'would be to see another spring  
And bless the falling leaves  
  
Thank you for this precious day  
These gifts you give to me  
My heart so full of love for you  
Sings praise for all I see  
Oh sing for every mother's child  
For every childhood tear  
Oh sing for all the stars above  
The peace beyond all fear
