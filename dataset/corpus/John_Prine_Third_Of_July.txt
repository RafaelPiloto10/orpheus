It was the third of july on a cool cloudy sky  
I set in for a storm in the makin'  
I relaxed as I sat up in our three room flat  
While my wife was in the kitchen bakin'  
Thoughts passed through my mind of no special kind  
Like faces that look like the others  
Tomorrow they say is independence day  
And I guess I'll go eat at my brother's  
  
I believe that a thought has just gotten caught  
In a place where words can't surround it  
It concerns the years past and the shadows they cast  
And my path as I walk around it.
