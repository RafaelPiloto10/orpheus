Its not I who sought the novice it's the novice  
Who sought me cook went blind and drank too much  
And fed his guest on angel dust where did the pain start  
When did the symptoms begin where did the  
Start what have the symptoms been?  
  
If my heads been through a windscreen why are all the eyeballs green?  
Take me round the roundabout slow down,  
Don't stop bail out-pull out it was not I who bi  
Sheriff it was the sheriff who bit me by my lamb chops,  
Buttercup what a crucifixion what a crucifixion mean  
  
I was bitten by a horse now  
I'm moving for divorce it took more than one man to change  
Ame to shanghai lily what's a cluckin chicken what's a clucking chicken  
Need where's the clucking chicken where's the clucking chicken been
