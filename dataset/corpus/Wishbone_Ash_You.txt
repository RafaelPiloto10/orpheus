You  
Were looking for somebody new.  
You  
Were looking for someone to help yourself to,  
In the sunset of your long, illustrious career.  
You  
The way you played so hard to get.  
You  
So funny to watch, but you did not forget  
What you were looking for - a star,  
And this was the best one so far.  
  
Now you found your sugar daddy,  
You found your sugar pop.  
We applaud the way you pulled it off,  
The way you came out on top.  
  
You  
Got more than you had bargained for.  
Catch 22 that as you opened  
You closed the door.  
They all thought you were digging for gold and more.  
  
You  
Moved in your bags and said,"I'm here to stay".  
Gossip everywhere about how hard you earned your pay.  
But I just laughed at you and your style  
I hope you're happy for a while.  
  
You  
Oh, I love you for what you are.  
You  
You give it everything  
It's you who are the star  
Of this song.  
Don't get me wrong  
Just stay the way you are.  
  
You.
