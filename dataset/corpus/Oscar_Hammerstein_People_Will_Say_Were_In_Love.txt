  
Gerda  
Why do they think up stories that link my name with yours?  
Why do the neighbors gossip all day behind their doors?  
I know a way to prove what they say is quite untrue  
Here is the gist  
A practical list of don'ts fer you  
  
Don't throw bouquets at me  
Don't please my folks too much  
Don't laugh at my jokes too much  
People will say we're in love  
  
Curly "Laughs at your jokes!"  
  
Don't sigh and gaze at me  
Your sighs are so like mine  
Your eyes musn't glow like mine  
People will say we're in love!  
  
Don't start collecting things  
Give me my rose and my glove  
Sweetheart, they're suspecting things  
  
Unison  
People will say we're in love!  
  
Curly  
Some people claim that you're to blame as much as I  
Why do you take the trouble to bake my favorite pie?  
Grantin' your wish, I carved our initals on that tree  
Just keep a slice of all the advice you give so free  
  
Don't praise my charm too much  
Don't look so vain with me  
Don't stand in the rain with me  
People will say we're in love  
  
Don't take my arm too much  
Don't keep your hand in mine  
Your hand feels so grand in mine  
Unison  
People will say we're in love!  
  
Don't dance all night with me  
'Til the stars fade from above  
  
Unison  
They'll see it's all right with me  
People will say we're in love
