Cats like me and you  
Have got laws  
That they adhere to  
Laws outside the laws  
As laid down  
By those we don't subscribe to  
The world is getting stranger  
But we'll never lose heart  
We can't just wait for the  
Old guard to die  
Before we can  
Make a new start  
  
Bring on the revolution  
(keep the pressure on)  
I want to die for something  
Bring on the revolution  
I want to die for something  
Bring on the revolution  
I want to die for something  
Bring on the revolution  
I don't want to die for nothing  
  
For every freedom fighter  
I want to hold on tighter  
To the hope and will you gave  
You were the brave  
You were the brave  
And one day  
When I hear your children sing  
Freedom will ring  
Freedom!  
  
When we watch the children play  
Remember  
How the privileged classes grew  
And from this day  
We set out  
To undo what won't undo  
Looking for the grand  
In the minute  
Every breath justifies  
Every step that we take  
To remove what the powers that be  
Can't prove  
And the children will  
Understand why  
  
Bring on the revolution  
(keep the pressure on)  
I want to die for something  
Bring on the revolution  
I want to die for something  
Bring on the revolution  
I don't want to die for nothing  
Bring on the revolution  
I want to die for something
