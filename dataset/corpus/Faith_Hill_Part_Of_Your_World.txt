Maybe he's right.  
Maybe there is something wrong with me.  
I just don't see how a world that,  
That makes such wonderful things...could be bad.  
  
Look at this stuff, isn't it neat?  
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?  
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl  
The girl who has everything?  
  
Look at this trove, treasures untold  
How many wonders can one cavern hold?  
Looking around here, you'd think  
Sure, she's got everything  
  
I've got gadgets and gizmos a-plenty  
I've got who's-its and what's-its galore  
You want thing-a-ma-bobs?  
I've got twenty  
But who cares? No big deal  
I want more  
  
I want to be where the people are  
I want to see, want to see 'em dancin'  
Walkin' around on those  
What do you call 'em. Oh, feet  
  
Flippin' your fins, you don't get too far  
Legs are required for jumpin', dancin'  
Stollin' along down the  
What's that word again? Street  
  
Up where they walk, up where they run  
Up where they stay all day in the sun  
Wanderin' free, wish I could be  
Part of that world  
  
What I would give if I could live  
Out of these waters  
What I would pay to spend a day  
Warm on the sand  
  
Betcha on land they understand  
Bet they don't reprimand their daughters  
Bright young women sick of swimmin'  
Ready to stand  
  
And ready to know what the people know  
Ask 'em my questions, get some answers  
What's a fire? And why does it  
What's that word? Burn?  
  
When's it my turn?  
Wouldn't I love, love to explore  
That shore up above, out of the sea  
Wish I could be  
Part of that world
