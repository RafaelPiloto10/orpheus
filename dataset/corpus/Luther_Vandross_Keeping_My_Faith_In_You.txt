I just love how long we've known each other  
And I know you care about me  
But I can't tell just where your life is going  
You've been quite a mystery  
You've got all of these brand new friends  
They keep taking your confidence  
  
But I'm keeping my faith in you  
Deep in my heart of hearts  
You've been worried, puzzled, surrounded by your trouble  
But I'm keeping my faith in you  
  
We all cried when your first bow was taken  
No one could be prouder of you  
But I care more about your heart if it's aching  
If I'm your friend, what else can I do?  
But those people who hang around  
They keep bringing your spirit down  
  
But I'm keeping my faith in you, yeah  
Deep in my heart of hearts  
If anyone can do it  
I know you'll get through it  
So I'm keeping my faith in you  
  
I've known you ever since way back when  
And I know you, you don't want to change, my friend  
But you're under pressure, like no one could imagine  
It's not a good time that you've been having  
But you're a real strong brother, and I know you'll recover  
So I'm keeping my faith in you  
  
Keeping my faith in you  
Deep in my heart of hearts  
If anyone can do it  
I know you'll get through it  
So I'm keeping my faith in you  
  
Keeping my faith in you  
Deep in my heart of hearts  
Keeping my faith in you  
Deep in my heart of hearts  
  
You've been worried, puzzled  
Surrounded by big trouble  
But I'm keeping my faith in you  
  
Keeping my faith in you  
My faith in you  
Keeping my faith in you  
My faith in you  
Keeping my faith in you  
My faith in you
