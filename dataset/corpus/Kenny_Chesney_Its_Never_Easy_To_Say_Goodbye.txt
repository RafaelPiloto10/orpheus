Jimmy climbs on board of that old yellow bus  
It sure looks big in his little eyes  
His mama waves  
As the tears kick up the dust  
It's never easy to say goodbye  
  
Julie Ray in her pearl white wedding gown  
Has found her wings and it's time to fly  
It's all her dad can do to keep from breakin' down  
It's never easy to say goodbye  
  
It ain't easy  
To ever say goodbye  
It ain't easy  
Lettin' go of the ones you love  
But believe me  
We'll meet again by and by  
If not here  
Somewhere up above  
  
I've had friends  
That I lost along the way  
They've been called on down the line  
Though their time was short  
I still think about 'em everyday  
It ain't easy to say goodbye  
  
It ain't easy  
To ever say goodbye  
It ain't easy  
Lettin' go of the ones you love  
But believe me  
We'll meet again by and by  
If not here  
Somewhere up above  
  
The time has come  
To go our separate ways  
And it's alright if you wanna cry  
Though I know we'll meet again someday  
It's never easy to say goodbye  
  
It ain't easy  
To ever say goodbye  
It ain't easy  
Lettin' go of the ones you love  
But believe me  
We'll meet again by and by  
If not here  
Somewhere up above  
  
If not here  
Somewhere up above
