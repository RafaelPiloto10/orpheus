Strangers in the night exchanging glances Wond'ring in the night What were the
chances we'd be sharing love Before the night was through. Something in your
eyes was so inviting, Something in you smile was so exciting, Something in my
heart, Told me I must have you. Strangers in the night, two lonely people We
were strangers in the night Up to the moment When we said our first hello.
Little did we know Love was just a glance away, A warm embracing dance away
and...... Ever since that night we've been together. Lovers at first sight, in
love forever. It turned out so right, For strangers in the night. La da da da
da.......
