If I listened long enough to you  
I'd find a way  
To believe that its all true  
Knowing that you lied straight faced  
While I cried  
Still I look to find a reason to believe  
  
If I gave you time to change my mind  
I'd find a way  
And I'd leave the past behind  
Knowing that you lied straight faced  
While I cried  
Still I look to find a reason to believe  
  
Someone like you  
Makes it hard to live without  
Somebody else  
Someone like you  
Makes it easy to give  
Never thinkin' of myself  
  
If I listened long enough to you  
I'd find a way  
To believe that its all true  
Knowing that you lied straight faced  
While I cried  
Still I looked to find a reason to belie-ie-ieve  
In you...
