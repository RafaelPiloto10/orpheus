I am just a blank sheet of paper  
This fool's about to write you a letter  
To tell you that he's sorry for the way he did you wrong  
To ask for your forgiveness for leaving you alone  
He's been looking down at me, seems like forever  
Takes the top on and off his pen  
It's like he can't decide just what he wants to say  
If he'd just tell the truth, I'd be on my way  
But he just stares at me  
I just stare at him  
He don't know where to start  
To say he doesn't want it to end  
And now it's one hour later  
And I am still a blank sheet of paper  
  
Sunlight is shining through the curtains  
He's almost asleep, pen in hand  
There's a tear in his eye that refuses to fall  
If it would land on me, that would say it all  
But he just stares at me  
I just stare at him  
He don't know where to start  
To say he doesn't want it to end  
And now it's four hours later  
And I am still a blank sheet of paper  
  
And he just stares at me  
I just stare at him  
He don't know where to start  
To say he wants it back again  
And now one broken heart later  
I am still a blank sheet of paper
