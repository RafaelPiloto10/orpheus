Here we come a-wassailing  
Among the leaves so green,  
Here we come a-wand'ring  
So fair to be seen.  
Love and joy come to you,  
And to you your wassail, too,  
And God bless you, and send you  
A Happy New Year,  
And God send you a Happy New Year.  
  
We are not daily beggers  
That beg from door to door,  
But we are neighbors' children  
Whom you have seen before  
Love and joy come to you,  
And to you your wassail, too,  
And God bless you, and send you  
A Happy New Year,  
And God send you a Happy New Year.  
  
Good master and good mistress,  
As you sit beside the fire,  
Pray think of us poor children  
Who wander in the mire.  
Love and joy come to you,  
And to you your wassail, too,  
And God bless you, and send you  
A Happy New Year,  
And God send you a Happy New Year.  
  
We have a little purse  
Made of ratching leather skin
