Hmm... mmm  
Today is, not like, any other day!  
This one is runnin', turn a darker shade of grey!  
What, will, I, have, left (tell me tell me)  
(Somebody tell me now)  
When, this, hard, rain's, gone away  
There is a safe place, that I used to know!  
It's the only place, that I want to go!  
Where, else, could, I (tell me tell me)  
(Somebody tell me now)  
'Til, this, hard, rain's, gone (ah-ah-away)  
  
[Wyclef Jean: x2]  
Grandma, grandpa, mother, father  
Sister, brother, Lord  
Please help the child  
I heard the preacher say it's okay, I heard the preacher say  
I see the airplane  
I hear the engine on the boat  
But y'all can't see me wavin' the flag  
Somebody please wave the flag

What, will, I, have, left (tell me tell me)  
(Somebody tell me now)  
When, this, hard, rain's, gone away  
Today is, not like, any other day!  
So I'm gone, I have to find, my own way  
(People, we gotta find another way!)  
Can, you, tell, me, how  
When, the, hard, rain's, gone (ah-ah-away)  
  
[Wyclef Jean]  
I see them wavin' the flag  
Tell the chopper over here man we wavin' the flag  
I see them wavin' the flag  
Tell the boat over here man we wavin' the flag  
Man I'm wavin' the flag  
Tell the chopper over here man we wavin' the flag  
Man I'm wavin' the flag  
Tell the boat over here man we wavin the flag, wavin the flag, wavin' the flag
