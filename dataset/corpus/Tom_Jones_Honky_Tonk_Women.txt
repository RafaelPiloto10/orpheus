HONKY TONK WOMEN  
WRITERS MICK JAGGER, KEITH RICHARDS  
I met a gin-soaked barroom queen in Memphis, She tried to take me upstairs for
a ride. She had to heave me right across her shoulder, Cause I just can't seem
to drink you off my mind. It's the honky tonk women, That gimme, gimme, gimme
the honky tonk blues. I laid a divorcee in New York City, I had to put up some
kind of a fight. The lady, then she covered me in roses, She blew my nose and
then she blew my mind. It's the honky tonk women, That gimme, gimme, gimme the
honky tonk blues.
