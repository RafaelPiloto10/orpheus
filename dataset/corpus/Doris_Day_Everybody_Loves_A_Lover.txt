Everybody loves a lover  
I'm a lover, everybody loves me  
Anyhow, that's how I feel  
Wow, I feel just like a Pollyanna  
  
I should worry, not for nothin'  
Everybody loves me, yes they do  
And I love everybody  
Since I fell in love with you  
  
Who's the most popular personality?  
I can't help thinkin' it's no one else but me  
Gee, I feel just about ten feet tall, havin' a ball  
Guess ya might call me a Pollyanna
