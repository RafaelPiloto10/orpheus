Well my mama told me, my papa told me too  
Now my mama told me, papa told me too  
Well I shouldn't be here tryin' to sing these railroad blues  
Wish I had listened what my mama said  
Wish I had listened what my mama said  
Well I wouldn't be here tryin' to sleep in this cold iron bed  
Alright  
Well I went to the depot, I'd never got there on time  
Went down to the depot, I'd never got there on time  
Well the train done left, she's a rollin' down the line  
Mister jailer, go away now, don't tell me no lies  
Mister jailer, away, don't tell me no lies  
When my train go down, she's rollin' down the line, down the line  
Well my mama told me, my papa told me too  
Well my mama told me, papa told me too  
Well I shouldn't be here tryin' to sing these railroad blues  
Wish I had listened what my mama said  
Wish I had listened what my mama said  
Well I wouldn't be here tryin' to sleep in this cold iron bed, no, no
