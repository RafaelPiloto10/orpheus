Some people ain't no damn good  
You can't trust 'em, you can't love em  
No good deed goes unpunished  
And I don't mind being their whipping boy  
I've had that pleasure for years and years  
No, no I never was a sinner-tell me what else can I do  
Second best is what you get-till you learn to bend this rules  
Time respects no person-what you lift up must fall  
They're waiting outside-to claim my crumblin' walls  
  
Saw my picture in the paper  
Read the news around my face  
And now some people  
Don't want to treat me the same  
  
When the walls come tumblin' down  
When the walls come crumblin' crumblin'  
When the walls come tumblin' tumblin' down  
  
Some people say I'm obnoxious and lazy  
That I'm uneducated and my opinion means nothin'  
But I know I'm a real good dancer  
Don't need to look over my shoulder to see what I'm after  
Everybody's got their problems-ain't no new news here  
I'm the same old trouble you've been having for years  
Don't confuse the problem with the issue, girl,  
'Cause it's perfectly clear  
  
Just a human desire to have you come near  
Want to put my arms around you  
Feel your breath in my ear  
You can bend me, you can break me  
But you better stand clear  
  
When the walls come tumblin' down  
When the walls come crumblin' crumblin'  
When the walls come tumblin' tumblin' down
