Man I ain't gonna be shit in the morning after drinking that  
  
If I can sell you the American dream,  
I can sell you anything  
  
I got to get out, I'm getting put out of my house  
I got to pack up, my refrigerator and couch  
It's a set up, but the bank wants me out  
Or the L.A.P.D. will smoke me out  
This suggestible weight, it choke me out  
They gave me a loan and I had no clout  
They gave me a house, for me and my spouse  
Call my momma and my aunt,  
Y'all should re-finance,  
I let them dance with the devil,  
Dig their own grave and I gave them the shovel  
Fuck, my daddy built that house  
And when he got drunk he almost killed that house  
Is this the American dream, or the American scheme?  
That got me walking in these American streets?  
Its kinda sad when you have to get a hernia,  
Cause you help your grand mama move her furniture  
  
If I can sell you the American dream,  
I can sell you anything  
  
Look at this maggot, with a stimulus package  
I can give a fuck about a Dow Jones average  
What the fuck you do when your paycheck is average?  
Law abiding citizen turn into a savage,  
Got to feed the children, got to feed the habit  
Fell into a rabbit hole, chasing that rabbit  
Now I'm in wonderland feeling like the Son of Sam  
I'm at your west coast branch, gun in hand  
I'ma feel like superman,  
Walk by the teller, better call the trooper, man  
It's the revenge of the lambs,  
"big bad wolf, we're sick of these scams"  
Sick of these plans, sick of this dance  
Walk into his office took the nine out my pants  
You're not a man, you're a serpent  
Then I pray to God nigga nine get to workin'  
  
I never get the working  
You know I heard they hood robbin',  
Your money or your life and there ain't no stoppin' 'em,  
I never get the working  
You know I heard they hood robbin',  
Your money or your life and there ain't no stoppin' 'em,  
Ain't that a bitch,  
When you got to steal from the poor,  
And give to the rich  
Ain't that a bitch,  
When you got to steal from the poor,  
And give to the rich  
  
Uh, drug dealer M.D.  
Doctor feel good, give you what you need  
In California, prescribe that weed  
Oxycontin and codeine  
Turn your grand mama into a fiend  
And see the cyanide first hit ain't free  
I know you bout to die, but let me see your I.D.  
I know you bout to lie, but can you pay this fee?  
If you can't pay, then please have a seat  
You can't see a doctor but you could see a priest  
We can't save your life until we get some insurance  
Your premium is paid, add that insurance  
I hope you got endurance,  
They got me on hold and I'm under they influence  
Nurse high as a kite,  
In charge with my life,  
And everything is lost,  
Without blue cross  
  
You know I heard they hood robbin',  
Your money or your life and there ain't no stoppin' 'em,  
You know I heard they hood robbin',  
Your money or your life and there ain't no stoppin' 'em,  
Ain't that a bitch,  
When you got to steal from the poor,  
And give to the rich  
Ain't that a bitch,  
When you got to steal from the poor,  
And give to the rich  
  
Whatever you need, we got it for cheap right here baby  
This America, it ain't gon' cost ya nothin'  
But a arm and a leg  
Maybe one of them motherfuckin ears, ha ha  
Don't trip, just put in on ya credit card,  
Put it in ya baby' name, ha ha
