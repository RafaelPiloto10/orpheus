If I didn't love you, I'd hate you  
Watching you play in the bath  
A soap suds stickle back navy  
A scrubbing brush landing craft  
Your skin gets softer and warmer  
I pat you down with a towel  
Tonight it's love by the fire  
My mind goes out on the prowl  
If I, if I, if I, if I, if I  
  
If I didn't love you, I'd hate you  
I'm playing your stereogram  
Singles remind me of kisses  
Albums remind me of plans  
Tonight it's love by the fire  
The wind plays over the coals  
Passionate looks are my fancy  
But you turn the look into stone  
  
If I, if I, if I, if I, if I, if I, if I  
If I didn't love you  
Would you sit and glow by the fire  
If I didn't love you  
Would you make me feel so  
Maybe love me  
Oh if I didn't love you, mmm  
  
If I, if I, if I, if I, if I, if I, if I, if I  
  
If I didn't love you, I'd hate you  
Cocoa mugs sit side by side  
It's time to poke at the fire  
But it's not tonight  
Looks I find  
Taking a bite on a biscuit  
The record jumps on a scratch  
Tonight it's love by the fire  
The door of your love's on the latch  
  
If I, if I, if I, if I, if I, if I, if I  
If I didn't love you  
Would you sit and glow by the fire  
If I didn't love you  
Would you make me feel so  
Maybe love me  
Oh if I didn't love you  
Would you sit and glow by the fire  
If I didn't love you  
Would you make me feel so  
Maybe love me  
Oh if I didn't love you, mmm  
  
If I, if I, if I, if I  
Didn't, didn't, didn't, didn't  
Love you, love you, love you, love you
