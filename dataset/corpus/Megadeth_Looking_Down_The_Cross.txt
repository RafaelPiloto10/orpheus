Now before they take me  
And my blessed life  
Now you'll know why Deth  
Was summoned here tonight  
I'll recall my perils  
They'll kill me in pride  
No, I can't run away  
There's no place to hide  
Though too much to live for  
I owe enough to die  
Ask not for salvation  
My Deth shall mean their lives  
Hatred and guilt the alter they've built  
  
High priests of sin  
Destiny, fate the wicked ones gate  
Beckoning you in  
Down the walkways  
Through the blood stained town  
Looking down the cross  
Bleeding from the crown  
Led to stay  
To die besides the thieves  
Kill the king  
Of the world to be  
And now to you, this will come  
A putrifying pestolence  
More noxious than the serpents breath  
Male violently destined  
More corrupt than the malice of choronzon  
More disease than the wind  
Of the moonlight sun  
Petrification you have caused  
No need for confession  
Now you wish you had a gun to stop the demolition  
  
Crush the bones of the hundred fold  
Swinging the judgment hammer  
Man, woman, child no-one is safe  
The heads of the dead are the banner  
and this was all you got  
So don these broken wings  
Sands of time run out  
Bells of Hades ring  
Is this a nightmare  
To unhallow thy name  
Smell of brimstone  
Dancing in the flames  
No help now  
As you fulfill his task  
Chief of evil  
Has got you by the ass  
Set free  
To sit upon the throne  
Just a dream?  
Your weeping all alone  
  
Looking down the cross  
(Speak no evil)  
I'm looking down the cross  
(Speak no evil)
