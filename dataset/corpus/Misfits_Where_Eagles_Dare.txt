We walk the streets at night  
We go where eagles dare  
They pick up every movement  
They pick up every loser  
With jaded eyes and features  
You think they really care  
  
I ain't no goddamn son of a bitch  
You better think about it baby  
I ain't no goddamn son of a bitch  
You better think about it baby, babe  
  
An omelet of disease awaits your noontime meal  
Her mouth of germicide seducing all your glands  
  
I ain't no goddamn son of a bitch  
You better think about it baby  
I ain't no goddamn son of a bitch  
You better think about it baby, babe  
  
Let's test your threshold of pain  
Let's see how long you last  
That's happened in your rape  
On bosoms of your past  
  
With jaded eyes and features  
You think they really care  
Let's go where eagles dare  
We'll go where eagles dare  
  
I ain't no goddamn son of a bitch  
You better think about it baby  
I ain't no goddamn son of a bitch  
You better think about it baby  
I ain't no goddamn son of a bitch  
You better think about it baby  
I ain't no goddamn son of a bitch  
You better think about it baby, hey
