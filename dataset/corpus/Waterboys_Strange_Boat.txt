We're sailing on a strange boat  
Heading for a strange shore  
We're sailing on a strange boat  
Heading for a strange shore  
Carrying the strangest cargo  
That was ever hauled aboard  
  
We're sailing on a strange sea  
Blown by a strange wind  
We're sailing on a strange sea  
Blown by a strange wind  
Carrying the strangest crew  
That ever sinned  
  
We're riding in a strange car  
We're followin' a strange star  
We're climbing on the strangest ladder  
That was ever there to climb  
  
We're living in a strange time  
Working for a strange goal  
We're living in a strange time  
Working for a strange goal  
We're turning flesh and body  
Into soul
