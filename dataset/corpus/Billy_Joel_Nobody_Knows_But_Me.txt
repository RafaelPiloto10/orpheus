(One two) One two (One two) One two  
(One two) (One two three four)......[gibberish talking]  
  
I got a friend that nobody knows, nobody knows but me  
I got a friend that nobody knows, nobody knows but me  
Ooh, mama please don't tell it to myself again  
I know she thinks I've fought up my mind  
But I'm a-really telling to my secret for real, but we get along just so fine  
  
I got a friend that nobody hears, nobody hears but me  
I got a friend that nobody hears, nobody hears but me  
Oh I always wanna sleep while my daddy says, I'll kiss him when I turn out the
light  
But my friend is sitting on the edge of the day, turns from the evening into
night  
  
But everybody says he took a stage on him and everybody says I'm just a kid  
Faith in the tunnel took the places on him  
Well looky-looky-looky, well my fingers are ditty-ditty-ditty  
Wop-bop-bop-a-lup-bop-a-lop-bam-boom  
  
Well I got a friend that nobody sees, nobody sees but me  
I got a friend that nobody sees, nobody sees but me, that's right now...  
I got a friend that nobody knows, nobody knows but me  
I got a friend that nobody knows, nobody hears, nobody sees  
Nobody's spoken to me, nobody cares, knows but me...
