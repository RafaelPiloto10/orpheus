Twenty cities, it passed me by  
Finding treasures I don't wanna find  
But I have stolen and I've cross the line  
And I want you, I want you  
Twenty seconds and you could be gone  
You shine brighter than the morning sun  
You think it's over but it'd just begun  
And I want you, I want you  
  
This sky is grey, it's full of gold  
Can feel your heart and feel your soul  
I'll drink it up and take it slow  
I don't need anything else  
  
Tell me where I'm heading  
Tell me I could be this sane  
Somewhere I've forgotten  
I die a little more for you  
When everything is broken  
There's piece I'll never lose  
I keep finding reasons to  
Die a little more for you  
  
Twenty questions ringing in my head  
The moment's over but it's never dead  
What did I say and what does all this meant  
'Cause I want you, I want you  
Fire light as it hit you right  
Heads are turned as you walk on by  
Maybe we belong in another time  
I still want you, I want you  
  
This sky is grey, it's full of gold  
Can feel your heart and feel your soul  
I drink it up and take it slow  
I don't need anything else  
  
Tell me where I'm heading  
Tell me I could be this sane  
Somewhere I've forgotten  
I die a little more for you  
When everything is broken  
There's piece I'll never lose  
I keep finding reasons to  
Die a little more for you  
Die a little more for you  
  
How many things can you wish for?  
'Cause just wishing is all I do  
When it comes to you  
How many lives can you live through?  
How many times can you keep movin', keep movin'  
  
Tell me where I'm heading  
Tell me I could be this sane  
Somewhere I've forgotten  
I die a little more for you  
When everything is broken  
There's piece I'll never lose  
I keep finding reasons to  
Die a little more for you  
Die a little more for you  
Die a little more for you
