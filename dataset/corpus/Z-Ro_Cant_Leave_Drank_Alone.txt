I can't leave drank alone it got me feeling  
(Feeling feeling good feeling like a boss cause I'm creeping... (all)  
I can't leave drank alone  
It got me feeling  
(Feeling feeling good  
Feeling like a boss cause I'm creeping trough the hood)  
I can't leave drank alone  
You got a nigga feeling  
(Ain't even goin' to lie this drank gots me feeling  
Like I'm walking on the sky)  
  
Ya'll would think that with 3 felony cases  
I would leave drank alone  
I'm still out on bond  
And I'm a keep dranking till all the drank is gone  
Dam right I'm high as the sky be  
Over g4 and g5 that's where I be  
And then it's back to reality  
'Cause I could heare the sirens  
Woot woot dam hpd right behind me  
I got a little weed and a pint and a half  
But thanks to don I got a stash spot  
And since my doctor wrote me this prescription  
Ain't no body got to burn my ass out  
Still rolling in that three double o  
With my name in my girl on top of fours  
And I'm in love with Mary Jane and codeine  
I don't love these hoes  
I can remember my first couple I was so in love  
So when I wake up in the morning  
Before I brush my teeth I'm pouring up  
Lil momma you a dime pice  
But I'll fuck you up if you touch my cup  
Cause it ain't cheap like it used to be  
And this one cost three hundred and fifty bucks  
Me and DJ screw poured up a pint  
On my twenty second birthday  
And that day was a Monday  
But a nigga didn't wake up until Thursday  
I handle my business  
So I think I deserve to get throwed  
So I'm a walk baby now just like my nigga big moe  
  
I can't leave drank alone  
It got a nigga feeling  
(Feeling feeling good  
Feeling like a boss cause I'm creeping trough the hood)  
I can't leave drank alone  
It got a nigga feeling  
(Ain't even goin to lie this drank gots me feeling  
Like I'm walking on the sky)  
  
Sippin' on the speed tapes  
Heading to the weed place  
This boys think they ball baby  
They should see what we weight  
Some pints of that drank  
Sips of the dro  
Cups all muddy  
Told your bitch to hit it slow  
Tops down on 59  
You know I'm tippin' slow  
I could hear HAWK sayin'  
Mayne your trippin' o  
Slow your ass down mayne  
But me I'm like fuck it  
I got money in my pocket and  
Tonight it's going down  
Cause you know I like sipping  
On that purple stuff  
Purple kush in my bong  
Till the purple cross  
And the babies in the city  
Won't flirt with us  
Five kilos I'm a take  
To put in work for us  
With some down side busters  
We gon stay pouring up  
Ask about O mayne  
I stay showing up  
If I sell two million  
I got to foward it up  
If you wanna ride with money  
Then you better ride with us  
Cause we be sippin on big drank daily  
Yelling to the haters fuck you daily  
Lil o and ro we don't play G  
For real  
  
I can't leave drank alone  
It got me feeling  
(Feeling feeling good  
Feeling like a boss cause I'm creeping trough the hood)  
I can't leave drank alone  
It got a nigga feeling  
(Ain't even goin to lie this drank gots me feeling  
Like I'm walking on the sky)
