Hark! how the bells, sweet silver bells  
All seem to say, throw cares away  
Christmas is here, bringing good cheer  
To young and old, meek and the bold  
Ding dongy dong, that is their song  
With joyful ring, all carolling  
One seems to hear, words of good cheer  
From everywhere, filling the air  
Oh, how they pound, raising their sound  
O'er here and there, telling their tail  
Gaily they ri-ing, while people si-ing  
Songs of good chee-eer, christmas is here  
  
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas  
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas  
  
Come, on they send, on without end  
Their joyful tone, to every home  
Hark! how the bells, sweet silver bells  
All seem to say, throw cares away-ay-ay-ay-ay
