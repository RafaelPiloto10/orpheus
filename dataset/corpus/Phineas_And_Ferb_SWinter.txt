Well there's snow on the ground,  
There are sleigh bells all around,  
But the suns beating down because it's S'Winter,  
It's ski and snowball fight time,  
And also fly a kite time,  
Cold and sunny,  
Yes that's right,  
I'm talking about S'Winter,  
It's a S'Winter S'Wonderland,  
Unusual land grand,  
You can freeze while you get tan,  
Because it's S'Winter,  
Talking about S'Winter,  
It's a S'Winter.
