She gave me my walking papers  
And ran off with someone new  
'Cause he bought her things  
My wages couldn't buy  
So I turned to ups and downers  
And everything between  
Still I can't get her good lovin'  
Off my mind  
  
Well today I bought a Cadillac  
The kind she's always wanted  
I called and asked her  
If she'd like to ride  
She said this is our last date  
I said that's alright with me  
'Cause tonight I'm driving her  
Out of my mind  
  
Yeah I'll take her on a scenic cruise  
Right off of Lookout Mountain  
Cause she said I never took her out  
When she was mine  
She'll see all seven states  
As we drive to the pearly gates  
Tonight when I drive her  
Out of my mind  
  
All the papers will read "Lovers leap  
Again off Lookout Mountain"  
'Cause I wrote a note  
That called it suicide  
But my epitaph will say  
"He killed his pain yesterday  
When he finally drove that woman  
Off his mind"  
  
Well now here she comes to greet me  
Dressed to kill and so am I  
Hope she asks me if this  
Cadillac will fly  
And I know that I'll die laughin'  
When I show her that it will  
When I drive that woman  
Right out of my mind  
  
Hell I'll take her on a scenic cruise  
Right off of Lookout Mountain  
'Cause she said I never took her out  
When she was mine  
She'll see all seven states  
As we drive to the pearly gates  
Tonight when I drive her  
Out of my mind  
  
They'll say Johnny Cash was quite a smash  
Down here in Chattanooga  
Last night when he drove her  
Out of his mind  
  
Yeah that Cadillac dealer's in for a big surprise too  
99 dollars down, 99 dollars a month  
Yeah it's gonna be just gorgeous  
  
(Ooh to the pearly gates)  
(Ooh to the pearly gates)  
(Ooh to the pearly gates)
