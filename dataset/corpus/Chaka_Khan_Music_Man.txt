Chorus:  
Music man play your song for me  
Music man fill my soul  
Music man play a melody  
Music man take control  
  
I listen to you play your heartaches  
I listen to you play your dreams  
I listen to your every feeling  
I wonder what you really mean  
  
Chorus  
  
I sit alone at night and wonder  
Could you be playin' just for me  
I wait for you to play my future  
I wait for you to set me free  
  
Chorus  
  
In your little room you sit all night long  
Playin' for someone that you cannot see  
Do you wonder if someone really hears  
What you're tryin' to say with your melody  
  
Chorus
