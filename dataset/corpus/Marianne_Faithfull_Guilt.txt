I feel guilt, I feel guilt,  
Though I know I've done no wrong I feel guilt.  
I feel guilt, I feel guilt,  
Though I know I've done no wrong I feel guilt.  
I feel bad, so bad,  
Though I ain't done nothing wrong I feel bad.  
I feel bad, so bad,  
Though I ain't done nothing wrong I feel bad.  
I never lied to my lover,  
But if I did I would admit it.  
If I could get away with murder  
I'd take my gun and I'd commit it.  
I never gave to the rich, I never stole from the poor,  
I'm like a curious child, give me more,  
More, more, more, more, more, more.  
I feel blood, I feel blood,  
Though I feel it in my veins, it's not enough.  
I feel blood, I feel blood,  
Though it's streaming through my veins it's not enough.  
I never stole a scarf from harrods,  
But if I did you wouldn't miss it.  
I never stole a doll from lovecraft,  
But if I did you know I'd kiss it.  
I never stole from the rich, I never gave to the poor,  
I'm like a curious child, just give me more,  
More, more, more, more, more, more, more, more.  
I feel guilt, I feel guilt,  
Though I know I've done no wrong I feel guilt.  
I feel guilt, I feel guilt,  
Though I ain't done nothing wrong I feel guilt.  
Guilt, guilt, guilt, guilt  
Guilt, guilt, guilt, guilt ...
