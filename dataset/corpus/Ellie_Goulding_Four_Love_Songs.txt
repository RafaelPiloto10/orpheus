Baby you say you have a little song for me  
But you're wearing shades and your eyes look real dark underneath  
Baby I'm worried you'll get it wrong for me  
There's four love songs so which one did you write for me?  
Baby you haven't been getting along with me  
If you play the song, I know whether to stay or cry or leave  
  
In the first song you love me, but you don't think I love you  
In the second I love you but you leave  
In the third song you're confused til the day I set you free  
On the fourth, someone else is loving me, loving me  
  
Baby I'm waiting to hear your song for me  
Cuz there's been delays since I asked if you're in love with me  
And baby the songs you write are not happy  
I can't find a line like "I love you" and "you love me"  
Baby I no longer think you belong to me  
So I got the song, but you lost the girl, goodbye from me  
  
In the first song you love me, but you don't think I love you  
In the second I love you but you leave  
In the third song you're confused til the day I set you free  
On the fourth, someone else is loving me, loving me  
  
Baby I'm worried you'll get it wrong for me  
There's four love songs, so which one did you write for me?  
  
And in the first song you love me, but you don't think I love you  
In the second I love you but you leave  
In the third song you're confused til the day I set you free  
On the fourth, someone else is loving me, someone else is loving me
