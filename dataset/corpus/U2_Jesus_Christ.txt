One, two, three, four  
  
Well Jesus was a man  
Who traveled through the land  
A hard working man and brave  
Well he said to the rich 'Give your money to the poor'  
For they laid Jesus Christ in his grave  
Hale, hallelujah  
Hale, hallelujah  
Hale, hallelujah  
For they laid Jesus Christ is his grave  
  
Well he went to the preacher  
He went to the law  
And told them all the same  
He said sell all your jewelery and give it to the poor  
For they laid Jesus Christ in his grave  
Hale, hallelujah  
Hale, hallelujah  
Hale, hallelujah  
For they laid Jesus Christ in his grave  
  
When Jesus came to town all the working folks around  
Believed what he did say  
Well the bankers and the preachers  
They nailed him on a cross  
For they laid Jesus Christ in his grave  
  
And [hard] working people  
They followed him around  
They sung and shouted gay  
Well the cops and the soldiers  
They nailed him in the head  
And they laid Jesus Christ in his grave  
Oh, hale, hallelujah  
Hale, hallelujah  
Hale, hallelujah  
For they laid Jesus Christ in his grave  
  
Hale, hallelujah  
Hale, hallelujah  
Hale, hallelujah  
For they laid Jesus Christ in his grave  
  
Well this song was written in New York City  
A rich man, preacher and slave  
Well if Jesus was to preach what he preached in Galilee  
They would lay Jesus Christ in his grave  
One, two, three, four!  
  
Hale, hallelujah  
Hale, hallelujah  
Hale, hallelujah  
For they laid Jesus Christ in his grave  
Hale, hallelujah  
Hale, hallelujah  
Hale, hallelujah  
For they laid Jesus Christ in his grave
