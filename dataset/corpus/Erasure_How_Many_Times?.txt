Love leave me alone, I've got troubles of my own  
I do believe that I have paid the price  
For all the things I've said and done  
Every little thing that seemed to go wrong  
  
How many times will I regret the chances taken?  
Why do I end up always the one who is mistaken?  
  
Love leave me to sleep, let me wallow in my dreams  
See the icy past fade away  
The dawning of a brand new day  
The echoes of the past that still remind me  
  
How many times will I regret the chances taken?  
Why do I end up always the one who is mistaken?  
  
How many times will I regret the chances taken?  
Why do I end up always the one who is mistaken?  
  
How many times will I regret the chances taken?  
Why do I end up always the one who is mistaken?
