Have I told you lately that I love you  
Could I tell you once again somehow  
Have I told you how with all my heart  
And soul I need you  
Well darling I'm telling you now  
My heart would break in two if I should lose you I'm no good without you
anyhow  
Have I told you lately that I love you  
Well, darling, I'm telling you now  
  
Have I told you lately when I'm sleeping  
Every dream that I dream is you somehow  
And have I told you how my every thought  
Is in your keeping  
Well, darling, I'm telling you now  
My world would end today if I should lose you  
'Cause I'm no good without you anyhow  
Have I told you lately that I love you  
Well, darling, I'm telling you now
