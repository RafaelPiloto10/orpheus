I pick me up by the seat of my pants  
And put my fingers down on the keys  
To sing a story that ends nobody's friends  
I'm sittin' in a rock 'n' roll mood  
I'd like to help but I know it's no good  
  
They say nobody's friend, is nobody's fool  
That's an old saying that I just made up  
Singing songs is to make people smile  
But I'm having trouble smiling myself  
  
And now you ask me for a song to help you along  
But I'm sittin' in a rock 'n' roll mood  
I'd like to help you but I know it's no good  
I'm like a fish that done dropped out of his school  
  
That's another saying that I just made up  
How about a man who can't see his own face  
Look at himself in the act  
Fortune teller is trying to tell about  
What she's doing the farm and that ain't all  
  
Now won't you think of a man with a watch in his hand  
Who's dying in to himself, duh  
Now how about the singer whose sittin' here singing  
That he's sittin on the rock 'n' roll mood  
  
He'd like to help you but he knows  
At least, he thinks he's no good  
Sittin' on the rock 'n' roll mood  
  
Here's an old saying, I think I'll go home  
Now you ask me for a song to
