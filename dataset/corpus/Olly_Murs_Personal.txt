You walked through the door  
Girl where were you  
You been here before  
It's nothing new  
Your wearing cologne  
It's not yours  
Who?  
Are you spending time with  
I want the truth, huh  
  
I got a question  
How many lies?  
Question  
How many times?  
Question  
Did you wanna lie?  
  
Please forgive me, if I can't forgive anymore  
I guess I'm taking it personal  
Life without you is better than life before  
I guess I'm taking it personal  
  
Listen  
Listen to my head  
Listen  
And not to my heart  
Listen  
Seems like the ends about to start  
Yeah  
You think your caught, you but not anymore  
I guess I'm taking it personal  
  
Where do I start  
Look at you now  
The lipstick you wear  
Not on your mouth  
The scent of your skin  
Is somewhere else  
I don't need to ask  
I can't help myself  
  
I got a question  
How many lies?  
Question  
How many times?  
Question  
Did you wanna lie?  
  
Please forgive me, if I can't forgive anymore  
I guess I'm taking it personal  
Life without you is better than life before  
I guess I'm taking it personal  
  
Listen  
Listen to my head  
Listen  
And not to my heart  
Listen  
Seems like the ends about to start  
Yeah  
You think your caught, you but not anymore  
I guess I'm taking it personal  
  
Cos this is what is  
This is where are  
Get back in your car  
And drive back to where you came from  
There's nothing left to say  
Nothing left to do  
I'm not gonna change  
I'm not anyway, no  
  
Listen  
Feel like the end has started  
And y'know what?  
Funny I'm not broken hearted  
  
I got a question  
How many lies?  
Question  
How many times?  
Question  
Did you wanna lie?  
  
Please forgive me, if I can't forgive anymore  
I guess I'm taking it personal  
Life without you is better than life before  
I guess I'm taking it personal  
  
Listen  
Listen to my head  
Listen  
And not to my heart  
Listen  
Seems like the ends about to start  
Yeah  
You think your caught, you but not anymore  
I guess I'm taking it personal
