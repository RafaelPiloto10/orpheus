We live in a free world  
I whistle down the wind  
Carry on smiling  
And the world will smile with you  
"Life is a flower  
So precious in your hand  
Carry on smiling  
And the world will smile with you  
  
When every race is run  
And the day is closing in  
I don't care about the world  
I'm living for the light  
Don't cry for me today' ah ah ah  
  
We live in a free world  
I whistle down the wind  
  
I can not be your judge  
Mr. Jailer is your host  
He's keeping you inside  
And hides you from the world  
No catcher in the rye  
Can help you from yourself  
  
We live in a free world  
I whistle down the wind  
  
Please Mr. Agony  
Release them for a while  
"earn them the consequences of  
Living without life  
  
We live in a free world
