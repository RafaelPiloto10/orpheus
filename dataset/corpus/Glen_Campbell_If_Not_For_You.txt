If not for you  
Babe, I couldn't even find the door  
And I couldn't even see the floor  
And I'd be sad and blue  
If not for you  
If not for you  
The night would see me wide awake  
The day would surely have to break  
But it would not be new  
If not for you  
If not for you the sky would fall  
And rain would gather too  
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all  
I'd be lost if not for you  
If not for you  
The winter would have no spring  
I couldn't hear the Robin sing  
I just wouldn't have a clue  
If not for you  
If not for you the sky would fall  
Rain would gather too  
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all  
I'd be lost if not for you  
If not for you  
The winter would have no spring  
I couldn't hear the Robin sing  
I just wouldn't have a clue  
If not for you
