You knew us from the start  
Our every moment  
Though we fell apart  
You chose to love us  
Never letting go  
You sent Your Son for us  
  
He came into the world  
With one desire  
To lead us from our sin  
Remove our failures  
So we could meet with You  
And know ourselves as Yours  
  
In a world that tries to  
Find a way in itself  
Searching high and low  
Looking for a meaning  
We will hold to what we  
Know is truth know is love  
Life is found when we give  
Ourselves all to You Lord  
  
Give it all give it all to the One who's Life  
Give it all give it all to the One who's Life  
Give it all give it all to the One who's Life  
Saved mine  
  
Our future in Your hands  
Our lives with purpose  
Sins now erased our past behind us  
Never looking back  
We know ourselves as Yours  
  
This we know we have a new life  
We are Yours now and forever  
In this life all that we seek  
To be with You more than anything
