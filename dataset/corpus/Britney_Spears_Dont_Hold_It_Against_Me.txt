Listen up  
  
You said that you would treat me right  
But now all we do is fight  
You said that you would love me long  
But oh boy you were wrong  
  
You should have known that I don't play  
So get outta my fucking way and  
  
Don't hold it against me baby  
You're the one who forced me to leave  
So don't hold it against me  
  
Cause you had it  
But you lost it  
And you'll never get it  
Again  
  
You said that you would buy me rings  
But my love don't cost a thing  
You said that I'm the only girl  
But there's another in your world  
  
You should have known that I don't play  
So get outta my fucking way and  
  
Don't hold it against me baby  
You're the one who forced me to leave  
So don't hold it against me  
  
Cause you had it  
But you lost it  
And you'll never get it  
Again  
  
Boom boom boom  
You're blowing up my  
Boom boom  
You're blowing up my love  
  
Boom boom boom  
You're blowing up my  
Boom boom  
You're blowing up my  
L-O-V-E  
  
Yeah you should have known that I don't play  
So get outta my fucking way and  
  
Don't hold it against me baby  
You're the one who forced me to leave  
So don't hold it against me  
  
Cause you had it  
But you lost it  
And you'll never get it  
Again
