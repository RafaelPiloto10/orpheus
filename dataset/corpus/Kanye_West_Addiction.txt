[Chorus]  
Why everything that's supposed to bad make me feel so good?  
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would  
Man I tried to stop man I tried the best I could  
But (You make me smile)  
  
What's your addiction? Is it money? Is it girls? Is it weed?  
I've been afflicted by not one, not two, but all three  
She's got the same thing, about me, but more, about us  
She's coming over, so I guess, that means, I'm on drugs  
Just let me peek now, I mean damn, I'm so curious  
She's got a lover, so the lies, and the lust, is a rush  
Time's of the essence, I need, you to be, spontaneous  
Roll up the doge, and he ain't see you-cut the quarter, then I'm co coming
over  
Cause its never over  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I see the emotion in your eyes, that you, try not to show  
We get the closest when you high, or you drunk, or you blow  
So I pour the potion, so we could both get high, as we could go  
Then I'll get the lotion, and do something to me, when your thighs is exposed  
There's no turning back now, I mean I don't mean to impose  
Not now but right now, I need you to undress, and then pose  
I'm into that now, catch a vibe, when the doors, get closed  
Roll up the doge, and he ain't see you-cut the quarter, and I keep co coming
over  
'Cause its ne-never over  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
(You make me smile with my heart)  
  
I just wanted to ask you  
Just wanted to um  
Let how would I put this uhh  
Let's say all your friends  
Remember the one  
You said if you ever she would be the one  
OK, OK, OK (You make me smile with my heart)  
I was thinking, hypothetically  
I mean don't take this seriously  
Don't take me I mean just  
Uhh not credibly  
I'm feeling incredibly  
I mean let's see  
Just maybe  
I mean you are in me (You make me smile with my heart)  
Maybe, baby, baby  
You know I was just kidding  
Unless you gon' do it  
  
(You make me smile)
