Save me, come on girl and find me  
I'll just sit and wait here  
I'm waiting for the moment that somebody opens my luck  
My luck is slowly fading I'm loosing it unless...  
This is nothing but a dream I can't remember it was...  
Hey girl you didn't say your name now  
Tomorrow I' ll remember, remember that you're so....  
Hey girl you didn't say your name now  
Tomorrow I' ll remember, remember that you're so....  
Hey girl you didn't say your name girl  
Tomorrow I'll remember,  
Remember that your name was starting with an "s" and ending,  
Endings are scary the story of my life is  
I'm allways very close but then it slips away  
Hey girl you didn't say your name now  
Tomorrow I' ll remember, remember that you're so....  
Hey girl you didn't say your name now  
Tomorrow I' ll remember, remember that you're so....
