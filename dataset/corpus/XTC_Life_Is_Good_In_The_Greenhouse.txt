Everybody lives somewhere  
Mud hut or igloo  
But what I got is the hottest spot  
And it's away from you  
Everybody says something  
Truth lies or both  
But dear all your hot air  
Don't encourage my growth  
  
Do you wonder why I look so fresh  
Do you wonder why I look so tall  
Do you wonder why you'll never ever move me  
Life is good in the greenhouse  
Rather be a plant than be your Mickey Mouse  
Life is good in the greenhouse  
  
Everybody eats something  
But you won't eat me  
You won't get me on your plate  
Or have me over for tea  
Everybody lives somewhere  
Mud hut or igloo  
But what I got is the hottest spot  
And it's away from you
