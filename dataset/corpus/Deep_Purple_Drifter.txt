I was born a rambling man  
An' I never got the chance  
To settle down an' get a hold on love  
Takin' air an' movin' around  
Is all I can see that I'm doin'  
An' it is bringin' me down  
Drivin' on a highway going nowhere  
Desolation destination  
Guess I'll find it somewhere  
I know if there's trouble  
I ain't takin' the blame  
That's why I keep movin'  
So nobody knows my name  
  
Born a loser  
I'm beyond the law  
Women behind me  
Never can find me  
They can never get together  
What I've been here for  
'cause I'm a drifter  
  
Rollin' on  
Ain't wastin' my time no more
