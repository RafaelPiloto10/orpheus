Hey old friend let's look back  
On the crazy clothes we wore  
Ain't it fun to look back  
And to see it's all been done before  
  
All those nights together  
Are a special memory  
And I can't wait for tomorrow  
Just as long as you're dancing next to me  
  
'Cause it's so clear every year we get stronger  
What's gone is gone, the past is the past  
Turn the radio up and then hit the gas 'cause  
  
I know we've come so far  
But we've got so far to go  
I know the road seems long  
But it won't be long 'till it's time to go  
  
So most days we'll take it fast  
And some nights we'll take it slow  
I know we've come so far  
But baby, baby we've got so far to go  
  
Hey old friend together  
Side by side and year by year  
The road was filled with twists and turns  
Oh, but that's the road that got us here  
  
Let's move past the bad times  
But before those memories fade  
Let's forgive but not forget  
And learn from the mistakes we made  
  
'Cause it's so clear every year we get stronger  
So don't give up and don't say when  
And just get back on the road again 'cause  
  
I know we've come so far  
But we've got so far to go  
I know the road seems long  
But it won't be long 'till it's time to go  
  
So most days we'll take it fast  
And some nights we'll take it slow  
I know we've come so far  
But baby, baby we've got so far to go  
  
Hey old friend come along for this ride  
There's plenty of room so jump inside  
The highway's rocky every now and then  
But it's so much better then where I've been  
  
Just keep movin' at your own speed  
Your heart is all the compass you'll ever need  
Let's keep cruisin' the road we're on  
'Cause the rear view mirror only shows what's gone, gone, gone  
We got so far to go  
  
Oh, it's so clear every year we get stronger  
So shine that light, take my hand  
Let's dance into the promise land 'cause  
  
I know we've come so far  
But we've got so far to go  
I know the road seems long  
But it won't be long 'till it's time to go  
  
So most days we'll take it fast  
And some nights we'll take it slow  
I know we've come so far  
But baby, baby we've got so far to go  
But baby, baby we've got so far to go  
  
Baby, baby, ooh  
Baby, baby we've got so far to go  
Baby, baby, ooh  
Baby, baby we've got so far to go  
  
Baby, baby, ooh  
Baby, baby we've got so far to go  
Baby, baby, ooh  
Baby, baby we've got so far to go  
  
Baby, baby, ooh  
Baby, baby we've got so far to go  
Baby, baby, ooh  
Baby, baby we've got so far to go
