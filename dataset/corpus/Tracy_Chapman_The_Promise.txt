If you wait for me  
then I'll come for you  
Although I've traveled far  
I always hold a place for you in my heart  
  
If you think of me  
If you miss me once in awhile  
Then I'll return to you  
I'll return and fill that space in your heart  
  
Remembering  
Your touch  
Your kiss  
Your warm embrace  
I'll find my way back to you  
If you'll be waiting  
  
If you dream of me  
L like I dream of you  
In a place that's warm and dark  
In a place where I can feel the beating of your heart  
  
Remembering  
Your touch  
Your kiss  
Your warm embrace  
I'll find my way back to you  
If you'll be waiting  
  
I've longed for you  
A and I have desired  
To see your face your smile  
To be with you wherever you are  
  
Remembering  
Your touch  
Your kiss  
Your warm embrace  
I'll find my way back to you  
Please say you'll be waiting  
  
Together again  
It would feel so good to be  
In your arms  
Where all my journeys end  
If you can make a promise  
If it's one that you can keep  
I vow to come for you  
If you wait for me  
  
And say you'll hold  
A place for me  
I in your heart.
