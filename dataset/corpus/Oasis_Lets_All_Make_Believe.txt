Is anyone here prepared to say  
Just what they mean or is it too late ?  
For anyone here to try to do  
Just what it takes to get through to you  
  
So let's all make believe  
That we're still friends and we like each other  
Let's all make believe  
In the end we're gonna need each other  
  
Stradle my hope and make me pray  
To a God I've never seen, but who I've betrayed  
To the people who live the afterlife  
In a place I'll never be 'til I'm crucified  
  
So let's all make believe  
We're still friends and we like each other  
Let's all make believe  
In the end we'll need each other  
  
Let's all make believe  
That all mankind's gonna feed our brother  
Let's all make believe  
That in the end we'll all grow up  
  
So let's all make believe  
That we're still friends and we like each other  
Let's all make believe  
In the end we'll need each other  
  
Let's all make believe  
That all mankind's gonna feed our brother  
Let's all make believe  
That in the end we'll all grow up
