Released on the cd-single for "goodbye"  
  
Do you have the will to walk on water  
Do you have the strength to part the waves  
Do you have the lips to kiss a blood red rose  
'fore the colors start to fade  
But are you tough enough to walk through the fire  
Are you (? ? ? ) split the hangman's noose  
  
Wanna ride, gonna slide, take it over the line  
Hit the pin, kick it in  
I'm gonna win again  
  
I don't wanna live forever  
I just want a slice of the pie to call my own  
I don't wanna live forever  
Do you wanna be, like I wanna be  
Immortal  
  
Do you have the bread to feed the hunger  
Do you have to choose to turn water to wine  
Do you have the tears to cry me a river  
Build a bridge to the other side  
But are you holding out for the late edition  
Gonna read all about it cause it's frontpage news  
So high, bone dry, got a thirst for life  
Kiss the skin, drink it in  
I'm gonna win again  
  
I don't wanna live forever  
I just want a slice of the pie to call my own  
I don't wanna live forever  
Do you wanna be, like I wanna be  
Immortal  
  
Just like the gates of heaven  
There's no way back, there's no way back  
I'm ten miles high got the keys to the kingdom  
I'm back on track  
Got a life and I'm living it  
  
Do you have the (game? ? ) to the tell me a secret  
Or will I read all about it when it's frontpage news  
  
Wanna ride, gonna slide, take it over the line  
Hit the pin, kick it in  
I'm gonna win again  
  
I don't wanna live forever  
I just want a slice of the pie to call my own  
I don't wanna live forever  
Do you wanna be, like I wanna be  
I don't wanna live forever  
I just want a slice of the pie to call my own  
I don't wanna live forever  
Do you wanna be, like I wanna be immortal  
I don't wanna live forever  
Cause I wanna be immortal  
Do you wanna be immortal  
I don't wanna live forever  
Like I wanna be immortal  
Don't you wanna be immortal  
I don't wanna live forever  
Cause I wanna be immortal  
Do you wanna be immortal  
I don't wanna live forever  
Like I wanna be immortal
