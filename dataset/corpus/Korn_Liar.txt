My brother, you love her  
But don't give up your instincts  
Hang onto you know what  
They'll be gone fast as you blink  
They're trained to seduce you  
Suck you dry quick as they can  
They tried to reduce you  
Now you're barely a man  
  
Oh my God  
How can you deny the blood  
That's flowing through you  
  
Hey you  
You're saying that she's all that you desire  
Liar  
Hey you  
You think you can throw water on this fire  
Liar  
  
It's not wrong to let go  
And let the woman ride you  
For fuck sake, don't lose touch  
With the dog that's inside you  
She wanted what you had  
You bet she smelt the spore  
Don't give up, fuck her up  
One more time, slam that door  
  
Oh my God  
How can you deny the blood  
That's flowing through you  
  
(Scat)  
  
Oh my God  
How can you deny the blood  
That's flowing through you  
  
Oh my God  
How can you deny the blood  
That's flowing through you
