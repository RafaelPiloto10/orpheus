I don't want to rock, baby don't want to rock  
I just feel I'm stuck up against the clock  
I don't really want to rock tonight  
I only want to hold you tight  
  
I don't want to roll, baby don't want to roll  
I just feel I'm cold like I'm getting old  
I don't really want to roll tonight  
I only want to hold you tight  
Please, please don't turn out the light  
  
Rock'n'roll village man  
Northern soul peter pan  
Rock'n'roll rocket man  
Skater phase desperate Dan  
Rock'n'roll never sounded better  
  
I don't want to be, baby don't want to be  
I just feel it's me falling off the tree  
I don't really want to be tonight  
I only want to keep you right  
  
I don't want to try, baby don't want to try  
I just feel I'm dry trying to get by  
I don't really want to try tonight  
I only want to hold you tight  
Please, please don't turn out the light  
  
Rock'n'roll rocket man  
Skater phase desperate Dan  
Rock'n'roll village man  
Northern soul peter pan  
  
You can...  
I don't want to rock, baby don't want to rock  
I just feel I'm stuck up against the clock  
I don't really want to rock tonight  
I only want to keep you right  
  
I don't want to roll, baby don't want to roll  
I just feel I'm cold like I'm getting old  
I don't really want to roll tonight  
I only want to hold you tight  
Please, please don't turn out the light
