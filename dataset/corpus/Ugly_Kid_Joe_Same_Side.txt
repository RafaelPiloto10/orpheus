It doesn't matter who you are  
Or what you're gonna be  
People from all walks of life  
You gotta have diversity  
We're all in this together  
And together we shall be  
You gotta be a friendly neighbor  
If you're gonna live next to me  
We're all  
  
Livin' on the same side  
Same side of town  
Walkin' down the same streets  
The streets that are all around  
  
You could be my brother  
Or you could be my friend  
But don't turn your back on me  
Cause we'll be here 'til the end  
Yeah, we're all in this together  
And we all have that dream  
To live in perfect harmony  
Like a family that's the scene  
Yeah, we're all...  
  
Livin' on the same side  
Same side of town  
Walkin' down the same streets  
The Streets that are all around  
Livin' on the same side  
Same side of town  
Shufflin' to the same beat  
The beat that's all around  
  
Stumblin' down on D.P., keggers all around,  
Laughin' at the police as they try to take us down  
Hangin' with each other, yeah hangin' with our bro's  
We all love one another, from our heads down to our toes
