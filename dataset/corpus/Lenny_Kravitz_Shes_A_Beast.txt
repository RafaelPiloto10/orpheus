[Verse:]  
My heart is beatin'  
And I can't wait for tomorrow  
I'm gonna see her  
My beautiful wild flower  
  
[Chorus:]  
She takes away space and time  
She moves and eases my mind  
Together we're one design  
Yeah, she's a beast  
  
[Verse 2:]  
I must be dreamin'  
Don't have to beg, steal or borrow  
And all I needed, yeah  
I get every day and hour  
  
[Chorus:]  
She makes me feel so alive  
She's always full of desire  
When we make love it's on fire  
Yeah, she's a beast  
Oh, she's a beast  
Yeah, she's a beast  
Yes, you are, honey  
Yeah, yeah, yeah-ah  
Wooh  
  
[Verse 3:]  
When she is sleepin'  
I stare at her face in wonder  
Yeah, how God released her  
Now she is mine to discover  
  
[Chorus:]  
She wears her soul in her eyes  
She is so pure and so wise  
I'll always be by her side  
Yeah, she's a beast  
Yes, you are, sugar  
Yeah, yeah, yeah-ah  
Wooh
