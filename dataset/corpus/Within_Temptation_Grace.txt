Cold are the bones of thy soldiers  
Longing for home, their little paradise  
I don't feel redemption on their side  
  
Fallen from grace, help me rise again  
Fallen from grace, help me through  
Fallen from grace, help me through  
Fallen from grace  
  
Feel these hands, the pressure, the cold, tremble  
Do you hear these words  
Do you feel the wounds  
I'll never help you through  
  
Cold are thy souls  
I feel resentment,  
they feel betrayed  
They hate the cold  
I don't feel redemption on their side  
  
Fallen from grace, help me rise again  
Fallen from grace, help me through
