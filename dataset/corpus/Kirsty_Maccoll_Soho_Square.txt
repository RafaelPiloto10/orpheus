Your name froze on the winter air  
An empty bench in Soho Square  
Forgotten now I turn away  
Just save me for a rainy day  
But don't be sorry  
I don't want to hear it baby  
  
My feet froze in the winter chill  
I knew I'd probably get ill  
But I was praying we could fill  
An empty bench and still  
You're so sorry  
But I don't want your pity baby  
  
It's all yours now please don't tease  
The pigeons shiver in the naked trees  
And I'll do anything but  
Please don't hurt me  
Just kiss me quick  
'Cause it's my birthday  
And I feel so small  
I don't know why  
But no I'm not too old to cry  
  
An empty bench in Soho Square  
If you'd have come you'd have found me there  
But you never did 'cause you don't care  
And I'm so sorry baby  
I don't mind loneliness too much  
But when I met you I was touched  
And that was good enough for me  
But do we always have to be sorry  
Why can't we just be happy baby?  
  
One day you'll be waiting there  
No empty bench in Soho Square  
And we'll dance around like we don't care  
And I'll be much too old to cry  
And you'll kiss me quick in case I die  
Before my birthday  
  
One day you'll be waiting there  
No empty bench in Soho Square  
No I don't know the reason why  
I'll love you till the day I die  
But one day you'll be waiting there  
Come summertime in Soho Square  
And I'll be painting stars up in the sky  
Before I get too old to cry  
Before my birthday  
I hope I see those pigeons fly  
Before my birthday  
In Soho Square on my birthday
