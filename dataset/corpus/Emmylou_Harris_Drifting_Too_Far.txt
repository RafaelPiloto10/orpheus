Out on the perilous deep,  
Where danger silently creeps,  
And storm's so violently sweeping,  
You're drifting too far from shore.  
  
Chorus:  
Drifting too far from shore,  
You're drifting too far from shore,  
Come to Jesus today,  
Let Him show you the way  
You're drifting too far from shore.  
  
Today, the Tempest rose high,  
And clouds o'er shadow the sky.  
Sure death is hovering neigh,  
You're drifting too far from shore.  
  
Drifting too far from shore,  
You're drifting too far from shore,  
Come to Jesus today,  
Let Him show you the way  
You're drifting too far from shore.  
  
Why meet a terrible fate?  
Mercies abundantly wait.  
Turn back before it's too late  
You're drifting too far from shore.  
  
Drifting too far from shore  
You're drifting too far from shore (peaceful shore)  
Come to Jesus today. Let him show you the way  
You're drifting too far from shore...
