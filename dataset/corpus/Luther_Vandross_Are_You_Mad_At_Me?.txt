I was lost until the day I found you  
And I know you know  
There's not a thing for you that I wouldn't do  
But, yesterday was rough on me  
I was under the weather  
So my dear, I didn't have much to say  
  
And I rushed you off of the phone last night  
So I called you back to apologize  
But your line stayed busy through the night, you see  
And it makes me wonder  
Are you mad at me?  
  
I was right to fall in love this way  
And one thing's for sure  
The angels smiled on me  
When you came my way  
So my dear, tonight's the night  
It's gonna be special  
I can't wait to see the face of my love  
  
But even though I tried, sorry I was late  
And I understand that you couldn't wait  
But you're pulling back, honey I can see  
And it makes me worry  
Are you mad at me?  
  
I wish I could be perfect for you  
Can't you see how hard I try?  
  
When you talk to me I can hear the pain  
When I look in your face I can see the strain  
And I can hear the cries of the willow tree  
Something's wrong I know it  
Are you mad at me?
