You gotta learn to listen, listen to learn  
You gotta learn to listen, before you get burned  
Learn to listen, listen to learn  
You gotta learn to listen, before you get burned  
  
You gotta have fun, not a fix in the arm  
You gotta stay out of deep water  
Happiness is something you've gotta earn  
You gotta fight to make your love into returns  
  
Learn to listen, listen to learn  
You gotta learn to listen, before you get burned  
  
You got the rights and there's always a temptation  
This one more screwed up the nation  
Gotta have a plan, gotta learn to listen  
Gotta take a stab, you have my blessing, alright  
  
You gotta take the cotton out of your ears  
You gotta start hanging on to all your affairs  
I've lived your life for so many years  
All I got was self-pity and tears
