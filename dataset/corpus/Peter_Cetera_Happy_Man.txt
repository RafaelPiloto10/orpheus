Merely by chance  
Very unsuspecting  
You caught my heart  
Unprotecting me  
Now I've fallen in love with you  
  
Just when I thought  
Life was free and easy  
You came along to me  
Soft and breezy  
Now I've fallen in love with you  
  
[Chorus]  
And for the first time in my life  
I know what it's like to be a happy man  
Happy man  
And for the first time in my life  
You've given me something I can't understand  
Now that I'm a happy man  
  
Be with me now  
Love me forever  
Leaving you lady  
Is something that I'd never do  
I've fallen in love with you  
  
All of my life it seems I have waited  
Now I can say all these words I have stated are true  
I've fallen in love with you  
I've fallen in love with you  
  
[Chorus]
