(And so the story begins)  
City dweller, successful fella  
Thought to himself  
Oops I've got a lot of money  
I'm caught in a rat race terminally  
I'm a professional cynic  
But my heart's not in it  
I'm paying the price of living life at the limit  
Caught up in the century's anxiety  
It preys on him, he's getting thin  
  
Now he lives in a house, a very big house in the country  
Watching afternoon repeats  
And the food he eats in the country  
He takes all manner of pills  
And piles up analyst bills in the country  
It's like an animal farm,  
Lots of rural charm in the country  
  
Now he's got morning glory, and life's a different story  
Everything going Jackanory  
In touch with his own mortality  
He's reading Balzac, knocking back Prozac,  
It's a helping hand  
That makes you feel wonderfully bland  
Oh, it's the century's remedy for the faint at heart,  
A new start  
  
He lives in a house, a very big house in the country  
He's got a fog in his chest  
So he needs a lot of rest in the country  
He doesn't drink smoke laugh  
He takes herbal baths in the country  
Oh, it's like an animal farm  
But you'll come to no harm in the country  
  
Blow blow me out I am so sad I don't know why.
