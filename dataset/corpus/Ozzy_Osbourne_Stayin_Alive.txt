All aboard the disco train  
Alright now, oh, yeah, oh, yeah  
  
Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk  
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk  
Music's loud and women warm  
I've been kicked around since I've been born  
  
It's all right, it's okay  
And you may look the other way  
We can try to understand  
The New York Times' effect on man  
  
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother  
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive  
Feel the city breakin' and everyone is shakin'  
And stayin' alive, stayin' alive  
Ha, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive  
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive  
  
Everybody on the dance floor, darlin's  
We're goin' to dance with the Devil  
  
Well, I get low and I get high  
And if I can't get either, I really try  
Got the wings of Heaven on my shoes  
I'm a dancin' man and I just can't lose  
  
Now, it's all right, it's okay  
I'll live to see another day  
We can try to understand  
The New York Times' effect on man  
  
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother  
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive  
Feel the city breakin' and everyone is shakin'  
They're stayin' alive, stayin' alive  
Ha, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive  
Ha, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive  
  
It's all right, it's okay  
And you may look the other way  
We can try to understand  
The New York Times' effect on man  
  
It's all right, it's okay  
I'll live to see another day  
We can try to understand  
The New York Times' effect on man  
  
Are you ready, Disco Man  
Oh, yeah, all right now  
I'm back
