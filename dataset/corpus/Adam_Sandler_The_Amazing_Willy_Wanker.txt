When I was just a little wee lad  
I hopped on the lap of my dear old dad  
Something jumped and poked me good  
'That' he said 'just me morning wood'  
A little tin soldier's marchin by  
Sergeant major unzips his fly  
Pulls his weapon from his camouflage pants  
Slaps away til it starts to dance  
A shootin star's above my bed  
Changin colors of my mushroom head  
A rainbow jizz flys across the room  
Little white spermies meet their doom  
(Ah!) The amazing Willy Wanker!  
(Aaaah!) The amazing Willy Wanker!  
And my scrotum sack he says  
Lalalalalala, tickle me!  
Little green men from outer space  
Here to exterminate the human race  
Drop their ray guns and retreat to their ships  
When marshmallow sauce squirts from me tip  
Like a knight of olden Camelot  
The goo takes off like an arrow shot  
Gwynevere drops to her knees and begs  
For the spittin dragon between me legs  
I'm using my thing for what it's for  
Gentle knock upon me door  
Mumsy drops her cup of tea  
When she sees my wank standing tall and free  
(Ah!) The one and only Willy Wanker!  
(Aaaaah!) Here comes Willy Wanker!  
And my marble sack he says  
Lalalalalala, tickle me!  
Rasberry scones and marmalade!  
Squeezing my squid in the evening shine!  
Visions of mermaids in the sky!  
Shooting my load in me own left eye!  
Gramps was a hero in the first World War  
But he ain't got no dick no more  
Comes home smokin from the corner pub  
Makes poor old Gramsy kiss his nub  
The world spins around like a big bass drum  
Nanny pops a pinkie in the generals bum  
The Irish dance and the Scotsmem howl  
Time to clean up with the washroom towel  
(Ah, yeah!) It's only Willy Wanker, yeah!  
(Ah!) The lonely Willy Wanker!  
And my wrinkled sack he says  
Lalalalalala, tickle me!
