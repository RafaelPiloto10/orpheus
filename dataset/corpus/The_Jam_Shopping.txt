High town - high street connections  
With clothes at the top of my list  
You could steal things from the jewelry department  
But you can't take kind or steal a kiss  
As I flit from shop window to window  
I'm trying to pick up a friendly bargin  
But its not like the adverts all make out  
And there's no one to greet you as a friend  
  
I dress myself for the part  
I smile but it just don't work  
Something about my face - must just be the wrong shape  
I better try another brand pretty quick  
  
I'm haunted by the colours and holding a reminder that I must be inadequate  
High town - high street connection  
With clothes at the top of my list
