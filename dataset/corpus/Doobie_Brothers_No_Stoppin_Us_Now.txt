Every time when I think I'm closer  
To what I need most  
Here I am, standing in line  
Will it be worth the waiting?  
Had enough of hard times  
I can't stand no more  
Layin' down a new line  
Now I know for sure  
Every heartbreak made me that much stronger  
Good things take that long  
Had enough of hard times  
There's no stopping us now  
Had enough of hard times  
There's no stopping us now  
I know I was born to love you  
So glad it's you  
Got a new rhyme  
Here's another rhythm got me steppin' in time  
Sittin' with your head on my shoulder  
Right where you belong
