Whatever gets you  
Through the night  
That's all right with me  
When it's time to say goodbye  
I have to make you see  
  
You won't know me  
I won't call you  
I won't be there  
To remind you  
What you told me  
When I showed you  
In the morning  
Let me know you'll  
  
Drive back to your old town  
I wanna wake up  
With no-one around  
Drive back to your old town.  
  
If somebody  
Is haunting your mind  
Look in my eyes  
Let me hide you  
From yourself and  
All your old friends  
Every good thing  
Comes to an end.  
  
Drive back,  
Drive back,  
Drive back.  
  
Drive back to your old town  
I wanna wake up with no-one around  
Drive back to your old town.
