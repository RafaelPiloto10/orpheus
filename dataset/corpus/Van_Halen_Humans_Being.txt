There is just enough Christ in me  
To make me feel almost guilty  
Is that why God made us breed  
To make us see we're Humans Being  
You break this, I'll break all that  
You break my balls with all your crap  
Spread your disease like lemmings breeding  
That's what makes us humans being  
Shine on, shine on  
Shine on, shine on  
Some low life flat head scum infects  
The sickness in his eyes reflects  
You wonder why your life is screaming  
Wonder why your Humans Being  
Shine on, shine on  
Shine on, shine on  
Humans  
Humans being  
We're just humans, humans being  
That's what makes us  
Humans being
