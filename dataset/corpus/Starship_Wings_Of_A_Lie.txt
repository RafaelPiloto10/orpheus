A close up of your soul is printed in your eyes  
I know I've lost control, I'm getting close to paradise  
Who knows to what I'm holding on  
So many ways it can go wrong  
And all my heart needs to know is it time to let go  
  
My heart is where you are, I'll always trust in what you do  
Your love will take me far, I'll only see the best in you  
But what if you feel like movin' on  
Leaving before the night is gone  
All my heart needs to know is it time to let go  
Oh that's all my heart needs to know  
  
Don't let me fly on the wings of a lie  
Don't you take me down easy  
Don't let me guess if your eyes speak goodbyes  
Heaven seems to be a place not meant for me  
  
It's quiet round my heart, there's no need for empty words  
Just let me go my way and leave before the silence hurts  
There's always one more chance to take  
There's always one more heart to break  
All my heart needs to know is it time to let go  
Is it time  
All my heart needs to know  
  
Don't let me fly on the wings of a lie  
Don't you take me down easy  
Don't lead me on if tonight means goodbye  
Don't let me be the last to know  
  
Woo  
  
Someone's grip is always stronger  
Someone cares just a little bit more  
I'm holdin' on a little longer  
Just a little, just a little bit more  
  
Don't let me fly on the wings of a lie  
Don't you take me down easy  
Don't lead me on if tonight means goodbye  
Don't let me guess if your eyes mean good thoughts  
  
Oh baby don't let me fly  
Don't let me fly  
Don't let me down easy
