Baby doll I'm gonna steal you away  
Baby doll I'm gonna steal you away  
One of these nights when all is still  
I'm gonna climb your windowsill  
And if my plans work OK  
I'm gonna steal you away  
When everyone is fast asleep  
Into your room I'll softly creep  
And in my cloak of misty gray  
I'm gonna steal you away  
What if detectives begin to trail me  
What if they find us, they wouldn't jail me  
Though I was stealing, they'd set me free  
When they see that we're married happily  
So if one night your window squeaks  
And if the floor around you creaks  
It's gonna be elopement day  
I'm gonna steal you away  
But if the detectives begin to trail me  
What if they find me, they wouldn't jail me  
Though I was stealing, they let me be free  
When they see that we're married happily  
So if one night your window squeaks  
And if the floor around you creaks  
It's gonna be elopement day  
I'm gonna steal you away  
I'm gonna steal you  
Baby, I'm gonna steal you away
