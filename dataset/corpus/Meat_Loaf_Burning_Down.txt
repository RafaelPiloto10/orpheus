If it takes them so long, so long to say yes, why don't they just say no  
We don't need anyone to be put to the test, why don't they let us be  
  
[Chorus]  
Livin' for the right to be, livin' for the right  
Livin' for the right to be, livin' for the right  
Livin' for the right to be free  
  
We needed a plan, we needed defences, they couldn't raise a smile  
As the world looked down, they raided our senses, there can be no reconcile  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Burnin' down, burnin' down, burnin' down, burnin' down  
  
There was a time in our life was taken for granted, it'll never come again  
Our flower is dead, the seed is unplanted, they put it all to the flame  
  
Burnin' down, burnin' down, burnin' down, burnin' down  
Burnin' down, burnin' down, burnin' down, burnin' down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Burnin' down, burnin' down  
  
Burnin' down, burnin' down, burnin' down, burnin' down
