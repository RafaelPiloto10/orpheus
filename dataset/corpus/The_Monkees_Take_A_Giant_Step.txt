Though you've played at love and lost  
And sorrow's turned your heart to frost  
I will melt your heart again.  
Remember the feeling as a child  
When you woke up and morning smiled  
It's time you felt like you did then.  
There's just no percentage in remembering the past  
It's time you learned to live again at last.  
  
Come with me, leave yesterday behind  
And take a giant step outside your mind.  
  
You stare at me in disbelief  
You say for you there's no relieve  
But I swear I'll prove you wrong.  
Don't stay in your lonely room  
Just staring back in silent gloom.  
That's not where you belong  
Come with me I'll take you where the taste of life is green  
And everyday holds wonders to be seen.  
  
Come with me, leave yesterday behind  
And take a giant step outside your mind.
