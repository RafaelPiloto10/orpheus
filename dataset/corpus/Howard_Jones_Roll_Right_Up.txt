Will the moon keep shining on  
Can you stop the world from turning  
Stop running away from things that might fail you  
You have what you need you are the one  
You can't hold a person down  
'cause the truth will find it's opening  
You must take it on the things you must feel  
We all feel the same you are the one  
Chorus  
Roll right up and feel it see the world  
Prison doors are open wide  
See the world you need it  
You were born with something special  
You were forged in open fire  
Stop running away form things that might fail you  
You have what you need you are the one
