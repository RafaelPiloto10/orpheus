When the dancehall jus' ram, some people call it confinement  
But if you're with your woman or your man, it's pure excitement  
When you see the girls groove, they get right in the mood for loving  
And if the weedman in the place, there's no time for pushing and shoving  
  
You see the DJ on the scene, he knows just what you mean about rubbing  
And when you're feeling alright, he's right out of sight while he's dubbing  
  
Well the dancehall jus' ram, so you see we're dealing with pure niceness  
And the music so loud that to shout above it, you'd be left voiceless  
  
The music so right  
We could have danced all night  
The feeling so nice  
Operator play it twice  
  
They have the reggae and soul and the ital vital dub plate riddims  
They have revival 45, calypso, soca, and all kind'a riddim  
  
You see the busy barman in the dance, he's used to dealing under nuff pressure  
And after you've had your drink, you're gonna need another refresher  
  
Everybody in the dance just grooving, looking laughing and smiling you see  
So if you're feeling irie little darling come and have a dance over by me
