Oooh  
  
It's hard to remember a time  
When I didn't have you  
Didn't have nothing but a cold bed to come to at night  
That was all I knew  
Until there was you  
  
And then you took my world  
And turned it all around  
I couldn't live without you now  
  
Baby  
If I can't have your love  
If I can't feel your touch  
I got nothin'  
Baby  
If I can't taste your kiss  
Then I don't exist  
I got nothin' yeah  
  
No I can't imagine livin' life without you  
I can't imagine livin' life without your love  
  
I wake up with you by my side  
I can't let go  
I can't even bear the thought of you in another man's eyes  
I would lose control  
I would die  
  
'Cause now you're in my heart  
And I can't let you out  
I gotta keep you here, somehow  
  
Baby  
If I can't have your love  
If I can't feel your touch  
I've got nothing  
Baby  
If I can't taste your kiss  
Then I don't exist  
I got nothing  
If I can't be your man  
I wouldn't know who I am  
I got nothing, I got nothing  
  
(whispered)  
No I can't imagine living life without you  
I can't imagine living life without your love  
  
(Sung)  
'Cause I can't imagine living live without you  
Can't imagine living life wiouthout your love  
  
Believe me baby I don't mean to doubt you  
But if you ever leave  
That would be the end of me  
Baby, Baby  
  
If I can't feel your touch I got nothin'  
If I can't taste your kiss then I don't exist  
Then I got nothin'  
I got nothin'  
  
Baby  
If I can't be your man  
I wouldn't know who I am  
I'd be nothing  
Baby  
If I can't have your love  
If I can't feel your touch  
I've got nothin' (yeah-h)  
  
No I can't imagine living life without you  
No I can't imagine living life without your love
