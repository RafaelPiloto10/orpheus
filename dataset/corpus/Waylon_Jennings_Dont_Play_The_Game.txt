The hardest thing you ever do is love yourself that gal don't love you  
She'll cause you sleepless nights and endless pain  
But if you don't like the rules don't play the game  
Every time that girl walks by your heart will ache your very soul will die  
But love one sided it's just yourself to blame  
And if you don't like the rules don't play the game  
  
You think by now I see the fool I've been given my heart a chance to win  
Well I do but I don't I will but I won't deep inside I know I'll do again  
The hardest thing you ever do is love yourself that gal don't love you  
With love one sided it's just yourself to blame  
And if you don't like the rules don't play the game  
If you don't like the rules don't play the game
