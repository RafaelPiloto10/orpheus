I've been a wild rover for many a year  
And I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer  
And now I'm returning with gold in great store  
And I never will play the wild rover no more  
And it's no, nay, never  
No, nay, never, no more  
And I'll play the wild rover  
No never, no more  
I went to an alehouse I used to frequent  
And I told the landlady my money was spent  
I asked her for credit, she answered me, "Nay"  
Saying, "Custom like yours, I can have any day"  
And it's no, nay, never  
No, nay, never, no more  
And I'll play the wild rover  
No never, no more  
I took from my pocket ten sovereigns bright  
And the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight  
She said, "I have whiskeys and wines of the best  
And the words that I told you were only in jest"  
And it's no, nay, never  
No, nay, never, no more  
And I'll play the wild rover  
No never, no more  
I'll go home to my parents, confess what I've done  
And I'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son  
And when they have kissed me as oft-times before  
I never will play the wild rover no more  
And it's no, nay, never  
No, nay, never, no more  
And I'll play the wild rover  
No never, no more
