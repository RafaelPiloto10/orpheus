Meanie Leanie come on down  
Come and entertain the town  
It's friday night and we're all bored  
Time's been called there is no more  
Time's been called it's such a bore  
  
Dan Abnormal not normal at all  
It's not his fault we made him this way  
He'll imitate you try to ape you  
But it's not his fault Dan watches T.V.  
  
The meanie Leanie stays up late  
Mopes around gets in a state  
He the killer in your arcade  
Killing gangstas ready made  
Cause that is where the future's made  
  
Tele port me  
  
Dan went to his local burger bar  
I want McNormal and chips  
Or I'll blow you to bits  
Give us it  
  
It's the miseries at half past three  
Watching video nasties  
He has dirty dreams while he's asleep  
Dan's just like you and me  
He's the Meanie Leanie  
  
Dan Abnormal not normal at all  
It's not his fault we made him this way  
He'll imitate you try to ape you  
But it's not his fault Dan Abnormal's me
