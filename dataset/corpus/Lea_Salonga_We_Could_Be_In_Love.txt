Be still my heart  
Lately its mind is all its own  
It would go far and wide  
Just to be near you  
  
Even the stars, shining up bright  
I've noticed when you're close to me  
Still it remains a mystery.  
  
Anyone who's seen us  
Knows what's goin' on between us  
It doesn't take a genius  
To read between the lines  
  
And it's not just wishful thinking  
Or only me who's dreaming  
I know what these are symptoms of  
We could be in love.  
  
I ask myself why  
I sleep like a baby through the night  
Maybe it helps to know  
You'll be there tomorrow  
Don't open my eyes (ooh hoo-hoo)  
  
I'll wake from the spell I'm under  
Makes me wonder how (tell me how)  
I could live without you now.  
  
And what about the laughter  
The happy ever after?  
Like voices of sweet angels  
Calling out our names  
  
And it's not just wishful thinking  
  
Or only me who's dreaming  
I know what these are symptoms of  
We could be in love.  
  
All my life, I have dreamed of this  
But I could not see your face  
Don't ask why to such distant stars  
Can fall right into place.  
  
And it's not just wishful thinking  
Or only me who's dreaming  
I know what these are symptoms of  
We could be in love.  
  
...love.  
  
Oh, it doesn't take a genius  
To know what these are symptoms of  
We could be, oh hoh we could be  
We could be in love, we could be  
We could be in love.
