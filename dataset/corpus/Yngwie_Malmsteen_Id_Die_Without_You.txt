I'd sacrifice, whatever's left of me  
Been livin' lies then you set me free  
You've given more than I ever had  
I give to you all over again  
  
We've grown so strong  
Over and over again  
Though things have gone wrong  
My love  
  
There is no higher love than we have  
You know I'd die without you  
There are no lies, we left them behind  
I'd surely die without you  
  
I've never tried, tried this hard  
I've never cried, never gone so far  
Even the Gods, can't set us apart  
It's engraved deep in our hearts  
  
We've grown so strong  
Over and over again  
Though things have gone wrong  
My love  
  
There is no higher love than we have  
You know I'd die without you  
There are no lies, we left them behind  
I'd surely die without you
