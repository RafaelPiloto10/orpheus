Who's that with his arm around you?  
He making eyes at you that way  
He looks in love  
He looks familiar  
Damn it's me  
Never thought I'd see that day  
It's like I came to sleep and there was darkness  
Well I'm holding the daylight by your voice  
Not that I have any choice  
  
Something coming over me  
I know it's you  
Someone that I used to be  
But he is through  
Know that it's forever and it's overdue  
Something coming over me  
I know it's you  
  
And now we're talking about our future  
Oh and our futures wide open  
Cause your love is the best place I've ever been  
It was you to the rescue  
And I mention that I'd never felt like this before  
I'm powerless to fight it anymore  
  
Something coming over me  
I know it's you  
Someone that I used to be  
But he is through  
Know that it's forever and it's overdue  
Something coming over me  
I know it's you  
  
Used to watch this game from the sidelines  
Now it's time to get on in and play  
You've been waiting there for me for my whole life  
Now it's all you  
Now it's all you  
  
Something coming over me  
I know it's you  
Someone that I used to be  
But he is through  
Know that it's forever and it's overdue  
Something coming over me  
I know it's you  
I know  
I know it's you baby  
I know it's you
