The world was on fire  
No one could save me but you  
It's strange what desire  
Will make foolish people do  
I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you  
I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you  
  
No I don't want to fall in love  
(this girl is only gonna break your heart)  
And I don't want to fall in love  
(this girl is only gonna break your heart)  
With you  
(this girl is only gonna break your heart)  
  
What a wicked game to play  
To make me feel this way  
What a wicked thing to do  
To let me dream of you  
What a wicked thing to say  
You never felt this way  
What a wicked thing to do  
To make me dream of you  
  
And I don't want to fall in love  
(this girl is only gonna break your heart)  
No I don't want to fall in love  
(this girl is only gonna break your heart)  
With you  
  
The world was on fire  
No one could save me but you  
It's strange what desire  
Will make foolish people do  
No I never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you  
And I never dreamed  
That I'd lose somebody like you  
  
No I don't want to fall in love  
(this girl is only gonna break your heart)  
No I don't want to fall in love  
(this girl is only gonna break your heart)  
With you  
(this girl is only gonna break your heart)  
  
No I (this girl is only gonna break your heart)  
(this girl is only gonna break your heart)  
Nobody loves no one
