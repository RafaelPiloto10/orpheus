It never used to be that bad  
But neither was it great  
Somewhere in the middle than  
Content and much too safe  
Ooh tell me please  
Why it takes so long  
To realise when there's something wrong  
  
Lay me out with your heart  
Now we're gettin' somewhere  
Push me back to the start  
Now we're gettin' somewhere  
Take me out let me breathe  
Now we're gettin' somewhere  
When I'm with you I don't care  
Where it is I'm falling  
  
There's money in the Bible belt  
Hugs for daddy too  
Three wishes for eternity  
We've got some work to do  
Ooh tell me please, tell me what went wrong  
Cause I believe there is something wrong  
  
Lay me out with your heart  
Now we're gettin' somewhere  
Push me back to the start  
Now we're gettin' somewhere  
Take me out let me breathe  
Now we're gettin' somewhere  
When I'm with you I don't care  
Where it is I'm falling  
  
When you took me to your room  
I swear I said surrender  
When you opened up your mouth  
I saw the words fall out  
Though nothing much has changed  
I swear I will surrender  
There is pain in my heart  
We can choose what we choose to believe
