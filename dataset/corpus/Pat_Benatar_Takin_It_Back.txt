When they found you, you were driven and hungry  
You were playin' for your life then  
You were livin' for the chance to be heard  
What they promised, what they offered  
Was more than you'd ever hoped for  
To walk away, ya' know that would've been absurd  
And talk about absurdity, it was madness  
It was everything in excess  
It was too much, too many, and too little time  
It was faceless people in jackets and ties  
Who thought of you when they made love to their wives  
Somehow, it wasn't what you had in mind  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Tell 'em you're Takin' It Back  
So they might as well get used to the idea  
You're Takin' It Back, those cooperation days are over  
You got no one to blame but yourself  
So don't put it on nobody else  
Put it behind you, start over, today  
  
There were parties and photos and televised award shows  
And covers of magazines  
There was gold and platinum and everyone was smiling  
You were coming apart at the seems  
There were jerk offs too numerous to mention  
When everybody shared the dream  
But when it came time to share the nightmare  
They were conveniently nowhere to be seen  
  
(Chorus)  
  
Oh they'll argue what they gave you was exactly what you wanted  
And just to be fair, ya' know that some of it's true  
That's why ya' gotta be careful, 'bout your wishes  
Take your time and think 'em over  
Sometimes those wishes just might come true  
  
Tell 'em you're Takin' It Back  
So they might as well get used to the idea  
You're Takin' It Back, those cooperation days are over  
Tell 'em you've had enough, and if they don't like it it's tough  
You're Takin' It Back, those cooperation days are over  
You're Takin' It Back  
Tell 'em you're Takin' It Back
