I'm looking at you, old friend of mine  
There's no use pretending that everything's fine  
Now don't be so brave, don't be so proud  
I want you to know that I'm here for you now  
  
I can see you hurting and it's hurting me  
It doesn't have to be this way  
  
[Chorus]  
(Somebody gonna hold your head up)  
If you let me hold you closer  
(Somebody gonna show you the light)  
Let me know you  
(Somebody gonna hold your head up)  
Let me show you the way  
(Somebody gonna see you right)  
  
I'm feeling for you, feeling so much  
When this heart is big enough for the both of us  
I'll give you my love if you give me your pain  
I'll hold it inside of me 'till you're stronger again  
  
Well, I hate seeing you so far away  
When not a word can say it enough  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll be your rock for this day  
When I hear you calling out my name  
Cause I know you'd only do the same for me  
  
[Chorus]
