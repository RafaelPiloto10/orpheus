Heavy heart think of yesterday  
And you're torn apart thinkin' of the ways  
Easier to smile more than today  
Love grew wild  
Heavy heart like a perfect stranger  
And you make it hard  
Takin' all the blame  
Still you hear the sound callin' your name  
Trouble's callin' down so heavy  
Turnin' around  
It's pressin' me down  
Heavy heart  
This time I find  
It weighs on my mind  
Heavy heart  
It's just like you to take it all so far  
Then you feel abused  
And wonder who you are  
Everything you've done  
Anything you start  
Can turn and run  
Ain't it true? It's only just a stage  
Give it room, start an empty page  
Get back in the game, do it your way  
You don't have to play so heavy  
Turnin' around  
It's pressin' me down  
Heavy heart  
This time I find  
It weighs on my mind  
Heavy heart  
When your heart is strong  
It leads you on  
But when it breaks you  
It devastates you for so long  
Turnin' around  
It's pressin' me down  
Heavy heart  
This time I find  
It weighs on my mind  
Heavy heart  
Turnin' around  
It's pressin' me down  
Heavy heart  
This time I find  
It weighs on my mind  
Heavy heart
