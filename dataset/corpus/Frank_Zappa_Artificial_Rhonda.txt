I got a girl with a little rubber head  
Rinse her out every night just before I go to bed  
She never talk back like a lady might do  
An' she looks like she loves it every time I get through  
And her name is  
A-are-t-I  
F-I-see, I cry  
A-l, don't be shy!  
Artificial rhonda  
With the plastic pie  
Her eyes is all shut in a ecstasy face  
I can cram it down her throat, people, any old place!  
Then I throw the little switch on her battery pack  
'n I can poot it, I can shoot it till it makes her gack!  
And her name is  
A-are-t-I  
F-I-see, I cry  
A-l, don't be shy!  
Artificial rhonda  
With the plastic pie
