Cowboys on the road tonight,  
Crying in their sleep,  
If I was a hungry man,  
With a gun in my hand and some promises to keep.  
  
Wanted to change the world,  
Watch as easy as murder,  
Its all headlights and vapor trails,  
And circle K killers.  
  
And I know I could look at anyone but you now,  
I could fall into the eyes of anyone but you now, now, now, now  
So come on, come on, come on, oh come on through now,  
Come on, come on, come on now come on through now.  
  
[Chorus]  
This is a list of what I should have been  
But I'm not.  
This is a list of the things that I should have seen,  
But I'm not seeing.  
  
Look in your eyes as these fingertips slip on your neck and make you shiver,  
I am just turning away from where I should have been  
Because I am not anything!  
Oh! anything...  
Oh!  
  
The president is in bed tonight,  
But he can't catch his sleep.  
Cause all the cowboys on the radio,  
Are killers.  
And I am gonna leave fuel of you cause you never  
Make her feel like anything,  
She said I want him to feel a thing  
But I can feel, I can't feel.  
  
I know I could look at anyone but you now  
I could fall into the arms of anyone but you now, now, now, now.  
So come on, come on, come on, come on oh come on through now,  
Come on, come on, come on oh come on through now.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Look in your eyes as these fingers on slip in your dress and make you shiver.  
I am just turning away from what I shouldn't see,  
Because I am not anything!  
Oh! Anything...  
Oh!

Everyone's is in bed tonight,  
But nobody can sleep,  
Cause all the satellites,  
Are watching through our windows.  
  
She says she doesn't love me,  
Like-but shes acting- but its just,  
If she isn't talking,  
Mr. Lincoln's head is bleeding,  
On a front row while she's speaking.  
  
I said come all you cowboys,  
All you blue-eyed baby boys,  
Oh come on all you dashing gentlemen  
Of summer.  
  
I'll wait for you,  
And Saturday's a memory,  
And Sunday comes to gather me,  
Into the arms of God and welcome me  
Cause I believe, I believe.  
  
And I know I could look at anyone but you now,  
I could fall into the eyes of anyone but you now, now, now, now  
So come on, come on, come on,oh come on through now,  
Come on, come on, come on oh come on through now.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You look in me... and so please won't you look at me,  
Cause I am not seeing you  
Look at me,  
I want to make you, look at me,  
Or I am not anything!!  
Oh! anything...  
No!, no!,  
No, no.
