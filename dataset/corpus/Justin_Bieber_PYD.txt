All way down yeah (Pyd pyd pyd)  
Cause I've been doing forensics on your body in this club  
And I can tell the way you walk your body ain't been touched the right way  
It seems your man been treating you like a step-child  
Sub him out, sub me in  
And I'm gonna get on the floor and shut the whole game down  
Until I hear you cheering babe  
Have you spelling out my name babe  
See I wanna give you all my love  
Be your dope man in the bedroom  
You can make me your drug, babe  
And it don't make no sense to be that bad, oh no, baby
