I, I should know  
You shouldn't have to tell me  
Sometimes it's the way we feel  
Or the way we feel we feel-  
Pretty bad  
In a double dare  
He's got wandering eyes  
And I see 'em look at you  
Looking straight at you-  
But I know where they are  
I'll walk you home  
You take as long as it takes  
The sun in the morning sky,  
In the morning sky we'll know where we are  
We'll know where we are
