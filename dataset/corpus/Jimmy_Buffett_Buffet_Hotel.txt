Well the train slipped into the station  
A worn out steel blue soul  
A relic from colonial days  
When the French were still in control  
Lorsque les Francais et tous jour en controle  
  
It's an outpost in transition  
Where the faithful in the bar  
Know from the whistle and the squeaking wheels  
That the next stop is Dakar  
La prochaine etape etait Dakar  
  
Talk on the radio  
Talk on the street  
Talk of men with money loco from the heat  
  
Talk about the rail band  
Picking up the beat  
We lit that great reunion  
With the headlights on the jeep  
  
And there's history on the jukebox  
Where the spies and scoundrels dwell  
It was the place to go in Bamako  
Direction Buffet Hotel  
Direction Buffet Hotel  
  
Now we're lost in the Sahara  
Four hours north of Tombuktu  
Lookin' for a nomad who knows  
Or maybe some wondering Jew  
Allons a Essakane, Syndou  
  
Then we heard that Tuareg combo  
We had come so very far  
And we were welcomed out of history  
By the wind the sand and the stars  
Jai commence a le piercevoir  
  
Sand in the couscous  
Sand in the wine  
There was sand in my guitar case  
Stories in my mind  
  
Machine guns on the hilltop  
Camels in my tent  
Buried in a sandstorm  
As the music came and went  
  
Well we crawled out of that desert  
And the storm erased our tracks  
The Sahara showed her heart to us  
And then she took it back  
  
We owned Buffet Hotel  
Said, nous avons eu Buffet Hotel  
Ce soir  
Tu la monde  
  
I recall diplomats and hookers  
I saw strangers digging wells  
And for that one great night in Bamako  
We owned Buffet Hotel  
Said, nous avons eu Buffet Hotel
