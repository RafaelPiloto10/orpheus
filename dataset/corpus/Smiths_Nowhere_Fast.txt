I'd like to drop my trousers to the world  
I am a man of means (of slender means)  
Each household appliance  
Is like a new science in my town  
And if the day came when I felt a  
Natural emotion  
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump  
In the ocean  
And when a train goes by  
It's such a sad sound  
No...  
It's such a sad thing  
  
I'd like to drop my trousers to the Queen  
Every sensible child will know what this means  
The poor and the needy  
Are selfish and greedy on her terms  
And if the day came when I felt a  
Natural emotion  
I'd get such a shock I'd probably jump  
In the ocean  
And when a train goes by  
It's such a sad sound  
No...  
It's such a sad thing  
  
And when I'm lying in my bed  
I think about life  
And I think about death  
And neither one particularly appeals to me  
And if the day came when I felt a  
Natural emotion  
I'd get such a shock I'd probably lie  
In the middle of the street and die  
I'd lie down and die...  
Oh, oh
