I feel so lonely when I'm not with you  
It's such a shame that I'm spending my time  
Without you  
Yet I have found you're from a different world  
It must be Venus cause love's such a prime time  
With you, girl  
Don't you understand  
We ride on a space-ship out of control,  
How sublime  
Who's breaking who's heart first  
You say you can't do it, mama  
Yes you can  
It's so easy to do  
By giving me less of your love than you have (hold) in your heart  
My baby,  
Just one little kiss from your lips  
Is enough for a light year or more in love  
You're breaking my heart  
Each night that I don't get enough  
Each night, and I can't get enough of you  
Each night and I can't get enough of you  
Each night and I can't get enough
