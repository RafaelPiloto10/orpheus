On the edge  
Windowsill  
Ponders his maker  
Ponders his will  
To the street below  
He just ain't nothin'  
But he's got a great view  
  
And he sinks the needle Deep  
Can't touch the bottom  
In too deep  
Can't touch the bottom oh  
  
On the edge  
Of a know-nothin' town  
Feelin' quite superior  
The aged come  
To the sky above  
He just ain't nothin'  
But he's got a great view  
  
And he sinks the burning knife Deep  
Can't touch the bottom  
In too deep  
Can't touch the bottom  
In too deep  
  
On the edge of a  
Christmas clean love  
Young virgin here from heaven  
Visiting, yeah  
To the man above her  
She just ain't nothin'  
She doesn't like the view [Repeats]  
  
But he sinks himself deep.  
Can't touch the bottom  
In too deep  
Can't touch the bottom  
Can't touch the bottom  
In too deep, yeah  
  
Can't touch the bottom  
  
Can't touch the bottom  
The bottom
