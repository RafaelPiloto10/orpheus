Here is a song  
It reminds me of when we were young  
Looking back at all the things we've done  
You gotta keep on, keepin' on  
  
Out to sea, it's the only place I honestly  
Can't get myself some piece of mind  
You know it's getting hard to fly  
  
If I'm to fall  
Would you be there to applaud?  
Or would you hide behind them all?  
Cause if I have to go,  
In my heart you grow  
And that's where you belong  
  
If I'm to fall  
Would you be there to applaud?  
Or would you hide behind them all?  
Cause if I have to go,  
In my heart you'll grow  
And that's where you belong  
  
If I'm to fall  
Would you be there to applaud?  
Or would you hide behind them all?  
Cause if I have to go  
In my heart you'll grow  
And that's where you belong  
  
Guess I'm outta time  
I'm outta time  
I'm outta time  
I'm outta time  
I'm outta time
