I Get Up  
  
Now don't try to change me,  
I am what I am,  
And I do what I want,  
The best way that I can.  
  
Now I'm wondering if you're happy,  
'Cause if you want to make it true,  
Oh, baby, this is what you do.  
  
[Chorus]  
I get up, I get up and,  
What're you going to say,  
I get up, I get up and,  
What're you going to do,  
I get up, I get up and,  
There's no walking away,  
I get up, I get up and.  
  
Now I've got the feeling,  
I've been living a dream,  
But it don't really matter,  
'Cause it ain't all it seems.  
  
Now you don't have to worry,  
To have a good time,  
Oh, baby, this is what you do.  
  
[Chorus]  
I get up, I get up and,  
What're you going to say,  
I get up, I get up and,  
What're you going to do,  
I get up, I get up and,  
There's no walking away,  
I get up, I get up and.  
  
  
Radio,  
Television,  
Politics,  
And old religion,  
All around the world,  
Troubling strides,  
Believe me when I tell you,  
I don't need your advice.  
  
I get high,  
I get low,  
I don't wanna die,  
Fuck it all,  
I've gotta get up,  
I've gotta get out,  
I've gotta get out,  
I get up.  
  
[Repeat chorus]  
  
There's no walking away,  
Oh, this is what you do.  
  
I get up, I get up and,  
Get up, get up now,  
I get up, I get up and,  
All around the world,  
I get up, I get up and,  
This is what you do,  
I get up, I get up and,  
All around the world,  
I get up, I get up and,  
Oh, this is what you do,  
I get up, I get up and,  
You get up, get up,  
You get up.
