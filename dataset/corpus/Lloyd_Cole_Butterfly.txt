You were an innocent child before I laid my hands on you  
And all that pain that you held inside  
Was just waiting to bloom in a darkened room  
And you just flew right into the light and came alive  
My little butterfly  
  
Well you'd never known love and you'd never known pain  
But you found out that they were just like wine and champagne  
You could drink a little more, then you hurt a little less  
And you get that butterfly feeling underneath your dress  
And your promises will turn into lies  
Then you will fly  
My little butterfly  
  
Now I'm lying here babe on your side of the bed  
And I've got unclean thoughts flying through my head  
And I'm thinking about love, yes I'm thinking about pain  
And I'm thinking about some way that I might feel good again  
Yes I'm thinking about my little butterfly
