I want to learn what life is for  
I don't want much, I just want more  
Ask what I want and I will sing  
I want everything (everything)  
  
I'd cure the cold and the traffic jam  
If there were floods, I'd give a dam  
I'd never sleep, I'd only sing  
Let me do everything (everything)  
  
I'd like to plan a city, play the cello  
Play at Monte Carlo, play Othello  
Move into the white house, paint it yellow  
Speak Portuguese and dutch  
  
And if it's not too much  
I'd like to have the perfect twin  
One who'd go out as I came in  
I've got to grab the big brass ring  
So I'll have everything (everything)  
  
I'm like a child who's set free  
At the fun fair  
Every ride invites me  
And it's unfair  
  
Saying that I only  
Get my one share  
Doesn't seem just  
I could live as I must  
  
If they'd  
Give me the time to turn a tide  
Give me the truth if once I lied  
Give me the man who's gonna bring  
  
More of everything  
Then I'll have everything  
Everything
