Pull all your hair up  
Dab on the make-up  
Trying hard to look so pristine  
Like a face in a magazine  
Those fancy dressers and  
Media pressure  
Have got you feeling so plain and small  
If you don't look like a paper doll  
  
In a world where the goal is  
To be like the Joneses  
It's guaranteed to drive you wild  
Keeping up with the latest style  
  
Gaze in the mirror  
You want the glamour  
And the grace of a movie star  
But I like you the way you are  
  
You are the only one I'm dreaming of  
Cause baby don't you know that I love  
  
[Chorus]  
You, girl  
You don't have to be picture perfect  
To be in my world  
Girl  
You don't have to be picture perfect  
To fit the frame  
  
You're tender, you're tactful  
Girl, you're a natural  
You possess a heart that's true  
That's what I like about you  
  
One in a million  
Yea, that's a given  
There's a beauty inside of you  
And it show on the outside too  
  
No competition, you're way in the lead  
And baby, don't you know that I need  
  
[Chorus]
