I'll walk across a river without any thought  
So it for you baby  
  
Just as long as you are there my love  
Just a long as you are there  
  
I'll go up to the mountain  
Go into the sea  
Gonna save you baby  
Alright you and me  
Just as long as you are there  
  
Just as long as you are there my love  
Just a long as you are there  
  
Boy you know I won't be far  
And if you call me I'll be there  
And we'll leave all our troubles behind  
As I walk through life I see that life  
Has taken me through so many changes  
But as long as we can learn to love  
I know everything's gonna be alright  
So take hold of my hand baby  
  
Just as long as you are there my love  
Just a long as you are there  
  
So baby just call me  
And you know that I'll be there  
And you don't have to beg or plead  
Just call my name  
  
I'll walk across the river  
I'll walk across the water
