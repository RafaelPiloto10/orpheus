I'm a man  
And I just want to live like one  
Why must I fight for what I've won  
I'm weary  
And it's more than I can stand  
I'm a man  
  
I wanna hold my head up high  
I'm flesh and blood and I got pride  
Can't they see it?  
Will they ever understand  
I'm a man  
  
How do I hide the tears in my eyes  
When I go to tell my son  
The things he's heard  
Are no more than lies  
He's as good as anyone  
I'm a man  
  
And soon the day is gonna come  
When I'll be free to live like one  
Then I'll stand tall  
And be seen for what I am  
I'm a man  
I'm a man  
I'm a man
