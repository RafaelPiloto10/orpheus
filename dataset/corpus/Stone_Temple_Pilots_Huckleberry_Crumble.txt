Less conversation  
No moral obligation  
To tell me how you feeling tonight, (Right)  
Minds over racin'  
Visions got me shakin'  
Motor station changing your mind  
(Mind, mind, mind)  
  
I see what's at the ending of the rat trap  
Lady Jabberwocky's eatin' bed bugs  
The rabbit dug a hole straight through to China  
So where do we go?  
And where is the rabbit's hole?  
  
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yeah  
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yeah  
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yeah  
I'm feeling like I'm sinking in  
I'm moving in  
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away  
  
Ol' Tom Turtles  
A hustler and a cousin  
His lizard-like complexion ain't right  
Motor city's moving  
There's big business groovin'  
He's a number one per-center tonight  
  
(Right on  
Right on  
Right on  
Right on)  
  
I see what's at the ending of the rat trap  
Lady Jabberwocky's eatin' bed bugs  
The rabbit dug a hole straight through to China  
So where do we go?  
And where is the rabbit's hole?  
  
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yeah  
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yeah  
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yeah  
I'm feeling like I'm sinking in  
  
Don't let the grip on this subside  
Chips will only grow one shoulder at a time  
The lessons of our lessons of our lives  
And forget about the troubles for a time, time, time, time  
  
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yeah  
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yeah  
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away, yeah  
I'm feeling like I'm sinking in  
I'm moving in  
I'm feeling like I'm pulling away  
  
I see what's at the ending of the rat trap
