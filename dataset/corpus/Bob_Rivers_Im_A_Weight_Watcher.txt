I'm a Weight Watcher,  
I'm a Weight Watcher,  
Watchin' food go by.  
My, my, my.  
I'm a Weight Watcher,  
I'm a plate watcher.  
Here comes a cream pie  
Mmmm, mmm, mmm.  
I was just a boy  
When I tried to eat my toy.  
Couldn't reacy my toes  
To put my shoes on.  
But now I'm 28,  
I'm big, fat, and overweight.  
I've got a new pastime to chew on.  
I'm a Weight Watcher,  
I'm a plate watcher.  
Watchin' food go by,  
My, my, my.  
Plate of cheese nachos.  
I gotta watch those.  
Here come some now.  
Mmm, mm, mmm, mmm, mmm.  
Oh, no, none for me, thanks.  
Watchin' my figure.  
Oh, they look delicious.  
No, no, no, no.  
Oh, they smell good, too.  
Mmm...I shouldn't, I really shouldn't.  
You make these yourself?  
Well, maybe just two.
