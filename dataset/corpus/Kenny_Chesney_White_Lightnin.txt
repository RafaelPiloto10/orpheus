White Lightnin'  
(Written by S. Wooley)  
  
Well in North Carolina, way back in the hills  
Lived my old pappy and he had him a still  
He brewed white lightnin' 'til the sun went down  
Then he'd fill him a jug and he'd pass it around  
Mighty, mighty pleasin, pappy's corn squeezin'  
Whshhhoooh. .. White lightnin'  
  
[Chorus:]  
Well the "G" men "T" men revenuers, too  
Searchin' for the place where he made his brew  
They were looking, tryin to book him,  
But my pappy kept a-cookin'  
Whshhhoooh. .. White lightnin'  
  
Well I asked my old pappy why he called his brew  
White lightnin' 'stead of mountain dew  
I took a little sip and right away I knew  
As my eyes bugged out and my face turned blue  
Thunder started flashin', lightnin' started clashin'...  
Whshhhoooh. .. White lightnin'  
  
(Repeat chorus)  
  
Well a city slicker came and he said "I'm tough"  
I think I wanna taste that powerful stuff  
He took one slug and drank it on down  
And I heard him a moanin' as he hit the ground  
Thunder started flashin', lightnin started clashin'  
Mmmmm.... White lightnin'  
  
(repeat chorus)
