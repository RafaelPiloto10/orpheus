[Intro]  
(Come On) I wanna dance in the dark  
(Come On) We gonna light up the night  
(Come On) I wanna dance in the dark  
(Come On) We gonna light up the night  
  
[Verse 1]  
Underdogs dance in the middle of the night  
Can see the night skies in the mirror of your eyes  
If you don't dance make sure you got the rhythm  
Make sure that your heartbeat beats with the rhythm  
I wanna run wild in the middle of the night  
Right under the moon, bodies glowing in the night  
Nothing in between our skins but the rhythm  
Make sure that your heartbeat beats with the rhythm  
The night-time is the right time  
  
[Chorus x2]  
I wanna dance in the dark and never stop  
We gonna light up the night like shooting stars  
Whenever you hear the sound don't be alarmed  
Move move move  
Dancing in the dark  
  
[Verse 2]  
Underdogs dance in the middle of the night  
Out here with the stars like the creatures of the night  
If you don't dance make sure you got the rhythm  
Make sure that your heartbeat beats with the rhythm  
I wanna dance fast in the middle of the night  
And see the night skies in the mirror of your eyes  
If you don't dance make sure you got the rhythm  
Make sure that your heartbeat beats with the rhythm  
The night-time is the right time  
  
[Chorus x2]  
I wanna dance in the dark and never stop  
We gonna light up the night like shooting stars  
Whenever you hear the sound don't be alarmed  
Move move move  
Dancing in the dark  
  
[Bridge]  
I wanna dance in the dark (come on)  
We gonna light up the night (come on)  
I wanna dance in the dark (come on)  
We gonna light up the night  
  
[Chorus x2]  
I wanna dance in the dark and never stop  
We gonna light up the night like shooting stars  
Whenever you hear the sound don't be alarmed  
Move move move  
Dancing in the dark
