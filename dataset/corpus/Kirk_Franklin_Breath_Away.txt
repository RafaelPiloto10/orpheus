Chorus  
Jesus Your love  
Takes my breath away  
I can't get You off my mind  
I think about You night and day  
When the tears fell from my eyes  
You caught 'em in the nick of time  
Oh Jesus Your love  
Takes my  
Breath away  
  
Verse 1  
Jesus Your love  
Takes my breath away  
It feels like sunshine  
When I have a cloudy day  
It's a feeling that I can't explain  
All I have to do is just call Your name  
Oh Jesus Your love  
Takes my  
Breath away  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 2  
Jesus Your love  
Is like a sweet melody (swee-de-de-de-deeeee)  
I get joy when I think about all the You've done for me  
No other love can compare  
When I needed You  
You were there  
Oh Jesus Your love  
Takes my  
Breath away  
  
Chorus  
  
I can't breathe (can't breathe)  
I can't sing (can't sing)  
I can't live (can't live)  
No no (no no)  
I can't walk (can't walk)  
I can't talk (can't talk)  
Without Your love (without Your love) Without Your love  
I can't walk (can't walk)  
I can't talk (can't talk)  
Without Your love (without Your love)  
  
Chorus
