I blink my eyes and then it happens again  
I lose my way but I discover a friend  
It's a typical day on the road to utopia  
  
I walk along until my feet are sore  
I rest a minute then I walk some more  
There's no time to delay on the road to utopia  
  
And my destination is the unknown  
But I'm never far away from my home  
  
It shines like laser light  
It's in my dreams at night  
'cause I've been all my life  
On the road to utopia  
  
I will be there to share your tragedy  
I know that you would do the same for me  
It's no trouble at all on the road to utopia  
  
When day is over and I'm trying to sleep  
It comes so easy 'cause I'm not counting sheep  
I am counting the smiles on the road to utopia  
  
And I may lose my way again and again  
But I'll cross that borderline in the end  
  
Trouble trouble trouble whirling all about  
But if we stick together we can stick it out  
Will we ever find the loves we lost again  
Does this crazy journey ever have an end  
  
And will I find what I'm after  
Do I know what I'm after  
Guess I'll join in the laughter  
On the road to utopia
