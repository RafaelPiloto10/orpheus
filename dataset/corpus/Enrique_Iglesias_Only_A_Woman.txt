Only a woman can take away your cold hard chill  
Break your heart and make you love her still  
Leave you thirsty when you've had your fill  
  
Only a woman can sit you high up on a throne  
Make you feel so damn alone  
Leave you begging baby come back home  
  
And it's only till she's gone  
Could you see that you were wrong  
  
'Cause the seasons change and people come and go  
But when love is fate best hold that woman close  
Take the hard road back and fall down at her door  
'Cause that's your woman  
That's all I know  
  
Only a woman can make you fly so high you wanna touch the sun  
When your wings melt and you come undone  
Catches you when you fall, she's the only one  
  
She steals your heart just like a thief  
Makes you lay roses at your feet  
But you know to kiss the rose, the thorns will make you bleed  
  
And it's only till she's gone  
Could you see that you were wrong  
  
'Cause the seasons change and people come and go  
But when love is fate best hold that woman close  
Take the hard road back and fall down at her door  
'Cause that's your woman  
That's all I know  
  
You thank God you found her  
can't live your life without her  
And every little thing about her is all you need  
All you need  
  
'Cause the seasons change and people come and go  
But when love is fate best hold that woman close  
Take the hard road back and fall down at her door  
'Cause that's your woman  
That's all I know, only a woman  
Only a woman
