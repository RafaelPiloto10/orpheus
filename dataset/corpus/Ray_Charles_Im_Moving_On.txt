I warned you baby from time to time  
But you just wouldn't listen  
Now pay me no mind  
So I'm movin' on, I'm rollin' on  
You've broken your vow and it's all over now  
So I'm movin' on  
  
That big eight-wheeler rollin' down the track  
Means your true lovin' daddy ain't comin' back  
'Cause I'm movin' on, I'm rollin' on  
You were flyin' too high for my little sky  
So I'm movin' on  
  
Some day baby when you had you play  
Your gonna want your daddy but your daddy will say  
Keep on movin', keep rollin' on  
I'm through with you, too bad you're blue  
'Cause I'm movin' on  
  
Mister Engineer take the throttle in hand  
And take me down to that southern land  
Keep movin' on, keep rollin' on  
You can ease my mind if you get me there on time  
Move on  
  
Mister Fireman, won't you please listen to me  
'Cause I got a pretty woman in Tennessee  
Keep movin' on, keep rollin' on  
She's fine as can be and she's waitin' on me  
Keep movin' on  
  
I'm gonna move, I'm gonna move  
I'm gonna move, I'm gonna move  
Whoa move, whoa move  
Whoa move, whoa move on  
Keep on movin', everyday, everynight  
And all the time baby  
  
I'm gonna move on, I'm gonna move on  
Yeah, gonna move, I'm gonna move on now  
I'm gonna move on, I'm gonna move
