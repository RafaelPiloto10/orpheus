Beautiful Dream  
  
I had a dream I was living by the ocean  
I had a dream I was living in the sun  
I wake up sad because I'm living in darkness  
I know I'm not alone  
I know I'm not the only one  
  
I had a dream that I had no depression  
I had a dream I had a smile on my face  
I wake up hungry so I feed my obsession  
I know I gotta leave  
I know I gotta run away  
  
Far away  
Where the faces all look happy and I know it's a dream  
A beautiful dream  
I want to loose myself in the sunshine where I can be free  
Yeah I just wanna be free  
Free in a beautiful dream  
Yeah but it's a beautiful dream  
  
I had a dream I was living by the ocean  
I had a dream I was living for the day  
I wake up sad in a perpetual emotion  
I know I gotta leave here  
I know I gotta run away  
  
Far away  
Where the faces all look happy and I know it's a dream  
A beautiful dream  
I want to loss myself in myself where I can be free  
I just wanna be free  
Free in a beautiful dream  
Yeah a beautiful dream  
Free inside a beautiful dream  
Free in a beautiful dream
