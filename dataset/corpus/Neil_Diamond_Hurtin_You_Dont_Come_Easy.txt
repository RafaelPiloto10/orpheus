I stopped askin' why  
Girl, the well's gone dry  
Time to say the words I'm sayin'  
And hurtin' you don't come easy  
  
God only knows,  
Hurtin' you don't come easy  
But I need to go  
Thought we had it once  
  
But what was once, was once  
Time can change  
Both dreams and dreamers  
And hurtin' you don't come easy  
  
God only knows  
Hurtin' you don't come easy  
But I need to go  
I need to find what I ain't found  
  
I'll may be lookin' for it  
'Til the last day I'm alive  
Don't ask me what I'll do  
Don't ask me where I'm bound  
  
I just know I'm not alive  
Unless I can get up and try  
And hurtin' you don't come easy  
God only knows  
  
Hurtin' you don't come easy  
But I need to go.  
Hurtin' you don't come easy  
God only knows...
