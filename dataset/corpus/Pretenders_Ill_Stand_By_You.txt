Oh, why you look so sad, tears are in your eyes,  
Come on and come to me now, don't be ashamed to cry,  
Let me see you through, 'cause I've seen the dark side too.  
When the night falls on you, you don't know what to do,  
Nothing you confess could make me love you less,  
  
I'll stand by you,  
I'll stand by you, won't let nobody hurt you,  
I'll stand by you  
  
So if you're mad, get mad, don't hold it all inside,  
Come on and talk to me now.  
Hey there, what you got to hide?  
I get angry too, well, I'm a lot like you.  
When you're standing at the crossroads,  
And don't know which path to choose,  
Let me come along, 'cause even if you're wrong  
  
I'll stand by you,  
I'll stand by you, won't let nobody hurt you,  
I'll stand by you.  
Baby, even to your darkest hour, and I'll never desert you,  
I'll stand by you.  
And when, when the night falls on you baby,  
You're feeling all alone, won't be on your own,  
I'll stand by you.  
  
I'll stand by you, won't let nobody hurt you,  
I'll stand by you, baby even to your darkest hour,  
And I'll never desert you,  
I'll stand by you,  
  
I'll stand by you.  
I'll stand by you, won't let nobody hurt you,  
I'll stand by you, baby even to your darkest hour,  
And I'll never desert you  
I'll stand by you
