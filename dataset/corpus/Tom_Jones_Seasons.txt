Summer's gone  
It could not stay  
It ran it's path  
It's yesterday  
  
Like a moment's fire  
That lost it's burn  
It fade it fast  
And wont return  
  
[Chorus]  
So I walk on  
And make my memories  
And hope is not gone  
Because I still believe  
There's a reason for passing time  
These are the seasons of my life  
  
I've long for spring  
And the winter's cold  
I felt the sing  
Of the unknown  
My frozen heart  
Held me bound  
Until the time  
It turn around  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There more I live  
Then more I grows  
No more than this is  
Is all I know  
For time as run  
But I don't mind  
For life's begone  
Once more inside  
  
[Chorus]
