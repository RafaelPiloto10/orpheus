Here in the studio,  
As they're turning down the lights,  
I lick my lips to start the first line -  
How can this girl be me?  
"Oh, little thing, are you looking lost?"  
The vertigo, the need to lose. "  
Ooh, ooh...  
They try to put me on the tapes begin to spin,  
I feel a little sick and hope my notes are in,  
I try to put it all in, do it for you,  
Don't even know you but I need you to love me, too.

Don't even know you but I need you to love me, too.  
Scares me silly, but it gets me going,  
Like a Romeo.  
Scares me silly, but it gets me going,  
Like a Romeo.  
Scares me silly, but it gets me going.  
Swimming amid the cans  
I wonder can I goad myself into another take,  
And keep the mood?  
It's like a film - such balance.  
I close my eyes to the cello solo and ache,  
The music will never let me blow away you-oo.  
You know the feeling when you're on the right track.  
You fall in love and you're never gonna turn it back.  
It's a part of you, they're so sensitive,  
Oozing without me, filling over with secrets.

Scares me silly, but it gets me going,  
Like a Romeo.  
Scares me silly, but it gets me going,

Scares me silly, but it gets me going.
