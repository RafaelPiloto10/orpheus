(Original by Ryan Adams )  
  
Well night time let her through  
Yeah I am talking to you  
I wanna see her  
Precious little thing  
With eyes that dance around without their clothes  
So buy a pretty dress  
Wear it out tonight  
For anyone you think could out do me  
Or better still, be my winding wheel  
Cause I feel just like a map  
Without a single place to go of interest  
And I am further north than south  
If I could shut my mouth she'd probably like this  
So buy a pretty dress  
And wear it out tonight  
For all the boys you think could out do me  
Or better still, be my winding wheel  
Be my winding wheel  
Well the children laugh and sing a song that ushers in her driving rain  
And I am standing in the station like some old record waiting on a train  
So buy a pretty dress  
Wear it out tonight  
For anyone you think could out do me  
Or better still be my winding wheel  
Be my winding wheel
