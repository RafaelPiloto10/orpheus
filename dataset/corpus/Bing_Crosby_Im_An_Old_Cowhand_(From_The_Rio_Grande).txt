I'm an old cowhand from the Rio Grande  
But my legs ain't bowed and my cheeks ain't tan  
I'm a cowboy who never saw a cow  
Never roped a steer cause I don't know how  
Sure ain't a fixing to start in now  
Yippie yi yo kayah  
  
I'm an old cowhand and I come down from the Rio Grande  
And I learned to ride, ride, ride 'fore I learned to stand  
I'm a riding fool who is up to date  
I know every trail in the Lone Star State  
Cause I ride the range in a Ford V-8  
Yippie yi yo kayah  
  
We're old cowhands from the Rio Grande  
And we come to town just to hear the band  
We know all the songs that the cowboys know  
'Bout the big corral where the doggies go  
We learned them all on the radio  
Yippie yi yo kayah  
  
I'm an old cowhand  
Oh yes, Mr. Bing.  
Too hot for you, Uncle Fudd?  
Down from the Rio Grande  
Oh where the west is wild all around the borderland  
Where the buffalo roam around the zoo  
and the Injuns run up a rug or two  
and the old Bar X is just a barbecue, yeah  
Yippie yi yo kayah  
  
I'm a pioneer who began from scratch  
I don't bat an eye in a shootin' match.  
They don't call me Elmer, they call me Satch.  
Yippie yi yo kayah  
Yippie yi yo kayah  
  
Get along little horsy  
Get along little horsy  
Yippie yi yo kayah, oh!
