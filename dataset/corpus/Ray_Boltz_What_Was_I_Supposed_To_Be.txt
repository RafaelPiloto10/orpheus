Jesus walked upon the earth,  
On the shores of Galilee,  
He'd say to His disciples,  
Let the little children come to me,  
I wonder if up in heaven,  
Do you suppose we'll see  
Little children asking  
What was I supposed to be.  
Chorus  
What was I supposed to be,  
What were my eyes supposed to see,  
And why did I taste of death  
Before I even drew a breath,  
Laid my head at my mother's breast,  
To sleep.  
Oh Jesus,  
Chorus  
Was I to be a prophet  
Used in the ministry,  
A doctor who would find a cure  
For some terrible disease,  
Even if I'd been born imperfect  
Why couldn't my parents see,  
That I'd have been made perfect  
When you came back for me.  
Oh Jesus  
Chorus  
Oh Jesus, what was I supposed to be,  
Oh Jesus, what was I supposed to be
