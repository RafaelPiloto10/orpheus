Party all night like yayer (yayer)

Make me want to take it da yer

The next wop until the early morn  
I need that crunk when I'm up in tha club  
Even my when my chevy pull up on them dubs  
Give me that drop yellow waist like a drug  
Lil mama hot and she might show me love  
O hot damn  
Celebrate to tha A.M.  
I love it so much it got me sayin  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Oh hot damn, this is my jam  
Keep me partying till the A.M.  
Y'all don't understand, make me throw my hands  
In the ayer, ay-ayer, ayer, ay-ayer

Like I'm at a ball game do my thang  
Hands up high I got money in tha bank

Rock it no stop it how I got my name  
Baby keep poppin you might get tha fame  
Walk tha red carpet wont see you the same

Shorty go ahead and get bare (bare)  
We aint gonna treat our city like the mayor (mayor)
