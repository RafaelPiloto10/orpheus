What do you want from me  
When will you ever see  
I gave it all nothing less  
The feeling ain't mutual I guess  
Why am I so confused  
Why do I feel so used  
This game at hand was made for two  
But somehow I played without you  
  
No I'm not sad  
Nothin' lasts forever  
Head over heels  
Better late than never  
  
[Chorus]  
My heart is on the line  
Running out of time  
Love stop making a fool out of me  
My heart is on the line  
Running out of time  
Love stop making a fool out of me  
  
Telling my friends you're fine  
Even our favorite wine  
But you're not there and it hurts  
Nobody knows how it hurts  
Maybe I thought I knew  
That I belonged to you  
I dreamed a dream I couldn't have  
I foolishly let myself dance  
Inside your eyes  
Oh don't be sad  
I should've known better  
Why didn't I realize  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love stop making a fool out of me  
Love stop making a fool out of me  
  
Whenever you call me up  
Everything else must stop  
My heart says stay but I go  
Cause I need you and you know  
You're inside of me  
I want you now and forever  
Come on back to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My heart is on the line  
Running out of time  
Love stop making a clown out of me  
Love stop making a fool out of me  
Love stop making a clown out of me  
Love stop making a fool out of me
