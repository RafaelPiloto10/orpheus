When you wish upon a star  
Don't let yourself fall fall in too hard  
I fell into you and I'm on my back  
An insect decaying in your little trap  
I squirm into you now I'm in your gut  
I fell into you now I'm in a rut  
"I lift you up like the sweetest angel  
I'll tear you down like a whore.  
I will bury your god in my warm spit  
You'll be deformed in your porn"  
Rock star yeah (you're such a dirty, dirty)  
Rock star, yeah (dirty, dirty, dirty)  
You eat up my heart and all the little parts  
Your star is so sharp  
It leaves me jagged holes  
I make myself sick just to poison you  
If I can't have you then no one will  
  
You are the one I want and what I want is so unreal  
I'm such a dirty Rock star yeah  
(I am the one you want and the one you want is so unreal)
