Lately (I've been watching you)  
Been thinkin' 'bout you baby  
(and everything you do)  
Just sittin' away watching the days go by  
Just sittin' away watching the days go by  
  
Have you ever felt a breeze hit hard,  
Like the wind was blowing it apart  
As you're spinning like a merry-go-round,  
Indications of a storm touching down  
Wish that I can wear the rain and storm,  
But I guess it was heart break from the norm  
Was a day I will always remember,  
The saddest day in sweet November  
  
Lately (I've been watching you) been thinkin' 'bout you baby  
(And everything you do)  
Just sittin' away watching the days go by (2x)  
  
Baby I'm on my knees praying God help me please,  
Bring my baby back, right back to me  
If lovin' you was right then I don't want to go wrong  
So I drown myself with tears,  
Sittin' here, singin' another sad love song  
  
Lately (I've been watching you) been thinkin 'bout you baby  
(And everything you do)  
Just sittin' away watching the days go by  
Just sittin' away watching the days go by  
  
Lately I've been torn apart,  
I wish you hadn't broke my heart  
I'm missin' you babe,  
Missin' you every day  
Lately I've been torn apart,  
I wish you hadn't broke my heart  
I'm missin' you babe,  
Missin' you every day  
Lately (i've been watching you) been thinkin 'bout you baby  
(And everything you do)  
Just sittin away watching the days go by  
Just sittin away watching the days go by
