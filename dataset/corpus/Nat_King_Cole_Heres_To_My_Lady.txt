Here's to my lady, here's a toast to my lady,  
And all that my lady means to me!  
Like a hearth in the winter, a breeze in the summer,  
A spring to remember is she!  
  
Though the years may grow colder as people grow older,  
It's shoulder to shoulder we'll be!  
But be it sunshine or shady, here's my love to my lady,  
I pray may she always love me!
