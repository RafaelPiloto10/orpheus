If you can see me I can see you  
  
I could wear your new blue shoes  
I should wear your old red dress  
And walk to the crossroads  
So take this knife  
And meet me across the river  
  
Just shoots and ladders and this is the kiss  
American ?  
From nowhere to nothing  
And I go way back  
  
Children swarm like thousands of bugs  
Towards the lights the beacons above the hill  
The stars to the West, the South, the North and to the East  
  
Now you could say I've got a gift of sorts  
A fear of rear windows and swinging doors  
A love of violence and dread of sighs  
  
If you can see me I can see you  
If you can see me I can see you  
  
I have seen these bairns wave their fists at God  
Swear to destroy the beasts, stamping the ground  
In their excitement for tomorrow  
I could wear your new blue shoes  
I should wear your old red dress  
And walk to the crossroads  
So take this knife  
And meet me across the river  
  
I will take your lands and all that lays beneath  
The dust of cold flowers, prison of dark of ashes  
I will slaughter your kind who descend from belief  
I am the spirit of greed, a lord of theft  
I'll burn all your books and the problems they make  
  
If you can see me I can see you  
If you can see me.
