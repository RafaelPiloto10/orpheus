Mary, sweet Mary, your heart overflows  
Deep in the night, child, a babe is born.  
Sacred and holy, blameless and pure,  
Mary, sweet Mary, tonight your child is born.  
Mary, sweet Mary, so strong, yet so frail  
Carried a baby sent to save the world.  
Wise men still seek Him and find in Him  
Peace.  
Mary, sweet Mary, tonight your King is born.  
Bridge:  
All of the angels danced as heaven sang  
All of the earth stood so still and so peacefully.  
Mary, sweet Mary, God's precious child  
Blessed redemption is found in His eyes.  
All creatures great and small,  
He came for all.  
Mary, sweet Mary, tonight your Savior's born . . .  
Mary, sweet Mary, tonight our Savior is born . . .
