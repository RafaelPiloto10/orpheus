The city in defeat,  
With no one left to beat  
There's still a fading desire  
To burn a naked light  
Just to defy the night  
  
Come on and call me a liar  
A crumble tumble down  
In fumble bumble town  
Our lives a ruin  
We reconstruct a bit  
And pretty up a bit  
We hardly know what we're doing  
  
[Chorus: ]  
But me and my baby  
Make the best of this world  
She's like a diamond  
Innocent girl  
We watch the sign of the times  
Writing on the wall, cities may fall  
  
Back through the city fog  
I was another cog  
For the machinery there  
Now the machines have gone  
The silence hanging on  
I sit, I stare  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
Come on and take your aim  
I feel the mildest pain  
Protecting something so rare  
'Cause there's a gem or two  
Inside the human zoo  
If only you are aware  
  
[Chorus: ]
