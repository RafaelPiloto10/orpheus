She's lookin' for a job and a finer place to stay,  
She's lookin' for the hope in the empty promising,  
She's workin' two jobs, keepin' alive,  
She works in a restaurant, night and day  
She waits her life away  
She wipes the tears away  
  
She cries inside every time she feels this way,  
And she's dying inside every time her baby cries, no  
  
Keepin' your head up to the sky,  
Keepin' your mind up stay alive,  
Gimme your wings so we can fly,  
(Keep your head up tonight)  
  
Keepin' your head up to the sky,  
And we can just rise up tell me now,  
Gimme your wings so we can fly  
  
Giving up the life in the birds in the trees  
And we're sucking up the air in the earth from under me,  
(It's never too late)  
I can't even breathe (to see) I can't even see,  
(Oh keep) Keep your head up don't give up today,  
How long can we wait?  
I wish that love would come today  
  
All you need is love,  
Tell you I'm know it's comin' soon,  
And all you need is just a moment, won't it do,  
Keep your head up  
  
Keepin' your head up to the sky,  
Keepin' your mind to stay alive  
Gimme your wings so we can fly,  
(fly away, fly away, fly away)  
(Keep your head up tonight)  
  
Keepin' your head up to the sky,  
And we can just rise up tell me now,  
Gimme your wings so we can fly  
(Oh why)  
  
Everybody say the time is borrowed  
And hanging down your head just ain't no good  
And if you dance and rise above tomorrow  
(Give it a chance)  
Just give yourself a chance,  
Find the circumstance,  
Rise and do it again  
  
Keepin' your head up to the sky (Oh God)  
Keepin' your mind up stay alive (Oh no)  
Gimme your wings so we can fly  
(Yeah, yeah!)  
Keepin' your head up to the sky,  
And we can just rise up tell me now  
Gimme your wings so we can fly  
  
(I needed you know, I needed you now)  
Keepin' your head up to the sky  
(I needed you night right through the day)  
Keepin' your mind just stay alive  
(I needed you now)  
Keepin' your wings so we can fly (Woo! woo!)  
(Yeah!)  
  
(I needed you know, I needed you now)  
Keepin' your head up to the sky  
(I needed you night right through the day)  
And we can just rise up tell me now  
(I needed you now)  
Keepin' your wings so we can fly (Woo! woo! woo!)  
  
Gonna shine his smile on us today  
Keep your head up  
Gonna shine his smile on us today, today  
Keep your head up  
  
Those songs gon' rise on us today, today  
Gonna shine his smile on us today, today  
  
(I needed you now, I needed you now)  
Those songs gon' rise on us today, today  
(I needed you night right through the day)  
(I needed you now)  
Gonna shine his smile on us today, today  
Keep your head up
