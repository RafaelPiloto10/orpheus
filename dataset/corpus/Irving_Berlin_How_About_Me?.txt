[1st verse:]  
Too long I held you close to my heart  
Too much I loved you right from the start  
Too soon you vanished out of my dreams  
Too late to start all over it seems  
[Refrain:]  
It's over, all over  
And soon somebody else  
Will make a fuss about you  
But how about me?  
It's over, all over  
And soon somebody else  
Will tell his friends about you  
But how about me?  
You'll find somebody new  
But what am I to do?  
I'll still remember you  
When you have forgotten  
And maybe a baby  
Will climb upon your knee  
And put its arms about you  
But how about me?  
[2nd verse:]  
Moonlight was beaming down from the skies  
Lovelight was gleaming deep in your eyes  
Sunlight for just a moment and then  
Twilight and I was lonely again  
[Alternate line:]  
Will tell the world about you
