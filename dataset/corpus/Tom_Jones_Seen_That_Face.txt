I forgot how much it hurts, to see you cry  
And just how inconsistent the world seems when you smile  
There was a little kiss in the back of the car  
Looking right at me, his eyes spells with the stars  
I felt so happy and so true  
In that moment he remind me of you  
  
I've seen that face looking back at me  
It's like a mirror reflecting everything  
A faded distant memory  
Pulling at my heart  
  
I wanna to protect to you, from any pain  
Keep you close to me, so you will always feel safe  
You know how much I love you, my sweet precious child  
I would do anything, I'll walk trough fire  
I see part of me in you,  
And when you look at me it all come shinning trough
