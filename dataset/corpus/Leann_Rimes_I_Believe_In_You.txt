You breathe, new life begins.  
You speak and my world makes  
Sense, that's how it is, when  
It comes to you.  
  
Your mercy has no end,  
You're more than just a friend.  
It amazes me  
You feel the way you do.  
  
I believe in you  
And nothin' less.  
I believe in you  
Can't help myself.  
You're all the hope,  
The reason that I need.  
  
I believe in you  
Just because,  
I don't need no one, to prove your love.  
For all that I have seen, it's easier for me  
To believe in you.  
  
You are so beautiful.  
You are the miracle,  
That dries the tears,  
Heals a wounded heart.  
And it's so clear to see  
Your hand in everything.  
You are there for me,  
There to see me through.  
  
I believe in you  
And nothin' less.  
I believe in you  
Can't help myself.  
You're all the hope,  
The reason that I need.  
  
I believe in you  
Just because,  
I don't need no one,  
To prove your love.  
For all that I have  
Seen, it's easier for me  
To believe in you.  
  
Through the fire and  
Through the rain. I know  
Your love, for me, will never ever change.  
  
I believe in you and nothin' less.  
I believe in you  
Can't help myself  
You're all the hope,  
The reason that I need.  
  
I believe in you just because,  
I don't need no one, to prove your love.  
For all I have seen, it's easier for me  
To believe in you.  
  
And nothin' less.  
I believe in you  
Can't help myself.  
You're all the hope, the reason that I need.  
  
I believe in you just because,  
I don't need no one, to prove your.  
For all that I have seen, it's easier for me  
To believe in you.  
  
To believe in you.
