And if you save yourself,  
You will make him happy.  
He'll keep you in a jar,  
And you'll think you're happy.  
He'll give you breather holes,  
And you'll think you're happy.  
He'll cover you with grass  
And you'll think you're happy.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now...  
You're in a laundry room.  
You're in a laundry room.  
The clues they came to you...  
  
And if you cut yourself,  
You will think you're happy.  
He'll keep you in a jar,  
Then you'll make him happy.  
He'll give you breather holes,  
Then you'll think you're happy.  
He'll cover you with grass,  
Then you'll think you're happy.  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
And if you fool yourself,  
You will make him happy.  
He'll keep you in a jar,  
Then you'll think you're happy.  
He'll give you breather holes,  
Then you will seem happy.  
You'll wallow in the shit,  
Then you'll think you're happy.  
  
[Chorus]
