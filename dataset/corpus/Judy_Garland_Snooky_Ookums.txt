All night long he calls her snookey ookum, snookey ookums.  
All they do is talk like babies.  
She's his jelly elly roll.  
He's her sugey ugar bowl.  
Hear the way they bill and coo, poogywoo,poogywoo, poogywoo?  
All night long he calls her snookey ookums, snookey ookums.  
All nigh long the neighbors shout "Cut it out! Cut it out! Cut it out!"  
They cry, "For goodness sake don't keep us all awake with your snookey, ookey,
ookey , baby talk!"
