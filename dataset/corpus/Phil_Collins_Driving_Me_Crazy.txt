No matter where you go I'll be there  
No matter where you hide I'll find you  
I'll be there looking through the window watching everything you do  
There's no escaping me  
I'll be like your worst enemy  
I'm right behind you every place you run to I'll be there with you  
  
Cause being without you is driving me crazy  
Oh I just don't know what to do  
Yes being without you is driving me crazy  
Cause all I want is you  
And I like it  
  
If all the world's a stage and we are,  
We're only just two crazy players  
Please understand why I just can't go on without you anymore  
There's no escaping me  
I want you back, can't you see  
I'm losing all control and cannot guarantee my sanity  
  
Cause being without you is driving me crazy  
And I don't know what to do  
Yes being without you is driving me crazy  
Cause all I want is you  
Being without you is driving me crazy  
I don't know how long I'll last  
Being without you is driving me crazy  
Feel my pulse it's going so fast  
  
You, you're driving me crazy  
Me, I'm out of my mind  
You, you're making me crazy  
Me, I'm running out of time  
  
I am your conscience, I'm your guide  
I know just what you feel inside  
I share your darkest thoughts with you but share no consequences for them  
There's no escaping me  
I'm with you while you sleep  
I hear your lies, I hear your truth  
I hear you speak before you do  
  
But being without you is driving me crazy  
And I don't know what to do  
Yes being without you is driving me crazy  
Cause all I want is you  
Being without you is driving me crazy  
I don't know how long I'll last  
Being without you is driving me crazy  
Feel my pulse it's going so fast
