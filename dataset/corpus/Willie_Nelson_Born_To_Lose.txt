I'm born to lose  
I've lived my life in vain  
Every dream  
Has only brought me pain  
All my life  
I've always been so blue  
Born to lose  
And now I'm losing you  
  
Born to lose  
It seems so hard to bear  
How I long  
To always have you near  
You've grown tired  
And now you say we're through  
Born to lose  
And now I'm losing you  
  
I'm born to lose  
My every hope is gone  
It's so hard to face  
An empty dawn  
And you were all  
The happiness I knew  
I'm born to lose  
And now I'm losing you
