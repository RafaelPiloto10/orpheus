My baby gives me satisfaction  
My baby gives me all his love  
Let's me know I'm his main attraction  
No one else is gonna feel his touch  
I love the way he drives me crazy  
From now on I'm gonna love my baby  
  
My baby is a full-time lover  
My baby is a full-grown man  
Makes me feel like a natural woman  
I know he's the only one who can  
Rock my world and I don't mean maybe  
From now on I'm gonna love my baby  
  
No one else can take me away from my baby  
I'm holding on to heaven in his arms  
No one can take me away from my baby  
I'm holding on to heaven in his arms  
  
My baby is a rolling thunder  
My baby is a south-bound train  
His love is like a long, hot summer  
Calms me down like a cool, cool rain  
His sweet wonderful ways amaze me  
It's no wonder why I love my baby
