Marley:  
Ee, ee, ee, ee-ee,  
Ee, ee, ee, ee-ee,  
Ee, ee, ee, ee-ee,  
Ee, ee-ee, ee, ee-ee.  
  
Stripped to the waist,  
We fall into the river.  
Cover your eyes,  
So you don't know the secret.  
  
I've been trying to hide,  
  
Marley with New Directions Girls:  
We held our breath,  
To see our names are written.  
  
Marley:  
On the wreck of '86,  
  
Marley with New Directions Girls:  
That was the year,  
I knew the panic was over.  
  
Marley:  
Yeah, since we found out,  
Since we found out,  
  
Marley with New Directions Girls:  
That anything could happen.  
Anything could happen.  
Anything could happen,  
Anything could happen,  
Anything could happen,  
Anything could happen,  
Anything could.

Artie:  
After the war,  
We said we'd fight together.  
I guess we thought,  
That's just what humans do.  
Letting darkness grow,  
As if we need it's palette,  
And we need it's colour.  
  
But now I've seen it through,  
And now I know the truth,  
  
Artie with New Directions Girls:  
That anything could happen,  
Anything could happen.  
Anything could happen,  
Anything could happen,  
Anything could happen,  
Anything could happen,  
Anything could.

Ee, ee, ee, ee-ee,  
Ee, ee, ee, ee-ee,  
Ee, ee, ee, ee-ee,  
Ee, ee, ee, ee-ee.  
  
Jake:  
Baby, I'll give you everything you need,  
I'll give you everything you need,  
Oh, I'll give you everything you need.  
  
Jake with New Directions:  
But I don't think I need you.

I know it's gonna be,

I know it's gonna be,  
I know it's gonna be.  
I know it's gonna be,
