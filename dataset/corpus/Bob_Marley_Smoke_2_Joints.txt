I smoke two joints in the morning  
I smoke two joints at night,  
I smoke two joints in the afternoon  
And it makes me feel alright  
I smoke two joints in time of peace  
And two in time of war  
Smoke two joints before I smoke two joints  
And then I smoke two more  
  
Yeah that's what I do, hey  
  
Mama she always told me son you really have it bad  
Mama she always told me son you do the best you can  
Then one day I met a man he came to me and said  
I work good and I work fine but first take care of him  
  
I smoke two joints in the morning  
I smoke two joints at night  
I smoke two joints in the video game  
And it mkes me feel alright  
I smoke two joints in the time of peace  
And two in time of war  
I smoke two joints before I smoke two joints  
And then I smoke two more  
  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
  
One peace one time  
Funny days, funny days  
Gimme that bassline  
  
Fellas fellas
