I move all right,  
I got the wheels going round,  
Making ways in the night.  
Yea we're movin' all right,  
  
Wipin' the rain from the ground  
And the pale from the sky  
But something happens in his heart  
When the morning comes  
  
The secrets that she keeps away from me,  
The tears on the pillow  
She don't want me to see,  
Well every little thing she does is for me  
  
But somebody new is breaking us in two.  
He's the kind of love  
That makes a whirl in your mind,  
Like the tide and the time.  
  
With just a little bit o'soul  
He fights to find peace of mind  
In these shattering eyes  
But something happens in his heart  
  
When the morning comes.  
The secrets that she keeps away from me...  
The secrets that she keeps away from me.  
The love of you and me...
