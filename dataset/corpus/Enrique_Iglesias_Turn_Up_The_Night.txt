So Turn Up the Night  
I know you want it, oh yeah you want it  
Tonight is going down, and you with it  
Come on and take me higher  
You can be my firestarter  
Come and lay me down  
It'll only take a minutes  
Starting my ignition  
Yeah  
It's gonna burn when you're touchin 'me  
You cross this line  
Do you find it hard to say it with me  
Tonight?  
These've walked miles but I've walked in  
Straight line  
You'll never know what was there to be
