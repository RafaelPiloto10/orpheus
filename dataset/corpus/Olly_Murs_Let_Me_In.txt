[Verse:]  
Keep that light on in your window  
Undo the locks and let me in  
I've come seeking my salvation  
The one who's lost, in search of it  
The one who's lost, in search of it  
  
[Chorus:]  
Let me in and I will save you from the madness  
Let me in and I will keep you from storm  
With every motion, every moment that we've owned  
I'll be here to break the fall  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Keep that love light in your window  
Till I get back home to you  
Lift my heart and set your soul free  
Tell me love's the only truth  
Tell me love's the only truth  
  
[Chorus:]  
Let me in and I will save you from the madness  
Let me in and I will keep you from storm  
There's an open book of stories to be told  
And I'll be here to tell them all  
  
[Bridge:]  
Oooooo... Oooooo...  
Oooooo... Oooooo...  
Oooooo... Oooooo...  
Oooooo...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Let me in and we can fill our lives with magic  
Let me in and we can keep each other warm  
With every motion, every moment that we hold  
I'll be here to break the fall  
I'm always here to break the fall
