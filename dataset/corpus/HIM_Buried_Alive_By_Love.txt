Again the burden of losing rest  
Upon my shoulders  
And its weight seems unbearable  
Your tomb is where your heart is,  
I should have told her  
But within Me a secret so terrible  
  
To cry is to know that you're alive  
But my river of tears has run dry  
I never wanted to fool you, no  
But a cold heart is a dead heart  
And it feels like I've been buried alive by love  
  
If I should die before I wake  
Pray no one my soul to take  
If I wake before I die,  
Rescue me with your smile  
  
If I should die before I wake  
Pray no one my soul to take  
If I wake before I die,  
Rescue me with your smile  
  
The kiss of vanity you blessed me with a spiritual murder  
Fed the gods of war  
Your home is there in the darkness, I should have told her  
Embrace the fire indestructible  
  
To die is to know that you're alive  
And my river of blood won't run dry  
I never wanted to lose you, no  
But a cold heart is a dead heart  
And it feels like I've been buried alive by love  
  
If I should die before I wake  
Bring no one my soul to take  
If I wake before I die,  
Rescue me with your smile  
  
If I should die before I wake  
Pray no one my soul to take  
If I wake before I die,  
Rescue me with your smile  
  
Oh, it seems to cry is to know that you're alive  
And my river of tears has run dry  
I never wanted to fool you, no  
But a cold heart is a dead heart  
And a desert soul is gone  
A cold heart is a dead heart  
And it feels like I've been buried alive by love  
  
If I should die before I wake  
Pray no one my soul to take  
If I wake before I die,  
Rescue me with your smile,  
  
If I should die before I wake  
Pray no one my soul to take  
If I wake before I die,  
Rescue me with your smile  
  
I've been buried alive by love  
I've been buried alive by love  
Buried alive by love  
I've been buried alive by love  
I've been buried alive by love  
I've been buried alive by love
