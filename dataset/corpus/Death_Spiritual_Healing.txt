Always blocking the doors to your mind  
Escaping the reality that surrounds you  
Using faith as an excuse to kill  
A sick way of life is now revealed  
  
All the prayers in the world can't help you now  
A killer a take of life is what you are  
  
Preach the good word  
Speak no more, perpare to burn  
A justified torture?  
From this may others learn  
The life you took a holy death, a grave mistake  
No changing your mind, your life you should pay  
  
Practice what you preach  
Your loved one is now deceased  
Knowledge is at our hands  
Never to understand  
  
Spiritual healing  
  
Blinded by the twisted ways you live  
Kill for religion, will the Lord forgive?  
Idiocy has stricken you mind  
A real-life hell you will find
