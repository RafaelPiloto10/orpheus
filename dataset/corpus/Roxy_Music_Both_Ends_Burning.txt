Please don't ever let me down  
'Cause you know I'm not so sure  
Do I have the speed to carry on  
Burn you out of my mind, I know  
You're a flame that never fades  
Jungle red's a deadly shade  
Both ends burning, will the fires keep  
Somewhere deep in my soul tonight  
Both ends burning  
Burning  
Burn  
  
Now my course is plain as day  
Running bold across to play  
Both ends burning with a strange desire  
That feeds the fire in my soul tonight  
I will dance the night away  
Living only for today  
Both ends burning while you're counting sheep  
Hell, who can sleep in this heat this night?  
Tell me will I ever learn?  
  
It's too late, the rush is on  
Both ends burning and I can't control  
The fires raging in my soul tonight  
Oh will it never end?  
Put your foot around the bend  
Drive me crazy to an early grave  
Tell me what is there to save tonight  
Both ends burning  
Burning  
Burn  
  
Keep on burning till the end, until the end  
Keep on burning till the end, the very end
