My granny, she said I was a hooligan  
Runnin' 'round like a fool again  
I went down to the candy store  
If I had a nickel I'd buy some more  
  
And I'm oh so sad, yeah, oh so bad  
So sad, but it's true  
Baby, what can I do  
  
My mama, she said I was a black sheep  
My baby. she said I was a creep  
And I'm oh so sad, oh so bad  
So sad, but it's true  
Baby, what can I do  
  
I got a '35 Chevy on a '55 frame  
Can't even spell my name  
Dropped out of school when I was 22  
What can I do to satisfy you  
  
I'm a hooligan  
Won't go to school again  
I'm a hooligan  
Won't go to school again, won't go, no  
  
I got a '35 Chevy on a '55 frame

I'm a hooligan, I am a hooligan  
Won't go to school again, won't go, no

Won't go to school again, won't go, no  
Nobody's gonna pull me down
