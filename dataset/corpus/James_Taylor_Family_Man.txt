Woah, Jocko, don't expect me  
To come out drinking, messing around.  
Spending my time with a bunch of crazy people.  
Yes, I been there before,  
I don't need to go back no more.  
I'm just a family man, like it or not,  
I am a family man.  
I'm a-holding onto what I've got.  
I'm a family man,, right by damn.  
Finally, find out what I am is a family man.  
  
And don't expect me to hit the road  
At a moment's notice without my suitcase  
With some crazy bunch of strangers  
In some unknown car,  
Well, I'm just not willing to go that far.  
  
The life I used to lead was a little too frantic. I guess I just got eyes to
grow old and grey.  
And if what I have in mind isn't super romantic,  
I guess I always saw myself this way,  
I'm just a family man, like it or not,  
Said I'm a family man, holding onto what I've got,  
I'm a family man, right by damn,  
I finally, find out what I am is a family man.  
  
Sears and Roebuck.  
Howard Johnson.  
Colonel Sanders.  
Station wagon.  
Briggs and Stratton.  
Second mortgage.  
If I can ever lose my blues.  
Walk on over and turn on the TV.  
What I'd like to do is  
Lie down on the sofa later on.  
I might walk my dog, baby.  
Bo Diddley's a family man.
