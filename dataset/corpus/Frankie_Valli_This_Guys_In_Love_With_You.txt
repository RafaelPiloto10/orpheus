You see this guy, this guy's in love with you  
Yes, I'm in love, who looks at you the way I do  
When you smile I can tell we know each other very well  
  
How can I show you I'm glad, I've got to know you 'cause  
I've heard some talk, they say you think I'm fine  
This guy's in love and what I'd do to make you mine  
Tell me now, is it so? Don't let me be the last to know  
  
My hands are shakin', don't let my heart keep breaking 'cause  
I need your love, I want your love  
Say, you're in love, in love with this guy, if not I'll just die  
  
Tell me now, is it so? Don't let me be the last to know  
My hands are shakin', don't let my heart keep breaking 'cause  
I need your love, I want your love  
Say, you're in love, in love with this guy, if not I'll just die
