A yes, yes y'all  
It's too fresh y'all  
A little b-boy blue  
You know it's too beucou  
  
I've been from New York to Cali  
Spent two days in the valley  
And I think I'm 'bout to lose my mind  
And if I think 'bout it one more time  
  
I'm a blow my stack  
See ya out the back  
Give me some room that I can breathe in  
Now I'm a start weavin'  
  
Spells like a wizard  
King of the lizard  
My mojo's risin' like my nature should  
Not everybody can relate to hood  
  
But I used to roll with high frequency  
Had a habit of juvenile delinquency  
If y'all could see all the things I did  
When I was a kid, ya might flip ya lid  
  
'Cause when I was the age of one  
My father gave me my very first gun  
When I was the age of two  
I was pullin' out records with the SD Crew  
  
And when I was the age of three  
I had all the maddest fishes swimmin' after me  
And when I was the age of four  
I was bustin' out shows with the rhymes galore  
See  
  
Day to the night  
Night to the day  
Up around where I stay  
We do things this way  
  
You got to watch how you act  
And watch what you say  
'Cause their ain't no stallin'  
When the death come callin'  
  
Day to the night  
Night to the day  
Up around where I stay  
We do things this way  
  
You got to watch how you act  
And watch what you say  
'Cause their ain't no stallin'  
When the death come callin'  
  
The man that lives by the pistol  
Dies by the smokin' gun  
(Gun)  
I think I hear a steam whistle  
Lord, when my train gonna come  
  
The man that lives by the pistol  
Dies by the smokin' gun  
(Gun)  
I think I hear a steam whistle  
Lord, when my train gonna come  
  
Yo, all you duns packin'  
Fightin' for ones  
It's time to get these hons  
Start raisin' some sons  
  
Plant your seed in some fertile soil  
And watch me start bubblin'  
Like I'm 'bout to boil  
Like Olive Oil love Popeye  
  
Just won't stoppa, I got to keep rockin'  
Ticks keep tockin', time keeps slippin'  
My mind keeps trippin'  
I'm in the road less traveled, sure got lotta stones  
  
I say day to the night  
Night to the day  
Up around where I stay  
We do things this way  
  
You got to watch how you act  
And watch what you say  
'Cause their ain't no stallin'  
When the death come callin'  
  
I say day to the night  
Night to the day  
Up around where I stay  
We do things this way  
  
You got to watch how you act  
And watch what you say  
'Cause their ain't no stallin'  
When the death come callin'  
  
When the death come callin'  
Watch me break it down  
When the death come callin'  
Watch me break it down  
  
There's a red house yonder  
Just over the hill  
With my name carved  
Into the window sill  
  
I think I'm gonna burn it down  
Yeah, I think I'm gonna burn it down  
That's what me and my old woman used to say  
We used to lie in bed and make love all day  
  
Now I think I'm gonna burn it down  
Yeah, I think I'm gonna burn it down  
Yeah, I think I'm gonna burn it down to the ground  
  
The man that lives by the pistol  
Dies by the smokin' gun  
I think I hear a steam whistle  
Lord, when my train gonna come  
  
The man that lives by the pistol  
Dies by the smokin' gun  
I think I hear a steam whistle  
Lord, when my train gonna come
