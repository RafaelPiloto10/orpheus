Well the County Fair left quite a mess  
In the county yard  
Kids with eyes as big as dollars  
Rode all the rides  
Strip artists and con artists  
Put on quite a show  
And made some money  
Then left town  
Where they went I don't know  
  
Hey all you suckers  
I heard a fat woman say  
Come on in for fifty cents  
You can stay in here all day  
So I took a chance  
I went inside  
Wasn't much there to see  
So I asked her for my money back  
And she just smiled at me  
  
Saw Princess Tonyika taken off all her clothes  
Rode some rides and played some games  
Saw the Wild Man from Borneo  
There was a black man playing the blues  
Talked to some friends I hadn't seen in a while  
Through a football through a hoop  
  
Well I saw them loading up their trucks  
Taking down the rides  
Folding up all the tents  
There's a full moon in the sky  
Some were laughing some were cussing  
As they worked  
Saw one of them making love  
To a local girl  
  
I was minding my own business  
It was quarter after two  
When a fella walked up and said  
Hey man  
I remember you  
And then he shoved me  
And pulled out his knife  
Stuck me three times in the chest  
And I died that night  
  
For the like of me I can't remember  
Who he was  
And why he'd put a knife in me  
In the dusty parking lot  
Everybody said  
What a shame it was  
But he knew better than staying out  
Past twelve o'clock  
  
Some people put no value  
On a human life  
And there are places we all go  
That just ain't safe at night  
If somebody would do this to me  
They just might do it to you  
So be careful where you go  
And what you say or do  
  
Well the County Fair left quite a mess  
In the county yard
