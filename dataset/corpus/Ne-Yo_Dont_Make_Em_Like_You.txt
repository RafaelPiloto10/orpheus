I'm checking the forecast, they say it may be cloudy  
We might luck up and get sunshine  
It's what you deserve, the sound of the birds  
And your hair flying free in the wind girl  
So go on girl, you're the only flower that blooms in the summer  
Ain't no need to stop and wonder  
'Cause there'll never be another  
That's how I know  
  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
(smile)  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
(touch)  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
Feeling that you give, girl I know  
  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
(your hair)  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
(your skin)  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
(eyes)  
  
We got perfect timing, our hearts are often broken  
But mine's you keep so wide open  
We both know there's no guarantee, yeah  
  
So baby, you see you gotta tell me where you came from  
'Cause if you leave someone's gotta replace ya  
'Cause I realize that you are truly something special  
  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
(smile)  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
(touch)  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
Feeling that you give, girl I know  
  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
(your hair, baby)  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
(skin)  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
(eyes)  
  
I'm hoping this can last forever  
Where can I go to find something  
More special than you girl?  
I know I'll never find another  
  
You're unforgettable, undeniable  
Anybody would fall for you  
My heart is saying you're the one  
My heart is saying you're the one babe  
  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
(your smile)  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
(your touch)  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
Feeling that you give, girl I know  
  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
(hair)  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
(skin)  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
(eyes)  
  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
(your smile)  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
(your touch)  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
Feeling that you give, girl I know  
  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
(your hair)  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
(your skin)  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
(eyes)  
  
Oh, oh, baby  
They don't, they don't  
Make 'em like you
