Loopy says he likes it up on top  
Yes he knows if he ever lets go  
The pretty machine will swallow him whole  
  
He has no fear  
He has no sense of shame  
He will not stop until everybody everywhere wants to know his name  
The one hit wonder  
He likes the big time  
  
He says he wants to live the kind of life  
That will make the folks back home all bitch and whine  
He knows if he ever even gets the chance  
He'd sell his soul to make the monster dance  
They can't hurt you unless you let them  
Loopy says he sure does like the good life  
Yes he knows all those women who scheme  
Are just pretty pictures in the pretty machine  
He knows if he ever even gets to try  
  
He will bite down hard to make the monster cry  
He knows if he ever even gets a chance  
He'd sell his soul to make the monster dance  
They can't hurt you unless you let them  
  
I will say it again  
They cannot hurt you unless you let them  
Loopy says he likes it up on top  
He prays to god and he hopes like hell  
That the pretty machine  
They will never fail  
  
He has no fear  
He doesn't really even have the time  
He knows that the world is in love  
With the pretty machine  
  
The one hit wonder  
He likes the big time  
He wants to live the kind of life  
That will make the folks back home scream, bitch, and whine  
  
He knows if he ever even gets to try  
He will bite down hard to make the monster cry  
He knows if he ever even gets a chance  
He'd sell his soul to make the monster dance  
He knows if he ever even gets to play  
He will stomp like god to make the monster say  
  
They can't hurt you unless you let them  
They cannot hurt you unless you let them
