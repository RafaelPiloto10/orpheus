My girlfriend, my dumb donut  
Went out to a party just the other night  
But three hours later, and seven shots of Jager  
She was in the bedroom with another guy  
  
And I don't really want to know  
So don't tell me anymore  
And I really don't want to hear  
About her feet all up in the air  
  
I'm not the one who acted like a ho  
Why must I be the one who has to know  
I'm not the one who messed up big time  
So spare me the details if you don't mind  
  
Now I can understand  
Friends who want to tell me  
Think they're gonna help me open up my eyes  
But the play-by-play  
Makes me want to lose it  
Every time you do it man it turns the knife  
  
Now I don't need to hear  
About the sounds they were making  
And I don't need to hear  
About how long it was taking  
Or how the walls they were shaking  
  
Now lying in bed, wallowing in sorrow  
Missing the tomorrow that we could have had  
Running through my head, over and over  
Things I never told her now just make me sad  
  
And it drives me insane  
Sitting with the vision  
Stuck with that image burned into my brain  
And I feel so dumb  
That I could ever trust her  
While someone else fucked her  
Then walked away
