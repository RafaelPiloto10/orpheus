(Henry Kapono)  
  
People here and all over the world  
Men, women, boys and pretty girls  
Gather 'round by the seaside, Beach fun and tropic skies  
Diamond head and palm trees, surf riders on the sea  
It's the place to be, it's the place to be  
One the beach at Waikiki, that's where you'll find me  
Here on the southside, Beach Boys paradise  
  
Duke's on Sunday  
Duke's on Sunday  
Duke's on Sunday  
Duke's on Sunday  
  
Music playing happy songs, everybody gets along  
Dancing in the sunshine, groovin' in the good vibe  
Down by the sea, good times will set your free  
Just you and me, this is the place to be  
On the beach at Waikiki, that's where you'll find me  
Here on the southside, Beach Boys paradise  
  
Duke's on Sunday  
Duke's on Sunday  
Having fun underneath the sun, just you and me  
  
Feelin' good and feelin' right, sunset is out of sight  
Another beautiful Hawaiian day, everything's gonna be ok  
Let's get together and do this again  
At the beach at Waikiki, that's where you'll find me  
Here on the southside, Beach Boys paradise  
  
Duke's on Sunday  
Duke's on Sunday  
Duke's on Sunday  
Duke's on Sunday  
Duke's on Sunday
