A boy I used to love, he up and left me now  
I'm tryin' to get him back but he won't accept me, no, no  
I got the will, I can't find the way now, no, no  
Let me tell you now, what my mama told me, the old sayin' is  
If there's a will, girl, there's got to be a way now  
Mama, I got the will but I can't find my way now, no, no  
This is what she told me now  
You got the will, girl, you got the power now  
You got everything, Lord have mercy na, na  
Every second, baby, every minute, honey  
Every hour now, I'm always thinkin' of you, baby  
I got the will but I can't find my way now, no, no  
Let me, let me tell you, honey  
I know you need me, baby, I know you love me, honey  
I really want you, I got to, got to see you now  
Baby, I got the will but I can't find my way now, no, no  
Let me, let me tell you now  
I got the will now, I got the power now  
I got everything, Lord have mercy, no, no  
Baby, baby, you know I need you now  
Baby, baby, you know I love you, love you now  
Oh baby, I got the will but I can't find my way, no, no  
Let me tell you now  
What my mama told me, the old sayin' is  
If there's a will, girl, there's got to be a way now  
Mama, I got the will but I can't find my way now, oh no  
This is what you told me now  
You got the will, girl, you got the power now  
You got everything, good gracious Lord, have mercy  
I got the will, I can't find my way  
I got the will now, I can't find my way now  
I got the power now, I got the will now  
You got the will now, I got the will now  
Can't find my way now, mama, mama  
I got the will now, I can't find my way now
