Pick me up, Oh pick me up  
All you gotta do is just pick me up  
You fall on your bottom  
You can't get up  
Pick me up, pick me up  
  
Well I wanna sit down  
I don't wanna stand up  
I've fallen on my bottom and I can't get up  
I'm sayin'  
  
When I've fallen on my bottom  
And I can't get up  
One of my brothers runs over to pick me up  
I'm sayin'  
  
[Chorus:]  
Pick me up! Pick me up, Say yo!  
Pick me up! Pick me up, Say yo!  
Pick me up! Pick me up, say yo!  
All you gotta do is just  
Pick me up.  
I said...  
  
Well she's on the tables  
And she's on the chairs  
Man, there's babies everywhere  
I'm sayin'...  
  
She's on the stairs  
And she's in the halls  
Better pick me up or I'm gonna fall  
I'm sayin...  
  
[Repeat Chorus]  
  
Well she looks so [?]  
She looks me in the eye  
You better bring me up  
Or I'm gonna cry  
I'm saying...  
  
[Repeat Chorus]
