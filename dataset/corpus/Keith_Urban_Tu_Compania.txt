If I could be anywhere with anyone  
You know exactly where I'd be  
Under the covers waitin' for the sun to rise  
Your head on the pillow next to me  
  
Your feet propped up on that kitchen chair  
Mornin' papers scattered all around you  
Coffee brewin' on that cast-iron stove  
And the pleasure of just knowin' that you're mine  
  
Well, I love the way you look  
Love the way you feel  
And the way you roll your eyes at the kisses that I steal  
Love the way you stare  
When you're starin' right at me  
I just love your company, oh yes, I do  
  
Arm-in-arm on some spring sidewalk day  
Laughin' just because it feels so right  
Wrapped up under the blankets, all cozy by the fire  
As long as you're here, close enough to touch  
  
Well, I love the way you look  
Love the way you feel  
And the way you roll your eyes at the kisses that I steal  
Love the way you stare  
When you're starin' right at me  
And I just love your company, oh yes, I do  
  
Well, I love the way you look  
Love the way you smell  
And I love your pretty eyes and the lies they never tell  
Love the way you stare  
When you're starin' right at me  
And I just love your company
