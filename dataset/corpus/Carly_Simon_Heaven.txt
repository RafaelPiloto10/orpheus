I can almost touch the stars  
Filling up the night  
On their way around the world  
They stop their flight  
  
I can see the brightest star  
Dazzling in the west  
Three wise men follow  
With no time for rest  
  
And heaven can't be far  
From where we lie  
Heaven can't be far  
From where we lie  
  
Follow, follow  
Pilgrims follow  
To see the carpenters' child  
Born the king of angels  
He is meek and mild  
Son of Joseph  
Son of Mary  
Son of love  
He is born  
Son of all believers  
On this Christmas morn  
  
And heaven can't be far  
From where we lie  
Heaven can't be far  
From where we lie
