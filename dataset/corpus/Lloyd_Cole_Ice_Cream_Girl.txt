Maybe I'm a little old-fashioned, maybe you're a little unkind  
Maybe I'm a little impatient, we'll concede that in mind  
You won't give me your number, you won't give me your time  
You said meet me on the corner, and there's still no sign  
Maybe I'm a little outdated, maybe a little out of time  
To believe your heart is in the right place  
Despite what you're doing to mine  
So I'm standing on the corner, looking like I don't care  
D'you want to crucify my feelings with your fingernails  
And leave the loneliest boy in the western world  
Cruising the streets for an ice cream girl  
I feel like a shady politician trying to sell a broken-down car  
Sit home sleeping for virgin princess, you know that's not what you are  
Do I have to feel this small before you'll play ball?  
Maybe I lack sophistication, maybe a little unrefined  
So my credit ain't too good, well call a dollar a dime  
You won't give me your number, you won't give me your time  
I'm standing on the corner, and there's still no sign  
D'you want to crucify my feelings with your fingernails  
And leave the loneliest boy in the western world  
Cruising the streets for an ice cream girl, hey  
D'you want to crucify my feelings with your fingernails  
And leave the loneliest boy in the western world  
Cruising the streets for an ice cream girl
