A little country church on a two lane road  
A bride and groom coming out the door  
White lace dress and a red bouquet  
Just married written on a blue Chevrolet  
  
Don't that make you want to fall in love  
Don't that look like a picture of us  
A match made in heaven if there ever was  
Don't that make you want to fall  
That just makes me want to give you my heart  
Ever forever needs a place to start  
Gotta be a sign from up above  
Don't that make you want to fall in love  
  
Old folks sittin' in a front porch swing  
Still holdin' hands like they were sixteen  
Fifty good years they're a lover's dream  
Darlin' that could be you and me  
  
Don't that make you want to fall in love  
Don't that look like a picture of us  
A match made in heaven if there ever was  
Don't that make you want to fall  
That just makes me want to give you my heart  
Ever forever needs a place to start  
Gotta be a sign from up above  
Don't that make you want to fall in love  
Yeah, yeah.  
Don't that make you want to fall in love
