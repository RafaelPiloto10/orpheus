I'm paying for all my father's sins  
So I will thank him for you  
I'ma thank him for you  
My serotonin's got a while to go  
Girl, it's gone 'cause of you  
It's been gone 'cause of you  
  
They say, they want heaven  
They say, they want God  
I say, I got heaven  
Well I say, I am God  
  
I never prayed a moment in my life  
Girl I'm rewarded with you  
I've been rewarded with you  
So baby let me kiss your inner thigh  
Let me kiss it for you  
I can kiss it for you  
  
They say, they want heaven  
They say, they want God  
I say, I have heaven  
I say, I am God
