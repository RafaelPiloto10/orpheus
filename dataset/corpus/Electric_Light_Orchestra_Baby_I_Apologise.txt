Love my baby in the afternoon  
But she's cryin'  
She's cryin'  
  
Told my baby in the afternoon  
But she don't like it  
She don't like it  
Baby used to love me so.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Baby I apologise  
For tellin' them dirty lies  
I've had my fun  
But now it's gone  
Baby I apologise.  
  
Loved her in the mornin'  
In the evenin' too  
But she won't do, what I want to  
  
Kicked me out of my own front room  
For my lyin'  
My dirty lyin'  
Baby you do say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Spoken)  
You know my darlin'  
I was a broken man  
And my dreams had fell apart  
And then a voice from above  
Told me the truth of the world below  
And my darlin'  
I'd just like to say one more time  
Please come back.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Loved her in the mornin'  
In the evenin' too  
But she won't do, what I want to  
  
Kicked me out of my own front room  
For my lyin'  
My dirty lyin'  
Baby used to love me so  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]
