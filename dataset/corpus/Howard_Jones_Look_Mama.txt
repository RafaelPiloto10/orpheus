Look mama  
I love you  
But you gotta let me live my life.  
Look mama  
I love you  
But you gotta let me live my life.  
  
Don't wrap me up in cotton wool  
  
You cannot treat me like a fool.  
Anyway if I was  
You gotta let me be the one.  
O. K.  
Give me your advice  
  
It's not my fault if I can't be wise  
  
Show me a person who hasn't been done.  
Look mama  
I love you  
But you gotta let me live my life. .. .  
  
Don't try to stick your rules on me  
  
I wasn't born as a carbon copy.  
I came out of you  
But don't think you own me.  
I have my respect for you  
I won't try to change  
The things you do. Give me a break  
  
Let me learn it my way. You think you know more  
Than me  
Experience hasn't set you free.

I gotta make my own mistakes  
  
Why can't you treat me like a friend?
