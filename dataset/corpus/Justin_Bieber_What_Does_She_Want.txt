Why does she even obsess about her life with me  
She's like "I don't need you! Just let me be!"  
Why doesn't she ever care me, you see  
Well I'm done with her and she's done with me!  
  
You know, I thought of her as my love  
And I miss her now that she's gone  
Even though I'm writing this song  
She's not there any more  
Oh, she's not there any more  
  
What does she want from me  
I guess it's hard to see  
Everything she does  
I don't why she'd fuss  
What does she want from me  
Don't wanna let her be  
Why is she so obsessed  
She can't avoid her stress  
  
(Whoa, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh) (2x)  
  
Flashback, we were nice and cuddly then  
But then you broke my heart and let go of my hand  
Didn't this of this relationship to end like this  
You could have just gave me a hug or kiss (on the cheek)  
  
You know, I thought of her as my love  
And I miss her now that she's gone  
Even though I'm writing this song  
She's not there any more  
Oh, she's not there any more  
  
What does she want from me  
I guess it's hard to see  
Everything she does  
I don't why she'd fuss  
What does she want from me  
Don't wanna let her be  
Why is she so obsessed  
She can't avoid her stress  
  
Whoa, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh (4x)  
  
Hey!  
What do you say?  
That girl is never coming back today  
Hey!  
What do you say?  
She never wants to see me anyway  
  
You know, I thought of her as my love  
And I miss her now that she's gone  
Even though I'm writing this song  
She's not there any more  
Oh, she's not there any more  
  
What does she want from me  
I guess it's hard to see  
Everything she does  
I don't why she'd fuss  
What does she want from me  
Don't wanna let her be  
Why is she so obsessed  
She can't avoid her stress (2x)  
  
Whoa, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh (Repeat until end)  
(What does she want)
