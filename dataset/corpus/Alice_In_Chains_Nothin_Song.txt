Well the nothin song sticks to your mouth  
Like peanut butter on the brain (2x)  
Nothin ever stays the same

Wearing cowhide, steak on a skate  
Back inside, Sam throw away your cake

Gotta finish so I can awake  
Feed the cat as she spreads all the waste  
Snap her neck or trade in for new make
