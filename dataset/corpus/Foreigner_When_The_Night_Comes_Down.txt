Jimmy got lost in a schoolboy phase  
You see the lines got crossed at a young and tender age  
He dropped out of school and with the new crowd he'd meet  
He left his broken home for a new life out on the street  
See the young boys laugh  
They're gettin' high on a midnight run  
They've got it all figured out  
They don't need no help from anyone, no, no  
Jimmy never knew real love in his heart  
No feelings remain  
Somehow he knew he'd never be a part  
So alone with his pain  
When the night comes down  
Out there on the streets, so many sad, sad stories  
When the night comes down  
They're runnin' out of hope in this land of glory  
They're runnin' in the night  
When the night comes down  
See the young boy cry, he's cryin' out, all alone  
And the hurt inside, he's gotta face it all on his own  
And the church bells ring and the Lord is praised  
But they ain't got time for Jimmy on their holy, holy days  
Jimmy never felt real love in his heart  
No feelings remain  
Somehow he knew he'd never be a part  
So alone with his pain  
When the night comes down  
Out there on the streets, so many sad, sad stories  
When the night comes down  
They're runnin' out of hope in this land of glory  
Just runnin' in the night  
When the night comes down  
Oh, it's a cold hearted town  
Nothin' but a battleground, yeah yeah  
And they're runnin' out of hope in this land of glory  
When the night comes down  
When the night comes down  
On this battleground, yeah  
So many, so many sad, sad stories  
Oh, you can see it every night  
When the night comes down  
See the young boy cry
