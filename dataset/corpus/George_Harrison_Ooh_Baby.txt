My baby, ooh  
You know I love you  
My baby, ooh  
You know I love you  
  
I won't say it's forever  
Right now while we're together  
  
You're my baby, ooh  
You know I love you  
My baby, ooh  
You know I love you  
  
I will be where you want me  
I will try to keep you happy  
If only you say you're my baby, ooh  
You know I love you  
You're my baby  
I do anything for you  
I'd run around the world for you  
I do what you want me to  
  
Ooh, you know that I love you  
My, my baby, ooh
