Are those your eyes, is that your smile  
I've been lookin' at you forever  
But I never saw you before  
Are these your hands holdin' mine  
  
Now I wonder how I could of been so blind  
For the first time I am looking in your eyes  
For the first time I'm seein' who you are  
I can't believe how much I see  
  
When you're lookin' back at me  
Now I understand why love is  
Love is for the first time  
Can this be real, can this be true  
  
Am I the person I was this morning  
And are you the same you  
It's all so strange how can it be  
All along this love was right in front of me  
  
For the first time I am looking in your eyes  
For the first time I'm seein' who you are  
I can't believe how much I see  
When you're lookin' back at me  
  
Now I understand why love is  
Love is for the first time  
Such a long time ago  
I had given up on findin' this emotion ever again  
  
But you live with me now  
Yes I've found you some how  
And I'VE never been so sure  
And for the first time I am looking in your eyes  
  
For the first time I'm seein' who you are  
Can't believe how much I see  
When you're lookin back at me  
Now I understand why love is  
Love is for the first time
