Hey there, pretty one  
Take a look at what you've done  
You've broken my heart in two  
You told a hundred lies  
To as many other guys  
Oh lovely, unfaithful pretty one  
Someday,when you're older  
And your future has past  
You will find that your beauty  
And loveliness won't last  
When the traces of time  
Show in every line  
Remember I still love you  
Pretty one, pretty one, pretty one
