Little Blue eyed lady  
How come you're all alone  
I've been asking  
No one seems to know  
To whom do you belong  
Little Blue eyed lady  
  
The band are really moving  
Everyone is grooving around  
Little lady  
You're still sitting down  
Excuse me if you will  
Little Blue eyed lady  
  
The party's nearly over  
Your eyes still read the same  
Are you looking  
For one who never came  
Are you a passing cloud  
Or a new found baby  
  
Little new found baby  
How come you're all alone  
I've been asking  
No one seems to know  
Are you a passing cloud  
Little Blue eyed lady
