I was with you, you were alone  
Now I'm standing here  
Wisdom came only after you'd gone  
Now I'm starting all over, with a tear in my eye  
I just never thought you'd disappear  
  
In the night your spirit arises  
With it comes the pain  
I hope I'm dreaming 'cause it hurts so bad  
When I reach out for you, I'm alone in some room  
I just never thought you'd disappear  
  
I still love you like a child  
Wasn't that good enough?  
I still want you, it drive me wild  
The pain is just too much  
Maybe I've lost enough  
  
Time heals all, so they say, I don't know  
Sometimes nothing's clear  
Maybe someday I'll understand  
But I know for a start  
There's a place in my hear that is yours  
And it won't disappear  
  
I still love you like a child  
Wasn't that good enough?  
I still want you, It drives me wild  
The pain is just too much  
I still love you
