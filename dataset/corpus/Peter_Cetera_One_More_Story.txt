One more story  
Then it's time for bed  
One more fairy tale  
Then rest your weary head  
One more kiss, I'll turn out the lights  
Everything's gonna be all right  
I'll still be here when you wake up in the morning  
Close your eyes, say goodnight  
Go to sleep now  
You've had a busy day  
Hold me in your dreams  
I won't be far away  
One more kiss then I'll turn out the lights  
Everything's gonna be all right  
I'll still be here when you wake up in the morning  
Close your eyes, say goodnight  
  
I can't believe just how fast you're growing  
I'm gonna cry when you're old enough  
To go and be on your own  
But until that very moment  
Everything's gonna be all right  
You'll still be here when I wake up in the morning  
Close your eyes, say goodnight  
Everything's gonna be all right
