The day breaks your mind aches  
You find that all her words of kindness linger on  
She no longer needs you  
She wakes up she makes up  
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry  
She no longer needs you  
  
And in her eyes you see nothing  
No sign of love behind the tears  
Cried for no one  
  
A love that should have lasted years  
You want her you need her  
And yet you don't believe her when she said her love is dead  
You think she needs you  
She goes out you stay home  
She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone  
She doesn't need him  
  
And in her eyes you see nothing  
No sign of love behind the tears  
Cried for no one  
  
A love that should have lasted years  
Your day breaks your mind aches  
There will be time when all the things she said  
Will fill your head  
You won't forget her
