[Verse 1]  
You know the caveman gave us woad  
Roman soldiers built the road  
Egypt's pyramids were buildings at their peak  
  
[Verse 2]  
But when we talk of great invention  
It's important that we mention  
A special race who really were unique  
  
[Verse 3]  
Plato and Pythagoras  
Both of them did stagger us  
Socrates, he showed such great technique  
  
[Verse 4]  
Was there ever, ever, ever  
Such a bunch of chaps so clever?  
If you want to know the answer, ask a Greek!  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a Greek, I'm a Greek  
We are all so magnifique  
We invented sundials, catapaults and bricks  
Chic and sleek, so to speak  
Our success was not a freak  
But working hard was how we got our kicks  
  
[Verse 5]  
We created the first siren  
And the first soldering iron  
The Olympics, well... That was quite a busy week  
  
[Verse 6]  
So the next time that you go-go  
To the toyshop for a yo-yo  
Let them know-know it was thought of by a Greek!  
  
[Chorus]  
We are Greek, we are Greek  
Nowadays you'd call us geek  
But in ancient times, people thought of us as tough  
Our physique was not weak  
'Cause when people gave us cheek  
We invented boxing, and other violent stuff!  
  
[Verse 7]  
Fiery flamethrowers for battles  
Pinhole cameras, baby rattles  
'Is there nothing they can't do? ' I hear you shriek  
  
[Verse 8]  
So next time you take a shower  
Or you see a lighthouse tower  
Just remember they were thought of by a Greek!  
  
[Verse 9]  
Stage acoustics, ancient harps  
Music sounds of flats and sharps  
Central heating at your doorsteps  
Splints, syringes, lamps and forceps  
Fire extinguishers, thermometers  
Coin dispensers and odometers  
Pontoon bridges, pistons, pulleys  
Parchment, prisms, puppets, dollies  
  
[Verse 10]  
Shock absorbers, charts and maps  
We were oh, such brainy chaps!  
Anchors, chewing gum, the list does never cease  
Spinning tops, the dice, the crane  
Do we have to ask again?  
Did they come from Spain?  
No, they came from Greece!
