Ad-or-a-tion, Ad-or-a-tion  
Baby when will you-ou ge-et your-our-our-our fill  
Ad-you-la-tion, Ad-you-la-tion  
You know baby I don't thi-ink you-ou-ou ever will  
You're always talkin' about just livin' for the mo-oment 'n  
Bein' a romantic in you, you talk about freedom  
But you don't know what freedom i-is  
No you don't know where freedom li-i-i-ives  
  
You, you don't know, exactly what you fee-ee-ee-ee-ee-eel  
No-o you-ou, a-you don't know-ow, exactly what is rea-ea-ea-ea-ea-eal  
But I'm gonna show you how it feels  
To feel goodbye-hye  
  
Des-o-la-tion, Des-o-la-tion  
You finally brought it down to the same fore-ore-oreground  
Des-per-a-tion, Des-per-a-tion  
You don't know how crazy you-ou-ou-ou sound  
You're always talkin' about, my like o' class  
The way I, hold my glass  
And even though the way I smoke 'n  
Lord I didn't even smo-oke  
Lord I didn't even smo-o-o-oke  
  
But I, I met you, and you had to change my hair-air-air-air-air-hair  
And I-I, I met you-ou, and you had to show me what to wear-ear-ear-ear  
But I'm gonna show you how it feels  
To feel goodbye-hye....
