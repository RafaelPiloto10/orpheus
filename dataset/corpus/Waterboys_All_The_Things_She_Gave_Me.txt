All the things  
All the things she gave me  
All the things  
All the things she gave me  
I wrapped them up  
In a big brown box  
Tied it with ribbon  
Drove to the docks  
Checked my time  
By the old town clock  
All the things...  
I saw the watchman  
He was blowing into  
Cupped hands  
As he walked to the car  
He said "Where do you think  
You're drivin' to son?  
All good folks are in bed  
The day's work is done"  
I said I'm just lookin' for  
Someplace to burn  
All the things  
All the things that she...  
All the things that she gave me  
Where do I put them  
Where can I hide them  
Where I won't have to see them?  
It's dark as hell here  
This city's gown cold  
The devil's in drag  
Playing poker with souls  
The lots are all empty  
The last man's out  
The moon's made of cheese  
And God is a boy scout  
When I go to sleep  
I'll be dreaming about  
All the things...  
Then I'll dream about  
Churches with  
Great tall spires  
Cathedrals and candles  
Chimneys and choirs  
I'll dream about  
That place  
Where I set fire  
All the things  
All the things that she...
