Now, let me tell you all  
A story of a truck drivin' girl  
In a custom-made monster truck  
She took for a whirl  
That little speed demon  
Gonna be a star  
With a learner's permit  
And an adult in the car  
She may be out for a lark  
But she can parallel park  
She's a truck-drivin' girl  
She's a truck-drivin' girl  
  
Well, someday she'll get her license  
And she'll have it all  
She can pick up her friends  
And take a drive to the mall  
That little redhead  
Gonna rock my world  
She's a truck-drivin' girl  
She's a truck-drivin' girl  
  
She's a tire-spinning, gear-grinding,  
Clutch-burning, back-firing,  
Paint-trading, red-lining,  
Over-heating, throttle-stomping,  
Truck drivin' girl!
