She walks be the sea where the seaworld is  
And she waits for the man to come  
She lives in town with her high-heeled friends  
And she knows it's a long way down  
But she doesn't have to get up in the morning  
With her hair so soft and long  
  
Daylight Katy come on  
Daylight Katy come on  
If you can't follow me down  
Daylight Katy go home  
  
Daylight Katy come on  
Daylight Katy come on  
If you can't follow me down  
Daylight Katy go home  
  
She walks to the sea where the seaweed is  
Where the rust and the dirt runs deep  
She lives nine lives in her midnight world  
While her old man's fast asleep  
And she doesn't have to get up in the mornin'  
With her hair so soft and long  
  
Daylight Katy come on  
Daylight Katy come on  
If you can't follow me down  
Daylight Katy go home  
  
Daylight Katy come on  
Daylight Katy come on  
If you can't follow me down  
Daylight Katy go home  
  
She lives by the sea when the summer wind comes  
And the sea don't mind at all  
She talks to the sea when the sea runs wild  
And the waves run steep and tall  
And she doesn't have to get up in the mornin'  
With her hair so soft and long  
  
Daylight Katy come on  
Daylight Katy come on  
If you can't follow me down  
Daylight Katy go home  
  
Daylight Katy come on  
Daylight Katy come on  
If you can't follow me down  
Daylight Katy go home
