God above all the world in motion  
God above all my hopes and fears  
And I don't care what the world throws at me now  
I'm gonna be alright  
  
Hear the sounds of the generations  
Making loud our freedom song  
All in all that the world would know Your name  
It's gonna be alright  
  
Cause I know my God saved the day  
And I know His word never fails  
And I know my God made a way for me  
Salvation is here  
  
Salvation is here  
Salvation is here and He lives in me  
Salvation is here  
Salvation that died just to set me free  
Salvation is here  
Salvation is here and He lives in me  
Salvation is here  
Cause You are alive and You live in me
