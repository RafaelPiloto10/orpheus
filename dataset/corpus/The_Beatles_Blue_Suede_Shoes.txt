You can knock me down,  
Slap my face  
Slander my name  
All over the place  
Do anything that you want to do,  
But oh oh honey,  
Lay of them blue suede shoes  
Now don't you step  
On my blue suede shoes  
Well you can do anything  
But lay of them blue suede shoes  
Ah go!  
You can burn my house,  
Steal my car,  
Drink my liquor  
From a old fruit jar  
Do anything  
That you want to do,  
But ah ah honey,  
Lay of them blue suede shoes  
And don't you step  
On my blue suede shoes, please  
Well you can do anything  
But lay of them blue suede shoes  
Ah go, hit it, Carl (Perkins)!  
Well blue blue,  
Blue suede shoes  
Yeah blue blue,  
Blue Suede shoes  
Blue blue blue,  
Blue suede shoes  
Yeah brown brown  
Brown suede boots  
Yeah brown brown  
Brown suede boots  
Well you can do anything  
But lay of them blue suede shoes
