You gonna try and hide  
In the dark corners  
Of the night  
But he' s gonna get you  
'Cause he' s not human at all  
He' s Dracula ha, ha, ha, ha  
  
Chorus:  
Dracula, Dracula (x2)  
  
During the day he' s my friend  
But when the night falls  
He' s no friend of mine  
During the day he' s my friend  
But when the night falls  
He' s nobody friend  
His eyes shine wild with fire  
His heart is cold as ice  
I am scared of him  
He lives on human blood  
He feeds on human flesh  
Stay away he' s got no mercy  
No mercy at all  
He' s Dracula  
  
Chorus:  
Not everything that glitters is gold  
Ye man yes I say man  
Don' t trust no one  
Don' t even trust yourself  
A' me a' go say now  
He' s got the sweetest words  
You' ve ever heard  
He talks like a new state president  
Telling people  
What he' s gonna do for them yeah!  
He walks like a human being  
He eats like everybody does yeah!  
But deep down in his heart  
He knows he' s bad news yeah!  
His eyes shine wild with fire  
His heart is as cold as ice  
No mercy at all Dracula  
Dracula  
  
Chorus:

A'him a' go round lamping the creation yeah
