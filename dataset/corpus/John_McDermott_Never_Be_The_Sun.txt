You'll never be the sun turning in the sky  
And you won't be the moon above us on a moonlit night  
And you won't be the stars in heaven although they burn so bright  
But even on the deepest ocean you will be the light  
You may not always shine as you go barefoot over stone  
You might be so long together or you might walk alone  
And you won't find that love comes easy but that love is always right  
So even when the dark clouds gather you will be the light  
And if you lose the part inside when loves turns round on you  
Leaving the past behind is knowing you'll do like you always do  
Holding you blind, keeping you true  
You'll never be the sun turning in the sky  
And you won't be the moon above us on a moonlit night  
And you won't be the stars in heaven although they burn so bright  
But even on the deepest ocean you will be the light
