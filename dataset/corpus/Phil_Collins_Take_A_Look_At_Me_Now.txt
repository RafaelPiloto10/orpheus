How can I just let you walk away,  
Just let you leave without a trace,  
When I stand here taking every breath,  
With you, ooohhh,  
You're the only one who really knew me,  
At all.  
  
How can you just walk away from me,  
When all I can do is watch you leave,  
Cause we shared the laughter and the pain,  
And even shared the tears,  
You're the only one who really knew me at all.  
  
So take a look at me now,  
Cuz there's just an empty space,  
And there's nothing left here to remind me,  
Just the memory of your face,  
Just take a look at me now,  
Coz there's just an empty space,  
And you're coming back to me is against the odds,  
And that's a chance I've got to take.  
  
I wish I could just make you turn around,  
Turn around and see me cry,  
There's so much I need to say to you,  
So many reasons why,  
You're the only one who really knew me at all.  
  
So take a look at me now,  
Cuz there's just an empty space,  
And there's nothing left here to remind me,  
Just the memory of your face,  
Just take a look at me now,  
So there's just an empty space,  
But to wait for you is all I can do,  
And that's what I've got to face  
  
Just take a good look at me now,  
Cause I'll still be standing here,  
(Standing here)  
And you coming back to me is against all odds,  
And that's what I've got to face  
  
Just Take a look at me now, ooh.  
Take a look at me now.  
Take a look at me now.
