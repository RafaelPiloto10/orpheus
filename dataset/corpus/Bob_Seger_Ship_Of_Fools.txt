"Tell me quick" said Old Mcfee  
"What's this all have to do with me?"  
"I've spent all my time at sea a loner."  
  
"Is there something else I should know?"  
"Something hidden down below the level of your conversation?"  
We he turned away before the answer  
Though I yelled aloud he refused to hear  
It became to clear  
So it went as we put out  
I was left in constant doubt  
Everything I asked about seemed private  
  
The captain strolled the bridge one night  
I stopped him in the evening light  
To ask him would it be all right to join him  
  
But he stood there like some idol  
And he listened like some temple  
And then he turned away  
  
All along the fateful coast  
We moved silent like a ghost  
The timeless sea, a tireless host possessed us  
The wind came building from the cold northwest  
And soon the waves began to crest  
Crashing cross the forward deck  
All hands lost  
  
I alone survived the sinking  
I alone possessed the tools  
On that ship of fools
