I'ma be that nail in your coffin  
Sayin' that I soften  
I was duckin' down to reload  
So you can save your petty explanations  
I don't have the patience  
  
Before you even say it I know  
You let your pride and your ego  
Talk slick to me no  
That is not the way I get down  
And look at how you lose your composure  
Now let me show ya exactly how the breaking point sound  
  
I wanna see you choke on your lies  
Swallow up your greed  
Suffer all alone in your misery  
Choke on your lies  
Swallow up your greed  
Suffer all alone in your misery  
  
What is it you want me to tell ya?  
I'm not the failure  
I would rather live and let be  
But you can't make the right kinda threat to  
Push me to let you  
No, you can't intimidate me  
You disrespect me so clearly  
Now you better hear me  
That is not the way it goes down  
You did it to yourself and it's over  
Now let me show ya exactly how the breaking point sounds  
  
I wanna see you choke on your lies  
Swallow up your greed  
Suffer all alone in your misery  
Choke on your lies  
Swallow up your greed  
Suffer all alone in your misery  
  
I wanna see you choke on your lies  
Swallow up your greed  
Suffer all alone in your misery  
Choke on your lies  
Swallow up your greed  
Suffer all alone in your misery  
  
You did it to yourself  
You did it to yourself  
You did it to yourself  
You did it to yourself  
  
You did it to yourself  
You did it to yourself  
You did it to yourself  
You did it to yourself  
  
I wanna see you choke on your lies  
Swallow up your greed  
Suffer all alone in your misery  
Choke on your lies  
Swallow up your greed  
Suffer all alone in your misery
