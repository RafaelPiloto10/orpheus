Now who wouldn't notice the fire in your eyes  
Or the bitter direction of impending good-byes  
I've followed and folded, i'm wilted in place  
At the sight of you standing with streaks down your face  
  
With your heart broke and running from the reason  
You got your heart broke, don't give up on believing in me  
Heart broke, who kept me from leaving?  
With my heart broke  
  
Now pride is a drag and a bore when you're lonely  
Sheer madness prevails upon reason to you  
But all is not lost, it's only mistaken  
That's small consolation but i know just how you feel  
  
With your heart broke and running from the reason  
You got your heart broke, don't give up on believing in me  
Heart broke , who kept me from leaving?  
With my heart broke  
  
Nobody said it was going to be easy  
We all have feelings that need a softer touch  
But nobody said that it would not be worth it  
The human condition continues as such  
  
With your heart broke and running from the reason  
You've got your heart broke, don't give up on believing in me  
Heart broke, who kept me from leaving?  
With my heart broke, youove got me heart broke
