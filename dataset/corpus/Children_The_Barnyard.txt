With a baa! Baa! Here,  
And a baa! Baa! There,  
Here a baa! There a baa!  
Here a baa! There a baa!  
Hey, little girl (or boy),  
Will you come along with me,  
To see the farmer's sheep?  
  
With a moo! Moo! Here,  
And a moo! Moo! There,  
Here a moo! There a moo!  
Here a moo! There a moo!  
Hey, little girl (or boy),  
Will you come along with me,  
To see the farmer's cows?  
  
With an oink! Oink! Here,  
And an oink! Oink! There,  
Here an oink! There an oink!  
Here an oink! There an oink!  
Hey, little girl (or boy),  
Will you come along with me,  
To see the farmer's pigs?  
  
With an arf! Arf! Here,  
And an arf! Arf! There,  
Here an arf! There an arf!  
Here an arf! There an arf!  
Hey, little girl (or boy),  
Will you come along with me,  
To see the farmer's dogs?
