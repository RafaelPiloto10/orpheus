I'm still living for tomorrow  
I'm living for today  
  
Let's make this world  
A better place to live  
Stop to take  
Start to give  
  
Love's got the power  
To get it done  
To stop the pain  
Of a killing gun  
  
And even if you say  
We're gonna die today  
I'm still living for tomorrow  
I'm living for today  
'Cause love will find a way my friend  
Whatever it will take  
  
I'm still living for tomorrow  
I'm living for today  
Why don't we try today my friend  
To make this world a better place  
  
Let's make this life  
A better life to live  
Stop to hate  
Learn to forgive  
  
Evil power can kill  
The human race  
If we give life  
A human face (a human face)  
  
And even if you say  
We're gonna die today  
I'm still living for tomorrow  
I'm living for toda  
  
'Cause love will find a way my friend  
Whatever it will take  
  
I'm still living for tomorrow  
I'm living for today  
Why don't we try today my friend  
To make this world a better place (a better place)  
  
And even if you say  
We're gonna die today  
I'm still living for tomorrow  
I'm living for today  
  
'Cause love will find a way my friend  
Whatever it will take  
  
I'm still living for tomorrow  
I'm living for today  
Why don't we try today my friend  
To make this world a better place  
  
I'm still living for tomorrow
