No matter what you are  
I will always be with you  
Doesn't matter what you do girl  
Ooh girl with you  
No matter what you do  
I will always be around  
Won't you tell me what you found girl  
Ooh girl, oh won't you  
  
Knock down the old brick wall  
And be a part of it all  
Nothing to say  
Nothing to see  
Nothing to do  
  
If you would give me all  
As I would give it to you  
Nothing would be  
Nothing would be  
Nothing would be  
  
No matter where you go  
There will always be a place  
Can't you see it in my face girl  
Oh girl won't you  
  
Yeah  
  
Knock down the old brick wall  
And be a part of it all  
Nothing to say  
Nothing to see  
Nothing to do  
  
If you would give me all  
As I would give it to you  
Nothing would be  
Nothing would be  
Nothing would be  
  
No matter what you are  
I will always be with you  
Doesn't matter what you do girl  
Ooh girl with you  
  
Ooh girl, you girl, I want you  
Ooh girl, you girl, I want you
