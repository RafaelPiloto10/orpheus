Don't close the door behind you  
You might wanna go through it someday  
Don't burn that bridge  
You might wanna cross it someday  
Your best friends today  
Could be your worst enemies to morrow  
Your worst enemies today  
Could be your best friends tomorrow  
Don't burn the bridge  
Don't cross the door  
Chorus  
And if you can't say something good about somebody  
Oh shut up  
And if you can't say something about somebody  
Just shut up.  
Ungafakaz' amanga ngomakhelwane wakho  
Ungakhulumi I'ndaba ezingafuni wena  
Vul'umlomo wakho ufak'ipapa lakho  
Vul'umlomo wakho ufak'inyama yakho  
Ungakhulumi'ndaba uxabanis'abantu  
Uma uthanda futhi ufak'amachips  
Amagwinya wona uwashiya nobani?  
Don't say those words that will hurt people  
Don't do those things that will hurt people  
The things you say today  
Will come and haunt you tomorrow  
The things you do today  
Will come and haunt you tomorrow  
Do unto others as you would like them do unto you  
And if you can't say something good about somebody  
Oh shut up  
And if you can't say something good about somebody  
Just shut up  
Reap  
Ungafakaz'amanga...  
Till fade
