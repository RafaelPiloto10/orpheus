If you hear this message, wherever you stand  
I'm calling every woman, calling every man  
We're the generation  
We can't afford to wait  
The future started yesterday and we're already late  
  
We've been looking for a song to sing  
Searched for a melody  
Searched for someone to lead  
We've been looking for the world to change  
If you feel the same  
Then go on and say  
  
If you're out there  
Sing along with me  
If you're out there  
I'm dying to believe that you're out there  
Stand up and say it loud  
If you're out there  
Tomorrow's starting now  
Now, now  
  
No more broken promises  
No more call to war  
Unless it's love and peace that we're really fighting for  
We can destroy hunger  
We can conquer hate  
Put down the arms and raise your voice  
We're joining hands today  
  
Oh I was looking for a song to sing  
I searched for a leader  
But the leader was me  
We were looking for the world to change  
We can be heroes  
Just go on and say  
  
If you're out there  
Sing along with me  
If you're out there  
I'm dying to believe that you're out there  
Stand up and say it loud  
If you're out there  
Tomorrow's starting now  
Now, now  
  
Oh now, now  
  
If you're ready we can shake the world  
Believe again  
It starts within  
We don't have to wait for destiny  
We should be the change that we want to see  
  
If you're out there  
If you're out there  
And you're ready now  
Say it loud  
Scream it out  
  
If you're out there  
Sing along with me  
If you're out there  
I'm dying to believe that you're out there  
Stand up and say it loud  
If you're out there  
Tomorrow's starting now  
  
If you're out there  
If you're out there  
If you're out there  
  
If you hear this message, wherever you stand  
I'm calling every woman, calling every man  
We're the generation  
We can't afford to wait  
The future started yesterday and we're already late
