Oh, 20th century  
20th century  
Working on the line just trying to make a dollar  
Along came the boss and he tapped me on the shoulder  
He said I got to make my little light shine  
If I want to keep my job, I got to work it double time  
Baby it's our destiny  
You know we're living in the 20th century  
Oh, 20th century  
Oh, 20th century  
Oh, baby it's our destiny  
You know we're living in the 20th century  
If you're standing on a corner, well, you don't stand a chance  
You got to have a job if you want to make romance  
I think about my baby nearly all of the time  
But I got to keep on working 'cause they can't stop the line  
Baby it's our destiny  
You know we're living in the 20th century  
Oh, 20th century  
Oh, 20th century  
Oh, baby it's our destiny  
You know we're living in the 20th century  
20th century  
20th century  
20th century  
20th century
