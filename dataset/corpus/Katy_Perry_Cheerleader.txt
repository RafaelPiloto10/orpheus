There is a girl in high school  
She thinks she's more better than me  
I'll show her what she's made of  
She'll be so under my knee  
I'll show her how I'm like  
  
She's just a cheerleader  
She's a girl I never trust  
A mean cheerleader  
I never thought I'd be a bust  
Just a cheerleader  
I never wanna be this way  
A mean cheerleader  
I never thought I'd see this day  
Cheerleader  
  
I'm just a regular teenage girl  
Not to be crazy or anything  
I'm hurrying to her  
Who am I to ring  
I'll show her how I'm like  
  
She's just a cheerleader  
She's a girl I never trust  
A mean cheerleader  
I never thought I'd be a bust  
Just a cheerleader  
I never wanna be this way  
A mean cheerleader  
I never thought I'd see this day  
Cheerleader  
  
I'll show her how I'm like  
She's just a cheerleader  
She's a girl I never trust  
A mean cheerleader  
I never thought I'd be a bust  
Just a cheerleader  
I never wanna be this way  
A mean cheerleader  
I never thought I'd see this day  
Cheerleader  
Cheerleader  
Cheerleader
