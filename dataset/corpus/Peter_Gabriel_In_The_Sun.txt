I picture you in the sun  
Wondering what went wrong  
And falling down on your knees  
Asking for sympathy  
And being caught in between  
All you wish for and all you seem  
And trying to find anything  
You can feel that you can believe in  
  
May gods love be with you , always [Repeat: x1]  
  
I know I would apologize  
If I could see your eyes  
'cause when you showed me myself, you know  
I became someone else  
But I was caught in between  
All you wish for and all you need  
I picture you fast asleep  
A nightmare comes  
You can't keep awake  
  
May gods love be with you, always [Repeat: x3]  
May gods love be with you  
  
'Cause if I find - if I find my own way  
How much will I find, if I find, if I find my own way [Repeat: x2]  
How much will I find [Repeat: x2]  
You, yeah, you  
I'll find you, you, you, oh [Repeat: x3]  
  
Oh I don't know anymore  
What it's for  
I'm not even sure  
If there is anyone  
Who is in the sun  
Will you help me to understand  
'cause I've been caught in between  
All I wish for and all I seem  
Or maybe you're not even sure  
What it's for  
Anymore than me  
  
May gods love be with you  
Always  
May gods love be with you [Repeat: x1]  
Be with you ...
