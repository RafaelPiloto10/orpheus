Rain eyes that blur the rays of sunshine  
When all you see is seen through tears  
The whole world seems as though it's crying  
Rain eyes, that's how my world appears  
One sunny day in Lou'siana  
The clouds began to hover low  
And darkness came in early evening  
And brought a rain that would not go  
I's just a child when mother told me  
It seems your father's gone away  
It's not his fault, my child, forgive him  
I should have known he would not stay  
You're so much like him and he loves you  
But now his love's for only you  
Although he forced himself to leave you  
Forgiving me he could not do  
Rain eyes that cloud the hope of sunshine  
When everything is seen through tears  
The whole world seems as though it's crying  
Rain eyes, that's how my world appears  
It rains all evening into nighttime  
Then rains all night and through the day  
My mother's eyes are weak from crying  
Forgive her, she just lost her way  
Since you've been gone her eyes have clouded  
And darkness reigns her weary view  
She'd see again from your returning  
That God knows she's in love with you  
One rainy day in Louisiana  
The trade winds blew the clouds away  
A mother heard her boy shout, "Father"  
My God, 'tis him, he's come to stay
