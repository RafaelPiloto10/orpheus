Mo' liquor when we ride, toast niggas we alive  
Gold diggers look inside, I aint in the back  
Me I'm in the front seat, driving like I'm one deep  
If you wanna come see, you know where I'm at  
Go getters on the rise, toast niggas we arrived  
Old niggas step aside, aint no coming back  
Big things on my mind, switch lanes and recline  
Get brains from a dime, How you love that?  
  
[J. Cole - Verse 1]  
Alone in my zone, tell me don't it sound stunning  
Been f-cked the world but she just now cummin'  
If I ever fell off I would hit the ground runnin'  
I aint never been the one for fourth down puntin'  
Aiming at a couple heads, bitch I'm crown huntin'  
Red dots cause a nigga dread locks  
So I lock pick just to lock shit back  
I want Money, Power, Respect since the Lox said that  
Better stay up on your toes, this is not tic tac  
Yet, I'm a breath of fresh air, you can place your bets here  
Ballin' like a Laker you should pray for next year  
Cause I'm repeating and I'm three-peatin'  
And I'm knee deep in the game it's quick sand and I keep sinkin'  
The label heat seekin', nigga aint sign me, what the f-ck was he thinkin'  
They say I killed the game, that was only pre-season  
  
I'm heavy  
Lil nigga I'm heavy  
I'm so heavy, I'm feeling heavy  
Carolina I'm heavy  
In New York I'm heavy  
Out in la I'm heavy  
I'm so heavy  
  
We got more liquor when we ride, toast niggas we alive  
Gold diggers look inside, I aint in the back  
Me I'm in the front seat, driving like I'm one deep  
If you wanna come see, you know where I'm at  
Go getters on the rise, toast niggas we arrived  
Old niggas step aside, aint no coming back  
Big things on my mind, switch lanes and recline  
Do you love that?  
  
[J Cole - Verse 2]  
No album to my name and I'm already hot, you can say I'm pre-heated  
If money talks, mine telling your's "be seated"  
Cut my leg off I wouldn't be defeated  
Illest nigga in the game bitch and you can retweet it  
Email the shit make sure you cc it  
For these f-ck niggas who don't wanna believe it  
I be in the airport damn near bare foot  
Security hollin' out, Cole we need it  
Getting high as f-ck and I don't even be weeded  
No point drinkin' I can't even be faded  
Real recognise real like they related  
You aint no f-cking G boy, your style G-Rated  
Hatred is flattery I'm glad to be hated  
F-ckin' bad bitches that would rather be dated  
Carolina niggas just glad that he made it  
My money was running late now, now it's happy belated  
  
I'm heavy, nigga I'm heavy  
I'm so heavy, I'm feeling heavy  
Lil nigga in New York I'm heavy  
Queens, I'm feeling heavy  
Fayettenam nigga I'm so heavy  
I'm feeling heavy  
Lil nigga I'm heavy
