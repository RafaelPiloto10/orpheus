You've been keeping me in limbo  
Playing hide and seek  
You've been teasing me 'cause you know  
That it makes me weak  
You've done everything to fall in love  
I know what you're running from  
Kisses like these are few and far between  
Now we're so close yet so far away  
I'm breaking down the distance  
With every move, with every touch  
You're wearing down my resistance  
You know your lonely days are numbered  
There's nothing you can do  
There'll be no more keeping us apart  
I'm ready for the love to start  
I can almost feel it breaking through  
Now we're so close yet so far away  
I'm breaking down the distance  
With every move and every touch  
I'm wearing down your resistance  
I wanna get closer, closer to you  
I can almost feel it breaking through  
So close yet so far away  
I'm breaking down the distance  
With every move and every touch  
I'm wearing down your resistance  
So close yet so far away  
I'm breaking down the distance  
With every touch and every move  
You're wearing down my resistance
