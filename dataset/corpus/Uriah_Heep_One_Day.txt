One day  
  
Didn't I tell ya  
Everything was gonna be alright  
I never doubted  
It was just a matter of time  
And though I've traveled  
Across the desert of despair  
I know I'll get there one day  
  
How times have changed  
I better re-arrange it everything  
But it can't change the love I bring  
When I get back home to you  
I am the same  
It's just a game that I chose to play  
But remember I can lose  
As fast as I won one day  
  
I still remember the hole in the wall  
Where we all sat though  
You said we'd fall  
The dusty yard and  
The broken down barn  
Where you and me  
Used to share a yarn  
But it's gone now  
  
But didn't I tell ya  
That everything was  
Gonna be alright  
I never doubted  
It was just a matter of time  
Though I've traveled  
Across the desert of despair  
I know I'll get there one day  
One day  
I'll get there one day
