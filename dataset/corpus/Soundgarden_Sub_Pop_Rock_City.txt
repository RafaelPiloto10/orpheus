I'm not stoned but I wanted to tell ya  
When I'm in the mood, I could think of playing there  
Going to Seattle where the rock's so heavy  
With all them sex dogs in my Chevy  
  
At the XTC, party, everybody's invited  
Cool! give it dude, we're plastic like you  
Going to a show, rock's all night  
And everyone I hate is at the party tonight  
I said Sub Pop Rock City  
  
Hello  
(Jonathan Poneman) This is Jonathan  
Hey Jon  
(JP) I just want to know, what the heck's going on?  
Well you know, I have this problem  
(JP) What the heck's going on?  
Yah, okay, well do you think you'd have too much trouble if we got rid of  
our sideburns?  
(JP) At your earliest convenience  
Well, I know you've said that before, but do you think Bruce would mind?  
(Bruce Pavitt) This is Bruce Pavitt  
Bruce, I mean, kay, could we have our dollar back Bruce?  
(BP) Bye
