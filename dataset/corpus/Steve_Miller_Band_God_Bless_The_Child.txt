Them that's got shall get  
Them that's not shall lose  
So the Bible says  
And it still is news  
  
[Chorus]  
Your mama may have  
Your papa may have  
But God bless the child  
Who's got his own  
  
The strong get more  
The weak ones fade  
Empty pockets  
Well, they don't ever make the grade  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When you've got money  
You've got lots of friends  
They're always hangin' around your door  
But when the money's all gone  
And the spending ends  
They don't come around much anymore  
  
Rich relations give  
A crust of bread and such  
You can help yourself  
But you better not take too much, no  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Them that's got shall get  
Them that's not shall lose  
So the Bible says  
And it still is news  
  
[Chorus]
