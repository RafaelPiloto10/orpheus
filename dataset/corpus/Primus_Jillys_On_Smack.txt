Jilly's on smack, and she won't be comin' back  
No she won't be comin' back, for the holidays  
Jilly's on smack, and she won't be comin' back  
No she won't be comin' back, for the holidays  
  
Jilly left home  
Went to pick her own bone  
She made her own  
In the marketplace  
  
Now Jilly's on smack, and she won't be comin' back  
No she won't be comin' back  
For these holidays  
  
Now Jilly's on smack, and she won't be comin' back  
No she won't be comin' back  
For the holidays  
  
Jilly had a smile  
That spanned over a mile  
She left him standing in the aisles  
Of the big parade  
  
Jilly always phoned her mother  
Emailed daily to her brother  
'Til she took a junkie lover  
And began to fade  
  
Now Jilly's on smack, and she won't be comin' back  
No she won't be comin' back  
For the holidays  
  
Jilly's on smack and she won't be comin' back  
No she won't be comin' back  
For the holidays  
  
Jilly's on smack and she won't be comin' back  
No she won't be comin' back  
For them holidays
