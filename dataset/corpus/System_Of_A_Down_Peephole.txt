When your stars are baked,  
And your rivers fly  
Do you ever believe you were stuck out in the sky  
  
When your castle breaks,  
And your feet are dry  
Do you ever believe you were stuck out in the sky  
  
Do you believe, when you're high  
That your life is tried  
  
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky  
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky  
Don't ever get stuck in the sky, when you're high  
  
When your moon is fake,  
And your mermaids cry  
Do you ever believe you were stuck in the sky  
  
When your tunnel fades,  
And your guide is shy  
Do you ever believe you were stuck in the sky  
  
Do you believe, when you're high  
That your life is tried  
  
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky  
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky  
Don't ever get stuck in the sky, when you're high  
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky  
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky  
Don't ever get stuck in the sky, when you're high  
  
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky  
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky  
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky  
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky  
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky  
Don't you ever get stuck in the sky  
Don't ever get stuck in the sky, when you're high
