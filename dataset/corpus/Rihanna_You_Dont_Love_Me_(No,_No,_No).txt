[Chorus]  
No no no  
You don't love me and I know now  
No no no  
You don't love me so let me go now  
(I can't let you go, can't let you go)  
If you ask me, baby  
I should've left you a long time ago, no  
  
Playas gonna play  
At least thats what they say  
Well I know that for myself now  
(You know I love you)  
You said you loved me babe  
Then you played your game  
A game that I know all too well now  
Well I used to buy your lines  
But it's time for me to sail now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
First you tellin me no  
But please tell me yes  
Without some of this stress  
Straight up tell me yes  
Gimme the keys to ya chest  
Ya chest will rise neva rest  
As ya chest you got me feelin like i'm climbin on Mount Everest  
Hey Rihanna  
Your lovin really put me to the test  
But if you shoulda let me soon the answer will yes  
Yes to this yes to that yes to whateva you suggest  
So please say yes  
No no no  
  
[Verse 2]  
  
Haters gonna hate  
(Let them hate)  
I found out much to late  
I think I know we're a little hot now  
The truth leads to the lies  
The heart ain't always right  
And I see that love is blind now  
Boy you use to have my trust  
Without no trust there ain't no us boy  
  
[Chorus]
