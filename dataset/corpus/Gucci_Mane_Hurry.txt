Verse 1  
Gucci got a warrant how da fuck I get subpoenaed?  
Objection what's the objection your honor I'm a genius

Like lil scrappy rockin fila's  
In the club showin off like tila (Gucci)  
Black and white chain in da libra like a zebra  
This not your everday ordinary fuckin beemer  
This is no part of da seven this a moss one cost a mean one got my top back

It's me and my money and my diamonds man we a trio  
And no disrespect to neyo

It's gucci mane la flare  
And my bank account is rollin is you rollin
