Downtown Jimmy, say you're feeling kinda blue  
It's no problem, this is what you gotta do  
Telephone your baby, tell her that you're working late  
Come and pay a visit, please don't hesitate  
  
Come join the party, come along and be our guest  
Sit back and let us do the rest, we're the best, yeah  
  
Come on an' meet me at the station, don't pack your bags, just fix your hair  
Gotta get up, gotta get in, gotta get out, just look for me, I'm always there  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Come on let's ride, ride that gypsy train  
All aboard, now don't you be afraid  
Come on let's ride, ride that gypsy train  
Feed the fire, let's go one mo' time again  
  
Medication, little love and sympathy, cool libation, it's complimentary  
Play a little poker, love when the stakes are high  
Lotta nasty women, giving everyone the eye  
  
Say downtown Jimmy, tell me what you need, satisfaction guaranteed  
Guaranteed, yeah  
  
It's a perfect situation, it's so nice to have you here  
Gotta get up, gotta get in, gotta pull out, happy shiny people everywhere  
  
It's a perfect situation, it's so nice to have you here  
Gotta get up, gotta get in, gotta put out, happy shiny people everywhere
