A boy went back to Napoli,  
because he missed the scenery,  
the native dancers and the charming songs.  
But wait a minute, something's wrong.  
  
Hey! Hey!  
Now it's hey Mambo, Mambo Italiano!  
Hey Mambo, Mambo Italiano!  
Go, go, Joe, you mixed up Sigiliano.  
All you Calabrese do the mambo like crazy.  
  
And hey Mambo! Don't want to tarantella,  
Hey Mambo! No more-a moozzarella.  
Hey Mambo! Hey Mambo Italiano.  
Try an enchilada with a fish-a-barcalada.  
  
Hey goombah!  
I love-a how you dance rumba.  
But take-a some advice paisano,  
learn how to mambo.  
If you're gonna be a square,  
you're never gonna go nowhere.  
  
Hey Mambo, Mambo Italiano!  
Hey Mambo, hey Mambo Italiano!  
Go, go, Joe, shake-a like a Gioviano.

You don't-a have to go to school,  
just make a little beef flambino.

but you don't know what's-a cookin' till you  
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!  
  
Shake-a baby, shake-a,
