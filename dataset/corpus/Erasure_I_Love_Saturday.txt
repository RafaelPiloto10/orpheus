If they'd ever have told me that I'd find true love in every way  
Would I cry 'til tomorrow? Would I keep the non-believers away?  
  
Remember that late night last September when you held me in your arms so
tight?  
I was feeling kind of low, my heart was blue, I was empty 'til you came  
  
But oh what a Saturday night  
Things were going right  
As right as they'd ever been  
I know that you love me  
  
If they'd ever have told me that I'd find true love in every way  
Would I cry 'til tomorrow? Would I keep the non-believers away?  
Was I shy? Was I good? With this foolish heart?  
Did I try to deny we would fall apart?  
  
Like a knight in shining armor you came over to save me, what a bolt out of
the blue  
Just one look into those eyes you had me fallen completely head over heels in
love with you  
  
But oh what a Saturday night  
Things were going right  
As right as they'd ever been  
I know that you love me  
  
If they'd ever have told me that I'd find true love in every way  
Would I cry 'til tomorrow? Would I keep the non-believers away?  
Was I shy? Was I good? With this foolish heart?  
Did I try to deny we would fall apart?  
  
And you saw me, I was falling head over heels in love with you  
  
Saturday night  
Things were going right  
As right as they'd ever been  
I know that you love me  
  
If they'd ever have told me that I'd find true love in every way  
Would I cry 'til tomorrow? Would I keep the non-believers away?  
Was I shy? Was I good? With this foolish heart?  
Did I try to deny we would fall apart?  
If they'd ever have told me that I'd find true love in every way  
Would I cry 'til tomorrow? Would I keep the non-believers away?  
Was I shy? Was I good? With this foolish heart?  
Did I try to deny we would fall  
Did I try to deny we would fall a  
Did I try to deny we would fall apart?
