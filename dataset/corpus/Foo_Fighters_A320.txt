There's a place I'd love to go,  
Strangers they can meet there,  
Dream about the day I lernt to fly.  
I'm afraid of airaplains,  
Even though I like their wings,  
Fears to be a person in the sky.  
  
It's alright.  
And it's good this time.  
  
I look out and on the ground,  
Really don't believe it,  
Gravity can pull me from this hight.  
One day we'll come crashing down,  
What will I do,  
Never had a chance to say goodbye.  
Close my eyes and hope that it's a real smooth flight  
this time.  
Close my eyes and hope that it's a real smooth flight,  
And it's good this time.  
I looked down out on the ground,  
I looked down out on the ground,  
I looked down out on the ground,  
I look out we're going down.
