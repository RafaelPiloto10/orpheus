The old home town looks the same  
As I step down from the train  
And there to meet me is my mama and papa  
Down the road, I look and there runs Mary  
Hair of gold and lips like cherries  
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home  
Yes, they'll all come to meet me  
Arms a'reaching, smiling sweetly  
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home  
The old house is still standing  
Though the paint is cracked and dry  
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on  
Down the lane I walk and with my sweet Mary  
Hair of gold and lips like cherries  
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home  
Then I awake and look around me  
At four gray walls that surround me  
And I realize that I was only dreaming  
For there's a guard and there's a sad old padre  
Arm and arm, we'll walk at daybreak  
Again I'll touch the green, green grass of home  
Yes, they'll all come to see me  
In the shade of that old oak tree  
As they lay me 'neath the green, green grass of home
