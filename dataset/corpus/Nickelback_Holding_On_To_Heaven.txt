And if forever never comes tonight  
And if forever never comes tonight  
And if forever never comes tonight  
I'll hold on, hold on  
  
I keep listening to my chest for a beat, but there's nothing left  
It's been a week since I've seen you, and I still can't believe it  
'Cause I'm dying inside alone  
  
And in every dream we gotta be apart  
I'm like a baby with a broken heart  
But the second that I see you  
You will know how much I need you  
Because I'll never be letting you go  
  
(Now you know why)  
I'm lost without you  
And there's nothing I can do  
Your the one that I can't go without  
And by holding onto you, then I'll be holding on forever  
  
I've got you now and I'm not letting go of you  
Never been together long enough  
Because every moment I'm with you, it's like I'm holding onto heaven  
  
And if forever never comes tonight  
And if forever never comes tonight  
And if forever never comes tonight  
I'll hold on, hold on  
  
In a symphony, baby you would be my melody  
And you would flow like a river, slowing going on forever  
Like a feather that's blowing away  
Like everyone that needs a fairytale, like every mother's love that never
fails  
Like every game that needs a player, and a sinner needs a savior  
I'm the villain that your willing to save  
  
(Now you know why)  
I'm lost without you  
And there's nothing I can do  
Your the one that I can't go without  
And by holding onto you, then I'll be holding on forever  
  
I've for you now and I'm not letting go of you  
Never been together long enough  
Because every moment I'm with you, it's like I'm holding onto heaven  
  
I'm willing to wait, just to see you another day  
What I'm waiting for will wash this pain away  
And it's never too late  
  
And if forever never comes tonight  
And if forever never comes tonight  
And if forever never comes tonight  
I'll hold on, hold on  
  
(Now you know why)  
I'm lost without you  
And there's nothing I can do  
Your the one that I can't go without  
And by holding onto you, then I'll be holding on forever  
  
I've got you now and I'm not letting go of you  
Never been together long enough  
'Cause every moment I'm with you, it's like I'm holding onto heaven  
'Cause every moment I'm with you, it's like I'm holding onto heaven
