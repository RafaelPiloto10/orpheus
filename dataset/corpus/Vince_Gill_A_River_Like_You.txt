A good woman's love is like a river  
Runnin' through the heart of a man  
If he gives her all he can give her  
She'll be with him at every bend  
  
And now the rivers I've crossed  
A reflection was lost  
And shallow waters left me blue  
Girl, I never came across a river like you  
  
A river like you  
Where your love runs so deep and true  
A river like you  
Like a waterfall fallin' in two  
A river like you  
  
Well, I spent all my time searchin'  
And runnin' like the wayward wind  
But you found me desperately driftin'  
And touched my heart and took me in  
  
Now your love runs through me  
And in your eyes I see  
Reflections I never knew  
Girl, I'll always be sailin' on a river like you  
  
A river like you  
Where your love runs so deep and true  
A river like you  
Like a waterfall fallin' in two  
A river like you  
  
Now the rivers I've crossed  
A reflection was lost  
And shallow waters left me blue  
Girl, I'll always keep sailin' on a river like you  
  
A river like you  
Where your love runs so deep and true  
A river like you  
Like a waterfall fallin' in two  
A river like you  
A river like you  
A river like you
