Bado, scoobado, scoobado-bado-bado. Oh, wo-yo-yo-why!  
When the whole world lets you down  
And there's nowhere for you to turn,  
'Cause all of your best friends have let you down, do-o-own.  
Then you try to accumulate,  
But the whole world is full of hate,  
So all of your best starts just drift into space.  
I know a place where we can carry on.  
I know a place where we can carry on.  
We can carry on, we can carry on,  
We can carry on, we can carry on.  
And there is people like you, people like me  
People need to be free.  
And there's a place in the sun  
Where there is love for everyone,  
Where we can be, yeah.  
I know a place where we can carry on.  
I know a place where we can carry on.  
We can carry on, we can carry on,  
We can carry on, we can carry on.  
Whe-e-e!  
When the whole world let you down  
And there's nowhere for you to turn,  
'Cause all of your best friends, a-they have let you down, down-own-own.  
Then you try to accumulate,  
But the whole world is full of hate,  
So all of your best starts just drift into space.  
I know a place where we can carry on.  
I know a place where we can carry on.  
We can carry on, we can carry on,  
We can carry on, we can carry on,  
We can carry on, we can carry on,  
We can carry on, we can carry on.
