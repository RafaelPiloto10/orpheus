Do you lie awake in the morning  
Trying to find a reason to call me  
Cause honey all that I've been doing  
Is thinking about your smile  
But none of this is necessary with me baby  
You see baby  
'Cause I like to keep it all simple  
  
'Cause you are my Satellite  
So I'm trying to keep you in sight  
But with all this space  
Can we keep it alive  
Keep it alive  
So I'm asking you baby  
Are you coming down tonight  
  
There's something in the air tonight  
That feels right  
But you're keeping me guessing  
and I'm finding it hard to catch your eye  
  
So move a little closer  
It's alright  
I know what you're thinking  
You've been circling me for a while
