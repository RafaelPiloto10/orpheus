I think I found my girl, if it's you then holla!  
Think I found my girl, if it's you then holla!  
Think I found my girl, if it's you then speak to me  
  
Girl it's getting late, the sun's going down  
And it's about the time to shake my cross the town  
But before I go, I just wanna say  
That you stay on my mind each and everyday  
  
I think I'm starting to like  
The time that we spend  
And it's building inside  
Then I can't pretend  
  
No I don't wanna fight it, I don't wanna hide the way I feel  
So I guess it's time for me to say  
That I got eyes for you baby, I want us to be together  
  
And if you feel it too, tell me, no one will treat you better  
Cause on nights like this, it's good to know that you got someone by your side
like this  
The more and more you feel like you can live your life like this  
And then you say, 'hope this will last forever'  
  
Don't know if is love, it's too early to say  
But if it's something like it I just want it to remain  
Don't know if you're the one, that takes a little time  
But in the mean time, girl you're feeling just fine  
Cause the way you look at me, never seen that look before  
And if it's a hint of what's to come then maybe can I get some more?  
  
Not trying to be too forward, but I think it's best for you to know  
I got eyes for you baby, I want us to be together  
  
And if you feel it too, tell me, no one will treat you better  
Cause on nights like this, it's good to know that you got someone by your side
like this  
The more and more you feel like you can live your life like this  
And then you say, 'hope this will last forever'  
  
I think I found my girl, if it's you then holla!  
Think I found my girl, if it's you then holla!  
Think I found my girl, if it's you then speak to me  
  
I think I found my girl, if it's you then holla!  
Think I found my girl, if it's you then holla!  
Think I found my girl, if it's you then speak to me  
  
I got eyes for you baby, I want us to be together  
  
And if you feel it too, tell me, no one will treat you better  
Cause on nights like this, it's good to know that you got someone by your side
like this  
The more and more you feel like you can live your life like this  
And then you say, 'hope this will last forever'

I think I found my girl, if it's you then holla!  
Think I found my girl, if it's you then holla!  
Think I found my girl, if it's you then speak to me
