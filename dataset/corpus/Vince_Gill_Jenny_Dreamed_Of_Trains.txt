When Jenny was a little girl she only dreamed of trains  
She never played with dolls or lacy kinds of things  
Jenny counted boxcars instead of countin' sheep  
She could go anywhere when she went to sleep  
  
All she ever talked about was gettin' on to ride  
She was livin' in another time you could see it in her eyes  
Everyday after school she'd head don't to the tracks  
Waitin' for the train that was never comin' back  
  
Jenny dreamed of trains  
When the nighttime came  
Nobody knew how she made it come true  
Jenny dreamed of trains  
  
The depot's been boarded up, the rails have turned to rust  
There hasn't been a train through here since the mill went bust  
No one believed her when she said she heard the train  
Said she was just a little girl actin' kinda strange  
  
Jenny dreamed of trains  
When the nighttime came  
Nobody knew how she made it come true  
Jenny dreamed of trains  
  
Jenny laid a penny on the track one day  
In God we trust she walked away  
The very next mornin' all that she could find  
Was a little piece of copper squashed flatter than a dime  
  
Nobody knew how she made it come true  
Jenny dreamed of trains
