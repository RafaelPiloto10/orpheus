Hey, golden girl, with your hair swinging down  
All of this love you have going round  
What will you do when the gold turns to grey?  
Have you thought now  
Well, what the hay, give us some  
  
Cover yourself with the safety of lies  
You'll find it's easier 'til you face dying  
Oh, sweetest smile in a confident come along  
All of this longing you will done  
  
Up and out, goes to your heart  
And you will make yourself higher up, little fool  
And love and go down and pay to go on  
We'll lie on water, and oh  
On the way back I slip on the ceiling  
  
Caught you just then, hands were in the cookie jar  
How can we share when you sneak up and go?  
I've no intention of losing by beard  
How they design and then we go again  
  
Oh God, them horses were racing  
And, oh, bring me down  
Could put Humpty Dumpty back together again  
Now the wall won't hold anyone  
I walk in the slide  
Wait and reach your lady  
This is the short one  
Short way to lay in  
  
Oh, let her leave my hand I've given up  
Whoa, how is too late now  
  
Oh, free, just...  
Were you lying?
