1-2-3  
Ow! Uh! Alright! Uh!  
  
Got to know how to pony  
Like Bony Maronie  
Mash potato, do the alligator  
Put your hand on your hips, yeah  
Let your backbone slip  
Do the watusi  
Like my little Lucy  
Hey! Uh!  
  
Na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na  
I need somebody to help me say it one time  
Na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na  
Wo--ow!  
  
Wow! Uh! You know I feel alright! Huh! I feel pretty good y'all  
Uh! Huh!  
Na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na  
Come on y'all, let's say it one more time  
Na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na  
Wo--ow!  
  
Out in the alley  
With long tall Sally  
Twistin' with Lucy  
Doin' the watusi  
  
Roll over on your back  
I like it like that  
Do that Jerk-uh  
Watch me work y'all  
  
Ow! Do it!  
Wow! Do it!  
Just watch me do it  
  
[Repeat: 4x]  
Aah help me
