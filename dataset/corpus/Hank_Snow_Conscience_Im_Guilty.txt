Oh conscience I'm guilty I'm guilty again  
Now I'm driving home slowly my spirit's so low  
I cheated on her again and why I'll never know  
I hope I don't look too guilty when she lets me in  
Oh conscience don't ever let me do that again  
Oh conscience I'm guilty and I must confess  
Why I kissed her I knew I love the other one best  
I've been out with an old flame who's heart's full of sin  
Oh conscience don't ever let me do that again  
Between right and the wrong the love and desire  
This game that I'm playing more dangers than fire  
I might talk in my sleep or be caught by her friend  
Oh conscience don't ever let me do that again  
Oh conscience I'm guilty
