They tell us that  
We lost our tails  
Evolving up  
From little snails  
I say it's all  
Just wind in sails  
  
Are we not men  
We are Devo  
Are we not men  
D-E-V-O  
Are we not pins  
We are Devo  
  
Monkey men all  
In business suits  
Teacher and critics  
All dance the poot  
  
Are we not men  
We are Devo  
Are we not men  
D-E-V-O  
Are we not pins  
We are Devo  
  
D-E-VO  
(I must repeat)  
D-E-VO  
(I must repeat)  
D-E-VO  
(I must repeat)  
D-E-VO  
  
Okay lets go
