I've read the papers  
Look at this  
They say that I'm all over  
I don't know  
They're not the first ones to try  
So try  
Again  
What's the fashion?  
Is it good?  
I'll need some convincing  
If you've got it  
Then I've seen it before  
So try  
Again  
Welcome to new anger  
Do you want it?  
Do you want it?  
I don't need it  
I can stop  
I can take this or leave it  
You can have it  
But if you want it from me  
Then come  
And try  
I've been bad  
I've been good  
I've been one more hero  
I've been up  
And I've been lower than you  
So come  
And try  
If you want it  
Come and get it
