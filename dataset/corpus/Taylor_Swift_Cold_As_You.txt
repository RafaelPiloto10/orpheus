You have a way of coming easily to me  
And when you take, you take the very best of me  
So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel somethin'  
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, what a shame  
What a rainy ending given to a perfect day  
Just walk away  
Ain't no use defending words that you will never say  
And now that I'm sittin' here thinkin' it through  
I've never been anywhere cold as you  
  
You put up the walls and paint them all a shade of gray  
And I stood there loving you, and wished them all away  
And you come away with a great little story  
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You never did give a damn thing, honey  
But I cried, cried for you  
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you  
Died for you  
  
Oh, what a shame  
What a rainy ending given to a perfect day  
Oh, every smile you fake is so condescending  
Countin' all the scars you've made  
Now that I'm sittin' here thinkin' it through  
I've never been anywhere cold as you
