More of myself  
From the moment that we met  
I knew I wanna give all of myself to you  
Now wherever I may be  
I'd even brave the stormy sea  
Won't tarry on a shore  
That keeps me from your door  
'Cos I'm missing you  
More, more, more of myself  
I wanna give more of me to you  
More, more, more of myself  
I wanna give more from me to you  
More of myself  
I wanna give more of myself  
More of myself  
Every time I dream it's you, I find  
Running through the blossoms in my mind  
I know I'll love you endlessly  
Because the love you give to me  
Gets me to the core  
And leaves me wanting more  
'Cos I'm missing you  
More, more, more of myself  
I wanna give more of me to you  
More, more, more of myself  
I wanna give more from me to you  
More of myself  
I wanna give more of myself  
More of myself  
I gotta give more of myself  
Now wherever I may be  
I'd even brave the stormy sea  
Won't tarry on a shore  
That keeps me from your door  
'Cos I'm missing you  
More, more, more of myself  
I wanna give more of me to you  
More, more, more of myself  
I gotta give more from me to you  
More, more, more of myself  
I wanna give more of me to you  
More, more, more of myself  
I wanna give more from me to you  
More, more, more of myself  
I wanna give more of me to you  
From me to you, more of myself  
I wanna give it  
I wanna give it to you, baby  
More of myself, more of myself
