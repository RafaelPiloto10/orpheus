Getting near the end, now I knew the time was right for a breakdown.  
Megaton surprise but your eyes never made it a shakedown.  
Shot you full of rock 'n' roll, couldn't make your soul,  
Didn't burn you to the bone.  
Do what the man says, take the money and run.  
  
But, I never saw the splendor  
In stealing all your gold,  
Taking all your silver  
And doing what I'm told.  
  
I never saw the tears but I knew you cried for rhythm 'n' blues.  
Screaming like a wildcat I knew that I had nothing to lose.  
Shot you full of rock 'n' roll, couldn't make your soul,  
Didn't burn you to the bone.  
Do what the man says, take the money and run.  
  
But, I never saw the splendor  
In stealing all your gold,  
Taking all your silver  
And doing what I'm told.  
  
It's just a breakdown,  
Breakdown,  
Breakdown,  
Breakdown.  
  
Shaking like a leaf in the wind see me blowing away.  
Never see me fall on the ground till I've had my say.  
Shot you full of rock 'n' roll, couldn't make your soul,  
Didn't burn you to the bone.  
Do what the man says, take the money and run.  
  
But, I never saw the splendor  
In stealing all your gold,  
Taking all your silver  
And doing what I'm told.  
  
It's just a breakdown,  
Breakdown,  
Breakdown,  
It's just a breakdown.  
  
Getting near the end, now I knew the time was right for a breakdown.  
Megaton surprise but your eyes never made it a shakedown.  
Shot you full of rock 'n' roll, couldn't make your soul,  
Didn't burn you to the bone.  
Do what the man says, take the money and run.  
  
But, I never saw the splendor  
In stealing all your gold,  
Taking all your silver  
And doing what I'm told.  
  
It's just a breakdown,  
Breakdown,  
Breakdown,  
Breakdown.
