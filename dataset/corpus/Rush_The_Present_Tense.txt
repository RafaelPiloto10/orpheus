Living in the Present Tense  
When you lose the past  
And the future makes no sense  
You're living in the Present Tense  
  
Crawling out, secure and confident  
Imbued with innocence  
Ready for the whirl  
Suddenly the view was more intense  
Living in a different kind of world  
  
You're living  
Living in the present tense  
There's nothing to blame  
No victim of consequence  
You're living in the Present Tense  
  
Something you said  
It made me  
Step outside.. The moment  
Eyes pan right and left  
Around my world  
  
Open yourself  
Up to the possibility  
Aware of some reality  
Outside your world  
  
In a silent universe  
The moment can be so real  
You almost can't stand it  
  
In a distant universe  
Distracted from ourselves  
You can't help but wonder  
  
In a crowded universe  
When the talking turns to noise  
You almost start laughing  
  
You're living  
Living in the present tense  
When you lose the past  
And the future makes no sense  
You're Living in the Present Tense  
Nothing to blame  
No victim of consequence  
You're living in the Present Tense
