Awakened I have become  
Light now slips away  
Manipulate your mind  
Darkness is my slave  
  
Taste the sins of Hell  
The blood that I so crave  
The last thing that you see  
Is the hunger in my eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
Blood sucking creatures of the night  
Nocturnal spectre hiding from the light  
Cries screaming out every fright  
Eagerly awaiting plight  
Apparitions from the pits of Hell  
Death plagues the streets in which they dwell  
Demented lust, the secrets they must keep  
Addicted to your blood  
At dawn they sleep  
  
Unveil the hidden coffin  
Lift the lid of terror  
Feel the deadly cold  
Freeze you from inside  
  
Perceiving your intentions  
To slay the phantom form  
Raise the stake in malice  
You cannot plunge it down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Beware the image unseen  
Stalks your soul  
Your corpse's redeem  
  
Eternal damnation you just reward  
A servant of our Lord  
By your accord  
  
Admonish of the cruciform  
Impalement  
Immortality's scorned  
  
Rise hold fast your faith  
To lie dormant  
Is certain Death  
  
(Driven by the instinct of centuries of horror  
Implanted along the brain of the sickening parasite  
Linked together by one trait  
The Hell-filled need to kill, kill, kill, kill, kill)  
  
Emerging from their Hellish tomb  
Taking flight amidst the night  
The evening skies are raining Death  
  
Swooping down from shadowed skies  
Taking simple human form  
Shed their wings to stalk the mortal man  
  
Lock their jaws into your veins  
Satanic soldiers strike their prey  
Leaving corpses waiting for the change  
  
Blood dripping from the jaws of Death  
Not enough to satisfy  
They must drain your soul of life
