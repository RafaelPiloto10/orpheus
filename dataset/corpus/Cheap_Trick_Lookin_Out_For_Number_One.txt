I'm lookin' out for number one, yeah  
I'm lookin' out for number one  
Work and slave, sometimes succeed  
I'm lookin' out for number one  
  
I got hot but never got burned  
Well all I know is she should have learned  
Get too close you'll fall right in  
You should have known, you can't do that now  
  
I see what's goin' on  
I've known it all along  
I've seen what's goin' on  
  
I'm lookin' out for number one, yeah  
I'm lookin' out for number one  
Work and slave, sometimes succeed  
I'm lookin' out for number one  
  
When I'm hot she says she's not  
Don't get too close, she's over the top  
Think by now, well, I would have learned  
She's all talk, I really got burned now  
  
I see what's goin' on  
I've known it all along  
I've seen what's goin' on  
I'm lookin' out for number one, yeah  
I'm lookin' out for number one  
Work and slave, sometimes succeed  
I'm lookin' out for number one  
  
I'm lookin' out for number one, yeah  
I'm lookin' out for number one  
Work and slave, sometimes succeed  
I'm lookin' out for number one, yeah, oh yeah
