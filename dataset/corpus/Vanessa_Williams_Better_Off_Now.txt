I could feel it when we said goodnight  
We both knew it had to end  
We couldn't make it right  
But we still come back again  
Don't be sad 'cause we gave the best we had  
  
We're better off now, better off now  
Maybe we just don't know it  
Better off now, better off now  
Maybe this time  
We're better off saying goodbye  
  
I know I'll never feel the same  
After loving you this way  
I'd do it all again  
Though I know my heart would break  
Once you've loved like this how do you admit  
  
We're better off now, better off now  
Maybe we just don't know it  
Better off now, better off now  
Maybe this time  
We're better off saying goodbye  
  
Maybe we just don't know it  
Better off now, better off now  
It's hard to realize  
We're better off saying goodbye  
  
Close your eyes and I'll be there  
If you ever think you need me  
  
We're better off now, better off now  
Maybe we just don't know it  
Better off now, better off now  
Maybe this time  
We're better off saying goodbye
