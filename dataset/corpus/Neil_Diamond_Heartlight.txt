Come back again  
I want you to stay next time  
'Cause sometimes the world ain't kind  
When people get lost like you and me  
I just made a friend  
A friend is someone you need  
But now that he had to go away  
I still feel the words that he might say  
  
Turn on your heartlight  
Let it shine wherever you go  
Let it make a happy glow  
For all the world to see  
  
Turn on your heartlight  
In the middle of a young boy's dream  
Don't wake me up too soon  
Gonna take a ride across the moon  
You and me  
  
He's lookin' for home  
'Cause everyone needs a place  
And home's the most excellent place of all  
And I'll be right here if you should call me  
  
Turn on your heartlight  
Let it shine wherever you go  
Let it make a happy glow  
For all the world to see  
  
Turn on your heartlight  
In the middle of a young boy's dream  
Don't wake me up too soon  
Gonna take a ride across the moon  
You and me  
  
Turn on you heartlight now  
Turn on you heartlight now
