Some turnout, a hundred grand  
Get with it we'll shake his hand  
Don't bother to understand  
Don't question the little man  
Be part of the brotherhood  
Yes it's chain lightning  
It feels so good  
Hush brother, we cross the square  
Act natural like you don't care  
Turn slowly and comb your hair  
Don't trouble the midnight air  
We're standing just where he stood  
It was chain lightning  
It feels so good
