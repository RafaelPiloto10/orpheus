I hold you, I touch you  
In a maze can't find my way  
I think you, I drink you  
I'm being served you on a tray  
You see girl  
That's what I go through every day  
Is this the way it should feel?  
  
Pinch me, I'm dreaming  
But if it is don't let me know  
I'm drowning, don't save me  
It's just the way I'd like to go  
You see girl  
You thrill me, half kill me  
That's what you do  
  
Ai no corrida, that's where I am  
You send me there  
You dream is my command  
Ai no corrida, I find myself  
No other thought  
Just you and nothing else  
You and nothing else  
  
Before my heart saw you  
Each day was just another day  
Night, the lonely interlude  
Just came, then blew away  
You know girl  
Everything was come what may  
Until you fell in my life  
  
This spell I'm under  
Has caught me, I'm in a daze  
Your lightning and thunder  
Sets my poor heart ablaze  
You see girl  
You thrill me, half kill me  
That's what you do  
  
Ai no corrida, that's where I am  
You send me there  
You dream is my command  
Ai no corrida, I find myself  
No other thought  
Just you and nothing else  
You and nothing else  
  
Ai no corrida, that's where I am  
You send me there  
You dream is my command  
Ai no corrida, I find myself  
No other thought  
Just you and nothing else  
You and nothing else  
  
Ai no corrida, that's where I am  
You send me there  
You dream is my command  
Ai no corrida, I find myself  
No other thought  
Just you and nothing else  
You and nothing else  
  
I hold you, I touch you  
In a maze can't find my way  
I think you, I drink you  
I'm being served you on a tray  
You see girl  
That's what I go through every day  
Is this the way it should feel?  
  
Pinch me, I'm dreaming  
But if it is don't let me know  
I'm drowning, don't save me  
It's just the way I'd like to go  
You see girl  
You thrill me, half kill me  
That's what you do  
  
Ai no corrida, that's where I am  
You send me there  
You dream is my command  
Ai no corrida, I find myself  
No other thought  
Just you and nothing else  
You and nothing else
