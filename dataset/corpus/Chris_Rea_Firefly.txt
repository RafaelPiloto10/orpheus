Go to that secret place  
Inside your soul  
Go to its deepest place  
Only you and I know  
Can you see her?  
There she is still shining bright  
When the sun goes down  
See her crimson glow through  
the darkest of nights  
She smiles and says  
Everything is alright  
There will never be goodbye  
While we still see the firefly  
  
The firefly  
She smiles and says  
Everything is alright  
There will never be goodbye  
While we still see the firefly  
  
There will never be goodbye  
While we still see the firefly
