Lonely table just for one  
In a bright and crowded room  
While the music has begun  
I drink to memories in the gloom  
Though the music's still the same  
It has a bittersweet refrain  
  
So play the song the way it used to be  
Before she left and changed it all to sadness  
And maybe if she's passing by the window  
She will hear a love song  
And a melody  
And even if the words are not so tender  
She will always remember  
The way it used to be  
  
Friends stop by and say hello  
And I laugh and hide the pain  
It's quite easy 'til they go  
Then the song begins again  
  
So play the song the way it used to be  
Before she left and changed it all to sadness  
And maybe if she's passing by the window  
She will hear a love song  
And a melody  
And even if the words are not so tender  
She will always remember  
The way it used to be
