Another sad day, another lonely day  
For all we know some people only cry  
They have no good times, no poetry rhymes  
They don't know how or when or if or why  
Why the goodness never stays  
Or why love didn't come again today  
  
Isn't there someone who knows they're in trouble  
Isn't there someone who sees  
I'll be the someone who cares that you're dying for love  
I can be the someone that you need  
  
I know you dream at night and lay your feelings down  
And you wish your life could be more like your dreams  
What a moonlit sound, your voice is not too loud  
But somehow I hear it coming through to me  
I pray you hang on to your dream  
And I hope it gives you all the love you need  
You need  
  
Isn't there someone who knows that you're hurting  
Is there someone to believe  
Well, I'll be the someone who cares that you're dying for love  
I can be the someone that you need  
  
Don't you miss love, I know I often do  
That's why I'm pulling you closer to me  
But like anything you can't see  
It's just a little harder to believe  
  
Isn't there someone who loves you completely  
Isn't there someone like me  
Well, I'll be the someone who cares that you're dying for love  
I can be the someone that you need  
I can be the someone that you need
