I still get jealous  
When they look at you  
I may not show it  
But I do  
  
It's more than I can bear  
When they start to stare  
'Cause they think you're  
Too good to be true  
  
I still get jealous  
When we kiss goodnight  
Unless you hold me  
Extra tight  
  
And, dear, I know a secret  
You didn't know I knew  
I still get jealous  
'Cause it pleases you  
  
And, dear, I know a secret  
You didn't know I knew  
I still get jealous  
'Cause it pleases you  
  
Maamaa  
Dear dolly, I know a secret  
You didn't know, I knew  
I still get jealous, honey  
Very jealous, ja ja ja  
I still get jealous  
'Cause it pleases you.
