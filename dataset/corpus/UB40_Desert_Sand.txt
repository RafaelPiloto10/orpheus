You tell me there's no darkness  
While the sun shines down on you  
And just because your life is peaceful  
There's no fighting left to do  
For every cup that runneth over  
Many more are filled with pain  
You talk to me of sunshine  
When it's pouring down with rain  
  
Just because you can't see it  
Doesn't mean it isn't there  
Just because it can't touch you  
Doesn't mean you shouldn't care  
For every life that's lit with love  
Many more are racked with pain  
You talk to me of sunshine  
When it's pouring down with rain  
  
  
(CHORUS)  
  
It's a long black night, good people  
Descended on our land  
Share your light  
Make a flower grow  
In the desert sand
