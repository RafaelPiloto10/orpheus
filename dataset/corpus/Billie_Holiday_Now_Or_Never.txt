Hey fat daddy make up your mind  
'Cause I've been waiting such a long, long time  
Now baby or never 'cause I been so good to you  
Now baby or never 'cause I've been so lonesome, too  
Now baby or never if I mean anything to you  
Now baby or never 'cause you wasted so much time  
Now baby or never 'cause you can't make up your mind  
Now baby or never and it ain't no fault of mine  
It's got to be yes or no  
It's either you stay or go  
You can't leave me on the shelf  
You gotta commit yourself  
It's either you will baby or won't fall  
In love with me  
  
Gonna call you once more on the telephone  
I'll give you till twelve then I'll be gone  
  
I waited last night for you to call  
You give me no consideration at all  
It's now baby or never 'cause you wasted so much time  
Now baby or never and you must make up your mind  
Now baby or never and it ain't no fault of mine  
It's got to be yes or no  
It's either you stay or go  
You can't leave me on the shelf  
You gotta commit yourself  
It's either you will baby or won't  
You do baby or don't  
Either you will baby or won't fall in love with me
