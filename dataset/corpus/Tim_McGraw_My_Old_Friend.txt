My old friend, I recall  
The times we had, hanging on my wall  
I wouldn't trade them for gold  
'Cause they laugh and they cry me  
Somehow sanctify me  
They're woven in the stories I have told, and tell again  
My old friend, I apologize  
For the years that have passed  
Since the last time you and I  
Dusted off those memories  
The running and the races  
The people and the places  
There was always somewhere else I had to be  
And time gets thin, my old friend  
Don't know why  
Don't know why  
Don't know why  
Don't know why  
  
My old friend, this song's for you  
'Cause a few simple verses was the least that I could do  
To tell the world that you were here  
'Cause the love and the laughter  
Will live on long after  
All of the sadness and the tears  
We'll meet again  
My old friend...goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
  
My old friend  
My old friend  
Goodbye  
Goodbye
