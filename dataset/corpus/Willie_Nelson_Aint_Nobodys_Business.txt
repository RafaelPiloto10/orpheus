There is nothing I can do  
Nothing I can say  
That folks don't criticize me  
But I'm gonna do  
Just what I want to anyway  
Don't care if they all despise me  
  
If I go to church on Sunday  
And I honky tonk all day Monday  
Ain't nobody's business if I do  
  
And if I should get a feeling  
I wanna dance upon the ceiling  
Ain't nobody's business, oh it ain't nobody's business if I do  
  
If I stay out all night  
Spend all my money, well that's all right  
It ain't nobody's business if I do  
  
You try to tell me I got no right to sing the blues  
What gives you the right to tell me what I should do?  
It ain't nobody's, ain't nobody's business if I do  
  
Well it ain't nobody's business  
It ain't no it ain't nobody's business  
You know it ain't nobody's business  
Ain't nobody's business what I do  
Whoa what I do  
You know it ain't nobody's business  
Ain't nobody's business if I do
