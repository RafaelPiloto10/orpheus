I'm as fake as e wedding cake  
And I'm Vague and I know that I'm homopolitan  
Pitifully predictable  
Correctly political  
  
I'm the new, I'm the new, new model  
I've got nothing inside  
Better in the head and in bed  
At the office  
I can suck and I smile  
New, new, new model  
  
I can choke and diet on coke  
I'm Spun and I know  
That I'm Stoned and Rolling  
  
Lifelike and poseable  
Hopeless and disposable  
  
I'm the new, I'm the new, new model  
I've got nothing inside  
Better in the head and in bed  
At the office  
I can suck and I smile  
New, new, new model  
  
Don't let them know how far you go  
Or that you use you "lovers"  
Oh look, you're like a vcr  
Stick something in to know  
Just who you are you  
  
New, new, new model
