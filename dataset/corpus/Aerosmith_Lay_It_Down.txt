Ruby red... her lips were on fire  
A do me with a kiss, if you please  
Tell me what your sweet heart desires  
Tell me how you want it to be  
  
'Cause if it's love you want  
Then you won't mind a little tenderness  
That sometimes is so hard to find  
  
(Lay it down)  
Lay it down  
Make it alright  
(Lay it down)  
Lay it down  
I'll hold you so tight  
(Lay it down)  
Oh...before the morning light  
It's gonna be alright  
  
Oh...lay it down  
Come and lay it down tonight  
  
Tell me how you feel when we make love  
Tell me is it real or just make believe  
You will never know what'chor made of  
'Til you open up your heart to receive  
'Cause if the love you got that same old crime  
We're talkin' tenderness that's so hard to find  
And I'm gettin' behind you  
  
(Lay it down)  
Lay it down  
Make it alright  
(Lay it down)  
A lay it down  
I'll hold you so tight  
(Lay it down)  
Yeah... before the morning light  
It's gonna be alright  
  
Oh...lay it down  
Come and lay it down tonight  
  
Do you remember them times talkin' in your sleep  
With a pocket full of promises you never could keep  
From your best friends lover you dreamt about then  
When you pullin' up the covers the voices in your head  
  
Say if you want it bad  
Don't ever let it slip away  
  
'Cause if it's love you want and tenderness...yeah  
  
(Lay it down)  
Lay it down  
Make it alright  
(Lay it down)  
Lay it down  
I'll hold you so tight  
(Lay it down)  
  
Oh... before the morning light  
It's gonna be alright  
  
Oh...lay it down  
Gonna lay it down tonight  
Gonna come around tonight  
You gotta lay it down
