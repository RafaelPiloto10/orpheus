I need someone's hand to lead me through the night  
I need someone's arms to hold and squeeze me tight  
Now when the night begins I'm at an end  
Because I need your love so bad.  
  
I need some lips to feel next to mine  
I need someone to stand up and tell me when I'm lyin'  
And when the lights are low and it's time to go  
That's when I need your love so bad.  
  
So why don't you give it up and bring it home to me  
Or write it on a piece of paper baby, so it can be read to me  
Tell me that you love me, and stop driving me mad  
Oh because I, I need your love so bad.  
  
I need your soft voice, to talk to me at night  
I don't want you to worry baby,  
I know we can make everything alright  
Listen to my plea, baby, bring it to me  
Because I need your love so bad.
