At the age of eighteen  
I had had enough  
And by twenty one  
I decided to get tough  
And then I found the guard  
Was still too rough  
And I've been hurt  
Ever since that day  
I've been hurt and I've lost my way  
I still think I have a chance  
To find your love  
Well, I tried to love you  
One day at a time  
Each day waiting  
Hoping for the sign  
It was clear I needed luck  
More than this time  
And I've been hurt  
Ever since that day  
I've been hurt, well, I've lost my way  
I still think I have a chance  
To make you mine  
My empty heart is  
Counting all the ways  
Fire and desire  
Sat and count days  
Will you, won't you  
When and where  
Do you, don't you, do I care  
That same eternal question  
Is always there  
It's always there
