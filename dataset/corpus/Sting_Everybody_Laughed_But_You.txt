Everybody laughed when I told them  
I wanted you, I wanted you  
Everybody grinned they humored me  
They thought that someone had spiked my tea  
Everybody screamed they told me you  
Would cost the moon, we'll be there soon  
Everybody laughed till they were blue  
They didn't believe my words were true  
  
Everybody laughed but you  
It's easy to lose touch with all the friends  
You like so much or liked so much  
Everybody laughed they couldn't take me seriously  
Abandoned me  
Sometimes I would read of things they'd done in magazines  
They made the scene  
Everybody left with such important things to do  
But I'm not blue  
  
Everybody left but you  
Everybody left but you  
  
Many years have passed  
And some have fallen by the way I heard them say  
Everybody dreamed but those who fell  
Are sleeping now, they're sleeping now  
Everybody climbed like ivy to the top most branch  
It was their chance  
Everybody grasped till they were through  
It's all they thought that they could do  
  
Cause everybody fell  
Everybody fell  
Everybody fell but you
