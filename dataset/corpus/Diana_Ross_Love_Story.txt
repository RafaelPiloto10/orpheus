I like your brother  
I like your mother  
And I like you !  
I like you too  
  
We'll get a preacher  
A preacher already ?  
I'll buy the ring  
And we can hire a band  
With a violin and an accordeon  
And a tenor who can sing  
  
You and me, you and me, baby  
You and me...  
  
We'll have a kid  
Oh... we may have to rent one  
He's got to be straight  
'Cause we don't want a bent one  
We sure want no bent one  
  
He will drink his baby booze  
From a big breast cup  
Someday he'll may be president  
If things loosen up  
  
You and me, you and me, baby  
You and me...  
  
When our kids are grown  
With kids of their own  
They'll send us away  
To a little home in Florida  
Where we can play checkers  
Playin' checkers can be fun  
  
You and me, you and me, baby  
You and me...
