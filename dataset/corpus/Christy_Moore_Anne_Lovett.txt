Everybody knew, nobody said.  
A week ago last Tuesday.  
She was just fifteen years.  
When she reached her full term.  
She went to a grotto.  
Just a field,  
In The Middle of The Island.  
To deliver herself.  
  
Her Baby died,  
She died  
A week ago last Tuesday.  
It was a sad slow stupid death for them both.  
Everybody knew, nobody said.  
At a Grotto  
In a Field  
In The Middle Of The Island
