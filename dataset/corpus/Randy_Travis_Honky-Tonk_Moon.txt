Dirt road in the twilight, woods so cool and dark.  
Up ahead pale neon, somewhere a dog barks,  
Honky tonk moon, keeps shining on my baby and me  
  
Breaking up the pool balls, chalking up the cues  
Jukebox pumping softly, lazy summer blues  
Honky tonk moon, keeps shining on my baby and me  
  
Through the blue smoky haze, all through the haze  
Trouble seems to melt away,  
My heart's on a roll, I'm easy in my soul  
There's no hurry, no worry, things are goin' my way  
  
My arms around my baby, shufflin' on the floor  
Cigarettes and saw-dust, squeaky old screen door.  
Honky tonk moon, keeps shinin' on my baby and me.  
  
Outside the dark is falling, stars are twinkling bright  
That old hoot owl is calling, every-things all right  
  
Honky tonk moon, keeps shinin' on my baby and me.  
Honky tonk moon, keeps shinin' on my baby and me.
