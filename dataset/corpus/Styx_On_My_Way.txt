"...everybody plays this one right, everybody gets a fresh, hot latte and a
scone..."  
  
Oh what a beautiful night  
Couldn't get any clearer  
Yeah what a wonderful sight  
My old life in the rear view mirror  
  
Hey now I'm travelin' light  
Duffel bag and a six string  
Yeah but it feels so right  
To hear the bells of freedom ring  
  
Gotta get away from  
The same old same  
Let a new day come  
Start over again  
  
Hey I was stuck in a grind  
Little fish in a little pond  
If I had a criminal mind  
I'd have got myself a gun  
  
Had to get away from  
The ball and chain  
Let a new day come  
Or start goin' insane  
  
I'm on my way  
Don't know to where  
But I'm gonna get there  
  
On my way  
Look at the world  
With my brand new eyes  
  
I can't believe I feel so high  
I'm on my way tonight  
  
Hey I was going to seed  
Spreading out like a corn field  
I had so much denial to feed  
I was full of nothing real  
  
I had to get away from  
My old routine  
Let a new day come  
Start over again  
  
I'm on my way  
I don't know to where  
But I'm gonna get there  
  
On my way  
Look at the world  
Through my brand new eyes  
  
I can't believe I get to feel  
So good  
So high tonight  
  
Starting tonight  
There will be  
A revival  
In my world  
  
Turn on the lights  
And you'll see  
This one man band  
Is now a symphony  
  
And the sun  
Is gonna shine  
Like a summer time  
That has no end  
  
And the love  
I will find  
I have no doubt  
That it will be mine  
The love I find  
Will all be mine  
  
I had to get away while  
I could still be saved  
Let a new day come  
Stop digging my grave  
  
On my way...  
I have faith  
The road up ahead  
Gonna get much easier  
  
On my way  
Look at me now  
With a brand new life  
  
I can't believe I feel so high  
I'm on my way tonight  
  
"...'scuse me, waitress, latte's and scones for everybody!..."
