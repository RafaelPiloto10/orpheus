Baby you are the song of my life  
And the sweetest melody  
And I love making love to your eyes  
It's like singing in the perfect key

You are my number one hit

And it's the perfect atmosphere  
It's guaranteed to make you platinum  
All you gotta do is come here

The way you put your music on me  
Symphony should be your name  
It's like God gave me the perfect echo  
When he sent your love my way  
  
You are my number one hit  
My number one hit

New York to L.A. then press on to Rome  
L.A. then Vegas then press our way home  
Our music plays all around the world  
And my life has been a smash since you became  
  
My number one hit
