Ridin' on to wheels  
Chain suit on my heels  
Sittin' on leather  
Ridin' on steel  
Put my shades on  
Hair blows in the wind  
I give some square the finger  
Now he won't look again  
Now, you were sittin' home  
And I got sent to Nam  
I went through the big house  
You just worked at job  
Hear me calling  
Can't you hear my death tone?  
Hear me calling  
Can't you hear my death tone?  
Hear me ride  
On into the night  
Pull along side  
If you're looking for a fight  
My social workers  
Got me on a chain  
Keeps me out of jail  
So the paper prints his name  
Unemployment checks  
Run out next week  
It won't be very long  
'Til I'm back on the streets again  
Now, you were sittin' home  
And I got sent to Nam  
I went through the big house  
You just worked at job  
Hear me calling  
Can't you hear my death tone?  
Hear me calling  
Can't you hear my death tone?  
Hear me ride  
On into the night  
Pull along side  
If you're looking for a fight  
Death tone  
Death tone  
Gonna ride on my death tone  
On into the night
