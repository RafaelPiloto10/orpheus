In the name of god you kill in the name of your god  
In the name of god you conquered in the name of your god  
  
All religion should be wiped out  
So that people may just live  
What divides us is an illusion  
Made up by men in their confusion  
  
In the name of god you kill in the name of your god  
In the name of god you conquered in the name of your god  
In the name of god you hate in the name of your god  
In the name of god you boast in the name of your god  
  
Spoke of love no one would listen  
Seems everyone's trying to prove something  
Starting over may be the best thing  
So stop the bombs and let's begin  
  
Cause this war no one can win and it seems I'll never learn  
Oh this war no one can win well it seems I'll never learn  
  
In the name of god you kill in the name of your god  
In the name of god in the name of your god you conquered  
In the name of god in the name of your god  
  
All religion should be wiped out  
Save the people stand and live  
What divides us is an illusion  
Made up by men in their confusion  
  
In the name of god you kill in the name of your god  
In the name of god you conquered in the name of your god  
In the name of god you boast in the name of your god  
In the name of god you hate in the name of your god  
  
In the name of your god, why do you kill?, why do you hate?, in the name of
god, in the name of god
