Anywhere you say to be  
From the sky down to the ground  
If I hear you calling me  
I will never let you down  
What if I were far away  
Would the love fire still burn  
I want to know if you would be  
Still in love when I return  
  
Are you gonna love me  
I'm who I should be when you're loving me  
Are you gonna love me  
And give this love a chance ...would we dance  
  
I know the way you feel  
I shouldn't worry 'bout the future now  
It just gets in the way  
Don't want to make you sad  
Just want to know you're gonna love me  
When it's not a sunny day  
  
Are you gonna love me  
When the skies are grey and I'm far away  
Are you gonna love me  
If I have to go ...do you know  
  
Interlude:  
It's all about (You and me, you and me)  
Will you wait for me  
(It's all about love, love, love)  
About your love  
  
You were feeling kind of blue  
When the job took me away  
The reason that I'm calling you is  
I'll be coming back today  
  
Are you gonna love me  
Girl, it's been so long  
Is the feeling gone  
Are you gonna love me  
That's what I'm asking you  
Whatcha gonna do  
  
Repeat Interlude  
  
Are you gonna love me  
(Are you gonna love me, baby) (Love me)  
(Love me now) (ah Love me) (Love me)  
Will you wait for me  
  
(Are you gonna love me, baby) (Love me)  
(Love me now) (ah Love me) (Love me)  
Are you gonna love me  
  
(Are you gonna love me, baby) (Love me)  
(Love me now) (ah Love me) (Love me)  
Will you wait for me  
  
(Are you gonna love me, baby) (Love me)  
(Love me now) (ah Love me) (Love me)  
Are you gonna love me  
  
(Are you gonna love me, baby) (Love me)  
(Love me now) (ah Love me) (Love me)  
Will you wait for me  
  
(Are you gonna love me, baby) (Love me)  
(Love me now) (ah Love me) (Love me)  
Are you gonna love me, love me  
  
(Are you gonna love me, baby) (Love me)  
(Love me now) (ah Love me) (Love me)  
Love me baby, love me baby  
Love me baby, love me baby
