She's got dinner on the table at seven  
The kids are tucked in bed by nine-fifteen  
And she's headed for a hotel at eleven  
To meet a man her family's never seen.  
As the elevator takes her to her lover  
She thinks about his wife at home asleep  
And she knows it must be painful to discover  
That the man you love's not always yours to keep.  
Well, she's one man's bride  
And she's one man's on the side  
She wonders why it takes two men  
To keep her satisfied.  
She's a hard workin' house-wife  
Right now she's occupied  
She's one man's woman  
And one man's on the side  
Yes, she's one man's woman  
And one man's on the side.  
She thinks about her husband when it's over  
But she justifies her love affair somehow  
She knows it can't go on like this forever  
But she takes it all from day to day for now.
