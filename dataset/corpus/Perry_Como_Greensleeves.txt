Alas! my love you do me wrong  
To cast me off discourteously  
When I have loved you so long  
Delighting in your company!  
  
Greensleeves is my delight  
Greensleeves is all my joy  
Greensleeves, my heart of gold  
And who but my lady greensleeves?  
  
I have been ready at your hand  
To grant whatever you would crave!  
I have both wagered life and land  
Your love and good will for to have!  
  
Greensleeves is my delight  
Greensleeves is all my joy  
Greensleeves, my heart of gold  
Who but my lady greensleeves?  
  
Well, I will pray to God on high  
That thou my constant sea may see  
And that yet once before I die  
Thou will doth say to love me!  
  
Greensleeves is my delight,  
Greensleeves is all my joy  
Greensleeves, my heart of gold  
And who but my lady greensleeves?  
  
Who but my lady greensleeves?
