[Intro: Poems of Power - Ella Wheeler Wilcox]  
The human wheel, that force unseen  
The offspring of a deathless soul  
Can hew away to any goal  
The walls of granite intervene  
Be not in patient delay, but  
Wait as one who understands  
When spirit rises and demands  
The Gods are ready to obey  
  
[Verse:]  
Take my money like an ugly beak  
Covered in my mind, but too dumb to see  
A Fibonacci burnin' by your jealousy  
I'm happy to pull my veins out  
And braid a rope, I don't need ought  
To know that you die slow  
I'm happy to pull my veins out  
And braid a rope, I don't need ought  
To know that you die slow  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
You are what you believe, yeah  
You are what you beat, yeah  
  
[Chorus:]  
There were men of brand new parents  
Didn't know it yet  
So we chanted work work work  
But they didn't know they were dead  
Didn't know they were dead  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Then the winter flew to a sick young coward  
Look into then, like went on hating  
Re-Jubilating, a gently apple to own by God  
  
[Chorus:]  
There were men of brand new parents  
Didn't know it yet  
So we chanted work work work  
But they didn't know they were dead  
Didn't know they were dead  
  
[Bridge:]  
Slave Never Dreams To Be Free  
Slave Only Dreams To Be King  
Slave Never Dreams To Be Free  
Slave Only Dreams To Be King  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
You are what you believe, yeah  
You are what you beat, yeah  
  
[Bridge:]  
Slave Never Dreams To Be Free  
Slave Only Dreams To Be King  
Slave Never Dreams To Be Free  
Slave Only Dreams To Be King
