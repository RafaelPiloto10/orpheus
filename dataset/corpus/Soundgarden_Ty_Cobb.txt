I'm sittin' in a magic hat  
With smoke and mirrors  
And tire rubber fires  
Watch me disappear  
What made it slow you down  
Sucking on a ball and chain  
Another motherfucker goes down the drain  
Hard headed fuck you all  
Just add it up to the hot rod death toll  
  
Sick in the head sick in the mouth  
And I can't hear a word you say  
Not a bit, and I don't give a shit  
I got the glass, I got the steel  
I got the love to hate  
All I need is your head on a stake  
Hard headed fuck you all  
Just add it on the hot rod death toll
