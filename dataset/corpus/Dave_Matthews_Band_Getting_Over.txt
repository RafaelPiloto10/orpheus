It's been three nights or so, since I last slept.  
Just thinking about the promises you never kept.  
And all the times I tried so hard to leave.  
In response to words I never could believe.  
  
They told me you're crazy,  
They said that you've lost your mind.  
And I've got no reason,  
To think otherwise.  
You told me you loved me,  
But I guess that you told me lies.  
Now I see the real you,  
That hides behind your deep blue eyes.  
  
Wait,  
And all our time has seemed to fade.  
In the end your colors changed.  
And we're now getting over.  
  
Here's all the pictures you never wanted to take.  
With your toothless smile that always seemed so fake.  
And all the notes you wrote when you got bored.  
I don't think I need to read them anymore.  
  
It's all to confusing,  
When I don't know where to begin.  
It'd almost be easy,  
If only we could pretend.  
But how could I feel you,  
When you'd never let me in.  
And how am I to know where you're coming from.  
If you never tell me where you'd been.  
  
Wait,  
And all our time has seemed to fade.  
In the end your colors changed.  
And we're now getting over.  
  
Lie for a lie.  
But I'm not the unforgiving type.  
It'll probably just take a while.  
Wait for me to get my feet grounded.  
Find the love that you never found in me.  
I find love on my feet, in places you'll never be.  
Wait til' I find my place in the sky and finally see through my clear eyes,  
I soon will realize it's time for me to say good-bye.  
  
You told me you loved me,  
But I guess that you told me lies.  
I'm so sick of the real you,  
That hides behind your deep blue eyes.  
They told me you're crazy,  
They said that you've lost your mind.  
And you have showed me nothing,  
To prove them otherwise.  
  
Wait,  
And all our time has seemed to fade.  
In the end your colors changed.  
And we're now getting over.  
Again,  
Looking back on time we'd spent.  
It's funny to remember when  
We used to be together.
