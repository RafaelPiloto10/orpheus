Know I love you, so don't you pay em' no mind.  
People say our love ain't gonna last too long. And they point at us, just like  
We've been only carry on, keep on looking in my eyes and we'll be fine. You

I love you, so don't you pay em' no mind.  
Stay with me and let em' see, let em' know that you love me, that you love me,
if  
It's true who cares what they do? Cause I don't need anyone but you. Just you  
And me, we're gonna make it all alone. Let them laugh at us, we're gonna build  
A world all our own, Keep on then, keep on holdin on to me,they'll learn in  
Time. I really love you, so don't you pay em' no mind. You know I love you,
